Basically, how the hell am I supposed to take care of myself, do school, have a job, etc etc etc? This is definitely a mix of ASD and depression and all the other fun things I was diagnosed with, but it’s *really* interrupting my life.

I can only do one thing a day: be that showering, eating, schoolwork, working, an appointment, gaming, or even just speaking to someone online. I forget to eat, I rewear the same clothes, I never brush my teeth, but that one’s been gone years ago. I’m a year behind on school, and it’s dragging out my plans to go to university in England. I need to function so badly, and I can’t.

I haven't been doing anything with my life and yet I melt down really bad like once a week, it's all so unmanageable. Existing feels so unmanageable. Existing is enough of a task. I drive to the coffee shop and next thing you know I'm screaming like a child in my car because, I don't even know!!! Something small and stressful happens and I fucking pop!!! I can't go outside, I can't even do anything inside. I just want to bare minimum function. 

Yes, I go to therapy. We are working through super big stuff to eventually hopefully get to this, but that's like breaking apart trauma stuff and I need a fix now! My future is depending on me now and I'm stuck.",2,1749118266.0,autism,2,1.0,False

**As ""Always"" my universe does not recognize season 8, so all events take place after ""Hollanders Woods"".**

**At the beginning of this story there will be liberal use of the F Bomb. I view, as many other fanfiction writers do that, she had a love affair with that word in certain situations, in the bedroom and out. (Stana in a deleted scene from season 4 actually said to Dr. Burke, ""I want to fuck his brains out"",) so we can assume if the actress talks like that so would Kate, especially considering where she works.**

**I just bring this up, because if you don't like the word, either skip the part, or don't read this, (It's only one paragraph).**

**All my stories come from a deep love for these two amazing characters. That's the only reason I write. I love their Love story. ""Always"" will.**

Rick Castle had been walking on eggshells all morning, as his very pregnant wife Kate, had been on a tirade. Kate was 36 weeks into her 3rd trimester only about 4 more weeks left or so, and he wondered if he could survive. Not being able to have coffee, seemed to be one thing to much today. No coffee has always made his wife Grumpy, but with everything else going on, it was just one thing too much. The pregnancy had been event free for the most part. Morning sickness had been about normal, and he had been there for her, every step of the way (holding her hair during the puke fest, and what not), but the fact was that she was almost 38 years old, so extra precautions had been taken to make sure the baby would be healthy. More restrictions on bed rest and an earlier than normal leave from the precinct, as her doctors felt that as Captain, she was in a higher-than-normal stress filled job, so her hours had been cut back, and she would be taking the next month off. None of these things, were making his wife a happy girl.

They had found out early on that they were having a girl, and Castle had suggested the name Lilly Johanna. At first, he wasn't sure how Kate would like the name, but after he suggested it, she threw him on the bed and thoroughly made him speak in only 1 syllable words. Needless to say...She liked it!

Kate had stormed off crying and ran, (Or her version of running now) to their bedroom, and as usual lately, for no apparent reason. Castle trying not to hover, which he was prone to do, was standing outside of his bedroom door, and he heard a conversation with some explicit words coming from his wife's mouth, not that it surprised him as she was prone to let loose with some really inventive words, with the f- bomb being her favorite. He slowly entered the bedroom and saw that Kate was in their walk-in closet, having a running conversation with herself and they're baby girl. As he listened in, he heard:

""I can't wear my fucking stilettos, I dress in a fucking muumuu, nothing else fucking fits, and I want my fucking coffee! I feel like a rutting animal... all I do is fuck, pee, eat, and sleep, and we can't seem to find a position for the screwing part anymore, because I'm so fucking fat!"" As she felt her daughter kick her hard, she started to feel guilty and started to cry again, ""I'm sorry baby girl, your Mommy is so sorry for yelling. I look forward to having you, but could you just make sure that you hurry up for me, and maybe stop sitting on my bladder?"" Kate said thru her tears.

She heard a soft chuckle coming from inside the bedroom. Oh God she thought, ""Castle is that you?"" and she poked her head out of the closet and saw her husband leaning up against the door, with his arms folded across his chest, with a slightly amused look on his face. She asked incredulously ""Were you just eavesdropping on me?""

""Technically my love, to eavesdrop, one has to be with someone else. You ran away from me in a huff, and I was worried, so as I came to look for you, I heard a running conversation with someone, and knowing that there is no one in the loft other than mother who is upstairs, I knew it had to be you conversing with you, and considering you've walked in on me talking to myself multiple times, and thought it was funny, you don't really have a leg to stand on.""

Kate hung her head, and Castle watched as she waddled over to him (risking death, he would never say waddle aloud) and placed her forehead against her husband's chest. ""Mm' sorry Castle."" Tears running down her face.

Castle brushed a kiss on top of her head and said, ""It's okay honey... How bout this."" Kate raised her head to look into his eyes, ""How would you like it if I was to rub some cocoa butter over your belly, and tell Flower our love story?""

His wife smiles, and says, ""That sounds nice Babe, ""she bites her lower lip and asks, ""Maybe could you throw in a foot massage?""

Castle chuckles, ""Of course I can...Anything for my beautiful wife. I'll go grab the cream and you can hop up on to the bed.""

Kate mumbles, "" I'm not beautiful...and I don't hop anymore Castle.  Beached Whales don't hop...they flop around.""

""Oookay... could you then flop up onto the bed then honey?""

""You think you're so funny Mister Castle.""

""I know I am... Now do you want me to rub your sweet belly or not?""

""You know I do... and you're a big meanie. Just give me a couple of hours, to get onto the bed."" she huffed,

Ten long minutes later and a lot of grousing from his pregnant wife she gets herself situated on the bed.

""Do you want to take your top off or just pull it up?"" Castle asks.

Kate smirked, ""You just like looking at my big boobs now, don't you?""

""I'll have you know that I love your boobs in all their shapes and sizes... I'm sure you've heard the saying that anything over a palm size is a waste,"" he laughs.

""Keep telling yourself that, Mister top 10 most eligible bachelor. When we first met, you were always ogling women's chests.""

""Not sure what you're talking about Mrs. Castle, I would never... and I'm insulted at your insinuations. Though I do like the word ogling.""

Kate snorts, ""Oh, you're so full of shit.""

He laughed, as he applied a generous amount of cocoa butter to her belly and heard his wife moan in pleasure. ""Feel good honey?""

""Mmmm yeah, so good. You going to tell Lilly our story now?""

""Ah yes...Where to begin... As Castle rubbed her belly, he placed his face near her bump and started to weave his tale. ""Well Flower, it all started one day when your Mommy came to my book signing party, seeking out my counsel for a murder that she had come across. Someone was using my books to murder people.""

""Seeking out counsel Castle,"" she smirked, ""What kind of messed up story are you telling our daughter?""

""Quite woman, no remarks from the peanut gallery. Now as I was saying Flower, your Mommy and her friends had arrested the wrong man, and your Daddy had to save them from their clueless ways. Daddy was so good that your Mommy asked me to write a book about her and follow her around for research, and that's what started our great love story.""

""OMG...You're so lucky you're doing a nice job with the cocoa butter mister, or I would be swatting you over and over for lying to our daughter.""

""Flower, you need to know something about your Mommy, she has been known for physically and verbally abusing your Daddy, so fair warning to you. Now may I continue with the story my love?"" His wife just huffs. ""The thing Flower that you need to know is that your Mommy is extraordinary, and I knew that from the moment that I met her... It didn't take long for me to fall in love with her. Your Mommy is a superhero to me. Shes brave and smart, and kind, and she's one of the most loving people I've ever met. You're going to adore your Mommy.

Kate listening to her husband talking to they're daughter and what he was saying, made her wonder for the millionth time why the hell had she waited so long to be with him. He was her everything, and she knew that he was going to make a phenomenal father. God, she thought I'm so fucking hormonal right now, as her tears flowed while her husband spined his tale.

Castle layering another amount of the cocoa butter on her belly continued. ""Now, Flower... You need to know that as wonderful as your Mommy was, she made some horrible decisions and started up relationships with a couple of evil men, that tried to prevent your Daddy from being with her, especially this evil Doctor who always got in the way. Daddy was so happy when the evil man was vanquished.""

""Babe,"" Kate sighed, ""Dr. Motorcycle Boy (Kate knew that her husband hated the name Josh, so she used Castles moniker) wasn't evil. He was a good man; he just wasn't you.""

Talking to her belly Castle said, ""Lilly, you and I will have to disagree with Mommy on that subject. Anyway, baby girl, your Mommy finally succumbed to my charms, and we fell in love. You are going to be so loved by us, and you're going to be my little Flower.""

""Babe, as much fun as I've had listening to this fairy tale, I think that your daughter as made it her mission in life to see how often she can make me pee. I think the story telling is over for now. You can massage my feet later, but I think I could use some food.""

""Okay, honey what concoction do you feel like for dinner today?""

Kate lowers her head as her hair falls over her eyes and says blushing, ""Think you could make me a s'morlette?""

Castle laughs and says, ""Absolutely, welcome to the wonderful world of Chez Castle, and his delicious delegacies. One amazing s'morlette for dinner coming up.""

As Kate headed towards the bathroom, Castle started to get everything ready to make his masterpiece. His mother happened to walk into the kitchen as he started cooking.

""Oh, Richard... Really,"" his mother said disapprovingly, ""You're not making one of those disgusting chocolate egg things again, are you? You'll stink up the whole kitchen.""

""I'll have you know mother that my wonderful and very pregnant wife has solicited her husband's creative genius to make her one.""

""Oh my... Katerine must really be having horrible cravings to want that. That poor child!""

Kate walked in at that moment. ""Ooooh... that smells good Babe.""

""Oh, really Katherine, are you sure you want to eat that gruel?""

""Mother, don't you have some place to be or someone else to annoy. I'm sure Martha Rogers company is wanted elsewhere,"" Castle chides.

""Don't be an old maid dear, and yes I'm out for the evening or night if I get lucky.""

Castle places his hands over his ears...""La la la la... don't want to hear about you cavorting around with your cohort's mother.""

""Well, I see Katherine is in capable hands, so I'll just say ta""... and with that Martha Rogers waltzed away.

Castle finished up with his masterpiece and placed it in front of his wife and sat back and watched.

""Mmmm, this is so good Babe.""  Castle laughed to himself not saying anything as his wife had taken a large bite and now had Nutella all over her lips and chin. ""Staring is still creepy Castle. What are you looking at?""

""Nothing honey,"" he laughed, ""Just watching my wife enjoy her dinner, and maybe making a slight mess.""

Kate stared back at her husband and raised an eyebrow, then started to take her finger and grab all the chocolatey goodness from chin and face and licked her finger clean. She smacked her lips and said, ""Good till the last drop... now get me a napkin oh annoying one.""

As Castle finished up with the dishes, Kate had worked her way over to the couch. ""Babe, can you massage my feet now?""

""Of course, honey,"" and with that Castle plunked himself down on the couch and took Kate's feet into his lap and started to work his magic on her swollen feet.

Kate watched her husband and marveled at the way he always was so attentive, and loving to her, and the baby. She hated that she lashed out at him occasionally, even though he knows she doesn't mean it. All he has ever done is to be there for her, even way before she was pregnant. The one constant in her life, that she could depend on, that has never let her down, and she loves the fact that he knows her so well. Early on she used to hate that, no wanting anyone to know her that well, so she could hide behind her walls, but as time went on, him knowing her so well, had made it actually easier. He seemed to have an extinctual way about him that always knew ahead of time when she needed comfort, or silence, or a little alone time. He was so good at that.

Castle watched his wife puzzling though some thought and just waited for her to get it out. He learned early on with her that she'll get out what's bothering her at some point, but you couldn't force it, because she would just clam up, so he waited and sure enough she said:

""Hey Babe, do you really think I'll be a good mother? (She said with a slight panic to her voice), ""I don't even know what the hell I'm doing. Remember last time with little Cozmo, I barely knew which end to hold up. I just worry that I won't be good enough for her. That I'll screw our Baby up.""

Castle knew a long time ago that there were two versions of her. Kate Beckett the detective and now Captain and Kate Beckett/ Castle. Det. Beckett was the woman who put on power heels and shrunk from no man. Her steady resolve, and unflinching desire to bring justice to this world was a cornerstone of her work persona. She took no shit from anyone, and criminals shrank in her wake, but Kate Beckett the woman and Kate Castle the wife were different from Det. Beckett, or Captain Beckett.

The things he learned quickly from the moment she showed up at his door soaked and crying, was that Kate Beckett/Castle, was an entirely different person than the Detective. He had fallen in love with the Detective version first, but after being with her in a relationship, he realized that he absolutely adored his Kate. There were so many things that made him love this Kate way more than the Det version. He had been so surprised to find out that she loved to sleep naked and cuddle... saying she liked skin on skin, (though she told him that she hadn't been that way with anyone else), he would find himself in the morning with her leg draped over his thighs, and her head on his chest and her arms around his torso, and he was just in heaven, because he was a closet cuddler himself. Kate the woman, loved sci-fi TV (that horrible Nebula 9 show... though he liked her dressing up in her Lt Chloe outfit). She liked to play laser tag, loved Forbidden Planet, comic books, and magic. She loved to laugh and do silly things (He still remembers the day that she was hiding under the blankets and letting him think that his helicopter was attacking him, and how hard she had laughed). He knew that she had a beautiful singing voice, when she would get slightly drunk and would sing karaoke at the Old Haunt, but it had amazed him to find out that she loved their dance and singing routine in the shower as much as he did.

He also found out how insecure the very confident Kate Beckett could get relationship wise... always questioning early on if they could make the relationship work, and now she's afraid of being a bad mother. He wishes she could see herself though his eyes, and then she would know just how wonderful, and beautiful, and smart she really is. He thinks it's always boiled down to the fact that people in her life had let her down, to the point that she questioned everything, unlike her Detective persona which questioned nothing. His wife didn't seem to have the ability to not over think every situation. As a Detective that ability and drive made her the best, but as a girlfriend and wife it sometimes led her to doubt herself (and early on in their relationship... them). That's why he's always believed in the Yin and Yang theory. Her weaknesses were his strength, and his weaknesses were her strength, and during this pregnancy he felt that his strength was getting her to believe just how great of a Mom she was going to be.

After Castle heard her question, he looked at her like she grew a set of horns, ""Of course I do...Kate all the little things that your sweating, like breast feeding for instance...you're going to put Lilly near your nipple and she's going to grab on to it like a seasoned pro,"" Kate laughs at that...""It might hurt a little, but it will feel wonderful all at the same time. Changing diapers is just a matter of repetition, in a matter of days it will be second nature. You and I are going to have days where Flower is teething, or sick, and we won't know why at that time what the problem is, and we will panic, until we figure it out, but all of these things don't make for a great mom or dad, they are just things that need to be done. Where you are going to excel as a mother will be in your loving and protective nature that you have. Being a great parent sometimes just comes down to always being there for them. The good and the bad. You'll be the best Momma bear there is. No one would dare hurt our little girl with you around, and when she's older, you'll take her to her grammas grave, and you will tell her all about how amazing her gramma was. You'll tell her the story of when you had your tonsils removed and how Johanna and you sat on the couch vegging out to Temptation Lane and eating ice-cream... I did this all on my own Kate, and it can be hard, but the rewards are too numerous to mention, and now I have a partner in crime and life. That baby will know nothing but being loved, and her mom will be a hero to our Baby.

Castle looked over at his wife, and big tears running down her cheeks...""Castle, I love you so much...Thank you for being my partner in life and having such faith in me.""

Castle...his eyes glistening, ""The only one that should be thanking any one here is me thanking you for giving me a chance to love you. You're all I ever wanted Kate Castle, and now with this little girl, my dreams really have come true... so thank you my love.""

xxxx

Kate started struggling to keep her eyes open, ""Babe, I'm getting little sleepy, do you think even if you're not tired... could lay in bed with me until I fall asleep?""

Castle put his wife's feet back on the couch, lifts himself from his seated position and holds his hands out to his wife to help her up. They walk into the bedroom together, and he waits until Kate gets situated as best as she can into a sleeping position, then he nestles himself behind her, placing his hand across his wife's belly and against they're daughter.

""Never thought I'd have this, Castle... Never thought I would have this life, or the life growing inside me... it seemed so bleak sometimes. I can't wait to see our little girl, she's going to be so spoiled""

Her husband says, ""I picture a little girl with brown curls and greenish/brown eyes with flecks of gold, and when I tell her stories, she'll roll her eyes at me and with her hands on her hips say, ""Seriously Daddy.""

Kate lets loose with a big laugh and says, ""I picture a little girl with brown hair and beautiful cerulean, blue eyes, sneaking up on people, and when I ask her what she thinks she's doing she says, ""Practicing my Ninja Skills Mommy, for when I have to hunt down Bigfoot.""

Castle chuckles, ""Flower will be so loved Kate, you'll see...because we're awesome!""

Kate thinks to herself that with this man beside her they can do anything...So as she starts to let sleep take her under, she mumbles, ""Yeah we are Babe... Truly awesome.""

But lately my toddler has been waking up randomly around 1-2am crying or screaming (trying to troubleshoot that). But, that fully wakes me up, and then by the time she’s settled and back to sleep, we’re into the witching hours and all hope is lost for me.

Ever since I started working (I was already on fluvoxamine) I was always having trouble to keep myself awake and focused on the job (it is administrative/office stuff), even after I quit and was only studying, I couldn't study for like 1h/1h30 straight without having to take a nap. Now that I am back to the work field, I feel even worse, sometimes I almost doze off at meetings or looking at the computer. 
And I had *never* realized that this could be the medicine effect until now. I have taken apneia and blood tests and it was all OK. So i wa thinking the sleepness was on me. But maybe not??? Nobody ever told me it could be a side effect, ofc I read the drug leaflet but they always give 100 types of side effects. 
Last week I told my psychiatrist about this and he decided to decrease the lithium dosage to 300mg because he said it can reinforce the fluvoxamine side effects. A week later and I still feel not real difference. 

I don't really know what to do and I am afraid to lose this new job because of the constant tiredness. (And I have tried so many techniques for staying awake)

Has someone else dealt with that? What did you do? Or what would you do?


PS. This sleepness is present even on days i sleep for 10h-12h. Or even on the days I take a power nap.
PS 2. On weekdays I can only sleep for 7h-7h30 (I spend too much much time commuting and there is nothing i can do about it)

He was this brilliant guy, always having perfect scores. On the other hand, I was pretty average in studies. We liked each other, messaged in secret, had an emotional history, but it didn't go past dating. I wasn’t ready and wanted to focus on my studies, as my target was engineering, so I wrote him a letter explaining that I didn’t want to pursue anything serious at the time. He accepted it, we moved on, and we stayed friends on and off.

We went to the same university (different departments) and started to talk again. At that point, I was in a committed relationship with my classmate, who is now my husband. Around that time, he had gone through a breakup. As a friend, I tried to be supportive and encouraged him to move forward. Eventually, he met someone he wanted to marry, and both of us got married to our respective partners. I moved abroad for work, while he stayed back in our home country with his wife.

Fast forward: Last year, when I visited my family, we met for coffee. He suddenly started to point out how my dressing sense got bad, and I have so many pimple marks on my face. I explained that I had to pack light because I was there only to visit my family, and I am leading a stressful life now in a new country. 

A couple of months ago, he called me to ask about a photo I had recently uploaded to social media. He asked me whether it was really me and how I got so fat. I was flabbergasted. I could not think of any reply to that question while he sent me a picture during the call. It was the letter I wrote to him. He then said that he was cleaning his desk and found it and how the letter says I much I used to like him. I asked him directly what he wanted. He said that he is soon to be a father and he will call me as soon as the baby is born.

I later saw pictures of his daughter on social media but didn’t congratulate him. Although he texted me a few times after that, I haven’t responded yet. I’m still torn—unsure whether it’s worth staying in touch with him anymore.

there was no glowing light,
no holy whisper.
just the hiss of the oxygen machine
and the silence between his inhales
getting longer
than anyone was ready for.

everything they said about life
being short
is a lie.
it is long.
so goddamn long
when you’re watching someone leave it
inch by inch
in a room that smells like bleach
and memories that won’t sit still.

i learned about love
when i clipped his toenails
because he couldn’t reach anymore
and didn’t want the nurses to see them.
i learned about shame,
dignity,
and how love is sometimes
just pretending it’s not a big deal
when it is.

i learned that men cry
at the end.
even the ones who didn’t
their whole lives.
even the ones who didn’t
say much more than “pass the salt.”
his tears weren’t loud.
they just slipped out
while he apologized
for taking up too much space.

he said, “sorry,”
and i wanted to scream
what the hell are you sorry for?
for dying slow?
for needing help?
for not being more than what you could be?

i forgave him things
he never asked forgiveness for.
and that, too,
is love.

the world kept going,

the mail still came.
the coffee still burned.
people still posted brunch photos

three rooms away.

everything worthy of knowing about life
happened in those days—
how time isn’t real,
how bodies betray,
how the strongest people shrink
into hospital gowns
and still manage
to look like giants.

i learned that grief
isn’t the moment they go—
it’s every second after
when they don’t.

it’s folding their favorite shirt
and feeling like a thief.
it’s the instinct to call
and the slap of remembering
you can’t.

i learned that you can be full of love
and still feel rage.
that caretaking is holy
but also
sometimes
a quiet form of self-erasure.
that you can hold someone’s hand
and still not know
how to let them go.

i watched my dad die
and the world
crack open.
not with fireworks—
but with the gentle, brutal
truth of it all:

we’re all just passing through,
leaving fingerprints on doorframes
and hoping someone
remembers the sound of our laugh.

Here’s my combo since we’re nearing finals season, hope it helps anyone out there:

- Study game: the simpler the better, too much features = too much time wasted on planning. I found Study Bunny does the job, 10coins/hr of study and I get to spend them on my pet bunny!
- Listening Audio: According to your needs, ranges from needing focus (use 40Hz playlists) to needing energy and motivation (use House genre, specifically the type you’d here in a ZARA store lol)
- A shit ton of water: even if you hate those army grade megalodon water quenchers (like Stanley’s for ex) they’re really handy if you’re sitting for hours on end.
- Distraction free zone: once on your desk you can’t have your phone in hand, even if I need to use it a lot to ask classmates or check info, I always make sure to do it outside of the distraction free zone.
- Snack every few hours, fruits and nuts, dark chocolate, NO energy/sugary drinks they’ll cause earlier burnout.
- If you’re nearing midnight drink tea or coffee (I don’t drink coffee so idrk if that’s worse, me personally I only drink tea and can remain awake till roughly about 4am after 2 mugs)
- If you have money to spend: maximize your setup’s ergonomics, get a chair with lumbar support, a rocking foot rest to let out your energy on, memory foam pillows, etc..
and if we’re talking extra $$$ a height adjustable standing desk is a game changer. I had a budget on desk setup and spent roughly around 400$ total for a chair, desk and accessories. 

Studying will feel like a luxury more than a chore (because education is really a privilege).

1l3v8k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1l3v8k7/caffeine_withdrawal_pre_workout_withdrawal_and/,"Caffeine Withdrawal, Pre workout withdrawal, and the challenges to face.","Hey reddit, Long story ahead and what a journey It has been. I wanna make this post to share my experience so far with caffeine and Pre workout withdrawal.

To start, I'm 28 years old, male. VERY active my whole life. Karting, Mixed Martial Arts, Motocross, Superbike, and of course a whole lot of work. I work in the motorcycle Industry.

I always was used to with going to the gym for long hours or after work. I usually take caffeine everyday but only around 100 to 150 Mgs max. (Unless im on a very long ride and require more). I got into this trend of trying pre workout to boost out my workouts since I have been very focused on back training and getting back into shape. So I first purchased packets of HYDE nightmare that contained 300mg of caffeine per serving. I consumed 3 servings of those for 2 weeks and was ok, gave me energy tingles and all. Then one week I decided to try the RYSE LOADED pre workout with around 400mg of caffeiene and behold, It would be something that I would regret and would swear off by this day.

I took the first dose of Ryse pre workout around the 1st week of May? it was good. Energy was awesome etc. but the 2nd time I did it really hit me. I took the 2nd serving around May 13 and my god I still remember what happened that day, as I was working out I decided to rest a bit and eventually, I could feel tingles in my face and a bit of numbness as well which lead me to having the worst panic/anxiety attack I've had ever. I was palpitating, out of breath and felt REALLY dizzy and my head was heavy so my mother rushed me to the hospital. 

Long story short, all my tests were normal, ECG was good, CT Scan with Angiogram was clear, EXCEPT for my neck X ray which showed straightening of my neck due to muscular spasms. 

However, withdrawal was the next problem I had to face. for my 1st week of completely stopping coffee or pre workout I had the most Insane amount of head pressure/tension headache that I could feel. It wasnt painful but It made you dizzy, and would knock me out cold sleeping after around 30 mins of standing up. Then I would feel fine then when I stood up, bang it would hit again. This went on for a week. 

2nd Week, was more 50/50, I could still stand up more but then again the tension headaches and dizziness would come back and anxiety and depression were new to me. It would knock me out again after about a few mins of standing up.

3rd-4th week (As I am writing now) I am now about at 70 percent of what I was. I can walk, I can run but the dizziness and tension headaches would still attack and would linger when I would stand up. Its so annoying but I ahve to push through, Its so scary because I'm not used to this kind of tension/lightheadedness ever in my life. It's also so depressing thinking that because of one stupid choice, I have to deal with this and be scared will all the symptoms I have. The tension honestly feels like you are living in 3rd person and someone put a tight band over your head and you can't focus and so much more. it also kinda makes yo udizzy? But not like vertigo dizzy. 

What's even more annoying is I'm not necessarily sure what exactly is causing the tension, Both of my parents are clinically diagnosed with anxiety so that's one thing. I have caffeine withdrawal for sure that's another, and my Neck spasms arent 100 percent yet so I'm doing physical therapy and it has helped a bit so far. (Sometimes the tension would come from my neck and annoy my head.)

I'm writing this because I want to address that I am sure the RYSE LOADED pre workout was definitely a factor here, if I could go back in time I would completely remove all pre workouts and never ever try that thing again. But I am also hoping I am not alone in this, i am already very anxious, depressed about what Im feeling and even thoug hIm getting better, Theres still that fear that the tension headaches and dizziness might remain forever. But then again, I'm doing my best and life goes on. I'm not used to slow recovery at all but I hope to be in tip top shape soon. If anyone there has what I feel please know you are not alone, this has been one of the most challenging things I'm facing to date. It affects everything.",2,1749117312.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1l3v8im,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/1l3v8im/im_a_trans_woman_but_youd_think_im_a_man_im/,I’m a trans woman. But you’d think I’m a man. I’m attracted to women. But I want a male partner. But I love lesbian cultures and aesthetics and vibes. Am I valid? How can I have more lesbian vibes?,"Hi! So I’m writing this post to connect, and ask for advice. It’s going to be a little longer of a post. I really hope folks here will validate me. Please be gentle, I’m insecure, and struggling with a lot.

I’m a trans woman, I’m 34, and I started HRT a year ago. I don’t present feminine at all. If you’d see me on a street or in a coffee house, you’d think I’m a man, a maybe even the kind of man that you know… Um, you know the type, who is socially withdrawn, doesn’t seem to put any effort into their appearance or health, spends all of their time on their computer at home, etc. Maybe you’d think I’m a little queer because I have long hair but I wear it in a lazy messy manbun. I mean over the last year two people “mistaken” me for a woman when I was turned back to them.

Emotionally I feel quite feminine actually. I hate the way most men socialize, one upping each other all the time, trying to figure out who is on top in any social situation. Also the societal expectations of men, and things like feeling inherently worthless or worth only as much as how useful and productive I am. I love how women socialize, how they support and protect each other, how they share in good and bad things, and are so close emotionally together and how kind they are to everyone. I love how brave and vulnerable they are and how amazing survivors are they in this really awful patriarchal world full of toxic masculinity.

I grew up in Poland, hiding my transness. I knew I wanted to be a girl as long as I could remember. But it was really taboo and really ostracised in Poland in the 90s. I moved to the Netherlands as soon as I could, but I think I’ve already internalised a ton of homophobia and transphobia, and have a chronic ptsd, social anxiety and depression. I tried to have my life as man, lose weight and date. But it never felt right. Finally after Covid, I was tired of carrying this “dirty secret” alone and decided to share it with my gay best friend / mentor. I came out as “wanting to be a girl” to him and I thought I wouldn’t do anything about it. Maybe by some women’s sneakers, but that’s it. But not three months later I was already on hormones. 😅

But all my hobbies, mannerisms, the way I walk, talk, breathe and think, it’s all been long set in stone long time ago. In therapy recently I realised my masking goes so deep it is my entire personality. And I hate it, I hate myself so much. I don’t want to be that.

So I’m trying to immerse myself in the women’s perspective, feminism, their struggles, challenges, various cultures and perspectives. To understand them better, to try to be closer to what I want to be. The more I learn the more in shock I am about how bad things are and I understand more people’s voices and opinions.  It makes me humbled and really ashamed of my social conditioning as a man. I really don’t want to have anything to do with toxic masculinity. I feel like it’s probably the culprit for most social issues in the world.

Physically I’m still attracted mostly to women. Although with testosterone blockers and estrogen, it has been much more difficult to interpret my own feelings in this area and I feel like things became much softer and less defined. Ever since I was a teenager I had some attraction to other boys, and as an adult that is still present. Not a lot though. I would notice a man once every month or less. Now after hormones and exploring myself emotions more I think I notice men more often maybe even every day. But this attraction feels different. There is very little physical attraction (there is some though, sometimes there a little bit of literal butterflies in my tummy haha). And there is a lot of romantic attraction. Wanted to be treated as a woman. Cared for, protected, noticed, loved. I’m also very uncomfortable with my physical attraction to women, it feels very… I don’t know how to describe it, but it’s not wholesome. I’m disgusted by myself, and I wish that physical desire was gone. Of course I would never in a million years hurt or make a woman uncomfortable in any way, I go out of my way to avoid any kind of situation, behaviour or words that could be felt that way.

On top of all of that I feel like women are so amazing as people. They are so strong, so smart, so powerful but also so kind so thoughtful, so elegant, graceful, and at the same time not afraid to be messy, real, raw and authentic in a culture that pressures them so insanely much to conform to really idiotic and really inhuman standards.

And I feel that way especially about lesbians. And it’s not really about you know like the simplistic definition of lesbians as women who are attracted to women. It’s just that they are so so cool! I can’t really explain this. But if I had a choice to be born as what I want, I’d want to be born a lesbian. Not because of attraction to women, honestly I’d be very happy being with a man. But spiritual, emotionally, culturally, as a person, having very much lesbian mindset and view of the world.

I don’t mean to stereotype. Any lesbian or a woman or a person is an individual. Everyone is different, and I don’t think there is any one way anyone should be. If you identify as a lesbian you are one no matter who you are and what you do, how you look or think. Same with being a woman, or anything else.

But it just happens that my biggest idols always end up being lesbians or queer women. I just really think they are so cool and amazing. It’s not like a romantic attraction, it’s more “I really wish I was like her, she is so cool!” sort of thing!

But yeah I’ve been socialised as a cishet male, I never had many women friends. Although I never had many friends in general. But I’m very deep friends with my friends. I basically have only besties. 😂 I don’t have less close friends, I have few friendships even less with women, but all my friendships are incredible and very fulfilling.

Anyway I socialised as a cishet male, which I hate a lot about myself, it feels like a prison of my body and spirit, like I’m a circle shaped to be a square, stuck between things, never fitting, lost or never had myself.

And I’d like to be have more lesbian vibes about me. In the way I dress, act, live and think.

So I was hoping could you maybe share advice, resources like books and movies and music and podcasts and activities and hobbies and aesthetics, and other things about your lives that you are into, that could help me feel more well more lesbian and queer and feminine? I don’t meen the attraction to women though, I mean literally everything else but. 😅

I’m sorry this is a very long winded and weird post, I hope I’m not too much, and you can accept where I am coming from. My life hasn’t been very kind to me, it’s shaped me in ways I really wish it hasn’t. I’m glad I’ve been lucky enough to regain enough agency and courage to try to get closer to where I wish I always was and have been. I really hope I’m not offending anybody here.

My gf and I are both 19F; I’m Canadian, she’s French. We met in my town at 17 while she was an exchange student and quickly became inseparable friends, and then started dating (we haven’t told her parents, though we’re quite sure they know). She went back to France before summer, and I flew to her city 2 months later. My plan was to spend the winter in the alps, travel Europe a bit, and rent an apartment in her city the rest of the time (while learning French and taking a gap year). Her parents agreed to let me stay for a month while I found housing. Unfortunately, my visa made it impossible to rent anything, which her parents expected. They’re incredibly kind people and told me to stay until Christmas; reluctantly I accepted their kind offer. I left for January to ski, and when I came back to her city, they pushed for me to continuing staying with them, rent-free. I’ve offered to pay rent, groceries, utilities, etc. but they decline every time. I bake for them multiple times a week (buying my own ingredients of course) in hopes that it shows my appreciation somewhat. I know this isn’t enough though.

They house me, have sit-down meals with me everyday, we have coffee together, they took me to Disneyland, 3 small beach vacations, every family event/birthday/Christmas…they treat me as part of the family.

I am about to get my first semi-automatic coffee machine. I have been an avid user of the Aeropress for a few years now, and I think its time to upgrade. As this is my first full-scale machine, I have decided that the Barista Express Impress is the perfect starter for me.

However, I am also a very picky product finder. I need to get the best within the specific category and budget. I am currently not interested in getting the Impress Touch Impress.

I want to make sure that my Impress comes with the latest grinder, I have heard that Breville/Sage has included Baratza grinders into the newer models.

**So question 1: How could I know which version has the improved grinder?**

Further, I came across a color that I hadn't seen before on the Breville website. I found the machine on Amazon, and I was wondering if it was an Amazon exclusive, or just an older model. You can see the color and model here (‎SES876DBL4EEU1):

**Question 2: Does this model have the improved grinder? And why is this color not showing on the official website?**

I am not the biggest fan of the colors on the official website. Hence I got a little excited when I noticed the blue version on Amazon, which would fit much better into my kitchen.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a replacement water filter cartridge deeply depends on its features; these include filtration capacity, material, certifications, and more. The features are key because thay showcase what makes the cartridge stand out in the market.

**Filtration Capacity**

Filtration capacity refers to the volume of water a cartridge can effectively filter before needing replacement. Superior cartridges boast higher capacities, often ranging from 150 to 200 gallons, ensuring extended use and reduced replacement frequency. This capacity is crucial for households with varying water consumption levels, guaranteeing consistent water quality over a prolonged period. Cartridges should be able to demonstrate a standardized testing of its capacity to ensure quality.

**Material Composition**

The materials used in constructing a water filter cartridge directly impact its performance and longevity. High-quality cartridges frequently enough incorporate activated carbon, ceramic, or multi-layered filtration systems. Activated carbon effectively removes chlorine, sediment, and volatile organic compounds, while ceramic filters target bacteria and cysts. The combination of different materials ensures a broad spectrum of contaminant removal. The materials must be safe, food-grade materials, and free of harmful substances like BPA.

**Contaminant removal Efficiency**

Contaminant removal efficiency measures the cartridge's ability to reduce specific contaminants to acceptable levels. Top-rated cartridges target a wide range of impurities, including lead, mercury, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. Autonomous laboratory testing and certifications, such as NSF International standards, provide validation of the cartridge's effectiveness in removing these harmful substances. Consumers should prioritize cartridges with documented removal rates for their primary water quality concerns.

**Flow Rate**

The flow rate of a water filter cartridge dictates the speed at which filtered water is dispensed.High-performing cartridges maintain a consistent flow rate without noticeably reducing water pressure. A flow rate of at least 0.5 gallons per minute ensures a convenient and uninterrupted water supply. Cartridges that compromise flow rate can lead to frustration and inconvenience, especially in households with multiple occupants.**lifespan Indicator**

Advanced replacement water filter cartridges incorporate lifespan indicators to provide users with timely alerts about cartridge replacement. These indicators may be electronic, mechanical, or time-based, offering a visual or audible signal when the cartridge's filtration capacity is nearing exhaustion. Lifespan indicators eliminate guesswork and guarantee optimal water quality by prompting timely cartridge replacement. Ensuring the indicator works accurately is key to having clean water.

**Compatibility**

Compatibility is crucial when selecting a replacement water filter cartridge. The cartridge must be compatible with the existing water filtration system. Many brands offer worldwide cartridges designed to fit a range of systems. Though, verifying compatibility with the manufacturer's specifications is essential to avoid leaks, improper sealing, or reduced filtration efficiency. Always confirm the cartridge dimensions and connection type before purchasing.

## Core Benefits

The core benefits of using high-quality replacement water filter cartridges extend beyond just improving water taste; they significantly enhance health, convenience, and cost-effectiveness.

**Enhanced Water Purity:** Replacement water filter cartridges ensure the removal of perhaps harmful contaminants such as lead, chlorine, and bacteria. This process significantly reduces the risk of waterborne illnesses and promotes better overall health by providing access to cleaner, safer drinking water. Families with young children or individuals with compromised immune systems especially benefit from this enhanced purity.

**Improved Taste and Odor:** Many municipal water supplies contain chlorine and other chemicals that can impart unpleasant tastes and odors to drinking water. High-quality replacement cartridges effectively remove these substances, resulting in water that tastes fresher and more appealing. This encourages increased water consumption, leading to better hydration and overall well-being.

**Cost Savings:** Investing in replacement water filter cartridges can lead to notable cost savings compared to purchasing bottled water. Over time, the cost of bottled water adds up considerably, whereas replacement cartridges offer a more economical and enduring solution. Additionally, filtered water eliminates the need for expensive water delivery services.

**Environmental Friendliness:** Using replacement water filter cartridges reduces reliance on single-use plastic water bottles, contributing to a more sustainable environment. Plastic waste poses a significant threat to ecosystems, and by filtering tap water, consumers can minimize their environmental footprint. Choosing reusable water bottles filled with filtered water is an environmentally conscious practise that helps reduce pollution.

**Prolonged Appliance Lifespan:** filtered water prevents the build-up of mineral deposits and sediment in household appliances such as coffee makers, refrigerators, and ice machines. By using filtered water, the lifespan of these appliances can be extended, reducing the need for costly repairs or replacements. This is a particularly worthwhile investment for consumers with hard water.

I’m feeling incredibly stuck and emotional right now, and I’d really appreciate your thoughts or support.

I’ve been living abroad in England for the past 4.5 years. I came here all alone to study. it was a big, brave step for me, but things changed in ways I never expected. In my second year here, I gained quite a bit of weight going from a normal body size to borderline overweight and it really affected how I saw myself. During my third year, I lost all the weight and more. For the past two years, I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder restricting, fasting, obsessively managing food to stay as small as possible.

Now I’m about to move back to my home country (eastern europe) in just a few days, and I feel completely trapped. I’m currently uw, and even though part of me knows that’s not sustainable, another part of me is terrified of letting go of that control.

The heartbreaking part is: I can’t even enjoy my final days here.

There are so many foods I’ve wanted to try things I know I won’t find back home. English breakfast. Different Digestive biscuit flavours. Cinnamon buns. Oat lattes. All these small joys I’ve denied myself over and over. I walked past Starbucks yesterday and saw the most beautiful cinnamon bun I used to love, but I didn’t let myself have it because I was fasting.

Now I feel this mix of rage and grief. I want to enjoy these last moments, go out for breakfast with my aunt, treat myself to coffee and a pastry, see a friend, wear a dress, celebrate the end of a chapter. But I feel like I can’t. Because deep down I know that if I let myself have one thing, it might spiral into a full-on binge. I know the pattern I restrict hard, then the floodgates open.

To make it even more complicated, I have a lot of pressure around going home. My mom has always commented on my body - how my face looked “chubby,” how I “let myself go.” One year she even gave me a diet plan as a Christmas gift. But when she saw me six months ago, she actually seemed worried about how thin I’d become. And the messed up part is… I felt proud. Like I finally proved something. Now I feel like I have to return home even thinner, almost like I need to make a point so she never dares to comment on my weight again.

So I made this deal with myself: restrict until I leave, then figure it out later. But it’s tearing me apart. I feel like a ghost in my own life right now. counting the minutes, avoiding food, avoiding joy.

I don’t want to binge. But I also don’t want to live like this anymore. I want balance but I don’t trust myself to find it without losing control.

Has anyone been through something like this? How do you stop the “all or nothing” cycle? How do you let yourself have things you love without spiraling? How do you leave restriction behind without losing the version of yourself you worked so hard to become?

it's therefore increasingly difficult for me to understand the current situation.

around 6 months ago i started venlafaxine. i started experiencing insomnia, where i would wake up several times during the night. i started having night sweats. i did not get less depressed.

my doctor prescribed 50mg seroquel in addition. over time we increased it to 300mg IR. at night, i take seroquel at 9/10pm sleeping around 11pm/12pm. i experience head and body feeling heavier; finding it difficult to move muscles, stiffness, needing to tense muscles to move or stand upright; pounding veins; dizziness and impaired sense of positioning, clumsiness; feeling dazed and slowed down; blocked nose and tongue entirely dry. i sit with completely dry tongue and mouth, not fixed by drinking water. resulting in getting up for water several times during the night. i hate to take it, and i read that many people are less compliant, but i've engaged in every stage with my doctor, my compliance is 100%. before i would experience none of that.

before i would wake up late but feel ok. now, it is 10am and i am fighting to stay awake. i need two cups of coffee, 300mg caffeine, not to fall asleep. now, i can barely begin any task. i feel like i have been tranquilised or aenethetised, i shuffle around my apartment. i feel more apathetic and exhausted than ever.

i asked about changing or coming off quetiapine or venlafaxine. instead, i was prescribed lamotrigine in addition. to begin with i complained about feeling tired because of depression and finding it hard to complete many tasks. now i am desperately fatigued on a completely different level of disability.

now, i find that venlafaxine has such withdrawal problems that could take months if not years to resolve. i find that quetiapine has such side effects of sedation, weight gain and dry mouth/constipation, and that it may also have withdrawal issues. i see that the number needed to treat of some of these medications is above 5. that is, only 1 in 5 get better. when i started, i was not told anything of this. one day, i didn't take quetiapine because i wanted to stay up at night. i did not sleep at all that night. the following day, i experienced shivering, and feeling sick.

i would never have personally started any of these meds if i had any knowledge of them. i wouldn't have started venlafaxine, knowing its withdrawal problems. i wouldn't have started quetiapine, knowing that i was already fatigued. i would have looked at meds such as escitalopram, bupropion, aripiprazole, and lamotrigine instead. 

extraordinarily, for someone who used to have such a high opinion of doctors, i can only recommend that you try to resolve your problems as much as possible before entering psychiatry as a last resort.

I also just noticed my right ear is noticeably red, while my left ear looks normal. I'm not sure if that's related, but it seems like too much of a coincidence not to be.

1l3uvwe,https://i.redd.it/mqjcq4ulv25f1.jpeg,"# $ATYR – Jefferies Conference Preview: Strategic Setup, Platform Signals, and the Phase 3 Countdown","Hey folks,

Today’s the day aTyr ($ATYR) presents at the Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference — one of the most high-profile institutional investor events in biotech, where emerging and established names alike make their case to the world’s biggest funds.

Coming off the back of last week’s strong SSC-ILD interim readout, there’s a lot of momentum — and a heck of a lot of curiosity. The data reinforced efzofitimod’s potential beyond sarcoidosis, and for many of us, it was a clear signal that this may be more than a one-program company. That said, we also saw a bit of price softening in the aftermath, which caught some people off guard. It does feel good though to be riding above $5.

In my view, this is all part of the rhythm: clinical progress isn’t always priced in overnight — especially in a market that’s still discovering the story. And that’s exactly what makes this Jefferies appearance so important.

As an additional signal of institutional confidence, it’s worth noting that on **June 4**, HC Wainwright’s Joseph Pantginis **reaffirmed his Buy rating on $ATYR**, maintaining a **$35.00 price target**. That’s unchanged from his prior call — but the fact that it was reiterated just days after the SSC-ILD data and ahead of this conference tells me the institutional side is staying constructive. Steady target, steady conviction.

This post is a preview — a look at why this appearance matters, what we might expect, and how it fits into a broader narrative that’s accelerating toward a major catalyst: the Q3 Phase 3 readout in pulmonary sarcoidosis.

I’ll follow up with a full post-event debrief too — but for now, here’s the lay of the land as we head into one of the biggest institutional stages in biotech.

---

### A quick note before we dive in…

I know I say this every time, but I’ll say it again: if you’ve found value in these deep dives, or even just enjoy reading them, please consider supporting the work.

This is quickly becoming a very real part of my life — and I genuinely love doing it. But it takes time. A lot of time. Writing, researching, tracking the filings, synthesising what it all means, replying to everyone (or trying to!) — it’s a big commitment. I’ve received more than 30 DM’s over the past 24 hours alone.

Some of you have already chipped in with very generous donations — and you know who you are. I see it, I feel it, and I deeply appreciate it. Thank you.

But if you’re reading this and you’ve found these posts helpful or insightful, even just throwing in a few dollars via [**Buy Me a Coffee**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BioBingo) makes a real difference. It takes seconds — and it helps me keep doing what I’m doing, and hopefully keep growing this community with you.

Okay. Let’s do this…

## Why This Conference Matters

The Jefferies Global Healthcare Conference isn’t just a check-the-box event — not for serious biotech investors, anyway. In my view, it’s one of the most strategically important forums in the mid-year calendar for small-to-mid cap companies on the cusp of inflection. Think of it as a convergence point — where science meets money, and where emerging stories get exposed to institutional allocators who are building Q3 and Q4 positions right now.

While hundreds of companies are presenting this year, only a fraction will command meaningful attention. And fewer still will arrive at Jefferies with fresh clinical data, a near-term pivotal readout, and a tight, asymmetric setup.

That’s why I think aTyr’s inclusion in a fireside chat format — just 48 hours after their SSC-ILD readout — is worth paying attention to.

Because the market isn’t just watching what $ATYR says. It’s watching *how* they say it — and *who’s* listening.

---

### The Format Signals Seriousness

Unlike pre-packaged slide decks or 5-minute updates, a fireside chat is an invitation to tell a story. It’s usually offered to companies that already have institutional buy-side engagement or strategic momentum, and it gives management the chance to control the narrative in real time.

In other words, it’s not just about showcasing past achievements — it’s about setting institutional tone for what’s next.

For aTyr, I think this timing is razor sharp:
- They just released encouraging interim results in SSC-ILD, expanding the platform’s perceived scope.
- They’re just weeks away from a pivotal Phase 3 sarcoidosis readout.
- And they’re still trading below the radar, despite clear signs of building institutional interest and technical positioning.

This Jefferies slot gives them a rare moment to connect the dots for professional investors who may have missed the nuance — or dismissed the stock as a one-indication gamble.

---

### It’s a Platform Narrative in the Making

Until now, aTyr’s core pitch has largely been anchored in pulmonary sarcoidosis. And while that remains the primary valuation driver, the early data in SSC-ILD just shifted the narrative — subtly, but importantly — toward platform potential.

This is crucial in the context of institutional psychology. The biotech market doesn’t reward one-hit wonders anymore. What it values — especially post-2021 — is breadth, translatability, and optionality. That’s exactly what the SSC-ILD readout begins to suggest.

In my view, this conference offers aTyr the chance to reframe efzofitimod as:
- A first-in-class NRP2 modulator,
- With proof of biology in two different ILDs,
- Backed by clean safety,
- And capable of targeting chronic inflammation and fibrosis across organs.

That’s a big leap from “a company with a sarcoidosis readout coming.” And if they tell that story well — and strategically — it could reshape how funds model the long-term risk/reward profile.

---

### Jefferies Is a Gateway for Strategic Attention

Let’s not forget: Jefferies isn’t just a place for hedge funds to scribble notes. It’s also where strategic pharma scouts, business development teams, and crossover funds begin taking second looks.

Many of the most lucrative partnerships, acquisitions, and licensing deals in biotech history didn’t start with a press release. They started with visibility — moments like these, where a story gets noticed and remembered. Where a company is no longer just a ticker, but a team, a thesis, and a trackable arc.

If efzofitimod delivers clean data in Q3, aTyr will become one of a very small handful of biotech names with:
- A first-in-class mechanism,
- Platform translatability,
- Orphan disease targeting,
- US-based IP (under a tariff-shielded macro regime),
- And early momentum in multiple indications.

That’s the kind of setup that acquirers start watching in advance — not after the move.

---

### The Institutional Lens Is Shifting

Finally, I think it’s worth noting the context in which this conference is taking place:
- The biotech risk-on trade is slowly rebuilding.
- Retail awareness is rising (and loud).
- Short interest in $ATYR remains elevated.
- Insider buying is on the record.
- The float is thin. The data is near. The upside is non-linear.

That’s a cocktail that invites pre-positioning, not just reaction. But for that to happen, funds need a trigger. A moment to justify pulling the model back up and re-running the base case. A way to test the management team before the data arrives.

The Jefferies fireside is that moment.

Not because something new will be announced — it almost certainly won’t be — but because tone, confidence, preparedness, and posture all matter.

And if you’re managing a $500M biotech fund and trying to find asymmetric setups heading into summer, $ATYR might look a lot more interesting after you’ve seen Sanjay and Jill articulate the roadmap live — especially coming off a well-received SSC-ILD signal.

---

### My Take

In my opinion, this conference slot is one of the most strategically important visibility opportunities aTyr has had in years. It won’t change the science. But it could absolutely change the audience watching that science unfold.

And heading into a pivotal Q3, that matters.

## What to Watch for in the Fireside Chat

When Sanjay Shukla takes the stage at Jefferies, it’s not about breaking news. These forums aren’t for disclosures — they’re for shaping perception. This is where the tone gets calibrated, and institutional conviction either starts building or stalls.

In my view, what matters here isn’t a data drop — it’s message discipline, posture, and the strategic clarity embedded between the lines. This is a real-time test of how ready this team is to guide the narrative into the Phase 3 readout window.

Here’s what I’ll be watching for:

---

### 1. How They Frame the SSC-ILD Readout

The data’s already public — but its **interpretation** is still taking shape. This will be our first chance to hear how the company wants investors to think about it.

- Do they position SSC-ILD as early validation of efzofitimod’s broader utility?
- Do they link it clearly to platform breadth and mechanistic consistency?
- Is there emphasis on rapid onset, biomarker correlation, or safety continuity?

The way I see it, this is a chance to reframe $ATYR as more than a single-asset play. If they present SSC-ILD as a strategic lever — for valuation, for pipeline expansion, or for deal interest — that signals an evolution in the investment case.

---

### 2. Strategic Tone Ahead of Phase 3

We’re now inside the Q3 window for the pivotal sarcoidosis readout. Timing matters — but so does tone.

- Do they drop clues about database lock, final visits, or general readiness?
- Is their phrasing precise or vague — “on track,” “aligned with expectations,” etc.?
- Do they sound like a team quietly confident, or one hedging in advance?

In my experience, funds listen closely to leadership tone heading into a binary. One or two carefully chosen phrases — especially if paired with confident body language — can shift how institutions position ahead of the data.

---

### 3. Commercial and Strategic Framing

aTyr recently appointed a Head of Commercial — well ahead of any regulatory decision. That’s a meaningful tell.

What I’ll be looking for:

- Any commentary on go-to-market strategy, payer education, or prescriber landscape
- Hints about partnering vs. self-commercialisation
- Signals about internal launch readiness vs. strategic interest

Institutions pay attention to this. It’s not just about the science — it’s about operational maturity. Clarity here gives credibility to the idea that aTyr is preparing for multiple scenarios, not just hoping for one.

---

### 4. Signals on Optionality

If Phase 3 reads out clean, aTyr will have multiple paths. This fireside chat may offer breadcrumbs.

- Any mention of geographic scope, BD activity, or ex-US interest
- Language that suggests inbound interest or strategic evaluation
- Whether the posture is “preparing to launch” or “preparing to transact”

These chats don’t reveal deals — but they can reveal mindset. And mindset matters when institutions are trying to price in strategic paths.

---

### 5. Institutional Fluency and Narrative Control

This one’s underappreciated — but critical.

Retail might buy a story. Institutions buy **teams**.

- Does Shukla move fluently across science, strategy, and market dynamics?
- Can he explain the trial design *and* how it affects valuation scenarios?
- Is he precise, confident, and calm under real-time questioning?

This isn’t a soft skill. This is about proving leadership readiness in a high-stakes environment. And that, in my view, is part of what institutions model when deciding whether to take exposure pre-readout.

---

### Final Thought

The Jefferies stage is where credibility gets tested. If aTyr shows strategic coherence, institutional fluency, and controlled confidence — without overselling — this could mark a turning point in how the market values them. 

Not because something new is said.

But because something important is *understood*.

And I do feel that aTyr is having a moment right now. 

## Where the Market Stands Heading In

Even before Jefferies, the setup around $ATYR has already changed — both in terms of price action and investor psychology. The SSC-ILD interim readout earlier this week didn’t just mark clinical progress; it shifted how the market is beginning to view aTyr’s strategic trajectory. But not everyone is calibrated to that yet.

Here’s how I see the current setup:

---

### Price Has Moved — But Discovery Is Still Early

The stock has more than doubled since April, climbing from ~$2.40 to over $5 in just weeks. That kind of move can often feel “late” to retail. But in my view, the move so far is better understood as early repricing, not late-stage exuberance.

- The float is still small.
- Institutional ownership remains underweight relative to conviction biotech names.
- The recent readout added scientific depth but didn’t trigger retail FOMO or media coverage.

In other words, we’ve seen re-rating at the margin — not a wholesale repositioning. And importantly, much of the volume has come from smaller hands — not yet from heavyweight institutional inflows.

---

### Institutional Interest Is Growing, Quietly

You can sense it in small but telling ways:

- The Jane Gross insider buy in March was early — but not random.
- The body language at recent events has been increasingly confident.
- Reddit traffic, inbox DMs, and buy-side engagement have picked up post-SSC.

All of this suggests institutions are circling — especially those that missed the Phase 3 entry point and are now re-evaluating efzofitimod as a broader platform play. They’re not rushing in. But they are listening. I’m sure you’ll agree that’s quite obvious. 

---

### Retail Is Focused on the Next Catalyst

From what I can see across the community, retail holders are increasingly anchored on the Q3 sarcoidosis readout — and rightfully so. That event is still the kingmaker, and most retail sentiment remains binary: *“will it hit or not?”*

What that sometimes misses is the role of **momentum scaffolding** — the narrative-building, institutional shaping, and capital positioning that happens *before* the catalyst. Jefferies is part of that scaffolding.

If management delivers a clean, confident message — and if buy-side analysts walk away with more clarity on risk/reward — it creates a floor of interest. Not a spike, but a foundation. That’s how real re-rating begins.

---

### So What Does This All Mean?

Heading into Jefferies, $ATYR is in a transitional phase:

- No longer just a Phase 3 sarcoidosis story.
- Not yet a fully recognized platform name.
- Sitting on a clean safety profile, multi-indication potential, and a well-timed visibility event.

This is the part of the arc where **positioning** starts to matter — not just science, but **perception**. How Shukla carries the message at Jefferies won’t move markets immediately. But it will set the tone for what happens when the data hits.

And in biotech — tone, structure, and setup often matter just as much as the results themselves.

## In Summary: Why This Moment Matters

In my view, the real function of events like Jefferies isn’t to make headlines — it’s to shape trajectory. These sessions don’t usually generate immediate price reactions, and they’re not designed to. What they do is send signals — to institutions, to analysts, to allocators — about what kind of company this is becoming.

And right now, $ATYR is actively reintroducing itself.

Not as a single-program biotech hoping for a lucky readout, but as a company with:

- A mechanistically differentiated molecule,
- Consistent early signals across distinct but mechanistically-linked diseases,
- A clean safety profile,
- A maturing leadership team, and
- A near-term binary catalyst in an indication with zero approved therapies.

And that’s not just a new chapter — that’s a new frame.

In a market that’s still cautious, still valuation-sensitive, and still punishing anything that feels like hope over evidence, the companies that stand out are those that can combine real biology, disciplined execution, and clear communication.

That’s the bar now. And in my opinion, this week is where $ATYR starts showing that it can clear it.

Because institutional investors — the ones who build positions before catalysts, not after — aren’t just looking for a reason to believe. They’re looking for alignment. Between management tone and trial progress. Between pipeline logic and capital strategy. Between where the stock trades today and where it could be 6, 12, 24 months from now if the pieces fall into place.

The way I see it, this Jefferies fireside isn’t about selling a story — it’s about demonstrating readiness. Readiness for the data. Readiness for partnerships. Readiness for bigger conversations. And readiness to be seen, seriously, by the kind of capital that can carry this story into the next phase.

So, yes — this is a “visibility event.” But to me, it’s also a pressure test. A moment to show that the company is no longer just waiting on a catalyst. It’s preparing to own what comes next.

And if they get that right — from the tone, to the framing, to the message discipline — this week could quietly become one of the most pivotal inflection points in $ATYR’s public life so far.

Personally, I’m very excited to tune in to the webcast! (at 4:00AM Sydney time 😩…the things I do 😆 )

I've been living in this city for about 2 years now, and honestly, I'm starting to think finding a decent date here is harder than getting a seat on the evening local from thane. I'm not even talking about finding ""the one"" - just a normal, genuine connection seems like asking for the moon.

Ive very horrible experience with dating apps. Bro, what a joke these have become. I consider myself a decent guy - not Tom Cruise level but definitely not shabby either . I've put effort into my profile, got some decent photos, wrote something that actually shows personality instead of ""I love to travel and watch Netflix.""

But the results? It's like I'm invisible. I'm getting fewer matches than the number of times local trains run on time. And when I do get a match, half the time they unmatch within days without even saying hi. The other half? Well, lets just say the conversation dies faster than my hopes and dreams.
Ans then there is  Hookup Culture Problem it just seems like everyone's either looking for a quick hookup or they're playing some weird game where they have ""multiple options lined up"". I've heard from female friends that guys literally tell them they have other options when they don't want to hook up immediately. Like, when did dating become this transactional??? 

I'm not against people doing whatever they want, but when you're genuinely looking for something meaningful, it feels like you're swimming against the tide. Apps seem to be more about ""matching to pass time"" or ""heal from emotional pain"" rather than actually connecting. work dating is obviously a no-go. My building is full of uncle-aunties who think Netflix and chill means watching Baghban on repeat.
I've tried going to cafes, events, even those networking meetups, but everyone seems to be in their own bubble. Mumbai's supposed to be this cosmopolitan city where you can meet anyone, but honestly, making genuine connections feels harder than ever.
What really gets me is that this whole experience is messing with my head. I know I'm a decent guy with a stable job, good hygiene (shouldn't even need to mention this but here we are), and can hold a conversation. But when you're constantly getting rejected or ignored, you start wondering if there's something fundamentally wrong with you. 
I see posts from women saying guys are ""tharki"" or just want hookups, and I get that frustration. But what about guys like me who actually want to take time to know someone?

We seem to be getting lost in the Shuffle?? 
So, Mumbaikars, Help a me Out
I'm genuinely curious about your experiences:
Fellow guys - How are you dealing with this? Are you having similar experiences or am I just unlucky?
Women of Mumbai - What are you looking for? Where do you actually want to meet genuine guys? Because dating apps clearly aren't working for many of us.
Anyone who's found success - How did you do it? What am I missing here?
Is it just me or has dating become this weird transactional thing where everyone's treating it like a game with multiple players?
And I know this is very long post but I'm not asking for much  just want to meet someone where we can have normal conversations, maybe grab coffee, and see if there's a connection. Is that really too much to ask in 2025?",1,1749115903.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

I (27f) have this friend (24f) let's call her El . We have known each other for around 3 years a it was a quick made friendship. We kinda just clicked .
Bit lately I am not sure if she is good for my mental health truly. 
I am gonna try to summarise, but there is a lot theta going on in my head right now, so sorry in advance if it's long.
I have been working on my self for a few years now, trying to get out of the ""dark"" , attending therapy, working out etc. last 6 months I am working more on creating and  holding my boundaries, (I am still not good at ir, but getting better. With that, I started noticing that El really did took my boundaries and restrictions seriously or ignore them as whole.
Alway trying to push me to do what SHE wanted.
I am a big people pleaser and I am working to make it better but it's still proces. So it's really hard for me to stand my ground, especially with her. 
I feel like every our conversation revolver's around her and every time we talk about me, it's a short lived conversation.
Just an examples I can think of of top of my head.
She finishes work at 4 pm , I work until night, so I usually make one of my breaks to be when she finishes so we can get coffee.Yesterday  I asked her, if she would instead come with me to bookstore cause I wanted to check something. She asked we what I wanted there and I was like, ""just so, why not right ?""
Her response was a photo of her scrunching her nose in this ""really? You have to?"" Grimace. I instantly regretted even asking. And if course we did go to the boom store, because , why would we

It's usually something similar. I want something, she makes me rethink that I actually don't want it. I do what she wants or make a compromise - But always me never her.
I mention that I was thinking about getting a manicure.She asked me a week later if when are we going. I tell her I diceded not to cause it cost money I don't have. She shrugs and tells me I think too much a why I don't want to all of sudden.
No is never good enough answer. All my reasons are almost always ""excuses"" or met with rolled eyes

Now that I realised this, I don't know what to do . I don't want to loose her as a friend because there are still good vibes good days and fun plans that I enjoy,, but I also am not sure if this is good for me .

She also always say I am her best friend a she don't know what she would do without me. But that seems a little manipulative to me sometimes idk.

I can give more examples if needed

Relapsed. 

Well, besides having AUD, my mindset is not strong cause I’m experiencing very intensively the so-caleed epidemics of loneliness. Not because of me, I’m quite pro-active. My friends, acquaintances, former co-workers that I know like me and vice versa are either going through some psychological issues, overworked or something else. I got so lonely for so many weeks that I had a gentle talk with one of the closest ones. Maybe I have done something unkind? I wanted to understand.

No, that was not the case. 

Some were also not depressed, but going through a homebody phase.

See, I’m far, very far from being much of a people’s person. I grew as a lonely child, I married an offshore worker, lol, I broke up with clingy guys. I love doing things alone. Love my house, reading a book or whatever. But stuff got serious and so I went searching on meeting apps (only tourists going to parties to “practice Portuguese” with women - no). Then I had the idea of joining a local reading club, we meet once a month. And it's not online! oh my God some people remember PHYSICAL PRESENCE is important and we can  socialize beyond instagram and zoom! \*bitter sarcasm\*.

I’ll definitely go. Absolutely non-alcoholic related.

I dealt kinda well with the recent end of a 25 year friendship (I'm using 'end’ but the only certain end is death etc, I mean we both agreed that we estabilished a connection on weak foundations and are both sick of each other now), but man that girl was present in my life. She always wanted to do something on weekends, sometimes drink in her apartament - I didn’t partake, but many times there were non-alcoholic activities. She was busy, with a 3km long list of issues, but she made the effort. She gets it, nice to chat on whatsapp but we need more. My other friends, well, guess they think it is what it is. Someone not being able to see you this month, ok, but for 4 months? I mean a two hour lunch with coffee? Pie and coffee? We all live close. I gotta be honest, I understand everyone is free but this infuriates me. 

Then, the fear. I’m anxious, I treat it with light medication, exercise, breathing techniques but.. I’m anxious. I started to get desperate. Can’t say no to an invitation, then I’ll lose friends for good!!! Am I in early sobriety and barely know anyone from the group, so this will trigger me a lot to drink? F\*\*\* sobriety!!! Where did I get this idea? To be sober? Better be a hermitt on the top of a hill!!!!

In a logical way, of course I get this makes no sense/I'm exagerating. 1) even if I didn’t have a drinking problem, would I like to go out with people I barely know.. for what? To watch them getting drunk? 2) If I'm afraid of 'losing' all my closest friends, if they are real friends they will not forget me cause I didn’t attend one event or because right now they are a bit absent. Makes no sense. 3) Does this anxiety justify putting my physical and mental health at risk? What am I doing?

It’s always perfect when it’s about being logical, but we’ve got emotions, many of them we can't even explain. I’m definitely not competing, but no friend I know is - pragmatically speaking - as alone as I am, I am 42 and don’t have a father, a mother, a partner, kids, I cut ties with my mother’s family cause they are toxic, also living in states far way, and I’m grateful to have a great brother, but despite of the great health and check-ups he turned 76. 

My plans: a) like joining the book club, joining a volunteer group. Not just to expand my social circle, I’ve been wanting to help for a while. I already got the contacts. b) working in therapy about my catastrophic thinking. People who have been friends for 20+ years will unlikely disappear for good. Phases happen. One has a partner in another state and took time off work to be with his boyfriend. Not gonna be in town. And he is one of the non drinkers! Lucky times! lol. I gotta stop freaking out like this. c) sobriety is a priority. Sobriety is a priority. Sobriety is a priority, my health is a priority and in Brazil we have an expression that would translate to “health is what matters; all the rest, we can go after”. 

I don’t believe many readers came this far, but advice and shared stories are more than welcome.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

**PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP ONLY, AND ALSO PREFERABLY BASED IN BRITAIN/UK. TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, PLEASE ONLY MESSAGE IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS.

I'm writing this because I truly don't want anyone to make the mistake I did and not know the full scope of what you're getting yourself into.  I realize that it's late in the cycle but I'm especially hoping to reach the applicant who ""doesn't have another option."" There's always another option. Transferring is not as easy as you may think, and the school intentionally sabotages students who try to leave. And if you're reading this in preparation for Fall '26, gon head and remove the school from your list rn.

\*\*I want to provide the context that I received a scholarship, performed well above the curve both semesters, and secured a great summer internship (through my own network), so please don't come for me and say I'm bitter because I didn't do well academically\*\*

So let's get into it...

Never in my life have I experienced this level of unprofessionalism, disrespect, and mediocrity. I say this not as a disgruntled rising 2L, but as a grown woman. The institution is riddled with corruption and it's not going to change anytime soon because they need to completely start over. Justice Thurgood Marshall is rolling in his grave. It's so unfortunate because only 5% of lawyers in America are Black and the school is uniquely positioned to directly impact that sad metric. But alas, our people have failed us. I think it's important to hold HBCUs accountable instead of the age old ""well that's how it is at HBCUs."" Fck that. The country is in dire times under the thumb administration (not a typo). There are so many grievances, I don't even know where to start... 

First, there's no transparency with grading. Even worse, grades are intentionally miscalculated. Meaning, they give out grades. The professors and administration are lazy so they recycle old multiple-choice exams that are circulated throughout the school therefore mad people cheat. The administrators know which students cheat and do not take action. Even worse, those students end up on the Dean's List. Not sure how that works... The curriculum deviates so far from the norm that it does students a disservice because they don't teach students to think critically. Most schools only have a final whereas some may add midterms as either a gutcheck or split the final grade calculation between the two exams. TMSL leaves the professors to their own devices to determine how they want to divvy the grades. Half of your final grade is determined by your professor and the other half is determined by a comprehensive multiple-choice exam at the end of the semester. If you're lucky, you'll only have 3-4 exams PER CLASS for the semester. If you're not so lucky, you'll end up with weekly/bi-weekly exams (oftentimes multiple exams on the same day) and have no idea how much of your grade anything is worth. Also, the exams are on scantron which I didn't know still existed in 2025. To add the icing on the cake, the school is on a C curve and they have a quota for students they flunk out. So on top of grade deflation they're luring students to the school and trapping them because on paper your grades look like shit in comparison to most other schools that are on a B curve so that limits your ability to transfer. I could go on and on but I'll leave that there.

Second, there's no career services office. Sure, there are people that sit in the office, but I'm starting to believe they act as shell employees for whatever scheme (set up by Todd!!) we've yet to uncover. There is 1 person designated to help the entire school find employment and she's not a lawyer or a full-time employee so yeah good luck finding a job... I don't know the exact stats, but a significant number of 1Ls did not secure employment for the summer (including those on the Dean's list). The whole point of going to law school is to become a lawyer. How can you do that if you can't get a job??? Furthermore, the school does not leverage the fact that it's in one of the largest cities in the country. There's no type of targeted networking or partnerships with firms or professional affiliations (like the National Bar Association) so most people end up working at the Harris County DA office or a small local personal injury firm out of necessity. 

Third, the facilities suck. The school's accreditation is on the line because the facilities are below ABA standards for learning (look it up). Separate but not equal took on a whole new meaning to me... The law library is akin to a rundown public library. The basement floods whenever there's heavy rain (it's Houston, so that's often). The singular elevator may or may not work depending on the day. You may or may not get stuck in it as well. It's like Russian roulette but with your safety. They just started serving food in the building, but only for like 3 hours a day. Nowhere to get coffee or a snack. A crackhead may come into the building and walk past security into the library and wreck havoc. Who knows. Or maybe even an armed suspect. Need to go to the bathroom? Your best bet is to walk across the street to the undergrad student center to relieve yourself. Depending on your seat in the classroom the outlet might not work so make sure to charge your laptop before. On a good day the sole computer lab has maybeeee 5 working desktops and 1 functioning printer simultaneously. Need to get some deep studying done after 7 pm? Welp, don't even think about the law library because it closes at 9 during the week and 6 pm on the weekends. During finals you may get lucky with ""extended"" hours until 11 pm. Not sure how any law student can get work done before those hours (especially when they put you in 6 classes each semester, so you don't even have time to study since you're in class from 9-5). 

Honorable mentions: no permanent dean of students (current one is incompetent), no health insurance, do not accommodate students with disabilities, curriculum is dumb and you can't take electives until 2L spring, limited clinical offerings (only like 3), old professors who barely know how to send emails, professors who have been sanctioned by the bar on numerous occasions (look it up).

I could literally keep going, but I think yall get the point. We need to hold us accountable and call a spade a spade. I genuinely think the school needs to close down for like 3 years and undergo a massive change then try again. Idk. I'm just a random person on the internet but I hope this reaches someone who will take heed of my warnings. If 1 person changes their mind based on this post then my job is done.

1l3uozs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MatchaEverything/comments/1l3uozs/ive_been_drinking_matcha_for_a_year_but_where_are/,"I’ve been drinking matcha for a year – but where are the supposed benefits? Is it actually healthy, or just marketing hype?","Hi everyone,

I’ve been drinking matcha pretty regularly for about a year now. Lately, though, I keep seeing ads and social media posts claiming it has all these amazing health benefits, like:

* improved focus and memory
* faster weight loss
* stable energy without the crashes you get from coffee
* powerful antioxidants
* calming and stimulating effects at the same time
* detoxifying the body

And honestly, I’m starting to wonder – is any of that really true?

Because after a whole year of drinking it, I haven’t noticed any major difference. I don’t feel more focused or energized, I haven’t lost weight because of it, and to be honest, lately if I have a matcha in the afternoon, I still feel sleepy by like 7pm. And no, I’m not drinking cheap matcha – I drink high-quality matcha from Japan: Nakamura Tokichi, Marukyu Koyamaen, Ippodo, etc.

I’m starting to think matcha might just be another well-marketed product with a lot of hype around it.

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Or on the flip side – has anyone actually noticed real benefits from drinking it?

Would love to hear your thoughts!

1l3ulud,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1l3ulud/how_i_met_my_girl/,How I met my girl,"It was my first week of college. New campus, new people, same old social anxiety. I remember walking into the orientation hall, pretending like I wasn’t nervous, like I belonged. But deep down, I felt like a complete outsider. Everyone was smiling, laughing, already making groups, following each other on Instagram. I just sat on a random bench and hoped the day would pass quickly.

Then she walked in.

She didn’t do anything dramatic. No twirling hair, no slow motion. But for some reason, she caught my eye. She looked confident but not loud. Calm. She walked past me and sat two benches ahead. And for the rest of that session, my attention was anywhere but the orientation speech.

Afterwards, I noticed she had this perfectly organized notebook. Handwriting so neat, it could be printed. I saw that as my golden opportunity. So I leaned in and said, “Hey… are you making a group for this subject? Should we… make one?” Cringe, I know. But she smiled. And that smile kind of just stayed in my head for the rest of the day.

We started texting later that night. First about subjects, then about professors, then about everything. One night we ended up talking for three hours straight without even realizing it. It felt natural. Effortless. Like I didn’t have to think too hard or try to impress her.

Soon enough, it became a routine. Sitting together in class. Sharing lunch sometimes. Walking together to the metro station after lectures. Having long conversations during coffee breaks. Arguing over who’s more last minute with assignments (spoiler: it’s me). Sending each other memes when the lectures got boring. Saving seats for each other during college fests.

It wasn’t a “love at first sight” thing. It was slower. Softer. Real. Somewhere between all those small shared moments, it just became obvious that this was more than just friendship.

One random evening after a class, we were sitting outside the college gate sipping cold coffee. I was talking about some finance thing and she just looked at me and said, “You know, I really like being around you.” I froze for a second. Not because I was surprised — but because I felt the exact same way and didn’t know how to say it back without ruining the moment.

So I just smiled and replied, “Me too. A lot.”

That was it. No proposal. No grand confession. Just mutual understanding in silence.

Now, months later, we still do the same things. Walk after class. Send memes. Laugh at each other’s weird habits. She still steals fries from my plate. I still pretend to be annoyed. And even though we’ve both changed a little with time, that feeling — that comfort — has only grown stronger.

She’s not just my girlfriend. She’s my person. My peace in the chaos. My biggest cheerleader when I doubt myself. The only one who genuinely listens when I rant about things like interest rates or startup valuations.

And I don’t know where life will take us, but I know one thing. The version of me who sat alone on that first day had no idea he was about to meet someone who’d become the most beautiful part of his life.

If you’re reading this and still waiting on your person — trust the timing. Sometimes love doesn’t arrive with fireworks. Sometimes it just quietly sits two benches ahead of you, waiting to change your life.

*January 30, 2025*

Okay so I know the title makes it sound bad, but hear me out. This is a throwaway account. I (28M) have been married to my wife Lindsey (25F) for two years, we’ve been together for 7. Our marriage is great. Despite us both being busy with work, we still make time to go on dates and be intimate with each other whenever we can. I work in engineering and Lindsey is an RN, so I pay for most of the bills and utilities. We “split the bills” but I pay for majority of the costs because I make more. Lindsey usually fully covers grocery costs and the wifi which isn’t much because it’s just the two of us. I feel that since I make and spend more money, Lindsey should make up for that in housework.

I’m not some traditional wife desiring asshole, I think it’s great that she works and has goals for her career, I want her to. I feel like our chores are split fairly. It changes day by day depending on our schedules, but typically, Lindsey cooks our meals (she is much better than me, trust me, you don’t want me anywhere near a kitchen) but it’s nothing fancy or requiring a lot of effort. She does the dishes and vacuums but it’s not daily. It’s more like an “as needed” basis. I take out the trash weekly and wash our cars about once a month. This has always seemed fair to me, but recently I’ve felt frustrated with her.

I’ve been at my current job for 6 years and I’ve developed really great friendships in my time here. There’s a few of us that always get together on break for lunch and whatnot. One of my coworkers, “John” (35M) has been married to his wife “Claire” for about 10 years if my memory serves correctly. About a month ago John invited me and the rest of the gang + our wives to have dinner at their house. Claire is a stay at home mom so she handles everything at home while John works and brings home the bacon. I know this sounds bad, but I was jealous. Not because she’s a stay at home mom, I don’t want kids, but because John has a wife that actually puts effort into her food and cleaning.

Their house was IMMACULATE, completely spotless, no dishes left in the sink, little knick knacks left out on countertops, nothing! I couldn’t believe it. Claire set the table and waited on everyone. She was thoughtful and made sure everyone’s glasses were always full and would ask if she could get us more food, etc. She made filet mignon with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables on the side. It was amazing and I can’t remember the last time Lindsey put any effort into our meals. It’s always something lazy like pasta, a lot of chicken centered meals, tacos, quesadillas, everything requiring little to no effort.

On the drive home, Lindsey made a comment about how Claire is an amazing cook and said she would like to have dinner with them again because they’re great people. I agreed with her and said something along the lines of “you could also be more adventurous with your meal choices so we can eat good at home too.” She took offense to this and said she didn’t realize her food was so bad. I said it wasn’t, but it’s nothing compared to Claire’s because she puts no effort into it. She stopped talking to me and was pouting like a child. She went to bed without speaking to me that night. I ended up apologizing the next day when she got home and she forgave me.

Fast forward a week later and I became more and more frustrated. She was working 12 hour shifts more than usual and as a result, her house work suffered. She would leave at 7am and come home at 7pm, and on some nights she went straight to bed without making dinner. I ended up getting takeout on those nights. Dishes were piling up in the sink, the carpets were becoming noticeably dirty, and she just sat in bed scrolling on her phone or sleeping. I tried to be understanding at first but at this point she’s used to working 12 hour shifts so there really is no excuse.

I ended up having a talk with her and was brutally honest. I told her that I’m not satisfied with her level of house work anymore and I want her to do more. I want her to come home and make dinner and I want her to put more effort into it. I gave her some examples of meals I would like to eat and suggestions for ways that she can clean before going to bed, such as drinking coffee or energy drinks on the way home. I thought she was receptive to my ideas at first but then I realized she looked pissed. She very coldly asked me if I feel this way because of John’s wife and I answered honestly and said yes. I told her I would be embarrassed if my friends came over to have dinner with us after that dinner at John’s.

She started tearing up when I said this and I felt kind of bad for being so harsh. She didn’t say a word to me and just left the room. I came out a short while later and saw her maniacally scrubbing a stain out of the carpet on her hands and knees still crying. I asked her what she was doing and she screamed “WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE!” The stain she was scrubbing was pretty much gone but she continued for what felt like hours.

I started feeling sorry for pushing her to that point but then I remembered something …. something that could work out great for me or go horribly wrong. When she was in high school, she was baker acted (I will not disclose details out of respect) and was in a psych ward. She told me she used to neglect herself when she felt really depressed but after being in the ward, she obsessively cleans when she feels depressed or overwhelmed because of the habits they drilled into her. I almost felt like a DC villain because of the huge smirk that crept on my face.

So, the next night she got home at 7pm. I told her I had something to confess to her and she looked petrified. I told her I was sorry, but I watched porn while she was at work because I was lonely. She ended up throwing up from crying so much but just as I thought, she started cleaning. She washed all the dishes BY HAND instead of using the dishwasher. She dusted everything, every fan, every TV screen, every shelf. I didn’t want it to be too obvious so I started limiting this trick to 4x a week max.

Skip to present day, I made a joke at lunch with my coworkers about how I trained by wife to love cleaning. Everyone was laughing and asked for the secret, so I said “all I have to do is make her cry and she can’t wait to clean!” “Daniel” asked me what I mean, and I told him about how her response to being upset is to clean so I’ve been upsetting her on purpose. Everyone was silent while I was still laughing. “Adam” asked why in a very unamused tone. I spilled the beans about how Claire made me realize how unmotivated my wife is and I wish Lindsey was more like her. The rest of lunch was pretty awkward and I felt like I made everyone uncomfortable.

I ended up texting John to ask if I did something wrong because he didn’t come by my station before leaving like he usually does. He told me he felt really weird about the way I was treating my wife and idealizing his. He told me I was being an asshole and “emotionally abusing her” when I should just communicate. I argued against this because I DID communicate. I told her exactly what I wanted from her and all she did was make excuses about being tired from work and needing sleep. She even suggested that I should clean more if the state of the house bothers me so much and that I should learn how to cook before criticizing her.

We wouldn’t be able to afford the house we live in if it weren’t for me. The lifestyle we live is because of ME so why can’t she just show appreciation by cleaning and cooking better meals??? It’s been three days now and I am now sitting alone at lunch. When I sit with my usual group everyone stops talking. I feel like I really fucked up and want to make things right with my friends, but at the same time I feel like what I’m doing is okay because it’s not for no reason. She’s actually cleaning more and I’m so proud of her. Am I the asshole because I want to keep doing it?

Edit: I understand that I'm the asshole now and no, this is not fake. Sorry to bring deprive you of that comfort. It's impossible not to recognize something is wrong with you when a good 80% of the comments are calling it fake or hoping it is. I understand now that I mentally abused my wife and I do want to fix it. Thank you to the two people who actually took the time to offer constructive feedback and advice. As much as I hate the thought I am going to seek out a professional. It isn't possible for everyone to be wrong and I'm right, even though that's what my brain is telling me. I know something is wrong with me even though my brain is saying there isn't. Thank you all for helping me realize it. As per request, I will update in the future if there are any changes.

You can argue I’m worsening her mental health with this but my counter argument is that I make it up to her. I’ve been spoiling her recently more than ever and she doesn’t even bring up the things I’ve said/done. She is very much a “what’s done is done and all I can do is move on” kinda lady so I don’t think this will affect our marriage even if she does find out what I’m doing.

- 

Mental abuse I can see but physical?????????????????? You people really just say anything. I have never put my hands on ANY woman and I would never hurt my wife. That’s disgusting.

I’m not that dense, I know she can’t do as much as Claire and that that’s all Claire does. I know she isn’t able to do as much or have as much time to prep meals but still… she could do so much more. She doesn’t work 12 hours everyday, it’s just been more often the past few weeks. And I hate to say it but she really hasn’t worked as hard as me because she would be a lot further in her career if she did. Your reaction to my post does concern me though. I’m not really open to getting therapy, I’m not comfortable with talking to someone like that. Maybe I am wrong in this. I appreciate your insight.

- 

I don’t believe in karma but if it were real I’m sure there’d be consequences for me. I don’t know why you’re calling me obtuse though. After reading my post again it does make me sound pretty bad but I know I’m not a bad guy. Maybe I fucked up with this one though.

- 

Sorry to disappoint you and many others but no this is not a joke or “rage bait.” I’m not clueless or stupid. I know that what I’m doing is morally wrong if you look at it in black and white but what about the gray area?? The gray area being her not being willing to step up at least a little bit more and me finding a way around that. I don’t say anything that’s too far, honestly the worst thing I’ve said was the porn because it hurt her the most, but it’s not like I’m dropping life altering nukes on her mental state.

- 

I’ll admit, I don’t know a lot about trauma and mental health. That is something I need to learn more about. I honestly have always viewed myself as a loving and supportive husband but now I’m questioning everything. I don’t know why my first reaction to her obsessive cleaning was to use this against her and not comfort her. I truly do believe I put a lot of effort into making her feel loved but I’ll try to do better. I’m not attracted to Claire and I never cared this much about the state of our house but for some reason I felt less than after that dinner and like I should be embarrassed of my wife. As I’m typing this I’m realizing so much. I think I am the AH in this situation. I didn’t equate her effort in housework with feeling valued, but that’s something I can try. I don’t know how I could help with the house besides what I already do but I will ask her. The thought of washing dishes disgusts me to the point where I feel ill. I like the idea of us working together though.

- 

Is my post seriously that bad that nearly everyone is asking if this is fake??? Like seriously. I have seen some pretty crazy stories on here and mine is nowhere NEAR the levels of depravity I’ve seen.

- 

*[somebody says if one partner makes 60% more than the other, they should pay more bills]* I never really thought about it that way, as far as the bills go yes and that’s why I pay more, but that’s exactly why I felt like she should do a bit more than me because of how much I had to work to get to this point. You all make me feel like a fucking animal for saying this is fake. There is absolutely no way this is that bad. I’m not narcissistic either but thanks for the internet diagnosis😂

- 

My coworkers reaction is what made me question if I was wrong for doing this in the first place so I 100% did take it into consideration. It’s hard for me to equate this to the crazy ass stories I’ve seen about literal physical abuse, cheating with family members, even stories about p*dophilis. There’s just no way. 

- 

“You're only questioning your shitty behaviour because your colleagues called you out on it.” Well well if it isn’t captain obvious here to save the day! Is that not what this subreddit is for? Someone being called out for something and then wondering if they were wrong for it? Obviously I wouldn’t have done this if I thought it was abuse. I clearly have a very different view on what abuse is from everyone else and that’s something I will look into. Anyways, the house isn’t a mess to the point where I need to hire someone. That would just be a waste. I’ve been thinking about this a lot and honestly I should step up more. I was never dissatisfied with her performance before that dinner with John and Claire. I’m realizing now it was never about my wife. It was me feeling inadequate for some reason like my wife and home aren’t worth bragging about. I understand now that I have some shit to work through and I need to learn what it actually means to love someone and not just what they provide for you. I have always viewed value as achievements and skills so I guess my wife’s value diminished in my eyes when I realized others are doing more, and my own value decreased because I don’t have the life John does at home.

- 

I think you might be misunderstanding what I said. I said “like that” as in being vulnerable and telling some stranger my deepest darkest secrets. Online it’s different because you don’t know me, your opinions of my character don’t matter and it won’t affect me. The thought of therapy just makes me physically cringe. I’m not the emotional type and don’t need to cope with anything, I have no trauma and therefore therapy would be a waste. I’m not afraid of a professional “calling me out” … it’s just not something I’m interested in. It’s not out of fear, I really don’t care if a “professional” “calls me out” so long as they tell me how to do better. I’m not trying to deflect or be defensive, but it’s hard not to be when people are commenting stupidity about this being fake instead of actually offering advice/constructive criticism (minus a few).  Of course I’m open to me being wrong and after talking with some users I do think I’m in the wrong. I’m still coming to terms with it mentally and trying to understand. I have a lot to learn about myself and why I was proud of this. My coworkers have been so cold to me and the comments are just reinforcing that feeling. It seriously feels like my world is crumbling. My reality is clearly very different from the real world if EVERYONE thinks what I did is insane to the point where it’s unbelievable. 

- 

That’s very interesting actually. I’ll admit I’m ignorant when it comes to mental health and trauma stuff because it’s never affected me. Even though just imagining it makes me uncomfortable, I think I should open my mind to a therapist for my wife’s sake. I feel so fucking disgusting and you were right in your other comment saying I was being defensive. I can never accept when I’m wrong and everything I do is always right. I feel like a fraud of a husband and I’m not the man she married. I don’t know what’s happened to me but I really do want to be better. I seriously don’t know what to do with this because I was PROUD of what I did. I thought I was clever. I had no empathy or pity for her. I didn’t think I was actually hurting her. I know that sounds stupid but that’s how it was to me. The more I type and think the more I realize I do need help, something is not right with me.

- 

I’m not misogynistic at all. I don’t think women need to cook and clean and sit at home while the man goes to work and provides financially. I don’t want her to put more effort into her meals + cleaning because she’s a WOMAN, it is solely based on financial input. Reddit users love saying divorce divorce… that’s why marriages don’t last these days. Instead of actually working through problems people would rather run away. And what do you mean nurses are sought after??? Why?

># [Update](https://np.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1l35167/update_aita_for_upsetting_my_wife_so_shell_clean/)
*June 4, 2025, 4 months later*

So, hi. It's been a while. I don't have a lot to say, but I was asked to update if I ever decided to try therapy and I did. I didn't like it. I dropped out of individual therapy after two sessions (my therapist was more interested in my childhood than giving me actual advice) but stuck with couples therapy. I tried, I really did. The therapist and my ""wife"" would gang up on me. The therapist changed my wife a lot. She went from being kind and soft spoken to rude and brazen. She would snap on me for absolutely nothing and constantly bring up things I've done in the past to use against me in an argument to try and make me submit.

Remember how my ""wife"" is an RN? Yeah, well she was fucking cheating on me with some ugly c*nt working the same shifts as her. She confessed to that in therapy and said if I could forgive her she could forgive ""all the things I've done."" NOTHING I have ever done has been close to this. I HAVE NEVER CHEATED. VOWS MEAN NOTHING APPARENTLY.... she also shared a lot of things she never told me, like her last grandparent passing away. In her words, ""he wouldn't care."" Yes I would have if she told me. She had no reason not to. I wouldn't have been so harsh about the housework if I knew she was grieving, but no, go ahead please, don't tell me anything and then use it against me later because THAT makes sense.

I thought couple therapists were supposed to be neatural. Isn't their entire purpose bringing couples together and helping them understand each other? Since when do they call their clients manipulative? How is that allowed? Anyways, back to the b*tch ""wife,"" I can't forgive a cheater. She is staying with her parents for now as we are separated. I don't want her back in my house. It makes sense now why she didn't want to have sex anymore. We stopped going on dates. Our intimacy suffered. All because she cheated. Therapy was a waste of time and money, but I guess it was worth it in the end because I learned what kind of person she really is. She disgusts me. I did NOT want therapy but I tried my best for her and to change. That is clearly not what she wanted because she cheated. I learned this information last month and I have finally come to terms with it.

As for my ""friends,"" I'm still cool with a few of them, others clearly look down on me so I don't interact with them anymore, but we don't eat lunch together anymore. I sit elsewhere now and it's not too bad honestly. I'm meeting new people. Maybe I'll find love again soon but who knows. My reputation at work in regards to personal matters is kind of shit now.

Well, that's really it. Thank you for reading.

I've been feeling this burst of unexpected joy lately, and it's all thanks to the tiniest things. You ever notice how, like, the breeze on a warm day can make everything feel alright?

I know, it sounds kinda cheesy, but appreciating these small joys has given me this sense of hope I didn't expect. It's like, amidst all the chaos that's thrown our way, these tiny sparks are like whispers reminding us that there's beauty all around if we just take a moment to see it.

Anyway, I don't know who needs to hear this, but I hope you find those little joys today. Maybe it'll make everything feel a bit lighter.

Immediately, I kicked into scientist mode and began what I call a somatic analysis. 

First, the physical evidence of contentment: a gentle warming in the chest area, centering just above the left atrium, intensity at a solid 4.7 out of 10. Accompanied by slight tingling radiating toward the mid-abdominal region. Duration? Approximately seven minutes, thirty-four seconds, with a gradual fade-off. The tingling intensity reaches its crescendo at around the two-minute mark, noted decrease post the sixth minute correlating with cooling coffee temperature. Fascinating, right?

Noteworthy too is the minor facial muscle relaxation contributing to a subtle smile effect, coupled with a 1.3-degree Fahrenheit increase in skin temperature on the upper lip—surely measurable if I wasn’t too lazy to find the thermometer.

Mentally, I tracked a brief lessening of cognitive chatter, sometimes described as the 'mental white noise,' which dipped noticeably from a typical baseline chaos level of 6.3 to a serene 2.1, based on my personal algorithm. 

I hypothesize this contentment surge correlates strongly with the ambient noise reduction to decibel levels comparable to distant, comforting whispers (difficult to measure sans digital equipment, so an estimate at best). 

Final thoughts: It’s intriguing how unpredictable these fleeting yet thoroughly enjoyable moments of well-being are. They appear like cameo appearances in an otherwise scheduled broadcast... Guess I’ll need a bigger lifelogger-thingy for more precise analysis next time. 😅",3,1749114260.0,feelingsUnderMicrosco,0,1.0,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress - it strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way, while not being totally lost to them.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is inscribed onto one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavors.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ, Type 5, score very high in openness and conscientiousness, and am a Virgo.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1749114123.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1l3ufy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenIndia/comments/1l3ufy0/how_i_met_my_girl/,How I met my girl,"It was my first week of college. New campus, new people, same old social anxiety. I remember walking into the orientation hall, pretending like I wasn’t nervous, like I belonged. But deep down, I felt like a complete outsider. Everyone was smiling, laughing, already making groups, following each other on Instagram. I just sat on a random bench and hoped the day would pass quickly.

Then she walked in.

She didn’t do anything dramatic. No twirling hair, no slow motion. But for some reason, she caught my eye. She looked confident but not loud. Calm. She walked past me and sat two benches ahead. And for the rest of that session, my attention was anywhere but the orientation speech.

Afterwards, I noticed she had this perfectly organized notebook. Handwriting so neat, it could be printed. I saw that as my golden opportunity. So I leaned in and said, “Hey… are you making a group for this subject? Should we… make one?” Cringe, I know. But she smiled. And that smile kind of just stayed in my head for the rest of the day.

We started texting later that night. First about subjects, then about professors, then about everything. One night we ended up talking for three hours straight without even realizing it. It felt natural. Effortless. Like I didn’t have to think too hard or try to impress her.

Soon enough, it became a routine. Sitting together in class. Sharing lunch sometimes. Walking together to the metro station after lectures. Having long conversations during coffee breaks. Arguing over who’s more last minute with assignments (spoiler: it’s me). Sending each other memes when the lectures got boring. Saving seats for each other during college fests.

It wasn’t a “love at first sight” thing. It was slower. Softer. Real. Somewhere between all those small shared moments, it just became obvious that this was more than just friendship.

One random evening after a class, we were sitting outside the college gate sipping cold coffee. I was talking about some finance thing and she just looked at me and said, “You know, I really like being around you.” I froze for a second. Not because I was surprised — but because I felt the exact same way and didn’t know how to say it back without ruining the moment.

So I just smiled and replied, “Me too. A lot.”

That was it. No proposal. No grand confession. Just mutual understanding in silence.

Now, months later, we still do the same things. Walk after class. Send memes. Laugh at each other’s weird habits. She still steals fries from my plate. I still pretend to be annoyed. And even though we’ve both changed a little with time, that feeling, that comfort, has only grown stronger.

She’s not just my girlfriend. She’s my person. My peace in the chaos. My biggest cheerleader when I doubt myself. The only one who genuinely listens when I rant about things like interest rates or startup valuations.

And I don’t know where life will take us, but I know one thing. The version of me who sat alone on that first day had no idea he was about to meet someone who’d become the most beautiful part of his life.

If you’re reading this and still waiting on your person — trust the timing. Sometimes love doesn’t arrive with fireworks. Sometimes it just quietly sits two benches ahead of you, waiting to change your life.

1l3ubxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belgrade/comments/1l3ubxr/speed_dating_singles_night_events_improving/,Speed Dating / Singles Night  events — improving organization,"I was organizing several Speed Dating events in Belgrade and realized that few recurring issues. We used local organization that promotes this kind of activities and we provided space.

What I didn’t like is that participation fees are different for ladies and for guys. Ladies payed 500 rsd , while guys 1000. Lower price  in theory encouraged ladies to apply - but in reality it just gave them excuse not to show up, and created disproportion in male/female ratio.

Same people repeatedly come to the events. I understand that there is nothing worse than having event with low response rate, but if same people keep coming the whole event just looses the point.

Organizers didn’t try to encourage conversation, create the vibe or relax the participants. Basically they just put them in the room and instructed them to talk for 5 min. 

Age groups - event tho there is a reason for this, turned out that basically a lot  lied about their age to enter younger groups. Which is sad because there are senior members that just never get opportunity to socialize.

And yes, Guys are the problem. Even tho a lot of them will show up to this kind of events, for very few you can say they actually have a chance or will be interesting to the ladies. They usually group-up and just get wasted.  

These are just some of observations from many but I understand that we should not be looking for specific but  to understand general dynamics. 

At the moment I feel most events finished with bitter taste for everyone. Organizers for making money out of false hopes for love, venue owners for provision services to people who probably didn’t even feel the space and would probably not come back because it’s branded as the crime scene and participants which will just have less hope. 

One interesting thing is that we organized LGBT night and it was totally different experience. People were communicating, they were staying longer after the event, they actually checked the menu and ordered different things than Coca-Colas and coffees and they actually came back with friends very next day. 

I think there is potential for this kind of events. But it just need better base and to put participants in the first place. 

For this reason I am sure that this kind of events should not organized by third party but the bars themselves. Mostly because staff already knows the regulars, their needs and can actually help connecting and loosening the tension. 

What would be the perfect event for you guys? 
How should it be promoted and organized so everyone is at their best game that evening?

I would appreciate if you would put your gender and general age before your answers.

1l3uaoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TarotDeMarseille/comments/1l3uaoz/what_features_should_the_ideal_deck_have/,What features should the ideal deck have?,"I yearn for the day I can finally sit down and draw my own cards. Some music, decent watercolors, coffee. Til then, in your experience what fearures should the ideal deck have?

These are mine:

FORM

* It should be small. Playing cards size seems ideal, so it fits perfectly on your hand and you can carry it on your pocket. Very important if you rely on big spreads like tableaux and have limited table space. 
* Clear hierarchic difference between minors and triumphs. They should pull your attention at first glance in a sea of pips. For this I'm thinking on thicker black borders for the triumphs, or make the pips just lineart. 
* No ornamentation. No numbers. No names. 
* Within their suit, all symbols should be the same size. For example, the cups on the 2 and 10, should be all equal in size. This way the lower cards feel emptier and reinforces the feeling of accumulation in the higher numbers. 
* Close to the previous one, more negative space. Not all spaces inside the card have to be filled! More negative space in the minors makes the triumphs stand out, relaxes the vision,  therefore the mind, and gives more clarity to the composition.
* I'm tempted to say triumphs with border & borderless minors but that's not really an issue. Is it?
* Consistent and coherent color palette. If all the cards look the same it will be very frustrating, and if they are all different they will make a lot of mental noise.
* Round corners. 
* Simple & clear illustrations! Oh my god, how on earth was I forgetting this. Each card should be simple, easy to read and see in yuxtaposition to its neighbors. No excesive saturation, details or stuff going on that can distract from the allegory/symbols at play or make it harder to grasp as a whole. 
* No pure white background. Something smooth like cream or ivory. Maybe a subtle pattern or pastel color. 

SUBSTANCE

* As a faithful believer of the italian tradition, the original allegories must be preserved. I won't go one by one but I will detail the most significant changes:

➛ As Old Father Time, Hermit must regain his hourglass, crutches and wings.  
➛ Love instead of the Lover. One single couple blessed by Cupid.   
➛ Hanged Man as the Traitor, once again with his bags of money.   
➛ A good Wheel of Fortune for god's sake. 4 characters, donkey on top.  
➛ Half naked Fool. Clearly different from triumphs, court and minors.   
➛ Death's scythe pointing to the left.  
➛ World character on top of the globe. 

* Star, Moon and Sun should be by themselves the focus of the card, not the little scene. For that matter, Star should have either ships following the north star or the three wise men instead of aquarius. Moon should have the astronomers instead of cancer. And Sun should have either Diogenes and Alexander or the merry couple instead of gemini. 
* The 4 aces must stand out from the rest of the minors without competing with the triumphs and must all wear crowns.
* If possible, straight swords crisscrossed with each other. ",1,1749113420.0,TarotDeMarseille,0,1.0,False

But I do feel somewhat betrayed by a very close friend.

This girl has been my roommate for the last four years and has become a very close friend during that time. I'm talkin' daily hangouts, trusted conversations, emotional closeness, and tons of memories without any physical or romantic expectations between either of us. We really got to know each other and built an amazing foundation of trust and friendship.

But then one day, I noticed feelings peek through. The feelings felt so real and vibrant because they were backed by years of appreciation with zero expectations. I realized we were perfect for each other. I started to gradually flirt. She seemed caught off guard at first but began to respond well to my vibe with charged looks, playful vibes, and still daily hangouts. It felt real and powerful but still subtle because she was in a 3 year relationship at the time that was falling apart.

TRIGGER WARNING

A quick history of her past relationships:

1. Her first boyfriend cheated on her mercilessly and beat her
2. Her second boyfriend raped her
3. Her third (and latest) boyfriend yelled at her and cheated on her

Once the latest relationship finally ended (about 1 month ago) I was there for her, waiting for the right moment to share my feelings once she had time to heal. When the time came for me to share my feelings, we met in my room. I waited nervously, sitting on my bed, waiting for her to finish cooking and join me.

I have nothing but the best intentions for her, backed by our years of devoted friendship. We knew everything about each other and clicked on so many levels, spending every single day together, we were essentially best friends, and she was always drawn to me more than anyone else (delivering me coffee many mornings and even lying in my bed. I would literally do anything for this girl, and I love everything about her because I got to know her in the purest way possible. It seemed like the ideal gateway to an incredibly fruitful romance. I also would never hurt her in any way like the other guys did (no cheating, no abuse), just endless love, respect, and appreciation. We even have similar goals, marriage, kids, and moving to Japan - all of which I was prepared to do with her. Everything pointed to a beautiful, budding romance forged in the best way possible.

I finally told her everything and how much I cared about her. And she said...""Oh... I've never had any romantic feelings for you. What you sensed must have been comfort and platonic care.""

I think I'm more confused than crushed. I was prepared to offer everything to this girl. I kept my door open to her for years through the good and bad with no physical expectations. I would keep her safe with absolutely no risk of cheating or abuse. Years of her being drawn to me with charged looks, emotional closeness, and an incredibly strong connection seemed to vanish with her words. Her simply saying ""I've never had any romantic feelings for you"" just felt so...wrong.

In the past, she told me she suffers from disorganized attachment from a traumatic childhood, and bolstered by her terrible string of boyfriends. She has been in therapy for years. I wanted to be her way out of bad relationships by being pure and sweet to her through and through.

But she shut me down last night and didn't speak to me at all today. We were all in the process of looking for a new apartment to live in (me, her, and our two other roommates), but now I thought twice about moving with her. Today our other roommate told me she was informed about my love confession and that I would most likely be staying behind while they moved out. I think she told all roommates about my confession just the following day after it was expressed. Why? Is she shaming me? Is that how she processes? It didn't make me feel good. She shut me down, told our roommates about it like gossip, and is okay leaving me behind after this long, deep friendship. It just sucks.

Is she being callous? Is she being avoidant? Is she being a bitch? Is she being an idiot? Am I a loser? Should I smoke another bowl?

This is a long story and I appreciate anyone who got to the end. I wish life made a little more sense. Just a little...",2,1749113212.0,venting,1,1.0,False

1l3u3ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_wilderdogharness/comments/1l3u3ki/can_sniffer_dogs_smell_sealed_cigarettes_the/,Can Sniffer Dogs Smell Sealed Cigarettes? The Unfiltered Truth in 2025,"**You bury that shrink-wrapped cigarette pack beneath layers of clothes, convinced the airtight seal makes it undetectable. But as the beagle's wet nose pauses millimeters from your luggage, tail wagging with sudden intensity, cold reality hits:** ***Can sniffer dogs really smell through sealed barriers?*** **The answer isn't just yes—it's a resounding scientific certainty that's revolutionized tobacco enforcement.**

# Why This Matters Now

* **£1.3 billion** in illicit tobacco seized globally in 2024 (Interpol)
* **72% spike** in vape-detection K9 units since 2022
* **Counterfeit cigarettes** now contain 300% more toxins than regulated products (WHO 2025)

# 1. The Olfactory Marvel: How Dogs Defy Sealed Packaging

Dogs don't just *smell* cigarettes—they dissect molecular histories. When tobacco is sealed, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inevitably escape through microscopic packaging flaws. These molecules adhere to surfaces like invisible fingerprints.

**Key 2025 Research Findings:**

* A Springer Spaniel's nose detects **0.001 grams** of tobacco odor—equivalent to 1 grain of sand in an Olympic pool (Cambridge Sensory Lab)
* Dogs identify ""odor signatures"" rather than specific scents, recognizing tobacco compounds like **nicotine, acetaldehyde, and nitrosamines** through multiple barriers

# 2. Anatomy of a Super Sniffer: Biological Advantages

# 2.1 Scent Receptor Dominance

|Species|Scent Receptors|Scent Discrimination|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Humans|6 million|1:1,000 molecules|
|Bloodhounds|300 million|1:100,000 molecules|
|German Shepherds|225 million|1:10,000 molecules|

*Source: Max Planck Institute 2024*

The **vomeronasal organ** allows dogs to ""taste-smell"" airborne chemicals, while **bidirectional breathing** creates scent vortexes humans can't replicate.

# 3. Real-World Takedowns: 2024-2025 Case Studies

# 3.1 The Manchester Container Heist

* **6 million cigarettes** sealed in vacuum-packed coffee bags
* Detection dog ""Buster"" alerted within 12 seconds of container inspection
* Perpetrators used **triple-layer plastic, activated charcoal, and coffee grounds**

# 3.2 Sydney Airport Vape Sting

* **Disposable vapes** sealed in fragrance-soaked mylar bags
* Beagle ""Narla"" detected nicotine salts through perfume masking agents
* 8,400 vapes confiscated (Jan 2025)

# 4. Training Revolution: The 2025 Intermixed Method

Gone are single-odor training days. Modern K9 units use:

**The 3-Phase System:**

1. **Foundation (6 months):** Puppies rewarded for identifying tobacco amid food/toys
2. **Distraction Conditioning (4 months):** Target scents hidden with strong odors (perfume, fuel, decay)
3. **Environmental Generalization (6 months):** Searches in moving vehicles, crowded ports, underwater

*2025 Success Rate:* 94% accuracy vs. 68% in 2020 (K9 Global Journal)

# 5. Packaging vs. Canine: Why Seals Fail

# 5.1 Permeation Science

* **Plastic wraps:** VOC migration in 72 hours (even unopened)
* **Glass jars:** 0.01mm microfractures release odor
* **Vacuum sealing:** Residual molecules on exterior surfaces

**Myth Busting:**

* Freezing cigarettes *increases* VOC release upon thawing
* Coffee grounds add complexity but don't mask nicotine signatures

# 6. Tobacco Detection Breeds Ranked (2025)

|Breed|Success Rate|Speed|Distraction Resistance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Springer Spaniel|98%|9.2s avg|Excellent|
|Belgian Malinois|95%|8.7s avg|Good|
|Beagle|93%|11.3s avg|Fair|
|Labrador|89%|14.6s avg|Poor|

*Data: Global Tobacco K9 Units Annual Report*

# 7. Emerging Threats: Vapes and Synthetic Nicotine

* **2025 Challenge:** Salt-based nicotine in disposables emits 60% fewer VOCs
* **Solution:** Dogs now trained on **TFN (tobacco-free nicotine)** biomarkers
* **US Customs Case:** ""Duke"" detected 20,000 synthetic-nicotine vapes sealed in fish oil capsules (Miami Port, Mar 2025)

# 8. Ethical Frontiers: Welfare vs. Enforcement

# 8.1 Health Risks

* 34% of tobacco-detection dogs show **cotinine (nicotine metabolite) in bloodwork**
* Counterfeit tobacco exposure linked to **canine respiratory issues**

# 8.2 Handler Bias Controversy

* **Clever Hans Effect:** 12% false alerts when handlers anticipate finds
* **Mitigation:** Double-blind trials now mandatory in EU units

# 9. The 2030 Outlook: AI-Assisted K9 Units

* **Smart Harnesses:** Monitor heart rate variability and sniff frequency to predict finds
* **Neural Implants:** Early trials for direct odor-to-handler data transmission
* **Drone Teams:** Dogs directing UAVs to inaccessible stashes

# 11. Consumer Implications: Travelers Beware

* **78 countries** now deploy tobacco-sniffing dogs at borders
* **Legal Risk:** Carrying sealed tax-free cigarettes may incur 400% duty fines
* **Pro Tip:** Residual odor on clothes triggers alerts 72+ hours after contact

# 12. Beyond Tobacco: The Scent Detection Universe

Dogs now identify:

* **Digital Storage:** Hard drives emit **ozone and triphenylphosphine oxide**
* **COVID Variants:** 92% accuracy on Delta/Omicron detection (Lancet 2024)
* **Cybercurrency:** USBs release distinct **phthalate signatures**",1,1749112556.0,u_wilderdogharness,0,1.0,False
1l3u2zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1l3u2zi/beginner_machine_delonghi_vs_bambino_150500/,Beginner machine: Delonghi vs Bambino [€150-€500],"Hi! As a little background, I'm currently using a Nespresso machine and whenever I have time I'm experimenting with an Aeropress and ""freshly"" grounding store bought beans with Hario Mini Mill. I also have a standalone frother for cappuccinos. For a while now I read more and more about espresso and I'm feeling like the more I read the more lost I am. There are common agreements, like the most important thing is the freshly roasted coffee beans, then the grinder and finally the machine itself. I plan to buy a Kingrinder K6 instead of the Hario, it should do the job for espresso as well and would be a great improvement over the Hario based on what I read.

But for the machine I can't decide. Multiple posts and videos say that the Delonghi ECP3420 (or 35.31 here) would suffice as a beginner machine if I change the portafilter and it does a great job. But when compared to the Stilosa supposedly it's just the build quality what is different, so I could even make good espresso with that one. On the other hand lot of people say that Bambino / Plus is the best entry level machine and shouldn't go any lower. But I would have to change the portafilter for Bambino too anyway.

So if I don't mind the solenoid valve, easier or even auto milk frothing, letting the machine warm up instead of a thermojet, is there really a €200-250 difference between the two? My reasoning for the cheaper one is that if I can learn on a Delonghi and could get the same result as on a Bambino, then later when I decide that it's time to upgrade then the initial investment would be lower. But if the Bambino is really that better then I would just go with that one.

And if the Delonghi could be ok, is the Stilosa enough or the ECP3420 is way more better/recommended? Obviously with a proper portafilter. Those who had both machines, did you manage to pull better shots on the Bambino? Thanks!",2,1749112489.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1l3u2mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pune/comments/1l3u2mw/im_tracking_open_positions_at_pune_startups/,I'm tracking open positions at Pune startups,"Hello r/Pune

I've been running a startup-founders initiative called Pune OpenCoffee Club (POCC) as a give-back for almost 18 years now. I've also been helping some of my colleagues track open positions at startups, this initiative has now transformed into a no-fuss job-board.

The job-board has already helped uncover internships, fresher-friendly positions at several Pune startups such as EMotorad, Myelin, TravelXAI and more. I'm here because I do want to share it with others from Pune. My hope is that it will be helpful to those aspiring to work at a startup, and will surely help startup founders raise their own visibility. I do understand that the rules prohibit me from sharing a link directly (only with permission from the mods). So if you were to DM me, I'll share the URL back.

A feature I've added sends out free alerts on telegram using a telegram bot called PuneOCCbot. It alerts you every time a job post is discovered. I'd really be grateful for feedback on this and more.

EDIT: just in case this is not clear, it's a not-for-profit initiative.

I had been there the two previous days without any issues, but this time, as I went through the main entrance, the security guard signaled to me to stop, and he said, ""authenticity!""
I stopped and went, ""what?"", and he repeated, while standing in front of me, ""authenticity!""
I started opening my bag to get my passport thinking he wanted to ID me or something - as a first timer it was perfectly possible I did not know about this kind of random check at the mall.
""You need to.. see my passport or..?"" I asked confused. The security guy looked really tired, grabbed my arm and pointed to the door, repeating, ""authenticity!""
I must have looked like a dumb tourist, and I admit I felt like it too, but then I saw the writing on the window, and it finally dawned on me. It said ""Open 10:30"". The time was 10:20.
I had misheard him completely as, with an accent, he had tried to tell me that they ""authenticity... Authententhirty.. Opententhirty.. Open ten thirty""

Up until now I've been using Aeropress with the OG Baratza Encore grinder with stock M3 burrs. 

After doing some research for the last couple of days, I realize that the grinder is not suited for espresso because of lack of precise adjustments but getting a new one will have to wait since I I'm only getting into the hobby and the Bambino was expensive enough.

Still, I wanted to ask what can I expect with that starter setup. What I can do is the 3D printed 80-step mod and probably stick to the stock pressurized basket to compensate for grinder issues for now. I can't find M2 burrs in Europe anywhere so that's not an option either.

Day 14 after iui.... waking up, birds singing sun shines through the bedroom windown. My other half grinding up the coffee for us both to spend the day working from home together... some of my favourite days... but it looms over me, today is day 14 after iui... the anxiety and hope has been building to this day... i want to take a test so my hubby doesnt know, surprise him with a silly tshirt ive been looking at for year to finally tell him, youre gonna be a dad.... 

I open the clear blue, i close my eyes and just hope, hope for a single second my body did the thing and there is a tiny little egg getting nested inside making me its mum... I wait.. A minute passes....another minute...and another... my hands shake as I'm afraid to look.. but i do ... a wave of dread... my heart sinks.. my stomach churns and clear blue tells me not pregnant... another month and another failure, I feel a failure...all that hope i had less than 5 minutes ago disappears into a blue control line and emptiness....

I sit on the edge of the bed, devastated... breaking under the unexplained reasonings and finding fault in myself and all the things I could have done better or different this month... 

My perfectly handsome hubby with smile on face comes with the coffee, fresh hot and carefully prepared ... finding a worn out troll, who so desperately needs a haircut at the very least a brush !! Crying on the edge of the bed... cigarette in hand ready to go hide under a bridge for a few days .. he puts the cigarette aside holds me and like he knows already just says its ok love, it's gonna be ok. 

We sit down for a chat, he reassures me, I tell him my fears and he tells me his, we decide we need a break this month.. allowing our body and minds to heal and understand the disappointment.

We decide to get to started with work for the day... focus on the stuff we can control... by this stage the coffee was drank fast, the loo awaits me.... and well when I get there seems like my period was also waiting for me... like she knew - hey now you have your main disappointment I may as well throw myself into the mix, ya know spice up the pity party... so here we are... 

Cigarette in hand again... booking hot yoga and trying to find a reasonably priced hairdresser in amsterdam to help me feel better...although I admit me getting pregnant is a higher chance than finding a reasonably priced hairdresser... well a girl can hope!

It's kinda based on the psychology principle of 'activation energy', which sounds fancy but hear me out. The idea is that starting something is usually the hardest part, right? 

I decided to make this easy by prepping everything the night before. I mean everything—from setting out clothes to pre-measuring coffee grounds. It sounds so simple, but starting the day without decisions to make right off the bat saves so much mental energy, tbh. That way, I can dive straight into tackling my to-do list (and actually cross things off it!). 

I thought it might be a silly little thing, but it's made my mornings run smoother and my days more productive. Anyone else try something like this?",4,1749111845.0,mindHacksToday,0,1.0,False
1l3tx8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/1l3tx8e/trying_young/,Trying young,"My husband and I are both finishing up school, stable in our relationship and finances, live with his family who’s a great support system while we continue saving for a house, but I can’t help but feel seen as foolish for us being 25 and us taking this step. We’re wonderful pet parents and I think he would make the most loving and amazing father but obviously there’s a mountain of concerns that comes with bringing a new life into this world. I grew up always struggling with money with a neglectful single mother despite having me later in life at 35, so I have a huge fear of not being able to provide properly, but at the same time we are in much better position and are much more capable individuals than my parents. 

I worry sometimes not having met all the traditional milestones beforehand, like owning our home and having careers established first, despite knowing that his family will actually be extremely valuable and supportive during this time when most people are struggling alone trying to take care of a new baby, a home, and themselves. He makes good money at his current job and receives military benefits from when they took advantage of his youth and naivety lol, so we’ll be solid providers, and much more so than our own parents were, yet I still feel slightly ashamed for not being more established as a full “adult” before doing something so monumental. He often teases me that his mom had him at 16 as well as a couple other aunts and cousins so if anything to his family this is as responsible as it gets. On top of that, both of my parents also had me constantly moving out of their own mothers’ homes. We are both very driven, very motivated, fun, loving, responsible people, and it just feels right despite my head bickering about space for the crib and cutting back on coffee. 

I would love to hear from others in the same boat, that either are trying/had young or are depending on outside support systems for the first stage. Is it foolish? Or is this just the new normal now that the white picket fences previous generations had are no longer as easily obtainable?",1,1749111775.0,TryingForABaby,4,1.0,False

Of course, that comes with a lot of ""you'll change your mind later"" ""how selfish"" reactions - but l've learned to just laugh at them.

A couple of weeks ago my boyfriend's half-brother became a father, so we visited them. My bf was so amazed with the baby-girl and wanted to hold her, he had a ""normal"" reaction to seeing a baby. Meanwhile me, while i found her cute and very endearing I also wasn't really interested in the baby. I didn't want to hold her or baby her.

A couple of days ago, my sister was in town visiting her best friend and we went out for a coffee. Her friend brought her three kids with her and my mood just plummeted. I wasn't at all interested in getting a coffee suddenly. In my mind, the kids were just a burden and you couldn't really talk about a lot of things in front of them. If I found a child in distress, like one time at work, l'd of course do anything in my power to help no questions asked.

So now i found out that my sister is pregnant and while I'm EXTREMELY happy for her, I'm scared I might not be the warm, fun aunt I want to be. Like I just feel weird, given how everyone around me is so amazed with babies and l'm just like ""awh cute, okay enough""

1l3twz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1l3twz7/i_cant_be_moderate_in_anything_i_live_at_extremes/,I can't be moderate in anything. I live at extremes.,"Tl;dr I'm an intense person. On most occasions, my decisions have obliged me to behave as strictly as possible, and I feel somewhat like I've developed this decision-making system as a strategy to avoid people's condemnation. I think it has become my defense mechanism and, at the same time, a way of punishing myself after making even the tiniest mistake.


**I don't want to admit it, but I have to face this issue right away. I apologize if, through this post, I sound like a selfish prick whom everybody is terrified to talk to. I just want to know if there are other people like me.**


I'm not sure whether it's a good or bad trait, but I can barely stay in the middle and mostly live at the extremes. Hopefully, I won't get too deep into it, but let me explain how it feels.


I either don't do something, or I pour all my energy into doing it. I either don't make friends with someone, or I form such a strong emotional bond that removing that person from my life feels almost impossible. Though I'm not sure how useful or damaging this attitude might be, I have to admit that it has had its pros and cons so far.


Let me give you a real-life example. I had been drinking coffee for almost five years. Week by week, my caffeine intake increased to the point where I ended up drinking 2-3 double espresso shots a day. Then, a few weeks ago, before going to bed, my father told me to wake him up at 4 a.m. the next morning, and I said okay. That night, I couldn't sleep until 1:30 a.m., and there's no need to mention that it was because of the double espresso I drank at 7 p.m. As a result, the next morning, I woke up at 5:30 a.m., 1 hour and 30 minutes late, and my father almost missed his business meeting with nine people. I was so furious that I decided never to drink coffee again, and I kept my promise. I haven't sipped a single drop of coffee since, and I'll stick to it for the next few years. I even gave my 1 kg of freshly brewed coffee beans to one of my father's friends, so I'd never try coffee again. Therefore, I successfully quit my caffeine addiction overnight.


I have plenty of examples of how I cut off people, whom I once loved with all my heart, from my life in the blink of an eye; some of them were my best friends, whom I had been friends with for more than seven years.


Anyway, overall, I don't deem this idiosyncrasy healthy. My family and my best friends are kind of afraid of me because I can make the hardest and toughest decisions in a few seconds, and they know I'll stick to them for the rest of my life. I feel like a jerk.


Though I tried to express my feelings as clearly and transparently as I could, I understand if it sounds vague or confusing to you. I genuinely appreciate the time you took to read this. Thanks for being there ❤️",4,1749111743.0,confession,14,0.83,False
1l3twa6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l3twa6,Guess my type,"I am an introvert

I love Japan because it's a great combination of modernity, simple living and nature.

I'm an indoor person. I love reading and watching fantasy, romance, murder mystery, and political thriller.

I'd love to wake up to a rainy autumn morning and sip some brewed coffee or hot choco.

I've curled my hair since 4 years ago. I hate combing from time to time, that's why hehe.

I prefer smart casual attire with a subtle hint of pink.

I love listening to alternative rock. I think Iris by the Goo Goo Dolls is the most romantic and at same time saddest song ever written.

I'm not into a pet that needs a lot of caring and cuddling. I'm not a cuddle person myself. I like something relaxing. So I got for fish in an aquarium.

My ultimate crush is Richard Madden. He is a combination of rugged and refined.

You're not alone! I've been experimenting with optimizing my setup for painfully slow connections,and I wanted to share a few things that have actually made a difference.

First, prioritize. Identify the *absolute* necessities for your ByteLifetyle. Can you realistically cut back on bandwidth-heavy activities like streaming high-definition video and focus on text-based dialog, coding, or offline content creation? A temporary shift can considerably reduce network strain.

Second, bandwidth management is key. Tools like your router's QoS (Quality of Service) settings can prioritize certain types of traffic. I set mine to give video conferencing and important work tasks higher priority than background downloads or non-essential streaming. It's not a perfect solution, but it helps. Also consider using browser extensions that block auto-playing videos and resource-intensive ads.

offline alternatives can be a lifesaver. Pre-download podcasts, articles, or educational videos when you *do* have better connectivity (coffee shop trip, anyone?). Many coding environments work perfectly offline, allowing you to stay productive even with a terrible connection. What other strategies have you found useful for thriving in a ByteLifestyle, even with terrible internet? Let's hear your tips!",1,1749111315.0,ByteLifestyle,0,1.0,False
