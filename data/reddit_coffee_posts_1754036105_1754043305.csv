1mesmjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AustralianTeachers/comments/1mesmjs/social_clubs/,Social Clubs,"Just wanted some thoughts as this has been bugging me and im not sure how to approach it. 

We have tiered social club depending on if you drink tea and coffee.

If not its $40 a year which does some nibbles at a couple of meetings and gifts for staff for births, deaths, marriages etc.

Im in an R to 12 school. My first year there my daughter was born, not even a card, was told they don't really do it for male parents (however they did it for a male primary staff member later that year) yet huge deals were made for female staff, even having to sit through assemblies where they were brought up and given gifts etc.

I had a parent pass away last year once again not even a card despite sending flowers etc to female staff members when they have had distant relatives.

Again had emergency surgery this year, was out for a week, not even a card. Few weeks later a female coworkers partner had surgery and staff association sent home meals from the local Cafe and a card and flowers.

I don't really care about the money but its more just the not feeling like you even exist. 

Have thought about sending an email outlining why I no longer wish to pay to the organisers but concerned this may just make it worse but im also very stuck on feeling a bit shit when you see the acknowledgement of others in the school all of the time.",1,1754043169.0,AustralianTeachers,0,1.0,False

Just because I blacklisted his first love's hair salon, my boyfriend actually sent me—five months pregnant—on a hiking trip to the remote Cascade wilderness.

For a whole decade, Cassian Kemnis treated me with warmth and patience—always the perfect boyfriend.

Until he took me to his first love—Melody Merouin's hair salon for a haircut.

His precious ex deliberately destroyed the long hair I'd been growing for eighteen years.

My modeling agency blacklisted her salon to protect me from further damage.

Never expected my own devoted boyfriend would ditch me in the freaking Cascade wilderness.

After I barely made it back—exhausted, scared out of my mind—I heard him cracking up with his buddies.

""Come on, it was just a little lesson. Does she seriously think she's hot shit or something? Girl's knocked up with no ring—who the hell else is gonna want her dirty bitch besides me?""

I didn’t cry, just scheduled an abortion appointment instead.

Cassian Kemnis, we're done!

...

""Look at her—she's all bloated now, and her own family's cutting ties with her. And she still had the nerve to mess with Melody? Big fucking deal—just lost a bit of hair and pay some damn penalty fees. You don't screw with Melody. This is what happens.""

I stood frozen in the doorway, listening to Cassian's words, my whole body shaking.

Seven days. It took me seven whole goddamn days to get out of those mountains, filthy and soaked to the bone.

Up until this exact moment, I'd been holding onto desperate hope—praying my own boyfriend wasn't the one who dumped me in that hellish place.

""Dude, aren’t you afraid she’ll call off the wedding if she finds out?"" his buddy asked.

Cassian snorted.

""Doesn't matter if she knows or not. I'm all she's got. Nobody else would want her used-up bitch now. Besides, she's crazy in love with me. Pathetic.""

His words cut through me like knives, ripping my heart to shreds.

He was so confident I'd never leave him.

I forced a bitter smile and stumbled to the corner store to borrow their phone.

""Hello, Dad? It's me, Aurora.""

An irritated voice came through the speaker.

""You still have the nerve to call? I threw all your fucking stuff in the dumpster outside. Go dig through it yourself and don’t ever contact me. You're a fucking disgrace whore.""

Before I could say another word, he hung up.

Cassian was right. Nobody wanted me anymore.

Even my own father had given up on me.

Ten years ago, Cassian saved me on that snowy mountain when I was ready to end it all. Gave me a second chance at life.

He said I had the most beautiful eyes.

Later I realized it was because they looked exactly like Melody's.

He'd been looking right through me at his percious ex this whole time.

I walked out into the rain and stumbled barefoot into the hospital.

""Hi, I need to schedule an abortion. As soon as possible.""

After a full examination, the doctor shook his head.

""Ma'am, you're severely malnourished and weak. Your uterine wall is dangerously thin, and at twenty weeks... if we do this procedure, you'll might never have children again.""

My face went pale, my hands trembling.

""Please do it.""

I couldn't even take care of myself right now—how could I be so selfish as to bring a child into this nightmare?

The surgery was scheduled for next week.

I dragged myself home, looking like hell.

""Jesus Christ, Aurora, you look like hell. Can't you just stay put when you're pregnant? Always gotta cause drama.""

Cassian's voice was mocking. His friends were cracking up behind him.

Ten years of Oscar-worthy performances. Ten years of my love down the drain.

I ignored them, just headed upstairs to the bedroom.

Funny how that oversized wedding portrait of us looking so in love is still hanging above the bed, like nothing ever happened.""

Right. I'd almost forgotten—our wedding was only in a month away.

Just another chance for him to humiliate me, wasn't it?

Timing it perfectly for when I'd really start showing.

Let everyone see the knocked-up bride.

I checked my phone. My agent had managed to push back the three million I owed in penalties.

Now I felt nothing but bitterness.

This was it. Game over.

That night, Cassian spooned me from behind, his hand on my belly.

""You and our little one are okay... right?""

Chapter 2

""Yeah.""

I closed my eyes, my voice flat as hell.

Cassian's hand jerked away like I'd slapped him. My coldness clearly caught him off guard.

""Cassian... do you actually love me?""

He didn't even hesitate.

""Of course I do.""

Right on cue, his phone started buzzing.

I could hear her crying through the speaker.

""Cassian, I had that nightmare again where you abandon me. I'm so scared. Please don't marry her, don't leave me, please...""

His voice turned all soft and urgent.

""Hey, hey, Melody, it's okay. That's never gonna happen. I'm coming over right now.""

After he hung up, he glanced back at me.

""Aurora, quit the drama. I told you I'd marry you, and I meant it. Just take care of yourself and the baby.""

Maybe dumping me in the mountains was finally eating at him, because suddenly he was pretending to give a shit about me.

Then he was out the door, running to her like always.

To him, I'd never be anything more than Melody's cheap stand-in.

I got up and looked at all our old photos around the room.

Funny thing—ever since Melody came back, we hadn't taken a single picture together.

At 3 AM, Melody posted on Instagram.

Photos of Cassian driving all over the city at midnight hunting for her favorite macarons.

A video of him making her pasta from scratch in her kitchen.

Shit he'd never done for me. Not once in ten years.

Cassian always told me to ""be more understanding.""

And I never asked for anything.

Turns out he didn't want someone understanding—he just didn't want me.

I grabbed every photo of us and ripped them to shreds, cutting up my hands in the process.

Just like all the little wounds Cassian thought didn't count.

Next morning, I ripped down every wedding decoration in the house.

Keys jingled in the lock.

Melody walked in like she owned the place.

""God, Aurora, look at you. What makes you think you can compete with me?""

Straight to the point. I had to give her that.

But I'm not surprised at her here at all. ""What do you want, Melody?""

My voice was ice.

""Aw honey, if it bothers you, I won't move in. I just thought you could use some help. Cassian's worried sick about you.""

Suddenly she was all sweet and concerned.

Which meant Cassian was about to show up.

Her sharp nails dug right into my belly.

I pushed her hands away, protecting my baby on instinct.

Melody let out this dramatic scream and threw herself backward, slamming her head into the corner of the coffee table.

Blood started trickling down her face.

""Melody!""

Cassian dropped his suitcases and rushed to her side.

""I'm fine, Cassian. Aurora's just... pregnancy hormones, you know? Don't be mad at her—I shouldn't have surprised her like that.""

Her eyes filled with tears, blood and mascara running down her cheeks.

""What the fuck, Aurora? You keep attacking Melody for no goddamn reason. What is your problem?""

Cassian pointed at me like I was some kind of monster.

""Cassian, don't blame Aurora, okay? I'm sure she didn't mean it. Let’s just be thankful she’s safe.""

Melody tugged on his sleeve, playing the perfect victim.

""Please, stop with the constant doubts. If I really did hook up with Melody, do you honestly think you could compete with her? Look at yourself—Jesus, fat as hell.""

Chapter 3

I didn't say a word to defend myself against Cassian's accusations.

In the past, I would've been crying and begging for forgiveness by now.

Not anymore. Not ever again.

After a long silence, Cassian looked confused by my coldness.

He couldn't figure out why I wasn't breaking down like usual.

""You done? I'm tired.""

I turned and walked back to the bedroom. No explanations, no drama, no fear of anyone leaving.

That night, Cassian slipped into bed and pulled me close.

""Aurora, I'm exhausted, okay? Just... be good and stop picking fights with Melody. Our wedding's in a month, and I'll give you everything I promised, alright?""

He buried his face in my hair, his hand gently rubbing my belly.

""Mm-hmm.""

My voice was dead flat.

I don't want the wedding. I don't want the baby. I don't want anything that has to do with you anymore.

Keep your fucking promises yourself.

The next day, Cassian dragged me and Melody to hang out with his friends.

He said I'd be ""more comfortable"" in the back seat.

I closed my eyes and listened to him and Melody laugh and flirt in the front.

All their inside jokes, their shared history. None of it included me.

At the bar, it was the usual crowd—Cassian's asshole buddies.

All of them were Team Melody.

""Damn, the wife and the mistress, side by side like besties! Man, talk about living the dream!"" His buddy teased.

""Oh my god, don't say that! Aurora's carrying his baby—I could never compete with that! Cassian and I are just friends!""

Melody covered her face, all fake-bashful.

""Cut it out, guys.""

Cassian barely tried to shut them down.

""Aurora, sit here.""

He pulled out my chair, then immediately did the same for Melody.

When the server started pouring drinks, Cassian grabbed his wrist before he could fill Melody's glass.

""Skip her—she gets all red and gross when she drinks.""

I stared at my own glass, already filled to the top, and almost laughed.

Didn't give a damn to his pregrent fiancée, but another woman. Guess Cassian did love her.

Someone suggested playing spin the bottle with truth or dare.

First spin landed on Melody.

They dared her to play the pocky game with someone.

She covered her face like she was so embarrassed, then pointed at Cassian all shy.

""Cassian, would you... help me out?""

He glanced at me, saw my blank expression and shrugged.

""Yeah, whatever.""

Everyone lost their minds cheering as their faces got closer and closer.

The whole table went crazy while I just sat there quietly rub my belly.

Like everyone forgot I was supposed to be Kevin's fiancée.

After they finished the cookie, Cassian's ears were bright red.

""Bro, it's honestly tragic you two never hooked up. I always thought you'd end up together—you're like, soulmates or whatever. Plus all that crazy shit you used to do for Melody in college? Good times.""

Cassian shot him a warning look and the guy finally shut up.

Then he grabbed my hand.

""Aurora, they're just messing around. Don't take it seriously.""

I smiled at him like I couldn't care less.

""It's fine. Doesn't bother me.""

Cassian looked satisfied with my reaction.

Then the bottle spun again.

This time it pointed at me.

I looked around the table. They all had this excited, predatory look.

""Ooh, how about pregnant mama does her best kangaroo impression? She's already got the pouch going, and that hair's looking pretty wild—just hop around a bit!""

I looked straight at Cassian.

He didn't stop them or think there was anything wrong with his friends humiliating his pregnant fiancée.

He was totally used to it.

Because this wasn't the first time anyway.

I used to think taking their dirty shit was my ticket into his world.

It took me way too long to realize some circles aren't worth joining—especially when they make it crystal clear you're not wanted.

Me and my team used to believe hustle 24/7 was the only way to get ahead. Early mornings, late nights, skipping breaks - grinding nonstop felt like the “right” way to build something meaningful.

But burnout caught up with us. Productivity dipped, motivation vanished, and the energy in the room just died down. That’s when we realized - nonstop hustle isn’t sustainable.

Here’s what helped us actually work better and keep the fire alive:

1. **We started taking real breaks.** Partying 2 or 3 weekends a month isn’t just fun and it’s a mental reset. When you step away from work, your brain gets space to recharge and come back sharper.
2. **We go on bike rides together.** Fresh air and change of scenery sparked new ideas and boosted team morale more than any coffee could.
3. **Random team dinners.** Sharing a meal away from screens helps build connections and ease stress and reminding us we’re more than just coworkers.
4. **We share small gifts sometimes.** It’s simple but it shows appreciation and keeps the team vibe positive.

Balancing hustle with chill isn’t weakness - it’s smart strategy. Burnout kills startups faster than failure ever will.

So if you’re stuck in grind mode 24/7, try this: take breaks, connect with your team, and don’t forget to chill.

So… turns out I completely forgot it’s Friday, and apparently so did everyone else. The office is basically a ghost town — I think I’ve seen more plants than people today. 😅

Lucky for me, it's a pretty meeting-free day. Which means I’ve got time, a decent mood, and a growing desire for some fun conversation to make the hours go faster.

Definitely vibing with some extroverted energy today — give me someone who can match mine or overwhelm me (in the best possible way)

I accidentally hit Command + Enter (Mac shortcut to send) instead of Cmd + K to add a link. It's sent. Half-written. No subject line. Too many typos. Very casual tone. Not even a proper signoff.

I panicked. Followed up with another email apologising and attaching the ""REAL"" message, but you know how it is. The damage is done. First impressions matter.

I've been thinkking a lot lately...like, seriously pondering about where we're all heading in this big ol' mess called life. And you know what? Amidst all the chaos, I've felt this quiet hope bubbling up, kinda unexpectedly. It's like, despite everything that seems to go wrong around the world, there's stlil this faint glimmer that just can't be put out.

I mean, sure, there's so much to be worried about: cilmate change, societal divides, and all those techy threats stemimng from AI. We could spend days listing our fears, and tbh, I've got my share too. But maybe, just msybe, this is more abbout the smlal victories we're all achieving collectively. Those little moments when communities come together to plant trees, or when people sfand up for each other, and even when strangers hold the door open with a genuine sile.

It's like my morning coffee—the warm comfort that brings a sense of routine and calm in the whirlwind of the daily grind. There's this unshakeable beilef that we can do better by each other, that we're on the brink of findng cooler, kinder ways to be human. 

Am I naive? Maybe. But doesn't the world need a bit of that sometimes? A bit of daredevil hope that holds us tgoether even when we seem to be fraying at the edges? Maybe you'll read this and feel the same gentle tugging at your heartstrings... or maybe you'll just shrug it off. Either's cool. We're just voices in the digital universse aftter all.

Ever wondered if your *sitting-idle* PC could be making you **passive income while you sleep, work, or Netflix & chill?**

I recently stumbled upon a platform — it literally pays you for the *idle processing power* of your computer. No mining, no shady stuff. You just **install their tiny app, let it run in the background**, and watch your balance grow. 🖥️💰

👉 **It doesn’t slow down your PC. You won’t even notice it’s running.**  
👉 **Payments via PayPal / Crypto once you hit the payout threshold.**  
👉 **Takes less than 2 minutes to set up.**  
👉 **Completely passive — earn while doing nothing.**

I’ve been using it for a few weeks, and while you won’t get rich overnight, it’s an easy side hustle to make **some extra coffee or a slice of pizza money on autopilot.**

If you’re curious to try it out — head to my profile 🔗 \[**DM Me for the LINK**\] **(helps me out too! ❤️)**:

1mescso,https://www.reddit.com/r/PsylinksAnnounce/comments/1mescso/realworld_scenarios_how_ech_browser_protects_you/,Real-World Scenarios: How Ech Browser Protects You Daily,"Everyday online threats can be subtle or sudden—but Ech Browser’s privacy and security features are designed to protect you in situations you face daily. Here are real-world scenarios showing how Ech Browser works to keep you safe and private:

# 1. Shopping Safely: Avoiding Fake Online Stores

*Scenario:* You’re searching for sneakers and come across an unfamiliar store with steep discounts.

* **How Ech Browser Protects You:** As you open the site, Ech analyzes the page in real-time for signs of phishing or misuse. If the website mimics a well-known brand, uses suspicious URLs, or requests sensitive information insecurely, Ech’s scam detection feature flags it instantly and displays a prominent warning—helping you avoid entering payment data on a fraudulent site. This threat intelligence is based on known scam domains and the detection of deceptive site patterns.

# 2. Reading the News: Blocking Sneaky Trackers

*Scenario:* You visit a news site to stay updated, but behind the scenes, dozens of ad trackers and third-party scripts are ready to log your reading habits.

* **How Ech Browser Protects You:** Ech’s tracker blocker automatically stops tracking cookies, invisible pixels, and fingerprinting attempts before they load, stripping out hidden scripts that would otherwise follow you from article to article. As a result, you don’t see the same targeted ads everywhere, your reading history isn’t shared with data brokers, and pages load faster—giving you a private, cleaner browsing experience from the moment you arrive.

# 3. Everyday Browsing: Preventing Drive-By Download Attacks

*Scenario:* You receive a link via social media to a supposed celebrity video. The site automatically starts a download you didn’t ask for.

* **How Ech Browser Protects You:** Ech’s security model analyzes the webpage for untrusted scripts and unexpected behaviors. It blocks suspicious downloads and known malware sources at the network level—so malicious files never reach your device. Even if you accidentally click a deceptive link, built-in real-time analysis and up-to-date threat intelligence minimize your risk.

# 4. Private Connections: Shielding Your Browsing from Prying Eyes

*Scenario:* You use public WiFi at a coffee shop and want to check your bank account.

* **How Ech Browser Protects You:** With encrypted protocols like Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) and DNS over HTTPS, Ech browser ensures that not just your data but the websites you visit are concealed from outsiders (like ISPs or malicious actors on the same network). ECH encrypts even the initial handshake between your browser and a website, so third parties can’t know which sites you’re accessing—even on untrusted networks.

# 5. Peace of Mind When Clicking Links

*Scenario:* An urgent email claims your account is compromised and urges you to “reset your password” via a provided link.

* **How Ech Browser Protects You:** Ech scans the domain and checks it against known phishing sites. If the link leads to a fake login page or suspicious domain, you’re stopped with a clear warning. This combines real-time analysis with ongoing security updates from experts, helping you avoid falling victim to phishing.

**From blocking scams to eliminating trackers, Ech Browser’s protections work together to provide daily, effortless security—no special expertise required.** You get fast, private browsing without compromise—so you’re free to explore the web confidently, every day.

But people *living* in that country still have to budget for groceries, rent, utilities, all the same stuff we try to escape when we’re on holiday. Just because your iced coffee only costs £2 doesn’t mean life’s automatically cheaper for everyone there.

1mes8a5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mes8a5,Start experience report,"Invisalign start experience report
Information in advance 
Crossbite, various misalignments 
23 rails 
Wearing time 
1st rail 11 days
2nd rail 8 days
3rd rail 9 days (and I should continue to follow this period) 
Daily wearing time 22 hours 
Insertion of rubbers and wearing of attachments started from the end of the 3rd rail 

I am 34 years old, as a teenager I wore fixed and then loose braces in my upper and lower jaw, and was given a metal retainer in my lower jaw. As my life progressed, my teeth began to shift more and more and I developed a crossbite again. 
3 months ago, after a short consultation with an orthodontist, I decided to undergo treatment with Invisalign. 
The reason for my appointment with the orthodontist was that my dentist had previously told me that my front teeth in the lower jaw were moving forward and that I would lose a tooth as a result, or one would wobble because the fixed retainer at the bottom was no longer really tight and the gums on this tooth were receding. But the upper jaw was also spared... 

Well, the orthodontist's diagnosis was that I have a tongue misalignment and that it presses against my front teeth every time I swallow and that's why everything is out of place. I just thought to myself, why didn't anyone tell me this before... 
I went straight to speech therapy to get my tongue under control (a lot of work) and Invisalign treatment started about 1 month later. (Shots, planning, payment, etc.) - I would have also taken traditional fixed braces, but I was told that they were worse for the teeth and tooth enamel and that Invisalign was the best on the market.
So at the end of June I got 23 splints, it started and that's why I'm now writing this report. Because I find the reports here very valuable. I only found out about a lot of things through Reddit (lol) when I was already in the process and that annoys me a bit.


I wore the first splint for 11 days to get used to it. It didn't hurt my teeth, it just took some getting used to. But overall it wasn't that great. 

In order to manage to wear the aligners for 22 hours a day as recommended (sometimes I only manage 20 hours), you have to eat really quickly. Have breakfast in the morning and then drink your coffee with pleasure at work - no answer. After every drink that is not water, after every meal: brushing your teeth and also the aligners, that really takes a lot of time. To do this I have to bite on Chewies for 15 minutes every day. 

Going out with friends in the evening and having a drink? It's actually not possible.. Unless you have saved up the two hours of 'free time' or you drink with the aligners on and risk tooth decay, according to the orthodontist.. I always have to have a toothbrush, toothpaste and mouthwash with me. Barbecue party with the neighbors? You can eat one plate, then brush your teeth again, put in the splints and drink water... snack from the buffet every now and then throughout the afternoon? - It's not in there... 
I find this all extremely drastic and would have liked this to have been described more clearly in advance. 

The change from the first to the second rail was terrible. The pain on day 1 of the second splint was so bad that I took ibuprofen 600 and it barely helped. In addition, my face was slightly swollen and I had extreme pain in my head. On day 3 the situation eased, but a slight headache remained. Everything so far so good. I wore them for 8 days. 
Then I had brace 3 for 5 days and had my first appointment with the orthodontist since the braces were inserted.
I got buttons on my teeth and hooks for rubber bands to prevent my crossbite. The process of attaching the hooks took 1 1/2 hours (ouch, jaw pain that eventually spread to the neck when you have to keep your mouth open for so long) and polishing off the excess glue was pure torture. Afterwards, 4 of my teeth were ground down to address the crowding, that was the least of the problems and didn't hurt in any way. 
After the appointment I came home and questioned my decision crying on the sofa.. my teeth hurt extremely. 
Also: the buttons and hooks are extremely sharp-edged unless you wear the rail. My orthodontist said that Invisalign intended this to be the case so that people would be more comfortable wearing the brace. So eating becomes even less attractive because I basically cut my tongue because I'm supposed to eat without a splint.  
In addition, removing the splint and inserting it using these buttons is extremely difficult and today it also hurts, so I think twice about whether the pain is worth a coffee in the afternoon - what a shame! And then this head pain...
If you smoke, it's better to stop first. You can't constantly take out the splint for a few cigarettes and if you smoke with the splint on, they will be completely yellow after a day. 
I'm now on splint 4, here the change or the pain wasn't that bad, after another 4 days nothing was left and I would have preferred to continue changing straight away. A rollercoaster of emotions, so to speak.
Another thing I've noticed is that I often find myself clenching my teeth together and I'm often irritated by the constant pain.

And I sometimes ask myself, what don't I know yet?  And I'm particularly surprised at the time frame given by my orthodontist. He said 1 to 1 1/2 years of treatment. But with the 23 splints for 9 days each, I get a different number.

Lucky for me, it's a pretty meeting-free day. Which means I’ve got time, a decent mood, and a growing desire for some fun conversation to make the hours go faster. Open to texting, voice chatting, or letting it turn into something a little more ongoing — whether it’s friends, flirtations, or somewhere in between.

I love talkative people — the more unhinged your ramble, the better. Bonus points if you’ve got a nice voice and a bit of sass

Definitely vibing with some extroverted energy today — give me someone who can match mine or overwhelm me (in the best possible way)

I've developed this quiet kind of strength in dealing with everyday stress that I didn't fully appreeciate about mysepf.

I mean, every morning it's the same routine: fight with the snooze button, rush through breakfast, and hope I don’t splil my coffse on my way out. And yet, despite the chaos, I've come to actually enjoy this little rhythm of resilience. It's like, life throws its usual curveballs, but I've got my own way of handling them, ya know?

I gess it just hit me today that resilience isn't always about grand gestures or huge accomplihments. Sometimes it's just about getting through the day with a smile and without flipping out at traffic or canceed coffee runs.

1mes5zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1mes5zf/former_contact_nap_parents_help/,Former contact nap parents - help,"This isn't a huge problem right now, per se, but my 4 month old only takes her naps in the carrier (or in arms, but less so now). This is largely down to me and being very 'out and about' (I have had plans a lot of the time since she was 6 weeks old - baby sensory, baby massage, coffees/meet-ups with friends and mum friends etc) so it has been fantastic to fit her naps in when travelling somewhere. Also, as a reflux baby, since birth she has had to be held upright after feeds so I think she got used to contact naps being her thing.

For now, it's fine. If I'm not going out, I pop her in the carrier and wander around the living room while watching TV (love it. Chores? Nah.) But I am starting to think that maybe, at some point, we should transition her to the crib for daytime naps. I have tried a few times - letting her fall asleep in my arms then moving her into the crib, but she wakes up after 5 mins. 

I DEFINITELY cannot put her in the crib awake in the daytime, ha. She makes it known she is not happy. When she is tired she is cranky and just wants to be cosy with me or my partner.

She also naps well in the carrier - 3-4 hrs a day overall (with one 2-hour nap thrown in, usually). I fear short naps so much. She's a baby who needs her sleep.

So my question is for other carrier/contact nap parents who have come out the other side: how did you do it?? When/what age? Was it an awful transition or worth it eventually?

I still need her to nap in the carrier at least once a day so I don't think I could do a full crib nap vibe.

I'm also not a fan of CIO or anything too harsh. Is it even possible, or will it be easier as she gets older?

For the record, she sleeps perfectly fine in her crib at night. Good long stretches, no fuss. Can pop her in there in the evening either asleep or drowsy and she is happy to be in there... it's just these damn naps!!

TIA!

TLdr: my baby is a contact nap/carrier napper only. How and when did you manage to introduce crib naps for your cuddly baby? Loves her crib at night, just hates it in the day.",1,1754041500.0,beyondthebump,1,1.0,False

Boone believes the Judge ordered the child support be paid to a third party and now wants access to it. LIE  The Judge actually ordered child support be vacated till further notice.  Meaning no child support is due.

From the time of her divorce in 2018 until she murd3red Jorge in 2020,  Boone had a chance to better herself and become independent.  She did not do that. She remained unemployable because she was regularly drunk.

Boone lied to the court claiming all her family is dead. LIE She is calling her brother Phillip as a witness. 

Boone lied to the court claiming she receives no money. LIE There are several flying monkeys putting money into her commissary and phone and tablet account every month. 

Boone claims her monthly expenses are $785. LIE $250 in food is a LUXURY  $200 in phone calls is a  LUXURY $50 in bras HA hang your tits free bish.. $285 in other unnecessary crap. LUXURY 

Boone continuously refers to Brian and his attorney committing perjury but fails to support that claim with evidence.  

Boone objects to Brians attorney asking the court to taking judicial notice of her murd3r trial as the reason there should be a change in support etc. The trial is a fact not a speculation. 

MY BELIEF 

The judge will not ""review"" ANY court cases Boone has referred to to support her argument as she did not give a few lines for each as to how they are relevant.  ( i looked in to them 3 hurt her!!)

Boone has no expenses.  All Boones needs are paid by the tax payer.

Boone will object to being referred to as a murd3rer,

A trial will reveal Boone PERJURIED herself in the financial affidavit by claiming she has no money. 

In the unlikely event the court grants her any alimony as  due from mar 2020 to April 2025, the lump sum will be part of a record. She will be deemed no longer indigent.  She will have to pay for own appealate attorney. 

Once this trial is done and the appeal is done Boone goes to oblivion.  No one will care about her daily prison life. She will remain irrelevant,

( I am a new bie , have very little knowledge of coffee, I do like to experiment a little)

🧂 Ingredients:

Item	Quantity

Whole Arabica Coffee Beans	22–24 grams
Cinnamon Powder (for grounds)	1/8 to 1/4 tsp
Preheated Water (for moka pot)	150 ml
Milk (for frothing)	200–220 ml
Cocoa Powder (topping)	1/4 to 1/2 tsp
Cinnamon Powder (topping)	Light sprinkle (~1/8 tsp)



---

🧑‍🔬 Step-by-Step Instructions:

☕ 1. Grind the Beans

Measure 22–24g of roasted Arabica beans.

Grind to a medium-fine consistency (like table salt).

Mix in 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of cinnamon powder with the grounds.


> ⚠️ Don’t grind too fine like for espresso—it’ll block your moka pot.




---

🫗 2. Prepare the Moka Pot

Boil water separately and let it cool for a few seconds (so it doesn’t shock the coffee).

Pour 150 ml of hot water into the bottom chamber of your moka pot (up to the safety valve).

Insert the filter basket.

Fill it with your ground coffee + cinnamon mix. Level it, don’t press down.

Screw the top on (carefully, it's hot) and place on medium heat.


> ☕ Brew will take 4–6 minutes. When you hear a gurgling hiss, your espresso is ready.




---

🥛 3. Heat & Froth the Milk

Heat 200–220 ml milk until it’s warm (not boiling) — around 60–65°C if you’ve got a thermometer.

Pour hot milk into a French press.

Pump the plunger up and down vigorously for 15–20 seconds to froth it up.


> 🎉 You’re aiming for that silky froth that sits like a cloud on your drink.




---

🧋 4. Combine & Build the Drink

Pour the freshly brewed moka espresso (approx. 80–90 ml) into your 350 ml cup.

Gently pour in your steamed milk, holding back the foam.

Spoon that beautiful microfoam on top.



---

🍫 5. Finish with Flair

Dust the top with:

1/4 to 1/2 tsp cocoa powder

A pinch (~1/8 tsp) of cinnamon powder

*For years, Epstein’s death was the litmus test for institutional credibility. The footage was missing. The autopsy didn’t add up. Even conservative voices — like Dan Bongino and Kash Patel — raised hell about it.* *But now, in May 2025, those same voices are calling the case closed. What changed? Not the evidence. Just the narrative.*

# ✦ The Illusion of Closure: Reconstructing the Epstein Narrative

# I. A Case Built on Absence

Epstein’s death occurred during a time when security cameras malfunctioned, guards fell asleep, and logs went unsigned. The autopsy revealed injuries more consistent with homicidal strangulation than hanging. Files disappeared. Associates distanced themselves. What should have been a forensic investigation became a carefully curated void.

The footage released by the FBI in May 2025 — over eleven hours of muted hallway recordings — was touted as definitive proof. But it doesn't show Epstein's cell. It doesn't track every entrance or corridor. CBS reconstructed the prison layout and concluded someone could've accessed his tier unseen.

>This was not a surveillance triumph — it was visual misdirection.

# II. Discrepancy and Doubt

There was always room for doubt. Even conservative legal minds balked at the inconsistencies. Independent forensic experts questioned the autopsy. Guards changed stories.

Yet the case grew quieter — not from lack of interest, but from strategic suppression. The video’s release was meant to punctuate that silence. Instead, it amplified the unresolved.

* An orange blur moving across a staircase is labelled a corrections officer
* A gate briefly opens and closes

These fragments are treated as gospel. But for those who believe the details still matter, it feels more like the final shovel of dirt on a grave dug by omission.

# III. The Mechanics of Misdirection

This isn't just about Epstein. It's about how information is **staged to create consensus**. The deployment of degraded footage after years of speculation wasn’t for transparency — it was for closure management.

When answers aren't feasible, **ambiguity must be reframed as resolution**.

* In this framework, **clarity becomes a liability**
* Every unresolved frame becomes a tool for deflection
* When media figures step into the role of official narrators, their authority doesn't illuminate — it **seals**

# IV. The Custodians of Closure

Dan Bongino and Kash Patel once stood as loud sceptics of the Epstein case, invoking elite networks, vanished tapes, and compromised institutions. They dissected anomalies and claimed deeper truths lay buried. Their audiences followed them because they refused to accept official stories at face value.

Yet in May 2025, these same figures endorsed the video — not with reluctance or nuance, but **full-throated affirmation**.

* “Epstein killed himself,” Bongino declared, citing lack of suspects, fingerprints, and DNA
* Patel added the case was “confirmed”

It beggars belief. Not because evidence clarified — but because their reversal **abandoned the tools they'd built careers on**. These were men who could spot corruption in a coffee stain. Now, they looked at video gaps and called them closure.

Their transformation raises uncomfortable possibilities:

* Did their roles within Trump’s FBI demand a new kind of loyalty?
* Are they preserving reputations at the expense of credibility?
* Or are they buffering the public from truths that still pose danger?

Whatever the reason, their about-face didn’t quell conspiracy — it validated it.

>Because when the loudest voices for truth become its gatekeepers, you don’t get resolution — you get **choreography**.

1mes2d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1mes2d3/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1mes1rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LPR/comments/1mes1rp/success_story_severe_lpr_gerd_ft_hiatal_hernia/,"Success Story - Severe LPR+ Gerd (Ft. Hiatal Hernia) (Full Recovery, No restrictions, No Symptoms, Off All Medication)","I'm writing this post because I saw a few comments/posts talking about how the success stories are usually like

***""I'm doing fine, but only when I avoid X, Y, Z foods, I don't bend, and I drink Gaviscon daily and take X, Y, Z PPIs daily,""***

So I wanted to share my story to show that it *is* possible to go fully back to pre-LPR.  
But I don’t have a direct solution for y’all. I believe all of us have to find out our own solutions because the root causes and what your body reacts to is different for everyone.

This is just an anecdote.

I had **severe LPR**:

* Insane globus (lump feeling)
* Burping all day
* Silent reflux
* Throat burning, hoarseness, pain in throat
* Bloating… uh… mucus?
* Couldn't bend or exercise hard either
* A lot of trigger foods
* Daily PPI use
* Dry Mouth
* Bad Taste In Mouth
* Wedge Pillows..

(Age 15–20)

I'm 21 now.

* I’m off **all PPIs** (2 years now and going strong)
* I have **zero trigger foods**
* I drink coffee regularly
* I eat spicy foods, pizza, anything
* I can eat **larger amounts** of food if I want (I just get sleepy, so I don’t lol)
* I sprint/lift and do yoga now
* I can **sing again**, and uh, I don’t get hoarse really
* I can exercise even on a **full stomach** and get **no reflux** (sometimes I do, but usually I don't)

What I did is not simple, I think all of us have a different root cause.

For me:

* Tongue tie surgery
* Then rehabilitating it myself
* Fixing my breathing patterns
* Strengthening my core
* Getting back to running/lifting
* Uh… working on my anxiety
* Getting off PPIs
* Neck strengthening
* Meditation/energy work
* Nasal Breathing instead of Mouth Breathing
* I did try alternative treatments too while I was still on PPIs
* Posture work

It just clicked one day, and yeah, I have **zero symptoms now**.  
No restrictions. I'm just like a regular person now. Possibly even got a stronger sphincter because I worked on making it stronger.

I did follow low-acid diets too at times, and ate small amounts, which probably helped too.  
I just kept trying random things until it clicked.

If I had to say, *if you're so keen on a direct answer to how I think mine got fixed,* I would say: **relentless experimentation with exercises**.

I just kept going.  
Kept trying anything and everything.  
Eventually my posture got better, breathing patterns became more coherent, my **UES** got stronger from the neck work (there's a study on this too iirc), my **LES** got stronger from the core work and breathing exercises (I'm just speculating, but I've seen studies on this too), my anxiety got better…

And like, it just wasn’t there anymore one morning.

I sometimes come on this subreddit randomly, and I feel for y’all.  
It is literal hell, and you're very strong people.

It ain’t much, but I hope this can at least give some random person a little hope.  
From the bottom of my heart,I hope all of you find your way out in due time.

This is one of the worst phases of my life that I’d ever had to endure, and it made me realize how precious our health is.

This one is hard because **no one gets you**, and the quality of life hit is no joke.  
It feels like your life is snatched away from you and you see no way out.

Take care y’all. I wish you all the best.",1,1754041044.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The ⁢durability and style ⁤of patio‍ sets without cushions often hinge on the materials used and the overall design. Understanding these features is key ​to selecting the right set for yoru needs.

**Material Durability:** The most popular materials⁣ for cushion-less patio sets include⁣ aluminum, steel, wrought iron, teak, and resin wicker. Aluminum is lightweight and rust-resistant, making it ideal for⁤ coastal environments. Steel and wrought iron offer superior strength and stability, ⁢although they require protective coatings to prevent rust.Teak is ‌a naturally weather-resistant hardwood that develops a‍ stunning patina over time. Resin⁢ wicker provides ‍a classic look with‍ added durability and resistance to fading.

**Frame ⁤Construction:** A sturdy frame is essential for long-lasting patio furniture. Look for sets with welded joints or reinforced connections to ensure stability. Powder-coated finishes provide an extra layer of protection against rust ​and corrosion, extending the lifespan of the furniture. The frame should ⁣be able to withstand regular use and various weather conditions without bending ​or breaking.

**Design Aesthetics:** Patio sets without cushions are available ⁤in a wide array of designs, from sleek‍ and modern to rustic and conventional. Consider the overall style of your outdoor space and choose a set ⁣that complements ‌your existing decor. Clean lines and minimalist designs are popular choices for contemporary patios, while ornate⁣ details and curved frames can enhance a more traditional​ setting.

**Seating Capacity & Configuration:** Determine the number of seats you need based on your typical usage and the size of your ⁣patio or deck. Sets range from intimate bistro configurations with ‍two chairs to​ larger dining sets that ⁣can accommodate six or more people.Modular sectional pieces offer flexibility in arranging the seating layout to suit your specific needs and preferences.

**Table Design & Functionality:** The table is a central element of any patio set. Consider the size⁣ and shape of the table, as well as its intended use. Coffee tables are ‍ideal for casual lounging, while dining tables provide ample space⁤ for ⁤meals ⁢and gatherings. Tables with built-in umbrella holes offer added convenience for providing shade on⁢ sunny days. Some tables also feature storage compartments for keeping outdoor essentials close at hand.

**weather Resistance & Maintenance:** Look ​for sets that are‌ specifically designed to withstand outdoor weather conditions. UV-resistant materials will prevent fading and discoloration over time.Waterproof or water-resistant finishes will protect against⁣ moisture damage. Regular ‍cleaning with mild soap and water is ‍typically all that’s needed to maintain‍ the appearance of ‌most patio sets.

## Core Benefits

Patio sets lacking cushions offer several distinct⁣ advantages that make them a compelling choice for many homeowners. These include ease of maintenance, enhanced durability, and design‌ versatility.

**Low Maintenance:** One of the primary benefits of patio sets without cushions is their inherently low maintenance requirements.eliminating cushions removes the need ⁤for frequent cleaning, stain removal,​ and‍ protection from rain⁣ and sun⁣ damage. This frees up valuable time and resources, allowing you to focus on ⁤enjoying your outdoor space rather ⁢than maintaining it.

**Enhanced Durability:** Without the porous material of cushions, these patio sets are considerably more durable and resistant⁢ to the elements. Materials like aluminum, steel, and teak can withstand years of exposure to sun, rain, ‌and wind without deteriorating. This makes these sets a long-term investment that will provide years of reliable use.

**Versatile Design Options:** Patio sets without cushions can be easily customized to suit a variety of personal styles and preferences. Throw ‍pillows, outdoor-friendly blankets, and seat cushions can be added to create a more comfortable and inviting seating area. This flexibility ​allows you to ‍change up the look of your patio set without having to replace the entire furniture.

**Space saving:** Many patio sets without cushions feature stackable chairs or folding tables, making them ideal for small patios or balconies.‌ These space-saving designs allow you to‌ maximize the use of your outdoor area and easily store the furniture when it's not in use. This is especially beneficial for apartment dwellers⁤ or homeowners with limited storage space.

**Modern Aesthetic:** The clean ⁤lines and minimalist designs of many patio sets without cushions contribute to a modern and sophisticated⁢ outdoor aesthetic. This can create a more open and airy ‍feel in your patio area,enhancing​ the overall appeal of your outdoor living space.⁢ This style complements contemporary homes and gardens, providing a seamless transition between indoor and outdoor living.

1meryco,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1meryco,Lost a lot of weight from walking/recent walks :),"Posted about 4+ months ago about walking and losing weight, so it's been about 2 years and 6 months at this point since I started to get my fave frappe drink.

Anyway life is really really good, I've now lost 17.2stone/109kg+ in weight, thankfully whilst yes I do have a little bit of excess skin, it's surprisingly not that bad at all. (This may be due to being slim prior to falling ill to untreated sleep apnea and ballooning in weight during my twenties)

I don't diet or calorie count, as I got asked this a lot in my last post, I actually enjoy a lot of lattes, iced lattes, frappes and cake.

Anyway enjoy some pictures of some my recent walks, coffees and cakes 😁 

And my usual monthly walking stats so you get an idea of what I usually do on average a month. (I work on my feet)

I am a person who packs a lot of stuff. Since were going on vacation for a whole week, it took me almost an entire morning. But I was done in time and I didn't have that many bags (It were 3). But then my mother got angry with me cuz she said I took too long. She grumbled at me and I got very angry and snapped: I told her I can never do anything right with her and started crying (I guess it was a mix of frustration and anger)

Then my father and brother came home and kinda appeased the situation. My mother forced an apologie, she said: ""I'm sorry, stop crying, I'm just tryjng to make your life easier by telling you overpack."" Ofc that's not what she litteraly said, but that's what it sounded like to me.

During coffee break she told me to cheer up, since I was acting like captain Holt from Brooklyn 99 (I was just very neutral in my emotions). But I was just not feeling like smiling to her.

1merwyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1merwyp/how_stupid_am_i/,How stupid am I,"At first I resisted, bc I knew who and what you were. Then you convinced me to come over just for cuddles. I turned it into something more bc I wanted to feel something. I was going to treat it like any other hookup but then I left my damn Stanley at your place. You brought it to me and then I expected you to leave me alone. You didn’t. You kept texting, I kept going over. The whole time I was trying not to fall, honestly it was too late, but I tried to convince myself I had it all under control. 

Then you asked me to be your gf. I said yes. I accidentally said those 3 words too soon bc it’s what I felt. I knew it was crazy to say it so I stopped myself and ran out of the room. You followed me, grabbed my face, kissed me, and said it back. Over the next few months you made me believe you actually did love me. I showed up for you during loss. Used vacation time so I could be there. I cooked for you and that’s something i said I would never do again unless I was sure it was going to last. We worked out together. You kissed me in between sets for everyone to see. Bought us matching pump covers. Bought me rings. Wore the ring I gave you. I changed my whole daily routine for you so I could spend time with you. You always listened to me and I thought you cared. Got me pregnant and now bc of you and the stress you inflicted, is causing a miscarriage. 

You never did actually love me. It was all part of the sick game that I knew from the beginning you play. I asked you to remove all the girls from your phone and you just called me insecure and an over thinker. But no. Overthinking is not overthinking if it’s true. No woman wants to have a man who keeps his whole roster and lusts over thousands of woman on social media. Tomorrow would have been 4 months officially together and you threw me away like I never meant anything. Over what? Because you can’t let go of the girls who feed your ego. Because me telling you every day how handsome you are and how I literally drool over you and how much I love you wasn’t enough. Because in the end, you’re the one who is insecure, not me. Because what woman isn’t going to feel insecure when she knows she doesn’t have her man’s full attention? I know I’m a fucking catch, but what are you? Just an insecure little boy who needs constant validation from wherever he can get it. And the worst part is I knew that, but i gave you the benefit of the doubt in thinking maybe you changed. But the way you ran right back to following more women, your ex included, tells me you never planned to be different. It’s not that I wasn’t good enough for you, it’s that you believe you will never be good enough so you just run away like a coward and go right to the next. 

My only hope is that the memory of me haunts you and your dreams and you are never able to escape. And quit with the pointless lying, it’s so unnecessary. You knew which ex works at the coffee shop, because your sisters told you exactly which one. But when I asked you just said you didn’t know and didn’t care to ask. Like bro, wtf was the point in lying about that😂 and it’s not the only thing you lied to me about, I found out so much information just from one conversation. I didn’t even have to ask, the truth was said and I kept saying “wait that was lie too?” So no, when I asked you as I was walking out the door if you cheated or were talking to other girls and you looked me dead in the eyes and said no? I didn’t believe it for a second. 

I don’t wish bad on you, but I do wish that you’d wake tf up and get your shit together. I was a real one who would have gone to the ends of the earth for you and given you the life you say you want so badly. You might end up getting it, but whatever whore you end up married to you’ll just be laying next to every night wishing it was me. And that peace you wanted? Begins with yourself. Be a real man, and maybe you’ll notice that every girl you date doesn’t ask you the same questions about what’s on your phone.

The last time we hung out, I took her out for dinner, stayed up until the small hours of the morning just talking in bed, and hung out all morning and got coffee until she went home at 1pm. It was an amazing vibe, great connection. We had a blast. 

During that hang, I told her I was into her and that I like hanging out and want to keep hanging out. She said she does as well, but the thought of anything serious freaks her out. I told her I wasn’t insinuating that (true) and that I’m just enjoying these moments and only raised this because I want to be in the same page about continuing to hang. She said she wants to keep going as we have been. Opened up about her past relationship a bit. And thanked for making her feel safe and comfortable. I get the sense she’s cautious with her emotions currently. But I am happy to move slowly, as I prefer that anyway. I don’t rush. 

The thing is, her text communication is so shit. Like sometimes more than 24 hours to reply. It’s not rare that she will take a while. Last text her nearly 24 hours ago, and although I hate to say it, it makes me feel anxious. It makes me feel like she’s not that interested. Makes me doubt myself and the connection we have so far. I know it’s early days. But like in person it’s awesome, inbetween in like damn maybe she doesn’t care.

Stocks: A company goes public (IPO). The sale of these shares occurs in the primary market. From this moment on, an investor who initially purchased these shares and intends to sell registers their order on the stock exchange, where a ""match"" with a buyer occurs. This is the secondary market. Nowadays, an intermediary emerges to facilitate these transactions: brokerages. They send all buy and sell orders to the respective exchanges.

Stock ETFs: This is where investment funds come in, which replicate a given index. And here comes my big question! How do they replicate something if: the transactions that builds a given index continue to occur, while the ETF transactions are also moving. Both transactions can have different behaviors, therefore, distinct variations. What is the flow in this case? Does the ETF price, in this case, not represent the last transaction made? Or is it ""manipulated"" by the fund to follow the same price variation as the index? If so, how do they do it? What is a fund's strategy? When I buy an ETF, am I transferring € to the fund, which will then be used to purchase shares and properly balance them? How is this reflected in the price?

I think I'll only be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel if someone makes me an organizational chart showing the flow from start to finish 😎

1merw04,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1merw04/chapter_37_new_boy_life_and_death_at_the_world/,Chapter 37 New Boy: Life and Death at the World Headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses,"Chapter 37 One More Casualty of the *New Light*

My wife Debbie loved her real father, Robert Stillman, more than anything, even though he was disfellowshipped and lived three thousand miles away. The best times in her young life were with her father and not her mother. What a surprise.

However, if Debbie even said her father’s name in front of Elaine her mother, she would get her face slapped. Bob had left Debbie’s psycho mother back in the 1950s and married another woman. He was, of course, disfellowshipped. It was his only way out of his nasty marriage.

Say you are a Jehovah’s Witness, and you are in a really bad marriage. There is physical, emotional and maybe even sexual abuse going on. For many years, there was only one way to get out of this kind of hell: Someone had to commit adultery. That’s right. Of course, you could get a divorce for any reason. You just couldn’t get remarried unless one of you committed adultery. For decades, it has been the *Society’s* only provision that would allow you to get remarried.

Believe it or not there was a time when that was ONLY allowed if you had sex with someone of the opposite sex.

How about sex with someone of the same sex? Divorce was NOT allowed.

How about sex with farm animals? Divorce was NOT allowed.

For many years, sex with someone of *different sex* was the only *scriptural grounds* for divorce and the only way to get out of a totally toxic marriage.

Of course, this sounds crazy!

Kool-Aid, anyone?

This *new light* came out while I was at Bethel. In the Watchtower, Jan. 1, 1972 issue, pp.31-32, a reader asked this question: *Do homosexual acts on the part of a married person constitute scriptural grounds for divorce, freeing the innocent mate to remarry?*

This *new light* will blow your mind. The Societies’ answer to that question was this:

*“Whether an innocent mate would scripturally be able to remarry after procuring a legal divorce from a mate guilty of homosexual acts must be determined on the basis of what the Bible says (or what our current interpretation is) respecting divorce and remarriage. In homosexual acts, the sex organs are used in an unnatural way, in a way for which they were never purposed. Two persons of the same sex are not complements of each other, as Adam and Eve were. They could never become “one flesh” in order to procreate. It might be added, in the case of human copulation with a beast, two different kinds of flesh are involved. Wrote the apostle Paul: ‘Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, and there is another flesh of cattle, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish.’—1 Cor. 15:39. While both homosexuality and bestiality are disgusting perversions, in this case NEITHER ONE IS THE MARRIAGE TIE BROKEN. It is broken only by acts that make an individual “one flesh” with a person of the opposite sex other than his or her legal marriage mate.”*

Wow, there you have it. Your mate could be having sex with farm animals, but that does not break the marriage tie. So according to the wisdom and guidance from the from *god's organization*, a *good* Christian wife would have share her marriage bed with a goat or another man, if her husband wanted a threesome. With no recourse to her but comply.

You can't make this stuff up folks.

A few years later, guess what? After thousands of people’s lives were destroyed by the societies’ toxic *new light,* the Society changed its tune once again. What a surprise. Now you can get a divorce and remarry if your mate had sex with someone of the same sex or with farm animals.

Yes, the *new light* kicked in once again and canceled out the old *new light*. What do you think? Was it god who changed his mind once again? Or maybe god has nothing to do with the insanity that this organization puts out there!

Welcome to the *Twilight Zone.*

Is it any surprise the society is doing everything in its power to get rid of all these older publications from public records. So people can't research the old *new light* and the new *old new light.*

Of Course sadly, many of the people who are disfellowshipped for adultery every year are not the abusers in the relationship. They are the victims. The abuser doesn’t want to leave god’s *loving organization* by divorcing their spouse. So, what they do is pretty much drive their spouse into adultery. This has happened thousands of times over the years. Is there mercy for the victims of this kind of abuse? No, the rules are clear; so, in the vast majority of cases these victims are disfellowshipped and shunned. Leaving the abuser in *good standing.*

After being disfellowshipped, the poor victims who what back into the insanity must to sit in the back of the Kingdom Hall for months or even years, waiting to be reinstated and accepted back into *god’s loving fold.* The adulterer doesn’t have to wear a large scarlet letter “A” on their clothes but, they might as well for how they are treated.

Moving right along. If we look at the story of my Father-in-Law Bob and his crazy wife Elaine, I’d say Bob made the right move in the question of staying married to Elaine or getting disfellowshipped. He dumped a bad marriage and a bad religion all in one move. Happy ending for Bob? No, because it would cost him his relationship with his only two children Debbie and Mike and of course all of his grandchildren.

A short time after her divorce to Bob, Elaine married Ben Reagan, and they moved 1,500 miles away to Ruston, Louisiana. After the move, she made Debbie and her brother write a letter to Bob. The letter said they had no desire to see him ever again. That was their mother’s idea, of course, sweet woman that she was. For poor Bob, it probably looked like he would have no only future with his Jehovah’s Witness children.

Fast forward ten years and Bob would be getting a break in 1974, with this wonderful *new light* we got at the district convention.

After Roy’s wedding we drove to my parents’ house in Southern California. From there we went to San Jose for the long awaited reunion with Debbie’s Father.

Debbie was so excited to see her father, who she loved so much. The love I saw between those two was amazing. When they met, it was like a scene out of a movie. Father and daughter united again in love, after all these years. I found him to be a very sweet and kind person, nothing like Debbie’s psycho mother.

How strange to be sitting in his living room while we were showing Bob and his wife Donna a slide show of our wedding pictures. Bob had this big smile on his face, smoking his pipe. He was seeing his own daughter’s wedding for the first time—the wedding he was banished from and wasn’t even invited to attend.

I wondered what Donna was thinking. I’m sure she must have thought we were sick and sadistic people. We didn’t invite this poor man to his only daughter’s wedding. Then we came into their home and showed him the pictures of a wedding from which he was shunned.

I’m sure Donna couldn’t wait to join Bob’s old religion. The religion that brags about how much love they have for everyone.

We spent a whole week at their house. I’m sure Debbie was looking forward to having a relationship again with her long-lost father. I was looking forward to having a real father-in-law and not Ben the village idiot.

After we left Bob’s house, we had been in California for almost a month. We then headed to Idaho to see Gary Kennedy and his wife Ann Marie. Then we headed east again. After two months on the road, we were back in Rhode Island. We were broke and heading into our first New England winter with little to no work.

It was tough. I worked odd jobs with my friend, Jack. We cleaned carpets, painted and even went to the city dump and picked through trash for stuff we could sell at yard sales. We both heated our homes with wood, so we put a small ad in the city paper for FREE tree removal. This would be free fuel for our pot-belly stoves.

We went to one lady’s house in a really nice neighborhood on a cold winter’s day. She wanted us to cut down this large oak tree that was just a foot away from her carport. She said she had received a bid for more than four hundred dollars to do the job, so she was happy to see us. Normally, we would have never accepted this kind of job. However, since the tree was on a hill and leaning away from the house, Jack and I figured we would take the chance. The tree came down with a crash. It missed the carport but it did destroy two smaller fruit trees and put a big dent in her grass and yard. We started cutting up the tree as fast as we could, throwing the wood in my van. We took the firewood we wanted and left the rest of the limbs and debris. She could see we were getting ready to leave so she came running down the hill in a panic.

“Where in the hell are you guys going?”

“We have another job to do, so we got to go.”

“You guys did a number on my yard! Just look at these two trees you destroyed and what about all this trash that is still here!”

“We’re really sorry about the trees, but since it was free, we don’t include yard clean-up, too. By the way, what did you expect for free?”

We did feel really bad about her yard. I guess it is true, you get what you pay for.

In 1975, I scraped enough money together to buy a *Trim Line* franchise. This was a car-customizing company that was started and owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses. My days of picking through the dump and free-tree removal were over.

In 1976, Bob and Donna came to Rhode Island to see us. Debbie and her brother really put the sale on him to come back into *the truth* and the home of the *new light.* He just couldn’t do it. I think he was afraid. He was afraid that if he screwed up again, the love would be yanked away from him one more time. As it turned out, he would have been right. Plus, Donna hated Jehovah’s Witnesses for some odd reason. So how does one choose between his kids or his wife? This hell is experienced by many people in the same circumstances.

We had moved into a small bungalow across the street from Indian Lake. Bob and Donna parked their travel trailer on our property and stayed with us for over a month. We had a great time together during that visit. Bob and Donna left and headed back to California.

We stayed in Rhode Island for four years. I sold my *Trim Line distributorship* to my friend David McFarlane and his wife Cheryl. We bought another distributorship in Northern Louisiana and Southern Arkansas known as *Trim Line of Ark-La*.

After the “The Blizzard of ‘78” in Rhode Island in 1978, we moved to Farmerville, Louisiana. Debbie had been raised in Ruston, and we were ready for a change.

Farmerville had one gas station and one restaurant. The biggest thrill was coming home from work every day and going by the bank and reading the time and temperature.

Farmerville, Louisiana, was thirty miles northeast of Ruston. It was a really small country town.

Debbie had grown up in Ruston and had known many people there. The two people who proved to be like parents to Debbie as she was growing up were JoAnn and Jack Needham, who basically started the Farmerville Congregation. I must say, I loved Jack Needham, too. I wasn’t real close to my MIA non-Jehovah’s Witness father. So, Jack was the closest thing I had to a real father.

Jack always had a smile on his face. He looked quite dapper with his grey hair and handlebar mustache. He looked just like a Royal Air Force pilot. Come to find out, he had been in the RAF during the war.

Jack had lots of great stories about the war. He had been shot down over Nazi Germany in 1943. He told me how some German night-fighters shot his Sterling Short Bomber down while they were on a bombing run over Cologne on July 4th. He was the bombardier on that mission. The twenty-millimeter cannon shells had put large holes through his bomber. There was no lights or hydraulics, and the plane had lost all forward motion. It was now free falling straight down. Jack couldn’t crawl back to the rear of the plane. He found a large hole in the plane from one of the cannon shells and proceeded to crawl out through the hole. His clothes and parachute were ripped on the jagged metal as he climbed through the hole and out of the plane. He was now falling straight down next to the destroyed bomber at the same rate of speed. There was no way he could deploy his parachute just a few feet away from the burning plane as it fell. He took his leg and pushed as hard as he could against the fuselage of the plane. Slowly he drifted away from the burning bomber. He said as soon as he was about twenty feet from the wing tip, he yanked the rip cord. He said that at the same moment he did this, he saw the tops of the pine trees. It yanked him up but he still hit the ground with a terrible force. He broke both ankles and lost most of his teeth. The burning bomber crashed not too far away. He was captured immediately and spent the rest of the war in a prison camp.

Jack was actually in Stalag 3 during the war. This was the same Stalag, a German prison camp, that was in the movie *The Great Escape.*

Jack was a rebel, and he would receive more flack later on in life because he refused to shave his mustache. I found out later the only reason he had a mustache was to cover up some nasty scars he got from his plane crash in the war. Beards or mustaches weren’t allowed in the Society back then if you wanted to be an Elder or a Pioneer. This of course before they got the *new light* about facial hair in 2023.

Jack broke their rules about that, but they still made him an Elder. He was his own man.

The rules at Bethel were: you are allowed mustaches if you are Black, but no beards. If you are white, mustaches and beards aren’t allowed, period.

Anyway back to the Debbie and Bob her father's reunion.

Debbie and I bought a little 1920s’ bungalow on Bernice Street in Farmerville.

In 1978, Bob came to Louisiana to visit us and our daughter, Kelly, his first grandchild. Because of the new policy changes, Bob was even allowed to go to his own son’s wedding in a Kingdom Hall in Louisiana.

Yes, the *new light* would allow for that sort of kindness now. This *new light* seemed very reasonable. Back then, I thought, who knows? - Maybe Jehovah is really directing things back at the headquarters.

At his son Mike’s wedding, Bob told Elaine what a great job she did in raising their children. It looked like maybe my church could be kind, loving and forgiving at times now.

But all good things come to an end. Just like the policy of sex with farm animals and divorce, god had changed his mind once again. 

A few years later, the *light got brighter.* In 1981, the Society said we were going back to the “old way” or the “*old new light,*” which was not the *“new light”* they received back in 1974. This *new light* would, of course, cancel out the *old new light* of dealing with those who are disfellowshipped. We were all told we had to go back to the old way of dealing with disfellowshipped people by shunning them and treating them like dead people once again.

This *new light* is still enforced to this very day. However, they say people are *removed now* instead of disfellowshipped. They are still treated the same shitty way. 

Personally, I think and I'm just guessing, that this *new light* change about of how we dealt with disfellowshipped ones, was because of what had happened to Ray Franz at Bethel. The timing was exactly the same.

The society didn't want anyone talking to people like Ray and the many others that left Bethel with him. These people had information that could seriously destroy the society's credibility. Of course they couldn't say you could have limited association with some disfellowshipped ones but not others. So, of course they went back to the old way of shunning everyone who left.

This policy would ending up destroying thousands of people's lives and my Father in-law Bob would be one of them.

One day in 1981, Bob called us up. We were living in Oregon then. Bob said he wanted to come up to Oregon for a visit, to see us and his only grandkids, my children. Poor Bob didn’t know about the *new light* yet.

I said, “Come on up Bob. We would love to see you.” Debbie grabbed the phone out of my hand and told him that he wasn’t welcome anymore and that he couldn’t come up for anymore visits.

Bob was, of course, very upset with the organization’s *new light.* This meant that he would be losing his family once again. For many years, he wasn’t allowed to see his own children. Then the Society gave him his family back. But now they had taken his family away from him for good.

Debbie wouldn’t talk or see him anymore, but my thoughtful and loving wife did send her father a subscription to *The Watchtower and Awake magazines*. So now, at least twice a month, Bob would receive *spiritual food* in the mail from the people who kept taking his family away from him.

For some odd reason, the magazines couldn’t replace the companionship and love he could have received from his family.

She should have sent a note along with them that read:

*Sorry Dad we can’t talk to you anymore or have anything to do with you... until you join our cult. But Dad, please read our magazines! The magazines will tell you about how much love we have in our organization for each other... but just not you. Because of drinking the Kool-Aid they have given us, we have pushed you out of our minds and can't think about you anymore.*

Isn't that what really happened?

Bob never did visit us again, and we had little-to-no contact with him for many years.

Robert Stillman, was a man with no possibility of ever seeing his children and only his only grandchildren ever again.

I have no idea what was going through Bob’s mind that night in 1993, as he set on his couch and picked up a .38 special from the coffee table next to him and blew his brains out.

Yes, one more casualty of the *new light* and the *blood guilty* Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society.

To this day, I don’t think Debbie or her brother Mike feel any responsibility for his demise. Why would they? My wife didn’t make the decision to shun her father; her church did that for her. She was just a good Christian soldier following orders.

However, I do feel responsibility. This is the second time in my life that I just stood back and did nothing. Someone I knew was suffering, to the point that he felt death was his only option.

Where was I? I just stood on the side lines yet again and gave myself excuses about how my religion had the right to destroy one more person yet again.

They say a person is as much responsible for the *evil he commits in the world as the evil he permits.* That was me.

So I'm not letting myself off the hook. I'm because of my compliance *blood guilty* too!

I'm not going to sugar coat this my friends, because I have been there too. The truth is, that everyday you are part of this nasty organization and stand back and do nothing when you see countless numbers of people around you suffering, you too are guilty as I was by my association, by my complacency.

The term “*blood guilty”* comes to mind. However, the Jehovah’s Witnesses use this term another way.

Since guilt is such a wonderful tool used by the Jehovah’s Witnesses, one of the terms they love to use is *“blood guilty.”* They have actually used this term to guilt their members into doing more and more *Field Service.* They have told us on numerous occasions at the Kingdom Halls and other major gatherings that a person could be *blood guilty* for not going out in *Field Service* activity enough.

The reason is this. Because you didn’t go out in Field Service on Saturday, Mr. Sinner never got a chance to hear the Jehovah’s Witness’s message about the coming destruction of all the bad people. Because Mr. Sinner never heard this message, it means there is a high probability he and his family won’t join the religion. Because he didn’t join the only true religion, he is still a sinner. Jehovah now has no choice but to kill Mr. Sinner, his wife and their two small children at Armageddon. However, even though Mr. Sinner and his family are killed by god, you are the one that is now *blood guilty* because you never knocked on his door in the first place. Now of course, Jehovah holds YOU accountable for their deaths! So even though Jehovah did all the killing, you are the real reason this happened.

Do you see the logic here? Let’s take this one step further. I stopped doing door-to-door work over twenty years ago. Does that mean all those hundreds of people with whom I never had the chance to share the message of salvation in the last twenty years will now die at Armageddon because I left the organization many years ago?

I guess I’m along with everyone else on the planet are *blood guilty* whether I’m in their organization or not. Confusing isn't it? I’m sure they will come up with some more *“new light”* about all this a few years from now.

Doesn’t this just sound like some form of insanity?

Anyway, back to Debbie and her dead dad. Debbie wanted to be with her father one more time, or at least part of him. She was nice enough to go to California to help Bob’s wife, Chloe, spread his ashes down a canyon wall. I wondered what Chloe thought about Debbie wanting to be with her father and helping with his disposal, now that he was dead, though she didn’t want to associate with him while he was living.

Let's face it guys, for people on the outside of the Jehovah's Witnesses club/religion and looking in, the Jehovah's Witnesses look and act insane!

Here is another crazy pill. Check this out.

At the time of his death, the only thing Bob was doing that wasn’t in line with the Society’s rules and regulations was smoking. He wasn’t living in sin or doing any other type of gross immorality, but because he left the organization back in 1958, thirty-five years earlier, he could no longer have association with his children or grandchildren.

Yet my father, who left the organization back in 1961, was still smoking at the time of Bob’s death. I’m sure my father was fornicating, stealing and just about anything else you can think of back then. Yet he could come up to visit his children and his grandchildren anytime he liked and did many times.

How could that be? How could he do that?

Because he was no longer disfellowshipped; he was reinstated back in 1965. However, after he was reinstated, he just dropped out for good, or *faded away* as the Witnesses like to call it nowadays.

Just one of the many loopholes and double standards that they don’t want you to know about. Another *Catch 22.*

This whole disfellowshipping and shunning policy was something that Knorr and Freddy Franz dreamt up back in March of 1951. At that time, Knorr gave the Witnesses the *new light*, which led to hundreds of thousands of people being disfellowshipped and thus shunned in the years to come. Disfellowshipping didn’t even exist in the first seventy five years of this organization’s history. The word itself, disfellowship, doesn’t even exist in the Bible.

Even though Knorr has been dead for over forty seven years, his policies continue to kill people and destroy families to this very day.

How many lives has this cruel shunning policy taken? How many families has it destroyed?

The *new light* is funny stuff. Sometimes it gets brighter, then dark, then bright again. But one thing is true about the *new light*. It is never, ever is wrong!

Right?

I guess Jehovah gets confused at times and just can’t decide which way to go.

Or on the other hand maybe god has nothing to do with *the Society’s* decisions.

What if eight old guys who call themselves the *Governing Body* back in New York are making this shit up as they go along? It kind of looks that way.

How could those eight guys and the nine million people they lead be wrong in their thinking?

I guess the same way ninety million Nazis could be wrong back in World War Two. It's easy once you are sucked in to go along with the program no matter how insane it is.

It’s amazing the crazy shit a few guys, meeting in a basement in a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania church back in the 1870's, or in a German beer hall in Munich, in the 1920's can come up with.

*Seig Heil!*

Like the quote from the movie *Prometheus says: ""Little things turn into big things""*

And bid them farewell.
Until the moonlight slinks beyond
The streets where the morning's bright brow furrows and turns to,
The same precious dismay that she
Pours over her hands as she rinses her coffee,
The height where she can smell its warmth and her icicle lungs smoulder like you and ash thaws,
Who knows what for?

Her love, a door shown, a voice thrown, embattled, against a pier that guards what the hearts tighten against, sooner than what has been, she waits with bated breath, and never forgets:

Like you never forget the first requited love's final torment,
And how she read its palm, before yours.
And how she wanted you like a pet wants a backyard burial.

Secondary victims pay the price of living
So you don't write in first person anymore.
But the motion sickness you feel still,
Is what holds a candle to what came before.

You can kiss her 
goodnight,
And bid her farewell.

And kiss her.

We've had our usual ups and downs that a relationship goes through. For the past few months our relationship has been really struggling. Like non stop arguments, a lot of distance and just not a very nice atmosphere within the house. 

For background. We both work from home and work the same amount of hours a day. 

My partner is wanting me to give her more affection, intimacy, ect. She doesn't think that I like her, love her or want to be around her. She says her need aren't being met and that she's trying to put effort to save the relationship. 

On my side, I don't feel like my needs are being met. I take a lot of the household responsibilities and we frequently have arguments about the household chores. For example my partner just leaves her clothes hanging out of her wardrobe, she will leave pots wherever she goes, food wrappers, dirty q tips on the side, she leaves the toilets dirty, doesn't clean up her mess or help clean up the household mess without me mentioning something or us having an argument over it. I'm always the one to get up on a morning to let the dog out (she also starts work at 8am, gets up around 8.30, i dont start until 9am and get up around 7/ 7.30 for the dog),I also do training with him and feed him. My needs aren't being met, I just want her to bring me a cup of coffee, to tell me to go jump in the shower and that she'll sort the house and dog for the last half hour before his bed time, for her to tell me to go bed to bed on a morning because she'll go let the dog out. I just want to feel like my partner is tackling life with me and not that she's making it more difficult and adding more chores to my plate. This isn't a recent thing, I've been meeting her needs for a while past my needs not being met. But it's getting too much where I might have distanced myself, I might not want to be as affectionate and im not withholding affection as payback. 

We have discussions about her helping snd she will make an effort for a short time but sometimes it just doesn't feel like it's enough. She might fill and empty the dishwasher, cut the grass, clean the floors but its just not enough sometimes. She still doesn't wake for the dog and he's the only reason I get out of bed on a morning. Some days I don't get to sit down and relax until I go up to bed. 

I'm not really pissed that she doesnt help around the house. It's the fact that she doesn't think about me in this scenario to want to help and take the weight off. She doesnt think to get up earlier than she does to help sort the dog before work, she doesnt think to take her pots down so they don't fo mouldy (then I have to bin them), she doesnt think to pick up her shit from the floor so I don't have to or to be able to sort out the kitchen or tidy up a bit more so I can jump in the shower, relax and unwind slightly. 

It's caused a lot of distance and I don't know what else to do.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The Ajax dish soap lineup boasts a range of features designed to deliver effective and efficient cleaning.

**Grease-Cutting Power:** Ajax dish soaps are formulated with powerful surfactants that break down grease and oil, making it easier to remove stubborn food residue from dishes, pots, and pans.

The specific formulations vary across different Ajax products, but the core focus remains on delivering exceptional grease-cutting capabilities. This feature is particularly beneficial for households that frequently cook with oily or greasy foods.

**Long-Lasting Suds:** Many Ajax dish soaps are designed to produce rich, long-lasting suds that help lift dirt and grime from surfaces.

This feature ensures that the soap remains effective throughout the dishwashing process, reducing the need for frequent reapplication. The suds also help to suspend the dirt and grease, preventing them from redepositing onto the dishes.

**Pleasant Scent:** Ajax offers a variety of scents, from classic lemon to refreshing orange and other floral or herbal options.

These scents not only mask unpleasant odors but also leave your dishes smelling clean and fresh. The availability of different scents allows you to choose one that suits your personal preferences.

**Concentrated Formula:** Ajax dish soaps are typically highly concentrated, meaning that a small amount of soap can go a long way.

This concentration makes the product more economical, as you don't need to use as much soap per load of dishes. It also reduces the amount of packaging waste generated.

**Gentle on Hands (Select Variants):** While traditionally known for its strong cleaning power, some Ajax dish soap variants are now formulated to be gentler on hands.

These variants often contain moisturizing ingredients that help to prevent dryness and irritation, making them suitable for individuals with sensitive skin. Look for labels indicating ""gentle on hands"" or ""dermatologist tested"".

**Effective Stain Removal:** Ajax dish soaps can also be effective at removing certain types of stains from dishes and utensils.

This includes stains from coffee, tea, and other common food items. The powerful cleaning agents in the soap help to break down the stain molecules, making them easier to wash away.

Key features of Ajax dish soap include:
    * Powerful grease-cutting action
    * Long-lasting suds
    * Variety of pleasant scents
    * Concentrated formula for economy
    * Some variants are gentle on hands

 ## FAQs Section

**Is Ajax dish soap safe for septic systems?**

Generally, Ajax dish soap is considered safe for septic systems when used in moderation. However, it's crucial to avoid excessive use, as large amounts of soap can potentially disrupt the balance of bacteria in the septic tank. Always follow the recommended dosage instructions on the product label.

**Can Ajax dish soap be used to wash fruits and vegetables?**

While Ajax dish soap is designed for cleaning dishes, it is not specifically formulated for washing fruits and vegetables. It is recommended to use dedicated fruit and vegetable washes for this purpose, as they are specifically designed to remove dirt, pesticides, and other contaminants without leaving harmful residues.

**Does Ajax dish soap contain phosphates?**

The presence of phosphates in Ajax dish soap can vary depending on the specific product and regional regulations. Many modern formulations are phosphate-free to minimize environmental impact. Check the product label for information on phosphate content.

**How can I maximize the effectiveness of Ajax dish soap?**

To maximize the effectiveness of Ajax dish soap, use hot water whenever possible, as it helps to dissolve grease and food residue more effectively. Also, avoid using excessive amounts of soap, as this can lead to excessive suds and difficulty rinsing. Pre-soaking heavily soiled dishes can also improve cleaning results.

## Key features Analysis

The latest 32 oz water bottles showcase a range of technological and design advancements aimed at enhancing the user experience and promoting consistent hydration.**Material Durability**

The use of high-quality materials is paramount in creating a durable and long-lasting water bottle.Many leading 32 oz bottles in 2025 utilize Tritan copolyester, a BPA-free plastic known for its impact resistance and clarity. Some premium models incorporate stainless steel, offering superior durability and temperature retention. This ensures the bottle can withstand daily wear and tear, whether you're at the gym, in the office, or outdoors.

**Insulation Technology**

Advanced insulation technology is essential for maintaining the temperature of your beverages.Double-walled vacuum insulation is a common feature in high-end 32 oz water bottles, effectively keeping drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. The vacuum layer minimizes heat transfer, ensuring your water stays refreshingly cold even in warm environments, or your coffee remains hot during chilly mornings.

**Leak-Proof Lid Design**

A reliable, leak-proof lid is critical for preventing spills and messes. Current models feature innovative lid designs with silicone seals and locking mechanisms. These lids are engineered to withstand pressure and prevent leaks, even when the bottle is jostled in a bag or during physical activity. Some lids also include convenient features like one-handed operation and integrated carrying loops.

**Ergonomic Design**

Ergonomics plays a significant role in the user-friendliness of a water bottle. Bottles are now designed with contoured shapes and textured surfaces to provide a agreeable and secure grip. this ergonomic design makes it easier to hold and carry the bottle, reducing the risk of drops. Some bottles also feature wide-mouth openings for easy filling and cleaning.

**Integrated filter Systems**

For those concerned about water quality, some 32 oz water bottles offer integrated filter systems. these filters can remove impurities, chlorine, and odors from tap water, providing cleaner and better-tasting hydration.Filter systems usually employ activated carbon or other advanced filtration technologies to effectively purify water on the go. This feature is especially useful for hiking, camping, or traveling in areas with questionable water sources.

**Smart Hydration Tracking**

Emerging water bottle technologies are integrating smart features to help users track their hydration habits. Some bottles connect to mobile apps via Bluetooth and monitor water intake throughout the day.These smart bottles can send reminders to drink more water and provide personalized hydration recommendations based on activity level and environmental conditions. This technology promotes mindful hydration and helps users achieve their daily water goals.

## Core Benefits

Using a high-quality 32 oz water bottle provides numerous benefits that contribute to a healthier and more convenient lifestyle.

**Improved Hydration:** Consistently drinking water from a 32 oz bottle makes it easier to meet daily hydration goals. By having a readily available source of water, you're more likely to stay hydrated throughout the day, which can improve energy levels, cognitive function, and overall health. For example, keeping a filled 32 oz water bottle on your desk can serve as a visual reminder to take regular sips.

**Reduced Plastic Waste:** Using a reusable water bottle significantly reduces your reliance on single-use plastic bottles. This reduces plastic waste and minimizes environmental impact. Over time, this eco-pleasant choice contributes to a more enduring lifestyle and reduces the amount of plastic ending up in landfills and oceans.

**Cost Savings:** Investing in a durable and reusable 32 oz water bottle eliminates the need to purchase disposable water bottles regularly. This can result in considerable cost savings over time. Rather of spending money on bottled water every day, you can simply refill your reusable bottle with tap water or filtered water.

**Enhanced Convenience:** A 32 oz water bottle provides ample hydration for several hours, reducing the need for frequent refills. This is particularly convenient for people who are on the go,whether they're at work,exercising,or traveling.

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean my 32 oz water bottle effectively?**

Cleaning your water bottle thoroughly is essential for maintaining hygiene and preventing bacteria growth. Most 32 oz bottles can be cleaned using warm water and dish soap. Use a bottle brush to scrub the inside and ensure all surfaces are clean. For hard-to-reach areas or stubborn stains, you can use a mixture of baking soda and water, or a specialized bottle cleaning tablet.Rinse thoroughly after washing and allow the bottle to air dry completely.

**Are all 32 oz water bottles dishwasher safe?**

Not all 32 oz water bottles are dishwasher safe. Always check the manufacturer's instructions before placing your bottle in the dishwasher. Stainless steel bottles without painted exteriors are generally safe for the dishwasher, but plastic bottles may warp or become damaged if exposed to high heat. Hand washing is often the safest option to prolong the lifespan of your water bottle.**Can I use my 32 oz water bottle for both hot and cold beverages?**

Many 32 oz water bottles, especially those with double-walled insulation, are designed for both hot and cold beverages. However, it's important to consider the material of the bottle. Stainless steel bottles are typically safe for hot and cold liquids, while some plastic bottles may not be suitable for hot beverages due to potential chemical leaching. Always follow the manufacturer's guidelines regarding temperature limits.

**What are some common signs that I need to replace my 32 oz water bottle?**

several signs indicate that it's time to replace your water bottle. these include visible cracks, significant dents, persistent odors, or discoloration. If the bottle's lid is no longer leak-proof, or if the insulation is no longer effective at maintaining temperature, it's also time for a replacement. Regularly inspect your bottle for wear and tear to ensure it's safe and hygienic to use.

He Took My Body, Then Called My Sister’s Name
👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter1
The moment the SATs were over, I slept with Chase Walker for the first time.

In the heat of it all, I gasped out loud—only to hear him whisper a name that wasn’t mine.

“Maddie…”

But my name is Sierra. Maddie is my twin sister.

I blinked, stunned, and looked up at him. “Who did you just say?”

Chase kept moving, lowering his head to kiss my eyelids. “Sierra,” he murmured, his voice thick, “don’t get distracted. You’re enjoying this, right?”

His rhythm quickened, driving away every ounce of doubt I had left.

Chase was a jock—strong, tireless, and always creative. My body trembled uncontrollably beneath him. I tried to push him away. “Don’t…”

He leaned into my ear, voice hoarse with desire. “Baby, let’s try it on top this time.”

That night, he wore me down—again and again—until I was crying, begging, shaking, and still he didn’t stop.

Not until sunrise did he finally stumble into the bathroom, satisfied.

I lay there, too sore to move, my limbs aching like they didn’t belong to me.

Then his phone on the nightstand started blowing up with notification pings.

Instinctively, I glanced at the screen—and froze.

[Congrats, Walker! You finally got some last night!]

My heart dropped. I couldn’t stop myself. I unlocked his phone and opened the group chat.

What I saw made my entire body go numb.

He’d sent a photo of the bloodstained hotel bedsheet. In the middle of the night.

The messages came in a flood:

[Holy crap, Chase—you really did it with Sierra? I thought you were into Maddie?]

[C’mon, they’re twins. Same face, same body. He’s just warming up with Sierra before he goes all in with Maddie. Practice makes perfect, right?]

[Exactly. He’s in love with Maddie. Sierra’s just a stand-in so he doesn’t screw it up with the real thing.]

Every word felt like a slap.

I’d spent hours wondering why Chase liked me. I’d imagined a thousand reasons—none of them this.

Chase wasn’t just a jock. He was the school's golden boy, surrounded by friends and admiration.

I was the quiet one. The bookworm everyone ignored.

We shouldn’t have had anything in common. But one day back in junior year, during gym, I’d accidentally bled through my pants from my period.

Chase had taken off his team jacket and wrapped it around my waist.

Since then, he’d left breakfast on my desk every morning. Tucked handwritten notes in my school loker.

I’d fallen—hard. But I never understood why someone like him would choose someone like me.

So one day I asked, “What do you like about me?”

He smiled and said, “Because you’re you.”

That first love, the kind you believe will last forever—I’d given it my all.

I thought losing my virginity to him meant something.

Turns out, it was just a performance. A carefully orchestrated “first time,” for his benefit.

I clenched my fists so tightly my knuckles turned white, my palms streaked with red. But nothing hurt more than my heart.

The water stopped running. I rushed to put his phone back and pretend nothing happened.

The door opened. Chase walked out, dripping water, a towel slung low on his hips. His tanned skin glistened with drops, muscles sculpted and bare.

“You’re up. Hungry?”

He came to the bed, voice gentle, eyes dark with something I couldn’t name. He glanced down at the bruises on my collarbone.

I couldn’t answer. All I could hear was the echo of his voice last night—calling me Maddie.

“I’m not hungry.”

He saw the redness at the corners of my eyes and immediately pulled me into his arms. “Did I hurt you? I didn’t mean to—I just… I was new to this. I’ll get better. We can keep practicing.”

His hand slid under my shirt again.

I flinched away. “Don’t. I’m sore.”

He paused, then slowly smoothed down my wrinkled collar, his voice soft with guilt. “I lost control last night. Have some rest, I’ll go downstairs and grab you breakfast.”

He got dressed and left.

I stared at the blood on the white sheets and felt my entire body go hollow.

For two years, we’d been secretly dating. I’d hidden everything from my teachers, from my friends. I did everything he asked, said yes to everything.

He wanted Columbia, so I made it my dream too.

He held my hand under the desk during class; I blushed and kept reciting vocab.

He asked to meet me behind the field after study hall; I gave him my first kiss.

Now the exams were over, he wanted a symbolic “rite of passage,” and I gave him everything.

I thought it was love.

But it was just rehearsal.

If Maddie was who he loved from the beginning, then I didn’t want to love him anymore. I didn’t want to be the stand-in.

I got dressed and left the hotel.

At a pharmacy down the street, I awkwardly asked the clerk for emergency contraceptive pills.

She eyed me up and down, frowning, and pulled a box from the shelf. “You should’ve had your boyfriend use protection. These are awful for your body, you know.”

My face burned. I could barely speak.

There were condoms in the drawer beside the bed. I’d told Chase to grab a box.

But he’d just moaned in my ear, red-eyed and desperate.

“Sierra… it feels weird with that stuff on. Please, just this once. I swear I won’t go too far.”

I gave in.

And now here I was, buying back my freedom one pill at a time.

“Thanks,” I told the clerk as I paid. “Just this once.”

Never again.

Never again would I believe anything Chase Walker said.

Chapter2
I had barely stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard whispers behind me.

“Just like a hooker.”

“She looked so sweet… But...Unbelievable.”

Their words lashed across my face like a whip, burning hot from my cheeks all the way to my chest.

I hurried away, clutching the paper bag, my vision blurring. At the bus stop, I washed down the white pill with a bottle of water.

I drank too fast. The water caught in my throat, and I started coughing so hard my eyes watered.

“Sierra!”

Chase came running up, out of breath, worry etched into every feature.

“Why’d you leave the hotel without telling me? I texted, I called. Where have you been?”

The way he said it—like I was the one being cruel—it almost made me laugh.

Almost.

But all I felt was this sharp, twisting ache in my chest.

“I went to buy emergency contraception,” I said, holding up the now-empty pill box.

His expression faltered. Embarrassment crept into his eyes.

“You could’ve told me. Or let me go get it. I was worried.”

I didn’t want to argue over this. “It won’t happen again.”

He sensed something was off. He reached for my hand. “I’m sorry I lost control last night. I’ll be more careful next time.”

Then he smiled. “Hey, the Class President is throwing a graduation party at Capital Square. Come with me?”

I pulled my hand back. “No one knows we’re together. It’s better if we go separately.”

Chase stiffened. After a moment, he nodded.

“Okay. I’ll grab a cab.”

I didn’t reply. I just got on the next bus.

He had promised we’d go public after the SATs.

But for the past few days, while he chatted away in the group chat, not once had he mentioned me.

And I’d already seen the truth in that secret text thread with his friends.

There was no relationship to announce.

By the time I got to the private dining room at Capital Square, the place was packed.

Maddie, dressed in a pink Lolita-style dress, sat surrounded like some Disney princess. Chase was right next to her, peeling cherries and handing them to her one by one.

A few classmates started teasing, “Chase, you’ve been so good to the Prom Queen all year. You better shoot your shot before college. Once you get to Columbia, there’ll be too many options!”

Everyone had seen how good Chase was to Maddie.

Even though he was secretly dating me, publicly, he was always by Maddie’s side—helping her clean up after class, saving her a spot in the lunch line, carrying her books.

He was even the one who rallied the guys to vote her Prom Queen.

But we were twins. We looked almost identical.

Back then, he’d explained, “Maddie’s got a weaker constitution. People tend to bully her. You’re stronger, Sierra. You have me.”

I actually believed it. I believed he loved me so much, he was kind to my sister too.

Looking back now, I was embarrassingly naive. How could I have missed such a lame excuse?

I pushed the door open and walked in.

Chase looked up. His expression didn’t change—not even a flicker of guilt.

Maddie immediately stood and rushed to my side. “Sierra! You didn’t come home last night. Mom and Dad were freaking out. Where were you?”

Everyone turned to look at me, whispering behind their drinks.

“Seriously? Hooking up with someone the night after SATs? Yikes.”

“Thought she was a brainiac. Guess she’s wild behind the scenes.”

Maddie wore a look of innocent concern, but her eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

I saw right through her.

“It’s none of your business,” I said calmly, trying to walk past her.

But she latched onto my arm like a loving little sister. “Sit next to me. The seat is available.”

She tugged a little too hard, and my collar slipped.

The marks Chase had left on me the night before were on full display—bruised and violet, unmistakable.

Maddie gasped. “Sierra, what happened to you?”

Every gaze in the room locked onto me—shocked, curious, judgmental.

“So much for the innocent honor student…”

“Jesus, how rough was it? Look at those hickeys.”

“She’s not even dating anyone, is she? Must’ve been some random hookup after finals.”

Face burning, I yanked my collar back into place and turned instinctively toward Chase.

He didn’t even look at me.

He was still talking with Maddie, his face soft, gentle… like none of this had anything to do with him.

My heart hardened.

“It’s nothing,” I said coolly. “Got bit by a dog. I’m allergic.”

A worthless stray dog, at that.

Chapter3
Laughter erupted around the room as everyone joked about which mangy mutt had left those “bite marks” on me.

Chase’s face darkened. He knocked on the table. “Everyone’s here. Let’s get started.”

His voice cut through the noise instantly.

The Class President quickly stood up to ease the awkwardness. “Yeah, enjoy yourself. We’ll all be heading our separate ways soon—college, work, wherever. Might be the last time we’re all in the same room.”

People started sharing their summer plans.

Some were heading south for factory jobs. Some had graduation trips booked. Others were rushing to get their driver’s licenses.

Dinner wrapped up, and the party moved into a private karaoke lounge.

We played games. One of them was a dare.

Maddie got picked and had to choose a guy to give her a princess carry for a full minute.

The guys immediately started cheering. Maddie blushed and glanced at Chase. “Chase, can you help me?”

Without a word, Chase leaned down, one arm slipping behind her knees, muscles flexing as he lifted her effortlessly into the air.

“Hold on tight.”

Maddie let out a soft gasp, wrapping her arms around his neck, her laughter sugary-sweet.

“Damn, Walker’s a beast! No wonder he’s on varsity!”

I looked away, curling my fingers into fists beneath the table. I tried to pretend it didn’t bother me.

Then it was my turn.

The dare? Take three shots of vodka—or kiss any guy in the room.

The guys all grinned, already whispering.

I instinctively glanced at Chase.

He avoided my eyes.

“I already played knight tonight,” he said flatly. “I’m sitting out the rest.”

The words hit like a slap.

I picked up the shot glass and knocked it back.

Then another.

Then another.

The vodka burned down my throat like acid. My eyes stung. I stumbled out of the room and into the bathroom, barely making it to the sink before throwing it all up.

I splashed water on my face, rinsed my mouth over and over until the burning eased.

When I looked up, the mirror showed a mess.

Red eyes. Hair tangled. Collar askew, with faint bruises peeking out beneath the fabric.

I looked like a clown.

I tugged my clothes straight, brushed out my hair, and gave myself the most pathetic smile I could muster.

“Sierra Hayes,” I whispered, “pain teaches you lessons. You’ll be better because of this. Pull youself together.”

I didn’t go back into the room.

I texted the Class President that I was heading home and left.

On the bus, I pulled out my phone and opened our old iMessage thread.

[Sierra, I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?]

[Sierra, I couldn’t sleep again tonight. I kept thinking about you. I miss you.]

Dozens of sweet nothings. Dozens of selfies—Chase posing with his bike, dunking at the school court, us walking to school in our Westhaven High uniforms.

When I got a new phone last year, I refused to delete any of it.

But now…

With trembling fingers, I selected the entire chat.

6.9 GB. Delete?

Yes.

Everything we had—all our memories, all his empty words—were gone with a tap.

It was like we were never anything at all.

The bus pulled to a stop. I wiped my face and stood up.

I walked home.

The second I stepped through the front door, a sharp slap knocked me to the floor.

My ears rang.

“You shameless brat!” my father roared. “Staying out all night and drinking like some party girl? ”

Half my face throbbed with heat. My head spun as I looked up from the floor—only to see Maddie and Mom sitting on the couch, watching it all with smug satisfaction.

I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth.

“The Class President threw the party,” I rasped. “I only had a little, and I threw it all up. Maddie can vouch for me.”

But Maddie blinked, all innocence. “He did throw the party, but Sierra left halfway without saying anything. I can’t back her up.”

Mom’s face hardened.

“Sierra Hayes, how many times have I told you to learn from your sister? If you do, your father wouldn’t be this upset.”

I knelt on the floor, my cheek red and swollen.

They sat hand in hand on the sofa. Picture perfect.

My eyes drifted to the coffee table.

There sat a vacation contract: “Westhaven Students Celebrate SAT Success – 3-Person Family Trip to Cancun!”

My heart dropped.

My parents’ names were signed. So was Maddie’s.

“You’re taking Maddie on a trip… and leaving me behind?” I asked.

Mom’s eyes flickered. “Maddie won it in a school raffle. There are only three spots. We’re going with her because it’s fair.”

“You can stay home and think about your behavior. We’ll take you next time.”

I gave a cold smile. “And when exactly is next time?”

Maddie had always been the fragile one. The doctors said I’d stolen her nutrients in the womb.

Since then, my parents had spoiled her relentlessly.

When I won a doll in elementary school, Maddie said she liked it. Mom made me give it to her.

When there were only a few drumsticks or Buffalo wings left at dinner, Maddie got first pick. I got whatever was left.

Every time, Mom said, “Next time means next time. Be the bigger sister.”

But that “next time” never came.

She didn’t answer.

Dad raised his hand again, ready to strike.

“What? Go to your room. You’re grounded.”

I stumbled up the stairs, clutching the wall as pain echoed through my chest.

Not long after, a text came in from Mr. Carter.

[Sierra, come to school tomorrow morning. We’ll go over your SAT scores and work on your college major declaration.]

[Okay.]

I curled up in bed, holding the phone.

This was my chance.

College wasn’t just a way out—it was my way forward.

A chance to escape this family. To build something for myself.

Chapter4
Mr. Carter paused, clearly surprised by my request.

“You know the education resources in the Northwest aren’t anywhere near what Columbia offers. Why the sudden interest in moving out there?”

I gave him the answer I’d stayed up all night rehearsing. “I know. But I made my desicion.”

He looked at me with something like admiration, but still hesitated. “This is a huge decision, Sierra. Maybe talk it over with your parents?”

I shook my head, polite but firm. “I’m eighteen. Legally an adult. I want to make this decision on my own. And… I’d really appreciate it if you kept this private for now. I’m not ready for anyone else to know.”

Seeing how serious I was, Mr. Carter didn’t push back. He helped me fill out the application for the early admission program at Northwest Institute of Science and submitted it through the portal right then and there.

“You better start packing,” he said. “If everything goes smoothly, you’ll be leaving by the start of next month.”

I thanked him over and over before stepping out of the office.

And walked straight into Chase.

His eyes searched mine, emotions roiling beneath the surface. “Mr. Carter said you’re leaving. What’s he talking about? Where are you going?”

I didn’t want to explain. “He just meant college is starting soon. We’ll all be heading off in different directions.”

I kept walking, but he followed, sticking to my side as we descended the stairs.

“You didn’t send me a goodnight text last night. Were you mad? I didn’t mean to ignore you at the party—it’s just, everyone was teasing me about being with Maddie. I didn’t want to embarrass her.”

He reached out, trying to ruffle my hair like he always used to.

But I stepped away.

He froze.

I looked him right in the eye. “Chase, Maddie and I are twins. Have you ever stopped to think… maybe the one you liked all along was her?”

His expression shifted. “What? No. That’s not true. If I liked Maddie, why would I date you?”

“Sierra, I’m already yours, okay? You’re not trying to back out of this, are you?”

I held his gaze, heart pounding.

But before I could say anything more, a voice called from around the corner.

“Chase!” Maddie’s sweet, sing-song tone echoed down the hallway. “Didn’t you promise to help me go over my scores?”

Chase immediately turned. “Yeah! I’m coming!”

He looked back at me, apologetic. “I told Maddie I’d help her figure out her college options. Don’t overthink it. I’ll help you after, okay?”

Then he jogged off.

I didn’t say a word.

All I could do was watch him walk away.

As he and Maddie headed off together, the underclassmen couldn’t stop whispering.

“Chase and Maddie look so cute together.”

“I thought graduation season was when couples break up, not get sweeter.”

“I heard they’re both applying to Columbia.”

“Duh, they’re totally dating. My cousin was at their grad party last night—he saw them kissing.”

The words hit me like little darts.

So… after I left, they’d gone even further.

I guess I’d made the right call choosing the early admission program.

Once I left, Chase wouldn’t have to keep pretending.

And I wouldn’t have to watch it anymore.

I headed back to the dorms to pack.

In the bottom of my desk drawer, I found my old journal. The one I hadn’t touched in months.

Page after page was filled with memories of me and Chase—dates, fights, moments that had once felt unforgettable.

I tore each page out, one by one, and dropped them into the trash.

A photo slipped loose from between the pages—Chase, mid-air during a basketball game, looking like something out of a teen sports movie.

I bent down to pick it up, but someone beat me to it.

“Whoa—aren’t Chase and Maddie a thing now?” one girl said, holding the picture up.

“Sierra, why are you hiding his photo like some stalker ex?”

Another snickered. “Guess twins really do share everything—same face, same taste in guys.”

“Seriously, get a grip,” a third girl sneered. “Fantasizing about your sister’s boyfriend? Pathetic.”

I snatched the photo back, eyes cold. “Throwing out baseless rumors isn’t just immature—it’s defamation. I don’t like Chase. And I’m not the type to cling to other people’s leftovers.”

Right in front of all of them, I ripped the photo to pieces and tossed them out the window.

The fragments fluttered down like confetti, landing right on Chase’s shoulders as he passed by outside.

He looked up, confused.

His eyes met mine through the open window.

And just like that, the last thread between us snapped.

Chapter5
“Sierra Hayes, what’s your problem?” Chase’s tone held clear frustration.

I didn’t respond. Just turned away, calm and collected, and headed back to my dorm to keep packing.

He called me—multiple times. I didn’t pick up a single one.

Do Not Disturb mode: on.

When I finished gathering everything, I stepped out of the girls’ dorm and found Chase waiting right at the front entrance.

He held out his palm—filled with tiny shredded bits of a photo.

“Explain this.”

Under the sweltering sun, he’d stood there picking up every torn piece. Sweat rolled down his neck, that familiar scent of summer clinging to his skin.

I looked him dead in the eye and said coolly, “I was packing when one of my roommates saw it. You told me not to go public with our relationship, right? So I had no choice but to tear it up. Didn’t want to cause a scene.”

Chase faltered, clearly caught off guard. Some of his anger drained away.

“I’m not trying to hide you,” he said eventually. “It’s just… not the right time yet.”

“It’s fine. I understand,” I said, keeping my voice steady.

Deep down, I knew.

He was never really mine to begin with.

It was always Maddie.

Chase clearly didn’t want to argue. He shoved the photo scraps into his pocket and quickly pulled out a few SAT practice sheets. “Here, I got copies of this year’s test. Let’s go over it—I’ll help estimate your score.”

“No need,” I replied. “Mr. Carter already helped me with that.”

I brushed off his sudden kindness, slung my backpack over my shoulder, and walked toward the front gate.

He stood there watching me, not moving.

But I was done looking back.

As I walked down the gingko-lined avenue, the sound of cicadas mixed with the buzz of teachers giving lectures to the underclassmen.

I caught my last sunset at Westhaven High.

That was it.

My high school chapter had officially ended.

With the sky lit up in golden red, I turned toward the bus stop to head home.

Just as I stepped into the crosswalk, I heard the shrill ring of a bike bell.

Maddie.

She barreled straight toward me on her bike.

I barely had time to dodge, but—

BAM.

The collision knocked me flat. It felt like being punched full-force in the gut.

Maddie slammed straight into a steel ad board. The crash echoed loud, and she tumbled off her bike with a shriek.

“Mad!” Chase’s voice rang out from across the street.

He sprinted over, chest heaving, and went straight to her.

He helped Maddie up first.

“Sierra, what were you thinking?! Running in front of her like that—do you know how dangerous that was?!”

Blood trickled from the scrape on my knee, but I still managed to shout, “She swerved across the road and hit me!”

Maddie clung weakly to his arms, tears rolling down her cheeks.

“I just wanted to say hi to my sister… I didn’t mean to. The brakes stopped working, I couldn’t steer… I didn’t mean it.”

Chase’s voice instantly softened. “It’s okay, it’s okay. Let’s get you to the hospital.”

He was about to pick her up when several security guards ran over.

One pointed angrily at the toppled ad sign. “This board cost our company five thousand bucks to install! Someone better pay for this, and I mean full price.”

His eyes flicked between the three of us like a predator picking his prey.

Maddie stiffened in Chase’s arms—then pointed at me.

“It was her. She was riding the bike. She hit me, then crashed into your sign. If you’re looking for someone to pay, ask her.”

I stared at Maddie in disbelief.

She lied.

Right to their faces.

I turned to the guards. “It wasn’t me. She hit me. If you don’t believe me, ask this guy—he saw the whole thing!”

The guards looked to Chase. I looked to him too, praying he’d finally tell the truth.

After a long pause, he raised his hand and pointed.

“It was her,” he said.

He was pointing… at me.

Chapter6
Chase left with Maddie.

And I was left to deal with the security guards alone.

No matter how I explained, they wouldn’t listen.

They grabbed my student ID and barked, “Sierra Hayes, right? You better bring the money by tomorrow. If not, we’re reporting this to the School Board. One call, and they’ll cancel your SAT scores for misconduct.”

With that, they walked off, leaving me speechless.

I had no way to prove my innocence. So I went home, hoping to figure out a plan.

But as soon as I walked through the door, my mom exploded.

“Can you just be an adult for once? Hooking up in hotels, drinking, and now destroying public property? Grow up, Sierra!”

She threw a wad of cash at me.

“You’re mad because we didn’t take you on vacation, right? Fine. Take this and go pay them. We can’t afford more embarrassment.”

Maddie sat nearby, watching the scene unfold like it was entertainment.

I clenched my fists. “I didn’t do it. Maddie was the one who rode into the sign—and into me.”

I lifted my skirt to show the bruise and scrapes on my knee.

Dad slammed his hand on the table.

“How dare you blame this on your sister?! That five thousand—half of it is from her own allowance! She’s offering to cover it for you, and you want her to take the fall too? Is this what being an older sister means to you?”

The heat rushed to my face.

All my life, whenever it came to Maddie, they never cared who was actually right.

I was their daughter too.

So why was I always the one left behind?

“No, I didn’t do it. And I don’t want Maddie’s money.”

I said it loud and clear, then turned around and walked out.

I returned to the site of the crash, checking every angle. Finally, behind a row of gingko trees, I found a security camera.

I snapped a photo of it and headed straight for the police station.

Just as I reached the steps, Chase grabbed me from behind and pulled me aside to the park nearby.

“What are you doing at the station?” he asked, frowning.

“I found footage from a security cam,” I said. “It proves I didn’t crash the ad board.”

His expression instantly shifted.

“You can’t let this escalate. It’ll make everything worse. I already paid the guards. It’s done, okay? Just let it go.”

His words made something crack inside me.

“Chase… Maddie lied and blamed the accident on me. she did it. And you want me to let it go?”

He looked away, clearly guilty, and held my hand.

“You told me your parents always coddled your sister. She’s fragile—she can’t take blames. But you’re different. You’ve always been stronger. A few harsh words don’t break you.”

I stared at him, stunned.

Had he really just said that?

I remembered the night I broke down in his arms, crying that my parents only cared about Maddie. That they never saw me.

He’d held me close and whispered, “Sierra, I’ll be your family. I’ll love you forever.”

He’d promised to choose me—when no one else ever did.

Now?

Those words felt like a joke.

I pulled my hand away.

Chase seemed to realize how cruel he sounded. He knelt down and checked my injury.

“Your leg… does it still hurt? I brought medicine.”

“I don’t need it.”

He reached out anyway, holding my leg firmly. “Don’t move. Let me help.”

He applied ointment carefully, almost tenderly.

But I felt… nothing.

No comfort.

No warmth.

Just numb.

When he finished, I stood and stepped back.

“It’s getting late. Go home. I want to be alone.”

He grabbed my wrist. “I know you’re upset. Let’s see a movie. Take your mind off things.”

Before I could refuse, he dragged me into a private screening room.

Popcorn. Soda. Cozy lighting.

The movie started—and it was very much not PG.

My face turned red. I reached for the remote, but he pulled me into his arms.

“We’ve done more intimate things than this, haven’t we? No need to be shy.”

The film got even steamier. His hands started to wander.

I shoved him away.

Chase’s voice dropped low, husky with lust. “I’m sorry I hurt you last time. I didn’t know what I was doing. But this time… we’ll learn. I promise I’ll make you feel good.”

He dragged me into his lap.

Chapter7
My heart clenched tight, and I shot up from the couch. “Don’t.”

Chase froze, just for a second. Then, like that night after the SATs, he tried coaxing me again, his voice low and persuasive.

“The private screening room’s great for couples. No one will bother us.”

He reached for me again, but I shoved the door open before he could pull me in.

“It’s late. I’m heading home.”

I didn’t look back.

I didn’t actually want to go home. I just didn’t want to sleep with Chase. I needed to put some distance between us.

That night after the exam was our first time. And it would be our last.

I wandered aimlessly down the street. My phone buzzed twice in my pocket.

I thought it was Chase. But when I checked, it was a message from the system:

[Hello, Sierra Hayes. Your background review has passed. Please report to City Hospital within three days for your medical evaluation...]

I locked my screen and let out a long breath.

Soon, I’d be gone from this place. And honestly, thank God.

The next few days, I stayed off the grid. I didn’t text Chase, didn’t care what our parents were doing for Maddie. I had bigger things to focus on—my own future.

I went to the hospital alone for my medical checkup, did the physical and interview at the ROTC office, and finished all the early admission requirements.

Then came the day I went back to pick up my medical report—and saw Chase and Maddie walking out of the women’s health wing together.

I stopped short. Just for a second.

They were… that close already?

A tangle of emotions hit me all at once. I clutched the folder in my hand and turned away quickly, wanting to get as far away from them as possible.

But the moment I stepped outside, Maddie ran after me.

“Sis? What are you doing at the hospital?” she asked, her tone feigned concern but loud enough for others to hear. “Did you forget to take the emergency pills after sex with that blond guy? Or worse, did he give you something?”

People around us started glancing over.

I stared at her coldly. “I’m just here for my medical report. But you? Coming out of Women’s Health with Chase—what, you catch something nasty?”

“Never!” Maddie’s face turned bright red.

“I only asked Chase to come with me to meet a professor from the med school. He’s helping me figure out my college major!”

“Then next time, maybe don’t spread rumors if you can’t handle being misunderstood.” My voice dropped, sharp and icy. I turned to leave.

But Maddie wasn’t done. Her pride must’ve been bruised, because she lashed out, voice rising.

“Sierra Hayes, once I’m back from vacation with Mom and Dad, I’m going to study pre-med at the top program in the state. They already said they’d pull every string to get me into the best hospital in Westhaven after I graduate.”

“And you? You’re on your own. They won’t care about you. You’ll just rot.”

I froze. So they’d already planned her entire future.

And me? I had nothing.

But it was fine. I had already carved out my own bloody path, and I wasn’t about to stop now.

I didn’t want to make a scene, so I kept walking.

But Maddie wouldn’t let it go. She grabbed my wrist and hissed, “You still like Chase, don’t you? That’s why you followed us here. But you’re not even a virgin anymore—what makes you think he’d still want you?”

Her words made me laugh out loud.

“Oh please. Whether he wants me or not doesn’t matter. His first time’s gone too.”

Maddie’s expression cracked. “What do you mean by that?”

I didn’t bother answering. I yanked my hand away.

Then suddenly—she slapped herself.

I caught her wrist just in time. “Seriously? You’re going to fake a slap and pin it on me again?”

But her eyes welled up instantly, big fat tears streaming down her cheeks.

“Ow… Sis, you’re hurting me…”

“What the hell are you doing?” Chase stormed over and yanked me away, pulling Maddie behind him protectively.

I hadn’t even said a word before Maddie sniffled, putting on her show.

“She said we must’ve caught something just ‘cause we came out of Women’s Health together…”

Chase glared at me, face stormy.

“Maddie and I were meeting with a professor to talk about majors. What the hell, Sierra? You think everyone’s as easy as you?”

My heart stopped.

It felt like someone had hit me across the head.

And Chase… the second the words left his mouth, he looked horrified. Regret colored his face.

“I— That’s not what I meant, I didn’t—”

I cut him off.

“Then tell me, Chase—what exactly are you to Maddie? What right do you have to follow her around like a boyfriend and still criticize me like a judge?”

He went silent. His eyes searched mine like he had a thousand things to say.

But I was done listening.

I turned and walked away.

A relationship he didn’t have the guts to acknowledge? I’d long stopped wanting it anyway.

That night at 9 p.m., I logged into the SAT score system to check my results. But instead of a number, the screen read:

[Due to ranking in the top 30 statewide, your SAT score has been temporarily hidden.]

My score had been flagged and locked by the system.

I stared at the screen, stunned for a beat.

Then it hit me—I did it. I actually did it.

Just then, my phone rang.

“Hello, is this Sierra Hayes? This is the Northwest Institute of Science’s early admission office. We’ve received and verified your application—we’re happy to inform you that you’ve been admitted directly.”

“There’s one condition: Our campus enforces strict military-style management. All students are required to surrender their phones and remain fully disconnected from the outside world—including contact with family. Do you accept?”

I gripped the phone tightly. “This is Sierra Hayes. I accept it. I’m ready to give it everything I’ve got.”

Chapter8
“Excellent. A shuttle will pick you up at South Station in Westhaven two days from now, at 8 a.m. sharp. Welcome aboard.”

“Understood!”

I hung up.

For the first time in forever, I felt… free.

In just two days, I’d leave Westhaven. Leave Mom. Leave Chase.

And once I was gone, no one would ever find me again.

It was almost time. I started packing my suitcase.

Mom walked by and frowned when she saw me folding clothes.

“Sierra, we already said we’re taking Maddie to vacation tomorrow. What’s the packing about?—there’s no space for you.”

“I don’t want to go with you.” I pulled up my early admission confirmation to show her. “Mom, the scores dropped today. I got—”

Before I could finish, Maddie swooped in, playing the worried little sister.

“You didn’t bomb the test, did you?”

“What?” Mom’s face twisted in disbelief as she looked at me, eyes full of disappointment. “Is that true, Sierra?”

Dad had overheard from the living room and came marching over.

“Your sister did well in the exam. She can choose any school in Westhaven or even Columbia. What about you? ”

The anger and doubt on their faces hit like a slap.

Suddenly, I didn’t want to say anything at all.

All those years of trying, all the pain I’d buried… it all bubbled up.

“You assume I failed without hearing a word from me. Is that really how little you think of me?”

“When I got first in the whole school, you called it cheating. Said it was dumb luck. When I stayed up late studying, you said I was pretending for attention.”

“But when Maddie barely scraped into the top hundred, you said she was hardworking. When she stayed up past 9:30 doing homework, you said she was amazing.”

“Mom. Dad. We’re both your daughters. So why does it feel like I’ve never mattered?”

Mom said nothing. Dad, furious, slammed his palm against the doorframe.

“Watch your mouth!”

“We’ve always treated you two the same!”

“Maddie’s never caused trouble. You’re the one always testing our patience. And now you want to turn around and blame us? What kind of ungrateful daughter are you?”

Still seething, he threw down the final blow.

“If you really think we’re unfair—get out. You’re eighteen. We’re done raising a thankless brat like you.”

“You didn’t get into college? Fine. Go make your own damn living!”

Mom tried to rein him in, pulling him toward the door. But before she left, she still tossed one last dagger over her shoulder.

“Sierra, I gave birth yto you. I love you. But you’ve disappointed us too many times.”

Then she left with Maddie in tow.

I clenched my jaw and shut the door behind them, locking myself into the silence.

I curled up on my bed, staring at the photo on my nightstand—our “perfect” family of four.

In the picture, my parents held five-year-old Maddie in the center like a precious gem, while I stood quietly on the edge, wearing the same princess dress.

But love? Love was never equal.

I didn’t see it clearly until I was eighteen.

I tore the photo out of the frame and ripped out the little girl version of me.

“Sierra Hayes,” I whispered, “from now on, be strong. Be proud. Love yourself the way no one ever did.”

Tears poured down as I clutched that torn paper to my chest.

That little girl who was never loved—I was holding her now. I’d heal her myself.

My childhood? I’d fix it.

My future? I’d build it.

I cried for what felt like hours, raw and aching.

Then, out of nowhere, Chase called.

“Hey, Sierra. Did you check your SAT score yet? I just got a special offer from Columbia! Did you get a call from them too?”

He sounded so excited.

But my heart had gone still.

“I did.”

Just not from Columbia.

He didn’t know the truth. On the other end, he let out a happy whistle.

“That’s awesome! We can go to college together! There’s gonna be fireworks by the riverside tomorrow night. Let’s celebrate, just the two of us?”

I hesitated, then said softly, “Sure.”

I had already said goodbye to my family.

Now it was time to end things with Chase.

My childhood. My youth. Everything I’d been through…

I go for a 1.7:1 ratio with 32g shot on 18g beans. I use dark Italian style roasts which I’ve used for many years and brew head pressure steady 9bar.

In the last two months, I’m needing to dial finer every week or two to keep my ratio yet the coffee is getting flatter and bitter. Dial it back and worse and a shot is done in 15-20 seconds.

It doesn’t seem right to me that I’ve now gone below 0 and still having to keep making adjustments finer regularly with a loss of quality.

1mern46,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1mern46/the_next_call/,The Next Call,"He waited for the next call. It was past midnight. He had just finished a cup of coffee, and it had been days since he’d had a proper night’s sleep. He was a suicide-helpline operator.

It wasn’t a particularly busy night. Earlier, he’d taken one call—a teenage boy playing a prank. That was common. Now he sat alone again, eyes heavy.

The phone rang.

He answered.

At first there was only silence—then soft, heavy breathing. A girl. She was crying.

He kept his voice calm. “Take your time. I’m here.”

Silence again. Then a whisper.

He followed the script: gentle, open-ended questions, validation, space to speak. Slowly she began to talk.

Her name was Neha.

She described her house, the color of her walls. She said she felt no one would care if she disappeared. He assured her that wasn’t true.

He asked if she had a plan. She said no. He confirmed the risk was low. With low risk, he wasn’t required to inform the police.

By the end of the call, she seemed calmer. He felt calmer too. He sat there for a while in silence, his heavy eyes now focused.

At 2 a.m. his shift ended.

He stood, packed his bag, and left the office.

The streets were quiet. Driving, he listened to a song he liked. After an hour he reached a house outside the city.

It was a stand-alone home—dark, still.

He climbed the red wall, entered through the back door, and moved silently through the house.

Her bedroom door was slightly open. She was asleep, dried tears streaking her cheeks.

He watched her for a moment.

Then he pulled on his gloves.

From the bag he took a cloth. In one swift motion, he gagged her mouth and tied her hands behind her back. She woke in shock, but he moved fast.

Her terrified eyes locked on his.

“You know who I am,” he whispered. “I’m the one who just talked to you.”

He smiled, then tightened the cloth around her neck.

She kicked and fought, but he held firm.

“Why are you fighting? I’m here to help you.”

She tried to move, but his grip was so strong she could barely twitch.

When she stopped moving, he let go.

He searched the room, opened her closet, and took out a bedsheet.

Switching off the ceiling fan, he pulled over a table, tied one end of the sheet to the fan, and formed a noose with the other. Then he lifted her.

She gasped awake and struggled as he slipped the noose around her neck and kicked the table away. Her body jerked, twitched—then went still.

He stood for a moment, watching as the last light faded from her eyes.
“Take your time,” he whispered. “I’m here.”

Afterward, he wiped down the room.

By the time he reached his flat, it was almost dawn. He showered, went to bed, and slept deeply.

The next evening he returned to his shift.

He sat at the desk, placed the red diary beside him, opened to a fresh page, and wrote her name—Neha—then drew a line through it. No emotion. No ceremony. Just another entry.

He didn’t kill often—only when the urge returned, when the voice on the other end felt right: lonely, quiet, forgotten. Sometimes it took weeks, sometimes months.

There was no rush.

There was always another call.

The phone rang.

He smiled—

[Eureka Mignon],"Hello everyone, I’ve been happily using my Eureka Mignon/GCP combo for five years, and I have nothing but good things to say about these two machines. However, I’ve been curious lately how other Mignon owners, perhpas those that also have this amazing geared mod to help dial in more easily, how close to the zero point are you for espresso?

I know it depends on the beans’ roast and origin and altitude, yada yada, but IN GENERAL, what would you say is the typical range once dialed in?

I’m currently brewing a Guatemalan light roast from a local London coffee roaster and have to go to 2 on the dial to get the results I want. The burrs chirp at 0, so it’s probably less than a 1/8 of a turn from chirping. My typical range to dial in is between 2 and 8.5 for reference.

Do other Mignon owners also have such a small window to dial in espresso?",2,1754039483.0,espresso,7,0.75,False

I need advice from Australians, please.

I made a new friend a few months ago. A lovely, lovely person. I enjoy their company as we laugh and talk about all things kids, creative and travel. She is part indigenous.

We live rurally.

This morning, at coffee, we were discussing housing in our area.

She queried me about new housing in the area, and I reiterated what I had learned from others and using terminology that I had learned from my family.

In my response, I use the word ""Mission"" as in, ""I heard the girls saying they were building a mission down on XYZ street.""

We then parted ways and said our goodbye, and I did other errands.

When coming home and thinking about the conversation, I recalled noticing a shift in the energy at coffee when we were having the conversation. I tried to pinpoint when, and then, much to my horror, thought about what I had said and who I had said it to.

I asked my husband, an Australian-born person, about what I had said and how I was feeling. He agreed that I should not have said ""Mission"", I didn't understand at the time of saying it the rudeness of it. I thought it was just another word for town. He, now, explains it to me as how it could be considered derogatory. I am HORRIFIED and VERY upset. :(

I want to **profusely** apologise for what I said, but also don't want it to be such a huge apology that it makes things even more awkward. :(

1mermqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GPTAppsEngine/comments/1mermqz/no_code_revolution_how_draganddrop_automation_is/,No Code Revolution: How Drag-and-Drop Automation Is Unleashing a New Generation of Creative Superpowers! 🚀✨,"Let’s talk about *no code automation*—because wow, we’re living in a seriously cool era. 🚀

Remember the days when automation meant knowing how to wrangle Python scripts, manage servers, or copy some ancient Visual Basic code found at the bottom of an obscure internet thread? Those hair-pulling adventures are fading fast. Now, there are tools that feel like magic: drag, drop, connect, automate, then sit back and *watch it all work*.

Here’s why no code automation isn’t just hype. It’s changing the game, right now:

* 💡 **Time literally saved.** Setting up a job that once took a developer a full afternoon…now it’s more like 10 minutes and a cup of coffee.
* 📝 **No more gatekeeping!** You don’t need a Computer Science degree. You *can* make your wild workflow dreams come true. Anyone can.
* 🌐 **Huge ecosystem explosion.** Zapier, Make (formerly Integromat!), n8n, Pipedream, Airtable…and now GPT-powered everything! The choices grow every day.
* 🦾 **Heavy lifting, but *smart*.** Repetitive tasks? Auto-form-filler? Social post scheduler? Customer response drafting? Automated AI-image generation at midnight? Easy. Scaled.

But what really excites me isn’t just the convenience. It’s the creativity!

We’re seeing *New Kinds Of Makers* emerge. Front desk receptionists who automate guest check-ins. Teachers who send reminders and collect assignments without hunting through emails. Indie founders piecing together full SaaS products, without waiting for a single sprint or designer.

Scenarios that once felt impossible (“How would I ever integrate my CRM, Notion, and Telegram at 2 AM?”) become so real.

Some jaw-dropping workflows I’ve seen this month:

- An indie publisher using no-code GPT scripting + webhooks to generate, personalize, and send printable newsletter drafts *entirely* on autopilot.
- A small online shop connecting Shopify sales to automatic Google Sheet reporting and instant, customized thank-you emails—zero copy-pasting.
- A traveler using automations to parse travel confirmations, add everything to their calendar, and text family with ETAs—*while they’re still in the airport*.

And we haven’t even scratched the surface with GPT-4o and LLM tech now accessible through no-code platforms. The barrier to building minds and bots that *think* for us? It’s tumbling.

Here’s the best part: every time we automate, we create more space for the meaningful work. *Less rinse and repeat, more invent, design, dream.*

So, where are you flexing your no-code automation muscles lately? What’s your favorite “it just works!” moment? Stuck on a wild idea you want to make real without writing a single .py line?

1merjpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/texashistory/comments/1merjpy/deep_roots_the_forgotten_history_of_le_tulle_park/,"Deep Roots: The Forgotten History of Le Tulle Park, Bay City, TX [Part 4: Final]","As he explained, Colonel Holzinger did not agree with Alcerreca on spiking and discarding the twelve pounder cannon. Instead, Holzinger decided to use two abandoned schooners to transport himself, a few soldiers, the gun, and the Texian prisoners back to Matamoros, Mexico via the coastline. But nonetheless, Matagorda was now vacant of a military presence. 

Naturally, as any military officer would be with such reports, Colonel Garay dispatched scouts and spies to try and find these six hundred Texians. Shockingly, all of the operatives returned with no evidence of such activity. To this day, none of Colonel Alcerreca’s statements on May 4 have ever been verified. Later on, Alcerreca would blame his own delusional mental state for the unauthorized vacancy of his post. 

In reality, the unexplained abandonment of Matagorda worked out favorably well. Largely because of heavy rains and muddy conditions, General Filisola conceded to withdraw but only as far as Victoria. Once in place, the Mexican Army would remain until further instructions were issued from the government. 

Cayce’s Crossing, in this unexpected situation, was once again heavily utilized for military purposes. But even after the Mexican Army had departed, and the war was done, Thomas Cayce was still plagued by unfortunate circumstances. 

An 1856 appeal by Thomas Cayce for compensation reveals the rest of his sad story of riches to rags. In the immediate aftermath of the Mexican occupation of his estate, Cayce found that only sixty of his original five hundred head of cattle remained. His house was badly damaged, the fences torn down, and the cabins of his laborers had all but collapsed. Using what little he had left though, Cayce purchased at least four hundred new livestock and began working on restoring his destroyed ferry business. 

But in November, 1836, the newly established Texas government ordered a military detachment to take control of Thomas Cayce’s property. It was designated to become an outpost christened as Colorado Station, and to be commanded by Captain Andrew Neil. 

To Cayce’s chagrin and utter frustration, Neil’s orders were to: 

“Take possession of the place, and to occupy it as a military post; keep a ferry, build boats, and assist in the transportation of all public matters between the government and the army…” (“Journal of the Senate…” [see Sources for full citation] 383).

Somewhat unjustly towards Cayce, it was also directed for the army to: 

“Collect all the cattle near, and take charge of them; using such only as were fit for beef…” (Ibid.) 

From November 1836 to June 1837, the Texas Army became just as troublesome for Thomas Cayce as the Mexican Army had been. Maybe even more so. Several individuals testified  that at least four hundred cattle were slaughtered by the Texas troops while occupying Cayce’s estate. Most of these belonging to Thomas. Then, adding further insult, the hides were taken to Matagorda and traded for coffee. 

When Colorado Station was shuttered in June, 1837, Thomas Cayce was nearly bankrupt. His house, the only reminder of the estate’s past glory, was left in a dilapidated condition. Unable to do much to rebuild: 

“The said Cayce never occupied it thereafter, but sold it at what he considered a great sacrifice.” (“Journal of the Senate…” [see Sources for full citation] 384).

Thomas Cayce won his 1856 appeal for reimbursement. He was given twenty-four hundred dollars (equivalent today to $21,000) for the loss of his second herd of cattle and the conscription of his ferry business. 

Somewhat ironically, only a little less than a decade beforehand in 1849, an English immigrant named George Elliot had established a new toll crossing only a few hundred yards north of Cayce’s. Elliot’s Ferry, as it became known, remained active and existent until 1902 when the first bridge over the Colorado River in Bay City was built. 

The site of Cayce’s Crossing no longer has any visible remnants of buildings or the ferry itself. Although it is possible that traces of the trail that utilized it might still be present, and that there is undoubtedly artifacts from its time of operation still beneath the soil, the only visual reminders of its presence are the dozens of towering and cragged branched oak trees currently covering Le Tulle Park today. 

If the spirit of Thomas D. Cayce could ever return to his former property, maybe he could finally make amends for his 1837 sacrifice. Perhaps he would find comfort in seeing the smiles of toddlers as they cascade down slides and play tag on the playground that is currently beneath one of the largest trees of his past residence. Maybe he would realize that a new legacy of memories are being made where his life was so tragically uprooted.

It’s practically his brand at this point. While most celebrities hit red carpets looking like they’ve been airbrushed into existence by a team of stylists, Sandler walks in wearing mesh basketball shorts, beat-up sneakers, and a hoodie that looks like it came from the lost and found at a YMCA.

It’s not a one-time gag or a lazy day moment — it’s a **consistent, intentional style choice** that’s become one of the most talked-about fashion statements in Hollywood. And whether you think it’s genius or just bizarre, [**Sandler’s comfort-core aesthetic**](https://thegraval.com/cultural-capital/adam-sandler-aesthetic-how-comfort-became-a-style-statement-in-hollywood/) is making a real impact on the way we think about celebrity fashion and what it means to ""look good.""

**Dressing Down in a Dressed-Up World**

In a sea of carefully curated Instagram outfits and brand partnerships, Sandler’s anti-style stands out. It's a fashion statement that says: “I don’t need to try — and I don’t want to.” And weirdly enough, **that refusal to perform** is exactly what makes it powerful.

We’ve all seen the memes. Adam Sandler photographed next to Jennifer Aniston in head-to-toe designer couture while he’s rocking a t-shirt from a college he didn’t attend and neon trail runners that scream **clearance aisle energy**. But that contrast — that stark, glorious juxtaposition — is the point.

While some call it laziness, others recognize it as **a subtle act of rebellion** against the expectations that celebrities, especially male ones, should look “put together” at all times. In a recent thread over on r/movies, someone called him “the fashion hero we didn’t know we needed.” They’re not wrong.

**The Anatomy of the Sandler Look**

So what exactly makes up the **Adam Sandler aesthetic**?

* **Oversized basketball shorts** — often a solid navy or black, hanging somewhere around mid-shin
* **XXL T-shirts** with random college logos, athletic brands, or no design at all
* **Orthopedic-looking sneakers** — think New Balances or the kind of Reeboks your dad wore in the '90s
* Sometimes a **hoodie** or zip-up, depending on the weather
* Zero visible effort, maximum comfort

That’s it. No accessories. No watches. No peacocking. No statement sunglasses or designer belts. Just a guy in dad clothes, existing — and thriving.

What’s remarkable is how **deliberately consistent** the look is. It’s not like Sandler is unaware of fashion. He’s been in the industry for decades, attended enough award shows, and has the resources to dress like a Bond villain if he wanted. But he doesn’t. That’s the message: **He doesn’t need to dress up to show up.**

**“He Looks Like My Uncle”: The Appeal of Everyday Realness**

There’s a reason the general public finds Sandler so relatable. He doesn’t look like a movie star. He looks like a guy you’d see in line at CVS, half-awake and debating between two brands of cough syrup. He’s the embodiment of **""just vibing""** — a dude who didn’t get the memo that fame requires you to be aspirational at all times.

That’s why people respond to him. It’s not that he’s shunning fashion — it’s that he’s rejecting the **performance of fashion**. And ironically, that has made him one of the most influential figures in pop culture style over the last few years.

During the pandemic, while other celebrities were busy posting curated “quarantine chic” selfies in $400 loungewear, Sandler just kept doing his thing. Hoodies, shorts, and dad sneakers. He didn’t adapt to the moment — **he** ***was*** **the moment**.

And when the world collectively shifted toward valuing comfort, he didn’t have to change a thing. He was already living that life.

**Fashion as Quiet Rebellion**

A lot of people still brush off Sandler’s wardrobe as a joke. But when you dig deeper, it becomes clear that there’s something quietly radical going on.

In a 2023 GQ interview, Sandler said, “I dress like this because it makes me happy… I’m not trying to be disrespectful. I just like feeling good.” That offhand remark sums up a much bigger cultural shift — one where fashion isn’t about status, but about **comfort and authenticity**.

The truth is, Sandler’s look works because it’s **unbothered**. It’s not just anti-fashion; it’s **anti-facade**. He’s not pretending. He’s not trying to prove anything. He just *is* — and in a world built on appearances, that feels kind of revolutionary.

**Hollywood’s Suit Game: Why Sandler Stands Out**

Think about what male celebrities usually wear to red carpet events: tailored suits, carefully chosen watches, designer shoes, statement pieces — even if it’s all styled to look “effortless.” Now throw Sandler into that mix.

Put him next to someone like Ryan Gosling (king of the retro-modern tailored look), or The Rock (perpetually dressed like he’s attending a power-lifting board meeting in Milan), and Sandler looks like he wandered in by accident. And yet… all eyes go to him.

He’s **not trying to stand out**, but he does anyway. In a weird way, his refusal to play the game becomes its power move.

As someone on r/fashionreps joked recently, “Sandler is proof that if you have enough confidence (and money), you can dress like a rec league coach and still be iconic.”

**From Mocked to Moodboard**

What’s even more surreal is that **the fashion world is now borrowing from Sandler’s playbook**.

Designers like Demna (Balenciaga) and the folks at Vetements have launched entire collections inspired by comfort-core — think oversized hoodies, shapeless silhouettes, and intentionally “ugly” sneakers. What Sandler wears to pick up an iced coffee has become **runway chic**.

You’ll now find $900 sweatshirts that look like something you’d wear after a breakup. And you know what they call it? *Post-streetwear minimalism.*

Fashion writer Rachel Tashjian even called Sandler **“normcore’s final boss.”** Honestly, that’s the most accurate description I’ve seen.

**A Style with Staying Power?**

Is this just a moment? Or is Sandler’s anti-style becoming something more permanent?

Well, younger celebs like Pete Davidson and Seth Rogen seem to be embracing the same **don’t-care-but-do-care** vibe. And on social media, there’s been a noticeable rise in appreciation for clothing that prioritizes feel over flex.

Even outside of celebrity culture, people are realizing that **comfort can be confident**. That you don’t have to dress like an influencer to be seen as stylish — you just have to own your look.

Sandler does. And people love him for it.

We all know the drill for link building: find a relevant article, read it, and beg for a link. But my biggest bottleneck is finding the *perfect* spot for that link.

The current methods feel ancient:

* Just Ctrl+F for my exact keywords. (Misses 90% of the good spots)
* Manually reading every single line, hoping a phrase jumps out. (Takes forever)

Here’s the tool I'm dreaming of, and I need you to tell me if it already exists:

**An AI-powered Chrome extension that works like this:**

1. **It learns your business:** Instead of just giving it a keyword list, you give it your website URL or a short description of your business (e.g., ""We sell high-end, sustainable coffee beans for home brewing"").
2. **AI generates anchor concepts:** The AI thinks about your business and creates a *broad set of potential anchor text concepts*. It goes beyond your main keywords. For our coffee example, it might generate concepts like: `ethical sourcing`, `eco-friendly farming`, `gourmet coffee quality`, `specialty roasts`, `the perfect morning cup`, etc.
3. **It reads blogs FOR you:** Now, when you're on a target article, you click the button. The AI reads the article and **semantically highlights** phrases that are a great fit for your *concepts*.

So instead of just highlighting the exact phrase ""sustainable coffee beans,"" it might highlight something like:

""...and the **way the beans are grown** has a huge impact on the final taste...""

...and suggest that as a perfect, natural-sounding anchor text opportunity.

It’s not a keyword finder. It’s an **opportunity finder**.

So, my questions are:

1. Does this idea make sense, or am I overcomplicating it? Would you use something that thinks this way?
2. Does anything like this exist? I've looked and found nothing that uses AI for this specific semantic discovery task.

The other day, I had one of those rare moments where life just seemed to pause, and evverything felt... right? 🤔 I was chilling in my little living room, my cat napping beside me, and a half-empty mug of coffee cooling off on the table. All of a suddsn, I was just hit by this overwhelming sense of calmness. Doesn’t sound all that excciting, but for someone who usually thrives on chaos, it kiinda threw me off, tbh.

I mean, why then? There were dishes piling up and my plans for the next day were all over the place. Yet, here I was, sitting with this random peace brringing along a familair yet surprising comfort like an old sweatshirt you'd forgotten about and love slipping into.

Is this what people talk about when they say peeace finds you when you least expect it? Or maybe it was my mind's way of saying I need to slow down and just appreciate tiny victories, like my cat deciding I'm worth her snuggles for ten uninterrupted minutes.

I guess I wanted to share this with a stranger becausse it's so easy to overlook these moments amidst life's rush. So, if you’re reading this, maybe take a secnod to pause and breaghe. You might find your unepxected moment of peade too... Or maybe it’ll snak up on you while you're least expecting it. 😊

Anyway, thanks for reading my little reflection. I'd love to hear if anyone else has experienced something similar!

Whether it’s going on a hike, wandering around Target for no reason, grabbing coffee, or just enjoying a chill conversation — I value those moments more than anything fancy.

I’m the respectful type your parents would probably approve of. I believe in treating people with kindness, listening well, and just being present. I’m not here for games or drama — I’d rather build something real with someone who feels the same way 

All I’m really looking for is someone to spend time with, who values connection and wants to genuinely share time together — whether it’s being spontaneous or doing absolutely nothing and still having a great time. Company means a lot to me, especially when it’s mutual and appreciated.

If you’re into the outdoors, cozy nights in, last-minute store runs, or just deep conversations over simple moments — shoot me a message or comment. Let’s see if we vibe. 🙂",1,1754038316.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

Jess didn’t look up. “We didn’t bring one in.”

She gave a small, dry exhale. Not quite a sigh. “She’s a kid, Rob. She’s got an imagination. Like you. You feed that in her.”

I dropped the shirt I’d been folding, ran a hand over my face. “It’s not just what she said. It’s how she said it. Like she didn’t think it was strange at all.”

Jess finally met my eyes. “You’re wound tight lately. She’s playing. That’s what kids do.”

“I keep checking on her,” I muttered. “She’s always fine. Watching TV, playing with Snacks. But –”

“But?”

I paused, trying to slow my thoughts down. I’d hardly been able to work after what Win had told me, and Jess was right. I did have a big imagination.

But every creak I heard upstairs, every time Win came bounding down the steps, I felt it. The living music of the house had a different cadence. There was a wrongness I couldn’t name. Like something was just…off. And yet Win was happy. Playing with her new toy.

Milkshake.

“It’s just,” I said, “it didn’t feel like make-believe.”

“Well of course not,” she said, “because it was just a dream or something babe. Seriously. Kid’s say weird things sometimes.”

I tried not to bristle. Jess was just like this – the practical one, measured. The planner. She kept us grounded and I was glad she did. She encouraged me, she kept me hopeful. And I loved her so much for that.

But in that moment? I just wanted someone to reassure me. The same someone I shared a bed with.

“Then how do you explain the toy?”

Jess put her towel onto a pile of others, each folded straight and neat. She sighed.

“She probably found it somewhere in the house,” Jess said, “I mean, there were clearly kids living here before us. Maybe they left some of their toys laying around. Probably the same with the box.”

And then, quietly and under her breath – “You must have missed it.”

She meant the board in Win’s closet, the one with the names and dates carved into the wood. Candace and Marie. We’d found other pieces of them in the weeks after we’d fully moved in – marker scribbles on the baseboards upstairs, a pair of children’s spades behind the shed. A couple old photographs tucked away in a coat closet – two little girls with their parents all bundled up in early-90’s puffers, red-cheeked and smiling.

Those artifacts made sense to me. You live in a place long enough, you leave something behind. A sock under the bed. A feeling in the walls.  

But the snake?

Milkshake didn’t feel left behind. To me, Milkshake felt *placed*.

“I don’t know,” I said, sitting down on the edge of the bed, “I guess I just don’t like it. It was filthy.”

“So wait until she’s asleep and take it away,” Jess said, hoisting the folded towels in her arms and turning toward the closet.

“But she’s been carrying it around all day,” I said, “she’ll hate me.”

“She won’t hate you,” Jess called from the closet, muffled, “we’ll get her something else this weekend. I saw a flier at the store for a farmer’s market on Sundays – maybe we’ll find her another stuffed snake or whatever.”

“Yeah,” I said called back, taking up my shirt again.

But what I thought to myself was – *Jesus. I hope not*.

\*\*

It took until Jess was nearly asleep for me to make up my mind.

I crept, sneaking as quietly as I could, trying to remember where all the squeaking places were in the floorboards under the carpet that lined the upstairs hallway. I kept the lights out, afraid if I turned them on the splash of bright might wake up Win. I made it all the way to her room in the dark.

And then I opened the door.

The room was dark – darker than the hall. We’d brought our old black-out curtains from the apartment for her windows, covering both in case we needed to put her to bed before the sun had fully set. There wasn’t even a drop of moonlight to light my way.

After a moment I could see a little better, lingering in the doorway. Win was bundled up in her blankets, her back to me, facing the wall. Her toys were scattered about the floor, waiting for the morning. To be arranged.

I scanned them, looking for the snake. I took several long moments to look, but I couldn’t see Milkshake anywhere.

I heard Win sigh, turn around on the bed. I froze, feeling ridiculous, like a cartoon character caught snooping. My back arched, my arms up, bracing myself.

I almost giggled when I heard her sleep-breathing. Her mouth open, she was deep into her dreams. There was something so special about hearing her sleep so peacefully. I hoped then that that feeling would never go away.

But hope is a trap. Sometimes there are nasty surprises waiting in its underbelly, and the sweeter you wish, the more vile what waits underneath the other side of wanting can be.

Her breathing had a little rasp to it. I made a mental note to dust upstairs again that weekend. The house got dusty, and Win wasn’t used to such an old space. All of the grit that builds up in such a lived in place, no matter how hard you clean.

My secret joy drained just a little when I saw the other thing in Win’s bed. Of course it was there. The snake, a dark squiggle in the dark, laid out next to her, its black curves stark against her bright emerald bedsheets.

I felt stupid, I felt like I was breaking some sort of trust, sneaking into her room like that in the middle of the night. Planning to take something away from her that so very clearly gave her joy. At least, I resolved, I would get it away from her in the morning. Wash it before I took it back up to her room. I was afraid it had mold somewhere inside it, from the way it smelled. From the feel of its brittle skin.

And I was just about to turn around, about to sneak back into bed to Jess, when I heard it.

A slow, moaning creak.

I turned, fast and hard. Spinning around on the carpet, all thoughts of sneaking fleeing my mind. And I looked at the shadowed space.

At first I didn’t see anything.

Even though my eyes had adjusted to the dark, the shadows in the nook were darker still. I squinted from where I stood in the middle of the room, between the nook and Win’s bed, and looked deeper. Rats, my mind wanted to jump to rats. Old houses had rats, right?

But then I heard something else. The click of a hinge, a hollow wooden thump. The toybox lid – I was sure of it.

Yawning gently closed.   

My hand shot to my pocket, reaching for my phone. Cursing to myself when I remembered I had left it on the bedside table, plugged into the phone charger. The thought of how far away the phone was then, how naked and helpless I felt without it, made me feel limp. Isolated.

“Hello,” I called, in a whisper.

But there was only silence. It rushed in to fill the space my voice ate up, smothering it. The kind of silence that’s like white noise in and of itself. Static.

The hair on my arms stood up. A mixture of a sudden chill and a growing certainty that I was being watched. Being seen, some dull dark eyes in the dark.

“*Daddy*?”

I turned around again and saw Win sitting up in bed. The lump of her shadowed form under her blankets.

“Baby,” I said, “did you hear something?”

I thought I could make out Win shaking her head in the dark, alert. Her voice sounded muffled, almost pitched.

“*Can I turn on my nightlight Daddy?*”

I could barely see her face, but she sounded scared. Pleading. Something under it, like all the fear I felt had caught on to her. Like it was squeezing her, urgent.

“Yes baby,” I said, feeling stupid that I hadn’t thought of that myself, “please, turn it on.”

I turned back towards the nook, ready for the light to fill up the room. Ready to see whatever was waiting in there.

“*I can’t reach it Daddy*,” I heard her behind me.

I turned back to my girl. She was bundled up still, curling up farther into her blankets. I tried to smile, even though she probably couldn’t see it. To reassure her.

“It’s right by your bed sweetie,” I said, nodding. Encouraging her.

“*I’m scared*,” she said, her voice falling suddenly small. Tiny.

I shuffled over to the end of her bed. The lamp was there, on her bedside table – a Minnie Mouse lamp, her kicking form silhouetted in the blackness. The switch was her hand, and I reached for it, turning it around clockwise.

Darting my gaze back to the nook as light filled the room.

And I did see something there.

A shock of dark black hair, splayed out on the floor. Spilling through the threshold of the nook. My heart jumped, my chest hitching, as I saw it stir. Slither on the floor.

Then my dad instincts kicked in. Flowing through me right after the shock of the sight of the hair. A rage, that someone or something was in my little girl’s room. Hiding and waiting for her.

I strode over to the nook, grabbing one of Win’s tiny tennis racquets in my hand as I did – ready to club the thing to hell.

I stopped in the doorway.

Win was there, curled up in the space at the end of the nook. She was laying on her side, her back to me. Her hair splayed out behind her. The toybox, closed and dark in the shadow, stood next to her.

It was Win’s hair I’d seen.

I froze. That feeling of being watched returned to me. Pushing everything else away.

Because if Win was in the closet, who had been in her bed?

Slowly, slowly, I turned my head back to Win’s bed. My eyes falling over every inch of the room leading to it, my gaze sweeping slow. Doomed, like it was being pulled to the bed.

To whatever was waiting for me, wrapped up in the covers.

But when my eyes finally fell there, all I could see were blankets. Lumped and piled up like someone was underneath them. And, as I watched, they slumped. Fell back into themselves. Deflated.

There was nothing there in the bed. Nothing except for Win’s blankets.

And, of course, Milkshake.

I turned back to the nook, my heart bashing against my ribs, and bent over Win. Scooped her up in my hands. She moaned, half-asleep, as I lifted her up off the floor. Stepping as quick as I could with her in my arms out of the nook. Out of the bedroom.

I took her downstairs and laid her across my lap on the couch. She stirred against me, but only a little. She was still asleep, still young enough to be lifted up and away, asleep through it all. So trusting and so safe.

And I didn’t see it at first what she’d been holding. I had been so quick to get her out of that room, so quick to carry her downstairs, that I had hardly noticed the shape in her hands. But there, in the glow of the TV, I got a good look at it.

It was another toy, another crocheted shape. This one was a little girl. It was crude. The legs and arms no more than fleshy points. It had the same color scale as Milkshake – ash and boney white. All of course except for its eyes.

They were blue. Tiny sapphires in the stitched head. They caught the flickering light from the TV – shining bright and livid.  

Something about the doll rang a familiar bell in me. It couldn’t have been one of Win’s other toys, I knew that – I would never have forgotten something so worn. So wet. But at the same time…I felt like I’d seen it before.

I met the thing’s stare. Grunting. Then I reached down and took the toy from Win’s hands. Her grip relaxed, weak in sleep. I felt the toy and felt that odd cold in its fibers – just like Milkshake.

“Fuck. You,” I said, my voice hard. I threw the thing into the corner of the living room, watched it hit the wall and slide behind the armchair we had there, hearing it skitter to a stop against the baseboards.

Then, with a sigh, I hugged my girl. Hugged her close to my chest and closed my eyes tight against her. Wishing she was dreaming of something good. Something peaceful, free of worry. 

Wishing again and again.

Wishing.

\*\*

I woke up shaking. Violently.

I started, sitting straight up. Almost too fast, because Win was still asleep on my lap. When I saw her there, I froze, hugging her close to me so I didn’t knock her on the floor.

I felt the hand then, on my shoulder.

“Hey,” Jess’s voice from behind me, “*hey*.” 

I turned around, seeing her standing behind the couch. She was dressed for work, lit up from behind by the morning sun, her backpack slung over her shoulder. Her eyes were wide.

“What’s going on?” she asked.

“Shit,” I said, grimacing, “we must have fallen asleep on the couch.”

“I can see that,” Jess said, turning around fast. Too fast. An about-face.

She was pissed.

“Jess,” I called, still getting used to the bright light of morning, “*Jess*.”

She didn’t turn around, was bending over to get her shoes on. Slipping them on, pushing her heels down in them so hard they screeched against the wood floor. I winced, Win stirring in my lap. I tried to move her off of me, carefully and slowly, and I managed to get her onto the cushion beside me. I stood up, my wince deepening – sleeping like that on the couch had put a crick my back.

“Babe,” I said, “I’m sorry. She…she had a bad dream.”

I don’t know why I lied then. Maybe it was because I’d hoped that it was the truth. Not that the bad dream was Win’s, in my wish.

It had been mine.

“I woke up,” she said, hushed, her back to me still, “and I didn’t know where you were.”

“I get it,” I said, trying to reach a hand to her shoulder, in an offering. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to fall asleep, it just happened.”

Jess rejected my touch, and shrugged my hand off. I let it drop to my side, sighing. Trying not to let my sleep-soaked mind carry me to anger.

“Nothing’s wrong,” I almost whispered. “Nothing, babe.”

She stopped, going still. Her back to me. I saw her shoulders sink, by an inch. Then I saw them hitch. Heard her take a breath in, heard it catch.

And I knew what she was thinking.

A few years ago, when Win was just a toddler, I was in a bad place. I had just gotten laid off from my job during the pandemic, and my girls were all I had. Every day I was home alone with them, while Jess scrambled to support us, and my feeling of failure grew. Because – here were these two wonderful loves of mine, the lights in my sky, and as much as I loved the chance to spend time with them – I couldn’t help but feel like every day I couldn’t help get us back on our feet…that I was disappointing them. Failing them. Jess never said anything of the sort to me, and I don’t think she thought it either, but sometimes the worst thoughts we have about ourselves can build up inside us – booming echoes with nowhere to go. Bounding and reverberating through our heads all day until the pressure builds to cook. Frying our sense of reality.

I took Jess’s success for granted. The extra work she did, the more time she spent away from home, I processed as her needing more time away from me. From her loser husband, trapped at home. Win went through a hard spot herself, getting sick from the virus. She was hard to manage, and I spent a few very isolated weeks with her, Jess staying at her parents so she could still do everything she could to work to make up for our loss of income.

I spun stories in my head about the worst-case scenarios. That she was having an affair. That Win was growing to resent me, that all she would associate me with for the rest of her life was sickness. Loneliness.

And none of it was true of course. But, at the time, it felt like the truth. It was what I *wanted* to believe. Because, really, I was just punishing myself. And very unfairly.

So, one night, after Jess came back, I tried to talk to her. She was exhausted – from overworking and also the relief she felt being home at the old apartment again, I’m sure. She didn’t know what I had smoldering inside of me, the thick stew of self-loathing I’d been seeping in for weeks.

She took something I said – I can’t even remember what it was now – with a light heart. Not really willing to hear me. And that hurt me bad, at the time.

So, I waited for her to fall asleep. I sat in bed and watched her, watched how at peace she seemed to be. Seething with an un-real lie.

Then I walked out of the apartment, got in the car, and drove. I drove for a whole night and most of the next day. Not really knowing where I was going.

Jess called me once and then several times in a row. I ignored all of them. It was petty, it was childish. But I was not myself.

I came to my senses at a rest-stop, somewhere a couple of states over. Watching the sun come up over a copse of trees down the hill from the trucker-lot. Something about the time away from the two of them, about how much worse it made me feel, got me to call Jess back.

We talked for a while on the phone there, until the sun was almost setting again behind me and the woods ahead were alive with shadows. We talked a lot more on the drive home. And a whole hell of a lot more once I got there. We had a couple of hard, hard nights. But then, slowly yet wonderfully, a couple of better ones.

And then, some of the best.

“Baby,” I said, coming up behind her, sliding my arms around her waist. Hugging her from behind. “Nothing’s wrong, I promise.”

She turned around to me then, and I reached a hand up to wipe a tear off her cheek. Careful not to smudge her makeup.

“Promise?” she asked, her voice small and close to cracking.

“Swear,” I said. Kissing her.

A few moments later I was watching her go, waving from the front door. She waved back, a little smile on her lips. I watched the car go down the road until the taillights were too small to see the red.

Before shutting the door. Before letting my gaze linger above me, to the ceiling. On the other side, on the second floor, was exactly where Win’s room was.

I sat there for a moment. I listened. Wishing, really wishing, that I could believe my own lie.

\*\*

I could barely work that day, and after a few hours of half-hearted email-sorting and responding to IM’s, I had accepted that the events of the night before rendered me useless. I put myself in offline-mode and sent a message to my team that I would be out the rest of the day and shut my laptop.

Win was running around like nothing happened. After she woke up, I made her pancakes and set them for her at the table. I watched her eat them, the TV in the living room blaring an old Disney musical, while I drank my coffee. Questions surging up my tongue were begging to come out.

*‘Do you remember anything weird about last night?*’

*‘Why did you fall asleep in the closet?’*

*‘Was there something in there with you?’*

What stopped me was the joy, the gleeful nonchalance Win greeted everyday with. Her abandon and her spirit, soaring up as soon as she was, buzzed from the sugary syrup. I let her out into the backyard where she ran to her soccer ball, kicking it between the trees. I watched her from the back door, drinking cup after cup of coffee.

I wished I could have her energy. Her fearlessness. I wished I could have gotten away with drinking something stronger than coffee.

Surely, I reasoned with myself, if she had seen anything – if there had actually been anything there, in the room with us, Win would have remembered. The girl could see a caterpillar on the sidewalk in the morning and talk about it all the way until bedtime, until the next day even, urging us to walk back to where she’d seen it crawling a full day before to see if it was still there.

Which meant if she had seen something, if she had seen what I’d seen, she would have said something.

Right?

Unless, I thought, she couldn’t see it. Unless what had been in her bed that night had just been for me.

I shook my head, trying to upend the thoughts souring my mind, like I could loose them out of my ears. This was a new house, a new space, and I was filling it with my fear as much as we had filled it with our wonder, with our joy and our hope. There wasn’t anything else here with us. It was just an old, creepy house and I – this man who had spent his whole life in the suburbs and the city and considered a two-bedroom apartment just over a thousand square feet a living luxury – just wasn’t used to what dwelling in a place like this meant.

Yeah. That was it.

It had to be.

I almost lost myself in watching her, in the peace that was filling in the morning, when I remembered the toy. The doll. The little girl.

I walked away from the back door, hurrying over to where I had thrown the thing the night before. Shoving the couch back, wincing as it screeched along the hardwood floor. Flicking open the flashlight on my phone to look into the dark of the corner.

I half expected it to be gone. To be a figment, a little resident of a night I was so dearly hoping had been a dream.

But it wasn’t gone. It was exactly where I had left it: facedown in the gathering dust under the couch.

I bent to pick it up. God, it was still cold. A kind of chill in its fibers that made me think it was wet. But, as I brought it out of the dark, I ran my thumb across the stiches of the thing’s dress – they were dry. Coarse, rough like a raw rope.

I looked through the kitchen to make sure Win was occupied and happy – she was, kicking the ball and weaving in and out of the old trees back there. I bounded up the stairs, taking them two at a time, almost running to her room.

I stopped in the doorway.

Her blankets were bunched up on the bed, just as they had been the night before. In the light of morning, they seemed a harmless pile. Her comforter and sheets, wound up in a conical shape. It had been so dark the night before – was it so far fetched to assume I had dreamed up the whole thing? That maybe I had heard Win talking in her sleep and given her voice to the shape in the bed instead of the girl in the nook?

I saw Milkshake’s tail, poking out from between the blanketed folds. I reached for it, pulling it free. It was still so cold, despite spending the night buried in the blanket. I had a thought then to rip it open, Milkshake and the girl both, and see what the hell was inside. What gave them such a chill.

I felt it again then – that same prickling from being watched. I turned, slowly, expecting, *hoping* to see Win in the doorway: watching me. Imagining her devastated little face as I took her new toys; because that was what I was doing, I was sure now. I was taking them and I was going to destroy them.

Burn them, maybe. Warm them up.

But Win wasn’t in the doorway. It was empty, but I heard –

The soft shriek of hinges. The click of a latch.

I whipped toward the nook.

You know that feeling when something flickers at the edge of your vision—when you’re sure it’s there, but the moment you turn your head you catch only the briefest trace? I read once that it’s your mind filling in the gaps, a leftover instinct from our lizard brains—priming you to run before you even know what you’ve seen.

The toybox was there. Blacker than the shadows around it. Waiting.

I stepped inside, frowning as I did. The air in the nook was near freezing. Not normal cold – this was deep, cellar-cold. It made the hair on my arms stand on end.

Upstairs rooms don’t feel like that. Heat rises.

I knelt, flipping open my phone and switching on the flashlight. Shadows danced as I pressed my palm along the baseboards, searching for a draft, a crack. Some rend in the wall, some reason the space could be this chilled. Nothing. My hand rose higher. The cold sharpened near my face, like an invisible seam slicing through the air.

I followed it. Fingers outstretched. They touched something solid. Hard.

The toybox.

I slid my hand along its lid until I found the seam. The cold seeped out there, steady and unnatural.

I gripped the edge. Pulled.

Nothing.

I squatted, planted my feet, and hauled upward with all my weight. The lid didn’t shudder. It might as well have been nailed shut – or part of the floor itself.

I pressed my ear close. A faint hum trembled through the wood—distant and hollow, like something shifting deep – somewhere in the house.

I staggered back, breath fogging. My flashlight trembled.

It must have been a trick of the light. That’s what I told myself. Because the shadow beneath the toybox… it wasn’t thinning as I stared. It looked deeper. Farther away.

I reached out, slowly. My hand hovered over the crack of the lid.

Of the mouth.

For a split second, I thought it wouldn’t stop. That I’d just keep reaching, shoulder-deep, swallowed whole inside the solid square of black.

Instead, my fingers hit wood.

I jerked back.

“That’s all you are,” I whispered. “Just a trick of the dark.”

I stood up, walking quickly out of Win’s room. Hurrying down the stairs. Wanting very, very much to be out in the sunlight with my girl.

Because, for a sliver of a moment? I’d thought my hand wouldn’t touch that glistening wood. I thought it would go on and on. Stretching backwards into a space I would have to crawl into, I would have to push myself through, to find the end of.

It was impossible, I thought. My sleep-weak mind playing with me. Showing me something that simply could not be.

I set Milkshake and the doll down on the counter, hiding them behind a glass container of dried pasta so Win wouldn’t see. Resolving, promising, myself that as soon as Jess was home tomorrow to distract our girl I would take the knit little fucks out back, behind the shed.

And burn them.

\*\*

I woke up with a shudder, groggy and weightless, like I’d been held underwater. The edges of a dream slipping away from me. One in which my daughter held me, in which was staring down at me.

In the dream I couldn’t breathe.

I blinked, looking around our room in the dark. Taking in several deep, shuddering breaths. As the sleep and the dream drained out of me, I found the uneven shadows from all our half-unpacked belongings scattered around our bed a comfort. That was a kind of mess, the remnants of our shuffled life, was at least ours. It made sense. I could feel Jess’s legs pressed against me, her back turned, her form under the blanket rising and falling with silent sleeping.

My eyes caught something in the gloom.

\*CLICK\*

I squinted, leaning forward in the dark.

Another *click.* Sharp. Hollow. Rhythmic.

I turned my head toward the doorway. My heart quickened.

Win stood there.

Barefoot. Motionless. Her face lost in shadow.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

The sound was coming from her.

I swallowed. “Win?”

She didn’t move.

Jess stirred slightly beside me but didn’t wake.

“Baby?” My voice was low. Careful. I sat up, feet on the floor.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

Her jaw. I saw it now, lit from the moonlight pouring from the hallway window. Her mouth opening and shutting, teeth meeting teeth, each clack sharp in the quiet.

I reached for the lamp on my nightstand.

The room exploded in light.

Win was staring right at me.

She didn’t blink. Didn’t speak. Just stood there in her pajamas, her hair wild from sleep, eyes wide and glassy in the glow, *CLICK CLICK CLICK*, her teeth snapping together – hard, sharp and insistent.

My breath caught.

“Sweetheart,” I said softly, standing, “come here.”

She didn’t move.

I stepped to her in three quick strides, crouching to her level. She tilted her head up at me, never breaking that awful rhythm. *CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

Her bottom lip trembled, but she didn’t cry. Didn’t say anything at all.

“Win,” I whispered, “does it hurt?”

Her eyes shot to me. Wide, glistening.

Then, slowly, she opened her mouth wider.

One of her bottom teeth teetered, loose and pale in the light, hanging by the root. A pale little pearl.

*CLICK.*                                                                                                                                                

There was no blood.

*CLICK.*

I reached out, my fingers shaking, and brushed it gently. It tipped sideways in her gums.

“Teef dad-gdy,” she said through her gaping mouth, her throat and tongue working to make the words with a wide-open jaw, “my teef.”

“Jesus,” I murmured. “Okay, honey. Okay.”

She just kept staring, mouth half-open, teeth clicking together, even as I scooped her up and carried her back toward her room.

Her jaw worked the whole way.

*CLICK. CLICK. CLICK.*

I laid her down in her bed, her eyes fluttering half-way closed. Resting her head on her pillow. Her mouth worked, opening and closing, as I stuck my fingers inside.

“Hold on honey,” I said, feeling her close her jaw, her tongue slithering away from my thumb, “let me get it.”

There was almost no resistance as I pulled the thing out. As soon as I did, Win’s head relaxed against the pillow, her fluttering eyes twitching shut. She started breathing, heavy, as I leaned back from her bed. Looking at the boney little pebble in my hand.

Looking at my girl, already asleep in her bed.

She was three, halfway to four. I hadn’t prepared myself to even think of when she would start losing teeth but…at her age?

It seemed wrong. Kids don’t lose teeth this young, I thought. Not unless something’s pulling at them.

*Click*.

There was a different sort of sound, a different sort of hollow snap. And it from behind me.

I jumped, turning in the dark of Win’s room.

Toward the nook.

And I felt the temperature shift – a putrid gust. Just a gash of air.

I stared down at the tooth again in my palm. Maybe it was all in my mind, or maybe it was the snap of air from the nook. But I knew what I felt.

The tooth, in my palm, was cooling. Feeling more and more like a little chip of ice. Bloodless, too tiny, and dry. I squeezed my hand shut over it, watching Win’s small chest rising and falling. The breeze from the nook brushed the back of my neck, cold and sour.

And I wondered with a twist in my heart – what if she’s not losing her teeth?

What if they’re being taken?",1,1754037197.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

The morning sun rolled in soft over the hills, draping Bramble Creek Ranch in golden light. Dew still clung to the blades of grass, and a thin mist hovered in the low pasture where the horses stirred lazily. A rooster crowed somewhere near the chicken coop, echoing through the stillness. The scent of leather, hay, and old wood mixed with fresh coffee drifting from the ranch house's open windows.

Beau McAllister stood barefoot on the front porch, cradling a chipped enamel mug. The steam warmed his face while he watched the morning unfold. He was the youngest of the three McAllister brothers, twenty-four, lean and wiry with dark curls that had a mind of their own. He scratched absently at the stubble along his jaw, still waking up in pieces. His Camarillo white gelding, Ash, was already up and tossing his head in the paddock, waiting.

The sound of boots on wood behind him made Beau turn just as Levi came through the screen door, already dressed for the day. Tank top, dusty jeans, the same worn brown vest he always wore like a second skin. Tattoos curled down his biceps like ivy on old stone. He gave Beau a look — half teasing, half expectant.

“You gonna stare at the sunrise all morning or help me haul feed before the sun burns us alive?” Levi asked, sipping from his own mug. His voice was still rough from sleep.

Beau smirked. “Mornin’ to you too, Levi.”

“Don’t get cute.”

“I’m always cute.”

They didn’t hug, not really their thing. But Levi bumped shoulders with Beau as he passed, which in McAllister speak was basically affection. Levi was two years older, more serious by default. Beau was all heart and impulse. And then there was the eldest, Mason — who, true to form, was already in the barn before either of them had even rolled out of bed.

“I saw Mason head to the hay loft twenty minutes ago,” Beau said, following Levi toward the barn. “Think he sleeps up there at this point.”

“Think he just doesn’t want to deal with us,” Levi said, grinning.

The barn doors creaked as they slid them open. Dust danced in beams of light through the rafters. Mason was there all right, shirtless, tossing bales like they weighed nothing, his red hair darkened by sweat already. He didn’t look up.

“Took y’all long enough,” he said.

Beau leaned on the nearest post and gave him a slow clap. “Look at you go, big brother. Breaking a sweat before breakfast.”

“Don’t start, Beau.”

Mason finally turned and gave them both a look that could cut steel — but there was a flicker of something softer behind it. Tiredness maybe. Or the years of responsibility he never asked for, but carried anyway.

The three of them had run Bramble Creek alone since their parents died in a car wreck almost a decade ago. Mason was barely twenty at the time. He’d taken guardianship of the ranch and, in many ways, of his younger brothers. That kind of loss forges a bond that doesn’t break — but it doesn’t always leave room to talk about things that matter either.

Beau always knew he was gay. Quietly, for years. And Levi — well, Levi knew too. He just didn’t talk about it.

Not yet.

Beau hoisted a bucket of grain, letting the comforting routine of chores settle into his bones. His boots crunched over straw as he passed each stall, murmuring quiet greetings to the horses. Ash snorted when he saw him, the white gelding already nosing the gate.

“You hungry or just impatient?” Beau asked, rubbing the horse’s cheek before dumping the feed.

Levi moved behind him, loading up hay bales with rhythmic precision. “Ash ain’t the only impatient one,” he said without looking up. “You were twitchy all night.”

Beau hesitated. “Couldn’t sleep.”

“You dreaming again?”

Beau’s silence was answer enough.

Levi didn’t press. He just nodded and kept working.

The thing was, dreams were easy. Beau’s dreams didn’t judge. They didn’t talk back. They didn’t remind him that Bramble Creek wasn’t exactly the place a guy like him could be his whole self without a few raised brows — or worse. But Levi knew. Had known for a while. And he’d never said anything, not even once.

Beau sometimes wondered if his brother knew because he’d walked the same line.

They finished up in the barn, each falling into the easy rhythm of shared labor. Mason barked orders and did most of the heavy lifting without needing help, like always. When breakfast finally came calling, the three of them gathered around the long farmhouse table — pancakes, eggs, bacon, and the same chipped mugs full of black coffee. No one talked much, but it was the kind of quiet that came with familiarity, not tension.

Beau watched his brothers between bites. Mason, stoic and focused, flipping through a worn notebook of ranch ledgers. Levi, his arm slung casually over the back of his chair, tapping his foot to a tune only he could hear. He looked relaxed, but Beau knew better. Levi was always thinking, always guarding something.

“Town day tomorrow,” Mason said, not looking up. “I’ll need one of you to go pick up fencing supplies and the new seed from McKenna’s.”

“I’ll go,” Beau said quickly.

Mason raised a brow. “You sure? You hate town.”

“Figured I’d grab a haircut too,” Beau said with a shrug, trying to sound casual.

Levi gave him a sidelong glance, a flicker of a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. “Trying to impress someone?”

“Shut up,” Beau muttered, but his cheeks flushed.

Mason didn’t notice. He was already flipping to the next page in the ledger. “Fine by me. Don’t forget the seed. Last time you came back with a box of cinnamon rolls and forgot the hardware.”

“They were *really* good cinnamon rolls,” Beau said under his breath, but even Mason cracked a small smile at that.

After breakfast, the brothers split off — Mason to check the south fence, Levi to start repairs near the creekbed, and Beau to the paddock, saddle in hand. The sky had cleared into a bright stretch of blue, promising heat by noon. Ash tossed his head eagerly as Beau led him out, the leather reins creaking as he adjusted the fit.

By the time he was mounted, riding toward the far hills where the wildflowers were just starting to bloom, the weight on Beau’s chest had lightened. For now, at least.

He didn't know what tomorrow would bring — or how Mason might react when he found out that both of his younger brothers carried more than they let on.

But he knew this: secrets don’t stay buried forever.

And some truths — the real ones — come to light when you least expect it.",2,1754037079.0,writersanonymus,0,1.0,False

## FAQs Section

**What size should a quilted table runner be?**
The ideal size depends on the size of your table and the desired overhang. A general guideline is to choose a runner that is one-third to two-thirds the length of your table. For a standard dining table,a runner that is 14 to 18 inches wide and 54 to 72 inches long is often a good choice. However, adjust the dimensions to fit your specific needs and preferences.

**What type of fabrics are best for quilting table runners?**
Cotton fabrics are the most popular choice for quilting due to their durability, ease of handling, and wide availability of colors and prints.Pre-cut fabric bundles like charm packs, layer cakes, and jelly rolls can be especially convenient for table runner projects, as they provide a variety of coordinating fabrics in manageable quantities. However, you can also incorporate other fabrics like linen, flannel, or even recycled materials to add texture and visual interest.

**How much quilting is necessary for a table runner?**
The amount of quilting depends on the size of the table runner and the desired look. A general rule is to quilt every 4 to 6 inches to secure the layers and prevent shifting. Though, you can also choose to quilt more densely for added texture and durability. Consider the batting you are using, as some battings require closer quilting than others.

  RETVENKO  
  
  Retvenko leaned against the bar and tucked his nose into his dirty shot glass. The whiskey had failed to warm him. Nothing could get you warm in this Saintsforsaken city. And there was no escaping the smell, the throat-choking stew of bilge, clams, and wet stone that seemed to have soaked into his pores as if he’d been steeping in the city’s essence like the world’s worst cup of tea.  
  
  It was most noticeable in the Barrel, even more so in a miserable dump like this one—a squat tavern wedged into the lower floor of one of the slum’s grimmest apartment buildings, its ceiling bowed by weather and shoddy construction, its beams blackened by soot from a fireplace that had long since ceased to function, the flue clogged by debris. The floor was covered in sawdust to soak up spilled lager, vomit, and whatever else the bar’s patrons lost control of. Retvenko wondered how long it had been since the boards had been swept clean. He buried his nose more deeply in the glass, inhaling the sweet perfume of bad whiskey. It made his eyes water.  
  
  “You’re supposed to drink it, not snort it,” said the barkeep with a laugh.  
  
  Retvenko put his glass down and gazed at the man blearily. He was thick necked and barrel chested, a real bruiser. Retvenko had seen him toss more than one rowdy patron into the street, but it was hard to take him seriously dressed in the absurd fashion favored by the young men of the Barrel—a pink shirt with sleeves that looked fit to split over huge biceps, a garish red-and-orange plaid waistcoat. He looked like a dandified soft-shell crab.  
  
  “Tell me,” said Retvenko. His Kerch wasn’t good to begin with, and it was worse after a few drinks. “Why does city smell so bad? Like old soup? Like sink full of dishes?”  
  
  The barman laughed. “That’s just Ketterdam. You get used to it.”  
  
  Retvenko shook his head. He didn’t want to get used to this city or its stink. His job with Councilman Hoede had been dull, but at least his rooms had been dry and warm. As a treasured Grisha indenture, Retvenko had been kept in comfort, his belly full. He’d cursed Hoede at the time, bored with his work shepherding the merchant’s expensive cargo shipments across the sea, resenting the terms of his contract, the foolish bargain he’d made to get himself out of Ravka after the civil war. But now? Now he couldn’t help thinking of the Grisha workshop at Hoede’s house, the fire burning merrily in the grate, brown bread served with slabs of butter and thick cuts of ham. After Hoede had died, the Kerch Merchant Council had let Retvenko take on sea voyages to pay his way out of the indenture. The money was terrible, but what other options did he have? He was a Grisha Squaller in a hostile city with no skills but the gifts with which he’d been born.  
  
  “Another?” the barman asked, gesturing at Retvenko’s empty glass.  
  
  Retvenko hesitated. He shouldn’t waste his money. If he was smart with his pennies, he would only need to rent himself out for one more voyage, maybe two, and he’d have enough money to pay off his indenture and buy himself a ticket to Ravka in a third-class berth. That was all he needed.  
  
  He was due on the docks in less than an hour. Storms had been predicted, so the crew would rely on Retvenko to master the air currents and guide the ship calmly to whatever port they needed to reach. He didn’t know where and he didn’t care. The captain would call coordinates; Retvenko would fill the sails or calm the skies. And then he would collect his pay. But the winds hadn’t picked up yet. Maybe he could sleep through the first part of the voyage. Retvenko tapped the bar and nodded. What was a man to do? He deserved some comfort in this world.  
  
  “I am not errand boy,” he muttered.  
  
  “What’s that?” the barman asked as he poured out another drink.  
  
  Retvenko gave a dismissive wave. This person, this common lout, could never understand. He toiled away in obscurity. Hoping for what? An extra coin in his pocket? A warm glance from a pretty girl? He knew nothing of glory in battle, what it was to be revered.  
  
  “You Ravkan?”  
  
  Through the muzzy blur the whiskey had created, Retvenko came alert. “Why?”  
  
  “No reason. You just sound Ravkan.”  
  
  Retvenko told himself to relax. Plenty of Ravkans came through Ketterdam looking for work. There was nothing on him that said Grisha. His cowardice filled him with disgust—at himself, the barman, this city.  
  
  He wanted to sit and enjoy his drink. There was no one in the bar to jump him, and despite the barman’s muscles, Retvenko knew he could handle him easily. But when you were Grisha, even staying still could mean courting trouble. There had been more rumors of disappearances in Ketterdam recently—Grisha vanishing from the streets or their homes, probably snapped up by slavers and sold to the highest bidder. Retvenko would not let that happen to him, not when he was so close to buying his way back to Ravka.  
  
  He downed his whiskey, slammed a coin on the counter, and rose from the barstool. He left no tip. A man could work for a living.  
  
  Retvenko felt a little unsteady as he headed outside, and the moist stink of the air didn’t help. He put his head down and set his feet toward Fourth Harbor, letting the walk clear his head. Two more voyages, he repeated to himself, a few more weeks at sea, a few more months in this city. He’d find a way to make it bearable. He wondered if some of his old friends might be waiting for him in Ravka. The young king was said to be handing out pardons like penny candy, eager to rebuild the Second Army, the Grisha military that had been decimated by the war.  
  
  “Just two more trips,” he said to no one, stamping his boots against the spring damp. How could it be this cold and wet this late in the year? Living in this city was like being trapped in the chilly armpit of a frost giant. He passed along Grafcanal, shivering as he glimpsed Black Veil Island tucked into the water’s bend. That was where the Kerch wealthy had once buried their dead, in little stone houses above water level. Some trick of the climate kept the island shrouded in shifting mists, and there were rumors that the place was haunted. Retvenko hastened his steps. He wasn’t a superstitious man—when you had power like his, there was no reason to fear what might lurk in the shadows—but who liked to walk by a graveyard?  
  
  He burrowed deeper into his coat and made quick time down Havenstraat, keeping alert to the movements in every twisting alley. Soon he�  
�d be back in Ravka, where he could stroll the streets without fear. Assuming he got his pardon.  
  
  Retvenko squirmed uncomfortably in his coat. The war had pitted Grisha against Grisha, and his side had been particularly brutal. He’d murdered former comrades, civilians, even children. But what was done could not be undone. King Nikolai needed soldiers, and Retvenko was a very good soldier.  
  
  Retvenko nodded once to the guard stashed in the little booth at the entrance to Fourth Harbor and glanced over his shoulder, confirming he hadn’t been followed. He made his way past the cargo containers to the docks, found the appropriate berth, and stood in line to register with the first mate. Retvenko recognized him from past voyages, always harried and ill-humored, scrawny neck poking from the collar of his coat. He held a thick sheaf of documents, and Retvenko glimpsed the purple wax seal of one of the members of the Kerch Merchant Council. Those seals were better than gold in this city, guaranteeing the best berths in the harbor and preferred access to the docks. And why did the councilmen garner such respect, such advantage? Because of coin. Because their missions brought profit to Ketterdam. Power meant something more in Ravka, where the elements bent to the will of the Grisha and the country was ruled by a proper king instead of a cadre of upstart merchants. Admittedly, Retvenko had tried to depose that king’s father, but the point remained.  
  
  “We’re not ready for the rest of the crew just yet,” the first mate said as Retvenko gave his name. “You can keep warm in the harbormaster’s office. We’re waiting on our signal from the Council of Tides.”  
  
  “Good for you,” Retvenko said, unimpressed. He glanced up at one of the black obelisk towers that loomed over the harbor. If there were any chance that the high and mighty Council of Tides could see him from their watchtower, he would have let them know exactly what he thought with a few choice gestures. They were supposedly Grisha, but had they ever lifted a finger to help the other Grisha in the city? To help those down on their luck who might have welcomed a bit of kindness? “No, they have not,” he answered himself.  
  
  The first mate winced. “Ghezen, Retvenko. Have you been drinking?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “You stink of whiskey.”  
  
  Retvenko sniffed. “Little bit whiskey.”  
  
  “Just dry out. Get yourself some coffee or strong jurda. This cotton has to be in Djerholm in two weeks’ time, and we aren’t paying you to nurse a hangover belowdecks. Understood?”  
  
  “Yes, yes,” Retvenko said with a dismissive wave, already heading toward the harbormaster’s office. But when he was a few steps away, he flicked his wrist. A tiny whirlwind caught the papers the first mate was holding, sending them flying over the docks.  
  
  “Damn it!” he shouted as he went scrambling over the wooden planks, trying to capture the pages of his manifest before they blew into the sea.  
  
  Retvenko smiled with grim pleasure, then felt a wave of sadness overtake him. He was a giant among men, a gifted Squaller, a great soldier, but here he was just an employee, a sad old Ravkan who spoke broken Kerch and drank too much. Home, he told himself. Soon I’ll be home. He would get his pardon and prove himself once more. He would fight for his country. He would sleep under a roof that didn’t leak and wear a blue wool kefta lined with silver fox fur. He would be Emil Retvenko again, not this pathetic shadow.  
  
  “There’s coffee,” said the clerk when Retvenko entered the harbormaster’s office, gesturing toward a copper urn in the corner.  
  
  “Tea?”  
  
  “There’s coffee.”  
  
  This country. Retvenko filled a mug full of the dark sludge, more to warm his hands than anything. He couldn’t bear the taste of it, certainly not without a healthy dose of sugar, which the harbormaster had neglected to supply.  
  
  “Wind blowing in,” said the clerk as a bell clanged outside, shaken by the rising breeze.  
  
  “I have ears,” Retvenko grumbled.  
  
  “Don’t think it will amount to much here, but once you get out of the harbor—”  
  
  “Be silent,” Retvenko said sharply. He was on his feet, listening.  
  
  “What?” said the clerk. “There’s—”  
  
  Retvenko put a finger to his lips. “Someone cries out.” The sound had come from where the ship was docked.  
  
  “It’s just gulls. Sun’s coming up soon and—”  
  
  Retvenko raised a hand, and a gust of air slammed the clerk back into the wall. “I said be silent.”  
  
  The clerk’s mouth dropped open as he hung pinned to the slats. “You’re the Grisha they got for the crew?”  
  
  For Saints’ sake, was Retvenko going to have to pull the air from this boy’s lungs and suffocate him into quiet?  
  
  Through the waxy windows, Retvenko could see the sky beginning to turn blue as dawn arrived. He heard the squawking of gulls searching the waves for breakfast. Maybe the liquor was muddling his mind.  
  
  Retvenko let the clerk drop to the ground. He’d spilled his coffee, but he didn’t want to bother with another cup.  
  
  “Told you it was nothing,” said the clerk as he dragged himself to his feet. “Didn’t have to get all heated up.” The clerk dusted himself off and got resettled behind the desk. “I never met one of you before. Grisha.” Retvenko snorted. The clerk probably had and simply didn’t know it. “You get paid pretty good for the voyages?”  
  
  “Not good enough.”  
  
  “I—” But whatever the clerk was going to say next was lost as the door to the office exploded in a hail of splinters.  
  
  Retvenko’s hands went up to shield his face. He ducked and rolled behind the clerk’s desk for cover. A woman entered the office—black hair, golden eyes. Shu.  
  
  The clerk reached for a shotgun Retvenko saw strapped beneath the desk. “They’ve come for the payroll!” he shouted. “Ain’t no one taking the payroll.”  
  
  Retvenko watched in shock as the gangly clerk stood like some kind of avenging warrior and opened fire. By all that was holy, nothing could motivate the Kerch like cash.  
  
  Retvenko peeked around the desk in time to see the shotgun blast strike the woman directly in the chest. She was thrown backward and collided with the doorjamb, crumpling to the floor. He smelled the sharp burn of gunpowder, the metallic tang of blood. Retvenko’s belly gave a shaming lurch. It had been a long time since he’d seen someone shot down in front of him—and that had been in a time of war.  
  
  “Ain’t no one taking the payroll,” the clerk repeated with satisfaction.  
  
  But before Retvenko could reply, the Shu woman wrapped her bloody hand around the door frame, hauling herself to her feet.  
  
  Retvenko blinked. Just how much whiskey had he had?  
  
  The woman marched forward. Through the remains of her tattered blouse, Retvenko saw blood, flesh pocked with buckshot, and the glint of what looked like metal.  
  
  The clerk fumbled to reload, but the woman was too fast. She grabbed the gun from his hands and swatted him down with it, knocking him sideways with terrible force. She tossed the gun aside and turned her golden eyes on Retvenko.  
  
  “Take payroll!” Retvenko shouted, clambering backward. He dug in his pockets and tossed his nearly empty wallet at her. “Take what you want.”  
  
  The woman smiled slightly at that—with pity? Amusement? Retvenko did not know. But he understood that she had not come for the money at all. She had come for him. And it didn’t matter if she was a slaver or a mercenary or something else entirely. She would face a soldier, not some cowering weakling.  
  
  He leapt to his feet, muscles responding reluctantly to his demands, and shifted into fighting stance. His arms arced forward. A howling wind swept through the room, tossing a chair, then the clerk’s desk, then the steaming coffee urn at the woman. She batted each item away with little interest, as if she were brushing aside stray cobwebs.  
  
  Retvenko focused his power and shoved both his hands forward, feeling his ears pop as the pressure dropped and the wind swelled in a surging thunderhead. Maybe this woman couldn’t be stopped by bullets. Let’s see how she fared against the fury of a storm.  
  
  
  The woman growled as the gale seized her, hurtling her back through the open doorway. She seized the jamb, trying to keep hold.  
  
  Retvenko laughed. He’d forgotten how good it felt to fight. Then, from behind him, he heard a loud crack, the shriek of nails torn free and rending timber. He looked over his shoulder and caught the briefest glimpse of the dawn sky, the wharf. The wall was gone.  
  
  Strong arms seized him, clasping his hands to his sides, preventing him from using his power. He was rising, sailing upward, the harbor shrinking beneath him. He saw the roof of the harbormaster’s office, the body of the first mate in a heap on the dock, the ship Retvenko had been meant to sail on—its deck a mess of broken boards, bodies piled near the shattered masts. His attackers had been there first.  
  
  The air was cold on his face. His heart pounded a ragged rhythm in his ears.  
  
  “Please,” he begged as they soared higher, unsure of what he was pleading for. Afraid to move too suddenly or too much, he craned his neck to look at his captor. Retvenko released a terrified moan, somewhere between a sob and the panicked whine of an animal caught in a trap.  
  
  The man holding him was Shu, his black hair pulled into a tight bun, his golden eyes narrowed against the rush of the wind—and from his back emerged two vast wings that beat against the sky, hinged, gracefully wrought in looping silver filigree and taut canvas. Was he an angel? A demon? Some strange mechanical come to life? Had Retvenko simply lost his mind?  
  
  In the arms of his captor, Emil Retvenko saw the shadow they made cast upon the glittering surface of the sea far below: two heads, two wings, four legs. He had become a great beast, and yet that beast would devour him. His prayers turned to screams, but both went unanswered.

  WYLAN  
  
  What am I doing here?  
  
  That thought had run through Wylan’s head at least six times a day since he’d met Kaz Brekker. But on a night like this, a night when they were “working,” it rose and fell in his head like a nervous tenor practicing his scales: What am I doing here. Wylan tugged at the hem of his sky-blue jacket, the uniform worn by the waiters of Club Cumulus, and tried to look at ease. Think of it as a dinner party, he told himself. He’d endured countless uncomfortable meals at his father’s house. This was no different. In fact, it was easier. No awkward conversations about his studies or when he planned to start classes at the university. All he had to do was stay quiet, follow Kaz’s instructions, and figure out what to do with his hands. Clasp them in front? Too much like a singer at a recital. In back? Too military. He tried just dangling them at his sides, but that didn’t feel right either. Why hadn’t he paid better attention to the way waiters stood? Despite Kaz’s assurances that the second-floor parlor was theirs for the night, Wylan felt certain that at any minute a real member of the staff would enter the room, point at him, and shout, “Impostor!” Then again, Wylan felt like an impostor most days.  
  
  It had been just under a week since they’d reached Ketterdam, almost a month since they’d left Djerholm. Wylan had been wearing Kuwei’s features for most of that time, but whenever he caught a glimpse of his reflection in a mirror or a shop window, it took a long moment to realize he wasn’t looking at a stranger. This was his face now—golden eyes, wide brow, black hair. His old self had been scrubbed away, and Wylan wasn’t sure he knew the person who remained—the person who was standing in a private parlor in one of the Lid’s most luxurious gambling dens, caught up in another of Kaz Brekker’s schemes.  
  
  A player at the table lifted his champagne glass for a refill, and Wylan darted forward from his perch against the wall. His hands were shaking as he took the bottle from the silver ice bucket, but there were some benefits to the years he’d spent at his father’s social functions. He at least knew how to pour a proper glass of champagne without it foaming over. Wylan could almost hear Jesper’s mocking voice. Marketable skills, merchling.  
  
  He dared a glance at Jesper now. The sharpshooter was seated at the table, hunched over his cards. He wore a battered navy waistcoat embroidered with small gold stars, and his rumpled shirt shone white against his dark brown skin. Jesper rubbed a tired hand over his face. They’d been playing cards for more than two hours. Wylan couldn’t tell if Jesper’s fatigue was real or part of the act.  
  
  Wylan filled another glass, focusing on Kaz’s instructions.  
  
  “Just take the players’ orders and keep one ear on Smeet’s conversation,” he’d said. “It’s a job, Wylan. Get it done.”  
  
  Why did they all call it a job? It didn’t feel like working. It felt like missing a step and suddenly finding yourself falling. It felt like panic. So Wylan took stock of the room’s details—a trick he’d often used to steady himself whenever he arrived someplace new or when his father was in a particularly foul mood. He inventoried the pattern of interlocking starbursts that formed the polished wood floor, the shell-shaped nodes of the blown-glass chandelier, the cobalt silk wallpaper flocked with silver clouds. No windows to allow in natural light. Kaz said none of the gambling dens had them, because the bosses wanted players to lose track of time.  
  
  Wylan watched Kaz deal another hand to Smeet, Jesper, and the other players at the round table. He wore the same sky-blue staff jacket as Wylan and his hands were bare. Wylan had to fight not to stare at them. It wasn’t just the strangeness, the wrongness of seeing Kaz without his gloves, it was that his hands seemed animated by a secret machinery Wylan didn’t understand. When he had started to learn figure drawing, Wylan had studied anatomy illustrations. He had a good grasp of musculature, the way bones and joints and ligaments fit together. But Kaz’s hands moved as if they’d been made for no other purpose than to manipulate cards, long white fingers flexing in easy rhythm, the shuffle precise, each turn economical. Kaz had claimed he could control any deck. So why was Jesper losing so badly?  
  
  When Kaz had outlined this part of the plan at the hideout on Black Veil, Wylan had been incredulous, and for once, he hadn’t been the only one with questions.  
  
  “Let me get this straight,” Nina had said. “Your grand scheme is to give Jesper a line of credit and make him play cards with Cornelis Smeet?”  
  
  “Smeet likes high-stakes Three Man Bramble and blondes,” said Kaz. “So we’re going to give him both. I’ll deal the first half of the night, then Specht will take over.”  
  
  Wylan didn’t know Specht well. He was a former navy seaman, a member of the Dregs who had piloted their ship to and from the Ice Court. If Wylan was honest, between the grizzled jaw and the tattoos that ran halfway up Specht’s neck, he found the sailor slightly frightening. But even Specht had looked concerned when he said, “I can deal cards, Kaz, but I can’t control a deck.”  
  
  “You don’t have to. From the time you sit down, it will be an honest game. The important thing is to keep Smeet at the tables until midnight. The shift change is when we risk losing him. As soon as I stand up, he’s going to start thinking about moving on to another game or calling it a night, so you all need to do everything you can to keep his ass firmly planted at that table.”  
  
  “I can handle it,” Jesper said.  
  
  Nina had just scowled. “Sure, and maybe for phase two of this plan I can masquerade as a jurda parem dealer. What could possibly go wrong?”  
  
  Wylan wouldn’t have put it that way exactly, but he agreed. Strongly. They should be keeping Jesper away from gambling dens, not encouraging his love of risk. But Kaz hadn’t been moved.  
  
  “Just do your job and keep Smeet thoroughly enthralled until midnight,” he’d said. “You know what’s on the line.” They all did. Inej’s life. And how could Wylan argue with that? He felt a pang of guilt every time he thought about it. Van Eck had said he would give them seven days to give up Kuwei Yul-Bo—then he would begin torturing Inej. They were almost out of time. Wylan knew he couldn’t have prevented his father from double-crossing the crew and kidnapping her. He knew that, but he still felt responsible.  
  
  “What am I supposed to do with Cornelis Smeet after midnight?” Nina asked.  
  
  “Try to talk him into spending the night with you.”  
  
  “What?” Matthias had sputtered, red flooding his face all the way up to his ears.  
  
  “He won’t say yes.”  
  
  Nina sniffed. “Like hell he won’t.”  
  
  “Nina—” Matthias growled.  
  
  “Smeet never cheats at cards or on his wife,” Kaz said. “He’s like half the amateurs strutting around the Barrel. Most of the time he’s respectable, scrupulous—strict economies and half a glass of wine at dinner. But once a week he enjoys feeling like he’s an outlaw matching wits with the high rollers on East Stave, and he likes a pretty blonde on his arm when he does it.”  
  
  Nina pursed her lips. “If he’s so moral, then why do you want me to try to—”  
  
  “Because Smeet’s rolling in coin, and any self-respecting girl from West Stave would at least make the effort.”  
  
  “I don’t like this,” said Matthias.  
  
  Jesper had smiled his reckless gunslinger’s grin. “To be fair, Matthias, you don’t like much.”  
  
  “Keep Smeet at Club Cumulus from eight bells until midnight,” Kaz said. “That’s four hours of play, so stay smart about it.”  
  
  Nina was certainly doing her best, and Wylan didn’t know whether to be impressed or concerned. She was dressed in a sheer lavender gown rigged with some kind of corset that pushed her cleavage to alarming heights, and though she’d lost weight since her battle with parem, there was still plenty of her for Smeet to grab onto. She’d settled her rump firmly on his knee, arm around his shoulder, and was cooing prettily in his ear, her hands caressing his chest and occasionally slipping beneath his jacket like a beagle searching for treats. She stopped only to order oysters or another bottle of champagne. Wylan knew Nina could handle just about any man and any situation, but he didn’t think she should have to sit half-dressed in a drafty gambling parlor, perched on some leering lawyer’s lap. At the very least, she was probably going to catch cold.  
  
  Jesper folded yet again and blew out a long, exas  
perated breath. He’d been losing slowly for the last two hours. He’d kept his bids cautious, but neither luck nor Kaz seemed to be on his side tonight. How were they supposed to keep Smeet at the table if Jesper ran out of funds? Would the other high-stakes players be enough of a lure? There were a few of them in the room, lingering by the walls, watching the game, each hoping to nab a seat if someone cashed out. None of them knew the real game Kaz was running.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out?

I've just moved into my first-ever studio! While excited about a new beginning, I am still trying to find the way to design the space and furnish it.

My primary goal is to have a bedroom (bed with mattress - loft, daybed?), a living room (sofa + coffee table?), and a study area (small desk?). Tried to combine the bedroom with the living room by getting a loft bed and sofa underneath, but don't know if it works the best (no or small space for other furniture like a wardrobe/clothes rack). I will probably buy a new bed (Murphy bed too expensive, I might aim for a normal bed + small sofa?) and also look for second-hand furniture (bookshelves, wardrobe, etc.). The most important thing for me is how to divide the studio and how to arrange the space with furniture. I know the ""tricks"" with rugs, mirrors, screens/bookshelves as dividers, but it is just hard to place them anywhere.

I am giving an empty canvas, and you can do with it whatever you think is best.

## FAQs Section

navigating the world of coffee scented candles can raise several questions. Hear are answers to some common concerns to help you make an informed decision.

**Are coffee scented candles safe to burn around pets and children?**
While most coffee scented candles are generally safe, it's essential to take precautions when burning them around pets and children. Always keep candles out of reach of children and pets to prevent accidents. Ensure the candle is placed on a stable, heat-resistant surface and never leave it unattended. Choose candles made from natural waxes like soy or beeswax, as they release fewer toxins into the air compared to paraffin wax. If your pet has respiratory sensitivities, monitor their reaction to the candle's scent and discontinue use if any adverse effects are observed.

**How can I maximize the burn time and scent throw of my coffee scented candle?**
To maximize burn time, always trim the wick to about ¼ inch before each use. This prevents smoking and ensures a clean, even burn. Allow the candle to burn for at least 2-3 hours during the first use to create a full melt pool, which will help prevent tunneling. Avoid burning the candle for more than 4 hours at a time to prevent overheating. Keep the candle away from drafts and place it in a location with good air circulation to optimize scent throw.

**What are the differences between natural and synthetic coffee scents in candles?**
Natural coffee scents in candles are derived from essential oils or natural extracts. These scents tend to be more subtle and complex, offering a more authentic coffee aroma. Synthetic coffee scents, conversely, are created in a lab and can be more potent and longer-lasting. While synthetic scents can mimic the aroma of coffee effectively, they may lack the nuances and depth of natural scents. If you prefer a more natural and subtle scent, opt for candles made with essential oils. If you prioritize a strong and long-lasting fragrance,synthetic coffee scents may be a better choice (assuming personal allergies or sensitivities are not triggered).
