I‚Äôd like to find an experience or activity to do with her, gift her memories instead of things, but I‚Äôm a bit unsure what to do that doesn‚Äôt just seem cheap, and since it‚Äôs for a Christmas activity, a hike or other outdoor activity doesn‚Äôt seem like the best option. 

If money wasn‚Äôt an objection, I‚Äôd have picked a spa day, or meditation classes and similar mindful things. Something that takes us out of a hectic day and allows time for her and me. But that‚Äôs bloody expensive usually. 

Other thoughts have been travels, dinners, and such things. But again, money. 

So, without seeming cheap, and without just going on a regular coffee date or whatever, what would you suggest planning?

So I am building a website that shows you ONLY the good news! üåª,"Every morning for the past few years, my day started the same way, phone in hand, scrolling through endless negativity. Wars, scandals, disasters, outrage.

I realized I wasn‚Äôt just reading the news... I was *absorbing it.*  
My mindset, my mood, even my conversations started to feel heavier.

Then one morning, something weird happened. I saw a small, easily-missed story about a 12-year-old who created a cheap water filter for his village. It made me smile, genuinely. For the first time in a while, I felt a spark of *hope.*

That day, I decided to make a habit of searching for good news. But it wasn‚Äôt easy ‚Äî most sites bury positive stories under piles of chaos, since negative news have much more virility than positive news!

So, slowly, over months of late nights and too much coffee, I started building a space where *only* the good stories live.  
Stories of kindness, innovation, progress, and humanity.

# Arabica

Arabica coffee beans are widely appreciated for their smooth and mild flavor profile. These beans make up about 60% of the world‚Äôs coffee production.¬†**Why are Arabica beans so popular?**They are known for their sweet, soft taste and higher acidity compared to other types.

# Factors For Quality

Coffee lovers know that not all coffee beans are created equal. The quality of coffee beans can vary greatly, and several factors contribute to their unique flavors and aromas. Understanding these factors can help you choose the best coffee beans for your taste. In this section, we‚Äôll explore the key elements that determine the quality of coffee beans.

# Origin

The origin of coffee beans plays a crucial role in their flavor profile. Different regions produce beans with distinct tastes and characteristics. Some popular coffee-producing countries include:

* **Brazil:**Known for sweet and nutty flavors.
* **Colombia:**Offers a balanced taste with a mild acidity.
* **Ethiopia:**Famous for fruity and floral notes.
* **Vietnam:**Provides a strong, bold flavor.

Each region‚Äôs climate, soil, and altitude impact the beans‚Äô characteristics. For example, Ethiopian coffee is often grown in highlands, giving it a unique acidity. In contrast, Brazilian coffee is usually grown at lower altitudes, resulting in a milder taste.

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of some regions and their typical flavors:

|Region|Flavor Profile|
|:-|:-|
|Brazil|Sweet, Nutty|
|Colombia|Balanced, Mild Acidity|
|Ethiopia|Fruity, Floral|
|Vietnam|Strong, Bold|

# Altitude

Altitude is another critical factor in determining coffee bean quality. Beans grown at higher altitudes tend to have more complex flavors. This is because the cooler temperatures slow the beans‚Äô maturation, allowing for richer taste development.

High-altitude coffee beans are often described as having bright acidity and intricate flavors. These beans are usually harder and denser, which enhances their quality.

* **Low Altitude (Below 600 meters):**Simple flavors, often mild.
* **Medium Altitude (600-1,200 meters):**Balanced flavors, moderate acidity.
* **High Altitude (Above 1,200 meters):**Complex flavors, bright acidity.

For instance, beans from the Colombian Andes are grown at high altitudes, resulting in their renowned balanced and rich taste. Meanwhile, beans from lower regions are often less acidic and simpler in flavor.

# Processing Method

The processing method significantly influences the flavor and aroma of coffee beans. There are several common methods:

1. **Washed (Wet) Process:**This method involves removing the cherry‚Äôs outer layer before drying. It results in a cleaner and brighter taste.
2. **Natural (Dry) Process:**The beans dry with the fruit still attached, producing a sweeter and fruitier flavor.
3. **Honey Process:**This is a hybrid method where some fruit pulp remains on the bean during drying. It yields a balance of sweetness and acidity.

Washed process beans are often preferred for their clarity and crispness. They are common in regions like Central America. On the other hand, natural process beans from countries like Ethiopia are celebrated for their bold and fruity profiles.

# Harvesting Techniques

Harvesting techniques can also affect the quality of coffee beans. There are mainly two methods:

* **Hand-Picking:**Labor-intensive but allows for selecting only ripe cherries. This method results in higher-quality beans.
* **Strip Picking:**Involves removing all cherries at once. It‚Äôs faster but often includes unripe or overripe cherries.

Hand-picking is common in high-quality coffee production. This method ensures that only the best cherries are selected, enhancing the overall flavor and consistency of the beans.

In regions like Ethiopia and Colombia, hand-picking is a tradition that contributes to their beans‚Äô exceptional quality. Strip picking, while efficient, is usually reserved for lower-grade coffee.

# Brewing Methods

Choosing the best coffee beans can be a delightful journey. Each brewing method brings out unique flavors and aromas. Different methods highlight various aspects of the beans, from boldness to subtle notes. In this guide, explore how different beans complement these brewing techniques.

# Espresso

Espresso is a concentrated coffee shot. It requires finely ground beans. The beans should be dark roasted to create a rich, bold flavor. Here are some key points to consider:

* **Arabica beans**are preferred for their smooth and sweet flavor.
* **Robusta beans**add a stronger, more bitter taste with higher caffeine.
* Blend of both offers a balanced taste.

It‚Äôs essential to use a good quality espresso machine. Consistent pressure and water temperature are crucial. Here‚Äôs a simple table summarizing the ideal characteristics:

* Use medium to dark roast beans for a strong taste.
* Single-origin beans can highlight specific regional flavors.
* Allow the coffee to steep for about 4 minutes.

French Press coffee is about balance. The grind size is crucial. Too fine and it becomes bitter; too coarse and it‚Äôs weak.

# Pour Over

Pour Over brewing is about precision. It allows you to control the water flow and extraction time. For this method, lighter roasts are often preferred. They bring out delicate flavors. Consider these points:

* Light to medium roast beans are ideal.
* Single-origin coffees often shine through.
* Use a gooseneck kettle for a steady pour.

Pour Over is an art. The water temperature should be around 200¬∞F. Consistency in pouring affects the final taste.

# Cold Brew

Cold Brew offers a smooth, less acidic coffee. It uses coarse ground beans steeped in cold water. The process takes about 12 to 24 hours. Key factors include:

* Medium to dark roast beans work best.
* Blend beans for a balanced flavor.
* Use a ratio of 1:8 coffee to water for a strong brew.

Cold Brew is versatile. It can be served over ice or as a base for other coffee drinks. The extended steeping time extracts a mellow, smooth flavor profile.

Sourcing and sustainability are key factors in selecting beans that are not only delicious but also responsible. Understanding how coffee beans are sourced and the sustainability practices involved can make your coffee experience more rewarding and ethical.

# Direct Trade

Direct trade is a coffee sourcing model that emphasizes close relationships between coffee roasters and farmers. This approach ensures that farmers receive fair compensation for their hard work. Here are some reasons why direct trade is important:

* **Quality Control:**Roasters work closely with farmers to improve bean quality, resulting in better coffee.

* **Economic Fairness:**Guarantees a minimum price for coffee, protecting farmers from market volatility.
* **Community Support:**Fair trade premiums are invested in community projects, enhancing local infrastructure and education.

The Ark woke her before the lamps did.

A tremor in the pipes, a sigh in the wall. The faint scrape of metal teeth shifting inside Faithful‚Äôs frame. Alvelyn‚Äôs eyes opened to darkness striped with red-white pulses, her breath misting in the stale dormitory air. For a heartbeat, she simply listened ‚Äî the quiet drip of the basin, the hum of electricity buried beneath steel. The City was already awake, whispering behind its doors.

She rose, brushed her silver hair back, and reached for her keyring. The brass glimmered weakly in the lamplight, still cold from the night. One of them ‚Äî Crooked Eye ‚Äî twitched faintly against her palm. A good omen, she decided. Something would open today.

She brewed her morning drink ‚Äî bitter and metallic, a rationed mock-coffee that tasted faintly of rust ‚Äî and crossed to the Scavengers‚Äô notice board. The sheets there always reminded her of feathers plucked from a dying bird: torn, yellowed, marked by the inked hand of duty.

This morning‚Äôs notice caught her eye.

**‚ÄúAttention!** An anonymous tip has informed us of something. There has been a group spotted with a suspiciously large amount of firearms in the **Magispirum sector**, near the border of Tier 1 and Tier 2 housing districts. **Investigation required.** Do NOT engage unless absolutely necessary.‚Äù

Her gaze lingered on the word *firearms*. It was a kind of door too, she thought ‚Äî the kind that only opened once and could never be shut again. Her fingers traced the edge of the paper, feeling its fibers like veins beneath skin.

She smiled faintly. ‚ÄúSo, a locked house full of teeth.‚Äù

She signed her name at the bottom of the notice and slipped the assignment sheet into her satchel. The other Scavengers barely glanced her way. They had learned she was strange, but she did her work, and the doors obeyed her. That was enough.

**‚Äî**

The path wound downward through the Ark‚Äôs lower arteries, a descent that felt less like walking and more like slipping between ribs. The air thickened with each level, heavy and metallic, tasting of wet copper and the faint tang of old circuits burning out. Lamps flickered along the ceiling in uneven rows, their red-white pulses stuttering like the heartbeat of something feverish and alive. The grates beneath her boots thrummed softly, a vibration running up through her legs into her spine ‚Äî the City‚Äôs murmur, old and endless.

The further she went, the narrower the corridors became. Pipes bulged from the walls like veins ready to burst, dripping condensation in slow, rhythmic beads. Steam hissed from ruptured valves, curling through the dim light in pale ribbons. The occasional door broke the monotony ‚Äî some sealed shut with melted sigils, others gaping open into shadows that reeked of oil and rot.

Alvelyn paused often, listening. Every lock, every seam hummed differently. Some buzzed with fatigue, others shivered with memory. Here and there, she felt whispers against her mind ‚Äî echoes of long-ago footsteps, the ghosts of trades and secrets pressed into the metal by time. The Ark remembered everything, even what it wished it could forget.

She reached a junction where the passage split into three thin corridors. The lamps here had all gone dark, leaving only the faint phosphorescence of the hazard stripes painted on the walls. Her steps slowed to silence. She tilted her head, closing her eyes. Somewhere nearby, a door was trembling.

Her hand drifted to the nearest wall, fingers spread, palm flat. The steel was cold but alive ‚Äî she felt a faint tremor beneath its skin, a heartbeat misaligned with the rest of the City‚Äôs rhythm. She traced the vibration with her fingertips, following it like a trail of invisible ink. It led her left, deeper into the Magispirum sector.

The air changed again ‚Äî thicker now, saturated with the stench of damp gunpowder and machine oil. Every breath rasped down her throat like grit.

Magispirum was different from the Scavengers‚Äô sector. The walls here weren‚Äôt just built; they were *branded.* Sigils, some burned black by old flame, marked the thresholds of every doorway ‚Äî protection charms, locking seals, remnants of rituals half-forgotten. The ground was littered with rust flakes and the shards of glass-sigils shattered long ago. The houses leaned inward, walls pressed close like conspirators whispering to one another through their keyholes.

Alvelyn slowed to a near stop, her steps featherlight. Her silver hair caught the flicker of a dying lamp, flashing crimson, then white, then gone again. She reached out, brushing her fingers along the pitted stone. The walls were sweating, condensation beading along her skin. Beneath that thin film of moisture, something *moved* ‚Äî faint, pulsing. A shiver through metal, as if the City itself was holding its breath.

‚ÄúThere you are‚Ä¶‚Äù she breathed, her voice low and lilting.

Her keys chimed at her hip, a soft, discordant note. She smiled faintly, amused by their impatience. ‚ÄúYes, yes. I smell it too.‚Äù

Crouching beside a bolted gate, she pressed her palm against the seam. The iron was slick, warm from friction. Her eyes narrowed, focusing on the rhythm pulsing through the hinges. There was fear there ‚Äî unmistakable. The lock vibrated unevenly, like a trapped animal‚Äôs breath.

Then came the scent: faint but undeniable ‚Äî oil, steel, and something sharper, acrid, chemical. Gun lubricant.

Alvelyn tilted her head, silver strands falling like thin chains across her face. The grin that touched her lips was crooked, almost tender. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre frightened, little one,‚Äù she murmured, voice a whisper against the gate. ‚ÄúWhoever touched you last made you flinch.‚Äù

The wall said nothing, but she felt its reply ‚Äî the faintest tightening in the hinges, the memory of hands too rough, movements too hurried. Her smile deepened. ‚ÄúAh. Someone‚Äôs been whispering here.‚Äù

She rose slowly, dusting the grime from her skirt. The air around her seemed to hold still, waiting. A droplet of water fell from the pipe above, landing squarely on the back of her hand and sliding down her wrist like a bead of mercury. She rubbed it between her fingers thoughtfully.

The Scavengers‚Äô notice had spoken of guns, but Alvelyn knew weapons came in many shapes. Some were built of steel and powder. Others were built of doors ‚Äî the kind that opened in secret, the kind that screamed when you turned their handles.

And somewhere ahead, one of those doors was calling her name.

**‚Äî**

She found the building described in the notice‚Äî a warehouse that looked half-dead, its roof patched with scavenged plates and its walls streaked with the grime of years. The structure hunched in the Magispirum fog like something abandoned by time, surrounded by pipes that breathed faint clouds of steam into the cold air. Rust flaked from its seams like shedding skin.

The street was quiet here, too quiet. Even the Ark‚Äôs distant hum felt muffled, as if sound itself refused to cross this threshold.

Her eyes swept the building‚Äôs facade. Every edge told a story. The main door was chained and sealed, the links dark with oil and soot. But one had been bent out of shape‚Äîtoo cleanly, too recently. Its bruised metal glimmered under the dim hazard light.

Alvelyn crouched, running her thumb across the dent. The texture was uneven, like the memory of a scream. ‚Äú... whispering here,‚Äù she murmured.

She tilted her head, listening. The air was thick with residue‚Äîgun oil, sweat, and the metallic tang of fear. Even the dust on the threshold had shifted wrong, the marks of boot soles dragged hastily across it. Whoever they were, they had entered quietly but left noise behind.

The street stretched empty in both directions. A scrap of paper drifted lazily through the fog, brushed by wind, and snagged on a broken drainpipe. Even the lamps seemed to dim, their glow holding its breath.

Alvelyn pressed her palm flat to the door. The metal was cold, almost kind, though she felt the faintest tremor pulsing through it‚Äîa heartbeat hiding behind a ribcage. She closed her eyes, leaning forward until her cheek brushed the surface.

The sound came slowly, muffled by layers of steel: footsteps, murmurs, the drag of crates over the floor. The wall‚Äôs pulse quickened under her skin, matching her own.

She smiled faintly. The incorporeal frame shimmered to life in her mind, unseen but vivid‚Äîa door waiting for her hand, patient and eager. All she had to do was turn it.

But the Scavengers‚Äô notice had been clear. No engagement. No openings.

And Alvelyn had learned the price of impatience.

She stayed still for a moment longer, letting the door breathe against her palm. Then she slipped her smallest key‚Äî**Brass-throat**‚Äîfrom the ring at her hip. Its teeth glinted dully, worn smooth from use.

‚ÄúShow me the hinge,‚Äù she whispered.

The key vibrated faintly, humming against her fingers. The world behind her eyelids shifted. A thin seam of light traced itself across her vision‚Äînot real light, but something older, deeper. Through it, she saw the way air flowed through cracks, the shape of bolts beneath the surface, the faint outlines of motion beyond.

Figures flickered like silhouettes on glass: three men, one woman. All armed. All restless. Crates towered in the center of the room. One lay slightly open, its lid splintered at the edge. Inside, dull gray shapes gleamed‚Äîthe throats of rifles, the slick metal of ammunition clips.

Her breath hitched. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù she whispered, eyes half-lidded. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre hiding.‚Äù

Then, movement‚Äî One of the men turned. His gaze snapped toward the main door, sharp as a knife‚Äôs tip. His hand dropped to his weapon.

Alvelyn froze.

The incorporeal frame trembled inside her mind, light flickering like a heartbeat under strain. She could feel the connection fraying‚Äîthe door realizing it was being watched. The pulse quickened, hard, warning her.

She smiled, even as her breath trembled. ‚ÄúYou heard me breathing.‚Äù

Then she withdrew her hand. The connection snapped shut with a sigh. The metal cooled instantly, the wall exhaling its tension.

She straightened, brushing her skirt clean, and glanced once more at the warped chain. The silence pressed close again, almost relieved.

‚ÄúForgive me,‚Äù she murmured, to the door. ‚ÄúYou did your best.‚Äù

Her footsteps were soundless as she circled the warehouse, her shadow gliding along the walls. The narrow alley behind it was half-swallowed by pipes and discarded metal sheets. Water dripped from a leaking conduit, pooling in a shallow basin at her feet. She paused, scanning the darkness.

And there‚Äîit waited.

A smaller door, nearly invisible, half-buried behind a curtain of scrap. Its hinges were crooked, its handle dulled by years of grime. Someone had tried to hide it‚Äîpoorly. A coward‚Äôs attempt.

Alvelyn brushed aside the sheet metal, her movements unhurried. The door trembled faintly when she touched it, the vibration weak and guilty.

‚ÄúPoor thing,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve used you too, haven‚Äôt they?‚Äù

The wood‚Äîif it was still wood‚Äîwas damp and pitted, soft at the corners. Her fingertips traced its frame, finding the points where tools had dug and pried. Beneath the grime, faint scorch marks glowed pale under the lamp‚Äôs pulse. Someone had forced it open before.

She didn‚Äôt push it. Not yet.

Instead, she drew **Brass-throat** again and held it against the seam. The key hummed quietly, sympathetic.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember your face,‚Äù she murmured. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre ready to open again, I‚Äôll be here.‚Äù

She stood there for a moment longer, listening to the faint heartbeat of the building, the way its walls creaked and sighed like something too full of secrets.

Then she turned away, blending back into the fog.

Behind her, the hidden door shuddered once, just barely‚Äîlike a breath it couldn‚Äôt quite release.

**‚Äî**

By the time Alvelyn returned to the Scavengers‚Äô station, her palms still smelled faintly of iron and dust, and the edges of her sleeves were stained with the ash-gray residue of the Magispirum fog. The trek back through the City‚Äôs lower arteries had been long ‚Äî full of dripping pipes, watchful shadows, and the distant hiss of generators hidden behind sealed panels. The station itself was buried beneath an abandoned freight hub, its entrance disguised by layers of broken plating and flickering signage. To most, it looked like another dead corridor.

To Alvelyn, it felt like home ‚Äî a door pretending to be a wall.

She slipped through the narrow threshold, boots echoing on the grated floor. The air inside was thick with the scent of oil and static. Lanterns swayed gently from hooks, their dim light pooling over maps, charts, and stacked manifests. Men and women hunched over tables, muttering in low voices as they logged salvage tallies and mechanical parts scavenged from the wastelands below.

Her arrival drew glances ‚Äî not many, but enough. The sound of her keys at her hip broke through the drone of quills and scraping metal. A few Scavengers paused their work, eyes flicking toward her, then away again as if they hadn‚Äôt looked at all. One of them whispered something she didn‚Äôt quite catch, though she heard the word ‚Äúdoors‚Äù hissed like a superstition.

At the far end of the room, the overseer sat behind a long metal counter bolted into the wall ‚Äî a woman in a heavy coat with a copper monocle pressed against one eye. Her hair was tied back with wire, and her hands were darkened with grease. She didn‚Äôt look up until Alvelyn stopped in front of her desk, sliding a thin slate of etched metal onto the surface.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù the overseer asked, voice low and steady.

‚ÄúFirearms,‚Äù Alvelyn said. ‚ÄúFour people. One female, three male. They‚Äôve stockpiled inside an old warehouse in Magispirum Tier Two. The locks are compliant. The walls are‚Ä¶ frightened. The west-side hatch has been tampered with. That‚Äôs where they move supplies.‚Äù

The overseer blinked once, then leaned back in her chair. ‚ÄúYou saw all that without entering?‚Äù

‚ÄúI listened.‚Äù

The copper monocle caught the light, flaring orange as the woman studied her. ‚ÄúDoors talk, do they?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey always do,‚Äù Alvelyn said, tilting her head with a faint smile. ‚ÄúYou just have to learn which ones lie.‚Äù

For a moment, neither spoke. The overseer‚Äôs expression softened by a fraction ‚Äî not warmth, but a flicker of curiosity. She took up a steel stamp from the desk, pressed it into an inked sigil, and marked the edge of Alvelyn‚Äôs report. The sound rang sharp and final.

‚ÄúGood work, Dorsaint,‚Äù the overseer said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll make yourself useful here.‚Äù

Alvelyn inclined her head, smile widening by the barest degree. ‚ÄúI do enjoy useful doors.‚Äù

She turned to leave, but the murmurs rose again ‚Äî low, uneasy ripples through the hall. A young scavenger sitting by the manifest bench leaned toward another and whispered, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the one who talks to walls.‚Äù The other only nodded, pretending not to listen while his fingers twitched nervously against the ledger.

Alvelyn heard every word. Her keys chimed as she passed them, light and mocking, and she let out a small laugh under her breath ‚Äî the kind of laugh that makes quiet rooms hold still.

At the corridor‚Äôs mouth, she paused beneath a flickering lamp. The light blinked once, twice, and steadied. She tilted her head toward it, whispering softly:

‚ÄúDoors are always listening. Even the ones that stay shut.‚Äù

Then she stepped out into the Ark‚Äôs humming arteries, the sound of machinery blending with her fading footsteps.

Far away, deep in Magispirum‚Äôs tiered fog, a warehouse shivered. Its locks clinked faintly, as though caught in a dream. And somewhere inside, one trembling latch clicked ‚Äî a single, echoing sound, quiet as breath ‚Äî as if answering her from afar.

I have the mods More Plantable Plants and Growable Coffee and Tea but I can't get the raw coffee beans from the coffee mod to be plantable at the same time that something like moon sugar or sugar is from the other mod. (I believe this is a leveled list issue but correct me if my terminology is off)

Since I also have Sweets and Such, I like being able to live entirely on cookies, cupcakes, tea and coffee, but for that I need to be able to grow sugar, moon sugar and coffee to be able to make my own.

I'm contemplating playing a very high difficulty/I'm a scrub game with neuroses and failure aplenty using Stress and Fear, probably eating WAY too much candy and caffeine in the process. I need mats.

If anybody could suggest which method to use (Synthesis, Wrye Bash, SSEdit?) I'd appreciate it. 

I have a custom mod list I've been working on for years, but I haven't branched out into custom patching. Yet. The best I've managed is to alter Hulda to be able to sell me coffee beans and altering the Perigo custom merchant to sell me other things I need.

So between me and him are 7 levels. He is a highly intelligent person, strict and old school, and can be very mean and upfront, arrogant and domineering. In my 2 years of working here I interacted with him just 2 times and felt tired after. I mean he is demeaning, demanding and all that. We used to joke in our department that he has such cold eyes that when he cuts the onion, the onion cries.

We met at an event, not work related. I told him I work in the same company and he said oh, nice. Nothing else. We had drinks and we ended up alone and he started telling me how much he dislikes his wife, how he married her only because he felt the pressure to get married, how lonely he feels, how much he regrets now going for the love of his life because he was young and poor. He said his wife is irritating him and he rather spends his time at the plant or offices and not at home. She also works in the company. They don't have kids. He even cried. We ended up having s3x. It was intense and I was in paln the next day because he was angry and took it out on me. I don't think I am special or anything. I don't think he lied to me about his wife to get me to do it. I am beautiful but nothing else. 

He remembers me and remembers everything. We met on Friday at the coffee shop from the office. He gave me a very unfriendly look and walked by me without saying anything.

1nzerdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1nzerdj/healing_journey/,Healing Journey,"Hi everyone,

These posts really helped keep me optimistic during my healing so I want to return the favor :). I‚Äôll try to keep it short but there‚Äôs a lot to share lol. Feel free to ask any questions! 

I was diagnosed with gastritis in May from taking an NSAID prescribed to me by my Dr for my kidney stones. I only took two doses, both times on a full stomach. It wasn‚Äôt an NSAID I was familiar with or had taken before. Immediately after taking it, I felt what I thought were chest pains. In retrospect, it was intense acid reflux that went away after a few hours. 

Symptoms started as:
- tightness in my stomach 
- very localized pain in my stomach
- nausea 
- a little bit of acid reflux (nothing debilitating) 
- constipated
- low tolerance for majority of foods

Once I was diagnosed, I immediately started a bland diet. I followed the diet strictly for 5 months and did not ‚Äúcheat‚Äù or deviate one time. I think this was key for my healing! I did not have any caffeine, THC or alcohol. My meals were very small for the first 3 months and then I gradually increased them. I ate every 2-3 hours so my stomach acid wouldn‚Äôt irritate me further. 

Every day looked the same and this is what I ate:
- oatmeal with banana
- ground turkey/chicken 
- chicken/turkey breast 
- boiled carrots
- rice
- mashed potatoes & sweet potatoes (no skin) 
- exhausted 24/7 
- manuka honey 

For the first 4-4.5 months I went completely dairy and gluten free. I slowly started to reintroduce sourdough, milk, Greek yogurt, pasta noodles (plain). At this point, I also slowly reintroduced fats - 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil in lunch & dinner. Gradually built up to 1 full teaspoon, avocado, cheese, etc. 

I was prescribed a PPI for 3 months but felt it was slowing down my digestion and made me feel depressed. Originally, I started on omeprazole but it didn‚Äôt help so my dr switched to me to lansoprazole 30mg 2x/day. I didn‚Äôt take any supplements. 

Prior to this, I ate healthy/well (unless on vacation) and strength trained 5-6x/week for 10 years. I drank maybe once a week or every other week. The first 3.5 months, I couldn‚Äôt workout at all. Long walks even irritated me üò≠. This was super hard for my mental health but I was determined to heal so I didn‚Äôt push myself and slowly started working out again when I felt well enough. Some days I felt good enough to try, some I couldn‚Äôt make it off the couch. My heating pad was my best friend for a long time. 

HEALING IS NOT LINEAR. This is probably one of the hardest parts of gastritis - one day you feel great, then a week of pain comes from no where. Staying on a bland diet helped my anxiety because I wasn‚Äôt questioning if it was something I did or ate. I knew it was my stomach just trying to heal. It felt defeating and depressing. Reaching out to family and friends for support is huge. Try to remember this is temporary and in the grand scheme of life, a few months to a year is a blip in time. Pick up a new hobby you love. Call your loved ones. Get outside for a walk or just to sit in fresh air. Do whatever it takes to keep your mental health as balanced as possible! 

I‚Äôm 5 months in and can officially drink coffee every day again with ZERO symptoms! I haven‚Äôt tried alcohol or spicy food yet but plan to in the next few months when it feels right. My meals still look pretty bland 90% of the time but I‚Äôm passing all reintroductions so far! 

Everyone‚Äôs healing journey is so different. Some it takes a few weeks, some months to a year. This IS something you can heal from, it‚Äôs NOT a life long condition like many people say. People who can‚Äôt heal aren‚Äôt following a strict bland diet until they‚Äôre 100% healed. Like I said before, this is KEY. It SUCKS but it works. People who have healed aren‚Äôt hanging around on subs, they‚Äôre out living their life. Don‚Äôt let the negativity get to you. Maintaining a positive attitude really helps in healing (look into the vagus nerve for more info). 

I originally joined the Facebook group and bought the gastritis healing cookbook but ultimately left the group because there was too much fear mongering from the admins going on. While there are some good recipes and info, keep in mind the author nor admins are  physicians. Take what they say with a grain of salt. A few of the recipes kept me in a flair unknowingly. Everyone is different! After I left the group, I think my healing started to progress more because I wasn‚Äôt surrounded by the feeling of dread and fear mongering anymore. 

P.S. -  My heart goes out to everyone with autoimmune conditions who truly can‚Äôt get rid of this ü•∫ü´∂üèª. ",1,1759744380.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

We're redoing our kitchen in January, and we're just finishing up the design. What are your thoughts on the layout - are we missing anything major? What would you add/take away?

FYI the space over the sink will be a drying rack. We're quite tall so this works!

The other side of the room is a cabinet for the dryer (rare in a British kitchen!), coffee station/storage, and a breakfast nook (third slide).",3,1759744343.0,kitchenremodel,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs a testament to how life can throw a curveball at anyone, no matter how successful they once were.

A while back, my friend was a high-flying banker in Nairobi. He was so well-off that he actually sponsored me through high school. He didn't have to, but that's the kind of guy he is‚Äîgenerous, kind, and always looking to lift others up. I will forever be grateful for his help.

Things were going great for him. He had a solid career, a beautiful family, and a bright future. Then, the unexpected happened: his contract ended. What was supposed to be a temporary break turned into a four-year struggle to find another solid job in the banking sector.The corporate world that had once embraced him had now, for reasons I can't fully grasp, turned its back.

Despite the setback, he's not one to give up. He started several small businesses around Nairobi to provide for his family. He even has a home in his rural village (often called ""shags"" here), a sign of his earlier success and a fallback plan. But as anyone who's tried knows, the world of small business is brutal. He's been struggling to make ends meet, and the businesses aren't performing as he hoped.

To make ends meet and put food on the table, this man‚Äîa former banker who once helped others reach their dreams‚Äîis now an Uber driver, using his own car to hustle every day. There is no shame in it, but it‚Äôs a hard and humbling job for someone who came from a position of such privilege.The hardest blow came recently. After four years of him struggling to find his footing, his wife has decided she wants a divorce. She's demanding a 50/50 split of their assets, along with monthly upkeep for his kids and school fees. It's a devastating position to be in. The same man who once gave so much is now fighting to hold onto what little he has left, all while trying to keep his family together.

This story isn't a plea for help, but a sobering reminder that life doesn't care about your past achievements, your good deeds, or your future plans. It can be a cruel, unrelenting force that humbles even the strongest among us. I'm telling this story to get it off my chest and to remind people that the person driving your Uber or serving you coffee might have an incredible, heartbreaking story behind their smile.

If you have a similar story, or just want to share your thoughts, I'm all ears. Sometimes, just knowing you're not alone can make all the difference.",3,1759744328.0,nairobi,2,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that‚Äôs okay.
Because if you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post.

Maybe it‚Äôs a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn‚Äôt know you needed, until now.

Because I don‚Äôt believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it‚Äôs been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers‚Ä¶ this, this is what I‚Äôve been missing.
(‚ÄúAnd in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make‚Äù ‚Äì The Beatles.)


---

So hey,

I‚Äôm 27. I‚Äôm a doctor. From India.
And no, I won‚Äôt diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I‚Äôm more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I‚Äôm a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The ‚Äúquotes random Marvel lines in conversations‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äústill mad about how Interstellar messed with time‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äúloses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi‚Äù kind.

I fall hard for characters that don‚Äôt exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I‚Äôm the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that‚Äôs equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.
Other times I vanish down a rabbit hole about marine biology, quantum reality, or nanotech in surgery because my brain whispers, dig deeper bro, we‚Äôre not done yet.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I‚Äôm learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.


---

Now there‚Äôs this voice in my head.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don‚Äôt settle.
Fix what‚Äôs broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn‚Äôt care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we‚Äôre really chasing under all this noise.

I‚Äôm not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(‚ÄúNot all those who wander are lost‚Äù ‚Äì Tolkien.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let‚Äôs keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it:
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun.
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists.
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul.
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses.
Argue over which villain actually had a point.
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity.
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much.
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get.
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.
Sherlock made neuroanatomy exciting for me.
I‚Äôve been broken. Really broken. But I never stopped showing up.
I‚Äôve walked alone more times than I‚Äôd like. Still do. But I haven‚Äôt stopped hoping.
I don‚Äôt want perfect. I want present. I want real. I want depth.
I want someone who knows how to sit in silence and still be there fully.


---

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners...
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

What woudl i do if i dont love you

Watch the sun turns to the moon

I know that time gets tuff 

But our love will always be true



And im faithful full of love 4u

Lay in bed bet that u miss me too

Took a polaroid when u smiled so i think of u

Reminds me of the story how u spilled all ur parfume

And im greatful for the things u do

So if you‚Äôre:

A little cracked but still trying your best.
Empathetic but forged of inner steel.
Smart but soft in the ways that matter.
Funny but carrying some quiet storms.
Brilliant in your own messy, imperfect chaos.

Then maybe just maybe this post is the right kind of crazy for you.

This is my leap.
No filters. No flex.
Just me. Honest. Tired. Still dreaming.

So if any part of this made your chest warm or your brain go, same,
Send a meme. A quote. A lyric. A thought. Anything.

And if nothing else?

Let‚Äôs start with a study session.
Two nerds in different corners...
Screens glowing. Hearts open. Minds focused.

Showing up.
Holding space.
Getting stronger.

Together.

Because in the end we‚Äôre all just stories trying to make sense of ourselves.
Let‚Äôs make this one a damn good one.

Still trying.
Still here.

Let‚Äôs be real for a sec.

This might run long. Might wander a bit.
But that‚Äôs okay.
Because if you‚Äôre the kind of person who feels a little too much, who thinks way too deeply during those brutally quiet 2:27 a.m. hours, who scrolls through curated perfection but secretly just wants something raw and unfiltered... then maybe this isn‚Äôt just a post.

Maybe it‚Äôs a tiny nudge from the universe.
A crack in the chaos.
A weird little sign that this might be your leap of faith.
One you didn‚Äôt know you needed, until now.

Because I don‚Äôt believe people stumble into our lives by mistake.
Some show up to test our patience.
Some derail us, turn everything upside down.
But then...
Some just feel like home in the strangest, most unexpected ways.
They arrive, and your soul exhales like it‚Äôs been holding its breath for years.
And quietly, something inside you whispers‚Ä¶ this, this is what I‚Äôve been missing.
(‚ÄúAnd in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make‚Äù ‚Äì The Beatles.)

So hey,

I‚Äôm 27. I‚Äôm a doctor. From India.
And no, I won‚Äôt diagnose you unless you sneeze like a suspicious side quest and my reflex jumps into action.

But I‚Äôm more than a white coat and a stethoscope.
I‚Äôm a loud and proud nerd.
Not the cute, Pinterest-board kind.
The ‚Äúquotes random Marvel lines in conversations‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äústill mad about how Interstellar messed with time‚Äù kind.
The ‚Äúloses sleep over fictional deaths and weird plot holes in sci-fi‚Äù kind.

I fall hard for characters that don‚Äôt exist.
I spiral into thoughts about time, death, memory, consciousness... you know, the casual stuff.
Sometimes I sit with a cup of chai like I‚Äôm the main character in a noir detective story, trying to solve a case that‚Äôs equal parts medicine and existential meltdown.

I speak English, Hindi, Urdu, and a bit of Arabic (barely enough to survive a desert trip).
Oh, and I‚Äôm learning Klingon. Because curiosity and chaos kind of run the show up here.

Now there‚Äôs this voice in my head.

It isn‚Äôt always kind.
It‚Äôs definitely not gentle.
But damn, it keeps me going.

It says:
Think harder.
Don‚Äôt settle.
Fix what‚Äôs broken.
Show up even when everyone else bails.

It doesn‚Äôt care about grades or gold medals or what some fancy LinkedIn profile says.
It cares about truth. About purpose.
About understanding this wild, painful, beautiful world.
Why grief hijacks the brain.
How trauma gets buried in bones.
What we‚Äôre really chasing under all this noise.

I‚Äôm not wired for surface-level anything. Never was.
I need depth. I need meaning.
I want to know what makes people tick and what makes them stay.
(‚ÄúNot all those who wander are lost‚Äù ‚Äì Tolkien.)


---

So what am I even looking for?

Let‚Äôs keep it messy and honest.
I want someone real.

Not someone who disappears for a week and returns with a casual ‚Äúhey‚Äù like they didn‚Äôt leave your head spinning.
Not someone who opens with ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and ends it with ‚Äúlol.‚Äù
Not another highlight reel, scared of showing the mess underneath.

I want the long, meandering, deeply weird conversations.
The kind that starts with a dumb meme and ends in a debate about dreams, childhood, death, and why we still miss people who never apologized.

Someone who says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not okay, can we just exist side by side today?‚Äù without feeling like a burden.
Someone who hears a lyric and feels it deep in their ribs.
Someone who smells something random and suddenly time-travels back to a memory they can‚Äôt explain.
Someone who laughs like a gremlin at stupid jokes, then goes quiet thinking about souls, stars, and why love always feels like both a war and a poem.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect.
Just be human.
Just be honest.
Just... be there.


---

But let‚Äôs get even more specific.
Right now?
I want a study buddy.

Not the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs do one pomodoro and ghost each other for eternity‚Äù type.
Nope. I‚Äôm talking real. Consistent.
Like, actually showing up even virtually.

You don‚Äôt have to be in medicine.
You could be studying law, architecture, psychology, space dust, or just... life.
You could be healing. That counts too.

I want someone I can sit with virtually while we both fight our own dragons.
No pressure to talk all the time. Just be in the same digital space. Two people grinding. Growing.

Imagine it:
Midnight hustle.
Lo-fi beats or soft rain sounds in the back.
Steaming mugs of chai or coffee.
Occasional breaks where we drop either the dumbest memes or the deepest truths.

We keep each other on track.
We say, ‚ÄúYou got this. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù
We share that random quote that hits way too hard.
We remind each other why we started.

Maybe we make it fun.
Send a quote before we begin.
End the night with a trivia game or a challenge that makes us laugh till our faces hurt.
Doesn‚Äôt matter how.
As long as we grow. Together.

And who knows?
Maybe this study session... maybe this is our shared leap of faith.
The one that keeps us grounded when the world feels too loud.


---

Outside study time though?

Let‚Äôs build a weird little friendship.

Watch movies and analyze characters like we‚Äôre their therapists.
Share playlists like we‚Äôre swapping pieces of our soul.
Talk about mythologies, science, dreams, multiverses.
Argue over which villain actually had a point.
Speak in bad Russian or British accents because life‚Äôs too short for dignity.
Send random voice notes at 4 a.m. when everything feels a bit too much.
Make inside jokes that no one else would ever get.
Create a chaotic but cozy digital home made of late-night silences and overcaffeinated chaos.


---

And just a few confessions to keep it real:

I‚Äôve imagined being an X-Men way more than I should probably admit.

1nzenv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleanSweepers/comments/1nzenv0/experience_the_magic_of_nellies_laundry_detergent/,Experience the Magic of Nellie's Laundry Detergent with POW Powder?,"I‚Äôve been using the Nellie's NLS-250R w POW laundry detergent for a solid month now. If you‚Äôre like me, always hunting for ways to blend sustainability with functionality, this product may already be on your radar. The promise of eco-friendly cleaning attracted me at first, but it‚Äôs the overall experience that turned doing laundry‚Äîa chore I usually dread‚Äîinto a strangely satisfying routine.

**Packaging and Design**  
The packaging is simple yet practical. It comes in a sturdy tin that stands out as both reusable and visually appealing. I appreciate that the container is easy to store and doesn‚Äôt take up too much space in my laundry cabinet. Not to mention, it has a nostalgic charm without looking outdated. The powder itself is finely milled, which ensures it dissolves effortlessly, even in colder water‚Äîa huge plus for energy conservation. 

[Discover if Nellie's NLS-250R w POW is on sale at Amazon.](https://app.womanreview.com/p/b089dnjtkd/)

**Performance and Cleaning Power**  
I initially tested this detergent on basic loads‚Äîthink everyday T-shirts, jeans, and gym gear. The results? Spotless, fresh-smelling clothes without any heavy perfumed scent. What really impressed me was its performance with tougher stains. The addition of POW Powder seemed to live up to its claims; it effectively tackled coffee marks and ink stains from my kid‚Äôs school uniforms. Unlike other detergents I‚Äôve used, there was no leftover residue. Even my high-efficiency washer seemed to respond well to the minimal-suds formula.

**Good Points**  
- Dissolves completely in cold and hot water, ideal for energy-efficient washing  
- Minimal ingredients, reducing exposure to harsh chemicals  
- Brightens whites and maintains fabric vibrancy  
- Eco-friendly, septic-safe, and gentle on sensitive skin  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Initially tricky to determine the right dosage (some trial and error was needed)  
- The lack of added fragrance might not appeal to those who prefer a prominent scent  
- Heavier, dark fabrics sometimes felt less soft compared to results from liquid detergents  

**Suitable Audience**  
After testing this for different family needs, I‚Äôd say Nellie‚Äôs powder is an excellent choice for eco-conscious households or those keen on sustainable alternatives. If you‚Äôre someone who deals with sensitive skin issues, this detergent‚Äôs no-residue, chemical-free formula could be a game-changer. However, if you‚Äôre a fan of fragranced laundry detergents, the scent-free aspect might feel a bit underwhelming.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it to popular brands like Tide Pods or Arm & Hammer, Nellie's focuses heavily on simplicity and eco-consciousness. While the mainstream brands excel at delivering varied fragrances and ultra-soft impacts on heavy fabrics, they typically come packed with chemicals that don‚Äôt sit well with everyone. A name like Seventh Generation stands as a closer competitor for its natural formulation, but I feel Nellie‚Äôs wins by being even simpler and leaving zero residue. The packaging here also feels more thoughtfully designed for sustainability.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
In terms of value for money, I‚Äôd say this product holds its ground against competitors. Each tin promises up to 250 loads, and although there‚Äôs a mild learning curve on how much powder to scoop per load, it genuinely delivers on its claims. The lack of flashy marketing gimmicks reassures me that the quality of cleaning hasn‚Äôt been compromised. For someone who considers both cost-performance ratios and environmental impact, this hits a sweet spot.

I don't know the title, nor do I know the authors name, but I can tell you almost the entire plot.  It was about Jason and Damian trying to live a life without the bats, and trying to hide from the League of Assassins with Jason working as a barista in a local coffee shop. He never becomes red hood and instead focused on raising Damian. He tries to stay away from hero stuff, but his plan is ruined when the Young Justice team show up at the coffee shop that he works at.

I‚Äôm trying to identify a candy I used to eat in the early 2000s that a friend would bring me from Germany. Here‚Äôs everything I remember:

It was round/oval and chewy (soft, not a hard candy) ‚Äì more like a gummy caramel than a classic hard bonbon.

It had two colours: brown and white in each piece.

It was individually wrapped in transparent plastic, so you could see the candy inside.

The corners of the wrapper were coloured differently depending on the flavour:

dark brown for coffee

lighter brown for caramel

greenish for the minty ones

Flavours were coffee, caramel and a slightly minty one.

They came in a bag, not a tin or box.

I had them between ~2000 and 2005.

Definitely a German brand.

I open the door and called out, and instead of making her an asshole to me,  my brain shortcutted and tried to turn everyone else into zombies. Because zombies were MORE BELIEVABLE, than Kelly being mad at me for no reason.

1nzei1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_createdjustforthi-23/comments/1nzei1k/06102025/,06/10/2025,"I woke up feeling kind of sick. 

We went for brunch earlier and I didn‚Äôt feel hungry for it but then I had a bite of halloumi and my appetite came back. I had a poached egg, some halloumi and spinach and a guava juice. I gave mum her presents and she was really really happy with them. I still feel like it‚Äôs not enough though. She said it is but idk. I wish I had something more‚Ä¶ tangible. Dad‚Äôs kind of annoying me. It‚Äôs mum‚Äôs birthday, a milestone birthday, and he‚Äôs barely making a fuss - knowing full well she enjoys a birthday and celebration. She‚Äôs not a huge birthday person, none of us are - but she likes to still feel special and do something to celebrate and she likes a present. And he‚Äôs got her a book voucher and no card. He and I are splitting the professional house deep clean cost but still. Also I guess we had a very expensive lunch hater day. But still. She‚Äôs your WIFE who does SO MUCH for you. Celebrate her, ffs?? He doesn‚Äôt care about his own birthdays and we‚Äôre all fairly lowkey with them, but mum and I I think still want it to be a special day. It makes me feel unsure about Andy. He doesn‚Äôt care at all about birthdays and that‚Äôs fine and I try to respect that, but does that mean he‚Äôs going to more or less ignore mine? Or do the absolute bare minimum? Because I think while I don‚Äôt like big birthdays, I like to have it made special by my parents and partner and maybe a best friend sort of thing. No parties, no major presents or anything. But a lunch or a dinner, a card and a thoughtful present of some kind - it could cost $2 idc I just want some thought and love behind it. And to be made to feel special. So I am a birthday girl‚Ä¶ but just in a very private, inexpensive sense? I don‚Äôt want lavish restaurants, tbh I think a picnic or fish and chips at the beach or a home cooked dinner or whatever is *perfect*. Maybe for big milestone birthdays doing something a little more could be nice, but even then I‚Äôd rather just idk‚Ä¶ go somewhere. Like for every new decade it‚Äôs a holiday. Or idk. Whatever. But I don‚Äôt actually care about that. I just want THOUGHT and EFFORT. And seeing how dad handles birthdays for mum knowing how he feels about his own makes me think of Andy and I and I don‚Äôt want to have that sort of a dynamic? I don‚Äôt know. I think in an ideal world? He‚Äôd give me a midnight happy birthday kiss, then we‚Äôd wake up in the morning and cuddle *etc* and then I could have a long delicious shower and we‚Äôd just have a coffee or whatever with our puppy outside and he‚Äôd give me some sort of card and present. And maybe I‚Äôd walk into the living room and there‚Äôd be fresh flowers and things to celebrate a lil more. And then at some point he‚Äôd take me out for lunch or dinner, I realise I‚Äôm a winter baby so a park picnic probably isn‚Äôt in question but that‚Äôs the dream. But a walk along a wintery beach with him and our puppy and then having a late lunch in a cosy pub or cafe? Idk I‚Äôm just thinking of stuff. So it‚Äôs low key, but special. And then maybe a movie night to end all movie nights with a semi-pillow fort set up and candles and we could get a lil tipsy annnnddd basically spend the night with some part of him inside me as much as possible, not to be yknow‚Ä¶ crude. I think that‚Äôs a dream birthday. Idk about the present. Something sentimental and romantic is the ultimate dream, but I‚Äôm a material girl too so some pretty earrings or necklace every now and then isn‚Äôt going to hurt my feelings. I love the idea of jewellery from him, I think a) because I love pretty things but mostly b) I love the idea of wearing something and it making me think of him every time I see it and it being a sort of very private way of feeling like I‚Äôm his because I‚Äôm wearing this, yknow. I think when I think of marriage and I really don‚Äôt care much about it at all, I do like the idea of a ring to sort of symbolise that I‚Äôm his and no one else‚Äôs, yknow. I can take or leave the wife/husband titles, the legalities and I don‚Äôt want a *wedding* wedding at all - I could be a billionaire and I‚Äôd still quietly elope I just don‚Äôt want one - but to wear a little something every day for the rest of my life to symbolise my forever commitment to the love of my life‚Ä¶ idk, I like that. So even if I never get married, I kind of think I‚Äôd still want a ring of some sort. Is that weird? But then why is it weird? You can make your own rules and way of being together. So. Yeah. Idk. Anyway I‚Äôve rambled. I‚Äôm kind of annoyed with dad for not doing more. I know he loves mum and all, he does show that in many ways, but I just feel like she does so much for him and he doesn‚Äôt do enough in return and she deserves more. Anyway. So I also think that‚Äôs my ideal birthday, just him and I. And our puppy. And we‚Äôd do the same for his birthday. I think it‚Äôs lowkey enough for him? No crazy fuss, but just having an extra special day together? Where we‚Äôre more focused on one another? No life admin or whatever else, just us and being extra present in the moment together. That sounds so lame but idc. I mean I‚Äôll do whatever he wants of course if that‚Äôs not lowkey enough then I‚Äôll respect that but I think it would be. Nothing OTT or overly public or anything, just make him feel like the absolute king he is. Which tbh shouldn‚Äôt be reserved only for birthdays but I think you just amp it up a little. Anyway. 

I went down a Steve Irwin rabbit hole and now I‚Äôm crying. I love that whole family. Steve and Terri are so perfect together. And their kids grew up so well! It‚Äôs so weird how people are crazy thirsty over Robert like excuse me he‚Äôs a tiny little boy - I mean he‚Äôs not now but he is. They‚Äôre all just so lovely. I remember we went to their zoo on a family holiday once agggeessssss ago, and I saw Darwin‚Äôs tortoise and looking at it knowing how old it is and the history it‚Äôs lived through blew my mind. Imagine having Charles Darwin and Steve Irwin as your human pals. I wonder if there‚Äôs something about the -win in their names. I think I was like‚Ä¶ 11? 10? Idk. I‚Äôm fairly sure it‚Äôs the holiday where I have purple John Lennon style sunnies and two plaits in nearly every photo and doing the peace sign. And I got to see wild dolphins up close in Noosa or near there and hand feed them. I wonder if that was cruel. I hope not. Anyway I remember when I heard about Steve dying, my main memory is changing my MSN status to have crocodiles and turtle pictures or something in it. How very 2006 of me. 

Sometimes I think I would have liked living back in the olden days. Not because I could handle that way of life, but imagine working in an apothecary training up alongside some master of their craft for years just watching and assisting and then one day taking over. I like thinking about that. Except I like electricity, modern plumbing, women‚Äôs rights and vaccinations too much to genuinely want to ever live back then. I also don‚Äôt like mud, it always seems so muddy back then. Long dresses trailing through mud‚Ä¶ and no end of day shower or washing machine‚Ä¶ no, I‚Äôm very much a 21st century girl. But I also just find herbs and tinctures and remedies interesting. I guess it‚Äôs my adult version of how I would endlessly make potions as a kid. My parents still remind me how they would come into the kitchen and I‚Äôd have used half a bag of very expensive coffee grounds mixed in with idk tomato sauce and vinegar and milk or something. I just remember being curious about what would happen if I mix these. Like when I thought I could make human bones one camping trip with milk and straw? Idk why I thought that, I heard or read something that made me think it could make a bone. So I used up all the milk and poured it into a bucket with straw from wherever we were staying and stirred it and no one could have milky coffee or tea for breakfast. It didn‚Äôt make a bone, it made exactly what you‚Äôd think it would make. Or the time I microwaved a tomato to see what would happen, to this day that smell is one of the worst things I‚Äôve ever smelled - it‚Äôs still engrained into my brain/nose. And then of course all the outside potions with flowers and fruit from the trees and water and mud and stuff. Classic kid activities. Anyway I don‚Äôt wish to live way back when, I just think that sort of career would have been interesting. An apprentice. I know tradies are like that, but not THAT‚Ä¶ yknow. I want to be an apprentice in a dusty back room with shelves of herbs and questionable powders that I don‚Äôt question the origin of and a semi crazy old lady teaching me really wacked out genius concoctions. And I can wear an off white sort of long milkmaid type dress with a dark brown or green leather corset and my hair will be half pinned back and I won‚Äôt smell disgusting like I just KNOW they all did back then because I‚Äôll have a secret perfume I concoct for myself‚Ä¶ *anyway.* 

I told mum yesterday how I likely don‚Äôt want kids. She was talking about the cute family behind us while we were out and the little girl in pink gumboots and a dress and so mum went kn a rant about when I was little and went through a phase where I would *always* wear my pink gumboots, a tutu dress and some sort of sparkly tiara headband or something. Or when I went to kindy and there was a pink sequinned tulle dress I would make a beeline for every single day and immediately put on as soon as I arrived and wear for the whole day. Anyway I agreed the little girl yesterday was super sweet and then sort of said yknow I don‚Äôt think I want children right like you may not have any more grandkids and she said that she had an idea that that was the case, so that‚Äôs a relief. I‚Äôm glad she has my brothers kids. I think me having a baby would make her deliriously happy though but I know she ultimately wants *me* to be happy and I don‚Äôt think a child would do that for me. I‚Äôm getting more and more clear on my decision around not wanting a child. I sometimes falter it ultimately if I only *sometimes* want a child then that means I do not want a child. I just want to be a mother sometimes. I think that‚Äôs it, I want to be a mother and I think I have very‚Ä¶ idk, ‚Äúmotherly‚Äù qualities and tendencies but being realistic I don‚Äôt want to deal with a kid day in day out. So I can be a mother to my pupppiessss. Sometimes I think about fostering a kid later on, which I‚Äôm not opposed to, but it seems hard to offer love and support and guidance and all that to this little person then just.. let them go. It feels weird. Same with animal fostering. But equally they need someone to provide those things and maybe that could suit me? Temporary mothering. Idk if I‚Äôm cut out for letting things go, though. Hm. Idk. Anyway at least mum and dad know not to hold their breath for grandkids from me. I wonder where Andy‚Äôs head is at with kids. I‚Äôm not going to ask because like I‚Äôve said a zillion times before, it‚Äôs not the time for that. Though if he 100% wants them, shouldn‚Äôt we know? As there‚Äôs no way we can be together if that‚Äôs the case. I hope his parents don‚Äôt resent me for purposefully not getting knocked up by their son and providing babies galore. I get nervous about that sometimes. More so with his mum than dad. Idk why. I have zero reason to think that way, I just sort of get the impression she‚Äôd want grandchildren and she doesn‚Äôt seem to be getting any from his sister and so what, Andy is their last chance and he ends up with me‚Ä¶ :/ Hm. Idk. I shouldn‚Äôt think about this. 

I haven‚Äôt journaled since earlier and now it‚Äôs late and I have an early morning sooooooo brief recap for remainder of the day: 

* Did a bunch of word finds 
* Did some life adminny chores for my parents
* Took pup for a walk and played with him 
* Made mum and I deeeeelicious green pasta for dinner with lotsss of broccolini, peas, Parmesan, pine nuts, basil and pesto - and pappardelle! My favourite. I love how they come in lil nests. So cute. And then we had a tiramisu birthday ‚Äúcake‚Äù with candles for mum. I didn‚Äôt really have much. I don‚Äôt really like the sponge and how it‚Äôs alcoholly tasting. I like the coffeeness but they‚Äôre never more coffee than alcoholly. But I like the creamy stuff on top so I had a lil bit of that. 
* Then I showered and packed up and now I‚Äôm in bed writing this. 
* Oh and we watched the lost bus movie and it was really good and now I‚Äôm nervous I‚Äôll have bad dreams.

1nzegy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1nzegy0/the_killing_of_a_sacred_deer_finally_explained/,The Killing of a Sacred Deer finally explained through: At the Altar of Family,"I went into Sacred Deer knowing that sh\*t wouldn't make sense. I think this helped me notice exactly what was really uncanny, and what was being repeated in the film, which probably is what Yorgos is trying to get us to think about. If you keep waiting for the next logical thing to happen after a bunch of nonsense, you might miss the most revealing clues in the film.

I think the film is a commentary on a perversion, a 'sociopathy' in the seemingly perfect family's life. The sickness¬†*may*¬†be an allegory for the effect of the father's hidden guilt on his family.¬†**But the movie gets most interesting when you realize that**¬†**Steven's right hand man, the anesthesiologist, is an extension of his family, or even a stand-in for his wife, and that Martin is a stand-in for his son.**

First, let's talk about Martin. I actually think that who Martin is and what he does isn't as central to this film as the online discussion thinks. What's uncanny about Martin at first? It's the fact that we are introduced to him first, meeting with Steven one-on-one before we are even introduced to Steven's wife and children. Why is Steve giving him so much attention and patience, before we even know his relation?

Steven's treatment of Martin, even if he's just being polite, is a clear foil to how he treats his son Bob. He compliments Martin on his haircut, while he teases Bob for not getting one. The comparison between Bob and Martin doesn't stop there. Both Martin and Bob upset Steve more than Kim does. Martin shows up to the hospital under the pretense of having heart ache, and menacingly deadpans that he started smoking because his father who died during surgery under Steven, was otherwise healthy. Contrast this to Steven being distrustful and forceful when Bob becomes paralyzed for no apparent reason, accusing him of faking it.

There is clearly some father-son relationship implied between Steven and Martin. Martin takes this further and fantasizes about Steven marrying his mom. He asks to see Steven's body hair, like Bob did. Kim is the family member who is most fond of Martin, just like how Steven is most fond of Kim. There is an oedipal undercurrent to all this. Steven tells Bob about having jacked his own father off. XD

There surgeon and the anesthesiologist are partners in surgery just like how Steve and Anne were partners in life. Look at the similarities. The speak to each other in a highly rigid and wooden way, one after the other so that nothing is misunderstood. This might not be unusual for the surgeons, but it is for a husband and wife. They hide any emotions and outwardly act as if everything is under control.

A huge supporting clue? When preparing to butcher the fish for the grill, Matthew and his wife refer to each other as Doctor and Nurse, AS SHE HANDS HIM A DIFFERENT KNIFE. This cannot be any more deliberate. At the surgeon's banquet, Steven just casually mentions that Kim has started her menstruating, and Matthew just nods kindly without as much of a pause. Then the biggest clue: Anna pretends to be a patient under anesthesia for her husband during sex.

Anna confronts Matthew, Steven's anesthesiologist, about Martin's dad's surgery. Matthew admits that he was the only one who knew that Steve was drunk on the day, yet he kept quiet. How is this possible? I'll ignore the how and answer the why: Matthew is a metaphor for Anna. She noticed that her husband wasn't a sober before going into surgery, yet she was in denial. In this scene she is merely mentally going back to that day and confronting/confirming her suspicions - that he indeed was drunk. Because the coffee with Matthew scene occurs AFTER Steven told her that he had been drinking.

Steve tells Anne that a mistake can only ever be the anesthesiologist's fault, while Matthew says that it's always the surgeons' fault. Remember the banquet scene? Matthew was trying to get Steve to stay longer, while Anne (reflecting the conscience and better judgement of a wife prevailing over the side that would indulge her husband), prevented her husband from partying late with Matthew because they had a surgery 6 hours later. In her mind, the wife feels like she has done her job to look after her husband. But what if he's only playing along and actually downing drinks behind her back? What if the children are actually being rebellious and smoking and skipping school? Lying to their parents' face?

There is something sociopathic about Martin speaks; he always gives a reason for being late or needing to go, to seem like he's a good/normal kid. But we later see that he isn't the only one who talks like this - the Murphy children also always try to please their parents, even if it means lying. Kim lies about wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle with Martin. Steve lied to Anna about Martin's Dad's death.

What is Yorgos commenting on using black comedy? On how people are compelled to pretending that they are an angel and that everything is A-OKAY to the people they care deeply about. Even to the point of not telling them about their fatal sickness. Steven says twice that things will be better with some fresh air.¬†**Each family member derives pleasure from pleasing their loved ones.

We started our search in ‚ÄòCramlington‚Äô as the estate agent said it had ‚Äògood transport links‚Äô (whatever that means), but we had to cut the viewing short because the gentleman showing us around was almost completely unintelligible. We smiled and nodded, of course, but it was simply ghastly. He kept mentioning pets which was alarming as we didn‚Äôt even tell him about our little Bartley.  I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was trying to sell us the house or hex us.

We stopped for a coffee in ‚ÄòBlyth‚Äô afterwards and, goodness, what an experience! The coffee shop was charming in its own local way. They had oat milk, thank heavens, but I couldn‚Äôt help noticing everyone seemed to be glaring at us for some reason. Edward suggested perhaps they thought we were estate agents.

We felt much more at home once we reached Bamburgh! Everyone there spoke so beautifully - it really reminded us of home and seemed so authentic - and the little deli even had focaccia! I told Edward that this must be the ‚Äútrue‚Äù Northumberland we‚Äôve heard about. The sea air was absolutely divine, though we did overhear some very coarse language from a group of, what I assume were, day trippers, which was rather jarring. Is this what the locals have to put up with often, as that may sway our decision?!

We‚Äôre now thinking of finding something ‚Äúrural but civilised‚Äù, ideally near a nice village that‚Äôs not too‚Ä¶ ‚Äúindustrial heritage,‚Äù if you know what I mean.

1nzedyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1nzedyc/should_you_trust_the_bissell_oxy_stain_remover/,Should You Trust the Bissell Oxy Stain Remover for Pet Messes,"Testing out the Bissell 1784L has genuinely been a game-changer for maintaining my home‚Äôs cleanliness. Owning pets means dealing with a whole array of messes, and products claiming to obliterate tough stains often fall short. With this Bissell stain remover, I was initially hesitant, but after using it for weeks, I realized it holds up to its promises remarkably well. Specially designed for those inevitable pet stains like tracked-in mud, vomit, and grass, the formula actually gets the job done in just 30 seconds. Yes, 30 seconds‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt believe it until I tried it repeatedly!

**Design and Ease of Use**  
The bottle is neither bulky nor awkward, which is always a plus for me. Its no-fuss spraying mechanism delivers a consistent, controlled spray pattern, so I never ended up drenched in product or creating an oversaturated spot. The recyclable packaging was a nice touch too; it feels good knowing companies are caring about sustainability. Plus, with its compact size, it easily fits in my storage cupboard without being an annoyance. Convenience at its best!

**Performance in Tackling Pet Messes**  
While my golden retriever is lovable, his muddy paw prints on the carpet are‚Ä¶ less lovable. I tested this stain remover on those stains, and it worked better than expected‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt just surface-level clean but really dealt with the embedded dirt. Even tougher spots like those delightful surprises from cats (vomit and urine, anyone?) disappeared with this. Following the directions was simple: a quick spray and a blot with paper towels, and voil√†! The included oxidative formula does seem like magic in a bottle.

[Check Bissell 1784L price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b0829lb184/)

**Odor Neutralization**  
What I didn‚Äôt anticipate was how well it worked to neutralize odors. A lot of stain removers mask smells temporarily, but this eliminated that stale, pet-related funk. After having guests over, I also noticed they complimented a fresh scent in my living room‚Äîwithout me prompting them! It doesn‚Äôt just deodorize; it ensures your home doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúpets live here.‚Äù

**Highlighted Features**  
- The oxy-stain destroyer formula penetrates stains deeply and works almost instantly.  
- Very effective at removing pet-related stains, such as urine, mud, blood, and feces.  
- Comes with a pleasant, clean scent that lingers after use.  
- Controlled spraying pattern minimizes product waste and mess.  
- Sustainable packaging aligns with green initiatives.  

**Limitations**  
Some features aren‚Äôt perfect, no matter how good the product is. One drawback I experienced was the difficulty in using it on larger stains. If there‚Äôs a sizable area affected, you might need to go through more product than anticipated. Additionally, I found that for certain materials like silk or delicates, the formula left a subtle outline, requiring extra care during application.

- Tends to run out quickly if dealing with large or multiple messes.  
- On rare occasions, residue was left behind on delicate fabrics.  
- Doesn‚Äôt necessarily work miracles on older, set-in stains‚Äîit‚Äôs better for fresh messes.  

**Competing Brands**  
Trying similar stain removers from big brands like Resolve and OxiClean has given me a decent reference point. While those also fight tough stains effectively, what sets the Bissell stain remover apart is the immediate action and reliability on pet-related issues. For example, Resolve works well, but it often took longer to notice results. OxiClean, on the other hand, felt overly harsh on certain surfaces, whereas this one balanced strength with safety. For homes with pets, the Bissell product stands out thanks to its odor-fighting capabilities.

**Worth Every Penny**  
While the price sits comfortably within the realm of similar stain removers, what makes this worth the investment is how quickly it performs and the multiple uses it offers. Whether it‚Äôs a fresh stain from spilled coffee or an unfortunate accident involving my dog, this product saves time and effort. It‚Äôs not just about removing stains but also about ensuring they don‚Äôt return, which has saved on reapplication costs in the long term.

Coffee cold, the days all blend, You start to wonder if hearts can mend.

The world keeps spinning, mean and fast, While I‚Äôm still haunted by my past.

But then one night, I caught my breath, And whispered softly, ‚ÄúNot yet, not death.‚Äù

A stranger smiled, that small, kind spark, It Lit a candle inside my dark.

The rain still fell, but it felt like grace, Each drop a kiss upon my humble face.

1nzebh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/1nzebh8/possibly_deleted_sonadow_fanfics_please_helppp/,"(Possibly deleted?) Sonadow Fanfics - Please helppp (Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic 3)","Ok, I can't remember the authors name but I do remember the 2 fics (One was a series of multiple fanfics posted on AO3 and the other was on their tumblr - again, by the same author) I know for sure the series was most likely posted in the time frame of Dec. 2024 to January 2025. The oneshot may have also been around there since it had been a newer post.

The first one was a based after the events of Sonic 3 (so live action movie verse). Some of the specific scenes I remember are Shadow misinterpreting Sonic for showing ""signs of mating"" for hedgehogs that happened over the course of them meeting up for races more and more often (Sonic had spotted Shadow hiding around the town & when taking Ozzy to the backyard at night, finally was face to face again & convinced him to race the next day - Sonic thought Shads was dead).

It then lead to Sonic bringing Shadow over to meet his family (the Wachowski's) & Shadow tried his best to impress Sonic & his family. Shadow was given a tour by Sonic where he met his parents, Tails (in the basement - his workshop), & then Knuckles (in a shed outside - his renovated room). At one point in another installment I believe they were in a bowling alley & Sonic had been jealous of Rouge (thinking Shadow liked her or something - Shadow gave Sonic his leather jacket a while before but neither of them had made anything official despite wanting to). Shadow & Sonic ended up talking on the roof of the place & cleared up the miscommunication (oh and knuckles was there too at the bowling alley).

Later in the fic, Shadow had been working with G.U.N. while a mobians program was introduced to help house new mobians and all that (Rouge, Cream, Vanilla, & Amy where included) Then Shadow got a letter inviting him to a christmas party of sorts but he wanted to bring Sonic since it was Maria's family & he was intimidated. I remember there being a whole part of them two trying to convince Tom & Maddie to let them two go together. I think they ended up running into a girl there that looked exactly like Maria (but it wasn't) and Shadow got upset about it.

\~\~

Second fic was more of a one shot that was posted on their tumblr - It was based on the song ""Die With a Smile"" by Bruno Mars & Lady Gaga (NOT movie verse btw!!). Amy was hosting her yearly hangout of sorts where there was a large set up for karaoke. Shadow showed up (due to losing a bet) but stayed to himself. There was a point where Shadow was alone by a fire pit & Sonic had made his way over to him, he tried asking Shadow to open up to no avail & Sonic reveals his struggles with certain pasts events (after the Ark fight possibly?). Sonic may have had a guitar and was singing but the main thing is that towards the end, Sonic get up to sing Die With a Smile hopping Shadow will join him. He gets through Bruno's part and then Shadow joins in at Lady Gaga's part - then they kiss at the climax of the song (Slowed part: ""Right next to you, next to you, right next to you, oh-oh oh!"") It was practically the whole Sonic cast who was there, they would go up in pairs or groups to sing song's (Vector may have been dj-ing but I'm not sure lol). There was a mention of Cream guiding shadow around, Shadow finding a coffee bar setup, & hand-made mittens & scarfs (made by Amy) since it was colder weather.

1nzeaby,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1nzeaby/the_killing_of_a_sacred_deer_finally_explained/,The Killing of A Sacred Deer finally explained - IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY,"I went into Sacred Deer knowing that sh\*t wouldn't make sense. I think this helped me notice exactly what was really uncanny, and what was being repeated in the film, which probably is what Yorgos is trying to get us to think about. If you keep waiting for the next logical thing to happen after a bunch of nonsense, you might miss the most revealing clues in the film.

I think the film is a commentary on a perversion, a 'sociopathy' in the seemingly perfect family's life. The sickness¬†*may*¬†be an allegory for the effect of the father's hidden guilt on his family.¬†**But the movie gets most interesting when you realize that**¬†>!**Steven's right hand man, the anesthesiologist, is an extension of his family, or even a stand-in for his wife, and that Martin is a stand-in for his son.**!<

>!First, let's talk about Martin. I actually think that who Martin is and what he does isn't as central to this film as the online discussion thinks. What's uncanny about Martin at first? It's the fact that we are introduced to him first, meeting with Steven one-on-one before we are even introduced to Steven's wife and children. Why is Steve giving him so much attention and patience, before we even know his relation?!<

>!Steven's treatment of Martin, even if he's just being polite, is a clear foil to how he treats his son Bob. He compliments Martin on his haircut, while he teases Bob for not getting one. The comparison between Bob and Martin doesn't stop there. Both Martin and Bob upset Steve more than Kim does. Martin shows up to the hospital under the pretense of having heart ache, and menacingly deadpans that he started smoking because his father who died during surgery under Steven, was otherwise healthy. Contrast this to Steven being distrustful and forceful when Bob becomes paralyzed for no apparent reason, accusing him of faking it.!<

>!There is clearly some father-son relationship implied between Steven and Martin. Martin takes this further and fantasizes about Steven marrying his mom. He asks to see Steven's body hair, like Bob did. Kim is the family member who is most fond of Martin, just like how Steven is most fond of Kim. There is an oedipal undercurrent to all this. Steven tells Bob about having jacked his own father off. XD!<

>!There surgeon and the anesthesiologist are partners in surgery just like how Steve and Anne were partners in life. Look at the similarities. The speak to each other in a highly rigid and wooden way, one after the other so that nothing is misunderstood. This might not be unusual for the surgeons, but it is for a husband and wife. They hide any emotions and outwardly act as if everything is under control.!<

>!A huge supporting clue? When preparing to butcher the fish for the grill, Matthew and his wife refer to each other as Doctor and Nurse, AS SHE HANDS HIM A DIFFERENT KNIFE. This cannot be any more deliberate. At the surgeon's banquet, Steven just casually mentions that Kim has started her menstruating, and Matthew just nods kindly without as much of a pause. Then the biggest clue: Anna pretends to be a patient under anesthesia for her husband during sex.!<

>!Anna confronts Matthew, Steven's anesthesiologist, about Martin's dad's surgery. Matthew admits that he was the only one who knew that Steve was drunk on the day, yet he kept quiet. How is this possible? I'll ignore the how and answer the why: Matthew is a metaphor for Anna. She noticed that her husband wasn't a sober before going into surgery, yet she was in denial. In this scene she is merely mentally going back to that day and confronting/confirming her suspicions - that he indeed was drunk. Because the coffee with Matthew scene occurs AFTER Steven told her that he had been drinking.!<

>!Steve tells Anne that a mistake can only ever be the anesthesiologist's fault, while Matthew says that it's always the surgeons' fault. Remember the banquet scene? Matthew was trying to get Steve to stay longer, while Anne (reflecting the conscience and better judgement of a wife prevailing over the side that would indulge her husband), prevented her husband from partying late with Matthew because they had a surgery 6 hours later. In her mind, the wife feels like she has done her job to look after her husband. But what if he's only playing along and actually downing drinks behind her back? What if the children are actually being rebellious and smoking and skipping school? Lying to their parents' face?!<

>!There is something sociopathic about Martin speaks; he always gives a reason for being late or needing to go, to seem like he's a good/normal kid. But we later see that he isn't the only one who talks like this - the Murphy children also always try to please their parents, even if it means lying. Kim lies about wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle with Martin. Steve lied to Anna about Martin's Dad's death.!<

>!What is Yorgos commenting on using black comedy? On how people are compelled to pretending that they are an angel and that everything is A-OKAY to the people they care deeply about. Even to the point of not telling them about their fatal sickness. Steven says twice that things will be better with some fresh air.¬†**Each family member derives pleasure from pleasing their loved ones.

1nze9sw,https://i.redd.it/hf3s4h3elgtf1.jpeg,Do Cracked Teeth Heal Naturally? The Truth Most People Don‚Äôt Know,"You bite into something hard ‚Äî maybe a popcorn kernel or a piece of ice ‚Äî and suddenly, you feel that sharp jolt of pain shoot up your jaw. Later, you notice a fine line on your tooth in the mirror and panic. The first thought? ‚ÄúWill it heal on its own?‚Äù

Let‚Äôs break the myth right away ‚Äî **cracked teeth do not heal naturally.** Unlike bones or skin, a tooth doesn‚Äôt regenerate once it‚Äôs damaged. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be saved. With the right diagnosis and early dental intervention, your tooth can be restored completely ‚Äî and pain-free.

# Why Cracked Teeth Don‚Äôt Heal Naturally

To understand why your cracked tooth won‚Äôt fix itself, you need to know what it‚Äôs made of.  
A tooth has three layers:

* **Enamel** (the hard, outer shell)
* **Dentin** (the sensitive middle layer)
* **Pulp** (the soft center filled with nerves and blood vessels)

The **enamel layer has no living cells**, which means there‚Äôs no biological way for it to repair itself. So when a crack forms, it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgrow back‚Äù ‚Äî instead, it keeps spreading with chewing pressure, temperature changes, or even grinding your teeth at night.

That‚Äôs why many people suddenly feel their tooth ‚Äúbreak‚Äù one day ‚Äî but in reality, the damage started weeks or months ago.

# Common Causes of Cracked Teeth

Cracks don‚Äôt happen overnight. They usually result from habits or dental issues that build up over time. Some of the most common reasons include:

* **Chewing on hard foods** like nuts, candies, or ice.
* **Teeth grinding (bruxism)** ‚Äî especially during sleep.
* **Sudden temperature changes**, like drinking ice water after hot coffee.
* **Old fillings or restorations** that weaken tooth structure.
* **Injury or trauma**, such as a fall or blow to the jaw.
* **Age-related wear and tear**, particularly in people above 40.

If any of these sound familiar, a quick check-up at your nearest dental clinic might save you from a painful (and expensive) surprise later.

# Symptoms You Should Never Ignore

A small crack can go unnoticed until it becomes severe. Here are signs your tooth may be cracked:

* Sharp pain when chewing or biting down.
* Sensitivity to hot or cold foods.
* Pain that comes and goes without a clear reason.
* Swelling or gum irritation around the tooth.
* A visible line or rough edge on the surface.

Even if the pain disappears after a few days, don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs healed. That‚Äôs often when the damage worsens beneath the surface.

# What Happens If You Ignore a Cracked Tooth

A crack is like an open invitation for bacteria to enter your tooth. Once that happens, infection can spread deep into the pulp ‚Äî the part that contains nerves and blood vessels.  
When that infection travels down to the root, it can cause:

* **Severe toothache and swelling**
* **Gum abscess (pus formation)**
* **Bone loss around the tooth**
* **Complete tooth loss**

The longer you wait, the harder (and costlier) it becomes to fix. In many cases, a tooth that could have been easily restored ends up needing a root canal or even extraction.

# How a Dentist Near You Can Save a Cracked Tooth

At [**K-Dental in Kothrud, Pune**](https://kdentalclinics.com/), **Dr. Gaurav Ketkar** and his team use advanced diagnostic tools like high-resolution imaging and digital X-rays to detect even hairline cracks that are invisible to the naked eye.

Here‚Äôs how cracked teeth are typically treated depending on severity:

1. **Minor cracks (Craze lines):** These are superficial and can be polished or treated cosmetically to improve appearance.
2. **Moderate cracks (Cracked tooth or fractured cusp):** A **dental crown** is placed to protect the tooth and restore full strength.
3. **Deep cracks (involving pulp):** A **root canal treatment** may be needed to remove infection before capping the tooth with a crown.
4. **Severe splits or root fractures:** In these cases, extraction may be necessary ‚Äî but the tooth can be replaced with a **dental implant**, which looks and functions just like your natural tooth.

Each treatment aims to save your natural tooth whenever possible, and when that‚Äôs not feasible, restore full function and aesthetics with long-lasting solutions.

# Preventing Future Cracks

Once you‚Äôve had a cracked tooth, you‚Äôll want to avoid a repeat experience.  
Here are a few dentist-approved preventive steps:

* Avoid biting into hard foods like bones or unpopped popcorn.
* Don‚Äôt use your teeth as tools (to open bottles or tear packets).
* Wear a **nightguard** if you grind your teeth while sleeping.
* Get regular dental check-ups every six months to detect early issues.
* Maintain strong enamel by brushing with fluoride toothpaste and flossing daily.

Small habits can go a long way in keeping your teeth strong and crack-free.

# The [K-Dental](https://kdentalclinics.com/) Approach

What makes **K-Dental** one of the most trusted **dentist clinics in Pune** is the clinic‚Äôs focus on precision, comfort, and conservative care.  
Dr. Ketkar believes in saving your natural teeth whenever possible. Using digital imaging, painless anesthesia systems, and high-quality materials, every treatment is designed to last ‚Äî while keeping patient comfort at the forefront.

If you‚Äôre searching for a **dentist near me** in **Kothrud or Pune**, K-Dental offers both preventive and restorative treatments under one roof ‚Äî from cosmetic fillings to dental implants.

# Final Takeaway

Cracked teeth don‚Äôt heal on their own ‚Äî but with modern dentistry, they can be repaired and protected before things get worse.  
If you‚Äôve noticed even the smallest crack or unusual pain while chewing, don‚Äôt ignore it. Early treatment can mean the difference between a simple filling and a full extraction.

Visit [**K-Dental Clinic, Kothrud**](https://kdentalclinics.com/) and consult **Dr. Gaurav Ketkar**, one of Pune‚Äôs trusted experts in restorative and cosmetic dentistry.

1nze99i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conqueco/comments/1nze99i/faq_of_conqueco_coffee_products/,FAQ of Conqueco coffee products,"How many coffees can I make for a fully charged?  
8-10 cups for Nespresso and about 5 times for ground coffee

How long does it take to make a coffee?  
For Nespresso it usually takes 2.5 to 3.5 mins, and 5 mins for ground coffee. Brewing time really depends on the water and surrounding temperature. The higher temperature, the more battery capacitive of the machine, the less time spend.

What are the functions of the upper and lower key buttons?  
Short press for the upper or lower button can display the capacitive of the battery. Long press the upper button for brewing coffee with cold water. Long press the lower button for brewing coffee with hot water, and the coffee will come out instantly.

How many brews can I get if I use hot water?  
Boiling water take most of the battery out of the machine, and if you use hot water for instant brewing, it will make more than 100 brews before you have to charge it.

Which Nespresso capsules can I use?  
The machine fits most of the Nespresso capsules on the market, like Nestle„ÄÅLor„ÄÅStarbucks„ÄÅLavazza„ÄÅilly„ÄÅBorbone„ÄÅCarte Noire etc. Please note that all plastic capsules will not fit the machine.

How much water do I need to finish brewing?  
It takes 40ML for Nespresso capsules (please read the capsules instruction for details and it variously for different capsules). For ground coffee, it will take up to 80ML. Please mind that do not add up water excel the MAX lever.

How many grams do I need to do a brew?  
Generally, you will need 13 grams for one brew ground coffee.

It messes up when I fill the gourd coffee to the chamber.  
You can use our accessory powder ring to fill the coffee. The package includes powder hammer also. Please note that the water tank cup can also be fitted to press the coffee powder.

It‚Äôs not convinced to hold the machine all the time when brewing coffee.  
Take out the water cup and rotate some angle and insert to the chamber again, the cup will support for the machine, leave enough space for the brewing coffee. Please try serval more times.

How to clean and maintain the coffee machine?  
Use clean water to clean the chamber. You should use it and charge it for every 3 months at lease.

How to clean ground chamber completely?  
Put the ground chamber in the hot water, then use mental stick punch the stainless steel holder on the backside.

The chamber is leakingÔºåand the ""coffee"" come out just like water.  
It is likely that the capsule did not puncture, causing excessive pressure and water flowing out of the chamber. Tighten the chamber and try with a different capsule.All plastic capsules are difficult to pierce and are not recommended.

The water tank lid is too hot.  
When add water into the water tank, make sure not to excel the Max mark.

The coffee machine indicator light keeps flashing irregularly.  
Wait for a while and try again. If the problem recurs, please contact us.

Can't charge the coffee machine.  
Try replacing the charging head or cable. If the problem recurs, please contact us.

There is still a lot of water left in the water tank, and the coffee is not liquid enough.  
When the water is discharged, the machine detects that there is no water and stops the water discharge, but there is a total time control. When the pressure is not enough, it is suspended, it is intermittent, and finally it exceeds the total length of downtime. Customers can try with different capsules. It is also estimated that the capsule does not puncture and causes excessive pressure. There is also a relationship between the tightness of the capsule head, which cannot be too loose, and the cutting board is not worn if it is too loose.

What type of charger do you recommend?  
Coffee machine charging adapts to most chargers on the market. It is recommended to use a charger with a power of 15W or above, and the charging time will be the fastest. Other mobile phone or computer chargers over 15 watts can also be adapted.

What can I do if the chamber falls into the cup?  
If the chamber is accidentally embedded in the cup, you can take a sharp metal, nail clippers, flathead screwdriver, etc., and pry the buckle of the chamber on the edge of the cup. Note that the four buckles are slowly prying. Then hold the cup and knock it out, or put the chamber into the coffee machine, lock it tightly, and pull the cup down.

Can I use a substitute reusable capsule?  
The taste of reusable capsules is generally difficult to control, and it is generally not recommended to use them, so it is recommended to choose our company's powder camber.  
If you must use it, choose a capsule that can be sealed with aluminum foil, which will make the pressure high enough for extraction.

Rusty coffee tank?  
The heating of the coffee tank is stainless steel, and what remains on it is limescale instead of rust. You can soak it in citric acid or coke for a day to remove limescale. Note that the water after steeping needs poured directly and not for coffee brewing.

Can't make coffee at high altitude?  
As the altitude increases, the boiling point of water decreases. For example, the boiling point at 2,300 meters is 92 degrees, and the boiling point at 3,000 meters is 89 degrees. The coffee machine detects that the temperature at which the coffee is brewed after boiling is around 92-94 degrees, and if the local boiling point is below 92 degrees, the coffee machine keeps boiling water to try to reach the target, but in fact it can't. It is recommended to boil the water for a certain period of time(let say fo 5 mins) and press the cold brew function to directly produce the coffee, of course, the temperature of the coffee will drop slightly at this time.

Can I add filter paper to the powder camber to extract coffee?  
Sure. With an extra layer of filter paper, although the extraction pressure has increased,the coffee machine has enough pressure to complete the extraction smoothly. It should be noted that the taste may change, and it is recommended to adjust the fineness of the ground coffee beans appropriately.

Why is it recommended to clean the capsule camber after each capsule is brewed?  
Please clean the capsule camber in time after each use. When using the capsule continuously to brew coffee, a small amount of coffee powder will remain in the capsule camber, which is normal, but please clean it up in time. Otherwise, if the excess coffee powder is put on the piercing cutting board, the chance of the new capsule being completely pierced will be reduced, and finally the coffee will not come out smoothly, or even can not be produced.

Can you take a coffee machine on a plane?  
The battery of the coffee machine is 49.95Wh, which is far less than the 100Wh or 200Wh stipulated by general airlines, and it can be taken on the plane.

Can I use the coffee machine on the plane?  
The air pressure in the cabin of the aircraft is equivalent to the atmospheric pressure at an altitude of 2400 meters above sea level, and the boiling point of water at this time is about 92 degrees Celsius, which is at the temperature of the automatic coffee extraction of coffee in the coffee machine, but due to too much uncertainty, it is recommended to add hot water and press the cold brew button below to brew the coffee.

What is the extraction pressure of coffee?  
In fact, a standard desktop home capsule machine only needs a pressure of 19 bar for normal extraction, and a semi-automatic espresso machine has a standard extraction pressure of 9 bar. The maximum pressure of the pump of the portable coffee machine can reach 25 bar, so there is no need to worry about running out of pressure.

Does the machine have pre-infusion faction?  
The portable coffee machine has a pre-infusion function. In the first 3 seconds of brewing coffee, there is no pressure to pour water into the coffee grounds, which is equivalent to the pre-infusion function of an espresso machine.

Is there a gap left after the Nespresso camber is tightened, is it normal?  
When the upper and lower covers of the capsule camber are tightened, there will be a gap of 3-4mm, which is a normal.

Coffee machine extraction doesn't stop automatically?  
In order to accommodate both extraction in the powder and capsule chambers, the pump is set to a 1.5 minute turn on time. Customers can press any button to stop extraction early. If the pump still starts after more than 1.5 minutes, please contact the customer to replace the machine.

Does the coffee machine damage when it heats up without water in the tank?  
The product is set to prevent dry boiling, when the customer does not add water to the tank and starts the heating, the machine will automatically stop the heating and sound the alarm after detecting it.

Why can't a coffee maker be used while charging?  
To protect the battery, the coffee maker cannot be used while charging. Moreover, in the case of insufficient circuitry, the power of the charger alone cannot drive all the functions of the coffee machine.

1nze767,https://www.reddit.com/r/findfanfiction/comments/1nze767/possibly_deleted_sonadow_fanfics/,(Possibly deleted???) Sonadow Fanfic's,"Ok, I can't remember the authors name but I do remember the 2 fics (One was a series of multiple fanfics posted on AO3 and the other was on their tumblr - again, by the same author) I know for sure the series was most likely posted in the time frame of Dec. 2024 to January 2025. The oneshot may have also been around there since it had been a newer post.

The first one was a based after the events of Sonic 3 (so live action movie verse). Some of the specific scenes I remember are Shadow misinterpreting Sonic for showing ""signs of mating"" for hedgehogs that happened over the course of them meeting up for races more and more often (Sonic had spotted Shadow hiding around the town & when taking Ozzy to the backyard at night, finally was face to face again & convinced him to race the next day - Sonic thought Shads was dead). 

It then lead to Sonic bringing Shadow over to meet his family (the Wachowski's) & Shadow tried his best to impress Sonic & his family. Shadow was given a tour by Sonic where he met his parents, Tails (in the basement - his workshop), & then Knuckles (in a shed outside - his renovated room). At one point in another installment I believe they were in a bowling alley & Sonic had been jealous of Rouge (thinking Shadow liked her or something - Shadow gave Sonic his leather jacket a while before but neither of them had made anything official despite wanting to). Shadow & Sonic ended up talking on the roof of the place & cleared up the miscommunication (oh and knuckles was there too at the bowling alley).

Later in the fic, Shadow had been working with G.U.N. while a mobians program was introduced to help house new mobians and all that (Rouge, Cream, Vanilla, & Amy where included) Then Shadow got a letter inviting him to a christmas party of sorts but he wanted to bring Sonic since it was Maria's family & he was intimidated. I remember there being a whole part of them two trying to convince Tom & Maddie to let them two go together. I think they ended up running into a girl there that looked exactly like Maria (but it wasn't) and Shadow got upset about it.

\~\~

Second fic was more of a one shot that was posted on their tumblr - It was based on the song ""Die With a Smile"" by Bruno Mars & Lady Gaga (NOT movie verse btw!!). Amy was hosting her yearly hangout of sorts where there was a large set up for karaoke. Shadow showed up (due to losing a bet) but stayed to himself. There was a point where Shadow was alone by a fire pit & Sonic had made his way over to him, he tried asking Shadow to open up to no avail & Sonic reveals his struggles with certain pasts events (after the Ark fight possibly?). Sonic may have had a guitar and was singing but the main thing is that towards the end, Sonic get up to sing Die With a Smile hopping Shadow will join him. He gets through Bruno's part and then Shadow joins in at Lady Gaga's part - then they kiss at the climax of the song (Slowed part: ""Right next to you, next to you, right next to you, oh-oh oh!"") It was practically the whole Sonic cast who was there, they would go up in pairs or groups to sing song's (Vector may have been dj-ing but im not sure lol). There was a mention of Cream guiding shadow around, Shadow finding a coffee bar setup, & hand-made mittens & scarfs (made by Amy) since it was colder weather.

Pls someone help me find these, they were my absolute favorite fics </3",1,1759742138.0,findfanfiction,0,0.99,False

For example, I used to barely floss and thought it was overkill‚Äîbut now I do it daily, and my gums have never felt better. Same with changing my pillowcases more often or rinsing my mouth after coffee.

So I‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat‚Äôs one hygiene habit you used to think was unnecessary or a bit extra, but now you absolutely swear by? Why did it make such a difference for you?

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents I really don‚Äôt mind where you are located don‚Äôt let the distance put you off 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it‚Äôs not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don‚Äôt just say hi or hello I‚Äôm unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

I have a long layover 12+ hours and I want to ask if its possible to leave the airport for that time. I read that there are luggage lockers where I can leave my luggage but it didnt state their prices nor the duration. What is the surroundings like? Could I leave for sometime for a walk, get coffee at an inexpensive place (prices inside are too high), maybe get some food at a fastfood place? How close are these things to the airport, are they in walking distance? Is there a danger to get mugged or for someone to try to scam me if I have a walk? I just dont want to be locked in for half a day with only an hour of wifi connection.

1nzdwaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/A24/comments/1nzdwaz/explaining_the_killing_of_a_sacred_deer_its_all/,Explaining The Killing of A Sacred Deer - IT'S ALL ABOUT FAMILY,"I went into Sacred Deer knowing that sh\*t wouldn't make sense. I think this helped me notice exactly what was really uncanny, and what was being repeated in the film, which probably is what Yorgos is trying to get us to think about. If you are just waiting the next logical thing to happen after a bunch of nonsense, you might miss the most revealing clues in the film.

I think the film is a commentary on a perversion, a 'sociopathy' in the seemingly perfect family's life. The sickness *may* be an allegory for the effect of the father's hidden guilt on his family. **But the movie gets most interesting when you realize that** >!**Steven's right hand man, the anesthesiologist, is an extension of his family, or even a stand-in for his wife, and that Martin is a stand-in for his son.**!<

>!First, let's talk about Martin. I actually think that who Martin is and what he does isn't as central to this film as the online discussion thinks. What's uncanny about Martin at first? It's the fact that we are introduced to him first, meeting with Steven one-on-one before we are even introduced to Steven's wife and children. Why is Steve giving him so much attention and patience, before we even know his relation?!<

>!Steven's treatment of Martin, even if he's just being polite, is a clear foil to how he treats his son Bob. He compliments Martin on his haircut, while he teases Bob for not getting one. The comparison between Bob and Martin doesn't stop there. Both Martin and Bob upset Steve more than Kim does. Martin shows up to the hospital under the pretense of having heart ache, and menacingly deadpans that he started smoking because his father who died during surgery under Steven, was otherwise healthy. Contrast this to Steven being distrustful and forceful when Bob becomes paralyzed for no apparent reason, accusing him of faking it.!<

>!There is clearly some father-son relationship implied between Steven and Martin. Martin takes this further and fantasizes about Steven marrying his mom. He asks to see Steven's body hair, like Bob did. Kim is the family member who is most fond of Martin, just like how Steven is most fond of Kim. There is an oedipal undercurrent to all this. Steven tells Bob about having jacked his own father off. XD!<

>!There surgeon and the anesthesiologist are partners in surgery just like how Steve and Anne were partners in life. Look at the similarities. The speak to each other in a highly rigid and wooden way, one after the other so that nothing is misunderstood. This might not be unusual for the surgeons, but it is for a husband and wife. They hide any emotions and outwardly act as if everything is under control.!<

>!A huge supporting clue? When preparing to butcher the fish for the grill, Matthew and his wife refer to each other as Doctor  and Nurse, AS SHE HANDS HIM A DIFFERENT KNIFE. This cannot be any more deliberate. At the surgeon's banquet, Steven just casually mentions that Kim has started her menstruating, and Matthew just nods kindly without as much of a pause. Then the biggest clue: Anna pretends to be a patient under anesthesia for her husband during sex.!<

>!Anna confronts Matthew, Steven's anesthesiologist, about Martin's dad's surgery. Matthew admits that he was the only one who knew that Steve was drunk on the day, yet he kept quiet. How is this possible? I'll ignore the how and answer the why: Matthew is a metaphor for Anna. She noticed that her husband wasn't a sober before going into surgery, yet she was in denial. In this scene she is merely mentally going back to that day and confronting/confirming her suspicions - that he indeed was drunk. Because the coffee with Matthew scene occurs AFTER Steven told her that he had been drinking.!<

>!Steve tells Anne that a mistake can only ever be the anesthesiologist's fault, while Matthew says that it's always the surgeons' fault. Remember the banquet scene? Matthew was trying to get Steve to stay longer, while Anne (reflecting the conscience and better judgement of a wife prevailing over the side that would indulge her husband), prevented her husband from partying late with Matthew because they had a surgery 6 hours later. In her mind, the wife feels like she has done her job to look after her husband. But what if he's only playing along and actually downing drinks behind her back? What if the children are actually being rebellious and smoking and skipping school? Lying to their parents' face?!<

>!There is something sociopathic about Martin speaks; he always gives a reason for being late or needing to go, to seem like he's a good/normal kid. But we later see that he isn't the only one who talks like this - the Murphy children also always try to please their parents, even if it means lying. Kim lies about wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle with Martin. Steve lied to Anna about Martin's Dad's death. H!<

>!What is Yorgos commenting on using black comedy? On how people are compelled to pretending that they are an angel and that everything is A-OKAY to the people they care deeply about. Even to the point of not telling them about their fatal sickness. Steven says twice that things will be better with some fresh air. **Each family member derives pleasure from pleasing their loved ones. This movie somehow makes that feel like it's a perverted thing.**!<",5,1759740943.0,A24,0,0.86,False

But here's the truth: it's often the smallest details that make the biggest impact. One of the most underrated style upgrades? **Custom knit socks**. These aren't just cozy foot coverings‚Äîthey're a statement piece that blends personality, comfort, and creativity into one stylish package.

First off, let‚Äôs talk about **style versatility**. Custom knit socks come in endless patterns, colors, and designs, giving you the freedom to showcase your individuality. Whether you lean toward bold stripes, quirky prints, or minimalist aesthetics, there‚Äôs a knit pattern that reflects your vibe. It‚Äôs like wearing a piece of art on your feet‚Äîand it‚Äôs a guaranteed conversation starter.

Another major plus is the **comfort factor**. Knit socks are typically made with high-quality materials like combed cotton or wool blends, offering softness, breathability, and warmth. They hug your feet without feeling restrictive, and many come with extra padding in the heel and toe areas for long-lasting wear. Once you slip into a well-crafted pair, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever lived without them.

Let‚Äôs not overlook **functionality**. Custom knit socks are designed with purpose. You can choose designs tailored for different activities‚Äîlightweight for everyday wear, moisture-wicking for workouts, or insulated for colder days. They also provide just the right amount of support to reduce fatigue, especially if you're on your feet all day.

Then there‚Äôs the **fun factor**. These socks allow you to express your mood, humor, or interests subtly‚Äîor boldly, if that‚Äôs your thing. They work whether you‚Äôre dressing for a formal meeting or a casual coffee run. Pop them under a suit for an unexpected twist or pair them with sneakers for a laid-back yet intentional look.

**Custom socks** are the ultimate blend of fashion and function. They‚Äôre more than just an accessory‚Äîthey‚Äôre a reflection of your personality wrapped around your feet. When your socks are thoughtfully chosen, they say, ‚ÄúI care about the details.‚Äù It‚Äôs a small upgrade with big impact, and once you try it, you‚Äôll never go back to boring basics again.

I saw this girl (26F), she was cute lil chubby (which made her hot), so I right swiped her, knowing this is obviously not going anywhere. After a day, shockingly I see it's a match, and there was a message.

I liked what was happening. I started flirting with her and the response was amazing. I never got such a response from someone my age! At first, i started doubting if its a fake account or so, but later when we moved to insta, things were pretty clear. It wasn't a fake id.

One fine day, she asked if we could meet, and a date was fixed, at the mall. We met and directly went to food court, cuz none of us had our anything since morning. It was afternoon time, i thought maybe we could go for a movie afterwards, so I planned it to be in afternoon only.

Had a burger and a cold coffee, were having fun..laughing over the chat references, in the meantime I asked her if she wanted to go for movie. She agreed to it immediately. Holy smokes...shit is flowing!!


We go for the movie, the hall pretty empty. Movie begins, at first I saw her keeping hand on the arm rest, so I hesitated asking her to move it. After some time has passed.. I (with a smile on my face) pushed her hand away and kept mine on it. Then she is trying to push my hands away, and BOOM somehow, I grabbed her hand tightly, then releases it immediately, saying sorry. She says its fine and wraps fingers around mine, and we are both looking at the screen, no words exchange just rubbing our thumbs against other's hand. I was getting aroused, heartbeat increasing. From now onwards, someone else was controlling me. I took the chance, looked towards her and her lips, leaning a lil towards her, she too approaches and we have a kiss, just enough so that no one else notices and we get the taste. We wanted more! and its intermission. No ones talking, then I (gathering all the courage) complemented her and she responds -- shall we go somewhere, I can't hold this now! 

We left the hall immediately and went to nearest hotel. Ohh God...as soon as we enter the room, we didn't wait even for a second, just totally sucked each others lips. Things were going as if our soul knew what exactly should happen next....she started sucking my D. I was already a lil wet and I didn't jerked since one and half months...She was gaggling and in no time it all came out together...Her mouth was full of it, some spilling side from her lips. 

Then later we had a shower together and had a great sex for 5minutes. She enjoyed it..I too enjoyed it. All my energy was gone, I was just lying on her breathless. 

Then she brings up the real talk...she asks didn't I feel awkward having sex with someone older than me , I said  I've always enjoyed chatting..also this whole day, this is the best Date I've ever been to. She hugged me tightly, we spooned each other for an hour or so and then left.",0,1759739523.0,RelationshipIndia,8,0.44,False

         10 Years Later

In Springwood, Illinois. Lt. Tim Blocker and his partner Sergeant Don Thompson are investigating a series of child murders. Blocker knows it's got to be Fred Krueger doing the murders he always hated Krueger and he lately has been interviewing Loretta, Fred's wife to see what she knows. Loretta's daughter Katherine loves her father dearly. Fred works at the local power plant where he has been secretly taking his victims. Don and his wife Marge oldest child Ethan is the latest victim to be taken by Krueger Don and Marge are thankful they still have their daughter.


Another kid is missing.
Another kid died.
Springwood is in a panic.
The latest victim is a ten-year-old boy.
Ethan Thompson.
Son of my partner, Don Thompson.


He and his wife, Marge, have two children.
Ethan was their oldest.
Now he's gone.
Forensics says he died four days ago.



Four days.
Somewhere out there, the killer is still laughing about what he did to that boy, knowing that we still haven't figured out who he is or where he takes his victims.



All we know is that they all have claw marks in their chests and their bodies are left in places kids usually go to have fun: parks, playgrounds, skate rinks, movie theaters.
The media calls him ""The Springwood Slasher.""
I call him a fucking monster.
This case has been eating away at me for months now.



I knew who was doing this the moment the first kid went missing.
Fred Krueger.
That son of a bitch.


I've known Krueger since he was a kid and I was starting to make a name for myself as one of Springwood's toughest cops.


Even back then I knew there was something wrong with him.


I'm standing in front of Loretta Krueger's modest home, a small two-story house on the edge of town.


I've been here a few times already, trying to get her to tell me something about her husband's whereabouts.


She always says the same thing: she doesn't know anything.


But I know she's lying.
I can see it in her eyes.


She knows something, but she's too scared to talk.
I knock on the door and wait for her to answer.


The curtains move, and I know she's looking at me through the window.


A few seconds later, the door opens a crack and she peers out.


Her eyes are red from crying, and her hands are shaking as she holds onto the doorframe for support.


""Yes?""


""Mrs. Krueger,"" I say, holding up my badge.
""We need to talk.""


She nods and steps aside to let me in.


I close the door behind me and follow her into the living room.


She sits on the couch and folds her hands together in her lap.


I sit in the armchair across from her and pull out my notebook and pen.


""Where is your husband right now?""
I ask, trying to keep my tone neutral.

She hesitates, her voice barely above a whisper.
""I don't know.""
I sigh and rub my temples.
""Loretta, we've been over this before. I know you're lying to me. You have to tell me the truth.""


She looks up at me, tears streaming down her face.
""I'm not lying. I really don't know where he is. He's been gone for days and I haven't seen or heard from him.""


I throw my notebook and pen onto the coffee table and lean forward, resting my elbows on my knees.


""Loretta, I need your help. There's something you can do for me that will help us find your husband.""


""What?""
she asks, her voice shaking.



""Do you have any of his things here? A diary or some papers?""


She nods slowly and gets up from the couch.
She goes to the bookshelf behind me and pulls out a worn diary.

""This is Fred's,"" she whispers, handing it to me.

I flip through the pages, my expression hardening with each entry I read.


The diary is full of twisted thoughts and detailed plans for his victims.



I close the diary and look up at Loretta.

""Thank you,"" I say, standing up.
She nods and wipes her nose on her sleeve.


I turn to leave, but then I hear a voice behind me.


""Mom, what's going on?""
I turn to see a girl standing in the doorway, her eyes fixed on the diary in my hand.


She's about thirteen or fourteen years old, with long blonde hair and blue eyes.


She looks just like her mother, but there's something about her that reminds me of Krueger.


Something in her eyes that makes me shiver.


""Katherine,"" Loretta says, rushing over to her daughter.



""It's okay, sweetie. This is Lieutenant Blocker. He's looking for your father.""
The girl's eyes narrow as she looks at me.

""Why?""


I hesitate before answering.
""We think he might have done something very bad.""


She shakes her head and crosses her arms over her chest.



""That's not true. My father would never do anything bad.""
I sigh and rub my temples again.


This isn't going well at all.
""Katherine, we have evidence that says otherwise. I'm sorry.""



She looks at me, her eyes wide with shock.
""No,"" she whispers.
""That can't be true.""


I nod and look down at the diary in my hand.


""I'm afraid it is.""
She shakes her head again and takes a step back.


""No, you're wrong. My father is a good man. He would never hurt anyone.""


I look up at her and see the tears in her eyes.


She's torn between loyalty to her father and doubt about what he's done.


""Katherine, I need your help,"" I say, trying to keep my voice soft.



""If you really believe your father is innocent, then help me prove it.""
She nods slowly and wipes her eyes on her sleeve.


""There's something,"" she says, looking around nervously.


""My father has a secret hiding spot in the attic. Maybe we can find something there that will prove he didn't do anything.""
I smile and nod.


""That's a great idea. Let's go take a look.""


She nods and leads me upstairs to the attic.
Her heart is pounding with fear and anticipation as she pulls out the ladder to the attic.


I follow her up into the dusty space, my gun drawn just in case Krueger is hiding up here.


She points to a loose floorboard in the corner.
""Check under there,"" she whispers.


""It might hold his secrets.""
I kneel down and pry the board open with my tense hands.


Dust swirls up as I lift the board, making me cough.
I pull out a small box and blow the dust off the top.


I open it and find a bunch of disturbing photographs and mementos from the victims.



Katherine gasps and covers her mouth with her hand as she looks at the pictures.
Tears well up in her eyes as she realizes her father's guilt.


I close the box and put it in my pocket, my jaw tightening with anger.



""It's okay, Katherine. We'll get him. Justice will be served.""


She nods slowly, tears streaming down her face.


""I didn't know,"" she whispers.
""He told me he was working late at the power plant. I didn't know he was doing this.""


I sigh and rub my temples again.


This case is getting more and more complicated by the minute.


I look up at Katherine and see that she's still crying.
""Let's go downstairs,"" I say, standing up and helping her down from the attic.


As we descend from the attic, I hear footsteps approaching.
My heart starts pounding as I signal Katherine to stay quiet.


We hide behind the attic door, holding our breath.


The footsteps stop just outside the attic door.


I grip my gun tightly, ready for a confrontation.


Katherine trembles beside me, fear evident in her eyes.
The door creaks open slightly, revealing Loretta's anxious face.She whispers urgently that 


Fred has returned home unexpectedly.
I nod, understanding the danger.


I motion for Loretta to keep him distracted while Katherine and I slip out unnoticed.


She nods and closes the door again.


I hear her footsteps hurrying away as Katherine and I wait in silence.


I motion for Katherine to follow me as we make our way down the back stairs.

We avoid the creaky steps as we descend, trying not to make a sound.

Katherine's heart pounds in her chest, fear etched on her face.


I keep my gun ready, my senses heightened.
We reach the bottom of the stairs and pause, listening for any sound from Fred.


The house is eerily silent.
I gesture for Katherine to follow me towards the back door.

She nods and inches after me, her eyes wide with fear.


As we approach the door, a floorboard creaks under Katherine's foot.
We freeze, holding our breath.



I grip my gun tightly, ready for Krueger to jump out at us.
But there's no response from him.


The silence stretches out as we wait anxiously.


Finally, I nod and gesture for Katherine to continue following me.


We inch closer to the door, our ears perked up for any sound from Krueger.
But there's nothing but silence.


I reach out and slowly turn the doorknob, trying not to make a sound.


The door creaks open slightly as I push it with my fingers.



I motion for Katherine to slip through the door ahead of me.
She nods and slips through, her heart pounding in her chest.


I follow after her, my gun still clutched in my hand.
We sprint across the yard, our footsteps pounding in the silence.


The shadows stretch ominously around us as we run, making it seem like Krueger could jump out at us at any moment.


Katherine stifles a sob as she runs, fear and betrayal etched on her face.
I grip her arm and lead her towards the safety of the streetlights.


Behind us, the house looms dark and silent, a sinister reminder of Fred Krueger's evil.



As we reach the edge of the yard, I glance back to make sure we're not being followed.
I nod firmly at Katherine as I grab her arm and lead her away from the house.



She nods slowly, tears still streaming down her face.
I know that she's still trying to process everything that happened tonight.


She loved her father dearly and didn't want to believe that he was capable of such evil.
But now she knows the truth, and it's tearing her apart.



Katherine collapses to her knees, overwhelmed by grief and disbelief.
Tears flow freely down her face as she stares at me in shock.
I kneel beside her, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder.
""Stay strong, Katherine,"" I urge softly.
""We'll get justice for those kids.""


She nods slowly, wiping her tears with trembling hands.
I hear a distant noise from the house and tense up immediately.


I scan the area anxiously, my ears perked up for any sign of Krueger.
But he's nowhere in sight.
Satisfied that we're safe for now, I help Katherine to her feet.



She trembles as she stands, still trying to process everything that happened tonight.


I guide her towards my car parked nearby, keeping a close eye out for Krueger.
As we walk, Katherine struggles to come to terms with the weight of betrayal and loss.


She leans on me for support as we approach the car.
I open the door and help her inside before walking around to the other side.


As I slide into the driver's seat, I notice Katherine staring at me in shock.
Her eyes are wide as she tries to process everything that happened tonight.



I start the car, my mind racing with the urgency to report Krueger's crimes.
Katherine sits beside me, silent and shaken.


Her eyes are red from crying as she stares out the window.
I keep an eye on the rearview mirror as we drive away, wary of any pursuit by Krueger.
But he's nowhere in sight.
Katherine clutches her seatbelt tightly as we drive towards the police station.
She's struggling to reconcile her love for her father with his betrayal of that love.

The tension in the car is palpable as we approach the station.

I park and turn off the engine before turning to Katherine.
""It'll be okay,"" I reassure her softly.



""We'll get justice for those kids.""
She nods slowly, still trying to process everything that happened tonight.
I get out and walk around to her side, opening the door for her.

She steps out, still trembling with fear and grief.


Inside the station, we're met by Sergeant Don Thompson.
His face is etched with determination and grief as he stares at us.


I nod at him as Katherine and I approach.
""The bastard did it,"" I tell him bluntly.

""He's been taking those kids from the power plant.



Don's eyes narrow as he stares at me.
""What proof do you have?""
I hand him Loretta's diary and the photographs.


He flips through them, his eyes widening in shock as he realizes the extent of Krueger's crimes.


Don's face hardens as he examines the damning proof.



Katherine stands nearby, her emotions raw and visible on her face.


She clutches her arms tightly around herself, fighting back tears.


Don places a reassuring hand on her shoulder as he stares at her sadly.


""We'll get justice for Ethan and the others,"" he promises softly.


""I'm sorry, Katherine.""
She nods slowly, tears streaming down her face as she stares at him in shock.


Don turns to me, his eyes blazing with determination.


""Let's get the son of a bitch,"" he growls.
I nod firmly at him, my jaw clenched in anger.
""We need to move fast,"" I urge him.
""He could take another kid anytime.""


Don nods at me before rushing off to assemble a tactical team.
I turn to Katherine, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder.


""Wait here,"" I tell her softly.
""We'll get your father.""
She nods slowly, her eyes filled with a mix of fear and hope.


I watch her for a moment before rushing off to join the team.




In the briefing room, Don is already detailing Krueger's hideout at the power plant.
A dozen officers listen intently as he speaks, their faces etched with determination and anger.


Don emphasizes the need for caution and speed as he outlines the plan to take Krueger down.


Katherine watches from a distance, her eyes fixed anxiously on me as I stand at the back of the room.


When Don finishes, the officers rush off to prepare for the mission.

I walk over to Katherine, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder.


""It'll be okay,"" I tell her softly.
""We'll get your father.""
She nods slowly, tears streaming down her face as she stares up at me anxiously.
I watch her for a moment before rushing off to join the team.

Outside, a fleet of patrol cars is waiting in the parking lot.


I jumped into the lead patrol car, adrenaline pumping through my veins as I start the engine.


Sergeant Don Thompson rides shotgun beside me, his face set with grim determination.


The sirens wail as we speed out of the lot, heading towards the power plant on the outskirts of town.


Behind us, a convoy of patrol cars follows, their sirens blaring as they rush to join the fight against Krueger.


I grip the wheel tightly, my jaw clenched in anger as I focus on the road ahead.

Don rides silently beside me, his eyes fixed on the road as he grips his gun and flashlight.

The tension in the car is thick as we approach the power plant.

I signal for silence, cutting off the sirens as we turn onto the access road leading to the plant.

Don nods at me, his eyes locked on mine as he readies himself for battle.


I park a distance away from the plant, not wanting to alert Krueger to our presence.



The other patrol cars follow suit, parking at intervals around the perimeter of the property.


I gesture for officers to fan out and cover all exits.
Don grips his flashlight and gun tightly as he prepares to move in.

I signal for the team to advance quietly, moving stealthily towards the entrance of the plant.


The officers spread out, each step calculated to avoid detection as they move through the darkness.
Don and I lead the way, our eyes scanning for any sign of Krueger.


The air is tense with anticipation as we creep forward, our guns drawn and ready.

I motion for Don to cover me as we approach the entrance.
He nods at me, his eyes locked on mine as he readies himself.



I grip my gun tightly, my heart pounding in my chest as I reach out to test the door.
It creaks open slightly, revealing a dimly lit corridor.
I motion for Don to follow me as I slip inside.


The officers follow us, their footsteps silent on the concrete floor.



We proceed cautiously, our guns drawn and ready as we move deeper into the plant.
The corridors are dark and deserted, but we know Krueger is lurking somewhere in the shadows.



I signal for Don to follow me as we move down the corridor, our senses heightened as we listen for any sign of Krueger.


The air is thick with tension as we move silently, our guns ready to fire at a moment's notice.


Suddenly, a faint noise echoes from deeper within the plant.
Don and I freeze, our ears locked on the sound.
I signal to him, and we creep forward cautiously towards the noise.


Our hearts pound in our chests as we move deeper into the plant, our guns drawn and ready.


The sound grows louder, and I can feel my heart racing with anticipation as we approach a door slightly ajar.


I motion to Don, and he readies himself beside me.
With a deep breath, I slowly push the door open, revealing an empty room cluttered with tools and machinery.

Don and I scan the area, our guns locked on any potential hiding spots.

The room is dimly lit, but I can see that it's empty.
I breathe a sigh of relief as I lower my gun slightly.

Suddenly, a shadow moves behind the machinery.

I motion for Don to cover me as we approach the entrance.
He nods at me, his eyes locked on mine as he readies himself.

I scan the area, my eyes locked on any potential hiding spots for Krueger.



The room is dimly lit, but I can see that it's empty.
Suddenly, a figure emerges from the shadows.
I freeze, my heart pounding in my chest as I raise my gun.


The figure approaches us cautiously, its features obscured by the shadows.
I can see that it's a man, but his face is hidden by darkness.


""Who are you?"" I demand gruffly.
""What are you doing here?""
The figure freezes, its eyes locked on me as it trembles with fear.


Suddenly, the figure steps into the light, revealing a terrified factory worker.

His eyes dart around, filled with panic as he begs for mercy.


I lower my gun slightly, assessing the man's fear.
""What's wrong?"" I demand.
""What are you doing here?""


The worker stammers, explaining that he stumbled upon Krueger's hideout and barely escaped with his life.


""He's got a room deeper in the plant,"" the worker explains.


""It's hidden behind some machinery. He's got kids in there. I saw him taking one of them.""


Don and I exchange a tense glance, realizing we're close to capturing Krueger.
""Stay here,"" I instructed the worker.

""Radio for backup.""

Don nods at me, and we move swiftly towards the location described by the worker.

Our hearts pound in our chests as we approach the area, our guns drawn and ready.

Suddenly, I hear a faint noise echoing from deeper within the plant.

My heart races as I realize Krueger is close.


I burst into the hidden room, my gun drawn and ready.

The relief of having someone to talk to was amazing. And she is amazing. No tension whatsoever and the empathy she holds is next level, I felt so cared for and just seen

We were chatting for so long and she was like we may as well get coffee. I agreed. Then The whole day got away from us.

We spoke about him for like an hour but then it was just laughs and laughs for hours on end. We would say things in sync, and at one point laughed so hard there were tears 

I can't even go into detail because I'm shook. All I will say is by the end I know there was chemistry and now I'm just like what the hell was that. I don't know if I'm insane but I was genuinely aroused and ugh

One of the cafes is in a public building to which we don't have keys to the whole building. So we have to close the cafe an hour before the building closes to give us time to get closed, cleaned up and get out by the time the whole building closes.

I closed the cafe yesterday on time at 3pm, first thing I did was dump all the coffee equipment in the sink to soak ready for cleaning, and went to close the display. While I'm closing the display in enters entitled customer (EC). She can see that I'm literally putting things away, doesn't deter her though, and she asks for a coffee to go. 

I reply politely, I'm sorry we're closed now. 
EC ""you don't look closed, what time did you close?""
Me ""I've just started packing up, we close at 3pm on Sundays""
EC checks time on phone and shows it to me ""but it's only just 3"" pointing to the time 
Me ""yes but it is 3, and we're now closed""
EC ""you're really not going to make me a coffee?""
Me ""sorry but no, we are closed""
*Seems to finally sink* in ""so you're REALLY not serving me a coffee to go?""

I was about to answer, again, But she turned and left muttering that it was unbelievable and such bad service and I am so rude.

Obviously what she doesn't see is that it was a busy day, I still only just got finished off in time (got out with 5 mins to spare), and if I had served her, by the time I'd washed all the coffee equipment in order to make her a coffee, I would've still been making her coffee when the next 3 people asked if I was still open, so I would've had to serve them too, and then probably the 4 more that came after them.

1nzdboo,https://www.reddit.com/r/conferences/comments/1nzdboo/what_really_matters_when_choosing_a_conference/,What Really Matters When Choosing a Conference Venue (from someone who‚Äôs done this too many times),"Choosing the right conference venue sounds simple until you realise how much it shapes everything that follows. The space dictates flow, energy, and even how attendees interact. After years of planning corporate conferences across Europe and Asia, here‚Äôs the checklist I actually use:  
**1. Start with purpose.**  
Before falling for the decor, ask what the event is meant to achieve. Networking, education, product launch, strategy? Each goal needs a different layout and vibe.

**2. Match capacity to comfort.**  
Too tight feels stressful. Too big feels empty. Always check seating flexibility and space for coffee breaks or displays.

**3. Keep location practical.**  
Accessibility beats glamour every time. Think airports, trains, nearby hotels, and lifts or ramps for all guests.

**4. Build in networking flow.**  
People connect in corridors, not just in sessions. Make sure there are lounges or corners where natural conversation can happen.

**5. Feed people well.**  
Good catering keeps energy up. Plan for dietary options, timing, and continuous coffee access.

**6. Test the tech.**  
Strong Wi-Fi, working mics, screens that don‚Äôt flicker. Hybrid setups need stable streaming and onsite tech support.

**7. Align design with brand.**  
Venue style should match the event‚Äôs identity. Modern and minimal for tech, heritage spaces for culture or academia.

**8. Budget with eyes open.**  
Always ask for a full cost breakdown. The cheapest option rarely gives the best attendee experience.

**9. Have a backup plan.**  
Power cut, tech issue, catering delay ‚Äî it happens. A flexible venue team can save your day.

A good venue is not just a backdrop; it‚Äôs the framework that holds the event together. When it works, nobody notices. When it doesn‚Äôt, everyone does.

1nzdb4k,https://v.redd.it/kfxbsyyz5gtf1,Feeding Glitched NPCs: Zoi‚Äôs Table Etiquette & Food Placement Workaround,"So here‚Äôs the deal: you meet NPCs you like, you run `setrelationshipfull zoi_id` to max out the bond, then start customizing them with `custom zoi_id`. But suddenly‚Äîbam‚Äîthey can‚Äôt eat. Total buzzkill, right? Now you‚Äôre wondering: should you just `remove zoi_id` and move on?

Hold up. Before you delete your glitchy friends, here‚Äôs workaround how to deal with the infamous food bug caused by their broken code logic.

# Step 1: Understand Zoi‚Äôs Food Placement Priorities

Zoi places food based on this weird surface priority: **Computer desk > Console table > Coffee table > Dining table > Kitchen counter**

Yeah, it‚Äôs messed up. That‚Äôs why your BBQ steak ends up on a desk in the bedroom instead of the kitchen counter‚Äîeven if the counter is right next to the stove. Zoi even completely ignores the huge dining table and goes straight into a bed room to find computer desk.

# Step 2: Override the Placement Logic

To stop Zoi from putting food on the computer desk:

* Place a **coffee table or console table** closer to the BBQ or stove.
* Make sure **there‚Äôs no wall directly behind** the table. A glass window is fine, but a solid wall will trap the food. (refer video)
* If the food gets stuck in the wall, Zoi won‚Äôt be able to reach it‚Äîeven though they are the one who placed it there. And even if you as a player are able to click it with your mouse, the ‚ÄúCall to Meal‚Äù or ‚ÄúEat a Piece‚Äù actions won‚Äôt trigger.

# Step 3: Help Faulty NPCs Eat

Once food placement is fixed, it‚Äôs time to feed your broken NPCs:

* If Zoi places the steak on a **dining table**, the faulty NPCs won‚Äôt be able to eat it. They can‚Äôt interact with that surface properly. They pick up the food and it dissapears.
* But if Zoi places it on a **coffee table or console table**, the NPCs can pick up a plate and might actually eat because they will hold them in the hand. This animation is crucial.

If you skip this setup, those poor NPCs will just wander around clutching their stomachs, groaning in hunger. And It's damn annoying.

In the video all 3 NPCs friends invited by Nikki couldnt handle food on any surface, they must hold their place to eat. that said they also couldnt clutter the house with dirty plates. which is a good thing. Since inZOI dev still couldnt figure out the post -""call to eat"" routine that zoi must clean up or wash their own dishes. For now everybody just leave their plate any surface unattended except the faulty NPCs.",2,1759738572.0,inZOI,1,1.0,False
