1oi5h87,https://i.redd.it/sdvpzdjmutxf1.jpeg,Finally admitted I hate driving - and found something better,"I moved out of the city last year thinking the quiet life would be nice.

Yeah‚Ä¶ until I realized ""quiet"" meant driving everywhere. Grocery store? Drive. Coffee? Drive. Even the gym is 10 minutes away - by car.

At first, I told myself I'd get used to it. Everyone drives here, right?

But honestly, I hate it. Every drive feels like a chore. The traffic, the tailgaters, the endless stoplights‚Ä¶ I'd show up places already stressed out.

A couple months ago I said screw it and bought an e-bike. Didn't plan on becoming ""that guy,"" but here we are.

Now I ride to the store, to the park, even to work sometimes. No traffic, no gas money, just fresh air and that quiet hum of the motor. Feels kinda freeing, like being a kid again when a bike meant freedom.

I still have my car sitting in the driveway collecting dust, but I barely touch it anymore.

Guess I finally realized - maybe I was never meant to drive in the first place.

I recently got my¬†B1 certificate, and while I‚Äôve been actively applying for¬†marketing jobs¬†(that‚Äôs my background), the job search has been taking a while. In the meantime, I‚Äôve been thinking about getting a¬†part time job at a local cafe¬†(as a barista or similar). Mainly because:

1. I could really use the extra income
2. I think working in a German speaking environment would help me improve my language skills faster than any class could

But I‚Äôm also a bit nervous. I‚Äôve never worked in a coffee place before, and while I can understand a lot of German,¬†fast or informal speech still trips me up sometimes. I‚Äôm worried that local cafes might prefer only someone who speaks fluent German and can handle customer interaction perfectly.

Have any of you or someone you know done something similar while improving your German? Would you say it‚Äôs worth trying even if my German isn‚Äôt perfect yet?

For context: I‚Äôm continuing my German classes¬†and still applying for¬†marketing positions, but since I don‚Äôt know how long that process might take, I thought a part-time cafe job could be a good bridge in the meantime.

We know that the style of the hotels in Disneyland Paris are American. Think New England, New York, the West, or American national parks. So it will have to fit in with that vibe. The location of the new hotel is right next to Disney Village and Hotel New York which suggests that it will probably be a 4-star hotel just above or below Hotel New York, The Art of Marvel.

After researching various themes such as Polynesian or Las Vegas, I find that  a **New Orleans‚Äìthemed resort** could be the perfect fit!

**Concept:**  
A **4-star ‚ÄúDisney‚Äôs New Orleans Resort‚Äù**, inspired by the elegance of the *Garden District* and the vibrant *French Quarter*. Think pastel fa√ßades, Lanterns, white mansion pilars, wrought-iron balconies, jazz in the air, and the scent of fresh beignets.

**Why it fits:**

* The hotel‚Äôs model shows **courtyards, gardens, and a Mickey-shaped pool**, matching the Southern architecture of New Orleans.
* Its **location beside Disney Village** connects perfectly with the **music and nightlife energy of Mardi Gras**.
* It would add a new ‚Äúromantic & musical‚Äù American era to the existing line-up (New York, New England, National Parks, Route 66, etc.).
* There are already existing concept art of a New Orleans hotel, so Disney is already considering it.

**Theme & Atmosphere:**  
Elegant, warm, and full of rhythm, a place where guests unwind to the sound of jazz under soft lantern light and bayou views. The rooms and hotel would, of course, be inspired by Princess and the Frog.

**Ideas:**  
üé∫ *Satchmo Lounge:* live jazz & cocktails  
üç§ *Bayou Grill:* Cajun & Creole cuisine with lake views  
‚òï *Caf√© Beignet:* morning coffee & pastries

It would be a natural evolution for DLP, bringing a new slice of American magic, **the soul of New Orleans** to Paris.

Whether attached to your home or freestanding in the garden, these open-air structures blend **style, function, and comfort** transforming ordinary yards into elegant retreats.

But the big question remains: **Do pergolas actually add value to your home?**

The answer is a resounding **yes** when thoughtfully designed and properly installed, a pergola can significantly enhance your property‚Äôs **value, curb appeal, and lifestyle ROI**. In this guide, we‚Äôll explore how pergolas contribute to both the financial and experiential returns of your home investment, along with expert tips to help you maximize their impact. 

**Understanding the ROI of Outdoor Structures**

Outdoor living spaces have become one of the most desirable features for today‚Äôs homeowners and buyers. As more people embrace **open-air dining, relaxation, and entertaining**, well-designed outdoor upgrades like decks, patios, and pergolas have shifted from ‚Äúnice-to-have‚Äù to ‚Äúmust-have.‚Äù

# Why Outdoor Living Spaces Matter

* **High demand:** Homes with appealing outdoor areas tend to **sell faster and for higher prices**.  
* **Lifestyle enhancement:** Outdoor living offers flexible spaces for dining, working, and socializing.  
* **Cost-effective expansion:** Pergolas and patios deliver added functionality **without the high cost** of full home extensions.  

Among all these options, **pergolas stand out** as one of the most affordable and visually impactful ways to elevate your outdoor space.

# What Makes Pergolas a Smart Investment?

A pergola is a versatile architectural feature made of **vertical posts and crossbeams or a lattice roof**. Available in materials like wood, aluminum, steel, or composite, they can be enhanced with **retractable canopies, vines, or curtains** for added shade and privacy.

# 1. Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal

Pergolas instantly **upgrade your exterior design**. They add structure, definition, and sophistication‚Äîbecoming the visual centerpiece of patios, gardens, or pool decks.

**Curb appeal boost:** A well-designed pergola creates a lasting first impression, increasing your property‚Äôs perceived value.

# 2. Functional Outdoor Living

Think of a pergola as an **outdoor extension of your home**. It can serve as a dining area, lounge, or even an outdoor kitchen cover.

To improve comfort year-round:

* Add **retractable shades or canopies** for sun control.  
* Install **lighting and ceiling fans** for evenings.  
* Include **heaters or fire pits** for cooler months.  

A pergola effectively turns your backyard into a **functional outdoor room** expanding usable living space.

# 3. Energy Efficiency

When strategically placed, pergolas can provide **shade to windows and doors**, reducing solar heat gain and lowering energy bills a subtle but valuable sustainability benefit.

# 4. Low Maintenance, Long Lifespan

Modern materials like **aluminum or composite** require minimal upkeep and resist rust, rot, and pests. This durability ensures your investment remains attractive and functional for decades.

# 5. Increased Property Value

Homes with appealing outdoor structures can see an estimated **50‚Äì80% ROI** on installation costs, depending on material, design, and market conditions. Buyers view pergolas as **move-in-ready luxury features** that add immediate lifestyle value.

# Long-Term Benefits Beyond Financial ROI

# 1. Lifestyle Value

A pergola creates a comfortable, inviting space for **morning coffee, family dinners, or weekend gatherings** encouraging more outdoor enjoyment.

# 2. Health & Well-Being

Spending time outside reduces stress, improves mood, and promotes relaxation‚Äîa return that‚Äôs hard to quantify but easy to feel.

# 3. Design Flexibility

From **rustic wood** to **sleek aluminum with smart automation**, pergolas can be customized to any aesthetic, ensuring a unique and personal outdoor retreat.

# Conclusion

So, **do pergolas really add value to your home?**  
 **Absolutely.**

Beyond their undeniable beauty, pergolas deliver measurable **financial returns** and priceless **lifestyle benefits**. They expand your living space, boost curb appeal, and satisfy the growing desire for indoor-outdoor living making them one of the smartest upgrades a homeowner can make.

(I am pro abortion),"I am aghast at the new rhetoric that makes abortion mandatory unless you are exploitatively rich with a staff of nannies and a fleet of help and resources and find parenting and every sacrifice you have to make not just a breeze but a blessing, otherwise you don't ""deserve"" children.

ALL women are allowed to choose to keep a child AND receive support, love and aid from their family, friends and government, just like ALL women should be allowed to have an abortion AND still receive support and love and help from their friends, family, community and government.

""You shouldn't have had a kid, you don't DESERVE a child because you had one knowing that you couldn't care for them alone on your own without anyone helping you, not even the father"" has become the standard, as if that is even POSSIBLE, or even *possible to predict.*

People remaining childless's *childlessness* adds nothing to society (although they obviously, just like everyone else, contribute in other ways and I respect their choice not to procreate).

Mothers having children, their children DO add to the lives of the childless, even if it is not at this very second.

Yet despite this, children and mothers are portrayed as intrusions in public places (not pubs and taverns and nightclubs, normal places like bookstores and parks and grocery stores and coffee shops and airplanes) and mothers are portrayed as unfit, stupid, drains on society who should only have kids when they, and they alone, can afford to care for a child from birth to death full time without any breaks while also working full time as if she doesn't have kids, all alone on her one-person lonesome.

We find mothers (including teen mothers) especially crucified live online and off all the time for being ""stupid enough"" to ""breed"" and then complaining about it and needing help, help we are told that no one owes you and you should not actually receive ANY help or aid because "" you chose this"" and "" accountability"" and whatnot.

Like I'm a widow. I had 3 kids, inside marriage (although that SHOULDN'T matter, somehow it does), a ""good girl"" who followed all the rules. We did fine before my husband died, money was tight but we managed. Since he died, we've been plunged into poverty, and I've been told ""well you chose to have kids"" and ""well you should never have had kids if you couldn't care for them on your own without any help from anyone if your husband or partner died"" as if that's even POSSIBLE.

I'm so tired of people saying ""you chose this"" because someone had a child and needs help. I'm so tired of mothers especially not being allowed to complain about how hard and awful it is without the peanut gallery going "" you should have aborted, you chose this"".

It's just become yet another way to coerce women to live the way YOU think they should (childless, because apparently having a child is nothing but selfishness and evil upon the world), and just another way to isolate, harm and discriminate against specifically mothers.

Even women with children who were born before abortion was allowed or socially acceptable (or maybe she's religious, and she really BELIEVES that FOR HER, an abortion is killing her child) in their country get told ""you chose this, why are you complaining, you should have aborted, you should have never had kids, you don't DESERVE IT'"" like gee, my kid is 16, I guess I should just go back in time and abort illegally, then?

Please can we be aware of this eugenicist talking point?

ETA: I just also want to point out that this shaming is done through the EXACT same arguments that pro lifers use:

\- You knew sex leads to babies, even on birth control

\- You shouldn't have opened your legs if you didn't want a kid

\- When you have sex, you decide to become pregnant

\- You can just adopt it out (as if adoption isn't terribly traumatic for life for BOTH the mother and child, as if all pregnant mothers or teens are white whose babies are snatched up by the baby market, etc).",0,1761645525.0,TwoXChromosomes,5,0.22,False

The place was packed and someone asked if they could share my table. I said sure.

We both worked in silence for like 20 minutes. Then my laptop charger died and I sighed out loud. The person looked up and said ""Rough day?""

And somehow that turned into a 45-minute conversation. About work, life, travel, books we've read, random observations about the world. It wasn't forced or awkward. It just flowed.

I don't even remember the person's name. We didn't exchange numbers or social media. They eventually left and said ""Thanks for the chat"" and I said ""You too"" and that was it.

But I've been thinking about it ever since. When was the last time I had a real, spontaneous conversation with a stranger? Not small talk about the weather. Not a transactional ""can I get a coffee"" exchange. A real conversation. We're all so in our phones and headphones and bubbles. I am too.

1oi555y,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1oi555y/built_a_project_manager_using_mcp_now_ai_coding/,Built a project manager using MCP: Now AI coding tools actually remember context across sessions,"I subscribed to Claude Code pretty much the day it launched. The experience was smooth at first, but as I used it more, I ran into the same issue many developers face: whenever the compact mechanism kicks in, Claude starts ""forgetting"" things and generates inconsistent or outright wrong responses.

Eventually, I realized that to get the most out of Claude Code, you need to do three things: describe requirements clearly (but not too verbosely or you'll eat up the context window), avoid triggering compact as much as possible, and break tasks into smaller chunks.

To tackle these problems, I tried various approaches including Github Spec Kit and the Bmad Method. They helped, but still had some pain points:

* Easy to trigger the compact mechanism
* Workflows became tediously long
* After Claude Code finished tasks, I'd often lose track of where I was in the process
* Just reading Markdown files made it hard to grasp the full project picture (tons of MD files = cognitive overload)

When splitting tasks to work around context window limits, you constantly have to re-explain what just happened to Claude Code. Development becomes an endless copy-paste fest instead of actually focusing on exploring requirements and doing real work.

  
**What I Built**

So I decided to build my own project management tool specifically for AI coding workflows. It follows a structured workflow: **Draft ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Task** \- breaking down vague ideas into concrete, executable work while maintaining context throughout.

It uses a Notion-like editor interface so we can focus on editing and reviewing plans. More importantly, it integrates with MCP so Claude Code automatically writes back documents and summaries to the system after each execution, making it easy for humans to read and track progress.

**How It Works**

**Step 1: Draft Your Requirements**

You can randomly type anything you want - vague requirements, bug reports, whatever's on your mind.

https://preview.redd.it/hi7utglkmtxf1.png?width=3324&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee2b9538410a1eef449e75fd9df44ade25ffb50

The issue gets created in the draft section, and you can click the ""Start This Issue"" button to copy the prompt.

(Eventually, we could just call headless mode to start the process without copy-pasting, but for now this works.)

https://preview.redd.it/tjv9a783ntxf1.png?width=3338&format=png&auto=webp&s=460e6b54a4f0b61566837a0ee5632a42eca9ef4a

**Step 2: Requirements Clarification**

Paste the prompt into Claude Code (after installing the MCP server).

https://preview.redd.it/y21eacoentxf1.png?width=3084&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcfd98ff03bed5464ec4fc3d9ad71692c5bb3dc9

Claude Code uses MCP to read your draft issue, then leaves comments to clarify requirements. You reply with your answers directly in the UI.

https://preview.redd.it/on3uzv8intxf1.png?width=3346&format=png&auto=webp&s=881bc760b5166d283fae3ef120eac5e681fef2fb

After the discussion, Claude Code automatically summarizes the session using MCP - no copy-pasting needed. You can read the summary in the summary section.

https://preview.redd.it/mc29v3rkntxf1.png?width=3342&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bba55f1a52ec8bebda58aaf094a8d7f65f3b589

**Step 3: Research Phase**

Claude Code automatically creates a research issue to conduct technical discovery on your codebase (especially useful for brownfield projects). You can still edit the research issue's content if any direction seems off.

https://preview.redd.it/wh7ji6rontxf1.png?width=3344&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7bf74e87285a2b9f154eb506cec8f77c07fcbb0

Clear the previous session and start fresh for the research phase.

When the next Claude Code session starts researching, it reads the previous issue's summary via MCP - so you don't have to explain what happened again.

https://preview.redd.it/qicl5igrntxf1.png?width=3336&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ea50ef890932a37a7b51980b0f14638a9c3646

Claude generates a research document for you to verify you're heading in the right direction. You can leave annotations, and Claude will read and respond to them.

https://preview.redd.it/84kcm5cuntxf1.png?width=3334&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7089ba41e1cade99ba8cd51e1287ba2fa1b171a

**Step 4: Planning Phase**

When everything looks good, Claude creates a plan issue. You can ask Claude to split it into smaller tasks. The prompt is automatically generated in the ""Start This Issue"" button - all you have to do is copy and paste it to Claude Code. (Remember to clear the session at every step to prevent context rot.)

There's also a visual relationship graph so you can easily understand task order and dependencies. Sometimes Claude discovers potential technical debt or bugs and creates additional research issues - these also appear in the relationship graph.

https://preview.redd.it/45v7r4uxntxf1.png?width=3334&format=png&auto=webp&s=194a95c3d75e63ec67d9aad8dbd3ff9e990b9088

**Step 5: Execution**

When Claude Code finishes a task, it marks it as done automatically. No more worrying about forgetting your current progress.

You can also select all the tasks Claude generated and copy the headless command (`claude -p ...`). It's kind of like YOLO mode - let them run and grab a coffee. Because each task is a brand new session, you don't need to worry about context rot. Normally, each task completes before Claude Code compacts the session.

https://i.redd.it/prgxh4a3otxf1.gif

**The Result**

That's the whole process - from vague requirement to completed tasks. I think it's been pretty successful because the entire project used this platform to iterate itself (the project management system manages itself, haha).

The current AI coding limitation is the context window, and humans still need to verify each step, so frequent session clearing is necessary. If the context window limitation can't be broken for a while, then we can at least make the process smoother.  I hope through this workflow, vibe coding will not just generate prototypes or small tools, but will approach production-ready products.

Also, because we use MCP to manage the whole workflow, it works with Codex, Gemini CLI, Claude Desktop, and other MCP-compatible tools. This means you can leverage each model's strengths. For example, Gemini excels at searching through long text, so you can use it for the research phase. Then Claude can read those results via MCP and handle the rest of the tasks. It's like having a specialized team where each AI does what it does best, but you manage them all in the same place.

**What's Next**

Fair warning: there are still some bugs. I'm planning to release this platform soon, but I'm not entirely sure if I'm heading in the right direction or if everyone experiences the same pain points.

The first one,



Facts that are corroborated. I am communicating on an internet dating website with women. Will go on a blind date. This is happening. I'm talking to women on internet dating websites. I'm about to go on a blind date.



Something that may or may not be factual. The women I'm conversing with are people I know in disguise and they will surprise and rescue me. That may or may not be factual.



Something that I know is not as I imagine. It'll be a billionaire or pop superstar who shows up at the coffee shop to hire me. Most likely I could daydream about that, but that's not going to happen.



An ambiguous stimulus that leads to conviction. I believed this woman was someone else in disguise by some of the things she said. Some things she said while conversing with me led me to believe she was somebody behind her mask. She was somebody who was going to surprise me in a magical moment.





The next one,



I say to Dr. Natural, an example of predicate logic that just happened to me at the gym. I saw a guy in a t-shirt that said ""genius"". There's no reason to think that it's related to me, but I began to think it's someone from a company like Disney undercover saying, ""My art is genius and will make a movie.""""



And Dr. Natural says, ""Predicate logic. Perfect example of it. Good catch.""



It's not somebody from Disney in a genius shirt saying, ""Andrew, you're a genius.""

And the mom says to Otto, ""You should go to your Halloween party with mental health group.""

Even though our wedding was small and intimate, every detail felt so special. Early guests, family, and suppliers were greeted with a little ‚Äúsurvival goodies‚Äù setup, breads, 3-in-1 packs, swiss miss packs, choco drinks, candies, biscuits, with a framed sign saying ‚Äúfeel free to grab a few.‚Äù Seeing people enjoy it, chatting, laughing, and celebrating with us made everything so meaningful. I‚Äôm really grateful to everyone who helped make the day run smoothly and shared in our joy, you made our wedding unforgettable!

‚Ä¶But then there was one cousin who completely ruined some of that joy.

After the wedding, this cousin **completely emptied the survival goodies setup**. She poured the entire bowl of candies, a mix of Mentos, Monami caramel, mints, Loacker wafers, into her bag. She also took all the coffee packs, Swiss Miss, the remaining loaf of bread, and the cheese spread. By the time she was done, all that was left were the paper cups and my framed signage. This happened **towards the end of the event**, while some of our family members were busy changing into their casual clothes. We were willing to share, but she didn‚Äôt wait for us to offer anything, she just took it all. My sister later looked for coffee after the event, but there was none left.

It didn‚Äôt stop there. When my husband and I arrived at the reception hall, I **saw her receiving a box of takeout from the restaurant staff,** I presume it contained some of the empanadas and pastries from the afternoon tea tower (again, i'm sure she used her daughter as an excuse), since a friend's wife mentioned that when it's their turn, there were only few left. Mind you this is an intimate event with only 24 guests, originally 28 so we have some extras definitely. This happened **while I was giving my thank-you speech**. She also took sugar cookies that were distributed and placed on their seats as part of the table styling, and at one point asked if she could get a bottle of wine ‚Äúbecause her daughter likes them.‚Äù

And just to pile it on, the same group ignored the dress code. We had a green-and-pink theme (long sleeves polo inside) + suits for men, my Tito showed up in a blue polo. You can easily point it out that he's out of theme, that's why we kept on reminding them about the dress code, since we only have a few guests, and it's very noticeable especially on photos. Her daughter on the other hand, who was supposed to lead the prayer, arrived completely ""looking"" unprepared. I had said it was okay not to wear floor-length, but the dress should not be above the knee, and it definitely should not be combined with a bare face and loose hair.

Then, after the wedding, this same group kept promoting their resort and inviting everyone to visit. I get the gesture, but seriously, read the room. Maybe bring it up later in a group chat, not while we‚Äôre still wrapping up *my wedding day.*

I know I shouldn‚Äôt let it ruin such a beautiful day, but it honestly left such a bad taste. I feel like they completely disrespected all the thought and care we put into everything, from the food setup to the attire guidelines.

I posted a couple of weeks ago about my experience so far with switching. Slight recap, I had gone from 7.5MG of Mounjaro to 0.5MG of WeGovy (Could no longer justify MJ price increase!). I am on maintenance. My experience of 0.5MG was positive. I did feel hungry at times which I did have to remind myself was \*OKAY\* to feel. I had become so used to the absolute rocket fuel effect that Mounjaro gave, I forgot what it was like to be a human being with normal urges to eat. As I said in my last post, I appreciate it can be alarming to experience the 'Food noise' and 'Hunger' after so long with it being completely muted and effortless but just because those feelings did creep in here and there, does not ultimately make WeGovy useless. Having said that, I did make the leap to 1MG just whilst I am trying to work out the ins and outs of maintenance. Again, I have noticed that there are periods of ""I could do with having some lunch now"" which I absolutely did not get on MJ. Is that food noise? I wouldn't say so. Satiety has been very, very good. I finish my meal and that's enough for me. I still don't crave snacks or sugary food. I'm still only able to drink my 2 cups of coffee a day (Compared to my FIVE pre mounjaro!). The GLP1 is definitely doing fantastic things for me and I know if I didn't have WeGovy inside of me, I would be hungry, craving and obsessed with food. I am thankful every day for WeGovy, honestly. In my opinion, it doesn't have that same knockout strength that I found with Mounjaro - But I am actually happy about that. I was starting to become physically ill. My hair was falling out. I was vitamin deficient. 

Weight Wise - I have continued to drop weight whilst on WeGovy despite actually being in 'maintenance'. I am tracking my calories and I do still struggle to eat to my 'maintenance' calories BECAUSE of WeGovy. In hindsight, I probably should have just stuck at 0.5MG and maybe I'll go back down with my next pen. 

What have I found VITAL when switching? Calorie counting.   
And trust me, I know how horrible the thought of doing that can be. I used to have a bit of an 'issue' with food (Pre GLP1 days) and I found calorie counting to be something I would obsess over and torture myself with. I took calorie counting completely off the table in order to heal but that led to a lot of weight gain and other really unhelpful habits. When I started Mounjaro, I didn't count calories but when I started WeGovy, I know I needed to keep an eye on things should it \*not\* be very effective for me. Calorie counting has kept it very simple for me and I can actually see that I need to be increasing my calories so that I am able to start maintaining and stop losing. I see many people on here asking for advice about their weight gain since being on WeGovy and I'm always a bit weary of suggesting they track (I don't want to make them uncomfortable) but it's been a game changer for me.

So to sum up my big ol' ramble - WeGovy is gentler than Mounjaro but absolutely still effective for me. I do have feelings of hunger when my body needs fuel (and that's perfectly okay). For me, it feels like a kinder, softer version of Mounjaro but still doing exactly what I want it to do. 1MG is the highest I will go for now, for sure. I cannot sing it's praises enough. I hope this helps anyone feeling a bit disheartened. ",5,1761644764.0,WegovyUK,3,1.0,False

Bangalore doesn‚Äôt ease you in. My routine became predictable fast: wake up at 6:30, leave by 7:45 thinking I‚Äôd beat the rush. Spoiler alert, I never did. The office was nice, all glass walls and free coffee, but getting there every day felt like earning it. Evenings, I‚Äôd stop at MTR for crispy dosas or grab Congress Kadalekai from Veena Stores when cooking felt like too much effort, which was often.

The weather, though? Absolute blessing. October to February made everything worth it. Friends visiting from other cities would shiver in hoodies in 18-degree weather while we roamed around in t-shirts. Weekends meant Cubbon Park if we felt active, or planning Nandi Hills trips that rarely happened because we‚Äôd sleep through our 4 AM alarms. Bangalore has this effect where urgency just dissolves.

Space is limited, with my countertop being roughly 37 cm deep. Considering this, I wonder if the Silvia Pro X is too large for my needs, especially since it‚Äôs bigger and some suggest the Silvia V6 for smaller spaces and lighter usage. 

As a tech enthusiast, I would also plan to eventually install Gaggimate or a similar PID if I move to the Silvia V6. Did I make the right decision?

The only thing that was more prominent after the operation was bitter taste in mouth after waking up and also sometime after eating (like 2 hours after eating). Past 2 weeks it started to go downhill again though.

I started to have stomach pain (not abdomen, but stomach, the organ) everyday, for couple of times a day, bitter taste in mouth every day, regurgitation/reflux of liquid to my easophagus, also feel weird discomfort in my back on right side past 3 days. Also my stomach feels full for long time after eating (I can hear liquid moving there?), and I started to be nauseous after eating because of that. First time this morning I woke up with mushy stool again - not linked to anything I ate and I am just....done.

I still hope this is only a transition period and it will get better, but I do not know, I am starting to feel very depressed again.

For background: I did not have any stones or sludge in my gallbladder, everything looked normal, but pathology report came back with moderate chronic cholecystitis and narrowing of gallblader in fundus and close to bile duct. So there was something wrong with it, but I am just thinking that this was accidental. I really thought my issues were gallbladder related due to family history, but maybe it was not...

In 2024 when my symptoms were the worst I had endoscopy that showed reactive gastropathy of antral mucosa (I do not drink coffee or alcohol, take NSAIDs or smoke), so I am thinking maybe this was caused by bile reflux, that is now worse after surgery? PPIs never helped my reflux, it made it worse in times...

I don\`t know. Just venting I guess.",2,1761644326.0,gallbladders,4,1.0,False

Recently I've had to quit caffeine altogether for a few months while I start some new medication, and so now I'm finding myself drinking only decaf (and a lot of it). My favourite local caf√© serve a sugarcane/ethyl acetate decaf and it's really good as a black coffee.

However, I love to drink cortados, and I've noticed that cortados made with ethyl acetate decaf have a slightly odd flavour. I repeated this by making cortados at home with a couple of other ethyl acetate decafs and found the same thing. 

So now I wish I repeated the decaf project with cortados and saw how each worked in a milk drink, and not just black. Has anyone else noticed a weird flavour with ethyl acetate decaf milk drinks?

1oi4u4e,https://youtu.be/lPoOhn57Tsc,5 Very Scary TRUE Rural Harvest Night Horror Stories,"# ""The Red Shed"":

I had just turned thirteen that fall, and life on our hog farm in rural Iowa felt like it always had, one long routine stitched together by chores. The scent of hay and manure clung to every breath of the crisp air. My parents were constant motion, always checking, fixing, barking orders to keep things running smooth. Mom took care of the books and the lighter tasks. Dad handled everything that required strength. His hands were thick and cracked like the old barn wood, and he never slowed down, no matter how late the sun went down.

That November evening, the corn harvest done and winter creeping closer, we stayed out in the main barn, sorting equipment beneath the harsh white glare of the overhead lights. The pigs snorted and shifted in their pens, restless in the cold. Wind scraped across the leftover stalks out in the dark fields, sounding like whispers.

‚ÄúAlex, hand me that wrench,‚Äù Dad said. His voice was steady, though exhaustion dragged at the edges. He was fixing a water line that had been leaking for days. Mom hovered close by, wiping her hands on her jeans, looking paler than the fluorescent bulbs allowed. She had been feeling weak since her procedure a few days earlier. She never liked to show it.

‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I said, passing it over. The metal felt icy against my skin. We fell into silence again. Only clinks and snorts and the quiet sighs of the building settling around us.

Mom shifted suddenly, bracing herself against the stall. ‚ÄúDavid, I think I need a break,‚Äù she said. Her voice was soft, but the firmness underneath told me this wasn‚Äôt the first time she had brought it up tonight. ‚ÄúMy legs are shaky. I‚Äôm going to head in.‚Äù

Dad looked up, eyes narrowing not in concern, but calculation. ‚ÄúFine. Grab the pet carrier from the red shed first. I need those kittens out of the way before tomorrow.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt a request. It never was.

Mom hesitated. Just a flicker. She nodded anyway. ‚ÄúAlright. Won‚Äôt take long.‚Äù She gave me a faint smile. ‚ÄúAlex, come in soon. Dinner‚Äôs waiting.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Mom.‚Äù

She pulled on her jacket, stepping out into the cold. The barn door closed behind her with a long groan, leaving me and Dad alone with the echo.

We worked longer than we should have. The clock hands crawled. Outside, the night swallowed the windows, turning them into black mirrors that reflected our tired shapes. Something gnawed at my stomach, a quiet alarm I tried to ignore.

Dad finally straightened, stretching his back with a wince. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check the office. Make sure we logged everything.‚Äù His tone was clipped, impatient.

The office at the front of the barn was a cramped room with a desk, old papers, and monitors showing fuzzy security camera feeds. While he flipped through notes, I kicked my heels against a stool, trying to shake off that growing unease.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs your mother?‚Äù he muttered after a few minutes. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt take that long to get a carrier.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs checking the kittens?‚Äù I said, though it felt thin. The shed was close. The darkness outside wasn‚Äôt usually unnerving, but suddenly it felt like something living.

Dad sighed sharply. ‚ÄúGo get her. Tell her to hurry.‚Äù

I grabbed the strongest flashlight we kept. The moment I stepped outside, the cold hit with a bite. Gravel crunched under my boots as I hurried toward the red shed. The door sat slightly open, a thin band of light cutting through the dark.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I called, pushing it open.

The air inside smelled of feed and dust. Tools lined the walls. A lamp flickered above. No reply.

I swept the beam from corner to corner.

That was when I saw her.

She lay face down on the dirt. Knees drawn like she had tried to crawl. The corn rake jutting from her back looked wrong, almost planted there on purpose. Blood spread dark into her shirt, a slow, terrible bloom.

My lungs locked. I dropped to my knees beside her. ‚ÄúMom!‚Äù I whispered first, then screamed it. I touched her hand. Cold. Too cold.

I ran.

‚ÄúDad! Dad!‚Äù The flashlight bounced wildly as I sprinted across the yard. My voice cracked with each shout. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Mom!‚Äù

He bolted toward me, and when he saw her in the shed, all the color drained out of his face. ‚ÄúNo. No, no.‚Äù His hands shook while he fumbled with the rake, trying to pull it free. The sound was wet and final. We carried her together, her body heavy and slack, to the truck.

‚ÄúIs she going to be okay?‚Äù I kept asking as we flew down the empty road.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe must have fallen. She was dizzy earlier.‚Äù His voice didn‚Äôt match his eyes. His knuckles on the wheel looked like bone.

The hospital lights were too bright. They took her away. The minutes dragged. When the doctor returned, his expression told me everything. He said she didn‚Äôt fall. The wounds were too many. Stabbed again and again.

Police filled the waiting room, asking questions Dad answered too quickly. ‚ÄúIt was an accident. She went alone,‚Äù he insisted.

People started talking. Small towns always do. Mom had friends who said she felt trapped, that Dad decided who she saw and what she did. Months of tension replayed in my head. Arguments over dinner. His voice sharp. Hers tired and pleading.

The police searched his tablet. Searches about infidelity. About punishment.

Then they reviewed the security footage. Or tried to. The entire hour when Mom left the barn was missing.

A deputy asked me quietly, ‚ÄúDid you see your dad leave the barn that night?‚Äù

I remembered the moments he stepped away. Quick. Intent.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I said. My heart hammered so loud I wondered if he heard it. ‚ÄúA couple times.‚Äù

The investigation stretched on. The farm grew quieter each day, like it was holding its breath. Dad said the marriage was fine. He said he loved her. He said everyone else was lying.

The jury saw through him.

Life in prison.

I live with my aunt now. Nights still take me back to that shed. I see the beam of the flashlight. The blood on the dirt. The rake‚Äôs terrible shine.

The farm sits abandoned. Fields overgrown. An entire life left to rot.

Sometimes, when I think about my mother walking into the darkness that night, I wonder if she already knew she wasn‚Äôt coming back.

Out there, far from everything, the danger isn‚Äôt in the shadows or the animals or the wind. It is in the hands you trust. It is in the silence of a place where no one can hear you scream.





# ""Tied Up Lies"":

I had lived across the road from my brother‚Äôs farm for as long as I could remember. Rural Kentucky could feel like its own pocket of time, especially in October when the corn stood tall and dry enough to whisper against the wind. John and Mary kept the place running with steady hands and tired backs. Their boy, Alex, had come home from the army a year earlier, all restless ambition and half-finished ideas. Their daughter, Anna, worked with horses down south and only visited when her schedule allowed. She had just come home from a big race, exhausted but glowing with pride.

On most days, I saw them from my porch, waving or crossing the road to share coffee and gossip. Familiar comfort. Family routine. Though that week, something in the air felt wrong, like a chill that didn‚Äôt come from the season.

Earlier, Alex had brought home a stranger named Victor. He claimed he needed work and could help around the farm. Fixing fences. Clearing the barn. That sort of thing. He didn‚Äôt last long. Anna told me Victor made her uneasy, always staring, always asking questions that didn‚Äôt belong to casual conversation. I tried to calm her over the phone, saying some folks don‚Äôt know how to be around people. Alex brushed it off too. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt a good fit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo big deal.‚Äù

Still, a quiet alarm stayed ringing in me.

Sunday evening, John called to invite me to supper. I declined, distracted by chores and the ache in my knees. I could see the house glowing from my window, warm against the darkening fields. Around eight, voices carried across the road. Laughter maybe. I smiled a little to myself and finished the dishes.

Then gunshots shattered the quiet.

Sharp. Echoing. Wrong.

My mind tried to explain it away. Hunters? A car backfiring? No. Too close. Too many.

I tried their phones. No answer. One after the next. My heartbeat felt thick in my throat as I crossed the road, gravel popping under my shoes. The fields smelled like cold earth and broken stalks.

Halfway up the drive, a figure stumbled out of the shadows. Alex. Wild-eyed. Tape clinging to his wrists like torn snakes. He collapsed into me.

‚ÄúAunt Beth,‚Äù he gasped. ‚ÄúVictor. He came back. He tied us up. Shot them all.‚Äù

Before I could think, I was moving past him toward the house. The front door glass was shattered. The knob turned too easily. The living room looked frozen mid-breath. Anna lay face down on the carpet, blood spreading wide and dark beneath her. Two holes in her back. My knees nearly gave out.

I called her name, whispering and choking on it.

In the kitchen, Victor lay sprawled, eyes open to nothing. A steaming crockpot burbled beside him as if the world hadn‚Äôt just caved in.

I forced myself down the basement stairs. Mary sat slumped against the concrete wall. A neat, awful wound in her forehead. I backed up the steps, shaking, and found John outside on the back porch steps, chest ruined, body crumpled like a coat left behind. The gun glinted near his hand.

I stumbled into the yard, dialing 911. The operator tried to steady my breathing as I stared at the house that only minutes ago had been full of life.

Alex rocked on the ground, muttering pieces of the story. He tried to fight. He grabbed the gun from Victor. He couldn‚Äôt save them.

The police arrived fast. Lights washing over the corn rows, red and blue bleeding across that quiet Kentucky darkness. They wrapped me in a blanket, but nothing warmed me.

Then came the questions.

The tape on Alex‚Äôs wrists was loose. Just a single loop. Anna‚Äôs bindings had been layered tight. Too precise. Too patient.

The bullet count didn‚Äôt match. The magazine held seven. Nine had fired.

The friendship between Alex and Victor wasn‚Äôt chance. They found diner footage from the week before. Jokes. Drinks. Familiar touches on the shoulder. Not strangers. Not even close.

Money troubles had been eating Alex alive. Resentment too. Anna was the golden child. John wouldn‚Äôt give Alex a share of the farm. Every look, every conversation replayed itself in my mind until I saw what I had tried so hard never to imagine.

Days later, investigators connected the final dots. Victor had been a pawn, guided through whispered plans and promises. The woman who introduced them brokered communication. Victor did the dirty work. Alex finished it.

He confessed before the trial even started.

Now the farm sits quiet. Too quiet. The fields are overgrown. The porch light never comes on. I still walk the road at dusk sometimes, careful not to look too long at the dark windows.

People think evil sneaks in like a storm. Loud. Obvious.

I know better now. It can wear familiar boots, eat supper at your table, call you family, and still leave you standing alone in the end.





# ""The Fifth Victim"":

The harvest season in our rural South African village always meant long days cutting sugar cane under the sun, sweat soaking our shirts and the sweet scent of fresh stalks clinging to our skin. That year, fear clung to us even tighter. Women were disappearing. Their bodies later surfaced in the cane fields where we worked, left like secrets buried in the green. My cousin Zama became one of them, and the terror that haunted everyone suddenly came for us too.

Zama lived with us on the edge of Mthwalume, a quiet place where neighbors shared sugar and stories over fences. She was 38, gentle, and devoted to her daughter. On the morning of July 6, she straightened her skirt and smiled at me while grabbing a small shopping bag.

""I‚Äôll be back soon,"" she said. ""Leave supper. I‚Äôll help when I get back.""

I only half looked up from repairing our fence, nodding. I watched her walk down the dusty path, the sun catching the bright cloth wrapped around her head. That was the last time I saw her alive.

Days crawled by. The police came and went, asking questions already asked.

""Anyone suspicious around here?"" one officer asked.

I told him what everyone already knew. Women were being found dead, hidden deep in the farms. Three so far. Their names whispered like curses. Prayer meetings were held at the spots they‚Äôd been discovered, wooden crosses hammered into the soil, wilted flowers left under a sky too bright for such sorrow. Women no longer walked alone. Sunset brought locked doors and silent dread.

One evening, a candle flickered weakly between me and my aunt, Zama‚Äôs mother. Her voice trembled as she spoke.

""Musawakhe, my child is out there somewhere. I feel it. What if she is hurt?""

Her hands twisted a cloth until the fabric puckered. I tried to reassure her.

""I will search again tomorrow.""

I didn‚Äôt believe my words. The cane was thick as a maze and stretched farther than hope could carry.

Sleep refused to come. The quiet inside the house pressed on my chest. Near midnight, I grabbed a flashlight and slipped outside, determined to search the abandoned fields where the other bodies were found. My footsteps crunched along the path between sleeping homes, then faded into dirt and grass as I stepped into the fields.

The cane rose high above me, leaves brushing my shoulders like restless hands. Every rustle forced me still. Wind. An animal. Or someone who shouldn‚Äôt be there.

I called Zama‚Äôs name, louder each time. Mud sucked at my shoes from the last rainfall. I pictured her teasing me as she often did, laughing at my slow work.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll finish that fence next year at this rate,‚Äù she‚Äôd joke.

The memory punched the air from my lungs.

After what felt like hours, I reached Siyabonga‚Äôs farm. That was where two bodies had been found before. Siyabonga was a hardworking neighbor. Over tea earlier that week he warned me.

‚ÄúBe careful. Whoever did this knows these fields like his own home.‚Äù

His words echoed now, darker and heavier.

I swept the light across the edge of the field. A flash of white caught my eye near a twisted tree. My heart hammered as I knelt to move the leaves. A skirt. Her skirt. My chest tightened.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered.

Her body lay still beneath the branches, eyes closed as if mid-breath. Flies buzzed. The smell was a wall I could not push through. The flashlight slipped from my shaking hands. Darkness swallowed everything.

A sharp crack behind me snapped me back. Cane breaking. Someone there.

I grabbed the light and spun, its beam slicing the shadows.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs there?‚Äù My voice cracked.

Silence. Then another step, closer this time.

I ran. My legs scraped against stalks and thorns, lungs burning as terror chased me faster than anything human should. Images of the other women flashed in my head, discarded and alone. I did not want to be the next.

Bursting onto the main path, I sprinted until home came into view. I pounded the door until my aunt opened it. Words tumbled out.

‚ÄúI found her. Zama is gone.‚Äù

Her wail cut through the night as she pulled me close.

Police confirmed it in the morning. Her ID still in her pocket. Another woman was found nearby. That made five.

The village erupted. Rage and grief swallowed every conversation. Two men were arrested. One confessed, claiming the deaths were his doing. The next day, he took his own life in his cell. The second man walked free. No evidence held him.

Siyabonga later shook his head when I told him everything.

‚ÄúOne man cannot move bodies like that with no car. There is more to this.‚Äù

The fear never left. Even after the harvest, even after headlines moved on. The cane fields still sway in the wind every night, but their rustling sounds too alive. Too familiar.

I still take my flashlight sometimes and walk the paths where we once joked and worked. I listen for footsteps that do not belong. Someone out there knows those fields as well as we do. Someone who blends in.

The harvest returns each year, but the memory of what we found remains carved deep into the soil. Evil does not always run from the places we call home. Sometimes it hides there.





# ""Repossession"":

I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that our lives had slipped away like the last ears of corn picked clean from the field. My father, David, had poured every drop of sweat into that land, and now it was gone, taken by the bank without a second thought. Our small Minnesota town always felt quiet during harvest, the fields stretching under the wide sky like a promise. In the fall of 1983, that sky seemed to press down on us, heavy and unforgiving.

The bank‚Äôs letters piled up. The auction sign hammered into the dirt felt like a gravestone. We were left with nothing except the humiliation of losing what generations had built.

After supper one evening, my father called me into the kitchen. His hands were cracked from years of wrenching machinery and hauling feed. His eyes looked hollow.

‚ÄúAlex,‚Äù he said, voice low. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt let them get away with this. That land is ours. Paul and his helper Henry are coming tomorrow to inspect things. We need to be there first.‚Äù

My breath hitched. I was eighteen, still building dreams, but every one of those dreams sat in that dirt. ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer right away. He just glanced at the shotgun leaning against the wall. The silence between us said more than he ever could.

That night I lay awake, staring at the ceiling. The wind pushed through the dry stalks outside, whispering like a warning. The world kept moving, tractors humming in distant fields, but ours had come to a stop.

The next morning, we drove back to the farm. Even after repossession, it still felt like home. My father parked the truck behind the barn, out of sight. He took the shotgun. He handed me a rifle. ‚ÄúOnly if we have to,‚Äù he said.

We hid in the old shed. Hours dragged on. Every creak of the building made me flinch. My legs cramped. The silence pressed on my skull. I kept imagining neighbors driving by, seeing us crouched there like criminals. Maybe that‚Äôs what we already were.

Finally, a dust cloud appeared on the road. Paul‚Äôs shiny sedan rolled up like it didn‚Äôt belong anywhere near a farm. He stepped out confident as ever. Henry followed, clipboard under his arm. They strolled the property like shoppers at a yard sale.

My father walked out first.

‚ÄúPaul,‚Äù he called. ‚ÄúWe need to talk.‚Äù

Paul froze when he saw the shotgun. ‚ÄúDavid‚Ä¶ come on now. Put that down. We don‚Äôt want trouble.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou already made plenty,‚Äù my father said. ‚ÄúYears of work. You crushed it in one signature.‚Äù

Henry swallowed hard. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the way.‚Äù

I stepped out beside my father, rifle raised though my hands shook. I didn‚Äôt want any of this. I wanted him to back down. I wanted everything to stop.

Paul lifted his hand slowly. Maybe he was reaching for his phone. Maybe something else. I never found out. My father fired. The blast tore the air apart. Paul collapsed, blood blooming through his white shirt.

Henry ran. His fear hit me like a punch. I yelled, begging him to stop. He didn‚Äôt. My finger pulled the trigger before my mind caught up. He crumpled into the dirt.

The silence afterward felt cruel. Nothing moved. Nothing dared.

My father approached Paul. The man was still breathing, choking on pain. ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have pushed us,‚Äù my father whispered, finishing what he started.

We buried them near the irrigation ditch, the soil dark and soft. My arms trembled as I dug. Every shovel of dirt felt like a new weight dropped on my chest. I kept thinking a car would appear, someone would see us. No one did.

My father sent me home as the sun dipped low. The world looked unchanged. Birds flew. Combines worked. Everyone else kept living while we had burned our futures to ash.

Sheriffs came days later, asking questions. We lied. My father didn‚Äôt blink. I barely spoke. At night I lay awake, heart pounding at every sound, certain ghosts wandered the field.

When the deputies found blood and tire tracks, they returned. They took my father in. He came home hours later, more defeated than angry.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre closing in,‚Äù he said.

The next morning he was dead in the barn, the shotgun beside him. The note said he did it to protect us. I never believed that. He just couldn‚Äôt face what we had done.

They found the bodies. They found the guns. They found me guilty.

Now I stare at these gray walls, replaying that afternoon in the empty fields. Every shot still echoes. Every heartbeat of hesitation still cuts through me. I think about how the land looked under the autumn sun, golden and endless. It was everything we lived for, and everything we destroyed.

I had been drifting for months, taking whatever work I could find, when I met Roy Baxter down at the mission in Springfield. He looked like any old farmer, rough beard, clay-colored cap, a slight shuffle in his walk. He cupped a hand behind his ear whenever someone spoke, claiming he was hard of hearing. Maybe he was. Maybe he wasn‚Äôt. He offered me work on his farm, a place out in the countryside where the roads ran long and empty. ‚ÄúBuying cattle at auctions,‚Äù he told me. The pay was good enough. I needed a bed. So I went.

We turned off the highway and drove deeper until the stars disappeared behind stacks of dark corn. The Baxter farm sat alone, the closest neighbor miles off. The house leaned a little, tired siding and a porch that groaned when Roy stepped on it. Ethel, his wife, watched from the kitchen with small, sharp eyes like she was trying to see through me. She barely spoke when she slid a plate of beans and bread my way. ‚ÄúSpare room‚Äôs upstairs. Work starts early.‚Äù Her voice had no warmth, only rules.

The days started blending together. Roy had me open a post office box under my name, then a bank account with cash he handed me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll use those for the livestock. Easier that way.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt understand why the account had to be in my name, but I told myself not to poke holes in good fortune.

We hit auctions twice a week. I‚Äôd buy cattle with starter checks, then Roy would flip them fast. He‚Äôd pat my shoulder sometimes, saying I was catching on quick. Ethel always hovered nearby, scribbling notes in a little book like she was inventorying me as much as the cattle.

The farm never felt alive. There were chores, sure, but the quiet settled heavy. At night I lay awake listening to the hogs snorting or the corn rustling in the breeze, every sound too precise in the dark. One afternoon I went behind the barn to dig out some tools. My boot caught on something. I crouched and brushed the dirt away. A bone. Too long to be from a pig. White like it had been underground too recently.

When I stood, Ethel was right there. She hadn‚Äôt made a sound. ‚ÄúStay away from back here.‚Äù Her tone cut cold. No explanation. No smile.

That night I listened to Roy and Ethel whispering in the kitchen below my room. Words slid through the wood floor in fragments. ‚ÄúNext one‚Ä¶‚Äù and ‚Äúchecks are ready‚Ä¶‚Äù The more I thought about that bone, the worse those whispers sounded.

A few days later, the real checks arrived at the bank. After another auction run, Roy complained I‚Äôd bid on the wrong stock. Ethel‚Äôs look lingered too long. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs time to wrap this up,‚Äù she said without looking at me. My gut tightened. I said I‚Äôd close the account in the morning and move on. Roy gave a slow, thin smile. ‚ÄúMorning, then.‚Äù

Sleep was a lost cause. Around midnight, a board creaked outside my room. The door eased open. Ethel‚Äôs silhouette took shape in the crack. She didn‚Äôt step in. She just watched. When the door closed again, I lay frozen, breathing shallow, certain I wasn‚Äôt meant to see tomorrow.

Ethel claimed she had errands early, so she left before sunrise. Roy made eggs in silence. Then he asked me to help in the barn before we left. ‚ÄúPest problem,‚Äù he said, grabbing a .22 from the wall. Vermin rifle, he called it.

Inside, the hay smell was mixed with something sour. The tractor outside was hitched to a trailer. A shovel and a folded sheet of tarp lay in the bed. Tools for a cleanup, not pest control. Roy handed me a stick and pointed to a dark hole in the dirt. ‚ÄúStart there.‚Äù

I crouched and prodded the ground. Something cracked under the pressure. My heartbeat thudded in my ears. I looked back just as I heard a small metallic click.

Roy stood there, rifle raised, eyes dead calm.

I tried to keep my voice even. ‚ÄúWe can close the account today. Clean slate. No trouble.‚Äù

His finger twitched on the trigger. ‚ÄúEthel‚Äôs already in town waiting,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúCould be simple.‚Äù He sounded tired, like this was just one chore too many.

I talked fast, every word a plea disguised as reason. The bank would ask questions if I vanished. People had seen us together. Slowly, impossibly, the barrel dipped. ‚ÄúYou speak of us, boy, we‚Äôll find you,‚Äù he said.

We drove to town. Ethel‚Äôs face drained when she saw me step out of the truck still breathing. They closed the account with stiff politeness. I didn‚Äôt go back to the farm. ‚ÄúKeep everything,‚Äù I told Roy.

I found a bar and tried to drink the shaking out of my hands. That‚Äôs where I met Rose. I told her everything. She didn‚Äôt laugh or walk away. She agreed to drive me back to grab my stuff.

When we pulled up, Roy and Ethel stormed out of the house, fury all over their faces. I told them Rose was my sister. Ethel wrote down her name and license plate like she was filing it away for later. ‚ÄúGet your things and leave,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

I listened.

Weeks later, I landed in jail in Nebraska for public drunkenness. A news report came on about a farm in Missouri. A couple arrested. Five bodies dug up behind a barn. Transients. Shot. Buried with no names.

I sat on the cold cement floor staring at that flickering screen, knowing I should have been number six. I still don‚Äôt know why Roy lowered that rifle. Maybe he hesitated. Maybe I just got lucky.

Every harvest season, when the wind rattles through tall corn, I think of that bone in the dirt and Ethel watching me sleep. I remember the silence of those fields. The emptiness hiding secrets beneath the soil.

I left alive. Most didn‚Äôt.",1,1761644020.0,horrorX,4,1.0,False

This post isn't necessarily for me, pero I just wanted to share this recent experience that my brother had from this. 

Just for context:

My brother went to this SB Branch sa in Clark, won't name which specific branch but this was in 2018. My brother isn't a coffee drinker and was just there with a friend when this manager had served him a free cup of coffee. He was 19 at the time, and my brother being the social butterfly that he is, he politely accepted and allowed this guy to have a conversation with him. 

He added him on facebook which my brother consented to, and they started talking. At first the guy was just being nice and convincing him to apply as a part-time barista at the branch he was managing. As they got closer, he would be slipping some dirty joke here and there and my brother wouldn't think of it as he thought it was just normal to bring up those kind of topics as a joke or humor kumbaga. They never met anymore after the initial meet (nung binigyan sya ng free drink, lahat after that was through chat)

But then it progressed from these supposed jokes, from him sexually harassing him. He said this was after their initial meeting in 2018. Years went by my brother was looking for a job with me, he applied sa branch nayon kase ang reach out sya sa guy after years, this was in 2023 at this point, and he got the job and all. 

He then also applied as an IT in a BPO company and got accepted and decided to pursue that instead. SInce nagkaroon ng reconnection between him and the manager, and na-hire naman sya, they got closer again and went out. It was around 9 pm daw, and after hanging out for some coffee, the manager then was suggesting mag *""spakol""* daw sila, which my brother obviously turned down the idea because wtf is that??

Tapos he started asking a bunch of sexual things about him, then one thing lead to another, and he grabbed my brother's crotch and said to drop him off immediately. The guy realize he fucked up and admitted through chat that he harassed him as he apologized for it. My brother, being my brother, he started cussing him out and blocked him everywhere and never told a soul about it. 

Then, a few more years went by (recently, in fact 2 days ago) my brother had decided to take matters into his own hands. He started threatening this guy and demanding money, he first asked for 30k then wasn't satisfied and asked for another 80k. 

at this point, this guy had already informed the authorities and my brother got caught in an entrapment operation and now he's detained and was formally charged with Chief Robbery Extortion if iremember correctly.

Now I don't agree with my brother on how we handled things, but what's done is done and I just need to know if anyone knows of the chances of my brother winning this case?

07:00 - Carefully arrange my lego collection in order of how many bricks in each model have at least two dimensions of equal length.

14:22 - See the surgical patient again, and leveraging subtle cues I picked up during my previous assessment around their superego and attachment style, suggest to them that their desire to have their tumour excised really comes from their pathological need to demonstrate their independence at all costs from their mother. Document their lack of capacity and tell them that only time can heal their wounds.

15:41 - Enjoy a lazy afternoon in the hospital cafe, marvelling at how few referrals I've been receiving.

15:51 - Realise why, and return to the surgical patient's room to retrieve the CL Psych phone I'd accidentally left there. A little awkward since they were crying for some reason. I pull their team's JMO aside on my way out of the ward and suggest a social work referral.

16:06 - Review the cardiology patient I've been consulting on. He's still anxious -- I can tell because he's clammy and pale. I increase his citalopram to 120mg BD and suggest that cardiology review whether he really needs his sotalol given his QTc prolongation.

Recently, I got a new job. I haven‚Äôt told that many people, just a few of my close girlfriends (and you all). Unknowingly, one of them told an ex-crush of mine, and he was fully supportive.

He texted me congratulations and asked me all sorts of questions. He was really invested in my future. I was so greedy, I called him right away. 

We caught up about his weekend trip to San Francisco. The last time we saw each other was September. I missed him a lot. But he has a girlfriend now, which makes this even more difficult to write.

I feel guilty and conflicted. We were pretty good friends before he got coupled up, and I never told him how I felt. I‚Äôve kissed him before but I‚Äôm not sure he remembers since it was so long ago. We were never together romantically or publicly. But I don‚Äôt know, for some reason today, I ended up asking him out to coffee and he said yes. 

I‚Äôm very big on morals and boundaries. I really want to see him, and from our conversation today, it sounds like he wants to see me. But I also don‚Äôt want to put him in a difficult situation with his girlfriend. So, I‚Äôm trying really hard to treat this as a friend-thing.

Why am I dissuading myself from saying ‚Äúnever mind‚Äù? Is this normal? I‚Äôve never been in this situation before with guys who have girlfriends, so this is completely new territory for me. Maybe I‚Äôm just overthinking this? I don‚Äôt know. ",1,1761642679.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share a small milestone in my side project journey ‚Äî I just got my very first paid subscription today!

I‚Äôve been building Coffee Mood, a simple iOS app for people who love coffee as much as I do. It started as something I wanted for myself ‚Äî a cozy way to record every cup of coffee and the little moments around it.

Here‚Äôs what the app does so far:
- Add illustrated coffee records (like espresso, pour-over, latte, etc.)
- Write a short note or journal about how you felt that day
- Add coffee photos and store names (auto-filled with Google Maps)
- View your month as a calendar of coffee moments
- Export your records as images to share on social media
- Add a widget to see your ‚Äúcoffee day status‚Äù at a glance
- Light & clean UI inspired by a paper diary

The app is currently $3.99/year or $9.99 lifetime, but honestly, seeing someone actually decide to support what I made means more than any number.

 It‚Äôs still far from perfect, but I‚Äôm really proud of how far it‚Äôs come. If you‚Äôd like to try it, feel free to download and share your UID with me ‚Äî I‚Äôll gift you a free annual membership as a thank-you for the support. ü§é

After countless late nights, failed prototypes, and way too much coffee, I finally launched MorteNoir ‚Äî my take on what streetwear should be when you strip away the hype and focus on the aesthetic.

The concept: Dark, minimalistic apparel for people who find beauty in the shadows. No loud logos plastered everywhere, no following trends for the sake of it. Just clean designs with a moody edge and that underground feel.
The skull with rabbit ears became our symbol ‚Äî it represents that duality of softness and darkness, vulnerability and strength. Sounds pretentious when I write it out, but it made sense in my head lol.

What we're offering:
Premium hoodies, bombers, and tees
All-over print pieces for those who want to make a statement
High-quality fabrics (because cheap blanks are a dealbreaker)
Designs that work whether you're hitting the streets or just vibing at home
I'm based in the UK and honestly just stoked to finally have this out in the world. It's been a journey going from sketches to actual products people can wear.

Would love to hear what you think ‚Äî constructive criticism welcome. We're still growing and figuring things out.

I almost threw it away. God knows I wanted to.

But curiosity‚Ä¶ or guilt, maybe‚Ä¶ made me read it.

The first few entries were just ramblings‚ÄîDavid blaming himself for the fire, talking about his wife, Hailey, and their kids. But then things got dark.

He wrote about hearing voices, seeing them in mirrors, and smelling smoke that wasn‚Äôt there. The further I read, the more his writing changed‚Äîbecoming sloppier, more fragmented, and paranoid.

The last couple of entries however were written like he got his sanity back compared to the entires before.

I took two more shots before answering. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre trying to cheer me up, you‚Äôre doing a fucken shit job at it.‚Äù I slammed the glass down. ‚ÄúI lost everything in that damn fire, Mason. Everything I cared about. My wife, Hailey‚Ä¶ my kids, Thomas and Emily.‚Äù

Mason sighed and turned toward me, pity softening his expression. ‚ÄúCome on, David. Is this how they would‚Äôve wanted you to live? A jobless drunk, sleeping in your car?‚Äù

I stared down at the sticky countertop, the reflection of the neon beer sign rippling in spilled liquor. ‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt ask myself that every night?‚Äù

The bar hummed with low chatter and distant laughter, but for me it was all white noise‚Äîjust ghosts pretending to be people.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just trying to help David. We‚Äôve been friends since kindergarten; there‚Äôs nothing I wouldn‚Äôt do for you.‚Äù

Mason stood up and pulled out his wallet, placing cash under his glass, and handed me two hundred-dollar bills.

‚ÄúUse this money wisely, man, please, don‚Äôt just spend it on more alcohol or drugs.‚Äù

He gives me one last look and pats my shoulder before exiting the bar, leaving me sitting at the counter alone.

The rain was cold when I finally left the bar. It hissed on the asphalt, soaking through my jacket. My car sat where I always parked it‚Äîalone, under a flickering streetlight that made the wet metal glisten like oil. I climbed in, the seat creaking, the stale smell of whiskey and sweat filling the air.

On the dash, the photo stared back at me: Hailey‚Äôs smile, Thomas‚Äôs missing front tooth, Emily clutching her stuffed rabbit. I reached out, thumb tracing Hailey‚Äôs cheek.

‚ÄúI miss you,‚Äù I whispered.

Something shifted in the back seat‚Äîjust a faint rustle.

I turned quickly‚Äînothing but shadows and my worn blanket. I exhaled, laughing to myself. ‚ÄúToo much whiskey again.‚Äù But the air carried a smell that didn‚Äôt belong there.

Burnt wood.

I froze.

That smell‚Ä¶ that damn smell.

It started as a whisper in my sleep.

‚ÄúDavid‚Ä¶‚Äù

I woke up sweating and with a pounding headache. The car windows were fogged from the inside. Outside, fog hugged the lot like a ghost. I wiped the glass with my sleeve‚Äîand froze.

Written in the condensation were the words:

WHY DID YOU LEAVE US?

The letters bled down the glass as I blinked, melting like ash in water.

I scrambled out, flashlight in hand, scanning the lot. No one there. The fog moved like breath, curling and folding around me. I could swear I heard children laughing‚Äîa sound both sweet and wrong, echoing too close.

When I got back in, the photo was gone.

My hands shook as I searched the seat, the dash, and under the floor mat. Nothing. Then, from behind me, a voice whispered through the dark:

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù

I spun around. Empty. The air reeked of burnt plastic.

I drove all night, too afraid to stop.



April 13, 2015

‚ÄúMan, you look like hell,‚Äù Mason said the next morning. We sat in the diner, coffee steaming between us.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt sleep,‚Äù I muttered.

He leaned back, studying me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta stop doing this to yourself. The fire wasn‚Äôt your fault.‚Äù

I looked up sharply. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt it? I told Hailey I‚Äôd fix that damn outlet. I told her I‚Äôd be home early. I wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúDavid, stop,‚Äù Masons expression changed looking more serious. ‚ÄúThere was nothing you could‚Äôve done David, it wasn‚Äôt your fault. This could have happened to anyone.‚Äù

I looked up at Mason holding back tears ‚ÄúI was at work when it started. The wiring caught. The whole damn house went up in minutes. The fire chief said they didn‚Äôt even make it out of the fucken hallway.‚Äù

Silence stretched between us. Mason rubbed his temple, searching for words that didn‚Äôt exist.

‚ÄúIf you  keep chasing their ghosts, and you aren‚Äôt careful, you‚Äôll end up joining them,‚Äù he said finally.

Maybe that‚Äôs what I wanted.



Apirl 18, 2015

Nights bled together. I stopped seeing people, stopped calling Mason. The bottle became my companion. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw them‚Äîthe house, the flames licking the windows, Hailey‚Äôs silhouette at the stairs.

Then, one night, I woke to the sound of humming.

It was her voice. Soft, gentle. The lullaby she used to sing to Emily.

‚ÄúGo to sleep, my little star‚Ä¶‚Äù

My breath hitched. ‚ÄúHailey?‚Äù

The air shimmered in front of me. A faint outline formed‚Äîher shape in the driver‚Äôs seat beside me, skin pale, eyes empty. She turned, smiling that same perfect smile that once melted my heart.

‚ÄúCome home, David.‚Äù

I blinked‚Äîand she was gone.

But in the passenger seat, lying where she‚Äôd been, was the photo from before‚Ä¶ edges charred, her face blackened by soot.



Apirl 19, 2015

Today, I drove to what was left of our home. I hadn‚Äôt been there since the funeral.

The property was overgrown, and the mailbox rusted and bent. The skeleton of the house still stood, hollow and black. The roof had caved in years ago. I stepped inside, each board groaning beneath my boots.

The air was damp, thick with mildew and something else‚Ä¶ something sweet and rotten.

Every step echoed. The wallpaper peeled in strips, revealing smoke-stained studs beneath.

Then I heard it.

A child‚Äôs laughter‚Äîlight, muffled, coming from upstairs.

‚ÄúThomas?‚Äù I whispered, half believing.

I climbed the charred steps, the wood soft and crumbling under my weight. The hallway stretched longer than I remembered.

At the end, Emily‚Äôs room.

Her door was open.

Inside, the walls were scorched black, and the ceiling was half-collapsed. In the corner, her stuffed rabbit sat upright, untouched by time, one glass eye missing.

And behind it, scrawled across the wall in black soot:

‚ÄúCOME HOME, DAD.‚Äù

My stomach turned. I backed away‚Äîand heard the floor creak behind me.

‚ÄúDavid.‚Äù

Her voice again. Close this time. Warm.

I turned‚Äîand saw Hailey standing at the end of the hall. Her face was blistered, skin cracked and oozing, but her smile‚Ä¶ that smile was the same.

‚ÄúYou came back,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúWe missed you.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt breathe. She stepped closer, bare feet leaving wet ash prints on the floor.

‚ÄúHailey‚Ä¶ what‚Äîwhat are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre waiting, David.‚Äù Her voice distorted, breaking apart into static. ‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôd never leave us.‚Äù

Behind her, two small shapes appeared. Thomas and Emily. Their eyes were hollow pits, skin pale and split.

Thomas held out his hand, the skin of his arm peeling like paper. ‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶ come play.‚Äù

Emily giggled, her teeth black and cracked. ‚ÄúStay with us, Dad.‚Äù

My heart slammed against my ribs. ‚ÄúNo‚Äîno, you‚Äôre not real‚Äî‚Äù

The walls groaned. Flames erupted down the hallway, crawling like living things. Smoke filled my lungs.

Hailey‚Äôs voice grew deeper, layered with something inhuman. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to come home.‚Äù

I stumbled backward, tripping over debris. The floor split beneath me, heat searing my legs. I screamed as the world became fire.

The house was alive‚Äîbreathing, burning, consuming. The walls pulsed like veins, the ceiling dripped molten tar.

They closed in around me.

Hailey‚Äôs charred hand reached through the smoke, gripping my wrist with impossible strength. Skin sloughed off her fingers, exposing bone, but she held fast.

‚ÄúStay, David,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better here. You don‚Äôt have to hurt anymore.‚Äù

Her eyes were black pits glowing from within, twin furnaces of grief and rage.

Thomas and Emily circled me, laughter warping into shrieks. The air screamed.

I felt something break inside me‚Äîsomething human
.
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come home.‚Äù

Her grin widened.

Flames swallowed us whole.



That‚Äôs where David‚Äôs journal ends. 

They found the car the next morning, parked in front of the house's ruins. Engine still running. Inside, the front seat was empty except for a journal, a bottle of whiskey, and a single photograph on the dashboard.

Three faces smiled back, edges burned away until only one remained clear: David‚Äôs.

The police report called it a suicide. I identified the body later‚Äîhalf-burned, found in the basement of the old house.

Locals say if you drive down Sparrow Lane late at night, you‚Äôll see the glow of fire flickering through the trees. Some say they hear laughter.

Others say it‚Äôs crying.

And a few claim that if you listen closely enough‚Ä¶

You can still hear a man whispering inside the flames,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home.‚Äù

Part of me still thinks it‚Äôs wrong‚Äîlike I‚Äôm exposing something that was never meant to be read.

However, the cops gave me the journal, stating that I was listed as David‚Äôs emergency contact. It was found in the passenger seat of his car the night he was discovered. Pages half-burned, some soaked in whiskey, others covered in what looked like ash and blood.

I almost threw it away. God knows I wanted to.

But curiosity‚Ä¶ or guilt, maybe‚Ä¶ made me read it.

The first few entries were just ramblings‚ÄîDavid blaming himself for the fire, talking about his wife, Hailey, and their kids. But then things got dark.

He wrote about hearing voices, seeing them in mirrors, and smelling smoke that wasn‚Äôt there. The further I read, the more his writing changed‚Äîbecoming sloppier, more fragmented, and paranoid.

The last couple of entries however were written like he got his sanity back compared to the entires before.

And that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre about to read,

I don‚Äôt know if what he described was real or if it was all in his head.

However, after what I saw when I returned to the house‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.

But once we actually go on the trip, he suddenly becomes extremely frugal, like, doesn‚Äôt want to go anywhere after the first 2 days, complains about every restaurant being ‚Äútoo expensive,‚Äù and acts irritated completely shuts down and mopes around if I suggest doing something fun that costs money unless it‚Äôs exactly what he wants to do. He‚Äôll say things like, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt need to waste money on that‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just stay in the hotel and keep it cheap and get Uber Eats‚Äù or let‚Äôs get takeout so we don‚Äôt have to pay tip. I am very understanding and accommodating but sometimes I wanna sit somewhere and enjoy my meal and take pictures- like I am a girl after all and I work hard too. Meanwhile, he‚Äôll happily spend on things he wants like a specific coffee place, without a second thought or if he wants a whole croissant to himself or pizza. I‚Äôm always walking on thin ice because I over communicate now to make sure he ‚Äúsigns off‚Äù on what we do- example let‚Äôs say the trip is California : I felt like having sushi in California - I have to find a cheap place, he will insist on spending $20 on a whole pizza before hand to eat so he‚Äôs full and then he‚Äôll have two bites at sushi spend only $20 for his food and complain about being full and how expensive it is and how tired he is while I enjoy mine. My portion will cost $40 but to him it‚Äôs more even though I didn‚Äôt eat all day and didn‚Äôt get a whole pizza beforehand. It‚Äôs technically the same. This is how annoying he is. Even though I show him the menu a day before, day of and everything. I warned him before this particular vacation we are on that I don‚Äôt want to discuss finances if everything is already agreed upon but we still got into an argument. He forces me to get two things to share and sorry like I don‚Äôt want to share - I work hard all year too and deserve to enjoy sometimes. I‚Äôm mostly home and don‚Äôt go out much. Mind you these vacations are 3-5 days and we‚Äôre not doing pricey euro trips. Most of it is driving.",10,1761640643.0,JustNoSO,8,1.0,False

I‚Äôd like to do a little ‚Äúpractice hangout,‚Äù something like a casual lunch or coffee, where we just talk and get to know each other in a friendly, respectful way. Think of it like a mock date, but purely for social practice, not romance.

I‚Äôll cover the meal or activity, and I really appreciate anyone who‚Äôs kind and patient enough to help me with this. It means a lot to me to practice in a safe, pressure-free setting.

I‚Äôll cover the meal since it‚Äôs my idea :) plus extra $50 to compensate for your time 

Anyone interested please message me, thanks!

But have anyone tried to do nothing for 1 hour ? without feeling that this clock is so dam slow !

Humans just spend time on wrong thing that's it.

people with scarcity mindset call it from negative perspective.

I saw a post here, a person was complaining how he is wasting 4 hours out of no where

But he mentioned some things he do,

wakes up in morning,

makes coffee ,

sits to study,

somehow end up on mobile,

again tried back to work,

again back to mobile...

See how he is wasting his time doing wrong things.

he makes coffee first thing is the morning - comfort zone, also a person who wants to do study, will wake up early and straight to the workouts or study, not make coffee first.

after making coffee he sits to study shows that he don't really care about study, just doing it for the sake of doing it.

then he goes for mobile some how, again shows doing for the sake of it.

watches reels, or what ever bro is into,

fries his dopamine receptors early in the morning and bro want to get things done and be productive.

This is most Important thing, if you want to do XYZ work, there should be reason behind it

If I don't study - i will die uneducated and shit life

If I don't workout - I might get a bad disease

you need to find that ""why""

Most people say I want to be productive and study more, but why?

is your why important to you or, not that important to be more productive and study more

If yes - you have some distractions remove them first

If no - no one can save you, keep watching content how to be more productive, and study whole book in 1 day!",0,1761639515.0,studytips,0,0.5,False
