My (24F) boyfriend (22M) had been begging me to make his favorite food for WEEKS. I had tried to tell him that it was a really annoying thing to make and shop for as we just moved into an apartment and didn‚Äôt have any pots or pans. Also I‚Äôve never had to cook for anyone but myself and I‚Äôve never made this before (lasagna). Regardless I agreed I‚Äôd do it and I did. It took about 2.5 hours and halfway through he asks me to heat up leftovers for him to snack on while he waits and I do. I heated up all of yesterday‚Äôs leftovers (wasn‚Äôt much but was easier to heat up all at once) and I told him not to eat it all and to save space for the lasagna. Time goes by and the lasagna is done. I made him a plate bc that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôm used to doing for dinner and I give it to him. I finished my serving and I‚Äôm super proud out how good it is, but when I go to check on him he hasn‚Äôt touched his. I bring it up as more time had gone by and it‚Äôs still sitting on the coffee table. His response was that he had the leftovers and I gave him too much and he‚Äôs not hungry. That‚Äôs fine but I ask him to tastes bite of it bc I‚Äôm super happy with how it came out and he just refuses multiple times and says he‚Äôs going to bed. He didn‚Äôt even bother to put it up he just left it on the table.

1mxvjmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mxvjmq/the_curious_cat/,The curious cat,"My name‚Äôs Van. I make a living digging into other people‚Äôs secrets, the kind that usually want to stay buried. Lately, though, it feels like the ground‚Äôs shifting under me, and I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm standing on luck or a landmine.

The cops I work with joke I‚Äôve got a horseshoe tucked somewhere unmentionable. Maybe they‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve been at this for years, skirting close calls, walking out of raids without a scratch. But luck has a nasty habit of running out.

That‚Äôs how I ended up neck-deep in a case I should‚Äôve let die. Stubbornness kept me hooked, like a fish on a line. And the line led straight to a small pharmaceutical outfit called Mentis, a company with clean labs, polished lawyers, and whispers of something far dirtier.

The department tore through their offices more than once, but every time the shelves were spotless, the records immaculate, the evidence just out of reach.

According to the briefing, Mentis might be nothing more than a front for a cartel. The suspicion came from one odd detail: they only make a single pill, and it isn‚Äôt sold anywhere. No ads. No prescriptions. Nothing on shelves.

Here‚Äôs the kicker. Despite having no real product, the company never seemed strapped for cash. No investors bailing, no layoffs, no desperate moves to scale up. They‚Äôve kept the lights on for years, tucked neatly into one of the busiest parts of the city.

Red flags everywhere, but every raid came up dry. The cops kicked down doors, checked the books, and tore the place apart. Same result every time: spotless.

That‚Äôs when they pulled me in. They wanted me sniffing around while they kept knocking politely on the front door.

It‚Äôs been almost a month since that briefing, and I‚Äôve got the same to show for it as the cops: nothing. Not a damn thing. It‚Äôs almost laughable.

One time, I sat across from them in a meeting, staring at the table while they asked what I‚Äôd found. I didn‚Äôt answer. Couldn‚Äôt. The silence stretched until it soured, and finally they stood, shook my hand, and thanked me for my ‚Äúservice.‚Äù I did the same, then walked out feeling like a fraud.

Weeks slipped by after that. Still, I couldn‚Äôt let it go. Not out of pride, but something else. The whole case made my skin crawl, like we were all circling the truth without ever touching it.

And every time I heard there was no news, that itch came back, digging in deeper. Like the story wasn‚Äôt finished, and I was the only one who knew it.

So, I started from scratch. Did some thinking. One thing we never touched was the most obvious question: who was actually getting the pill, and what was it?

Looking back, it was a glaring oversight. We had never dug into that angle. Not cautious. Just sloppy.

Every search we ran was based on the idea that the pill was a front, a distraction from whatever they were really up to. I wanted to slap myself for missing the obvious. My job was to think outside the box, and I‚Äôd failed.

Tracking deliveries wasn‚Äôt hard. I followed one shipment, and it led me to a plain office building, the kind that blends in with everything around it. Nothing shady, nothing flashy, just four walls and a sign that read *ECR Services*.

But when I checked the records, the company wasn‚Äôt there. No licenses. No filings. No trace of it ever existing. Just a name on a door, sitting in plain sight.

Online searches turned up nothing, but I knew I had stumbled onto a lead. I kept it quiet. If Mentis caught wind, they would bury me. It was a legal nightmare waiting to happen, and I was standing in the middle of it.

I wandered into the caf√© next door, a cozy little place, and struck up a conversation with the staff. That was when I learned something odd. The office was supposed to be a cleaning company. Except when the caf√© tried to hire them, they were told no. The cleaners only worked for private clients.

That set off alarms. The setup felt too familiar, almost identical to Mentis. No public-facing business, no clear revenue, yet somehow still afloat. Maybe they had wealthy clients tucked away, but that did not explain everything.

And then there were the pills. What business does a cleaning service have with pharmaceuticals? The more I thought about it, the less it made sense.

I needed answers, and I needed them fast. Which meant doing something risky.

In this line of work, taking risks becomes routine. This time, the risk was slipping into the building when most of the staff had stepped out.

I noticed a few heading down a side stairwell toward the basement, which left only two upstairs, easy to spot through the windows. That was my chance.

I eased through an unlocked window, heart hammering, and dropped into a plain office. On the desk sat rows of pills, lined up neat as candy.

I scanned the bottles until I found one nearly empty. I pocketed it and slipped back out the same way I came in, careful to leave no sound behind.

Outside, I counted my prize. Three pills in total.

I went home that night and weighed my options. After a while, I had to admit the truth: I had no idea what to do with the pills. Handing them over to the police would land me in trouble, and I didn‚Äôt know anyone who could analyze them.

That left me with only one option. Try them myself.

Earlier that evening, while I was waiting for a chance to slip inside, I had overheard a conversation. An older man was talking with someone who looked out of place, a rookie type who carried himself like he didn‚Äôt belong.

From the bits I caught, the pills were used to dull disgust and deaden smell.

Holding the pills in my hands, I couldn‚Äôt think of any medicine that worked like that. Maybe a strong sedative, maybe some hallucinogen, but the men I saw earlier had looked fine after taking them. So it had to be safe.

Even so, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to try one. Not yet. I slipped them into the inner pocket of my jacket, placing them inside a small plastic bag, and left it at that.

For the next few days, I kept watch on the ECR building. Sometimes I sat on a bench, other times I leaned against a wall or killed time in the caf√© next door. I made sure never to linger in the same spot twice.

And still, nothing. Their routine never changed. Jobs are spaced out every couple of days. They left separately in cars, all wearing the same uniform, and came back looking filthy.

But there was something odd about the way they returned. Something I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on.

The dirt on their clothes was always dark, with a reddish tint. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the thought that it might be blood would not leave me.

Eventually, I decided to take another risk. That morning, I bumped into the younger man I had noticed before and slipped a small listening device onto him.

Later, I caught part of their conversation and pulled a location from it. I rented a car and drove there ahead of them, but the closer I got, the tighter the knot in my stomach grew. Maybe it was the air, maybe the neighborhood itself, but something felt wrong.

The streets grew emptier the farther I went. In an area like this, the silence was unnatural. Then I saw it. A truck parked in front of a house with the ECR logo I had come to recognize.

Out front sat a heap of cleaning supplies, confirmation that I was in the right place.

I parked a few blocks away and continued on foot. The closer I got, the heavier the hesitation grew, like every part of me was begging to turn back. I could not explain it, but I ignored the warning. Curiosity burned hotter with every step.

Seconds later, I was standing at the door. What happened after that is something I will regret for the rest of my life.

The door creaked open, and the stench hit me at once. Rotting flesh, human waste, and the sharp tang of blood. My stomach lurched.

For a moment, I almost ran, but I forced myself to look inside. Blood smeared across the walls and floors. Furniture smashed. The place was a ruin.

But the mess was not what held me. In the middle of the living room lay two bags. From one of them, a head jutted out, the eyes dull and empty, stripped of all life.

I bolted. Out the door, down the street, into my car. I did not stop until I reached the police station, stumbling inside before I could even catch my breath.

Everything was a blur. By the time I heard anything, evening had already settled in. I sat in the police station, counting the minutes, replaying the images in my head. Half an hour passed before someone tapped me on the shoulder.

What they said stunned me. They asked if I was sure of the place, if I was certain about what I saw. I just stared. Then they showed me a photo.

It was the same house. Same walls, same windows. But there were no stains, no broken furniture, no chaos. The home looked untouched, even newly refurbished.

I stared at the picture, refusing to believe my eyes.

The next moment, I was in the back of a cruiser, escorted by an officer I knew. On the drive, he kept asking if I was alright, if I had slept, and if I was under the influence of anything. I could tell he meant well, but I stayed silent.

I needed to see it for myself. I knew what I had seen.

But reality told me otherwise. I stood again on the same doorstep, opened the same door, and walked the same hallway. The living room was spotless. Every detail mocked me, each scene slapping me with doubt, my stomach sinking with every step.

By the time I came to my senses, I was being escorted out and driven home. They must have decided I was finished for the day, that I had finally lost it.

But I cannot accept what I saw. I just can‚Äôt. Yet here I am, left with nothing but the memory.

The days blurred together. I locked myself inside my house, sinking deeper into a spiral I could not pull out of. Friends came by, and a few officers I was close to checked in, but none of them could shake me loose from whatever they thought had rattled me.

Some blamed stress. Others said I must have seen wrong. I even caught whispers of drugs. They kept guessing, never once believing my words.

One day, for reasons I still cannot explain, my mind turned to the pills. At first, it was just a thought, but once it surfaced, it refused to fade.

Even in my sleep, it haunted me. In dreams, the pills were always there, like an obsession I could not figure out.

And then there were the cleaners. Their faces when they came back from a job, drained yet calm, like it was all routine. By the next day, they carried on as if nothing had happened. But no normal human could act that way.

They could not all be psychopaths. That was impossible. In the past, I looked into the young man, Howell. Fresh graduate, good family, good record, by all accounts a decent person. I could not believe someone like that could face horrors every day and treat it like a job.

If my suspicions were right, the pills were the reason.

I pulled one out, a green capsule, and rolled it in my hand. After a moment's hesitation, I tossed it into my mouth.

Sleep hit me fast; I was too exhausted to even notice the transition. When I opened my eyes again, night had already fallen. I had slept through the entire day, yet somehow felt calm and refreshed.

Then the phone rang, yanking me back to reality. This early? I thought, squinting at the clock. It was the station, and judging by the multiple missed calls, they'd been trying to reach me for a while. Apparently, they needed me for a case that required my expertise.

After everything that had happened, I would have refused, and I had, so many times when they'd tried to bring me back. But this time, for reasons I couldn't explain, a strange eagerness pushed me to get back in the game.

I showered and enjoyed it for the first time in days, then made coffee and something closer to a late-night snack than breakfast. Looking at the clock, I realized it was very early morning, that liminal hour when night bleeds into dawn.

At the station, they briefed me and said it was good to have me back. That was when I saw Agent Reese and, to my surprise, the young man from ECR. They had been questioning him since the afternoon.

Now they were letting him go. Reese‚Äôs voice was calm, far too calm for my liking. I knew that tone. She only used it when she was angry.

I volunteered to escort the young man out. While he was distracted, I slipped his ID from his pocket. The ECR logo stood out on the card. Easy to take, and maybe useful later, I told myself.

I went back inside and got the gist from the other officers. They said they had found Howell in a room torn apart; the walls painted with blood. But when they showed me the photo, I saw only a mess of chemical spills and scattered junk, nothing close to what they described. I thought about speaking up, but then I heard Agent Reese losing it in the background and decided I did not want to be her next target.

There was also the matter of the uniform they returned. They claimed it had been smeared in blood, but when I escorted Howell out earlier, it was only dirty. None of the dark stains I had seen on the others when they came back from jobs before. Strange.

The work here was winding down, so I stepped outside. That was when I spotted a truck with the ECR logo parked across the street. What was it doing here?

Before I could think, a scream cut through the air. I turned and saw Agent Reese charging toward me through the glass doors.

She was almost through the door when something unseen tore her apart. One moment she was sprinting, the next she was split clean in half, like some grotesque effect come to life. Except the blood wasn‚Äôt blood. It splattered, writhed for a moment, then collapsed into a heap of dead rats. Dozens of them, limp and stinking, strewn across the floor.

From the pile stepped a man in a spotless white suit marked with the ECR logo. A mask hid his face, leaving only his eyes. In his hand gleamed a blade dripping with a yellowish ooze, thick and toxic like chemical waste.

The figure pushed the door open, and in the blink of an eye, he was standing right in front of me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Van, right?‚Äù His tone was light, almost warm, as though we were meeting over coffee instead of standing in the middle of carnage.

‚ÄúYeah, I am.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what compelled me to answer, but the words slipped out smoother than they should have, considering what I had just witnessed.

He nodded as if pleased. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be finishing up here soon, and we‚Äôd like you to come with us,‚Äù he said casually. ‚ÄúThe Removal Department would like a word with you. Specifically, about the pills you took. And don‚Äôt bother denying it. We know you have them.‚Äù

I could only stare at the man, but he went on.  
‚ÄúAnd after your meeting, I‚Äôd like to propose a job opportunity. I promise it pays better than whatever you‚Äôre doing here.‚Äù

I would have run, but the man placed his hand on my shoulder. His palm was smeared with yellow stains and grit, and the moment it touched me my body betrayed me. I froze, rooted to the spot, unable to move as his eyes locked on mine.

Then a voice called from behind.

‚ÄúBoss, I bagged the rats,‚Äù one of the ECR men said in a disturbingly cheerful tone, his pristine white overalls untouched by the filth around us. With unnatural strength, he swung the bag onto the roof, then let out a sharp, unsettling cackle.

The man in front of me chuckled. ‚ÄúAh, it seems our job is done. I would‚Äôve loved to see Rick and the others‚Äô faces when they found our little parting gift, but‚Ä¶ maybe another time.‚Äù He raised his palm toward me. ‚ÄúThe ID. Give it.‚Äù

Before I could even protest, my body moved on its own. The card was already in his hand.

He released me, and for a moment I thought I could run. But deep down, I knew it would be useless.

His laugh came low at first, then swelled into something manic, echoing in the night. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

I finally snapped out of it. I was about to turn and bolt when a hand clamped over my head. My body locked up instantly, every muscle refusing to move.

With his free hand, the man slipped something from my pocket. The pill. He popped one out and shoved it between my lips. I tried to spit, but his fingers pushed it down my throat. I gagged on it, tasting not the capsule but the bitter tang of stale blood, and I knew it had to be from Agent Reese.

Then, without warning, I was dragged to the truck. The space inside was cramped, pressed in by two others dressed in the same pristine outfit as the man before. The doors slammed shut, and the world outside disappeared.

It‚Äôs been a year at most since that night. I‚Äôm still learning the ropes. Thankfully, I wasn‚Äôt sent to Extermination, though even working in Removal is no easy task.

One of the higher-ups apparently took a fancy to me, getting one over Rick, and never noticed someone was watching, much less stealing from him.

But now, I have to deal with a screw-up from Extermination. Unbelievable. They can rip the head off a grown man, yet act like children with a toy. Overdosed maniacs, the lot of them.

Somehow, a rat slipped through. The cleaning team is throwing a fit. Apparently, it tried to bite a cleaner before sprouting two legs and running.

The rat came into contact with the local sheriff‚Äôs office, which complicates things a bit. When it involves only a household, we can leave it empty. But if it involves an office or worksite, we need to expend personnel to take over temporarily until we can pass it off to the ones working with us outside the business.

Finally, using the Removal department‚Äôs tools, I coordinated the documents, the field agents, and the Extermination team. Everything was patched. Once the cleaners finish, the heads can set up substitutes to take over the office identities.

Next, I need to settle things with Rick and the cleaning department before they charge into Extermination and start another fist fight. I popped a pill from my pocket and then another, just in case things got messy like last time.

Sometimes I wonder what the old me would think if he saw this. I already know. He would put a bullet in my skull. Maybe he would be right. But the work does not stop. Not here. Not ever.¬†",1,1755936093.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

You start off curbstomping and enslaving the wholesome uwu Historians and weirdo Four Father tribals, and continue your endless economy of conquest. Don‚Äôt bother building civs or infrastructure, spam mils and keep justifying, you should NEVER be at peace. Almost every interesting nation has an intended enemy, your main counter and ‚Äúfinal boss‚Äù. Standing Rock has essentially none.

* The Marshall Republic? Never declares war on you if you want to ignore their crappy infantry spam, I literally left them for second last to kill.
* Hayman? Blitz around their power armour with their cavalry.
* Brotherhood/Enclave? Bleed themselves dry in WW1 stalemates.
* Roach King/Vault 37? Bleed themselves dry in WW1 stalemates.
* Bismark? Bleed themselves dry in WW1 stalemates.

All your regional unifier threats? You can blitz them before they ever build up.

Nebraska? Stuck in an eternal battle royale

Northern Colorado? Too weak from their 3 way war

All of Canada? Tag team the weak, backstab the strong

All of Colorado and New Mexico? Tag team Lanius, then cleanup your ‚Äúallies‚Äù

Heaven‚Äôs Gate? Tag team with reformers/anointed, then blitz them

All of Utah? Tag team with New Canaan/White Legs/Ouroboros then blitz the ‚Äúwinning‚Äù side

And finally you come to the endgame threats, the nations so powerful the devs tried nerfing them with civil wars to give you time to build up.

* Legion/NCR? Hold the lines with infantry/mechanized, use your horses to blitz and encircle, add AA if NCR wins they like to spam CAS
* Texas? By now you got enough buffs to pierce their power armour spam
* Mexico? I wanted a true, proper final boss, so I gave the Coffee boys cores on all of Mexico, gave them 2 decades to build up and maxed out their AI cheated buffs. Robots aren‚Äôt as fun, far less people to kill.

1mxvbj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuietCornerTales/comments/1mxvbj6/the_curious_cat/,The curious cat,"My name‚Äôs Van. I make a living digging into other people‚Äôs secrets, the kind that usually want to stay buried. Lately, though, it feels like the ground‚Äôs shifting under me, and I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm standing on luck or a landmine.

The cops I work with joke I‚Äôve got a horseshoe tucked somewhere unmentionable. Maybe they‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve been at this for years, skirting close calls, walking out of raids without a scratch. But luck has a nasty habit of running out.

That‚Äôs how I ended up neck-deep in a case I should‚Äôve let die. Stubbornness kept me hooked, like a fish on a line. And the line led straight to a small pharmaceutical outfit called Mentis, a company with clean labs, polished lawyers, and whispers of something far dirtier.

The department tore through their offices more than once, but every time the shelves were spotless, the records immaculate, the evidence just out of reach.

According to the briefing, Mentis might be nothing more than a front for a cartel. The suspicion came from one odd detail: they only make a single pill, and it isn‚Äôt sold anywhere. No ads. No prescriptions. Nothing on shelves.

Here‚Äôs the kicker. Despite having no real product, the company never seemed strapped for cash. No investors bailing, no layoffs, no desperate moves to scale up. They‚Äôve kept the lights on for years, tucked neatly into one of the busiest parts of the city.

Red flags everywhere, but every raid came up dry. The cops kicked down doors, checked the books, and tore the place apart. Same result every time: spotless.

That‚Äôs when they pulled me in. They wanted me sniffing around while they kept knocking politely on the front door.

It‚Äôs been almost a month since that briefing, and I‚Äôve got the same to show for it as the cops: nothing. Not a damn thing. It‚Äôs almost laughable.

One time, I sat across from them in a meeting, staring at the table while they asked what I‚Äôd found. I didn‚Äôt answer. Couldn‚Äôt. The silence stretched until it soured, and finally they stood, shook my hand, and thanked me for my ‚Äúservice.‚Äù I did the same, then walked out feeling like a fraud.

Weeks slipped by after that. Still, I couldn‚Äôt let it go. Not out of pride, but something else. The whole case made my skin crawl, like we were all circling the truth without ever touching it.

And every time I heard there was no news, that itch came back, digging in deeper. Like the story wasn‚Äôt finished, and I was the only one who knew it.

So, I started from scratch. Did some thinking. One thing we never touched was the most obvious question: who was actually getting the pill, and what was it?

Looking back, it was a glaring oversight. We had never dug into that angle. Not cautious. Just sloppy.

Every search we ran was based on the idea that the pill was a front, a distraction from whatever they were really up to. I wanted to slap myself for missing the obvious. My job was to think outside the box, and I‚Äôd failed.

Tracking deliveries wasn‚Äôt hard. I followed one shipment, and it led me to a plain office building, the kind that blends in with everything around it. Nothing shady, nothing flashy, just four walls and a sign that read *ECR Services*.

But when I checked the records, the company wasn‚Äôt there. No licenses. No filings. No trace of it ever existing. Just a name on a door, sitting in plain sight.

Online searches turned up nothing, but I knew I had stumbled onto a lead. I kept it quiet. If Mentis caught wind, they would bury me. It was a legal nightmare waiting to happen, and I was standing in the middle of it.

I wandered into the caf√© next door, a cozy little place, and struck up a conversation with the staff. That was when I learned something odd. The office was supposed to be a cleaning company. Except when the caf√© tried to hire them, they were told no. The cleaners only worked for private clients.

That set off alarms. The setup felt too familiar, almost identical to Mentis. No public-facing business, no clear revenue, yet somehow still afloat. Maybe they had wealthy clients tucked away, but that did not explain everything.

And then there were the pills. What business does a cleaning service have with pharmaceuticals? The more I thought about it, the less it made sense.

I needed answers, and I needed them fast. Which meant doing something risky.

In this line of work, taking risks becomes routine. This time, the risk was slipping into the building when most of the staff had stepped out.

I noticed a few heading down a side stairwell toward the basement, which left only two upstairs, easy to spot through the windows. That was my chance.

I eased through an unlocked window, heart hammering, and dropped into a plain office. On the desk sat rows of pills, lined up neat as candy.

I scanned the bottles until I found one nearly empty. I pocketed it and slipped back out the same way I came in, careful to leave no sound behind.

Outside, I counted my prize. Three pills in total.

I went home that night and weighed my options. After a while, I had to admit the truth: I had no idea what to do with the pills. Handing them over to the police would land me in trouble, and I didn‚Äôt know anyone who could analyze them.

That left me with only one option. Try them myself.

Earlier that evening, while I was waiting for a chance to slip inside, I had overheard a conversation. An older man was talking with someone who looked out of place, a rookie type who carried himself like he didn‚Äôt belong.

From the bits I caught, the pills were used to dull disgust and deaden smell.

Holding the pills in my hands, I couldn‚Äôt think of any medicine that worked like that. Maybe a strong sedative, maybe some hallucinogen, but the men I saw earlier had looked fine after taking them. So it had to be safe.

Even so, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to try one. Not yet. I slipped them into the inner pocket of my jacket, placing them inside a small plastic bag, and left it at that.

For the next few days, I kept watch on the ECR building. Sometimes I sat on a bench, other times I leaned against a wall or killed time in the caf√© next door. I made sure never to linger in the same spot twice.

And still, nothing. Their routine never changed. Jobs are spaced out every couple of days. They left separately in cars, all wearing the same uniform, and came back looking filthy.

But there was something odd about the way they returned. Something I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on.

The dirt on their clothes was always dark, with a reddish tint. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the thought that it might be blood would not leave me.

Eventually, I decided to take another risk. That morning, I bumped into the younger man I had noticed before and slipped a small listening device onto him.

Later, I caught part of their conversation and pulled a location from it. I rented a car and drove there ahead of them, but the closer I got, the tighter the knot in my stomach grew. Maybe it was the air, maybe the neighborhood itself, but something felt wrong.

The streets grew emptier the farther I went. In an area like this, the silence was unnatural. Then I saw it. A truck parked in front of a house with the ECR logo I had come to recognize.

Out front sat a heap of cleaning supplies, confirmation that I was in the right place.

I parked a few blocks away and continued on foot. The closer I got, the heavier the hesitation grew, like every part of me was begging to turn back. I could not explain it, but I ignored the warning. Curiosity burned hotter with every step.

Seconds later, I was standing at the door. What happened after that is something I will regret for the rest of my life.

The door creaked open, and the stench hit me at once. Rotting flesh, human waste, and the sharp tang of blood. My stomach lurched.

For a moment, I almost ran, but I forced myself to look inside. Blood smeared across the walls and floors. Furniture smashed. The place was a ruin.

But the mess was not what held me. In the middle of the living room lay two bags. From one of them, a head jutted out, the eyes dull and empty, stripped of all life.

I bolted. Out the door, down the street, into my car. I did not stop until I reached the police station, stumbling inside before I could even catch my breath.

Everything was a blur. By the time I heard anything, evening had already settled in. I sat in the police station, counting the minutes, replaying the images in my head. Half an hour passed before someone tapped me on the shoulder.

What they said stunned me. They asked if I was sure of the place, if I was certain about what I saw. I just stared. Then they showed me a photo.

It was the same house. Same walls, same windows. But there were no stains, no broken furniture, no chaos. The home looked untouched, even newly refurbished.

I stared at the picture, refusing to believe my eyes.

The next moment, I was in the back of a cruiser, escorted by an officer I knew. On the drive, he kept asking if I was alright, if I had slept, and if I was under the influence of anything. I could tell he meant well, but I stayed silent.

I needed to see it for myself. I knew what I had seen.

But reality told me otherwise. I stood again on the same doorstep, opened the same door, and walked the same hallway. The living room was spotless. Every detail mocked me, each scene slapping me with doubt, my stomach sinking with every step.

By the time I came to my senses, I was being escorted out and driven home. They must have decided I was finished for the day, that I had finally lost it.

But I cannot accept what I saw. I just can‚Äôt. Yet here I am, left with nothing but the memory.

The days blurred together. I locked myself inside my house, sinking deeper into a spiral I could not pull out of. Friends came by, and a few officers I was close to checked in, but none of them could shake me loose from whatever they thought had rattled me.

Some blamed stress. Others said I must have seen wrong. I even caught whispers of drugs. They kept guessing, never once believing my words.

One day, for reasons I still cannot explain, my mind turned to the pills. At first, it was just a thought, but once it surfaced, it refused to fade.

Even in my sleep, it haunted me. In dreams, the pills were always there, like an obsession I could not figure out.

And then there were the cleaners. Their faces when they came back from a job, drained yet calm, like it was all routine. By the next day, they carried on as if nothing had happened. But no normal human could act that way.

They could not all be psychopaths. That was impossible. In the past, I looked into the young man, Howell. Fresh graduate, good family, good record, by all accounts a decent person. I could not believe someone like that could face horrors every day and treat it like a job.

If my suspicions were right, the pills were the reason.

I pulled one out, a green capsule, and rolled it in my hand. After a moment's hesitation, I tossed it into my mouth.

Sleep hit me fast; I was too exhausted to even notice the transition. When I opened my eyes again, night had already fallen. I had slept through the entire day, yet somehow felt calm and refreshed.

Then the phone rang, yanking me back to reality. This early? I thought, squinting at the clock. It was the station, and judging by the multiple missed calls, they'd been trying to reach me for a while. Apparently, they needed me for a case that required my expertise.

After everything that had happened, I would have refused, and I had, so many times when they'd tried to bring me back. But this time, for reasons I couldn't explain, a strange eagerness pushed me to get back in the game.

I showered and enjoyed it for the first time in days, then made coffee and something closer to a late-night snack than breakfast. Looking at the clock, I realized it was very early morning, that liminal hour when night bleeds into dawn.

At the station, they briefed me and said it was good to have me back. That was when I saw Agent Reese and, to my surprise, the young man from ECR. They had been questioning him since the afternoon.

Now they were letting him go. Reese‚Äôs voice was calm, far too calm for my liking. I knew that tone. She only used it when she was angry.

I volunteered to escort the young man out. While he was distracted, I slipped his ID from his pocket. The ECR logo stood out on the card. Easy to take, and maybe useful later, I told myself.

I went back inside and got the gist from the other officers. They said they had found Howell in a room torn apart; the walls painted with blood. But when they showed me the photo, I saw only a mess of chemical spills and scattered junk, nothing close to what they described. I thought about speaking up, but then I heard Agent Reese losing it in the background and decided I did not want to be her next target.

There was also the matter of the uniform they returned. They claimed it had been smeared in blood, but when I escorted Howell out earlier, it was only dirty. None of the dark stains I had seen on the others when they came back from jobs before. Strange.

The work here was winding down, so I stepped outside. That was when I spotted a truck with the ECR logo parked across the street. What was it doing here?

Before I could think, a scream cut through the air. I turned and saw Agent Reese charging toward me through the glass doors.

She was almost through the door when something unseen tore her apart. One moment she was sprinting, the next she was split clean in half, like some grotesque effect come to life. Except the blood wasn‚Äôt blood. It splattered, writhed for a moment, then collapsed into a heap of dead rats. Dozens of them, limp and stinking, strewn across the floor.

From the pile stepped a man in a spotless white suit marked with the ECR logo. A mask hid his face, leaving only his eyes. In his hand gleamed a blade dripping with a yellowish ooze, thick and toxic like chemical waste.

The figure pushed the door open, and in the blink of an eye, he was standing right in front of me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Van, right?‚Äù His tone was light, almost warm, as though we were meeting over coffee instead of standing in the middle of carnage.

‚ÄúYeah, I am.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what compelled me to answer, but the words slipped out smoother than they should have, considering what I had just witnessed.

He nodded as if pleased. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be finishing up here soon, and we‚Äôd like you to come with us,‚Äù he said casually. ‚ÄúThe Removal Department would like a word with you. Specifically, about the pills you took. And don‚Äôt bother denying it. We know you have them.‚Äù

I could only stare at the man, but he went on.  
‚ÄúAnd after your meeting, I‚Äôd like to propose a job opportunity. I promise it pays better than whatever you‚Äôre doing here.‚Äù

I would have run, but the man placed his hand on my shoulder. His palm was smeared with yellow stains and grit, and the moment it touched me my body betrayed me. I froze, rooted to the spot, unable to move as his eyes locked on mine.

Then a voice called from behind.

‚ÄúBoss, I bagged the rats,‚Äù one of the ECR men said in a disturbingly cheerful tone, his pristine white overalls untouched by the filth around us. With unnatural strength, he swung the bag onto the roof, then let out a sharp, unsettling cackle.

The man in front of me chuckled. ‚ÄúAh, it seems our job is done. I would‚Äôve loved to see Rick and the others‚Äô faces when they found our little parting gift, but‚Ä¶ maybe another time.‚Äù He raised his palm toward me. ‚ÄúThe ID. Give it.‚Äù

Before I could even protest, my body moved on its own. The card was already in his hand.

He released me, and for a moment I thought I could run. But deep down, I knew it would be useless.

His laugh came low at first, then swelled into something manic, echoing in the night. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

I finally snapped out of it. I was about to turn and bolt when a hand clamped over my head. My body locked up instantly, every muscle refusing to move.

With his free hand, the man slipped something from my pocket. The pill. He popped one out and shoved it between my lips. I tried to spit, but his fingers pushed it down my throat. I gagged on it, tasting not the capsule but the bitter tang of stale blood, and I knew it had to be from Agent Reese.

Then, without warning, I was dragged to the truck. The space inside was cramped, pressed in by two others dressed in the same pristine outfit as the man before. The doors slammed shut, and the world outside disappeared.

It‚Äôs been a year at most since that night. I‚Äôm still learning the ropes. Thankfully, I wasn‚Äôt sent to Extermination, though even working in Removal is no easy task.

One of the higher-ups apparently took a fancy to me, getting one over Rick, and never noticed someone was watching, much less stealing from him.

But now, I have to deal with a screw-up from Extermination. Unbelievable. They can rip the head off a grown man, yet act like children with a toy. Overdosed maniacs, the lot of them.

Somehow, a rat slipped through. The cleaning team is throwing a fit. Apparently, it tried to bite a cleaner before sprouting two legs and running.

The rat came into contact with the local sheriff‚Äôs office, which complicates things a bit. When it involves only a household, we can leave it empty. But if it involves an office or worksite, we need to expend personnel to take over temporarily until we can pass it off to the ones working with us outside the business.

Finally, using the Removal department‚Äôs tools, I coordinated the documents, the field agents, and the Extermination team. Everything was patched. Once the cleaners finish, the heads can set up substitutes to take over the office identities.

Next, I need to settle things with Rick and the cleaning department before they charge into Extermination and start another fist fight. I popped a pill from my pocket and then another, just in case things got messy like last time.

Sometimes I wonder what the old me would think if he saw this. I already know. He would put a bullet in my skull. Maybe he would be right. But the work does not stop. Not here. Not ever.",1,1755935232.0,QuietCornerTales,1,1.0,False

We been together two years, we‚Äôre FWB for about four years and knew each other for almost 18 years as mutual friends of a friend. One morning he woke up around 6am while I slept in. When I finally woke up he decided to come back to bed. Before I got up he started shoving me and said I should get out of bed so he could have it to himself. I thought it was him playing around so I brushed it off as playful. 

I then got out of bed and headed to the kitchen to prepare myself coffee while he stood in the bedroom. After I finished making my coffee in the kitchen I left the light on, because there was still coffee on the counter and I planned to come back. I headed back to the room with my coffee and a book to smoke since the room is where we stick to smoking. It‚Äôs not abnormal for us to smoke while the other one is asleep since we have both done it before with no issues. While I‚Äôm standing by the window reading, smoking and drinking my coffee he makes a remark about how I am smoking another man‚Äôs weed while he sleeps. I once again take this as ‚Äúplayful‚Äù because this has never been an issue before, but I also said I brought my own already rolled and it was a strain he made clear he didn‚Äôt like hence why I‚Äôm smoking it alone. 

He makes no remark and continued to lay down but the next thing he said a few minutes later was about providing a ‚Äúspecial favor to him‚Äù, but at the time my back was hurting since I woke up which I stated to him so I was not in the mood. His reply to this was ‚Äúone does not have to affect the other‚Äù and I was annoyed at this point but I brushed it off and said ‚Äúnot while I‚Äôm feeling this uncomfortable, but you welcome to give me a massage later after you get up of course and are ready‚Äù. At that moment he sucks his teeth, throws the blanket off himself and walks right up to me and grabs me to try and stretch my back by picking me up. I at first tried to stop him and said ‚Äúyou can do it later you don‚Äôt need to do it now and be so aggressive‚Äù but he continued anyway I said just come here and I let him. I thanked them, even though he was kind of rough and he walked away to go to the bathroom. 

When he cameÔøº back he asked ‚ÄúLet me ask you something? Do you pay electricity in this house?‚Äù Which I replied no and he continued ‚ÄúOh then why did you leave the kitchen light on?‚Äù I told him how I was in the kitchen making coffee and there was still some left and I planned on going back. He replied ‚ÄúBut you did not go back you been in here a while and the light has been on‚Äù I‚Äôm still not taking him serious at this point because there‚Äôs no reason for me to be spoken to this way unless he‚Äôs joking around but I apologized and said I will turn it off and he said thanks I appreciate that but then I asked did you turn off the light? He then looked at me wide eyed and moved his face a little closer to me and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs crazyÔøº you asking me that, right now. No I didn‚Äôt turn off the light‚Äù and then continued to mumble under his breath about how crazy it was for me to ask if he turned off the light. 

Then as I am getting ready to take my coffee and book to the kitchen to turn off the light he asks next ‚Äúwhere is my breakfast?‚Äù Which I said ‚ÄúBreakfast? There is nothing to cook‚Äù (keep in mind I do not live with him this is his place) to which he says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs crazy since when we need food in the fridge to have breakfast?‚Äù To this I knew he was referring to take out so I said ‚Äúyou were laying down and went back to sleep I am not going to order in without knowing what you want. You don‚Äôt even have breakfast for me ready when I wake up without me telling you what I want‚Äù and he says that‚Äôs just crazy and continues to lay back in the bed. 

I thought he was going to try to go back to sleep so I leave the room head to the living room and continue to read. I‚Äôm in the living room by myself for a while probably an hour and he has not come to the living room. I am getting hungry at this point and I hear him on his phone listening to social media reels so I go in to ask about breakfast since it sounds like he is officially up. When I go into the room I sat on the bed and he is on his phone laying down. I asked what he wants to eat and he did not reply only continued to browse his phone. I asked again, but no answer and then I continued to say his name to which he continued to ignore me and stay on his phone. 

Only after saying his name several times and then shoving him he looked up at me and asked can I help you. At this point I don‚Äôt know if he is joking or not so I laugh it off and say why are you ignoring me I‚Äôm asking you a question. To which he said ‚Äúyou want to come in and ask about breakfast now when I brought it up to you earlier‚Äù. I said yes so what do you want and he laughs and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs crazy you asking me what I want let‚Äôs be real here you know I can go without breakfast I‚Äôm fine not eating but you the one that needs to eat‚Äù. I said back to him I‚Äôm not going to order alone just for me. He knows I do not like to order out and eat by myself when I am with him it feels weird and I like when we eat together. So he then said ‚Äúooooooo so it‚Äôs not about me eating it‚Äôs about you. You don‚Äôt want to eat alone so Hmm it‚Äôs really about you eating‚Äù at this point I asked why are you being difficult and he points to himself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm difficult?‚Äù And I said yes you are purposely being difficult and not answering my questions. 

That‚Äôs when he went on to said Ôøº ‚Äúlet‚Äôs be for real here (said my name) I‚Äôm not the difficult one here‚Äù and he continued on to say that he is not difficult when it comes to food. He said he could eat anywhere with no problem it doesn‚Äôt matter, but me on the other hand I won‚Äôt eat a lot of things so it doesn‚Äôt matter what he wants to eat because in the end it‚Äôs only about what I want. Yet he also adds that even if I eat where he wants I am limited to what I pick and would say let‚Äôs eat somewhere else the next day. Then he continued to say I never give him a straight answer because I never know what I want and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs be f**king for real here you want to say I‚Äôm being difficult but in all real f**king reality it‚Äôs you who is the difficult one here‚Äù. 

At this point I‚Äôm hurt and trying not to cry so I‚Äôm holding back tears and I apologized that I am difficult when picking a place to eat but what I do is not on purpose it‚Äôs just me when it comes to food, and I asked if he is purposely being difficult about picking a place to teach me a lesson or something and see how he feels. He stated if that‚Äôs how I want to take it and I told him okay fine I won‚Äôt ask you what you want next time and I will just pick the place since you said it is what I want anyway. He looked at me and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what you took from what I said?‚Äù Which I said yes you just sat here and said that I am a difficult person to you when it comes to eating and that you limit yourself to what I want so obviously you saying not to ask you and just do it. He said okay if that‚Äôs how you want to put it fine yes. 

So I placed the order and say it will be here at such time and then he asked ‚Äúlet me ask you something how did we get here?‚Äù And I didn‚Äôt know what he was referring to so I asked what do you mean and he said ‚Äúokay we were just laughing one moment and now we‚Äôre not anymore how did we get here? We aren‚Äôt laughing anymore‚Äú and I said because it‚Äôs not funny. You sat there and pointed out a problem you had with me and said you found me difficult and expressed how you felt about me there is nothing funny about that. So he said ‚ÄúSo you going to act different now? Because the way you put that you make it seem like I‚Äôm the mean one here for saying what I said even if it is true and now you going to be mad‚Äù so I replied I‚Äôm not mad but there is nothing funny about this. So he said fine okay and stood quiet so I excused myself back into the living room where I cried alone. 

He never came out to the living room to join me and normally we smoke together but at that moment he smoked alone without me and never said anything further nor came out to me. After the food came I put the food by him in the room which he never left to come eat with me. I stood by myself for over an hour upset so at this point I decided to leave and go back home. I was suppose to stay till Tuesday but I was so hurt at this point I wanted to leave and it was Sunday. I started getting dressed and he asked am I going out and I said I‚Äôm¬†going home to which is he asked why and I said because I feel like being home. He only said okay after that and said nothing else to me as I packed. When I was done I told him I‚Äôm leaving and he asked did I order a cab and I said no. 

He tried to stop me at the door and said now this is to much you have your PlayStation you need to take a cab but I refused him and said I‚Äôm fine I don‚Äôt want a cab. He didn‚Äôt say anything after that and then proceeded to step to the side and stood with his hands crossed in front of him and watched me. I opened the door gave him a light kiss said I love you I‚Äôll text you when I get home to which he said love you back and I left. I didn‚Äôt text him when I got home but he reached out to ask if I got home and I replied. The last text I received from him was a goodnight that Sunday and it is now Friday and he has not reached out to me. 

We always text throughout the day and he would send a good morning text, so I know the silence is a message from him. These past five days has given me time to think and I don‚Äôt believe he likes me. I been wondering what did I do wrong that day and I can‚Äôt understand it. The only thing I feel is I‚Äôm not wanted and does he even love me anymore? Or did he ever really love me? I don‚Äôt believe I should be the one to reach out first because I know he knows I left because I was hurt. What is he trying to say with his silence? Is my relationship over?

I'm trying to navigate an overwhelming situation. So forgive me if my coffee is too hot for your liking right now. It's the best I can do. 

And me trying to protect certain people seems to be drawing ire from the peanut gallery. And not the fun one with snoopy. The annoying one with people who are way too into someone else's trauma but fails to see the full picture and instead is obsessed with the nudes. 

Did I use Ire right? Fuck. Idk. I'd Google it but fuck google. Bing where you at boo ü•Å

Anyways, sorry that I'm not what you can handle. I wasn't made with sugar and spice and everything nice. My life has been pretty rough the past two years so I've become jaded and increasingly angry and spiteful. So back the fuck off me with your bullshit. No one is here to help me learn or do right from wrong so I'm gonna keep on keeping on until someone gets the bright idea to be a genuine person. 

Or don't be and get too close with that negative ass attitude and don't bitch about the outcome. You can sit cute behind your anonymity all you want. But you can't honestly think you can hold a candle to me rn. 

I'm doctor who in this bitch. I know I've said that about 6 times it's because that's a great line. 

I've learned only what I've been teaching myself. Oh this taught me not to trust anyone, that what I did was okay because others can do it to me, and that people are way more into me than I ever thought humanly possible. It's been a weird experience. Yeah I'm lonely but that's nothing new. Can't hurt my feelings with that. I spent most of my professional career going to work going to the gym and going home. Most of the day just me. So this isn't anything new. People have been mean to me all my life I can handle that too. You want to hurt me? You can't. The very fact that you're trying so hard puts the power in my hand and now that I know what you want I'm never going to give it to you. You should have hit me harder a few months ago then you would have gotten desired results. But I'm all out of tears now bub. 

Big reveal? Not yet. But you know it's coming. And you're starting to get it aren't you? Who am I kidding. You're still so caught up in the illusion you've lost all sense of purpose. This is just a soupy mess. 

You don't know me. And it shows. Stop embarrassing yourself and wrap this mess up before you lose all credibility. Don't end up like me. They'll be bored soon. I've used all my tricks up. Can't keep the attention much longer. 

Anyways. 

You think you know my story? 

Why don't you tell it to me. Tell my story since you're so desperate to reveal how I operate. Because time and again you fail to even get a flinch. 

I keep telling you I can help turn this sinking ship around for you. It's still gonna sink because you chose me as your subject but at least it'll make it back to shore. Not end up like the jaws animatronic ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Okay enough shit talk. 

You're the equivalent of a man behind a curtain. Reveal yourself sham wizard. Cuz wtf. I'm trying to move on with my life while you're stuck living nearly half a year ago. 

Let me do the thing and become better. Or better yet. Kill me in a satisfying way. Do something. Because I'm still bored. And I've got a lot of shit to do and you're standing in the way of much needed healing for a lot of people. Stop this selfish attack and communicate like you should have done from the very fucking beginning. 

Or is ruining someone's life not enough payback for your hurt feelings?",1,1755934320.0,u_AndYetIRemain,0,1.0,False

Honestly, I‚Äôm at a point where I just want to date seriously‚Ä¶ long term and hopefully leading to marriage. 

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No kids.
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size.
- Pleasing to the eyes (your mileage may vary, but so far the reviews are good üòè)

By day, I‚Äôm a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning ü©∫). By night and during my days off, I‚Äôm probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy caf√©, pretending to ‚Äústudy‚Äù but actually people-watching‚Ä¶ or getting lost in a book I picked up from FullyBooked.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it‚Äôs a sacred ritual, and walking around the city with my earphones in, imagining I‚Äôm in the opening scene of a movie. I‚Äôm also a sucker for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they‚Äôre winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely. üíØ 

I‚Äôm also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you‚Äôll see my playful and adventurous side.

What I‚Äôm looking for‚Ä¶
A guy who‚Äôs an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, and can start a conversation that goes beyond ‚Äúhi‚Äù and ‚Äúhello‚Äù. Also, someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you: 
- Are well-groomed, carry yourself confidently 
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a CENOMAR cert when we meet üòÇ)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night caf√©s
- Preferably you‚Äôre in Cebu City / Mandaue City (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives), but I‚Äôm open to LDR if everything clicks.

If this sounds like you‚Ä¶
Send me a DM and tell me: 
- About yourself comprehensively, like the important aspects in your background, current work, and/or long-term goals AND 
- Your go-to coffee order OR
- Your dream road trip destination OR
- The last book you couldn‚Äôt put down

I promise I don‚Äôt bite‚Ä¶ unless you‚Äôre holding the last slice of cheesecake! üòö Type the word cheesecake in your message to show you‚Äôve read until this point.

Will ignore messages na walang ka effort üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Pls lng, may effort naman post ko, hope you‚Äôll reciprocate üòá

1mxv1c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/1mxv1c3/pressure_v_flow_rate/,Pressure V flow rate,"Hello everyone!
Im a second year student and I have a question regarding something I just saw (on phone so formatting might be bad sorry!!)

I was at a 7/11 store getting a $2 coffee and while the espresso was flowing out into my cup, the machine displayed the pressure inside where the espresso is stored (or atleast that's what I'm assuming). 

From a customer service perspective I would have expected it to be the flowrate so you can approximate the amount of coffee you're getting. Is it a maintenance thing where if it goes over or under a certain bar something's wrong? Or is it just a way to convince customers they're not getting ripped off?

This might be really redundant but I'm curious as to why the flow of coffee in this case is measured with bar.

Thanks!

I tried having coffee dates and being conservative last year and all it got me was consistent ghosting and involuntary celibacy. I‚Äôve noticed that my younger friends and co workers have gotten into relationships basically by just having one night stands and hooking up. It‚Äôs all basically Russian roulette at this point- you meet a guy and go out and if there‚Äôs chemistry, you sleep with him and hope that he‚Äôll call you back. If you don‚Äôt, he definitely won‚Äôt call you back, at least through my experience. It just goes against my principles, but speaking to a few male friends, they do expect sex on a first date. I will do anything at this point to stop being chronically single. I remember I did it a few times in my twenties and it did lead to more dates and even a one year relationship.

I recently fell for a girl at my department. It's my first time falling for someone. I studied at all boys institute and I don't even have any close female cousin or friend to seek help. So let me describe the scenario:

She is not super beautiful but very cute. She is decent, good looking and well behaved. A lot of things are common between us. She is from Holy Cross and I am from Notre Dame, we both are maybe 7/10, we have never been into relationships. Since, it's a public engineering institute, the number of females are very less. The competition is also high. But, majority of the boys of our class are like jahangir er meye je 350 takar coffee niye protest korai fb users wife material post share dei oirokom. So, 90% of them are kinda creeping her out with texts or follow requests. On the other hand, I took a different approach. I did not send her a follow request. Rather, one day, I directly talked to her. She was there with another of her female friend. There I started a small convo with her friend then I shifted my conversation to her. I asked casual questions like how's lab going or why did you chose this subject. Overall, it was a good ice breaker. Then again, after 1-2 days, I met her in my department building and this time we did a little chit chat. She could have ignored me as she was with her another female friend getting late for her lab, but yet she talked to me nicely. So, this is the scenario. Kinda pretty sure she understood I am a bit interested in her.

So, what could be the next step? I don't want to creep her out or create a negative impression. Someone guide me through the next steps. Can you ladies tell me how to have a good impression and what guy could to do to present himself as a potential candidate without raising red flags?",4,1755933804.0,Dhaka,3,1.0,False
1mxuxzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1mxuxzu/lets_do_more_than_pray_helping_singles_find/,Let‚Äôs Do More Than Pray: Helping Singles Find Marriage,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about how the church and Christian spaces often handle singles‚Äô struggles with dating and marriage. So many of us are told:

* *‚ÄúWork on yourself.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúGod‚Äôs got this.‚Äù*
* *‚ÄúYour story isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù*

On the surface, these statements sound encouraging. But when you‚Äôre lonely, rejected, or feeling hopeless, they can feel vague, frustrating, or even dismissive. Some of the guys in incel spaces have ended up suicidal because they were told to just ‚Äúfix themselves‚Äù ‚Äî as if their desire for a family and marriage was impossible unless they became perfect.

The truth is: **our desires for marriage and family are God-given, and they‚Äôre good.** Wanting to love, be loved, and build a family is holy work ‚Äî but we shouldn‚Äôt just spiritualize it and wait. The Bible calls us to action. James 2:16 says:

*""If one of you says to them, ‚ÄòGo in peace; keep warm and well fed,‚Äô but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it?""*

If we, as the body of Christ, know of single believers who could be good matches for each other, we shouldn‚Äôt just pray for them ‚Äî we should help them meet. If we have wisdom, time, or resources, we should use them to guide, introduce, and support each other.

I know many here genuinely want to help, and I appreciate that ‚Äî but often the advice ends up being ‚Äúpray and wait.‚Äù I think we can go further and actually help singles take concrete steps toward the marriage God calls them to.

I want to be honest about why I‚Äôm writing this. My longing for marriage and family has been a deep part of my life. It has brought me pain, loneliness, and moments of despair. But it‚Äôs also made me realize something important: even if God fulfills this desire for me someday, it won‚Äôt feel complete if I know many others have been praying, crying, and longing for the same thing without support.

That‚Äôs why I want to help ‚Äî to encourage, guide, and practically assist those who share this desire. Because love isn‚Äôt just about receiving what we want; it‚Äôs about helping others pursue the blessings God has placed on their hearts.

# The Shame of Wanting Marriage

There‚Äôs also a lot of shame around wanting marriage, especially in Christian spaces. Singles worry about looking desperate, selfish, or shallow simply because they desire a spouse and family. That shame is often tied to sin ‚Äî but here‚Äôs the key: **wanting marriage is not a sin.**

God calls many of us to marriage and family. The shame we feel for wanting it is **not from God** ‚Äî it comes from a culture that tells us desire is bad unless it‚Äôs fully ‚Äúselfless‚Äù or ‚Äúspiritualized.‚Äù Wanting a spouse is holy, not shameful. Wanting love, companionship, and the chance to build a family is part of God‚Äôs design for many of us.

We should help singles navigate dating and marriage without shaming them for their desires. Being intentional, pursuing love, and taking steps toward marriage is a reflection of godly love, not desperation.

# Practical Ways to Help Singles

Here are some **tangible steps we can take to support singles**:

1. **Expand their environments** ‚Äì Encourage joining interest-based groups, volunteering, or Christian events where like-minded singles gather.
2. **Teach conversation skills** ‚Äì Practice engaging with others and building confidence in social situations.
3. **Encourage clear, low-stakes invitations** ‚Äì Help someone ask another out for coffee or a walk without pressure.
4. **Support matchmaking** ‚Äì Introduce singles you know who could be compatible. Don‚Äôt be afraid to bridge the gap.
5. **Normalize resilience** ‚Äì Teach that ‚Äúno‚Äù is part of the process, not a judgment on worth.

We can‚Äôt just tell people to pray and wait while sitting by. Marriage and dating involve **faith + action**, and as Christians, we‚Äôre called to love our neighbors as ourselves. Helping someone meet their future spouse isn‚Äôt manipulation or overstepping ‚Äî it‚Äôs living out that love practically.

Let‚Äôs stop only giving platitudes. Let‚Äôs give tangible help, guidance, and encouragement so singles can not just survive but **live fully in the desires God has placed in their hearts**, free from shame and empowered to pursue the calling He has for them.",9,1755933770.0,ChristianDating,7,1.0,False

I call it the OMC strategy (because it‚Äôs nice to treat yourself with half your profit with a casino coffee for your hard work on your breaks or while playing!) 

In live poker, you don‚Äôt have to put in money till it gets to your blind, so you simply just fold everything with the exception of AA and you shove all in when you get them, you will always be +EV with this strategy! It‚Äôs good for a guaranteed $4 in EV every 2-3 hrs (since for this strategy to work you have to leave and rejoin the wait list once it gets to you putting out your bb!) 

It‚Äôs even more +EV when you finally have a bankroll for 2/5, it should only take about 8-10 years from my experience coaching these players at my local retirement homes. unfortunately most of our OMC‚Äôs we coach this strategy don‚Äôt live long enough to make it to 2/5 :( 

(This is why it‚Äôs very important to buy in for the minimum to lower your variance as much as possible so you can make to 2/5) but the rare ones that do make it to 2/5 can double their expected EV to $7/ 2-3 hrs! 

I‚Äôve tried coaching the younger generation this strategy but they are too hooked on YouTube shorts and Tiktoks to have the patience for something like this, it‚Äôs a really shame that people don‚Äôt have the patience for guaranteed +EV poker nowadays.

Edit: I forgot you don‚Äôt get AA everytime you play, however the BBJ you definitely won‚Äôt hit before you die adds EV as well, so you are still good for $4 an hr! ",0,1755933749.0,poker,1,0.33,False

The Los Angeles Rams and Cleveland Browns are set to clash in what promises to be a *highly competitive* preseason finale‚Äîby which I mean a controlled chaos of roster-bubble players trying not to trip over their own cleats while pretending to care about the outcome. Let‚Äôs break down the numbers, news, and why the Cleveland Browns are the sensible pick here, unless you‚Äôre a masochist who enjoys watching tight ends attempt blocking drills.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Browns Are the Smart Bet

The betting lines make this one a lopsided tussle. The Browns are favored by **7.5 to 9 points** across most books, with moneyline odds hovering around **-124 to -125** (implied probability: \~55-56%). The Rams, meanwhile, are a **+415 to +450** underdog (implied probability: \~18-20%), which is about the same chance of me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich.

For context: If the Browns were a toaster, they‚Äôd be the one that also brews coffee and files your taxes. The Rams? A toaster that occasionally sparks, occasionally toasts, and once tried to microwave a burrito. The total is set at **36.5 points**, which feels generous for a preseason game, but makes sense if we assume both teams will trot out a mix of starters (Browns) and developmental players (Rams) trying to look busy.

### Digesting the News: Rams‚Äô Roster Bubble Drama

The Rams are using this game as an open casting call for their 53-man roster. Key players to watch include:

* **Ferguson**, the first-round tight end, who‚Äôs been told his blocking needs work. Imagine being paid to look like a human wall but instead you‚Äôre just a human ‚Äúmaybe wall, maybe decorative plant.‚Äù
* **Limmer**, a sixth-round offensive lineman who‚Äôs ‚Äústood out‚Äù in the preseason. Congrats, sixth-rounder! You‚Äôve made the *preseason* starting lineup. The regular season is a different beast, but for now, Limmer is the offensive linemen‚Äôs equivalent of a training-wheel bicycle: functional, unexciting, and occas

This episode sets up on how Saijo lost her sound. After performing in front of the live crowd, even though Saijo started off weak, she did unleash herself and brought the sound of hers being known. Just a tip off from Fujitani, she's able to play along well with TENBLANK and finish off the performance strong.

https://preview.redd.it/r48n9t3lmpkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=13ececf13338fd2eaf1e4dff590563808148c620

She's even getting recognition from her bandmate Sakamoto, which previously looked down on her. Sakamoto getting her a mug of her own, making her realized she earns and deserves the spot among TENBLANK.

https://preview.redd.it/f6ltmzyinpkf1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4d3c6c8fa5852443d862e1fcea1c4b1445f1d6b

However, soon enough, personally I think that to catch up with the expectations and pressure, Saijo starts playing off according to what people expects of her instead of playing her own way. 

https://preview.redd.it/l657cr8eopkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a3e53c5a4052d01d39425f403a6528a18ff1ead

Her talent has been recognized, but as this scene where she plays along with Toya depicts how she lost touch with herself by indulging with music Fujitani has made.

https://preview.redd.it/shoxx5synpkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=c360193fb060cb145865b2497eed0424b3f6cb2b

This leads to another perspective where Fujitani is truly a genius where his music pulls people towards him unexpectedly. Sakurai Yukino was seen as someone who sees how beautiful Fujitani's produced music was. From the start she was mesmerized by the music, she may appear off as seducing Fujitani romantically, to me personally it was the heat of the moment of her loving music (further clearly shown in the last episode where Saijo introduces Yukino back performing on stage after the whole conflict was exposed out) and thus being closer to the 'creator' of the music makes sense to her.

https://preview.redd.it/f1kdyndoopkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=192f06af2f03c5143db7cc5416447e012a75447b

Further emphasizing on how Fujitani's music actually brought more people unhappy, the scene where Saijo and Toya eating together and Toya brought up the topic on how Fujitani once quitted music. I personally think, Isagi truly is talented in composing his own music, but the 'The sound of a genius makes ordinary people unhappy' line really depicts how the music produced by the genius Fujitani can be frowned upon due to jealousy and pride. How much the line weights in affecting others, including Saijo, in finding their own sound.

https://preview.redd.it/okarf5dropkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=64ae7248b710b0a789551d09ea69061c3eecca0b

In another scene where Saijo and Sakamoto share a cup of coffee, in which Sakamoto respects Fujitani for having sound of his own but sees him as a rival as Sakamoto realized he's not that much of a talent when being compared to someone like Fujitani. In this scene also shows Sakamoto doesn't understand why such genius would pulled off such a move in forming a band with someone like him.

https://preview.redd.it/m5npwtyjqpkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab6ca6eea0002f5b835c0dc8f462d46d2cc421e1

Part of it I think Fujitani just wanted to keep the precious sound inside of him, that has being resonated by Saijo, going on. As I mentioned in the previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JDorama/comments/1mxt5qp/glass_heart_ep1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), Fujitani lives his life by music. He realized the fact that he has put so much trouble to people around him using his music, and at the same time able to keep some but not all of the listeners of his music happy and yet despite all of that he's still happy.

https://preview.redd.it/ahgd66n5rpkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=04f74f737d03214a7137de7b8487d263afb8e454

Throughout the episode, it has been shown how Fujitani also has many sides and how those sides also brought trouble to people around him. Nevertheless, Takaoka Sho another key person to Fujitani's life truly knows the core of Fujitani is his music. What actually keep Fujitani going is not as much being a genius as others claimed, but what Fujitani actually enjoy within himself throughout his life. However with things happening, i.e. expectations from the listeners of his music and the agency he's working under and conflict with Isagi, making Fujitani being the bad guy who only thinks off his music with great importance and being ignorant towards his surrounding and people.

With the selfish, musical genius image Fujitani has been well-known off, Toya mentions how Fujitani thinks he's handling things but instead he's just wearing himself down. Personally I think this scene also brought out two sides of the story. One thing, this scene was pushing Saijo into seeing how finding your own sound in music doesn't have a proper manual or steps to follow with. Each one with their own struggles and challenges to face with and it wasn't an easy journey at all. It opens Saijo's eyes to see how the genius despite being born with the talent also struggles in making his sound known to the world. Another side is Toya pushing Fujitani into thinking how pushing through such ridiculous ways won't always be getting him everywhere. Toya mocks Fujitani for working again with Isagi who once betrayed him, saying Fujitani has no sense of pride just to make his music known, but to me personally I think Toya was just trying to slap Fujitani into taking care of his image more and getting involved with such person like Isagi won't be getting him to survive in this life.

https://preview.redd.it/87lr2y5uqpkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=f632a5f266fa9d8dedc900cd3ce9d3699aa5be09

With the question being challenged by Fujitani was the final slap for Saijo to truly realizes her own sound comes from within herself. No one can put up with her struggles, no one can replace her.

https://preview.redd.it/xcgvklgtxpkf1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f0ebe058f2c8aac28b84f824b715dce08c928b6

As the song [Crystaline Echo](https://genius.com/Genius-english-translations-tenblank-crystaline-echo-english-translation-lyrics) being introduced in this episode, I think the song perfectly sums up Fujitani's true side as the musical genius.

This girl around my age approached me as I was going down the hall college, and started a convo to ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù with me. She‚Äôs allegedly a business major who graduated recently, and it seemed she was surprised I was actually older than her. She was attempting to find younger people, I guess.  
  
I was already aware that she‚Äôs probably one flavor of our school‚Äôs resident cultists, but had time to burn so I agreed to meet her for one of those coffee chats. She went into the whole thing about financial freedom and not being stuck in a 9-5, etc. Which I was like sure, I can totally see the value in that kinda vibe.  
  
I went in with the intention to ask a lot about herself and how she found her way into her (MLM) business (Nxtgenz, which links to Amway products). Sniffed out how many people were involved in her immediate branch, ~60. I asked about her story: She as a foreign Asian student came to the US at 15, was bullied for it in HS, apparently made a post on Facebook, then her mentor commented on it and got her involved. She says she feels like she can be a better person now, free of judgement, and around people who understand why she needs to hustle (misguided). We went off topic a bit and she even slipped and admitted she wouldn‚Äôt want to do this as her business of choice, she‚Äôd want to run a coffee shop. This made me feel pretty sad about her initial situation, it‚Äôs sounds real plausible it happened and is what made her vulnerable to the MLM.  
  
Now I understand she can be a victim but is also a perpetrator now. I just wonder what would happen if I went back told her no, I don‚Äôt agree with this ‚Äúbusiness model‚Äù but that I‚Äôm open to tell her why. And trickling an idea of ‚Äúthere‚Äôs actually value in working on things other than this.‚Äù Is there a way of deprogramming them?  
  
I‚Äôm aware this is an over the top idea for a stranger who‚Äôs essentially trying to sell me, and as a person I can be empathetic to a fault. I would not spend more time than I can afford on it, I historically easily flip a switch and ghost. I‚Äôm just wondering especially what those who have been in an MLM think.

# The weather of Annapurna Base Camp in September

There‚Äôs nothing more beautiful than the magnificence of Annapurna Base Camp Trek in September. The season makes everything look grand and fantastic with majestic background scenes. At an altitude of 4130 meters, Annapurna Base Camp offers wonderful views with clear and fresh air. September is a season where the amount of rainfall is relatively lower than that of the rainy season. September arrives after the monsoon. So, there are three major weather patterns during September.

# Post-Monsoon weather

If you are trekking in September in the Annapurna Base Camp trek then you can experience the post-monsoon weather. Post monsoon is during the starting of September. There may be slight rainfall and the trail may get wet and slippery. However, the rainfall is not as heavy as that of the rainy season.

# Stable weather

The weather is stable during late September. The monsoon clears out all the dust and dirt making clear and fresh weather for the trek. During this time of the month, the hills and forest look green with the clear blue views of the skies. Also, the panoramic views of all snow-capped mountains are much more visible without any disturbance.

# Pre-winter weather

September is the pre-winter weather at the Annapurna Base Camp Trek. During this time, days are warmer and the temperature is mild. However, at night, the weather gets cold and chilly. Therefore, make sure to carry the necessary warm gear for the night while trekking to Annapurna Base Camp in September.

# The temperature during Annapurna Base Camp in September

Dragging a maximum crowd from all over the world, September has the most pleasant weather with a reassuring temperature that comforts hikers. However, the temperature during the daytime and nighttime is a huge difference in Annapurna Base Camp Trek. At the base camp, September experienced pre-winter weather. At the base camp, late September is much colder than early September. The temperature during the daytime is mild and warm, but nighttime is very cold over there. The temperature in the Annapurna Base Camp ranges from 8-15 degrees in the daytime but the night ranges from-0. Therefore, carry warm gear and clothes to protect yourself from the extreme cold for your Annapurna Base Camp Trek. Also, carry some rain-protected gear if necessary.

# Accommodations during Annapurna Base Camp in September

September comes under a peak season for trekking to the Nepalese Himalayas. So, if you start trekking in early September, there will be less crowd and more ease in finding the tea houses and lodges for accommodation. There are several options for accommodation in September such as,

# 1.Hotel/Lodge Accommodation

Several hotels and lodges provide the best accommodation facilities to the trekkers during September. September, being the starting season for the trek to the Himalayas, you will be provided with a tourist-friendly hotel and lodges that suit your budget. Similarly, one can enjoy several luxuries and deluxe hotels and lodges beyond the basic accommodation facilities. With affordable services, the hotels and lodges provide you the facilities like comfortable beds with a pillow, electric blankets, hot and cold showers, free wifi, and many more.

# 2.Tea house Accommodation

As you trek up to higher altitudes, tea house accommodation will be your shelter. Tea house accommodation is another most popular mode of accommodation, mostly a local form of accommodation that is run by the locals of the Annapurna region. The tea houses are well managed and provide you with all sorts of services and facilities. The teahouse accommodations are not fancy like that of hotels but here you will find warmth and respectful behavior of locals. During September, you will get an opportunity to explore people from several other countries, as it is one of the starting seasons for the trek. The accommodation service in the local teahouse includes a basic wooden bed with a simple mattress, pillow, and a blanket with solar and electric heater shower.

On the other hand, you‚Äôll be provided with a western, attached bathroom with a hot and cold water shower service.

# 3.Camping Accommodation

In late September, the probability of rainfall is comparatively low. So, if you want to add extra fun and adventure to your journey then you can opt for camping accommodation. As tea houses and judges will be full during this season. So, if you want to have time with your crewmates then camping accommodation is more fun. Late September is suitable for camping accommodation as the weather will be clear and suitable. However, this type of accommodation is mostly done by the climber planning to climb Mt Annapurna. Similarly, it is also done in remote areas and regions where there are very few teahouses and other accommodation facilities. Therefore, for camping accommodation, you need to bring warm clothes as the nights will be much colder.

# Meals in Annapurna Base Camp in September

Talking about the food option in the Annapurna base camp trek, you will have various options here. But the number of options gets limited as you trek higher in altitude. The trekkers will have three meals a day during the Base Camp Trek, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The dinner and breakfast will be served by the teahouse where you stay overnight. The guest houses and tea houses are run by the locals so, they will serve you some local dishes and most of the foods include the flour product. You can also eat some famous international cuisine too. Most of the tea houses have the same menus.

The food menu includes pancakes, fried rice, pasta, yak cheese, beans, Dal Bhat, Momo. Try to have a balanced diet food that can provide you with sufficient energy for the trek. To stay hydrated during the trek it is necessary to drink at least 4- 5 liters of water. Keep your distance from alcohol while you are trekking to a higher altitude. Consuming alcohol can dehydrate your body and increase the risks of altitude sickness. You can also enjoy beverages such as tea, coffee, mineral water, hot lemon, etc.

Most of the people are Tamangs, Gurungs. However, you will also see people of other ethnicities. While trekking through their settlements, you will have chances to interact with them. This way, you can also know about their beautiful traditions, rituals, and cultures. Also, during your trek, you get to interact with other trekkers from different countries and share life stories at the dinner table and lodges.

# Season of Festivals

September is a season for celebration in Nepalese society. Various festivals fall in September like Teej, Dashain. etc. September is a time in Nepal with all the big festivals on the doorstep. It‚Äôs the moment when the entire country is in a mood for celebration. The whole country will be filled with lights and colors during these festivals. During September, the visitors will get a slight taste of typical Nepalese celebrations and festivals. September not only lets you witness the magnificent view but also offers you the essence of culture and tradition.

# Clear mountain view

During their trek to the base camp of the Himalayas, every trekker prefers to have a close view of magnificent peaks without any disturbance or fog. Yes, September is the month when you can enjoy the view brilliantly. September offers trekkers a clear and striking view of the snow-capped peaks. The view is so astonishing that the trekkers want to soak in the beauty of nature. With a very less probability of rainfall, September makes your journey more comfortable and easier.

# Preparations and Essential Requirements

Trekking to a high altitude is as tough as one may imagine. It takes several days of planning and preparation to get ready for the trek. For the successful completion of the trek, the trekkers need to prepare their bodies well for the rough and tough trail that the true offers. Trekkers need simple preparation before starting a trek to any high altitude.

# Physical Preparation

Without physical wellness and preparation, it is almost impossible to trek to a higher altitude. As the base camp of Annapurna lies at an altitude of 4130m your trail will be filled with various ascend and descend. You need to walk for an average of 6-7hours per day through rough trails. And anybody without physical fitness and wellness finds it hard to do so. So, to overcome such problems, maintain your physical stamina by engaging yourself in a light workout at least a month or weeks before the trek. One can start with light workouts such as jogging and gym classes to squats and high planks. Besides, Cycling and walking to remote areas can be helpful as well.

# Mental Strength

Considering this trek as a moderate level, many trekkers ignore the mental strength needed for the trek. Like physical strength and stamina, it is equally important that a trekker is as good with the mental strength to put up with the hike. For a higher altitude trek, Altitude sickness becomes a real problem after 2500 meters altitude. You need to be mentally prepared that you may be caught by some of the symptoms of altitude like fatigue, slight headache. At that time don‚Äôt panic. Resting for some time makes you healthy and energetic. However, if the symptoms worsen you must stop the trek. Besides, you also need to be prepared to hike for 6-7hours a day without or few great days.

# Difficulties of Annapurna Base Camp in September

# Wet Trails in Early September

Monsoon ends in August however sometimes, the monsoon continues until September. Generally, the trekkers may experience light rainfall in the first half of September. Due to this, the trekking trail might get slippery and wet and can create difficulty in trekking.

# Difficulty in Finding Accommodation in Late September

Autumn is the peak season for trekking in Nepal and September lies in Autumn. Early September is a starting season for trekking so, there will not be many trekkers, and finding accommodation is not that much of a big deal. However, from mid-September, the number of trekkers increases, and lots of tourists from around the world flood to the Annapurna region for trekking at this time. But the number of teahouses en the Annapurna trek route is constant. So, due to limited accommodation options, you might have difficulty finding places to stay.

# Colder Nights

The days are warmer in September however the nights are much colder. Temperatures at nightfall below 0 degrees. Most of the tea houses are run by locals, so it is similar to their own houses. Even though they will provide you with a proper blanket and warmth, the rooms in the teahouses do not have proper insulation. So, you might feel cold. Therefore, carrying your sleeping might be proper.

# Rugged and Remote Trials

The roads are rugged and remote and if it is your first time trekking into the remote trails, this trek might be slightly difficult for you. The trail is rocky and highly remote. There are lots of ups and downs that you have to do in a single day. Also, stone stairs make most of the trekking trail.

# Altitude Sickness

At an altitude above 2500m, there is a chance of altitude sickness. The Base Camp sits at an altitude of 4130 meters, it is very likely that some will suffer from altitude sickness due to sudden temperature changes. As you trek up higher, the level of oxygen decreases causing altitude sickness. Thus, you get ideas on the symptoms, causes, precautions, and preventive measures of altitude sickness.

1mxukvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mxukvb/repost_can_i_sue_my_dentist_for_malpractice/,Repost: can I sue my dentist for malpractice?,"I went to the dentist in May, 8 months after my last cleaning due to having to move to a different dentist. At that appointment they had said I had 10 cavities across my mouth and made me schedule 3 appointments. They led me to believe I don‚Äôt take care of my teeth properly and they even gave me a prescription toothpaste. (Mind you, my last appointment I had 0) Well, after my first 2 appointments, my third one came. The first two appointments I had the same dental hygienist, but my third appointment I had a different one. The different hygienist had to file down areas that the first hygienist didn‚Äôt properly file, and they even had to redo a filling from the second appointment. Fast forward to today, I was taking a drink of my coffee when I felt some sensitive pain where my filling from the first appointment was done. (They only did one and put medication on two others during the first appointment) then, while I was eating I felt something hard and it looked like a whitish color and it was hard. When I got home and went to get a snack and drink, I felt more pain, checked the mirror and realized my filling was missing and that‚Äôs why I had pain. I have not ate anything hard to cause it to come out either. It literally just fell out and caused me discomfort. Now I have a hole in between my teeth.

also, last time I went to this dentist in 2021(I switched after this)I had a dentist tell me I needed emergency surgery before I‚Äôm 16 or I‚Äôll lose all my teeth. I turn 16 next May and haven‚Äôt lost any (my gum and lip are too attatched somewhere, but other dentists had said it was fine.

location: Ohio

edit: I went back the Wednesday after this post. I asked for the second hygienist (both were certified to do the fillings). I got there around 7:30 am, they opened at 8, but we sat in the lobby area. When I was taken into the room, the hygienist did some examination of the area, saying that there‚Äôs an area she can go into with the tool, so she went and got Dr. J. Dr. J and my mom talked about why I had this treament, minus the front bc those were needed. He said that most were right beside each other and wanted to keep me from having to come back in the future to do the same area + one of the cavities made its way more inside the tooth, which decays faster and he showed us the x-rays. He fixed the filling and while the hygienist was flossing the area to finish it, she said ‚ÄúJust have to floss this area‚Ä¶ \*slight gasp\* the filling right next to it just popped out..‚Äù and I sighed.. lol. She said that she‚Äôll get Dr. J to come drill the hole, which he did, and she finished the filling. I didn‚Äôt leave till about 10:30 am üòî

fast forward to a couple days ago to now. There‚Äôs a filling on my bottom left, prolly my ‚Äúk-9‚Äù tooth I used to call it or the tooth behind it, and it‚Äôs hard to eat on that side because it hurts, but the filling was done last month. My cleaning is in November, but I‚Äôll give this a week to get better before we make a big deal about it.",1,1755932448.0,legaladvice,2,0.67,False
1mxukis,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mxukis/some_men_hate_me_just_because_im_a_fat_woman/,Some men hate me just because I'm a fat woman,"F30 here on a throwaway - sorry. I have a lot of mental issues, like eating disorder, anxiety, depression, low self esteem, and I assume some of my feelings stem from them, not because of the people, but I have no idea how to differ which is which. And just to be clear, all my negative thoughts about my looks are directed only at me, I do not think bad about overweight people in general, just about myself.

Anyway, most of my life I was fat (except about 1 year when I was very deep in my eating disorder), think BMI 40, its 50 now but I'm slowly working on losing weight in  a healthy way (7kg/15lbs lost since June 22!). Only when I was my skinniest and deepest in my ED (BMI 25) I noticed that men are ""nice"" with me. They talked with me, one even asked me on a date (but I refused, because my ED brain translated his offer as ""he is just being nice out of obligation, he actually wants you to refuse"" lmao). They were helpful and attentive, even if I was a total bitch.

Anyway, I am now very fat and not at all attractive. I began a new job, and there are a lot of guys here, compared to my previous one which was mostly women-dominated office. And they are so... dismissive? When we go to get coffees as a group, they do not want to hear what I have to say. When I ask neutral questions to keep a conversation going (for example, once we were talking about this one building in the city and I asked if this guy knows when it was built since he was interested in architecture - it looked like it pained him to answer me). Men roll their eyes and mumble when I engage with them, scowl, they look at me with contempt, or like I was invisible and the wall behind me is way more interesting than what I have to say. I do not get this vibe from women at all so I don't think it's my conversation style that bores them! I have girl friends, they all say I'm a loving, pleasant person, I go to anonymous chatrooms where people of all genders find me funny and nice to talk to, but as soon as it is real life conversation with guys, I get the cold shoulder. And I blame the fact that I am, in fact, not fuckable in their eyes, therefore not worth of their attention or even politeness. I have no idea if this is true, but it seems the only logical explanation, since it wasn't one incident, but everyday occurrence in different social circles.

And believe me, I braced myself for it. I expected very little I‚Äôm not vegetarian, I can eat veggies, but only if they come with meat. food was actually the main reason it took me TWO years to finally sign up. Add to that my sensitive stomach and the fact that I had laparoscopic surgery just five months before the retreat‚Ä¶ you get it. My brain kept making excuses. But somehow, my gut (pun intended) kept telling me: 
‚Äújust do it.‚Äù So, I signed up for my first Vipassana in August 2025.

Before going, I tried searching for videos of the food served here in the Philippines, but nope‚Äînothing really showed up. Mostly I found Indian videos, so I had an idea of portion sizes, but I had no clue what I was really in for.

First breakfast‚Ä¶ wow. I wasn‚Äôt expecting much, honestly. But there it was: bread with two spreads‚Äîpeanut butter (classic) and coconut jam (heavenly). We also had lugaw, oats, coffee, tea, and huge slices of papaya. Naturally, I piled my plate: one slice of bread with peanut butter, another with coconut jam, a bowl of lugaw, black coffee, and two slices of papaya. I was so full I almost didn‚Äôt want to move. Lucky there was a one-hour break before the next meditation sitting, otherwise, I would‚Äôve been a rolling Buddha on the floor.

Lunch was a whole new level. There was rice (white, brown, or a mix), two ulam, and my all-time favorite‚Ä¶ tokwa! One of the dishes that I can‚Äôt stop thinking about was their veg kare-kare with alamang‚Äîit blew my mind. Desserts like brownies and turon would appear occasionally (little gifts from heaven), and fresh cucumber with a tasty sauce was always there. And the drinks!  different fruit juices. Oh, and noodles‚Äîpancit and spaghetti made a surprise appearance, which I honestly did not expect. My tummy was genuinely happy.

Dinner was simple: two fruits and ginger tea. I‚Äôm usually not a ginger tea person, but theirs? Honestly, I ended up loving it. On the second night, they served a big slice of papaya and a whole dragon fruit‚Äîso refreshing and perfect before bedtime.

By day three, my body decided to stage a rebellion. LBM hit me three times, and I‚Äôm pretty sure it was all the papaya. After that, I limited myself to just one slice per meal. Also, their squash soup‚Ä¶ I need that recipe in my life.

Coming home, I noticed changes in the little things. I started drinking all kinds of tea, I made sure vegetables were part of every meal, and I even started eating fruits regularly‚Äîsomething I rarely did before. Meat is still on the menu, but vegetables and fruits now have a permanent spot. I‚Äôm committed to keeping this kind of diet going, and hopefully, it sticks.

But beyond the food, what really stayed with me was how Vipassana teaches you to notice everything‚Äîthe taste of your food, the feeling of fullness, the patience with your own body. It wasn‚Äôt just meditation; it was a lesson in gratitude, discipline, and mindfulness, all served with a side of coconut jam and tokwa. I left with a happy tummy, and a little glow that only comes from finally listening to your instincts.

Question: How is the food at other Vipassana centers around the world? Any surprises like this?

1mxuf87,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1mxuf87/im_starting_to_feel_like_the_1zpresso_zp6_might/,I‚Äôm starting to feel like the 1Zpresso ZP6 might not be for me.,"I‚Äôve been making V60s for several years with a Timemore C2. Along the way, I‚Äôve been lucky (or maybe unlucky) to experience some amazing cups from specialty shops, and I‚Äôve almost never been able to reproduce those same notes at home, even with the exact beans. I‚Äôve experimented with grind size, ratios, water temps, and recipes, and I feel like I‚Äôve reached the best cup I can make with my setup ‚Äî but it‚Äôs still nowhere near the great cups I‚Äôve had out.

After reading a lot online (and here), I decided to bite the bullet and buy a 1Zpresso ZP6 Special. I‚Äôve been using it for about a month now, and wanted to share my thoughts for others and hopefully get some feedback:

	1.	Build quality ‚Äì Absolutely top-notch. This is probably the best-built and most aesthetically pleasing product I‚Äôve ever purchased. Every detail feels well thought out ‚Äî the rubber bottom, the ability to stand without the catch cup, the foldable handle, the finish, even the packaging. Chef‚Äôs kiss.

	2.	Size ‚Äì It‚Äôs way bigger than I expected. Since it grinds a similar amount to the C2, I didn‚Äôt think it would be this large. If you plan to use the included box, I wouldn‚Äôt really consider it portable.

	3.	Unforgiving ‚Äì The grinder makes it much easier to taste the quality and age of beans. And if your brew isn‚Äôt dialed in, you‚Äôre going to taste it. I‚Äôve had some of the harshest cups I‚Äôve ever brewed from beans I normally love ‚Äî without being able to pinpoint what I did wrong.

	4.	Cup quality ‚Äì Yes, it makes a better cup than the C2. But honestly, I don‚Äôt feel the difference is worth the upgrade.

	5.	Clarity ‚Äì This was the part I was most curious (and worried) about. While notes are clearer, it‚Äôs nowhere near ‚Äútea-like.‚Äù That part has been a bit disappointing.

So maybe my expectations were unrealistically high, or maybe the issue is more with my brewing than with the grinder.

For reference, I‚Äôm currently using Lance Hedrick‚Äôs two-pour recipe: 15g coffee, 250ml water at 92¬∞C, grind setting 5.5, bloom for 1 minute with a swirl, then a swirl after the final pour.",2,1755931856.0,pourover,6,0.75,False

Ethan and MC (Francesca Alvarez) are on their way to hunt for Dolores's stuffed frog. This comes after the ""Roped in"" fic ‚Äî Ethan and Francesca warm up to each other.

\---

Even with the sun warming the windows, Ethan‚Äôs car was sleek, clean, and cold. Leather seats, a pristine dashboard, and the faint scent of crisp linen from an air freshener clipped with near-elegant precision to the vent. It was the kind of space that was clear about who exactly it belonged to.¬†

And here, in this space, Francesca was trying *not* to adjust the air vent. Again.¬†

She‚Äôd already done it twice. Fiddled with her bag once. And once more with the seatbelt. The last time, there had been the slightest flicker of movement from Ethan‚Äôs peripheral glance‚Äînot annoyance, not quite‚Äîbut she decided not to risk it. Again.¬†

She snuck another look at him now. He was composed, focused, one hand on the wheel, the other resting loosely near the gearstick. His driving was smooth, effortless.¬†

And still‚Äîsilent.¬†

Francesca fought a grimace.

They‚Äôd burned through the practical questions in five minutes flat.¬†

‚ÄúWhere exactly was her office?‚Äù She‚Äôd asked.¬†

‚ÄúDowntown. Corner of Rowley and 8th.‚Äù

Silence. She‚Äôd tried again. ‚ÄúFire report?‚Äù

‚ÄúUnder investigation.‚Äù

Succinct. Efficient. Ethan had deployed not sentences but information, and not a word more. Francesca wasn‚Äôt sure why she had expected anything different. She shifted in her seat. *Again*. Then stopped herself. But her fingers began drumming against her knee.¬†

What if‚Ä¶ she‚Äôd overstepped?

The thought came sudden. Sharper than expected. It wedged itself under her skin, and wouldn‚Äôt come loose. She hadn‚Äôt exactly asked him, had she? About the frog hunt. She just‚Äîsaid it. Declared it. Like it was obvious. Her fingers drummed faster. Because to her, it had been‚Äîobvious. Dolores needed the frog. Or what it represented. And Ethan was her friend‚Ä¶ right?¬†

Only now, in the quiet of his car, Francesca wasn‚Äôt sure she had given him a real choice. Maybe he didn‚Äôt want to do this. Maybe she‚Äôd boxed him in. Put him in a position where he couldn‚Äôt say no.¬†

Her fingers stopped.¬†

God. What if it was *polite* silence?

Francesca twitched. And adjusted the air vent.¬†

She nearly cringed. Maybe she should say something. Thank him, maybe? Or, apologise? No. That seemed worse. Francesca sifted through the options, trying each one in her head and discarding them all.¬†

And then Ethan‚Äôs hand flexed on the wheel.¬†

Just once.¬†

She stared. Like it might do that again. But it didn‚Äôt have to. The pressure in her chest didn‚Äôt vanish, but it lifted. Enough for her mind to breathe. Maybe she was just imagining it. But that movement‚Äîit felt‚Ä¶ human. Like he was here, too. Francesca thought for a moment, still careful, then she turned her head toward him.¬†

‚ÄúWhat would you have done tonight, if we didn‚Äôt have a frog to hunt?‚Äù¬†

Beside her, Ethan breathed. The sound was measured, but deep. As if he‚Äôd been holding it. He raised an eyebrow, and she saw the flicker of something dry in his expression.¬†

Francesca smiled. There he was.¬†

Her voice came easily now. Light, a little playful. She shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just wondering if world-class attendings have a life. You know. Just to see what it would be like for me in the future.‚Äù¬†

That got her a smirk. And her heart skipped.¬†

‚ÄúWe manage,‚Äù Ethan said, wry.

Francesca gave a faux-thoughtful hum. ‚ÄúIs that code for ‚ÄòWe spend our nights reading case reports and highlighting old cases in *The New England Journal* like an old-timey detective‚Äô?‚Äù¬†

Ethan kept his eyes on the road, though his mouth twitched. ‚ÄúI plead the fifth.‚Äù¬†

Francesca laughed, and the air shifted. Lightened. She leaned back slightly into the seat, her shoulders easing for the first time since they‚Äôd driven out of the parking lot. Outside, the city slipped by in blurred slants of sunlit concrete and glass. She glanced around the car now with some curiosity. Noticed the way everything was precisely where it belonged. No clutter. No idle coffee cups. The radio was off. The air conditioning, low. She wondered if that was how Ethan preferred most things: quiet. Controlled.

The silence between them stretched again, but this time it didn‚Äôt grate. It felt suspended. Like a breath. Not that Francesca was tracking its movements anymore. A thought was occurring to her.¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you think of doctors being friends with their patients?‚Äù she asked. Lightly. Casually. But it wasn‚Äôt nothing.¬†

Ethan didn‚Äôt answer right away. But she saw the glance he gave her, brief and sharp. And then the dry arch of one brow. ‚ÄúIs that a jab or a question?‚Äù 

She snorted, grinning already. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt it be both?‚Äù¬†

A pause followed, which she held, and something softened. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre human,‚Äù he said at last. ‚ÄúSome people get through your defences without asking. Sometimes it matters more to them than you realise.‚Äù

Francesca stared a little. His eyes were still on the road. She nodded slowly, let the quiet sit. It felt warmer now. Less like restraint. More like trust.¬†

‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù Ethan asked. ‚ÄúWhat would you have done tonight?‚Äù¬†

Francesca stilled. She hadn‚Äôt expected the question. *Her* question, returned. It landed in her chest like a held breath‚Äîquiet, steadying. She caught it carefully, kept her voice light.

‚ÄúLeftover spaghetti,‚Äù she said, smiling as she shook her head. ‚ÄúSienna made way too much again. And then maybe a few pages of this diagnostics journal I‚Äôve been obsessed with. It reads like a mystery novel. It‚Äôs ridiculous. I was supposed to go to bed early last night and ended up reading about sarcoidosis until 2 AM.‚Äù

Ethan looked at her then. Deliberate. Sudden. Like he was startled. ‚ÄúThe one with the teal cover?‚Äù

Francesca gasped, twisting in her seat. ‚ÄúYou read it too?‚Äù

He gave a shrug, eyes gleaming as they returned to the road. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs well-written.‚Äù

‚Äú*Well-written*?‚Äù she nearly yelled. ‚ÄúThe one on hepatic granulomas had *plot twists*.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI stand by my assessment.‚Äù

Her huff came out in a laugh. She turned fully now, hands animated. ‚ÄúOkay, but there‚Äôs this one case, um, page 12? The guy presents with fatigue and chest pain, right? So you think maybe it‚Äôs pericarditis or early heart failure or something like that, but *then* there‚Äôs this one lab buried in the middle that throws *everything* off‚Äî‚Äù

He nodded. Once. Firm.¬† ‚ÄúThe elevated eosinophils.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Francesca gushed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even kidding when I say this‚Äîmy jaw *dropped*.‚Äù

Ethan almost, almost smiled. ‚ÄúThat case was a diagnostic nightmare. But have you gotten to the renal panel curveball yet?‚Äù

She froze. Eyes wide. ‚ÄúNo? Why? What happens? Wait, don‚Äôt tell me it‚Äôs renal amyloidosis!‚Äù

Ethan slowed at a red light, opened his mouth‚Äî‚ÄúNo, wait!‚Äù Francesca yelped. ‚ÄúParaneoplastic GN!‚Äù¬†

He turned, mid-breath, the smile caught on his lips.

‚ÄúNo, wait, wait!‚Äù Francesca shot her palms out like she was warding him off. ‚ÄúNo spoilers! Ask me again when I finish reading it.‚Äù

Ethan‚Äôs eyes glinted with something like mischief. A pause. Like he was weighing his options. Or fighting one of them. Then the light turned and he exhaled‚Äîslowly, audibly‚Äîand faced forward again. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to hold you to that, Alvarez.‚Äù

I can see he is not motivated to find a job soon, ofc he must find one to pay rent, food etc from autumn. The actual plan was to go for his superlative degree but seems he can't afford it yet, only a half year later. 
Also, he said that he is not really motivated in mornings to wake up, but ofc when we are together he wakes up, does breakfast etc. I am kinda scared that he may be a little depressed, he overthinks easily and has low self-esteem.

I was inspired by ‚ÄúMy Crew And I Are Stuck On An Abandoned Ship.‚Äù with the author having it take place aboard the rms Queen Elizabeth. What are your guys thoughts and opinions on this, any ways I can improve or if it‚Äôs suitable for nosleep? Thanks for your help!

*The ship that shouldn‚Äôt be.*

The sea is beautiful, but merciless. One moment it cradles you in calm waters; the next, it reminds you how small you really are. I‚Äôve spent most of my life answering its call‚Äîbecause no matter how cruel it gets, the ocean has a way of pulling me back, as if it knows I belong to it.

I‚Äôve seen a lot out there. Some things I can write off as tricks of the light, mirages born from fatigue and salt spray. But other things‚Ä¶ things I still can‚Äôt explain. And none haunt me like the night we saw her.

It was 1985. I was young, eager for adventure, and had no idea the sea could turn so cruel. I was serving aboard the MS Halcyon, a rust-streaked cargo vessel with a crew of fifteen. Nothing glamorous‚Äîjust a dozen tired men passing cigarettes and recycling old jokes to keep the night shift from dragging. I can still hear the scrape of chairs, the hiss of coffee, the faint tang of brine and oil in the air. Sometimes, I even miss it.

The Halcyon wasn‚Äôt much to look at. Her engines sputtered and coughed more than they should, but she was ours. Our captain, Jeffery Cooper, was steady and capable, with a respect for the sea that sometimes looked like fear. We‚Äôd catch him alone at the stern, staring out over the choppy black water, as if listening to something the rest of us couldn‚Äôt hear. Looking back, I think he sensed danger the moment we left port. Still, none of us could have imagined what waited for us.

For a stretch, the voyage was easy. Fair seas, clear skies‚Äîthe kind of weather that fools you into thinking the ocean will always be kind. But that calm never lasts. One night, everything changed.

Bradley McCormick and I were in the galley, talking quietly. He was older, more seasoned, with the grizzled face of a man who‚Äôd seen too much salt and storm. Our conversation had drifted to the sea‚Äôs mysteries‚Äîthe Baychimo, the Ourang Medan, the Carol A. Deering. Ships found drifting, crews vanished without a trace. Idle talk at the time. Later, it felt like a warning.

Our conversation cut off when David Hwang emerged from the radar room, moving quickly but not panicked. His brow was furrowed, and he kept glancing toward the deck as if the horizon itself was shifting. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something out there,‚Äù he said, voice low and taut. ‚ÄúA blip on the radar‚Ä¶ too slow to be a normal ship.‚Äù

We exchanged uneasy glances. No one laughed. Even joking felt wrong, like the sea itself was holding its breath. I stepped toward the doorway with him, peering through the fogged portholes. The horizon was empty‚Ä¶ or so it seemed. Something about the darkness made it feel alive, like it was watching, waiting.

I tried to tell myself it was nothing. Radar glitches, fog, moonlight‚Ä¶ still, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling something about the horizon was off‚Äîtoo long, too silent, too deliberate.

Bradley followed me toward the radar room, hands in his pockets, eyes flicking nervously to the portholes. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs‚Ä¶ off. Makes me think of those old stories‚Ä¶ ships found drifting, crews gone.‚Äù He paused, chewing his cheek. ‚ÄúCall me superstitious, but I don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

I tried to laugh it off. ‚ÄúProbably nothing. We‚Äôll see soon enough.‚Äù

The corridor felt heavier than usual, metal cold beneath our boots. Even as I rationalized, unease settled over the crew. The sea outside was too still, and the horizon seemed to stretch farther than it should.

By the time we reached the radar room, the air felt thick, as if the ship itself was holding its breath. David‚Äôs eyes were fixed on the console. ‚ÄúSee?‚Äù he said, pointing. ‚ÄúIt showed up about ten minutes ago.‚Äù

We leaned over the screen. There it was: a faint, slow-moving blip, miles ahead. My stomach tightened as I followed it, trying to reason it away.

Then, just as suddenly, it vanished.

I let out a small gasp. Bradley‚Äôs eyes narrowed, and even David‚Äôs posture faltered. The screen swept in silence, only the hum of the Halcyon‚Äôs instruments.

‚ÄúWhat was that‚Ä¶?‚Äù I asked, glancing at Bradley.

The radio crackled, spitting out ear-splitting static. I grabbed the edge of the console. Bradley stiffened beside me. The static hissed, then settled just long enough for a faint, garbled voice to whisper through.

‚ÄúHello? This is Halcyon‚Ä¶ do you read?‚Äù I called, voice small in the cramped room.

The static cut off abruptly. Only the engine hum and the slap of waves remained. David muttered, almost under his breath, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs back on the radar‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs closer.‚Äù

We all turned. The blip had reappeared, eerily steady, tracking with us like it had been waiting.

David stayed behind, focused on the console. Bradley and I made our way to the captain‚Äôs cabin. Off in the distance, barely visible through the fog, a dark silhouette loomed. Too large to be a small freighter. My eyes strained for detail‚Äîdeck lines, shadowed superstructure‚Äîbut the shape remained indistinct.

‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt feel right,‚Äù Bradley murmured.

I tried to rationalize it‚Äîperhaps a disabled ship signaling for help‚Äîbut the knot in my stomach refused to loosen.

We reached the captain‚Äôs cabin. Bradley knocked. ‚ÄúCaptain, we‚Äôve spotted a vessel about ten miles off our port side,‚Äù he called out.

Groggy, the captain opened the door, dressed in pajamas, squinting. ‚ÄúA vessel?‚Äù

Bradley quickly explained: ‚ÄúDavid saw a blip on the radar, someone tried to contact us via radio, and now Frank and I have spotted it visually.‚Äù

The captain‚Äôs eyes narrowed as he followed us back to the radar room. David was still trying to establish contact, but the silence was absolute.

‚ÄúNo response?‚Äù the captain asked, glancing between David and the console.

‚ÄúNo, sir. Dead silent,‚Äù David replied, brow furrowed.

‚ÄúMaybe their radio antenna‚Äôs damaged?‚Äù I suggested, trying to push back the dread curling in my gut.

The captain considered, then nodded. ‚ÄúFrank, Bradley‚Äîyou two go on deck and try signaling with the Aldis lamp. David, maintain radio. I‚Äôll wake the rest of the crew; we may need to perform a search and rescue.‚Äù

With that, the three of us left the radar room, tension settling around us like a second, heavier sea.

As soon as Bradley and I stepped onto the deck, the calm, foggy stillness we had noticed earlier had vanished. In its place, the sea had turned violent, thrashing against the Halcyon with a relentless fury. Waves slammed into the hull, rocking us side to side, and the wind whipped icy fingers through our clothes. Bradley exhaled in sharp, shallow breaths as we fumbled with the Aldis lamp.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt normal‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt normal,‚Äù he muttered, voice trembling as the lamp finally clicked on, casting a narrow beam across the darkness.

In that fragile light, the vessel became unmistakable. Closer now, more defined, its enormous silhouette loomed against the rolling waves. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a LASH carrier,‚Äù I whispered, my words barely audible over the storm. The ship‚Äôs sheer size was terrifying, but it was the silence that unnerved me the most‚Äîno lights, no movement, nothing alive on deck.

We signaled for what felt like an eternity, but the ship gave no response. It drifted slowly closer, listing slightly, as if the sea itself had battered it into a weary crawl. I could now see the damage it had sustained‚Äîtwisted metal, mangled cranes, hull scarred as though struck by a colossal wave.

The only sound around us was the storm‚Äôs roar, when a voice cut through it from behind.

‚ÄúBoys!‚Äù The captain‚Äôs voice carried urgency, but also a strange calm. We turned to see him straining to make out the derelict through the rain and fog. ‚ÄúAny luck?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sir,‚Äù I said, keeping my eyes on the ghostly vessel. ‚ÄúIt seems‚Ä¶ abandoned.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù he said, jaw tight, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúThe rest of the crew has been informed. I want us to board her‚Äîsee if we can figure out what‚Äôs happened.‚Äù

Bradley‚Äôs hand tightened around the Aldis lamp. ‚ÄúAre you sure that‚Äôs wise?‚Äù His voice was barely a whisper, eyes locked on the shadowed ship.

The captain didn‚Äôt answer. He only gestured for us to follow as he led the way toward the galley.

Inside, the rest of the crew had gathered, some rubbing sleep from their eyes, others muttering complaints about being woken in the middle of the storm.

‚ÄúAlright, men,‚Äù the captain said, voice firm over the hum of the engines and the lashing rain against the windows. ‚ÄúI need five of you to accompany me in boarding a vessel that appears abandoned. The rest will maintain the Halcyon.‚Äù

Almost nobody moved. The storm outside and the thought of boarding a drifting ship made volunteering feel like suicide.

Something inside me pushed me forward. I raised my hand, chest tight with a mix of fear and determination. ‚ÄúYou can count on me, Cap,‚Äù I said quietly, trying to sound steady.

Bradley followed, his hand hesitating for a moment before lifting. ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt like this,‚Äù he muttered, eyes fixed on the foggy windows, ‚Äúbut you‚Äôre gonna need all the help you can get. I‚Äôll go, too.‚Äù

Then our first mate, Johnny, rose calmly from his seat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll assist you,‚Äù he said, glancing at the rest of the crew.

Finally, Simon, one of the deckhands, spoke up, voice nervous but resolute. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go as well.‚Äù

The captain‚Äôs eyes swept the group. ‚ÄúGood. The rest of you, keep trying to contact anyone using the radio and maintain our position.‚Äù He barked the order, and the remaining crew scattered to their stations.

I glanced at Bradley and Johnny as we stepped toward the deck, the storm lashing rain into our faces, wind tugging at our coats. My stomach tightened, but there was no turning back. With Simon behind us, we began our careful trek toward the railing, ready to face whatever awaited on the shadowed vessel.

Lowering the lifeboat in that storm was unlike anything I had ever experienced. The wind tore at our coats, waves slammed against the small vessel, and every gust threatened to tip us into the dark, churning water. The Halcyon seemed impossibly far above us, its lights barely cutting through the sheets of rain and fog.

Our little boat thrashed violently, tossed like a toy as we inched closer to the shadowed silhouette of the vessel ahead. The captain‚Äôs eyes never left the massive form; it had stopped moving, eerily still in the heart of the raging sea. Its dark hull swallowed the storm‚Äôs light, making it feel impossibly immense and unwelcoming.

‚ÄúPull, lads! Pull!‚Äù Johnny shouted, his voice nearly lost in the scream of the wind and the crash of waves. Each stroke was a battle, the oars churning water that seemed determined to drag us under.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we reached the stern. One of us lifted a flashlight, its beam trembling against the fog and rain. And then I saw it‚Äîetched across the dark, battered metal, a name that sent my stomach twisting: MS M√ºnchen.

I froze. The words were unmistakable, staring back at me like a warning. The ship wasn‚Äôt just abandoned‚Äîit carried the weight of legend, of disappearance, of death at sea. And now, here it was, looming over us, silent, massive, impossible.

The storm‚Äôs fury seemed to quiet for a heartbeat, as if the ocean itself was holding its breath. We were alone with her now, and that silence‚Ä¶ it felt alive.

Once the name hit our eyes, the idea of a ‚Äúsearch and rescue‚Äù crumbled. The captain‚Äôs hand shot to his forehead, gripping it like he could hold back the realization. His voice dropped to a rough whisper, carried away by the wind.

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶‚Äù he muttered, teeth clenched. ‚ÄúShe went missing‚Ä¶ ‚Äô78. No one‚Ä¶ could be aboard.‚Äù

I caught Bradley‚Äôs stare, pale and fixed on the letters. Even Johnny, usually steady, looked away as if acknowledging some unspoken truth. The storm raged around us, but the ship remained utterly still, its hulking form dominating the waves, silent and unyielding. It was as though the sea itself had built this monument for us to find‚Äîand for us alone.

My wife and I(28M) recently moved to Jersey City from NYC and moved to the US last year, so am still getting into the swing of things and have realised life gets pretty boring without friends. So, I thought I come on here and shoot a hail mary and see if this works at all haha.

I've been spending a lot of my time chained to my desk and getting in that terrible work -> home -> work routine and feel like I haven't really explored or taken advantage of what New York and Jersey have to offer!

I am a big foody and mostly spend my time trying to explore as many different coffee shops, food places and museums as possible, I'm reading kitchen confidential right now so that may be partly fuelling the exploration. Also been getting into photography and always looking for some cool places to get some nice shots, really into film cameras but recently got a ricoh griii and loving it. Pretty big into movies and have a huge backlog of movies to see, not proud to say I haven't seen the new Superman yet(apparently they finally got it right). Recently been getting into theatre, seen John Krasinski new play Angry Allan - whole time could not tripping out that Jim Halpert was in front of us. I usually play basketball but tore my ACL and have my surgery coming up in Oct, and will definitely be hitting up some gyms after that.

So thats my pitch, it seems like finding friends is a common issue in Jersey City and NYC so lets work together to solve the problem! üòÇ",0,1755931120.0,jerseycity,1,0.4,False

Hello,

As my title states, I‚Äôm a 25M and I‚Äôve been talking to a 22F for about a little over a month. It started out as me sliding into her DMs and she told me she wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúemotionally available‚Äù. Granted I told her I‚Äôd be still interested in chatting as I could use some more friends. We start chatting and we find out that we are very similar people to the point we both have this same rare stomach condition that I had just been diagnosed with. So needless to say it started out really well. It then went to us texting all day and all night, calling on the phone, FaceTiming, etc. she‚Äôs 2 months fresh out of a long relationship so that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs not on the market or not looking for anything yet. But I know her goals are to date someone to marry and it probably will be in due time. She does mention her ex time to time, but she knows he‚Äôs no good. 

We‚Äôve gotten pretty close, we hung out a week ago. Got coffee and went for a walk on a trail (all her idea). We spoke about how I myself am 25 looking to settle down soon and she says ‚Äúshe‚Äôs sorry, she wishes she could be the person I could settle down with for me‚Äù but since she‚Äôs not looking she‚Äôs not. But she also said that she wouldn‚Äôt just meet with some random guy and take a walk in the woods with just anyone and that she feels safe and comfortable with me.  Now occasionally she jokes about finding me someone or how I will find someone. So keep that in mind. But she does a lot of sending me pictures of her outfits or we will FaceTime and she‚Äôll fish for me to tell her she looks good things like that. All of this to say that things are going very well and nothings going wrong. 

However I do like her and really enjoy talking to her. She said from the get go she wasn‚Äôt on the market, but I‚Äôve also never been in a relationship and have had bad luck talking to people, or maybe I have self sabotaged. So I think what I‚Äôm struggling with is I guess I just can‚Äôt tell how she views me if that makes sense? There‚Äôs a sense of enjoyment of us talking to each other. She‚Äôs really busy with finishing school and working but we FaceTime pretty much every day and it‚Äôs just nice to know I make her laugh and keep her company and vice versa. I have to admit I‚Äôm putting a lot of eggs in her basket and I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs gonna end up in a friend zone but I am also not sure if I‚Äôm just projecting my traumas onto that or if there‚Äôs a legit mutual attraction just right person wrong time atm situation going on. The flirting is light. Bc I don‚Äôt want to pass that initial boundary she made. Like I said if she sends me an outfit or asks me if she looks good, I‚Äôll hype her up and tell her she looks great. Yk things like that. 

I‚Äôm really rambling at this point. I just am a hopeless romantic type and just really want to love. So I kind of just want some thoughts on this situation bc I‚Äôm very on the fence. Some people might say ‚Äújust be honest with her‚Äù but again we have a good thing going and I don‚Äôt want her to think I‚Äôm just here waiting. I did tell her regardless what happens I‚Äôm okay with it so she knows I‚Äôm not waiting. So I‚Äôm here to just get intricate thoughts and perspective from the outside to maybe get myself on a good or rather more level mindset. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long but I really appreciate whoever does take the time to read this.

TLDR; Girl I‚Äôm interested in told me she wasn‚Äôt on the market, we‚Äôve gotten really close over the last month and a half. Gives signs of really being interested in me and talking with me, but can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm a future prospect for her or just a really really really good friend. We spend a lot of time chatting, FaceTiming, and so far one time of seeing each other.

I didn‚Äôt even start staying with him until almost nine years into the relationship and I say *staying* very deliberately, because in his words, ‚Äúyou can stay at my place while you‚Äôre working at the location you're at since my place is closer.‚Äù Not moving in, not building a home together just *staying.*

What really stung was after I lost my job due to budget cuts. He came home one day and told me he resented me for being at home while he‚Äôs at work, because in his mind I can ‚Äúdo whatever I want‚Äù all day. (For context, his job is a desk job, not physically demanding.) He later admitted that ‚Äúresent‚Äù was the wrong word, but the fact that it came out at all made me feel like he doesn‚Äôt respect or appreciate me.

I feel like I‚Äôm not truly seen or appreciated in this relationship. It feels like we are just co-existing and that hurts, because I‚Äôve invested so much time and energy into us. At this point, I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just clinging to something that‚Äôs already over.

And I get that relationships are two-way. I don‚Äôt want this to come off like ‚Äúwhat can he do for me.‚Äù But even back when I was working 70 hours a week, I still made the effort to go to his place to spend time together. He rarely, if ever, came to see me. It‚Äôs always been me going to him, me putting in the effort, and that pattern hasn‚Äôt changed.

AITA for wanting to leave instead of sticking it out in a relationship that feels one-sided, loveless, and more like a roommate situation than a partnership?

**TL;DR**: Long-term relationship feels flat and more like roommates than partners. No intimacy, no effort, no ‚ÄúI love yous,‚Äù and I feel unappreciated despite years of trying. AITA for wanting to leave?",4,1755929819.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,6,1.0,False

For now I‚Äôm testing with some simple and little old coffee from supermarket. In the meanwhile I‚Äôm looking for sites where I can order some nice and fresh coffee beans. I only know a few sites for here in Europe. Square miles from James Hoffmann and Barista essentials. Lots of people talk about coffee bros but I don‚Äôt know if they deliver in Europe. Any suggestions?
Please only sites that deliver in Europe ",1,1755929811.0,espresso,0,1.0,False
