I‚Äôm a woman in my 20s living in Boston and lately I‚Äôve been hoping to meet some genuine, down-to-earth girls to share life with.

Would especially love to connect with other women of color who also love softness, sisterhood, and good vibes-but truly, anyone who‚Äôs kind, intentional, and open to real connection is welcome. Some of my favorite things: cozy movie nights, journaling, bookstore strolls, spa days, plant shopping, and thrift/vintage runs‚Ä¶ Fitness classes?, coffee walks, brunch, exploring new spots in New England and doing random stuff for the plot, faith-centered convos, deep laughs, and romanticizing life through the little things!! üòÆ‚Äçüí®I know that was a lot, but just wanted to drive the point across.

I am three days post-op (HM), and one of the biggest issues I had with achalasia is the regurgitation of whatever I sent down my esophagus.

Is it normal to have the same little bit of regurgitation after like a smoothie or protein shake? I didn't have it the first couple of days but it just kind of started again. 2.

I am currently 13 weeks pregnant and have had the WORST acid reflux. It is at its worst in the mornings when I stand up, and proceeds throughout the morning hours. It stops in the afternoon generally, and then begins again at night. Tums doesn‚Äôt seem to help like it used to. It also doesn‚Äôt help that my pregnancy craving is lemonade, which burns horribly going down. Coffee also burns all the way down my chest.

I also have had a chronic red palatoglossal arch (in front of the tonsils) that I believe could be due to the acid. I have a ton of post nasal drip and mucus in the back of my throat that I just cannot ever clear. I also have an insane amount of saliva that I‚Äôm swallowing (I swallow every 10ish seconds, all day long). I see my OB in a couple days and will mention all this, but also have an ENT appt next week, so Im praying for some answers. 

In the meantime, is it possible that all these symptoms are due to GERD? I‚Äôm also researching LPR. And are there any pregnancy-friendly ways to cope?? This is driving me crazy! Thanks all!

Little lore (also we have the biggest store in our district): at my store I am a closing SSV, my job specifically includes locking up the store when we close, counting money and safe (takes damn near 30 minutes cause my store hardly does middays), dropping tips, gather donations, make sure temps and walk is done, check ims, check fridges and back door, set alarm and leave. 

My baristas break down and clean the bars, break down and clean siren system, burn ice, stock fridges, do ALL backups, wash all dishes, clean out pastry case, clean vertica machine, dump teas and coffee, stock all lids/cups/paper products, wipe down ovens, put all the dishes back, take out ALL trash (we‚Äôre lucky if it gets taken out at midday, and we have 15 trash cans in our store), toss sanitizer towels, clean and stock bathrooms, sweep and mop ENTIRE store (FOH, BOH, cafe, bathrooms). 

90% of the time when I‚Äôm done with money and manager stuff I have to help the baristas close the store because it is a lot to do imo.

1mcfek4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnTech/comments/1mcfek4/evaluate_best_wireless_earbuds_soundcore_liberty/,Evaluate best wireless earbuds Soundcore Liberty 4 NC performance or hype,"Testing out the Soundcore A3947 felt like a technological adventure for me. I've used my fair share of earbuds, but these brought something extra to the table. From their slick design to adaptive noise-canceling features, I sensed that they'd genuinely been engineered with everyday users in mind. However, no product is without its quirks, and these earbuds were no exception.

**Build and Aesthetics**  
The visual appeal of these earbuds is unmistakable. With their pastel pink color, the Soundcore A3947 undoubtedly stands out in a sea of standard black and white options. The rounded tips fit seamlessly into the ear, maintaining a balance between comfort and security. Made from PC+ABS material, they‚Äôre lightweight yet sturdy, giving off a premium vibe without feeling fragile. Personally, I appreciated the compact size of the charging case, which slid into my pocket effortlessly. It's almost astonishing how a device so small packs so much capability.

**Connection and Pairing Settings**  
Getting these wireless earbuds connected was a breeze. Bluetooth 5.3 technology does a lot of heavy lifting here, ensuring both effortless pairing and a robust connection. Whether I paired it with my laptop, phone, or tablet, the setup remained seamless. I even tested the multi-point connection feature, switching between calls on my phone and streaming music on my desktop. This versatility made work-from-home arrangements unbelievably smooth. All these options worked as described, adding real convenience to everyday use.

[Check Soundcore A3947 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0bzv5mqkm/)

**Sound Quality and Customization**  
The audio experience was by far one of the highlights. Thanks to the 11mm dynamic drivers, every song, podcast, and call came through loud and clear. For anyone using them for commuting or leisure, the adaptive system ensures crisp highs, full mids, and deep bass layers that don‚Äôt feel muddy. What impressed me even more was HearID 2.0, which tailored the sound profile to my ears. Additionally, the equalizer offered 22 presets, which meant that no matter my mood, there was a setting to match. If you're someone who enjoys tweaking your audio, these earbuds won't disappoint.

**Advantages**  
- Noise-cancelation adapts in real time to external environments.  
- Long-lasting 50-hour battery life with the case is a game-changer.  
- Provides superior comfort for extended sessions without ear fatigue.  

**Battery and Charging Efficiency**  
Speaking of longevity, the earbuds lived up to their claims about battery life. On a single charge, they worked for around 8 hours with ANC on, extending to 40 hours with the case. On standard mode, I squeezed 10 hours of playback, and the case bumped it up to 50 hours total. Wireless charging was another cherry on top, eliminating the nuisance of tangled cables cluttering my desk.

**Water Resistance and Durability**  
I‚Äôd be remiss not to mention their IPX4 water resistance. While I wouldn‚Äôt recommend swimming with these, they held their own against light rain and inevitable coffee spills during my work hours. This was a huge relief, especially knowing how easily some tech gadgets can fall victim to minor water exposure.

**Disadvantages**  
- Lacks high-level water resistance for more rigorous moisture exposure.  
- The touch-control sensitivity could feel finicky at times, pausing the music by accident.  

**Competitive Options**  
After trying the Soundcore A3947, I did a bit of research and testing with competing wireless earbuds like the AirPods Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. While both of these alternatives offered impressive noise cancellation and smooth integration within their respective ecosystems, they lacked some features that made this product shine. For instance, the custom EQ presets on the Soundcore felt far more robust. Cost-wise, it provided more functionality without burning a hole in the pocket.

**Affordable Quality**  
When considering the price-to-quality ratio of these earbuds, they‚Äôre undeniably a strong contender. They deliver almost the same experience as premium earbuds but come at a more accessible price point. With technologies like dynamic drivers, adaptive noise cancellation, and HearID customization, every penny felt worth it. Testing other options in this range often revealed they sacrificed either sound quality or comfort to keep costs low, but these didn‚Äôt seem to cut corners.

That being said, I‚Äôm not ready to recover again, I know it‚Äôs sick but I have really bad body dysmorphia and am finally feeling comfortable with the way that my body looks again and am also going through a lot so this is the last bit of control I have.

I‚Äôm not restricting as extremely as I was then, but still more so than the average crash dieter and enough that it‚Äôs exacerbated lingering gastrointestinal issues (I‚Äôve always had them even before my first bout with anorexia) and I am finding myself, well‚Ä¶ unable to take a natural shit. I‚Äôm dealing with chronic bloating which fuels my ED because seeing my stomach distended at ALL is a major trigger for restriction, and I have been only going about once a week with the aid of harsh laxatives.

It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I‚Äôve had to use saline enemas multiple times but I hate taking that route for obvious reasons.

Ugh.

How have you guys been finding relief? What route should I take? Probiotics? Significantly upping my water intake (I probably don‚Äôt get enough)? Magnesium citrate?

The Business Name Game-Changer You Need to Know About üè™,"Ever wondered why your favorite local pizza place is called ""Tony's Pizza Palace"" but the business formation records say ""Anthony Rodriguez Enterprises, Inc.""? That's a DBA in action! If you're thinking about starting a business or already running one under a different name, this post breaks down everything you need to know.

# TL;DR

A DBA (Doing Business As) lets you operate your business under a name that's different from your personal name or your company's registered name. It's like a business nickname that makes you official and helps you open bank accounts, sign contracts, and build your brand.

# What Exactly Is a DBA?

Think of a DBA as your business's stage name. Just like how actors might use different names professionally, businesses use DBAs to operate under names that are more memorable, descriptive, or marketable than their legal names.

**Common DBA scenarios:**

* John Smith wants to run ""Smith's Auto Repair"" instead of just ""John Smith""
* ABC Corporation wants to launch a coffee shop called ""Morning Brew Caf√©""
* Sarah Johnson Photography LLC wants to also offer services as ""Elegant Events Planning""

A DBA doesn't create a new business entity ‚Äì it's simply registering an alternate name for an existing person or business. You're still the same legal entity underneath, just wearing a different name tag.

# Why Would You Need a DBA?

**Brand Recognition:** ""Sunny Day Landscaping"" sounds way more professional than ""Mike Thompson"" on your business cards and truck.

**Multiple Business Lines:** Maybe you started as a graphic designer but now also offer web development. A DBA lets you operate both under distinct names while keeping the same legal structure.

**Banking Requirements:** Most banks won't let you open a business account or deposit checks made out to your business name unless you have proper documentation ‚Äì and that's where your DBA comes in handy.

**Legal Protection:** Operating under an unregistered business name can actually get you in trouble in many states. A DBA keeps you compliant and legitimate.

# The Registration Process Made Simple

The DBA process varies by location, but it typically involves:

* Filing paperwork with your county clerk or state office
* Paying a modest fee (usually $10-100)
* Publishing a notice in a local newspaper (in some areas)
* Renewing periodically (every few years)

The good news? This isn't rocket science, but getting the details right matters for your business's legal standing and future banking needs.

# Making It Simple

While DBAs seem straightforward, there are nuances around naming restrictions, publication requirements, and renewal deadlines that can trip up business owners. Professional guidance can help you navigate state-specific requirements and ensure you're set up correctly from day one. Plus, many services handle the entire process, including the sometimes-tricky newspaper publication requirements.

In my defense, I was very drunk, very heartbroken, and very much not expecting to drag home a half-dead vampire like some goth raccoon who‚Äôs hoarding bad decisions.

I should have kept walking. I should have ignored the man slumped against the alley wall, blood darkening his shirt. I should have known that a creature with eyes like his wasn‚Äôt meant to be saved.

There‚Äôs also a particular kind of regret that comes with realizing you‚Äôve just invited an apex predator into your home. It‚Äôs somewhere between ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have texted my ex‚Äù and ‚Äúlet‚Äôs see if the week-old milk is still good.‚Äù

Fair warning: if you‚Äôre looking for a heroine who doesn‚Äôt swear, has her life together, and doesn‚Äôt make questionable decisions daily, you‚Äôve come to the wrong place.

Otherwise, strap yourself into the shitshow they call my life and hold on to your granny panties ‚Äì this is going to be a bumpy ride.

*That two-timing, butt-munching, flea-invested douche-canoe!*

The bartender across from me is staring at me like I‚Äôm the creature from the blue lagoon. Probably because my lips and tongue are stained azure from the six blue¬†curacao and lemonade cocktails I‚Äôve sucked down in the past hour.

*I know what you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äì how is she still sitting upright after so much alcohol? Well, my lovelies, this curvy girl‚Äôs size and fast metabolism has helped me drink seasoned alcoholics under the table when the time called for it. Yay me!*

That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not feeling the effects, though. I have a distinct suspicion that when I finally decide to lift my ass from this barstool, my equilibrium is not going to be top-notch.¬†*Oh well, I‚Äôll cross that bridge when I get there.*

I should have known when I woke up this morning, and my coffee machine was on the fritz, that shit was going to get rough today. That machine has been my partner in crime through two years of college, moving house four times and many mornings of hangovers or one-night stands.

As soon as I switched it on this morning, there was a sudden spark before the back of the contraption burst into flames. I was stunned for all of two seconds before I realized that I was the only adult in the house, and it was my responsibility to stop the fire from spreading and my whole house from burning to the ground.

Luckily, I remembered that according to Professor Google, you should use baking soda to smother an electrical fire, not water, like in usual cases. So, I rushed to my pantry and grabbed the box that had rarely been used¬†*(because I can‚Äôt bake for shit)*¬†and doused that fucking fire like my life depended on it.¬†*Come to think of it, my life did depend on it. Huh.*

My second clue should have been when my newest employee quit via Instagram DM.¬†*Very professional, I know.*

A week ago, she begged me to look past her young age and give her a chance. This would also be her first job. I reluctantly agreed because I remembered that I once, too, was a new addition to the workforce and struggled to find someone to believe in me.¬†*And look at how that turned out.*

Calling the bartender over, I slide my empty glass towards him, ‚ÄúAnother, please, barkeep.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, ma‚Äôam, but I need to cut you off.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat! Why?‚Äù I ask, outraged, realizing my volume control button might be broken when a few heads swivel my way.¬†*Oh, bite me*.

‚ÄúBecause the hotel has a strict policy that non-hotel guests are only allowed to use the bar until 10:00 pm.‚Äù

I look at him warily because this¬†*policy*¬†sounds like a load of bullshit to me.¬†*Is he trying to get rid of me without offending me? Some Karen probably complained about the large, fat single lady who was drowning her sorrows in vats of alcohol. Well, fuck you, Karen.*

I glance at my wristwatch and give him my sweetest smile, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you a deal. It‚Äôs currently 9:45 pm. If you serve me one more drink, I‚Äôll tip you a crisp 50-dollar bill.‚Äù

The look in his eyes tells me I was successful in my negotiation tactics. ‚ÄúFine, but I must ask you to hand me your keys. I‚Äôll call you a cab once you‚Äôre done.‚Äù

With a huge smile, I slide my hand into my purse to hand them over. ‚ÄúYou have yourself a deal, my good sir.‚Äù

Turning around to mix my drink, I catch him rolling his eyes at me. He‚Äôs probably fed up with drunk customers who think copious amounts of alcohol will solve their problems.¬†*Judgy much?*

Sipping on my last cocktail of the night, I think back to the moment I walked into Steven‚Äôs apartment to find him balls-deep in my previously mentioned ex-employee.¬†*Yeah, you heard me right.*

Steven had popped into my bookstore a few times in the last week. Nothing odd about that. He even introduced himself to Kylie, my new employee. Nothing odd about that either. It was unusual, though, when I found them huddling in a corner yesterday, whispering and giggling together.

And because I was hyper-focused on the new vampire smut books that had arrived that morning and where I would be displaying them, I didn‚Äôt give it much thought. Because having a dark, broody, dangerous man claim you as his for all eternity trumps me worrying about¬†*whatever*¬†that was.

Gemma, my 62-year-old employee, had sent me home early today¬†*(as if I wasn‚Äôt the one paying her salary)*¬†to prepare for a function I had to attend with Steven at his office tonight. On the way home, I realized that the pair of shoes I needed for the evening was still at his place. So, I popped over to his apartment, intent on being in and out in minutes.

What awaited me will haunt me for days. Probably months. Most likely years.

Due to his bedroom being in the back of the apartment, I initially didn‚Äôt hear the noises when I slipped inside using a copy of the key he gave me two weeks ago. But after about five steps down the hallway, the sounds coming from behind the closed door made me pause for about 2.5 seconds ‚Äì my gut screaming at me.

When I slowly pushed the door open, trying to prolong the moment of seeing my world get tee-peed by used toilet paper, my mind ping-ponged between screeching like a banshee, laughing hysterically like an evil witch, or crying like a kid who just lost his pet axolotl.

The only way to forget what I saw is most likely to bleach my eyeballs.¬†*Will my health insurance cover that procedure?*",1,1753804824.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I don't know what will happen, but I've been wanting to come clean for years now.","I didn't know he was married when we met at work. We were friends for half a year, eating lunch or getting coffee daily and texting on weekends. We got closer and he kept asking me to have drinks after work or get lunch on weekends. After half a year, I agreed. One night during drinks, he hugged me and said he felt like he could be himself with me. A week later he kissed me and told me he loved me, and that's how we began. As he was late 40s/early 50s with teenage kids, I never questioned why he didn't invite me to his house, but he slept over at mine often (and I live in a nice part of the city where restaurants and concert venues were so it made sense why we hung out at my place and not his in the suburbs). I could never have imagined that the man I fell in love with was a bad person, so I made so many excuses in my head ignoring the obvious signs as they came up during the first year of our relationship. Realizing okay, he's married legally but maybe separated? Maybe she's a lesbian and is allowing him sex? Maybe an open marriage? Maybe they don't like each other but staying for the kids?

Once, after about a year I saw him texting his wife calling her ""amor"" and kissing face emojis and I felt like the stupidest person on Earth. All the while he was telling me he loved me so much and wished that he could restart his life to hold on to meet me. Every time I said how disgusted I felt with myself and that I am a total POS, he would love bomb me even harder. I am not his first affair, probably the 20th woman he's slept with since getting married, but he claims I'm the first that he's fallen in love with. He claimed that his affairs started when his wife told him she didn't want to have sex anymore after having kids 10 years ago, but then later he told me the last time he had sex with his wife was the same year he met me. Later I found out he had been cheating on her ever since they were engaged and he never stopped since. His work allows him to travel a lot, and he told me ""funny"" stories about 3somes in Australia, one night stands in New Orleans, getting hit on by girls in fancy hotel bars in Paris, sleeping with strippers and waitresses at Twin Peaks and night clubs. That's actually one of the reasons why I didn't think he was married, because if he was, how could he get away with so much for almost 25 years? He even brought back a few women to the house he shared with his family. He told me not to feel bad, if it wasn't me, he would be with one of them.

The guilt of my part to play and my desire to do the ""right"" thing are now strongest. When I found out he was married, I wanted to see his wife for myself to ask her what the deal was with their marriage, but if I'm going to be honest, I loved him too much and didn't have the strength to give him up if it really was full on cheating. He told me recently he was just telling me he loved me in the past because he wanted me to be his girlfriend, but since those days 3 years ago, he's changed his mind. He also said ""I told my wife I'd love her forever and promise to always be hers, but that's not true anymore is it?"" His mask came completely off and any love I used to have for him has turned to absolute hatred. I never told his wife because I was weak and because I loved him too much to hurt him, but now it's different. His wife is a SAHM, and frankly, he uses that fact to financially abuse her. After a few years I saw the game he plays - he has a seperate phone, separate credit card, separate bank account that is actually his dad's bank account that he has a debit card. He makes the money, pays the bills, pays the taxes, handles any finances and phone bills. His wife can use their joint credit card whenever she wants and he always pays it, so she has no need to look into their joint bank account. She probably never questions why their bank account doesn't get direct deposits from his work and is instead a transfer, she never questions how come their taxes say he makes so much more than what ends up in their bank, and she never questions how come there are extra credit cards being used (by him) that she doesn't know about. I heard him say that he works and makes money in their family so he gets to have fun and do whatever he wants. I laughed once because he said he likes a woman with ambition who works, but that's funny because he cannot take any criticism (one of his complaints about me) and really what he wants is a woman who shuts up whenever he tells her to stop asking questions and give him ""freedom"".

I know she doesn't work, but she could become very wealthy if she gets even half of his assets in a divorce. He has a 401k and pension that are worth several millions, and a fully paid off house, in additional to several brokerage accounts. There is also a likelihood if she gets a good lawyer, that there will be clawbacks for the thousands in hotel rooms and restaurants that he used for his infidelity over the years. I wonder, as he claimed he was traveling for work but instead going on date nights and sleeping over, could a judge subpoena his Outlook calendar from work to verify if he was traveling or not? There's a chance she does not divorce him. They are Catholic and from a culture that excuses men for cheating, especially as he has been providing her a good lifestyle and an outwardly social picture perfect life. But I feel like she needs to make the decision herself now after knowing everything. Their youngest is now 18 and will go to college in the Fall, so there will be no child support to pay and everyone is an adult and can decide their own relationship with him.

I thought many times about how I would tell her. I don't have her number and can't find her on social media, but I do know where they live. I know he is traveling for work in Europe today and won't be home, so I'm thinking of just ringing her doorbell in the afternoon and talking to her face to face. I'll take anything that comes at me. I'm prepared to be arrested for trespassing even if it comes to that. I'm prepared for retaliation at work if it came to that, but it would screw him over even more if he did that. The last 3 years was not the person I wanted to be and I am so ashamed of myself. Any relationship that I have in the future I will disclose everything that happened, and if it means I'm alone for the rest of my life, so be it.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **WNBA Showdown: Sparks vs. Aces ‚Äì A High-Voltage Parlay Play**

The Los Angeles Sparks, currently riding a five-game winning streak, host the Las Vegas Aces in a playoff-impacting clash. On paper, the Aces are favored (-2.5), but the Sparks‚Äô recent hot streak and porous defense make this a tantalizing matchup for a same-game parlay. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a point guard and the humor of a halftime show.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The Sparks are 11th in defensive rating, which is WNBA code for ‚Äúthey let people score like it‚Äôs their job.‚Äù Their opponents shoot 45.1% against them‚Äî3.3% better than the Aces‚Äô 41.8% field goal percentage. That‚Äôs not great news for Las Vegas‚Äô offense, which relies on A‚Äôja Wilson (21.6 PPG) to carry the load like a one-woman dunk contest. Meanwhile, Kelsey Plum is on fire, nailing three+ three-pointers in seven straight games. She‚Äôs the WNBA‚Äôs version of aÁÅ´ÈîÖ (hot pot) that‚Äôs *always* simmering.

The total is set at 175.0 points, with even-money odds on Over/Under. Given the Sparks‚Äô 85 PPG average and the Aces‚Äô 81.3 PPG allowed, this feels like a math problem: 85 + 81.3 = 166.3. But hey, math hates the WNBA. Add Plum‚Äôs three-point jacking and Wilson‚Äôs rebound-and-dash plays, and we‚Äôre looking at a popcorn game.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Circuses

The Sparks are a playoff-hungry team with nothing to lose. Their recent wins have been fueled by Plum‚Äôs sharpshooting and a defense that‚Äôs about as effective as a screen door in a hurricane. The Aces, meanwhile, are a rollercoaster of inconsistency‚Äîwinning when Wilson dominates and losing when her teammates shoot like they‚Äôre playing HORSE with a coffee table.

Key injury note: No major absences for either team, but the Aces‚Äô supporting cast (hello, 41.8% FG) might force Wilson into a solo act. For the Sparks,

[**AITA for attending the funeral of my mother**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qxnlru/aita_for_attending_the_funeral_of_my_mother/)

I (24 F) was given up by my parents as a baby, because they were both eighteen and had no way to properly care for me. I didn't have a very good life until I got into college off of a sports scholarship and it was then that I decided to investigate my past. I found out that my parents were still together, that they had two other kids a lot younger than me and had overall become very successful in life.

I started to feel very resentful and although I almost reached out, I decided that I couldn't. I still kept tabs on them to see how they were doing, how my siblings are and stuff. When I found out that my mother died, I did attend the funeral a few weeks ago. It was a big funeral, a lot of people attended but it wasn't packed cause. The thing is, other than my hair being jet black, I look just like my mother did.

So, when people were leaving, I got spotted by my mother's hysterical great-aunt who assumed I was my mother. I excused myself but I'm pretty sure I exposed who I was cause just a few days ago, my father managed to find me and reached out to me.

When we met at a coffee shop three days ago, he apologized for having given me up, not reaching out sooner and ended up crying over not getting to raise me. Its the first time I saw a grown man cry. He asked me if I needed anything from a car to a place to stay but I couldn't help but feel like I was embarrassing him. So I said goodbye and left but I've received a lot of texts and voicemails from him since then asking why I left early, if I'll meet him again but don't feel like I can talk to him. Then I got a phone call from a woman saying she was his cousin and my aunt and that I should have stayed away because he's inconsolable now and I'm an asshole for choosing a funeral to reveal myself.

I feel like my aunt is right because I've done is brought him new grief after he just lost his wife.

**OOP**
>*I know, it would have been a lot different if they kept me and they probably wouldn't have been happy.

It's their reaction to your being there that people are complaining about. You have absolutely no control over how people are going to react in any given situation. Definitely not the asshole...

>As for building a relationship with your father, I do believe he is reaching out to you in his grief since you do look so much like your mother. I'm sure he's feeling guilty, too, for having put you up for adoption. It's up to you whether or not you'd like a relationship with him. But from what I'm getting in your writing is that he's well off now and he'd buy you the moon if you'd give him a second chance. If you're up to owning the moon, you might want to give him a chance.

[**UPDATE: AITA for attending the funeral of my mother**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rllwph/update_aita_for_attending_the_funeral_of_my_mother/) - *32 days later*

So I'm posting this cause I said I would in a month. Things happened and its gotten better.

The first thing was my aunt (dad's cousin) phoned me like the day after and apologized to me. She told me she practically raised my dad and seeing him like he was made her act without thinking. She told me my dad wanted to see me again and would appreciate it if I would meet her too. I told her how hurtful what she said was and I needed time before seeing her but did agree to meet him.

Fast forward a week I go to meet my dad. I kept rereading everyone's advice and using it to prepare what to say. He was more composed. I told him it hurt me so much to be abandoned and it hurt seeing how successful he was and it made feel not wanted and meeting him made me want to be forgotten. He told me he never forgot about me and showed me a small baby photo of me he keeps in his wallet and told me he still sees me as his baby even though I'm grown. He told me he and my mom used to cry for me every day after giving me up but they still prayed for me every day even until the end. He once again told me whatever I wanted, he could give me if I'd let him. I told him I wanted no money or anything from him and I didn't intend to reveal myself. He told me it was okay if I wanted nothing to do with him but asked I be a part of my mom's great-aunt's life as she hadn't stopped asking about me since exposing me and gave me her address.

He insisted I was always wanted but he always thought Id been adopted and didn't want to ruin my life. And that's something a lot of you said, so I was prepared for it. He asked me to forgive him for not being there for me and said he'd do whatever to be my dad. I guess I realized I could push him away or finally have what I wanted. I told him my teenage fantasy that he'd come save me from the orphanage and we both started crying. He told me we can save each other and I hugged him and forgave him.

Since then I started seeing him more, visit my great-great aunt (every other day (she's started calling me by baby nickname she had for my mom). My dad also started coming to the gym that me, my fiancee and my best friend started after grad. He has been trying to do all the dad stuff I missed out on that we can still do like teaching me how to drive, business advice and stuff. I also finally don't feel so upset over my siblings getting a better life than me. He also got us both into counseling and I've finally been able to talk about all my years in the system before I aged out. He is hosting a New Years Party and asked me to come so I can meet all my relatives, cousins and siblings and yes, I am going.

So I want to thank everybody that prepared me for how he felt in giving me up and how he felt in getting to see me again. I think that if you all hadn't pointed that out to me, I probably would have just tried to stay hidden and I wouldn't have finally gotten a dad.

>What a fantastic outcome. It‚Äôs sometimes easier to hang on to the hurt since that‚Äôs been your default position all along and this takes real guts to move forward on. That he carried a photo of you always is such a sweet thing and really shows you were not just easily disposed of. I hope you and your family just go from strength to strength. And if he‚Äôs financially comfortable maybe accept a little something from him, not as a material grab, but he missed out on all those birthdays and Christmases too so it would probably make him feel great. Even a simple necklace or something you could always wear. When he sees you with it on, it will warm his heart too. What wonderful timing for a real family Christmas for you all.

**OOP**
>*I won't rebuff a Christmas gift, but I don't want him or anybody thinking I'm only in it for the cash. Maybe in time I'll be more comfortable taking things but the way I see it getting free advice on running my business from a guy as successful as him is better than anything money could buy. Plus it feels good to see how proud he is of me being a businessowner.*

[**I finally got to meet my entire family!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/s6b8c9/i_finally_got_to_meet_my_entire_family/) - *60 Days later*

So I guess this is kinda an update to my a it a post (not sure if I can mention that sub here) but a bit over two weeks ago at the end of the year, I finally got to meet all of my family! And it was the best time ever. On the 31st, my dad went to my apartment, chatted in Spanish for like half an hour with my fiancee (nobody speaks it in our country) and then I left with him for his house (my fiancee said he'd come later).

When we got to my dad's house I was like 'oh my God'. I'd seen photos before but damn it's like a mini mansion - especially next to my apartment. It made me smile so much when I told dad you have a beautiful home and he told me 'it's your home too'. When we got in, my dad led me to the living room where my siblings were waiting with my dad's uncle (so my great!) and one of my cousins. Honestly, I was really, really scared but then my cousin and uncle came and gave me a huge hug and said they've waited for this for so long. It was a bit more awkward with my siblings cause they're both little like not even ten yet. But when they started asking questions it got a bit overwhelming so my dad made them stop but I liked it cause it means they want to get to know me. It did make a bit sad when my little sister said that I look so much like mommy used to.

I can't believe I didn't notice it until then but there was this giant photo of my parents and a baby over the fireplace. Like my dad looked super young in that photo, younger than me even so I had to ask is that me. When my dad said yes, I started crying. My great uncle took my siblings away and my dad and my cousin consoled me. Honestly it may seem selfish but that felt really good.

Rest of the day went great too, especially when my fiancee came as well. Right at dinner time, my dad did a large toast to all the relatives and introduced me and my fiancee. Honestly, I don't know if I can write most of what he said but it just made me feel so loved and so happy I let him into my life. I went back to my apartment with my fiancee really early in the morning but since then I've never felt better.

Honestly, only reason I remembered to post this is cause today my dad sent me a text asking if my fiancee and I want to go on a trip with him to Spain in February. I don't know if we will be able to yet, but we'll see.

>The picture over the fireplace made me tear up

**OOP**
>*Honestly, these last few months have been the most emotional I've ever been. It's not like I don't have emotions, but even my fiancee thought I had ASD when we first met. The way I've lived has made me averse to sharing my emotions (although not when I type). The baby photo my dad showed me before was just of me. But that was of me and my parents and I looked so happy for a baby. It just made me so emotional I couldn't keep it in.*

**OOP**
>*Now that I know them, I don't think any of them would really even care if I asked money from my dad but... I don't know. I just don't feel like I can take it. I'll take gifts and stuff on celebrations but it just makes my stomach churn the idea of just being given something when that's never really happened to me. Besides, getting my dad's business advice for free on running our gym and the club we're opening is so much more valuable then him gifting me a car.*

**u/jemy74**
>I suspect this comes from your time in the system and being taught that gifts come with a price. You learned to be self sufficient and take care of yourself when you were very young.

>I think you are an amazing survivor and a daughter anyone would be proud. I think also accepting kindness from your new family will become easier in time. But it is also alright to take things slow for now and get used to things.

>I am sending you many internet hugs and I wish the best of luck going forward

**OOP**
>*No, you're 100% right. I'm not going to talk about my life before university, but that's why I am the way I am, aloof, unemotional and hesitant with gifts. Like, I know my dad wants to pay for this trip to Spain but I'd just feel so wrong letting that happen like I have to put my own cash in if I go.*

**u/mamabear-50**
>Maybe think of it from your dad‚Äôs point of view. He‚Äôs suddenly discovered his long lost daughter who didn‚Äôt have a great childhood. I am sure he wants you to have everything he couldn‚Äôt give you before. Besides possibly making your life a little easier he‚Äôll have the joy of making up for lost time. Sometimes the best gift you can give someone is graciously accepting their gift that is given in love. This is what I see between you and your father.

>Thank you for a happy ending. Take that trip to Spain!!!

**OOP**
>*Yeah, I know he probably wants to give me everything (and probably would if I asked) but I guess the fact that he's willing to is enough for me. Maybe one day I'll get over whatever is blocking me but for now just getting the dad things from him I couldn't before is all I'm going to take (like him teaching me to drive).*

*Where Math Meets Mayhem in the WNBA*

**1. Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)**  
The Atlanta Dream (-8, -368 ML) are the clear favorites here, and the numbers back it up. Their 4th-ranked defense has suffocated opponents all season, outscoring them by 121 points total. Meanwhile, the Golden State Valkyries (11-13) are a cautionary tale of a 10th-place offense and a -3 points differential‚Äîlike a baker who opens a pizzeria and somehow loses money on every slice.

The implied probabilities scream ‚ÄúAtlanta‚Äôs your guy.‚Äù At -368 ML, the Dream‚Äôs implied win chance is **78.6%** (calculated via 368 / (368 + 100)). The Valkyries? A paltry **25.8%**‚Äîwhich makes sense if their roster includes a team of accounting majors trying to play pickup basketball. The spread (-8) suggests Atlanta should win comfortably, and the over/under (156.5) is a trap for the unwary: these teams average **162.6 PPG combined**, so the **Over** is a statistical no-brainer.

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Streaks, and a Dash of Chaos**  
Atlanta‚Äôs Rhyne Howard is out with a knee injury, but they‚Äôve survived worse. Think of it like losing your favorite coffee mug‚Äîannoying, but you can just grab a travel cup. Golden State‚Äôs situation is dire: Kayla Thornton is done for the season, and the team is mired in a **three-game road losing streak**. Their offense? A leaky faucet trying to power a hydroelectric dam.

The Valkyries‚Äô lone silver lining? Brionna Jones‚Äô rebounding. But even she can‚Äôt out-jump a bad spread. As for Atlanta‚Äôs Allisha Gray, she‚Äôs the WNBA‚Äôs version of a Swiss Army knife‚Äîscoring, dishing, and nailing 2.4 threes per game. Golden State‚Äôs Tiffany Hayes can only muster 1.8 threes? That‚Äôs like bringing a spoon to a barbecue.

I recently picked up a bag of watermelon co-ferment beans from Traffic Coffee. This was my first co-ferment coffee I purchased and the tasting notes were watermelon, icecream, honeydew, mint. 

However, the only tasting notes I'm really getting are watermelon with a bit of mint, and it's so overwhelming in its presence that I'm questioning if I like co-ferments like this to begin with. Like drinking watermelon juice mixed with my coffee, which I don't want to do every morning. 

  
I don't really want to throw this bag out, but I also don't think I want to drink this more than another day or two. Anyone have creative reuse ideas for beans like this, especially heavily processed? So far I was going to turn it into cold brew and dilute it with milk.",0,1753804396.0,pourover,7,0.33,False

1mcf489,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mcf489,THIS is Why J1 Never Left My Rotation üî•,"---

**TLDR:**¬†a perfect side to your morning coffee or pre-workout routine, tastes like lime meringue pie that coats your tongue giving flavor with every exhale. This batch reminded me why J1 has been my #1 daytime routine since it hit NJ shelves - even through the disappointing drops.

---

# The Loyalty Test üíØ

**Through Thick and Thin ‚Ä¢**

Yeah, the last couple of batches were going downhill. But real talk? Even during those disappointing drops - the ones that had me questioning everything - J1 never actually left my rotation.

The effects were still there. The sativa clarity, the functional energy, that perfect morning buzz that gets you moving without anxiety. Even when the flavor and bag appeal suffered, the core of what makes J1 special was intact.

**Why Premium Bud Couldn't Dethrone It ‚Ä¢**

Amazing strains have hit NJ shelves lately. Some with better bag appeal, some with higher THC, some with more hype. But none knocked J1 out of my daily routine because none delivered that complete package for daytime use.

---  

# This Batch is Peak J1 üåü

**The Flavor Experience ‚Ä¢**

Like lime meringue pie. I'm not being hyperbolic - it literally coats your tongue so you can taste it on every exhale. That terpinolene dominance expressing exactly how it should, creating something you just don't find elsewhere.

**Visual Perfection ‚Ä¢**

This is the J1 that caught my attention and never lost it. Bright, shimmering green, crystal coverage that sparkles, compact dense structure that tells you everything about the cultivation quality. Not the lime green from another favorite batch but beautiful just the same.

---

# Why This Matters for NJ Cannabis üéØ

**Consistency vs. Excellence ‚Ä¢**

This batch proves what Clade9 can do when everything aligns properly. It's not about perfection every time - it's about knowing what the ceiling looks like and working toward it.

**The Real Test ‚Ä¢**

For taste and solid sativa effects, I genuinely haven't found anything close enough to knock this out of rotation. Not for lack of trying - believe me, I've sampled plenty searching for that next level.

**Haters Gonna Hate ‚Ä¢**

Some people will dismiss Clade9 as hype (and I agree for the most part). But with flavor and effects that makes you look forward to your morning session? The proof is in the jar.

---  

# The Bottom Line üí≠

This is why I called J1 the most flavorful strain in NJ. Apparently not because every batch is perfect, but because when it hits like this, nothing else comes close.

That lime meringue pie flavor coating your tongue on every exhale. The clear-headed sativa effects that actually enhance your day instead of clouding it. The consistency of effects even when other factors varied.

**This batch is everything J1 should be - and a reminder why some strains earn that permanent spot in your routine üî•**

I wanted to get a few laptop recommendations from anyone in the program. I‚Äôm joining OMSCS in the fall on the Machine Learning track. I currently have a really good desktop for Machine Learning tasks but wanted a lightweight laptop/tablet to use on the go ie. Coffee shops, libraries, train rides. I‚Äôd use the desktop for any heavy compute. Ideally I‚Äôd want something in the $1000-$1400 range. I‚Äôve been considering the following:

1. Microsoft Surface Pro 11: ARM architecture, Snapdragon X Elite.

2. MacBook Air M4: ARM architecture on Apple Silicon

3. XPS13: x86 intel i7/9 (Lunar Lake)

My top choice right now if the Microsoft Surface Pro. My biggest reason for this is because I‚Äôd be able to use it for my business as well (Conferences, work, etc.) I was wondering if anyone ran into any issues running assignments with windows on ARM? I also understand a few users on this thread had issues with their MacBooks (albeit solved through a few workarounds).

1. Considering both the Surface and MacBooks run on ARM, does windows on arm experience the same issues as MacBook with the x86 emulation layer that the surface has? 

2. Considering MacBooks have unified ram with good throughput, should i just bite the bullet and get the M4 MacBook Air?

3. Are all laptops on ARM so much of a pain that I should just stick to the traditional x86? I‚Äôve read online that a few SWE‚Äôs had compatibility issues with certain software on ARM.

Met a woman online in a forum about a topic I needed help with. She responded and we got to chatting. She sounds great and we have a lot of similar interests and a good vibe. Found out we even live in the same city and of the same age. Naturally, I asked her out since both of us are single. Nothing romantic, just to meet and talk  
Here's where it gets tricky. She's on the fence about meeting. Wishes to talk more as right now she feels comfortable online. I'm old fashioned and prefer to have my conversations face to face.   
I don't want to sound needy or give her the idea that I'm already in love with her or something. Nor do I want to day dream about meeting her someday. Just meet and explore and see if there is a future, whatever that may be.

This shouldn't be so complicated. We text for a day or two. Do a vibe-check and then decide to meet for a coffee like two adults. See where it goes.   
  
I'm not afraid it won't work out. I'm afraid the texting will get boring as it drags on & if I put my foot down about meeting, it'll end right there and then. So I got to play it cool like I'm ok with her choice which, while I respect, I don't agree with.

I remember my younger self who used to smile a lot, and people always said I was good at making friends. True enough, whenever I cracked jokes, I‚Äôd make people laugh and eventually become their friend. I was the listener, the one who always gave advice, and yeah, I had a lot of friends.

Then came the end of high school, that moment when you realize the hard truth that some friends are just seasonal. You think of them, you reminisce the good memories, but you can‚Äôt talk to them anymore or have deep convos like you used to.

Then came college, where you learn that you can laugh and walk around all day with a small group, but you can‚Äôt sit in a coffee shop and talk about life and hardships.

Then came the new normal, where everyone‚Äôs life came to a halt. Some were able to keep going, but some of us got stuck. Unfortunately, I was one of the ones who got stuck. I used to hate the world for making my life so miserable when all I ever wanted was to buy my dad a car once I became successful. But now, he‚Äôs suddenly just ashes in an urn, and I can‚Äôt even be the daughter who whines, asks for allowance, finishes college, and goes through that normal progress I always thought I would.

Suddenly, I‚Äôm chasing money just to support kids I didn‚Äôt even make. From a teenager, I turned into a sister who can‚Äôt sleep at night, thinking, ‚ÄúWhat will I do? I don‚Äôt even have a single peso to buy food for my siblings.‚Äù I became the person in charge, not because I wanted to, but because my mom wasn‚Äôt built to be a mom.

Looking back, I thought I improved. I thought I learned to accept things as they are. But now I realize, I just learned how to run from it because I know if I face it, I‚Äôll shatter. And I can‚Äôt afford to shatter. I still need to work. I still need to earn.

How can life be this cruel at 25? I was a child, a daughter, a student, a lover and suddenly, I‚Äôm a no one. The life I envisioned as a kid feels impossible now, even with that cliche of ‚Äúwaiting for the right moment.‚Äù That moment was stolen from me. And what can I do? Just earn money and spend it on lives I didn‚Äôt even create.

Today, I woke up tasting blood in my mouth‚Ä¶ then I realized that dream of me gritting my teeth was real. I thought it was just some weird dream. I‚Äôm here now because I can‚Äôt sort out my feelings like I used to. Back then, I had the privilege to shut down and deal with it for days. Now, all I can do is unconsciously break while going through a 6-day work routine.

I used to think I‚Äôd never want to love or be loved again, especially after I broke up with my boyfriend l, when life got too hard and I had to take charge. But now I‚Äôm wondering‚Ä¶ is it really that nice to feel loved? ‚ÄòCause I don‚Äôt think I ever really felt that. I was always the second option. Is it really that good to be the priority? To be taken care of? To be loved? To be listened to?

Right now, I just want this lifetime to be over. I already accepted that good things are too far-fetched, and honestly, I don‚Äôt think I can wait for them any longer. I won‚Äôt end this myself, I‚Äôm just excited for this to be over. ",3,1753804093.0,Life,1,1.0,False
1mcf00r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mcf00r/explore_if_chulux_single_cup_coffee_maker_is/,Explore if CHULUX Single Cup Coffee Maker is Worth It Review and Insights,"Testing out the CHULUX LC-CM50801-BK Mini Single Serve Coffee Maker has been quite an experience. This compact powerhouse delivers simplicity and convenience right in the comfort of your kitchen‚Äîor wherever life takes you. Its promise of portability and one-touch operation intrigued me, so I decided to give it a shot during my daily coffee routine. Here‚Äôs how it stacks up based on my hands-on use and personal observations.

**Compact and Lightweight Design**

As someone who values saving counter space, this coffee machine impressed me straight out of the box. It‚Äôs smaller than a loaf of bread, measuring just 7.5"" x 4.3"" x 9"" and weighing around 2.2 pounds. Its sleek black finish fits nicely into any modern kitchen aesthetic. I‚Äôve used it in my small apartment without it feeling intrusive, and it slipped perfectly into my suitcase for a quick work trip. The ability to brew directly into a travel mug (up to 5.3‚Äù tall) also makes it ideal for on-the-go lifestyles.

[Grab CHULUX LC-CM50801-BK at the best price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0drtz2ph9/)

**Ease of Use with One-Touch Operation**

Operating this machine was as easy as breathing. The one-touch button brewing system simplifies the process‚Äîjust insert a K-cup capsule, add water, press the button, and wait. In as little as a few minutes, I had a 12oz cup of coffee ready to go. It doesn‚Äôt get much simpler than that! For someone who often rushes out the door in the morning half-asleep, this feature is a lifesaver. However, while the simplicity is a definite strength, there‚Äôs no option for more advanced customization‚Äîsomething seasoned coffee aficionados may find limiting.

**Performance and Speed**

During testing, I realized this little coffee maker punched above its weight class. It uses an NTC heating system to brew coffee quickly, reaching 180¬∞F within minutes, which is actually pretty impressive for such a compact appliance. Brewing 12oz cups consistently took under five minutes from start to finish. I appreciated the blue indicator light that signaled when it was actively brewing, coupled with the auto shut-off feature that prevents overheating and saves energy.

**Highlights**

- Exceptional portability for travel.
- Lightning-fast heat-up system.
- Simple operation via a single button.
- Fits into small spaces easily.
- Auto shut-off adds safety and energy efficiency.

**Areas of Concern**

- No brew customization options.
- Not ideal for high-altitude use (over 6,000 feet).
- The plastic construction could feel flimsy for some users.

**Who is this for?**

This coffee machine serves a very specific demographic perfectly. If you‚Äôre a student living in a dorm, a frequent traveler staying in hotels, or someone navigating life in a compact space like an RV or trailer, this might just be your perfect coffee companion. It handles small-scale brewing with ease but might not satisfy those who want to manage temperature settings or brew strength.

**Rival Brands**

Comparing it with others, such as the Keurig K-Mini, the Chulux has its advantages in affordability and portability. Keurig offers more advanced features, like brew size customization and a sleeker finish, but also comes with a heftier price tag. The Bella One Serve also competes in the portable single-serve space but lacks the robust NTC heating technology present here. Each model has its strengths, yet the CHULUX holds its ground as the lighter, more affordable option for basic coffee needs.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Considering its cost, this single-serve brewer offers remarkable value. While it doesn‚Äôt come with all the bells and whistles of premium brewers, its affordability coupled with its efficient, straightforward brewing system makes it well worth considering. The features justify the pricing, especially if you prioritize portability over features like app connectivity or temperature controls.

So someone who joins in one location can enjoy the same amenities in others. 

Basically, places with comfy chairs that offer drinks, food, coffee, or similar amenities, but only to members, and explicitly places that don't have a problem with members hanging around reading or relaxing for long periods of time, which won't try to hustle you out of your seat for the next customer, etc. (Since, after all, the member has already paid dues for the privilege of enjoying the time relaxing.)

I seem to remember that there used to be some airport travelers' clubs that offered something like this, but those are obviously restricted to airports. Country clubs may have elements of this, too, but aside from being somewhat more oriented toward wealthy clientele, it's my understanding that they're mostly local organizations, without national or international branches.

1mcetkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mcetkf/explore_if_the_best_coffee_maker_mr_coffee_sk12rb/,Explore if the best coffee maker Mr Coffee SK12RB is worth it,"Using the Mr. Coffee SK12-RB daily feels like stepping back into a time when coffee makers were simple, unfussy, and got the job done without unnecessary bells or whistles. This little brewing machine is perfect for anyone who just wants a solid cup of hot coffee without navigating a spaceship-like control panel.

**Design and Build Quality**  
I wasn‚Äôt expecting the aesthetics to wow me, but the classic design perfectly complements its simplicity. It‚Äôs a clean white color, with dimensions that make it compact enough to fit neatly on a countertop without dominating the space (9.2"" D x 12.3"" W x 13.6"" H). While its lightweight structure at 3.6 pounds doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúhigh-end,‚Äù it feels sturdy enough for everyday use. The dual water window is a subtle yet useful touch, providing visibility when filling the tank and preventing messy overflows‚Äîa feature I‚Äôve come to appreciate on groggy mornings.

**Features That Simplify Daily Brewing**  
What stands out immediately is the Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause. This function has been nothing short of a lifesaver on rushed mornings! Whether it‚Äôs my borderline impatient self or a family member sneaking a cup mid-brew, the brewing process halts smoothly without spills. Once you slide the carafe back in place, it picks up right where it left off. The Lift & Clean Filter Basket, another thoughtful addition, makes the cleanup process frustration-free‚Äîno bending over the sink for ages excessively scrubbing.

**Positives**  
- The faithful simplicity of operation‚Äîjust one button to brew and no daunting setup.  
- Reusable filter contributes to environmentally conscious brewing.  
- Auto-Pause ensures you don‚Äôt need to wait around for the entire pot.  

[Enjoy the Mr. Coffee SK12-RB's intuitive simplicity. Check the latest deals on Amazon now.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b002yi49h6/)

**Performance and Consistency**  
The Mr. Coffee SK12-RB brews a full 12 cups efficiently, with its 110-volt operation providing reliable consistency. Being a drip-coffee aficionado, I find the flavor satisfactory‚ÄîI‚Äôd call it rich, though not gourmet. That said, it heats quickly and keeps the coffee warm for just the right amount of time in the pot. However, it doesn‚Äôt come equipped with a timer or automatic shut-off. There was one day I may or may not have completely forgotten to turn it off, which left me feeling uneasy about energy wastage. Also, the lack of programmable features means you can‚Äôt wake up to the smell of fresh coffee, something I low-key miss.

**Shortcomings**  
- No auto-shut-off feature, requiring you to manually turn it off.  
- Lack of a built-in timer, which could be useful for those who like prepping their coffee ahead of time.  
- Not the most durable materials‚ÄîI‚Äôd advise careful handling.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Using the coffee maker daily has been seamless. Its manual operation mode couldn‚Äôt be more beginner-friendly. You just scoop in your ground coffee, pour in the water, and hit the ‚Äúon‚Äù button. While I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a coffee-splattering klutz, spills do happen, so I appreciate how the carafe pours cleanly without drips. Cleaning the reusable filter is an eco-friendly bonus; I give it a quick rinse after each use, which beats repeatedly buying paper filters and tossing them.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing it to models like the Black+Decker 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, there are trade-offs. The Black+Decker offers programmability, making it a great choice for those valuing convenience and automation. However, its more complex interface could overwhelm users who prefer simplicity. Cuisinart‚Äôs models often provide richer tastes and higher durability, yet they often come at double or triple the price, making affordability an issue. Where the Mr. Coffee SK12-RB excels is its straightforwardness and no-frills value proposition. While it does lack a few modern conveniences, its affordability and reliable brewing performance easily overshadow these absences for budget-conscious coffee drinkers.

**Cost Efficiency**  
This coffee maker won‚Äôt burn a hole in your wallet. For its features and straightforward reliability, it strikes an ideal balance between cost and quality. Across similar price brackets, many models either compromise on build quality or skip key features entirely, but the Mr. Coffee SK12-RB includes just the essentials you need. It‚Äôs a practical choice for first-time coffee maker owners, dorm rooms, or even as a backup unit.

1mcetdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeTested/comments/1mcetdi/explore_best_french_press_coffee_maker_espro_p7/,Explore Best French Press Coffee Maker ESPRO P7 Review Worth It,"**A Compact Introduction to the ESPRO 1032C2 P7**  
There‚Äôs something uniquely satisfying about brewing coffee in a French press, and the ESPRO 1032C2 P7 takes that experience to another level. This polished stainless steel French press stands out not only because of its aesthetic appeal but also due to its impeccable engineering. I put it through its paces, experimenting with everything from brewing a rich coffee to making aromatic tea infusions, and I‚Äôll be honest‚Äîit delivers a pretty exceptional cup. That being said, it‚Äôs not without a few quirks, which I‚Äôll touch on throughout this review.  

**Design That Speaks Elegance and Functionality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the design. Shiny, polished stainless steel with a sturdy feel, the ESPRO P7 is a pleasure to hold and operate. It‚Äôs double-walled, so I never had to worry about my coffee losing heat mid-pour. Whether I was brewing my early-morning pick-me-up or prepping for an impromptu tea session with friends in the afternoon, this French press stayed hot and ready. At 6.37"" in diameter and 10.4"" in height, it‚Äôs compact enough for storage but large enough to serve a small group, boasting a 32-ounce capacity.  

[Check ESPRO 1032C2 price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b011wtmh4o/)  

**Double Micro-Mesh Filters: The Star Feature**  
The filtration system genuinely impressed me. Unlike generic French presses where you‚Äôre often left with stray coffee grounds in your cup, this one comes equipped with a double micro-mesh filter. After testing with different grinds, from coarse to medium-fine, I got consistently smooth, grit-free coffee every single time. It even handled loose tea leaves exceptionally well, ensuring nothing unpleasant ended up in the cup.  

**Brewing Experience and Ease of Use**  
Being a manual operation coffee maker, it leans heavily on the user‚Äôs technique. As someone who fiddles a lot with their coffee routine, I appreciated its forgiving nature. The permanent filter is reusable, allowing you to brew without the ongoing expense of paper filters. Filling, pressing, and pouring went smoothly, proving its well-thought-out design. I gave it a stress test by brewing back-to-back batches for a family brunch, and the performance was robust. It felt like this device could effortlessly keep up with my daily habit.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Smooth, grit-free coffee and tea thanks to the double filter  
- Double-walled design keeps beverages hot for a longer period  
- Durable polished stainless steel body with attractive aesthetics  
- Easy-to-clean reusable filter and minimal coffee sludge  

**Drawbacks**  
Admittedly, there were minor issues.  
- The weight may take some getting used to since it‚Äôs built with solid materials (2.7 pounds).  
- The double filter system requires regular, careful cleaning to maintain its efficiency.  
- Priced at a premium, it might not fit within everyone‚Äôs budget.  

**How Does It Stack Up Against Competitors?**  
I‚Äôve owned and used quite a few French presses over the years, including the Bodum Chambord and the Frieling French press. Compared to the ESPRO P7, the Bodum lacks the grit-free smoothness that ESPRO achieves so effortlessly. And while the Frieling matches the P7 in its stainless steel design, its insulation doesn‚Äôt keep your coffee as hot for as long as the ESPRO does. Where the P7 surpasses both its competitors is in its unique double filter, which is practically a game changer for those who despise sediment lingering at the bottom of their coffee cups.  

**Value Proposition**  
For anyone serious about their coffee or tea, the ESPRO 1032C2 P7 feels like a thoughtful investment. You‚Äôre not only gaining a French press but a piece of equipment built to last for years. While the upfront cost is higher compared to standard presses, the engineering, durability, and quality you‚Äôre getting are absolutely worth it. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôd call smart spending for coffee enthusiasts.

Reliving the same day over and over without any way to stop it, begging people to listen to your pleas as you make a fool of yourself as your coworker orders the same exact coffee with the same exact cadence at the same exact time, right down to the second. But that's not the scenario that I'm experiencing.

Every month has been the same for me. Every month I've experienced the same issue, just repackaged with a different cast of characters. I began to notice this in January. Ever since I was a kid it has been the same dramas, the same conversations, the same people coming to me with problems of their own which I have had experience with therefore I've been able to help them with just by regurgitating the same advice over and over again. I swear I'm either being watched by the masses for entertainment, to watch my reactions and to get a rise out of me, or there is some cosmic being out there preparing me for the infinite of hell.

The only way out of this is to die. I traced back my memories to when this started as a kid, and I can only recollect it all beginning after a suicide attempt at 13. I feel like me trying to kill myself ticked someone or something off to me being the prime candidate for whatever sick song and dance this is. Therefore, they've piled ailments through me as a way to top things off.

Memory issues, dissociative disorders, chronic illness, mood issues, all ways to remind me that I am the common denominator in everything and that it is all my fault. I don't know what I did wrong to deserve this, and I want to understand why I've been cursed to live this cyclical torture labyrinth of a life, but I have no more energy.

I wake up. Go to work. Depending on my day at work, there are multiple of the same outcome. Good day at work? My friends are absent and want nothing to do with me. Bad day at work? Everyone brings up something that beats me while I'm down. Then I spiral and spiral, because as soon as I communicate, they realize they can't use me like a doll anymore and throw me away like trash. I'm only ever obsessed over, never cared for, never truly loved.

Another possibility is that I believe I may be dead already, or at least I am in the process of rotting. I'm not sure how, but I'm only here on this plane as a way to experience further torment due to something in a previous life.

Despite being exposed to a lot of Japan growing up Sumo i dunno seemed like an odd sport that old japanese men watched. I was a kid who didnt like wrestling or sports of any kind lets be real, so sumo just a thing that popped up every once in a while.

Fast forward 25+ years and suddenly out of nowhere youtube says ""HEY AWKWAD GAIJIN ON YOUTUBE WANNA FEEL CONNECTED TO JAPAN AGAIN?"" ok youtube ""thing japan"" what are you showing me now...

Sumo huh? havent seen that since I was 10.

""[Amazing Small Sumo Wrestlers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=108RuWXMly0&pp=ygUlTGl0dGxlIHN1bW8gd3Jlc3RlcmxlcnMgc2xheWluZyBnaWFudA%3D%3D)"" huh.

So I clicked it.

Oh... how exiting to watch. I wonder who this is(clicked on sumo stew)... ""don don sumo"".  
oh wait you can watch this live on nhk?

oh wait he's handsome... ""chiyo no.. fuji""

WAIT A SEC WHY IS THIS ENTERTAINING TO A 35 YEAR OLD WOMAN?!

I started watching all of this sumo stuff and yet could not find the the answer to the question ""Why do I find this so entertaining?"" I hate sports. There is exactly 1 sport I like watching, Motorcycle racing.

But you know what else I loved watching? Dota 2 Ti international. I dont even play dota, but I love watching the Ti every year. It's like my Superbowl.

\^That is where it hit me. No wonder I like sumo, it's a dead ringer for a real life kind of design you'd expect of a competitive video game.  
Despite what all the call of doody doofuses and what not say, one of the reasons why a competitive game is interested is because it begins on a fantastica premise, call of duty for example it's guns and military lore. Fantasy scifi guns and bad ass soldiers and operators.  
People like their lore in their games and the weird little traditions that pop up because of how the developers created the game to work as a set of rituatals and ideas that pervey the feel and design of the sport being captured.

Ding Ding there it is.

Sumo is like a real life version of an esports game. A potentially deeply boring concept of 1v1 turned into a beautiful performance of entertainement and incredible skill that gets to be broadcast to the world and captures the drama of human competition.  
Sumo is full of these things that give flare color and interest.  
There are real people who present as characters and incredible entertainers, there's literal mountains of ""lore"" to learn about your favorite rikishi, the game itself, and ofc Japan that it represents.  
When a Rikishi has to wear traditional clothing all the time, it makes them almost auspicious, like a hero character in a game, but a real person that can be looked up to.

If you've never seen a pro tournament/Ti match of dota2, it may be very hard to understand the comparison, but many esports are full of things that are akin to the entertainment experience of sumo.

Dota 2 is full of tons of small little things that seem like tradition, the way things must happen the way they must be. Players and heroes all characters their own in a dance to see who is truly the best in the world.

The presentation, the ideas of what sumo is as a viewer feels to me, like a dead on equivalent to watching my favorite Esports.  
Watching a fight for first blood(getting the very first kill in an esports match) and seeing who scores it is like seeing a tachiai wondering seeing betting who might win off of it. Can one snowball off first blood? Can you turn the taichiai into the win you need for your kachi-koshi? I can't wait to see.  
  
And then the creators around it seem to behave quite a bit like esports fans.... better in manyways so far that I've seen, but the analytics and match uploads and being able to discuss things, many fans here in this community(reddit and beyond) seem to be quite a bit like esports fans.

I've never learned so much about kinda anything real life as fast as I learned things about sumo and its because of the dedicated esports like fan base. Hell I've even been able to chat lightly with Japanese speaking fans online because of the Shikona getting me to look up kanji meanings again, and I'm now I'm refreshing my japanese(turns out you lose a 2nd language if you dont use it).

It's all so entertaining sure, but maybe inspirational, motivational, you feel almost apart of it as the drama of each day of the basho passes by. It reminds me of the reasons why I loved watching esports.

You can look at my post history and see my last post for more context in why I‚Äôd like to branch out(but I‚Äôm not leaving tech). I think tech is cool but I don‚Äôt want to just do technology and that‚Äôs all. I always wanted to be on the tech+business side. I only care about technology to the extent that it can help people, and I have no problem starting my own business or consulting firm if need be. I think business is exciting just like tech is exciting. I‚Äôm not leaving tech. 

I just do NOT like being told to just build build build someone else‚Äôs dream on someone else‚Äôs deadlines with no ownership of anything I‚Äôm making and no real say for like the first five + years of my career. I don‚Äôt want to just be a developer and coding in itself is NOT what I‚Äôm passionate about, I think it‚Äôs just annoying and gives me anxiety when deadlines come close or people are watching me and judging me. Leetcode scares me when I sleep at night. So clearly the usual senior and then tech lead progression may not be for me since that‚Äôs just way more code. 

Here‚Äôs what interests me:

Managing people. I like people. I like seeing them grow and I‚Äôm passionate about that to a certain degree. 

Closing million dollar deals like in the movies

Doing some Y combinator startup stuff, growing startups, but not necessarily making one myself if that makes sense

Leading initiatives in ethical directions

Knowing the full scope and business value / impact of what we‚Äôre building

I want to be that suit and tie dude, not really the t shirt with an ‚ÄúI love code‚Äù coffee cup and a beer belly type dude if that makes sense. 

I‚Äôm doing it online. WGU. 10k total cost. But it would delay me buying a home and getting married by over a year. Possibly two if life happens. I kinda wanted to get married at 24-25 instead of 26+ as I want some room to just be married and chill with no kids if that makes sense.

So scale of 1-10, how much is an mba necessary for me personally?

1mcefnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1mcefnm/does_the_kidisle_single_serve_coffee_maker_truly/,Does the KIDISLE Single Serve Coffee Maker Truly Simplify Your Morning Routine?,"Crafting morning coffee has always been a sacred ritual in my household, and trying out the KIDISLE CM9429D - UL made me reconsider my current setup. This compact coffee maker boasts versatility with its 3-in-1 functionality, catering to K-Cups, ground coffee, and tea lovers alike. As someone who craves variety without cluttering the countertop, I was intrigued by its promises to deliver both convenience and a quality brew. While it impressed me in many areas, a few quirks stood out during my hands-on experience.

**Design and Space Efficiency**  
Right out of the box, the first thing I noticed was how sleek and compact this machine is. With dimensions of 8‚ÄùD x 4‚ÄùW x 10‚ÄùH, it takes up minimal countertop space‚Äîideal for smaller kitchens or offices. It‚Äôs narrower than most coffee makers I‚Äôve tried, fitting snugly between my blender and toaster without looking out of place. The black finish gives it a modern vibe, and it pairs well with almost any kitchen aesthetic. However, the plastic exterior, while lightweight, doesn‚Äôt feel as robust as other premium machines I‚Äôve used. It‚Äôs not a dealbreaker for me, but it‚Äôs worth noting for those who value durability.

**Brewing Customization and Options**  
This machine's standout feature is its 3-in-1 brewing function. It comes with two adaptors and a reusable capsule, making it compatible with standard K-Cups, loose ground coffee, and tea leaves. I tested all three options over the course of a week, switching between my favorite dark roast K-Cups, Darjeeling tea, and freshly ground coffee beans. The convenience of having a reusable capsule is a blessing for both the environment and my wallet, even though it requires a bit more cleaning effort. The self-cleaning mode is a nice touch‚Äîpressing ‚ÄúSIZE‚Äù and ‚ÄúBREW‚Äù simultaneously enabled a thorough rinse, which I relied on every couple of days.

[Find the best price for KIDISLE CM9429D - UL on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b0dhclg55h/)

**Personalization and Cup Sizes**  
Whether I wanted a quick 6 oz shot to jolt me awake or a 14 oz travel mug fill for a long drive, this coffee maker had me covered with its five brew sizes. I found the control buttons intuitive enough, though the LED indicators could‚Äôve been brighter, especially when brewing early in dim conditions. The removable drip tray is another thoughtful feature, easily accommodating mugs up to 7.2‚Äù tall. Taller travel mugs didn‚Äôt pose any problems, but oversized thermoses might not fit perfectly, which others might find limiting.

**Perks**  
- The reusable coffee filter reduces waste and additional K-Cup purchases.  
- Variety of brewing options keeps it versatile for families or workplaces with diverse preferences.  
- Auto-cleaning functionality simplifies maintenance significantly.   

**Shortcomings**  
- The plastic build feels somewhat lightweight and might not endure heavy daily usage for years.  
- Brewing takes slightly longer compared to high-end machines, especially for larger cups.  
- Noise levels during brewing are more noticeable than quieter premium models.

**Performance and Taste**  
Performance-wise, I found the brews consistent, though not groundbreaking. The machine provided a bold and well-rounded cup, particularly with the ground coffee option. K-Cups worked seamlessly, and I appreciated not having to wait for extensive preheating as it got started in under a minute. The primary letdown was the brew temperature, which, while hot enough for immediate consumption, may feel lukewarm to those who enjoy piping-hot drinks. I noticed my tea cooled down faster than expected, even when using preheated mugs.

**Market Rivals**  
I‚Äôve used similar single-serve brewers like the Keurig K-Mini and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, which target the same demographic. Compared to the Keurig, this one falls slightly short in build quality and speed, though it outshines in cost-effectiveness and added tea compatibility. As for the FlexBrew, the functionality overlaps significantly; however, the KIDISLE CM9429D wins for its more space-saving design and user-friendly self-cleaning feature. Still, heavy coffee enthusiasts who want intense customization might lean towards pricier alternatives.

**Money's Worth**  
At its price point, this machine feels like a thoughtful purchase for anyone who wants variety without shelling out for multiple gadgets. It justifies every penny by combining three brewing methods, five sizes, and travel-friendly features into one compact unit. While high-end setups might offer faster brew times and better durability, this coffee maker focuses on versatility and accessibility. It‚Äôs not a luxury appliance, but for everyday users, it gets the job done with flair.

My adult son who I solely raised with his sister due to being a young widow has been dating/in a relationship with a girl who I literally despise. She lacks motivation, is messy/dirty, controlling and physically extremely unattractive. 
I‚Äôve had a wonderful life with my son prior to this relationship but now it seems like it may be at the end . That alone breaks my heart but currently I‚Äôm more concerned about him and his future wellbeing. Her lease was running out back in march or so and the current roommates she had were moving on in different directions so she couldn‚Äôt afford a new place by herself and I made the fatal mistake of agreeing to let her stay with us until she got on her feet. I didn‚Äôt know her very well at that point but when we discussed it I stated I could really use some help around the house from time to time and thought maybe I‚Äôd get to know her better. We ultimately made an agreement for a very small amount of rent and I‚Äôd be giving her the guest room but instead she simply threw some of her stuff in there and has since stayed in my sons room the entire time-whatever he‚Äôs old enough to navigate that himself if it bothered him. The bigger problems are things like all the rest of her things she simply threw in my living room and not in any organized way I may add. She doesn‚Äôt clean up after herself and has clothes thrown in every part of my home. 
She also treats  this like it‚Äôs a hotel room by using my dishes/cookware then just leaving it for someone else (me) to clean at a later time. In addition to using all my paper products/laundry detergent etc etc. At the very last minute as she was moving in she brings two cats into my house. Mind you I don‚Äôt have any pets nor was I interested in having any. I did that for many years while my kids were young. 
I talked with my son privately about most of these issues early on since I knew he‚Äôd be upset if I addressed her directly as I‚Äôm a pretty blunt and direct person who doesn‚Äôt mix my words much. He claimed he‚Äôd talk to her and I don‚Äôt know if this ever happened or not but nothing changed. We talked several other times with the same results. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt take having her continuing to leech off of me while simultaneously destroying my home and my peace daily and told him it wasn‚Äôt working out and she‚Äôd need to find somewhere else to live. 
He didn‚Äôt take this well and asked me for more time so ‚Äúthey‚Äù could figure something out. I didn‚Äôt agree or disagree and simply reiterated that she had to go. She works at a coffee shop part time while he‚Äôs started his career already so there a significant financial gap between them as well. She got fired from her last coffee job for stealing from the company I might add. 
Also has no relationship with either parent for reasons I don‚Äôt know and never pressed about. I can possibly see why now though. The sheer entitlement and lack of respect are so extreme I wish I could explain better. 
Now that some months have passed she‚Äôs convinced him that he needs to move with her so she can afford to live somewhere. This caused a significant increase in tension between my son and I because he had a well thought out plan to work his new salary job for several years while still living at home to be able to save a lot of money towards the purchase of a home at some point. I put him through college with no debt to him so all his money could‚Äôve been being stashed away which I was 100% behind this plan. 
Now anytime I bring up how I feel he‚Äôs being manipulated or used and taken advantage of he gets upset and tells me I‚Äôm just on a power trip or am a control freak amongst other mean and disrespectful words. 
I‚Äôm not trying to pat myself on the back here but I‚Äôve been nothing but supportive his entire life and provided him the best possible childhood I van imagine anyone having. Bought him his first and second cars etc etc. 
Moving day is quickly approaching and he doesn‚Äôt even barely speak to me anymore when it used to be a multiple times a day thing. He specifically won‚Äôt talk to me at all when she‚Äôs in the house. I don‚Äôt know how I can support something I see as such a poor and problematic decision he‚Äôs making and don‚Äôt know what or even how to navigate this from here. 
I should mention this is not a no girl  is Good enough for my son situation either as he‚Äôs had previous relationships with no issues here. 
I realize he‚Äôs an adult and can make his own choices and reap the consequences of them and is probably doing just that. I still pay for a lot of little things for both of my adult kids and am wondering if I should cut him off of everything if he chooses to be so disrespectful to me. Cell phone, triple a membership, Amazon account and things of that nature. He also wants to continue to store most of his many many things in my home still after moving out. 
Since I told him she needed to go, she‚Äôd never spoken a single word to me in my house and that‚Äôs been several months yet has no issues using my laundry soap, paper products and many cooking ingredients. Unfortunately fairly often my son has to go away overnight for work leaving her and I alone in the house for long periods of awkward times where I find myself staying in my bedroom just to avoid her at all costs, like a prisoner in my own home. 
The last I‚Äôll add is I‚Äôve caught her stealing my things multiple times and she doesn‚Äôt even know I know. I‚Äôm trying to be neutral in telling  this  story in its full unbiased light and I know that‚Äôs hard but I‚Äôm giving the facts and not all of my personal feelings. One being that she‚Äôs severely obese while he‚Äôs a very fit healthy young man who was raised to understand the importance of physical activity and a healthy diet. I don‚Äôt use that in a disparaging way or even to talk to him about the actual problems in the situation as I understand  that‚Äôs his choice. 
I guess I‚Äôm at a loss on how or if to continue trying to keep some kind of relationship with my son and how with her in the picture. He‚Äôs  paying for the first, last and security deposit for the apartment and I just see him getting so financially screwed over by this and it‚Äôs so hard to watch. Not to mention everything I offer him for his new apartment has to be approved and acceptable to her weird taste and standards. 
Any advice is greatly welcome and appreciated as I‚Äôm at my wits end after 32 months of raising kids and putting all of my needs last. ",0,1753802586.0,AskWomenOver50,22,0.25,False

July 23, 2025

# The Coffee Cherry

Have you ever wondered how your morning cup of coffee starts its journey? Let's take a closer look at the humble beginnings of the coffee cherry and how it's grown to perfection.

# What is a Coffee Cherry?

Before it becomes your favorite brew, coffee starts as a cherry on a coffee plant. These cherries are small, round fruits that turn from green to bright red when they are ripe and ready for harvesting.

# Where are Coffee Cherries Grown?

Coffee cherries thrive in tropical climates, typically grown in countries near the equator known as the ""Coffee Belt."" Countries like Brazil, Colombia, Ethiopia, and Vietnam are some of the top coffee producers in the world.

# How are Coffee Cherries Harvested?

Harvesting coffee cherries is a labor-intensive process. Farmers often pick the cherries by hand to ensure that only the ripest ones are selected. This meticulous process is crucial to the quality of the coffee beans.

# What Happens After Harvesting?

Once the coffee cherries are harvested, they go through processing to extract the coffee bean inside. There are two main methods of processing: the dry method, where the cherries are dried in the sun, and the wet method, where the cherries are pulped and fermented.

# How are Coffee Cherries Transformed into Coffee?

After processing, the coffee beans are roasted to perfection. The roasting process is where the beans develop their distinct flavor profile and aromas. From light to dark roasts, each roast level brings out the different characteristics of the coffee like the 41+ premium coffees available from HomeBrewCoffee.com‚Ñ¢.

So, next time you savor your morning cup of coffee, take a moment to appreciate the journey of the coffee cherry. From lush coffee plantations to your favorite coffee mug, each step in the process plays a vital role in bringing you that perfect brew. Enjoy!

I have been brewing coffee for almost 8-10yrs now. Not a full blown coffee connesoiur as most of us here but fairly passionate about coffee.

Starting my coffee journey with aeropress, I eventually procured the French Press, V60 and my latest addition, Moka Pot.

Realising that I really enjoy the concentrated coffee i get from my moka pot, I have been saving up to enter the espresso game.

Obviously, flair has been on my radar for a long time and now that i am reaching my purchase decision i am confused over which one to get. 

Most reviews that i have read have me skeptical about thermal efficiency of the machines and I am unable to judge the best value deal.

Requesting and relying on the community's expertise to guide me on the same.

  
**My view:**

I am seriously considering the pro2. From what i gather, pro3 has the preheating funnel (for which i can use my aeropress funnel) and shot mirror (for which i can angle my phone and front camera view). I hear thermal efficiency is also better on the pro3 but i am not entirely sure about it.

There is also a certain extent of FOMO that i am feeling by not considering the flair 58 however, given the price point. I am not too excited about it. I would much rather invest that additional amount on a good quality manual grinder like the commadante or the 1zpresso.

NeverMore‚Äô Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

For as long as Christina Ricci‚Äô a forty five year old brown eyed, dark haired girl! Having the attitude to match! Along with her gothic charm, that was all about her a charm that set her apart from other girls. But for as long as she could always remember, remember having a fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her in the dark a place that was often familiar with her. 

Often finding herself just wanting to be alone, for her fascination for dark mysterious men. Men that would often leave her more times than she cared to admit to wanting more. Desiring More, more than they could offer her, leaving her with a burning desire to find more than they could give her. 

As Christina‚Äô stood there her long dark hair covering over her eyes as the wind blew around her. Bringing with it the sounds of night, Christina‚Äô never a girl to dress to impress, more then less finding herself in a pair of stone washed jeans and black tee. To match her personality, a girl who felt like she didn‚Äôt have to impress anyone. 

Just that if someone wanted her, then it was up to them to impress her, which would often leave her desiring more than they gave her. But as the sounds of the night grew quiet, another sound would then echo through the air. As a Raven then flew by her, saying to her

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Looking out into the night looking deep into a fog covered area revealing only shadows. But as Christina‚Äô continued to look into the fog a man from deep within it would emerge, lurking from within its grasps, As he just stood there all dressed up in a long dark tailcoat gothic style cost. With his dark curly hair and goatee. Just standing there looking over to her. Just as the Raven then flew by Christina‚Äô once again saying 

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Just as the mysterious man then said to Christina‚Äô 

‚ÄúWhy go ahead my dear, and you just say the words! And we shall go from there.‚Äù

For some words where never meant to be spoken but as we shall later see that some unsuspecting people would say the words 

‚Äú Who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

Just as he then vanished back into the foggy night, leaving Christina‚Äô even more curious more than ever now. A curiosity that would leave her knowing more than she ever desired, Standing there running her fingers through her dark hair, Knowing that she had always been surrounded by Dark mysterious men for their presence alone always brought Christina‚Äô wanting to know more. More than they could ever give her. Always finding herself being drawn closer to them by wanting to be with them.

Always wanting to find the darker side of a person, while at the same time not always understanding them. But always finding herself amongst them loving them even if it left her in the dark. If it was for a night of hard sex, Or just finding herself hanging out with them. Looking for the darker side of them. 

But for her, that fascination would leave her in feeling more than words one can say. Or at least one can try to say, But as the night grew longer, as the fog became more deeper in closing her around in it. Our story begins here, for Legend has it that on that day in 1849‚Äô when after five days that when they first found him. Being the one and only 

Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô

It is said that the cause of his death remains unknown, But it is said that on the night of when they first found him. That if one, Or others were to stand at his grave and chant the words 

‚ÄúWho Killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äô‚Äù

That they just might find out! But as Christina‚Äô stood there hearing the sounds of darkness echo all around her, along with the sounds of the Raven‚Äô off in the distance hearing it call for her

Seeing as the fog would begin to in close on her, With her now seeing nothing but the dimming of a street light off in the distance. But as she looked closer, The same figure was now standing there up underneath the street light. Standing there with a mysterious draw to him, with Christina‚Äô now finding herself being drawn in by him. 

Standing there as the sounds of a Raven‚Äô Could be heard as it flew by her once again as if it was beckoning for her to come. To be and be with him, as Christina‚Äô just stood there looking at a dark figure wearing a long dark gothic style tailcoat. Feeling him beckoning for her to come to him. 

As he just stood there directly in front of her, hearing the sounds of the Raven‚Äô calling out her name. As the darkness grew even more around her, But as quickly as he had come, He was now once more hidden back into the fog from which he had come. As Christina‚Äô now stood there looking at a gravestone. Not just any gravestone, But being that of a one Edgar Allen Poe‚Äô

As Christina‚Äô could hear the Raven‚Äô crowing into the nights air. With her just standing there looking out into the forever of the darkness of the night. Up underneath a starless nights sky. But if one was to wish upon a star, it would be for one more night for her. One more night to feel him once more. To feel his hands once again up against her, Showing her the feeling that she had yarned for. As her heart was now pounding for more, knowing that once with him Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her.

Standing there trying her best to think back on what happened the last five days. Even contemplating to herself, If she really even cared. For they had made their own choice in doing this. But regardless it was Five days, that she will never forget, 

For they will be NeverMore in this world, for the Raven had came for them he had came for them. Never more to know him, to know of his name. For insane to world he had become to a world in which wanted to know 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe, 

And that just wasn‚Äôt good enough for Christina‚Äô as she stood there thinking to herself, Should she say it. Should she say the words, For her fascination with dark mysterious men would definitely end with him. But dam! If He could make her feel that way one more time, Then death! Just Bring your ass on! For Christina‚Äô was ready, ready for whatever happens even if it was for her to be

NeverMore

But a girl could always dream, but not this girl! Hell no! For she wanted more than just dreams of him. She wanted to feel him again even if it was to be

NeverMore

But as she stood there thinking to herself! Should she say?

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe?‚Äù

But Christina‚Äô being a dark haired girl, Having that gothic charm about her leaving others wanting to know more about her. But never to please her the way that she wanted them to. But Christina‚Äô Knew that she was going to get what she wanted. With her even knowing what happened five nights ago, though she could have never dreamed of anything of this ever happening to anyone. But hey! They asked for it! And she was a girl with needs! Needs that needed to be filled! By the one who could have her being 

NeverMore! As the Raven flew by saying 

NeverMore 

But for now shall we go back to five nights prior, Five nights ago when it all started. But the story will not be starting at night, but that morning, after waking up from a good night of sex. Sex that Christina‚Äô was looking forward to, But still leaving her not feeling completely satisfied.

As she lay there thinking to herself, Was it good Enough? But as usual! Finding herself waking up to an half empty bed beside her. For her so called lover! If one could even can call him that! But to her, After a good night of fucking for him Just wasn‚Äôt enough for her. Guessing that‚Äôs why her so called lover! Would always show his ass the door before she could. Always finding them gone by morning gone before waking up, as she lay there looking up to the ceiling saying 

‚ÄúI swear! Guys these days! Just want to get there dicks wet then split!‚Äù

Always just to leave her just to finish the rest of the job herself! it‚Äôs like goodbye! Thanks for the fuck! More like a smack on my ass! And a kiss on my cheek! Was there way of Telling me! Hey your ass and the ride was great! But dam! This girl needs more than just a dick and a smack on her ass. 

But hey! If you can find a guy who can say more than a words! And do more than just fuck! It‚Äôs like hey! my ass is all they want to talk to! Well next time! My ass is going to be doing a hell of lot more talking! If the sounds of my farts is all that they want hear as they fuck me! Then so be it! 

For if they leave me wanting more! Then I‚Äôm just going to blow some wind in there face! And tell them to not let the dam door hit them on their ass on the way out. They can just leave! If they leave me unfinished and not filled! But hey sometimes a touch can go much further them one knows. 

I mean hell! If I could get just one guy wanting to touch more than my ass! As he fucks me! Then leaves knowing that his little cock got all up in me! Dam! What is a girl to do just get a touch nowadays, 

For God knows a girl wants more than just a smack on the ass! But it wouldn‚Äôt be God that answered her! But someone much darker! To match her gothic style, Leaving her feeling like a girl that has been fulfilled. And occasional holding would be nice, But I guess that would be asking too much, For in a way Christina‚Äô would always leave herself wishing for more.

But when darkness is all she knows then there just isn‚Äôt much room left for love! Only sex! But God knows when she will get fully filled again maybe another week or two. Whenever the need for someone to fuck her again kicks in.

Now finding herself getting out of bed seeing the light of day peering into her room like a perv! It wanted to see more of her standing there with her nude ass and all to see! But with a quick pull of the shade and out you go. 

Walking into the bathroom as Christina‚Äô stood there looking into the mirror, looking at herself, Slowly sliding her hand through her dark hair. Knowing dam well that she could do much better than the guys around her. 

Standing there looking at 45 year old girl, Wondering to herself 45 and only a fuck buddy! Well the fuck buddy needs to fuck a hell of lot better! Because if I‚Äôm going to give someone my inside! Then they dam well better feel me up all through the night! But being on her own isn‚Äôt so bad. It gives her the freedom to be free, To be her

Deciding to finally to get dressed for the day, a little dark eye liner here and there! slapping on a pair of stone washed cut at the knees jeans! Along with a black shirt to go with it. This gothic girl was ready for whatever the day would bring to her! And bring it would in a way that would leave her Not forgetting anytime soon. Not forgetting about the shoes, A pair a converses, And with that, To venture into whatever finds her. And find her something would, Something that she could have never imagined that would be. But imagined is beyond belief, This was beyond death itself. 

Making her way out the door of her apartment here the usual get the hell out! From her neighbor, I guess she didn‚Äôt get her feel either, Not even making it off of her floor. When she then came upon a scene that would forever leave her asking? Is death even dead?

Coming to the end of the hallway seeing a couple of cops standing there, standing there with their dicks in their hands as usual around here. Standing there just outside of jimmy‚Äôs apartment. Jimmy‚Äô was someone that she would talk to every now and then, not as friends. But more like a neighbor. 

For Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit, Some Very dark shit. That often had Christina‚Äô questioning at times. As she then stopped to ask one of the officers, just long enough for him to quit holding his dick in his hands. If anything had happened but as usual the dicks just didn‚Äôt know what ass to look or go up. 

Only knowing the hookers ass around the corner, And not really to her surprise the officer didn‚Äôt know dick. As he just told me that the landlord had found jimmy dead. As Christina‚Äô then thought to herself 

‚ÄúWell no shit! How about you get your dick out of your hands and actually do some detective shit!‚Äù

But that was just too much to ask, but apparently someone had Murdered! Jimmy‚Äô sometime in the night, but who? Officer dick sure wasn‚Äôt going to find out, who murdered Jimmy. The only the thing they were finding was their lunch. But as Christina‚Äô then walked by the opened door she could see Jimmy‚Äôs body lying there all covered on the floor. With blood all on the floor. But Not being unnerved enough by that, bit what was just above him, written on the wall was the words written 

NeverMore

Just then as a Raven‚Äô flew into an open window landing on it‚Äôs bottom frame as it the crowed 

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Like she said, Jimmy‚Äô was into some serious, dark shit. Walking on past making her way outside, where she would then run into another guy. Someone that Christina‚Äô didn‚Äôt mind talking to every now and then, that also lived here.

His name was Johnny‚Äô a dark skinned guy, always in his leather black jacket. Sunny outside or not, he was wearing that jacket. With his eyes and hair to match he was someone that Christina‚Äô would often find herself talking to, in a way often finding herself wanting to get close at times. 

But he already had someone, as Christina‚Äô then thought to her herself, at least Johnny‚Äô knew how to please someone. But as Christina‚Äô then walked up to him asking if he had heard anything of what happened to Jimmy‚Äô With Johnny only giving a snark remark! Saying to her! 

‚ÄúLook! I don‚Äôt know! Johnny was into some shady shit and stuff! More than likely a drug debt!‚Äù 

With Christina‚Äô then looking to him saying to him in also in a snarky remark 

‚ÄúLook. I know! Well sorta knew Jimmy‚Äô much more she should have known about him. And that he wasn‚Äôt into drugs Johnny‚Äô he was into some serious dark shit! But not drugs, but you don‚Äôt have to be so snarky you know‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her, as he then threw his cigarette onto the ground as he said then said to her

‚ÄúLook! The other night me and Jimmy and four other people, who I didn‚Äôt know who they were, well we went down to the Graveyard the other night. And when you said that Jimmy was into some dark shit you wasn‚Äôt kidding. I only went along for the ride! But him and the other ones was there for something else!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then replying 

‚ÄúSomething else! What do you mean something else!‚Äù

As Johnny just stared at her giving her a look of disbelief! Before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

As Christina‚Äô then looked back at him curious like then saying 

‚ÄúWhat! What do you mean? Who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

As Johnny always acting the cool guy just looked to Christina‚Äô saying to her 

‚ÄúYeah that! We was at his grave sight with some candles and shit! When they started to try to summon something by chanting!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, I was only along for the ride you know but who knows!‚Äù

But as Christina‚Äô then left Johnny to be! She then just made her way about the day, just wondering to what he had said. But Later that night as the darkness of the night was just beginning to set in. A moonless night at that, But as the darkness would come, so would the sounds of other things that night would follow with it. Followed by the sounds of the Raven‚Äô saying to her

NeverMore 

As Christina‚Äô stood there on the roof looking out into the city landscape, still thinking of what Johnny had said to her. Just as a guy off in the distance was just a shredding away on his guitar. Knowing that darkness was coming for someone that night leaving them to be

NeverMore 

As the Raven flew through the night, But deep down within the city we find a young dark haired guy, named Chang‚Äô wearing jeans and a jacket, just making his way out from a corner coffee shop. Carrying a laptop from which he had been working on his novel, but unfortunately for him, a little chanting her had done just a couple of nights ago. Asking 

Who killed Edgar Allan Poe

But as just as Chang‚Äô then turned a corner hearing a voice say to him

‚ÄúFor insane I have became, Insane to a world in which wants to know who killed Edgar Allan Poe‚Äù

With Chang‚Äô now turning only to see a dark haired man with a goatee, wearing a gothic style black turn tail coat. Watching him as he then made his way from out of the darkened alley way. Asking Chang‚Äô

‚ÄúSo a writer I see you want to be, but how insane can you be! Or how insane do you wish to be‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúWho are you? And why do want to know about me wanting to be a writer?‚Äù

As the figure then said to Chang‚Äô 

‚ÄúIs it not I that you seek? To see how insane I have become to a world that wishes to know‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then replied back saying to him

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, is not I that I seek? I seek no one! Now leave me be!‚Äù

But as the figure then walked closer to Chang‚Äô saying to him

‚ÄúOh but you do, you seek to know how insane I have become! So now I will tell you!‚Äù

As Chang‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúTell me what!‚Äù

As the figure then replied back to Chang‚Äô saying 

Who killed Edgar Alan Poe

For dead he did indeed leave Chang‚Äô letting him know on how insane he had become to the world. For Chang‚Äô was now

NeverMore

But as her thoughts would go, so would the night. Leaving someone to be NeverMore! As the morning would come, with Christina‚Äô not really wanting to get up,deciding to lay there in her bed listening whatever was on the television. As her fingers just filled in the rest! 

But as she watched the morning news a segment would then catch her attention, and her attention it did. For they the news crew was at a scene of a murder that had happened last night. But as they were talking to the detective, some words would suddenly came into view, as the camera would then show the words. For written on the wall behind them were the words 

NeverMore

Quickly getting out of bed and getting herself dressed. Making her way down town, at least trying to make her way downtown without being harassed by a couple of guys wanting to know her ass. But as Christina‚Äô being the girl she was just turned around giving them the bird.

Just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by them saying to them

NeverMore

But on to the scene Christina‚Äô continued to make her way, to scene of the murder, of person with no head for it would never be found as they were NeverMore to world around them. As Christina‚Äô stood there looking at the words, just as a Raven‚Äô Then Flew by her landing on a railing, crowning

‚ÄúNeverMore‚Äù

Standing there now looking at the Raven‚Äô just as it then flew off into the day. Leaving the dead person to be, leaving him to a world that wished to know. But only leaving them to knowing 

NeverMore 

And Leaving Christina‚Äô now with more questions than answers, As Christina‚Äô then made her way back across town looking for Johnny with no luck. 

But as day turned into night! Finding herself standing on top of the roof of her building looking out into the city‚Äôs landscape. As the same guy was just a shredding away on his guitar. Thinking to herself there had to be a connection with the murders, But what! Or who? For as the next two nights would come. So would two more murders, Leaving them to be

NeverMore

With the same words written 

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

But as the dead of night would once again leave, 
Bringing with it a new day! Just not for some! Making her way out of her apartment and into the street. Where she would finally run into Johnny‚Äô! Making her way over to him kinda yelling at him asking him.  

‚ÄúThe four other people that was with you and Jimmy‚Äô were they the ones murdered the last three nights‚Äù

With Johnny just looking at her giving her his same snarky remark saying to her

‚ÄúLook! I was only along the ride! Those other five were there for some serious dark shit! But if you are so worried about me turning up murdered! Then you need not worry yourself toots‚Äù! 

With Christina‚Äô just standing there shaking her head at Johnny as I said to him

‚Äú Yeah well good luck with that shit Johnny!‚Äù

Leaving him to be, now going about her day waiting for the night to come, but darkness was never far away. as Christina‚Äô would wait to see if Johnny was right about that or not. But she just guessed  we shall find out soon enough. And soon enough she would leaving her feeling like no one has ever before.

Now Finding herself once again standing there on the roof thinking to herself! the bride once again to be! Looking out into the endless night. Thinking That there was going to be no honeymoon for her anytime soon! 

Standing there looking out into a city landscape of street lights glaring into the city‚Äôs night, Just as she then suddenly heard a sound behind her. Turning to only see an individual wearing a solid black gothic style tailcoat old school style, More like the turn of the century style 

With his face being hidden by the shadows of the night just as a Raven‚Äô then flew by her landing on the ledge beside her crowing

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù

Just as the individual standing there looking at her then said to her

‚ÄúI have became insane! to a world that wants to know!‚Äù More than they should know!‚Äù

‚ÄúBut For those who chose not to know, never to suffer would they! But instead! Never to been blessed by knowing me‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to know? My love!

As Christina‚Äô then said back to him

‚ÄúDo I want to know what‚Äù?

Laughing as he then walked closer to her revealing more of what she wanted to see! As the shadow of the night slowly left from his face. Revealing everything that she wanted to see! Leaving her wanted to know more! For standing there in front of her was a dark haired man around 40‚Äô with a goatee, wearing a solid long black tail coat. Wearing clothes not of this century 

Leaving Christina‚Äô more enticed than ever, Her eyes and heart were now set into place, with her now wanting more. More than she even dared herself to ask, But resist she could not! For there was just something mesmerizing about him that she wanted more off. A feeling of she needed him, a desire that she just could not hide anymore. Finding herself now wanting to know more of him that night. 

As he then smiled at her saying to her

Are you sure that you don‚Äôt want to know?

With her again asking him

‚Äúknow what?‚Äù

Knowing that she very much wanted to know more! To know everything about him! 

As he then laughed at me saying to me 

‚ÄúTo know me! Is to know Death! For I have become insane! But to those wishing to know more! I share not what one seeks! But choose instead to only show what one may desire to know‚Äù

And desired to know more Christina‚Äô did! Finding herself now coming closer to him, knowing that something about him was more than she wanted to know. But resist she could not! For his presence alone left her feeling it all up inside of her. 

As he then approached her slowly placing his hand on the side of her head, massaging his fingers slowly through her hair. Christina‚Äô was now fully engaged to wanting to know more! More of his touch! Her need to be filled was here and in a big way! And feel it! She very much was! Feeling his hand upon her, every desire of wanting to know more! Was now wanting more! 

As he then placed both of his hands on her head sliding them slowly through her hair, as Christina‚Äôs body was now ready for his touch. A touch that she had been yearning for. To show her what she had been looking for, With him now looking at her as he then said 

‚ÄúTo know more, is to desire what one wants to feel! And if you need is to feel? Then my desire is to know you.‚Äù

The desire was here, Christina‚Äô thoughts were here, my body was all his! And all he needed to do was feed my desire. The desire to feel every part of him!

Taking off his coat as he placed it on the ground, as he then looked to her placing his finger up to her lips. before saying to her 

‚Äú I know your desire! Now let me know you! 

Christina‚Äô was there! Her desire was now his to do with as he pleased! As he slowly slid his hand down the side of her face, sliding his fingers over  and under her shirt and across her chest! Christina‚Äô heart was pounding! Her body was there in complete control of his hands. Christina‚Äô could feel the sweat on her, ready for his body to be on her. 

For this girl might not be a bride to be, But for one night, She just may need a priest to exercise what ever he puts into her. For she was going to be screaming to the heavens above that hells fire was now burning inside of her, Feeling the heat from his touch, 

Feeling his lips slowly touching her, Pulling her closer feeling his chest up next to hers, With his hands slowly gliding across her back! She wanted this to last all night. To feel hells fire burn within her! As Her body was pulsating, To his very touch. A touch like no other to her. As he then slowly took off her shirt feeling his fingers slowly sliding across her breast! Feeling his breath as her body! now fully up against her as he then whispering to her ear. 

‚ÄúTonight my love I will know you as you desire!‚Äù

As the flames would ride higher! So would he! As he then slowly lay me down upon coat, sliding his hands through her hair. As Christina‚Äô body was now on fire from the inside! Feeling the burn of his touch inside of her, slowly sliding his hands across her chest. Feeling and teasing her nipples, the sweat pouring from her. 

As he then Massaged her breasts with his hands, with his tongue dancing and slowly gliding around all around her neck. Up to her Christina‚Äôs cheek, As Christina‚Äô lay there with her hands now firmly on him, pulling him tighter up against her. Feeling him rub all up against her, With her hands now slowly sliding down his back onto his ass feeling him. Rub himself all up and down her! Before slowly sliding his hands back across her stomach down to her pants. 

Looking at her as he then unzipped her pants sliding them off of her! As his fingers danced around in her! feeling his hands coming back up through her legs. Teasing her inside, as Christina held on! Feeling his breath on her neck as his fingers danced around in her. 

Before slowly Sliding his hands back  up her legs, slinging up to firmly grabbing a hold of her ass. As his tongue found its way all around her neck. Up and into her mouth, as his fingers danced away inside of her. 

Hell was definitely on fire that night! With his hand now firmly holding me against her, going in and out her. Feeling every finger as his hand danced around inside of her.

As he then raised back up taking off his shirt and pants! Just Before placing his body once again upon her. 

feeling his sweat as he then placed her hands around his back moving them up behind his head. 

Christina‚Äô could now feel every bit of him going deep inside of her! Her hands now firmly grabbing a hold of his back 

As the Devil was now looking up to Christina Ricci‚Äô saying

‚ÄúDam! I would give up hell just to be in her!‚Äù 

As there bodies were now becoming one, to the night!  as they then slowly made love on the roof not really caring if anyone was watching. For as the night went on so did he! For Christina‚Äô had never made love to anyone like she did to him that night. 

But as good things come, they also have to go! 

But just before he would disappear forever into back into the night, he then turned to Christina‚Äô asking her

‚ÄúDo you want to know?‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô now looking at him saying 

‚ÄúKnow what?

With him just looking at her before saying 

‚ÄúWho killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

With Christina‚Äô then asking 

‚ÄúWho!‚Äù

As he then just laughed as he said

‚ÄúI did!

‚ÄúI killed Edgar Allan Poe!‚Äù

As he then just looked at her laughing as he then just vanished into the night never to seen again.

As the Raven behind her once again crowed

‚ÄúNeverMore!‚Äù 

Just before it flew off into the night!

While him leaving her knowing that her every desire he did feel that night, leaving Christina‚Äô even more fascinated to find out more about him. Drawing her closer to him. For to know his love, his insanity, to feel him once more! is to know the darkness that he has become!

Leaving her now standing there on the roof thinking to herself what about Johnny? Did he kill Johnny?

But she guessed that she will just have to wait until the morning, But if so, then Johnny would be

NeverMore

Leaving Christina Ricci‚Äô then asking herself? Dose she now want to be 

NeverMore herself

I get my 2nd hcg test tomorrow and whewww.. im a bit worried","Hello, I am new to the reddit thing and have been googling like a maniac for a sliver of hope. (prepare for a bit of tmi) This is my first pregnancy and I have been told it would be difficult for me to have children and if I get pregnant, I would be high-risk due to me having pcos. After months and months of trying, I finally got multiple positives from at home tests. Well a few days ago, one early morning I noticed some light bleeding (TMI but it was more brown and light pink, sometimes resembling coffee grounds). I immediately went to the ER for testing. Urine and Blood came back positive for pregnancy. My HCG levels at the time were 1221. They did a transvaginal ultrasound and saw a gestational sack but no yolk and no fetal pole yet.

1mce9gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mce9gf/why_choose_geesta_charcoal_water_filters_for/,Why Choose Geesta Charcoal Water Filters for Cuisinart Coffee Machines Review?,"The Geesta Geesta09 12-Pack Replacement Charcoal Water Filters for use with Cuisinart coffee machines has become a staple in my kitchen ever since I decided to upgrade my coffee experience. Having tested this product daily for over a month, I‚Äôve formed some pretty concrete opinions about its strengths and areas that could use improvement. Whether you‚Äôre someone obsessively chasing the perfect cup of coffee or just looking to maintain the quality of your machine, these filters offer quite a lot‚Äîbut they come with a few caveats.

**Packaging and Design**  
What initially caught my attention was how thoughtfully these filters are packaged. Each one comes individually sealed, which not only ensures freshness but also prevents contamination. The protective box, which stores the filters, is a solid addition and makes storage neat and sanitary. The filters themselves are compact, perfectly sized to fit various Cuisinart coffee machine models, including the Grind & Brew and PerfecTemp series, without any trouble. Their sleek white exterior doesn't scream innovation, but their simplicity works.

**Ease of Use**  
Using these filters is straightforward, even for someone who isn‚Äôt particularly tech-savvy. Simply pop one into the designated compartment, and you‚Äôre good to go. I appreciate the included instructions, which provide clear guidance for those unsure about filter installation. Each filter lasts about two months or roughly 60 water tank refills, which matches the manufacturer's claims. Living in a hard water area, I did notice that the lifespan decreased slightly, but that‚Äôs an issue across all water filtration products in such conditions.

[Check Geesta Geesta09 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b06vwk3jgj/)

**Performance**  
As far as performance goes, these filters deliver what they promise. My coffee tasted noticeably fresher and cleaner within two days of the first use. The charcoal filtration effectively removes impurities like calcium, chlorine, and unpleasant odors, which leads to a significant improvement in the flavor profile of every cup. The difference is especially evident when brewing lighter roasts, where clean water is essential to bring out the subtle tasting notes.

**Good Points**  
- Makes a notable difference in coffee taste by reducing impurities.  
- Compatible with a wide range of Cuisinart machines.  
- Individually sealed filters ensure optimal freshness during storage.  
- The two-month lifespan aligns well with typical usage expectations.  

**Critiques**  
- Slightly shorter lifespan in areas with very hard water.  
- Not reusable, which creates waste if you‚Äôre environmentally conscious.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
In the realm of coffee machine water filters, there‚Äôs no shortage of competition. Products like GoldTone and K&J replacement filters are comparable in both performance and price. GoldTone‚Äôs filters offer a very similar experience, though they don‚Äôt come individually sealed, which could be a detractor for long-term storage. K&J does a better job with lifespan in hard water scenarios, lasting up to three months, but they don‚Äôt fit as seamlessly into certain Cuisinart models as these do. If compatibility and smart packaging are your priorities, Geesta still comes out on top.

**Value for Money**  
The pricing is undoubtedly competitive for a 12-pack. Each filter‚Äôs cost breaks down to a point that feels justifiable given the improved coffee quality and machine maintenance. Considering they help prolong the life of your coffee maker by reducing mineral deposits and other contaminants, they save money in the long run on potential repairs. Still, users with hard water may find replacements adding up faster than expected.

And I recently was let down once again. Met a girl in person at my side job, we exchanged numbers and texted a lot. We were both in the same area of town by pure chance, so we hung out for like 45 minutes. Walked around, lots of touching and kissing. Then we had our first official date 2 days later. Just getting a coffee. Was super fun, no lulls in conversation at all, and still very flirty from both sides. We went our separate ways for the day. I finally thought my 10 year drought was gonna be over. She was pretty, smart, and funny. The complete package. And best of all, she seemed to like me for me and be genuinely attracted to me, something I definitely don't experience often. I texted her an hour or two later after getting home, and said how much fun I had and how I would like to plan a second date soon. Then she says she doesn't have feelings for me and doesn't wanna continue.

I bring this up because this really fucked with my head. After 10 years of being single and only a handful of first dates to show for it is very frustrating and it's finally prompting me to get a therapist because with how promising this one was, and then for it to end the way it did, was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back in terms of mental health.

I asked her if there was ever anything between them and she said no, they're just friends. But I can't help but feel weird about it. I've never had a ""work wife"", and even if I did, I feel like constantly talking about her to my girlfriend would be super disrespectful.

Does your to-do list feel endless? Like it grows faster than your kids? Some days it seems like there aren't enough hours for everything, let alone any time for *you*!

I get it. I've been there, and those days still happen! But I've found some really quick ""hacks"" that truly help. My goal isn't a perfect home, just more peace and progress, 10 minutes at a time.

I wanted to share a few small things that help me feel less overwhelmed, even on the busiest days:

* **The ""5-Minute Power Tidy"":** Set a timer! Before bed, or even before your coffee, pick one small area ‚Äì like the kitchen counter or living room floor. Tidy it for just 5 minutes. It's amazing what you can clear. You'll wake up to a calmer space.
* **""Dinner Prep Express"":** Use those tiny spare moments. While your tea kettle boils, or when the kids are briefly busy, quickly slice veggies for tomorrow's dinner. Or pre-portion snacks. Just 7 minutes of prep now feels like a huge win later when you're rushing.
* **""Instant Mama Recharge"":** When the kids nap or have quiet time, don't jump straight to chores. Find 10 minutes just for *you*. Listen to a song, do 5 minutes of mindful breathing, or simply relax with a hot drink. This truly helps refill your energy.

These tips seem small, but they really add up.

 They help you find moments of calm and efficiency in your busy day. You don't need a new routine or hours of free time.

If these quick tips sound good and you want more ways to bring calm and happiness to your home easily, **comment ""interested"" below!** I've gathered 100 similar short hacks and can share where to find them.

Having trouble figuring out how exactly to calibrate [Breville Bambino + Kingrinder P2],"I've pretty much got my Picopresso dialed in and can get coffee shop quality shots at 17g. 

Using a similar dose and prep on the Bambino leads to an extraction that creates multiple streams that never coalesce into one, and there are some bald spots on the portafilter mid-extraction. The taste comes out really muddy and unclear. I imagine puck prep is an issue here, but maybe it's grind too? If anyone has used both, do you generally have to grind finer or coarser when switching from the Picopresso to Bambino?

1mce3ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1mce3ow/the_most_dangerous_thing_about_palestinian/,The most dangerous thing about Palestinian propaganda is that Palestinians believe it,"The volume of propaganda about the war in Gaza is absolutely unprecdented. Lies coming directly from Hamas are repackaged into memes and short news stories and travel all across the world to hundreds of millions of people on sites like X, TikTok and Instagram.

We first saw how insidious this propaganda could be early in the war when Hamas - and by extension the leftist media - claimed that Israel bombed¬†Al-Ahli Arab Hospital. Immediately the headlines were ""500 dead in Israel hospital attack."" Meanwhile, social media was flooded with posts about how ""bombing a hospital is a war crime.""

Of course, come to find out that the hospital itself wasn't even hit - it was the parking lot. And that 500 dead was literally a made up figure by orders of magnitude. And the big thing is that the missile didn't even come from Israel - it came from Islamic Jihad.

But with Palestinian propaganda, any amount of anti-Israel PR is considered a win, if not the goal. And unfortunately this type of 'news reporting' has become the norm.

This type of blatantly false propaganda harms Israel's image, but it ultimately does more to harm the Palestinians.

1) For one, it undermines Palestinian credibility. Over the last few years, thousands of photos of destruction or starvation from places like Yemen and Syria have been purposefully passed off as scenes from Gaza. With Hamas and Qatar pulling the strings on media messaging, it actually dilutes real human rights concerns.

2) It also helps fuel extremism. If all you've been taught since birth is that jews are evil and want to take over the world and that they bomb children whenever they can, killing jews may actually sound like a noble thing to do. Under Hamas rule, the culture in Gaza turned into something quite dark. When there are videos of kids in school plays acting out killing jews (not israelis, but jews) to crowds of cheering parents, something is rotten to the core. This type of extremism fascilitates the election of terrorist groups like Hamas because they'll actually solve the pesky problem of the jews.A

3) But more than anything, Palestinian propaganda heightens expectations to unrealistic levels. 1948 is over. The Palestinians lost. Their goal to take over the entire land is simply silly at this point. People can chant from the river to the sea or whatever they want, and hold up keys of a house that existed in 1947, but it's all just for show. Israel is a recognized country of over 10 million people. It's not going anywhere. But if you actually read Palestinian news sources, you'd think that if the Palestinians just fight hard enough, Israel's days will be numbered.

When you are fed lies about Israel's destruction, and believe it because you want it to be, what's the motivation to negotiate any type of peace? As an example, look at this tweet from Remi Kanazi - a Palestinian born and raised in America - he writes ""F\*\*k a peace plan, we are looking at liberation "" source: [https://x.com/Remroum/status/1949247801939915164](https://x.com/Remroum/status/1949247801939915164)

This is emblamatic of the danger of Palestinian propaganda. A person born and raised in America is openly saying no to peace in favor of full liberation (i.e the destruction of Israel). Why? Because he's been brainwashed to believe that it's possible, all while he sips coffee from a hip spot in Brooklyn. 

The idea that Israel is going to magically disappear is why the Palestinians have rejected every peace plan ever made. I mean why accept peace when you genuinely believe that Israel can be defeated through force - even though this hasn't happened in 80 years. And the people who actually suffer as a result are the Palestinians themselves.

Palestinian propaganda, and the elevation of death as marytodom, has created an environment where Hamas leaders claim ""We love death the way you love life."" 

This type of insane thinking wouldn't be possible without Palestinian propaganda which demonizes Israel to such an extent that destroying Israel is more important than actually creating a Palestinian country.",16,1753802025.0,IsraelPalestine,48,0.67,False

1mce2re,https://i.redd.it/jnark96oxtff1.jpeg,Playback,"The tires crunched over snow as we rounded the final bend, the cabin coming into view just as the sun dipped behind the mountains. It looked exactly like the pictures; quaint, tucked into the trees that picturesquely hid a roof that needed replacing. The kind of place someone more optimistic might describe as ‚Äúcharming.‚Äù I wanted it to feel charming. I wanted Claire to see it that way too.

‚ÄúHere we are,‚Äù I said, forcing a little enthusiasm into my voice as I pulled into the narrow driveway.

Claire didn‚Äôt respond. She was staring at her phone, thumb scrolling slowly, her face bathed in the faint blue glow.

‚ÄúLooks nice, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù I tried again, louder this time.

She glanced up, eyes flicking to the cabin, then back to her screen. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she murmured.

I killed the engine and sat for a moment, gripping the steering wheel. Fine. Of course it was fine. That‚Äôs how everything was with us these days. Just fine.

The wind picked up as I stepped out of the car, sharp and bitter against my face. The sky hung low and heavy, the snow swirling in lazy drifts that would soon grow into something heavier. 

I turned, taking in my surroundings. The cabin sat perched on the mountainside, the winding road we'd taken visible below, snaking through the trees like a thin, fragile thread. The road had split and veered back toward town a quarter mile before, leaving only a slick, cobbled driveway behind. For the first time in months, there was no sound of traffic-no hum of engines or distant voices. Just the wind, growing louder by the second, and the soft, eerie hush of falling snow. The kind of quiet that presses in on you, suffocating, until you're not sure whether it's the world holding its breath or you.

I looked back at Claire, still sitting in the passenger seat. She‚Äôd finally looked up from her phone and seemed to really be taking in the cabin. For a second I was hopeful that she was excited to be here, but I quickly realized her face was washed with a vague disdain for the building.

‚ÄúCan you grab your bags?‚Äù I asked, leaning back in the door.

She sighed a little too loudly and climbed out, shivering as she zipped her coat and put her phone in her pocket. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs freezing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs December in Colorado,‚Äù I said, trying for humor. ‚ÄúWhat did you expect?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt laugh.

The cabin door resisted when I pushed it open, the wood swollen and warped from years of wear and weather. Inside, the cabin smelled faintly of pine and something musty, the dull damp scent reminding me of our little apartment back home. The floors groaned underfoot as I stepped in, the sound muffled by faded rugs and soft wood. A stone fireplace dominated the far wall, and a small kitchen sat off to the left, its appliances outdated but at least appearing functional. To our right, a narrow hallway with two doors and a pull-down attic string seemed to be the way to our bathroom and bedroom. Generic framed paintings and kitschy souvenirs adorned the hall, gathering dust. Telltale signs of a home that had been long delegated to live out its days as a holiday rental.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cozy,‚Äù I said, setting our bags down by the door.

Claire brushed past me without a word, heading straight for the couch. She dropped onto it, pulling her phone out again and scrolling as if it were the only thing keeping her tethered to the world. At least she looked comfortable to finally be out of the car. 

I sighed, my breath puffing out in the chilly air as I set our bags down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the fire going.‚Äù

The fireplace was old, caked in soot, and looked like it probably hadn‚Äôt passed an inspection in decades, but there was a neat stack of logs and kindling waiting beside it. I knelt down, striking a few damp matches until one finally lit, and coaxed a flame to life. Warmth crept into the room as the fire caught, long shadows dancing across the wooden walls.

‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù I asked, glancing at Claire.

She looked up, and flashed me a curt smile and nod before burying herself again in her phone. I found myself soured at the realization that her signal here must somehow be decent enough to keep endlessly scrolling.

I busied myself unpacking, the silence between us growing heavier with each passing minute. The snow had started falling harder now, the wind rattling the windows. The cabin groaned softly, the sound deep and patient, like a long-held sigh. I paused, listening, but it was just the home shifting under the slowly increasing burden of the snow on the roof.

‚ÄúAt least this place has some character,‚Äù I said, trying to break the silence.

Claire didn‚Äôt respond.

I sat down next to her, rubbing my hands together as I tried to ignore the vague dampness of the couch. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, I know this trip isn‚Äôt exactly your idea of relaxing, but I thought-‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired,‚Äù she cut in, standing abruptly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúClaire‚Ä¶‚Äù

She was already walking down the hall, her footsteps sharp against the creaky floorboards. A door shut, and I was left alone with the fire and the sound of the growing storm outside. 

I leaned back, staring at the dancing flames. I pulled a blanket out of one of my bags, and was relieved to find that the couch reclined. 

*‚ÄúMaybe it would be best if you slept on the couch tonight.‚Äù*

Claire‚Äôs words from days prior rattled through my head. It hadn‚Äôt just been that night; we hadn‚Äôt slept in the same room since. I had hoped that would change tonight, but I resigned myself to fall asleep by the crackling fire.

 The cabin let out another low groan, the sound making the hairs on the back of my neck prickle.
I looked out the window once more, and realized that the growing storm had become a blizzard. Cold air blew in through the crack under the front door, and I could tell my car wasn‚Äôt moving anytime soon. 

It was going to be a long night.

-

Morning crept in slowly, the storm outside reduced to a dull whisper of snow against the windows. The fire had died overnight, leaving the cabin bitterly cold. I dragged myself off the couch and pulled on a sweatshirt, shivering as I walked into the kitchen.

Claire was already up, sitting at the small table by the window, her coffee mug sitting in front of her on the table, untouched. She wasn‚Äôt looking at her phone, which felt like progress, but her eyes were fixed on the snow-covered trees outside. Her head was tilted towards the hallway, as though she were listening for me coming.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I said, grabbing the remaining chipped mug from the counter.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù she replied quietly, not turning to look at me.

I poured myself some coffee, the pot nearly cold since she‚Äôd made it. She must‚Äôve been up for hours. 

‚ÄúThe storm looks like it‚Äôs easing up,‚Äù I said, leaning against the counter. ‚ÄúMaybe we could take a walk later? Get some fresh air.‚Äù

She made a vague noise of hesitant agreement, but her body language was closed off, legs tucked under her, shoulders hunched. It wasn‚Äôt outright hostility, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly welcoming either.

I watched her for a moment, my coffee growing colder in my hands. I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from thinking about the things she‚Äôd said to me during our last fight, words that had settled into me like splinters. 

*‚ÄúIf you want to book that stupid anniversary trip, go right ahead. You just bulldoze ahead like what you want is the only thing that matters.‚Äù*

I took a deep breath and turned away, sipping my coffee.

That‚Äôs when I heard it, a faint sound, just on the edge of my perception.

I froze, tilting my head toward the hallway. It was so faint that I couldn‚Äôt be sure I wasn‚Äôt imagining it, like the hum of an appliance or a distant murmur muffled through walls.

‚ÄúYou hear that?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù Claire‚Äôs voice sounded annoyed, but she glanced over her shoulder towards the hallway as well.

‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, a noise. It sounds like‚Ä¶ talking? Singing, maybe?‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably the wind.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù I muttered. 

We finished up our coffee, and put our mugs in the sink. We‚Äôd long fallen out of our habit of washing dishes together, and there wasn‚Äôt a dishwasher in sight. 

As I began to slip on my boots, Claire slowly shambled to the bedroom, with no indication that she‚Äôd be getting dressed for our walk. 

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to join me, honey? The storm‚Äôs clearing up, it‚Äôll be nice to get out of here for a bit.‚Äù

There was a moment of silence and I thought she would ignore me once more, but after a moment, her voice mumbled through the cracked bedroom door.

‚ÄúThis trip will be a lot easier for the both of us if we don‚Äôt have to pretend. Go on your walk, I‚Äôll be here on my phone.‚Äù

My anger finally burst forth, having been restrained in an attempt to salvage this trip.

‚ÄúYou think *I‚Äôm* the one making this harder than it has to be? You‚Äôre impossible to talk to, Claire.‚Äù I shouted towards the door. 

I heard her stand, feet shuffling towards the bedroom door, and it slammed shut. The house groaned in response, then settled, and once more the silence was swallowed up by the faint murmuring noise coming from the hallway.

-

The noise didn‚Äôt go away. As the day went on, it remained at the edge of my awareness, faint but persistent. I tried to ignore it, chalking it up to maybe wind blowing through a hole in the roof, or perhaps even a small animal seeking shelter from the cold. It made me uneasy. There was a familiarity to the noise that I couldn‚Äôt place.

We ate dinner in near silence, the tension between us heavy enough to fill the small kitchen. Claire pushed her canned pasta around her plate, barely eating.

‚ÄúIs it bothering you?‚Äù I asked finally.

She looked up, startled that I‚Äôd broken the quiet.

‚ÄúIs *what* bothering me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe noise. I thought maybe-‚Äú

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hear anything,‚Äù she said quickly, cutting me off.

I opened my mouth to argue, but stopped myself. I‚Äôd learned by now not to tell her when I thought she was wrong about something. Instead, I finished my meal in silence, the faint static prickling at the edge of my hearing.

It wasn‚Äôt until we were piling our dishes in the sink when the cold wind stopped entirely for the first time since our arrival, and the sound was louder than it had ever been. 

Claire turned her head towards the hallway, and I grinned.

‚ÄúSo you do hear it!‚Äù I‚Äôll admit I was a little smug when she rolled her eyes at me. 

‚ÄúFine I hear it. But it‚Äôs nothing, just this stupid old cabin falling apart.‚Äù

Claire turned to walk towards the hallway, and I began to walk towards my makeshift bed on the couch when she turned towards me, sighed, and gestured for me to join her in the bedroom.

I happily took my blanket from the couch, and finally went to bed with a little warmth.

-

As I fell asleep, I dreamt of our wedding day. It‚Äôs ironic, on a trip that was intended to celebrate our fifth anniversary, it was the first time my wedding had even crossed my mind.

I dreamt I was at the altar, holding hands with my wife. Her palms felt cold and clammy in my own, and she looked upset. I looked at her, trying to imagine a future in which we could be happy, but her scowl burnt holes through my hope. 

As the minister began to conclude the ceremony and asked if anyone in the crowd held objections, a voice rang from the audience. I turned towards the crowd, and was shocked to see Claire; or yet, another Claire. She was dressed comfortably, in the sweater she‚Äôd worn on our first date. She looked radiant, smiling like how she used to, and was eagerly trying to get my attention. 

‚ÄúJason! Jason I love you! Come here, come to me please! Don‚Äôt do this!‚Äù She cried, as though it were of utmost urgency. 

I turned back to my bride to be, and was taken aback to find her withering before me. Her skin sallowed and stretched tight over her bones, her rosy cheeks deflating and her eyes growing darker. I couldn‚Äôt look away as she guided my hand to her side, wet with blood. 

I awoke in a cold sweat to the noise from above. 

It was louder now, unmistakable. Not static exactly, but something uneven and distorted, like voices filtering through a bad connection. 

I sat up in bed, heart thudding in my chest. Claire stirred beside me, groaning softly.

‚ÄúJason?‚Äù she mumbled.

‚ÄúDo you hear that?‚Äù I asked, my voice low.

She didn‚Äôt answer right away, but her face tensed as she strained to listen. The sound wasn‚Äôt just faint anymore. It was distinct, tangible. I could finally make out the noise; it was voices. Rushed, muted speech, garbled by a grumbling static, the words muddy and indiscernible.

‚ÄúIs that a radio?‚Äù she asked, sitting up.

‚ÄúI think so,‚Äù I said, already climbing out of bed.

We followed the sound into the hallway, our footsteps loud on the creaky floor. The noise grew stronger as we neared the end of the hall, where a pull-down attic door sat flush with the ceiling.

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù Claire muttered, staring at it.

I reached up, tugging the ladder rope down with a loud groan of wood and metal, and it didn‚Äôt budge. Claire fished her phone out of her pajama pocket, and shone her flashlight up towards the attic door. There was a small four-digit padlock holding the door shut. The owners clearly didn‚Äôt want any guests entering the attic.

The noise was much clearer now, a steady static interspersed with faint bursts of garbled speech.

‚ÄúYou think the owners left a radio on up there?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she said, though her tone was uncertain. ‚ÄúWe should call them.‚Äù

I nodded, pulling out my phone. The number that was left on the AirBnB listing went straight to voicemail. I left a message, trying to sound calm but insistent. 

‚ÄúGuess we‚Äôll just have to deal with it for now,‚Äù I said, uneasy at the thought of leaving it playing all through the night. 

Claire‚Äôs expression hardened. ‚ÄúDeal with it? How are we supposed to sleep with that going on?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, okay?‚Äù I snapped, my annoyance bubbling over and giving way to anger. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do, break in?‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not starting anything,‚Äù I shot back.

She stormed off without another word, the bedroom door slamming behind her.

I stood alone in the hallway, staring up at the attic door. The static buzzed in my ears, louder now, almost rhythmic.

It felt like it was waiting for something.

-

The next morning, I found Claire in the kitchen again, standing by the counter with her arms crossed and a mug of untouched coffee sitting beside her. She wasn‚Äôt scrolling through her phone this time, just staring out the window as the storm‚Äôs remnants swirled in slow, aimless patterns.

The radio hadn‚Äôt stopped. It had finally grown quieter in the early hours of the morning, but now it was back, faint but persistent, distorted speech pouring through the ceiling, filling the air with tension.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt sleep, did you?‚Äù I asked, trying to keep my voice neutral.

She turned her head slightly, just enough to glance at me from the corner of her eye. ‚ÄúHard to sleep when there‚Äôs a radio running all night.‚Äù

I sighed and leaned against the doorway. ‚ÄúI already tried calling the owner again when I woke up. What do you want me to do? Smash the lock and risk paying for damages?‚Äù

Her shoulders tensed, and I could feel the argument building before she even opened her mouth. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the noise, Jason,‚Äù she said, turning to face me fully now. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the *voices.‚Äù*

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre faint,‚Äù I replied, brushing her concern aside. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably just some talk show or something-‚Äú

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that,‚Äù she snapped, her voice rising. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs creepy. It‚Äôs weird. And you‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs normal!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs normal,‚Äù I said, my patience wearing thin. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not going to lose my mind over a busted radio in an old house, either.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, and she stepped closer, her voice low and sharp. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always like this. You act like I‚Äôm crazy for being upset, like everything‚Äôs my fault because I can‚Äôt just ‚Äòrelax‚Äô like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair, Claire,‚Äù I said, my jaw tightening. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre acting like I put the damn radio there just to piss you off.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe you didn‚Äôt, but you sure as hell aren‚Äôt doing anything about it.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to fire back when something stopped me.

A voice crackled through the static, clearer and louder than anything we‚Äôd heard so far.

*‚ÄùYou think I‚Äôm the one making this harder than it has to be? You‚Äôre impossible to talk to, Claire.‚Äù*

I froze.

Claire‚Äôs eyes widened as she stared at me, her face pale. ‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù

I hesitated, trying to process what I‚Äôd just heard. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs nothing. Probably just..‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me that wasn‚Äôt you.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt me,‚Äù I insisted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs-‚Äú

‚ÄúJason, that was *exactly* what you said to me yesterday‚Äù

The static broke again, like a scratched record, and the voice resumed, now faint but unmistakable: *‚ÄùStop putting this all on me, Claire. You‚Äôre just imagining things, I didn‚Äôt go anywhere tonight.‚Äù*

I took a step back, my stomach twisting. It wasn‚Äôt just the words, it was the cadence too. The exact rhythm of my voice.

Claire‚Äôs hands trembled as she pressed them to her forehead. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre doing this,‚Äù she said, her voice sharp and brittle. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to mess with me, with my emotions. Do you think it‚Äôs funny..?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No!‚Äù I said, my own voice rising now. ‚ÄúClaire, how could I even-‚Äú

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been trying to fix this trip from the beginning, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù she spat. She began to hyperventilate. ‚ÄúLike we could just patch everything up if, if somehow you controlled the situation!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not controlling anything!‚Äù

The static surged, loud enough to make my ears ring, and through it came another burst of words, this time in Claire‚Äôs voice: *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so damn selfish, Jason. You only care about fixing things on your terms.‚Äù*

Her face crumpled as the words registered, and she looked at me like she‚Äôd been slapped.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs from‚Ä¶ last summer,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúWhen we fought about my job offer. That‚Äôs me.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to deny it, to tell her she was wrong, but then I heard it again: her voice, warped but unmistakable, repeating the exact words I‚Äôd heard her yell during that fight.

*‚ÄúYou want to fix everything, Jason? Why don‚Äôt you fix yourself first.‚Äù*

It was *us.*

I backed up against the counter, my pulse pounding in my ears. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?‚Äù

Claire shook her head, her face pale and her hands still trembling. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt- I don‚Äôt want to hear it anymore.‚Äù

She turned and stormed out of the kitchen, slamming the bedroom door behind her.

I stood there, staring at the ceiling where the faint sound of static hummed steadily through the boards. A chill ran down my spine as the sound shifted, and for a moment, I thought I could hear the creak of footsteps from above.

It was faint, almost imperceptible, but it was enough to keep me rooted in place, staring up at the locked attic door, as Claire‚Äôs garbled voice echoed through the attic again.

*‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I ever married you.‚Äù*

-

Time blurred into itself, the storm outside returning to bury the cabin in deeper drifts of snow and the sound upstairs filling our world with a ceaseless, mocking static. At times, it would go quiet, just long enough for Claire and me to let our guards down, consider talking about something, anything, beyond our own misery. But right when I thought we might have a chance at conversation, the radio would crackle back to life, louder and more intrusive than before.

It was a few days in when I realized that it wasn‚Äôt just replaying our worst arguments anymore- it was anything we‚Äôd spoken to or about each other. I heard my own voice from months ago telling a friend how ‚ÄúClaire doesn‚Äôt see me,‚Äù how ‚Äúshe makes everything a battle.‚Äù 

A while later it shifted to Claire‚Äôs voice, raw and sobbing, confiding in her sister that she didn‚Äôt know how much longer she could endure me. I recognized every word, every breath, because I remembered her phone call that night. She‚Äôd locked herself in the bathroom, and I‚Äôd pressed my ear against the door. I had never regretting being nosy as much as that night. Here it was, echoing through the attic, laid bare.

Every time the voice became clearer, I‚Äôd see Claire‚Äôs face tighten, a tortured mix of guilt and fury. We couldn‚Äôt escape each other‚Äôs taunts, or the house‚Äôs apparent need to throw them at us like daggers.

We hardly said a word to each other, circling each other in the small cabin, surviving on canned soup and stale crackers. I tried calling the owner again and again, leaving voicemails that grew more frantic with each attempt. My calls went unreturned, my hope dwindling with each missed connection.  

Claire‚Äôs phone signal was the next to go. She‚Äôd tried to scroll through social media, text her friends, anything to distract herself, but no matter where she stood or where she tried, her phone could barely muster one bar. She sank onto the couch, eyes full of tears that she refused to let fall in front of me.

‚ÄúWe have to leave,‚Äù she whispered on our fifth day in the cabin, her voice trembling as she stared at the swirling white chaos through the window. ‚ÄúJason, I can‚Äôt stay here anymore.‚Äù

We had discussed leaving the day before, but the weather had barely permitted us to open the front door. It hadn‚Äôt let up much since then, but the desperation in her voice shook me. Without another word, we bundled up. Thick coats, gloves, scarves, the works. I helped tie her boots. There was something almost tender in the gesture, and for a moment I wondered if we could reconcile, to pull ourselves out of this nightmare by sheer force of will.

But stepping outside was like entering a frozen void. The wind whipped icy needles of snow at our faces, and the driveway was half-buried in drifts. I dug at the car door, yanking the icy handle open only to find the interior of the car felt as cold and lifeless as the air around us. The engine refused to turn over, coughing twice before going silent.

I glanced at Claire. Her eyes darted to the steep, unpaved road that snaked down the mountain. Even if the car started, *we‚Äôd be risking our lives* trying to maneuver those icy curves. We looked at each other, and I knew she felt as defeated as I did. 

We trudged back to the cabin, fighting each step through the wind. My fingers had gone numb in spite of my gloves. Claire was shivering violently, a silent terror in her eyes. When I finally managed to force the swollen cabin door open, that now-familiar static rushed out to greet us. 

And then I heard it. Claire‚Äôs voice upstairs, as usual, speaking words I wished I‚Äôd never have to hear. She sounded almost gentle, but her words were damning.

*‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave him soon,‚Äù* she said, her tone calm and intimate. *‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have a clue.‚Äù*

My heart lurched.  Real or not, it felt like a blade twisting in my gut. I glanced at her. Her eyes were wide, tears threatening to spill, the betrayal fresh even though those words were her own. She looked at me, shook her head, and without speaking, retreated to the bedroom, shutting the door quietly behind her.

I stood there, snow melting on my boots, face stinging from the cold, and listened to the static pick up again. The cabin creaked in the wind, sounding almost like a soft, mocking laugh. I could only stare at the dying embers in the fireplace, wondering if *anything* in our lives would survive this place.

-

As the relentless static from the attic wore on, it seemed to scrape away at the edges of my sanity. The voices unearthed every bitter line, every whispered complaint we thought safely hidden. The cabin felt like a cage, trapping us with an auditory barrage that knew no bounds. Each new revelation, whether a conversation once held secret or a venomous whisper shared in confidence, added weight to an already unbearable tension.

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just too much, Jason. Always fixing, never listening.‚Äù*

Exhausted and desperate, I found myself fixated on the attic. The padlock, an old rusted relic, mocked me from the ceiling hatch, a barrier to whatever twisted machine perpetuated our torment. I needed to get it open, needed to find out what was happening, but every traditional method had failed. No amount of pleading with the unresponsive owner or searching for a misplaced key had yielded any results. It was just Claire and me, growing more estranged with each passing hour.

*‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to stay this distant forever, Claire, you might as well just leave.‚Äù*

Determined, I approached the hatch again, armed with nothing but a sense of determination. I grabbed a chair from the kitchen, positioning it under the attic‚Äôs pull-down string. The padlock dangled just out of reach, an enigmatic sentinel guarding our tormentor. Did I even want to find out what was up there? The need to stop the voices overpowered any hesitation.

I fetched a small toolbox from under the kitchen sink, the one that barely saw use, and rummaged through it for anything that might help. I came up with a couple of old screwdrivers and a tarnished set of Allen keys. Not ideal, but it was all I had.

*‚ÄúWhy bother, Jason? It‚Äôs over, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù*

I ignored the jibes, focusing on the padlock. I tried each tool systematically, twisting and prodding in a futile attempt to force the mechanism. I eventually gave up on trying to break open the lock, and in my desperation, resorted to trying any and every combination I could think of. My hands, raw from the metal and the cold that seeped into the cabin, worked mechanically. Time lost meaning as I moved from one combination to the next, fueled by a mix of fury and a desperate need for silence.

Hours must have passed, the light outside dimming to the early twilight that predicted another long night. The numbers blurred before my eyes, each click a mockery as our voices cried from above.

*‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to leave, you know. Can‚Äôt you tell?‚Äù* My brother‚Äôs voice seemed to boom down at me from above. I winced as I anticipated my next words.
*‚ÄùLet her. I don‚Äôt need this hassle any longer.‚Äù*

The frustration and shame built within me like a physical force, a crescendo that demanded release. As I furiously put in every four digit combination I could think of, the realization hit me like a brick. I stopped on a new combination; 1-2-3-1. Today‚Äôs date, but more importantly, our wedding anniversary. A detail that had slipped from my conscious mind but lay buried, a remnant of happier times.

With all of the remaining effort my frigid, tired hand could muster, I pulled. The lock clicked open.

Relief washed over me, quickly chased by apprehension. What would I find up there? Claire had arisen from the couch and watched, her face a mask of mingled fear and curiosity. Her silence was a gulf between us, but this act, opening the attic, felt like the first truly shared moment in days.

I pulled the string, and the ladder creaked down, dust dancing in the air disturbed by its descent. We both flinched at the sharp, echoing sound of the radio, clear as day, coming from above. 

I hesitated, my hand on the ladder. The air felt charged, thick with the anticipation of what was yet to come. The static above us quieted for a moment, as if the attic itself held its breath.

*‚ÄúWhat are you afraid of, Jason? You‚Äôre a coward! Just run away from it all, isn‚Äôt that what you always do?‚Äù*

With a deep breath, I started to climb. The ladder groaned under my weight, each step a creak of old wood. Claire stayed below, her face upturned, watching me ascend into the darkness above.

As I approached the top, the chill of the attic wrapped around me, a cold whisper against my skin. I paused, flashlight in hand, ready to sweep away the shadows and uncover the source of our torment. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to turn it on, to see what was up here. At least not alone. Instead, I turned it down towards my wife, and extended my hand down to help her up.

As Claire and I reached the final step of the attic ladder, a chilling silence enveloped us, broken only by the echo of our hesitant footsteps on the floor. It didn‚Äôt feel like the rest of the cabin- it felt cheap, and warm. Linoleum?

The beam from my flashlight cut through the darkness, revealing a sight that made my heart skip a beat. The sight before us wasn‚Äôt just impossible, it was chilling. We were back home, in our crappy little apartment. Or, at least, a perfect replica of it. 

Every detail was meticulously reproduced: the arrangement of books on the shelves, the crease on the sofa cushion, even the small, almost imperceptible stain on the carpet near the TV stand. It was our home, duplicated with an unsettling precision, as if someone had taken a snapshot of our lives and recreated it here in the dusty confines of the attic. 

The air was unnervingly still, thick with a tension that seemed almost palpable. It felt as if the room was holding its breath, waiting for us to shatter the quiet. The musty smell that I‚Äôd noticed when first entering the cabin was amplified to the extreme, and was permeated with an iron, metallic scent that sent my stomach churning. 

My eyes swept the room, searching for the source of the voices that had tormented us. We didn‚Äôt own any radio, nor a record player or any speakers for that matter. Instead, my gaze landed on something far more familiar: my laptop, open on the coffee table, its screen aglow.

I ran over to the battered device, tripping over its power cord as I went. The laptop sat neatly on the table, as the mouse plugged into it moved of its own accord, clicking the screen every few seconds. My eyes darted to the smudged screen, and discovered that it was opened to our security app. I‚Äôd installed cheap cameras around the apartment soon after we moved in. I‚Äôd told Claire that they were for our own safety, but in truth, they were for me- to revisit our arguments, to replay every fight we had, searching for vindication in the details.

The computer was clicking from clip to clip, playing a highlight reel of every terrible thing we‚Äôd ever said to or about each other. 

Claire joined me, her steps slow, almost reluctant. Her eyes widened in horror as she watched the screen. I looked back down at the laptop, only to realize that it had changed once again. I immediately recognized the fight- it was the most recent one before we‚Äôd left home.

*‚ÄúClaire, would you listen to me? It‚Äôs two weeks, you‚Äôll live. It‚Äôll be nice and quiet.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho says I even want nice and quiet? I want to get back to real life, Jason. I haven‚Äôt worked in months, and you planning these ‚Äòsurprise trips‚Äô to try to patch things isn‚Äôt helping me find a job‚Äù*

*‚ÄúSo what? I cancel the booking? I already paid the deposit Claire, we can‚Äôt get that money back. Or did you forget I‚Äôm also working a dead-end job?‚Äù*

*‚ÄúIf you want to book that stupid anniversary trip, go right ahead. You just bulldoze ahead like what you want is the only thing that matters.‚Äù*

I watched myself furrow my brow and then put my head in my hand.

*‚ÄúClaire, I‚Äôm trying here. I really am. But I can never get through to you, can I? First it was you passing on the job offer when we needed that money, then it was that thing with your ex-‚Äú*

*‚ÄúI TOLD you, nothing happened Jason. He just‚Ä¶ he just stopped by for coffee, is all.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúClaire, I‚Äôm not stupid! You turned off the cameras but the audio was still recording, you idiot.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare call me an idiot, after all I‚Äôve done for you.‚Äù*

I watched as Claire had stormed towards me, and our fight was about to escalate. She pounced at me, but I threw her off of me towards the kitchen. I watched her crack her head on the edge of the table and fall through it.

I walked up to the table slowly. I observed her breathing grow shallow, as she lay spasming on the floor. I watched her breathing stop as blood slowly pooled around her. I watched myself stand up calmly, then walk into our bedroom. A minute later, I left, quietly wheeling our luggage towards the front door and leaving as my wife lay motionless.

Then, as if sensing its audience had seen enough, the laptop‚Äôs battery icon flashed once, critical, and the screen went black. The sudden death of the device plunged me back into silence and darkness, a quiet so deep it was almost suffocating. The absence of the voices, which had been such a constant and invasive presence, now left a shallow emptiness that was somehow worse than the noise.

I sat for a moment, unable to process what I‚Äôd just seen. I turned my flashlight up towards Claire, only to see that I was now alone in the room, the dull smell of iron growing ever stronger from the kitchen. 

I shakily turned my flashlight again, this time towards the kitchen table, shrouded in a cloak of darkness that I hadn‚Äôt dared breach since I ascended the attic ladder.

There, lying crumpled in a heap of splintered wood, lay my wife. Dried blood had pooled around her head, and I winced at noticing that her neck was bent at an unnatural angle. She had begun to bloat and stiffen, and the closer I stepped, the more the iron scent of blood was replaced with a musky, rotted smell. 

She was almost entirely a corpse, save for her eyes. Fresh and watery, they were locked onto me, silently accusing me.

‚Äú‚Ä¶.Claire?‚Äù I whispered, praying with every fiber that somehow, she was still in there. 

But she didn‚Äôt respond, didn‚Äôt move. She lay frozen, staring intently, eyes following me as I nervously swayed. The air around us grew colder, denser, as if the room itself was closing in, feeding off the rising panic.

Then, almost imperceptibly, Claire began to whisper. The words were soft, disjointed murmurs at first, guttural sounds forcing their way out of a broken, bloated throat. As I drew closer, the whispers grew clearer, sharper. They were not the comforting words I yearned for but a continuation of the cascade of cruel, cutting phrases I‚Äôd grown accustomed to.

*‚ÄúYou never really cared, did you, Jason? It was always about you, your needs.‚Äù* Her voice was a ghost, devoid even of its usual disdain, hollow and haunting.

I stood, frozen, as her whispers intensified, layering upon each other in a relentless, cold assault. 

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so selfish. You think you‚Äôre the victim, always playing the martyr.‚Äù*

Each word sliced through the already frigid air. The whispers swelled into a torrent of accusations.

*‚ÄúYou suffocate me, Jason. I can‚Äôt breathe with you, can‚Äôt grow. You‚Äôre a dead weight, dragging me down into your misery.‚Äù*

I stumbled backward, hands clamped over my ears, but it was futile.

‚ÄúS- stop it Claire. Please get up, this isn‚Äôt okay. Please get up!‚Äù

*‚ÄúYou should have known I was too good for you. I wasted the best years of my life on a fantasy that you‚Äôd change.‚Äù*

Her face, so familiar and yet so warped, contorted as her dead lips struggled to keep up with the verbal onslaught. The storm outside seemed to echo her fury, the wind howling against the walls as if in sympathy with her rage.

Overwhelmed and unable to bear it, I dropped to my knees, the cold of the floor seeping into my bones. Claire‚Äôs figure, crumpled across from mine, began to crunch as her frame contorted itself so she could continue to lock eyes with me. Her expression was blank, but her eyes piecing as she continued her litany of grievances. 

I crawled, sobbing, searching in the dark for the attic door that led me here, but it had long vanished. The floor was solid.

As the roar of the frozen world outside began to muffle, snow piling against our artificial windows, her voice was the only sound, a relentless echo in the ghostly replica of our apartment. Her words didn‚Äôt stop for hours, and by the time she began to quiet, she had managed to stand up and loom over me, cold and pale, whispering accusations and curses at me in the dark.

It has been weeks since the door to the outside vanished, leaving me trapped in my own home with the whispering thing that was once my wife. Claire, or the thing that used to be her, grows more gaunt by the day, her features sharpening, her eyes sinking deeper into her skull. She‚Äôs starting to smell, but she keeps whispering. She isn‚Äôt going to harm me, not physically. She can‚Äôt. Her body, crumbling and decaying, only has the energy to torment me with its gaze and with its words.

I‚Äôve tried the front door, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any more than decoration in this mockery of my home. It doesn‚Äôt lead outside, it doesn‚Äôt even open. It‚Äôs just part of the wall. The storm outside has not abated; I can hear it sometimes, through the thick snow that covers my windows. If the snow ever subsides, the windows may be my only chance at escape.

I‚Äôm typing this now as both a record and a plea. If you‚Äôre reading this, if this somehow finds its way to someone, anyone, do you know when the blizzard near Denver will let up? Is there any forecast about when the snow will start to melt? It‚Äôs cold in here, and I don‚Äôt think I can listen to her for much longer.

I‚Äôve been working on a personal finance app that focuses on **daily budgeting** in the simplest way possible.

The idea is to help users **understand how much they can spend each day**, without having to go through the overwhelming process of inputting complex monthly budgets ‚Äî although the app does allow optional entries for **monthly income and recurring expenses**, which are then used to automatically calculate the daily budget.

Key features so far:

*  **Minimal and beginner-friendly UX** ‚Äî designed for people who don‚Äôt want to micromanage every cent
* **Calendar-based budgeting**: Visualize your daily budget across the month
* **To-do style payment reminders** on the dashboard for monthly bills
* **Dark mode** for a better experience, especially at night - I know its not essential, but just fun to add this on app
* Export to google drive : for easy migration to sheet / other app if necessary - idk about this

The app is currently **about 80% finished**, and I‚Äôd love to hear your **feedback or suggestions** on the concept and features.

I‚Äôm also thinking ahead about **pricing** ‚Äî maybe a one-time purchase, or a small monthly fee. What would you personally consider fair for an app like this?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

I noticed na umakyat siya sa gaming chair and may inaamoy siya sa table, di ko agad napansin na nandun pa pala yung balot nung croissant. Then napansin ko dumila siya, sinaway ko agad.

Initially, I was drawn ‚Å¢in ‚Å£by the promise of seamless integration ‚Äì controlling lights, ‚Å¢thermostat, even the coffee maker, all from my phone. And honestly, the marketing wasn't wrong; the initial setup was surprisingly easy.

However, things got real after the honeymoon‚Å§ period. I quickly learned the ‚Äãimportance of a *strong* and reliable internet connection. Apparently, dimming the lights via‚Å£ your phone is a ‚Äçlot less ‚Äãimpressive when the command takes 30 seconds to register,‚Äå or worse, times out altogether. ‚Å¢I ended up investing in‚Å¢ a mesh wifi system, which‚Äç helped immensely.

Another‚Äã thing I wish I‚Äôd considered more carefully is the ""vendor lock-in"" aspect.

It took time to find my rhythm, but now 16:8 feels natural. My eating window is 10 am to around 5:30 pm. What helped most was not being too rigid ‚Äî and building small habits to get through the tough moments.

* I wake up at 5 am and start with tea and lemon, then starting my coffee around 6 ‚Äî no food.
* 6‚Äì8 am used to be rough, but now I stay busy with work, kids, and sipping my coffee.
* Around 8‚Äì9 am I work out and hit the steam room. I usually don‚Äôt feel hungry like an hour after the gym.
* First meal at 10 am: usually a salad with protein.
* If I hit a dip around 2 pm (and usually I do), I‚Äôll have some fruit or a small treat with coffee.
* Dinner is early ‚Äî around 5 to 5:30 pm ‚Äî which really helps my sleep (sleep is a big thing for me).

Evenings used to be tough, but now I just drink tea or water.

What made it stick for me:

* I‚Äôm flexible on weekends ‚Äî no guilt.
* My family eats on a different schedule (it's all over the place for my kids), but I still sit with them.
* It does get easier with time, really!

He cries, I hold him, I sing to him, and then he's back to his self. But damn, am I getting worried that all these hits will damage his brain.

And we do have a protective hat, but he takes it off as soon as I put it on.

1mcdnho,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mcdnho/ro_the_girl_who_drinks_tiny_angry_lattes/,[RO] The Girl Who Drinks Tiny Angry Lattes,"*Barcelona, midweek.*

The caf√© didn‚Äôt even have a name outside. Just a bronze bell over the door and a chalkboard menu leaned precariously against the stucco wall, half-faded by the sun.

Locals knew it. Tourists missed it. Which was part of its charm.

Inside, the air smelled like ground espresso and orange peel. Mornings here were unhurried. Tables mismatched. Floor tiled in a pattern no one could quite follow. The barista didn‚Äôt smile, didn‚Äôt rush. He made coffee like it was a contract.

She sat by the window every day at 8:07. Not 8. Not 8:15. Always 8:07. Tiny notebook. Tiny glass. One cortado.

That morning, he walked in like someone who didn‚Äôt know the rules. Backwards baseball cap. Rummaged through his pocket for coins. Ordered a latte in hesitant Spanish. The barista gave him a look, then obliged.

He scanned for a seat and took the one near her‚Äînot beside, but close enough to be within banter range.

He noticed her drink immediately.

‚ÄúIs that a mini latte?‚Äù he asked, genuinely confused.

She didn‚Äôt even glance up. ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúOkay then.‚Äù

Beat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cortado,‚Äù she added, like it pained her to explain.

He looked at her glass. Then his cup. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ like a tiny, angry latte?‚Äù

She looked at him fully now. ‚ÄúWow.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou actually said ‚Äòtiny angry latte‚Äô out loud.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not proud of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt be.‚Äù

He smiled anyway. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm new here.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo kidding.‚Äù

‚Äî

By Thursday, it was a thing.

Same caf√©. Same table. Same drinks. The barista started pulling two shots before either of them spoke.

He brought his own mug that day. A ridiculous touristy one with *Paella is Not a Personality* in bold red letters.

She smirked when he placed it on the table.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not even trying to blend in, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm not here to blend in. I‚Äôm here to ask invasive questions about your beverage choices.‚Äù

She sipped her cortado like it was armor. ‚ÄúGo on then.‚Äù

He gestured to her glass. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the story? You look like someone who could afford a full-sized coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is full-sized. Just not diluted.‚Äù

‚ÄúOuch.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like honesty. No foam. No caramel. No nonsense.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you're saying my latte is a lie.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm saying your latte has commitment issues.‚Äù

He laughed, for real this time.

Around them, locals read newspapers, not phones. A dog wandered in, unbothered. No one rushed. This wasn‚Äôt a grab-and-go kind of place. It was a **stay-and-notice** place.

And he noticed.

\--

Two weeks later, she passed him her glass mid-conversation.

‚ÄúTry it,‚Äù she said.

He hesitated like it was a dare. Then sipped.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI expected violence.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ weirdly good. Like, I get why you drink it. It‚Äôs calm. But also, like, serious.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the point.‚Äù

He nodded slowly, still holding the glass. ‚ÄúI think my latte and I just broke up.‚Äù

‚Äî

A month in, the barista asked if they were dating.

They laughed.

They weren‚Äôt. Not officially. But they sat closer now. Finished each other‚Äôs drinks. Argued about the correct temperature for milk.

They didn‚Äôt label it. They just kept showing up.

He was in post-production‚Äîcutting audio for international ad campaigns. Not glamorous, but mobile. His company let him work remote three months out of the year. Said it helped with ‚Äúglobal creative perspective,‚Äù which was mostly just an excuse to not pay for an office.

She was a copywriter for an e-commerce brand in the U.S. Fully remote. Flexible hours. Wrote product descriptions for overpriced skincare and quirky kitchen gadgets. Could work anywhere with decent Wi-Fi and decent coffee.

So when he sat down one rainy morning, suitcase by his feet, the news wasn‚Äôt shocking. But it still landed with weight.

‚ÄúI took the job,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn London.‚Äù

She stirred her drink.

‚ÄúFreelance or full-time?‚Äù

‚ÄúFreelance contract. Three months. They‚Äôre behind on edits and desperate. I said yes.‚Äù

She nodded.

Silence stretched between them.

‚ÄúI found a place near the Thames,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAsked the barista if they made cortados. He said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not tea, mate. We can handle it.‚Äô Pretty sure that was a yes.‚Äù

She smiled, barely.

He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a small to-go cup. Plain. White. No logo.

On the side, in his handwriting:

**‚ÄúCortado To Go?‚Äù**

He slid it across the table. No speech. No pressure. Just a cup. And a question.

She looked at it.

Then at him.

And without a word, she lifted the cup to her lips and held it there as she looked inquisitively back at him.

She set it down, met his eyes. And smiled.

""I guess I'll be the judge of that"".

1mcdkhr,https://i.redd.it/q2mhkru2utff1.jpeg,Rating SMG4 Villains (PART ONE),"Villains have played a massive role in the SMG4 series. The SMG4 crew can redeem some, or some could be killed off, being remembered only for the crimes they‚Äôve committed. They either play in major arcs like the Genesis arc or PuzzleVision saga, or they could just be minor villains in an episode like HALL-9000. But either way, they all deliver HARD by giving us some of the most emotional scenes or darkest in the series, but some might not stick as well.¬†



I‚Äôm going to rank all the villains from movies and arcs in SMG4, but only from 2018 to 2025, primarily focusing on those years that had the biggest categorized evildoers, as determined by the audience. I‚Äôm rating them according to:

**CHARACTER DESIGN - 5 POINTS** \- (How the character looks)

**MOTIVES - 5 POINTS** \- (What the character planned to do, based on how vile it was)

**CRIMES - 5 POINTS** \- (The actions the character did to get their way)

**IMPACT - 5 POINTS** \- (The aftermath of the character, mostly after they die)

Four categories that all equal a score of 20 points.¬†



\[This is part one\]



(FYI: THIS IS MY OPINION ON THESE CHARACTERS, SO PLEASE DO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS DOWN BELOW IN THE COMMENTS).



**1. WALUIGI (THE WALUIGI ARC \[2018\]) -**

Summary: Waluigi is the FIRST major arc villain and the main villain in The Waluigi Arc (the first official arc). After being rejected yet again in Smash, Waluigi questions his ‚Äúspecial move.‚Äù A specialty that makes someone unique. After trying multiple times, he eventually discovered that his special move was the Power of Rejection, which transformed him into a god. Throughout the arc, Waluigi uses the T pose virus to infect people across the Mushroom Kingdom, kidnapping Mario, and Luigi in a death game, and eventually causing an apocalypse all over the city, starting from the convention that same day. In WOTFI 2018, Waluigi is defeated when he appears in the SMG3 show. Wario comes to tell him that he loves Waluigi, which finally defeats him, and his powers fade away. He was later REDEEMED in the series and to the crew.

**CHARACTER DESIGN:** Ideally, I‚Äôm talking about his overpowered look with the muscles out and glowing eyes. He honestly looks a lot better than I remembered, and I liked that they gave him a completely new look without just using the same standard design, but adding glowing eyes. Sure, it‚Äôs a little bland and not unique, but it still is appealing. RATING: **3.5/5**

**MOTIVES:** I mean, I kind of understand why Waluigi became evil. He was tired of being rejected by everyone in his life, and he used his pain to curse everyone to become mindless T-pose zombies. But he went a little overboard as his motives changed; he destroyed the convention and spread the virus throughout the kingdom, attempting to conquer the entire world with his rejection power. His motives were initially to make people feel rejected, but they eventually shifted to a much more terrifying plan. RATING: **3/5**

**CRIMES:** We‚Äôre specifically talking about the crimes he committed in his arc, and they are pretty intense. Waluigi committed terrorism in the Mushroom Kingdom when he invaded with his zombie army. He kidnapped Mario and Luigi and forced them to play games, and infected THOUSANDS with the T-pose virus. He almost ended humanity, all because he wasn‚Äôt in a fighting game. RATING: **4.5/5**

**IMPACT:** Though being redeemed in the series, Waluigi faced a massive change to his character. He got this new transformation, and he played a big part in the Rapper Bob Arc, where he used his powers to convince Bob what the most important thing is. His arc also changed SMG4, as it was the first major arc in the series and introduced the idea of villains being used in WOTFIs. Although the impact he had was mostly minor in the series, it was primarily on the character of Waluigi. RATING: **4/5**

**FINAL RATING: 15/20**



**2. BOB (RAPPER BOB ARC \[2018\]) -**¬†

Summary: Bob is one of the biggest characters in the SMG4 series, but ALSO the main villain in The Rapper Bob Arc. Before he became a rap idol, Bob apparently ‚Äúsaved‚Äù Boopkins when he was stuck in a well, and got his mansion on fire after his Bobsgiving dinner became a disaster. In the Mario Concert, Bob became a national icon in rap and subsequently went on tour with Luigi and Mario. Unfortunately, Boopkins‚Äôs playful behavior disrupted Bob‚Äôs performance and ruined a concert. Later, Bob reveals that he had PLANNED for Boopkins to be stuck in a well, as well as the Bobsgiving incident, all in an attempt to gain more popularity in his rap career. Bob's rap career continued to gain momentum until Saiko and the crew dissed him so hard that he lost all his fame and power, and he was also cut off from the crew, left alone to fend for himself. In Christmas 2018, Bob realizes (thanks to Waluigi) that the most important thing to him is his friends, so he decides to leave his rap career behind to be with them. In the end, Bob was redeemed by the crew.

**CHARACTER DESIGN:** I mean, this was BEFORE WOTFI 2022, so Bob still had his Nintendo design on him. In terms of the rapper's outfit, I liked his chain and the glasses he wore. Gave him a narcissistic look. RATING: **3/5**

**MOTIVES:** Kind of basic, to be honest. Wanting to be the biggest rapper in the world isn‚Äôt the most EVIL type of plan. However, he did face a power of abuse, as his fame and power got to his head, eventually betraying everyone who cared about him, especially Boopkins. Not only that, but he wanted the whole WORLD to like his music. I will give him credit for his speech at the end of the ""The Mario Concert"" episode. That talk of who you should be in this world provides a cruel description of who Bob was.

RATING: **3.5/5**

**CRIMES:** As for the abuse of power, he DID attempt murder. TWICE! One was throwing Boopkins down a well, with no chance of escaping. Or the house setting on fire scheme he planned out. All of this is just to gain popularity in his rap career. RATING: **3.5/5**

**IMPACT:** This arc didn‚Äôt have a lot on the story. Sure, it opened up the idea for Bob being part rapper, but the series didn‚Äôt capitalize on it. This was one of the few arcs that didn‚Äôt play a massive role in SMG4, and kind of let up, and mainly was Bob getting more character development, as Waluigi did. RATING: **2/5**

**FINAL RATING: 12/20**



**3. FRANCIS (ANIME ARC \[2019\]) -**

Summary: Francis is the main villain in one of the most IMPACTFUL arcs in SMG4, which is The Anime Arc. When anime was banned, Francis became the leader of the Anime Cartel, a group known for smuggling anime across the Mushroom Kingdom. After helping Axol and the crew unban anime, Francis became intrigued by the Inkweaver, Axol‚Äôs tool for drawing manga, which led to Axol, MEGGY, and Desti being kidnapped and taken to Anime Island. We learn that Francis wishes to create an island of anime waifus, all for his sick pleasure, but he needs ink. So, he kidnaps HUNDREDS of Inklings to EXTRACT the ink from their bodies, starting with Meggy. This resulted in the SMG4 crew bringing an army straight towards Anime Island, leading to a catastrophic war. Eventually, they were able to beat Francis, but Desti paid the price and died in front of Meggy. Angered, Saiko locks Francis inside the tube Meggy was in, leaving him to DIE while the island exploded. After everything, Anime Island is destroyed, but Meggy lost all her ink from her body, turning her into a human. The crew defeated Francis.

**CHARACTER DESIGN:** Not much to go from here, since Francis IS a character from another Nintendo game. However, his design does give a glimpse into how he acted, which was that of an anime-loving freak who got too carried away.¬†

RATING: **3/5**

**MOTIVES:** When you think about the anime island full of anime waifus, it IS a little lazy, considering there‚Äôs not much to go from here. However, I am giving some credibility to how insane they made Francis in this arc because this idea turned out to be a lot darker. With the concept of kidnapping Inklings, sucking the ink out of them sounds like a horror movie idea. Heck, the wiki even says Francis was attempting GENOCIDE, for his motives! RATING: **4/5**

**CRIMES:** Francis is a monster. He kidnapped Meggy and TORTURED her by extracting all the ink from her body. He was the leader of a criminal organization who did illegal operations against the law and planned to wipe out HALF of the Inkopolis population, all for his sick pleasure. Hell, in his secret lair, INKLINGS were LINED UP in test tubes, as their ink was slowly extracted from their bodies. RATING: **5/5**

**IMPACT:** There was an impact in the series when the Anime Arc surfaced. Desti became the first death in a major arc, and Francis caused immense trauma to Meggy, as her whole body was changed from the incident. A whole MOVIE was made dedicated to the aftermath of The Anime Arc. Not only that, but it also gave Meggy one of the most significant character developments in the entire series. You don‚Äôt see that every day in arcs now. RATING: **5/5**

**FINAL RATING: 17/20**



**4. TEAM KILLER INK (SMG4 MOVIE: MEGGY‚ÄôS DESTINY \[2020\]) -**

Summary: Team Killer Ink is a group of Inklings and the main villain in the FIRST SMG4 movie, Meggy‚Äôs Destiny. They were a rival team that insulted Meggy‚Äôs human appearance and the rest of her friends, especially their leader. In the end, they lost the Splatfest, and Meggy and her team won. (Yeah, not much to go around‚Ä¶)

**CHARACTER DESIGN:** I mean, they WERE some regular Inklings who are racists. However, I do like how their designs give them a narcissistic look they had in the movie. RATING: **2/5**

**MOTIVES:** Just like everyone else in the Splatfest. Just trying to win. RATING: **1/5**

**CRIMES:** They did nothing illegal at all in the Splatfest, except just insulting, but that isn‚Äôt a crime. RATING: **1/5**

**IMPACT:** Kind of sad how forgotten these characters are, considering they didn‚Äôt do anything but be assholes in the movie. Although the movie honestly marked another significant development in Meggy‚Äôs character. RATING: **1.5/5**

**FINAL RATING: 5.5/20**



**5. SMG3 (THE YOUTUBE ARC \[2020\]) -**

Summary: SMG3 is the rival antagonist of SMG4 and the main villain behind The YouTube Arc. After seeing SMG4 taking up all the fame and glory while he didn‚Äôt get any, he had enough. SMG3 decides to create his own Anti-Cast, a crew designed to replace the SMG4 crew, alongside Mario. They tried making up a play, which was a poorly written rip-off of all of SMG4‚Äôs current arcs, but they were caught in the act. SMG3 decides to go bigger and steal the YouTube Remote from YouTube Headquarters. Basically a GOD-TIER ITEM, since you can do anything with it. After stealing the remote, SMG3 one by one replaces the SMG4 crew with the Anti-Cast, resulting in all of them being reduced to ashes. But Mario then saves the crew by getting them out of the place they were stuck in (which was the Meme Graveyard) and into the real world. After WOTFI 2020, SMG3 is cast into the Meme Graveyard, forever stuck. After some time, SMG3 was redeemed by the cast, although he still retained his personality disgust for SMG4.

**CHARACTER DESIGN:** In 2020, SMG3 was similar to a Mario color variant, and so was SMG4. RATING: **2/5**

**MOTIVES:** SMG3 was always an evil individual, having committed multiple crimes, but this is the most heinous act he has attempted to date. REPLACING the SMG4 crew, and taking control of the SMG4 series was something else by FAR. All because he was constantly being treated like just another variant of SMG4, but he wanted to be something more. Not only replacing, but trapping the crew in the Meme Graveyard, to just rot for the rest of their lives! RATING: **4/5**

**CRIMES:** There weren‚Äôt many crimes SMG3 committed that were linked to the YouTube Arc, but I was able to piece together what he did. First, he completely plagiarised SMG4‚Äôs content and videos, as he used the Anti-Cast to REPLACE SMG4‚Äôs friends. Not only that, but he also stole a high-security item from YouTube HQ, which is considered the most guarded place in the world ‚Äîthe YouTube Remote. Ideally, he also took advantage of the Anti-Cast aggressively while they made videos together, as well as Mario. RATING: **3.5/5**

**IMPACT:** This had a significant effect on the series, as SMG3 was given a new home, the Meme Graveyard. On top of that, it gave Meggy a human voice, finally, in WOTFI 2020, and presented us with a WHOLE BRAND of new characters, which was the Anti-Cast! However, I feel like the Anti-Cast have been so low recently, especially for characters like Rob, Belle, and Whimpu. Plus, SMG3 left the Meme Graveyard to live in his new coffee shop. RATING: **3/5**

**FINAL RATING: 12.5/20**



**6. NILES / ZERO (SMG4 COSMOLOGY SAGA \[2021-2022\]) -**¬†

Summary: One of the biggest villains in SMG4 history. Niles/Zero is the main antagonist of the SMG4 Cosmology Saga, which is the Genesis Arc and Revelations Arc combined. The God Box created him to help SMG0 and Fred save their universe, which led to the creation of the Meme Graveyard and the Meme Life Cycle. However, it wasn‚Äôt enough, and Niles wished to create the ‚Äúperfect universe,‚Äù which ended very badly and killed Fred, turning him into the Eldritch SMG0. Some time later, Niles failed to convert Spudnick into their new avatar, so he decided to go for Mario. He used Axol‚Äôs body as a host to hide amongst the crew and take advantage of the Guardian Pods. After WOTFI 2021, Niles was split into two, causing both Niles and SMG0 to revert to their original forms, which ultimately led to Axol's demise. Niles used his proper form to manipulate Melony throughout the Revelations Arc, eventually revealing who he was underneath. He then controlled Melony‚Äôs Deity form and proceeded to go to the God Box and rejoin with SMG0 to become its eldritch form once again. However, Melony broke free of Niles and destroyed Niles once and for all, as well as the God Box exploding because of SMG1 and SMG2. In the end, Niles was forgiven by SMG0, as they both went to heaven, hoping Fred was waiting for them on the other side.

**CHARACTER DESIGN:** We finally get a design made by SMG4, and he looks AMAZING! Niles, in his original form, is already cool to look at, as he genuinely resembles a regular high schooler, making him blend in perfectly at Omnia Academy. But the Eldtritch design is badass, as he looks so eerie to look at. His one eye resembles a zero, as does his grotesque body, with horns on his head. The team worked with this design, and they straight up DELIVERED!¬†

RATING: **4.5/5**

**MOTIVES:** Creating the so-called ‚Äúperfect universe‚Äù sounds terrifying as it already was, but it was even scarier seeing it throughout the saga. Niles attempted to destroy the current universe to create his perfect one, sacrificing everyone in the process. RATING: **5/5**

**CRIMES:** You can already tell what my rating is, because Niles was a monster. He committed mass omnicide, as he destroyed universes and attempted to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom universe. Kidnapped the Mario recolors as well as SMG4, SMG3, and Mario, and used the Mario recolors and AXOL and mass brainwashed their minds. There are probably worse things Niles has done, and I couldn‚Äôt list them all. RATING: **5/5**

**IMPACT:** I expected Niles and the saga to make a massive impact in the series, and I was kind of right. Melony now draws manga to continue Axol‚Äôs legacy, which he still couldn‚Äôt continue to do. But sadly, that‚Äôs probably it. The series doesn‚Äôt even reconsider that SMG4 and SMG3 are MEME GUARDIANS, and if they do, it‚Äôs not for a long time. I'm not sure, but I wanted to create an impact similar to the Anime Arc, leaving trauma with Meggy. However, we don‚Äôt see that often in the cosmology saga, and it‚Äôs disappointing. RATING: **3/5**

**FINAL RATING: 17.5/20**



**7. LAWYER KONG (THE LAWSUIT ARC \[2022\]) -**¬†

Summary: Lawyer Kong (AKA Funky Kong) is the main antagonist in the Lawsuit Arc. Lawyer Kong attempts to take Mario away to get him back to work on Nintendo, but he eventually fails and is stopped by Meggy. He proceeds to SPLIT the kingdom into two, with Nintendo and Non-Nintendo characters separated. The crew tries to fight back by Luigi creating memes in his van to cure everyone back to normal. Sadly, Miyamoto signs a super DMCA, causing all non-Nintendo characters to DIE. However, Mario takes a contract with Judge Kirby, which brings the crew back to life. After WOTFI 2022, Lawyer Kong loses the trial and resumes his shenanigans.¬†

**CHARACTER DESIGN:** I liked how they did Lawyer Kong‚Äôs design, to be honest. They customized an already existing Nintendo character, but gave him a custom outfit like a tuxedo. On top of that, they gave him a custom headband saying ‚ÄúNintendo,‚Äù and overall, it looks cool! However, it IS still an existing character, but with some cool additions. RATING: **3/5**

**MOTIVES:** To the crew, I can see why he was seen as so evil. He wanted to eliminate all non-Nintendo characters, basically KILL the SMG4 crew, and he did! He completed his motives, but eventually lost afterwards in WOTFI 2022. RATING: **4/5**

**CRIMES:** I couldn‚Äôt find any crimes that Lawyer Kong committed that are considered ILLEGAL, but he did a couple of law violations. He abused his power extensively in his role at Nintendo, dictating the Mushroom Kingdom by separating everyone based on their identities. He also attempted genocide by erasing all non-Nintendo characters with the Super DMCA, which he SUCCEEDED, thanks to Miyamoto. RATING: **4.5/5**

**IMPACT:** I didn‚Äôt like how the Lawsuit Arc impacted SMG4, but I‚Äôm not letting my emotions get into the review. It‚Äôs insane how much impact the arc had on the series, because it set a new path for SMG4, considering he isn‚Äôt a Mario variant anymore. On top of that, it opened up a lot of new merch to be shown in the series, as well as new potential characters getting their redesigns, like Meggy and Tari! Plus, it set up one of the biggest sagas ever in the series‚Ä¶

RATING: **5/5**

**FINAL RATING: 16.5/20**

Yesterday, I finished my final brew of Manhattan‚Äôs Shoondhisa Natural. Frustratingly, I never achieved consistent results with this coffee. The cups were not bad but I had a lot of issues with clarity. 

Don‚Äôt judge but I use chatgpt to help me brew. I ask it for brew recipes, to help tinker my brews, and to keep a log of my brews. When I mentioned the lack of clarity, it mentioned that my grinder, a stock fellow ode gen 1, can‚Äôt keep up anymore with the type of specialty coffees I‚Äôve choosing to brew. 

That was a light bulb moment for me. It explains why I‚Äôve not been able to enjoy coffees from Dak or even September, as I probably should have. 

So now, I‚Äôm sitting an impasse. Do I get fellow gen 2 burrs, ssp burrs, or do I just simply upgrade to a better grinder? I‚Äôm currently pourover/filter coffee only, using a plastic origami brewer. 

I got Dak big apple and Onxy Eclipse on route. So would appreciate any advice.

When I got to the window, she said, ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù in a pretty dismissive tone. I explained politely, and she just handed me a new drink and closed the window without another word.

I‚Äôve only had this for a week so my thoughts so far:

Good

Build quality (but I‚Äôve never been hands on with a Profitec or ECM so can only compare with my previous Sage machine).

Incredible range of settings and control available

Heats up relatively fast (though coming from Sage Duotemp Pro so getting used to it not being ready in 30 seconds still)

Makes great coffee - noticeably better than my Sage machine 

Huge capacity drip tray so can wash portafilter easily

Superb pre infusion capabilities

Excellent hot water spout

Very powerful steaming

Bad

Water tank, which I knew I‚Äôd hate. Hard to fill in situ with tiny hole on top. Feels cheap. To take out you pull out the pipes which drip everywhere. To work out how much water is left you have to peer in with a bloody torch. Why couldn‚Äôt they have used a Mara style tank for goodness sake?

Steam knob is something the reviews mention as cheap but it‚Äôs not just that but the steam valve which feels vague and insubstantial. Can see why these start leaking after a while.

Getting sloppy and sticking pucks quite a lot.

Standard portafilter is a design feature I guess but also bulky and you have to press down on the spout to tamp since you can‚Äôt just rest its side on the corner of a tamping station. Prefer the bottomless portafilter.

But probably my biggest gripe is how badly set up the machine is from the factory. For the first few days of use I found it an absolute nightmare. I quickly worked out how to get the display to show actual not target temperature and could see that the temp was fluctuating wildly. And the coffee that it made was really not very good. Even thought I‚Äôd made a mistake buying it. Then I found Dave Corbey‚Äôs guide on the advanced LCC settings. Thought I may as well try them so went through meticulously and adopted all of his settings. Afterwards a different machine. Stable, controllable, producing wonderful espresso.
Today I checked the user guide that came with the machine to see that it suggested I register with Lelit to access an extended manual. So I did (not a quick process) only to get a message to say no manuals available. 

Ok so Google next and found it on some random site. Very interesting read, which largely contradicts many of the default factory settings. Brew at 9 bar it says (machine came set to 12.5). Here are some useful example preinfusion settings it says (defaults were totally different and near useless). A few other examples too which beg the question that if Lelit are aware of the best settings then why the hell don‚Äôt they ship their machines with them by default???

Still, now that I have the machine set up much better I‚Äôm getting used to it and really starting to enjoy it üòä

however anyway i am now off paroxetine and i was travelling today. when i reached home my bp suddenly reached 155/90 while i was resting with no stress or anxiety. i was really worried because despite measuring it many times it was not going below 150 at all which was weird. i took cabbage juice and ate an egg and took beetroot juice which generally knocks off 15-20 points even in anxiety and it just didnt budge at all. i had only eaten a banana since the morning and a coffee from starbucks. i became really worried as it wasnt coming below 150/92 and i called my doc who asked me to come in only if i went to 180+ then also he said it was not an emergency but he would give me a clonzapam and monitor it at the hospital. i told him that i had eaten a very very heavy buffet last night and i was fasting., he didnt say anything.

anyway i kept monitorning and became even more worried but then my mom asked me to eat something. i refused and went out for a walk and did some skipping. came back still wouldnt budge from 150/90

i ate a slice of bread and half a slice of a pizza worried it might go up more. checked my bp and its down to 130/80?? How??

Read This Review,"The **CUIJ9 DBM-8P1 Coffee Grinder** has become a staple in my daily coffee routine, and I tested it extensively to write this review. As someone who values the art of brewing fresh coffee, the ability to grind beans to perfection is non-negotiable. This burr grinder boasts a set of features that immediately caught my attention. It offers an 18-position grind selector, a generous removable 8 oz. bean hopper, durable stainless steel construction, and automated functions that promise consistent performance. But as with any product, there are noticeable pros and cons I discovered while using it.

**Design Aesthetics and Build Quality**  
A quick glance at this grinder, and you can‚Äôt miss its brushed stainless steel look. It‚Äôs sleek and blends seamlessly with modern kitchen setups. Measuring 7.13‚ÄùL x 6‚ÄùW x 10.75‚ÄùH, it occupies minimal counter space, which is a huge plus for anyone with limited kitchen real estate. While it‚Äôs not flashy, the design is pragmatic and well-thought-out. The removable grind chamber and cord storage are welcome touches for someone like me who battles clutter every day. I appreciate it being lightweight at just 4.5 pounds, making it easy to move around when needed. On the downside, the stainless steel finish does attract fingerprints and smudges, which means frequent wiping if you‚Äôre particular about maintaining its shine.

**Performance and Coffee Grinding Consistency**  
Whether you're after an ultra-fine Turkish coffee grind or a coarse French press texture, the 18-position grind selector delivers exactly what you need. Sliding the dial to my desired grind was a breeze, though finding the perfect spot on the finer settings did take some tinkering. The burr grinding mechanism ensures that every grind is uniform, which makes a night-and-day difference in the coffee's taste and aroma. Compared to a blade grinder I‚Äôve used before, this model completely eliminates inconsistencies that can ruin your brew. 

**[Looking for CUIJ9 DBM-8P1 discounts? Check Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00018rrrk/)**

However, anyone expecting whisper-quiet grinding might feel disappointed. It‚Äôs not the loudest grinder out there, but the noise at full grind isn‚Äôt subtle, especially in the early hours when others are still asleep.

**Key Benefits of the Grinder**  
- The burr grinding system ensures uniformity, creating well-balanced coffee grounds.  
- The 8 oz. removable bean hopper and grind chamber make cleaning and refilling simple.  
- Automatic features, like the electric timer for turn-off after the cycle, add convenience.  
- The grind chamber is sizable enough to prepare coffee grounds for up to 32 cups.  
- Compact design with useful details like cord storage saves counter space.  

**Drawbacks to Keep in Mind**  
- Noise levels can be intrusive for early morning use.  
- Stainless steel is prone to smudges and requires regular cleaning.  
- Achieving optimal grinding settings for finer textures might involve trial and error.  

**Ease of Maintenance and Usability**  
With its removable bean hopper and grind chamber, cleaning this grinder is ridiculously easy. I liked that it even comes with a scoop/cleaning brush, which makes routine maintenance a no-hassle task. But I will admit, dismantling parts often felt a bit too delicate. It works for everyday users like me, but someone with less patience for fiddly parts may feel differently.

**Other Options**  
When I compared this grinder with similar products like the Baratza Encore and Capresso Infinity, it stood out for affordability and ease of use. However, the Baratza Encore is often praised for its quieter operation and more precise grind adjustments, which made me slightly envious. The Capresso Infinity also matches this model in consistency but includes other grind settings for espresso enthusiasts, making it a competitive alternative. Where this product excels is in grind capacity and the straightforward functionality that demands little effort on hectic mornings.

**Bang for the Buck Analysis**  
This coffee grinder does have some stiff competition in the market, but from a price-to-features perspective, it outshines many in its category. While I‚Äôm not allowed to divulge the exact cost, it sits comfortably in the affordable spectrum while delivering quality that feels more premium. Given its 18 grind settings and overall user-friendliness, it‚Äôs a solid pick for most homebrewing enthusiasts. However, if noise is an absolute dealbreaker, you might want to explore pricier alternatives.

(Part 1),"I wasn‚Äôt supposed to get a brain scan. I was scheduled for a minor surgery‚Äîgallbladder removal. Nothing scary. I‚Äôd been having strange abdominal pain for months, finally got the referral and a date.

The surgeon‚Äôs office called me a week before the procedure. ‚ÄúJust one last thing; we‚Äôd like to get some imaging cleared beforehand.‚Äù I thought it was a formality. A precaution. So I showed up at Midtown Memorial for the MRI. It‚Äôs one of those hospitals that looks fine from the outside but kind of falls apart inside. Stained tiles, burnt-out lights, and that waiting room smell of lemon cleaner mixed with old coffee.

The MRI tech was a guy named Wes. He was in his early 40s, pale, and quiet. He looked like someone who used to be in a band but now just listens to music alone in his car. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hear a lot of noise. Try not to move. If you feel nauseous, squeeze the panic bulb, and we‚Äôll stop the scan.‚Äù It seemed normal enough.

If you‚Äôve never had an MRI, it‚Äôs like being locked in a plastic tube while someone jackhammers the outside. It‚Äôs loud in a way that disrupts your whole body. About halfway through, I heard a soft, ringing tone. It wasn‚Äôt part of the machine. It sounded like a wine glass being played‚Äîa pure, high sound. It felt like it was inside my head. I almost pressed the panic bulb. Then the scan finished.

When I came out, Wes was already at the monitor. He didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre good to go.‚Äù I asked if everything looked normal. He hesitated, then smiled quickly. ‚ÄúYeah. Just a little artifact. The neurologist might want a follow-up.‚Äù He handed me my papers and basically shoved me out the door.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I went to the fridge for water and saw a photo: me, Lisa, and Toby at her cousin‚Äôs cabin. It was taken a few summers ago. Only‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt remember the dog. Not just his name‚Äîthe entire dog. There he was in the picture, curled between us, and I was holding the leash. But I had no memory of him.

I called Lisa. We‚Äôre still friendly. ‚ÄúWhat was our dog‚Äôs name?‚Äù ‚ÄúToby?‚Äù ‚ÄúRight. Sorry, brain fog.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ do you have any pictures of him?‚Äù ‚ÄúDan, you took most of them.‚Äù I checked Google Photos‚Äîthere were dozens. Toby at the lake, Toby in a Halloween costume, Toby on my lap. None of it felt real.

I requested my MRI images. When they came, I opened the file. Dead center in the scan was a perfect black circle. Not a tumor, not a blur. Just a void. And in the corner, the label read: ‚ÄúRegion of non-data.‚Äù

I called the hospital. I got transferred five times and left voicemails. When I finally reached someone, they told me there was no MRI on file. No technician named Wes, no appointment. I checked my voicemail. The original message‚Äîthe one confirming the scan‚Äîwas now just static.

This morning, I woke up and realized I couldn‚Äôt remember my mom‚Äôs birthday. I know she was born in April. I know she likes carrot cake. I remember her voice, her laugh, her hands. But her birthday? Gone. If anyone out there has experienced something similar‚Äîmissing memories, strange scans, false photo memories‚Äîplease let me know. I think there‚Äôs a hole in my brain, and I think it‚Äôs starting to pull everything else in with it.

Edit: If this post disappears or if my account vanishes, please comment my name. Daniel Mercer. Even if you don‚Äôt know me. Maybe memory is stronger when it‚Äôs shared.",1,1753800081.0,creepypastachannel,0,1.0,False

ADHD, or **Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder**, is more than a buzzword that makes teachers everywhere reach for another cup of coffee ‚òï. It‚Äôs one of the most common **neurodevelopmental disorders** affecting millions of children and adults globally. The key features? **Inattention**, **hyperactivity**, and **impulsivity**‚Äîall rolled into one uniquely wired brain. ADHD is not caused by bad parenting or too much sugar (sorry, grandma! üç¨). üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßÉüéà

# Spotting ADHD: What Are the Signs? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüîçüóùÔ∏è

Is someone always losing their keys, forgetting why they entered a room, or starting five projects before breakfast? That might be classic ADHD at work! Officially, the symptoms include:

* **Inattention:** Trouble focusing, organizing, or finishing tasks
* **Hyperactivity:** Fidgeting, talking excessively, or an inability to sit still
* **Impulsivity:** Interrupting, blurting out answers, or impulsive decisions (think: online shopping at 2 a.m.)

Of course, everyone does these things sometimes. **ADHD is diagnosed when these behaviors are persistent, disruptive, and occur in multiple areas of life** (home, school, work). üè†üè´üíº

# Is ADHD Just for Kids? Not Even Close! üéíüë©‚ÄçüíºüîÑ

It‚Äôs a common myth that **ADHD only affects children**‚Äîbut adults can and do have ADHD, too! Many adults only discover their diagnosis after their child is evaluated. Adult symptoms can include chronic disorganization, lateness, and juggling tasks like a circus act (minus the applause üé™). üé≠‚è∞üíº

# Getting Diagnosed & Exploring Treatment ü©∫üìëüíä

Diagnosis involves working with a qualified professional‚Äîusually a psychologist, psychiatrist, or pediatrician. There‚Äôs no single test; instead, it‚Äôs a **comprehensive assessment** using medical history, behavior checklists, and input from family or teachers.

**Treatment** is not one-size-fits-all. The best approach often combines:

* **Medication:** Stimulants or non-stimulants
* **Behavioral therapy**
* **Practical strategies** (think: planners, reminders, and sticky notes)
* **Support and accommodations** at school or work

üìùüß©ü§ó

# Mythbusting ADHD‚ÄîWith a Smile! üòÖüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí¨

* **Myth:** ADHD is just an excuse for laziness. **Fact:** It‚Äôs a real, brain-based condition‚Äînot a character flaw!
* **Myth:** Only boys have ADHD. **Fact:** Girls get it too, but symptoms can look different and often go undiagnosed.
* **Myth:** You‚Äôll just outgrow it. **Fact:** Symptoms may shift, but most people continue to experience them. (Think glitter after a craft project‚Äîeverywhere! ‚ú®)

üéâüé®üßπ

# Living with ADHD: Tips, Humor, and Hope üåàüîë‚ú®

* Use **planners** and phone reminders üìÖ
* Break big tasks into small steps
* Create routines‚Äîand embrace the chaos sometimes!
* Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help (or forgiveness for the ‚Äúforgotten laundry‚Äù üôà)

# Why Raising Awareness Matters üì¢ü§ùü´∂

The surgeon‚Äôs office called me a week before the procedure. ‚ÄúJust one last thing; we‚Äôd like to get some imaging cleared beforehand.‚Äù I thought it was a formality. A precaution. So I showed up at Midtown Memorial for the MRI. It‚Äôs one of those hospitals that looks fine from the outside but kind of falls apart inside. Stained tiles, burnt-out lights, and that waiting room smell of lemon cleaner mixed with old coffee.

The MRI tech was a guy named Wes. He was in his early 40s, pale, and quiet. He looked like someone who used to be in a band but now just listens to music alone in his car. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hear a lot of noise. Try not to move. If you feel nauseous, squeeze the panic bulb, and we‚Äôll stop the scan.‚Äù It seemed normal enough.

If you‚Äôve never had an MRI, it‚Äôs like being locked in a plastic tube while someone jackhammers the outside. It‚Äôs loud in a way that disrupts your whole body. About halfway through, I heard a soft, ringing tone. It wasn‚Äôt part of the machine. It sounded like a wine glass being played‚Äîa pure, high sound. It felt like it was inside my head. I almost pressed the panic bulb. Then the scan finished.

When I came out, Wes was already at the monitor. He didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre good to go.‚Äù I asked if everything looked normal. He hesitated, then smiled quickly. ‚ÄúYeah. Just a little artifact. The neurologist might want a follow-up.‚Äù He handed me my papers and basically shoved me out the door.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I went to the fridge for water and saw a photo: me, Lisa, and Toby at her cousin‚Äôs cabin. It was taken a few summers ago. Only‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt remember the dog. Not just his name‚Äîthe entire dog. There he was in the picture, curled between us, and I was holding the leash. But I had no memory of him.

I called Lisa. We‚Äôre still friendly. ‚ÄúWhat was our dog‚Äôs name?‚Äù ‚ÄúToby?‚Äù ‚ÄúRight. Sorry, brain fog.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ do you have any pictures of him?‚Äù ‚ÄúDan, you took most of them.‚Äù I checked Google Photos‚Äîthere were dozens. Toby at the lake, Toby in a Halloween costume, Toby on my lap. None of it felt real.

I requested my MRI images. When they came, I opened the file. Dead center in the scan was a perfect black circle. Not a tumor, not a blur. Just a void. And in the corner, the label read: ‚ÄúRegion of non-data.‚Äù

I called the hospital. I got transferred five times and left voicemails. When I finally reached someone, they told me there was no MRI on file. No technician named Wes, no appointment. I checked my voicemail. The original message‚Äîthe one confirming the scan‚Äîwas now just static.

This morning, I woke up and realized I couldn‚Äôt remember my mom‚Äôs birthday. I know she was born in April. I know she likes carrot cake. I remember her voice, her laugh, her hands. But her birthday? Gone. If anyone out there has experienced something similar‚Äîmissing memories, strange scans, false photo memories‚Äîplease let me know.

I‚Äôve got my calories/day down to between 1700-1800, never more than that. I weight everything I eat, even the butter on my toast which is so little it barely register on the scale.

Been doing this combo for 3.5 weeks straight and I only weigh myself on Monday mornings before breakfast. But the scale isn‚Äôt budging at all. If my TDEE is correct, I should be in a 400 calorie deficit on diet alone. And then the walking is certainly burning at least 100 calories per walk, probably more. So what gives?

1mcd71n,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1mcd71n/robert_ludlum_books_in_order/,Robert Ludlum Books in Order,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share some thoughts on an author who truly defined the spy thriller genre for me: Robert Ludlum. If you've ever wondered about diving into his fast-paced world, or perhaps want to explore more about his incredible legacy, you might find this guide on [Robert Ludlum Books in Order](https://pdfhive.com/robert-ludlum-books-in-order/) pretty helpful.

### Stepping Into Robert Ludlum's World

For anyone who loves a good high-stakes, twisty, international conspiracy, Robert Ludlum is an absolute must-read. He's probably best known for creating Jason Bourne, and his books are legendary for their breakneck pace and intricate plots. Imagine a regular person suddenly thrust into a world of espionage, secret organizations, and betrayal, often with a case of amnesia, and you're pretty much ready for a Ludlum novel. There are no slow starts here; you're thrown right into the action from page one.

### What I Really Liked

What truly stands out about Ludlum's writing is the sheer propulsion. His books are like a runaway train, and you're just gripping the armrests, unable to look away. The pacing is intense ‚Äì every chapter ends with a cliffhanger, making it incredibly hard to put the book down. You just *have* to know what happens next!

The plots are incredibly complex, full of layers of conspiracy and double-crosses. It‚Äôs like a giant puzzle where you're never quite sure who the good guys or bad guys are, or even if there *are* good guys. This constant state of paranoia and suspicion keeps you absolutely hooked. You feel the character's desperation and confusion right along with them. It‚Äôs a real masterclass in suspense.

I also appreciate his writing style ‚Äì it's direct and pulls no punches. While the plots are intricate, the language itself is clear and gets straight to the point, which makes those complex narratives much easier to follow. It‚Äôs engaging without being overly flowery, which I think is perfect for this genre.

### A Few Things to Consider

While I'm a huge fan, I'll admit that sometimes the plots can get *very* convoluted. There are so many layers of conspiracy and so many different agencies involved that you occasionally have to pause and piece things together. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but if you prefer very straightforward narratives, it might take a bit of adjustment.

Also, some might find that his characters, while resourceful and compelling, sometimes serve the plot more than being deeply explored individuals. However, for a thriller of this kind, the plot *is* the main character in many ways, and the individuals are there to navigate its treacherous waters.

### Should You Read Them? Absolutely!

If you're a fan of thrillers, spy fiction, or just love a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, you absolutely *have* to pick up a Robert Ludlum novel. They are perfect for long flights, lazy weekends, or any time you need to escape into a world of pure adrenaline. If you're looking for a deep character study or a slow-burn literary read, this might not be your first choice. But for pure escapist entertainment and a thrilling ride, he's unmatched.

### A Beginner's Guide to Diving In

For new readers, or even new to thrillers, diving into Robert Ludlum can seem a bit daunting with so many books. Here's a simple approach:

1.  **Start with an iconic standalone:** *The Bourne Identity* is a fantastic entry point. It sets the tone perfectly and introduces you to his signature style.
2.  **Embrace the pace:** Don't try to intellectualize every single detail immediately. Just let the action sweep you along. Ludlum's strength is his momentum.
3.  **Allow yourself to be confused:** The plots are meant to be complex. Part of the fun is unraveling the mystery alongside the protagonist. Don't worry if you don't grasp every organization or conspiracy on the first pass; it usually clicks into place.

**Tools Needed:** A comfy chair, maybe a cup of coffee, and an open mind for plot twists galore!

**Personal Tips:** These books are perfect for binge-reading. Once you start one, you'll probably want to tear through the rest. Don't be intimidated by their length; they read incredibly fast. To explore more of his incredible work, consider browsing the [Robert Ludlum Books in Order](https://pdfhive.com/robert-ludlum-books-in-order/) list, you'll find plenty to keep you hooked.

**Motivational Advice:** Don't hesitate to jump into this genre! Robert Ludlum offers an exhilarating escape, a chance to be a secret agent from your living room. There‚Äôs a thrill in unraveling these complex webs, and the satisfaction of reaching the end after such a wild ride is immense. If you're curious about the full scope of his work, checking out the [Robert Ludlum Books in Order](https://pdfhive.com/robert-ludlum-books-in-order/) list can be a great starting point.

1mcd6ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/KratomVibes/comments/1mcd6ql/white_kratom_capsules_my_3month_journey_from/,White Kratom Capsules: My 3-Month Journey From Coffee Addict to Natural Energy Convert,"https://preview.redd.it/9ecs6vohtkff1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ab5f58a14730b8879ac41bec139893006b33da3d

So you‚Äôre curious about white kratom capsules? I totally get it.

Three months ago, I was downing four cups of coffee daily and still felt sluggish by 2 PM. Then my coworker mentioned these little white capsules that gave him clean energy without the jitters.

That‚Äôs when I started my deep dive into white vein kratom‚Äîand honestly, it changed my whole energy game.

# What Are White Kratom Capsules?

White kratom capsules contain powder made from young Mitragyna speciosa leaves harvested early when the veins are still pale. Each capsule typically holds¬†**0.5‚Äì0.7 g**¬†of powder, so there‚Äôs no measuring or bitter taste‚Äîjust pop and go.

The main difference from red and green strains is the alkaloid profile:¬†**higher mitragynine content**¬†and¬†**lower 7-hydroxymitragynine**, which gives white varieties their energizing kick instead of sedation.

# Why White Vein Kratom Hits Different

Compared to other vein colors, white strains rank highest for:

* **Concentration**¬†(69.4 vs 49.8 for red)
* **Energy boost**¬†(66.5 vs 52.9)
* **Stimulation**¬†(62.6 vs 48.8)

Users call it ‚Äúcoffee‚Äôs cleaner cousin‚Äù‚Äîalertness without the crash or jitters.

# White Maeng Da Kratom Capsules: The Gold Standard

White Maeng Da is the most popular white strain. It originated in Thailand when farmers grafted Indo and Thai kratom trees together‚Äîhence the nickname ‚Äúpimp grade.‚Äù

What sets it apart:

* **Longest-lasting white strain**¬†effects
* **Most potent stimulation**
* **Mood lift**¬†alongside energy

# How to Take White Kratom Capsules

* **Beginner**: 2‚Äì3 capsules (1‚Äì1.5 g)
* **Regular users**: 4‚Äì6 capsules (2‚Äì3 g)
* **Experienced**: 6‚Äì8 capsules for stronger effects

**Timing**: Morning or early afternoon only‚Äîwhite strains can keep you up if taken too late. Space doses¬†**6‚Äì8 hours**¬†apart to avoid tolerance.

Look for lab tests, American Kratom Association certification, and money-back guarantees when choosing a vendor.

# What to Actually Expect

* **Low (1‚Äì2 g)**: Clean energy, focus, mood lift
* **Medium (2‚Äì4 g)**: Strong stimulation, motivation boost
* **High (4+ g)**: May feel overstimulated for some

Capsules kick in in¬†**30‚Äì45 minutes**¬†and last¬†**4‚Äì6 hours**.

# Capsules vs. Powder

Capsules win for:

* No taste
* Consistent dosing
* Portability

Powder wins for:

* Faster absorption
* Lower cost per gram
* Flexible dosing

# Side Effects & Red Flags

**Common**: Nausea, dry mouth, constipation  
**High doses**: Jitters, anxiety, headache  
**Warning signs**: Needing daily kratom to function, more than three doses per day, withdrawal when skipping.

# My Honest Take

For me,¬†**3‚Äì4 capsules**¬†of White Maeng Da at 7 AM gave clean focus for 5‚Äì6 hours‚Äîno crash. Taking any after 2 PM meant staring at the ceiling all night.

**Sweet spot**: 2‚Äì3 capsules at sunrise, a second dose around noon if needed.

Have you tried white vein kratom capsules? What‚Äôs worked for your energy and focus, or what‚Äôs holding you back?

however anyway i am now off paroxetine and i was travelling today. when i reached home my bp suddenly reached 155/90 while i was resting with no stress or anxiety. i was really worried because despite measuring it many times it was not going below 150 at all which was weird. i took cabbage juice and ate an egg and took beetroot juice which generally knocks off 15-20 points even in anxiety and it just didnt budge at all. i had only eaten a banana since the morning and a coffee from starbucks. i became really worried as it wasnt coming below 150/92 and i called my doc who asked me to come in only if i went to 180+ then also he said it was not an emergency but he would give me a clonzapam and monitor it at the hospital. i told him that i had eaten a very very heavy buffet last night and i was fasting., he didnt say anything.

anyway i kept monitorning and became even more worried but then my mom asked me to eat something. i refused and went out for a walk and did some skipping. came back still wouldnt budge from 150/90

i ate a slice of bread and half a slice of a pizza worried it might go up more. checked my bp and its down to 130/80?? How??

Anyways, I'm setting things up to record and my mom comes into my room and says that she'd like to go to the casino to play her free play and go to lunch, I tell her that I don't personally feel like going, but she can go if she wants to. She then keeps on badgering me telling me things like ""It'll be fun"" and ""We don't have to spend any money, it's all free play and free food"" I tell her that I don't feel like going because 1 at this casino you have to put money into the machine to activate freeplay and 2 it's 10am on a Monday, I have things I have to work on. Anyways, after about 10-15 minutes of her continuously badgering me about this, I get a little irritated and tell her to just leave me alone and go if she wants to go. I said it this time in obviously a slightly irritated tone because it was constant, texts, talking and coming into my room telling me that she wants to go to the casino. Now, as I said, I told her that she can go if she wants, but I don't feel like going and that's my personal choice. I told her I don't want to lose any of the money that I have and she got pissed. She started saying I was yelling at her and being mean to her and all types of things like that. Then obviously I called her out and said that she got pissed all because I said I didn't want to go. She tried telling me that I was ""judging"" her for wanting to go, when all I told her is that I don't want to go. Then after about 10 minutes or so of back and forth of her not getting the point and me starting to get really irritated at this point, she plugs her ears and says she ""doesn't want to hear me because I'm being mean to her"" I then continue on to tell her that I'm not mad at her and that I'm not yelling at her she tells me that I am. I am not, I am talking slightly above my normal tone because I am getting irritated as anyone would. Then this is where I do start to get a little mad, she then plugs her ears telling me that she doesn't want to hear me tell her that what she wants to do is ""wrong"". I never even told her that it was wrong, I just told her that I didn't want to go. She does this EVERY SINGLE TIME I don't just agree with her and it doesn't matter what it is. If I get any type of irritated, not even angry, but irritated or frustrated then she acts like I'm the worst person in the world and that I'm so mean. She literally told me before that she thinks I need to go on some type of mood stabilizer because I get irritated with her when she gaslights me. For context, I personally think she's a narcissist, she's not diagnosed, mainly because she won't step foot in a psychologists office and I also know that she is a diagnosed bipolar based off of what both of my uncles have told me as well as my godmother. She refuses to accept the diagnosis and refuses to take her meds because she thinks there's nothing wrong with her.

Thats the main problem

I've tried pretty much everything - Notion, Obsidian, Google docs, Evernote. They all have the same problem.

Does anyone else have this issue? How do you solve it? I feel like I'm losing so many good ideas just because I can't decide where to put them fast enough. Maybe I'm just overthinking it but its really frustrating.

This post is practically a cry for help, because why does it hurt SO BAD every time I get my cavities filled? Is this something other people face? They could numb my entire face, and it still feels like someone is driving an ice pick through my jaw every single time. When I was a kid, I would be reprimanded for ""overreacting"", and as an adult, I am told I am being childish. Every dentist I have been to has been very condescending about this, and I am not sure what to do. I have a couple of cavities I need to get filled, and I am hesitant because I cannot imagine dealing with the pain again. I am told by every subreddit that cavity fillings should not hurt, but even the ""surface-level"" cavities I get filled feel like someone is ripping my tooth straight out of my mouth.

Am I doing something wrong? I brush twice a day, floss, don't drink coffee or alcohol, and rinse my mouth after eating anything acidic/sugary, and have done this for at least a decade. I am extremely careful with my teeth because I dread having to get a filling, having to tell the dentist of how much pain I experience, and then being shamed for it anyway.

For context, I have no issues with pain tolerance anywhere else. I am covered in tattoos, broken several bones, lost toenails, you name it. Specifically, getting a cavity filled is the worst pain I have ever felt. Every. Time. Regardless of what dentist, what tooth, or how far along it is. ",1,1753799380.0,askdentists,4,1.0,False
1mccymr,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1mccymr/humans_can_be_very_motivatingand_annoyingly/,Humans can be very motivating...and annoyingly insistent.,"I lost...my species prided itself on our speed, fast long range sprints were our specialty, one thing I could bring to represent my entire home system, trillions upon trillions in each sector would watch me run in blinding speeds that even Humans called me a ""Blink and you'll miss"" type of athlete. 

The feeling of me knowing that I held the pride of being the top fast runner in the entire galactic sector...and I lost. 

Not horribly, I was a close second. 

I saw nothing but the back of the younger racer as I lost the final stretch. 

My pride was crushed, I tried to console myself, my coach who had been with me day 1 did his best to still wake me every morning for practice, but I could not muster the guts to even jog. 

So he dragged me against my will to this little food shop in the city. 

Apparently he is old friends with the Human here, who has been serving rice and noodle bowls for the past 2 decades with his wife who makes little pastries and delicious coffee. 

He sat me down, urging me to eat since I have not eaten anything filling for 2 days, just instant reheatable food. 

The shop owner looked at me ""It's the middle of the morning, you'll need something to fill your stomach"" 

He scoops up a cup of rice and plates it up with some bacon bits and some sunny side up eggs. 

I look at him, my eyes filled with defeat as he scoffed ""You giving up so easily? You are a huge piece of work if one loss has you destroyed"" 

I felt that bite my pride ""HEY I HELD THE TOP SPOT FOR 8 YEARS"" 

The Human looked at me and smiled ""Good, if you got some pride, you can eat at least a late breakfast"" 

My eye twitched at how brazen the Human was, but my dormant stomach came alive as I gripped it ""...I'll eat"" 

My coach laughed as he was eating his own late breakfast, a bowl of noodles with spicy chili powder. 

I finished my meal, it was simple but filling, like a breath of fresh air. 

My coach offered me to try running a bit nearby, try to keep my basics fresh in my mind and body, something the old Human taught him from his years as a pilot in the Navy Logistics. 

As I got up I could see the old Human taking a break from cooking as his pots simmered and sat down in a makeshift pilot seat. 

I snort out my nose as I wanted to one-up the old Human. 

I ran fast laps, my coach timing me and giving me dry towels to wipe my sweat. 

Kids, a lot of them Human came up to me for autographs, not a single insult came my way for losing. 

""You'll win next time right?"" they'd say. 

""Don't worry, I also lose sometimes, but I can go again"" said another. 

Human Kids, they tried to follow behind me, I'd laugh and try to slow down for them, letting them get a glimpse of what it's like to race in the big leagues. 

Lunch came and my stomach grumbled. 

Coach got me back to that food shop as I sat down, and ordered a big bowl of noodles and tried the chili  powder, the spicy kick had me eating two bowls. 

I took a break to help me digest with a tall glass of water. 

The Human kept stirring and practicing his piloting skills in simulations. 

I asked my coach ""Why does he do that, isn't he retired since he is clearly an elderly?"" 

My coach patted me on the back ""He's like you, except he's more fucking stubborn"" 

I raised an eyebrow ""How is a Human and me similar? We're different species"" 

He simply said ""Yes but you both lost once, you lost a race, he lost his copilot, his wife's brother"" 

The old lady nodded ""Yes, their ship was struck with debris, before the ship's ray shields could seal the opening, my brother was sucked out alongside his seat into space, he never forgave himself for that mistake"" 

I looked at his simulations, all rescue operations. 

""So that's why he's being rude? I gave up?"" I ask 

The old lady laughs ""No, because he knows you'd dwell on it for too long, he just expedited the process"" 

My coach laughs ""Yeah, old Dyke wanted you to get a grip faster than he did, besides, you got next year, Dyke didn't get a second chance, so he doesn't want you to fumble the chance he never got"" 

I looked at my half empty bowl of noodles and finished it before waiting till I could run again. 

""Fine, I'll try my best next year"" 

Old Man Dyke finished his practice ""Good, you can start now, I'll prepare what I can at first light and you can come by for lunch, dinner is my wife's job so dinner will be actually good food"" 

His wife pats his back ""You old coot, still complimenting my cooking?"" 

the Old Human snorts like me except more stubborn ""I lost to you too many times that I ended up being the main cook of our shop"" 

The old lady smiled so warmly ""You'd better do your best next year, so let's prepare now"" 

And that's how it went till next year's Galactic Olympics. 

Every first light I'd be at his shop for a bowl of breakfast, run with my coach till lunch, eat a hearty meal, and then run all afternoon with the kids watching. 

Apparently being a popular stop for a Galactic Sector Famous athlete has it's perks for Dyke and his wife. 

People kept ordering the ""Champion's Bowl"" 

The Olympics began, I found myself next to the guy who beat me last year, he looked at me ""Ready?"" 

I smiled at him ""You're on"" 

I won, by the width of a hair. 

He looked at me ""I beat you last year, you beat me this year, so next year is the tiebreaker right?"" 

I shook his hand ""You better believe it"" 

We both went to Dyke's place, he looked at me and smiled ""Good, more athletes, the more popular my place becomes"" like he became a marketing genius. 

Now his shop is considered a traditional place for Athletes to eat before a major tournament, a Human-specific good luck charm. 

Was it a bullshit superstition that boosted sales? YES 

Did I give a flying fuck? Yes, cause the fucking rookies keep trying to steal my personal seat before the tourney!!

After a few days, we decided to meet up for a coffee. The date was super nice, we talked for around three hours and had a good vibe.
When I got home I texted her saying I had a really good time and would love to see her again. She replied enthusiastically saying she felt the same and wanted to meet again too.

On Monday I proposed to meet up the following Saturday and she asked if Sunday worked instead. I said sure. During the week, we kept texting a couple of times a day, the conversation flowed really well and she even came up with different ideas for future dates, like cooking together and other stuff like that.

Then something changed.
On Friday she mentioned that since the weather might be bad, maybe we could change the plan and decide spontaneously on Sunday morning. I agreed and suggested we could aim for around 4 PM. She didn‚Äôt reply.

Then on Sunday morning, she texted saying that after all the parties and so on, her social battery was at zero and she felt super exhausted, so she preferred to cancel because she wouldn‚Äôt have been good company.
I replied saying it was totally okay and that she could feel free to reach out if she wanted to meet another day during the week.

But since then, complete silence.
And now I‚Äôm just confused. The vibe seemed great, the chat was super engaging and she looked very proactive even with ideas for next dates. I don‚Äôt get what happened.

I know she might be going through a rough patch or just not into it anymore, but the shift was really sudden.
Part of me wants to write her again to check in or see if she‚Äôs still interested, but I also don‚Äôt want to look pushy or desperate.

Am I just overthinking it? Or was that her way of slowly disappearing?

Also, if I were to write again, what would even be okay to say?

TL;DR:
Great first date, she was enthusiastic and suggested more ideas. We planned a second one for Sunday but she canceled that morning saying she was exhausted and had no social battery. I replied kindly, she never wrote back. It‚Äôs been several days. Ghosting or just bad timing?",1,1753799262.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False
1mccwdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1mccwdf/theres_a_hole_in_my_brain_i_think_its_eating_the/,There‚Äôs a Hole in My Brain. I Think It‚Äôs Eating the World    (Part 1),"I wasn‚Äôt supposed to get a brain scan. I was scheduled for a minor surgery‚Äîgallbladder removal. Nothing scary. I‚Äôd been having strange abdominal pain for months, finally got the referral and a date.

The surgeon‚Äôs office called me a week before the procedure. ‚ÄúJust one last thing; we‚Äôd like to get some imaging cleared beforehand.‚Äù I thought it was a formality. A precaution. So I showed up at Midtown Memorial for the MRI. It‚Äôs one of those hospitals that looks fine from the outside but kind of falls apart inside. Stained tiles, burnt-out lights, and that waiting room smell of lemon cleaner mixed with old coffee.

The MRI tech was a guy named Wes. He was in his early 40s, pale, and quiet. He looked like someone who used to be in a band but now just listens to music alone in his car. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hear a lot of noise. Try not to move. If you feel nauseous, squeeze the panic bulb, and we‚Äôll stop the scan.‚Äù It seemed normal enough.

If you‚Äôve never had an MRI, it‚Äôs like being locked in a plastic tube while someone jackhammers the outside. It‚Äôs loud in a way that disrupts your whole body. About halfway through, I heard a soft, ringing tone. It wasn‚Äôt part of the machine. It sounded like a wine glass being played‚Äîa pure, high sound. It felt like it was inside my head. I almost pressed the panic bulb. Then the scan finished.

When I came out, Wes was already at the monitor. He didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúOkay, you‚Äôre good to go.‚Äù I asked if everything looked normal. He hesitated, then smiled quickly. ‚ÄúYeah. Just a little artifact. The neurologist might want a follow-up.‚Äù He handed me my papers and basically shoved me out the door.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I went to the fridge for water and saw a photo: me, Lisa, and Toby at her cousin‚Äôs cabin. It was taken a few summers ago. Only‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt remember the dog. Not just his name‚Äîthe entire dog. There he was in the picture, curled between us, and I was holding the leash. But I had no memory of him.

I called Lisa. We‚Äôre still friendly. ‚ÄúWhat was our dog‚Äôs name?‚Äù ‚ÄúToby?‚Äù ‚ÄúRight. Sorry, brain fog.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ do you have any pictures of him?‚Äù ‚ÄúDan, you took most of them.‚Äù I checked Google Photos‚Äîthere were dozens. Toby at the lake, Toby in a Halloween costume, Toby on my lap. None of it felt real.

I requested my MRI images. When they came, I opened the file. Dead center in the scan was a perfect black circle. Not a tumor, not a blur. Just a void. And in the corner, the label read: ‚ÄúRegion of non-data.‚Äù

I called the hospital. I got transferred five times and left voicemails. When I finally reached someone, they told me there was no MRI on file. No technician named Wes, no appointment. I checked my voicemail. The original message‚Äîthe one confirming the scan‚Äîwas now just static.

This morning, I woke up and realized I couldn‚Äôt remember my mom‚Äôs birthday. I know she was born in April. I know she likes carrot cake. I remember her voice, her laugh, her hands. But her birthday? Gone. If anyone out there has experienced something similar‚Äîmissing memories, strange scans, false photo memories‚Äîplease let me know. I think there‚Äôs a hole in my brain, and I think it‚Äôs starting to pull everything else in with it.

Edit: If this post disappears or if my account vanishes, please comment my name. Daniel Mercer. Even if you don‚Äôt know me. Maybe memory is stronger when it‚Äôs shared.",2,1753799230.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,False

I do not have the luxurious space that I would have in a van I am looking at moving into a 2008 Rav4 which is a small SUV.

I have been editing my life down to as little as possible and now I am going to add a 5 gallon bucket to the mix. I mean I guess if I could figure out how to mount my 6'2"" self up there in a pinch but I am thinking that I will make a point of taking care of my business when coinvent and avoid coffee unless I am going to be somewhere for a while.

I am male so I have a couple of potential dedicated piss jugs ready to go but having a poop bucket seems like a smart thing but more of a van life thing.

Also I have found something that would take up less space and though it seems kind of expensive I do take this crap seriously so I would invest in it if it seems prudent.

# Backstory: Yeaia Nolas ‚Äì The Quiet Librarian of Witherham

In the mist-veiled highlands of¬†**Witherham**, a forgotten village tucked into the shadows of the Loen Kingdom‚Äôs outer reaches, life remained still and slow. Seventeen years after the cataclysm‚Äîthe death of all gods and angels at the hands of the Ancient Sun God‚Äîmost of the world scrambled to rebuild and some succeeded. But Witherham only ever¬†*remembered*.

At its heart stood a timeworn stone building, half-covered in ivy and silence. It was the village library‚Äîhumble, with only a few shelves and a crooked desk‚Äîbut it held something more than books: it held¬†**Yeaia Nolas**.

Raised by her grandfather, the last proper scholar in the village, Yeaia inherited both the library and the thirst for knowledge. She grew up between crumbling tomes and fading scrolls, absorbing legends, histories, and theories long since dismissed. Her wardrobe, as stark as her demeanor, was always monochrome‚Äîblack dresses with white accents, high collars, gloves, and laced boots. She spoke with an elegance that didn‚Äôt belong to rural life, and listened more than she spoke. The villagers called her¬†""**The Crow of Witherham**""‚Äînot out of malice, but quiet reverence.

Beneath her calm surface, Yeaia‚Äôs mind whirled with questions. The sanitized post-cataclysm narratives never sat right with her. Why were the gods so easily forgotten? Why did her village's older texts contradict the newer ones? Why did her dreams sometimes echo with voices speaking in dead tongues?

**She wanted to know.**

One evening, while cataloging a box of fire-damaged books, she discovered a¬†**journal wrapped in wax cloth**, hidden between a fictional travelogue and a child‚Äôs almanac. It bore no author‚Äôs name. The writing inside was lucid, intelligent‚Ä¶ and dangerous.

When she laid her eyes on it, Yeaia felt her heart pounding.

With trembling but gentle hands, she opened it.

It spoke of the¬†**‚ÄúOrder of Returning Eyes‚Äù**, a forgotten sect of knowledge-keepers who believed truth was not lost by accident, but buried by¬†**design**. The final pages hinted at a ritual‚Äîand a location:¬†**a forest ruin east of Witherham, where stars once wept.**

The discovery made Yeaia ecstatic. There was something out there that could answer her questions.

Compelled by instinct more than logic, Yeaia followed the journal‚Äôs guidance. At the ruin, she met a man‚Äîor something in a man‚Äôs form‚Äîcloaked in shadow and candlelight. He did not give a name. He only asked:

**‚ÄúDo you wish to**¬†***read***¬†**the truth, or become part of it?‚Äù**

Before Yeaia could answer, the man left. As if he already knew her answer.

He left her with a single item: a small sealed vial and a folded page, left blank‚Ä¶ until midnight.

That night, beneath the cracked dome of the ruin, Yeaia drank the potion.

She felt weird. The moment she drank the potion, her vision turned blurry. The insides of her body felt like it was boiling. She clenched her head while panting from pain.

It took a while but the pain subsided. Then it happened.

Her mind cracked open like a book‚Äôs spine. Languages she never learned bloomed in her mind. Forgotten lore arranged itself into coherent patterns. Truths rose like ink from hidden pages. And for the briefest moment, countless¬†**eyes**¬†blinked in unison through her vision.

She knew she would never be normal again.

She was no longer merely reading history.  
She had stepped into it.

Now a¬†**Reader**, Sequence 9 of the¬†**Reader Pathway**, Yeaia possesses a sharpened intellect and flawless memory, able to sift truth from chaos, decipher rituals, and perform the oldest forms of divination. Her senses are tuned to meaning itself‚Äîshe sees connections others cannot.

Yet the man had left her something more.

When she returned to her library, she found a letter resting on her desk, sealed in wax that shimmered between black and white.

*‚ÄúPoster City awaits. There, you will find books not yet written, and questions not yet asked. If you wish to ascend, begin your journey there. In time, the City of Miracles will open its gates to you.‚Äù*

When she read the letters contents, she felt hesitant. But the temptation of brand new knowledge and a history she didn't knew existed, she made up her mind.

Yeaia packed her belongings. She left the key to the library with a trusted neighbor and walked quietly into the morning fog, dressed in black and white, her suitcase lined with ink and parchment.

That day was the start of her journey.

Now she walks the stone streets of¬†**Poster City**, a coastal town full of whispers, missions, and uncertain fates. She frequents¬†**Kat‚Äôs Caf√©**, listening to the rumors over coffee and studying mission boards like puzzles. Her eyes are calm, her aura precise. And somewhere beyond the waves lies the¬†**City of Miracles**, where truths too large for words may yet be found.

She will not just be reading the world anymore.

She is preparing to¬†**become part of it**.",2,1753798999.0,LordofTheMysteriesRP,0,1.0,False
