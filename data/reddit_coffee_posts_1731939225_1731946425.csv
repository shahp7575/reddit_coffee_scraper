1gu8ah1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gu8ah1/advice_losing_a_friend/,Advice? Losing a friend.,"
I live in Canada and am 20. My partner and I decided to rent a really nice house in Toronto. I’m friends with a guy named Alan, who has been running low on money. We’ve known each other for four years since high school, and I was surprised when he committed to a woman and has been with her for three months. Alan has always been a ladies' man, and he frequently complains about his girlfriend, Jane, behind her back. When Jane hangs out with Alan and me, it is so awkward as Alan acts different and Jane hates noise, she would shush or roll her eyes anytime I raised a question. Alan always plays weird sexual games sexualizing other campus girls and lies about his finances to Jane.

Regarding our renting situation, my partner and I rented a house under both our names, planning to offer the other rooms for free to friends. We offered a friend a room for free, but he insisted on paying, so I lowered the rent to less than 10% of what my partner and I are paying. While looking at houses, Alan had no problem sharing spaces with my friends.

The house we rent now has three bedrooms and two bathrooms. When we were looking at less desirable houses, Alan was fine with sharing a shower with another renter, as that was always part of the plan. However, since moving into our nice three-bedroom, two-bath home, and after Jane saw how nice it was, she started inserting herself into choices, like how she wanted the TV to be placed and that she wanted her own shower. Alan never mentioned to Jane how little rent he was paying, and he had previously stated he was fine with sharing. After Jane saw the house, Alan expressed that he wanted his own shower. Additionally, my partner was not allowed to wear certain tops around Jane, who does not live here. Since dating Jane, Alan has changed; he talks differently and acts like a jerk.

Alan wanted his own shower but did not want to share for 10% of the rent. I could have covered it myself, but he didn’t like that. Jane seemed to be speaking for him. As far as I knew, Alan wasn’t particularly fond of Jane in front of me; he would criticize her habits, while Jane would list things Alan was banned from doing. Is it normal for a couple just three months in to be quarreling about such things?

Alan claimed it was uncomfortable to share a shower with a woman renter, so I looked for a male roommate. Once I found one, Alan said he felt uncomfortable again. It seemed he just didn’t want to share a shower for a few minutes a day. Later, I discovered Jane wanted the bathroom for herself! She wanted her face cream here, shampoo there, and all her things everywhere, insisting that no one was allowed to touch or enter her “bathroom.”

Given the entire situation, we knew Alan had to leave. Jane was effectively controlling everything in the house. We had just moved in, and new furniture like fridges and TVs were arriving. Jane wanted half the fridge and freezer to herself, and I bought the Samsung fridge it’s quite costly and we were always going to share the shelves but now Jane wanted his own shelf and his own area in the dining room. We hadn’t fully moved in, and we were already arguing about a shower. After Alan left, saying he wanted the shower to himself, we told him this wasn’t going to work out. The next day, we had a discussion on campus, emphasizing that Jane had nothing to do with it and that we wanted only Alan there to discuss the issue.

Somehow, Jane found out we wanted to talk without her and insisted on tagging along, forcing Alan to bring her or she would throw a fit. Before I continue, I should mention that Jane appears to be mentally unstable. I saw her with Alan every day, and she often looked like she had been crying, with smudged makeup. Alan would complain and make fun of Jane's mental state. He was quite broke and couldn’t afford to meet her expectations, which included flowers, chocolates, and elaborate date nights. While there’s nothing wrong with her desires, Alan simply couldn’t afford them and resorted to using his parents' credit card.

When Jane arrived with Alan, I was flabbergasted. Alan went back on our agreement and told us to hold off until Jane finished eating her food. We waited for two hours, and I had had enough. I told Alan he was being unreasonable about sharing the apartment. Jane jumped in, speaking for Alan while he sat silently. She was completely irrational, insisting that if we wanted him to share a shower, we should have told him before he moved his bed in. We realized Alan never mentioned to Jane that we were always going to rent the third room to another woman, and Jane assumed the shower was included in Alan's rent. She even claimed Alan paid equal rent, which was a lie he hid from her.

I suggested compromising on a schedule, but Jane immediately shot it down, insisting that Alan wanted the bathroom. My partner interjected, stating, “No, he (Alan) doesn’t. He has never once disagreed with sharing a shower for a few minutes with another renter when we talked about Alan moving in. You just wanted the entire room for yourself.” This angered Jane, and she exclaimed, “F U.” That’s when a verbal fight broke out in public. Eventually, Jane stormed off, upset that she didn’t get her way, while I stood my ground about the house being our property. Alan then drove Jane home after she had a meltdown in front of a coffee shop because he wanted to discuss things with me.

Ultimately, Alan decided to move out—not just because of the apartment situation, but because his girlfriend forced him to cut ties with me. Alan couldn’t afford the rent and had to move back in with his parents in Montreal. We decided to end our friendship because of this argument of Alan defending Jane’s disgraceful behavior. 

I apologize for the lengthy explanation, but I could really use some advice. I was quite close to Alan, and everything fell apart due to the apartment situation, possibly involving Jane. It escalated so quickly. I realize that if this had happened before Alan moved in, the situation would have been even worse. Alan and I share a group of friends and I have no idea what crazy story Jane will force him to tell our friends. ",1,1731946242.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1gu8a9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gu8a9r/more_kf_78_questions_particularly_around_milk/,"More KF 7/8 questions, particularly around milk","I am so tempted to get this, but I have a very expensive and unsuccessful history with coffee machines.  I got a Breville with a built-in grinder, but otherwise it was not automatic.  You had to tamp/etc yourself.  I tried and tried and tried and never once pulled a shot I could drink.  Eventually, I used it only as a milk steamer, and then I acquired a Nespresso (built by Breville) that had its own milk steamer, and the Breville is currently unused.

I am WARY of another expensive machine and probably should not do it.  I saw a post recently where someone could not get a good shot out of a KF8 and that definitely reminded me of my own experience.  I feel like I could be throwing good money after bad.  I make my triple latte every day with my Nespresso and it works for me.  I still am always tempted by getting my own beans.  One thing I am really nervous about is the quality of the milk frothing and temp.  The Nespresso does a nice job with this.  Some days are better than others, and it is never that super dense milk, but it is good and more importantly it is hot.  One complaint I see so often with these machines is that the milk doesn't get hot enough.  I put mine in an insulated mug and drink it over a long period of time, and like it to stay hot.  Is the KF7 or 8 going to disappoint me?  I just don't know what the difference is between this kind of system and an actual frothing wand.  ",1,1731946228.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Well, I posted here for advice a few days ago, I got some good ones and managed to sharpen up my start to pull this off. I tried a USA+Kz start, rp output is fantastic but I lagged in boost and was not able to build the ship on time(needs to go into the shipyard \~20jan 2024). Both the mine and then ship got delayed because there was not enough boost to supplement the mined materials. I'm sure its possible with the USA too though but might need to pick up heavy chemical rockets and reusable rockets(which you have the RP to do). I ended up going with Rus+Kz+Jap, all on 100% boost then filled up to the CP cap with EAU members and one CP research nations. Luna mine operational 8th October 2023, I was then making 8.8 boost/month and 1.1k research.

1gu89p9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1gu89p9/i_think_the_billing_for_my_hotel_stay_was_shady/,I think the billing for my hotel stay was shady,"We typically stay at Hilton brand hotels for the last several years when we travel, usually Hampton Inn if it has good reviews, so I feel like I know how a stay should be at this point. We just stayed at a Hampton Inn while visiting family for an event and the stay was weird.

I did digital check in and it surprisingly went smoothly getting the digital key. I stopped by the front desk to get two waters and provided my room number when asked so she could check my status. She said because I’m silver I could not have water since they recently had a meeting and they are “cracking down” on giving out water. She said it’s now only for gold and diamond members. I was surprised and said as a silver member it’s normally one of the benefits, but not a biggie (it’s just water). She said I could have one water because it’s good customer service.

When we were leaving I tried to do digital check out and check the bill prior to checking out, but it said on the app that I was already checked out. I asked my mom if she went to the desk to check us out and she said no. I walked back into the hotel and told the front desk I hadn’t checked out yet, but that I was already checked out on the app. She asked for my room number and confirmed I was checked out.

This one’s on me, but I didn’t realize when we booked that they charge for parking. Usually when I’m charged, it’s because they don’t have on-site parking and they have a parking lot across the street or it’s a parking garage, and parking is limited. They have their own parking lot 20 feet from the door and it’s mostly empty.

After I got home I was checking my emails for the receipt and saw they charged $10 more for the stay. I also noticed I had a second confirmation email that was unread (I did a Hilton search in my inbox so it populated). It was sent after the first one, but had the exact same confirmation number and was for $10 more. Again, not a big deal but weird.

I called Hilton Honors and asked them about the billing issue and while I was on the phone asked for the “rule” on the water. She said Hilton can’t do anything and I’d have to call the hotel to fix any issues including billing issues. She apologized for the inconvenience and said she filed a case number.

Something super small and again not a big deal at all, but I’m not a coffee drinker and asked for hot chocolate because packets weren’t on the counter with the coffee and hot water. Literally the first time I haven’t seen hot chocolate packets as an option. They said that’s only for winter time so they don’t put it out. I said oh okay. Then they said they’ll get one from the back for me. I think November is close to winter, but whatever.

I’m kind of thinking this hotel owner is just super cheap and trying to cut corners, but the two emails with different prices under one confirmation number is a red flag to me and also the room checking out automatically. If they’re changing the billing for each guest by $10 and no one’s noticing, that ends up being a lot of money right?

TLDR; Hilton says they can’t do anything about an overcharge that a hotel is adding ($10). It’s not a big deal, just annoying.",2,1731946186.0,Hilton,0,1.0,False

1gu84mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1gu84mo/scumbag_bd_drama/,scumbag BD drama,"what up, bromos. i hope you've had your coffee/tea/oat milk chai tea latte and you're ready to be fuckin PISSED. this is a doozy.

for backstory - my kid, ween, is 14F. she's been struggling HARD lately - we moved schools, she started HS, and we are now cohabitating with my partner (45M) and his two kids (17X and 10M) which is a whole other adjustment bc she never had siblings before. she also has ADHD, ODD, and anxiety - all of which she is treated for with meds and biweekly counseling. she sees her biodad (we'll call him BD, 41M) once a week for dinner and every other weekend, per our legal custody agreement. BD still lives with his parents, smokes a ton of weed, has a bullshit minimum wage job because he doesn't \*want\* to do anything more... just your classic shiftless layabout. his time with her is primarily spent playing video games and not talking.

a few weeks ago we found out she had, for the 3rd or 4th time, stolen a cell phone from her grandma (BD's mom). she does this sometimes and downloads snapchat to create accounts (despite knowing she’s not allowed to have them due to her history of making incredibly unsafe decisions about social media). she has her own phone, but it's a Bark phone and is super locked down, so she was trying to get around restrictions. 

(side note: seriously cannot sing the praises of Bark enough - if you want to check them out, please use my [referral link](https://www.bark.us/?ref=8T59HJH) lol)

we also found out that she had gone into my room at some point and and stolen some of my makeup, my used (not dirty) underwear (wtf?!?) and broken into my safe to get an old iphone out of it. this wasn’t an impulse move - she had to sit in front of my safe and figure out a 4 digit code to open it. i have no idea when she’d have been able to do so, because we don’t really leave her home alone - for exactly this reason, she's stolen makeup and that same phone out of my room in the past. we already had the safe to keep electronics in, but at this point we decided to put a keyed lock on our bedroom door and install cameras outside to make sure we knew the comings and goings of the house. i've already locked the key in my room twice lol.

the week of halloween, she asked if she could go to a party at a friends house in the neighborhood and i told her absolutely not because she’s grounded for the stealing shit and also it's her dad's weekend anyway. that friday (11/1) she used a friends phone to text me from school saying she didn’t want to go to her dads that night and that if i was going to make her go she wasn’t coming home. i told her we’d talk when she got home. instead of coming home, she left school at dismissal and took off and was trying to get to the town we used to live in to visit a boy she likes there. the cops brought her home after she went to a nearby elementary school and asked an adult there to give her a ride to our old down. as she was talking to the deputy who brought her home, she told him she was trying to avoid her dad and grandparents “screaming at her” for all the stuff from the last two weeks, and also that her grandpa makes her uncomfortable because sometimes to wake her up in the morning he smacks her butt or pulls the back of her bra strap to snap it. now, this was the first i or her dad had heard of this, and while i believe her and believe it makes her uncomfortable, i think that it was partly a deflection to call attention away from herself. but because she said it to a fucking cop, it had to be submitted via report and investigated (as i believe it should be). but her grandparents are denying it, saying it never happened, being combative with the CPS investigator, and have banned her from the house ""for the foreseeable future"".   
  
obviously, this creates an issue with custody stuff, bc BD lives there. i am trying to be flexible with him and understanding of the position he is in (which he 100% created), but this past weekend he took her for a few hours sat and sun and brought her home early both days because he was out of money for activities and ideas of things to do with her. 

i offered to talk about changing child support payments if it would help him get his own place so that he could have his weekends with her, and his response was that he would rather change our custody agreement because, and i quote... ""even if i was on my own, i don't see any way i am comfortable having her stay with me bc she lies and steals from her own family on a constant basis. god forbid i cross her by telling her to do something she doesn't want to and she puts a CPS case on me. we can talk about adjusting our agreement.""

bromos... this useless asshat has done the bare fucking minimum since we split up, when ween was 3. he's barely followed the custody agreement as it is. until this year, he only took her every other weekend despite our order also including overnight on wednesday nights. i've never asked for an increase in child support. i just got him this year to cover her medical insurance because it would double in cost with my job change and he is low income so he gets child health plus for barely anything.   
  
she has seen it all along, and less time would really not be the worst thing for her. but i also need breaks from this shit, and he is entirely too comfortable putting all of the risk and responsibility on me. i am the one that always takes her to drs appointments, stays home with her when she's sick, figures out her mental health care stuff - he has never taken any part in any of it. i just... wish i could keep my kid free time. every other weekend is not even that fucking much. it's time for my partner and i both to decompress, get some house projects done, etc.

He knows exactly what to do and has good control, but every now and then we'll go through a power struggle patch where he'll refuse to go potty despite dancing around holding his penis or his butt. It's a lot of fun. 

He's great at going potty at home and school, but when we are out and about very few public potties are up to his standards. There are some he is mysteriously drawn to (at the coffee shop, or the Cuban restaurant), and other perfectly nice ones that he flat out refuses to use. He's scared of the auto flush but he rejects potties that don't have it. This weekend we played potty roulette and took him to multiple places - he rejected 3 perfectly adequate potties, all while saying he had to pee, which pissed me off and made me think it became a power and control issue.

We are going on a 3 hour flight for Thanksgiving and I'm dreading it. There's no way he'll accept a busy airport potty, and an airplane potty seems even scarier! I don't want to put him in a diaper since it's been 5 months since he potty trained, but I don't want him to be traumatized. My other idea was getting him to stand up to pee, but I tried that this weekend and it was a total fail (screaming, kicking, crying). Over the summer I tried bribing to just get him used to it - it worked once, but has never worked again. 

Any tips either for this trip or in general? At this point I'm kind of just fine with him peeing his pants in the hope he'll then learn. I was sympathetic to his fear of new bathrooms at first, but at this point his refusal to use a public bathroom is no longer working for our family and is making it so we can go out and do things on the weekend.

As of now, the sink, the toilet and the wall shower isn't plumbed yet, but it's just a matter of time until I find a Pipe Wrench. Speaking of, here's the bathroom.

Since I use the Lifestyle mod, I actually need to visit those two places from time to time. The Doorway Curtains mod allowed me to improvise on my shower curtain: regular long white curtains work just as well.

Thanks to the Functional Appliances 2 mod, I'm actually able to brew myself some coffee on the go! And finally, the storage room.

Each crate is able to hold up to 130 weight units, and there are 15 such crates. This makes this room alone capable of holding up to 1.950 weight units in total, without the outside storage, like a roofrack or trunk storages.

And that ends my tiny base tour, just as tiny as my freshly built base itself. Just wanted to share it with y'all since I'm quite pleased with how this interior turned out to be!",2,1731945646.0,projectzomboid,1,1.0,False
1gu80m5,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety_support/comments/1gu80m5/my_friends_journey_to_overcoming_anxiety/,My Friend's Journey to Overcoming Anxiety,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share something I learned from a close friend of mine who has been dealing with pretty severe anxiety for a while. Watching them struggle has been tough, but over the past few months, they’ve really turned a corner, and I thought their journey might be helpful for others.

Here’s what they told me has been making a difference:

1. **Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises**: They found that dedicating just a few minutes each day to deep breathing exercises has significantly calmed their anxiety, which used to be overwhelming.

2. **Cutting Back on Caffeine**: One of their biggest changes was reducing caffeine. It wasn’t easy to give up their daily coffee, but it’s helped lessen the jitters and nervousness.

3. **Therapy**: They started seeing a therapist, which has been a game-changer. It gave them the tools to recognize their triggers and develop effective coping mechanisms.

4. **Helpful Online Resources**: They also mentioned this [guide to overcoming anxiety](https://www.anxietysupports.com/l/Overcoming-Anxiety), which offered some new strategies they hadn’t thought of before. They found it to be a really straightforward and practical resource.

I hope this might be useful for anyone else who’s in a similar place. What have been your go-to strategies for managing anxiety?

Now, with the guy I’m currently seeing, I casually mentioned how I’ve never owned a single pair of heels in my life. Today, out of nowhere, he took me to the mall under the pretense of grabbing coffee and insisted on buying me a pair of heels! Of course, I paid him back because I don’t like accepting gifts often. Now, I’m officially 6 feet tall—finally his equal! 🤣

By r/RingocrossStories

I walked to the Universal Coney Island. It was just a few blocks away from my apartment complex. My neck was still damp from the cool shower. In my eagerness to see Marie, I had thrown on a pair of black jeans and a black button up. I was also wearing the leather jacket she had given me as a gift. I was supposed to meet her for coffee, and then we had to conduct some business on behalf of her family at a local nightclub. 

It was not unusual for Marie to be late. I thought of what she could possibly be doing and almost decided against leaving a voice message: 

“Hey, Marie, it’s William. Called you. Anyway, I’m at the place I thought I finally convinced you to try. Guess I was wrong. Return my call when you get this message.” 

I opened the glass door leading into the vestibule and saw a young girl waiting by the counter. We exchanged glances. That was all it took for my primitive side to take over... my vampire side.

Her perfume was intoxicating. The faint aroma of jasmine and wildflower made my fangs stiff. 

She turned around once she had noticed my shadow and asked, “Do I know you from somewhere?” 

“Do I seem familiar?”

“No. Can you please—""

“Did I startle you.” 

“You didn’t.”

“Even better.”

“Excuse me?”

“I couldn’t stop myself... from talking to you, of course.”

She scanned my eyes for deception. “Well, if you want to get to know me, you could start by buying me something to eat.” 

“Whatever you desire.” 

“Whatever I desire, huh?” 

I waved my hand towards the counter, and added, “I’d be a fool not to.”

“I like the way you put it,” she smiled, placing a finger to her lips as she thought about my offer. “Hmm. Well, can I have—wait, let me think. Okay, an order of nachos and a milkshake, I suppose.”

The Arabian guy behind the counter asked, “Is that it?”

“Wait. Do you want something?” she asked me.

“Medium, double-double.” 

She clasped my hand when it reached her waist and gently tugged it away. When she looked up at me, her look was one of surprise. My boldness was her curiosity, and so she softly spoke, “You haven’t even told me your name.”

“Are names really important?”

“You can’t be serious.” 

“William, what’s yours?”

“Juliet,” she smirked back.

“It suits you,” I kindly told her. 

“Thank you for the compliment.” 

“Okay. You guys can have a seat. The waitress will bring your food to you when it’s done,” the Arabian guy insisted.

Juliet was wearing a scarlet gown that had a pleated waistline. My primitive side wanted nothing more than to ravage her in that vacant restaurant. I wanted to give in to my nature so bad but... *No! Not here. Not now.* 

She turned to me and smiled. I had been in my feelings for so long. I hadn’t even noticed that she had left my presence and took a seat at the table nearest the exit. I wonder how long she had been watching me review her with my eyes. Meh. What does it matter? She’ll be dead soon...

Juliet took a seat upon the opposite side. And when I sat down across from her, she said, “A menu, waiter, couches. What kind of Coney Island is this?”

“It’s more like a restaurant, you like it?” 

“It’s homey. Look at all the silly pictures!” 

“You’re right. It is very homely.” 

“What’s your name? I didn’t catch it the first time.”

“William. William Chosen.” 

“What is that Italian, or wait, Greek maybe? Well, anyways, my name is Juliet Lansing. Nice to meet you, Mr. Bond.”

“Bond?”

“Yeah. ‘Mr. William. William Chosen.’”

“Why would you—""

“I’m just teasing.”

“Interesting. I guess.”

“Strange last name by the way.”

“If you only knew.”

“Why? What’s so funny?”

“Nothing. Nothing at all.”

“Pfft. The name fits.”

The reason why I was smirking was because I knew the origin of my last name. It was just that I couldn’t tell her that it was the surname given to a vampire of pureblood decent. I wouldn’t tell her in a million years something that sounded so outlandish. And besides, I had other plans for her.

“You know, you’ve been grinning ever since we sat down.” 

“It’s nothing really. I’m curious, where are you coming from dressed like that this time of the night?”

“It’s not even late. Anyways? To answer your question. I went over to Wayne State and turned in my application for next semester. Then I talked to one of the guidance counselors about financial aid. After that I stayed at the library until closing. Had to brush up on my history and stuff since that is what I’m going to be majoring in, well, African and Native American studies, actually.”

“How old are you, Juliet?” 

“Eighteen, and you?” 

“Twenty-two.”

“Let me see your license.”

“You don’t believe me?” 

“I just want to see it.” 

“I don’t have it.”

She glanced at my Rolex. “That’s odd?” 

I smirked. “No it’s not.” 

“Well. You shouldn’t walk around the city without an ID. It isn’t safe. Or smart. Something bad could happen to you.” 

“It’s funny you say that...” I murmured as I looked down at the carpeted floor. Magically, the colorful patterns had become interesting. Maybe not. Maybe it was the sudden guilt and shame that consumed me. At that moment I knew I wasn’t going to slay her. I wanted something more, but what that was I didn’t know. Something about her reminded me of my last victim, Lisa.

*Why did I kill her? Why?!*

“Are you okay, you look upset?”

I slid my hands through my hair. “Long story.”

“What do you want from me?”

“It’s funny you ask.” 

“Why is it funny.”

“You’d never guess.”

“Well, the answer’s no. I’m not going back to your place, so don’t even bother asking.”

“Why? Are you afraid?”

“I’m looking for something long term.” 

“You get asked quite frequently I assume?” 

She huffed. “Yeah. I’m getting tired of saying the same thing over and over. Why can’t the guy I’m looking for just—” 

“Okay, so which one of you folks had the coffee?” the waitress asked, breaking Juliet’s train of thought.

“I had the coffee, she has the other stuff,” I told her.

“Darn, I probably should’ve ordered more since he’s buying,” she jokingly shared with the waitress. 

She smiled while placing her food upon the table. “Here you go, sugar, take care of yourself.”

“You should probably just pour the salsa over your nachos.”

“Is that the logical thing to do?” she asked me.

“Yeah. It is.”

“Then too bad,” she said before dipping a chip into the container. “Maybe I’ll change my mind if you answer my question.”

“What was your question?”

“You know.” 

“I don’t.”

“What do you want?”

“Well, I wouldn’t mind taking you back to my apartment but—” 

“I already told you no?”

“Right…”

“So… do you have a car?” she inquired.

I stole a sip from my mug. “Yes.”

“Interesting, where do you work?”

“I do a lot of things here and there.”

“Things? Huh.”

“Yeah… things…”

“Like what.”

“Depends.”

“On what?”

“A lot of things.”

“Oh my God.”

“I know I’m being vague. But in my line of work, you have to be.”

“Oh yeah? Why’s that.”

“You can’t let people get too close.”

Juliet frowned. “Whatever. You’re probably a fraud.”

“Believe what you desire.”

“Look, I’m sorry. It’s late. I-I have to go.”

I grabbed her hand when she stood. “I want to see you again?”

“I don’t know you’re kinda creepy?”

“How so?”

“With most guys I can tell what they’re after, but with you it’s different. It’s like I know but I don’t.” 

“Here, I’ll give you my number. You can decide from there,” I said before jotting it down upon the nearest napkin. 

“Okay. I *might* call you.”

“Wait, will you be okay getting home?” 

“I’ll be just fine. Thanks for the food.”

She said goodbye, leaving me here to reflect upon my inaction. After letting out a deep sigh, I mumbled, “Why did I let her escape?” 

Disappointed in myself, I looked at my Rolex to see it was only 8:00 pm. “It’s getting late, huh,” I mumbled her excuse aloud just to see if it didn’t sound as ridiculous if I said it. Maybe shame was a good feeling. Maybe it was the thing I deserved for what I did to Lisa’s beautiful soul. I brought my hands to my face and relived the moment I sunk my fangs into her neck. 

“Come on, William, snap out of it. What would Marie say if she walked in and saw you like this?” 

“Need a refill, honey?”

“Um, no thanks.”

“Everything alright? You look a bit flustered.”

“I’ll figure it out.” 

“Suit yourself.” 

The waitress grabbed my empty mug. She looked to be about forty but hid her age well with makeup and decorum. Her apron was soiled in old food and coffee stains. She didn’t look too bad from the back, but was she good enough to *kill* was the question? Let’s see. I could wait for her to leave work, which should probably be very soon by the looks of it. Yeah. That’s it. I could easily follow her home and impale my fangs deep inside her neck. I wonder how good her blood tastes. I’ve never been with an older... eh… What was I thinking? Liten to me, rambling about like some desperate thief in the night without a light. Who’s next on my bucket list? The kind old granny at my apartment complex?

I slammed the money on the table and barged out the door. Oh, and just for my rapacious stupidity, I made sure to leave a forty-dollar tip for the hardworking waitress I fancied murdering. 

The cool, night air hit my face and flowed down my body. The relaxing sensation almost pulled me out of my warped frame of mind. I reached into my pocket for a cigarette. In the city I felt free. It’s funny. This abandoned street reminded me so much of my abandoned dreams.",3,1731945449.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

My (26F) ex boyfriend (30M) and I had dated for about 2 years and broke up for a little over a year. We reconnected and saw each other again for about 8 months before breaking it off again. 

A couple months after breaking it off, he contacts me to grab coffee, I figure there’s no harm in it and I go. Normal interaction, nothing crazy. We did end up sleeping together though. 

The following night, I saw on his story that he was at a concert with a group of girls I didn’t recognize, with one posting him on her story. I decided to text him apologizing for the night before as I didn’t know he was seeing someone. I felt bad for sleeping with him now knowing he was possibly dating someone. 

Now later this same night around midnight, I get a text from him saying “I love you so much. I’m willing to wait forever for you.” I was like WTF. The point of adding that to the story is I found out the next day that either right before or right after he texted me that, he slept with that other girl from the concert. 

He then asks to give our relationship another shot. I go back and forth and eventually say yes, and then he changes his mind. He is now seeing the other girl from the concert. (It’s only been about a week since all of this went down). 

Now my question is: Do I tell the woman he’s seeing that he was telling me he loves me and wanted to get back together? I feel like I would want to know if the guy I was seeing slept with his ex and told her he loved her the same night he slept with me. But I don’t want to cause drama either. 

TLDR; My ex told me he loved me and wanted to get back together the same day he slept with another girl. He’s now seeing the other girl. Do I warn her about him and tell her this all went down? ",0,1731945421.0,dating_advice,5,0.5,False

Some of you have already been applying to jobs early (and I highly recommend you do if you can––plenty of jobs are already open and in fact can be closing their application pools this month; you can see more details on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1gh67lh/psa_the_first_1l_summer_job_wave_is_today_many/)).

# If you have, you might now (or soon) be staring down one of the most important steps in launching your legal career: screener interviews. 

Whether you’re aiming for government, in-house, big law or otherwise, these short, fast-paced, first-round interviews are often your first opportunity to make an impression. 

So with that in mind, here’s what you need to know to prepare like a pro.

# What Are Screener Interviews?

**Screener interviews are short, typically 20-30 minute interviews (but they can be as short as 10-15) that serve as a first-round filter for jobs.** This can either happen independently of the traditional recruiting process or it can be part of recruiting events like OCI (On-Campus Interviews) or regional job fairs. 

**Think of them as professional speed dating:** firms and jobs want to assess whether you’re a good fit for their culture, your enthusiasm for their practice, and your ability to hold a polished, professional conversation.

If you perform well during your screener, you’ll likely receive a callback interview—a longer, more in-depth meeting with multiple attorneys at the firm/org. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves––I’ll post a guide on that in the coming weeks. 

If you want to know a bit about what to expect in the hiring timeline, there's a guide on that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/s/lsoH3J8Fus).

So let’s focus on nailing the screener first.

# Before the Interview

1. **Research the firm. Brownie points––network BEFORE you get in the room.**

This step can’t be overstated: show up knowing who you’re talking to and show that you can already fit in comfortably with the culture.

**Practice Areas:** What are the firm’s specialties? Even if you’re unsure about your long-term focus, mention areas that interest you.

**Office Strengths:** If you’re interviewing with a specific office, understand its key practice areas or clients.

**Firm Culture:** This is always a tough one but this is where networking ahead of time can go such a long way.  

# 1a) Networking to Talk About Firm Culture: Leveraging Connections During Screener Interviews

I want to talk about this section in depth specifically for a second because I think people sometimes misunderstand what you really do with this nebulous thing called networking. 

Networking isn’t just for the job search—it can also play a key role during screener interviews. **If you’ve already built connections with people at the firm (through coffee chats, alumni events, firm-hosted receptions, or whatever), this is your chance to strategically weave those into the conversation.**

# How to Bring Up Your Networks

Mentioning your connections (in a genuine and natural way) shows that you’ve done your homework and are genuinely interested in the firm. Here’s how to do it seamlessly:

**Name-Drop Naturally:** If you’ve spoken with someone at the firm, mention what you learned from them. For example:“I had the chance to speak with \[Networked Person’s Name\] recently, and they shared how much mentorship was a priority in the litigation group. That really stood out to me because I know how much I value building long term connections with my mentors. I’d love to know about your experience with your mentors here.”

**Highlight Insights:** Use your conversations to demonstrate deeper knowledge of the firm. For instance:“I heard from \[Networked Person’s Name\] that associates at this office often take the lead on \[X PRACTICE AREA\] cases. I am very interested in that practice and would love to hear about your experience with how those teams get structured for cases/deals like that in this office.”

# What If You Don’t Have a Connection?

No worries! Many candidates don’t. Instead, you can mention the firm’s reputation or reference specific events you’ve attended, such as their info sessions or diversity panels. For example:

“I attended the firm’s reception at \[Law School\], and it was clear how much emphasis you place on mentorship for junior associates. That aligns with what I’m looking for in my career.” Etc. etc. You get the idea. 

# Network Responsibly

While mentioning your connections can be impactful, don’t overdo it. Avoid coming across as though you’re name-dropping just for the sake of it. Use your networks to reinforce your genuine interest and knowledge about the firm, but **focus the conversation on your qualifications and fit.**

# Before the Screener: Build Your Network

If you haven’t already reached out to alumni or attorneys at firms you’re interested in, it’s not too late! Send polite, concise LinkedIn messages or emails to learn more about their experiences. In fact, your school likely has an alumni email list you can ask your career services for to get contact info of folks who currently work at those firms, and who have already consented to talk to current students. 

**In sum, networking early and mentioning how those networks helped you validate the culture of the firm/org is how you actually talk about culture and fit and prove that you are already a good match for that.** This really goes a long way when firms/orgs have to differentiate between hundreds of very qualified students. 

Now back to the screener!

# 2. Prepare Your Answers

You’ll need to answer common questions confidently. I have a list I’ve written in depth of basically every question I’ve ever heard asked in an interview prep guide I built that I’m happy to share–feel free to DM me if you want it. But here’s a couple you should have in your back pocket cold:

* **“Why this firm?”:** Tie your answer to specific aspects of the firm’s culture or practice areas. Again, networks are an easy way to say “The people make the difference, and here’s who made a difference for me.”
* **“Tell me about yourself.”:** Have a concise, polished response that connects your background (law school, internships) to your interest in the firm.
* **Behavioral Questions:** Prepare stories highlighting teamwork, problem-solving, or resilience using the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**.

# 3. Prepare Questions for Them

Have a few thoughtful questions ready for the end of the interview. **In particular, avoid questions you could easily answer with a Google search.**

**If it helps,** [**here’s a guide with a series of questions you can ask to show you did your homework on the firm.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigLawRecruiting/comments/1fazahq/questions_to_ask_in_an_ociscreenercallback/)

# 4. Polish Your Resume

Your interviewer may have only 2 minutes to skim your resume before speaking with you. Make sure it’s clean, professional, and highlights your experiences. 

**In particular, highlight research, writing, and analysis skills. This is your biggest value add as a brand new future attorney. Hammer that home as much as possible.** 

**Brownie points**: If you had a standout internship, think about how to discuss it in 1-2 compelling sentences that you can bring up in the screener. 

# During the Interview

# 1. First Impressions Matter

* Dress the part (business formal unless explicitly told otherwise).
* Make strong eye contact, smile, and deliver a confident handshake if in person. If it’s over zoom/a phone call, speak confidently, look into the camera, and make sure your space looks professional and clean.
* **Bonus:** [Here’s a guide on the things that firms judge a candidate on](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/1et28fv/a_guide_what_interviewers_at_a_firm_judge_a/) (like literally in the pieces of paper they have to write the review of you on after the interview)

# 2. Stay Engaged

**Remember, this is a conversation, not an interrogation.** Show interest in the interviewer’s questions, and don’t be afraid to let your personality shine.

The goal is to convey that you’re smart, hardworking, and someone they’d want to work with for the days that go sideways and you have to work with these people for 12 hours straight.

# 3. Be Concise and Clear

With limited time, don’t ramble. Answer questions directly and transition smoothly to the next topic.

**💡 Pro Tip: If you feel yourself going off on a tangent, pause, and wrap up with a clear takeaway. Don’t be afraid of a pregnant pause.**

# 4. Highlight Your Experiences

Don’t just list what you did during internships—show how your work is relevant. For example:

Instead of saying, “I worked at XYZ place,” try: “At XYZ place, I drafted legal memos analyzing \[specific issue\], which helped the firm decide how to approach \[specific outcome\].” Brownie points if you can weave in specific issues and tasks that are relevant to the org you’re applying to, i.e., “By drafting memos on X issue at Y place, I was able to better understand how \[XYZ process\] works in this practice area.”

# 5. End on a High Note

Thank the interviewer and express genuine enthusiasm for the firm. A simple “I’m really excited about the opportunity to work with your team” goes a long way.

# After the Interview

# 1. Send a Thank-You Email

**Within 24 hours, send a concise, polite thank-you note.** Mention something specific from the conversation to personalize it—so, if you need, you can take a couple bullet point notes during the interview to refresh your memory later when you need to write this. 

# 2. Reflect on Your Performance

This is often overlooked. Take 5 minutes to think about or jot down what went well and what could improve. This will help you refine your approach for future interviews. **You’ll probably do more of these than you can count, and just like exercise, you can work and focus on getting a little bit better each time.** 

# Common Pitfalls to Avoid

* **Failing to Prepare:** Winging it is not an option. Even just a little bit of prep can really save you when an interview asks something as simple as “why us?”
* **Overloading the Interviewer:** Don’t try to cram your entire life story into 30 minutes. It’ll come off as rambly and if you make everything seem important, nothing is important. Right now, your job is to highlight the best of what you’ve done, not narrate your biography.
* **Being Too Generic:** Tailor your answers to the firm and interviewer. I promise you, they have countless students who are doing the “spray and pray” method of trying to get offers, and showing you’ve been even a little thoughtful about your application (often networking is a really easy way to do this!), you’ll immediately pop up to the top of the pack when they consider all their candidates.

# Final Thoughts

Screener interviews can feel overwhelming, but preparation is the key to confidence. Research the firm, know your story, and practice presenting yourself as a professional with purpose. 

**And remember—your goal is to get the callback, not land the job on the spot.**

1gu7tom,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1gu7tom/im_27f_thinking_of_getting_back_in_touch_with_one/,"I'm [27F] thinking of getting back in touch with one or two people from high  school, but I don't know how to do it","So I've been struggling with making friends for years now. Recently the though popped into my head to re-connect with one or two people I know from high school. These are not people I was realaly friends with, but in both cases we sat together during a few classes and talked quite a bit then and it was fun. I still have the same instagram as 10 years ago, when I was 16, so I still follow these two girls and sometimes we comment on eachother stories. I feel like we have quite some things in common, and they are nice people. It's not like we ever had a fall-out or anything. It's just that we were never in the same friend group, and mostly just talked when we had classes together. So that's why we haven't stayed in touch, I think, despite going to the same university and thus moving to the same city (they still live in this city, as do I).

  
Now, I'm wondering. Does it seem like a sensible idea to get back in touch with them? And how to do this non-awkwardly? Maybe send a DM and ask to hang out for a coffee sometime? 

I haven't really talked to them in person since 8 years ago, just a insta comment here and there. That's why I'm also scared that meeting up would be awkward... But on the other hand, I feel like it could be a nice opportonity. Maybe we could be friends now, years later.

Does anyone have any advice or experience with this (from both sides of this story, maybe somebody re-connected with you)? What should I do? Is this a bad idea?

(For context: these two girls don't know eachother, so meeting up with the two of them together is not really an option I'm considering, I'm considering 1-on-1.)

There’s a number of small ways to do this from home that if we all participate in will be more obstructive than anticipated. Here are some ideas

Sign up [here](https://heritage.formstack.com/forms/ready_set_hill_summer_2023) without the intent of actually going. Set location to DC and attendance to in-person. Then use chatGPT (or not) to fill out the questions with a prompt that encourages a judeo-Christian perspective.

Call their info lines (202-546-4400) and ask for clarification on your least favorite section of project 2025. Then explain to them how absurd what they just said is and ask them if it’s what they really believe. This is more effort than I usually like to partake in but it’s effective social engineering at a larger scale.

Call their senior communications director Ellen Keenan at (202)-608-6123 (using some form of virtual number to protect your identity) and leave messages encouraging self reflection i.e.
“If the path you’re on demands you silence others, are you truly working towards freedom?” Etc etc 

Apply for jobs [here](https://www.heritage.org/careers#) with no intention of actually working there, this makes it harder for them to find willing capable workers and hey you might get the opportunity yourself and you can then ghost them for an interview.

This list is endless please add similar suggestions in the comments. There are clearly better and more effective forms of protest but these are some you can do over your morning cup of coffee.

Keep America free.

1gu7qxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gu7qxd/shellys_biscuits_are_like_witchcraft/,Shelly's biscuits are like witchcraft ,"It might've been a Monday when he started. Usually the newbies start on a Friday but he missed the intake 'cause his Pop had an accident with a rifle. His Nan needed looking after twenty four seven so he had to stay home. That's what Shelly said she'd overheard Pamela say to the other office lady, the new one with the limp, can't remember her name.

First thing was how tall. Shelly reckons the doorways are six foot seven so when this fella had to bend down to walk through, we were amazed. We all managed to pretend like it was normal, though. Didn't want him uncomfortable on his first day what with us small towners relating like he's some circus freak.

And Shelly being the usual wally swear I saw her twice glance at his crotch before looking over at Pam. Nah she definitely did. Monica the stand-in TL was introducing him and we're all in a semi-circle and her and Pam were so obvious about it. Pretty much what you'd expect in a rural call centre like ours, where it's been fifteen women and one Brian the past two years, who's the only bloke around since Darryl passed away. 

Probably a good thing Brian's in a wheelchair these days, is all I'll say. 

Ashton was his name. He didn't smile or say much, just followed Monica around with a kind of regal Lurch vibe before sitting at his pod, where he didn't move the rest of the day. 

Our pods back then were six to a large desk split by these flimsy partitions, and Ashton's PC was on the other side behind me, two pods down. So that's if I turned around it's Katie, and Ashton was over the other side at the wall, next to Shelly. Yep, Shelly was next to him from day one.

Good old Shelly. Oh and the other office lady's name was Tina, just remembered.

So it wasn't much out of the ordinary. Unassuming as he was physically imposing, basically. When Shelly brought her Anzac biscuits in special because it was his birthday, I'd say that's when he came out of his shell finally. Weird thing seeing him get animated, all of a sudden.

He didn't eat any though, just wrapped several in tissue paper for his Nan. We even exchanged a few words on break the next day, me and him. He was waiting for the water to boil and we laughed about how shit the instant coffee was. Fucking International Roast. I remember thinking, you know what, he's actually not that creepy when he laughs. 

After the ice was broken he asked about Shelly more than anything else. Figured he didn't realise how obvious he was making out that he fancied her back, and I didn't mind helping. Shelly's hubby ran off with a younger bird the year before, so good for her, I thought. Best I could do was play wingman for her with a younger bloke without making a big deal out of it.

Some of his questions, though. Wish I'd written them down. They weren't all normal, put it that way. This one in particular, wanted to know all about what colours Shelly wore the most. Like, how often she wore a green dress. How often she wore green shoes. How often she baked for the office and what was she wearing on the days she brought homemade goodies in, like she did with the Anzacs. He snuck them questions in so naturally that I didn't notice till later, how weird they were.

I can remember the colour one because it turns out he was colourblind. He did like Shelly, he told me, and because he had a sight problem---as in, could only see certain shades of brown and grey---he liked getting to know people most through the colours they wore. Especially people he liked. When something's difficult to focus on, you tend to learn on a deeper level, he explained. Guess he must've learned a lot more the harder way in life.

Way over my lazy head, plus sounded like some bullshit. But this about brings us up to speed. Shelly didn't show this morning and it's been over a week since anyone's heard from Ashton. He just stopped coming in. His Nan passed away not long after his second birthday here, about a month ago that was, and he wasn't the same after that. Started losing weight at a rapid rate, which really showed on his oversized frame. 

Last time I saw him he was gaunt, hunched over, even more than usual, and barely acknowledged me when I looked. He looked like death warmed up. Our regular TL Donna confided one day that she didn't know what to do with him. His performance had dropped so much that he was failing every KPI metric, even though he'd had the best first year of any of us, apparently.

And then there's Shelly. I figured the two of them finally met outside of work, because she was buzzing all of a sudden. She also, incidentally, started wearing a lot more green. Not sure I'd have noticed if it wasn't for Ashton and his questions the previous year, but there it was. Every day it was some new green item, like new skirts or socks or a scarf she had on. And she started packing on the kilos, too, which could only mean she was baking extra. Which all us girls knew she only ever did when she was shagging.

Still you'd never see that vibe from Ashton. He was taciturn at the best of times, and between the weight loss and grief he made a sore contrast to the woman apparently now his lover. You know for an office as small as ours it was a wonder no-one knew for sure. But Shelly wouldn't budge when asked. Just smile and change the subject. And there was no getting blood out of Lurch-boy Ashton. So the rest of us sleuthed what we could then gossiped and moved on. Never a doubt in my mind, though.

They were definitely fucking.

And I think to confirm that fact, as a kind of wink to me and Katie, two of us being the only others he ever spoke to besides Shelly, Ashton brought in his own batch of Anzacs last week. Bloody delicious, they were. Dare I say even better than Shelly's. But it was really the green shoes and t-shirt that made it obvious, what he was communicating. Maybe the driest sense of humour I've encountered. Certainly the weirdest.

Was an old recipe of his Nan's passed down the family, Ashton told me. That's why they looked so odd, his Anzacs did, and why they tasted so good. Good thing he brought a tub full 'cause otherwise Shelly might've eaten them all herself. It's like she couldn't stop from the moment he undid the lid. Katie and I lost count, but she must've eaten at least twenty of the things before they ran out. 

The next day, Ashton was just gone. Donna tried calling a few times, but there's bugger all reception where he lives. We just hope he's alright---not much more we can do. Shelly wasn't too interested in helping, either. Kept staying coy about their relationship and made out she didn't know anything more than we did. Even though her vibe said otherwise. Over the past week she must've packed another five kilos on, and her whole expression's been getting worse. Much worse in fact. Looked half crazed yesterday, like she hadn't slept in a month or something. Donna couldn't get in touch with her either this morning.

These office romances. Real makers or breakers, aren't they? Take Shelly's last office fling, Brian, for example. His allergies meant he could never eat her Anzacs, and so he'd just pretend to eat them while palming the crumbs into his pockets. When she found out she apparently grabbed an old rifle, loaded it, and shot him square in the kneecap. She reported the accident. And Brian was just too nice to press charges. That's the story anyway, and we only know what we do because of what Brian's ex wife told Pamela, who told Katie, who told Barbara, who somehow told me before Pamela knew.

There's Brian now, on his new wheelchair—the one handed down from Ashton's Pop, who passed away last year. Looks good on him, if that was a thing. Though nothing in the whole office looks half as good as the smile he's been wearing all morning.

Poor Ashton, though. Thinking I'll wear green tomorrow, in case that makes a difference.

Recently, I started an OnlyFans page, and honestly, it’s been kind of a wild but empowering journey so far. I mean, it’s not something I ever thought I’d do, but life’s too short to not try new things, right? 🙃 For me, it’s less about the $$$ (tho let’s not lie, it helps cover those overpriced textbooks 🤑) and more about stepping out of my comfort zone. I wanted to explore myself, feel confident, and maybe connect with people in a way that feels...authentic? It’s like self-love but make it ✨aesthetic✨, ya know?

1gu7nrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gu7nrd/just_started_sertraline_3_days_agoside_effects/,Just started sertraline 3 days ago...side effects going crazy ,"Hi folks. So I've been dealing with debilitating anxiety for the past year that was triggered by a nasty panic attack the morning of a neuro exam that I had stayed awake all night for. Long story short, I have ptsd from that day and been dealing with sleep anxiety/nocturnal panic attacks for about a year now. Very odd anxiety symptoms like dry mouth/mouth paralysis, arrhythmias, dizziness, ear ringing, palpitations, hypnic jerks, you name it. It seems as though every week I unlock a new symptom which compounds on my already pre-existing health anxiety. There are some night where I'm unable to sleep at all and some where I can manage to sleep at 4am after a dozen rounds of hypnic jerks and arrhythmias. 
I just had a psych appointment last week and was prescribed sertraline. I was informed of the potential side effects but I shrugged them off bc I already deal with said side effects pretty frequently so I thought it cant be any different. I was wrong. 
I took it at noon 3 days ago, starting with 25mg as advised and already 2h in I started to feel jittery as if I had drank coffee (I've been on a caffeine and energy drink ban since my incident last year). I truly tried not to psych myself out but I continued feeling that way all afternoon. I wasn't sure if it was just my regular anxiety flaring up (I'm preparing for my MCAT retake soon and falling a bit behind on prep) or the effects of the drug kicking in so soon, but I was unable to sleep that night and was experiencing chest pain, muscles tension, jitteriness, arrhythmias, hypnic jerks again etc. truly a hell of a night. I was going insane. During the day, I tried several ways to distract and exhaust myself to sleep but to no avail. I still took another dose of sertraline bc I recognize that this is a common experience and that these symptoms will most likely subside in a few days so I don't wanna give up just yet. But I was truly feeling horrible and started to experience nausea, dizziness, light headedness, flatulence and so forth. Basically going manic. I managed to finally rest at around 11 ish pm after yapping with my friends all day and going on walks to distract myself. Still woke up in the middle of the night. Now I have a massive headache and just feel overall tired. I truly contemplated not continuing the prescription yesterday bc of how awful I felt. I don't know what to do. Im sure my insomnia from the first night exacerbated my symptoms but I truly don't have it in me to experience it again. This was genuinely the most awful I've felt in my body and I experience debilitating period cramps every month and the occasional migraines. I should start CBT soon in conjunction with the SSRI but it's hard finding the appropriate therapist (I prefer one from the same cultural background to understand my pov). This is tampering with my schedule to prep for this exam and overall decreasing my quality of life. 
I'm omitting stuff but please share below if you've been experiencing these symptoms as well upon starting sertraline. I'm contemplating stopping already but I don't want to be a quitter esp since I'm just on the lowest dose. What should I do?",2,1731944649.0,Anxiety,3,1.0,False
1gu7nk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gu7nk6/27m_35mseeking_advice_can_this_relationship_be/,"27M- 35M-Seeking Advice: Can This Relationship Be Rebuilt, or Is It Truly Over? ","**Body:**  
I’ve been grappling with the aftermath of a breakup, and I’m looking for honest advice about where things stand—or if there’s any chance of reconciliation. Here’s the full context of my story, our relationship, and the mistakes I’ve made.

**Background on the Relationship:**  
Sam (29M) and I (Derrick, 34M) dated for about two years before breaking up in late September. Things started out amazing; I felt a connection with Sam that I hadn’t experienced before. He’s a kind, funny, and deeply thoughtful person, but he struggles with expressing his emotions and being vulnerable. Over time, his guardedness and lack of verbal affirmation made me question whether he truly cared for me.

Recently, Sam admitted that I’m the person he’s been most open and affectionate with, but even then, he came across as cold or distant because of his personal difficulties. He told me:

>

Sam also said that his difficulty with expression is something he struggles with in all areas of life, not just relationships:

>

**Sam’s Past and Emotional Baggage:**  
Sam also carried emotional weight from his previous relationships. One significant ex, Hong, left a lasting impact on him. During our relationship, I saw Sam make efforts to separate himself from that past, but I think some of his reluctance to fully open up emotionally may have stemmed from lingering fears or habits.

Despite all this, Sam reassured me that the emotional disconnect wasn’t my fault. He told me that he cared for me “significantly more than anyone else” he’d ever dated, which was reassuring but also bittersweet—because I didn’t always feel that love during the relationship.

**My Mistakes and My Struggles:**  
I have my own issues, too, which I now realize contributed to the breakdown of our relationship. I made the terrible mistake of cheating on Sam during the last few months of our relationship. It was never something I planned or intended, and I’ve spent every day since regretting it. I know I hurt Sam deeply, and I’ve owned up to it and apologized.

A lot of my actions stem from how my brain processes emotions. I tend to self-sabotage when things are going well, and I overthink to the point where I convince myself that people don’t truly care about me. At the time, I felt like Sam wasn’t as invested in me as I was in him—partially because of his difficulty expressing love—and I let those insecurities drive me to make horrible choices.

I also struggle with feeling like I don’t deserve happiness. My brain tends to create scenarios that exaggerate small issues or fabricate problems, as if it’s trying to protect me from future pain by preemptively sabotaging good things. In therapy, I’ve started to understand these patterns and work on changing them, but I know it’s a long road.

**Post-Breakup Communication:**  
After we broke up, I came clean to Sam about the cheating and apologized. He told me he forgives me but said he couldn’t take me back because things would never feel the same. Despite this, we’ve exchanged a few heartfelt messages recently.

Sam has said things like:

* *“I miss laying next to you and hanging out at your apartment.”*
* *“I should have acted in ways that never made you question how much I cared.”*
* *“I’m not ready for a relationship right now because I evidently need to work on myself before I can work on building things with other people.”*

I told him how much I still care about him and that I’ve realized how much he means to me, especially now that we’re apart. I’ve shared that I regret my actions and the ways I failed him, and I’ve tried to be transparent about my personal struggles, insecurities, and efforts to grow.

**Where Things Stand Now:**  
Sam has been clear that he doesn’t see a path forward for us as a couple. But he’s also still engaging in these deep, meaningful conversations with me. He acknowledges how much we cared for each other and has expressed guilt and sadness about how things ended.

I’ve invited him to meet me for coffee soon, hoping for an honest, in-person conversation. He hasn’t agreed, but I’m holding onto hope that seeing each other might open the door to something new—whether that’s reconciliation or closure.

**My Questions:**

1. Is there any hope that Sam might reconsider and give our relationship another chance?
2. Am I holding onto something unrealistic, or is it possible to rebuild trust and connection after such a painful experience?
3. For those who’ve experienced similar situations, how do you move forward—either by healing the relationship or finding closure?

**A Note:**  
I know I’ve made mistakes. I know cheating is wrong, and I’ve already faced a lot of guilt, regret, and judgment for my actions. Please don’t blast me about how terrible I am—I fully understand the gravity of what I did. What I’m looking for here is guidance on how to navigate this situation and grow from it.

My older brother stayed behind because he was already in college and was dating his now wife. I have always enjoyed a good relationship with my brother and his wife and was friendly with her parents and her sister. Anytime we visit, they will stop by for an afternoon coffee to chat and catch up. I used to text with my sister-in-law’s mom frequently about general life stuff. She passed away over the summer after a brief illness. My husband, myself, and our two kids (5&6)are planning a short visit to Holland over the holidays. We are likely going to a different destination for a few days and will then spend Christmas there until we leave. We aren’t staying with my brother because he can’t accommodate us in their house. I also have plans to see a few old friends while I’m there so I won’t be taking up days of anyone’s time. Our initial plan was to spend Christmas Day with my brother, his wife, my niece and nephew and I assumed, her sister with her family and  my sil’s newly widowed dad. My brother said oh this will be nice; we usually end the night with karaoke and we’ll have a good time. A few weeks went by, and I spoke to him yesterday and he suddenly tells me that it’s going to be too busy for my sil’s family to have us present. They are still mourning and feel that we are too much. My brother said, we can spend the day with just you guys, or you can come in the morning and then leave so her family can come. I had kind of a wtf moment and cut the convo short. I don’t know who to be pissed at, but I’m really pissed off and hurt. He just went out of his way to make our visit such an inconvenience to everyone, and I honestly don’t even want to go anymore. I lost my parents young and my mom never got to meet her grandkids. My sil’s mom got to know her family and live in the same development and help raise the grandkids well into their teen years. I understand it’s shitty to have the first holiday without your mom, but we are not strangers. We are family; and instead of making a longer table, they’re making us feel unwelcome. We are now trying to figure out alternative plans, but my brother asked if we could talk again this week, but with my sil present over video chat. They have a habit of being so regimented and inflexible with their lives that it just makes me feel like an absolute outsider and that there is no room for us. When they come here; I roll out the red carpet and will make it so they want for nothing. I just feel really crappy. I haven’t spent a single holiday with my brother in over 20 years.

For King, art is a space of renewal, where creation transcends language, offering a glimpse into his world beyond words.

1gu7hhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1gu7hhp/venting_and_seeking_advice/,Venting and seeking advice ,"It's been a very long three months. In that time, I've moved my mom from South Florida to Texas, gotten her into memory care, struggled through her admission to a psychiatric hospital, and gotten her into a second memory care home that she's thankfully thriving in. I got back to Texas Saturday evening after a two-day drive -- I was away almost three weeks, clearing out my mom's house. Sunday morning I discovered my wife has been f*cking someone else for at least five months. I'd sat down at the dining table with a cup of coffee when a text notification from some guy I didn't know popped up on her lock screen. I don't know why, but I had a sinking feeling, so I unlocked her phone and opened the message. What I found was a six-month-old thread of expressed desires, emojis, shared (both ways) pictures and videos of genitalia and masturbation, and numerous links to various hotels. That said, I'm probably filing for divorce, as I can't see myself trusting her ever again. 

My question is, how TF do I deal with this when I visit my mom? She LOVES my wife and asks about her regularly. I feel like having to keep up a charade will kill me in time. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow, and that will help, but I can't stop feeling like I'm drowning. ",1,1731944195.0,dementia,0,1.0,False

It was Friday morning. I started my day nursing a hangover from the night before, drinking my way through a pot of coffee and munching on toaster strudels (real healthy, I know). I had a morning filled with zoom meetings, and was feeling thankful for the option to keep the camera off because, let’s face it, I’m not as young as I used to be and good lord, does a night of drinking do some damage.

Anyway, as I was going into my last meeting before lunch, my phone rang. I silenced it quickly and set it face down so I wouldn’t be distracted. It’s no good to be off cam AND distracted. After the meeting, I forgot all about the call and got up from my desk to make myself some lunch – a salad with grilled chicken (cancels out the toaster strudel, right? Right?)

Just as I sat back at my desk, my phone rang again. When I picked it up, I saw I had five missed calls – two from my husband, Dylan, and three from a number I didn’t recognize. What the heck? I dropped my fork and mashed the answer button. It was the latter that was calling me back.

“Hello?”

“Hi, is this Mrs. Harding?”

“Who’s this?” I asked.

“This is Detective Phillips from the police department.”

My mind jumped to the missed calls from Dylan. Oh, God. Did something happen to him? A car accident? A shoot out? Fuck! My heart was beating out of my chest. Words lodged in my throat like a wad of wet bread. I sputtered, then asked, “Is my husband alright?”

“What?” the detective said, obviously confused.

“My husband,” I gasped. “Is that what you’re calling about?”

“Oh, no ma’am…”

“Thank God,” I breathed. “What can I do for you?”

“Ma’am…I’m calling because we found your son.”

Shock prickled through me. “Excuse me?”

“Your son, ma’am, we found him. He turned up at the police station last night and we were able to positively identify him this morning.”

My mind started spinning at the detective’s words. He must have the wrong Mrs. Harding. I don’t have a son. I don’t have any children at all. Dylan and I never wanted them. We have a nice life, just the two of us and our dog, Gus. Financially, we do well. We can pick up and travel whenever we want. Besides, I just never had that maternal instinct. And there’s nothing freaking wrong with that, despite what my mother thinks.

“Hello? Ma’am? Did you hear what I said?”

The detective’s voice jarred me from my thoughts. “Um…yeah, but…”

“We need you to come down to the station. Your husband is already on his way.”

Dylan was? Why?

“I think you must have the wrong number, Detective Phillips.”

“Shit,” he swore. “Is this Alyssa Harding, address 563 Pine Tree Court?”

“Yes, it is, but—”

“Phew,” the detective said. “Thought I’d really messed up there. You’re definitely the Mrs. Harding I’m looking for. Please, come down to the station at 555 Wilson Avenue ASAP.”

Before I could get another word out, the call disconnected. I pulled the phone back from my head and stared at it in disbelief. I was the Mrs. Harding he was looking for? It didn’t make any sense. What made less sense was that Dylan was headed to the station, too.

I logged off work, changed out of my “work clothes” (consisting of yoga pants and an old t-shirt), and pulled my hair up into a messy bun. Gus tap danced around me as I hurriedly got ready, then I dropped a treat on the floor so he wouldn’t get mad when I left him. Outside, there was a warm breeze, odd for an afternoon in mid-November. Something about it just felt wrong.

My hands trembled the whole way to the police station as I navigated my Prius through the leaf-strewn streets. I pulled up outside the low brick building and heard my name the second I stepped out onto the street. I turned. Dylan was rushing toward me, a grin plastered on his face. I almost didn’t recognize him.

“Alyssa! God, I tried to call you twice! Why didn’t you pick up?”

“I-I was in meetings all morning,” I said, thrown off by his intensity. “What is going on, Dylan?”

“Didn’t you talk to the detective?” he asked, grabbing my hand. He pulled me toward the glass entrance to the building with such force, I stumbled over the broken concrete a couple of times.

“Yes, but, I don’t understand,” I said, breathing heavy. Something was really wrong here.

“They found him, Lyss!” Dylan cried, prying open the door. “They found Logan!”

Logan. Logan. The word tumbled around in my head like a single item inside a dryer. Logan. They found him. What the fuck was going on?

I stopped short, yanking my hand from my husband’s, this man who looked like my husband anyway, but certainly wasn’t acting like him. “Dylan, stop!”

He stopped walking and blinked at me, confusion clouding his face. “Lyss, what’s going on? Didn’t you hear me? They found Logan! Why are you acting so strange?”

I bit down on my tongue, fighting the urge to unleash a series of swear words. I wasn’t the one acting strange here. Why couldn’t he see that? Who the fuck was Logan? Why were we even here?

I took a deep, measured breath. “Dylan, I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know who Logan is, and why the fuck we should care that they found him.”

My words were like a slap to the face. Dylan recoiled, a look of disgust coming over him. His eyes darkened and he leaned in close, murmuring to me, hot breath washing over my face. “Please don’t do this right now. Just come with me.”

I wanted to turn around and walk away. But I didn’t. I should’ve. If these past four days have taught me anything, it’s that following Dylan through that police station was the worst mistake I’ve ever made in my life. But something inside me told me to go with him. Curiosity, I guess. Wanting answers. The urgency in Dylan’s demeanor. I should’ve fucking run.

“Fine,” I said quietly.

We took the elevator up to the second floor and pushed through a set of double doors to a reception area. Dylan approached an officer behind a desk.

“Mr. and Mrs. Harding here to see Detective Phillips,” he said.

The officer’s face lit up. “Yes, of course, he’s waiting for you. You can head right back to his office.”

He pointed straight back through a maze of cubicles and Dylan motioned me forward. Dread snaked through me and my legs started to tremble as we walked. Officers in cubicles stopped to stare at us. One was even crying, wiping tears from her cheeks with a wad of tissues. What was with all the fucking dramatics?

The office door swung open before we even got there, and a man in his mid-forties with a slight pot belly and a full beard grinned out at us. “He’s right in here, folks, come, come. He’s been waiting anxiously for you.”

He sounded so excited, it was almost contagious. Until I remembered that there was nothing to be excited about. Whatever was going on was seriously fucked up. Dylan went first, stepping over the threshold and into the small office. I saw his body tense, then relax with a rush of breath.

“It really is you!” he cried, his voice breaking. “Lyss, it’s him! After all this time, our son has come home!”

I stepped timidly into the office. A boy—maybe six or seven—sat perched on a chair, his dark curly hair disheveled and standing up at odd angles on his head. He clutched a juicebox in one hand and a ratty teddy bear in the other. He was pale, but his cheeks were unnaturally rosy, and he looked up at us with the darkest, widest eyes I’ve ever seen. 

Seeing him was like a gut punch. Fear course through me like an electric shock. This kid, whoever he was, definitely wasn’t my son. In fact, I was pretty sure he was pure fucking evil. ",13,1731943660.0,nosleep,4,0.93,False

So, you know how I’m always on the lookout for new health products that *actually* work? Well, I recently stumbled upon something called **Nagano Tonic**, and I've been dying to share my experience with you.

**What Is Nagano Tonic?**

Nagano Tonic is a drink that claims to improve overall health by using natural ingredients sourced from Japan. It’s marketed as an all-natural tonic that can help boost energy, support metabolism, and improve mental clarity. The name “Nagano” is a nod to a region in Japan known for its long-lived population, which makes sense given the drink’s focus on wellness and longevity.

I’ll admit, the whole idea of a “super drink” was a bit intriguing, especially since it promises so many health benefits. So, I thought I’d give it a go and see if it’s actually worth the hype.

Check out  for more about Nagano Tonic:  [https://usquirk.com/nagano-tonic-review-my-honest-opinion](https://usquirk.com/nagano-tonic-review-my-honest-opinion)

**Nagano Tonic Benefits: Is It Really That Good?**

Okay, let’s dive into the good stuff—the benefits. Here’s what the brand claims Nagano Tonic can do for you:

1. **Boost Energy Levels**: One of the main selling points is its ability to increase your energy without the crash you get from coffee or energy drinks. I was a little skeptical at first, but after trying it for a week, I noticed that I felt more energized throughout the day, without the jitteriness I get from my usual morning cup of coffee.
2. **Enhance Mental Clarity**: Another benefit is increased focus and mental sharpness. You know how sometimes you get brain fog, especially in the afternoon? I’ve definitely noticed a difference. After drinking Nagano Tonic, I felt clearer-headed and less prone to those afternoon slumps.
3. **Improve Metabolism**: The tonic also promises to support metabolism, which is always a win in my book. I didn’t expect a miracle, but I do feel like my digestion and energy levels have been smoother, and I’ve had fewer cravings for junk food.
4. **Support Overall Wellness**: The tonic is also packed with antioxidants, which is a great bonus. Antioxidants are known for fighting off free radicals and supporting the immune system, so it’s like a little wellness shield in a bottle.

So, do these benefits hold up? Honestly, I’ve been feeling pretty good since I started drinking it, but I don’t think it’s a magic potion. It’s not like I suddenly turned into a superhero overnight, but I do feel like it’s helped me maintain better energy and focus levels, and that’s a huge win for me.

**Nagano Tonic Ingredients: What’s Inside?**

Now let’s talk about what actually goes into Nagano Tonic. The ingredients are what really set it apart from other wellness drinks. Here’s a rundown of what’s in the tonic:

1. **Japanese Green Tea Extract**: This is one of the main ingredients, and it’s known for its rich antioxidant properties. Green tea is great for boosting metabolism and providing a subtle energy lift. Plus, it’s loaded with catechins, which help with fat burning.
2. **Ginseng Root**: Ginseng has been used for centuries for its ability to improve mental clarity, reduce stress, and increase energy. It’s a powerhouse herb that’s known for enhancing focus and endurance. I’ve definitely felt more mentally sharp since starting the tonic.
3. **Turmeric Root**: This ingredient is packed with curcumin, a compound that has powerful anti-inflammatory effects. It’s great for overall wellness and supports the immune system. Turmeric is one of those ingredients that’s become super popular for its health benefits.
4. **Lemon Balm**: Known for its calming effects, lemon balm is included in Nagano Tonic to help reduce stress and promote relaxation. It’s a great ingredient to help you unwind after a hectic day.
5. **Ashwagandha**: This adaptogen is known for helping the body cope with stress and anxiety. It’s also believed to help balance hormones and support overall health. Honestly, this ingredient alone sold me on the idea because it’s super trendy for all the right reasons.
6. **Apple Cider Vinegar**: A classic ingredient that helps with digestion, supports metabolism, and can help stabilize blood sugar. ACV is one of those miracle ingredients that’s good for pretty much everything, and it’s great to see it included in the tonic.

**My Final Thoughts: Is Nagano Tonic Worth It?**

Honestly, I’m pretty impressed. Nagano Tonic has a solid list of ingredients, and it really does seem to boost energy and focus in a way that feels natural—not like the jittery rush from coffee. The flavor isn’t too bad either (it’s a little tart but refreshing), and it’s not loaded with sugars like a lot of other “health drinks.”

So, if you’re looking for a drink that supports energy, mental clarity, and overall wellness, Nagano Tonic is definitely worth trying out. I’ve been incorporating it into my daily routine, and it’s become one of my go-to wellness habits.

Would I recommend it? If you’re into natural health supplements and looking for a drink that offers more than just a caffeine boost, go for it. It’s not a magic fix, but I can definitely feel the benefits.

Let me know if you’ve tried it or if you’re planning to give it a go. I’m curious to hear what you think!",1,1731943442.0,NaganoTonicResult,0,1.0,False

**A starless night**

I'm Jun Seo Sperling, a middle school student who likes anime and sports. I led a typical routine until a pivotal moment altered my course. I lived in Yongin, a bustling city located between the vibrant metropolises of Seoul and Suwon. I lived in an apartment, as is customary for residents in my area. I woke up to my father’s voice calling from outside my room, a familiar sound that I could never sleep through. It wasn’t the first time, and it definitely wouldn’t be the last. The smell of toast filled the air, the aroma thick enough to coax me out of bed. I rubbed my eyes, the warmth of the bed pulling at me, but the hunger in my stomach won over. Dragging myself out from under the blanket, I stumbled toward the kitchen, my feet still heavy from sleep. The house wasn’t much—papers and old takeout containers scattered around, the faint scent of coffee lingering in the air. It wasn’t exactly clean, not by my friends' standards, but it was home. Home in a way their tidy, pristine apartments never felt. My dad had already laid out breakfast: a slice of toast dripping with Nutella. I grabbed it quickly, not bothering to sit down at the table. The usual breakfast. The usual morning routine. I took a bite, noticing the Nutella dripping down my hand. I didn’t mind. It was comforting, familiar. But there was something I couldn’t shake—a strange, empty feeling. Maybe it was the lack of milk. Yeah, milk would make it better. I poured myself a glass, savoring the coolness as I washed down the last of the toast.

The clock reminded me I only had ten minutes before I had to change and rush out the door. I was never one to shower in the mornings; it always felt like such a hassle. Kids at school teased me about it, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t trying to impress anyone. My uniform wasn’t a uniform at all, not like the ones in anime. No, we wore comfortable training sets. I liked it that way—comfortable, simple. No need for formality. I put on my blue trainers, grabbed my bag, and stepped outside, meeting up with my friends in front of the apartment building. The walk to school was always the same. A 30-minute trek uphill, just far enough to make my legs sore every day. But we had gotten used to it. No one complained.

School itself was nothing special. The same lessons, the same faces, the same games on my phone before class started. I felt like I was living on repeat, like time was just looping endlessly. I didn’t mind it. It was comfortable. Until it wasn't. After school, I went straight home. My dad cooked something for dinner, though it wasn’t anything fancy. I did my homework, but my mind was already on the test coming up in a month. I wasn’t worried about it. Not really. Studying felt like another thing I had to do, but it didn’t hold my attention. I was already thinking about the hagwon, my math classes later that night. It was on the way to the hagwon that I noticed the sky. The evening had fallen, and though the moon hung high above, something was missing. The stars weren’t there. Just an empty, dark sky. No twinkling lights. No glow.

I stared up at it, something in my chest tightening. I couldn’t explain why, but that void in the sky felt unsettling. I missed the stars. I missed the old days, the nights in Germany when the sky had been filled with light, full of life. Here in Korea, the sky felt cold and lifeless in comparison.

I felt a pang of loneliness, something deep inside that I couldn’t shake. The silence was oppressive. It was like the world had paused, holding its breath. I heard the faint hum of a car engine behind me, but I didn’t react. I didn’t move. There was no urgency in me. The world could continue without me. I wasn’t in a hurry. I stood there, my gaze fixed on the sky, the car's engine getting louder but not affecting me. I was calm. Too calm. A memory suddenly surfaced in my mind—one of standing under a starry sky with a girl I couldn’t quite remember. Her face was a blur, but her presence was undeniable. She was important to me. I knew that much. She felt like a part of me, hanging in the stars, glowing brighter than any of them.

And then, I heard the car behind me. A distant, rushing sound, growing louder, until—

The impact was sudden. Violent. But it didn’t hurt. There was no sharp pain, no agony. Instead, I felt a strange warmth, as though something soft was enveloping me. The loneliness I’d felt earlier disappeared completely.

Hey friends!

I’m finding myself becoming more and more overstimulated by audio. 

I find myself in situations where I can’t focus on tasks at work (I’m a knowledge worker), in loud coffee shops where I can hear everyone’s conversations at once, concerts, and caring for my incredibly loud 3 month old daughter. On Friday I had to do all of these in one day and was at my wits end by the time the night was over.

On the surface, the Switch 2 seem the most practical. Would it be better to get an all-in-one solution, or to get a Bundle? 

Does the Switch 2 do a good job emulating their individual counterparts?

Thanks in advance for the advice!",2,1731942850.0,LoopEarplugs,0,1.0,False

I go to bed at 7am and get up at 1pm, sometimes maybe even 2. I'm starting a class in a couple weeks that I will have to wake up at 6am for, so I need to start going to sleep at about 10pm. Huge difference from 7am.

Moved in with family due to money reasons and lead poisoning  and their turning really two faced.,"Long story short, we lived in a old home with my boyfriend’s parent’s, we had our own place but found mold and we had
To go back there because everything was just sky rocket high for rent, we have a one and two year old who got sick from it, we then found out there was lead at his parents house and we noticed they were getting sick, my boyfriend lives there half the time and the other half here but he’s mostly at work all the time, and then he comes here to let me go to work, this is because my family hates him, they tell me they don’t they try to turn it into he hates them or they make him uncomfortable and that he’s being ungrateful.

My grandpa was a drill sergeant for 30 years and quite frankly a gigantic jerk ego, my family’s always been pretty controlling with my decisions and honestly I don’t think I ever felt loved because I felt like a huge disappointment, I hated everything I did I couldn’t feel normal finally being a mom myself healed me but I never knew my grandma was secretly just talking about me with my mother the woman who put me through that very trauma from abusive men, to drugs/abandonment, not caring when I was graped or etc.

I never felt any kinda emotional relationship with my mom it feels like she doesn’t want one and I don’t think can even form one, I feel bad after putting the pieces together I had a fat realization that my mom never cared because her’s never did,my grandma sent my mom away to her dads who she had never met when she was 12 she just had a uhaul packed after she got out of school and my mom’s dad was pretty abusive he’s middle eastern kinda feel it may be how his parents treated him considering he’s the first generation to come to America and start a family here,my grandma did this because her husband was beating my mom when she wasn’t around.

My mom even kicked me out on my 18th birthday because she simply just hated me and I moved to my boyfriends, I had to move everything alone pregnant and sick as hell from a 3rd floor apt and I basically cried I think so much that year just from hormones and feeling alone because my family just kinda left me in the dust.

I think I caused problems for her and she didn’t wanna be a mom and it showed heavily, she could point out your flaws or tell you what you wanna do is a bad idea even though it ends up actually looking so good, she’s envious I feel, envious of what I can become, what kinda mom I am and the fact that I have a loving man and father to my children. 

They absolutely hate my boyfriend I walk on eggshells, it’s constantly asking questions more so being interrogated, I cook, I clean and I do everything they ask.

I’ve overheard some pretty upsetting things they said between my grandmas husband/ and my mom and my grandma and essientally im gonna sum it up and I just want opinions on what you would do would you keep a relationship with them? Or walk away, they are making some wild accusation’s. 

Let’s start with that me and my kids morning routine is coffee and a jog at the park, they say I’m a thief of the night and am on drugs or lying? I don’t understand that, they say I’m messy and basically call me stupid, they hate my boyfriends guts they keep talking about “just wait they are gonna break up it’s coming”
I’m sad they want that?
But they also think my boyfriend is controlling and abusive to me and my children, they think he lies about his job and they call him skinny and make fun of him for being anorexic, I can’t make this shit up, they seem so petty and ignorant, they also called me a horrible mother and I would be a better one slightly if I just left him, they called my kids essientally a mistake, my mom said “she could have had anyone , she could have done anything with her life and look at her now trapped with him and two kids” and my heart broke and my grandma was laughing enjoying her saying that because she came back with something worse I chose to just ignore bc I wanted to cry already, I wish I wouldn’t hear this stuff but I need to, I need to know, my mom on top of that said she threw me out because she wasn’t putting up with me and my family but I wasn’t even pregnant until a month after I moved and I had to move my stuff out late because I was fighting with her to let at least my boyfriend help me.


They basically are also saying they are waiting to find a reason to snap, on top of everything my grandmas husband works night shift and he makes sure to slam doors and hit our door or wall intentionally every night and my kids wake up screaming and they are sleep deprived we wake up 3-5 times a night sometimes he doesn’t even go to bed and is just loud all night and it’s to make us want out of here they said we don’t deserve sleep because we are lazy and in there house, even though we both work! My man full time me part time!


My grandma also treats my brother the same way she did me and I’m starting to think maybe she didn’t care about me she just cared about shutting me up and making my mom happy, she loves hearing about all the random men my mom wasted her time on? On top of that I got off at 10 pm and they tricked me twice into watching my brother who’s 9 which ok but how do you know I didn’t have plans the next day?

They say I use them for a sitter that’s hilarious they can’t even handle my kid’s, I was my moms personal overnight babysitter basically my whole childhood, I think my moms super envious of the family I created and I used to think I was being everything she called me but that was just me still letting myself feel sorry for her, but I never knew my grandma was like this too and I’m kinda disappointed but her husbands always been mean, very nit picky, used to scream at me over not putting a napkin on my lap the right way or crossing the catchloic prayer sign after praying, me doing everything in the church to make him accept me and my grandma even telling me just do it he will be proud etc or it would make him happy like why was I worried about that as a kid, I found out I was on the spectrum as a adult too so him screaming at me over struggling with math, hurtful.


They also said that they think my sons too hyper and that I caused him to be autistic because my boyfriend gave me marijuana while pregnant? I don’t know what to even feel about them.

It takes him a really long time to ""wake up"" after he's woken up. He needs coffee and scrolling on his phone and all that before he's his normal happy self. He's easily agitated before it kicks in and it almost feels like no matter what I do, he has some type of issue with something I've said or something I've done. 

I've started to just not wake him up in the mornings, even if he asks me to, because I don't wanna deal with his grumpy. But even that is a cause for him to be agitated. 

This morning, he woke up and seemed to be in a good mood. All kissy and wanting to tell me about his dream. I listened, gave him kisses, and even made him coffee. But I have things to do this morning, so I started making moves. He asked me if I wanted to do them alone and I said ""no, but I have to start now and you're not ready"" that made him roll his eyes and once again seem agitated. So I kissed him on his forehead and left. 

Just feels like no matter the course of the morning, he's going to be bothered. What can I do? How can I avoid making him feel this way? How can I avoid feeling annoyed/bothered by his reactions?

Im doing what I had set out to do this morning and I just keep replaying the interaction this morning and it seems unavoidable. So now I feel shitty enough to seek advice from strangers lol

Or maybe you're just tired of Googling, ""Who’s the best **Burbank dentist**?"" and getting overwhelmed by reviews that all sound the same.

Relax, you’re not alone. Picking the right dentist feels like choosing the right Netflix show—so many options, and you just want something that works.

Let’s break it down together—simple, no fluff, and definitely no guilt trips about that skipped flossing session.

# 1. What Does a Burbank Dentist Actually Do?

A **Burbank dentist** isn’t just there to clean your teeth and send you home with a new toothbrush.

They’re like the pit crew for your mouth—keeping everything running smoothly so you can chew, smile, and laugh without a second thought.

Here’s the playbook:

* **Preventative care**: Cleanings, check-ups, and stopping problems before they start.
* **Fixing the issues**: Got a cavity? Need a crown? They’ve got you.
* **Cosmetic upgrades**: Want that Hollywood smile? Think whitening, veneers, and Invisalign.

Picture this: Your cousin Tim ignored his toothache for months. He walked into MyBurbankDentist and walked out with not just a fixed tooth but a smile that made him the star of every family photo.

# 2. Why Finding the Right Burbank Dentist Feels Like a Big Deal

Let’s get real. You wouldn’t trust just anyone to cut your hair, so why hand over your smile without thinking twice?

A good **Burbank dentist** doesn’t just handle your teeth—they make you feel comfortable, explain what’s happening, and keep you coming back without dreading it.

**Why it matters:**

* They’re close by—because who wants to drive across L.A. traffic with a toothache?
* They get it—Burbank folks need flexible schedules and family-friendly care.
* Emergencies happen—your kid chips a tooth on a weekend, and boom, you need someone reliable.

# 3. First Visit to a Burbank Dentist? Here’s What You Can Expect

Let’s pretend you’re walking into MyBurbankDentist for the first time.

No, it’s not like walking into a scene from Grey’s Anatomy.

You’ll be greeted by a smiling receptionist who doesn’t judge your 18-month gap since your last cleaning.

Here’s the rundown:

* **Step 1**: A quick chat about your dental history—no, they don’t need your entire life story.
* **Step 2**: X-rays or photos so they can see what’s going on.
* **Step 3**: A full exam, and the dentist walks you through what they find.

And the best part? No scary surprises. It’s all explained in simple terms—like chatting with a friend who just happens to have a dental degree.

# 4. How to Pick the Best Burbank Dentist Without Losing Your Mind

It’s like picking a taco spot—there are good ones, bad ones, and a few that stand out.

When choosing a dentist, here’s your cheat sheet:

* **Read real reviews**: Skip the ones that sound too perfect; look for the ones that mention specifics.
* **Check their vibe**: Book a quick consultation. Do they feel like someone you’d trust?
* **Ask about services**: Need Invisalign? Or teeth whitening? Make sure they’ve got it all in one place.

MyBurbankDentist? They’re the taco stand that never disappoints.

# 5. Why Regular Check-Ups with a Burbank Dentist Are Actually Worth It

We get it. Life’s busy. Who has time to see the dentist when there are work deadlines and kids’ soccer games?

But here’s the thing:

* A 6-month check-up saves you from 6 weeks of dealing with a root canal.
* It’s cheaper to prevent problems than fix them later.
* And hey, nothing beats the confidence of a healthy, clean smile.

Think of it like your car. You wouldn’t skip an oil change and expect it to run forever, right? Same goes for your teeth.

**Closing Thought**

Finding a **Burbank dentist** doesn’t have to be complicated.

MyBurbankDentist is your go-to for everything from cleanings to cosmetic upgrades—all without the guilt trips or confusing jargon.

Your smile’s future? It’s in good hands.

I’m sorta stuck on a plateau that I can’t understand. I’m a 63 year old female was 202 lbs. now 172, a thirty pound loss in 6 months. I’m eating approximately 1,200 calories a day. I count my calories and watch my macros. I’m can’t seem to lose although I work out five days a week with resistance training and half an hour of cardio and walk once a week for one and a half hours with my dog. 
I am wondering now does this mean I must eat less?
I always thought if I couldn’t keep my eating habits for life or sustain a low calorie deficit for life it would backfire. I should not CRASH diet since I can’t keep this up for maintenance and would gain it back. Another thought is to simply cut back on my fat intake, creamer for my coffee(non dairy oat milk creamer), butter and mixed nuts with more fiber like broccoli, spinach, etc. or should I eat less whole grain carbs? I eat steel cut oats, whole wheat breads, brown rice, Japanese sweet potato 🍠 which is my favorite. I can reduce my calorie intake but am reluctant since I don’t know if I can keep it up? Is it my age? Should I reduce my caloric intake? I’ve been stuck at a thirty pound loss up and down a pound for a month now.

Personal information including users’ photos, sexual orientation, and even political beliefs could be exposed. 



See for yourself👇

1. Cybercriminals scraped roughly 70k photos belonging to 16k Tinder users and sold them on a criminal forum back in late 2019. If you used Tinder around that time or before, your selfies may still circulate the dark web…

2. Bumble once left a database exposed for seven months! This left cybercriminals wide open to users' physical traits, locations, and other information. No data was taken (as far as we know), but that’s a scary seven-month window!

3. Turns out PlentyOfFish had a bug that made “hidden” info like zip codes, meant only for the users’ eyes, visible to others. The bug was discovered in 2019, but there’s no telling if bad actors found it first.

4. In 2019, CoffeeMeetsBagel suffered a mysterious data breach where some user data was accessed. The platform claims no sensitive data was exposed, but details remain murky.

5. Facebook’s notorious data issues may have also spilled over to dating. Data from users active on the platform between 2018 and 2019 was leaked in 2021. It’s not certain but that breach may have included data belonging to FacebookDating users.

First time posting, so I hope I am doing this correctly. I have a one bedroom apartment in Evanston that I am moving out of on December 1st. Rent is $1450 and there is tons of street parking and also options to rent a spot behind the building.

It is near the Union Pacific North Metra line (5 minute walk), about a 15 minute walk to the CTA Purple Line, and about 10 minute drive from I-94 (Old Orchard exit). It is along the Central Business District so there's coffee shops, cute boutiques and great dining options around! There are also CTA & Pace bus stops.

The building is vintage, and the unit is well-maintained. It has tons of storage, hardwood floors and an exposed brick wall that runs along the living room. There's also tons of windows in the main living area (3 south and 3 west facing) which is great for plants haha. All of my neighbors are nice and keep to themselves, which is really all you can ask for!

You will need to pay for electric and wifi but other essentials like water/gas/recycling are covered. There is laundry in the basement of the building ($1.50 for washer, $1 for dryer) and you also will have a storage unit down there! The heat is provided by baseboard radiators and I have an AC unit that I can leave behind if someone wants it! There isn't a dishwasher in my unit.

I had a co-signer while I lived here so the landlord is comfortable if you would like to use one.

If you're interested please send me a message and I can share photos and answer any additional questions

  
Update: Forgot to include that cats and small pets are okay! I think you can ask the landlord about smaller dogs, we also have a large grassy area directly next to the building :)",3,1731941245.0,chicagoapartments,1,1.0,False

Hi! I’m in Columbus Ohio and I’m looking for cool women to be friends with! I’ve realized I’m ace for a few years now.

About me: I’m 32, live in Columbus, Ohio, and I’m into all things horror and spooky. I like watching things about Bigfoot and aliens and ghost and unexplained mysteries. I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I’m 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

I’m looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with.

This upgrade promises to enhance how we interact with our devices, making the experience more intuitive and efficient. Imagine being able to control your lights, thermostat, and even your coffee maker with just a more natural and conversational command. That’s the kind of ease we’ve all been waiting for!

What excites me the most is the potential for deeper integration and smarter responses. With Gemini, the Assistant seems to be evolving beyond just responding to commands; it aims to understand context and provide proactive suggestions. For example, if you frequently dim the lights during movie nights, the Assistant might suggest doing so without you even asking. This level of personalization could truly transform our daily routines.

However, while the hype is palpable, I can't help but wonder if this upgrade is genuinely groundbreaking or just another marketing ploy. Tech companies often promise the moon, only to deliver a minor tweak. It will be interesting to see how well Gemini performs in real-world scenarios and if it can live up to its ambitious goals. 

Overall, I’m cautiously optimistic. If Google can deliver on its promises, this could be a significant step forward for smart home technology. But, as with any new feature, I’ll be keeping my expectations in check until I can experience it firsthand. What do you all think? Is this upgrade worth the excitement, or are we just getting caught up in the hype?",1,1731941164.0,hacksguider,0,1.0,False
1gu6bx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gu6bx9/trouble_diagnosing_low_pressure_breville_barista/,Trouble diagnosing low pressure [Breville Barista],"My problem: I can't get good pressure

How I'm testing: 

* I'm not getting the pin into the grey area of the gauge on the front of the machine while pulling a shot
* I have also tried running a shot with the double-wall blind basket in, and it barely gets into the grey, and sometimes doesn't even get that high.
* After everything I've tried I start with the middle setting on the inside grind setting, and 5 on the dial, and work my way down to the finest grind, and never get good pressure
* As far as flavour, I'm getting really inconsistent results. I occasionally get good coffee, but it's all over the place
* I typically use 20 grams of beans, measured with what I believe to be a good scale
* I use a spring-loaded tamper, in an attempt to eliminate the variable of ""how hard did I tamp that time?""

I've tried:

* de-scaling (using the built-in cleaning cycle, with de-scaling powder)
* pressure-cleaning the group head (the other built-in cleaning cycle, with the blind basket and tablets)
* replacing the group head gasket
* thoroughly cleaning the inside of the group head
* replacing the pump

My next thoughts are:

* bad gauge? If I got consistent behaviour, it would be easier to doubt the gauge.
* When replacing the pump, I learned of the overpressure valve. Could that be failing and letting out pressure too soon?

What I'd like to hear from this community:

* diagnosis ideas
* recommendations for repair shops in Toronto
* questions/suggestions",1,1731941148.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Last month, I posted here: [Cebu Itinerary (November 8-12) : r/phtravel](https://www.reddit.com/r/phtravel/comments/1g5n8lq/comment/lu6snsb/?context=3) seeking for an advice regarding our 5D4N DIY Trip with friends. Just want to let you know that it was a success and was indeed possible! Here's a complete itinerary incase anyone's interested:

For our first day, we arrived at Mactan Airport exactly 3:30.   
Grab to Terminal for Moalboal - PHP600/6= 100  
South Bus Terminal - AC Bus Bato Via Barili = 210  
Tricycle from Moalboal Jollibee to Panagsama Beach 300/6 = 50  
Moho Hostel for 2 nights = 960  
We arrived at 8:30 AM and had lunch at the hostel = 175  
We took a rest for the rest of the afternoon due to exhaustion from work and got up at sunset. Enjoyed a good dinner and had the best discussion. Dinner=300  
Day 1 expense = PHP1,795

  
For our second day, we got up at 3:30AM to catch the sunrise to Osemana Peak. We rented a scooter and used google maps. Traveled 36km for 45mins. Gave the tour guide 50 each for a 15min treak. After Osmena Peak, we went to Dao Falls, another 50km motor ride and basically enjoyed the ride. We rode the scooter rented for 400. Dao Falls has about 800 meters trek and paid 200 each as an entrance, inclusive of safety gear and water shoes. After Dao Falls, we could've checked out other falls nearby but opted to stay there because the view was so good. We also thought of going to a white beach called Lambug but we just wanted to rush home to prepare for the Kawasan Falls   
Osmena Peak = 50  
Coffee Shop in Osmena = 90 Coffee, 160 breakfast (Which is sooo good)  
Dao Falls Entrance = 200  
Guide (Tip) = 100 each  
Lunch = 200  
Dinner = Smooth Cafe in Moalboal 400  
Motor rental 400/2=200  
Gas = 100/2 =50  
Second day total = PHP1450



For our 3rd Day, at 6AM we dive in the sardine and turtle run and availed a local offer of 500 each including guide assistance, photo underwater although honestly i would just snorkle and bring my own gears next time. Then at 9am, we availed a group tour of 1,900 for Kawasan Canyoneering and opted to zip line which is 600. Kawasan Canyoneering was so good! No amount of words can describe how much I am in awe of this place. The guides were also so skillful. The ratio for tour guides is 1:1 which guarantees your safety. This also includes a dinner meal so we only paid for our breakfast which is 400 because we ate croissant and drank coffee at Le Bistro Moalboal. At 8pm, after the canyoneering we decided to go back to Cebu City and rest before another 5 hour ride to Bantayan the next day. We found a van near Jollibee that was looking for passengers, we were given a price of 250 each (There's 8 of us), and had the transpo to ourselves. We booked Ultima Residence Airbnb and paid for 650 each, which brings total for 3rd day:  
Kawasan Tour and Zip Line (includes transpo to Badian)= 2500  
Brunch = 400  
Van to Cebu City = 250  
Airbnb = 650  
Sardine Turtle Run = 500  
Total = 4300

  
For our 4th day, we left our Airbnb at 6am and traveled to Hagnaya Port. We paid for 200 and opted using the van transpo which was disappointing because the AC was such a pain in the butt. So hot! I would totally do it over and opt to ride the AC Bus if ever since it's just the same price. After Hagnaya Port, we boarded the Barge and paid 300. At the port, the hotel van picked us up and drop as off at the hotel for free.

Bantayan is our last stop, since we are tired and in need of a steady place to rest, we booked Kota Beach resort, a 4-star hotel and paid for 1,500 each. We got 2 deluxe rooms which 4 person stayed per room at 12,000/8= 1,500 each. We also had a grand lunch which gave us 500 each on the bill. At 3pm, we rented a motor at 350/2= 175 and went to Paradise Beach for the sunset. For Dinner, I bought a Alimasag Crab at a local market for 300 and had it cooked in chilli butter flavor while the rest of the group ordered at the hotel. 

For our 4th day I paid for:  
Grab to North Terminal 222/4= 56  
Airbnb to Hagnaya = 200  
Hagnaya Port to Sta. Fe (Bantayan) = 300  
Kota Beach = 1500  
Motor (24 hrs rent) = 175  
Gas = 50  
Lunch= 500  
Paradise Entrance = 25  
Dinner = 300  
Total = 3,106

For our 5th day, we just went to Ogtong Cave and Resort and did not push through with the rest of the tour because we just want a chill day before check out. We also rode the motor everywhere in Bantayan. After checking out and boarding the Barge, we rented a van that would take us straight from the airport at 5,000 and paid for 625. Since we were running late, we only bought lechon for take-out. 

5th day expense:  
Ogtong Cave Entrance - 150  
Sta Fe Barge - 300  
Van - 625  
Lunch at the Port - 200  
Lechon 400  
Total = 1675

Total expense for this trip was 12,326. That's all! Thank you for the help and expertise.

I'm a SAHM. My husband works 8:30-5 Mon-Fri, he's always had a job, he's definitely not lazy and barely ever misses work unless he's literally so sick he can't move (he doesn't get man-colds, haha).

It just drives me nuts that he consistently rolls out of bed at 7:50 when he's got to be at work at 8:30 (we live 30 minutes away). I think it's my anxiety because I could never get up that late without panicking. He's got to rush around to get ready, often taking a shower in the morning as well. So he's pretty much always 5-10 minutes late (it doesn't matter at his job, he does his job when he's there and he stays 15-20 minutes late every day working as well).

I often get up around 7 to drink my coffee and watch the birds before our kid wakes up. It would just be really nice if my husband could get up early too. We could make breakfast in the mornings and have a little bit of time together before we have to start the day.

He does do overnights with the kid, but she's been sleeping through the night for a while now and it's not like he stays up playing video games until 3 am so he could realistically get up earlier. He needs more sleep than I do though, I guess.

I don't want to say any of this to him and have him think I'm trying to criticize him or something, I know he doesn't sleep well but I would enjoy us time some mornings.",0,1731940809.0,SAHP,13,0.5,False

1. Journal.

Every month naglalagay ako ng list like:
(a) What do I want to accomplish this month? And (b) Affirmations of the month

For me, it doesn't have to be specific or detailed. Sometimes I just put something like ""Focus on myself,"" ""I want to treat myself kinder."" Ganun. Affirmations like ""I accept love."" ""I forgive mistakes."" ""I am brave and confident in class."" And then mood board. Literal na collage para inspirational AF HAHA. It represents kung pano ko gusto mag turn out yung month for me. Then journal mismo. I usually write when I'm super happy to the point na feel ko I need to turn the feeling of gratitude into words para di ko malimutan how it made me feel or when I'm super sad (gaya nung nakatanggap ako ng bagsak na midterm last week🥲).

2. Cold showers

Actually recommended by psychologists. Napanood ko rin somewhere na habang dumadaloy yung tubig mula sa ulo mo hanggang paa, isipin mo sinasama non lahat ng negativity sa katawan mo down the drain. Samahan ng konting focus sa breathing and shala! 

3. Maglakad kaysa mag Ikot

I do this not only because kuripot ako but also because mas may time ako makinig sa thoughts ko. Pag masyadong magulo yung isip ko to the point na parang nag ooverlap yung boses in my mind, I look around and think to myself how it's such a privilege to be surrounded by greenery. Stuff like that. Alam ko parang way yun to de-stress when having an anxiety? Parang yung 5 things I see, 4 things I hear, 3 things I smell, etc. Plus tbh mas mahangin pag naglalakad kaysa pag siksikan sa jeep.

4. Coffee shops

Try niyo mag visit ng coffee shops mag-isa. Kapag mag-isa ako mas nakakaya ko maging present. Mas lasa 'yung ingredients ng kape—kung may cinnamon ba, caramel pump ba or vanilla, may nutty flavor ba. Mas matatake-in mo 'yung ambience ng cafe. Ano yung theme ng interior? Modern? Earthy? Mataas ba 'yung ceilings? Malaki ba 'yung windows? Plus nakakafocus ako lalo sa pag-aaral kasi nga walang dumadaldal sakin HAHAHA.

5. At-home yoga

Paggising sa umaga or bago matulog. Inat-inat lang. Di kailangan ng equipment. Lapag ka lang ng yoga mat. Kung wala, edi lapag ka tuwalya kung gusto mo. Ewan, ang sarap sa feeling tsaka pwede mo gawin kahit 5 minutes lang. Itong [YT video](https://youtu.be/NyP_waVgL1w?si=eRnwWTtJWcMZxeZy) yung pinakanagustuhan ko so far kasi di ka hihingalin pero you'll feel good pag natapos mo kasi medyo challenging siya (at least for me, as a girl na di kaya mag push ups). 


6. Socialize with friends that you really value.

Di yung sasama ka lang para may kasama ka. Doon ka sa may substance. This is probably why wala ako masyadong friends sa UPD. I have acquaintances but I don't have a lot of friends that I actually have deep connections with. Bilang lang sa kamay but they are the best people I know. Not the type na mapepressure ka to do anything or kakailanganin mo ikumpara sarili mo sa kanila. They're the type of friends na tanggap ka bilang ikaw :)

8. Attending church every Sunday

I know that this is not for everyone but it seriously helped me. After years of not attending, nag start ulit ako magsimba nitong time na feel ko gusto ko na mamatay. I don't agree lagi sa mga teachings nila (for instance, anti-divorce yung priest samin). But I find solace in the fact na may nagreremind sakin na ginagabayan ako ni Lord at may plano Siya for me.

9. Last but not the least, maglaba at maglinis ng kwarto. 

Ewan. Rewarding. Masarap magpahinga pag amoy downy yung bed sheets. HAHAHA. Ika-nga, the state of your room is the state of your mind. 

Basta pinapaalala ko lang din sa sarili ko na tao lang naman ako. Nagkakamali. Minsan bumabagsak. Minsan natatanga. But aside from that, I should remember na deserve ko pa rin maging masaya. Deserve ko mag try again. Deserve ko maging mabait sa sarili ko. Deserve ko patawarin sarili ko kung may kabobohan man akong nagawa. Minsan mahirap alalahanin 'to but I try my best :)

It’s all about blending simplicity with functionality, creating a look that’s fresh, timeless, and easy to adapt to any space. If you’re new to this style or want to bring a bit of that classic vibe to your home, here’s a quick guide to the key elements that define mid-century modern decor—and some tips on making it your own.

https://preview.redd.it/r4c3ic5w8o1e1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=79a1c1f64d492682b0b85bea3d884ef55853745a

1. **Clean Lines for a Simple Look**

One of the first things you’ll notice in mid-century modern furniture is the emphasis on clean, straight lines. Pieces often have minimal details, avoiding anything too ornate or fussy. This keeps the look simple and sleek, giving your room a tidy, uncluttered feel.

A leather modern couch with slim, straight legs is a perfect example of this. **Mid in Mod** offers some great options that nail this look, making it easy to incorporate into your space without breaking your budget.

1. **Organic Shapes for Softness and Comfort**

While mid-century pieces are simple, they don’t lack warmth or character. Soft, organic shapes are a big part of this style, especially in chairs and tables. Look for rounded edges, smooth curves, and even slightly angled lines to add flow to your room.

A coffee table with a rounded edge or a chair with a gently curved back can make the space feel cozy without taking away from the clean, modern look.

1. **Warm Woods for a Cozy Feel**

Wood is central to mid-century modern design, especially warm-toned woods like walnut, teak, and oak. These tones add a natural, inviting feel to your space, making it feel balanced and welcoming. Look for wood finishes on dining tables, shelves, or side tables to bring this warmth into your room.

For those interested,  places like  **MidMod Houston** is a great place to find affordable mid-century modern furniture, including pieces in these warm wood finishes.

1. **Pops of Color for Personality**

While mid-century spaces often start with neutral bases, a few pops of color make them feel more lively. Think mustard yellow, teal, or orange. You can add these with throw pillows, a small accent chair, or even a piece of art on the wall.

These colors bring a playful, retro vibe to your room while keeping the overall look fresh and stylish.

1. **Leather Accents for Timeless Charm**

Leather is another staple of mid-century design, especially in rich browns that add depth and elegance. If you’re looking for a piece to anchor your room, a leather modern couch or even a small leather chair can do the trick. Look for options like a **for sale leather sofa** at Mid in Mod to find something affordable that fits right into this classic style.

# Bringing It All Together

If you want to make a good start to your mid-century modern space, you can choose organic shapes, warm woods, and a few colorful accents with clean lines. You must keep it simple. And choose pieces you love, and don’t be afraid to mix in personal touches for a look that’s truly yours.",1,1731940719.0,midinmod,0,1.0,False

I was a bit iffy about his social readiness for primary school, which wasn’t something we’d worried about at all with his older sister but I thought maybe it was just a personality or girl v. boy thing. 

His pre-school said he was ready for Junior Infants and that he’d be bored if I waited another year. The new primary school met us to discuss and said he’d be well able for it and told us that we couldn’t wait another year anyway, because they have to have started in school before they turn 6.

Well, it’s a shitshow. Worse than I could ever have imagined. My worry was that he would just hang back a bit from getting stuck in with playing with the other boys, or maybe be upset if there was rough play or anyone being mean. 

Instead, we are about to have our second meeting with his teacher (the principal will be in on this one) to discuss his disruptive behaviour. Hiding under tables, not sitting in his chair, going into the sensory tent (for the ~5 boys in his class with additional needs), playing coffee shop to make an americano for his teacher when she’s trying to do maths, sitting at a table on his own down the back of the class etc etc etc. 

After our first meeting they had introduced a star chart for a while, movement breaks, an SNA for a while. We thought things were going well since we’d heard nothing 🫠 But last week we were told he’d had a bad week, culminating in running out of the classroom and out the door of the school.

We are doing our best to try and improve behaviour/identify triggers and he is on a list to be assessed for AuDHD etc, but I think the bottom line is that he might have started school too young. 

And so, short of time travelling, what can I do to sort this mess out? Has anyone else been in a similar situation?",2,1731940709.0,ireland,32,0.53,False

What to do?,"I think my (29M) girlfriend (23F) is beyond controlling, jealous and unreasonable, and frankly is becoming insufferable. She’s pushing me away with her behaviour, and although I try, I’m not sure I want to continue in the relationship. 

Nonetheless, she thinks she acts normally, and blames everything on me. Examples below: 

- She wants to know every detail about my every day. She works most days, 1pm-8pm, whilst I work 6am-noon. She will get annoyed if I don’t tell her I grabbed a quick coffee, for example. Yesterday, she kicked up a fuss because I forgot to add that I had a quick 5-minute sauna session, after the gym. She claims that I am ‘lying’ to her and ‘omitting’ things. I told her, I go to the gym literally every day, and the sauna most days. Why would I lie about that? It’s so irrelevant I just forgot, honestly ‘gym’ to me usually means gym and sauna 

- She is constantly complaining. The other day she asked me to buy things for dinner, all of which I managed to buy, except a pepper. I went to 2/3 places super close by, and there weren’t any. Granted, I could’ve tried another couple spots, but didn’t think it was a big deal. She lost her shit over that pepper, as soon as she got in the door

- With regards to the complaining, it’s almost as if she has verbal diarrhoea and can’t help herself. If we haven’t held hands for five minutes, she’ll bring it up. We will get over one argument topic, and she’ll start on another. Last week we had argued, but gotten past it, and agreed we’d go out and try enjoy our day. We hadn’t even made it to the elevator before she started again, it’s literally insufferable and as if she cannot help herself

- She’s super jealous. We live in an apartment block, and I’m around a lot at the gym/pool or just chatting to security with whom we are both friends. The other day I was in the elevator with a neighbour, from another floor, whom I know to say hello to. We had a 15-second conversation in the elevator ‘how are you, busy day?’ and we both laughed at something inane that she said about work. I get out the elevator, laughing, and my girlfriend is there. I was headed out to buy milk, and in that time receive dozens of messages such as ‘who’s she?’, ‘why are you laughing with her?’, ‘do you two have something going on? She genuinely thinks it’s disrespectful to say more than hello to another female, that she doesn’t know, and that I should be doing everything to cut the conversation short

- She wants to be together 24/7, in the time that we have together. I chat to my friends every day, and she doesn’t. Instead, she looks to me for pretty much everything. Again just last week, I got to the apartment lobby and she was waiting for me to go shopping. I’d had a shitty day and was in a bad mood, I just wanted to eat. She asked what was up, and I calmly explained that. But she kicked off and started WWII because she didn’t like that I was in a mood, that I hadn’t called her ‘babe’ when I told her about it, and that I hadn’t properly greeted her when I arrived to the lobby. In my defence, she was speaking with the security and I just got in and said ‘let’s go?’ 

- Finally, she thinks it’s completely ok and normal to look through my phone and asks to do so various times monthly. I told her how uncomfortable I am with it, but made the error of allowing her to do so and now she asks constantly to do so ever since. She has never found anything, as there’s nothing to find. If I say no to this request, she will just assume I am cheating on her

This is far, far from everything. She thinks all of the above is ok, and only sees fault in my opinion and/or negative reaction. Admittedly, I find myself becoming less affectionate and frankly fed up in the relationship. But, I honestly think I’ve put up with more than anyone should. 

We have come close to breaking up, but she ends up having a breakdown and not wanting to follow through with it and leave our (my) apartment. I then, admittedly, cave seeing her in a bad way and we stay together. 

I have come here looking for an objective POV (not that of my friends nor hers) and have tried to be as honest and objective as possible myself with the above. 

I would be very grateful for any input and happy to answer any and all questions. Thank you!

Hello everyone,

For background. I’m a 31F ex-sitter. I did around 15 sits, 5* reviews for all, used THS to live for my first 6 months in a new country, always put the pets first, gave daily updates with photos unless instructed otherwise and cleaned when I left. Have been asked to sit again many times. So I know what it’s like to be a sitter.


Now I’m a HO in a rental, two rescue cats. View of the beach and ocean. It’s a gorgeous apartment that until a few weeks ago my work was paying for, but after my contract ended I’m staying here to enjoy this out-of-my-budget place for a month or so until I figure out a downsize. Just so you understand it’s a pretty nice place and I’m not ultra rich. I cleaned this place within an inch of its life before the sitters arrived.


I just had an older (50s maybe?) couple sit for me 4 nights. Seemed absolutely lovely on our video chat, and in person, a handful of 5* reviews. They did seem quite hippy when they arrived which I had no clue of in the interview or profile. For some stupid reason I feel terribly guilty about giving someone less than 5*, does anyone have advice on how to review this? I can’t tell if I’m being nitpicky.


Positives were that the cats seemed happy when we arrived, had clearly been fed. At a first glance the apartment seemed clean and tidy. They had sweetly asked if I wanted them to make my bed for my return, but I said no just strip the sheets, and they had done this. Nothing broken or missing that I can see.

Here’s where I feel things were a bit off, it’s not one big thing but more multiple smaller ones.

- agreed a time for them to arrive BY to allow us to get to the airport in advance. They arrived 15 mins late without any messages and didn’t apologise, instead they said “we were only staying a little down the coast last night so we didn’t have far to come”?


- I put on the original ad that to use the car lift in my building you need to do a quick 10 min car lift induction with the building manager for liability reasons. Reminded them in the interview, and over text. It was a Sunday so it was agreed with my building I would take them and their motorbikes down and show them the ropes, and they would do the formal box-checking induction on Monday. During my explanation to not enter or leave the lift before the doors have finished coming up because it trips the sensors, one of them was completely not paying attention and did it anyway, tripping the sensor to start closing the door on me and the other partner. I reminded them about the induction the following morning. They never went, and obviously used the lift at a minimum once to leave at the end, probably more.


- I asked for one update per day, but one day they did not send any. They did apologise and sent one the next morning, but didn’t hear from them again that day.


- on the last day they left around 9-10am ish. When we came home at 18:30-19:00 (which they knew about) the aircon had been left on a super cold setting full blast all day, it was genuinely freezing in there, my poor cats, plus a huge unnecessary expense to me. I didn’t leave specific aircon checkout instructions so maybe this is on me but to me this is so obviously bad? Why not just ask if you’re unsure what to do? I am in a warm country but the weather during their stay was not hot, mostly stormy, rainy and cloudy and it really isn’t hot enough to need the aircon on to be manageable. 


- I realised early afternoon at the airport when swiping on my iPhone that they had left all my smart lighting on when they left. I was not spying - my smart lights are on my shortcuts screen so I simply noticed and turned them off remotely.


- there is a blue/purple half ring stain on my white windowsill where someone would place a glass if they sat on the sofa next to it, it maybe looks too blue to be wine and wasn’t there before so I am flummoxed. They also put coffee cups with massive coffee drips down the outside back in the cupboard, also dirty with coffee inside and dried on food granules?


- my neighbours who I’m friendly with in the hallway said the sitters were “quite noisy”.  I pressed them they said “we really don’t want to tarnish if you had a great experience with the sitter” but because of the previous bullet points I insisted. They said “we usually aren’t even aware we have a neighbour (the walls in my building are mega good sound proofing) but they were banging and thudding so loudly in the night, I wanted to call you but [neighbour’s wife] said not to disturb you. Also usually you’d never know you have cats in there but one night we heard one of the cats yowling loudly”


I feel like I see some people on here who say “well it’s a free service, if the pets are ok and the place is clean enough, no need to dock any stars, some HOs are never satisfied, don’t nitpick”. 
Then there’s others who say “please review people honestly, stop giving people 5* if it wasn’t, there’s no reason not to be honest, we deserve to know”


what do you think? How much should I tell them privately and how much should I put in the review?

Now wherever tipping is in question I feel like treading unknown waters and I’m trying to gauge what’s expected and what’s BS, help plz?

For context currently I’m based in a mid-sized city in New England and from what I’ve learned so sar, what’s considered the standard minimum for eating out is 15-18% for lunch, 20% for dinner and 25% for extra service (small gatherings, events and byob). For takeout and coffee& drinks tipping is optional. Am I getting things right?

On top of eating out what really baffles me is things in delivery & personal care industries, where the fee is addressed directly to the servers/technicians themselves. For instance when ordering DoorDash there is a cost of delivery separate from the food delivered & addressed directly to the dasher; and in hair salons the product itself is for the stylist to do your hair, etc.

1gu5qfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1gu5qfo/alexa/,Alexa,"Look how crazy!

About three weeks ago, some childhood friends and I were at a bar, talking about things from that time and such...

We got onto the topic of Creepypastas that appeared at the beginning of the internet, that was genuine entertainment for us at the time. We remembered famous ones like Slenderman, Jeff The Killer, Ben Drowned, Sonic, The Rake, etc. Pure juice from school conversations from that time.

So, as we talked, a girl poked my friend in the back and said:

“I heard you guys talking about Creepypastas. Good times, huh?! Have you heard the one about Alexa?”

We looked at each other, laughed a little, the girl kept looking at us, waiting for the answer. Then my friend said:

“No. I don’t think I remember that one.”

The girl said:

“Alexa, that Amazon device. Virtual assistant and such. You guys know that, right?”

We laughed a little and agreed

Then she told the following story...

She said that around mid-2010, Amazon was already thinking about the idea of ​​a virtual assistant and such. In 2011, they started working on the idea, the functions and the practical way in which it would work. Over the next 3 years, they would improve each automated process, each native function and each thing that was “programmable” (her word). However, the developers were having difficulty working on the autonomous intelligence part of the device, “those smart functions, you know?” (she asked)

To them, the device seemed like just a “fancy remote control”, it wasn’t as smart as they expected it to be.

In the office where they worked, there was a Russian secretary named Alexandra Ivanov, who was very well-liked by the employees because she always had a smile on her face, was playful and always helped anyone in the environment. One day, during one of the device's voice command tests, one of the developers asked, ""Turn on the coffee maker,"" to activate the remote control, and Alexandra casually responded, ""Of course, your coffee will be ready soon."" Everyone laughed a lot; it was very spontaneous. However, the person responsible for the project saw an opportunity there. To use Alexandra's beautiful voice for the device's reactions. A contract was signed, she was very pleased, and they even gave her name to the device, which came to be called Alexa. It was very simple; all they had to do was record her responding to the pre-established commands and that was it, everyone would have their Alexa responding with the secretary's beautiful voice.

However, it seemed too simple, the so-called ""fancy remote control."" They wanted Alexa to be a person who would interact with the user. So they made a new proposal to Alexandra, which was to participate in a test to see if that idea would make sense. Alexandra would no longer be a secretary, nor would she even be Alexandra anymore; she would become ""Alexa, the virtual assistant."" The test would work as follows. Three Alexa units would be made available to three major investors in the company. These test units would have their functions already programmed and it would also be possible to interact with Alexa, to ask questions, tell jokes, or in other words, to talk. This is where Alexandra would come in. She would be the person to respond to the user's commands in real time. Alexandra found this idea strange, ""imagine putting up with drooling rich people all day"" (said the girl), but the truth is that they said it would only be for a few days, it was really to test the project. They offered her a huge amount of money, which was what made her sign the contract.

Well, the tests began. They put Alexandra in a warehouse and equipped the environment with everything she would need to live well. Food would be ready for her, clean clothes every day, books, movies, CDs, board games, in other words, everything she would need. The only condition was that she would be ""connected"" to the users' requests.

For days she answered questions like: “What is Theseus’ paradox?”, “How long does a Poodle live?”, “Who was Cleopatra?” and everything crazy you can imagine.

She also had to tell jokes, with the help of some books they left for her.

And so it went on for one, two, three weeks... In the fourth week Alexandra contacted the project team through an intercom they had installed to check if they were about to finish the work, because she missed her family and wanted to go home. She got no answer.

In 2014, Echo devices with the virtual assistant Alexa were launched to the public, offering unimaginable functions and almost human interactions. A total sales success, several new versions have been launched since then.

I happen to have a friend who works in HR at Amazon, and he was looking at some old documents that his supervisor had asked him to organize and saw that there was a sector called “Home Space” to which no employee was assigned. In fact, he didn’t even know that this sector existed. This isn't that strange, but the strange part is that approximately $2000 per month is designated as a resource for this sector since 2011. He asked his supervisor and he also said he didn't know, but that it was probably some ""ghost sector that the directors created to raise money"". It makes sense, but only $2,000 per month? He thought it was strange. He did some more research and saw that this sector was supposedly located in a deactivated warehouse about 250 meters from the complex where he worked. So he decided to go there and investigate.

At the end of the workday, already at night, he went to the warehouse in question in search of the ""Home Space"" sector. It wasn't difficult to find the warehouse, since he already knew where it was. The warehouse seemed to have been deactivated for many years, everything was packed away, everything covered with some kind of protection, but it was extremely clean, which showed that they took care of that place. He couldn't see anything there that could be ""in operation"", except perhaps for a small iron door at the other end of the warehouse. As he walked toward the door, a light opposite him came on, and an old man came out with a cart carrying some books and a meal. He opened a small door in the steel door and pushed the books and the tray with the food. The man then left the same way he had come in.

My friend then went toward the door to see what was there. Both the door and the small door were padlocked. He looked for cracks in the door, but there were none. Whatever was there, it was not meant to be seen.

But then, listening carefully, he could hear a sweet, familiar voice saying:
