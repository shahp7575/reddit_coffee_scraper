Okay with that out of the way...

Who's been busy this week? Let's find out:

https://i.redd.it/4ag81lg0xqre1.gif

\*\*Also, a quick note, as always, where we have at least a couple data points, I'll add the updates we have from the tracker with every update from each of these firms.\*\*

# ü´• DEI / Diversity Program Updates

* **Willkie**: Says they're still doing diversity hiring, but every single link to their LCLD program now leads to a *404* error on their site.

# üö® CALLBACKS, SCREENERS & OFFERS

**A ton of action from just Friday.** Here's a quick high level screenshot of some of the callback updates we're seeing on the tracker.

* **Goodwin**: Multiple updates here.
   * Callbacks going out from both NY and other offices. 
   * One student had their callback *Friday* and was told to expect a response within a week.
   * Check out the Goodwin tracker updates in the screenshot.

* **Fenwick**: Screener invites confirmed.
* **Willkie**: NY screeners are going out. 
   * Also ‚Äî one callback reported.
   * More details in the tracker screenshot below.

* **Paul Hastings**: One applicant got a *straight callback* for NY after sending in their application ‚Äî no screener.

* **Alston & Bird**: Callbacks confirmed.
* **Milbank NY**: Screeners going out to people who originally applied for 1L and never heard back ‚Äî looks like the silence is ending.
* **Kirkland**: One person‚Äôs 1L screener turned into an offer ‚Äî no need to reapply as a 2L. 
   * **SOME KEY INFO:** During a Zoom event, an associate said **it ‚Äúprobably makes sense to apply regardless of whether you‚Äôve finalized your 1L summer job.‚Äù** 
      * Considering the speed at which applications are opening this year, of course try to lock in 1L work ASAP but if you don't have it yet, apply now while things are open and update your resume once you do have it. 
* **Foley Hoag**: Their ‚ÄúCoffee and Conversations‚Äù event (targeting WashU) requires students to upload a resume, transcript, and headshot. All ‚Äúoptional,‚Äù of course ‚Äî but this *feels* like a soft interview.

# üì¨ REJECTION EMAILS WITH A TWIST

* **Simpson**: Sending out rejections that are but with one version that explicitly says the applicant is *expedited* for 2026 and doesn‚Äôt need to reapply.
* **Weil**: A new email wave is out. Some people are being asked to wait and apply again with spring grades; others are getting interview invites now. Seems like they‚Äôre doing both tracks simultaneously. See the two email screenshots here to see the difference:

1jnd090,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/1jnd090/spousespartners_who_pf2_with_you/,Spouses/Partners who PF2 with You?,"So, I've been playing TTRPGs for a good long while (although I'm a late-bloomer compared to many), and when I met my (now) wife over seven years ago, it was a hobby that I knew she had no interest in. I was totally cool with that, and she was totally cool with me having a nerdy hobby, even though she didn't really understand what it was. She's not someone who had any experience with fantasy literature -- I tried taking her through the first LOTR movie six years or so ago, and it took us nine full hours because of all the starts and stops she needed. The tl;dr is that...she's not a nerd, or at least, she *wasn't*...

But fast forward to last summer, and we went for coffee with another married couple we're friends with. It came up in conversation that they play 5e, and that got the wheels turning in my brain. I casually suggested maybe trying a monthly session together -- I've played a lot of Cypher (which is very storytelling/RP based and mechanics-light), and my best friend in town regularly GMs games in that system. It all came together pretty quickly, and my wife found herself having a lot of fun.

Well...you can see where this is going. After a few sessions of Cypher, my friend and I started chatting about selling them all on PF2, which we both love above all other systems. The other married couple were quickly amenable, and my wife was too...even though she wasn't quite sure why we needed to try a different system. Well, as of December we now play bi-weekly (with another GM we befriended), and in a couple of weeks, that will be weekly, as I'll be starting to GM a second campaign for the same group. My wife is really enjoying herself, and the group Discord has been a blast. I know she'll never be a died-in-the-wool gamer, and mechanics will never be her strong suit (though they're not mine either)...but it's been delightful to have her share the hobby with me. She's become a legitimate dice hoarder and has accessories out the wazoo.

Anyhow, thought I'd start this thread to see if many others have stories about spouses or partners who play -- whether through initial mutual interest, a gradual interest through osmosis, or perhaps even simple ""well, my partner does it, so I might as well too..."" All are valid ways to get into the game, after all. So...share your stories!",3,1743343186.0,Pathfinder2e,2,1.0,False

by c.w. cobblestone

The warm shower washed over me as I closed my eyes and smiled, grateful for the opportunity to use the hot-water knob that had once been off-limits.

The ‚Äúcold water only‚Äù edict had been lifted a few years earlier, along with other harsh rules that were imposed to shock my system. Once Cody and Aunt Sheila had successfully rewired my brain, and I‚Äôd truly accepted my humble place in the world, my betters had no reason to ‚Äúkeep me down‚Äù and put me through ‚Äúsissy maid boot camp.‚Äù Paradoxically, life got less degrading when I embraced degradation.

Sure, Cody and Liz still whipped me sometimes in the privacy of their bedroom when I‚Äôd done nothing wrong. But that was just foreplay, and I was thankful whenever my masters included me in their sexual activities, no matter what form that took. Mia continued being rude ‚Äî and sometimes outright cruel ‚Äî but I accepted that no situation can be perfect. I figured if my young mistress wanted to be bossy (or another ‚ÄòB‚Äô word), that was her prerogative.

Whenever Mia (or anyone else) yelled at me about something, instead of feeling humiliated or resentful, I‚Äôd accept responsibility for being wrong (even if I wasn‚Äôt) and vow to improve. As a sissy eunuch with no money and nowhere to go, my entire life was focused on pleasing the Hansens, and I wept inside whenever I fell short.

The old guest room, my quarters before Aunt Sheila‚Äôs visit, had been converted into a nursery for the coming bundle of joy. I remained in the basement, although after I was properly trained, my masters bought me a small cot. I said a prayer each night for the chance to sleep on something soft instead of that unforgiving, infernal concrete floor. And when I‚Äôd wake up, snuggling with my lace pillow beneath my Barbie blanket ‚Äî gifts from Brooke the previous Christmas ‚Äî I‚Äôd thank the heavens again.

It was still early, so after my invigorating shower, I did the hand-washing in the laundry sink. Despite being a eunuch, I still tingled with excitement whenever I‚Äôd handle Liz‚Äôs panties. Before washing each pair, I sniffed the crotches like I always had, which sent me into a submissive tizzy.

I hand-washed the girls‚Äô panties, too, but even though they were adults (and both haughtily beautiful), I just couldn‚Äôt think of Brooke and Mia in a sexual way, probably because they‚Äôd once been my stepdaughters. There was no naughty stuff involving the girls‚Äô panties; just impeccable laundry service.

I hand-washed Master‚Äôs boxers, too ‚Äî and, yes, I sniffed his crotches.

When the hand-washing was done, I drifted upstairs to start the Tuesday morning routine. I knew the family would wake up soon, so I puttered around in the kitchen, quietly pulling out the pots, pans and other utensils I‚Äôd be using to cook breakfast.

Brooke came down first as usual, and I served her coffee with honey and heavy whipping cream.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs my project coming?‚Äù She blew on her cup. ‚ÄúI need it tomorrow, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Miss, I‚Äôm almost done, Miss; I‚Äôve only got about thirty more entries for the bibliography. I‚Äôm hoping I can get a chance to work on it today after everyone leaves, Miss, but if not, I‚Äôll just stay up late to do it, so it‚Äôll be done by the morning.‚Äù

Brooke scrunched her brow. ‚ÄúYou really shouldn‚Äôt cut it so close, Mirabella. You know? What if something happens and you can‚Äôt get it done tonight?‚Äù

The truth was, I barely had time to get my regular chores done, let alone scrambling to put together a major class project. Of course, I wasn‚Äôt about to tell Brooke that; instead, like a good maid, I curtseyed, accepted responsibility and apologized profusely.

Brooke waved her hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no big deal. Just next time, don‚Äôt cut it so close. A third of my grade is riding on this.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Miss, I‚Äôll get it done tonight, even if I have to stay up all night, I promise. Oh, I‚Äôm so sorry, Miss; I should‚Äôve stayed up all night in the first place and got it all done, so it wouldn‚Äôt be last-minute.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, Mirabella, it‚Äôs fine, stop apologizing.‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúI want eggs Benedict, although wait till everyone comes down. Can you bring me my book bag first?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course, Miss.‚Äù

Just as I handed my young mistress her book bag, Liz and Cody came moseying down the stairs. I rushed into the kitchen to be ready with the coffee pot by the time they sat down at the dining room table. Mistress and Master both wanted bacon and eggs, which lessened my work.

I had three burners going on the stove while I hopped around getting the meals ready. At the worst possible time, when I had to tend to the eggs, Mia hollered, ‚ÄúMaid! I need coffee!!!‚Äù

‚ÄúUm ‚Ä¶ just one second, please?‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to ruin breakfast, Miss; I‚Äôll be right there, I‚Äôm so sorry!‚Äù

When the eggs were done, I hurried into the dining room with the coffee pot, and walked right into a family squabble.

‚ÄúYou got drunk again LAST night?‚Äù Liz shook her head. ‚ÄúWhat the hell, Mia. Your father and me aren‚Äôt letting you stay here for free so you can run around acting like some party animal. We loaned you the money for the shop to give you a good solid base, so you start saving money and get your life together, and eventually buy your own house ‚Äî not blow it in the damn bar every night.‚Äù

Mia folded her arms. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not blowing money at the bar ‚Äî guys buy me drinks.‚Äù

Brooke scowled at her sister. ‚ÄúSomeone told me you‚Äôve been seeing Conner Pilson? Is that true?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat business is it of yours who I see?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a coke dealer, you idiot!‚Äù Brooke‚Äôs eyes flashed. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you throwing your damn life away, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy life is just fine, Miss High-And-Mighty.‚Äù

Cody placed his hand on the table, and everyone shut up and turned to the head of the household.

‚ÄúAre you going out with a coke dealer, Mia?‚Äù His icy blue eyes fixed on his youngest daughter. ‚ÄúAre you? Don‚Äôt lie to me, honey.‚Äù

Mia huffed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs some big cartel guy. He sells eightballs.‚Äù

Liz hit the roof. ‚ÄúAre you fucking kidding me? I can tell you right now ‚Äî if you‚Äôre dating a cocaine dealer, you can pack your things and get the hell out right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dating him, Ma!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I heard,‚Äù Brooke said.

‚ÄúWe had sex a few times, alright?‚Äù Mia threw up her hands. ‚ÄúWhat the hell, I won‚Äôt see him again if it‚Äôs that big a deal ‚Äî it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm in love with the guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you doing coke?‚Äù Liz demanded.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù Mia made eye contact with both her parents while raising her right hand. ‚ÄúI hate how that shit makes people act. I swear to G-d, I‚Äôm not doing it. I smoke a little weed, but I don‚Äôt mess with coke. Conner‚Äôs cute and we had sex a few times, that‚Äôs ALL.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust be careful, honey.‚Äù Cody reached across the table and held his youngest daughter‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt associate with people who are involved with that shit. Even if you don‚Äôt do it yourself, if you‚Äôre anywhere around it, you can fall down a dark road fast ‚Äî not to mention getting arrested.‚Äù

Liz scoffed. ‚ÄúAnd if you go to jail, I can guarantee you we‚Äôre not bailing you out.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, Ma, I told you, I‚Äôll stop seeing him.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Thank you.‚Äù Liz sipped her coffee. ‚ÄúYour father and me don‚Äôt want to try to run your life, honey. We just love you, and don‚Äôt want to see you make a mistake that‚Äôll haunt you for the rest of your life.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you, too, Ma.‚Äù Mia looked up at me and frowned. ‚ÄúWell? Are you gonna pour my coffee? Sometime this week, maybe?‚Äù

‚ÄúS-sorry, Miss,‚Äù I apologized while filling my young mistress‚Äôs cup.

Liz clucked her tongue. ‚ÄúMirabella, you‚Äôre getting a little chubby; it looks like you‚Äôre the one who‚Äôs pregnant.‚Äù

I curtseyed. ‚ÄúUm, Dr. Zachary said weight-gain is a side-effect of the lactation medication, Mistress.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I won‚Äôt have a fat maid, so you need to lose ten pounds.‚Äù Liz took a bite of eggs. ‚ÄúI want you in perfect shape for when the baby gets here. Understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúY-yes, Ma‚Äôam.‚Äù As I curtseyed to my mistress, I resolved to cut my already spartan calorie intake. Rather than feeling jealous as I stood there watching the family eat their hearty breakfasts, I was happy for the opportunity to show my mistress I could lose weight for her.

After the family left the house, I tidied up and finished Brooke‚Äôs history project bibliography. It was just after noon and most of my chores were already out of the way ‚Äî and in my masters‚Äô household, good sissies were entitled to breaks once in a while. With a appreciative smile, I drifted to the basement, curled up on my cot and thumbed through my cellphone, reading articles about breastfeeding techniques.

I felt a warm glow inside, knowing that I‚Äôd be caring for my masters‚Äô royal offspring in such an intimate way. A new baby also meant I‚Äôd be getting even less sleep, although that didn‚Äôt faze me. In my numb, brainwashed state, all I could think about was how much easier the new parents‚Äô lives would be, thanks to my loyal service.

//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\

I was marinating the ribs I planned to make for dinner when Brooke came home from college accompanied by a young man her age.

‚ÄúHey, Mirabella, this is Aiden.‚Äù Brooke smiled at her companion. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a friend from my history class. Aiden, this is our maid, Mirabella.‚Äù

‚ÄúWelcome, sir,‚Äù I said with a polite tone and curtsey.

The guy barely grunted at me before returning his attention to my pretty young mistress. ‚ÄúYou said the civilization chart is up in your room?‚Äù he asked, his intentions obvious.

‚ÄúYeah, come on up,‚Äù Brooke replied with a devilish grin.

As the couple ascended the stairwell, my young boss called, ‚ÄúMirabella, bring a couple iced teas up.‚Äù

When I entered Brooke‚Äôs bedroom with the drinks, Aiden was marveling over the timeline I‚Äôd put together on multiple whiteboards.

‚ÄúMan, I wish I had a maid to do all this stuff for me,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúMirabella‚Äôs the best.‚Äù Brooke took her glass of iced tea from the tray and smiled at me. ‚ÄúThanks ‚Äî now, go find something to do, and give us a little privacy in here, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, of course, Miss.‚Äù

As I left the bedroom, I heard Aiden say, ‚ÄúDamn, that is SO COOL. Can I borrow him to come clean my apartment?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see why not,‚Äù my mistress replied before I shut the door behind me.

More work for the maid, I thought ‚Äî and another opportunity to make one of my betters look good.

//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\//\\\\

Aiden stayed for dinner, passing the Liz and Cody‚Äôs parental grilling with flying colors. My masters were clearly impressed with the young man their daughter had brought home, who carried a 3.8 GPA and owned the all-time record for passing yards in a season by a Colorado Mesa Mavericks quarterback, which, incredibly, he‚Äôd broken as a freshman. Even Mia seemed besotted by her older sister‚Äôs square-jawed, broad-shouldered boyfriend, giggling like a schoolgirl at his jokes and making goo-goo eyes at him.

Of course, Mia being Mia, she couldn‚Äôt help being mean to me, even with company over ‚Äî or maybe BECAUSE company was over. Whatever her motivation, she started on me after nibbing the meat off a rib, setting down the bone, and looking around at the table in front of her.

‚ÄúHey, maid, how am I supposed to wipe my hands with no napkin?‚Äù she asked with a frown.

‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry, Miss.‚Äù I curtseyed, before fetching a napkin for my young mistress ‚Äî but when I approached her, she wiped her hands on my apron, leaving behind a smudge of barbecue sauce. She glanced at Aiden, who laughed uncomfortably.

Liz clucked her tongue. ‚ÄúWell, THAT was rude.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, where was I supposed to wipe my hands, Ma?‚Äù Mia shrugged. ‚ÄúIf the maid don‚Äôt know how to set a table, that‚Äôs not MY problem.‚Äù

My mistress grimaced at Aiden and shook her head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about that ‚Äî Brooke‚Äôs little sister is a spoiled brat.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay, Mrs. Hansen, it didn‚Äôt bother me at all,‚Äù the polite young man replied.

‚ÄúPlease, honey ‚Äî call me Liz,‚Äù my mistress said with a smile.

Just then, Cody‚Äôs cellphone rang. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

My master listened to something on the other end of the line, his expression hardening by the second.

‚ÄúUm, okay, thanks for letting me know, Raul,‚Äù he finally said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to Liz about it and get back to you ASAP.‚Äù

My master hung up with tears in his eyes. ‚ÄúThat was Raul. Aunt Sheila died in her sleep last night.‚Äù

There was a collective gasp.

‚ÄúOMG, I‚Äôm so sorry, honey.‚Äù Liz grasped her husband‚Äôs hand and kissed it while Brooke and Mia wiped their eyes. Even though the old woman had been terrible to me, I, too, was dejected at the news of her demise, if only because it made my masters sad.

‚ÄúRaul said she left her entire estate to me ‚Äî including Missy,‚Äù Cody said. ‚ÄúHe said it‚Äôs in her will that she wanted us to have him after she died; or, if not, she‚Äôs asked that we find another home for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really need two maids, do we?‚Äù Liz sipped her iced tea.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù Cody replied.

‚ÄúOoh, let me have him.‚Äù Mia rubbed her hands together. ‚ÄúI could use him full-time at the store.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust hold your horses,‚Äù Liz said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure everything out after the funeral,‚Äù Cody added.

The rest of the dinnertime conversation focused on stories about Aunt Sheila. Because company was over, the discussion was toned down; Brooke told her boyfriend that her great aunt had helped me become my true self, the way she‚Äôd counseled multiple trans maids in the past, although she left out how cruel the old lady had been while ‚Äúhelping‚Äù me. Aiden said he‚Äôd never heard of trans people who wanted to be maids, although he seemed perfectly open-minded about the issue, revealing that he had a cousin who was trans and a gay uncle.

Brooke‚Äôs boyfriend left after supper, having impressed everyone in the family. Earlier that evening, my young boss had promised Aiden she‚Äôd make me available to clean his apartment, and while I was happy to provide service to Brooke‚Äôs boyfriend, I barely had any free time as it was, and I wondered how I could possibly squeeze that chore in with all my other duties.

But I had an even bigger problem on my hands: The possibility of another sissy maid coming to live with us.

I had been trained to enjoy being overworked, mistreated and humiliated by my masters. I thought I‚Äôd outgrown feelings like jealousy and resentment.

But thinking of another maid possibly serving alongside me churned me up inside.

When I went to bed that night, I said a prayer:

i've (29m) met and liked this girl (29F/Diagnosed Autistic) for many years since high school but we didn't interact as much. fast forward to last year, I moved to the USA but shes still on my native country, and by the last trimester we started talking and we had this mutual spark. On december 15th I took the step and confess my feelings for her. Hooray it was mutual. We haven't started bf/gf  relationship yet but we pay respect to each other (or so do I)

Everything was goin great except for a litrle discussion over a guy postin some suspicious comments over her Facebook's post. We got to the point and made it clear that it was just a random guy. Still not trusting him.

I started noticing that some things weren't right  by mid febraury. But I thought it was certain paranoia of mine. Later on, she confessed that due to past traumas with her relationships, she got scared over not being able to control her feelings and want to take it slow. Ok took me a while to understand but ok I get it.

Fast forward to this month, some terrible things happened to her: Almost got sexually abused and lost a friend due to certain circunstances around them and her friend's cousin. Ok, I got it, you're feeling bad, you're feeling is all your fault but its not and many things that I said to console her and make her feel better.

Due to those circunstances, she went out with a friend that hadn't seen for around 5 years, she told me. But its been three fucking times and Im starting to feel uncomfortable 

First time they went for a coffee and some sushi. Next time, that next week, they went out again for some coffee.

But, this third time was yesterday and this guy insisted on take her out and go to a place with trampolins, ice skating, some dinousaur showcase and then went to have some fried chicken to dine.

My name is Elle and this is my story. There has been a lot of self reflection, acceptance and healing in the years since this happened. That part is for my memoir that is currently being written. Thank you for witnessing me as I‚Äôve held this close to my heart for the past 2 years with nowhere to share it until now. 

‚Äî‚Äî


In May of 2021 I joined an online membership promising me a safe place within a circle of authentic sisterhood. There was a deal swirling around which allowed me to secure the discounted price of $299 per year which felt like a steal compared to the usual annual price of $499. After all, can you really put a price tag on connection and sisterhood?

Once I passed the gatekeepers with a one on one Zoom interview, I was let into the membership, encouraged to introduce myself, free to explore the past threads and invited to join the live calls. Immediately I sensed a sort of cliquish energy, noticing that some women within the membership had more of a say than others. Their posts seemed of more value. Their opinions held in higher regard. I quickly realized that these women were part of Emilee‚Äôs inner circle and that translated into this virtual space. 

I joined the first community call with Emilee as host and was immediately put off by her energy. There was a lack of warmth to her, an uninviting presence. Almost like she didn‚Äôt want to be there, but she had to be. I ignored those feelings because I had been finding such value in the past threads of mothers sharing their experiences on everything from fevers, food, conception and all other topics I currently was interested in learning about. 

That winter I reached out to one of the women I had connected with through the membership stating I was about to join the Radical Birthkeeper School. Having just completed the program herself she insisted she speak with me on the phone before I make that choice. She shared how she does not advise I waste my money as the school is not what it claims to be, how she wishes she could get her $6,000 back, how it was a mistake. I trusted this woman so I decided against taking the course. 

In February, after a wild pregnancy, I freebirthed a beautiful baby boy with Down syndrome. I was given a lot of support from the women in the membership as I navigated that realization, but not from Emilee. The following month, after I completed my first 40 days, we closed on a home a few towns over from Emilee. We moved from Black Mountain out to Murphy, NC where I continued my healing and processing. At 5 months old I took my son to get an echocardiogram after noticing some concerning signs. I am so thankful I did as he had a large hole in his heart that would require surgical repair, which he received a month after that echo. 

We arrived home from Charleston in October. The colors were warm and the air was crisp since we were last here, nature ready for the season of release. So much had changed, outwardly but also inwardly. Watching your baby be ushered into the operating room will do that to a mother. There is no way I was going to remain the same. Upon arriving home there was a tenderness of my soul unlike I‚Äôve ever known. The past 17 months had been spent holding so much throughout my pregnancy, birth, postpartum and my baby‚Äôs open heart surgery. I was ready to be held. I continued showing up within the community, despite feelings of exhaustion from the bi-weekly trips back to Asheville for post-op appointments and the long list of daily medication distribution which disrupted our much needed sleep. During this time I still hadn‚Äôt crossed paths with Emilee as she was newly postpartum. We were constantly circling around one another. I had been sharing my journey within the membership, intimate details of my precious son‚Äôs surgery and recovery. There were moments when I wondered why she‚Äôd never reached out to offer her support, let alone acknowledge my posts within the group. I accredited my feelings to being overly sensitive and instead of taking offense, I sent her messages of postpartum support. She sent a reply inviting me to a women‚Äôs circle on her land in a few weeks which I happily accepted. 

November was coming to an end. I met one of the women in a local coffee shop to connect over chai lattes. I brought her a gift of chocolate covered almonds from my home and we shared stories of our past and how we came to live in North Carolina. I asked her about the plans she had for Thanksgiving to which she briefly mentioned going to Emilee‚Äôs house. Days later I reached out to one of the other women I had grown a friendship with, inviting her family to my house for the holiday, excitedly sharing my plans to make a cheesecake from scratch for the first time. She told me  to let her know how it turns out, but didn‚Äôt acknowledge my invite. I began to wonder if everyone was going to Emilee‚Äôs. I spent the next week waiting for an invitation that never came. 

I woke on Thanksgiving morning with a stiff neck. We had no plans that day, we were unable to travel to be with family due to my son‚Äôs recovery and I felt the crushing weight of feeling excluded. Nothing prepared me for the visual of seeing the Instagram posts of that day as an outsider. Happening a short 40 minutes from our home, the children‚Äôs table full of the kids my son had played with at a birthday party a few days prior. The women I had grown friendships with all circling the table, smiles on their faces, home-cooked food filling their plates. 9 families. My family, the only one not invited. 

I wish I could say I put on a happy face and made my baby‚Äôs first Thanksgiving a memorable one, but that‚Äôs not what happened. It was a somber day with physical pain and even greater emotional pain. I didn‚Äôt understand why we‚Äôd been excluded when I had been showing up within her membership for 2 years and within the local community for the past 6 months. I‚Äôd had some of those women to my home, they walked my land and ate my food. My toddler had played with their children. I imagined if the roles were reversed, of course I would‚Äôve extended an invite. Welcomed them in with an open heart. Fed them, gave them a warm hug with words of encouragement and acknowledgment of all they‚Äôd recently been through. Why wasn‚Äôt I receiving this authentic sisterhood I‚Äôd been sold on? 

Thanksgiving was the first time I realized we were on the outside of all of it. Being the only family excluded from that dinner was painful and brought up so many feelings in regards to belonging and worthiness. I questioned why. I wondered what more I could have done to be included. Sharing my heart and my story on the FBS Membership for two years, showing up to multiple women‚Äôs circles and gatherings, being a friend‚Äînone of that was enough. How could these women exclude me after knowing what I had just endured in the past year? It had only been two months since my freebirthed son had his chest sliced open during open-heart surgery. What I needed more than ever was loving women to hold me. Surely there was enough compassion to be invited in!

I pushed it all down and committed to showing up to the women‚Äôs circle Emilee had invited me to a few weeks before Thanksgiving, even though it took a lot of courage to attend that day. During the circle I quickly realized it was unlike any I had ever experienced. Most circles I had attended up until that point allowed the women to share without crosstalk or interjection. This circle felt like an interrogation. Who am I? Where did I come from? Did my baby ‚Äúreally need‚Äù open-heart surgery? I shared my story, feeling uncomfortable while doing so, knowing Emilee wasn‚Äôt asking from a place of love. The circle continued on, everyone talking in their own conversations. That‚Äôs when I heard it. Emilee sharing a story about Johnny, following it with a big smile and the words, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just RETARDED like that.‚Äù

I stopped breathing in that moment. I glanced around at some of the other women, hoping someone would speak the words that I couldn‚Äôt seem to find in that moment. Emilee cast down her eyes and looked to the side. I wondered if she recognized what she‚Äôd said, but instead, she lifted her head and began telling a different story. My heart was shattered. I always imagined the first time I would hear the word used after birthing a baby with Down syndrome would be by a punk teenager on the street. To hear it used by the ‚Äúleader‚Äù of a community, to hear it used in what is meant to be a safe space such as a women‚Äôs circle, to be seated in a circle with 10+ other women who didn‚Äôt hear/care/speak up‚Ä¶ I was heartbroken. What does this mean for my son and his future here? Was the reason Emilee never showed support for me and my baby because he has Down syndrome? How could she so freely use the word ‚Äúretarded‚Äù in a women‚Äôs circle after I had just finished sharing the story of birthing a baby with Down syndrome? 

I pondered these questions for days, then called one of the women present that night. I asked her opinion on how she thinks I should move forward regarding this. Her response to me was, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt police other people‚Äôs choice of words.‚Äù It was disappointing to hear, but in my desperation to be accepted, I decided to let it go. Surely she didn‚Äôt even notice what she‚Äôd said. Forgive. If it is used again, address it lovingly. Forgive. Forgive. Forgive. But it continued to eat away at me as I felt a fierce protectiveness over my son. If this word is being used so casually, and possibly around the children within the community, it is only a matter of time before they begin to use the word themselves. What are we teaching them?

It was a few days after this circle that I got a voice note from Emilee. When I saw her name pop up on my phone, for a second, I believed it was to apologize for being careless with her words, for her lack of sensitivity to me and my situation. That is not what it was about. She, in a phony-sounding voice, asked me if I‚Äôd be interested in financially contributing to the new school property with her and Arielle. A few weeks ago I was too much of a stranger to be invited to Thanksgiving. Now, after a single two-hour circle, I was close enough to be a partner in a $400k purchase? I declined. I felt sick to my stomach. All along the way my body kept giving me signs that this group of women wasn‚Äôt aligning with my values, my heart. Why was I pushing so hard to be accepted in?

I would continuously be left out in the following weeks‚Äîthe group chat, dinners that I‚Äôd see happening on Instagram, a Christmas parade where, once again, we were the only family not invited. My sons missing out once again. Many times I had decided it was time to let it all go. But something kept me coming back‚Äîmy children. I could endure so much pain and so much rejection for the sake of my children. I wanted them to have meaningful connections with children from like-minded families. I wanted a community for them. I was slowly building friendships with some of the women, so there were moments of hope. Or so I told myself. Having my toddler attend school with the other children was what got me through during the month of December. The night of the women‚Äôs circle, Emilee had invited my 3 year old son to join the Yurt School in the new year. It was my light at the end of what seemed to be never-ending darkness. He would benefit so greatly from it. But as it turned out, our experience at Yurt School would cause emotional damage that would take years to heal.

‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever talked about you coming on the podcast! Let‚Äôs do it!‚Äù
I receive this text from Emilee, and without hesitation, I respond, ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll have to think about that one! I‚Äôm a bit camera-shy!‚Äù
No response.
Minutes later, an email lands in my inbox, requesting to schedule a day to record an episode of the Freebirth Society Podcast. So much for honoring my need to think about it. I choose January 20th and try to convince myself that a month will be enough time to work up the nerve‚Äînot to be on camera, but to sit one-on-one with Emilee and share the most intimate story I have.

Orientation day for YurtSchool was concerning. There were only two children there. Right away, I could tell the teacher was not a real teacher‚Äîat least not in the sense I had imagined. She mentioned that when one of the children was choking on a beef stick, she stuck her finger down his throat to fish it out. I didn‚Äôt say anything then but later sent her a message, telling her that is not what you do if a child is choking. I asked if she knew the Heimlich maneuver or CPR. She responded that she was certified, but it had been a long time and that she would sign up for a child-specific certification that night.

I wasn‚Äôt entirely comfortable sending my newly three year old son alone the next day, so I texted Emilee, asking if I could shadow him one more day. I shared that I wanted to see how the teacher handled the full roster of children. I expressed my concern about the safety of the large pond that sits just below the yurt. Emilee seemed defensive and told me, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not really how we do things.‚Äù So I compromised‚ÄîI decided to send him for only two hours and visit with one of the women in a nearby yurt. 
Halfway through, I texted to check in and was told he was doing well‚Äîobserving and smiling. When I picked him up, I asked the teacher if she thought he‚Äôd do better with a longer stretch of time at the next school day. She assured me, confidently, that he would do great.

That Thursday, I left him for a total of three hours. During his time at school, I received an Instagram message from one of the dads. He had dropped his son off a bit late that morning and saw my son in the little red car at the playground, smiling and having so much fun. That gave me peace of mind. When I arrived to pick him up, he was playing with one of the girls. I told him it was time to go, so they began singing the Clean Up song while putting away their toys. The other children walked us to the door, giving him high-fives and fist bumps as we left.

The next school day was going to be a rainy day, which meant the children would likely be inside all day. I had heard the boys were more physically aggressive on days like that.
When we arrived, one of the women came too close with her puppy and it jumped on him, which scared him. That made him clingy when I tried to leave, but eventually, he sat down to play, and all was well.
The YurtSchool group chat conversation throughout the day about the boys' physicality made me nervous. When my son came home, I asked about his day. He began talking about ‚Äúhitting.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure if he was saying he had been hit or if he had witnessed someone else being hit. So I asked in the chat for clarification and was told by the other women that my son hadn‚Äôt been involved in any of the incidents that day. 

When Emilee called that night, I assumed it was to clarify what had happened with the hitting at school earlier.
I imagined she would share her plan to make the pond safer. 
I hoped she would explain how the teacher actually is qualified and capable.

Instead, she told me that because my son is ‚Äúnonverbal in school‚Äù and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt play with the other children,‚Äù autism was suspected.
I couldn‚Äôt breathe.
Of all things, I was not expecting this.
Was this really happening?
She said there was suspicion that my child is ‚Äúon the spectrum‚Äù and because of that he is ‚Äúnot a good fit‚Äù for the school she was creating. My heart pounded. I felt like I was going to throw up.
I tried explaining that he is very verbal at home and that perhaps he wasn‚Äôt playing with the others because he has never been in a social environment like this before. It might take time and some patience from the teacher!
She then proceeded to read me a list of autism signs from the internet.
I was shaking.
I told her his behaviors stem from what our family has endured over the past few years‚Äîa possible insecure attachment. She dismissed it outright.
‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt be the reason,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAll the kids are ‚ÄòCovid kids,‚Äô and they aren‚Äôt showcasing these behaviors.‚Äù
She ignored everything I said about my son. About my family. About our life.
Emilee Saldaya knew‚Äîwithout ever meeting my son, mind you‚Äîthat it was most likely autism.
Knowing my son, I knew intuitively this was an incorrect assumption. It felt like I was speaking to a pediatrician who was trying to tell me something about my own child, as if they knew him better than I did.
Why was this woman doing the exact thing she warns mothers about when dealing with the medical establishment?
In that phone call, she tried to convince me my child was autistic.
She gaslit me repeatedly.
She was matter-of-fact.
She sounded, almost, happy?
This was how she would get rid of me, of my family‚Äîfor good.
Exclude us from the school was to exclude us fully.
I hung up that call feeling confused and angry.
This was the final sign I needed to walk away from it all.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt sleep.
I cried so deeply that my ancestors couldn‚Äôt bear the sound of my sadness. They joined me in the quiet dark and wept with me.
I grabbed my stomach.
It felt like I was trying to grasp my womb, my pain.
I dug my hands into the place that hurt the most.
Pain caused by other women is felt right there.
As my sons slept soundly, I came undone.

The next morning I logged onto the membership and deleted every post I had made, which was many as I‚Äôd been very active over the two years since I joined. I left the one where I shared about the birth of my son. I wanted women who gave birth to a baby with Down syndrome to be able to find me. I then sent an email to cancel my membership. 

After that, I sent a long, detailed message to the group chat.
The ending read:
‚ÄúI was supposed to share my story on the FBS Podcast next week. I‚Äôve decided not to. It doesn‚Äôt feel aligned to get on a webcam and share my story when, all along the way, I was shown no true compassion in real life.
What I realize is that my time and experience with the Hayesville community is part of my story‚Äîit is still unfolding.
All of the children are beautiful, perfect, and worthy. Even the ones who show aggression and hit. Even the ones you suspect have special needs. Especially those children.
May the babies growing in the wombs of the women within this community be accepted and supported‚Äîno matter their abilities. That is my prayer.
The YurtSchool email ended by saying, ‚ÄòThe school is at the center of this village we are creating.‚Äô
But we are no longer part of the school.
And we were never truly welcomed into this village.‚Äù

March, 2025

My eyes watch his little body move across the grass of his play school, his mouth wide in a fit of laughter.
The warm South Florida sun causes sweat to drip down his skin.
He runs alongside his friends, hopping onto a tricycle. One sweet child sits in the front, while he and another take the back. They zoom around the walkway until they are done with the trike. Now they grab paintbrushes, painting pictures of swimming pools and giraffes.
Next, they greet a centipede. Someone picks it up and sticks it toward one of the girls, who screeches in both fright and delight.
They all run inside.
Music is playing.

The place wasn't packed. When I came in, there was just like a table or two that's busy and it was a humid afternoon to boot. The cafe is surfer-themed and al fresco (somewhat) and one of the busy table's near the sidewalk pavement fronting the cafe itself.

Ten or so mins in, rain started to fall outside. Just when I was glancing here and there and appreciating the decors, my gaze went to the table in question and I just saw (at least to me) a beautiful sight of two people in that particular table chatting amicably with the rain in the backdrop.

Instinctively, I pulled my phone camera out and snapped a photo of the view. It was calming and mesmerizing at the same time, and I just didn't really care for anything else but to capture the moment. I have never done something intentionally to capture a stranger (or two's) photo even once in my life but just the sight was just something I can't pass up.

Right after, I adjusted the photo angle and lighting effects and went over to their table to offer the picture to them. At this point I have zero expectations to their possible reactions HOWEVER I just tried my best to tell them and apologize firstly for doing such without permission, and that I'm not a professional, definitely NOT a creep, and was just so moved at what I saw that I snapped their picture and definitely planning to share it to them and delete it on my phone afterwards.

I didn't really care if they liked it. To my surprise, they were both gracious about it, smiled and said they liked it so I sent the picture to one of them happily and of course deleted the photo on my phone with their supervision.

Looking back, not sure if I will have the courage to do something like it again. Ig am just relieved my spur-of-the-moment decision to do something cuckoo (at least in Manila's culture) once in my dull life didn't go off the rails and caused unintentional distress to anybody.

I've been titrating on Medikinet XL for a couple of months now and I'm on 30mg a day. I've found since I went up to the 30mg a few weeks ago that I'm needing to go to the loo ALL the time - and it's a bit inconvenient as I'm a scrub nurse in theatres and I can't exactly nip out for a wee when I'm mid-case and scrubbed in! 

I also get some spectacular dry-mouth with it. I try not to drink TOO much and over-hydrate, so I have about 1.5-2l of water over the course of a shift, and then have some mints or hard-boiled sweets to suck on during the rest of the time. I've mostly cut out caffeine (except the odd coffee in a morning before work) and I don't really drink fizzy pop much, so I don't think it's either of those being irritant to my bladder, and I've done a dipstick to make sure I don't have a UTI coming. 

Has anyone managed to find a balance with this? Is it something that goes away after a while? I feel like the 30mg is a good dose for me at the moment, and don't know if titrating any higher would cause worse side-effects without giving me much more efficacy. ",4,1743342144.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

1jncl2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1jncl2h/cramping/,Cramping,"Hi All,

I (44M) did a local marathon yesterday (flat, fast course). Got a big PR (sub 2:50) and anyone looking at the splits (held high 6:20‚Äôs for first 10, mid to low 6:20‚Äôs for next 10, and then low 6:1X‚Äôs for the last 6) would have assumed it went perfectly (and I suppose overall it did), but the limiting factor for me has and always will be cramping. 

I rarely do races. I really just enjoy running for the sake of running / being out in nature. So this was only my 4th marathon despite running a lot and being in my 40‚Äôs (others were in 2009, 2022 and 2024). In the others I‚Äôve never really followed much of a plan or paid any attention to nutrition until race day (where I‚Äôd try and take a gel every ~45 mins and try and take on some water). So all the cramping I had experienced previously, I had put down to poor preparation on my side. 

However for this one I used a proper coach, got serious about my training block, nutrition during training, nutrition in the lead up to the race, and a very comprehensive fueling plan for race day. I carb and sodium loaded in the days leading up, and stayed well hydrated. Had overnight steel cut oats, water, lmnt and coffee, 3 hours before the race. And during the race took on 1 x Neversecond c30 (mix of caffeinated and non-caffeinated) gel every 25 minutes, which gave me ~450mg sodium, ~70g carbs and ~290 calories per hour. Along with plenty of water.  

Also the training plan involved strength / plyo work that I had never done before. And was otherwise was a very solid block with plenty of speed work, progression, MP interval long runs, etc, capping out at 82 mpw at the peak. 

Despite all of the above I still experienced cramping. Came on at the halfway point. Starting in my toes and arch of my feet. Then working up to calves. Never enough to properly slow me down or make me stop, but you know that feeling where it‚Äôs on the knife edge, and one badly placed foot strike will cause a total seize up. Basically have to really manage it. My legs otherwise felt good, and from a respiratory perspective I felt great. So this is really my limiting factor, and if I can figure it out I think I‚Äôll be able to really take a big step forward pace-wise. 

Any tips / thoughts would be really appreciated 

Cheers

## Identifying the Culprit: Is it Really the base?

Before you rush to buy a new chefman 1.8 L Digital Electric Kettle Replacement Base RJ11-17-TCTI-V2,it‚Äôs crucial to determine if the base is actually the problem. Manny issues can mimic a faulty base, so a bit of troubleshooting can save you time and money.

Here are a few common symptoms that might indicate a problem with your kettle base, as well as potential choice causes:

*   **Kettle Won't Heat:** This is the most obvious sign. however, before blaming the base, ensure the kettle is properly seated on the base. Also,check the power outlet to make sure it‚Äôs working. A simple test is to plug another appliance into the same outlet. Sometimes, the issue isn't the Chefman kettle not working, but a tripped circuit breaker.
*   **Kettle Turns On but Doesn't Boil:** The digital display on the kettle might light up, but the water doesn't reach boiling point. this could indicate a problem with the heating element itself, either in the base or within the kettle. It could also be a faulty thermostat.
*   **Burning Smell or Smoke:** This is a serious sign that something is wrong, and you should immediately unplug the kettle. It indicates a short circuit or a component overheating, potentially within the kettle heating base. Do not attempt to use the kettle until it's been properly inspected.
*   **Error Message on the Display:** Some Chefman kettles display error messages that can definitely help pinpoint the problem. Consult your kettle's manual to decipher the meaning of any displayed codes.If you have ruled out other potential causes and still suspect the base, it‚Äôs time to move on to finding a RJ11-17-TCTI-V2 replacement base.

## Finding a Chefman Kettle Base RJ11-17-TCTI-V2

Locating the specific Chefman 1.8 liter kettle base can sometimes be challenging, as replacement parts aren't always readily available directly from the manufacturer. Here's a strategic approach to finding one:

1.  **Chefman's Official Website:** While Chefman doesn't always list individual replacement parts, it's always worth checking their website first. Search for ""Chefman kettle parts"" or ""RJ11-17-TCTI-V2 replacement base"" directly on their site. even if the base isn't listed, you may be able to contact their customer support and inquire about it's availability.

2.  **Online Marketplaces (eBay, Amazon, etc.):** Online marketplaces are often the best bet for finding niche replacement parts. Search for ""Chefman kettle base online,"" ""Buy chefman RJ11-17-TCTI-V2,"" or ""Chefman kettle RJ11 17 TCTI V2"" on eBay and Amazon. Be sure to carefully check the seller's reputation and read reviews before making a purchase. Pay close attention to the product description and images to ensure you're buying the correct part. Because these sites often have used or refurbished options, you may find a great deal.

3.  **Appliance Parts Retailers:** Several online retailers specialize in appliance parts. Search for ""electric kettle replacement part"" or specifically ""Chefman kettle parts"" on these sites. Be sure to have the model number (RJ11-17-TCTI-V2) handy to ensure you find the correct match.

4.  **Local Appliance Repair Shops:** Checking with local appliance repair shops can sometimes yield surprising results. Thay may have salvaged parts from previously repaired kettles or be able to source a replacement for you. This is especially helpful if you're unsure about installing the base yourself.

5.**Consider Refurbished or used Options:** If sourcing a brand-new base proves tough or expensive, consider purchasing a refurbished or used Chefman kettle power base. These options are often more affordable and can still provide a functional replacement. Be sure to carefully inspect the item's condition and the seller's return policy before committing to a purchase.

## The Cost Factor: Are Ther Cheaper Alternatives?

The price of a genuine Chefman RJ11-17-TCTI-V2 replacement base can vary significantly depending on the source and availability.Before making a purchase, consider these cost-saving alternatives:

1.  **Repair the Existing Base:** If you're pleasant with basic electrical repairs, you might be able to fix the existing base yourself.

## DIY Repair or Professional Help?

Once you've acquired a replacement base, you'll need to install it. The complexity of the installation will depend on your technical skills and the design of the kettle.

**DIY Installation:**

If you're comfortable with basic appliance repair, you might be able to install the replacement base yourself. Here's a general outline of the process:

1.  **Unplug the Kettle:** Always unplug the kettle from the power outlet before attempting any repairs.
2.  **Disassemble the Old Base:** Carefully disassemble the old base, noting the location of all screws and wires. Take photos or draw diagrams to help you remember how everything goes back together.
3.  **Connect the Wires:** Connect the wires from the kettle to the corresponding terminals on the new base. Ensure the connections are secure and properly insulated. The wiring to the kettle‚Äôs base should be relatively easy to undo and redo.
4.  **Reassemble the Base:** Reassemble the base, making sure all screws are tightened and all components are properly aligned.
5.  **Test the Kettle:** Fill the kettle with water and test its functionality. Monitor it closely for any signs of overheating or malfunction.

## Preventing Future Kettle Base Problems

Once you have your Chefman 1.8L Digital Electric Kettle (RJ11-17-TCTI-V2) working again, it‚Äôs worth taking steps to prevent future issues:

1.  **Descaling Regularly:** Mineral buildup from hard water can damage the heating element and affect the kettle's performance. Descaling the kettle regularly (every 1-3 months, depending on water hardness) is crucial. Use a commercially available descaling solution or a mixture of white vinegar and water.

2.  **Proper Usage:** Avoid overfilling the kettle, as this can cause water to spill into the base and damage the electrical components. Also,don't let the kettle boil dry,as this can overheat the heating element and shorten its lifespan.

3.  **Cord Care:** Avoid wrapping the power cord tightly around the base, as this can damage the cord and cause it to fray. Store the cord loosely to prevent strain.

4.  **Gentle Handling:** Avoid dropping or bumping the kettle, as this can damage both the kettle and the base. Handle the kettle with care, especially when placing it on and removing it from the base.

5.  **Check the Cord Periodically:** Keep an eye on the cord running to the Chefman kettle power base. If you see fraying or exposed wires, discontinue use immediately. You can replace the cord yourself or take it to a professional.

I'll be 19 end of the summer. I've moved back home.

**May 15th, 1998 - Six months ago.**

Hogwarts shuddered.

The ancient stone beneath Albus Dumbledore's feet trembled with the force of spells striking against the castle‚Äôs wards. High overhead, flashes of green and violet light painted the night sky, bleeding through the charmed ceiling of his study like distant thunder.

The old headmaster moved swiftly for his age, robes trailing behind him as he crossed to the great, intricately carved desk that had been his workspace for so many years. Papers and quills lay scattered‚Äîplans of battle, letters of encouragement, and final instructions he had hastily composed for Minerva and the others.

He spared a glance toward the window. Beyond the stained glass, the Forbidden Forest burned, flames silhouetting the ancient trees in stark relief. Hogwarts was falling, layer by magical layer, but it would not fall easily.

""Fawkes,"" he murmured gently.

The phoenix perched beside him sang softly, a note of mournful encouragement. Dumbledore‚Äôs heart ached. The castle had always felt alive, breathing and speaking through its walls, halls, and portraits. Now its pulse faltered, desperate and fading.

""It is time,"" he whispered, brushing his fingers along Fawkes's crimson feathers. ""They will need you.""

Fawkes tilted his head, intelligent eyes locking with Dumbledore‚Äôs, understanding passing silently between them. With a final, haunting note, the phoenix disappeared in a burst of flame, leaving behind only the brief warmth of his presence.

Alone now, Dumbledore approached a towering bookshelf hidden behind a tapestry embroidered with Hogwarts' four houses. He traced runes carved into the ancient wood, speaking softly in the old tongue. With a shudder, the shelf slid aside, revealing a hidden compartment glowing softly with golden wards.

Within lay rolls of parchment‚Äîmaps carefully inscribed, detailing locations of powerful relics and artifacts he had spent decades quietly locating and protecting. His life's clandestine labor now threatened ruin if these secrets fell into Voldemort‚Äôs hands.

Carefully, he withdrew one parchment after another, igniting them gently with a whispered incantation, flames consuming the knowledge quickly. He paused only when he reached the final scroll, hands trembling slightly as he unrolled it enough to glimpse the meticulous sketch. A stone obelisk surrounded by runes lay marked clearly, encircled with ancient lines of text.

His eyes lingered on it, heart heavy with the weight of its significance. This device was dangerous, too powerful to risk discovery, yet he hesitated, sensing something deeper‚Äîsomething prophetic.

""Not yet,"" he murmured quietly, rolling the scroll carefully and tucking it into his robes. ""This task requires a special hand.""

From the corridor, a distant crash echoed as another ward collapsed, sending tremors through the floor.

Quickly, he sealed the empty compartment behind layers of powerful enchantments. Anyone discovering this place after tonight would find only dust and echoes.

The final blast rocked the castle violently, cracking stone and sending dust cascading from the ceiling. Dumbledore gripped his wand tighter, feeling every one of his many years. He straightened his back, eyes glinting with grim determination.

""One last task then,"" he whispered, patting the scroll hidden safely against his chest. ""To ensure this reaches the one it‚Äôs destined for""

Turning away from the hidden vault, Albus Dumbledore stepped out into the corridor, determined to fulfill this final purpose before he faced the storm that awaited him.

**London, UK.**

Sergeant Thomas Miller walked leisurely through Whitehall on a bright October day, soaking in the rare warmth of sunlight at this time of year, the murmurs of tourists drifting around him. Officially, he was on leave‚Äîbut in these peaceful days, each moment outside the confines of the base felt like a small gift, a luxury granted by a world finally quiet after years of conflict. Still, a restlessness tugged at him, an uneasy thought about whether military life still offered him purpose in a time of calm.

He was lost in this contemplation when the sky above him fractured.

An earth-shattering thunderclap echoed violently across the city, rattling windows, shattering streetlights, and drawing startled screams from passersby. Tom instinctively crouched, eyes snapping upward just as cloaked figures astride broomsticks poured from the unnatural rift in tight, disciplined formations.  

For a heartbeat, Tom stood frozen, instincts momentarily overridden by disbelief. Arcs of emerald bolts ripped through cars, shredded storefronts, and scattered terrified civilians like leaves in a gale. The world he knew shattered in an instant.

Beside him, the tube station erupted, belching torrents of flame and debris skyward. Glass and concrete cascaded around him, raining down in slow-motion. A distant, disciplined voice within him screamed to move, fighting against the primal dread anchoring him in place.  

Three...*whatever they were*‚Ä¶were rapidly approaching down the corridor, and firing into any clear target on their approach. The street was a killbox; tightly packed storefronts left no escape.

*Shift yourself. Bloody move. LEG IT YOU FUCKING IDIOT!*

The soldier in him suddenly took hold. Years of drilled reflexes surged to life, shoving fear aside as combat instinct sharpened the chaos into tactical clarity. The thunder of his pulse steadied; adrenaline became fuel.

Tom snapped into action, seizing the young couple frozen beside him, their faces pale with shock as they stared at a massive spectral serpent rearing up from the smoke-filled street.

""Move! There, behind the bus!"" he yelled, pushing them into the nearest cover‚Äì-an overturned Routemaster, its twisted metal hull already scorched black. From beneath its steel wreckage, they watched as the three terrors rushed past overhead.

""Stay down,"" he hissed, his hand instinctively reaching for a sidearm that wasn't there. *Bloody civilian life. Years out, and still the soldier.*

The robed figures rose up and veered off, choosing another street to strafe with fire. Tom pressed himself closer to the couple, staying hidden in the wreckage. *They're moving on. Stay put. Don't be stupid.*

It felt like an eternity, but when replayed in his mind, could only have been minutes, and then it was over. The whizzing streaks of energy ceased, and monstrous glowing forms of serpents and dragons faded. One by one, the figures vanished, leaving behind the smoldering remains of what was once his home.

When they crawled out from their sanctuary under the bus, choking on the ash-filled air, Tom stood to find Whitehall unrecognizable, painted in fire and ruin. He had known war before‚ÄìBosnia had left its scars‚Äìbut it was nothing like this. There was a horrible stillness to it all. A kind of serenity almost more horrifying than the screams that had come before it.

A lot has happened since then.

Whitehall wasn't the only target‚Äìdevastation blanketed the city. Shelters sprang up in surrounding towns, while the army steamed into London to evacuate the survivors.

Shortly thereafter, a call went out across the emergency camp Tom found himself in for certain military personnel to gather, and he was dumped into a truck headed for Debden with other squaddies. It was a tiny farming village in Essex, only on the map because it had an old air base from the war. As their convoy pulled off the M11, the truck joined an endless column of military vehicles destined for the air base. When they arrived, the place was a beehive of activity. Something big was unfolding, far beyond a relocation effort.

They were directed towards a building that looked impossibly small for the endless stream of personnel being guided into it. Only once inside it did they understand; it was merely a facade, a shell of a structure enveloping a funicular lift that plunged soldiers and equipment deep underground, into the abyss of a massive subterranean complex, with urgent purpose.

The next few hours passed in a blur. They stripped out of soot-blackened civilian clothes and changed into combat fatigues. They were fed, eating quickly, and silently, eyes darting around anxiously among strangers united by shock and confusion. And then they were organized by their armored division, and shuffled into a briefing room.

Magic, they were told, was real.

It sounded impossible‚Äìabsurd, even‚Äìbut Intelligence wasn't joking. There was a parallel Earth out there, veiled by spells and sorcery. And for decades, incursions from their world had been meticulously tracked. First detected in the 60's, when radar meant to watch for Soviet missiles began picking up flying objects across the countryside. In time, the effort to learn more, and defend against it, grew into a blacksite program rivaling the Manhattan Project. The hole, it seemed, through which so many classified budgets drained.

They listened in stunned silence. It was like Intelligence had just revealed that Santa was real‚Äìand that the North Pole was an existential threat to humanity.

But the revelations didn't end there. After London, war was a foregone conclusion‚Äìa strategic counterattack had been planned, but‚Ä¶how?

That's when they dropped the second bombshell.

They'd spent decades channeling humanity's brightest minds into creating a bridge between worlds.

They called it the LookingGlass.

At the command of the Captain giving the briefing, the blast doors covering the thick glass windows opened with a heavy electric drawl. Beyond was an expanse of open floor, crowded with machinery‚Äìvehicles, aircraft, equipment, and soldiers in formation.  

Tom‚Äôs eyes scanned the columns‚Äîhe immediately recognized the Warriors, FV432s, and even the newly fielded Challenger 2‚Äôs, but he couldn‚Äôt place the odd radar-domed vehicles.

All were lined up, ready to travel through the device at the center of the chamber. Standing several stories tall, surrounded by a web of cables and conduit, stood a gateway to another world. Its rectangular frame pulsed with energy at its edges, and at the center they could make out a forested valley lashed by violent storms.

""Jesus Christ,"" mumbled the wiry man next to Tom, in a thick Cockney accent.

Wind and rain gusted into the complex, buffeting personnel clad in yellow ponchos waiving signal wands to guide the next column of an expeditionary task force into position. A klaxon blared sharply, echoing through the chamber, and the column began to move through the gateway, into the turbulent land beyond.

The Cockney soldier shifted anxiously, then leaned closer.

""Guess we're next, eh, mate?""

**Washington, DC.**

British Defense Attach√©, Brigadier Ian Wolsey sipped from a styrofoam cup. Stale American coffee was an acquired taste since his transfer to the embassy. He'd skipped his morning tea, and needed the caffeine for the intelligence shakedown that was unfolding.

Wolsey glanced around the secure DIA briefing room. He'd been in this building before, but never this deep underground.

""Brigadier Wolsey,"" began the silver-haired senior chief conducting the briefing, ""We appreciate the intel you've shared on the London attacks. It's clear we're facing something unprecedented. But there's one more thing I'd like explained."" He motioned to the analyst nearest the projector. ""Next slide.""

The slide shifted, revealing a grainy satellite image over Debden, timestamped 24 hours ago. He knew the Americans watched them‚Äìif he had enough satellites, he'd have done the same, but showing it was brazen‚Äìtypical Americans.

""Brigadier, what I can't fathom is what's going on here. We see the amassing of‚Ä¶"" He thumbed through some papers until his finger landed on a highlighted list, ""...a full British mechanized force; one Armored Brigade Combat Team at strength, two mechanized Infantry Battalions, one Aviation Detachment‚Ä¶and more,"" he finished, a third through the list.

Wolsey felt eyes in the room shift towards him. In return, he calmly met the senior chief's gaze, betraying nothing.

""Now, if I saw this exact build-up anywhere else, I'd say you were staging an invasion. But there's a problem, Brigadier‚ÄîNext slide, please.""

**Ka-chick.**

The next slide was a montage of 9-images, each timestamped 45-minutes apart‚Äìorbital intervals of the satellite. The first showed about half the force gone, and in the last, nothing remained but empty troop carriers and scattered armored transport vehicles.

""They've vanished.""

The senior chief's voice was cold, measured.

""So, what exactly are you hiding beneath Debden?""

i've (29m) met and liked this girl (29F/Diagnosed Autistic) for many years since high school but we didn't interact as much. fast forward to last year, I moved to the USA but shes still on my native country, and by the last trimester we started talking and we had this mutual spark. On december 15th I took the step and confess my feelings for her. Hooray it was mutual. We haven't started bf/gf  relationship yet but we pay respect to each other (or so do I)

Everything was goin great except for a litrle discussion over a guy postin some suspicious comments over her Facebook's post. We got to the point and made it clear that it was just a random guy. Still not trusting him.

I started noticing that some things weren't right  by mid febraury. But I thought it was certain paranoia of mine. Later on, she confessed that due to past traumas with her relationships, she got scared over not being able to control her feelings and want to take it slow. Ok took me a while to understand but ok I get it.

Fast forward to this month, some terrible things happened to her: Almost got sexually abused and lost a friend due to certain circunstances around them and her friend's cousin. Ok, I got it, you're feeling bad, you're feeling is all your fault but its not and many things that I said to console her and make her feel better.

Due to those circunstances, she went out with a friend that hadn't seen for around 5 years, she told me. But its been three fucking times and Im starting to feel uncomfortable 

First time they went for a coffee and some sushi. Next time, that next week, they went out again for some coffee.

But, this third time was yesterday and this guy insisted on take her out and go to a place with trampolins, ice skating, some dinousaur showcase and then went to have some fried chicken to dine. 

Am I overracting and that was literally a date? she insist that this guy is a good friend who hasn't shown a double intention with her (yet, imo) and they're just having a good time that I shouldn't worry.",2,1743340117.0,LDR,0,1.0,False

New here on the sub and trying to plan a trip to Costa Rica for my teen son and I.  We will be there for roughly 7-10 days (leaning towards 10) and traveling this summer (since school will be out). I initially wanted to do an all-inclusive for the on resort activities but with plans to venture out for tours to get a cultural experience but have decided against that due to every single all inclusive post here saying that's a big NO for Costa Rica lol. 

Anywho, I started my ""planning"" asking ChatGPT and Gemini to plan me a trip, but they're still not quite up to the task of doing it the right way.  What I did realize though is how much driving will take place. Does anyone have any plans or suggestions for trips that start in one airport and leave out of the other? Is that recommended?  I ask because that seems like a good way to see a lot of different areas and not have to backtrack.  I can drive, and initially planned on renting a car, but all the stories about how difficult that is have given me pause.  For that reason, I'd like to also hear any feedback on not renting a car and using various other transportation methods, the cost comparatively

The things we'd like to do: I like to take tours and classes when I visit a country the first time.  So, the coffee/chocolate experiences seem interesting (I don't see many others, but would like suggestions).  I initially was a bit scared to do zipline, but think I'll add at least one experience to the agenda.  Snorkeling, surfing lessons (for both of us) and seeing the volcano's and waterfalls seem interesting as well.  I'll have to admit, not in the best shape so I'm trying to find a balance of fun activities, but those that won't be too strenuous and leave me tapping out on day 4.  I know I'll have to do a bit of walking, but we are not seasoned hikers, so something for those of us who aren't in the best shape would be great.

Finally, I'm having a hard time figuring out WHERE to go to do various activities. It seems a lot of similar things can be done in various places. Anyone know if there is a site or interactive map that shows you where the place is to do xyz activities? 

My ideal scenario is too start activity heavy and end the trip relaxing somewhere for the last few days so I don't need a vacation from the vacation lol ",1,1743340073.0,CostaRicaTravel,2,1.0,False

The strange part? My husband never mentioned any trip to me. When I asked about it, he looked panicked for a split second before composing himself and saying it was a ""surprise work retreat"" and he'd been ""meaning to tell me.""

Something felt off. My husband of 8 years, who tells me everything down to what he ate for lunch, suddenly ""forgot"" to mention a week-long international trip? I let it slide, but started paying attention.

Over the next few weeks, I noticed him being extra secretive with his phone. Password changed. Taking calls in another room. Working ""late"" but his location showing him at a coffee shop across town. Then I found text messages from someone named ""Mike from Accounting"" with heart emojis and plans to ""finally be together without interruptions.""

Here's the kicker - there is no Mike in his accounting department. I know because I attended the holiday party last year and met everyone.

So I made a decision that I'm now questioning. I booked myself a ticket on the same flight. He didn't see me at the airport (I wore a hat and sunglasses, stayed far back). I watched him meet a woman at the gate - blonde, probably early 30s, definitely not anyone from his office. The way they kissed definitely wasn't professional.

I followed them to their resort, booked my own room three floors below theirs, and spent the first day gathering evidence - photos of them at the beach, at dinner, holding hands, kissing by the pool. Yesterday, I finally approached their table at dinner, placed all the printed photos down, and simply said, ""Surprise! Mind if I join you?""

His face went white. The woman started crying. He immediately tried damage control - ""It's not what it looks like"" and ""I can explain"" - while the entire restaurant stared.

I calmly (shocking myself) said, ""I've already contacted a divorce lawyer. Your stuff will be packed when you get home. Enjoy the rest of your vacation,"" and walked away.

Now he's blowing up my phone, alternating between apologies, accusations that I'm crazy for ""stalking"" him, and begging me to talk. His parents called saying I'm overreacting and should give him a chance to explain. My sister thinks I'm a badass, but my mom says I should have confronted him privately instead of causing a scene.

So, AITA for tracking him down and confronting them publicly? Was there a better way to handle this? I'm sitting here wondering if I went too far or if I finally stood up for myself.",2,1743339738.0,FoundandExpose,1,1.0,False
1jnbws6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetaReaders/comments/1jnbws6/in_progress_40k_urbanfantatsy_the_committe/,[In progress] [40K] [Urban/Fantatsy] The Committe,"Welcome to my post and thank you for taking the time to look. Attached is the first two Chapters, in draft form, of my Novel, an Urban/Fantasy worki, with a British setting (as thats where I live). Its about ex-soldier Mackenzie Finn, who is conscripted into a Governemt Unit known as The Comittee, made up of 8 Powerful Individuals who monitor and and deal with Occult/Supernatural/Otherworldly phenomena and employ Agents such as Finn to investigate and eliminate any threats:

Finn lent against the damp brick wall at the edge of the alleyway, looking up towards the top window across the street through the evening mist. The light from the lamppost caused an almost spectral glow as he looked for any signs of movement from the building opposite. The light from behind the curtain revealed no clues as to the occupant‚Äôs whereabouts and he took one last drag of his cigarette before flicking it into the gutter.

‚ÄúToo much like the fucking *Exorcist* for my liking‚Äù he muttered to himself as he hid in the shadows, raising the collar of his leather jacket and instinctively rubbing at the scar on his right cheek before putting his hands in his pockets to temporarily keep out the damp evening chill. This kind of weather always played havoc with his muscles and bones, the result of past injuries not fully healing.

He reached into the back pocket of his Levis, removed his phone and put it in the inside pocket of his jacket, along with his silver hip flask. He took the flask out, unscrewed the top and took a large swig of Jack Daniels before replacing the lid.

‚ÄúTime to move‚Äù he said to himself, taking once last glance up at the lit window as he returned the hip flask to the other inside pocket and leaving the alley.

This should be a routine job, similar to countless previous ones he‚Äôd carried out in the past and it was a nice little earner. The job had come his way not via the usual route, but from an old Army buddy named Scotsy who had been approached by a rich Businessman in his local pub who had heard that he may be able to put him in touch with someone who dealt with such matters - namely, his spoiled teenage daughter had decided to quit her ¬£12,000 a term private school and embark on a downward spiral of fast living and self-destruction, ultimately ending up in a serious heroin addiction.¬† This in turn had led her to prostituting herself and eventually borrowing money in order to feed her increasingly dangerous habit. Within a few months she had been caught shoplifting on numerous occasions, overdosed twice, caught all manner of STDs and had ended up in thousands of pounds worth of debt through loans taken out with a nasty little loan shark known on the street as Ratweasel, a scrawny man with rodent like features who always paid others to do his dirty work. Unable to repay the loan due to constant borrowing and extortionate rates of interest, she had become Ratweasels personal slave to be used by him in any way he saw fit until he decided that her debt had been repaid. Her father, a rather shy and humble man, had approached Scotsy in despair and with an open cheque book, pleading to have his beloved daughter saved. The Police, he told Scotsy, were not an option due to the scandal it would cause. The plan was simple - gain entry to the flat, rough up the weasel and tell him in no uncertain terms that this was all over for him. Most importantly get the girl out.

As he moved across the small cobbled street from the alley he could hear thumping music coming from the general direction of the window. He paused at the ground floor entrance door and pulled out his lock picking kit and got to work. He gained easy entry through the door, a combination of Army skills learned and the fact that Ratweasel was so arrogant he felt that he only required minimal security, believing himself to be untouchable.

Finn silently entered the dimly lit foyer and peered up the stairs. The music was louder on the inside and the distinctive smell of weed wafted down from the upper level. He climbed the stairs and reached a second door on the landing, this one slightly more secure than the lower one. Gaining entry through the second door, he entered a dirty apartment hallway. Light was coming through the open door at the end of the corridor to the right, which seemed to be where the music and weed smell were pumping out from. He could hear voices and then a sudden burst of laughter through the noise as he made his way up the hallway. A bedroom door to the left was open and as he peered through he noticed a teenage girl of about fifteen lying on her side on a filthy blood stained mattress. Her soiled clothes were ragged and torn, her mouth and hands were gagged and tears were running down her cut and bruised face. She looked up and noticed him in the doorway, her eyes widening as a look of sheer panic and fear rose on her damaged face. She tried desperately to release her hands and feet from the cable ties bonding them and gagged through the duct tape covering her mouth which suppressed her screams. A bubble of snot had formed in a nostril and more tears streamed down her face. Quinn saw track marks on her arms and noticed through her torn top a huge bite mark on her right shoulder. He raised an index finger to his lips in a ssshing gesture and silently mouthed the words ‚Äúhow many?‚Äù, whilst tipping his head in a sideways motion towards the other room. This seemed to pacify her somewhat, and she raised four digits on one of her bound hands. Finn made the OK sign and held out his hands in a palms down motion, encouraging her to stay calm. More laughter could be heard from the other room. He carried on along the corridor and neared the open doorway.

¬†‚ÄúLet‚Äôs fucking do this‚Äù, he whispered to himself.

¬†Rounding the door, he saw a stick thin man with a dirty ponytail sitting on a sofa with his back to him. A waft of smoke rose around his head as he took a huge drag of a joint. Two other men were sitting in front a TV in the corner of the room playing a shooting game on an X Box and laughing. The loud music drowned out the machine gun fire coming from the TV. The larger of the two, a bald headed, thick set man with tattoos covering his forearms, turned and punched his smaller Arabic looking colleague squarely on the shoulder.

‚ÄúOw, you fucking fuck!‚Äù he protested, as he threw his console at the larger man, which hit him on the temple and bounced off with a dull thud.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in for it now fuck face!‚Äù said baldy, who leapt up and charged at his smaller counterpart, pinning on the floor in the process.

‚ÄúWill you pair of cunts just cut it out, you‚Äôre spoiling my buzz!‚Äù complained Ratweasel from the sofa. He leant forward and flicked the ash from his spliff onto the dirt stained carpet and turned the music down to a more civil level. The nails at the end of his long, bony fingers were crusted with grime but the gold sovereign rings he wore on each hand were surprisingly spotless.

‚ÄúSorry guv‚Äù, baldy said sheepishly

‚ÄúYeah sorry boss‚Äù, said Arab boy straight after.

It was then, as baldy was climbing off of Arab that he spotted Finn in the doorway and he leapt up in a flash, grabbing for the gun tucked into the waistband of his jeans. Finn took a step forward, pulled out his Taser, aimed, and fired, hitting baldy squarely in the chest. Baldy went down shuddering and landed back on Arab and Finn heard a crack of ribs as Baldy squirmed all over him. Spitting blood, Arab was curled up holding his mid-section and clearly out of action so Finn turned his attention to Ratweasel, who by now was off of the sofa, a look of surprise on his face, a Stanley Blade in one hand. He was hopping from foot to foot and his bathrobe had come loose.

‚ÄúThe fuck you want man?!‚Äù Said Ratweasel through gritted teeth. He was clearly agitated and he looked across to his goons, who were both still rolling around in agony.

‚ÄúI think there are a few things we need to discuss,‚Äù said Finn, closing in on his quarry, ‚Äúand there‚Äôs one of two ways this is gonna pan out. And we‚Äôre gonna start with you dropping that blade.‚Äù He took another step towards Ratweasel, who instinctively took a step back. He dropped the blade, swallowed hard and held his hands palms up.

‚ÄúJust take the money get the fuck out man, it‚Äôs in the safe, I‚Äôll give you the combination.‚Äù

Finn took one final step towards Ratweasel, punched him twice in the face and grabbed the front of his robe. He threw him across the room and he hit the wall, bounced off and landed face down on the glass coffee table, shattering it. He tried to sit up, his cheek scratched and robe blooded as shards of glass pierced through it. He smeared blood away from his mouth with the back of hand.

‚ÄúNow do I have your full attention?‚Äù said Finn, standing over the shattered coffee table. Ratweasel looked up at him. He was breathing heavily and spat blood onto the carpet.

‚ÄúSo, Mr Weasel, now that I have your undivided attention, I will explain the rules. I will tell you what you are going to do henceforth, and you will agree. If I am not happy with your responses, I will fuck you up. If you disagree, try to talk your way out of it or so much as protest, I will fuck you up. In fact, give me any kind of excuse and I will fuck you up. Are we totally clear?‚Äù

Ratweasel looked up at him, a look of defiance on his face. Finn stood over him and raised a fist.

‚ÄúAre we fucking clear on that?!‚Äù he shouted, and Ratweasel cowered away.

‚ÄúI get it, I get it! Just get on with it man, take what you want and leave me the fuck alone!‚Äù He peered across to Baldy, who was now recovering. He was on one knee and breathing heavily, a look of hatred on his face as he stared at Finn. Finn turned to look him, Tasered him again and returned his attention to Ratweasel.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking the girl with me, and when she leaves, you will not attempt to find her. Is that understood?‚Äù Ratweasel nodded.

‚ÄúYou will write off her debt, and you will forget that she ever existed. I will emphasise that if you ever, I repeat ever, come after her, I will come back and I *will* bury you. Capiche?‚Äù Ratweasel nodded again.

As he turned to leave he felt the full force of a blunt object hit him across the face. He went down and was suddenly set upon by the heavy set man who proceeded to rain down blow after blow onto the dazed Finn. He recovered quickly and got to one knee, but the heavy set man continued to rain down punches on him in a frantic manner. He suddenly felt a sharp stinging pain in his neck, put his hand to the pain and felt a dart like object in his skin. As he was realising this, the world seemed to swim in and out of his vision; he lost consciousness and collapsed face down on the floor.

¬†

**2**¬†

As Finn slowly came around, he found himself sitting on a wooden chair. He looked around but could see nothing through the pitch darkness. He coughed to clear his dry throat and felt at the small sore lump on the side of his neck. He rubbed the scar on his cheek.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pleased to see that you have regained consciousness Mr Finn‚Äù, said a female voice that he did not recognise.

‚ÄúWe knew the effects of the Tranquiliser would start to wear off shortly and so we removed you from your temporary accommodation and brought you here. We tried to make you as comfortable as possible and mean you no harm. We also apologise for the method in which we extracted you but you gave us no choice.‚Äù

Finn looked in the direction of where he though the voice was coming from.

‚ÄúWho are you, and where the fuck am I?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, manners, I do apologise. Lights please!‚Äù

In front of him a row of spotlights on the ceiling lit up a large, slightly curved crown court like bench, behind which eight people sat. Apart from this, the room was in utter darkness.

Staring down at him over her spectacles was a small framed woman in her mid-sixties. Her greying hair was chin length and her raised elbow rested on the bench top. She wore a white blouse and a pearl necklace. A haze of cigarette smoke wafted across her face from the cigarette she was holding.

‚ÄúThat was quite a pickle we managed to find ourselves in back there Mr Finn, wasn‚Äôt it ? Surprisingly sloppy for one of such calibre. We were amazed that you managed to find yourself the victim of such schoolboy errors.‚Äù

‚ÄúForgot about the fourth man. Lost concentration. Who are you and why am I here? And how do you even know me? Who sent you?‚Äù

‚ÄúAll in good time Mr Finn. We know alot about you, and have been observing you for some time. In fact, we know everything there is to know about you.‚Äù She took a small drag of her cigarette, blew out the smoke and crushed it in the ashtray.

‚ÄúForgive my manners once again, would you care for one as you must be gasping? Although I‚Äôm afraid these are not your favoured Marlboro, too strong for my liking I‚Äôm afraid. We took the liberty of removing all of your personal belongings when you were brought here. Would you like tea, coffee? Something stronger perhaps?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a fag an explanation will suffice‚Äù said Finn, his eyes never leaving the bench. The older lady continued to examine him over her glasses.

‚ÄúOf course‚Äù she said, raising a hand. ‚ÄúHagar, please give Mr Finn a Cigarette and a glass of water.‚Äù An immaculately dressed man in a dark suit and tie stepped out of the darkness and approached the bench. He removed a cigarette from the packet and disappeared back into the darkness. A few moments later he appeared in front of Finn holding an ashtray which contained a lighter and a Cigarette. In the other hand held a glass of water. He gave all these items to Finn and smiled kindly. ‚ÄúSir‚Äù he said and bowed slightly, before retreating back into the darkness. Finn reckoned he must be early fifties. He was tall and looked fit, and had kind eyes. HAGAR back story

‚ÄúSo, Mr Finn, I am sure that you must have a thousand and one questions, and all will be answered in due course‚Äù said the older lady as Finn took a large gulp of water before lighting his cigarette and taking a long drag. He blew the smoke out towards the ceiling and looked across at the other people seated along the bench. He noticed six in all.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you find me? And what were you doing there in the first place?‚Äù he asked

‚ÄúAs I already mentioned, we have been watching you for some time. We have been waiting for the right opportunity to contact you and this seemed the ideal scenario in which to make our presence known. Let‚Äôs just say that you possess certain skills and abilities that our organisation desperately seek. Let me see.‚Äù She looked down and opened up a file that was lying on the bench top and started to read through it.

‚ÄúFormer Staff Sergeant Mackenzie Declan Finn, served with the 2^(nd) Battalion Parachute Regiment for 6 years between 2003 and 2009. Exemplary record of service during Operations Telic 3 in 2003 and TELIC 7 in 2005, both in Iraq. You were then attached to 16^(th) Air Assault Brigade as part of Operation HERRICK VIII in Southern Afghanistan in 2008 and injured in action, again your tour with an impeccable record that resulted in your being selected for Special Forces, serving a further four years carrying out counter-terrorism and other highly classified activities. So classified in fact, that the Unit you were attached to did not officially exist on any records. POSSIBLE PTSD.‚Äù She looked up at Finn ‚ÄúMy colleague here,‚Äù she said, indicating to the person sat on her right, ‚ÄúHas followed your military career with much interest and admiration‚Äù ‚ÄúAllow me to introduce Major General William Scott, Chief of Clandestine Engagements ¬†and main liaison to the Cabinet in Downing Street on all such matters.‚Äù The uniformed man seated to the right of her nodded to Finn in acknowledgment. ‚ÄúHe is second in the chain of command only to myself, and will take on all responsibility and decisions in my absence‚Äù. Finn stared back and crushed out his fag.

‚ÄúThe Gentleman seated next to the Major is Father Adrian Benedict.‚Äù A thin, grey haired man in a dog collar smiled benignly at Finn. ‚ÄúAs you have probably guessed, he is responsible for all matters spiritual‚Äù.

‚ÄúTo my left is Mr Gateley Ford, Chief Executive of ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶., whose main business activities are defence contracting, mining and Scientific research. Many of their activities are confidential and fall under the Official Secrets Act.‚Äù Also late fifties, three piece suit

‚ÄúTo his left is Lady Vanessa Hargreaves, acting Director of ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Merchant Bank, her families Buisness and whose Father is owner but currently bed-ridden. She is heir to the Empire‚Äù (mid forties) Finn got the immediate impression of a spoilt brat used to getting her own way. Dressed in expensive Designer Clothes (will come onto Finn)

‚ÄúOn the right of Major Scott is Doctor Amrita Kaur, who is the Head of a major Pharmaceutical organisation specialising in breakthrough Medicines for various conditions ranging from Malaria to Cancer.¬† A wide range of their current treatments are licensed to other Pharmaceutical Companies and health authorities and are widely used globally‚Äù The coffee coloured lady with a dark bob nodded and smiled. She was dressed in a Claret coloured silk blouse and gold stud earrings. She was very pretty and must have been mid-thirties.

Henrietta motioned her hand again.

‚ÄúAt the far end on the right is Alfie Swannell, the Chief of the Administrators, whos job it is to keep order. They are our security and he and his team also provide military backup and assistance when and where necessary.‚Äù Finn found himself being stared at with a look of utter contempt by an athletic looking mixed race man dressed in black military fatigues.

Henrietta motioned her hand in the Other Direction. ‚ÄúAt the far end on the left, is the Right Honorable Peter ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶, Cabinet Under-Secretary to both the Home Office and Ministry of Defence. His is a unique role, as the position does not officially exist within Governemnt and although Major Scott laises with the Cabinet in a regular basis, The Cabinet and the PM themselves feel more comfortable having one of their own, just as an observer. His memory will be wiped upon leaving the position, and his successor, whomever and whenever, will be sworn into the same positions and whose memory will also be wiped upon leaving, and so on and so forth. As I can image that you are already beginning to fathom, Secrecy is not scrimped upon. The man, in a grey pinstripe suit, had his interlaced fingers and hands on the bench top. He nodded curtly at Finn.

¬†‚ÄúAnd I am Henrietta Carmichael, the Supervisor of the organisation. Collectively we are known as The Committee, and this facility that you find now yourself in we identify as The Centre. That is all you need to know.‚Äù

She returned to the folder in front of her. ‚ÄúNever knew your parents, brought up in care. No siblings. Bit of a scally in your younger days and clearly not averse to taking risks. Some would say almost suicidal tendencies. Separated, with one daughter you have a rather strained relationship with and whose mother has lost faith in you. Since leaving the army, you have been working as, shall we say, a private ‚Äòconsultant‚Äô, carrying out rather unsavoury jobs for rather unsavoury people.‚Äù She closed the folder and looked at him. ‚ÄúExcept the last one, which was a rather noble cause‚Äù

‚ÄúIn answer to your first query, you found yourself here after Mr Swanell and his team of Administrators identified that your latest little episode had gotten you into a spot of bother. They contacted us here at The Unit and we gave the order for them to move in and have you plucked out. We do apologise for having utilised a method as crude as a Tranquiliser dart to the neck, but as Mr explained to us upon his return to the unit, time was of the essence.‚Äù

Finn looked at Mr, who snorted at him, the look of utter contempt still clearly on his face. Not my biggest fan then, thought Finn as he questioned Henrietta.

‚ÄúGimme another one of those cigarettes,‚Äù said Finn, nodding to the packet on the bench in front of her. She signalled to Hagar, who once again appeared, disappeared and reappeared at Finns side with the Cigarette. He handed it to him, lit the end, and silently removed himself. Finn sized her up in between puffs. He was starting to recover from his ordeal but his muscles ached and his scar itched.

Flicking his ash and not bothering with the ashtray, he asked ‚ÄúFor how long have I been on your radar and how comes I‚Äôve not had the slightest inclination of being monitored?‚Äù Alfie Swannell sniggered at this, drawing a disapproving look from Henrietta.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say that The Committee has at its disposal methods of surveillance that even the most highly skilled of operatives, such as yourself, could even not begin to identify, or imagine. Yet. These methods were implemented to ensure that your wellbeing was maintained at all times and that if you were, shall we say, in danger of being compromised, we would act accordingly. Ultimately, this has worked out rather well, as you find yourself here.‚Äù She waved her hand around the darkened room. She reached for another cigarette and lit it before speaking again.

‚ÄúI can understand that you may be wondering what happened to your quarry and more to the point, the girl. Rest assured Mr Finn, neither Ratweasel nor any of his cronies will be bothering anyone anytime soon. They have been ‚Äòtaken care of‚Äô‚Äù she said, her fingers making quotation marks.

‚ÄúAs for the girl, she has been safely returned to her family and will make a full recovery. Needless to say we took further steps to ensure that young Madeline won‚Äôt remember anything about how she ended back at her father‚Äôs Estate or seeing you or any of Mr‚Äôs team. She will, however, unfortunately bear the scars of the rest of her ordeal for some time.‚Äù

The members of the Committee talked amongst themselves quietly for a moment, sometimes nodding‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Henrietta addressed Finn once again.

‚ÄúFurther explanations will come in due course Mr Finn, but for the time being there are one or two urgent matters that need to be addressed. We have a proposition for you. As I have already outlined, our organisation requires rare individuals who possess exceptional talents to carry out certain duties on our behalf. Should you decide to join us, a thorough and comprehensive explanation will be given, which we cannot provide right now until we are certain we have your total commitment. ¬†You will have a more structured life and you may even be able to reconnect with your daughter and ex-wife. All your needs will be taken care of but the job does come with dangers and plenty of them. Should you decide to not take us up on our offer, your memory will be erased of you will wake up in your flat with a banging headache and no recollection of the past 48 hours. This is a one time offer and the choice is yours.‚Äù

Finn rubbed at the scar on his cheek and looked around at The Committee members all staring down at him form the Bench.

‚ÄúI want my hip flask of Jack. And my Marlboros‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù replied Henrietta, signalling Hagar into action.

‚ÄúI need time to contemplate this, and I‚Äôm still a bit pissed off that you dragged me here unwillingly.‚Äù There was no response from the Bench, just six pairs of eyes beaming down at him. Hagar appeared at his side with his hip flask and Cigarettes. He unscrewed the lid, took a huge glug of the amber liquid, returned the lid and lit a cigarette.

‚ÄúHow long do I have to decide? And what kind of work does this entail?‚Äù he said, blowing a large cloud of smoke at the ceiling.

‚ÄúYou have 24 hours from now, after which time, if you haven‚Äôt decided before, we will require your answer. In the meantime, you may return to your flat to rest and contemplate. We will be in touch.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do I contact you?‚Äù he asked, rather impatiently.

‚ÄúYou will know, Mr Finn. As for now, we are done and you are free to leave. Hagar will ensure your safe return home. Once again, please accept our most sincere apologies for the manner in which you found yourself here‚Äù With that, she lifted the folder on the Bench, pulled back her seat and rose from her place, the other five members of The Committee following suit. For a moment Finn sat alone in the darkened room until Hagar appeared.

‚ÄúIf you would like to follow me Sir,‚Äù he said, with that half bow at the waist. Finn crushed his cigarette on the bare floor, rose and followed Hagar through the darkened room and to a door in the far wall, the light coming through the frame becoming visible as her got nearer",1,1743339687.0,BetaReaders,2,1.0,False
1jnbwpg,https://i.redd.it/p1cmrwexrtre1.jpeg,Pressure at middle of the dial when back flushing (not reaching max),"Hi everyone, I‚Äôve been suing my BBE for about a couple weeks now, but recently I‚Äôve noticed that the coffee wasn‚Äôt really coming out the same way it used to. Tasted strangely. I couldn‚Äôt reach good pressure even if I‚Äôve set the grinder to the finest setting (before I was easily pulling great shots at a setting of 5-6, always use freshly roasted local beans). 

I‚Äôve looked up how to check the pressure and found a guide by breville on how to do a clear water back flush - double wall single cup basket and a cleaning disk). I‚Äôve tried this and sure enough - this is the max pressure it reached. In the video guide the pressure gauge redlined, I‚Äôm not getting anywhere near that point. 

I‚Äôve found some other post with a similar issue where everyone said it‚Äôs normal, but this seems strange considering I‚Äôm not even getting good tasting shots anymore.

1jnbwng,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jnbwng/the_importance_of_tracking_your_business_numbers/,The Importance of Tracking Your Business Numbers,"Alright, let‚Äôs dive into the numbers game that every entrepreneur, whether a seasoned pro or a fresh-faced sprout, should keep a close eye on. After all, running a business is a lot like baking a cake‚Äîif you don‚Äôt monitor the key ingredients, you might end up with something inedible (or worse, just a crumbly disaster). So, here are some key metrics every entrepreneur should have on their radar, and why they matter:

1. **Revenue Growth Rate**: This is like the heartbeat of your business. Are you thriving or just barely surviving? By tracking how quickly your revenue is increasing, you can not only celebrate the wins but also spot any trends that might need a bit of tweaking. If revenue is stagnant, it might be time to shake things up or focus on customer engagement.

2. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Imagine you‚Äôve slaved over your marketing strategy, only to find out it‚Äôs costing you an arm and a leg to land a new customer. CAC tells you what you‚Äôre spending to bring in clients. The lower it is, the healthier your business. It keeps you grounded, reminding you to seek efficient ways to attract your target audience without burning through the budget.

3. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Now that you‚Äôve got a customer, how much do you expect them to be worth over their relationship with your business? Keeping an eye on CLV helps you understand the long-term value of acquiring customers and guides your marketing and retention strategies. If CLV outweighs CAC, you‚Äôre likely sitting on a goldmine.

4. **Profit Margin**: Ah, profit‚Äîthe sweet nectar of entrepreneurship. Monitoring your profit margin allows you to see how much money you're keeping after the expenses roll in. This metric helps you figure out if your pricing strategy is sound or if you need to give that overlooked section of your budget some attention.

5. **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**: Especially vital for subscription-based businesses, MRR helps you assess your growth trajectory by showing how much predictable revenue is coming in. It‚Äôs like your business's crystal ball, letting you forecast cash flow and make informed decisions for the road ahead.

6. **Churn Rate**: This one can feel like a punch to the gut, especially when you see customers leaving. Churn rate indicates how many customers you‚Äôve lost over a period. Monitoring it gives you insights into customer satisfaction and retention and can help you develop strategies to improve your offerings.

7. **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Ever wonder how much your customers love you‚Äîor don‚Äôt? NPS measures customer loyalty and satisfaction, which are crucial for building a community around your brand. A high score suggests you‚Äôre doing something right, while a low score might just be your divine nudge to rethink your approach.

8. **Cash Flow**: Let‚Äôs be honest, cash is king‚Äîor queen! If your cash flow is tight, it can choke the life out of your business, even if your profit margin looks rosy. Keep an eye on the incoming and outgoing cash to ensure you‚Äôre never in a position where you can‚Äôt pay your bills (or that vital morning coffee).

These metrics are like compasses guiding you through the business wilderness. They provide clarity and direction, making it easier to navigate decisions that align with your vision‚Äîmuch like how God calls us to a purpose bigger than ourselves. So, as you venture forth, remember to regularly check these guiding stars. After all, knowing your numbers helps you shape your business not just for today, but for the mission ahead.

Left my work because I had to to join the army (obligatory in my country) and when I completed my service I started my residency (I'm a physician). This happened some months ago.

I picked anesthesiology which is super stressful and I knew it. I picked because I liked it.

There were days that I didn't want to go. I think the worst day was the second or the third. I couldn't eat the biscuit I usually have for breakfast. I couldn't swallow a sip of coffee. I was feeling scared. I wanted to stay under my warm blankets forever. Even breathing was a challenge (I mean it emotionally not physically). I also had a pain in my stomach (which happens to me when I get stressed).

Then something bad happened at work (my fault for being naive) and it made things worse. Everything was nightmarish. A night my bf woke me up to tell me that i was yelling in my sleep.

My bf didn't know what to do. he told me to quit if it feels so wrong and bad. I asked an old professor of mine that I really appreciate. He gave me a look and told me ""you're better than that""

And then there was an incident with a patient. I realized the emergency, called for help and knew what to do. The attending didn't care to tell me anything like good job or something. A nurse approached me and told me ""today you were the best version of yourself"". I felt way better.

The weekend was nice. I studied and went running. Somehow I feel that in the war between me and stress, I wont a battle. Could this be a sign that I'm getting better?",3,1743339658.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

After we‚Äôve known each other for 1 month he confessed his feelings to me that he really likes me,I wanted to say yes at point but decided to take my time since it is a bit early and wanted make sure we‚Äôre compatible.Actually,I wanted to be ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù first,to make sure we can share laugh,enjoy and get to know each other deeply.

However after 1,5 months from that(I still didn‚Äôt reply at this period,we were going as very good friends) all of a sudden he started being really cold to me and said he is fed up by me not responding and lost his feelings for me.

I got destroyed by that and said I am sorry,I am actually very interested in him too and explained my reason.

After hearing that he brought up another thing which is about a good male friend of mine,however with that friend we almost never see each other outside of the school.But one time when I was with him that friend called me and said if I wanna meet outside and grab some coffee.I said I will think later that day but then I called him back and said no because I wanted to stay with that guy(my crush) for longer time.And later he told me why do I even think of meeting with a guy privately outside of him if I truly liked him previously? I even introduced them together but he said he still wouldn‚Äôt meet privately with a girl.

Also one time at the most beginning of our friendship he saw a dating app in my phone,which I literally forgot it existed and deleted immediately after,and apparently it makes him uncomfortable.If we ever dated I‚Äôd of course be extra careful about it and explained myself to him.

So those things apparently made him lost feelings.After,he said that he no longer wants to be a part of my life since he thinks it won‚Äôt work.

However I still like him,it has been a week since we made this conversation.I still think about writing him back.Do I seem to have a chance? Or is it best to let go? I‚Äôd truly appreciate advicesüôèüôè",1,1743339646.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Hope you're all doing well. I know SonarQube tends to be a polarizing topic here‚ÄîI've seen my fair share of ""X vs SonarQube"" threads on this sub. I'm not exactly a SonarQube fanboy either, but in most corporate environments I've worked in, SonarQube has been the default choice‚Äîmostly because it's mature and ticks the compliance boxes.

That being said, I recently ran into a frustrating gap: there's no easy way to generate and share PDF reports from the SonarQube Community Edition. This was becoming a bit of a blocker for reporting and stakeholder communication, so I ended up building a small tool to solve that.

Redcoffee is a CLI tool written in Python that generates clean, insightful PDF reports from SonarQube analysis. I‚Äôve shared it a couple of times on r/Python and got some helpful feedback there. A few folks recommended posting here, since many of you are more hands-on with DevOps tooling and might find it more relevant.

*I've read the announcement / philosophy article several times and I've played my decks a lot so I'm fairly certain my assessment is somewhat accurate. I also understand that it's a trust issue and communicating that properly is at my end. I think I've failed in that and it's my fault and my fault only. I'm sorry. I'll try to figure it out next time.*

`--------------------------`

It feels a little odd but for most of my solid Bracket 3 decks it was a ""might as well"" situation to add more powerful cards without bumping brackets. So those Bracket 3 decks are still solidly Bracket 3 decks.

For one deck I introduced a whole new combo line I had chosen not to include before, because before Brackets it felt like a more fun way to play without the combo line. Now that the pre-game conversations revolve largely around Brackets I felt like there was no particular reason to leave it out.

For another deck I bumped my Game Changer count from 1 to 3, because, again, no reason not to. Mainly just tutors for some combo pieces. Nowadays people already know what to expect without me having to explain / go into detail about my particular card choices.

For a third deck the change was actually a bit sad because I already had cards that didn't fit into Bracket 3 meaning I had the opportunity to do whatever because it's already a Bracket 4 deck. Those cards are important to me for their flavour and theme and I wasn't ready to let them go. The deck still performs mostly like a Bracket 3 deck so it's kinda bricked because it doesn't fit into any of the Brackets properly. Sometimes I bring it out and ask about it, some are okay with me playing it in Bracket 3 pods, some are not and it's all good. When I do play it the experience is never me pub stomping the pod so I think I've got the capabilities of the deck nailed pretty well.

Overall I haven't encountered much more salt for my card choices than previously but I do have this odd feeling like the Bracket system made me play in ways that are more 'appropriate' as opposed to 'fun'.

I play to win but I don't always build to win efficiently as fast as possible. Being on theme is slightly more important to me and Brackets are sort of going against that because at times they're pretty rigid. Sometimes it goes the other way and it feels like I can add whatever power cards up to a limit without deceiving people in any way.

In general I think the Brackets system change was a good thing and for the most part I haven't had any issues with it. My games haven't changed drastically; perhaps I spend a little bit less time explaining my decks but that's about it.",0,1743338967.0,EDH,48,0.42,False

138 lbs

Hello! I've been struggling with anxiety for my whole life but the past few years it's been worst and it's at the point of ruining my life. I'm convinced it's not anxiety though and that it's something serious.

I've had many ER visits, not finding anything wrong. I've now seen two different cardiologist. My blood work is good, heart monitors come back fine, stress test was great, echo cardiogram is clean and my EKG is always the same - only showing a right bundle branch block, which every doctor has told me is fine in a healthy person. 

...And yet here I am, still convinced that there's something wrong with me. Let me explain why that is.

I don't know if it's anxiety or maybe cardiophobia or just something that was missed from the doctors. Could I be in a fib? I'm convinced that is the problem despite that never being found. 

I went from having palpitations once or twice a month to now almost every day and sometimes all day long -on and off. when I sleep and slightly move my body to a different position, I can feel my heart rate moving faster. It comes back down and then it will do it again if I move in another position. If I stand up, my heart starts to pound hard and race faster. It usually levels out within a few seconds, but if I'm thinking about it or I stress about it, my heart accelerates really fast as if I'm runnin for minutes. It's like I can literally see it pounding from my neck on both sides. I've seen my heart rate go up to almost 175 just from getting up or walking. As I start to feel any sensation, I start to feel it and it just becomes a vicious cycle of this. 

Yesterday I was out. I was walking for a few minutes and was thinking about it because I felt weird and then it started to beat so fast I couldn't even stand. I sat down, it started to slow down. I stood back up and it accelerated again. I couldn't stop feeling my heart, hoping it would just go down. I became anxious and then found myself fallen into anxiety. It lasted hours on and off. I'm tired. I'm scared. I don't know what to do. I'm now in a point in my life where I don't even want it to race or beat fast at all - so anytime it does it it sets me off. 

On top of that, I experience really bad dizziness. I don't think it's  linked with the palpitations. I think it's a separate thing. It's bad though! I feel like I'm on a ship and I have to hold onto the walls as I walk. I got an MRI of my brain and it was clean. I got my eyes checked and I did a hearing test and that was all fine. I went to a chiropractor and had him adjust me. The only thing that I didn't have him do was touch my neck because I'm really scared for him to crack it. I know many people who do it but I've heard of some being paralyzed by it online. He said he thinks the dizziness can be coming from there as I have a lot of tension in my neck.

I'm not on any medication's. No known allergies. I don't do drugs or smoke. I don't drink coffee. I barely drink much caffeine. I'm not someone who really enjoys alcohol. I go to the gym 4-5 days a week. 

Any advice because I can't live like this anymore. Anyone else experience this?

Right?

\------------------------------------

It was like a dream.

Rainbow lights surrounded me as I waved from the middle of a large stage, cheers below.  Cheers that soon changed to screams.  Gasping as smoke filled the room, I fell from the stage, my skirt ripping.  The floor shook as feet ran in different directions, the flames growing bigger and bigger.  And in all that chaos, only one thing mattered.

Reaching him.



**Light is darkened by smoky death,**

**The sky no longer blue.**

**As I stumble, I cry with my last breath,**

**‚ÄúArthur, I finally found you.‚Äù**



‚ÄúGood morning, and happy first day back, all you students out there!  You‚Äôre listening to P202, bringing you the latest music, news, and music news!‚Äù



I jumped up, my poetry notebook and pen falling to the floor.  Sunlight peeked through the blinds, the room pretty quiet save for singing birds and the music blasting from outside.  Stretching, I stood and opened my window.  It was obvious where the noise was coming from.  ‚ÄúThe town is alive with the sound of music,‚Äù I called.

The music instantly turned down as my cousin, still in her bright pink nightgown, opened her window wider.  ‚ÄúDid I wake you?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWell, morning to you, too, Auria,‚Äù I said, making her frown.  ‚ÄúI was already up.  Though I kinda wish you had instead of the burning skin that did.‚Äù

‚ÄúBurning‚Ä¶?‚Äù  Auria‚Äôs frown grew.  ‚ÄúThe fire dream again?‚Äù

‚ÄúYep,‚Äù I said with a sigh, leaning against the windowsill.  Since June, I‚Äôd been having the same nightmare.  The colorful stage, the burning room, and the likely dead guy wearing a red vest.  Great writing material, horrible way to wake up.  ‚ÄúIt was more real this time, though.  I even learn the boy‚Äôs name, I think.  Arthur.‚Äù

‚ÄúArthur?  Is that someone you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.  Maybe he‚Äôs from a show or something.‚Äù

It became awkwardly silent before Auria snapped her fingers.  ‚ÄúSpeaking of shows, they just announced the date for The Harmonia Festival on Flitter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, seriously?‚Äù  I excitedly picked up my phone and opened the Flitter app.



   **Get ready, everyone!  The next Harmonia Festival is scheduled for June 20 of next year!  Tickets go on sale Nov. 1.**

   **Singers, dancers, and bands ages 15-30, begin prepping for the preliminary on the spookiest day of the year, Oct. 31.**

   **Who will represent your city?**

   **Harmonia Festival founder, Esther Sparks, has announced that her next gala is set for March 21.  P202 will be outside conducting interviews.**



Split into three auditions plus the main event, The Harmonia Festival was the largest music festival of the northeast.  It happened every two years, meaning it would be my first time watching the preliminary live since it was held at my school.  That, along with having the ticket date already, made that morning slightly better.

And then Auria turned her music back up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my song!‚Äù I said.  Auria laughed as I danced around my room, singing along with my mom, my Aunt Brianna, and my favorite, Mira.

AKA, the greatest girl group of all time, Miracle Blossom!

‚ÄúCome on, Auria, you know the chorus!‚Äù I said, grabbing my hairbrush mic.  Laughing more, she turned the music up higher as we sang together.



*‚ÄúOne day when my heart tells me*

*To stand and pursue my dream,*

*I‚Äôll jump up!  My voice will go far,*

*And I‚Äôll shine just like the stars!‚Äù*



*Bang!*

I jumped at the sound which was followed by, ‚ÄúSerena Amira Starr, it‚Äôs way too early!  Turn that noise down!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶sorry,‚Äù I muttered, Auria looking apologetic.  She turned her music down, and I quickly looked outside to see if anyone had heard me sing.  Especially anyone from school!  Luckily, the sidewalk was bare.  I let out a sigh when Five Directions began singing from my phone.  ‚ÄúGuess we should hurry up and get dressed.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you should hurry so we‚Äôre not late on the first day again,‚Äù Auria said.

Mean.

I stuck out my tongue before turning my alarm off, sliding out my room, and going into the bathroom.  As I got ready, my dad‚Äôs oldies played through the wall.  Meaning my mom had likely already left and he was getting ready while listening to music.  Contradictory much?  Then again, he might‚Äôve been working on someone‚Äôs watch, but he usually waited for Uncle Lucas to do that, and he had likely slept through Auria‚Äôs music.



‚ÄúThe singer has left the stage.‚Äù



If only my brother had slept through mine.

Groaning, I left the bathroom, a smirk on his face as he leaned against the wall.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have class in an hour, Elijah?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI wanted to wish my baby sister luck on her first day of scary 10th Grade,‚Äù he said, squeezing my cheek.  ‚ÄúHave fun!‚Äù

I swatted his hand away, Elijah chuckling before going downstairs.  Going in my room, I threw on my favorite hoodie jacket over a black skirt.  Auria claimed I wore it too much, and the blue was a little faded, but that made it more awesome.  Brushing my curls down, I snapped my star necklace around my neck, jumped into my sneakers, and grabbed my bookbag.  I skipped down the stairs, Elijah at the bottom holding my lunch and a blueberry muffin.  Grabbing both, I stuffed them in my bag and beelined to the door.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving!‚Äù I called.

Slamming the door, I jumped off the porch to my bike, Auria already there.  Once her arms were around my waist, I kicked off the ground and made my way down Pine Road.  ‚ÄúLet the festival year begin!‚Äù I said.

Auria giggled.  ‚ÄúI wonder if anyone will make it all the way this year,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYou mean from our school?  I bet Natalie Waters will.  She should‚Äôve passed the last preliminary instead of what‚Äôs-his-name and snorefest.‚Äù  Auria giggled again.  ‚ÄúBut *Shine* wouldn‚Äôt really sound right with her.  She‚Äôs too‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want someone to sing *Shine*?  But you hate when people cover Miracle Blossom songs.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt.  I just don‚Äôt like it when they‚Äôre not performed correctly.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Right.  Then, who would perform it correctly?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm,‚Äù I hummed as I stopped at a stop sign.  ‚ÄúSomeone who‚Äôs passionate, sparkly, and fun.  The three ingredients that make up Miracle Blossom.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶You basically described yourself.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was being for real or messing with me.  ‚ÄúVery funny,‚Äù I said with a half-hearted chuckle.  ‚ÄúBesides, you‚Äôre the one with stage experience, Miss Theater.‚Äù

Auria sighed; I could almost hear her rolling her eyes.  ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not the one who knows the words to every Miracle Blossom song or has a member‚Äôs lucky necklace.‚Äù

Shrugging, I began pedaling again as my 12th birthday present from Mom bounced against my chest.  That was the day I swore to shine like the stars, just like Mira.  However, I could never be *exactly* like her or Mom or Aunt Brianna.  ‚ÄòCause if I‚Äôm being completely honest, singing and dancing before a bunch of people wasn‚Äôt fun at all.

It was freaking terrifying.

We reached a corner and turned, Pine Road merging into Main Street.  The smell of pancakes and bacon floated into my nose, the boutiques opening their curtains.  Neighbors were getting on the bus to head to work, some waving at us.  I waved back as the music of beautiful Heartsgrove filled my ears.  Dogs were barking, people were talking, and someone was crying in pain.

One of those was not like the others.

I slammed on the brakes in front of Starr Caf√©, Auria almost flying off.  ‚ÄúWhy did you do that?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúDid you hear that?‚Äù I said, looking around.

‚ÄúHear what?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat cry?  It sounds like someone‚Äôs hurt.‚Äù

Slowly getting off the bike, Auria frowned.  ‚ÄúOkay?  Since we‚Äôre here, can I stop inside for some coffee?‚Äù  I nodded as she walked into the caf√©.  Leaning my bike against the wall, I heard whimpers coming from the alley between buildings.  Obviously, that wasn‚Äôt good, so I followed the sound.  Reaching some wooden boxes, I gasped.  Behind them, dressed in dark purple and black, and with auburn hair covering one icy eye, was Natalie Waters.

In her hand was the ear of a boy.

Tears filled the boy‚Äôs eyes; he couldn‚Äôt have been much older than twelve.  After taking in the scene, I stomped forward.  ‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I shouted, Natalie flinching.  ‚ÄúLet him go!  You‚Äôre hurting him!‚Äù

Natalie looked at me blankly.  A blank stare that slowly changed to a glare, chills crawling down my spine.  Letting the boy go, she walked towards me.  I moved back before tripping over one of the boxes, falling to the ground.  Natalie came closer before taking a step back.  As if she weighed nothing, she backflipped over the alley fence and out of sight.  I would‚Äôve been impressed if I wasn‚Äôt so confused.

‚ÄúSerena?‚Äù  I glanced back, Auria walking towards me holding a coffee cup and a donut.  ‚ÄúWhat are you doing back‚Ä¶are you okay?‚Äù

Before I could answer, there was a thud, the little boy sitting on the ground rubbing his ear.  Standing, I brushed off my clothes before going over to him.  ‚ÄúHey, are you okay?‚Äù I asked, bending down.  He flinched and brushed his black bangs away to reveal teary brown eyes.  Clutched in his arm was a cartoon bunny backpack.

He may have been younger than I‚Äôd initially thought.

The boy rubbed his eyes and looked down.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay, but thank you for helping me,‚Äù he said in a small voice.

‚ÄúNo prob.‚Äù  He stood shakily and put on his backpack, wiping away any remaining tears.  Wondering if there was anything else I could do, a grumble filled the air.  I snapped my fingers, reached in my bag, and pulled out my uneaten breakfast.  ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I said, holding the muffin out to the boy.  ‚ÄúYou can have it.‚Äù  He stared at the gift before slowly taking it.  ‚ÄúActually, how about I give you a ride to school?  If you‚Äôre out at this time, you must go‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, speaking of school,‚Äù Auria said, pushing her watch into my face.

7:25.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta be kidding me!‚Äù I said.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have to‚Äî‚Äù  Before I could say more, the boy sprinted past us.  ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù  I reached out to him, but he was already gone.",1,1743338454.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

In a nutshell, yes it's absolutely worth it. Aim for 90 days as that's when things settle down. 

Previous caffeine consumption: was 2-4 double shots per day. Started from the moment I woke up, it was the first thing I did every day for years. 

Caffeine consumption now: occasionally have a bit of chocolate but not often. Very occasionally have a decaf coffee. No black or green tea.

Drink of choice: peppermint tea, also recently got onto rooibos and wondered why I didnt try it earlier, it's great! Otherwise I just drink water, plain soda water/mineral water, sometimes with a squeeze of lime if I'm feeling fancy. 

Worst symptom: fatigue. Long lasting and significant. I still nap any day I can but I think that's just how my body works. Early waking insomnia was also brutal but was over in a couple of weeks. 

Best benefits: falling asleep quickly (almost instantly) has been life changing, zero anxiety, calmer overall, I don't have to structure my days/holidays around getting coffee.

We have had our au pair now for 8 months and extended with her until Jan 2026. Her main job is to watch over our 1 and 2 year old. We also have a son (my step son) who is 14 and with us every other week. She was told up front he is not her concern or priority- maybe the occasional pick up from school and just to be around the house to make sure he isn‚Äôt getting into trouble. Over the past month some major red flags have been popping up and I want advice to make sure I‚Äôm not crazy! 

I/we are really pretty new to this and I need some advice:

We started asking our au pair to really just be in the house (working hours) while my husband had ‚Äúboys night‚Äù and I took our babies out with family to watch over 14 year old to make sure he was following rules. I came home to them playing board games - great glad they are bonding and didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with that. She got off at 8 but continued playing board games with him for another hour and a half- I thought not what I would want to do in my free time but ok- not that weird. 

The next time we had him things started to get a little more interesting. Our au pair was telling me about all the plans she had on her upcoming weekend with a new guy she is dating. Friday rolls around and her and 14 year old were enjoying iced coffees (made by her) when she should have been getting bottles ready for the babies. I was annoyed but also let it go. That evening during her time off the two of them were up eating candy together with no tv on talking and in my opinion flirting. Once again  thought it was weird since she wasn‚Äôt on the clock and they were up until 10. 

I kept waiting for her to leave all weekend to spend time with her new guy but that never happened. Saturday rolls around and she is off the entire day but home all day. Around 7pm (our babies are going to bed) her and the 14 year old walk out and I ask what‚Äôs going on- she said we are going to get coffee. He‚Äôs not my kid so I didn‚Äôt say anything (my husband had allowed it). they drive to go get coffee together.

They come home around 8 and i am busy putting our older baby down for bed. As im doing this they are making nachos in the kitchen together. After I put our baby down, I come to our living room and don‚Äôt see anyone. I realize that she and 14 year old are in our closed off basement (he‚Äôs not even allowed down there) together watching a movie. My husband dealt with it by going to see what was going on but im extremely mad and wondering if i should be. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting or what but I think this is beyond inappropriate and wondering if this at all can be salvaged and dealt with. She has been great with our babies but i think there is a clear boundry she is crossing. Advice needed.",3,1743337708.0,AuPairHostFamilyLife,1,1.0,False

It‚Äôs more than just a fretboard visualizer (though that part‚Äôs pretty flexible you can show different scales in various ways: roots, intervals, note names, etc.). There‚Äôs also a fun chord mode that highlights triads and even includes some voicings and inversions.

I‚Äôve found it really useful to start the metronome and work through a scale or specific triad voicing in time. There are also pages that dive into more general theory concepts like chord progressions and modes, though I imagine most people will spend their time on the fretboard.

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu is over a year old with an ATH of 283 million, Kendu has went through several redistribution periods and at the time of writing has had 7 green days in a row.  
Kendu is following the same path that Pepe, Shib and Doge created back when they ran to the billions. This process typically takes longer than a KOL based memecoin, but it has a much higher potential for returns. Furthermore, this method is tried and tested, all we need to do is push Kendu along that same path.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu has great distribution too, which is getting better all the time, our holders seem to grow daily even in the terrible market.  
Kendu has lots of IRL products which bridge DEFI to the real world, this is very attractive to retail investors, as IRL products show authenticity.  
Kendu is more than a memecoin, we are a BRAND.  
What makes me insanely bullish is the fact that even when many people could have lost a lot of money in the markets downturn, Kendu still pumps out IRL products. Imagine what will happen when Kendu is in the billions :0

  
**IRL Products and Events**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.

From India to Miami. Kendu is truly global

**Miami Music Week**

Miami Music Week is kicking off and Kendu is a head sponsor of this. This is absolutely massive as around 165,000 people are expected to go. StaySeaArt, NoSleep305 and Inkstradamus are leading the charge in the Miami heat :)  
Kendu Energy, Kendu Merch and cocktails made from Kendu Energy will be given out to the attendees of this event.   
NoSleep305 were behind the iconic Kendu Mural in Miami and Inkstradamus are making the Kendu Merch. Whilst StaySeaArt designed the Kendu Cocktail Menu. They will go down in Kendu history.

  
**Kendu Creator**

Kendu Creator is a website created by a chad called Akabe, where you can 3d print a Kendu mask. Whilst wearing this mask, you can play drums(like Akabe), lift weights, dance, sing.... the list goes on. This is a project to get Kendu on all forms and areas of social media, this is gonna be great, soon people will be seeing drums, people singing and running all wearing a Kendu mask. This is truly a revolutionary idea and it could make Kendu viral. We also have the Akabe mask as a filter on TikTok, so you can create a TikTok video without actually printing the mask. This gives access to the Akabe mask to everyone.  
Akabe has mentioned the discipline that Kendu creator has brought to his life, Kendu creator has gave him a lot of discipline to practice to drums daily to improve the content he can make. Akabe says Kendu creator gives people purpose and it pushes people to become a better version of themselves whilst pushing Kendu to the top. This is wonderful and it shows the Ken-Du mentality.

I cannot stress this enough, this is one of the best ideas that has came out of Kendu so far!!!

**What to look for in a Memecoin and why Kendu has that**

A community is what gives memecoins value and Kendu has arguably the best community in crypto. We are at the base of the biggest AltSeason in Crypto history, we truly have the potential to 1000x and in my opinion we can 3000x. Shib went from 22 million to 22 billion in 36 days(with far less money in the market), so why can't Kendu? It has already been proven that community is all you need, so what are you waiting for?  
Join the Telegram and check out the community even if you are not a holder. We would love to have you.  
Skip the Dominos Cheese Pizza and put the $15 into Kendu, where imo you could make $15000. This is not an opportunity you want to miss.  
All the signs were there...

I want to sincerely wish everyone good luck for the bull run, no matter whether you are in Kendu or not :)

Always remember, to never bet against a community

1jnb3vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1jnb3vq/do_i_like_low_quality_yunnan_tea_where_to_find/,Do I like 'low quality' Yunnan tea & where to find?,"I've tried many different types of loose leaf teas for China (e.g. Little Red Cup), and have never preferred them as much as my go-to Assams (from TeaBox).

But yesterday, I was at a coffee shop that was supplied by La Colombe, and tried their 'Yunnan Breakfast', and LOVED it.  It was definitely a lower quality tea leaf - some kind of very broken OP, but not a dust.

I was just curious if anyone else has had this experience (liking a 'lower quality' broken leaf vs a full leaf for Yunnan and other Chinese teas).  And if you have, where you'd suggest finding them online (La Colombe doesn't sell their tea online anymore it seems)

Anyways, my mind was quite blown by the experience and I'm curious to hear what folks have to say!",1,1743336810.0,tea,1,1.0,False
1jnb3uk,https://i.redd.it/w4k891pdjtre1.jpeg,Some people think that prayer is a waste of time.,"Let me give you my opinion. Regardless of the spiritual, psychological and mental benefits of prayer, it has many worldly benefits too (imo at least) 

Waking up early for Fajr benefited me greatly personally. After Fajr, you get at least 3 hours of distraction free time. You can focus from 5 AM to 8 AM much much more than you can focus from 5 PM to 8 PM.

From Fajr to Dhuhr, I already have something like 8 hours to do various tasks, so generally I would have finished my work early and have the rest of the day to do other things.

Prayer organizes your day and splits it into chunks. You never get bored because it was a ""looong"" day. And also you can't waste your time doing something for like 6 hours straight.

You go to sleep early because you must get up early. I coupled this with quitting coffee (because I was irresponsible and used to drink coffee in the evening). It improved my sleep and fixed my insomnia.

Ablution is also obviously beneficial and even the physical act of prayer itself is too. 

So I think that prayer is great from every aspect you can think of. And I encourage those who are religious but not practicing yet to just start praying regularly the way it was prescribed to us.

I'm amazed at how creative people have gotten in 2025!

The ""AR overlay"" pranks are taking over this year. There's a fantastic compilation of people using augmented reality to make it appear as if something absurd is happening in real time. My favorite is the office worker who made it look like their boss's car was being towed during a meeting. Watching the boss sprint out of the conference room mid-presentation only to find his car perfectly safe is comedic perfection. The look of confusion followed by the slow realization that it's April Fools Day is priceless.

The ""grocery store confusion"" GIFs are subtle but brilliant. People subtly adding random items to strangers' shopping carts when they're not looking. The woman who didn't notice until checkout that her cart somehow contained six pineapples, a plunger, and a romance novel had the most perfect double-take. Even better was the cashier's completely straight face as they rang everything up.

I'm particularly impressed with the ""hot sauce coffee"" series. The buildup is what makes these so good ‚Äì someone painstakingly empties a creamer container, fills it with hot sauce that matches the color, and then offers it to their coworker the next morning. The delayed reaction as the spice hits is magnificent. One guy actually spit his coffee all over his keyboard and then tried to play it cool like nothing happened!

The ""fake celebrity"" pranks have reached new heights this year. Getting friends or family to believe a celebrity is randomly in their neighborhood is classic, but the execution in 2025 is next level. There's an amazing GIF of a mom who was convinced that her daughter's favorite singer was doing a surprise concert at their local park. The daughter's journey from excitement to suspicion to realization is documented in perfect GIF form.

My absolute favorite has to be the ""drone delivery mishap"" series. People are setting up fake delivery drones to drop absurd packages on doorsteps ‚Äì everything from giant stuffed animals to confetti bombs. The guy who received what appeared to be a government-classified package (complete with fake warning labels) had the most amazing reaction ‚Äì a combination of fear, confusion, and morbid curiosity that spoke to the human condition.

What [GIFs](https://www.reddit.com/r/hero/comments/1jnb152/animated_april_fools_day_2025_gifsimages/) are you saving to your April Fools collection this year? Anyone planning to execute one of these tomorrow and create the next viral sensation?",1,1743336597.0,hero,0,1.0,False
