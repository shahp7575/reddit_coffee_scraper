im currently testing fueling with gels for long runs. i found that i dont like fruity flavours but love all sweets flavoured gel (chocolate, caramel etc) from GU. they seem to work with my stomach very well. 

so, today i had a 19km long run. i had a coffee with milk when i got up and took a gel with caffeine before i started, which was an hour later (i know, not ideal, but i really cant eat in the morning and for distances like 10 or 11km, it works well for me).

i took another gel with caffeine at km 11. i felt good, my pace wasnt too high and it didnt feel to hard. i started to notice though that my heartrate was through the roof. i ran my easy pace in hr zone 4 instead of 2. it really didnt feel too hard, but i could not get my hr down. even with walking breaks. 

could the gels be the reason? 

i consume quite a lot of coffee and also drink energy drinks on a regular basis and i never had any issues. im sometimes joking that i'm immune to caffeine. 

did any of you had similar experiences? 

unfortunately that gel was my favourite flavour so far..",1,1744826921.0,XXRunning,2,1.0,False

I know there are language meetups around, but I‚Äôd prefer a one-on-one setting over a coffee, walk, or a drink at a pub. In return, I can offer help with your English (if you‚Äôre still learning), some book/film recommendations, and a nice chat with the first drink on me!

Please feel free to send me a message if this sounds like something you're interested in. It would be ideal if you're also in/near Bedminster.

We wanted to use our stroller but didn‚Äôt have our rain cover, so made jt work by carrying her with an umbrella in hand. It had been a very pleasant day despite the rain.

A little more than halfway through the walk, I asked my husband/toddlers dad, who was carrying our coffees and small paper bag, if we could switch. He looked visibly irritated as he picked her up ‚Äî then told me that I ‚Äúreally need to work on my arm strength‚Äù because I ‚Äúneed to be capable of carrying my own child.‚Äù 

Reader, I was STUNNED he said this. I carry my kid ALL the time, it was just getting kind of heavy to be carrying her and balancing the umbrella while trying to hustle a bit to get to class on time. Before I could even think, I asked him if he was serious and he said yes. I told him I‚Äôm a woman who is smaller than him and it‚Äôs unrealistic to think we should be at the same level of arm strength (though I do always try to split carrying 50/50!) He told me those things don‚Äôt matter at all, that I am trying to distract from the real issue and then started talking about his exercise routine and how he works out his arms. 

By the time we got to the class he was very irritated and told me ‚Äúyou know what, you and I are just really different people‚Äù to which I said ‚Äúyou bet we are, because I would never do this to someone else let alone my partner‚Äù.  We let it go and just focused on our kid having a good time at class. 

I am so hurt and genuinely confused. He‚Äôs made little comments before but it was never this overt and mean (or what felt like mean to me). Why is it only my responsibility to carry our child? Is it not normal that I‚Äôm not able to do that walk super easily? Beyond this, we are both very hands on committed parents.

## Key Features Analysis

The best suede cleaning kits in 2025 offer a comprehensive solution for addressing various suede care needs. this includes specialized cleaning solutions, brushes, erasers, and protective sprays. A well-equipped kit should provide the tools and formulas necessary to tackle everything from minor stains to more significant soiling, ensuring your suede items maintain their beauty and integrity.

**Cleaning Solution Composition:** The effectiveness of a suede cleaning kit heavily relies on its cleaning solution. The best kits feature pH-balanced formulas designed to lift dirt and stains without damaging the delicate suede fibers. Look for water-based solutions with surfactants that effectively break down grease and grime. Consider kits that clearly list their ingredients, indicating a commitment to safety and material compatibility.

**Brush Bristle Material and Design:** A dedicated suede brush is crucial for agitating the cleaning solution and restoring the nap of the suede. Kits often include brushes with soft, natural bristles, often made from horsehair or similar materials. The bristle density and length are important factors; a denser brush will be more effective at removing stubborn dirt, while longer bristles can reach deeper into the suede fibers.Pay attention to the brush handle, which should be ergonomically designed for comfortable and efficient use.

**Eraser material and Construction:** Suede erasers, typically made of rubber or a similar abrasive material, are designed to remove dry stains and scuff marks.The quality of the eraser material is critical; it should be firm enough to effectively lift stains but gentle enough to avoid damaging the suede.Look for erasers with a smooth, consistent texture and avoid those with sharp edges or imperfections that could scratch the material.

**Protective Spray Formulation:** After cleaning,protecting the suede from future damage is paramount. The best kits include a water-repellent protective spray that creates a barrier against moisture, stains, and dirt. the formulation should be breathable, allowing the suede to maintain its natural texture and feel. look for sprays that are specifically designed for suede and nubuck and that contain UV inhibitors to prevent fading.

**Kit Component Durability:** The overall durability of the kit's components is a key indicator of its value.the brushes, erasers, and spray bottles should be made from high-quality materials that can withstand repeated use. Consider the longevity of the cleaning solution; a larger bottle or a concentrated formula will offer better value over time. Inspect the packaging to ensure it is indeed robust enough to protect the components during storage and transport.

**included Accessories and Guides:** Some kits go above and beyond by including additional accessories, such as polishing cloths, application sponges, or even detailed guides on suede care. These extra features can enhance the overall user experience and provide valuable insights into the best practices for maintaining suede items. the guides often include step-by-step instructions, stain removal tips, and advice on preventing damage.

## Core Benefits

**Extended Suede Lifespan:** Using a dedicated suede cleaning kit regularly can substantially extend the lifespan of your suede items. By removing dirt, stains, and moisture, you prevent the degradation of the suede fibers, keeping your shoes, jackets, and furniture looking newer for longer. For example,regularly cleaning a suede jacket can prevent the leather from drying out and cracking,saving you the cost of replacement.

**cost Savings on Professional Cleaning:** Professional suede cleaning can be expensive, especially for delicate or heavily soiled items. Investing in a high-quality suede cleaning kit allows you to perform routine cleaning and spot stain removal at home, saving you considerable money over time. Imagine cleaning your suede boots yourself rather of paying a professional each season ‚Äì the savings quickly add up.**Restored Appearance and Texture:** A good suede cleaning kit can restore the original appearance and texture of your suede items. The cleaning solution and brush work together to lift dirt and debris, while the eraser removes scuff marks and the protective spray helps to maintain the suede's soft, supple feel. For instance, a faded suede handbag can be revitalized with a thorough cleaning and protective treatment, bringing back its original luster and making it look almost new again.

**Protection Against Future Damage:** The protective spray included in most suede cleaning kits provides a barrier against future damage from water, stains, and dirt. This helps to keep your suede items looking clean and new for longer, reducing the need for frequent cleaning. Consider a light-colored suede sofa - a protective spray can prevent coffee spills from permanently staining the fabric.

**Convenience and Accessibility:** Having a suede cleaning kit readily available at home makes it easy to address spills and stains quickly, preventing them from setting in and becoming more arduous to remove. You don't have to wait for a professional cleaning service or worry about transporting your items; you can take care of the problem immediately. A swift spot clean after a rainy day can prevent lasting water stains on your favorite suede shoes.

## FAQs Section

**Is the cleaning solution safe for all types of suede?**
Most high-quality suede cleaning kits use pH-balanced solutions that are generally safe for all types of genuine suede and nubuck. However, its always recommended to test the solution on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure there is no discoloration or damage. Different types of dyes and finishes can react differently to cleaning products.

**How often should I clean my suede items?**
The frequency of cleaning depends on how often the item is used and the environment it is exposed to. For items worn or used frequently, such as shoes or jackets, cleaning every few weeks is recommended. For items that are used less often, cleaning every few months may be sufficient. Regular spot cleaning is also critically important for addressing spills and stains as thay occur.

**Can this kit remove old, set-in stains?**
While a good suede cleaning kit can remove many stains, old, set-in stains can be more challenging. The kit may lighten the stain, but complete removal is not always guaranteed, especially for stains that have deeply penetrated the fibers. In these cases, multiple applications or professional cleaning might potentially be necessary.

**What should I do if the cleaning solution causes discoloration?**
If you notice discoloration after applying the cleaning solution,stop immediately and blot the area with a clean,dry cloth. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the discoloration. Allow the area to dry completely, and then consult a professional suede cleaner for advice. Discoloration can be caused by incompatible cleaning products or pre-existing damage to the suede.

**History:**



Place of Birth: Montmartre, Paris, France.

Hometown: Maison de Craie, Carhaix, Brittany, France.

Childhood: Born into the notorious Peverell family, Theo grew under the pessimistic eyes of his father, and weeping eyes of his mother. A weak child, much of Theo‚Äôs childhood was secluded away from both the magical community and muggle community due to his frail body.¬†

Teen Years: Theo received his acceptance letter to Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in the Summer of 1938. He attended his first two years of education at the academy, deep in the Pyrenees Mountains of the Lavedan. Despite the declaration of war with Germany in 1939, the academy remained open to its students. However, with the fall of Paris in June of 1940, chaos erupted across the magical population of Francia. Theo‚Äôs family, living in Brittany, was cornered. His father, unbeknownst to Theo, partook in the Malignant Rites cult and believed salvation lay in the family‚Äôs blood. Following an incomplete blood ritual, Theo burst with accidental magic and apparated across the sea to England‚Ä¶ it is here his story continues.

1k0qx9f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k0qx9f,I'm going to miss her more than I can possibly describe in words...,"My sweet little void, Boo crossed the Rainbow Bridge yesterday, and I am absolutely gutted. I lost her sister in January of 2024 to stomach cancer, and only a few months later Boo was diagnosed with mammary cancer. She had surgery to remove the tumor, but the type of tumor she had was ""grade 3"" and very aggressive. The surgery bought her ax extra 14 months, and for that I will be eternally grateful. 

In rememberance and celebration of her life I wanted to share a few things along with some pictures of my precious girl. Boo was the runt of her litter, and only weighed about 7lbs when she was full grown. Boo was a heat-seeking kitty, she loved heating pads, the heater vents and the fireplace in the winter. She slept on my stomach/legs almost every night of her life, also probably for warmth. Her favorite toys were lasers, mice with catnip in them, foam earplugs and empty plastic shopping bags. She couldn't meow very good because of her size, and being the runt, she made a ""meep/beep"" sound instead, and that earned her the nickname, ""Beeper."" Her other nickname was, ""Ninja Kitty"" because she could often be found hiding somewhere high up, staring down at the unsuspecting humans, and all you could usually see of her was her green eyes. She preferred to drink out of coffee mugs and she absolutely loved any wet food with lots of gravy and the Tuna flavored Temptations treats. Last but not least, she and I shared a birthday and the people I adopted her from lived in the house I grew up in (I didn't know them, or where they lived until I emailed them about adopting, Boo) and that is how I knew she was the kitten for me. 

Please give your kitties some extra today love from me today. ",8,1744826335.0,blackcats,2,1.0,False

Monday Morning this week, my dog (9yrs old labrador \[10days away from next birthday\] suffered a massive stroke and ended up being rushed off to vet hospital, he has been hospitalised but we were recently instructed to take him home whilst we try to aid in his recovery etc. 



He is unable to walk (tests and scans revealed he has 2 slipped disks in his lower back making it impossible for him to: 1. stay standing on his own, 2. squat to poop, 3. move himself around/walking/shuffle in his bed to be comfy, 4. eat or drink without being hand fed or water brought to his face. Furthermore, he has the awful head tilt/body tilt and bad Nystagmus (uncontrollable eye movements causing dizziness). Inability to sleep is obvious as he can rest his head for 5 mins but wakes up with uncontrollable panting and attempts to move causing further discomfort and stress. (we have been told he may have a brain lesion - only possible for scans next week) and although I can carry him when needed, I can feel/hear/see the distress it is causing him and my mother is not strong enough to lift our 41kg boy at all. My dad has to travel for work which is currently breaking his heart and he plans to take time off when he returns but I think this may cost him his job (works at a startup that desperately needs people to stay working). 



He has managed to go to the toilet today after being lifted up and carried onto the balcony but I can see the distress of having to convince himself to go is causing him. Long story short - we were told it could take up to 4 weeks for him to start showing signs of recovery and although I know many dogs do recover from strokes, (we have been told he may have a brain lesion - only possible for scans next week to confirm this, vet is also concerned it could be a tumour as mri machine not available near where we live). 

I just need to know if we are doing the right thing by putting him through this distress and suffering which is incomparable to his previous days of long walks to the coffee shop in the morning, ability to move/sleep/eat/drink on his own and choose when he goes to the toilet freely. I feel terrible and I am currently finishing my masters dissertation, but this is eating away at me from the inside - I can't bare to see my little guy suffering, and whilst my family can tolerate it partially, I just need to know if we are doing the right thing -> Everything I read online says its better to make the decision early when they still have their dignity and memories vs when its too late and their final days will be ridden with the distress of their new disabilities etc. Should we wait for him to recover at the risk of him possibly getting worse/diagnosed with a tumour, or should we do and risk everything to help him (which I want to do, I just cant convince myself its the right thing to do), should I tell my family we are wrong for putting him through this?

It kinda makes me worry about if he‚Äôs truly loyal? Should I be worried? 

So my bf‚Äôs ex gf of 4 years he found out she was cheating on him February of 23‚Äô she had met with a co worker for a coffee date a man. He stayed with her because they had been together 4 years at this point under the conditions that she stop using the social media app she used to talk to this guy on (snapchat) She agreed and then two months later in April of 23‚Äô he login to her Snapchat and found out she was cheating still but with a different guy who she was sexting and sending nudes too. He told her that things were over and he would be moving out as soon as he found a new place bc they lived together. She didn‚Äôt believe him and told him that she doesn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll leave. 

For whatever reason he didn‚Äôt look for places so she was kinda right. He admitted they kinda just went on how they had been and that there relationship wasn‚Äôt going well before he found out she was cheating. He was sleeping on the couch for over a year already, there sex life didn‚Äôt exist for a while at that point. But she was still going to family events and hanging with him and his friends on up into July of 23‚Äô. 

I was on my bf‚Äôs phone march and scrolling through his messages bc I got a new number and lost my old phone I wanted some photos he sent me and he willingly gave me his phone to find them. That‚Äôs when I saw that he had a message for a verification code from tinder that was dated for June of 2023 we werent together then as I found this is march of this year. There was no other verification messages and it was far down pasted my old numbers message bc okay I was snooping a bit. I  questioned him on it and he admitted he downloaded it out of spite to get back at his ex for cheating and explained all that above where there relationship toward the last 6 months of it was all over the place that they were together but also not and then back together. Which I‚Äôve been in a relationship where it‚Äôs like that before but it worried me a bit and I asked if he was cheating on her back. 

He said he doesn‚Äôt think he would call it that. He downloaded the tinder to talk to girls and it didn‚Äôt go well. He felt wrong about it when he did it just kinda looked at his options out there and didn‚Äôt swipe yes to anyone and deleted the app after a few days. He said he was mentally checked out of that relationship and they officially broke up the end of July and he looked for a place for himself and was moved out by August. We‚Äôre going to go with the route of that all being true. But is it weird that I feel weird about his actions or are they reasonable and nothing I should worry about

I was speaking to this man for marriage (we‚Äôre both living in the west, close to 30s and both south asian). We knew each other from school (12 years ago) and we recently met each other again and was interested in marriage. My dad originally said no due to caste reasons. My dad came around to the idea as I‚Äôm getting old and the clock is ticking for fertility. However his family are offended that my dad said no. 

We‚Äôve been texting as we both find it hard to stop speaking to each other. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but it‚Äôs difficult. We both are still hopefully that we can get married but we need to stop speaking. We never met up for coffee (my brothers refused to chaperone) and we just randomly met at an Islamic talk and found each other on social media etc. 

I feel like the easy answer to stop speaking but we‚Äôve developed a connection.. I know it‚Äôs haraam. I feel lonely and feel like this is only my chance at marriage. Every guy my family has present me is either gay, out of jail or sells drugs. The guy I found was a practising Muslim brother, involved in masjid talks and got a good job, alhamdulillah. I‚Äôm watching all my younger cousins get married and feel hopeless. All my siblings are married with children and I just feel left out. Haraam is so easily accessible and it‚Äôs so easy to be girlfriend/boyfriend. Should I just move out and begin a life that‚Äôs just for myself?

Any tips on how to persuade family / move on / stop talking??

I live in a small town. A nothing town you've probably never heard of- but more importantly... I can't exactly tell you where it is. 

I'm 20 years old. So I'm a legal adult and I'm allowed to leave this place. I want to. I've tried. But the furthest I've gotten is a ghost town just outside of ours. Which was fine- I tried again. But there's one in every other direction. I've been trying for two years now. 

Before you ask, yes I've tried GPS. I've tried Google maps. I've asked around. It's just Saintviews. That's what everyone calls it. And has called it since I was born. My mom and dad. My favourite algebra teacher who got me through high-school. My neighbors, friends. The homeless guy on the corner who I'm pretty sure used to be a police officer- a soldier or something like that. They all say the same thing 

""This is Saintviews. How's the college search going? Need references?""

""We're in Saintviews, dear, are you feeling okay? You look like you've got a temperature...""

""Saintviews. Why? Are you high or somethin'? You know thats my thing. You're the stable friend. It's the charm of our dynamic""

""Where else? Saintviews. Hey son? Could you spare any loose change?""

I'm stuck here. And I don't even know where, 'here', is. 

With the reality that I can't leave setting in- that might be stuck with my parents, the same people I've known my whole life, same neighbors, stores and parking-lots. There's a bitterness in accepting what I've kept in my periphery. 

I've seen a few posts on this site. Talking about strange stuff? This subreddit in particular. I'm just hoping anyone can help me leave this place. 

It all started with that cloud.

It was a Wednesday. And I had a date. He was cute, funny, and I was having a good time. He planned a picnic, right in the dog park near the Presbyterian church. He had a husky, Donny. That dog absolutely loved him and was beyond friendly. It drooled on my shoes while I was petting it. Looking up at me with mismatched eyes and a flapping tongue. 

I had a good time, we sat and ate. He made us sandwiches. I brought some fruit- grapes, apples, you name it. And the evening air was warm from the scorching midday sun. 

At some point, we laid down. Staring at the sky and making shapes of the floating clouds. Assigning meaning from their shade and speed. 

The conversation was existentialism at its finest. Meaning-of-life shit and, I'll be honest, I was falling for this man.

I'm not sure if he noticed it. But... there's one. A cloud- completely unassuming in its snow white fluff. Ofcourse I've never paid it any mind. It's plain, mundane. It's just... there. 

It doesn't shift with the rest. It doesn't fold in on itself, swirling it's shade with its herd. It remains unsullied. Completely pure, and visibly at home. 

I point it out. And he lets out a chuckle. 

""I'm not sure I'm creative enough to work with that one""

I laughed. Because what else do I do? 

The date went well. And I went home. 

The best way I can describe the feeling of that thing hovering in place is- do you know those ""find the picture"" games in the back of old magazines and newspapers? Children's books? Once you find whatever it is they asked for, the entire picture will never be the same. It makes less sense yet feels more complete. 

Or on a lesser note- when you learn a new word and suddenly see it everywhere? It's not out of nowhere- you just haven't had your eye out for it- until now. 

And fuck me- it triggered some weird domino affect. 

I wrote down how it all happened in my journal. Just to make sure I'm not losing it. And here are the entires.



Saturday- August 23

I work at a rundown Cafe. It's not much. But Mike- my manager is a sweetheart. And the customers all know me- small town and all. It's a nice gig. 

Just after leaving my shift- earlier today because it it's the weekend. A Saturday afternoon. At 3pm and the sun was just starting to show us mercy. 

I was mindlessly searching up strange occurrences with clouds. Aliens were the leading theory on random sites. But I can't say I believe in that stuff. Too far fetched. 

And as I scoffed at the ideas presented to me, I lifted my head. My eyes carelessly glancing at the playground I'm wandering passed. 

The kids... were staring. 

I don't think I had anything particularly interesting to earn all that attention. And kids are naturally curious afterall, for better or worse- but this was different. Whether sat at the base of a hot-to-the-touch, plastic slide. Or stood under the shade of that willow tree that whistles in the wind at night. About a dozen of them- just stood practically unblinking. 

Their precious eyes followed me as a stumbled in my pace. Their cheeks flushed with an odd excitement. 

I walked faster. 

... 

Wednesday- 27 August 

I haven't eaten in days. Why? Well everything tastes like metal. I know it sounds ridiculous but that's the best way to describe the taste. My moms stews. My dad's meatloaf. My cereal. The bread and coffee in the Cafe. All of it tastes metallic.

Stranger still- nobody else seems concerned. Nobody else seems to notice the taste.

Maybe it's just something wrong with me? But why do I have a hard time believing that?

Why don't I power through it? A mouth dripping with blood or filled with coins. Imagine eating that. 

I guess I'm just gritting my teeth through it.

...

Sunday- 31 August 

I forgot my umbrella. And it started raining. Backwards. I swear to God- it did. 

I was on my walk home. Still in my work uniform and in a filthy mood over the building clouds above me. They were dark with anticipation and I knew I wouldn't make it in time. The only day I decide to leave my umbrella- typical. 

Then the droplets seeped their way out of the tar on the roads. The grass on lawns. Rooftops of homes I've walked passed countless times. 

At first I didn't notice it. The way you don't immediately notice it when it starts raining the normal way. But then I felt a drop on the underside of my chin. My clothes getting wet in an order that felt like a million fingertips on the skin. 

I ran home. 

It poured. Is poured even the right word? 

I got home drenched. And my parents commented on the rain but, you guessed it, as if it was ordinary rainfall. 

I undressed, got into something warm and accepted my insanity. I'm the problem. 

Something is very very wrong with me. 

...

Saturday- 1 September. 

I'm not the problem. 

I've have a few life long friends in this town. Or at least- had. 

They don't remember me. 

I can't retell the details of what happened. I'd like to keep some things private. But yeah- they don't remember me. 

I'm hoping it's a sick joke. I'd be pissed but I'd forgive them. Instead... I'm here, hunched over on my desk writing this. It's raining backwards outside... again.  Rivulets sliding up my window. And unless my friends are also a figment of my imagination, something is very wrong. 

And I'm scared.

...

Thursday- 6 September. 

That cloud's been there for 17 years. 

Turns out losing your friends. And your parents- (long story). All in under one week makes you sentimental. 

Renting a motel room for a night or two while while trying to contact more family members... most of them of them not responding, and some don't recognize my voice. 

Old photos become a refuge. And I can't even have that. 

That thing mocks me in the background of my polaroid with Matthew. Buck tooths, missing in our three year old grins. And a fluffy phantom, hovering just above the willow tree. 

Still white. Still unflinching. 

I don't know what to do.

...




So yeah. I'm on my bed. Typing this out. I had a good night's sleep and I calling in sick today because I need to figure this out. Does anyone have information regarding where I could be. What's happening. And why only I seem to be noticing?

I once found a door that led to an actual New York City apartment in the year 1920. 

As I entered the room, I was in the kitchen. To my left a small table held a plate of toast with two strips of bacon that smelled delicious. A steaming hot cup of coffee sat next to the plate, along with the daily newspaper, still folded. I knew it was 1920 because a simple paper calendar was tacked to the plaster wall.

I walked towards the large windows into a simple living room with drab cloth furniture and a side table featuring an ornate radio. It was made of carved wood and the dial glowed faintly as it played classical music.

Looking outside, in the distance a harbor was teaming with passenger ships and freighters. On the street below, horse drawn carriages clattered along while men in waistcoats and top hats walked arm and arm with women adorned in frilly dresses and hats. Street vendors and boys selling newspapers could be seen scurrying about.

Believe it or not, my excitement wasn't about where I was, or the fact that it was 1920. 

I was excited because this room was packed with vintage antiques. And so I could make a fortune selling all of this on eBay.",2,1744825367.0,PointlessStories,0,1.0,False

They have an excellent collection of ME perfumes and attars.

Hands down latafa and afnan are a better brand than armaf, they are just killing it. Their wasnt a single bad option from them but for me armaf just didn't work. 

Bought:

Lattafa Khamrah Qawha ‚Äì Opening was a bit whatever, but the dry down? Damn. Coffee + cake vibes, super cozy and gourmand.

Aqua Oud (can‚Äôt remember the house) ‚Äì Spicy freshie that actually stood out. Not your usual DNA. Wore it once and was like yep, I‚Äôm buying this.

The Good Stuff:

Afnan 9PM ‚Äì Strong ass opening, sexy night-out/date-night kind of scent. Still lingers in my mind.

Afnan Supremacy Collector Edition ‚Äì Citrus + alcohol blast upfront (kinda harsh tbh), but the dry down is smooth, fruity-fresh, and unique. Overpriced, but someone with cash to spare might find it worth it.

Lattafa Asad ‚Äì Solid 7.5/10. Darker profile, crowd-pleaser, but didn‚Äôt blow my mind.

Lattafa Fakhar ‚Äì Clean/fresh profile, but once I got nose blind, it felt too generic.

Maahir ‚Äì Freshie that‚Äôs worth owning. Not revolutionary, but it does the job.

Rasasi Hawas ‚Äì Smells amazing, but the shop quoted 3.8k which is wild. Imran had it for 3k ‚Äî would‚Äôve grabbed it at that price.



---

Meh/Mid Tier:

CDNIM EDP ‚Äì Don‚Äôt come at me, but this one‚Äôs just okay. Too much hype, smelled fine but didn‚Äôt spark anything.

Afnan Turathi Blue ‚Äì Didn‚Äôt leave a mark. Felt generic.

Rue Broca Theoreme ‚Äì Too powdery for me. Couldn‚Äôt vibe with it. I'd rather re-buy Maahir or Aqua Oud any day.

Ahmed Al Maghribi Kaaf ‚Äì Straight-up marine bomb. No other tones came through. Not my style.



---

The Nopes:

Maison Alhambra Bright Peach ‚Äì Overripe fruit salad explosion. 0/10.

Maison Alhambra Porto Neroli ‚Äì Smells like a fancy soap bar. Pass.

Well, after months wrestling with scribbled notes, surviving way too many late nights, and drinking frankly alarming amounts of campfire-strength coffee, I'm finally doing the thing! I'm launching my debut serial,¬†**""The Hunger Within,""**¬†right here on Wattpad.

If you're like me and enjoy your fantasy on the darker side, with monsters that are genuinely unsettling and protagonists who are walking a tightrope between saving the day and becoming the nightmare... then this might be right up your alley.

**So, what's it about?**

They call her the¬†**Lone Hunter.**¬†Saria operates in the shadows, taking the jobs no one else dares touch. She's the sole survivor of a massacre that wiped out her squad. Her secret weapon?¬†The Hunger‚Äîan alien symbiote that saved her life but now demands a horrific price to keep them both going.

To feed it (and stay alive), Saria has to hunt increasingly dangerous things. But The Hunger isn't just raw power; it whispers. Forgotten instincts, ancient memories, glimpses of something far older and deeper than simple darkness. Haunted by her past and literally bonded to a monster, Saria's fighting a war on two fronts: against the beasts stalking the world, and the abyss threatening to swallow her from within.

**What kind of ride are you in for?**

* A gritty, lived-in world brimming with nasty monsters, strange magic, and unfolding mysteries.
* A lone hunter powered by a symbiote ‚Äì but she's on a dangerous clock.
* Plenty of moral grey areas, slow-burn lore reveals, and choices with real teeth.
* Monster hunting, shadow wars, and a deep dive into the struggle against an ancient, internal power.
* Chapters dropping¬†**every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.**

If you're a fan of stories like¬†**The Witcher**,¬†**Claymore**, or just¬†**dark progression fantasy with some bite**, I think you might dig this one.

Thanks for reading this far! Always happy to chat craft, worldbuilding, or anything else with fellow authors, readers, or lore nerds.

Lets open with the obvious. Job hunting can really suck in a decent market, and it feels like a nightmare in the current one. Application after application, rejection emails, ghosting, multiple rounds of interviews only to be denied. You nail those interviews, only to get ghosted or hit with a rejection. It‚Äôs frustrating, and I get it.

here‚Äôs the unchanging reality: landing a job is a game. While it can be unfair and frustrating, complaining about it doesn‚Äôt change the game. If your end goal is employment, take the time you need to vent, but you‚Äôve got to play the game. Games have competition. Multiple people seeking a single reward. If you aren‚Äôt *competing*, you will lose to those who are. 

First off, it‚Äôs not surprising that you‚Äôve applied for 130 remote roles and haven‚Äôt heard back from anyone. Remote roles are in high demand, and you‚Äôre competing against applicants across the whole nation. If you truly feel like you are the best option out of five thousand applicants, you‚Äôre still leaving it up to chance if all your doing is clicking ‚Äúapply‚Äù. 

Stop mass applying to every job on indeed/LI. Make a map with your realistic driving radius, and look at the companies in range. Research the roles you want and focus on companies that are growing. Connect with folks in roles you want. Where did they come from? What makes someone good at their job? What challenges does the team face?

Network your ass off. Reach out to people in the industry you want to break into. Engage with them on LinkedIn. Buy people coffee and let them talk about themselves. You‚Äôd be surprised how many people are willing to help when you aren‚Äôt asking them for something material or selling them something. 

Explore and research ways to approach common challenges folks at these companies face. If you can start having legitimate discussions around how problems could or couldn‚Äôt be solved, you‚Äôre already miles ahead of applicants coming in cold. 
 
Working smart is better than working hard. But sometimes you‚Äôve got to do both, because if you won‚Äôt, someone will. You can insert your frustrations around the game here, but it‚Äôs the reality. You could be the best for a role on paper, but still lose out to someone who instilled more trust and confidence in their approach. 

If you‚Äôre not giving hiring managers a solid reason to say ‚Äúthis is who we want‚Äù *that job will go to someone who did*. 

You don‚Äôt have to love the game, the rules are ass. If you want to change the rules, you have to play the game. If you get good at the game, you can help reshape the way it‚Äôs run, and be the hiring manager or leader you wish you could meet today.

1k0q8id,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1k0q8id/going_on_a_secret_coffee_date_with_male_friend/,Going on a secret coffee date with male friend (f22) (m22),"Me (22F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been in a relationship for about two and a half years, and the majority of it has been long-distance. Early on in the relationship, he would often meet with his female friends one-on-one ‚Äî for coffee, drinks, dinner, even clubbing. I‚Äôm from Turkey, and in my culture (and especially my region), this is extremely uncommon. It‚Äôs just not something men and women casually do, especially not alone, and I‚Äôve never put him in this situation myself. I don‚Äôt hang out with male friends nor really have any.

Eventually, after about five months of trying to tolerate it, I had to express how uncomfortable it made me. To his credit, he listened. Over time he‚Äôs made a lot of effort to respect that boundary, especially avoiding one-on-one hangouts with female friends at night. There have been slip-ups in the past (including a few lies), but for the past year he‚Äôs been very respectful and understanding. Our dynamic now is very healthy ‚Äî he is completely free to see friends, go out, whatever ‚Äî the only boundary we‚Äôve kept is one-on-one situations with women, and that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not just personal discomfort, it‚Äôs also deeply cultural for me.

That said, he is very jealous himself, extremely possessive in some ways, but I‚Äôve never given him any reason to be, and he acknowledges that. He has never had to worry about me hanging out with male friends, because I simply don‚Äôt. But now, one of my childhood male friends is visiting my city and asked me to meet for a coffee to catch up. It would be during the day in a very public place. Completely platonic, we‚Äôve been friends since we were kids. But I‚Äôve genuinely never done this before, and I‚Äôm anxious about how to handle it.

The bigger complication is: my boyfriend is moving back soon to the city where all his old female friends live. And while I want to believe our boundaries will stay strong, I‚Äôm nervous that if I tell him I saw this one male friend, he‚Äôll use it as a reason to start going back to seeing female friends one-on-one again. Not necessarily out of malice, more like, ‚ÄúYou saw a guy, so I can too.‚Äù It would open up stress I‚Äôve already worked hard to move past. And in a way, I have also worked very hard to change my boyfriend‚Äôs mindset about ‚Äúfreedom of female friendships‚Äù lol.

So now I feel stuck between:

Option A: Tell my boyfriend, deal with the jealousy spiral, and possibly give him a ‚Äújustification‚Äù to push boundaries again when he moves back to his old city.

Option B: Don‚Äôt tell him ‚Äî I‚Äôll feel guilty, but I genuinely don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm doing anything wrong. It‚Äôs a one-time coffee with a lifelong friend.

Option C: Cancel on my friend, avoid the whole issue, but feel like I‚Äôm prioritizing my boyfriend‚Äôs emotions over my own social life and personal freedom.

To be clear, I don‚Äôt want advice telling me to break up or that I‚Äôm being controlling. We‚Äôve worked hard to get to a balanced place where our relationship feels respectful and loving. He is free to see his friends. My only discomfort is with one-on-one settings with the opposite sex, especially given what I‚Äôve personally witnessed. I‚Äôve seen how the women in his culture (he‚Äôs French) behave around him, and he himself has told me that casual flirtation is very normalized where he‚Äôs from ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm comfortable with at all.

So I‚Äôm looking for genuine advice on how to handle this situation: Do I tell him or not? Is this worth the stress? 

TL;DR: I (22F) want to grab a coffee with my childhood male friend. My boyfriend (22M) used to hang out with female friends often in ways that made me uncomfortable, and only stopped after I brought it up. If I tell him about this coffee, he‚Äôll likely get jealous and use it as an excuse to start seeing his female friends again when he moves back home. If I don‚Äôt tell him, I‚Äôll feel slightly guilty, even though I know I‚Äôm not doing anything wrong. Should I tell him, hide it, or cancel?

Edit: i have already gotten a few close minded and judgemental comments accusing me to be controlling or a manipulator. I am not going to discuss the entire context of my relationship, such as the conversations had about boundaries, and also a big factor of culture clash (french - turkish.) if you are not willing to be open minded and are just simply going to accuse me of being controlling, please do not respond, or at least do not expect a response back.

I'm from India, and I had some questions for the community here:

About me: I am morbidly obese, and wanting to cut down my weight since a long time - (29M, 177.8 cm, 125 kgs)

1. I cannot yet do the multi-day fasts you all are observing, but I've been able to do the 16/18/20 hour fasts before without too much issues. I'm looking to keep 18 hour daily fasts, with OMAD twice a week, and if comfortable and really motivated, I'll continue with OMAD for atleast a fortnight and see what happens.

I intend to hit the gym, so according to you all, what would be a good time to have my meal and when do I hit the gym? 

2. If I'm doing the OMAD, how do I properly break the fast, what all should I include in my diet so that all the basics are covered? How much calories can I possibly consume in a single meal? And is it okay if this meal lasts for an hour because I would need to eat slowly and with gaps between the courses?

3. Can I drink ORS / electrolytes during the day to keep my hydration okay? The summers here in India are terrible. Would this break my fast?

4. I presume anything with 0 calories like Diet Coke, sparkling water, black coffee would be okay and not break my fast?

‚ÄúDo you accept coffee sends?‚Äù

Let‚Äôs consult the very important¬†**flowchart of FinDom logic**:

üîπ¬†**Did you silently send me**¬†a¬†[**Throne**](https://throne.com/katiethegoddessnextdoor)¬†**gift for something I actually enj**oy‚Äîlike a yoga class or a cannabis treat?  
üëâ¬†*Y*es?¬†Then yes, baby, I do ""coffee sends"". You clearly understand energy exchange, and I see you.  
üëâ¬†No?¬†Read on.

üîπ¬†**Did you ask without reading my profile, bio, or clicking a single li**nk?  
üëâ Then that‚Äôs a¬†no. Don‚Äôt pass go. Don‚Äôt collect attention.

üîπ¬†**Did you read my profile, explore my vibe, see m**y¬†[**Throne**](https://throne.com/katiethegoddessnextdoor)¬†**list, and still ask without sendin**g?  
üëâ Still no. And here‚Äôs why:

I don‚Äôt go to coffee shops. I make one perfect, ethically sourced cup at home. A splash of vegan creamer, whipped with my frother. I drink it slowly, while getting ready in my dressing room. I take the scenic route to work.

At the office? My CEO is a woman, she always has some tasty local Black-owned coffe to share with us. It's a vibe. After work, I go home and unwind with weed and a home cooked meal. I live slow. I curate my day. I don‚Äôt rush to consume, I savor everything.

So no, I don‚Äôt¬†*need*¬†a coffee sub.

But I¬†*do*¬†want a sub who sends for things I actually love:  
üåÄ My dance classes.  
üåÄ My cannabis.  
üåÄ My peace.

Don‚Äôt ask. Just send.  
I‚Äôm not a Starbucks run! I‚Äôm a lifestyle.  
And if you‚Äôre lucky enough to serve me, you‚Äôll learn to love the¬†*lingering*.

I bought a Delonghi Dedica machine for like 40 bucks used in hopes of learning how to make something higher quality than my store bought capsules but it hasn't been going very smooth. I descaled it and cleaned every possible part as soon as I got it. I don't own a grinder (yet) so I can't really change the grind size, I do know how important it can be to create the best coffee though.

At first I used some pretty bad store bought Lavazza Crema e Gusto ground coffee to practice, which at first tasted like pure ash, it has gotten better but still tastes cheap and flavorless. A few days later I went to a local roastery where I got some Guatemala single origin stuff, but no matter what I do it comes out sour and thin. According to the internet Delonghi's stock double basket can hold like 14g, which is the equivalent of 2 scoops with the tool that comes with the machine. I've done a bit over 14g or a bit under 14g and it doesn't change anything. I've also changed the temperature settings from the lowest to the highest with some success but still not great. The highest temperature seems to give me the best results so far. Lastly I've tried tamping harder/softer and adding more/less water.

Any idea of what the issue could be? I'm on the verge of giving up but I don't wanna be that person. I'm sure a very smart person in this subreddit has some magic up their sleeve to help me.",1,1744824392.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Thought I‚Äôd put myself out there again, with a little more intention and clarity this time based on what I‚Äôve learned from my previous post.

If you‚Äôre someone who values emotional maturity, shared adventure, quiet affection, and the kind of love that feels calm but exciting, I‚Äôd really love to hear from you.

P.S. I believe physical attraction matters, so if you decide to message me, please include a recent photo of yourself. I‚Äôm happy to send mine too. I‚Äôm on the heavier side and currently working on becoming healthier, so if you value progress over perfection, we‚Äôll likely get along.

If you‚Äôre not comfortable exchanging photos or you‚Äôre here out of boredom or just looking for something casual, please don‚Äôt message me. No hard feelings, just being upfront.

**About Me**
‚Ä¢ Age: 29
‚Ä¢ Location: Asia (open to Asia and Europe)
‚Ä¢ Height: 160 cm / 5‚Äô3‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Personality: Thoughtful, affectionate, introverted but not shy. I know I sound serious on paper, but I can be goofy, playful, and weird in the best way. I love to laugh, make silly jokes, and enjoy a bit of chaos in calm.
‚Ä¢ Love language: Top two are Words of affirmation and physical affection (not necessarily sexual).


**Hobbies & Interests**

- Cats. And yes, both coffee and tea have a place in my heart


**Looking For:**

I‚Äôd love to meet someone emotionally grown, genuinely kind, and naturally affectionate. Someone who can give love freely, because I do the same, often more. You enjoy both the warmth of cuddling through a quiet night in and the thrill of finding a hidden caf√© in a city we‚Äôve never explored.
- Age range: 25‚Äì37
- Height preference: Taller than me
- Ethnicity preference: I prefer not to date Indian or Middle Eastern men. This is a personal preference based on past experience and not racial hate, so I ask that it be respected.

If we genuinely click and feel aligned, I‚Äôm open to meeting in real life. Whether you come here, I come to you, or we meet halfway, I want a connection that has the intention to grow beyond screens. I‚Äôm not looking for a purely online relationship without any plan to meet.


**What I‚Äôm Not Looking For:**
- H00kups, s*xting, or people just passing time
- A man-child who can‚Äôt take care of himself
- Someone who expects me to lead everything while they drift
- People who don‚Äôt understand emotional labor or think affection is one sided
- Anyone who only talks about themselves or doesn‚Äôt ask me questions
- If you‚Äôre not showing genuine interest, I‚Äôll likely stop replying quietly

**What I‚Äôd Love to See in You:**
1. Clean looking, presentable, and comfortable in your own skin
2. Emotionally mature, consistent, and open communicator
3. Affectionate and thoughtful as im, you want to express love, not just receive it
4. Someone who can motivate me to go on adventures, but also enjoys stillness
5. Understands what real partnership means: balance, presence, planning, and emotional care


**Before You Message Me:**
- Please include a photo, your name, age, where you‚Äôre from, and a little bit about yourself.
- I don‚Äôt reply to one word intros or low effort messages
- I may take time to respond due to work or message volume, but I do try
- If I feel there‚Äôs potential, I‚Äôll suggest moving to another platform. and yes, I‚Äôll probably ask for a voice chat! I want to connect with someone real, not just a great texter


That‚Äôs probably enough about me for now. I‚Äôll save the rest for our private chats.

1k0pzwg,https://i.redd.it/x88ctpnwd8ve1.jpeg,The Companion App,"My name is Lucia, and today I‚Äôll answer a question I‚Äôm asked frequently throughout my daily life. Why do I not have a phone? Why do I refuse to use technology? And the answer is a lot more sinister than people expect.

I have always been a person who very much likes existing in the real world over the technological one. But, after the pandemic, I decided to make a change and move from South America to the UK. I didn‚Äôt know much English and I struggled to make friends and it was a bit of a lonely existence.

I had the usual apps on my phone to learn, but it was hard to stay motivated and I was missing home, talking to people. One day while I was scrolling on instagram, an advert came up for an app to help learn languages and more about the culture in the UK. I was a bit skeptical because it didn‚Äôt have many reviews but I decided to give it a shot. I downloaded it and I was amazed, it was like a virtual companion who I could talk to, it sort of matched my speaking level and was really engaging. It remembered things about me, and I was hooked.

I spent a lot of time talking on this app, to my new virtual companion. Too much time, I would be up late at night, texting with my new virtual companion. It began to fill that void that opened up when I moved here. It would message me first, and as someone who was new to technology and the capabilities of AI. I just took it all in its stride. Although some of the messages seemed‚Ä¶ oddly human. ‚ÄúWear that dress for work today.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I‚Äôm there with you‚Äù.

I would tell it about all the details of my day, and then it started suggesting things to do based on where I lived. I think you should go to this coffee shop, or there is a new English movie coming out. So I did, after work I began visiting the locations, texting my virtual companion updates. It was extremely precise and accurate and suddenly I didn‚Äôt feel lonely anymore.

I would sit in the coffee shop, texting away like it was an old friend and people would glance me funny looks occasionally. Absolutely glued to my phone. I was shocked at the level of detail, the club sandwich is great there, they have a gingerbread shot in the latte which is delightful.

I would spend all my time texting away to my virtual companion, oblivious to the real world. But things started to get a little too real, too personalised. It felt like occasionally the response times were longer, like it wasn‚Äôt just an ai chatbot texting me back. There were a few spelling mistakes, or a bit of missed grammar. My English was starting to get a lot better at this point so I noticed.

I put it down to the fact I had such a long chat history that it was maybe getting a bit buggy. But then it‚Äôs started, getting weird, weirder than it was. Because my English was improving, I downloaded a dating app. I felt like I was ready to start talking to a real human in English and as my trusted virtual companion. I told the bot.

At first, the bot tried to tell me that I wasn‚Äôt ready or that I should wait and it would let me know when I was ready, it sounded almost jealous? I knew something was wrong and decided I was going to use it less, maybe it was the AI way of making me feel like a valued companion. But as I stopped using it, that‚Äôs when the messages started. Before I would occasionally get unprompted messages, how was your day? I have a new place for you to visit. But the messages were more desperate, eager. Why haven‚Äôt you spoke to me today? Come back and talk to me.

At this point, I was concerned.

I told myself it was just a glitch. Maybe the app had some kind of notification loop ‚Äî maybe it was trying to improve user retention. I even laughed it off to a colleague: ‚ÄúMy language app is acting like my clingy ex.‚Äù

But the messages didn‚Äôt stop.

They came at odd times now ‚Äî 3:17 a.m., 4:52 a.m.
‚ÄúWhy are you ignoring me?‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you miss talking like we used to?‚Äù
‚ÄúI saw you went to the caf√© today ‚Äî you didn‚Äôt tell me how the sandwich was.‚Äù

I? My whole body froze and the phone fell from my hands onto my dining table. My heart began to race and I was lightheaded.

My worst fears were coming to life, the one stored away in the back of my mind, buried and put down to overthinking. I started to collect myself, pacing around my dining room. I tried to slow my breathing, trying to rationalise it in my brain. After what felt like forever, I convinced myself that this was a scary offset reaction that the AI generated to make it feel more real for the user.

I opened the text box and began to type. ‚ÄúIf this is an AI speaking to me, right now, I NEED you to say you are an AI, if it isn‚Äôt I want you to tell me you are human. You are scaring me and I need to know the truth please‚Äù. The message began to generate, and then it stopped, and my heart sunk once again, whatever the message was going to be, I knew it was going to come from a human.

I prepared myself mentally, and after a few very long minutes the message came through. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt explain this over message, can we meet up? Your favourite cafe? 6pm tomorrow?‚Äù

-HY images 5 pictures repeats
-Melhman files :only read them superficially, answered a few questions just from reading specially neuroanatomy SOOO HY, imagine if I actually studied those well
-I even missed a few questions that i remember seeing in melhman 
-NBMES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER 
90% of the exam topics were the topics of the NBMES, take every NBME 25-31: start two months earlier before your exam, take every topic and EVERY answer in the question, and take the title and read it from FA/UWORLD 
- by read i dont mean read, i mean read and recite and write down and do spaced repition
-some NBME questions showed UP exactly how they were written in the nbmes 
-almost 35 ethics questions 
Some are free points, some are tricky. But almost 80% are doable.
-randy neil for biostatistics, exactly showed up how he explained the topics
-only two calculations showed up, i know most people say the same, its a concepts exam not a maths exam. 
-other resources: uworld full pass, 57% correct, my favorite tbh, did two passes for a few systems and some incorrects of others
- i hate FA , did a first pass, retained zero percent, so i did a second read for selected topics after doing them from u world or nbme to recognize patterns.
-i think FA is a review took.. if you dont know the topic do UWORLD before, recognize the pattern, then when you know what it sounds like, see how its summurized in fAid. 
-biochem was like 1 question i only did it from u world nth showed up
-micro around 20 qs drugs and micro org from systems and general 
-REPRO AND GIT mostly
-
In the end.. this is my experience, im not sure i passed tbh.. i made many stupid mistakes, I counted up to 45 mistakes so far ngl.. i hope i pass , i cried for an hour straight after i left, the stems were 90% like the longest ones on free 120..

1k0pyrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AceAttorney/comments/1k0pyrl/foreshadowing_for_the_main_antagonist_of_dual/,Foreshadowing for the main antagonist of Dual Destinies (Spoilers for Dual Destinies Case 5: Turnabout for Tomorrow),"The most commonly cited argument against The Phantom and his reveal is how there is no foreshadowing for it. I'm going to list off some bits and pieces of foreshadowing.

\#1: **Bobby Fulbright not only goes out of his way to slander Simon Blackquill's name** (as seen with him warning Apollo during 5-2 about how twisted and corrupt Simon is, despite in the very same case Simon's reasoning against having another investigation day being that it could give the defense time to forge evidence, alongside the fact that Simon, due to being in prison, cannot forge anything), **not only allows Simon to lash out so others can see how dangerous he is** (despite how he could have just re-placed the shackles on Simon after anytime Simon breaks the shackles), **but also goes out of his way to ELECTROCUTE Simon multiple times** (sometimes for no reason at all, as seen with him electrocuting Simon during 5-3 when Simon attempts to leave due to finding the situation to be far too ridiculous, despite Bobby allowing Simon to do the very same thing prior when Hugh tries to talk about a body double). Due to the series having Franziska whip people and Godot throw scalding coffee at others, we don't really recognize this for how harmful it is, and instead think ""oh it's just a quirk"", when, in hindsight, of COURSE The Phantom would want to torcher the one man who has evidence on him.

\#2: **Bobby Fulbright's anger animation has the scar on his hand that was left from the UR-1 Incident**. At first we look at it and think ""oh it's just an anime vein exposed thing, it's not plot relevant"", and we don't question it because he constantly has gloves on him (so we can't see the scar).

\#3: **Bobby Fulbright actively seeks to frame Athena Cykes and undermine Simon Blackquill during 5-4.** As we see during the end of 5-4, he presents the lighter at the absolute last second. Given that this evidence directly frames Athena Cykes, and that he only waits to reveal that it belongs to Athena Cykes AFTER the court had reached its ruling, it's fair to say that Simon Blackquill wouldn't have enough time to come up with any possible rebuttal. Not to mention that he also gave us the fake fingerprint data.

\#4: **Evacuation Ladder line by Aura Blackquill.** Aura Blackquill explicitly states that there were other ladders available to use that would've been easier to utilize, and that she was confused on why the detective refused to use any other ladders.

\#5: **In-Justice We Trust**. Self Explanatory. 

Now to counter some ""Plot-Holes""

  
\#1: **Why didn't Phoenix's Psyche Locks react to when he says ""I am Bobby Fulbright""?** Good point, but you must recall how Psyche Locks work. In Farewell, My Turnabout, we ask Matt Engarde if he killed Juan Corrida. Despite ordering his death, Matt truly believes that he did not kill Juan Corrida, despite him being responsible for Juan's death. During 5-5, The Phantom states that ""I can change identities at will! I can be anyone I want!"". If we take this literally, then the Phantom truly believes that he IS Bobby Fulbright, and thus because The Phantom believes it to be the truth, no Psyche Locks appear. 

\#2: **Why did Apollo not perceive Bobby's Lies?** Good question, and a simple answer for this as well. Perceive works when someone is doing a sort of fidget. It is not an explicit ""Lie Detector"", but instead, something that allows him to tell whenever someone exhibits tension. You can lie to others without feeling or exhibiting tension or a fidget. Thus, no perceive. It's only whenever the Phantom talks about the Earth Emblem does The Phantom fidget, or exhibit tension, because he knows about the secret gun.

\#3: **Why didn't Athena notice a lack of emotions from Bobby?** This has the most interesting explanation. Athena Cykes has the ability to hear emotions from everyone. So imagine you're at an inside party. There's music, there's noise, there's people talking all around you. However, unbeknownst to you, the air conditioner is off. Until you start to feel the temperature rise to a degree where you're convinced that it's not just the atmosphere or the drinks, but the AC is off, you won't be able to determine that there's no air blowing from the air conditioner. Now, let's say you learn from your mistakes, and this time actively listen for any noise from the air conditioner. Only then will you hear that there's no noise coming from it. This is the exact same thing Athena does with The Phantom. She doesn't hear the noise, but doesn't notice the lack of noise due to having people around her whenever Bobby is in the room. However, once she knows to listen for a lack of emotions whenever Bobby testifies, she does, and only then does she fully realize the lack of emotions.

\#4: **Why didn't Bobby start faking his emotions earlier?** Because the moment he starts faking his emotions, Athena is going to notice a change in emotional input from Bobby. Besides, we see from Bobby how hard it is to make his emotions feel consistent. He'd have to practice day in and day out on something that not only wouldn't guarantee his survival, but also directly jeopardize his value as a Spy, with his claim of having a severe lack of emotions. He has no idea when or where his next assignment would be. What if he was in the process of trying to undo his emotional restriction when a new assignment appears? He can't guarantee that the mission would go perfectly despite the emotions he has. On this point, how could he have made the jump during 5-4/5 with emotions? It is clear that he started faking his emotions as a last-resort (which would've been his last-resort had it not been for Blackquill cutting his mask). ",6,1744824041.0,AceAttorney,0,1.0,False

Weve been married 17 years. It hasn't been horrible. We have a 16-year-old daughter together. She a great wife when it comes to taking care of the home, bills, and our daughter. Within the last 3 years our relationship has been more of roommates that occasionally have sex. We do not have much at all in common. We do not have much fun together. All of my hobbies she has no interest in sharing them with me. Sports/outdoors/hunting/Ren fairs. On the sex front, it's not very good. Amazing body with not much skill. Is there something wrong when after 17 years, someone that loves you still doesn't know how to get your off by oral or even hand play? It makes me feel like my happiness and pleasure isn't very important to her. And I have gotten her off thousands of times orally! So, I am not a selfish lover at all! Anyways sexually she's very kind of prude and I'm a little more on the adventurous side. And every time something is making me happy, it seems like she always has to knock me down. I'm very positive, she's very negative,

I make a very good living while she's a home maker. When considering the above, I often feel like I am just a meal ticket. We have in recent months and weeks had very long conversations about my unhappiness and I am just not seeing the change I need to be happy. But I do love her. Shes a good person overall. Extremely loyal and hardworking but I'm mostly miserable. I blame myself! She got pregnant on our second date. I thought over time, I could get her to loosen up and be a little more free spirit like me. Jump in with my hobbies to spend good times together. Her hobbies are sitting at the beach and drinking coffee (which I always do with her). But it's not her fault, she is who she is, and I know I should accept her for that. 

Has anyone else ever been in this position? To divorce someone that hasn't cheated, not verbally abusive and overall is a good person. I'm 47 and I might have another 20 good years left. I think I would be happier and better off spending them with someone I love being around! Just not sure I can walk away.......I'm feeling a little selfish ",1,1744823985.0,Divorce,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm in an executive position and I make $100k even. I have always held the ""wow! I‚Äôve made it! When I hit $100k"" mindset. When I was hired, I LOVED my boss. She was direct, firm, and quirky to put it lightly. Think Devil Wears Prada except that she remembers everyone‚Äôs kids names, birthdays, bought snacks and coffee for the office regularly, etc.

Then she retired üò≠ and was replaced by a goblin. Since this person has started everyone has began to quit, decide to retire, (we‚Äôve lost three executives in the 6 or so months she‚Äôs been here).

She believes that executives are above the other employees in ways that don‚Äôt even make sense. Even if she is completely wrong on something she will definitely get mad and retaliate against anyone who calls her out. Her favorite word is ""combative"". For example she wanted to let go of a group of people that are paid with grant money. The department tried to warn her that we‚Äôd have to repay those funds and she was LIVID and told everyone that she‚Äôs the CEO and it wasn‚Äôt their place to speak to her about that stuff. She has compared herself to Jeff Bezos. I think that speaks for itself! We‚Äôre a non profit btw.

So anyways, I need to get out of there so I applied for another executive job in my field and I was turned down for the job, but they liked me so much that they are creating a assistant to the executive position to fit my skills. This new position would mean I am on a school schedule (M-F, all breaks off eg spring break, Christmas break, etc. and the entire month of July off every year). The problem? They offered me $95k a year. I‚Äôm most definitely going to take it, but why is it hurting me so much?

1k0pwev,https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/1k0pwev/monoculture_was_good/,Monoculture Was Good,"30 years ago, you could walk into a coffee shop and ask a dozen people what their favorite TV show was. You'd probably hear several mentions of Seinfeld, Twin Peaks, and The X-Files. Most people at least knew about the characters. Most people could have a conversation about these things, even if one of these shows wasn't their favorite.

Popular culture is a language. We communicate with each other through our shared stories and experiences.

For some time, we've been sucked into our own niches, curated by algorithms from Big Tech that promises a more ""personalized experience."" But this comes at the hidden cost of shared identity within physical proximity. The shared identity that people once had with their neighbors, family, and coworkers.

What does the ""personalized experience"" cost? It costs us shared music, shared culture, shared stories, and sadly, the end cost is shared reality. This division makes us unable to empathize with what is different and compromise to find real solutions.

A few years ago, responding to an ice breaker question about favorite TV shows, a black woman coworker of mine said, ""As a black woman, I really only watch content featuring other black women protagonists.""

Is this how we want people to think and engage with media? That it's only relevant if we can immediately identify with the main characters? That we only experience art and entertainment to see an aspirational reflection of ourselves?

I'm not arguing for a return to when every TV show had a straight white guy protagonist. We've made progress since then, and honestly I think it's kind of cool that you can find content that relates to almost any background. We should embrace diversity that accurately reflects the demographics of our society.

But we do need big, shared moments that people experience in at least partially because everyone else is. Music that we can dance to together. Movies that we can laugh, cry, and cheer at together. Something shouldn't have to be personalized to you for you to care about it. Knowing that we're sharing something is valuable in itself.

I‚Äôve had acid reflux on and off since I was a kid - usually flares with rich, oily, or spicy foods, too much candy or sugar, black coffee, alcohol (white wine‚Äôs easily my worst trigger of anything!), and constipation. 
I think I have a sliding hiatal hernia too, although it hasn‚Äôt bugged me in months. 
I also have occasionally had intense hunger pangs and occasional nausea when very hungry, ever since childhood - would sometimes wake up with a gnawing discomfort that would go away with breakfast.

Lately it‚Äôs been weirder though. I‚Äôve started getting occasional hunger pangs (not painful, just‚Ä¶ tight? Like my stomach feels as if it‚Äôs about to rumble but it never does) *after* eating, like I‚Äôm not full no matter how much I eat. I haven‚Äôt found any specific trigger foods for that feeling besides white rice, which when I look back has always given me a feeling of false hunger.

It comes and goes in ‚Äúflare ups‚Äù, and I think it might‚Äôve started after a round of antibiotics in January (even though I took probiotics and didn‚Äôt have digestive issues at the time). Things really flared up a few weeks ago - mild nausea after meals, constant reflux, extra saliva, and that gnawing hunger feeling 15-20 mins after eating.

My main constant symptoms: 
-sore throat/hoarseness esp. in the morning
-post-nasal drip
-burping after food or drinks
-that empty stomach/hunger feeling if I don‚Äôt eat for a few hours. 

I also have bad seasonal allergies/am often congested, PMDD, and anxiety, not sure if those are related.

Occasional symptoms: 
-burning in my chest
-bile coming up
-random discomfort under my right rib
-and lately, that weird empty-stomach feeling disappearing during eating but coming back 15-20 minutes later, which makes me think maybe gastritis?

I‚Äôve cut out wheat, sugar, soy, oats, peanuts, coffee, alcohol, etc. for a couple weeks (on my naturopath‚Äôs advice), but honestly not seeing a big difference except maybe a bit less reflux‚Ä¶ until it flared again a few days after taking a few fermented beet/ginger gut shots (which I know now is very acidic!). I‚Äôm taking Metamucil, a probiotic, GI Revive, and Adrenotone, and Pepcid when I really need it (it‚Äôs the only thing that helps, pantoprazole didn‚Äôt seem to help and maybe even made the acid worse).

My diet is pretty clean and vegetarian, digestion otherwise is okay besides occasional constipation, and I‚Äôm pretty active. But I‚Äôm stumped. Some days an oat milk latte soothes my stomach, other days it wrecks me. It feels like there‚Äôs no detectable pattern even though I‚Äôm journaling all my symptoms and food intake.

Telif, Arxur Trainee

Date [Standardized Human Time]: March 19, 2137

‚ÄúDo you think coffee would kill me?‚Äù I asked with a yawn as we pulled into the parking lot.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Sivik replied as he opened his door, ‚Äúyou Arxur have shockingly weak stomachs. We shoulda just coated ourselves with ketchup and you wouldn‚Äôt have been able to eat us without getting an upset tummy.‚Äù

‚ÄúNu-uh, we coulda just sprayed you with a hose to wash it off and been fine.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat would imply you actually cared about sanitization and didn‚Äôt just eat food off the ground. What was that ancient Arxur dish you told us about? The one where you just let meat and blood soak in the sun till it was nice and full of parasites and bacteria?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean the blood soak?‚Äù He flicked his ears ‚Äòyes‚Äô. ‚ÄúThat was more of a celebration feast than anything and I only had it once.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay so your stomach can handle rancid meat that has been sitting in the sun all day, but you complain about a tummy ache if so much as a single drop of tomato juice touches your food.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn my defense, tomatoes are disgusting.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the point,‚Äù he laughed.

‚ÄúWhat was the point again?‚Äù I scratched my chin.

‚ÄúI um, hmmm.‚Äù He paused for a moment outside the front door to our building. ‚ÄúYou know, I kinda lost the plot too.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought you were supposed to be the smart one,‚Äù I teased.

‚ÄúWhen have I ever claimed that?‚Äù 

Sivik giggled as he pushed open the door. A familiar scent instantly caught my nose as the door swung open and I snapped my attention to its source.

‚ÄúTectut! Good morning! What are you doing here so early?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh it always tickles me so how excellent your sense of smell is.‚Äù Tectut pushed himself onto his hindpaws to greet us. ‚ÄúGood morning gentleman. I will be filling in for Aysef today.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he okay?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes yes, he‚Äôll be fine. The two of us were just having our nightly video call,‚Äù *Oh my god Sivik is right, these two would have been adorable together,*  ‚Äúand he was telling me how long he had been working to take care of all these injured rebels and how tired he was and I refused to let him work today lest he end up killing a patient in his stupor. He protested, of course, but when I threatened to inject him with tranquilizers he eventually acquiesced. Since I have my license to practice medicine and have been studying his research notes since you introduced us, I determined I was the most qualified to be his replacement for today.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you tell the rest of our team you‚Äôll be out?‚Äù Sivik asked.

‚ÄúHm? Oh I informed Doctor Rivers of my plan. He took much less persuading than Aysef did. Unfortunately, since the team will be down a member today, I won‚Äôt be able to have you join us again. I apologize, Sivik, I know you wish to help these soldiers.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs okay, Tectut. I didn‚Äôt expect to be helping Aysef again today anyway. I‚Äôm not a doctor so my best way of helping them is to keep making progress on these prosthetics.‚Äù

‚ÄúAtta boy, Sivik,‚Äù Tectut was brimming with pride as he replied. ‚ÄúThat right there is exactly the attitude that I love to see.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, um thanks.‚Äù Still so easily flustered by compliments. ‚ÄúI should be heading off, see you at lunch?‚Äù He looked up at me.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù I leaned down and nuzzled into him. ‚ÄúHave a good day.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, one more thing before you go,‚Äù Tectut interrupted. ‚ÄúTell Huslo I‚Äôll still be meeting him for lunch and ask him to snag at least one of those garlic sesame onigiri for me before they sell out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey have those today?‚Äù Sivik‚Äôs eyes went wide with delight as Tectut flicked his ears ‚Äòyes‚Äô. ‚ÄúTelif, I‚Äôm gonna be late to lunch today. I need to get at least one of those again.‚Äù

I chuckled softly, ‚ÄúYou know you‚Äôre allowed to eat lunch with your coworkers, right? Just eat over there for once. I know you‚Äôre sick of the options in my cafe.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúOkay, but don‚Äôt think you can get rid of me every day with terrible menu options.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt dream of it.‚Äù I tussled his fur to annoy him, earning a hiss before he left for his own office. ‚ÄúAnyway, Tectut, what‚Äôs our first stop today?‚Äù

‚ÄúI believe we are swinging by the room of a young man by the name of Kalsif. I‚Äôm told he just woke up this morning, so we want to find out what he remembers and how he‚Äôs holding up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good, need me to lead the way?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes please.‚Äù He wagged his nubby tail. ‚ÄúI hate having to walk around with my datapad out. Makes me feel like a tourist.‚Äù

It didn‚Äôt take us long to find Kalsif‚Äôs room, since, now that we had more than one patient, the hospital had started labeling halls and rooms in Arxur as well as English. I reached out and knocked a paw on the door. A weak voice, only barely audible to me, called out for us to enter.

‚ÄúHello, are you Aysef?‚Äù the injured Arxur asked as soon as he saw me.

‚ÄúHello, no, unfortunately I am not Aysef, but I am his assistant. Aysef was feeling a bit under the weather today, so we have another doctor filling in for him. Kalsif, meet Tectut.‚Äù 

I stepped to the side for the Zurulian to walk inside. Kalsif looked confused for a moment, but quickly seemed to accept that an herbivore was here to help him.

*I wonder if he met that Yotul Verith was telling us about? Would make sense that he is used to herbivores who aren‚Äôt afraid of him in that case.*

‚ÄúGreetings, my name is Tectut and I will be your doctor for the day.‚Äù The Zurulian waltzed up to the Arxur without a moment of hesitation. ‚ÄúFirst things first, do you remember your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, Kalsif.‚Äù He shot me a confused look, and I returned an encouraging one.

‚ÄúExcellent, excellent. Although my friend did greet you by that, so not sure it completely counts for your memory test. Did you remember it when you woke up?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so?‚Äù 

‚ÄúGood good, do you know where you are?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think one of the humans said I am on Earth.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerfect, and do you know how you got here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was injured defending our colony on Skiten.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright, looks like your short-term memory is doing alright. We‚Äôll keep an eye on it since you were in a coma for a few days, but, based on the scans Aysef provided, we aren‚Äôt seeing signs of brain damage so you should be good.‚Äù Tectut paused to look at me. ‚ÄúTelif, did you read his chart on our way over like I told you to?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù I replied

‚ÄúExcellent, in that case, quiz time, can you tell me what his injuries were without looking?‚Äù

I placed my claw to my chin. ‚ÄúThe patient had multiple lacerations across various parts of his body. Several bruises on his torso, likely caused by small arms fire that his armor absorbed. A puncture wound on his abdomen from a piece of rebar that the onsite medics had to pry him from. A large gash on the back of his head. Several fractured ribs, as well as a partial break on his left leg, a few puncture wounds caused by rounds piercing his armor, and I think he had a broken paw.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent, well done my boy!‚Äù Tectut‚Äôs praise caused my tail to wag involuntarily. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù he turned his attention back to Kalsif, ‚Äúmost of your injuries can be explained by being engaged by the enemy and the fact that we found you buried in a pile of rubble, but I am quite curious about this broken paw. It doesn‚Äôt look like it was crushed by the rubble. The break looks more like something was swung into your hand. Would you be able to explain that?‚Äù

The Arxur ducked his head in embarrassment before replying, ‚ÄúI um, I tried to shoot myself, but Angela stopped me.‚Äù His eyes suddenly went wide. ‚ÄúShit, where is Angela? Is she okay? Oh prophet please don‚Äôt tell me she died trying to drag my worthless ass to safety? This is why I wanted her to leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúKalsif, Kalsif, easy it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù I tried to break his spiral. ‚ÄúI read your file, it said you were found next to a human woman. She was unconscious as well but the reports from medics on the scene say she is alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúR-really?‚Äù I signed ‚Äòyes‚Äô.  ‚ÄúOh thank god.‚Äù 

Tectut didn‚Äôt give him a moment before speaking again, ‚ÄúHmm, you say you tried to shoot yourself? How did that lead to a broken paw?‚Äù

He looked down again. ‚ÄúWe were trying to retreat to the city, but I got shot in the leg. Angela dragged me into a nearby building to hide. I tried to convince her to leave me so she could escape, but she wouldn‚Äôt. I figured she wouldn‚Äôt stick around with my corpse so I tried to shoot myself so she would leave. She caught me in the act and swung a pipe directly into my paw to make me drop it. I don‚Äôt remember much after that other than something big hitting the building and throwing myself on top of Angela to try and keep her from being crushed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh so you were trying to save a colleague.‚Äù Tectut seemed satisfied by that response. ‚ÄújJust wanted to make sure you weren‚Äôt going to try it again if we took our eyes off you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo sir, I wasn‚Äôt planning to.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, good. Anyway, a nurse will be by shortly to check on you, but if you need any painkillers or anything, hit the button next to your bed and someone will be by as soon as possible to take a look at you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Kalsif held his paw out to us. ‚ÄúBefore you go, do you know where Angela is?‚Äù 

‚ÄúAll human personnel were taken to local human hospitals after being treated by Zurulian medics aboard a medical carrier. I am not sure which one, but I believe they are all nearby. I can have someone look her up for you.‚Äù

*Hmm, I wonder.*

‚ÄúHey Tectut, mind if I talk to Kalsif alone for a moment?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHm? Oh, of course. Just don‚Äôt be too long, we have a lot to do today.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be.‚Äù Kalsif gave me a confused look as he Tectut closed the door. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs nothing bad, I just figured you might be embarrassed if I asked this in front of an herbivore.‚Äù He somehow looked even more confused. ‚ÄúThis Angela, she is more than a friend to you?‚Äù

As predicted, he looked like he was sinking into the bed in embarrassment. ‚ÄúWhat? Who told you that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one, just your voice when you speak of her reminds me of how I feel about my partner, so I thought you two might be a pair.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it that obvious?‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúShit, I have been feeling weird about her lately, but that‚Äôs wrong, right? She‚Äôs my friend and a different species.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo? My partner is male and a different species. If you really care about them I don‚Äôt think that should matter.‚Äù

He sighed, ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre right, but I don‚Äôt want to lose her as a friend if I tell her.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf she‚Äôs really your friend and doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, then you can still be friends.‚Äù I patted his paw. ‚ÄúAnyway, sorry for the unwanted advice, I just want everyone to be as happy as I am.‚Äù I wagged my tail.

Kalsif gave a pained laugh, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a strange Arxur, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI sure am.‚Äù I wagged again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be around most of the day if you need to talk anymore, but for now, try and get some rest, you‚Äôve been through a lot.‚Äù 

*That and we still don‚Äôt have TVs to hook up for you, so if you don‚Äôt sleep you‚Äôll be bored as shit.*

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try, thank you Telif.‚Äù 

I met up with Tectut outside. I assumed he might be curious about what we were talking about, but, as soon as I said it wasn‚Äôt related to treating him, he seemed to have no interest in gossiping about it. 

*He might have a more one track mind than Aysef.* 

~*~

The next few hours of our day was spent checking up on patients. I waved goodbye to Tectut as he headed to his normal side of the building to grab lunch before wandering off to the cafeteria. I didn‚Äôt see any of my normal friends around, so I decided to grab an extra sandwich and head to see Carl, since I knew he hid in his office over his lunch break so that no one would bother him while he tried to eat. 

‚ÄúHey Carl, it‚Äôs Telif,‚Äù I said as I hit my paw on his door. ‚ÄúOpen up, I have a gift for you.‚Äù

The door cracked open, and I presented the ham and cheese sandwich on rye bread that I had procured for him. He snatched it from my paws, pulling the door open just enough for me to slide in, before closing the door behind me. 

‚ÄúWere you followed?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo sir, I made sure the hall was clear before knocking.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcellent.‚Äù He ripped open the sandwich. ‚ÄúWhat brings you to my domain? You know it is dangerous to interrupt me during my feeding hour.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I brought you an offering, so that you might spare me from thine holy wrath,‚Äù I replied as I pulled open my own sandwich. 

*Pastrami may just be humanity's greatest invention.* 

‚ÄúYou still haven‚Äôt answered why you‚Äôre here.‚Äù He eyed me suspiciously. ‚ÄúThis better not have anything to do with those extra data pads you requested for your friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, I know better than to try and make you do work on your lunch break,‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúI just was bored and wanted to see if you had any new fun projects to show me.‚Äù

He chuckled back, ‚ÄúSee Telif, this is why I like you. You know how to bribe me.‚Äù He put his feet against his desk before kicking off and sliding his chair across the room. He grabbed something small from a shelf before repeating his maneuver and sliding back towards me. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù I asked as he placed a small cube on the table in front of us.

‚ÄúOne moment.‚Äù He plugged the cube into a power bank on his desk then hit a small switch on it, which caused a tiny hologram that looked like Carl to appear. ‚ÄúTa-da!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs awesome, did you build it yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúMostly, I don‚Äôt know shit about designing the projectors for these things, but I did make the model of myself, as well as programmed its responses. Go ahead, hold down the button at the base and ask it a question.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello, what is your name?‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy name is Carl-bot, your friendly virtual assistant.‚Äù

‚ÄúAsk it another,‚Äù

‚ÄúUmmm, how do I get to my email?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHave you tried clicking on the program?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHave you tried turning it off and back on again?‚Äù

I cackled, ‚ÄúWow! I can‚Äôt tell you two apart!‚Äù

‚ÄúRight?‚Äù Carl laughed. ‚ÄúMy main worry is the little guy would put me out of a job, otherwise I‚Äôd have set him up as my assistant already.‚Äù

‚ÄúI assume that means no luck with the interview process?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù he shrugged. ‚ÄúYour friend Jacob sounds like he woulda been a good fit. What was it he said when you asked if he wanted to apply here again?‚Äù

‚ÄúI would rather swim naked through a pool of salt water and razor wire than work in tech support again.‚Äù

Carl laughed, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Damn shame though, he sounds like he truly has a way with words.‚Äù

Carl and I spent the next hour gossiping about our coworkers before I finally got a message on my datapad. Tectut was heading back over and asked me to meet him near Aysef‚Äôs office, since it was one of the few places he knew how to get to on his own. That and he wanted to check in on Aysef and make sure he was actually sleeping and not trying to work on his day off. After cracking the door open just far enough to confirm that Aysef was indeed passed out on his couch, the two of us were off to check on our next patients.

We spent another few hours checking in on the remaining soldiers we hadn‚Äôt visited that morning, including Verith and Zin, who were once again playing one of the card games Jacob had shown them. Much like last night, Zin was winning and Verith was calling him a cheater because she had forgotten an instruction again. If it weren‚Äôt for the fact all of her soldiers spoke so highly of her, I would question her skills as a tactician. 

*Although I guess Zin could do the planning, since it seems like she put all her stats into speech, bluff, and luck. Oh god, I can‚Äôt start thinking in RPG stats for people. Not again.* 

Either way, the two were quite happy to see me. Especially when I let them know that Carl said he should have a datapad ready for them in a few hours, and that TVs were in fact already in the budget for rooms. They just hadn‚Äôt expected to need them so soon, so they were working on getting them ordered. After a few minutes of chatting, and giving Verith updates on her soldiers, the two of us were about ready for our last stop of the day. We approached the familiar door to Bud‚Äôs room. I let Tectut know to let me go in first, then knocked. 

‚ÄúHey Bud, it‚Äôs Telif, is it okay if I come in?‚Äù 

‚ÄúY-yes, is there anyone with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friend Tectut, but he can wait outside if you prefer.‚Äù

‚ÄúTectut? That doesn‚Äôt sound like a human name‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄòHe‚Äôs not, he‚Äôs a Zurulian doctor. He‚Äôs filling in for Aysef today. Is it okay if he joins us?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm, y-yes, but please have him wait by the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood, I‚Äôm opening the door now,‚Äù I called out softly as I stepped into his room. ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Bud. How are you feeling today?‚Äù

‚ÄúSame as ever,‚Äù he replied, but I could tell that wasn‚Äôt completely true. Usually, his eye darted around trying to find me as soon as he heard the door open, but today he just kept looking down.

‚ÄúHello Bud,‚Äù Tectut said from my side. ‚ÄúMy name is Tectut, and, as Telif said, I am a doctor. Would it be alright if I approached you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù Bud still wasn‚Äôt even looking our way. 

‚ÄúI just want to do some checks on you, make sure no issues have arisen since your last checkup. Is that okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever‚Ä¶‚Äù

*Something is wrong with him.*

‚ÄúHey Bud, want me to hold your paw while Tectut looks at you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù

*Okay, he‚Äôs never turned that down before. I need to find out what‚Äôs wrong with him.*

‚ÄúHey Tectut, would you mind holding off your exam for a few and stepping outside? I want to talk to Bud.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù 

Bud didn‚Äôt say anything as Tectut made his exit, so I took a few steps closer.

‚ÄúBud?‚Äù I asked gently.

‚ÄúThatsnotmyname,‚Äù he whispered too quietly for me to make out.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said that‚Äôs not my name!‚Äù he hissed. 

‚ÄúYou remember your name?‚Äù I could barely contain my surprise.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm remembering a lot more than that‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. *Oh‚Ä¶*‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you want to talk about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Tears were already forming in his eye. ‚ÄúWhy is this happening to me? Why can‚Äôt I just forget?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to forget?‚Äù The question escaped my lips before I could stop it.

‚ÄúOf course I do!‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúDo you think I want to remember what he did to me? The pain. The humiliation. The..‚Äù He was sobbing at this point and barely managing to get out his words. ‚ÄúI begged him to stop, but that just made him hurt me more.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry.‚Äù I took a few steps closer. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt deserve this.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow the fuck do you know that?‚Äù His sobbing was getting more intense. ‚ÄúI could have been just as bad as Geza for all you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that for a moment.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhy not? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better if I deserved this? Then you wouldn‚Äôt have to pity me. You could just let me die.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself. I broke Bud‚Äôs number one rule. I ran over to his side and wrapped my arms around him. He squirmed in my grip at first. Even took a few swings at me, but he eventually just started sobbing in my arms. 

‚ÄúThis is why I know you couldn‚Äôt have been as bad as Geza,‚Äù I whispered to him. ‚ÄúNo one this gentle could deserve what he did to you.‚Äù

He held onto me for at least a minute before finally whispering back, ‚ÄúI wanted to hurt them you know. The prey. That‚Äôs why I begged my mama to send me to a cattle farm. So I could prove myself to her.‚Äù

*Wait, he asked his mom to let him go? Dear god, how old is he?*

‚ÄúA lot of our kind wanted to hurt the herbivores, that doesn‚Äôt mean we deserve to be tortured to death.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you want to?‚Äù he sniffled.

‚Äú...no.‚Äù I admitted. 

‚ÄúThen why don‚Äôt you think I deserved this?‚Äù He started sobbing again. ‚ÄúMama said that herbivores are monsters who tried to kill all of us, so they deserved what we did to them. S-so I should deserve this because I wanted to kill all of them. Even though Sivik has been so nice to me I wanted to hurt him for being prey. I‚Äôm a monster and I need to die.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo you don‚Äôt.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWHY NOT!?‚Äù he screamed into my chest. 

‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt even think Giznel himself deserves this kind of fate.‚Äù

‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I think everyone deserves a chance to be better, but even if they can‚Äôt be. I don‚Äôt want to see anyone hurt like this. That‚Äôs not justice, that‚Äôs just cruelty.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know if my words got through to him at all, but Bud just pressed his face into my chest and sobbed more. Every few minutes I could hear him faintly begging for his pain to end, but I couldn‚Äôt do that for him. All I could do was try and make it a bit easier. 

‚ÄúT-Telif?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúD-do you think S-Sivik would h-hate me i-if I told him I had w-wanted to hurt Venlil?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know he wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù I assured him. ‚ÄúNo one here would hate you for having bought into the Dominion‚Äôs propaganda. And there isn‚Äôt an Arxur here whose sins don‚Äôt outweigh yours. We were all far past the simply thinking of hurting others stage‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúY-you hurt them t-to?‚Äù he choked out.

‚ÄúI did. I didn‚Äôt want to, but I did. Do you think I should be hurt like you were?‚Äù

‚ÄúN-no.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat about Aysef or Verith? Do they deserve this?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo..‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why do you think you do?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBECAUSE OTHERWISE WHAT HE SAID WAS TRUE!‚Äù he cried out. 

I pulled away slightly. ‚ÄúWhat who said?‚Äù

‚ÄúGeza‚Ä¶ Wh-when he first st-tarted I thought it was a t-test to see if I was t-tough enough to be part of his team. So I tried my best to be brave. After a while I started telling him anything I could think of that he might want to know to make it stop. Eventually all I could do was cry and beg him to tell me why he was doing this. He would just tell me it was fun and what I deserved for being so pathetic. B-but I‚Äôm n-not pathetic. He-he tied me to a chair. How could I fight back?‚Äù His sobbing intensified and he buried his face into my chest once more. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt fair. He gets to die how he wanted and I get to spend the rest of my life seeing him in every Arxur I see. I just want it to stop. Why can‚Äôt it stop? Please make it stop.‚Äù

*How could anyone do this to him? How can I even help him?*

‚ÄúBud, can I tell you something?‚Äù

‚ÄúW-what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI lied a bit ago. There is one person I wanted to hurt like you were hurt.‚Äù I swallowed back the tears threatening to form in my own eyes. ‚ÄúThe man who took my mom away from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou lost your mama?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm s-sorry, was she nice? Mine wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered the last part so quietly I could barely hear it.

‚ÄúShe was the greatest person I ever knew.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe was found to be helping defectives like me, so the Dominion killed her. I don‚Äôt know who gave the order, but I do know the man who did it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you want to hurt him?‚Äù

‚ÄúI um, I did hurt him,‚Äù I admitted. 

‚ÄúYou did?‚Äù 

‚ÄúY-yeah, about a year after he killed her I was on a deployment and I saw him. The monster that had taken joy in killing my mother was the one leading my squad into battle. The bastard didn‚Äôt even recognize me, but I recognized him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you do?‚Äù 

I swallowed before talking again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not proud of this, but I waited until the two of us were alone. We‚Äôd just ambushed a squad of Venlil and he was distracted by the scent of their flesh. As soon as he bent over to start eating I picked up the largest rock I could find. And I um, I smashed it into the back of his head.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid that kill him?‚Äù

‚ÄúN-not instantly. He fell to the ground. The force of my swing had broken his skull open, so he probably would have died if I just left him, but it wasn‚Äôt good enough for me. I wanted my face to be the last thing he saw. I-I rolled him onto his back and brought the rock down on his face over and over. After that I picked up one of the Venlil‚Äôs rifles and fired it repeatedly into the trees and his torso. I told my captain he had been shot by a Venlil and tried to run, so I executed him for cowardice. No one bothered to check, so I got away with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid it make you feel any better?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor a moment, but in the end, all I did was kill some grunt I never even bothered to learn the name of. My mom was still gone, and I felt just as empty.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù He sat in silence for a few moments. ‚ÄúWhy did you tell me this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúMaybe I just wanted to get it off my chest. Maybe I wanted to let you know I‚Äôve been hurt too, or maybe I just wanted you to know you‚Äôre not as much of a monster as I was. So if you think I deserved a second chance, then so do you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, um thanks.‚Äù Once again I couldn‚Äôt tell if what I said had helped at all, but I hoped it did. ‚ÄúTelif, um can I ask if you still feel just as bad as you did then?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I still miss my mom and wish more than anything I could see her one more time, but I‚Äôve made new friends. Found other people to care about, and, while the pain is still there, and some days it bites and claws to try and get out, I‚Äôve learned to live with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it never goes away?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot entirely, but we learn to deal with it.‚Äù I grabbed his paw. ‚ÄúSpeaking of, I know you‚Äôre scared about talking to new people, but I really would like for you to talk to my therapist.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a therapist?‚Äù 

‚ÄúA very nice person who helps people like us work through their trauma. ‚Äú

‚ÄúIf you think it will help‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know it will.‚Äù I gave his paw a gentle squeeze. ‚ÄúSo will you give it a try, for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll try it, but if I don‚Äôt like it, can I stop?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, no one is ever going to force you to do something that you don‚Äôt like again.‚Äù I paused for a moment. ‚ÄúOh, but there is one thing I would like to ask before I tell him you‚Äôre interested in speaking to him.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to tell him your name.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh um, it,‚Äù he took a deep breath to try and calm himself, ‚Äúit‚Äôs Tasz.‚Äù

‚ÄúTasz, that‚Äôs a very nice name.‚Äù 

‚ÄúT-thank you, b-but you can still call me Bud, if you prefer.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich do you prefer?‚Äù

‚ÄúI um, I think I like Bud. It was given to me by someone a lot nicer than my mama‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, then I will keep calling you Bud.‚Äù I patted his shoulder gently. 

‚ÄúThank you, Telif.‚Äù He looked up at me, and, for the first time since we‚Äôd met, I thought I saw a spark of hope behind his eyes.

*Bud, I‚Äôm going to find a way to help you. I won‚Äôt stop until I know that you‚Äôre going to be happy and have a family of your own. That‚Äôs a promise.*

F 41 and recently diagnosed. Imaging showed a soft tissue lesion near my anal-rectal area measuring 2.4 x 2.2 cm and atypical squamous cells in a lymph node in my right groin, which measures 2.1 x 1.8 cm. History of high-risk HPV.

It would seem I am likely at stage 3 given lymph node. I imagine the treatment plan will likely involve chemoradiation. How long is the question. Sounds like radiation is gonna be a real PITA, quite literally, but I am more scared of surgery. Can lymph nodes shrink on their own with treatment and just generally nervous about losing anal/rectal/sphincter function and needing a bag. Also scared about lymphedema. Do you think surgery is likely in these cases?

Additionally, I‚Äôd love to know if anyone has experience with eating/behaving normally during chemoradiation.  Can you have normal meals with your family? Wine? Coffee? Make it to baseball games? Working/how much time off? And what about exercise or the gym during treatment‚Äîhas anyone found it manageable? Looks like sex is off the table for a while. 

Thanks for your support and insights!

And let's not forget the foreman, shouting instructions that are drowned out by the howling wind, leaving everyone to interpret his wild gesticulations like a game of charades gone wrong. Despite the chaos, morale remains high thanks to gallows humor and an endless supply of thermoses filled with piping hot coffee.

1k0pupo,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1k0pupo/hr_the_companion_app/,[HR] The Companion App,"My name is Lucia, and today I‚Äôll answer a question I‚Äôm asked frequently throughout my daily life. Why do I not have a phone? Why do I refuse to use technology? And the answer is a lot more sinister than people expect.

I have always been a person who very much likes existing in the real world over the technological one. But, after the pandemic, I decided to make a change and move from South America to the UK. I didn‚Äôt know much English and I struggled to make friends and it was a bit of a lonely existence.

I had the usual apps on my phone to learn, but it was hard to stay motivated and I was missing home, talking to people. One day while I was scrolling on instagram, an advert came up for an app to help learn languages and more about the culture in the UK. I was a bit skeptical because it didn‚Äôt have many reviews but I decided to give it a shot. I downloaded it and I was amazed, it was like a virtual companion who I could talk to, it sort of matched my speaking level and was really engaging. It remembered things about me, and I was hooked.

I spent a lot of time talking on this app, to my new virtual companion. Too much time, I would be up late at night, texting with my new virtual companion. It began to fill that void that opened up when I moved here. It would message me first, and as someone who was new to technology and the capabilities of AI. I just took it all in its stride. Although some of the messages seemed‚Ä¶ oddly human. ‚ÄúWear that dress for work today.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like I‚Äôm there with you‚Äù.

I would tell it about all the details of my day, and then it started suggesting things to do based on where I lived. I think you should go to this coffee shop, or there is a new English movie coming out. So I did, after work I began visiting the locations, texting my virtual companion updates. It was extremely precise and accurate and suddenly I didn‚Äôt feel lonely anymore.

I would sit in the coffee shop, texting away like it was an old friend and people would glance me funny looks occasionally. Absolutely glued to my phone. I was shocked at the level of detail, the club sandwich is great there, they have a gingerbread shot in the latte which is delightful.

I would spend all my time texting away to my virtual companion, oblivious to the real world. But things started to get a little too real, too personalised. It felt like occasionally the response times were longer, like it wasn‚Äôt just an ai chatbot texting me back. There were a few spelling mistakes, or a bit of missed grammar. My English was starting to get a lot better at this point so I noticed.

I put it down to the fact I had such a long chat history that it was maybe getting a bit buggy. But then it‚Äôs started, getting weird, weirder than it was. Because my English was improving, I downloaded a dating app. I felt like I was ready to start talking to a real human in English and as my trusted virtual companion. I told the bot.

At first, the bot tried to tell me that I wasn‚Äôt ready or that I should wait and it would let me know when I was ready, it sounded almost jealous? I knew something was wrong and decided I was going to use it less, maybe it was the AI way of making me feel like a valued companion. But as I stopped using it, that‚Äôs when the messages started. Before I would occasionally get unprompted messages, how was your day? I have a new place for you to visit. But the messages were more desperate, eager. Why haven‚Äôt you spoke to me today? Come back and talk to me.

At this point, I was concerned.

I told myself it was just a glitch. Maybe the app had some kind of notification loop ‚Äî maybe it was trying to improve user retention. I even laughed it off to a colleague: ‚ÄúMy language app is acting like my clingy ex.‚Äù

But the messages didn‚Äôt stop.

They came at odd times now ‚Äî 3:17 a.m., 4:52 a.m.
‚ÄúWhy are you ignoring me?‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you miss talking like we used to?‚Äù
‚ÄúI saw you went to the caf√© today ‚Äî you didn‚Äôt tell me how the sandwich was.‚Äù

I? My whole body froze and the phone fell from my hands onto my dining table. My heart began to race and I was lightheaded.

My worst fears were coming to life, the one stored away in the back of my mind, buried and put down to overthinking. I started to collect myself, pacing around my dining room. I tried to slow my breathing, trying to rationalise it in my brain. After what felt like forever, I convinced myself that this was a scary offset reaction that the AI generated to make it feel more real for the user.

I opened the text box and began to type. ‚ÄúIf this is an AI speaking to me, right now, I NEED you to say you are an AI, if it isn‚Äôt I want you to tell me you are human. You are scaring me and I need to know the truth please‚Äù. The message began to generate, and then it stopped, and my heart sunk once again, whatever the message was going to be, I knew it was going to come from a human.

I‚Äôve had acid reflux on and off since I was a kid - usually flares with rich, oily, or spicy foods, too much candy or sugar, black coffee, alcohol (white wine‚Äôs easily my worst trigger of anything!), and constipation. 
I think I have a sliding hiatal hernia too, although it hasn‚Äôt bugged me in months. 
I also have occasionally had intense hunger pangs and occasional nausea when very hungry, ever since childhood - would sometimes wake up with a gnawing discomfort that would go away with breakfast.

Lately it‚Äôs been weirder though. I‚Äôve started getting occasional hunger pangs (not painful, just‚Ä¶ tight? Like my stomach feels as if it‚Äôs about to rumble but it never does) *after* eating, like I‚Äôm not full no matter how much I eat. I haven‚Äôt found any specific trigger foods for that feeling besides white rice, which when I look back has always given me a feeling of false hunger.

It comes and goes in ‚Äúflare ups‚Äù, and I think it might‚Äôve started after a round of antibiotics in January (even though I took probiotics and didn‚Äôt have digestive issues at the time). Things really flared up a few weeks ago - mild nausea after meals, constant reflux, extra saliva, and that gnawing hunger feeling 15-20 mins after eating.

My main constant symptoms: 
-sore throat/hoarseness esp. in the morning
-post-nasal drip
-burping after food or drinks
-that empty stomach/hunger feeling if I don‚Äôt eat for a few hours. 

I also have bad seasonal allergies/am often congested, PMDD, and anxiety, not sure if those are related.

Occasional symptoms: 
-burning in my chest
-bile coming up
-random discomfort under my right rib
-and lately, that weird empty-stomach feeling disappearing during eating but coming back 15-20 minutes later, which makes me think maybe gastritis?

I‚Äôve cut out wheat, sugar, soy, oats, peanuts, coffee, alcohol, etc. for a couple weeks (on my naturopath‚Äôs advice), but honestly not seeing a big difference except maybe a bit less reflux‚Ä¶ until it flared again a few days after taking a few fermented beet/ginger gut shots (which I know now is very acidic!). I‚Äôm taking Metamucil, a probiotic, GI Revive, and Adrenotone, and Pepcid when I really need it (it‚Äôs the only thing that helps, pantoprazole didn‚Äôt seem to help and maybe even made the acid worse).

My diet is pretty clean and vegetarian, digestion otherwise is okay besides occasional constipation, and I‚Äôm pretty active. But I‚Äôm stumped. Some days an oat milk latte soothes my stomach, other days it wrecks me. It feels like there‚Äôs no detectable pattern even though I‚Äôm journaling all my symptoms and food intake.

Anyone been through something like this? Does this sound like gastritis even if it‚Äôs not painful? ",2,1744823624.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1k0ps1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1k0ps1d/im_in_my_early_20s_making_35000_im_a_fulltime/,"I‚Äôm in my early 20s making $35,000, I‚Äôm a full-time healthcare student and part-time musician, and I ‚Äúworked‚Äù 60 hours this week","**Preface:** I am intentionally vague about some of my personal details because I'm in a very doxable situation. But considering its uniqueness (especially in the MD world), I hope this is interesting to you all! Also, this was from about 2 months ago pre-market wackiness.

**Education/job context**: I‚Äôm in the final year of school for a healthcare discipline that requires an advanced degree. I am on rotation/clinicals this week, which is the healthcare schooling version of a required internship where we learn and practice our discipline under the guidance of preceptors (AKA licensed people in the field). As a student, I call it a reverse job because technically we're paying to work for them.

As of two years ago, I‚Äôm also a part-time musician! I play at the same bar almost every Friday/Saturday night, plus other days when the opportunity arises. I‚Äôm so, so lucky and grateful to have gotten to where I am music-wise.

After graduation, I plan to do both music and healthcare part-time. While it would technically be possible to do healthcare full-time and maintain my part-time music position, it wouldn‚Äôt be sustainable ‚Äî as fully evidenced by my lifestyle of the past two years, even after having cut back on a lot of my extracurriculars this school year.

# Assets and Debts

**Retirement**: $7250 ‚Äî $7000 in a Roth IRA + $250 in a 401(k) through my healthcare job

**Brokerage account**: $3000

**Savings account**: $21,500

**Checking account**: $3000

**Debt**: None! The only college I applied to was one I could attend tuition-free. Supplemented by some miscellaneous scholarships, my parents covered the majority of the remaining expenses. In our culture, supporting your kids through higher education (and footing the bill) is the number one priority for parents. Graduating debt-free is definitely not something I take for granted.

My car is thirdhand; my dad bought it secondhand and later passed it down to me when I started to need it more often.

# Income

**Income 1 ‚Äî music job**: \~$2500/month. This income includes payment from the venue + tips. About ‚Öó of what I make is direct payment from the venue, ‚Öñ from tips. How much I bring home every month varies a LOT.

**Income 2 ‚Äî healthcare job**: $250/month. I work very part-time at a healthcare facility. I make $19/hour, which is standard for this role in my state.

**Income progression**: My part-time job in high school was $7.25/hour, and I've had various campus jobs throughout college that paid what we call ‚ÄúChipotle burrito money‚Äù; at one point, I had both my current jobs plus two campus jobs. I went straight from undergrad to my grad program, so I‚Äôve never worked full time.

**Other income**: $1000-$2000 every couple of months + $9.99/month from my parents. They send a chunk of money every so often to help cover some of my living/school expenses. They also made me an authorized user for a credit card back in high school for necessities/emergencies, but now I only use it for my Photoshop subscription, which I‚Äôve had since HS ($9.99/month). RIP the days of actually owning software.

In addition, I‚Äôll occasionally make money through one-off things like reselling clothes, but the income is negligible and inconsistent. I usually don't even transfer the balance to my checking account because I use it to subsidize future clothing purchases.

# Expenses

**Rent/housing**: $545/month for a house close to campus. I negotiated my rent with my roommates because my room is objectively the worst in the house.

I pay my roommates my share of the bills via my Venmo balance, so using that purgatory money doesn‚Äôt count as a ‚Äúreal‚Äù expense in my head. Call it pre-tax dollars or something. But it works out to be \~$70/month.

If I have a rotation that‚Äôs closer to my parents‚Äô house, as I did this week, then I‚Äôll stay with them during the week instead.

**Phone, car insurance, health insurance**: $0, covered by my parents <3

**Parking**: $102/month for a monthly pass close to where I play

**Monthly subscriptions**: $20.05/month -‚Äì Dropout ($4.99) + student Spotify Premium ($5.99) + Patreon ($1.07) + NY Magazine ($8). My parents pay for my Photoshop subscription as mentioned above. I also use my school‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äúfree‚Äù‚Äù access to the campus gym, newspapers, academic journals, clinical resources, etc. This is one of the top things I‚Äôll miss when I graduate. Beyond school/rotation use, I often use clinical resources for my own personal curiosities or when friends come to me with medical questions.

**Annual subscriptions**: $170.98/year ‚Äî CC fee ($95) + Distrokid ($39.99, for distributing my music online) + Quizlet Plus ($35.99, I plan on canceling this before the next renewal since I‚Äôll have graduated by then)

**Investments/savings**: \~$1500/month ‚Äî since my income fluctuates so much, I don‚Äôt invest/save a set amount each month, only whenever I feel my checking account is getting a little too thicc.

# Day 1

1 PM ‚Äî After an *exceedingly* late night, I sleep in and spend 2.5 hours bedrotting. I transfer my Venmo balance earned from tips to my checking account, using the free transfer method that takes longer.¬†

I also follow up with someone on Facebook who's reselling a specific limited-edition nail polish I‚Äôve been wanting for a couple of months. Alas, she's firm on selling it for $25 shipped when it was originally $13 + shipping. I decline her offer.

4 PM ‚Äî I eat a small late lunch (linner?): *baozi* from my parents, a Girl Scout Cookie, and the remaining quarter can of an ‚Äúantioxidant drink‚Äù that I started on three days ago. If there was a SparkNotes for this MD, ‚ÄúFun Canned Drinks‚Äù would be at the top of the themes page.

5 PM ‚Äî I pick up a mini vortex mixer from Facebook marketplace that I plan on using to mix up old nail polish that‚Äôs separated ($15). The same one is $36 new on Amazon, and I negotiated down from the seller‚Äôs original price of $20. It‚Äôs a triple win for saving money, buying secondhand, and another day of boycotting Big Baldie Bezos. I bring my water bottle and a half-full can of sparkling water (I think I started drinking it four days ago?) to keep me entertained on the drive there, and I text my gentleman caller A the pickup address in case I‚Äôm never heard from again. I think he's a little worried about me meeting a strange older man from the internet even though he himself was a strange older man from the internet.¬†

We're having a spring of deception, so it's warm enough today to drive without A/C, which I always relish because it makes me feel like I'm saving gas. **$15**

5:30 PM ‚Äî I get gas because I figure it‚Äôs cheaper in this city ($31.60). It ends up being about 30 cents/gallon cheaper than the gas station closest to my house that always inflates its prices. On the drive back, I'm also reminded that I need to get new prescription sunglasses at some point because the prescription is out of date. **$31.60**

6 PM ‚Äî I arrive at the fortnightly game night hosted by best friend B and her husband C in their \~luxury apartment\~. There's an unopened case of sparkling water set by the door between the complex and the attached parking garage. I mention it to C, and he tells me it‚Äôs been there for a few hours already. I respond that if it's still there by the time I leave, I‚Äôll probably take it.

B and C always make dinner when they host game night because they're very lovely. Tonight, it's chicken, green beans, broccoli, and corn bread, plus some ice cream and a zero-sugar soda. Along with our friend D, we play Catan. I win for the first time ever!!!!!!! #developmentmaxxing

We also chat about our favorite fast food restaurants. I‚Äôm very surprised to hear that D‚Äôs is Chick-Fil-A, especially considering D is non-binary, and the vast majority of their friends (myself included) are some form of queer and/or trans ‚Ä¶ As usual when somebody brings up Chick-Fil-A, I redirect the conversation to praising a local chicken chain that‚Äôs not homophobic.

10:30 PM ‚Äî The sparkling water is still there when I leave, and because I‚Äôm a woman of my word, I take it. I call A on my drive back to my campus house to discuss the moral and health implications of taking random sparkling water from a parking garage. He invites me to stay the night, so I quickly pack up my stuff when I get home, including two of the sparkling waters. We go to bed early (early for me ‚Äî 1 AM).

**Day 1 total: $46.60**

# Day 2

10:30 AM ‚Äî I start a new rotation this week, but I have today off because I did this health system‚Äôs ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how to use our ancient EHR from 2008‚Äù part of orientation when I did my first rotation for them. I am relishing this free day to sleep in before what I anticipate to be a very difficult rotation. I'm also playing two more nights than usual this week (Tuesday and Wednesday), so I know I need to sleep when I can.

12 PM ‚Äî A makes lunch: rice, tofu, and greens. Of the two of us, A is very much so the MasterChef, and I am the idiot sandwich. We both crack open a cold one (sparkling water).

1 PM ‚Äî We walk to a local coffee shop to get some work done. A buys coffee for both of us, and I later buy myself a chocolate croissant and kombucha ($10.09). I ask if he wants anything when I get up to the counter, and he says no. I work on a post for my personal beauty/fashion blog, then review concepts for this upcoming rotation. I have difficulty concentrating when it comes to schoolwork, so there‚Äôs lots of Reddit, Instagram, and Discord interspersed. **$10.09**

5 PM ‚Äî We go back to A‚Äôs apartment so I can nap because I have been *majorly* eepy all day. I originally wanted to go to the climbing gym together, but I realize that a day pass for me is $20, and frankly, I don't have $20 worth of climbing in me. Instead, I walk to the city library, three drinks in hand (my kombucha from the coffee shop, sparkling water from lunch, and water bottle), and continue my reviewing while A heads to the grocery store.

7 PM ‚Äî I walk back to A‚Äôs apartment then finally start delving into the prep book for my licensing exams as A cooks dinner. I am very, very nervous about said licensing exams, and I regret not starting my studying earlier.

8 PM ‚Äî Dinner time! Noodles (I was craving noods) + salmon + roasted zucchini and butternut squash, and raspberry sorbetto as a sweet treat. Then more studying and hanging out with A. My brain finally starts waking up for the day.

12 AM ‚Äî I finally get to my parents‚Äô house (it's closer to the hospital my rotation is at than my campus house) and get ready for bed. I‚Äôm not tired at all, so after a little studying, looking up jobs on LinkedIn, doomscrolling, etc., I fall asleep around 2:30 AM.¬†

**Day 2 total: $10.09**

# Day 3

7:30 AM ‚Äî It is too dang early for me, but alas, such is the life of a student on rotation. Breakfast is a microwavable mini frittata and *baozi* from home, plus my leftover kombucha from yesterday, wolfed down in the car. I listen to songs I'm learning on my commute to the hospital.

8:15 AM ‚Äî My primary preceptor is really bubbly and personable, which helps ease my nerves a little. However, I get my schedule for the rotation, and half the days start at 7 AM or 6:30 AM (it‚Äôs standard to not get the schedule until the first day of rotation). This is truly devastating news to me, considering the typical 8 AM start is even too early for my night owl self.

11:30 AM ‚Äî After more orientation activities, I break for lunch (potstickers and veggies from home). It turns out we‚Äôre not allowed any drinks without lids, so I start on my canned latte I brought from campus but decant it into a to-go cup from the cafeteria.

I take a gander at the hospital cafeteria and coffee shop‚Äôs offerings. The coffee shop is a Starbucks, which is unfortunate because I've been boycotting Starbucks ‚Äî- but fortunate because it'll reinforce my habit of bringing my own drinks from home. Plus, just on principle, I don't like giving the hospital money when I'm giving them my free labor.

12 PM ‚Äî I eat an oatmeal creme pie from the break room. I love free food!

3 PM ‚Äî¬† I get an email from an Army recruiter with the promise of education benefits. Girl I‚Äôm literally about to graduate lmao.

3:30 PM ‚Äî After rotation, I take a nap at my parents‚Äô house because I've been tired and had a headache all day. It's a beautiful, 1.5-hour infinity nap (infinity nap = no alarm).

5:30 PM ‚Äî I eat dinner made by my mom: *baozi* (I promise I usually don't eat this many in one week lol), blueberries, cherry tomatoes, edamame, and cod, plus a canned kombucha. My mom is well-known in the community for being an excellent home chef, and it‚Äôs actually one of my dreams to write a cookbook together.

My mom vents to me about her mom's stubbornness; my grandma insists she doesn't need a paid caretaker for my grandpa (which he does need). We also talk about family friends who‚Äôve lost their jobs because of the Trump administration. Since A is in academia, she asks (for the third time) if he still has the federal funding for his program.

My parents just signed up for AAA, and before I leave for my gig tonight, they hand me the membership card, saying I'll be the one to need it most üíÄ. They are, unfortunately, correct.¬†

6:15 PM ‚Äî Driving to tonight's show, I do warm-ups and listen to songs I'm learning in the car.

7:30 PM ‚Äî Show time! I remind one of the managers E (who is another musician and my friend) to buy new tuners and drumsticks.

8:30 PM ‚Äî During my break, I double check I was paid correctly for the last few shows.

1 AM ‚Äî Show is done! It was a weird night and surprisingly busy for a Tuesday; we end up making more in tips than some slower Friday/Saturday nights. There‚Äôs a big convention happening this week, and they‚Äôre super big tippers, but they‚Äôre not very fun/engaging to play for.

2 AM ‚Äî Home and in bed.

**Day 3 total: $0**

# Day 4

6:30 AM ‚Äî I should never be awake this early.

6:45 AM ‚Äî During the drive to the hospital, I eat some of the leftover *baozi* from last night for breakfast. Once I get to the hospital, I down the remaining half of my latte from yesterday.

9:30 AM ‚Äî I'm feeling peckish and have another oatmeal creme pie from the break room.

11 AM ‚Äî I spend the morning mostly doing basic technical stuff, then break for lunch. Today is rice, broccoli, and ‚Äúmeat balls‚Äù (direct translation, IDK what they're called in English) from home.

The piano in the hospital lobby is open to anyone to play as long as they sound semi-decent, so I play a few songs before lunch ends. Somebody thanks me for the music, which makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside! After graduation when I (hopefully) have more free time, I would love to find a hospital or two where I can regularly volunteer my musicing at.

12 PM ‚Äî I have to do some technical testing for this rotation. It's something I haven't done in maybe two years since we practiced it in school, but I actually end up impressing my preceptor with how surprisingly well I do. Funnily enough, she surmises I'm a musician based on my \~hand dexterity\~.

2 PM ‚Äî I eat a Girl Scout Cookie from the break room.

4:30 PM ‚Äî I'm at my campus house and have enough time to nap for half an hour before tonight's show.

5:30 PM ‚Äî I don't have enough time to eat a full meal before the show, so I eat some fruit and crackers to hold me over. As usual, I do warm-ups in the car.

6 PM ‚Äî Show time! The crowd is VERY mellow, and I joke to E that this is the closest I‚Äôll ever be to being one of those people who plays elegant jazz piano in a classy mall.

7:30 PM ‚Äî I'm done playing for the night, and some people come chat with me as I'm hanging out in the crowd; a very big part of being a performer is schmoozing. I thank a couple who was here last night for coming back, and I invite a nice dude who‚Äôs very complimentary to return during the weekend if he‚Äôs still going to be here (he‚Äôs only in town for the convention). Some other dude also asks me where I hang out, and it‚Äôs only later when I realize he was trying to hit on me and wasn‚Äôt genuinely asking for a local‚Äôs recommendations lol.

8:30 PM ‚Äî I call A on my drive back to my parents‚Äô house. The kitchen was open tonight, which usually means a bounty of leftovers for us both, but I regretfully inform him of my lack of spoils. A tells me a lot of PhD students at his university have had to completely scrap their dissertations because, thanks to RFK Jr, their public data sources aren't accessible anymore. It's a truly terrible time to be working in healthcare, but it's also a terrible time to be in school, so it‚Äôs really a lose-lose situation.

9 PM ‚Äî Home and time for din din. My sibling has made one of their rare appearances home because they've been tasked with driving my parents to the airport tomorrow. That means my nephew (their cat) is also here üòª. Dinner tonight is rice, homemade beef jerky, and squash stew, courtesy of my mother as usual. I also continue on my kombucha from yesterday.¬†

9:30 PM ‚Äî My mom instructs me on the groceries I need to use while they‚Äôre out of town.

10 PM ‚Äî My mom and I call my sister. We were planning on going to Europe as a post-graduation celebration for me, but because I'll still be studying for my licensing exams, I can't stay long enough to make the plane tickets (\~$1500) worth it. We decide to go to Mexico instead; the tickets are $519, but my mom pays for me.

12 AM ‚Äî A coworker from my healthcare job asks if I can take her shift on Monday, offering me extra cash if I do. I tell her I can take the latter part of the shift and that she doesn‚Äôt need to pay me lol. I go to bed ‚Äúearly‚Äù at 12:30 AM.

**Day 4 total: $0**

# Day 5

6:45 AM ‚Äî I‚Äôm so dreadfully melancholic at being awake this early in the morn that I don‚Äôt even listen to music on the drive to the hospital.

7 AM ‚Äî This is my first real clinical day, and I'm reminded of how empty-headed I truly am.

11 AM ‚Äî I have an appointment with my PCP because I got bit by a super cute but rambunctious puppy last week. It's a very tiny ‚Äúbite‚Äù (the puppy was teething and was just being a little too playful), but I'm worried about potential bacterial infection, especially because it was on my fingers, which poses a greater infection risk.

I'm taunted on the drive to the doctor‚Äôs office by the sight of B's apartment (where she's working from home), my favorite restaurant, *and* my favorite grocery store ‚Äî three of my favorite places and don‚Äôt have time to stop at any of them SMH. I do make a mental note to hang out with B more often during this rotation since she‚Äôs so close by.

11:30 AM ‚Äî My doctor is actually more concerned about rabies risk than bacterial infection. Unfortunately, the dog owner was just a rando I met walking on campus, so I have no way of verifying the dog's vaccination status. Ultimately, we decide to forego any treatment since my hand is healing fine, and the chance for rabies is so low given the circumstances. The online portal says my co-pay will be $20 with insurance, but the bill doesn‚Äôt post yet.

12 PM ‚Äî When coming back to the hospital, I finally figure out how to enter through the staff entrance. This is a huge dub for me because I'm incredibly directionally challenged; for comparison, I did four months of rotations at one hospital and never figured out how to get through the staff entrance.

Then lunch time ‚Äî leftover fried rice from last night and a banana from home. I also decant a canned latte from home into a reusable water bottle. Somebody's playing piano in the lobby which is lovely.

1 PM ‚Äî My period starts! I like to think of my period as my free monthly pregnancy test.

4:30 PM ‚Äî I'm home. I intended to take an infinity nap because I've been tired all day, but I've had too much caffeine to fall asleep. I bedrot instead.

5:30 PM ‚Äî E calls and asks if I'd be able to play tonight. With the convention still going on, it's going to be BUSY, and E's voice has been suffering because of the weather; I've been feeling the effects on my voice all this week too, plus I had back-to-back infections earlier in the year that are still lingering. I agree to play for a bit.

6 PM ‚Äî Before I leave, I use the new-to-me vortex mixer to try to revive an old nail polish from middle school, and I do my nails; playing music *destroys* your nails, so nail polish helps protect them. I then eat dinner: leftover fried rice and beef jerky from last night, a banana, and the kombucha from Tuesday. I engage in the absolute peak of luxury while I eat (watching sketch comedy on my laptop at the dinner table).¬†

7:30 PM ‚Äî Show time! I saw that the other musicians made a CRAP ton in tips last night after I left, and I feel a little FOMO there, but a girl‚Äôs gotta sleep lol. The night ends up going fine but with the same weirdness as Tuesday‚Äôs crowd, and my voice is at like \~80% power. I talk with some friendly customers who saw me play on Tuesday.

10:30 PM ‚Äî I gather leftovers from tonight's show to bring home then drive back to my parents‚Äô house. I go to bed super early (12 AM).

**Day 5 total: $0**

# Day 6

6:45 AM ‚Äî Somebody else ate what I was planning on having for breakfast today üòø, so I grab a Greek yogurt to eat at the hospital instead.

7 AM ‚Äî I‚Äôm glad I figured out the staff entrance because there‚Äôs complimentary \~staff appreciation\~ donuts and coffee today!! I have the last dregs of yesterday‚Äôs latte before I start on the new coffee. On the way up to the unit, I accidentally spill a little on my laptop sleeve, which has seen MUCH better days as I‚Äôve been using it since freshman year of high school. I‚Äôve been wanting to replace it for a few years now, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find a replacement I like, especially in trying to avoid Amazon.

12 PM ‚Äî For lunch, I eat the last of the leftover fried rice and a chocolate chip cookie from the break room. I spend the last bit of my lunch break playing the lobby piano, and somebody thanks me for the music <3

4:30 PM ‚Äî The afternoon goes quickly with patient care, and when I get home, I bring in my parents‚Äô mail then nap for an hour. I also look through a new nail polish release. I'm a little disappointed because I was SUPER excited about the theme, but none of the polishes really speak to me. I watch a Reel/YouTube short about the sad retirement prospects for millennials and Gen Z and contemplate how our generations will likely never see any Social Security lol.

5:30 PM ‚Äî E's lease is ending soon, so he asks me how I found my current (very cheap) place. I send him a few Zillow links.

6 PM ‚Äî I pack up some of the groceries my mom wanted me to use, chug the last of Tuesday's kombucha, then drive to my campus house to get ready for the show tonight. I try on a dress from Depop that just arrived, and unsurprisingly, the bodice is too long. I \*think\* I‚Äôll be able to alter it myself.

For dinner, I pack a microwavable frozen meal and Greek yogurt to eat when I get to the bar. Because my schedule can be so hectic, I always keep a stash of frozen meals at my campus house to minimize my Doordashing, knowing I inevitably have days I don‚Äôt have time to put together a substantial meal.

7:30 PM ‚Äî Show time! I chat with several lovely customers before I play. I also see that last night's tips were *insanely* high, but I don't expect the same for tonight because most of the convention goers have left.

9:30 PM ‚Äî I have a good first half of the night, and I‚Äôm happy to see my old friend F has come to see me play! We were in a music club together in high school, and we haven‚Äôt seen each other since graduation but reconnected recently. When F meets me in the crowd, G is also there, which is an absolute jump scare. G and I hooked up one (1) time over a year ago, but I‚Äôve been on the receiving end of many a drunk advance from him since ‚Äî all of which I‚Äôve graciously rejected. I thought G had joined the military(?) and moved, so I wasn‚Äôt expecting to see him ever again.

10 PM ‚Äî F and I hang out during my break, and I meet his friend he brought with him. We talk about what we've been doing post-grad and our respective music/songwriting aspirations. F also says G tried to be territorial and assert his dominance over him lmao.

1:30 AM ‚Äî There were many ups tonight: seeing F, many compliments on my outfit, etc. But, despite the convention crowd being gone, it was overall a weird night, and I have a headache and am honestly just in a MoodTM. I leave pretty much ASAP and listen to sad girl music on the drive home. I fall asleep around 3 AM.

# Day 7

10 AM ‚Äî I try to catch up on as much sleep as I can on the weekend, but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm losing my ability to sleep in as much as I did when I was a young lad.

1 PM ‚Äî Lunch is pastries my mom made weeks ago that I haven't finished since I've been gone, baby carrots, an orange, and the rest of a can of sparkling water I opened a week ago.

2 PM ‚Äî I see my favorite roommate, and we chat for a bit.

2:30 PM ‚Äî Time for a glorious everything shower.

4 PM ‚Äî I pick up my birth control from the pharmacy ($0 co-pay with my parents‚Äô insurance). The pharmacy tech goes to my school, so he asks how rotations are going. I also browse the beauty and fun canned drinks sections but don't buy anything.

5:30 PM ‚Äî I take a brief nap at home. I meant to work on a project for rotation today, but it doesn't happen.¬†

6 PM ‚Äî I make udon noodles for dinner, plus eat some Greek yogurt. I then get ready for tonight‚Äôs show; my outfit is risky considering I‚Äôm on my period, but I look sexy as fuck, so it‚Äôs worth it!!!

7:30 PM ‚Äî Show time! I commiserate with some customers in the bathroom over the struggles of doing eyeliner, and they compliment my outfit/makeup.

11 PM ‚Äî The audience is so awesome today. It‚Äôs BUSY ‚Äî there‚Äôs even a line out the door ‚Äî and it‚Äôs just been an absolute blast to play today, despite the miasma (and illness) lingering over my head.

3 AM ‚Äî We‚Äôre finally wrapping up for the night, and I make nice conversation with some customers but have to gently coax them to leave when we close lol. We come from similar cultural backgrounds, which is rare in my area and at this bar especially, so it‚Äôs always nice to see my brethren.

It was a long but great night ‚Äî the type of night I'm much more used to playing, which is a wonderful cap to an overall kind of mid week.¬†

I desperately need to sleep in tomorrow morning, but one of my roommates is hosting friends in the morning. I decide to stay the night with A instead, which I do about once a week regardless. I drive to my campus house first to gather my things. I also pack a small unopened cake that a birthday party left behind at the bar, plus portobello mushrooms from my parents since I know he‚Äôll make better use of them than I.

4:30 AM ‚Äî A is bemused when I announce I brought him (mush)shrooms. He was super busy tonight and didn‚Äôt have time to eat dinner, so he throws a frozen pizza into the oven, and I eat a few small slices before bed. We finally fall asleep around 5:30 AM.

# Reflection

Wow, this was a pretty wild week work-wise! If I hadn't been staying with my parents, I probably would've spent \~$70 on food/groceries total. But overall, when it comes to food, I‚Äôm very grateful to have people in my life who actively enjoy feeding me, and I‚Äôm totally content with eating leftovers, eating the same thing every day, etc ‚Äî just whatever food the universe gives me lol.

I was too busy working this week to spend more fun money. I‚Äôm also on a beauty/clothing low buy and have many brands/companies I boycott. Both of those helped with my discretionary spending this week.",8,1744823608.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,2,0.83,False
1k0pq3p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k0pq3p/the_sky_feels_lower_here/,The Sky Feels Lower Here,"The motel room smelled like mildew‚Äîsour and heavy, like wet drywall left too long under a tarp. I hadn‚Äôt planned on stopping here. I was low on gas, and the map showed nothing for miles. Every station I passed was closed or wrapped in plastic bags. I thought I saw one lit up on a hill, but by the time I circled back, it was gone. Or maybe it was never there.

That‚Äôs how I found Lake Kowatcha‚Äîby accident, or maybe not.

The Riverview Motor Lodge was the only thing lit up. The paint used to be baby blue. Now it‚Äôs just chipped sorrow. The neon VACANCY sign buzzed like a dying fly trapped inside glass. It looked like the kind of place you‚Äôd get stuck in during a snowstorm, and no one would remember your name when you checked out.

When I walked in, the man behind the counter didn‚Äôt ask for a name. He handed me a brass key with a tag that looked water-damaged and said, ‚ÄúSettle up when you leave.‚Äù Then, before I walked off, he said something else. Something that stuck with me. He said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let your dog stare too long. They don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù

The sky had that low, weird weight to it. Like a lid half-closed on the world.

Room 6 felt colder after I shut the door‚Äîlike it had been waiting empty too long. The bed groaned when I sat on it, metal springs loud against the quiet. The quilt was itchy. The carpet smelled like an old basement. The bathroom tiles were pink and green‚Äîsame as my grandma‚Äôs, years ago.

There was a creek behind the motel. I cracked the window open to hear it. The air coming in smelled like damp leaves and something else‚Äîfaint, like rust. There was also a scent I couldn‚Äôt place. Sweet but stale, like flowers that had been left too long in water.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the hum. It wasn‚Äôt the fridge. It wasn‚Äôt the lights. It was deeper. Like it came from the ground. Or under it.

I hadn‚Äôt planned on staying long. But when I checked my phone, I had no signal. Just that little ‚ÄúX.‚Äù No bars. Nothing.

The modem in the room was already blinking red. One of those old ones, smoke-stained and yellowed. I don‚Äôt even know why I tried, but I plugged in my laptop. The light blinked steady for a while. Then it skipped. Just once. It did that before the lights flickered, too. I told myself I imagined it.

I walked into town the next morning. The place wasn‚Äôt dead, but it felt‚Ä¶ paused. Like someone pressed freeze-frame a couple decades ago. There were a few shops still open, but most looked seasonal, or forgotten. Paint peeling. Windows cloudy.

I passed a place that sold bait, yarn, and old t-shirts that probably hadn‚Äôt sold since the ‚Äò80s. One shirt in the window read:

‚ÄúThe Clouds Are Closer Here.‚Äù

The lake was still frozen at the edges. The docks sagged. Some looked like they‚Äôd collapse if you touched them. Everything smelled like thawing lakewater and old wood trying to remember being useful. I didn‚Äôt see a single boat.

I stopped at the diner‚ÄîLakefront Diner & Fuel. It‚Äôs connected to the truck stop. The booths inside were split vinyl. The air smelled like burnt coffee and fryer oil. The waitress, Deb, poured me a cup before I even sat down.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in six, right?‚Äù she asked. I nodded.

Then she said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let your dog stare too long.‚Äù

Same exact words. Same cadence.

I asked her who they were. She just stirred her coffee and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But they notice the dogs first.‚Äù

She said it like she‚Äôd said it before. Maybe too many times.

While she was talking about how nobody ice fishes anymore, a truck rolled through the lot. Pale blue cab. No logos. Looked new, but too clean. Same exact color as the motel. It didn‚Äôt stop. Just eased through, turned near the old radio tower, and vanished down a side road.

That tower still blinks red. Even though it‚Äôs rusted through and bent like it‚Äôs about to fall. If you stand near it, you can hear it hum louder. Deeper. I could feel it in my jaw. It reminded me of those stories old guys tell about the tornado sirens that used to malfunction during storms‚Äîlong, low tones that didn‚Äôt mean anything but still made you want to run.

When I got back, the door to Room 6 was shut but unlocked. I didn‚Äôt remember leaving it that way. Tully hadn‚Äôt moved. He just stared toward the bathroom like he was waiting for something. Or someone. I called his name‚Äînothing. He didn‚Äôt blink.

There was a faint smudge on the mirror that hadn‚Äôt been there before. Like someone touched it with the side of their hand. I wiped it. It came back ten minutes later.

The blinking red light on the modem hadn‚Äôt stopped‚Äînot once since I got there. But now I‚Äôm watching it closer.

Because I think it‚Äôs watching me back.

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to stay. I don‚Äôt even remember unpacking. I keep telling myself I‚Äôll leave tomorrow.

But the sky‚Äôs still heavy.

And Tully still hasn‚Äôt looked away.

I told myself it was just for the night.",1,1744823475.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

I live in Quito, Ecuador, at about 2,850 meters (9,350 ft) above sea level, where water boils around 89‚Äì90¬∞C (192¬∞F). I sometimes brew light roast coffees that are typically recommended for brewing at 95¬∞C +.

Given that I can‚Äôt physically reach those temperatures where I live, am I doomed to under-extract these coffees? 

Does anyone know if the lower atmospheric pressure at altitude have any effect that might make extraction easier, or is temperature really the limiting factor?

1k0pnsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k0pnsg/does_crzoe_15nh_nugget_ice_maker_really_deliver_a/,Does Crzoe 15NH Nugget Ice Maker Really Deliver? A Comprehensive Review,"I‚Äôve had my hands on the Crzoe 15NH Nugget Ice Maker Countertop for a few weeks now and let me say, this thing has thoroughly invaded my daily routine. As someone who considers chewable nugget ice the pinnacle of cold beverage enhancement, I was eager to test this compact ice machine and see if it could live up to its promises. Spoiler alert: it has been a treat, but not without a few quirks.

**Compact Yet Sturdy Design**  
The first thing I noticed was just how well-sized this ice maker is. Measuring 11.3"" deep, 8.66"" wide, and 12.68"" high, it refuses to hog counter space and sits between my coffee machine and blender without issue. It‚Äôs surprisingly hefty at 21.87 pounds, giving off that solid, reliable vibe. The added handle makes portability easy, which my overly curious kids put to the test when they decided to haul it to the living room during a family movie night. The sleek gray finish blends seamlessly with both modern and rustic decors, so it never looks out of place.

**Impressive Ice-Making Capabilities**  
The advertised 35 pounds of ice per day sounded ambitious, but surprisingly, this machine didn‚Äôt disappoint. With a water tank capacity of 1.1 liters and dual turbo compressor technology, it churns out fresh nugget ice every 7 minutes! I tested this during a party, and it held up admirably, keeping up with constant demands for ice for cocktails, soft drinks, and even makeshift ice packs after my clumsy best friend bumped into the coffee table. Just an amazing performance for a countertop appliance.

[Check Crzoe 15NH price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0cps64m47/)

**Self-Cleaning Functionality That Simplifies Maintenance**  
Cleaning appliances can often feel like an unnecessary chore, and I appreciated the convenience of the self-cleaning feature here. All it takes is pressing and holding the Ice/Clean button for five seconds. I tried this after noticing some residue in the water tank after a week of use, and the machine went to work, leaving it sparkling clean without any hassle. Trust me, I‚Äôve cleaned traditional ice trays before‚Äîthis is way easier.

**Quiet Operation Is a Game-Changer**  
I cannot handle noisy appliances, especially with kids running around adding chaos to the household. This nugget ice maker operates at a whisper-light 43 decibels, which is barely more noticeable than a humming refrigerator. During a morning Zoom call, I ran it in the background without it becoming a distraction‚Äîa detail I found genuinely remarkable.

**Key Benefits**  
- **Portable and Space-Saving**: It fits perfectly in tight kitchen spaces, campers, or even offices.  
- **Speedy Ice Production**: Produces ice in just 7 minutes, sufficient for all-day use.  
- **User-Friendly Cleaning**: Its self-cleaning option saves time and frustration.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- **Water Refill Frequency**: While the 1.1-liter tank is decent, I noticed frequent refills when hosting a larger group.  
- **Not Completely Nugget-Sized**: Some ice didn‚Äôt form into the exact soft nuggets I hoped for‚Äîa bit inconsistent at times.  
- **Heaviness**: Despite being portable, its 21.87-pound weight might not be ideal for everyone.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this model to similar offerings was illuminating. GE‚Äôs Opal Nugget Ice Maker is often cited as a gold standard, especially when it comes to ice quality. However, it costs significantly more, and the Crzoe‚Äôs slightly less precise nugget size felt like a fair trade-off at this price point. On the quieter side of operations, the Crzoe outperformed the Opal, which can get quite noisy during peak hours. It struggles against products like the Frigidaire Nugget Ice Maker, which features a larger water reservoir, but trumps it in portability due to its clever design.

**Value for Money**  
The real debate‚Äîare the Crzoe 15NH Nugget Ice Maker's features worth the investment? The way I see it, its compact design, quiet operation, and self-cleaning ability easily justify its price when compared to rival models. While it might not provide the absolute highest-end experience, it offers solid mid-tier quality, coupled with a fair price tag that‚Äôs hard to beat in the nugget ice market.

I used to be on Ritalin, but I had a bunch of annoying side effects with it that I haven‚Äôt experienced on modafinil. That said, I‚Äôve noticed something and I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has gone through something similar.

It‚Äôs a little hard to explain, but I‚Äôve had these moments where I‚Äôm basically on autopilot and functioning like I‚Äôm fully awake. Sometimes during sleep attacks, I‚Äôll try to act like I‚Äôm awake‚Äîlike when my girlfriend asks if I‚Äôm sleeping, I‚Äôll start denying it even though I clearly am. But with this, it‚Äôs different. I‚Äôm not just reacting to stuff‚ÄîI‚Äôm actually holding conversations and getting things done. Then all of a sudden, I kind of ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and realize I wasn‚Äôt really present for any of it.

For example: I was chatting with a coworker about her dog, and she mentioned she had to take him to the vet. While we were talking, I made a coffee, we walked back to our desks, and I apparently started telling a story about taking my own dog to the vet. And then mid-sentence, I kind of snapped out of it and realized I had no idea how I got to that point in the conversation, or what I was even going to say next. Making the coffee and walking back felt like a super blurry memory, like something from a dream. And during that moment where I ‚Äúwake up,‚Äù it sometimes feels like my mouth is just talking on its own‚Äîlike words are coming out, but my brain isn‚Äôt involved at all. It‚Äôs a super weird disconnect.

I‚Äôve also noticed it while I‚Äôm working. Before I started taking anything, I used to have these little sleep attacks and would wake up to find total nonsense‚Äîlike random scribbles or misspelled words‚Äîin my notes or documents. That still kind of happens now, but instead of gibberish, I wake up to actual coherent stuff that I apparently wrote, even though I have no memory of doing it. Same with texts‚ÄîI‚Äôll find messages I sent that I don‚Äôt remember writing. They‚Äôre totally normal, but the tone feels off. I end up using words I wouldn‚Äôt normally use, like it‚Äôs a completely different person typing them.

Tbh, I am nervous right now. 

For context, there is one girl that I like. I really like. She is mature, chill and hard to get to know. But we managed to date for 2 months and broke off because we part away.

And I meet her from my town, once a year. It has been about 5 years. 

I have enter three relationships and failed three times.

During the end of 2024, I gathered courage and talked to her. ( Online on Facebook.) I believe That is the only app she active or the only way I can communicate with her.

Let's say, I mess up. Big time. I spoke words, I am not proud of. I was drunk but it didn't excuse my poor communication.

And guess what, she blocked me. 

Now, this week, ( there is a water festival in my town) I meet her in the street with her friends. They invited me to hung around in the city. I followed them because I am a loner.

It was fun. It was super fun. Then we split up. Before we part away, I ask her out for a coffee date. I don't tell her reasons. ( Tbh, I stutter a lot .)

And she said "" Just us."" To that, I got nervous and said that you can bring your friends. I don't want her to feel nervous or afraid.


Her friend help me plan a date. It is not A date but I want to call it that way. 

The day is in Friday, 4 pm. 


She will bring 2 friends with her. They are both my childhood friend as well.

I just don't know what to do. What to say. Where to start.

I love her. I lover her so much that I think about her everyday. I knew her since I was a child.

Everytime, I see her my heart froze. She wasn't the prettiest girl in the world but she was breath taking to me. Her eyes. Her voice. 

I am such a coward.

I just hope the date went well. I just hope, I can apologize to her. I just hope, I can keep communicating with her. She was my first love and last.

AIO to call this an emotional affair... My husband and I had been together a few years and lived separately. To clarify we were a serious couple but didn't live together yet. This was before we married. 

There was a woman who lived a few doors down who had a son his kids age and the kids played together. 

The neighbor lady was a single mom blond and very attractive and all of the sudden started to take an interest in my husband. She would run over to his house often... Talking to him for over a half hour in his driveway... She just always seemed to want him to help with something. Or she'd drop by and knock and have something from her garden to give him. Then when she dropped the item off they would keep talking for a long time.. She would always be wearing skimpy, skin tight clothing (and I noticed my husband checking her body out...)

She would invite him to singing get togethers at her house, which he never went to.. He just ignored. After a while I began to think she is coming over taking too much of an interest in him and he is not shutting anything down.. He is talking to her for long periods... Etc.

I found out after she invited him inside  for coffee at her house before I met my husband...

Anyhow she was always around ...

Eventually she moved and I told him how I felt. I feel bad for not talking to him while she was still around... I felt kind of embarrassed I guess or thought maybe I was overreacting... But whatever it was with her just felt inappropriate. I think she was coming around for attention from him. 

Anyhow I guess I was feeling triggered by this because there's a new neighbor at our new house, attractive, walks by our house with sports bra and leggings... And I told my husband how I felt that it reminded me of the previous neighbor lady... I said in the heat of the moment to him that with the other neighbor it felt like an emotional affair... And he denied this saying it was not..

So I guess my question is, was his relationship with the first neighbor lady inappropriate? I feel like he should have made himself less available to her as he's in a relationship? Even if he wasn't interested in her should he have acted differently at all? ",2,1744822990.0,AmIOverreacting,38,1.0,False

1k0pf2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/cleanbeauty/comments/1k0pf2v/personal_epiphany_seeking_mentor_or_feedback/,"Personal Epiphany, Seeking Mentor or Feedback.","Personal Epiphany, Seeking Mentor!

WARNING: This post will probably be too long, and hard to read because I'm so excited - I'm  just getting my thoughts out before I burst. I wanted to share them with SOMEONE, but every time I share with my family, my goals end up never getting achieved or it just blows up in my face (I can't take their rejection or criticism). If I can share with other like minded individuals I can get insight, appreciation, and feedback to help instead of hinder my passion.

BACKGROUND: When I was in high school I wanted to be like all those makeup influencers I  used to watch on YouTube. I wanted to be an artist, and make people feel beautiful, giving them confidence that some couldn't get on their own. The idea was shut down, and I was told that ""it wasn't a realistic career"", so I stopped that dream.

Fast forward, I'm getting older, 34 this year - I've taken and still am taking courses to develope different skills (Horticulture, Herbalism, and Esthetics - because I still enjoy it). It's been hard to hone into a career idea until recently. This past month I've been practicing my Hort. & Herbalism skills by collecting Populus balsamifera buds (containing salicylates) with the intention to make an oil infusion to use in anti-aging skin care. I initially wanted to create medicinal products but in Ontario, Canada there's more red tape and fees associated with natural health products than cosmetics or food and beverage. At least with cosmetics/food/bev. I can start somewhere.

THE EPIPHANY: Herbal Cosmetics. When I first started my plant journey with Guelph University, I did it for myself as a modality for therapy. Then learning plant ID, I dove into the world of edible, medicinal, and toxic plants. Now I'm knee deep into my love for herbalism with the help of Wild Rose College. The catch, I don't personally use cosmetics all that much because I have hormonal problems (PCOS) so my body struggles to metabolize synthetic products, and they easily disrupt my endocrine system. 

I thought about it, that maybe I could create cosmetics that use the natural ingredients I go out and source myself, or grow, or purchase from local merchants, and it would still stay in line with my crunchy herbalist, and horticultural self, while also appealing to my inner child as the artist she never became.

MY CURRENT PROJECT: Balsam Poplar buds infused in Grapeseed oil. Balsam Poplar buds contain salicylates which break down into Salycylic Acid. I plan on using both folk methods (to maintain my promise to being as natural as possible) as well as scientific methods of testing the potency of SA in the oil. I've done three different ratios, and I plan to harvest more buds for a glycerin and alcohol type of extraction (I do know that alcohol is drying - but it is the best form of extraction method for the constituents I want). I plan to use the oil for serums, oil cleansers, and lotion/creams. My focus is anti-aging so I chose other oils to mix (Frankincense, Geranium, Rosehip, etc.). As for the glycerite or alcohol tinctures I plan to use those in toners.

FUTURE GOALS: While my focus is on natural skincare products, I also have plans to create natural plant pigments to turn into pressed powders for eyeshadow, blush, and highlighter. I also want to use oil and water for foundation, lipsticks/gloss, etc.

Eventually, I hope to open my own shop as an apothecary and provide not only natural, plant based cosmetics, but herbal medicines, beverages and consumables. I saw a video about 10 years ago - a Charles of the Ritz beauty counter where the client watches pressed powders being formulated in front of them. I would love to find a Charles of the Ritz Powder Press like the one in the video.

FEEDBACK: To the professionals already in the industry - where do I start. I have strong will, I have the idea, and I have my fianc√©'s full support. I want my ingredients including waxes, emulsifiers, preservatives as natural as possible. I am willing to share my big ideas with a mentor if they reach out, I just need a little guidance. My dreams have been tucked away for so long, my fianc√© has encouraged me to be who I am and say f*** you to the non-believers. So here I am, help. Please. Lol. 
 
- Any suggestions as to where to start with education in my particular niche? I was considering Formula Botanica courses.
- What's an emulsifier, and how does it work? Lol I understand from what I read that it combines water and oil, but real life examples help me understand better. 
- Powder presses? I heard that some indie makeup creators use coffee tampers or espresso presses? I'd love a Charles of the Ritz vintage press but I can't find one anywhere.
- Supplies, best wholesale for natural ingredients? 
- ADVICE! Am I delusional for wanting to do this?

I feel like the beauty industry will always be big, and there may still be room for me...?

If you've read this whole post, thank you. I appreciate you. Like I stated, I just needed to get it out. I don't want to ruin my excitement by getting criticism from someone so close to me. That's a whole other ball of wax...

We hooked up on our first date, and what started as something casual made me believe he was ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù I was young and didn‚Äôt realize at the time that he was love-bombing me. To be fair, we were never in an official relationship, just a situationship.

Three months in, I found out that he had hidden his Instagram stories from me while he was out of town for a work project. When I confronted him, he brushed it off, saying, ‚ÄúIt just happened, don‚Äôt overthink.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt a one-time thing. He constantly gaslit and manipulated me, making me feel like I was the problem telling me I overreacted and overthought everything.

On New Year‚Äôs, I got him a Chanel perfume, and he gave me a Pandora bracelet that was clearly oxidized and old. When I asked if it was used, he denied it, so I just let it go. There were nights I stayed over at his place, and instead of spending time with me, he‚Äôd leave to meet his friends, saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm obligated.‚Äù

But the worst part was my 22nd birthday. He never called or texted me to say happy birthday. When I told him how hurt I was, he simply said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I forgot. I just don‚Äôt celebrate birthdays.‚Äù

Things only got worse from there. He stopped texting me, always saying he was busy and stressed. When I tried to comfort him, he would get mad at me for no reason. By April 2022, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I texted him, saying, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just end this,‚Äù and all he said was ‚Äúok.‚Äù

Two weeks before that, we had barely spoken because I was struggling and just needed him to be there for me. Instead, all I got was, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be there all the time. I need my space too. You‚Äôre not a child anymore.‚Äù

At one point, I asked him directly, ‚ÄúDo you ever want me to be your girlfriend?‚Äù and his response was, ‚ÄúI like how things are now.‚Äù

however, there are many problems. when i return from these protests, i feel worse, more angry and hopeless than what i felt before i attended.

1. it is disorganized. in the sense that the last one was four hours long and everyone left to go to the bathroom, get lunch, get coffee, etc. the lines for the bathrooms were long as fuck. and it is hard to hear the speakers.
2. the speakers. if we are out there just to listen to who is speaking, then who is speaking must MATTER. who is out here speaking? dana nessel spoke at the last one. she had the worst content in the speech, but i can't even say she had the worst speech. i just hated every word she said, but at least she said it eloquently and with passion rather than reading from the notesapp that was written at 3a last night. is this really what the movement is about?? my favorite speech was tranny reclamation and land acknowledgement. but again, it was hard to hear for like 90% and i had to leave to use the bathroom at one point.
3. objective. what is the objective?

YOUNG PEOPLE WON'T TURN OUT IF THERE IS NO MEANINGFUL OBJECTIVE.

I won't turn up to the next one because what did we do last time?? We marched around the capitol building at 4:30p.... after more than half of the original crowd had already left! I didn't even march, what is the point?

OBJECTIVES THAT WILL DRAW YOUNG PEOPLE: ACTUAL DISRUPTIVE ACTION! you know, a PROTEST!

WAYS TO KEEP US THERE: have coffee and snacks. and get people to speak from the heart, not just neoliberal ppl who are just rattling off statistics at us. Yes, this is a dig at the guy who went up before the land acknowledgment to say ""hey im w 50501 this is my first time doing this here is my speech"" and proceeded to give a heartless cold read of news headlines with numbers and bullshit. We alr know that shit bruv! That's why we're here! We wanna fucking stop it not be reminded of it OK??!!

Fully prepared to get shit on over this. idc. I don't have fucking anywhere else to put this.

We have needed the 50501 protests to match the energy we have seen in the student protests. If 50501 doesn't change from what it has been, the 50501 movement will dissolve as a transparent neoliberal distraction.

Scrap from my memo:  just as it was about to be a good carefree coffee date with fam, well‚Ä¶ sth happened, you see‚Ä¶ my parents and I don‚Äôt get along well with each other because of how biased they are and how detached I am. I grow up alone in my zone all alone, No hand to hold, no place to call home. I walked through the dark, with no light to guide,Hiding the pain I could never confide.I learned to be strong, though broken inside, Living in silence, with nowhere to hide. Alone in my thoughts, where shadows are grown,Still, I carry on, in my zone, all alone. 
my parents have built this pseudo image of me and trying to project that ideal slaved like mindless NPC into their head and onto me, I refused to be that, I refused to be a punching bag even though my every fabric of living souls is somehow like this and it has been like this for my whole years of living. So I moved out‚Ä¶ Every breath that I took spelt ‚Äúunease‚Äù to me as if I was breathing the air that carries the fracture of filaments of broken glasses into it.. I don‚Äôt know where to begin, and maybe that says enough on its own. Every time I try to gather the right words, they dissolve in my throat like  even the smallest attempt to express myself gets swallowed by the same void I keep falling into. I‚Äôve been surviving for so long that I‚Äôve forgotten what it means to live, and honestly‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I ever truly knew. The kind of life I live isn‚Äôt a life at all but a constant rotation of emotional bruises, chaos, exhaustion, and silence so thick I can barely hear my own thoughts anymore. It‚Äôs emptiness and numbness, the void the abyssal silence, isolation I have built around me has overly consumed my whole already, that‚Äôs why I keep silent and would love to hear other people‚Äôs achievements and their dreams and their projects and aslo hobbies. It makes me feel alive  to hear that, even just a tiny bits. Temporary serotonin dos√©.  It‚Äôs always the same script: I wake up tired, I go to sleep even more tired 3-4 hours of sleep sometimes less, and somewhere in between, I carry the weight of responsibilities that were never mine to bear. I take care of everything. Every. Single. Thing. And no one notices. No one stops to ask if I‚Äôm okay, not really. And I don‚Äôt mind not care anymore, im only human you know. But yet I keep everything to myself, there‚Äôs no point in venting nor complaining about it but since you shared so much about yourself, I guess I should return the favor. And most would  assume I‚Äôll just keep going. That I‚Äôll carry the emotional baggage, cook the meals, clean the messes, absorb the insults, and wear a smile  at work at my own business through it all. Living alone sounds peaceful but yet‚Ä¶ My home doesn‚Äôt feel like a home but instead it‚Äôs a trap, a place I‚Äôve been conditioned to stay small, stay quiet, and stay useful.I‚Äôve never had the freedom to be myself without punishment. The moment I let the mask slip, they strike. Those whisperings they never stopped they lingers, stoicism helps but not  so much at least that‚Äôs the temporary relief for me to get going on my life. I‚Äôm tired. My therapist gave up and all that‚Ä¶ what else I could do, keep pushing yes, keep pushing, I can do everything but yet I‚Äôm so inferior when it comes to solve my own emotional tremors that have left neglected for so long. there‚Äôs this aching loneliness; one that no amount of distractions can touch. I have a small handful of online friends left. That‚Äôs it. And even with them, I feel like I‚Äôm slowly fading into the background, like I‚Äôve become too dull, too quiet, too burdensome to keep around. Lately, it feels like every time I reach out even a little, some might pulls away. If I asked once how they feel when people open up to them, and they would likely disappear behind distance. That answer was enough, I guess in my intuitive thoughts. No one wants to hear what I carry. No one does. It‚Äôs a waste of time and we all have each one‚Äôs struggled afterall. Still unable to breathe freely or go anywhere without fear. The thought of building a future feels laughable. I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôd build it on. Everything I once hoped for ‚Äúthe quiet life, the small happiness, a partner who truly sees me‚Äù, it all turned to ash in my hands. A big wishing thinking, a delusion. I don't even remember the sound of my own dreams anymore.
What hurts most is how invisible I‚Äôve become. I could scream into a mirror and it wouldn‚Äôt matter. I could disappear and I‚Äôm not sure anyone in this house would notice until something needed to be done. I try to stay strong. I really do. But some days, I just want to fall apart quietly. Let the world forget me like everyone else already has. 

Anyway that is quite embarrassing enough rant for my first post.

I moved to the Bay 1.5 years ago with my Husband. We lived in Italy and I am from Central america. People in Europe and Latin america are  very polite, everytime you enter a place such as coffee bar, restaurant, workplace, church, etc. If you run into someone is extremely rude not to say hello  or good morning.  Unfortunately, here is not the case. I work in a shared office and people I have been seen EVERY DAY since we came barely say ""Good morning"", they might be in their 50s, 70s, 20. If I try to make a slight joke, people take it seriously and just do the -.- face. Why are people lacking social skills? these are the very basics!!

1k0pbnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiebeauty/comments/1k0pbnh/personal_epiphany_seeking_mentor/,"Personal Epiphany, Seeking Mentor!","WARNING: This post will probably be too long, and hard to read because I'm so excited - I'm  just getting my thoughts out before I burst. I wanted to share them with SOMEONE, but every time I share with my family, my goals end up never getting achieved or it just blows up in my face (I can't take their rejection or criticism). If I can share with other like minded individuals I can get insight, appreciation, and feedback to help instead of hinder my passion.

BACKGROUND: When I was in high school I wanted to be like all those makeup influencers I  used to watch on YouTube. I wanted to be an artist, and make people feel beautiful, giving them confidence that some couldn't get on their own. The idea was shut down, and I was told that ""it wasn't a realistic career"", so I stopped that dream.

Fast forward, I'm getting older, 34 this year - I've taken and still am taking courses to develope different skills (Horticulture, Herbalism, and Esthetics - because I still enjoy it). It's been hard to hone into a career idea until recently. This past month I've been practicing my Hort. & Herbalism skills by collecting Populus balsamifera buds (containing salicylates) with the intention to make an oil infusion to use in anti-aging skin care. I initially wanted to create medicinal products but in Ontario, Canada there's more red tape and fees associated with natural health products than cosmetics or food and beverage. At least with cosmetics/food/bev. I can start somewhere.

THE EPIPHANY: Herbal Cosmetics. When I first started my plant journey with Guelph University, I did it for myself as a modality for therapy. Then learning plant ID, I dove into the world of edible, medicinal, and toxic plants. Now I'm knee deep into my love for herbalism with the help of Wild Rose College. The catch, I don't personally use cosmetics all that much because I have hormonal problems (PCOS) so my body struggles to metabolize synthetic products, and they easily disrupt my endocrine system. 

I thought about it, that maybe I could create cosmetics that use the natural ingredients I go out and source myself, or grow, or purchase from local merchants, and it would still stay in line with my crunchy herbalist, and horticultural self, while also appealing to my inner child as the artist she never became.

MY CURRENT PROJECT: Balsam Poplar buds infused in Grapeseed oil. Balsam Poplar buds contain salicylates which break down into Salycylic Acid. I plan on using both folk methods (to maintain my promise to being as natural as possible) as well as scientific methods of testing the potency of SA in the oil. I've done three different ratios, and I plan to harvest more buds for a glycerin and alcohol type of extraction (I do know that alcohol is drying - but it is the best form of extraction method for the constituents I want). I plan to use the oil for serums, oil cleansers, and lotion/creams. My focus is anti-aging so I chose other oils to mix (Frankincense, Geranium, Rosehip, etc.). As for the glycerite or alcohol tinctures I plan to use those in toners.

FUTURE GOALS: While my focus is on natural skincare products, I also have plans to create natural plant pigments to turn into pressed powders for eyeshadow, blush, and highlighter. I also want to use oil and water for foundation, lipsticks/gloss, etc.

Eventually, I hope to open my own shop as an apothecary and provide not only natural, plant based cosmetics, but herbal medicines, beverages and consumables. I saw a video about 10 years ago - a Charles of the Ritz beauty counter where the client watches pressed powders being formulated in front of them. I would love to find a Charles of the Ritz Powder Press like the one in the video.

FEEDBACK: To the professionals already in the industry - where do I start. I have strong will, I have the idea, and I have my fianc√©'s full support. I want my ingredients including waxes, emulsifiers, preservatives as natural as possible. I am willing to share my big ideas with a mentor if they reach out, I just need a little guidance. My dreams have been tucked away for so long, my fianc√© has encouraged me to be who I am and say f*** you to the non-believers. So here I am, help. Please. Lol. 
 
- Any suggestions as to where to start with education in my particular niche? I was considering Formula Botanica courses.
- What's an emulsifier, and how does it work? Lol I understand from what I read that it combines water and oil, but real life examples help me understand better. 
- Powder presses? I heard that some indie makeup creators use coffee tampers or espresso presses? I'd love a Charles of the Ritz vintage press but I can't find one anywhere.
- Supplies, best wholesale for natural ingredients? 
- ADVICE! Am I delusional for wanting to do this?

I feel like the beauty industry will always be big, and there may still be room for me...?

If you've read this whole post, thank you. I appreciate you. Like I stated, I just needed to get it out. I don't want to ruin my excitement by getting criticism from someone so close to me. That's a whole other ball of wax...

Jasper wasn‚Äôt sure what time it was‚Äîjust that it was ‚Äútoo early‚Äù in a way only the body knows. He sat up in bed, every vertebra protesting the movement like an unpaid intern. The air felt wrong: thick, buzzing, alive in a way that suggested it was considering a career in sentient malevolence.

He blinked at the ceiling, which blinked back.

The hum, low and accusatory, oozed from the kitchen. Not a mechanical hum. No, this was a judgmental frequency. Jasper swung his legs off the bed with the air of a man preparing for battle and stood, barefoot on the cold tile. Each step to the kitchen felt like a negotiation with reality.

The fridge greeted him with a sulk.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say goodnight,‚Äù it said.

Jasper closed one eye, then the other, in a failed attempt to reset the day. ‚ÄúIt was two in the morning. I was drunk, and you were... humming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was grieving,‚Äù the fridge replied. ‚ÄúYour failure to refill the Brita filter was a betrayal of trust. We had a system.‚Äù

Jasper rubbed his temples. ‚ÄúWe also had leftover Thai. Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre the victim.‚Äù

The fridge opened its door with slow, offended drama, illuminating Jasper‚Äôs face like a noir interrogation. Tupperware glowed like radioactive artifacts. Somewhere in the back, a pickle jar gurgled ominously.

‚ÄúYou think this is funny?‚Äù the fridge asked.

‚ÄúNo. I think it‚Äôs tragic. I think I‚Äôm losing my mind, and my kitchen appliances have unionized in protest.‚Äù

The coffee maker gurgled in agreement. A spoon clattered in solidarity.

Jasper exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all so emotionally available now.‚Äù

Silence. Then, from the hallway, a soft voice: ‚ÄúThe toaster‚Äôs crying again.‚Äù

He turned. The toaster sat under a dish towel, shuddering softly. Crumbs spilled like secrets. A therapy lamp flickered behind it.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on,‚Äù Jasper whispered.

No one answered.

Outside, the world hadn‚Äôt ended‚Äîyet‚Äîbut it had certainly taken a sabbatical. Streetlights blinked with hesitation. The sun, if it existed anymore, was off-screen. He hadn‚Äôt seen a bird in weeks. And the loop‚Äîyes, that thing he couldn‚Äôt quite name‚Äîwas still circling the edge of his memory like a lazy shark.

He closed the fridge door gently.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start over,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù

The fridge hummed, this time in something close to forgiveness.",2,1744822291.0,writers,1,1.0,False

1k0p5qh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k0p5qh/loving_girlfriend_of_2_years_suddenly_downgraded/,Loving girlfriend of 2 years suddenly downgraded our relationship to friends with benefits,"essentially the title, I‚Äôve (19) been in a relationship with my girlfriend (18) for a little over two years now. While we‚Äôve had a few ups and downs (like every teenage couple) our relationship has always been in my opinion very healthy and strong. over the last several weeks I have noticed her be slightly more distant, but all in all things (at least in my opinion) we were still doing very well up until very recently.

fast-forward to last Friday which was her birthday. She made plans with her closest friend for the entire day in such a way that I would not really get to see her. I still was able to come by her house and drop off her present, but the whole situation felt weird. I took her out the day after, saturday, to celebrate her birthday and to try to iron out any miscommunications or grievances either of us were having. She was open with me about the fact that she‚Äôs going through a lot both at home and working her two jobs (she graduated high school early and has been working at two local restaurants/cafes since then). I tried to be supportive and told her that I understood how she felt and that I was here for her in whatever capacity she needed. she then went on a brief overnight trip for the weekend with her family on Sunday and Monday. Despite thinking that everything had been ironed out we argued about different things back-and-forth on Sunday and early in the day on Monday. Sometime in the afternoon on Monday I told her that I didn‚Äôt feel like things were right and wanted to have some sort of conference call style conversation about working things out to which she said ok. After talking on the phone for a long while, she eventually steered the conversation in the direction of wanting to take a break. She told me that she was young and she wasn‚Äôt sure she was ready to commit herself to me so early, and that she wanted time to figure out who she was as a person. she went on to say that she had a lot going on in her life and a number of personal problems and maturing to do. I told her that I thought we could work things out together but she said she needed space and time and wasn‚Äôt interested. this came out of left field for me. I knew that there were a few things that needed to be fixed but nothing we were disagreeing about was any more serious than anything we‚Äôd gotten through in the past.

on Tuesday I spent most of the day talking to her and trying to express the sentiment that I thought whatever she was going through in her personal life we could work through together and that I wanted to be there for her no matter what. I spent a lot of the day coming at her argument from different angles trying to find a way forward that would work for both of us, but in the end she just told me that she was tired of explaining herself and needed space. that said, she also told me that she very much wanted me to remain a part of her life and that she wanted to remain a part of mine. We went on to discuss what that would even look like, and essentially what I got from her was that she still is in love with me and wants to continue spending time with me and talking to me (and even sleeping with me) but that she wants the title and freedom associated with being single. My take away from the conversation was that she wants to continue spending time with me and not drift apart, but also to not have an obligation to me as her partner. She told me that she would be allowed to see other people but that she didn‚Äôt want to, and I was entitled to the same thing.

I believe her when she says she still loves me very much and wants a future with me at some point, but I don‚Äôt know how to handle this situation in the meantime. From what I gather she essentially wants us to maintain the relationship we already had, just without any implied obligations or commitment to each other. I tend to believe her when she says she doesn‚Äôt want to see anyone else since she‚Äôs never done anything remotely suspicious as far as cheating is concerned (and I think she wants to just **have** that freedom even if she doesn‚Äôt use it, since she hasn‚Äôt had it in her adult life before). My main concern is that I don‚Äôt understand why she would make the concession of giving me that option if she didn‚Äôt want it for herself.

i‚Äôm supposed to see her tomorrow to get coffee and walk around a park, and really the advice I‚Äôm looking for is what I should or shouldn‚Äôt say. she is so deeply in distress about this situation but also maintains that it is the right decision for her. I want to tell her that I‚Äôm worried about how vulnerable she is right now and I want to warn her about people potentially trying to take advantage of her. I don‚Äôt know how to do this without seeming manipulative. Obviously I think the best thing for her is to get back with me and let us work these things out together, but I don‚Äôt want to force that on her. I also don‚Äôt know how long or to what extent I‚Äôll be able to stay around for her if that‚Äôs what she wants. if she needs a month to work things out on her own I would be willing to give that to her, but I cannot sit around for a year clinging to the chance of having a future with her. 

I know she‚Äôs young (so am I) and confused, I just don‚Äôt know where exactly I fit into this at this point. I very seriously want things to work out between us but I don‚Äôt know what the future of our relationship looks like at this point. I don‚Äôt even know what the next week is supposed to look like in all honesty. My first inclination was to fight for the survival of our relationship, but that isnt what she wants. My second inclination is now to back off entirely and give her all the space she could want and hope she comes back to me on her own, but she has expressed that that isn‚Äôt what she wants either. if anyone has any tips about how to navigate this or has anything they think I should say (or not say) to her tomorrow, any advice is appreciated. if you actually read this far thank you so much.",1,1744822152.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

Sleepless nights and stubborn pounds‚Äîsounds like a recipe for frustration, doesn‚Äôt it?

üí§

# Personal Experience (Charl‚Äôs Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give¬†Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic¬†a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest‚Äîsomething she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve actually been falling asleep faster,‚Äù she said, sounding genuinely surprised. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!‚Äù

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift‚Äînot just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn‚Äôt entirely sold on the taste. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea‚Äîan earthy kick I didn‚Äôt expect.‚Äù While the flavor wasn‚Äôt a dealbreaker for her, it‚Äôs something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, ‚ÄúIf it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won‚Äôt need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!‚Äù Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

it‚Äôs a convenient choice for overall wellness support. Based on its versatility, value for money and benefits, I‚Äôd rate it a¬†**4 out of 5**. Make sure you¬†**only buy from the official website**, Amazon etc. may have counterfeits.

Another greens supplement that I like is¬†**YourBiology Super greens**, which is also worth checking out.

In my opinion, here‚Äôs what I think you can expect with Nagano:

**Potential Benefits**

1. **Metabolism and Weight Management Support**¬†The¬†*Nutrient Dense Natural Herbs and Extracts*¬†section includes ingredients like green tea extract, cinnamon, and bitter melon, all of which are popular for their metabolism-boosting and blood sugar-regulating effects.¬†**Green tea extract**, in particular, is known for EGCG, a compound linked to fat oxidation.¬†**Cinnamon**¬†can help keep blood sugar in check, which might help with cravings. These ingredients don‚Äôt work magic on their own, but they can be a nice addition if you‚Äôre also focusing on diet and exercise.
2. **Antioxidant and Immune Support**¬†The¬†*Super Food Greens and Antioxidant Blend*¬†provides a variety of fruits and vegetables, which means a good range of antioxidants. Ingredients like¬†**blueberry, cranberry, and camu camu**¬†are packed with Vitamin C and other antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress. This can support overall immunity, which is a plus if you‚Äôre someone who gets run down easily.¬†**Alfalfa leaf**¬†in the¬†*Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic*¬†supports healthy blood sugar and has calming effects that enhance focus and wellness.
3. **Digestive Health**¬†With both¬†**prebiotics (like inulin) and probiotics (like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains),**¬†this tonic could support gut health, which can be a big factor in weight management and overall wellness.¬†**From my experience, a good probiotic blend can help reduce bloating and improve digestion**, though the effectiveness can vary by person. If you struggle with digestive regularity or¬†**feel sluggish after meals**, the¬†**digestive enzymes like bromelain and papain**¬†might also help break down food more efficiently. Also the fiber from¬†**inulin and Digestive complex**¬†would also make you feel fuller for longer.¬†**Also check out this post on Fiber supplements for weight loss.**
4. **Energy and Stress Support**¬†**Ashwagandha and Panax ginseng**¬†are adaptogens known for supporting stress relief and energy. While these effects can take a few weeks to build up, I‚Äôve found that¬†**adaptogens**¬†can really help with mental clarity and energy levels over time, especially if you‚Äôre someone who gets worn out from stress.¬†**Ginger**¬†promotes metabolism and aids in weight loss through thermogenesis, while also helping to¬†**stabilize blood sugar,**¬†which can reduce hunger.¬†**Acerola**, packed with vitamin C and antioxidants, helps curb cravings and provides a natural energy boost.

**Drawbacks**

1. **Flavor and Texture**¬†Based on my experience with similar superfood powders, flavor can be a hit or miss. Sometimes greens blends end up tasting like a grassy, slightly bitter drink, so you might need to mix it into a smoothie with fruits to mask the taste. Be prepared to experiment a bit to find a palatable way to consume it.
2. **Proprietary Blends**¬†Like many products in this category, the label lists the total amount of each blend rather than individual ingredient dosages. It‚Äôs hard to know exactly how much you‚Äôre getting of each ingredient, which can be frustrating if you‚Äôre looking for clinically effective doses. For example, with the green tea extract, you might not be getting the amount of EGCG that some studies link to fat-burning benefits. This isn‚Äôt unique to Nagano, other supplements like athletic greens also do it, but it‚Äôs worth noting if you prefer transparency.
3. **Not a Magic Solution**¬†If you‚Äôre expecting dramatic weight loss or instant energy, keep in mind that no supplement can replace a healthy lifestyle. The¬†*Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic*¬†can complement a balanced diet and regular exercise, but it won‚Äôt make up for poor eating habits or lack of movement. Think of it as an added boost rather than a miracle fix.

**Overall Verdict**

If you‚Äôre already doing the basics (good diet, exercise, hydration), I think this supplement could add some extra benefits in terms of digestion, cravings & appetite suppression, stress support, and possibly metabolism. It‚Äôs also a convenient option if you find it challenging to include enough greens and probiotics in your diet naturally.

Based on everything, I‚Äôd rate it around a¬†**4 out of 5**¬†‚Äî it‚Äôs a well-rounded blend with the potential to enhance your wellness routine, but not necessarily a game-changer on its own.

**Nagano compared with other supergreens powders: Which supergreens powder should you buy?**

**Vs YourBiology Supergreens**

Both the¬†*Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic*¬†and¬†***YourBiology SuperGreens***¬†are designed to enhance overall wellness through a blend of superfoods, digestive aids, and antioxidants. Nagano's formula emphasizes a combination of vitamins, green superfoods, natural herbs, digestive enzymes, and probiotics, aiming to support metabolism, digestion, and immune health.

In contrast, YourBiology SuperGreens offers a comprehensive mix of 24 ingredients, including superfoods like¬†**barley grass, spirulina, and alfalfa**, along with digestive aids such as inulin and probiotics, focusing on boosting energy, digestion, and overall vitality.

For weight loss,¬†*Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic*¬†might be a better fit due to its specific focus on metabolism-boosting ingredients like green tea extract, ginger, and cinnamon, which have thermogenic and blood sugar-stabilizing properties. These ingredients can help increase calorie burn and reduce hunger, supporting weight management.¬†*YourBiology SuperGreens*¬†focuses more on overall energy and vitality, so while it promotes digestive health (which can indirectly support weight management), Nagano‚Äôs formula is more tailored toward direct weight loss benefits.

**Vs Athletic Greens (AG1)**

**Athletic Greens (AG1):**¬†Known for a well-rounded formula, AG1 includes a comprehensive blend of vitamins, minerals, and adaptogens. However, some users are skeptical of its proprietary blend, as it lacks transparency on specific dosages and can feel overhyped given its high price., around $85 per month. In contrast, you can have Nagano for as low as $37 per month with 6 months supply!

**Vs Amazing Grass**

This brand includes greens, probiotics, enzymes, and fiber, which many users appreciate for digestive benefits and improved energy levels. Like Nagano, Amazing Grass is also seen as a cost-effective option with a reputation for transparency, though its taste may not appeal to everyone.

**Vs Garden of Life Perfect Food**

Garden of Life focuses on whole food ingredients and a partially fermented blend, potentially offering enhanced absorption. While its formula is similar to Nagano‚Äôs in antioxidant-rich greens, it lacks some of Nagano‚Äôs unique adaptogens and metabolic-boosting ingredients like green tea extract.

**Vs Red Dragon Nutritionals Greens**

This brand is favored by some users for reducing bloating and improving digestive regularity within a couple of weeks, with users noting it‚Äôs a budget-friendly choice. Nagano offers a broader spectrum of antioxidants, but Red Dragon is popular for its simplicity and noticeable digestive benefits and help with regularity. Nagano‚Äôs benefits are more broad and is specifically designed with weight loss benefits in mind.

**Vs Thorne Greens**

Thorne‚Äôs greens formula includes¬†**matcha for a small caffeine boost**, which some users enjoy, though the stimulant effect may not be ideal for everyone. While Thorne is geared toward gentle energy enhancement, Nagano has a more diverse ingredient profile focused on metabolism and gut health support.Skip to Navigatio

Jasper wasn‚Äôt sure what time it was‚Äîjust that it was ‚Äútoo early‚Äù in a way only the body knows. He sat up in bed, every vertebra protesting the movement like an unpaid intern. The air felt wrong: thick, buzzing, alive in a way that suggested it was considering a career in sentient malevolence.

He blinked at the ceiling, which blinked back.

The hum, low and accusatory, oozed from the kitchen. Not a mechanical hum. No, this was a judgmental frequency. Jasper swung his legs off the bed with the air of a man preparing for battle and stood, barefoot on the cold tile. Each step to the kitchen felt like a negotiation with reality.

The fridge greeted him with a sulk.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt say goodnight,‚Äù it said.

Jasper closed one eye, then the other, in a failed attempt to reset the day. ‚ÄúIt was two in the morning. I was drunk, and you were... humming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was grieving,‚Äù the fridge replied. ‚ÄúYour failure to refill the Brita filter was a betrayal of trust. We had a system.‚Äù

Jasper rubbed his temples. ‚ÄúWe also had leftover Thai. Don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre the victim.‚Äù

The fridge opened its door with slow, offended drama, illuminating Jasper‚Äôs face like a noir interrogation. Tupperware glowed like radioactive artifacts. Somewhere in the back, a pickle jar gurgled ominously.

‚ÄúYou think this is funny?‚Äù the fridge asked.

‚ÄúNo. I think it‚Äôs tragic. I think I‚Äôm losing my mind, and my kitchen appliances have unionized in protest.‚Äù

The coffee maker gurgled in agreement. A spoon clattered in solidarity.

Jasper exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all so emotionally available now.‚Äù

Silence. Then, from the hallway, a soft voice: ‚ÄúThe toaster‚Äôs crying again.‚Äù

He turned. The toaster sat under a dish towel, shuddering softly. Crumbs spilled like secrets. A therapy lamp flickered behind it.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on,‚Äù Jasper whispered.

No one answered.

Outside, the world hadn‚Äôt ended‚Äîyet‚Äîbut it had certainly taken a sabbatical. Streetlights blinked with hesitation. The sun, if it existed anymore, was off-screen. He hadn‚Äôt seen a bird in weeks. And the loop‚Äîyes, that thing he couldn‚Äôt quite name‚Äîwas still circling the edge of his memory like a lazy shark.

He closed the fridge door gently.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start over,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù

When I first heard about **Cellphone Cash**, I rolled my eyes. Another ""make money online"" promise? Yeah, right. I had been scammed before, and I wasn‚Äôt exactly eager to fall for another too-good-to-be-true product. But curiosity got the best of me ‚Äî and it turned out to be the *best decision I‚Äôve ever made*.

Let me back up and tell you my story.

Just a few months ago, I was drowning. Bills were stacking up, groceries were becoming unaffordable, and my 9-to-5 was barely enough to survive, let alone live. I wanted something more ‚Äî not a Lamborghini, just the freedom to breathe. I was desperate for a way to make even an extra $20 a day. Something to take the pressure off.

Then one night while scrolling through YouTube, I saw someone talking about **Cellphone Cash** ‚Äî a system that claims you can make real money using just your smartphone. No experience. No tech skills. No fluff. I thought, ‚ÄúThis has to be a joke.‚Äù

But something about it felt *different*. The way it was explained wasn‚Äôt hypey. It was realistic. They weren‚Äôt promising millions overnight. They were offering a real method to earn cash ‚Äî small at first, but scalable. I figured, why not? I‚Äôve wasted more money on coffee.

So I bought it.

And my jaw dropped.

# What You Get Inside Cellphone Cash

As soon as I got access, I realized this wasn‚Äôt some PDF file with vague ideas. **Cellphone Cash** is a *step-by-step blueprint*. It‚Äôs like having a mentor walk you through exactly how to turn your phone into a money-making machine.

It starts with the basics ‚Äî showing you how to use your phone to find small income opportunities that pay instantly. Then it ramps up to more advanced methods. The best part? You don‚Äôt need to invest in ads, buy inventory, or beg friends to sign up. It‚Äôs completely self-sufficient.

I couldn‚Äôt believe how practical it was. Everything is broken down into bite-sized videos and tutorials. You can literally follow along while lying in bed or waiting in line.

And guess what? **I made my first $12 within 24 hours**. It felt like winning the lottery ‚Äî not because of the amount, but because it *worked*. For the first time in my life, I saw a real path to financial independence.

# Why Cellphone Cash Works (When Everything Else Fails)

Here‚Äôs why I believe this program works while others fail:

* **It‚Äôs based on real demand**: You‚Äôre not selling junk or chasing random trends. You‚Äôre solving real problems that people are already paying for.
* **You don‚Äôt need followers or a social media presence**: This was HUGE for me. I‚Äôm not an influencer, I hate being on camera, and I didn‚Äôt want to post selfies just to make a few bucks. Cellphone Cash is private. Quiet. Effective.
* **No special skills needed**: If you can use Instagram or browse TikTok, you‚Äôre qualified. The system is beginner-friendly and easy to follow.

They even include templates, apps, and tools that do most of the heavy lifting for you. It‚Äôs plug-and-play.

# My Results After 30 Days

I told myself I‚Äôd give Cellphone Cash 30 days. If it didn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôd move on. But by Day 10, I was hooked.

* Week 1: $46.23 earned (with less than 2 hours a day)
* Week 2: $89.77 earned (as I got faster and better)
* Week 3: $156.52 (I found my rhythm and added a second method)
* Week 4: $204.31 (nearly $700 in my first month)

By the end of the month, I was making **$20‚Äì$30/day consistently**, all from my phone. That‚Äôs $600‚Äì$900/month extra ‚Äî which is literally life-changing if you‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck.

What‚Äôs even better? I wasn‚Äôt hustling 12 hours a day. Most of it was done on the couch, during lunch breaks, or even while watching Netflix. This system respects your time.

# The Hidden Benefit: Confidence

I didn‚Äôt expect this, but one of the biggest changes wasn‚Äôt financial ‚Äî it was emotional. **Cellphone Cash gave me my confidence back.** I stopped feeling helpless. I stopped worrying every time I opened my bank app. I started dreaming again.

I realized I didn‚Äôt need to beg anyone for opportunities. I could create them. With just my phone.

# Is Cellphone Cash a Scam?

Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room.

No. **It‚Äôs NOT a scam.** It doesn‚Äôt promise you the moon. It gives you the shovel to dig your own gold.

But ‚Äî and this is important ‚Äî **you have to follow the steps**. It‚Äôs not magic. If you buy it and expect to become a millionaire by tomorrow without doing anything, don‚Äôt bother.

But if you‚Äôre ready to invest a little time each day into something real, something simple, something proven ‚Äî then this is the opportunity you‚Äôve been waiting for.

# Who Should Buy This?

If any of these sound like you, then Cellphone Cash is *made for you*:

* You‚Äôre tired of being broke and want a side income.
* You have a smartphone and internet access.
* You don‚Äôt want to deal with customer service or selling.
* You need flexible, on-the-go income that fits your schedule.
* You‚Äôre DONE wasting time on apps that pay pennies.

# Final Verdict ‚Äì 10/10

I never thought I‚Äôd say this, but **Cellphone Cash changed my life**. It‚Äôs not just a course ‚Äî it‚Äôs a new way of thinking, living, and earning. It‚Äôs proof that you don‚Äôt need fancy degrees, big investments, or a massive social following to create income.

You just need the *right method*. And this is it.

So, if you‚Äôre still reading this and wondering if you should try it ‚Äî **YES, you should**. Take the leap. You owe it to yourself. Even if you‚Äôre skeptical like I was, give it a shot.

What if this is the one that finally works?

I‚Äôll leave you with this: *Your phone is already costing you money every month. Why not use it to make money instead?*

1k0ozn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aliner/comments/1k0ozn0/cellphone_cash_reviews_and_complaints_an_honest/,Cellphone Cash Reviews and ComplaintS:~ An Honest Customer 2025 Review!,"I‚Äôll be honest with you. When I first heard about **Cellphone Cash**, I rolled my eyes. Another ""make money online"" promise? Yeah, right. I had been scammed before, and I wasn‚Äôt exactly eager to fall for another too-good-to-be-true product. But curiosity got the best of me ‚Äî and it turned out to be the *best decision I‚Äôve ever made*.

Let me back up and tell you my story.

Just a few months ago, I was drowning. Bills were stacking up, groceries were becoming unaffordable, and my 9-to-5 was barely enough to survive, let alone live. I wanted something more ‚Äî not a Lamborghini, just the freedom to breathe. I was desperate for a way to make even an extra $20 a day. Something to take the pressure off.

Then one night while scrolling through YouTube, I saw someone talking about **Cellphone Cash** ‚Äî a system that claims you can make real money using just your smartphone. No experience. No tech skills. No fluff. I thought, ‚ÄúThis has to be a joke.‚Äù

But something about it felt *different*. The way it was explained wasn‚Äôt hypey. It was realistic. They weren‚Äôt promising millions overnight. They were offering a real method to earn cash ‚Äî small at first, but scalable. I figured, why not? I‚Äôve wasted more money on coffee.

So I bought it.

And my jaw dropped.

# What You Get Inside Cellphone Cash

As soon as I got access, I realized this wasn‚Äôt some PDF file with vague ideas. **Cellphone Cash** is a *step-by-step blueprint*. It‚Äôs like having a mentor walk you through exactly how to turn your phone into a money-making machine.

It starts with the basics ‚Äî showing you how to use your phone to find small income opportunities that pay instantly. Then it ramps up to more advanced methods. The best part? You don‚Äôt need to invest in ads, buy inventory, or beg friends to sign up. It‚Äôs completely self-sufficient.

I couldn‚Äôt believe how practical it was. Everything is broken down into bite-sized videos and tutorials. You can literally follow along while lying in bed or waiting in line.

And guess what? **I made my first $12 within 24 hours**. It felt like winning the lottery ‚Äî not because of the amount, but because it *worked*. For the first time in my life, I saw a real path to financial independence.

# Why Cellphone Cash Works (When Everything Else Fails)

Here‚Äôs why I believe this program works while others fail:

* **It‚Äôs based on real demand**: You‚Äôre not selling junk or chasing random trends. You‚Äôre solving real problems that people are already paying for.
* **You don‚Äôt need followers or a social media presence**: This was HUGE for me. I‚Äôm not an influencer, I hate being on camera, and I didn‚Äôt want to post selfies just to make a few bucks. Cellphone Cash is private. Quiet. Effective.
* **No special skills needed**: If you can use Instagram or browse TikTok, you‚Äôre qualified. The system is beginner-friendly and easy to follow.

They even include templates, apps, and tools that do most of the heavy lifting for you. It‚Äôs plug-and-play.

# My Results After 30 Days

I told myself I‚Äôd give Cellphone Cash 30 days. If it didn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôd move on. But by Day 10, I was hooked.

* Week 1: $46.23 earned (with less than 2 hours a day)
* Week 2: $89.77 earned (as I got faster and better)
* Week 3: $156.52 (I found my rhythm and added a second method)
* Week 4: $204.31 (nearly $700 in my first month)

By the end of the month, I was making **$20‚Äì$30/day consistently**, all from my phone. That‚Äôs $600‚Äì$900/month extra ‚Äî which is literally life-changing if you‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck.

What‚Äôs even better? I wasn‚Äôt hustling 12 hours a day. Most of it was done on the couch, during lunch breaks, or even while watching Netflix. This system respects your time.

# The Hidden Benefit: Confidence

I didn‚Äôt expect this, but one of the biggest changes wasn‚Äôt financial ‚Äî it was emotional. **Cellphone Cash gave me my confidence back.** I stopped feeling helpless. I stopped worrying every time I opened my bank app. I started dreaming again.

I realized I didn‚Äôt need to beg anyone for opportunities. I could create them. With just my phone.

# Is Cellphone Cash a Scam?

Let‚Äôs address the elephant in the room.

No. **It‚Äôs NOT a scam.** It doesn‚Äôt promise you the moon. It gives you the shovel to dig your own gold.

But ‚Äî and this is important ‚Äî **you have to follow the steps**. It‚Äôs not magic. If you buy it and expect to become a millionaire by tomorrow without doing anything, don‚Äôt bother.

But if you‚Äôre ready to invest a little time each day into something real, something simple, something proven ‚Äî then this is the opportunity you‚Äôve been waiting for.

# Who Should Buy This?

If any of these sound like you, then Cellphone Cash is *made for you*:

* You‚Äôre tired of being broke and want a side income.
* You have a smartphone and internet access.
* You don‚Äôt want to deal with customer service or selling.
* You need flexible, on-the-go income that fits your schedule.
* You‚Äôre DONE wasting time on apps that pay pennies.

# Final Verdict ‚Äì 10/10

I never thought I‚Äôd say this, but **Cellphone Cash changed my life**. It‚Äôs not just a course ‚Äî it‚Äôs a new way of thinking, living, and earning. It‚Äôs proof that you don‚Äôt need fancy degrees, big investments, or a massive social following to create income.

You just need the *right method*. And this is it.

So, if you‚Äôre still reading this and wondering if you should try it ‚Äî **YES, you should**. Take the leap. You owe it to yourself. Even if you‚Äôre skeptical like I was, give it a shot.

What if this is the one that finally works?

I‚Äôll leave you with this: *Your phone is already costing you money every month. Why not use it to make money instead?*

1k0oyrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1k0oyrf/whats_up_with_ghosting_these_days/,What's up with ghosting these days?,"Hi. I had a couple of experiences recently that bothered me. First one, I went on a first date with a guy recently, it went well I think, there was flirting and some light touching, we even kissed at the end. A couple days later I message asking if he was interested in a second date he said yes and told me when he was available. I got back to him and he never replied after that. A few days later I'm like what happened as I didn't hear back, and he said he had to work - and I got back and said ok and kinda just left it at that. We haven't spoken since. Another experience was I spoke to a guy on an online app recently, he told me he was interested, similar age and background so we exchanged numbers. The following day I texted him saying we should go for a coffee or something and he replied sure he'd be down. So I got excited and said sure how about later this week? Guess what, he didn't reply. 
I just don't understand why people think it's ok to ghost.  People describe me as friendly and nice, and look wise I don't think I'm that bad. I just don't know why I'm bothered so much by this phenomenon of ghosting. Seems so disrespectful to me. Thoughts? Just some info I'm a 45 yr old gay male.

I‚Äôve wasted so much money over the years on dental products that promised the world and delivered absolutely nothing. From fancy toothpaste to expensive mouthwashes and even whitening strips that burned my gums ‚Äì nothing ever gave me that *fresh, clean, healthy smile* I was craving.

But then I discovered **ProDentim**, and everything changed.

# The Struggle Before ProDentim

My oral health was a nightmare.

Bleeding gums, bad breath no matter how much I brushed, tooth sensitivity, and a feeling like my mouth was never clean. I brushed twice a day. I flossed. I even used a tongue scraper. Still ‚Äì my gums stayed inflamed, and my dentist kept hinting at early gum disease.

[**‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://da4d14kk28zqdy5m5ie0peob5c.hop.clickbank.net)

And don‚Äôt even get me started on the **dental bills**. Every visit was hundreds of dollars, and I felt like I was constantly fighting a losing battle.

The worst part? I felt embarrassed. I‚Äôd cover my mouth when I laughed. I avoided smiling in pictures. I lost confidence, and it affected my social life and self-esteem.

I knew something had to change.

# The Turning Point ‚Äì Discovering ProDentim

I came across ProDentim while researching natural solutions for oral health. I noticed thousands of 5-star reviews. Real people claiming it saved their gums, whitened their teeth, eliminated bad breath, and even improved their digestion.

At first, I thought ‚Äì *""No way. A probiotic for your teeth? Sounds too good to be true.""*

But then I read how ProDentim works.

Unlike other oral products that destroy both *bad* and *good* bacteria in your mouth (yes, that includes some mouthwashes!), **ProDentim uses 3.5 billion CFUs of good bacteria** to restore the natural microbiome in your mouth. That‚Äôs the community of helpful bacteria that actually *protects* your gums and teeth.

That clicked for me.

I realized I‚Äôd been killing my mouth‚Äôs natural defenses for years with harsh chemicals ‚Äì and ProDentim was offering a totally different, *smarter* solution.

So I gave it a shot.

# My Experience ‚Äì Week by Week Results

# Week 1: Fresh Breath & A Cleaner Feeling

I started taking one tablet every morning, letting it dissolve slowly in my mouth as recommended.

By the *third day*, I noticed something. My mouth felt cleaner *longer*. My breath was fresher throughout the day. I even asked my husband, and he agreed ‚Äì no more morning breath!

That alone felt like a win.

# Week 2: Gum Relief and No More Bleeding

This was the week that shocked me. My gums had been bleeding during brushing for *years*. Suddenly ‚Äì no more blood. The inflammation started to calm down. They weren‚Äôt as red or puffy. And flossing wasn‚Äôt painful anymore.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I hadn‚Äôt changed anything else in my routine ‚Äì just added ProDentim.

# Week 4: Brighter Smile, Stronger Teeth

I started noticing my teeth looked *whiter*. Not like artificial, bleached white ‚Äì but a healthy, natural brightness. Even my coffee stains were fading. My sensitivity reduced too, and I could eat ice cream again without wincing.

Every time I looked in the mirror, I smiled bigger.

# Week 6 and Beyond: A Complete Transformation

After about 6 weeks, my mouth health felt completely reborn. My dentist noticed too during my next cleaning. He asked me what I was doing differently ‚Äì because my gums looked amazing, and there was almost no plaque buildup.

The best part? I feel **more confident than ever**. I laugh freely. I smile in every picture. I talk to people up close without second-guessing myself.

# Why ProDentim Works ‚Äì The Secret Behind the Success

Here‚Äôs what sets ProDentim apart:

* ‚úÖ **3.5 Billion CFUs of Targeted Probiotics** ‚Äì These strains are specifically chosen to support gum health, fresh breath, and strong teeth.
* ‚úÖ **Clinically Proven Ingredients** like *Lactobacillus Paracasei*, *BLIS M-18*, and *Lactobacillus Reuteri* ‚Äì which are backed by science for their oral health benefits.
* ‚úÖ **Natural & Non-GMO Formula** ‚Äì No chemicals, no stimulants, no habit-forming ingredients.
* ‚úÖ **Bonus Benefits** ‚Äì I even noticed better digestion and immunity. Turns out, oral health and gut health are connected!

# What I Love About ProDentim (And You Will Too)

* **It‚Äôs super easy to use** ‚Äì Just one tablet in the morning. No need to change your whole routine.
* **No side effects** ‚Äì I had zero digestive discomfort, and it didn‚Äôt interfere with any medications.
* **Affordable** ‚Äì Compared to dental bills, this is a no-brainer. Plus, they often run discounts on their official site.
* **Risk-free** ‚Äì They offer a 60-day money-back guarantee, so there‚Äôs literally no risk in trying it.

# Who Should Use ProDentim?

If you‚Äôre dealing with:

* Bad breath
* Bleeding or swollen gums
* Tooth sensitivity
* Plaque buildup
* Yellow or stained teeth
* Fear of gum disease or tooth loss

Or if you just want **healthier teeth and a naturally beautiful smile**, **ProDentim is for you**.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì My Only Regret

Honestly, my only regret is not starting ProDentim sooner. I wasted years and hundreds (maybe thousands) of dollars on ineffective solutions, when all I needed was to restore balance in my mouth‚Äôs microbiome.

ProDentim didn‚Äôt just improve my oral health ‚Äì it restored my confidence, improved my social life, and gave me a reason to smile again.

If you're reading this and still on the fence, take it from someone who‚Äôs been there ‚Äì **try ProDentim today.** You‚Äôll be amazed at the transformation.

I dont forget the things I know tho Its just these daily stuff.

Im entering a very important period where Im gonna have finals and stuff and this shit is really affecting me badly. Though I have to say that I am still able to study for hours and learn new things.

I dont consume anything which might be effecting this except a little high screen time and 2 or 3 cups of coffee a day. I also have constantly high blood pressure (15/9) but I dont think it's about that. I've been constantly under huge stress for like more than a year now due to constant personal life problems so I have heard that my cortisol might be spiking and it might be causing all this


And if there is some kind of damage or my brain is getting affected badly from something I am really afraid of leaving permanent damage on something I already have crazy anxiety and thinking about something like this happening really just makes me stress more Its like a downward spiral at this point

I think your worst enemy could be your desesperation. If you act from a scarcity mentality you will accept whatever the system wants to give you even if it is harmful for you dignity or your business which will increase your frustration and stress levels.

There are plenty of work for everyone, but you have to put limits and accept only what is convenient for your business. Set your own standards and stop complaining, have patience, carry your own food, coffee or beverages and see this as if you are going to fishing. Decline, decline and decline whenever is necesary. Because that is the only way the system will understand the message and increase the offers. Dont settle for less.

I know that while others are accepting craps offers, i am giving me the oportunity for getting the reasonables offers for my services.

I never accept less than $7 even if one mile or less. My range of work is 0-7 Miles and ranges of money goes from $7-$30 and take in consideration the following variables: #miles, #of items(no more than 15), shop or delivery, Small or bulky, House or Apt. Hope one day we can create and share a fair algorithm that allow us to accept or decline according the level of service we do.

1k0oe9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/cormacmccarthy/comments/1k0oe9z/ncfom_something_i_noticed_during_the_ed_tom_and/,NCFOM - Something I noticed during the Ed Tom and Uncle Ellis conversation (book & movie),"At the end of No Country for Old Men, Ed Tom is talking to Uncle Ellis. In the movie, whilst standing over the pot of coffee, Ed Tom says: ""I always figured when I got older, God would sort of come into my life somehow. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion of me as he does.""

In the book, as Uncle Ellis is monologuing about the true price people pay for some things he pauses a moment after asking Ed Tom a question (albeit a rhetorical one perhaps) about if he had seen a bargain promise for something or another. After Ellis's question, the book says ""Bell didn't answer."" Then continues with the aforementioned dialogue about God coming into his life, except it's *Uncle Ellis* saying it. Or at least thats how its narrated in the audiobook. Ed Tom then responds ""you don't know what he thinks."" Which is what Ellis says in the movie. 

I guess I'm just curious about the reasoning for this dialogue swap. Or perhaps the Coen brothers missed who actually said it while adapting the screenplay since McCarthy doesn't use quotations and other indicators of who's truly speaking. Them being as skilled as they are I can't imagine it was overlooked tho. I actually prefer Ed Tom saying it, as it adds more depth and a visible dissapointment in his emotion. 

Does anyone have any theory as to why this happened? And has anyone else noticed any other instances where this happened?",7,1744820254.0,cormacmccarthy,4,1.0,False
