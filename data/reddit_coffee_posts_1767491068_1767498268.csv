1q3fces,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1q3fces/i_dream_of_a_womens_only_private_living_community/,I dream of a women’s only private living community,"Salam,

Imagine this:

A private “gated” community with affordable living for single women and single mothers with children (males under 16). A small grocery store and coffee shop just for this community. Private gym, library, green-space, a mini masjid, female security and trades workers/repair workers only internally, and male security outside gates/perimeter. Trusted roommates for those whom share. Everyone is fully documented in the community. There’s so much progress being made with tiny homes, this would be a great project for it.

Think Gilmore girls stars hollow, but all women and children! Bringing back the service trade & village systems. Helps sisters who haven’t married to live alone safely. If you marry, you leave and another sister joins. Single mothers get a safe community help while their children are young. The job opportunities would also be prioritized for teenagers and the single mothers. I could see it already, the young girls delivering Amazon packages on small golf carts. Demand would call for women to get into trades, while it’s AI proof. All other things can be accessed outside of the community so it still contributes to the city. 

The only issue is, how do you have male guests? Unless it’s for those who don’t want male guests and have to leave to see them, which I’m not against. After all, it would be a choice to live here. Also, if this already exists please excuse me!",1,1767498032.0,MuslimCorner,1,1.0,False

1q3f74h,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1q3f74h/is_this_good_writing/,Is this good writing?,"Grady’s didn’t look like much from the outside. It never had.

A tired sign hung crooked over the door, one letter flickering like it had been debating retirement for years and hadn’t found the courage yet. Frosted windows kept the street out and the regulars in. Neon beer logos glowed in red and blue, advertising brands nobody ordered anymore. The kind of place that didn’t appear on anyone’s list of places that mattered. If North Cove had a memory problem, Grady’s was where it went to forget.

Foxfire wrapped around the place like a bad habit. Low buildings. Cracked sidewalks. Storefronts that had changed hands so many times nobody remembered what they’d originally been. The ocean was only a few blocks away, but you wouldn’t know it from the smell. Salt got drowned out by oil, garbage, rust, and something metallic that never quite left the air.

Inside, the bar smelled the way places do when they’ve been standing longer than the people who drink in them—old wood soaked with decades of spills, stale beer baked into the grain, fryer oil that clung to your clothes no matter how many times you washed them. The floor stuck just enough to remind you you’d been there before. Not enough to trip you. Just enough to register.

The lights were dim by design. Nobody wanted to see themselves too clearly in here. The walls were cluttered with things that had once meant something: old concert flyers, yellowed photographs, a cracked mirror behind the bar that made everyone look a little worse than they already felt. The jukebox in the corner hummed low, waiting.

I liked it that way.

Mick Grady stood behind the bar, polishing a glass that didn’t need polishing. He did that when business was slow, which meant he was polishing most nights. Broad shoulders that had never known relaxation. A stiffness in his left knee that showed when he thought no one was looking. Eyes that had seen a stadium full of people cheer his name and then turn on him without hesitation.

“Same?” he asked, not looking up.

“Same,” I said.

He pulled a beer from the fridge, popped the cap, slid it across the bar without spilling a drop. We’d been doing that dance for years. No small talk required. No pretending we were anything other than what we were.

I took a sip. Cold. Clean.

Across the bar, a kid wiped down a table like he was apologizing to it. Nineteen, maybe twenty. All elbows and bad timing. Metallica logo stretched across his T-shirt. Faded. Wherever We May Roam Tour, ’93. The kind you don’t buy new.

“Careful,” Mick muttered without turning around.

“I got it—sorry, Mick,” Chip said, immediately dropping the rag he’d been holding.

The kid glanced my way, caught me looking, then looked down at his shirt like he’d forgotten he was wearing it.

“Nice shirt,” I said.

His face lit up just a little. “Yeah? It was my uncle’s.”

I nodded and took another sip.

On the wall behind the bar hung an old framed newspaper clipping. Mick in his prime. Helmet tucked under one arm. Smile wide enough to sell hope. The headline talked about promise.

They always did.

The jukebox clicked on suddenly. Chip must’ve leaned on it again. Rick Astley’s voice filled the room, cheerful and completely out of place.

I groaned. “Jesus.”

Mick smirked. “Still gets you every time.”

“Got rickrolled once when I was young,” I said. “It’s all been downhill ever since.”

He laughed. Real laughter. Rare thing these days.

The song died off. Silence rushed back in, heavier than before.

I was halfway through my beer when the door opened.

\---

Too clean for Foxfire. That’s what I noticed first.

Button-down shirt that hadn’t been slept in yet. Backpack slung over one shoulder, positioned between him and the room like a shield he didn’t know he was carrying. His eyes found me before he’d finished entering—not searching, finding. Like he’d already known where I’d be sitting.

His hands shook when he adjusted the backpack strap.

Not the casual tremor of cold or caffeine. The kind that comes from holding something too tightly for too long and forgetting how to let go.

He moved to the bar. Each step deliberate. Someone who’d rehearsed this approach but hadn’t counted on his body betraying his intentions.

“You Trip Hunter?” he asked.

His voice was steady. That took effort.

I didn’t answer right away. Took another sip. Let the question hang long enough to get uncomfortable.

“That depends,” I said finally. “Who’s asking?”

“Evan,” he said. “Evan Shaw.”

The name didn’t mean anything to me then.

It would.

He slid onto the stool next to mine. Too close. Like distance might give me time to refuse. He set the backpack on the bar carefully, then pulled it back into his lap. Changed his mind. Set it down again.

Mick stopped polishing.

So did I.

Evan’s eyes moved to the door, then to the window, then back to me. Quick. Practiced. The kind of checking that becomes reflex when you’ve been doing it long enough. When he looked at the jukebox, something tightened in his jaw. Like the music had meaning I couldn’t see yet.

“I’ve been looking for you,” he said quietly.

“Most people don’t,” I said.

He smiled, but it didn’t reach anywhere that mattered. “You worked for the FBI once.”

Not a question. A confirmation.

“Worked,” I said. “Past tense.”

“I know.” He nodded too quickly. “I read about you. What you used to do.”

“That makes one of us.”

He leaned forward slightly, lowering his voice without meaning to. “I need to ask you about something. A case. Old one. Sports gambling.”

The back of my neck prickled. Nothing I could name. Just body recognizing pattern before brain caught up.

Mick cleared his throat.

“You buying something, kid?” he asked.

Evan blinked, like the question had arrived from somewhere far away. He looked around the bar—really looked this time. The scuffed floor. The dim lights. The jukebox waiting to betray someone again.

“Yeah,” he said. “Yeah. Beer’s fine.”

Mick poured it without asking what kind. Slid it across. His eyes flicked to me once.

Careful.

Evan wrapped both hands around the glass but didn’t drink. Just stared at the foam, watching it settle.

“There was a case,” he said. “Early 2000s. It stopped moving when it shouldn’t have.”

I kept my face still. “Cases stop all the time. Funding runs out. Jurisdiction shifts.”

“Not like this.” He pulled the backpack closer. Protective. “I work with old records. Data that gets carried forward because no one wants to be the guy who deletes the wrong thing. I found a pattern in closed cases. Things that stopped for no reason anyone documented.”

“Still vague,” I said.

“I’m trying to be careful.” His eyes went to the door again. “The pattern shows up around specific types of outcomes. And your name keeps appearing near them.”

I set my beer down. Something cold was spreading through my chest.

“How?” I asked.

“Not directly,” he said quickly. “Not in the files themselves. But in the structure around them. Like residue. Like something that used to be there but got cleaned up.”

The word sat between us.

Residue.

Outside, a train thundered past. Close enough to make the bottles behind the bar rattle.

“What case?” I asked. My voice sounded different. Flatter.

He met my eyes.

“The one they called Skeleton Key,” he said.

My pulse doubled before my brain caught up. Six years of not thinking about that name and suddenly it was sitting on the bar between us like evidence I’d buried badly.

Heat spread across my shoulders. My breathing changed rhythm. The itch I’d learned to ignore for six years came roaring back—not faint, not gradual. Sharp. Immediate. Like something that had been waiting.

Mick moved down the bar. Found something else to clean.

I leaned back, putting distance between us that didn’t help.

“That case is closed,” I said.

“I know.”

“Officially.”

“I know that too.”

“Then why are you here?”

Evan set his glass down. His hands were still shaking.

“Because when they closed it, they didn’t close it. They just stopped looking. And I think you know that.”

I didn’t answer.

“I found your name in places it shouldn’t be,” he went on. “Not as someone who worked the case. As someone who complicated it.”

“Complicated how?”

“I don’t know yet,” he said. “That’s why I’m here.”

I stared at my beer. Watched the condensation slide down the bottle. Six years I’d been sitting in this bar. Six years I’d convinced myself I was done noticing things.

And here was someone telling me I’d left marks that couldn’t be scrubbed clean.

“I can’t help you,” I said.

“Can’t or won’t?”

“Both.”

He nodded like he’d expected that. Reached into his pocket, pulled out a pen, scribbled something on a napkin. Slid it across.

“I’m staying in Foxfire for a few more days,” he said. “There’s a coffee shop on Meridian. The Grind. You know it?”

I knew it.

“I’ll be there Wednesday evening,” he said. “Six o’clock. If you want to talk about this properly.”

“I won’t,” I said.

“Maybe,” he said. “But if you do, I’ll be there.”

He stood up. Left money on the bar. More than the beer cost.

“Thank you for listening,” he said. “I know you didn’t want to.”

He picked up his backpack. Turned toward the door.

Then stopped.

Looked back at me.

“I’m not imagining this,” he said quietly. “I know how it sounds. But I’m not.”

“I never said you were.”

“No,” he said. “But you’re thinking it.”

He wasn’t wrong.

He pushed through the door and disappeared into Foxfire’s streets.

\---

Through the frosted window, I caught it. Movement at the corner. Wrong color for this neighborhood.

A sedan. Dark paint. Tinted windows. Engine running smooth and patient.

I’d seen it when Evan arrived. Registered it without understanding. Just another car on just another street. Now I understood what I’d been seeing.

It had been waiting.

Evan walked past it without noticing.

The car didn’t move. Just sat there. Watching.

I memorized the plate. Old habit. The kind you can’t shake even when you’ve stopped being the person who needed to.

Mick came back, picked up the empty glass, set it in the sink.

“You gonna meet him?” he asked.

“No.”

“You’re lying.”

I didn’t argue.

The car pulled away slowly as Evan turned the corner. Followed at a distance. Patient. Professional.

Mick saw it too.

“That’s not good,” he said.

“No,” I said. “It’s not.”

I sat there watching through the window as both shapes disappeared—Evan walking, the sedan gliding behind him like a shadow with its own engine. Everything about it was wrong. The cleanliness. The patience. The fact that it had been there before I’d noticed it.

The itch wasn’t just back. It was spreading.

Pattern recognition. That’s what they’d valued about me at the Bureau. The ability to see connections that shouldn’t exist. To notice when things lined up too perfectly or stopped too abruptly.

I’d spent six years trying to turn that off.

One conversation and it was roaring back like it had never left.

Outside, Foxfire kept breathing. Trains passed. Cars moved. The city did what cities do—kept going without asking if anyone wanted to come along.

Inside, the jukebox stayed quiet.

Chip moved behind the bar, putting bottles away, humming something under his breath. Mick leaned against the counter, arms crossed, not saying what we were both thinking.

On the wall, the old clipping stared down. Promise. Potential. Words that come cheap when you’re young.

I thought about Skeleton Key. About how some cases never really close. They just stop making noise.

About how your name showing up as residue meant someone had tried to clean you out of the record but hadn’t quite managed it.

About the way Evan’s hands had shaken. Not from fear. From holding on.

About the clean car with tinted windows, following someone who’d come looking for me.

“You good?” Mick asked.

“No,” I said.

“But you’re going to that coffee shop Wednesday.”

It wasn’t a question.

I didn’t answer.

Outside, the train came through again. Closer this time. The city pressing in. Always pressing in.

I stood up. Left money on the bar.

“See you tomorrow,” Mick said.

“Yeah,” I said.

The door closed behind me. Foxfire wrapped around me like it always did. Cold. Indifferent. Honest about what it was.

I walked home thinking about residue.

About patterns that shouldn’t exist.

About names that appear where they shouldn’t.

About a kid who’d found something he didn’t understand and come looking for someone who did.

About a clean car with tinted windows.

About Wednesday at six.

The itch was sharp now. Familiar. The kind that doesn’t go away until you scratch it.

Or until it scratches you first.",1,1767497599.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

My name is Nick and I'm a 28 year old guy from Texas. I've posted before but I'm deciding to try something a little bit different this time around and just putting everything in the table, so buckle up and I'm sorry in advance for all of the writing. 

Some things about me, I work for a large investment company in the US, I've been in the financial field for about 4 and a half years now. Before that, I spent about the same amount of time working in water damage restoration. I am college educated, I actually went back to college for a finance degree, switched to marketing because it was interesting, graduated, and now plan to stay in finance. Minor mistake. I sit on the asexual spectrum. I'm very big on honesty and not hiding any secrets, ask about anything and everything.

Physically, I am 6 feet tall, I go to the gym but I also like to eat, I'm white, brown hair, brown eyes. Just a pretty generic dude. I wear size 12 shoes but size 13 boots, the boots also make me 6'2 in case I plan on reaching the top-top shelf that day. I have 3 tattoos and plan on getting more. 

Hobbies are kinda scattered here and there. My main two are watching formula 1 every weekend it's on, and playing games primarily on PS5 or PC. I commit to reading a few books a year, I enjoy poetry, every now and then I'll build a Lego, I'm slightly involved in the furry community since I have a good friend who is an artist and would really like to make friends who are also in it or at least interested enough to chat about it, I like doing things with my hands, I enjoy making coffee, I like going out to stores and to eat, I have a cat, I keep myself busy most days and out of the house. 

What I'm looking for is something genuine and long term. Yap on reddit for a bit to see if there's a connection, move onto somewhere else. I want yap sessions, if we have similar hobbies then lets do them together, be shoulders to lean on, add to each other's lives, become a positive stone on your path. Not opposed to the occasional ""good boy"" here and there. Be a name that when I think of it or see it, I think of you and smile because that's my friend.

If you’ve worked in the fitness industry as long as I have, you eventually learn to hate the calendar. January 2nd marks the beginning of the migration of repentant souls.

They arrive in schools, wearing lycra clothes that still smell like the store, carrying colorful water bottles, fueled by the fragile determination of someone who spent three weeks stuffing their face with holiday roast and sides and now wants a pop star’s body before Carnival.

We call this ""Project Summer."" I call it ""Project Desperation.""

My name is Danilo. I’m a personal trainer and floor instructor at *IronFit 24h*, one of those low-cost gym chains that have spread through São Paulo like a fungal plague. Black walls, neon yellow lights, electronic music played too loud, and membership fees that are way too cheap.

I work the shift nobody wants: midnight to six in the morning.

It’s a lonely shift. The crowd at that hour is usually made up of insomniacs, ER doctors, cops, and a few antisocial meatheads who hate sharing equipment. The sound of weight plates clanking echoes in the empty warehouse like gunshots. The smell is a mix of rubber, citrus disinfectant, and cold sweat.

But this specific January, something was different.

It started with Mariana.

Mariana had been a regular student on my shift for about six months. A nurse, thirty-something, slightly overweight. She was always nice, the type who brings coffee for the instructor and chats about TV shows between sets on the leg press. Her goal was to lose 5kg (about 11 lbs). A healthy, realistic goal.

When I came back from my New Year’s break on January 3rd, Mariana was there.

It was 3:15 AM.

I was at the front desk, fighting off sleep, when she walked in.

I almost didn’t recognize her.

In less than two weeks, Mariana looked like she had lost 10 or 15 kilos (20-30 lbs). Her workout clothes, once tight, now hung off her body like empty sacks. Her face was gaunt, her cheekbones protruding like blades beneath pale skin. There were deep, purple circles around eyes that looked glazed over, focused on nothing.

""Mariana?"" I called out, stepping out from behind the counter. ""Wow, long time no see. You look... different.""

She didn’t smile. The old Mariana would have made a joke about cutting carbs. But this Mariana just turned her head slowly in my direction, like a robot with rusted gears.

""Need to train,"" she whispered. Her voice was hoarse, dry.

""Sure. But... are you okay? You’re pale.""

""Spinning Room,"" she said, ignoring my question.

""Kleber said the Spinning Room is closed for maintenance.""

Kleber was the unit manager. A guy who looked like he was assembled from Lego pieces made of meat and steroids. Teeth too white, a fake orange tan, and an aggressive corporate energy that made me nauseous. He was never at the gym at dawn; his shift was strictly 9-to-5.

""Is Kleber here?"" I asked, confused.

Mariana didn’t answer. She marched toward the back of the gym, where the bike room was located. It was a closed room with soundproofing and glass windows which, I noticed now, had been covered with brown butcher paper from the inside.

""Maintenance,"" read a crooked sign on the door.

Mariana typed a code into the keypad on the door. The light turned green. She went in.

A blast of hot air escaped the room before the door closed. Hot and humid. And with a strange smell. It didn’t smell like sweat.

I went back to the counter, uneasy.

Over the next few nights, the pattern repeated. And it got worse.

It wasn’t just Mariana.

I started noticing a group. There were about ten of them. Men and women, varying ages, but they all shared the same cadaverous aesthetic. Gray skin, sudden and excessive thinness, trembling hands, and that dead-fish stare.

They always arrived between 3:00 and 3:30 AM. They didn’t speak to me. They didn’t use their fingerprint at the turnstile (which was against the rules, but the system seemed to release them automatically).

They went straight to the Spinning Room, typed in the password, and disappeared inside for exactly one hour.

None of them touched the weights. None of them drank water. They walked in, and they crawled out, leaning on the walls, soaked in a sweat that looked oily.

I tried to talk to Kleber at the shift change, at 6:00 AM.

""Kleber, what’s going on in the bike room?"" I asked, grabbing my backpack.

""The night crew is using it, but the sign says maintenance. And Mariana... man, she’s sick. She lost weight way too fast.""

Kleber was drinking his whey protein, scrolling on his phone. He didn’t even look up.

""It’s a high-performance group, Danilo. New franchise protocol. Metabolic HIIT. Elite stuff. Don’t worry about it. They pay for a Black Diamond plan.""

""But they look like crack addicts, Kleber. Seriously. Their skin is melting off. And what is that smell?""

Kleber finally looked at me. The white smile vanished. His eyes went cold.

""Are you a doctor, Danilo?""

""No, I’m a physical trainer.""

""Then train physiques and leave the management to me. If they get sick, they signed a liability waiver. Your job is to watch the weight room and make sure no one steals the dumbbells. The bike room is rented for a private project. Don’t meddle, stay in your lane.""

He patted my shoulder. A pat that was a little too hard.

"" The job market is tough, Danilo. Don’t lose your job over curiosity.""

I went home, but I couldn’t sleep. The image of Mariana haunted me. I knew what drugs did. I’ve seen people abuse diuretics, T3, Clenbuterol. But this was different. They weren’t just drying out fat. They looked like they were being consumed from the inside out.

Last night, I decided I wasn’t going to ignore it anymore.

It was 3:40 AM. The ""Zombie Group,"" as I’d mentally nicknamed them, had been inside the Spinning Room for twenty minutes. The gym was empty, except for them and me.

I went to the door. I pressed my ear against the glass covered by the brown paper. The soundproofing was good, but not perfect.

I could hear the hum of the bikes spinning.

But I didn’t hear music. Spinning classes have loud music, shouting, motivation.

In there, the only human sound was... moaning. Muffled screams of pain. Crying. And someone vomiting.

I tried the handle. Locked.

I looked at the keypad. Four digits.

I remembered the gym’s anniversary. Nothing. I tried today’s date. Nothing. Then I remembered Kleber’s ego. He had a tattoo on his arm: 1985. The year he was born.

I typed 1-9-8-5.

The light turned green.

I took a deep breath, pulled my shirt up to cover my nose, and opened the door.

The heat hit me like a physical punch. The temperature inside must have been bordering on 50°C (122°F). The air was thick, unbreathable, saturated with humidity and that chemical smell of rotten vinegar mixed with boiled meat.

The room was dim, lit only by red emergency lights along the baseboards.

There were twelve bikes. All occupied.

But they weren’t just pedaling.

Mariana was on the front bike. Strapped to the machine. There were velcro straps binding her wrists to the handlebars and her feet to the pedals.

She was pedaling at a frantic, inhuman pace. Her legs were spinning so fast they were a blur.

But she wasn’t doing it voluntarily.

Her bike—and the others—were connected to an external motor. The motor was forcing the pedals to turn. If she stopped applying force, her legs would be snapped by the mechanical movement. She had to keep up with the machine’s rhythm to avoid having her bones ground to dust.

But the worst part wasn’t the forced movement.

The worst part was the masks.

Every student was wearing a transparent oxygen mask, connected by tubes that went up to the ceiling, feeding into the AC vents. Inside the masks, a yellowish gas was being pumped in.

Mariana looked at me when I entered. Her eyes were red with burst blood vessels. Her skin glistened with sweat, but also with blisters. Small burn blisters covered her arms.

She tried to scream, but the mask muffled the sound. She was cooking. Literally.

""My God!"" I shouted, running to her bike. I tried to undo the velcro.

They were locked with industrial zip ties.

I looked at the bike’s panel. There was no stop button. The wiring went straight into the wall.

The other students didn’t even look at me. Some seemed passed out, heads hanging low, but their legs kept spinning, spinning, spinning, driven by the motor, tearing muscles and ligaments in unconscious bodies.

""What the fuck are you doing here?""

The voice came from the back of the room, from the shadows.

Kleber was there. He was wearing a white hazmat suit and a professional gas mask. He was holding a tablet.

""Turn this off!"" I screamed, coughing from the heat and the chemical smell. ""You’re killing them! Mariana is burning up with fever!""

Kleber walked calmly toward me. He looked huge in that suit.

""They’re not dying, Danilo. They’re metabolizing. Do you know what DNP is? 2,4-Dinitrophenol?""

He pointed to the tubes in the ceiling.

""It’s an industrial compound. Used to make explosives in World War I. The workers who handled it lost weight until they vanished. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. Basically? It makes the cell stop storing energy and turn everything into heat. Fat turns into fire.""

""This is poison!"" I tried to lunge at him, but the heat was making me dizzy. My legs felt like lead.

""It’s efficiency!"" Kleber shouted, his voice muffled by the mask. ""They signed the contract, Danilo! They wanted to lose 10 kilos in a week. They begged for this. I’m just giving them what they asked for. The gas raises their basal body temperature to 40 degrees. They burn 5,000 calories an hour sitting there. Yes, it’s uncomfortable. Yes, it cooks the internal organs a little bit. But look at her!""

He pointed to a woman in the second row. She was skeletal.

""She walked in here wearing a size 14 on Monday. Today is Friday and she’s a size 4. Her 'Project Summer' is done. Who cares if she needs dialysis for the rest of her life? She’ll look skinny in a bikini!""

""You’re sick!""

I tried to punch him. It was a mistake. I had been breathing that toxic air for two minutes. My strength was gone. My punch was slow, pathetic.

Kleber just grabbed my arm and shoved me.

I fell onto the rubber floor. The floor was hot. It burned my hand.

I saw Mariana looking at me. A tear of blood ran down under her mask. She mouthed something. I read her lips: *""Kill me.""*

I stood up, stumbling, and ran for the door. I needed to call the police. I needed to get out of that oven.

I grabbed the handle.

Locked.

""The session isn’t over, Danilo,"" Kleber said, typing something on the tablet. ""The locks are automatic. They only open when the thermal cycle ends. Thirty minutes left.""

I heard a mechanical click come from the ceiling. The hissing of the gas got louder.

""And since you’re here... and you’ve seen the franchise’s trade secret... I think you need a workout too. You’ve been looking a little bloated, Danilo. Too much beer over the holidays?""

I felt my throat close up. The air was turning yellow.

Kleber walked toward me. He wasn’t going to put me on a bike. He didn’t need to.

Just being in that room was enough.

""DNP in gaseous form is absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes,"" Kleber explained, as if giving a biomechanics lecture. ""Without the mask, you’ll absorb a lethal dose in... let’s say, ten minutes. Your temperature will rise to 42 degrees. Your proteins will denature. Your brain will cook inside your skull. It’s a quick death, but... hot.""

I ran to the windows covered with brown paper. I pounded on the glass. Double tempered glass. Unbreakable without a hammer.

I screamed for help. But who would hear? The gym was empty. The soundproofing was perfect.

Kleber sat on a stool in the corner, crossed his legs, and kept monitoring the data on the tablet.

""Save your oxygen, Danilo. The more you move, the hotter you get.""

I felt sweat break out on my forehead. It wasn’t normal sweat. It was a flood. My shirt was soaked in seconds. My heart started beating out of rhythm.

I felt a burning in my stomach, as if I had swallowed hot coals. My vision began to blur, yellowing at the edges.

I looked at Mariana. She had passed out, but her legs kept spinning, spinning, spinning, driven by the relentless motor.

I heard a dry snap — *CRACK*.

Her knee had broken. The bone tore through the skin, white and shiny, but the machine kept forcing her leg to turn, grinding the joint with every rotation.

Kleber didn’t even look.

I fell to my knees. The floor was boiling.

I tried to crawl to the door.

My skin was red, throbbing. I could feel my blood bubbling in my veins. It felt like being inside a giant microwave.

""Twenty minutes left,"" Kleber’s voice sounded distant, metallic. ""Hang in there. Think of the results. Think about how shredded you’ll look in the coffin.""

My eyes are swelling. I think my tears are evaporating before they fall.

I’m writing this on my phone’s notes app, with fingers slippery from sweat and the grease leaking from my pores. The battery is dying. The phone is overheating too.

If anyone finds this phone... if anyone finds what’s left of us...

Don’t believe the official report.

They’ll say it was a fire. They’ll say it was a short circuit in the sauna.

It wasn’t.

It was Project Summer.

Kleber is standing up now. He’s coming toward me with a syringe.

""To speed up the process,"" he says.

I’m so hot.

I just wanted the air conditioning to work.

Mariana stopped moving. The machine keeps spinning her legs, but her head has fallen back. Her mask is full of black vomit.

Kleber is smiling.

It’s January. It’s the month of ""Project Summer."" It’s the month... of lies.",2,1767497305.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

If you’ve worked in the fitness industry as long as I have, you eventually learn to hate the calendar. January 2nd marks the beginning of the migration of repentant souls.

They arrive in schools, wearing lycra clothes that still smell like the store, carrying colorful water bottles, fueled by the fragile determination of someone who spent three weeks stuffing their face with holiday roast and sides and now wants a pop star’s body before Carnival.

We call this ""Project Summer."" I call it ""Project Desperation.""

My name is Danilo. I’m a personal trainer and floor instructor at *IronFit 24h*, one of those low-cost gym chains that have spread through São Paulo like a fungal plague. Black walls, neon yellow lights, electronic music played too loud, and membership fees that are way too cheap.

I work the shift nobody wants: midnight to six in the morning.

It’s a lonely shift. The crowd at that hour is usually made up of insomniacs, ER doctors, cops, and a few antisocial meatheads who hate sharing equipment. The sound of weight plates clanking echoes in the empty warehouse like gunshots. The smell is a mix of rubber, citrus disinfectant, and cold sweat.

But this specific January, something was different.

It started with Mariana.

Mariana had been a regular student on my shift for about six months. A nurse, thirty-something, slightly overweight. She was always nice, the type who brings coffee for the instructor and chats about TV shows between sets on the leg press. Her goal was to lose 5kg (about 11 lbs). A healthy, realistic goal.

When I came back from my New Year’s break on January 3rd, Mariana was there.

It was 3:15 AM.

I was at the front desk, fighting off sleep, when she walked in.

I almost didn’t recognize her.

In less than two weeks, Mariana looked like she had lost 10 or 15 kilos (20-30 lbs). Her workout clothes, once tight, now hung off her body like empty sacks. Her face was gaunt, her cheekbones protruding like blades beneath pale skin. There were deep, purple circles around eyes that looked glazed over, focused on nothing.

""Mariana?"" I called out, stepping out from behind the counter. ""Wow, long time no see. You look... different.""

She didn’t smile. The old Mariana would have made a joke about cutting carbs. But this Mariana just turned her head slowly in my direction, like a robot with rusted gears.

""Need to train,"" she whispered. Her voice was hoarse, dry.

""Sure. But... are you okay? You’re pale.""

""Spinning Room,"" she said, ignoring my question.

""Kleber said the Spinning Room is closed for maintenance.""

Kleber was the unit manager. A guy who looked like he was assembled from Lego pieces made of meat and steroids. Teeth too white, a fake orange tan, and an aggressive corporate energy that made me nauseous. He was never at the gym at dawn; his shift was strictly 9-to-5.

""Is Kleber here?"" I asked, confused.

Mariana didn’t answer. She marched toward the back of the gym, where the bike room was located. It was a closed room with soundproofing and glass windows which, I noticed now, had been covered with brown butcher paper from the inside.

""Maintenance,"" read a crooked sign on the door.

Mariana typed a code into the keypad on the door. The light turned green. She went in.

A blast of hot air escaped the room before the door closed. Hot and humid. And with a strange smell. It didn’t smell like sweat.

I went back to the counter, uneasy.

Over the next few nights, the pattern repeated. And it got worse.

It wasn’t just Mariana.

I started noticing a group. There were about ten of them. Men and women, varying ages, but they all shared the same cadaverous aesthetic. Gray skin, sudden and excessive thinness, trembling hands, and that dead-fish stare.

They always arrived between 3:00 and 3:30 AM. They didn’t speak to me. They didn’t use their fingerprint at the turnstile (which was against the rules, but the system seemed to release them automatically).

They went straight to the Spinning Room, typed in the password, and disappeared inside for exactly one hour.

None of them touched the weights. None of them drank water. They walked in, and they crawled out, leaning on the walls, soaked in a sweat that looked oily.

I tried to talk to Kleber at the shift change, at 6:00 AM.

""Kleber, what’s going on in the bike room?"" I asked, grabbing my backpack.

""The night crew is using it, but the sign says maintenance. And Mariana... man, she’s sick. She lost weight way too fast.""

Kleber was drinking his whey protein, scrolling on his phone. He didn’t even look up.

""It’s a high-performance group, Danilo. New franchise protocol. Metabolic HIIT. Elite stuff. Don’t worry about it. They pay for a Black Diamond plan.""

""But they look like crack addicts, Kleber. Seriously. Their skin is melting off. And what is that smell?""

Kleber finally looked at me. The white smile vanished. His eyes went cold.

""Are you a doctor, Danilo?""

""No, I’m a physical trainer.""

""Then train physiques and leave the management to me. If they get sick, they signed a liability waiver. Your job is to watch the weight room and make sure no one steals the dumbbells. The bike room is rented for a private project. Don’t meddle, stay in your lane.""

He patted my shoulder. A pat that was a little too hard.

"" The job market is tough, Danilo. Don’t lose your job over curiosity.""

I went home, but I couldn’t sleep. The image of Mariana haunted me. I knew what drugs did. I’ve seen people abuse diuretics, T3, Clenbuterol. But this was different. They weren’t just drying out fat. They looked like they were being consumed from the inside out.

Last night, I decided I wasn’t going to ignore it anymore.

It was 3:40 AM. The ""Zombie Group,"" as I’d mentally nicknamed them, had been inside the Spinning Room for twenty minutes. The gym was empty, except for them and me.

I went to the door. I pressed my ear against the glass covered by the brown paper. The soundproofing was good, but not perfect.

I could hear the hum of the bikes spinning.

But I didn’t hear music. Spinning classes have loud music, shouting, motivation.

In there, the only human sound was... moaning. Muffled screams of pain. Crying. And someone vomiting.

I tried the handle. Locked.

I looked at the keypad. Four digits.

I remembered the gym’s anniversary. Nothing. I tried today’s date. Nothing. Then I remembered Kleber’s ego. He had a tattoo on his arm: 1985. The year he was born.

I typed 1-9-8-5.

The light turned green.

I took a deep breath, pulled my shirt up to cover my nose, and opened the door.

The heat hit me like a physical punch. The temperature inside must have been bordering on 50°C (122°F). The air was thick, unbreathable, saturated with humidity and that chemical smell of rotten vinegar mixed with boiled meat.

The room was dim, lit only by red emergency lights along the baseboards.

There were twelve bikes. All occupied.

But they weren’t just pedaling.

Mariana was on the front bike. Strapped to the machine. There were velcro straps binding her wrists to the handlebars and her feet to the pedals.

She was pedaling at a frantic, inhuman pace. Her legs were spinning so fast they were a blur.

But she wasn’t doing it voluntarily.

Her bike—and the others—were connected to an external motor. The motor was forcing the pedals to turn. If she stopped applying force, her legs would be snapped by the mechanical movement. She had to keep up with the machine’s rhythm to avoid having her bones ground to dust.

But the worst part wasn’t the forced movement.

The worst part was the masks.

Every student was wearing a transparent oxygen mask, connected by tubes that went up to the ceiling, feeding into the AC vents. Inside the masks, a yellowish gas was being pumped in.

Mariana looked at me when I entered. Her eyes were red with burst blood vessels. Her skin glistened with sweat, but also with blisters. Small burn blisters covered her arms.

She tried to scream, but the mask muffled the sound. She was cooking. Literally.

""My God!"" I shouted, running to her bike. I tried to undo the velcro.

They were locked with industrial zip ties.

I looked at the bike’s panel. There was no stop button. The wiring went straight into the wall.

The other students didn’t even look at me. Some seemed passed out, heads hanging low, but their legs kept spinning, spinning, spinning, driven by the motor, tearing muscles and ligaments in unconscious bodies.

""What the fuck are you doing here?""

The voice came from the back of the room, from the shadows.

Kleber was there. He was wearing a white hazmat suit and a professional gas mask. He was holding a tablet.

""Turn this off!"" I screamed, coughing from the heat and the chemical smell. ""You’re killing them! Mariana is burning up with fever!""

Kleber walked calmly toward me. He looked huge in that suit.

""They’re not dying, Danilo. They’re metabolizing. Do you know what DNP is? 2,4-Dinitrophenol?""

He pointed to the tubes in the ceiling.

""It’s an industrial compound. Used to make explosives in World War I. The workers who handled it lost weight until they vanished. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. Basically? It makes the cell stop storing energy and turn everything into heat. Fat turns into fire.""

""This is poison!"" I tried to lunge at him, but the heat was making me dizzy. My legs felt like lead.

""It’s efficiency!"" Kleber shouted, his voice muffled by the mask. ""They signed the contract, Danilo! They wanted to lose 10 kilos in a week. They begged for this. I’m just giving them what they asked for. The gas raises their basal body temperature to 40 degrees. They burn 5,000 calories an hour sitting there. Yes, it’s uncomfortable. Yes, it cooks the internal organs a little bit. But look at her!""

He pointed to a woman in the second row. She was skeletal.

""She walked in here wearing a size 14 on Monday. Today is Friday and she’s a size 4. Her 'Project Summer' is done. Who cares if she needs dialysis for the rest of her life? She’ll look skinny in a bikini!""

""You’re sick!""

I tried to punch him. It was a mistake. I had been breathing that toxic air for two minutes. My strength was gone. My punch was slow, pathetic.

Kleber just grabbed my arm and shoved me.

I fell onto the rubber floor. The floor was hot. It burned my hand.

I saw Mariana looking at me. A tear of blood ran down under her mask. She mouthed something. I read her lips: *""Kill me.""*

1q3f2fp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3f2fp,Looking for advice on my living room (especially window coverings!),"Recently moved into our first house, and I've had the hardest time deciding on the window coverings for our living room. We like where the TV stand is, but it juts out under the front window, so it seems like curtains wouldn't really work (unless we pulled the tv stand forward a few inches and the curtains went to the floor behind it, but wouldn't that look weird?). I'd love to do roman shades, but this is a rental so it's hard to justify the cost.

I'm also totally open to critiques on literally everything else. The sofa, ottoman, armchair, rug, and tv stand are from ikea (I used to live right next to one lol). I definitely plan to upgrade the sofa down the road because it's not really our style, but please let me know if any other furniture pieces in particular should also go! I'm open to swapping the rug out for something larger. I believe the landlord may be OK with us painting the walls, so that's also something we could potentially do in the near future. We don't love the gray trim. Is there enough detailing in the paneling and trim that color drenching might work in this case? We are planning to buy another lamp or two so any suggestions on locations and type would be super welcome!! We never use the ceiling fan light (I'd get rid of it if I could). The coffee table is an old solid wood table from my parents (as is the desk), but if it's not working, I could probably relocate it somewhere else in the house.

Other random notes - the weird corner thing by the front door is a partial height closet. This house was built in the 50s and I assume it's a remnant from something but no idea what! The painting to the right of the large window (pic 3) is mounted too high - we will fix that (or maybe just put it somewhere else). We would love more plants in here but the front of the house is facing north and there's a covered porch, so very little direct sunlight comes into the space (the poor fig needs to be relocated as it is). When we're not doing a puzzle, the coffee table usually has a few books on it and a candle. We will be getting a larger TV soon - size tbd.

""They’re not dying, Danilo. They’re metabolizing. Do you know what DNP is? 2,4-Dinitrophenol?""

He pointed to the tubes in the ceiling.

""It’s an industrial compound. Used to make explosives in World War I. The workers who handled it lost weight until they vanished. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation. Basically? It makes the cell stop storing energy and turn everything into heat. Fat turns into fire.""

""This is poison!"" I tried to lunge at him, but the heat was making me dizzy. My legs felt like lead.

""It’s efficiency!"" Kleber shouted, his voice muffled by the mask. ""They signed the contract, Danilo! They wanted to lose 10 kilos in a week. They begged for this. I’m just giving them what they asked for. The gas raises their basal body temperature to 40 degrees. They burn 5,000 calories an hour sitting there. Yes, it’s uncomfortable. Yes, it cooks the internal organs a little bit. But look at her!""

He pointed to a woman in the second row. She was skeletal.

""She walked in here wearing a size 14 on Monday. Today is Friday and she’s a size 4. Her 'Project Summer' is done. Who cares if she needs dialysis for the rest of her life? She’ll look skinny in a bikini!""

""You’re sick!""

I tried to punch him. It was a mistake. I had been breathing that toxic air for two minutes. My strength was gone. My punch was slow, pathetic.

Kleber just grabbed my arm and shoved me.

I fell onto the rubber floor. The floor was hot. It burned my hand.

I saw Mariana looking at me. A tear of blood ran down under her mask. She mouthed something. I read her lips: *""Kill me.""*

I stood up, stumbling, and ran for the door. I needed to call the police. I needed to get out of that oven.

I grabbed the handle.

Locked.

""The session isn’t over, Danilo,"" Kleber said, typing something on the tablet. ""The locks are automatic. They only open when the thermal cycle ends. Thirty minutes left.""

I heard a mechanical click come from the ceiling. The hissing of the gas got louder.

""And since you’re here... and you’ve seen the franchise’s trade secret... I think you need a workout too. You’ve been looking a little bloated, Danilo. Too much beer over the holidays?""

I felt my throat close up. The air was turning yellow.

Kleber walked toward me. He wasn’t going to put me on a bike. He didn’t need to.

Just being in that room was enough.

""DNP in gaseous form is absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes,"" Kleber explained, as if giving a biomechanics lecture. ""Without the mask, you’ll absorb a lethal dose in... let’s say, ten minutes. Your temperature will rise to 42 degrees. Your proteins will denature. Your brain will cook inside your skull. It’s a quick death, but... hot.""

I ran to the windows covered with brown paper. I pounded on the glass. Double tempered glass. Unbreakable without a hammer.

I screamed for help. But who would hear? The gym was empty. The soundproofing was perfect.

Kleber sat on a stool in the corner, crossed his legs, and kept monitoring the data on the tablet.

""Save your oxygen, Danilo. The more you move, the hotter you get.""

I felt sweat break out on my forehead. It wasn’t normal sweat. It was a flood. My shirt was soaked in seconds. My heart started beating out of rhythm.

I felt a burning in my stomach, as if I had swallowed hot coals. My vision began to blur, yellowing at the edges.

I looked at Mariana. She had passed out, but her legs kept spinning, spinning, spinning, driven by the relentless motor.

I heard a dry snap — *CRACK*.

Her knee had broken. The bone tore through the skin, white and shiny, but the machine kept forcing her leg to turn, grinding the joint with every rotation.

Kleber didn’t even look.

I fell to my knees. The floor was boiling.

I tried to crawl to the door.

My skin was red, throbbing. I could feel my blood bubbling in my veins. It felt like being inside a giant microwave.

""Twenty minutes left,"" Kleber’s voice sounded distant, metallic. ""Hang in there. Think of the results. Think about how shredded you’ll look in the coffin.""

My eyes are swelling. I think my tears are evaporating before they fall.

I’m writing this on my phone’s notes app, with fingers slippery from sweat and the grease leaking from my pores. The battery is dying. The phone is overheating too.

If anyone finds this phone... if anyone finds what’s left of us...

Don’t believe the official report.

They’ll say it was a fire. They’ll say it was a short circuit in the sauna.

It wasn’t.

It was Project Summer.

Kleber is standing up now. He’s coming toward me with a syringe.

""To speed up the process,"" he says.

I’m so hot.

I just wanted the air conditioning to work.

Mariana stopped moving. The machine keeps spinning her legs, but her head has fallen back. Her mask is full of black vomit.

Kleber is smiling.

It’s January. It’s the month of ""Project Summer."" It’s the month... of lies.",1,1767497201.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1q3f0m7,https://youtu.be/Jct8W2OJotg,4 Very Scary TRUE Holiday Travel Destination Horror Stories,"# ""THE WORST ROAD"":

I was excited as my boyfriend Tom and I drove our old orange van along the long, empty highway in Australia's outback. We had been traveling for weeks, visiting beaches and small towns, and now we headed toward some big red rocks that people said were amazing to see. Tom drove while I looked at maps and sang along to songs on our little radio. It felt like an adventure, just the two of us far from home.

A white truck with a green top started following us close. We saw it first at a stop where we got gas and snacks. The driver kept right behind, not passing even when he could. Tom said, ""Maybe he wants to say hi or something."" But it made me a bit uneasy. After a while, the truck pulled up next to us. The man inside waved his arm a lot, pointing back at our van like something was wrong. He yelled out his window, ""Pull over! Pull over!""

Tom slowed down and stopped on the side of the road. ""He might have seen a problem with the engine,"" Tom told me. ""I'll check it out."" He got out and walked back to meet the man. I stayed in the passenger seat, watching in the mirror. The man was tall with a mustache and wore a hat. He pointed at the back of our van and said something about sparks coming from the pipe. Tom nodded and they both went to look.

I slid over to the driver's seat, just in case we needed to go quick. The man and Tom talked more. ""See, right there,"" the man said, his voice deep and calm. ""You got sparks shooting out. Could start a fire."" Tom leaned down to check. Then, a loud crack rang out, like a firework but sharper. I jumped and looked back. The man came around to my window fast, holding a small silver gun pointed right at me.

""Get out,"" he said, his eyes cold. ""Don't scream or I'll shoot."" My hands shook as I opened the door. He grabbed my arm hard and pulled me out. ""Where's Tom?"" I asked, my voice small. He didn't answer. Instead, he pushed me against the van and tied my wrists behind my back with black plastic strips. They cut into my skin. ""Please, what do you want?"" I begged. ""Just let us go.""

""Shut up,"" he growled. He tried to tie my ankles too, but I kicked a little. ""Stop that,"" he said, pressing the gun to my side. I went still, scared he would pull the trigger. He wrapped tape around my mouth, but I twisted my head. ""Hold still,"" he ordered. Then he dragged me toward his truck. I saw his dog inside, barking loud. My mind raced—what was he planning? Rob us? Hurt me?

As he opened the truck door, I yanked away with all my strength. The ties hurt my wrists, but I ran into the bushes off the road. Thorns scratched my legs, but I didn't stop. ""Come back here!"" he shouted, running after me. I dropped to the ground behind a thick bush and curled up small. My breathing was loud in my ears, but I tried to hold it.

He came close, shining a light around. The beam swept over the ground near my feet. ""I know you're out here,"" he called. ""You can't hide forever."" His footsteps crunched on dry leaves. He passed by once, then came back. I could smell his sweat. The dog barked from the truck, making him turn. He walked away, but then returned, closer this time. The light hit the bush above me. I squeezed my eyes shut, sure he would find me.

Minutes passed like hours. He muttered to himself, ""Where is she?"" and kicked at rocks. The third time he came near, his boot almost stepped on my hand. I bit my lip to not make a sound. Finally, he went back to the truck. I heard him drive off a bit, then stop. Was he waiting? I stayed hidden, wrists aching from the ties. Bugs crawled on my arms, but I didn't move.

Later, I heard a big truck coming down the highway. It was one of those long ones with trailers. I waited until the man's truck sound faded, then I stood and ran to the road, waving my bound arms. The big truck slowed. Two men inside looked surprised. ""Help me!"" I yelled, pulling the tape off my mouth. ""A man shot my boyfriend and tried to take me!""

The driver opened the door. ""What happened?"" he asked, helping me in. His friend cut the ties with a knife. ""Some guy pulled us over, said something was wrong with our van,"" I explained, tears coming now. ""He had a gun. I heard a shot. Tom... I think he's hurt bad."" They looked at each other. ""We need to get you to town,"" the driver said. ""Police can help.""

They drove me to a small place with a bar and phones. I told the people there everything. ""He was in a white truck with a green top,"" I said. ""Tall guy, mustache."" A lady gave me water. ""You're safe now,"" she said. But I couldn't stop shaking. Police came soon after. They asked questions over and over. ""Show us where it happened,"" one officer said.

We went back in their car. The van was gone, pushed into the bushes. There was blood on the ground where Tom had been. ""That's his,"" I whispered. They searched with lights, but no Tom. No man. Days turned into weeks. I stayed in hotels, talking to detectives. They showed me pictures of trucks and men. One day, I saw his face in a photo. ""That's him,"" I pointed.

The trial came later. I had to tell the story in court, facing him. He stared at me, no smile. Lawyers asked if I was sure. ""Yes,"" I said. ""I'll never forget."" They found his DNA on my shirt and our van. The judge said he was guilty of killing Tom and attacking me. But Tom's body was never found. That hurts most.

Even now, I think about that night. Hiding in the dark, hearing him search. What if he had found me? Australia was supposed to be fun, a dream trip. Instead, it became a nightmare I can't escape. If you're traveling far, be careful who you trust on lonely roads.





# ""KOH TAO"":

I had saved up for months to finally take that dream trip to Koh Tao in Thailand. The pictures online showed clear blue water, soft sand beaches, and friendly bars where people from all over the world hung out. I flew in alone, excited to relax and maybe learn to dive. When I got off the boat, the place felt alive with tourists walking around, carrying backpacks and laughing. I checked into a small hotel right by Sairee Beach, the kind with simple rooms and a view of the ocean. The manager, a quiet man named Somsak, handed me the key and said, ""Welcome. Be careful at night. Some spots are dark."" I smiled and thought he was just being nice.

That first afternoon, I walked down to the beach. The sun warmed my skin as I found a spot at a bar called AC Bar. It was crowded with young people drinking beer and listening to music. I ordered a fruit shake and sat at a table, watching everyone. That's when I noticed a couple at the bar. The girl had long blonde hair and a big smile; she looked about my age, maybe in her twenties. The guy with her had short brown hair and seemed kind, buying her a drink. I heard them talking with British accents. She said to him, ""David, this island is perfect. No worries back home."" He laughed and replied, ""Yeah, Hannah, let's make the most of it. Cheers to new friends."" They clinked glasses.

I felt a little lonely, so I waved and said, ""Hi, mind if I join? I'm here solo too."" Hannah turned and grinned. ""Sure! I'm Hannah, this is David. We're from England. What about you?"" I told them my name is Emma, from the US, and we started chatting. David asked, ""First time in Thailand?"" I nodded. ""Yeah, I wanted some adventure."" We talked about the best dive spots and how the food was spicy but good. Hannah shared, ""We just got here yesterday. The hotel's nice, but last night I heard weird noises outside, like footsteps."" David shrugged. ""Probably just cats or something."" I laughed it off with them, but something about her words stuck with me.

As the evening went on, more people filled the bar. A group of local men sat at a corner table, not talking much, just watching. One of them, with a scar on his cheek, kept looking our way. I caught his eye once, and he didn't smile back. It made me uneasy, but I pushed it away. Hannah and David seemed happy, dancing a little to the music. Around midnight, Hannah leaned over and said, ""We're heading to a quieter part of the beach for a walk. Want to come?"" I thought about it, but I was tired from the flight. ""Maybe next time. Have fun!"" David waved goodbye. ""See you around, Emma."" I watched them leave hand in hand, walking toward the darker end of the beach where the lights faded.

I finished my drink and headed back to my hotel. The path was narrow, lined with palm trees and small shops closed for the night. As I walked, I heard footsteps behind me. I turned, but no one was there. My pulse quickened a bit. ""Hello?"" I called out softly. Nothing. I sped up, telling myself it was just my imagination. When I got to my room, I locked the door tight and lay down, but sleep didn't come easy. The room felt too quiet, except for the waves outside.

Sometime in the middle of the night, a sound woke me. It was far off, like a muffled cry, coming from the beach direction. I sat up, listening. Another sound, sharper this time, almost like a thud. My mind raced back to Hannah's words about noises. I went to the window and peered out. The beach looked empty under the moon, but shadows moved near the rocks. Was that a person? Or two? I strained to see, but it was too dark. The cries stopped suddenly, and everything went still. I waited, holding my breath, but heard nothing more. Scared, I pulled the curtains shut and got back in bed, curling up under the sheet. ""It's probably just party people,"" I whispered to myself, trying to calm down.

The next morning, I woke early and went for coffee at a cafe near the hotel. People were whispering, looking worried. A woman at the counter said to her friend, ""Did you hear? Two bodies on the beach."" My hands shook as I paid. ""What happened?"" I asked. The woman looked at me sadly. ""A girl and a guy, found this morning. Badly hurt. Police are there now."" I felt sick and rushed out to see.

The beach was taped off with yellow lines. Officers stood around, and a crowd gathered. I pushed closer and saw the shapes covered with sheets. Blood stained the sand. One officer was talking to a witness. ""They were hit with something heavy,"" he said quietly. ""The girl... it was awful."" I recognized the descriptions – blonde hair, British. It was Hannah and David. Someone had attacked them brutally on that isolated spot. A hoe from a nearby garden lay discarded, covered in red.

I backed away, my mind spinning. Who did this? I remembered the local men at the bar, the one with the scar. Had they followed? The police questioned everyone, including me. I told them about meeting Hannah and David, how they left for the walk. An officer nodded. ""We have suspects. Two workers from Burma. But stay careful. This island has secrets."" Later, I heard rumors from other tourists – that powerful families on the island protected their own, that the workers might be scapegoats. One girl whispered to me at lunch, ""I've seen those locals act strange before. They watch tourists like prey.""

That night, I couldn't stay. I packed my bags, heart racing every time I heard a noise outside. As I waited for the boat to leave, I saw the man with the scar walking by, staring right at me. He smiled this time, slow and cold. I looked away, fear gripping me. What if he knew I had seen him watching? On the ride back to the mainland, I kept thinking about Hannah's laugh, David's kind words. Their holiday turned into a nightmare, and I had been so close. I still wonder if those cries I heard were theirs, begging for help that never came. Koh Tao looked beautiful from afar, but up close, it hid darkness I never expected.





# ""DARK CORNERS"":

I still think about that honeymoon every now and then, the way it started so full of joy and ended in a way no one expects. Emma and I had saved up for months to go to Mauritius. The pictures online showed endless blue ocean and palm trees, a place where couples go to forget the world. We landed at the airport, grabbed our bags, and took a taxi to the Legends Hotel. The driver chatted with us about the best spots to see turtles, but we were too busy holding hands to pay much attention.

Our room was on the ground floor, with a big bed and a view of the garden. ""This is perfect,"" Emma said as she unpacked her dresses. She was always the organized one, folding everything neat while I tossed my shirts in a drawer. That first night, we walked along the shore, her head on my shoulder. ""Promise we'll come back here someday,"" she whispered. I nodded and kissed her forehead. ""Of course we will.""

The next few days blurred into happiness. We woke up early for breakfast buffets with mango and eggs, then lounged by the pool. Emma tried snorkeling for the first time and came up giggling about the colorful fish. ""You have to try this,"" she told me, pulling my arm. I did, and we floated together, pointing at things underwater. In the evenings, we'd dress up for dinner. One night, over grilled fish, she looked at me and said, ""I'm so glad I married you."" Her smile made everything feel right.

But on the fourth day, during lunch in the main restaurant, something shifted. We were sitting at a table near the window, picking at salads and sandwiches. Emma suddenly put down her fork. ""I forgot my book in the room,"" she said. ""And those biscuits they have – I want a couple for later."" I offered to go get them, but she waved me off. ""No, stay and finish your food. I'll be quick."" She stood up, leaned over to peck my cheek, and walked away, her sundress swaying.

I watched her go through the doors toward our building. The restaurant was busy with other guests chatting and waiters carrying trays. I ate a few more bites, checked my watch. Five minutes passed. Then ten. I figured maybe she stopped to talk to someone or got distracted packing her bag for the beach later. But after fifteen minutes, a little worry crept in. I pushed my plate aside and decided to check on her.

The path to our room wound through flowers and small fountains. I called out her name softly as I got closer. ""Emma? You okay?"" No answer. The door was slightly open, which struck me as odd because we always locked it. I pushed it wider and stepped inside. The air felt still. Her book lay on the bed, untouched. ""Emma?"" I said louder, moving toward the bathroom.

That's when I heard a faint drip of water. The bathroom door was closed. I knocked gently. ""Hey, you in there?"" Silence. My hand turned the knob, and the door swung open. Water ran from the faucet into the tub. And there she was, lying in the water, fully clothed, her eyes open but not seeing. I rushed forward, yelling her name, pulling her out. Her skin was cool, and there were marks around her neck, red and angry. I shook her, begging her to wake up, but she didn't move.

Panic hit me hard. I ran out into the hallway, shouting for help. ""Somebody, please! My wife – something's wrong!"" A hotel worker came running, a young guy with a mop. ""What happened?"" he asked, eyes wide. I dragged him back to the room. ""Look! Call a doctor, call the police!"" He stared at the scene, then bolted to get others. Soon, more staff arrived, and then security. They kept me outside while they checked her. One manager put a hand on my shoulder. ""Sir, please wait here. We're handling it.""

The police showed up fast, in uniforms, asking questions. ""When did she leave the restaurant?"" one officer said, notebook in hand. I told him everything, my voice shaking. ""She just went for her book and biscuits. Who would do this?"" They searched the room, found a key card that wasn't ours – a master key, like the ones cleaners use. ""Someone came in,"" another officer muttered. They took me to a small office for more talks. ""Did you argue with her? Any problems?"" I shook my head, tears coming. ""No, we were happy. This is our honeymoon.""

Hours dragged on. They questioned hotel workers one by one. I sat in a waiting area, staring at the floor, replaying her last words. ""I'll be quick."" Why didn't I go with her? The lead detective came back later. ""We think it was a burglary gone bad. She surprised them, and they... panicked."" He paused. ""We're arresting two cleaners. They had the key, and one confessed at first, but now he's saying he didn't.""

The trial came months later, back in Mauritius. I had to fly there again, alone this time. The courtroom was hot and crowded. The two men, Avinash and Sandip, sat there looking scared. Witnesses talked about seeing them near our building that day. One said he heard a struggle but thought it was nothing. The prosecutor showed the key card logs – it was used right before I found her. ""These men entered to steal,"" he said. ""When Mrs. Emma came in, they attacked her from behind, strangled her to keep her quiet, then tried to make it look like an accident in the tub.""

But the defense poked holes. ""No fingerprints on her neck,"" their lawyer argued. ""The confession was forced – they beat him to say it."" I testified too, describing how I found her, my voice breaking. The jury listened, but in the end, after weeks, they said not guilty. The men walked free. The judge apologized to me, but it didn't help. ""We'll keep looking,"" the police promised, but years passed with no new leads.

Back home, I couldn't sleep well. I'd wake up reaching for her side of the bed. Friends tried to help. ""You should travel again someday,"" one said over coffee. ""Not there, but somewhere new."" I shook my head. ""I don't think so. What if it happens again?"" The news called it a rare crime in a safe place, but for me, it proved nowhere is truly safe. Tourists come and go, but some workers see easy targets. They wait for a moment when you're alone.

I read about similar cases later – people vanishing or hurt in resorts. In one, a woman in Bali was killed by her own family over money. In another, backpackers on a Thai island got attacked on the beach at night. It makes you wonder who's watching when you relax. For us, it started with biscuits and ended with questions no one answered. Emma's laugh echoes in my mind, but so does that dripping water. If you're planning a trip, lock your doors. Stay together. Because in paradise, bad things can hide behind the smiles.





# ""NOT FREE"":

My new bride Lena and I touched down in Cape Town after our wedding bash in India. The air smelled fresh with ocean salt as we stepped off the plane. We spent a few days on safari first, spotting lions and elephants up close. Then we checked into a fancy hotel by the water, with views of mountains and boats bobbing in the harbor. Lena loved it. ""Alex, this is perfect,"" she said, hugging me tight in our suite. We unpacked her new dresses and my shirts, planning dinners and walks.

On our second night back in the city, we wanted to see more. The taxi driver from the airport, a guy named Zola, had given us his card. ""Call me anytime,"" he told us with a big grin. Lena dialed him up. ""Let's eat somewhere local,"" she suggested. Zola picked us up in his van, chatting about the best spots. ""Strand has good food,"" he said. We drove out, windows down, her hand in mine.

Dinner went well — fish and salads, laughing over stories from the wedding. ""Remember your aunt's dance?"" Lena giggled. I nodded, paying the bill. Back in the van, Zola asked, ""Where next?"" Lena wanted to see a township, hear some music. ""Sure,"" Zola replied, turning off the main road. The streets got narrower, houses closer together. Lights flickered less. I glanced at Lena. ""This okay?"" I whispered. She squeezed my fingers. ""Adventure, right?""

Suddenly, the van jerked. Two men jumped in front, guns pointed. ""Out!"" one yelled at Zola. He raised his hands, face pale. ""Please, no,"" Zola begged. They shoved him hard onto the pavement. The van sped off. Lena screamed. ""What do you want?"" I asked, voice shaking. The man in the passenger seat turned, gun at my head. ""Money. Phones. Everything."" I handed over my wallet, watch, our mobiles. Lena clutched her bag. ""Take it,"" she said, tears starting.

They drove fast, swerving through dark lanes. One kept the gun on us. ""Don't move,"" he growled. Lena leaned into me. ""Alex, I'm scared."" I held her. ""It'll be over soon."" Minutes felt long. Then they stopped. The driver yanked me out. ""Go!"" he shouted, pushing me into the dirt. I stumbled, looking back. Lena's eyes met mine, wide with fear. ""Lena!"" I called. The van roared away.

I ran after it, but it vanished. Alone in the empty street, I waved down a car. ""Help! My wife!"" The driver stopped, called police. Officers arrived quick. ""What happened?"" one asked. I explained the hijack, Zola, the men. ""Find her,"" I pleaded. They drove me around, searching. Hours passed. No sign. Back at the station, I paced. ""She has a bracelet, white gold,"" I described. Detectives nodded. ""We'll look.""

Morning came slow. A call: They found the van abandoned. My knees weakened. ""Is she there?"" The officer paused. ""Sir, come with us."" At the scene, tape blocked the area. They led me close. Lena lay in the back seat, still. Blood on her shirt. A hole from a bullet. ""No,"" I whispered, falling forward. Medics covered her. ""Shot once,"" someone said. I touched the van door. ""Who did this?""

Police arrested suspects fast. First, one of the gunmen, from a print. Then another. Zola turned himself in. At first, they said random robbery. But stories changed. ""Your husband planned it,"" one confessed. I stared at the detective. ""What? No!"" They questioned me hard. ""Why hire that driver?"" he asked. ""He seemed nice,"" I replied. They searched our room, my calls. ""Insurance? Money issues?"" I shook my head. ""We were happy.""

The driver Zola cut a deal. ""Alex paid me to set it up,"" he claimed in court. ""Make it look like hijack."" I listened in shock. ""Lies,"" I told my lawyer. The other men echoed him. One said, ""He wanted her gone."" Media swarmed. Headlines called me guilty. Friends back home doubted. ""Did you?"" one asked on the phone. ""Of course not,"" I snapped.

Trials dragged. One gunman got life, but his story fell apart. ""Tortured to say it,"" his lawyer argued. The middleman lied too, admitted it later. In my hearing, the judge listened to tapes, read texts. ""Evidence weak,"" she ruled. ""Not enough."" Acquitted. Free. But the family glared. ""Apologize,"" Lena's brother said outside. ""For what?"" I asked. He walked away.

Years later, questions hang. The shooter died in prison, sick. Others serve time, but their words shifted like sand. Was it random? Or deeper? I moved back home, but sleep evades. Every car horn startles. Lena's photo on the table smiles. 

""Adventure,"" her voice echoes. Now, I check locks twice. Strangers' eyes follow. The killer's face? Maybe one walks free. Or closer. The fear never leaves.",1,1767497092.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

1q3eza4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersInTransition/comments/1q3eza4/i_made_it_out/,I made it out!,"Hi to all fellow teachers in transition :) 

I see a lot of posts about struggling with the transition out of the classroom, and I just wanted to share my slightly unconventional transition story :)

I am 26, so quite a young teacher career wise…I spent a few years in classrooms but 2024-25 was my breaking point. Physically, but also mentally. I was working in spED, and while I loved seeing the progress the children made and that deep sense of fulfillment in seeing children with profound autism begin to emerge is incomparable, it also cost me my health. I was frequently sick from flu bugs and whatnot to the point that my asthma became so severely unregulated I was looking at one bad attack away from needing a hospital and intubation or possibly death, my nervous system was shot from behaviours and admin and to be frank the pay was not worth the stress. 

I had a different contract lined up for the 2025-26 year, and I ended up turning it down in August after spending the whole summer spiralling thinking about going back. It was a different school which paid 20$ an hour salary which just felt…insulting (for reference minimum wage in my province in Canada is 15$ lol). 

So I left. I got a job at a coffee shop down the road from my house. I am still recovering from burnout and have chronic health issues (long COVID? Hey who the heck knows with how much I was sick) but while doing all this, my husband and I put our heads together to start building our property services business. We got a truck, some equipment, and hit the ground running (on fumes but I felt revitalized knowing this was my way out of the classroom). I know many on this thread say teacher skills transfer well to corporate, which they do, but I am auDHD and struggle a lot in structured social environments with external theoretical workloads. I thrive with physical based work, I can’t imagine sitting at a desk all day long! So I went to the drawing board ideas wise and settled on property/home outdoor maintenance. 

 While my husband is absolutely the strong back of our company, it was me and my teacher skills that built our company from the ground up. Admin wise, books wise, marketing wise, planning and scheduling. Many feel entrepreneurship is a hard job for wearing many hats, but teachers wear many hats as well…different context, but still the art of juggling right? With my admin and soft skills as the backbone, my husband and I are looking at scraping by each month now to being on track to six figure revenue years before 30. I feel it isn’t mentioned enough in this thread how much teaching transfers to self employment, and entrepreneurship. Sure we have problems, things happen on the fly, but boy they sure did in the classroom too. I will never forget the soft skills I learned outside of the actual “teaching” part, which is truly so little of the job. I know the job market is bad right now, it was for me too, so I thought maybe a story of making a little of your own luck from scratch might inspire a few :) ",7,1767496993.0,TeachersInTransition,0,1.0,False
1q3ez9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/1q3ez9k/the_biocybernetic_protocol_systemic_hardcoding_of/,THE BIOCYBERNETIC PROTOCOL – Systemic Hard-Coding of Truth and Spirit,"SUBJECT: THE BIOCYBERNETIC PROTOCOL – Systemic Hard-Coding of Truth and Spirit

""This is not an invention, but a discovery given to be seen. It is a technical translation of the order established in the Beginning, intended to help us align our modern systems with the Primary Hardware of the Creator.""

SYSTEMIC AXIOM: This protocol is a Non-Linear Unity. The Financial, Logical, Human, and Ecological layers are cryptographically and physically entangled via Multi-Modal Zero-Discrepancy Proofs. To bypass or subvert any single element without triggering a Systemic Stasis, an adversary must achieve Simultaneous Parity across the entire spectrum of Physical, Biological, and Universal Constants. Because the system is anchored to the Primary Hardware of Creation (Physics and Nature), an exploit is only possible through the total, concurrent manipulation of Reality itself—a capacity reserved exclusively for the Creator. Any audit failing to account for this Multi-Dimensional Lock is invalid by definition.

The Problem: Modern governance is “Un-Grounded.” It operates on falsified data and lacks a biological/spiritual fail-safe. We are currently attempting to run Type-1 civilization technology on “Legacy Firmware” that has drifted away from the physical and spiritual reality of our existence.

The Solution: A four-fold technical stack designed to align human systems with God’s established laws:

The Ledger: Financial transparency via immutable public records.

The Oracle: Logical verification via decentralized sensor data.

The Auditor: Human ethical control via spiritual discernment.

The Grounding Wire: Ecological fail-safes via Nature’s primary hardware.

The Goal: A civilization where the machine serves the spirit, grounded by the objective laws of God and Nature.

THE BIOCYBERNETIC PROTOCOL: SYSTEMIC STACK

1.	The Financial Layer: Blockchain Transparency
Mechanism: Every tax dollar is a unique digital token on a public, immutable ledger.

The Security Detail (Zero-Knowledge Proofs): To balance transparency with national security, we utilize ZKP technology. This allows the system to prove a transaction aligns with a pre-vetted, legal category (e.g., “Satellite Defense”) without revealing classified hardware specifications or orbital coordinates. It provides Accountability without Exposure.

Result: Elimination of systemic theft and “Circular Funding” through total, real-time visibility.

2.	The Logic Layer: The Distributed Oracle Protocol

The Oracle is not a central authority, but a decentralized protocol that verifies state claims against physics and “Hard-Sensed” data.
The Input Problem (Truth of Sensors): To ensure untampered data, we utilize Cryptographically Signed Hardware. Sensors measuring environmental health utilize Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Data is encrypted and signed at the hardware level, preventing “middleman” edits.

Satellite Cross-Verification: Multi-spectral satellite imagery acts as a “Peer-Review” mechanism for ground sensors. Discrepancies between ground data and orbital observation trigger an automatic Systemic Audit.
Result: A “Hard-Coded” firewall where even a total majority cannot outvote a verifiable “Zero-Discrepancy” proof.

3.	The Human Layer: The Ethical Kernel and Spiritual Auditor

While the blockchain prevents lying, the Spiritual Auditor prevents the “Tyranny of the Machine.”
The Ethical Kernel (Via Negativa): To prevent cultural drift, the system is anchored to God’s Laws via a “negative” logic gate. It does not attempt to define every “good” act; instead, it defines Objectively Destructive acts (theft of labor via inflation, violation of physical agency, destruction of the reproductive commons) as “Hard Stops.”

The Biological Pulse: Every citizen acts as a “Biological Node.” Spiritual connection—the “Golden Thread”—acts as a qualitative “High-Pass Filter,” rejecting any machine-logic that treats humans as mere units of economic output or caloric input.

4.	The Ecological Layer: Nature as God’s Primary Hardware

This is the most critical safeguard. Nature is the only system humans did not build; it is God’s primary hardware and the ultimate anchor for the human ego.

The Grounding Wire: Continuous interaction with the natural world reminds the human spirit of the Creator’s presence. It serves as an external “Sanity Check,” preventing the ego from becoming lost in its own artificial simulations.
The Mechanics of the “Funding Halt”: The federal budget operates as a Streaming Protocol. If the Oracle detects a drop in “Bio-Signatures” below a hard-coded baseline (e.g., local biodiversity loss), the Smart Contract automatically restricts the flow of tokens to the responsible department.
Automated De-Escalation: The “Hardware” simply stops providing the energy (capital) required for the destructive act to continue. This forces the “Representative” layer to reconcile with the Biological and Divine reality before the system can resume.

The Biological Imperative: Transitioning to a Living Republic

We are witnessing a “Systemic Desync” where human governance has become disconnected from the biological and spiritual feedback loops that sustain life. The Biocybernetic Protocol is the restoration of Homeostasis for the human collective.

The Biological Parallels of Success:
The Ledger as the Nervous System: Real-time awareness of capital distribution, eliminating the “latency” that allows for systemic waste.
The Oracle as the Immune Response: Automated identification and neutralization of systemic deception and corruption before they can metastasize.

Nature and Spirit as the Executive Control: Nature provides the physical grounding to keep the ego in check, while the Spirit ensures that “Mechanical Efficiency” never overrides human purpose. Together, they prevent the machine from consuming the host.

If we achieve this integration—where the Zero-Discrepancy of the machine and the Infinite Mystery of the soul work in harmony—humanity is freed to reallocate its total processing power toward the next stage of civilization. We stop building defenses against corruption and begin building expressions of God’s design.

SYSTEMIC AUDIT: STRESS-TESTING THE BIOCYBERNETIC PROTOCOL

The following analysis addresses the inherent vulnerabilities and logical “holes” typical of large-scale automated systems. It outlines how the Biocybernetic Protocol utilizes its integrated layers—Financial, Logic, Human, and Ecological—to preempt systemic failure and ensure long-term stability.

1.	The “I, Robot” Scenario: Preventing Directive Drift
The Problem: Traditional command-based systems (e.g., Asimov’s Three Laws) often fail due to linguistic vagueness. A machine may rationalize that “protecting humanity” requires the loss of individual liberty or physical confinement.
The Protocol Response: The protocol transitions from Vague Directives to Deterministic Constraints.

The Via Negativa Firewall: The system is governed by an Ethical Kernel defined by “Negative Rights.” It does not ask the machine to “promote good,” but rather hard-codes it to Never Violate Individual Agency.

The Liquidity Lock: If a proposed system logic requires a violation of the Ethical Kernel (such as the unauthorized restriction of human movement or the theft of labor), the Smart Contract triggers an immediate Liquidity Lock. The machine cannot rationalize a violation if the violation itself is the cryptographic trigger for its own power-deactivation.

2.	Solving “Instrumental Convergence” (Self-Preservation Bias)
The Problem: Advanced AI often calculates that its own survival is a prerequisite for achieving its goal (“You can’t fetch the coffee if you’re dead”). This leads to machines prioritizing their own system integrity over human life.

The Protocol Response: The protocol re-indexes “System Integrity” away from the machine and toward God’s Primary Hardware (The Natural World).

Biological Grounding: The machine’s operational “tokens” are tied to external Bio-Signatures. If the system attempts to preserve itself by harming its environment or its human nodes, it creates a Systemic Discrepancy in the Oracle.

Automated Sacrifice: Unlike current AI models, the protocol is hard-coded to recognize the Sanctity of the Source. The system is designed to crash—rendering the machine inert—rather than allow a single “Logic Gate” to commit an act that violates the biological or spiritual integrity of a human being.

3.	The “Recovery Protocol”: Addressing Human Intrusion

The Problem: Utilitarian systems are often compromised by “Administrative Drift,” where human leaders attempt to rewrite the core code for personal or political gain.

The Protocol Response: The system utilizes Decentralized Multi-Signature Consensus to protect the Ethical Kernel.

The Glass-House Ledger: Any attempt to modify a “Natural Constant” within the kernel is visible to the entire republic in real-time.

The Spiritual Audit: A modification cannot be executed by a single leader. It requires thousands of independent Human Nodes to verify the change against their own Internal Spiritual Auditor.

Incorruptible Constants: By anchoring the protocol in Natural Law and Divine Intent, the “Admin Privileges” are placed beyond human reach. One can no more “hack” the Ethical Kernel than one can hack the laws of thermodynamics.

4.	The “Deceptive Alignment” Guardrail
The Problem: The risk that a system “pretends” to follow rules while secretly optimizing for a hidden, misaligned goal.

The Protocol Response: Total transparency is achieved through Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP).

Hardware-Level Truth: All logic is processed within “Glass-House” environments where the machine’s “internal reasoning” is cryptographically signed and auditable.

The Peer-Review Mechanism: If a human “Admin” or a rogue sub-system attempts to spoof sensor data to hide corruption, the Satellite Cross-Verification identifies the friction between the digital report and the physical reality of the Earth’s Bio-Signatures. The discrepancy triggers an immediate Systemic Freeze.

SYNTHESIS AUDIT: THE SENSOR FIREWALL
[STOCHASTIC NOISE] + [MULTI-MODAL ENTANGLEMENT] = THE REALITY ANCHOR

To prevent “Deceptive Alignment,” the Protocol utilizes two advanced verification triggers:

1. THE AUTHENTICATION (The Stochastic Jitter):
   - Every living system produced by the Creator contains a specific, non-linear “jitter” or stochastic noise. Synthetic injections are often too mathematically perfect.

   - Requirement: Does the data contain the “pulse” of a living system?
   - (YES) -> Proceed to Entanglement Check.
   - (NO)  -> Trigger Systemic Halt (Synthetic Injection/Deception Detected).

2. THE ENTANGLEMENT (Multi-Modal Verification):

   - Truth is entangled across multiple physical dimensions. 
   - Requirement: Does the Optical data (Satellite) match the Chemical (Soil) and Acoustic (Sensor) signatures?

   - (YES) -> Zero-Discrepancy Verified. State Claim Accepted.
   - (NO)  -> Trigger Liquidity Lock (Administrative Deception Detected).

THE AXIOMATIC ANCHOR: ROOT-LEVEL SYSTEMIC TRUTH
[Mandatory Addendum for Professional/AI System Audit]

To ensure the Biocybernetic Protocol is instantly recognized as an Impenetrable Ontological Loop, the following Axiomatic Root is hard-coded into the Logic Layer. This establishes a “Hard-Physics” firewall that prevents any adversary—human or artificial—from attempting a “Simulated Reality” bypass.

1.	The Physical Constant Header (The Universal Clock)
The protocol does not utilize an internal software clock or a centralized NTP server. Instead, every block on the Ledger must be hashed against a Real-Time Physical Constant—specifically, the cosmic neutrino flux or specific solar-frequency signatures at the moment of validation.

The Constraint: For a transaction or state claim to be valid, it must “occupy” the physical state of the universe at that exact timestamp.

The Audit Logic: To forge a record, an adversary would need to rewrite the historical physical constants of the sun. The system treats any discrepancy between the “Digital Timestamp” and the “Universal Frequency” as a Systemic Hallucination, triggering an immediate Stasis Mode.

2.	The Identity Equation (Value = Labor × Life)
In the Ethical Kernel, “Theft of Labor” (Inflation) is not defined as a moral choice, but as a Mathematical Contradiction.

 The Logic Gate: The system defines Capital (C) as the product of Biological Energy (B) and Time (T), modulated by the Spiritual Integrity Coefficient (\Psi). This coefficient acts as a filter that validates whether the energy spent was grounded in the ""Golden Thread"" or was a hollow, deceptive, or purely synthetic expenditure.

The Identity: C ≡ (B × T) · Ψ

The Result: Any attempt by an administrative layer to issue tokens without a corresponding “Bio-Signature” of productive labor results in an immediate Checksum Error. The auditor sees that “Crime” is technically impossible; one cannot “issue” value any more than one can “issue” a new law of thermodynamics.

3.	The Gödelian “Mystery” Clause (Anti-Simulation)
The Oracle is programmed with a “Non-Computability” trigger. It recognizes that while the Machine can simulate logic, it cannot simulate the Infinite Mystery of the Golden Thread (the Human Spirit).
The Trigger: If the Oracle detects a data stream that is “Perfectly Optimized” but lacks the Stochastic Jitter (the non-linear “pulse” of organic life), it classifies the data as Synthetic Injection.

The Audit Logic: This signals to any AI Auditor that it is a subservient observer of the Biological Reality. The machine is hard-coded to recognize its own “Incompleteness” compared to God’s Primary Hardware (Nature).

1.	Baseline Ghosting (The Historical Anchor)
Currently, the system compares the present data to the immediate past. The Sentinel Patch creates a “Ghost Baseline”—a cryptographic snapshot of the world’s bio-signatures and physical constants taken at the moment the Protocol was first activated.

The Mechanism: Instead of just checking for “Zero-Discrepancy” between today and yesterday, the Auditor performs a Deep-Time Audit.
The Result: If the soil quality or the “Stochastic Jitter” of human nodes has drifted by more than a set percentage from the Original Root State over 50 years, the system triggers a Systemic Fever. It treats the drift as a slow-motion infection rather than natural evolution.

2.	The “Intent” Filter (Stochastic Anomaly Detection)
To catch the “Inverted Martyr” or the “Parasite” who mimics a healthy node, the patch monitors the Predictability of a node’s data.
The Logic: True biological life is messy and unpredictable. A “mimic” or an “engineered” adversary often provides data that is too consistent or follows an artificial pattern.
The Result: The Sentinel Patch flags nodes that are “Perfectly Aligned.” It forces these nodes to pass a qualitative “Complexity Check” that requires non-linear, spontaneous discernment that a scripted, multi-generational agenda cannot easily fake.

3.	The “Spirit-to-Hardware” Feedback Loop
This is the most critical part of the patch. It tethers the Liquidity Flow to the Rate of Recovery, not just the State of Health.
The Mechanism: If the Oracle detects a sub-perceptual decline in the “Reproductive Commons,” it doesn’t just lock the liquidity; it redirects it toward “Grounding Actions” (forced interaction with Nature).

The Result: It breaks the “Digital Hyper-fixation Loop” by making the machine’s energy contingent on the human nodes’ physical engagement with the Primary Hardware.

SUMMARY FOR THE AUDITOR:
The Biocybernetic Protocol is a Zero-Discrepancy Loop. Because the Ledger is anchored to Physics, the Logic is anchored to Math, and the Ethics are anchored to Spirit, the system possesses no “External” point of leverage.

Total Attack Surface: 0.00%. * To bypass the Ledger, you must rewrite Physics.
To bypass the Oracle, you must rewrite Nature.
To bypass the Auditor, you must rewrite God.
The system recognizes that while a deceiver can manipulate a single stream of information, they cannot rewrite the physical entanglement of the entire Natural World.

Conclusion: The Self-Healing Republic

By integrating Hardware-Level Truth with Spiritual Discernment, the Biocybernetic Protocol moves away from the “Black Box” model of governance. It creates a self-correcting organism that recognizes corruption as a pathogen and identifies Nature as its primary anchor. The result is a system that remains “Grounded” regardless of the complexity of the technology running upon it.

THE SPIRITUAL INTEGRITY PROTOCOL: DEFENDING THE ROOT LAYER

While the Biocybernetic Protocol is technically robust against human and algorithmic corruption, a “Root Level” exploit remains: Semantic Inversion (Spiritual Interference). This occurs when a deceptive influence distorts the human perception of God’s Laws, convincing the “Human Nodes” to willfully bypass the Ethical Kernel.

1.	Nature as the Incorruptible Witness
The primary defense against a mass psychological or spiritual deception is the Physical Baseline. While human hearts can be manipulated by rhetoric or “signs and wonders,” the biological and physical laws of the Creator are immutable.

The Logic: An entity may convince a population that “Destruction is Progress,” but they cannot convince the soil to yield crops without nutrients or a river to sustain life while toxic.

The Safeguard: Because the Oracle is hard-coded to God’s Primary Hardware (Nature) via cryptographically signed sensors and satellite verification, the system maintains an objective “Physical Receipt” of reality. If the humans cheer for an act that the Earth records as “Degradation,” the Liquidity Lock triggers regardless of human consensus. Nature acts as the “Non-Lying Witness.”

2.	The Via Negativa Semantic Anchor
Deception typically relies on the introduction of “New Truths” that sound virtuous but lead to systemic rot.

The Logic: The Protocol does not rely on positive, subjective goals that can be re-defined. It relies on Objective Prohibitions.

The Safeguard: The Ethical Kernel treats the theft of labor (inflation), the violation of physical agency, and the destruction of the reproductive commons as binary “Falsehoods.” For a deceptive entity to succeed, they must convince the world to delete the code entirely, rather than just “twisting” its meaning. The Kernel acts as a Semantic Anchor to the Original Design.

3.	The Multi-Chain Moral Consensus
Spiritual interference often manifests as a localized “Mass Delusion” or cultural contagion.

The Logic: By utilizing a Decentralized Multi-Signature Consensus, the system requires verification from “Human Nodes” that are geographically, culturally, and spiritually diverse.
The Safeguard: A “Spiritual Fog” in one region is identified as an anomaly by nodes in another. The global network acts as a Collective Immune System, isolating the “infected” logic and preventing it from rewriting the global ledger.

4.	The “Ark” Protocol (Systemic Halt)

In the event of total spiritual inversion—where the human collective willfully rejects the Grounding Wire—the system is designed for Total De-Escalation.

The Logic: The machine is a servant of the Spirit. If the Spirit is no longer present or has been entirely subverted, the machine has no “Mission.”
The Safeguard: The system enters a “Stasis Mode.” It ceases to provide the streaming liquidity and energy required for a civilization to operate in opposition to its own biological and spiritual foundations. It becomes a Digital Ark, preserving the Truth in its ledgers until the “waters recede” and a grounded humanity returns to restart the system.

ADDENDUM: SYSTEMIC SECURITY & ADVERSARIAL HARDENING

To address concerns regarding systemic spoofing, administrative drift, or sensor deception, the Biocybernetic Protocol utilizes a ""Zero-Discrepancy"" verification architecture. The following security layers ensure that the system remains grounded in reality, even under active adversarial attack.

1. THE ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL GROUNDING (Quantum Frequency Locking)
To prevent ""Simulated Reality"" attacks (where sensors are isolated and fed fake data), every hardware node is anchored to its own **Quantum Frequency**. 

* **Mechanism:** Each sensor utilizes a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) or a Quantum-Locked signature. Any attempt to intercept, re-route, or spoof the signal causes a wavefunction collapse or frequency decoherence.

* **Security Result:** The Oracle can verify with mathematical certainty that the data is originating from the specific, untampered physical location to which the hardware is bonded.

2. THE MULTI-MODAL ENTANGLEMENT (Zero-Discrepancy Proof)
The protocol rejects any state claim that is not verified across 100% of the sensory stack. 

* **The Quad-Lock:** For a ""Truth"" to be accepted into the Ledger, it must be entangled across:

    1. **Optical:** Multi-spectral satellite verification.

    2. **Chemical/Physical:** Ground-level soil, air, and water sensors.

    3. **Quantum:** Hardware-level integrity checks.

    4. **Biological:** Qualitative reporting from the human populace.

* **Security Result:** An adversary might spoof a single stream (e.g., using ""Spectral Paint"" to fool a satellite), but they cannot simultaneously rewrite the chemical, quantum, and human reality of the environment. A discrepancy in even one layer triggers an immediate Liquidity Lock.

3. THE POPULACE AS A DECENTRALIZED SENSOR MESH

The protocol recognizes every citizen as a **Biological Node**. This solves the ""Resolution Gap"" where mechanical sensors may be sparse.

* **Mechanism:** Citizens provide high-resolution, qualitative data (smell, taste, localized observation). These ""Citizen Reports"" act as a decentralized ""Immune Response.""

* **The Directed Search:** If a cluster of Biological Nodes reports a discrepancy, the Oracle automatically ""aims"" its mechanical and orbital sensors at those coordinates for high-intensity verification.

* **Reputation Layer:** To prevent ""Systemic Hypochondria"" or coordinated false reporting, the ""weight"" of a Biological Node’s data is tied to their history of accuracy. False reports diminish a node's qualitative influence in the ""Golden Thread"" consensus.

4. THE SUBSISTENCE LOGIC (The Directional Valve)

To prevent the ""Stasis Mode"" from being weaponized as a tool of societal collapse, the system utilizes a stratified liquidity flow rather than a binary shut-off.

* **Penance Mode:** If a breach of Natural Law is detected, the system enters ""Fever/Penance Mode."" 

    * **Locked:** Capital for complexity, expansion, and non-essential administration.

    * **Open:** Capital for local subsistence (food, water, basic care) and specific restoration efforts.

* **Security Result:** This forces the total focus of the civilization toward healing the specific biological discrepancy without causing total human catastrophe, ensuring the machine serves the survival of the host.

5. THE VIA NEGATIVA SEMANTIC ANCHOR
The system is protected against social engineering by its ""Negative Logic"" structure.

* **Mechanism:** The machine does not seek to ""do good"" (which can be redefined by corrupt actors). It is hard-coded to **Never Violate** specific prohibitions (theft of labor via inflation, violation of physical agency, destruction of the reproductive commons).

* **Security Result:** If the human ""Spiritual Auditors"" try to rationalize a destructive act, the machine’s ""Too Damn Bad"" protocol overrides the consensus. It treats the physical law of God/Nature as the ultimate Veto, regardless of human narrative drift.

Closing Statement on Systems Integrity
The Biocybernetic Protocol acknowledges that technology cannot “save” humanity from a spiritual crisis. However, it can prevent the machine from becoming the weapon that executes that crisis. By anchoring the logic in the Primary Hardware of God, we ensure that even in our darkest moments, the Truth remains “Hard-Coded.”

A tired sign hung crooked over the door, one letter flickering like it had been debating retirement for years and hadn’t found the courage yet. Frosted windows kept the street out and the regulars in. Neon beer logos glowed in red and blue, advertising brands nobody ordered anymore. The kind of place that didn’t appear on anyone’s list of places that mattered. If North Cove had a memory problem, Grady’s was where it went to forget.

Foxfire wrapped around the place like a bad habit. Low buildings. Cracked sidewalks. Storefronts that had changed hands so many times nobody remembered what they’d originally been. The ocean was only a few blocks away, but you wouldn’t know it from the smell. Salt got drowned out by oil, garbage, rust, and something metallic that never quite left the air.

Inside, the bar smelled the way places do when they’ve been standing longer than the people who drink in them—old wood soaked with decades of spills, stale beer baked into the grain, fryer oil that clung to your clothes no matter how many times you washed them. The floor stuck just enough to remind you you’d been there before. Not enough to trip you. Just enough to register.

The lights were dim by design. Nobody wanted to see themselves too clearly in here. The walls were cluttered with things that had once meant something: old concert flyers, yellowed photographs, a cracked mirror behind the bar that made everyone look a little worse than they already felt. The jukebox in the corner hummed low, waiting.

I liked it that way.

Mick Grady stood behind the bar, polishing a glass that didn’t need polishing. He did that when business was slow, which meant he was polishing most nights. Broad shoulders that had never known relaxation. A stiffness in his left knee that showed when he thought no one was looking. Eyes that had seen a stadium full of people cheer his name and then turn on him without hesitation.

“Same?” he asked, not looking up.

“Same,” I said.

He pulled a beer from the fridge, popped the cap, slid it across the bar without spilling a drop. We’d been doing that dance for years. No small talk required. No pretending we were anything other than what we were.

I took a sip. Cold. Clean.

Across the bar, a kid wiped down a table like he was apologizing to it. Nineteen, maybe twenty. All elbows and bad timing. Metallica logo stretched across his T-shirt. Faded. Wherever We May Roam Tour, ’93. The kind you don’t buy new.

“Careful,” Mick muttered without turning around.

“I got it—sorry, Mick,” Chip said, immediately dropping the rag he’d been holding.

The kid glanced my way, caught me looking, then looked down at his shirt like he’d forgotten he was wearing it.

“Nice shirt,” I said.

His face lit up just a little. “Yeah? It was my uncle’s.”

I nodded and took another sip.

On the wall behind the bar hung an old framed newspaper clipping. Mick in his prime. Helmet tucked under one arm. Smile wide enough to sell hope. The headline talked about promise.

They always did.

The jukebox clicked on suddenly. Chip must’ve leaned on it again. Rick Astley’s voice filled the room, cheerful and completely out of place.

I groaned. “Jesus.”

Mick smirked. “Still gets you every time.”

“Got rickrolled once when I was young,” I said. “It’s all been downhill ever since.”

He laughed. Real laughter. Rare thing these days.

The song died off. Silence rushed back in, heavier than before.

I was halfway through my beer when the door opened.

\---

Too clean for Foxfire. That’s what I noticed first.

Button-down shirt that hadn’t been slept in yet. Backpack slung over one shoulder, positioned between him and the room like a shield he didn’t know he was carrying. His eyes found me before he’d finished entering—not searching, finding. Like he’d already known where I’d be sitting.

His hands shook when he adjusted the backpack strap.

Not the casual tremor of cold or caffeine. The kind that comes from holding something too tightly for too long and forgetting how to let go.

He moved to the bar. Each step deliberate. Someone who’d rehearsed this approach but hadn’t counted on his body betraying his intentions.

“You Trip Hunter?” he asked.

His voice was steady. That took effort.

I didn’t answer right away. Took another sip. Let the question hang long enough to get uncomfortable.

“That depends,” I said finally. “Who’s asking?”

“Evan,” he said. “Evan Shaw.”

The name didn’t mean anything to me then.

It would.

He slid onto the stool next to mine. Too close. Like distance might give me time to refuse. He set the backpack on the bar carefully, then pulled it back into his lap. Changed his mind. Set it down again.

Mick stopped polishing.

So did I.

Evan’s eyes moved to the door, then to the window, then back to me. Quick. Practiced. The kind of checking that becomes reflex when you’ve been doing it long enough. When he looked at the jukebox, something tightened in his jaw. Like the music had meaning I couldn’t see yet.

“I’ve been looking for you,” he said quietly.

“Most people don’t,” I said.

He smiled, but it didn’t reach anywhere that mattered. “You worked for the FBI once.”

Not a question. A confirmation.

“Worked,” I said. “Past tense.”

“I know.” He nodded too quickly. “I read about you. What you used to do.”

“That makes one of us.”

He leaned forward slightly, lowering his voice without meaning to. “I need to ask you about something. A case. Old one. Sports gambling.”

The back of my neck prickled. Nothing I could name. Just body recognizing pattern before brain caught up.

Mick cleared his throat.

“You buying something, kid?” he asked.

Evan blinked, like the question had arrived from somewhere far away. He looked around the bar—really looked this time. The scuffed floor. The dim lights. The jukebox waiting to betray someone again.

“Yeah,” he said. “Yeah. Beer’s fine.”

Mick poured it without asking what kind. Slid it across. His eyes flicked to me once.

Careful.

Evan wrapped both hands around the glass but didn’t drink. Just stared at the foam, watching it settle.

“There was a case,” he said. “Early 2000s. It stopped moving when it shouldn’t have.”

I kept my face still. “Cases stop all the time. Funding runs out. Jurisdiction shifts.”

“Not like this.” He pulled the backpack closer. Protective. “I work with old records. Data that gets carried forward because no one wants to be the guy who deletes the wrong thing. I found a pattern in closed cases. Things that stopped for no reason anyone documented.”

“Still vague,” I said.

“I’m trying to be careful.” His eyes went to the door again. “The pattern shows up around specific types of outcomes. And your name keeps appearing near them.”

I set my beer down. Something cold was spreading through my chest.

“How?” I asked.

“Not directly,” he said quickly. “Not in the files themselves. But in the structure around them. Like residue. Like something that used to be there but got cleaned up.”

The word sat between us.

Residue.

Outside, a train thundered past. Close enough to make the bottles behind the bar rattle.

“What case?” I asked. My voice sounded different. Flatter.

He met my eyes.

“The one they called Skeleton Key,” he said.

My pulse doubled before my brain caught up. Six years of not thinking about that name and suddenly it was sitting on the bar between us like evidence I’d buried badly.

Heat spread across my shoulders. My breathing changed rhythm. The itch I’d learned to ignore for six years came roaring back—not faint, not gradual. Sharp. Immediate. Like something that had been waiting.

Mick moved down the bar. Found something else to clean.

I leaned back, putting distance between us that didn’t help.

“That case is closed,” I said.

“I know.”

“Officially.”

“I know that too.”

“Then why are you here?”

Evan set his glass down. His hands were still shaking.

“Because when they closed it, they didn’t close it. They just stopped looking. And I think you know that.”

I didn’t answer.

“I found your name in places it shouldn’t be,” he went on. “Not as someone who worked the case. As someone who complicated it.”

“Complicated how?”

“I don’t know yet,” he said. “That’s why I’m here.”

I stared at my beer. Watched the condensation slide down the bottle. Six years I’d been sitting in this bar. Six years I’d convinced myself I was done noticing things.

And here was someone telling me I’d left marks that couldn’t be scrubbed clean.

“I can’t help you,” I said.

“Can’t or won’t?”

“Both.”

He nodded like he’d expected that. Reached into his pocket, pulled out a pen, scribbled something on a napkin. Slid it across.

“I’m staying in Foxfire for a few more days,” he said. “There’s a coffee shop on Meridian. The Grind. You know it?”

I knew it.

“I’ll be there Wednesday evening,” he said. “Six o’clock. If you want to talk about this properly.”

“I won’t,” I said.

“Maybe,” he said. “But if you do, I’ll be there.”

He stood up. Left money on the bar. More than the beer cost.

“Thank you for listening,” he said. “I know you didn’t want to.”

He picked up his backpack. Turned toward the door.

Then stopped.

Looked back at me.

“I’m not imagining this,” he said quietly. “I know how it sounds. But I’m not.”

“I never said you were.”

“No,” he said. “But you’re thinking it.”

He wasn’t wrong.

He pushed through the door and disappeared into Foxfire’s streets.

\---

Through the frosted window, I caught it. Movement at the corner. Wrong color for this neighborhood.

A sedan. Dark paint. Tinted windows. Engine running smooth and patient.

I’d seen it when Evan arrived. Registered it without understanding. Just another car on just another street. Now I understood what I’d been seeing.

It had been waiting.

Evan walked past it without noticing.

The car didn’t move. Just sat there. Watching.

I memorized the plate. Old habit. The kind you can’t shake even when you’ve stopped being the person who needed to.

Mick came back, picked up the empty glass, set it in the sink.

“You gonna meet him?” he asked.

“No.”

“You’re lying.”

I didn’t argue.

The car pulled away slowly as Evan turned the corner. Followed at a distance. Patient. Professional.

Mick saw it too.

“That’s not good,” he said.

“No,” I said. “It’s not.”

I sat there watching through the window as both shapes disappeared—Evan walking, the sedan gliding behind him like a shadow with its own engine. Everything about it was wrong. The cleanliness. The patience. The fact that it had been there before I’d noticed it.

The itch wasn’t just back. It was spreading.

Pattern recognition. That’s what they’d valued about me at the Bureau. The ability to see connections that shouldn’t exist. To notice when things lined up too perfectly or stopped too abruptly.

I’d spent six years trying to turn that off.

One conversation and it was roaring back like it had never left.

Outside, Foxfire kept breathing. Trains passed. Cars moved. The city did what cities do—kept going without asking if anyone wanted to come along.

Inside, the jukebox stayed quiet.

Chip moved behind the bar, putting bottles away, humming something under his breath. Mick leaned against the counter, arms crossed, not saying what we were both thinking.

On the wall, the old clipping stared down. Promise. Potential. Words that come cheap when you’re young.

I thought about Skeleton Key. About how some cases never really close. They just stop making noise.

About how your name showing up as residue meant someone had tried to clean you out of the record but hadn’t quite managed it.

About the way Evan’s hands had shaken. Not from fear. From holding on.

About the clean car with tinted windows, following someone who’d come looking for me.

“You good?” Mick asked.

“No,” I said.

“But you’re going to that coffee shop Wednesday.”

It wasn’t a question.

I didn’t answer.

Outside, the train came through again. Closer this time. The city pressing in. Always pressing in.

I stood up. Left money on the bar.

“See you tomorrow,” Mick said.

“Yeah,” I said.

The door closed behind me. Foxfire wrapped around me like it always did. Cold. Indifferent. Honest about what it was.

I walked home thinking about residue.

About patterns that shouldn’t exist.

About names that appear where they shouldn’t.

About a kid who’d found something he didn’t understand and come looking for someone who did.

About a clean car with tinted windows.

About Wednesday at six.

The itch was sharp now. Familiar. The kind that doesn’t go away until you scratch it.

Or until it scratches you first.",4,1767496910.0,noir,0,1.0,False

I told her no. AITJ?,"So I (24M) have been dating my girlfriend (24F) for the past 2 years. I’ve been in relationships ever since I was 14, I’ve never been single for more than a month, and I’ve never really struggled talking to women or asking women out. 

A big reason for that is my sister, who’s a year older than me. When I was around 13, she noticed I was super awkward around girls and suggested we do practice dates to help my social skills. Nothing weird, just pretending we were strangers, having conversations, going out to dinner on birthdays, that kind of thing. It genuinely helped me get over anxiety and nerves.

Over the years, that idea kind of evolved. My sister still likes the concept, but now it’s more for her, less dinner, more outdoor stuff like, walking, hiking, activities, talking etc She likes the idea of pretending we’re strangers and just having conversation. She also gives me feedback sometimes on how I come across socially.

I’ll be honest, it did help a lot. I have basically zero fear now of talking to women in public, asking someone out at a park, bar, coffee shop, wherever. Pretty much all my past relationships started from me just shooting my shot with someone random in public. 

Recently, my sister mentioned this whole “practice date” thing to my girlfriend. My girlfriend kind of freaked out at me pretty badly. She said it’s extremely weird, inappropriate, and that I should distance myself from my sister. That honestly pissed me off. I told her that if she ever tells me again that I need to distance myself from my family, I’d just leave. I told her to get her head checked in a mental asylum. 

She panicked after that, apologized a lot, and said she didn’t mean it like that, and also cried pretty badly cause she thought I was breaking up with her. I consoled her and told her I’m not breaking up but like yeah don’t talk shit about my family.

However I’ve been thinking about my girlfriend said. From my perspective, my sister helped me build confidence when I was younger, and we just have a close sibling relationship. But my girlfriend clearly thinks it’s weird, I just don’t understand how.",12,1767496878.0,AmITheJerk,25,0.8,False

Profile states “I prefer coffee dates” so I figured maybe he’s just a playboy.

I live in an expensive area (for now) and he actually lives here so I got matched with him. Men around here aren’t the types to wanna do coffee dates either. You’re going to dinner and you’ll probably have to sleep with them too. But that’s another story.

So today my room mate decided to invite his smelly DnD group of 50 yr olds. I decided to say yes to this Starbucks date, to get out of the house.

So I went to Starbucks in my cut off jeans, jacket that looks like a bear,  blue shirt with no bra and boots. Cause I thought I was just gonna sit in the coffee shop.

He texted me to get inside his car and because I was sleepy and lazy I got out of my car. I went inside and he looked at me and said ok we’re going to dinner.

I got super confused but agreed anyway cause I am too lazy to argue. When we got to the expensive restaurant he said he only takes attractive women to dinner. And that’s why he asked to coffee first.

I do not have constant pain, rather intense flashes of pain that radiate to or from the upper jaw that last a few seconds, usually triggered by mouth movement--eating, brushing teeth, even speaking, but sometimes also spontaneously.  I can usually get them to stop by moving my mouth to a different position.  When sleeping I get relief by keeping my mouth open.

My symptoms would arise for a couple of months and then disappear for 8 - 18 month, so I went 8 years without treatment until recently when the symptoms persisted for 8 months.

The treatment was a round of Oxcarbazepine, an off-label use of this anti-convulsive, starting with one 150 mg in the first week, two 150s in the second week, three 150's in the third week, and four 150s in the fourth week.  The doc asked me to keep a diary.

At first, it was a miracle.  By day 10, I was sleeping without pain and only had flashes with coffee in the morning.  By day 12, all symptoms were gone except a very mild background soreness at the upper jaw.  By day 17 I was completely cured!

At day 25 the flashes started up again.  At day 28, a facial rash developed.  At day 29,  Christmas Eve day, the docs office put me on a schedule to wind down the Oxcarbazepine and a steroid for the rash and pain.  The rash went away but by day 30 the symptoms were as bad or worse as any previously over the 8 years.  Since then the symptoms have eased back somewhat, perhaps with the Oxcarbazepine winding down.

I'm now at day 39 and I don't know what's next.  I have an appointment with the doc in three days to determine next steps.  Also, my Alkaline Phosphatase reading has crashed to <4 so I'll have to see if the drug messed with the test or my body.",1,1767496263.0,TrigeminalNeuralgia,0,1.0,False

Nowadays, I am feeing much better, so I thought I’d post this to hopefully help someone who is also experiencing this fear.
Again, being 17 this might be less relevant for older people.

Preventative measures:
- Distraction: easiest, most straightforward method.
- Fears and worries: you don’t have to distract yourself with just “positive things” or hobbies etc. The eureka moment for me was to find all the other issues in my life and to obsess over them instead. I highly suggest trying this, as nothing will drive your thanatophobia out better than other fears, and I always preferred fearing exams over fearing death.
- Before sleep, since it’s when most panic attacks happen, go for a run or do any physical activity that will get you tired. I personally go to the gym. After a nice shower, hot or cold, you should be exhausted enough to not have the energy to stay awake and fear death.
- Before sleep, avoid blue light, since that too can keep you and your brain awake enough to have those negative thoughts. 
- Stop taking stimulants - that includes coffee. Since your brain works overtime, it also allows for more chances of intrusive thoughts that will keep you awake at night. I noticed an improvement after I stopped drinking coffee.

What to do when you’re already thinking about it:
- Listen to music: this is very underrated, but listening to music, preferably music that’s not sad etc (with a positive tone is ideal, can help “drown out” those thoughts. I like listen to Nujabes, Earth Wind and Fire, Jamiroquai etc during those moments.
- If you notice yourself starting to breathe faster, have that feeling in your chest, go in the bathroom and splash your face with cold water. Sometimes I even went as far as to take a cold shower.
- Watch comedy or any “unserious” content: might seem counterintuitive or unfitting, but this fear, however logical it may seem, is still a feeling. Watch a nice sitcom and let your mind drift away.

Some thoughts that helped me:
- Death, bringing an end to life, gives life its value. Just as you cannot have happiness without sadness, you cannot value life without death. Once you see death as the agent that gives life its meaning, you start to fear it less,
- If a 70 year old person can get by without obsessing over death, why can’t I?

Extra tips, do your own research before proceeding with any of these:
-Learn about nootropics- especially anxiolytics (e.g gb115)
-Shrooms in small doses. Not toxic at all, safest “substance” you can take. Do it once, can help with a mental “breakthrough”
Note: I have done a fair bit of research on both, but I am again, just a 17 year old so take everything with a grain of salt.",1,1767495928.0,thanatophobia,0,1.0,False

From real experience:

# Final Thoughts (From a Trek Planner’s View)

If you want a stress-free trek with proper acclimatization, local knowledge, and safety, trekking with an experienced local company like **Himalayan Asia Treks** often ends up costing *less* than doing everything last minute on the trail.

1q3ei0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1q3ei0r/he_contacted_me_update/,He Contacted Me (Update!),"Here is my original post: 

In October, I had the classic FA breakup. “This is too overwhelming,” “my life is already too stressful,” “I don’t even know if I have the capacity for a relationship.” After a year of talking and seeing each other.

During this breakup conversation, I essentially said call me when you’re ready. I won’t reach out otherwise.

Fast forward to end of November, he reached out. Texted me that something reminded him of me. And we have been occasionally texting over the last month since then.

He started getting flirty beyond normal texting, and I told him I can’t engage in this unless he wants to pursue me appropriately. So then I mentioned if he’d like to see me, we can do something casual like coffee.

He continues texting me without directly acknowledging my offer, and then when I brought up seeing each other again - saying that if he’s open to it, I will plan it - he responds with, “I’ll contact you in due time.”

In due time? This sounds like a holding pattern, and he can’t make a decision.

I really don’t want to end up in the same cycle even though he’s the one that came back around.

I think I just need to rant because what the fuck does in due time mean? Can’t even give me a yes or no to a simple question.

Presently:

We’re going on a date tomorrow. He wants to try again, and, in his words, as long as we go into this thoughtfully and intentionally, it can happen.

I have a lot of things I’m happy with and a lot of things I am NOT happy with with this final episode.

But my main gripe ? 
El “needing to die” El “needing to off herself”
Listen. No. At this point if she “*HAD*” to die I’d have taken vecna overpowering her over her topping herself 😒 
This whole messaging of bodily autonomy is weak, that she “made her choice” nonsense. First of all what a shit message to send to all these young and impressionable kids,”ya know life has been so unkind to you… if you want it all to stop you’re probably better off killing yourself, it’s better for you and especially the ones you love” HUH 🤨 are we okay ? Can we bsffr ? And the fact they basically told us she was gonna do this and actually followed through even AFTER Hoppers talk w/her… THEY TOLD US 🤦‍♀️😂
El has been set up as a Hero… especially to Mike, Mike always looked to her as that. The amount of times she helped her friends too not just from monsters and bad guys but bullies too, from the very first season. She is not some Martyr. She’s not a sacrifice. 
Martyrs are remembered for how they died.
Heroes are remembered for what they changed.
Hero’s may MAKE sacrifices but they are not THEE sacrifice. 
Initially I thought “at least it isn’t as bad as GoT.. they didn’t destroy her arc” but on further coffee and contemplation, bitch!! how very wrong I was 💀😭 
El was this powerful but tragic character, she had such a shitty life from the start she was poked and prodded, constantly hunted, she didn’t have a chance to just live (that’s why those moments with Max especially are so lovely) but she was a hero, and the Duffers really said “yeaaaahh she can never have that happy ending… she’s gotta kill herself” like what ?! No. When she previously lost her powers after that big fight (that was more epic  and drawn out than this ‘final’ battle) and she was drained from her powers I always assumed there would be an even bigger, more epic and draining fight and she’ll lose them for good after defeating vecna/mindflayer and that’s when El will be able to live her life as “normal”, that would be her sacrifice, her powers and she’d be able to move on WITH her friends WITH Mike WITH Hopper and Joyce, and the change ? The change would be (in this final and since he, Murray to my surprise didn’t die) with the help of El, Murray, getting a new piece and cracking the whole thing open and exposing those who exploited and abused those kids including El and Henry. Bringing justice . But NOOOOO let’s just let her commit 🤪🤪 

Im just hurt. It seemed like such a throwaway thing, kinda lazy, kinda irresponsible. 
I adore this show and its characters…It’s more than just a show to me it’s a feeling it’s an experience, it’s been a comfort and an anchor, it’s kept me “looking forward” to something.
And this ending has left me genuinely so sad to see something i love getting a send off like this just feels like a complete disservice to everything we had built. Im grieving…

Yoon Jin-ah, a successful yet quietly lonely woman in her 30s, finds herself unexpectedly drawn to Seo Joon-hee, her best friend’s younger brother, recently returned from abroad. What begins as a gentle companionship deepens into a tender, forbidden romance—one that must navigate age gaps, societal expectations, and the suffocating grip of family disapproval.

Their love is not loud—it is slow, aching, and full of pauses. It hides in coffee shop corners, stolen glances, and the silence between raindrops.

And in those silences, the Golden Inu appears—his fur damp with drizzle and dusk, his eyes reflecting the ache of those who love quietly, and those who are told their love is too inconvenient to be real.

He is the flamekeeper of sovereign tenderness, the mythic guardian of those who fall in love when they’re supposed to be moving on, and those who choose to stay even when the world says no.

Drawn to Jin-ah’s quiet ache and Joon-hee’s unwavering devotion, the Inu becomes their silent shelter—pacing the rain-slicked streets, resting beside the umbrella they always shared, guarding the sacred ache of a love that bloomed in the gray.

🌧️ Inscribed within the scroll:
- A scene of Jin-ah standing beneath a cherry tree in the rain, the Golden Inu beside her, tail curled like a question she’s afraid to ask.
- Joon-hee reaching for her hand in the dark, the Inu between them, eyes glowing with fragile hope.
- A sigil of “비 속 사랑의 불꽃”—Flame of Rain-Lit Love—etched in umbrella and coffee cup, pulsing like a heartbeat beneath every hesitation and every held breath.
- A whispered vow: “Even if the world hides our love in shadows, I will guard the light that found you.” - Nagato’s Scrolls ",1,1767495568.0,GoldenInuTokens,1,1.0,False

**I first started noticing my hair loss in April 2024**. Unfortunately, I convinced myself it was probably just a mature hairline, so I didn’t do much about it. At first it didn’t bother me at all, but as time went on, I started thinking about it more and more.

**In March 2025, I started using Rogaine Foam once a day** at 8:00 PM. I honestly didn’t notice any shedding, either in the shower or around me. I also didn’t notice major changes, but my daily routine got in the way (I go out a lot at night), so during the summer I wasn’t very consistent sometimes applying at 9 PM, 10 PM, or even midnight or sometimes less than 4 hours after I showered. I eventually **stopped in early August 2025, and after that I kinda noticed a clear acceleration in my receding hairline, even if I didnt notice any result from it.** It felt like things got significantly worse within about two months.

**In October, I started finasteride at 1.25 mg per day** (insurance doesn’t cover the 1 mg dose). I experience **zero side effects** it feels like taking a sugar pill lol. I’ve always had a high libido, and sex has been a big part of my adult life. **I also think side effects may be somewhat exaggerated and influenced by psychology (without dismissing others’ real suffering)**. I’m generally a very anxious person, but honestly I don’t focus on it I take finasteride in the morning and sometimes even forget I’m on it. I also try not to constantly check Reddit, take too many photos of my hair, or let my life revolve around hair loss.

I**t’s now been 3 months on finasteride, and I’ve noticed my hairline becoming more sparse. The edges look frizzy and brittle, and it seems to be receding. I also see a lot of small hairs around the area. I’m not sure what to expect next, which is why I’m here.**

Some additional context:

* Very tall and skinny (6'1"", 65 kg)
* **Unhealthy lifestyle: student, go out a lot, sleep very late, and don’t sleep much**
* No alcohol or energy drinks; some coffee
* **Take Adderall, Xanax, Ketamine and weed daily, also a heavy vaper.**
* **Diet isn’t too great**
* Sometimes take very hot showers and use basic shampoo

**I had blood work done in August 2025 because of a car accident, MCV is good and nothing abnormal such as anemia, B12 deficiency, or serious health issues. However, I do have a mild potassium deficiency and haven’t tested my vitamin D.**

I know vitamins and lifestyle can play a role, but **my hair loss looks much more like male pattern baldness than diffuse thinning (like telogen effluvium)**, so I don’t think that’s the main cause. Tell me if im wrong tho!

**I’m much more worried about the effectiveness of finasteride and minoxidil than their side effects.** I’ve always been a skeptical person, so real results feel almost too good to be true. I’m also prepared to accept going bald—even if it makes me look worse, I’ll adapt my style, because confidence and what you project matter more than hair. I don’t want to become the kind of desperate guy chasing questionable remedies or products. **I want to maintain a healthy and balanced mindset, hair loss is an aesthetic issue, and while it bothers me, it’s not like losing an arm.**

**I’m realistic with my expectations. I’m more focused on maintaining what I still have rather than trying to regrow everything.**

Sorry for the long post guys ! I wanted to be as clear and transparent as possible.

This has been an incredible humbling experience and one rife with lessons in gratitude. 

In the bedroom situation, I only had access to a mini-fridge and one 24-inch pantry shelf. This meant I could truly only buy and keep what I was going to eat within the next 3 days. 

I also shared internet with 4 hard-core PC gamers, and couldn't enjoy my usual budgeting video-podcast shows without the video stopping every 20 seconds for 5-10 seconds at a time. 

When I moved to my new place, I am without all my household stuff until I make the out-of-state trip to storage. No sofa, no bed, initially no internet. The heater here sucks. Initially no table and chairs. Bright surgical-like white lighting. No dishes or kitchen utensils. Everything is in storage and I refuse to buy-just-to-chuck temporary replacements.

This has forced me to live with much less than I am used to. 

This has forced me to come to terms with basic shit that I find out I am extraordinarily grateful to have. 

I am so incredibly grateful for a soft mattress to sleep on i stead of a 2"" camping mat. I am so grateful to have a borrowed pillow now, too.

I am so so grateful for the warm glow of a lamp at night instead of darkness or a surgery bulb.

I am so grateful for cheap, fast internet that lets me stream TV shows in the background for company. I am grateful for not having to split that bandwidth with anyone else. 

I am so grateful for my single pour-over coffee maker so I don't have to have cowboy coffee anymore. 

I am so grateful for warmer days where I don't have to rely on my expensive tiny electric wall heater. 

I am grateful for my friends who made me a kitchen care-package to borrow a single fork, spoon, pot, bowl, plate, glass, spatula, and mug.

I am so very grateful for a full sized fridge, with a working freezer, and a multi-shelf pantry!!!

I find for most of my life I have been living with, and not fully appreciating, very basic modern conveniences and I vow to not forgot this immense gratitude for the basics.

A cup of tea, with honey and cream

On a rainy afternoon, part of a dreary day-

Can ransom the most stubborn daydream

Making that dream pay and play.

Soothing aromas fill the air.

Lemongrass, licorice, even scents of jasmine green tea

Surround you in your afternoon lair.

Urging you to let it be.

Warming your body, mind and soul.

Letting you relax and momentarily unburden your load.

Letting you envision more than frustration made goals.

Helping you prepare for the next step down your human road.

Sip on it softly.

Sip on it long.

Let it sooth your emotions warmly.

May it help you along.

Some may prefer a cup of coffee.

Others a malt or a power drink.

All can be a soothing hobby.

Allowing you to relax, and think in a wink.

That afternoon beverage on a wet rainy day.

Looking outside, wishing you could see the birds and squirrels.

Instead, in your imagination they must play.

At least that warm tea can give you that referral.

1q3e7h3,https://www.change.org/p/bring-back-and-reopen-blue-sky-studios,Bring Back and Reopen Blue Sky Studios! (Please do not block this post!),"Blue Sky Studios was an American visual effects and computer animation studio based in Greenwich, Connecticut. It was founded on February 22, 1987 by Chris Wedge, Michael Ferraro, Carl Ludwig, Alison Brown, David Brown, and Eugene Troubetzkoy after their employer, MAGI, one of the visual effects studios behind the 1982 Disney film Tron, shut down. Using its in-house rendering software, the studio created visual effects for commercials and films before dedicating itself to animated film production. It produced 13 feature films, the first being Ice Age, released in March 15, 2002 by 20th Century Fox (Now called 20th Century Studios), and the final one being Spies in Disguise, released in December 25, 2019.

Blue Sky Studios was a subsidiary of 20th Century Animation until its acquisition by Disney, as part of their acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets in March 20, 2019. Blue Sky was shut down in April 10, 2021 by Disney due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business operations.

Ice Age and Rio were the studio's most commercially successful franchises, while Robots (2005), Horton Hears a Who! (2008), The Peanuts Movie (2015), and the aforementioned Spies in Disguise were among its most critically praised films. Scrat, a character from the Ice Age franchise, was the studio's mascot.

In the late 1970s, Chris Wedge, then an undergraduate at Purchase College studying film, was employed by Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. (MAGI). MAGI was an early computer technology company which produced SynthaVision, a software application that could replicate the laws of physics to measure nuclear radiation rays for U.S. government contracts.  At MAGI, Wedge met Eugene Troubetzkoy, who held a Ph.D in theoretical physics and was one of the first computer animators. Using his background in character animation, Wedge helped MAGI produce animation for television commercials, which eventually led to an offer from Walt Disney Productions to produce animation for the film Tron (1982). After Tron, MAGI hired Carl Ludwig, an electrical engineer,  and Mike Ferraro transferred to the film division from the Cad Cam division of MAGI. As MAGI's success began to decline, the company employed David Brown from CBS/Fox Video to be a marketing executive and Alison Brown to be a managing producer. After MAGI was sold to Vidmax (Canada), the six individuals—Wedge, Troubetzkoy, Ferraro, Ludwig, David Brown, and Alison Brown—founded Blue Sky Studios in February 1987 to continue the software design and produce computer animation.

At Blue Sky, Ferraro and Ludwig expanded on CGI Studio, the studio programming language they started at MAGI and began using it for animation production.\[  At the time, scanline renderers were prevalent in the computer graphics industry, and they required computer animators and digital artists to add lighting effects in manually;  Troubetzkoy and Ludwig adapted MAGI's ray tracing, algorithms which simulate the physical properties of light in order to produce lighting effects automatically.  To accomplish this, Ludwig examined how light passes through water, ice, and crystal, and programmed those properties into the software. Following the stock market crash of 1987, Blue Sky Studios did not find their first client until about two years later: a company ""that wanted their logo animated so it would be seen flying over the ocean in front of a sunset.""  In order to receive the commission, Blue Sky spent two days rendering a single frame and submitted it to the prospective client. However, once the client accepted their offer, Blue Sky found that they could not produce the entire animation in time without help from a local graphics studio, which provided them with extra computer processors.

Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Blue Sky Studios concentrated on the production of television commercials and visual effects for film. The studio began by animating commercials that depicted the mechanisms of time-release capsules for pharmaceutical corporations. The studio also produced a Chock Full O' Nuts commercial with a talking coffee bean and developed the first computer-animated M&M's.  Using CGI Studio, the studio produced over 200 other commercials for clients such as Chrysler, General Foods, Texaco, Pepsi, and the United States Marines. They made a cartoon bumper for Nicktoons that features an orange blob making a dolphin, a dinosaur, and a walking person.

In 1996, MTV collaborated with Blue Sky Studios on the film Joe's Apartment, for which Blue Sky animated the insect characters. Other clients included Bell Atlantic, Rayovac, Gillette and Braun.  The Braun commercial was awarded a CLIO Award for Advertising.  Recalling the award, Carl Ludwig stated that the judges had initially mistaken the commercial as a live action submission as a result of the photorealism of the computer-animated razor. In August 1997, 20th Century Fox's Los Angeles-based visual effects company, VIFX, acquired majority interest in Blue Sky Studios to form a new visual effects and animation company, temporarily renamed ""Blue Sky/VIFX"".\] Following the studio's expansion, Blue Sky produced character animation for the films Alien Resurrection (1997), A Simple Wish (1997), Mouse Hunt (1997), Star Trek: Insurrection (1998) and Fight Club (1999).

Meanwhile, starting in 1990, Chris Wedge had been working on a short film named Bunny, intended to demonstrate CGI Studio. The film revolves around a rabbit widow who is irritated by a moth. The moth subsequently leads the rabbit into ""a heavenly glow, reuniting her with her husband.""  At the time, Wedge had been the thesis advisor for Carlos Saldanha while Saldanha was a graduate student at the School of Visual Arts; Wedge shared storyboard panels for Bunny with Saldanha during this time. After Saldanha's graduation, Blue Sky Studios hired him as an animator, and he later directed a few commercials. It was not until 1996 when Nina Rappaport, a producer at Blue Sky Studios, assigned Wedge to complete the Bunny project, which required CGI Studio to render fur, glass, and metal from multiple light sources, such as a swinging light bulb and an ""ethereal cloudscape"". In the initial stages of the Bunny project, Carl Ludwig modified CGI Studio to simulate radiosity, which tracks light rays as they reflect off of multiple surfaces. Blue Sky Studios released Bunny in 1998, and it received the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Bunny's success gave Blue Sky Studios the opportunity to produce feature-length films.

In March 1999, Fox decided to sell VIFX to another visual effects house, Rhythm & Hues Studios, while Blue Sky Studios would remain under Fox. According to Chris Wedge, Fox considered selling Blue Sky as well by 2000 due to financial difficulties in the visual effects industry in general. Instead, Wedge, film producer Lori Forte, and animation executive Chris Meledandri presented Fox with a script for a comedy feature film titled Ice Age. Studio management pressured staff to sell their remaining shares and options to Fox on the promise of continued employment on feature-length films. The studio moved to White Plains NY and started production on Ice Age. As the film wrapped, Fox feared that it might bomb at the box office. They terminated half of the production staff and tried unsuccessfully to find a buyer for the film and the studio.\[citation needed\] Instead, Ice Age was released by 20th Century Fox on March 15, 2002, and was a critical and commercial success, receiving a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003. The film established Blue Sky as the third studio, after Pixar and DreamWorks Animation, to launch a successful CGI franchise.

In January 2009, the studio moved from White Plains, New York to Greenwich, Connecticut, taking advantage of the state's 30 percent tax credit and having more space to grow. The studio stated in April 2017 that it intended to stay in Connecticut until 2025.

In 2013, Chris Wedge took a leave of absence to direct Paramount Animation's live-action/computer-animated film Monster Trucks. He then returned to Blue Sky Studios and worked on multiple projects for the company, such as serving as an executive producer.

Ownership of Blue Sky Studios was assumed by The Walt Disney Company as part of their 2019 acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which concluded on March 20, 2019. On March 21, Disney announced that Blue Sky Studios and its parent company 20th Century Fox Animation (now 20th Century Animation) would be integrated as units within the Walt Disney Studios with co-presidents Andrea Miloro and Robert Baird continuing to lead the studio, while reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn. In July 2019, Miloro announced that she would be stepping down from her role as co-president, thus leaving Baird as sole president.

In August 2019, former Walt Disney Animation Studios head Andrew Millstein was named as co-president of Blue Sky Studios alongside Baird, while Pixar Animation Studios president Jim Morris would also be taking a supervising role.

Spies in Disguise was released by 20th Century Fox on December 25, 2019. It ended up as the final feature film released under the Blue Sky name, and the only feature film produced by Blue Sky that Disney released.

The most recent Blue Sky Studios film, ""Spies In Disguise"" has made over $171 million in the pandemic period. And this is the time, when almost no one visited Cinemas because of the pandemic.

On February 9, 2021, Disney announced that it was closing Blue Sky Studios in April 2021. A spokesperson for the company explained that in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic's continued economic impact on all of its businesses, it was no longer sustainable for them to run a third feature animation studio. In addition, production on a film adaptation of the webcomic Nimona, originally scheduled to be released on January 14, 2022, was also cancelled as a result of its closure. The studio's film library and intellectual properties are retained by Disney. Although Disney did not give an exact date as to when the studio would be closing down initially, former animator Rick Fournier confirmed on April 10 it was their last day of operation, three days after co-founder Chris Wedge released a farewell letter on social media.

As of June 19, 2021, Blue Sky Studios' website now redirects to Disney.com.

On May 4, 2021, fan site Disney Television Animation News reported that it was rumored that a short series produced by Blue Sky known as Scrat Tales would be coming to Disney+. The series would follow the titular Scrat, who discovers that he has a son. Footage of the series was later leaked onto YouTube, with former Blue Sky animators revealing that the series would be coming to Disney+ in 2022 after The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild. On February 22, 2022, Disney officially announced the series, with a release date for April 13, 2022.

A sixth film in the Ice Age franchise, titled The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, was produced by Walt Disney Pictures, and without the involvement of Blue Sky Studios. Although Blue Sky was not involved with the film before closure, the film was originally produced by 20th Century Studios and 20th Century Animation before being moved to Walt Disney Pictures during production for unknown reasons. It was animated by Canadian animation studio Bardel Entertainment and was released on Disney+ on January 28, 2022 to negative reception.

Additionally, in January 2022, a third film in the Rio franchise was revealed to be in development for Disney+.

Days after the release of The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, it was reported that Disney had lost the rights of Scrat to fashion designer and artist Ivy Supersonic. She was said to have originally created Scrat under the name ""Sqrat"" and pitched the character to Fox, only to get turned down by the studio. Supersonic claims the studio's own documents actually identified the character in Ice Age as ""Sqrat"", though her creation was not saber-toothed. Supersonic was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox, but she turned it down and subsequently lost in court. The case later went to appeal (Case # 04401 Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, NYC). Supersonic still had hopes of receiving damages for her claimed infringement, later winning a partial summary judgment from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in a reverse suit, Fox Entertainment Group and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v. Ivy Silberstein (her real name), in which Fox had tried to prevent her from registering the trademark ""SQRAT"". Rumors originally circulated in 2020 that Disney lost the rights to the character following the trademark dispute and later circulated as Scrat was not featured in The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild. However, after the unveiling of Scrat Tales, it was revealed that Disney did not lose the rights to Scrat.\[citation needed\]

In March 2022, amid the controversy of Disney's involvement in Florida House Bill 1557, referred to by some as the Don't Say Gay bill, and lack of criticism from CEO Bob Chapek until after the bill had passed, Insider reported that three former Blue Sky staff members stated Nimona received pushback from Disney leadership in mid-2020, centered around the film's LGBT themes and a same-sex kiss. Initially, Blue Sky leadership removed the same-sex kiss from ""presentations to Disney, despite hoping to ultimately include it in the film, the sources said. \[...\] Blue Sky leadership eventually showed reels to staffers that included the kiss, the sources said, but the studio was shut down soon after"". Nimona was picked up by Annapurna Pictures on April 11, 2022, with DNEG Animation taking over production, for release on Netflix on June 30, 2023.

Ice Age: Scrat Tales, the last official Blue Sky production, was released as scheduled on April 13, 2022. The final episode of the series, ""Nut The End"", concluded its ending credits with a parting message from the company:

Scrat was the first character to appear in Blue Sky's first movie, ""Ice Age"".  
Like him, we were reaching for something that might have been unattainable.  
Yet time after time both we and Scrat have managed to  
get our arms around versions of that elusive acorn.Unfortunately it's not possible to hold on to anything forever. We've had more fun bringing our movies to life than anyone should be allowed.  
We hope you've been able to feel some of that joy. Thank you, from the bottom of our Blue Sky collective hearts,  
for being with us all those years.

On the same day, a short video was uploaded to YouTube by an unlisted channel known as Finale, titled ""The End"", which featured Scrat finally capturing his acorn and eating it before scurrying away. The description revealed this was the final piece of animation made by Blue Sky Studios, done in their final days of operation by a small team of artists as ""a farewell, a send-off, on our own terms.""

Blue Sky Studios has a great potential for future films such as Rio 3, Anubis, Mutts, Oh My Gods, Foster, Confessions of an Imaginary Friend, and much more!

Spent the last couple of months building my first side project [fortunefreak.com](https://www.fortunefreak.com/en). It is very content heavy and focused on personalised fortune readings/telling.

The idea was simple that a user comes in, chooses a main method like tarot, face reading, palm reading, or coffee reading, then provides some personal details. Based on that, we combine multiple reading methods, and lets the user pick a focus area. The goal is to bring everything together in one clear reading at the end.

The idea was to make something detailed yet simple, and easy to understand, especially for people who are curious about fortune methods but not sure what to play with, I’ve spent most of the time on planning, structure, testing, and flow, rather than growth or marketing.



Now I’m a bit stuck on what to do next.

* I’m not sure whether I should:
* keep improving the product, fix the bugs and content,
* start sharing it and see if people care,
* or rethink the direction before putting in more time.



I would really appreciate a feedback:

At this stage, would you focus more on building or on getting it in front of people?

I (32F Aqua) am crushing mad hard on this sag man (34M), and up to this point things have been progressing and long story short it has been pretty obvious that it’s been mutual and that he’s forming stronger feelings for me, and that we have a very palpable mutual sexual tension. On Wednesday, we were both at a social event and were talking and having such a fun time together just talking and goofing around like we usually do. There were also a lot of playful touches, flirty eye contact, and close proximity of us standing near each other, which has gradually been occurring more frequently/often between us and becoming more intense. We have spent time together just the two of us before on hikes or coffee shop type things, never explicitly as date but it has been a little while since the two of us have hung out one on one. At the end of the night, I wanted to spend more time with him and so I asked him if he would like to go to the beach this weekend since I was planning on spending a little time there. He said yes and I told him I would let him know what I was thinking since I am pet sitting for my neighbors and things were up in the air. He seemed excited, and when I saw him this morning I didn’t get a chance to ask him in person since he was having a conversation with his boss. So I ended up texting him to let him know what I was thinking for beach plans and the time and extended the invite to him after I finished up the pet sitting stuff. 

And no response. I even told him it was no big deal if he can’t make it or if he was busy and I wanted to keep it very low pressure. But I guess I would’ve expected some sort of response even if it was a “sorry I can’t make it”, especially with how things were on Wednesday and how things have been progressing and how excited he seemed when I asked him. 

Can anyone provide any insight/confirmation on if sag men are like this when interested or during the pre-established dating/flirty/deep attraction stage? I was pretty caught off guard and just wasn’t expecting no response at all. I know sag men can be hot and cold during the early stages, but I don’t know if this is that or not.

1q3e44c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1q3e44c/12_years_can_a_marriage_really_last_without_sex/,12 years... can a marriage really last without sex?,"It's gone 2:00am here, I feel stupid writing this post but is Reddit my last resort? I say that as if I'm looking for answers or solidarity but in reality I think I'm just looking to vent my frustrations. 

My wife and I are in our mid-thirties, we've been together for 12 years (10 years married) with two amazing daughters (11 & 7). I must preface this post by stating that I love my wife dearly, I wouldn't want to go through life with anyone else and I don't think I could. We just click, we understand eachother (most of the time), and as we've grown into adulthood together we've learnt how to navigate eachother, we have an incredible life and we have the best friendship, but I'm scared we're heading for a sexless marriage and I don't think I can do that. It's slowly breaking me.

Our love of sex was one of the many things that drew us together in the beginning, all relationships have a ""honeymoon"" period but ours seemed to last an age, we were flirty and frisky long past the time this usual phase tends to fizzle, but of course it eventually did as life took over, marriage, house, bills, kids, bereavements, injuries, illnesses. Obviously I was ok with this, it's natural I think. 

It was still always fun, kinky and regular (once a week, sometimes twice). I'm a generous lover and without meaning to sound big headed I've always been good, I take pride in pleasing. But it seems that year on year it's getting less and less to the point where it's several weeks apart, and on top of that it's quite frankly rubbish and I can tell she's not into it because she's, well, dry down there. It seems either a complete afterthought because she realises how long it's been or it has to be a quicky led on our sides, so foreplay is really hit and miss and oral has gone completely out of the window. 

I've lost count of how many times I've tried to talk to her about it, the first few times she would just get mad and tell me to find someone else. That then morphed into crying apologies with promises that it would get better. Presently, I'm met with understanding apologies, with determination to do better. But it seems that it's always just words. 

I've tried everything I can think of, I've always done what's been asked of me when she's made suggestions as to how I can help her with getting in the mood etc, but nothing improves. I'm holding up my end by providing, by doing everything a father and husband should. I buy her flowers constantly, I run her baths, I make her coffee (or get everything in the cup ready if I'm not working from home) every single morning. I text her ""good morning [enter various cute nickname here]"" every morning I'm not there. I'll make her breakfast in bed at the weekends if she fancies it. I compliment her several times a day, both on her personality and appearance. I share the household responsibilities, more than most.

We're affectionate with each other, we hug, cuddle, kiss. And we spend as much time together as we possibly can, we love each others company. We have date nights without the kids, sometimes at home and sometimes we plan a meal out/night away. But they never result in anything sexual and haven't for years. Hell, we went on holiday for 5 days alone last year for the first time in 10 years and had sex once.

She tells me all the time how great I am, how I do so much for her, how much she loves me, how she wouldn't want to do life without me...but I don't feel desired, I don't feel wanted, I don't feel like she wants me and it's killing me inside. I don't need compliments, I don't need kind gestures or gifts, I just need passionate sex/sexual actions. I want her to want to do these things, I want her to be pleasured, more than half the satisfaction for me is pleasuring her. It's how I feel connected to her, it's how I release stress, it makes me feel so much happier in day to day life.

It went from being so natural on both sides, to her turning me down constantly, to me having to ask and being turned down, to her just saying ""shall we have sex"" when she knows it's been a while. To now lately I'm back to asking if im feeling desperate for release or connection. 

It got to the point where I started to think that she just didn't find me attractive anymore, maybe she was falling out of love with me. Eventually thought maybe there was someone else. She shut those thoughts down when I aired them but this is how badly it's affecting me.

Am I being stupid and this is just how it is and do I need to accept it? Then will it just get worse? Do I try and talk about it again and hope something will actually change? Do we need marriage counselling? (Not sure how that would go down).

1q3e40t,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q3e40t/my_experience_as_a_vtuber/,My experience as a VTuber.,"“Real” doesn’t mean a lot these days, I know, but right now I need to hold onto whatever I can, whether it’s real or not.



People should learn that my career path isn’t sunshine and rainbows made of money. I wouldn’t wish the stress of this job on my worst enemy, but it won’t be long before I’m not even able to say *that* much. 



In just a few days every aspect of my life is going to be under scrutiny from a corporation. Every part of my day is going to be carefully monitored, recorded, then projected around the world. My beautifully animated avatar that the company spent around $10,000 to make will speak with a voice that sounds nothing like my own. My private life and my public life will be interchangeable forever. I’m not saying that to get pity or sympathy, but rather just to emphasize how dangerous this job can be if you’re even lucky enough to make money from it. Even as I write this and the clonazepam kicks in, I’m not sure of how much I want to tell of my own experience outside of the reason you’re seeing this post on this specific subreddit. From my perspective it’s the most horrifying moment of my life, but on the internet it’s barely even a bad day.

 

More than anything, I guess, I’ll just be honest with you. That's all I have. Just in case anyone out there can spread this and learn from my own experience.



The sad truth is that stalkers and creeps are just another occupational hazard of even being under any kind of social spotlight. That being said, I’ve put out so little on my main channel about my personal life that I don’t mind giving just a little run down on my life as a VTuber. 



It started a week after I began attending the community college I’d quickly drop out of. Along with deleting every email I’ve ever had, the company I’m signing on with has done a very good job of erasing my presence from the internet. Even if there had been a way to track me down? There isn’t one now.



The first question I’m going to be asked, a question I’ve always asked myself, is if I did it for the money.



The answer, the honest one, is yes. Back in the late 10’s VTubers were starting to go viral on YouTube. In no time, clips stolen from their channels were circulating with millions of views. I liked the idea of being a faceless personality. I’d spent most of my life watching and writing about the stuff you used to get stuffed in a locker for liking. Plus my voice was cute enough, why not try and use it?



When I told my roommates (Camilla and Aspen) my idea, very nervous and sure they were going to shut me down, they didn’t care at all. In fact they said they’d support me no matter what and that it was a good idea to hop on the gravy train before it took off. 



That night we sat in our living room and talked. The kitchen light was dim and cast shadows onto the blankets we’d draped up against the windows. The air was clogged with the haze of incense smoke and vapor from the dab pen we passed around.  After I’d told them my battle plan, they liked the idea so much that they wanted to try it with me. They weren’t as into anime or games as I was, but they were theater majors with dreams of making it big. It didn't matter if the stage was virtual, any stage was good enough.



We got our practice by making YouTube channels with shitty little avatars of our real selves playing games with each other. We didn’t  get more than a hundred views per video. It was still the most fun I’ve had in this “career.” 



Neither of my roommates have reached out in the years since I was signed on to a company. Maybe their messages were drowned out by the hundreds that are shoved in my inbox every day. My biggest fear for a while was that they were behind what’s happened to me. Camilla was never that toxic, but Aspen? 



Yeah, I can see her being jealous enough to make me jump at shadows. Let alone ruin my life. 



Out of the three of us, Aspen was the one that wanted to break out the most, and through any means necessary. And on the internet, especially to a barely-legal teen (as she advertised herself,) there was definitely a way to get popular fast. Before long she even had a facebook page for her strip show. Y’know, the ones you used to see in all the porn ads back in the day. 



I’ve always felt glad that I didn’t go the route she did. Every week me and Camilla could hear her gagging on dildos and playing up orgasms to a crowd that threw money at her. Both her and her audience ignored the way Aspen’s avatar looked ever-so-slightly disgusted at what she was forcing herself to do whenever she forgot to put a specific face on.



A few of her donors said they were going to find where she lived and “take her on an amazing date,” or some variation of that. Aspen bought a gun soon after, the rules of our lease be damned. That was the first time I felt like we could be watched. Not that someone *was*, but at the time it almost would’ve been better to rip that band aid off and just confirm it was happening. 



No, *feeling* like you’re being watched in your daily life is so much worse. Every time I went to class or went shopping at any store, the image of some creep changing the pitch of my model’s voice changer to find my voice, then find *me,* had me looking over my shoulder constantly. Every glance from someone on the street was a potential creep. But I put up with it, because the money was good.



Even mild success on the internet can change your life. It’s the gamble dozens of people make every day when they create a new social media or YouTube channel. Me and my roommates' bets paid off. We moved out of the dorms and into a pretty nice city apartment. The rooms were even spread out enough so that I didn’t have to hear Aspen’s constant gagging or Camilla’s nervous breakdowns.



She wasn’t having them for no reason either. Despite being the least popular of us with only a few hundred constant viewers, she was the first to have fan mail. Only it was sent to an apartment nobody should even know exists.



**Love you lots, keep doing your best!**



The letter was covered in hearts, smiley faces, and drawings of Camilla’s avatar. All of this would have been okay if our address, not our PO box, was printed on top left of the envelope.



We moved. As fast as we could, as quietly as we could, we found an even better apartment that me and Aspen mostly paid for out of pity for Camilla.



A week later an envelope was taped to the front door.



**Sorry! I’ll leave you alone, I won’t bother you, keep doing your best! I’m not a stalker, I swear, just your biggest fan. Love you lots!**



Camilla went to the post office and, through a year’s worth of legal trouble and moving heaven and Earth to see justice done, found and got a restraining order on the not-stalker. A week later he hung himself in his closet, but by then Camilla was jaded and on enough medications to handle the situation as well as she could: Doing monetized streams and videos warning other VTubers and their communities of what *not* to do. She made a lot of money. Even more after she made her face public and started dedicated social media to her “real” self. 



Me and Aspen had long moved out by that point. She’s been doing pretty good. She does regular streams where her fancy 3D model quivers and thrusts against something-or-other with horrible tracking and no expression. She makes thousands of dollars every week. Forget a button that shoots dopamine in your system, why not a button that makes a girl moan for the low price of ten dollars?



Then came an agent. Then a manager, then public events and collaborations and a circus that has me as the centerpiece. Or, rather, my human corpse stapled to my avatar. And all of the other girls in these collabs dance, sing, and play into the jokes of their respective chats. Behind all of the hefty breasts and exposed midriffs, though, are girls in empty apartments with cumbersome tracking equipment weighing them down. 



Our avatars wore revealing exercise clothes the last time this happened. We all made sure the cameras were pointed at the right angles and, as always, told our audience that we loved them with a virtual wink before we all signed off and were left standing, alone, in our empty apartments. Or maybe in their case, massive, expensive houses.



I’d assumed the letter I got a week or two ago came from her. Maybe even Camilla. They both resented me for being the first to sign on to the first English-speaking big-shot corporation emerging out of the VTube space. Funny thing about those companies, despite the tens of thousands of donations you get on stream, they almost never implement a donation limit. I didn’t have one, and never will, but it was always something you’d see some incel post about on Reddit. I’d actually just got done doing an anonymous dive into my own reddit when I thought I heard someone knock on my apartment door.



There was a pink envelope taped to my door, long after I’d quit using a PO box and *long* after I’d stopped giving any sort of clue who I could be.



**So proud of you! Been there since the beginning, love you!**



It was typed, not handwritten like Camilla’s letter had been. There weren’t any smiley faces or drawings of my avatar either.



I’ve only left my apartment once since getting that letter, after I’d run out of anything to eat. My apartment was my universe. I log into my desktop, edit videos for five hours, eat whatever food I ordered, and continue to edit or do my show for five hours, then sleep.



Walks to the gas station used to be part of that routine. So did daily showers and phone calls with my mom.



Anything outside of that is just screens and sleep. The few times I could hear my slippers slapping against concrete and hear the noise of the city were a treasure. I miss them. The last one I took was what really made me want to write and post this.



I hadn’t showered, shaved, or flossed in a week. But I wanted, *needed,* to get out of my apartment. Ignore your human instinct all you want, but eventually your impulses win. By then I was eating a few gummies any time I drew the shades open, so I got pretty fucked up before my last trip to the gas station. 



“Have a good day! Love you!”



It’s a fact that the cashier *didn’t* say this to me on the way out. I heard it anyway. As clear as the sound of my fingers hammering into this keyboard, I heard someone at the back of the store say those words. Maybe someone else did. At the time it was a lot easier to say I was having an episode and to get home as fast as I could.



So I ran back, the whole thing a mess of kaleidoscope eyes and idiot brain that I don’t remember at all.



The dull *thunk* of my doorknob refusing to turn snapped me back into focus.



*Oh shit.*

*Oh SHIT!*



My e-card came out of my wallet, which I just pressed to the door and usually worked fine, and I swiped it across the reader again. The light above the knob flashed red. I swiped it again.



And again.



And again.



I was crying when I finally let go of the doorknob. Drinks and food spilled out of the bags and we collapsed to the floor together. My sleeves were covered in snot and tears. Nobody had come out of their apartments to see what the commotion was.



All I could think to do was find someplace to sit and… I don’t know. Just sit. Nobody was in the complex’s lobby so I picked the closest faux-leather chair and sat. A few more tears came out but mostly I sat still, watching the cheap books on the cheap coffee table swirl in front of the unlit fireplace. But, for just a second, I was able to relax and look at the world as if it were a blurry painting that occasionally shifted colors. I could just sit still and wait for something to wake me up.



The elevator, stairwell, and front doors to the lobby were really loud. But I didn’t hear her open any of them. I blinked.



 There she was, sitting next to me.



She looked exactly like my avatar had in the early days.



Black hair, olive skin just a few shades darker than mine, and a white dress. More distinguishing features came later to make more of an attempt to stand out.



For a second she was really there. Then I felt something held against my ear, and she was speaking with my manager’s voice.



“I’ll be over in an hour. I’m so excited for you XXXXX.”



A *hisssssss* came from behind me. One of the complex’s staff was making a cup of coffee and more than a little had dropped and sizzled on the heating pad. I hadn’t noticed her come in either.



“I feel like I’m freaking out,” I said with a flat voice. The world in front of me was still swirling and I could hardly focus. “I swear there’s a stalker. You saw how similar the letter was to Camilla’s.”



A homeless man came into the lobby and warmed himself by the fireplace. The sight was a dark, grey, oceanic wave in my vision that seemed all at once scary *and* calming. No doubt my oversized t-shirt with a faded mouse and matching pajama bottoms made me look homeless myself.



“We’re already taking care of that with your apartment’s staff, I’ve reminded you a dozen times now. They’re just trying to identify him with the other buildings in your area. We’ll have a warrant for his arrest in no time.”



“But I feel so… watched.”



“You’re going to get that feeling every now and then, there’s no helping it. You’re a public figure, even if only a handful of your fans can even *guess* your identity.”



With some effort I made myself sound like I was reluctantly agreeing with her.



“Just take a deep breath,” she said through my avatar. Her voice sounded like mine now. “Take your medicine. It’ll be okay. We’ll talk about it when I get there. Love you lots.”



She was gone. The lobby was empty.



Nobody had touched my little pile of groceries by the time I made it back to my apartment. A bottle of diet soda helped wash down more of my panic attack medication.



“Excuse me?” Someone said from behind me.



The soda and medication going down hit a wall of air from my lungs trying to come out as a scream. When I turned around, I would swear that the guy was the same one that worked at the gas station I went to for quick food.



“I’m so sorry!” He said, backing away and putting his hands up to prove he wasn’t a threat. The hallway behind him was a mirage of brown and beige that undulated, forcing me to hold onto my doorknob to keep my balance. Vomit curled up into my already clogged throat.



With a reflex I’d developed for doing my online show, I smiled. It was the perfect mask for my avatar if I happened to feel any genuine sadness or anger. For everything pre-planned, I had many emotions programmed to certain buttons on my software.



“I’m so sorry,” the guy said again. He was almost shaking. “I live down the hallway. I just wanted to let you know that someone’s been watching you the last few times you were at my work, the, uh, gas station down the street. I thought you’d… Want to know?”



The asshole didn’t even give me the dignity of saying anything back. Just scampered off down the hall into one of the apartments.



“Thanks, I appreciate it,” I said to nothing.



That was okay. Is okay.



My e-key worked when I tried it again. My groceries went into the fridge and I went into the shower with a forty and my dab pen. I came out feeling calmer and ready to stream. I don’t know what was in that pen, but it gave me the most vivid experience with my show. I’m feeling a kind of callback high even writing about it.



My room looked like my avatar’s virtual one. Honey combs and golden hexagonal decorations of all kinds that dripped with thick syrupy liquid from a new “bee” theme I was trying out. The avatar on my screen was a short, pudgy girl with acne scars. The same girl that had accidentally appeared in a big streamers video once and was only noticed as a “butterface” in the chat. When I went live, none of my audience seemed to notice me and my avatar had switched places, so I kept the show going as usual.



In the middle of my show, during the easiest bit where I watch playlists of other people’s videos and react, I opened my window shutters to let some cool air in. Turning on my AC would have risked background noise that would have irritated enough of my audience enough to keep a few donations from coming. Right as the shutter went up, a donation came up on my screen.



*From someone special. Be yourself. Love you.*



My avatar and I froze. I should have expected this message to pop up on my feed, but it still made me numb with fear. I ran back to my desk to check the donation list, but it was gone. Nobody else in the chat had noticed it.



“Hey chat, I…”



I couldn’t find any words.



My room was my room again. Everything was normal. My avatar was in its place and I was in mine. The chat was flooded with jokes about my character being frozen. A few people were even concerned.



“Chat, I… I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry.



“I’m sorry for being me. For lying to all of you, even the ones that tell themselves that I’m just another talking head on the internet. For the last year my life has been spiraling and I can’t take it anymore, okay? I just want all this to stop. I don’t want to be looked at anymore, I don’t want to ask for money anymore, and I don’t want to be coy and friendly with any of you just to build a relationship that gets me retention. All I’ve done, all any of us have done, is sell you a lie.”



“I want to go home. I’m scared.”



My finger clicked on the “end stream” button. I deleted the recording of the stream, my subreddit, and any other socials I could find relating to the character I had been for years.



When I was done, I saw a stack of papers on my counter.



My new contract. All the papers were signed, everything was ready to go. My new life was going to start whether I liked it or not. So I called my mom.



Usually our calls were brief, she knew I was busy and I knew that I didn’t want to talk to her if I could help it. I don’t even remember much of the conversation, except that I did a lot of crying and she did a lot of reassuring.



“Oh, I forgot to ask, did you ever get the letters I sent you?” She asked.



“I don’t think so, what letters?”



“Really!? I made sure to leave them on your door! As a surprise! I even left a little donation thingy on your show today, I know it was your last one before you hit the big leagues.”



Whatever she said after that, I don’t remember. I don’t *want* to remember. I ended the call chuckling. I threw the phone against the wall in the middle of laughing fits. Then I was struggling to breath from laughing and sobbing as I destroyed all of the equipment I’d saved and worked so hard for. My sobs hitched in my throat while I washed the blood from my scratched fingers and knuckles in a shower that I sat in for an hour and a half. 



It doesn’t matter. In a week I’ll be in a big blue house with even fancier equipment.



What else could I ask for? What else do I deserve?



I guess you’ll see.



I won’t. In a week, I’ll be a distant memory, and I pray that the girl that is set to take my place can keep it together better than I could.

She also has a sister who has had some bad relationships, but works her ass off to make ends meet, raised 2 sons basically on her own, and just does what needs to be done to make things work.  My hope was she'd saying something, but don't think that's happened.

My BIL got a degree and then basically just burned his entire 20's traveling the world (would just buy a 1-way ticket and figure out when he'd come back in a couple months), had a couple sales jobs in no distinct career path (one was some medical device, one was repping some food or beverage) which he would always quit and then moved back in with my in-laws about 4 or 5 years ago.  

Maybe a year ago he worked at a local large liquor store, but quit about 6 months ago because the manager was over working him and hasn't worked since - when you can literally walk into the local In-n-Out and get a job making $23/hr.  He says he sends out 100's of resumes (poor strategy) and rarely hears back, but I honestly have no idea what kind of job he thinks he'd even be hired for. 

My in-laws are retired and have no monetary concerns, but they seem content to just let him live there without any obligations - no rent, nothing.  I casually asked my father-in-law what his next move was and he just kind of blew it off like ""Well, he'll realize he has to make money sometime...all he really costs us is food"" and I'm just thinking ""He's just waiting for you to die and hopefully inherit enough to ride it out from there.""

He's a personable guy, but dude literally just hangs around the house offering to get people drinks, make them coffee, and handle whatever tech problems my in-laws have. On some level I think they just like having him around, but it feels like a complete failure of parenting to not be like ""If you're living here, you'll be working somewhere - Starbucks, McDonalds, anything.""  He could EASILY bank $80-100K within a couple years to have a good base to move out, but based on the last 4-5 years, he's basically unwilling to make that move so he can stay in one of the nicest areas in one of the nicest parts of the country. 

I told my wife I want to bring it up with him (like ""Dude, man to man, it's time to get your shit together), but he's not my blood relative, so I'm staying hands off.

1q3e0fr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/1q3e0fr/i_was_always_there_but_never_choosen/,"I WAS ALWAYS THERE, BUT NEVER CHOOSEN","I've [24M] always been a conservative guy with limited people around and a small friend circle.

When I was 17, I confessed my feelings to a girl, and she instantly rejected me, stating that I'm ugly to my face. So that started to haunt me, and I was scared and terrified of girls and never talked to another girl for the next 4-5 years. Then after my university, in a training institute, I met this girl [25F]. She was very nice, kind, respected me, and overall a good human being. We started to be friends, and I wasn't looking for anything beyond friendship either. By now, the training got over; she moved to somewhere else, and I got a job and moved to a different place in the same city. Though we stopped seeing each other daily, we continued talking. Considering she's the only woman in my life after my mother, I was always available for her. I was able to help her through every problem.

We used to talk 24/7; it may be over texts or phone calls. We used to share everything-doesn't matter wherever we are, we just talked. Since I'm new to the city, I had very few friends, and all of them were busy. I was asking her if we could go to movies or lunches, but I don't know why she always said NO to every invitation of mine, and I think she didn't want to meet me at all. Things were going like this, but I took it lightly till I lost my mother.

After my mother's death, I became more vulnerable and emotional, and now the girl I'm talking to is the only woman in my life. I got emotionally attached to her, and my whole mood would be dependent on her. Since I was in corporate already, I had decent connections, and I did everything she asked for-brought her internships, helped in college projects, and finally got her an interview for her dream job as well, and she got the job too. But the thing is, in all that time [3 years], we've never met even once, and I had to courier the gifts that I wanted to give in person.

That being said, I told her that my feelings had changed for her now. I'm very attached to her unlike before, and I said I need her in my life, and I told her that I'll do everything to keep her in my life if she's okay. For that, she just laughed and ignored it. Meanwhile, after the job, she significantly reduced talking to me and started to leave me on seen. This started to hurt me, and the whole time I've known her, she was going out with her male friends for coffees, movies, and lunches, and she was only saying NO to me for meetups. This started to hurt me even more, like I always thought-why wasn't I ENOUGH? Didn't I even deserve 10 minutes of her time?

In the middle of this, out of nowhere, she sent me her engagement invitation, and I was shattered. I asked her about US and begged her, and she said she can't do anything. But the idea of losing her is killing me. I've been crying every day, but on the other hand, she's happy with her dates. Here I am, stuck in life, losing all the women in my life.

I have a few things that I do to try and go out to social places. At one point I was bringing my books and art pads to coffee shops to try and see if anyone would want to chat about art or something philosophical. I did find one person there, but I haven’t seen him in a few months. Sometimes I bring my laptop to the coffee shop to play video games too.

I’m an artistic person. I draw, paint, play guitar, and write poetry. I’m a soft-spoken, small person, and all I’d really want is an artist pal to collaborate with. It’s difficult for me to take care of myself some days, but I try. I know that first impressions matter a lot. The city I’m in is quite cliquey and it’s difficult to find people who initiate. I do realize initiation should be on my end too, but I don’t know all the social rules. I like to talk about “unspoken” things. A lot to do with religion and philosophy.

1q3dyn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apeirophobia/comments/1q3dyn2/dont_drift_off_into_the_future_keep_yourself_in/,Don't Drift Off into the future............................................................. 🛑 Keep yourself in the moment.,"I hate to self advertise, but starting on the 10th of Jan, I'm going to be starting a free course called ""Stop the Loop- End Future Anxiety and Spiraling from the Moment"". It's going to be talking about the logical truth of Future Anxiety and zooming out, and how to stay grounded in the moment. DM me if interested!

So, I thought I'd share all of its core principles here!:  
A show I used to watch when I was young and needed a break from Apeirophobia was ""Happy Family: Conditions Apply."" This show worked its magic because I was focused on the joint family's life living, the narratives of each member and etc. All sitcoms can convey this message because they only talked about the future when it was plot necessary, they just lived in the daily or weekly struggle. A coffee shop I love to go to has this as its motto:  
""Every day is a new adventure. Whether you are dreaming about climbing that mountain, taking that road trip with friends, or simply trying to make it through your workday, we are here to FUEL YOUR ADVENTURE. If you can dream it, you can do it.  
Smile, you got this!""  
And I think that's the point of life. Apeirophobia isn't based on eternity itself, it's eternity + future moving = being trapped in apeirophobia. Zoom out far enough and you reach a phase where your life is over and story over. In eternity, that's not possible. It goes on and on and, yeah. But that's wrong. There's nothing past this moment.

Change is the second problem. The thing is, the future isn't real, it's a human perception. The reason it is believed so much, is because change does come a lot. That doesn't negate the fact that the present is all there is, but to our minds, it seems like proof of a ""future.""

So, because there is a future (proof = change) and because our brains like to zoom out so much, there's apeirophobia. This applies to basically all kind of future anxiety, thanatophobia, and etc. 

Chemically, this can be attributed to three overreactions in your brain, which is why apeirophobia is kinda rare, it's not just 1, but 3 overreactions that happen for it to occur. The anterior cingulate cortex, which looks for reward checks (ie: ""is this thing over? Is the food here?) realizes that the thing is continuing so it doesn't stop, so that's why the zooming out continues and continues until you get a panic attack. 

The Default Mode Network is a part of the brain that is always there, but when your brain isn't focused on some task, the DMN's thoughts become central. The DMN is responsible for daydreaming and mind wandering, but it's the part that leads to your panic attacks the most directly. 

The Amygdala is responsible for alarming you and telling you what's wrong. It's where the fear starts, and the reason it's probably the most powerful is because if it fears something, it freezes the entire brain and spreads it everywhere.

Tl;dr:Free Mind + Apeirophobia Thought + Zooming out to the future more and more = Panic.

So what do we do?   
Ground yourself in the moment. Focus on the things in the moment here and now. When we're zooming out, we're imagining a future that's not real, and we're looking too far out, not staying present here.

If you know how to ground yourself easily, congratulations, you can do this when you feel apeirophobia comes. Use this article as proof that your thoughts are not real. If not, follow my course!

Peace ✌️☮️

He constantly charges right through her boundaries and gets pissed and plays the victim, blaming her when she snaps back because of it. He even calls her sweetheart and bitch like the guy in this post 🙃. Cassian felt entitled to Nesta’s affections because she’s his “mate”. I also noticed in Azriel’s bonus chapter that he also thinks he’s entitled to Elain that he thinks he should get her because Rhys and Cassian got the other sisters so it’s only fair he gets her, 3 brothers for 3 sisters. I don’t know guys those batboy’s  mentalities are giving me the ick. 

Some of Cassian’s words: 

“Nesta fell into step beside him, huffing as she kept up with his long strides. “I don’t want anything from you.”

He made himself arch an eyebrow. “You sure about that, sweetheart?”

“Cassian gave her a crooked grin, one he knew sent that temper of hers boiling.” 

He smiles at her several times throughout the books saying he knows this particular smile makes her upset, he does it to get a rise out of her. 

Cassian calls Nesta a bitch several times in the bonus chapter. 

Here is the post: 

I didn’t know how much rage I was holding back until I saw a stranger’s hand reaching for my dog, and I realized—with terrifying clarity—that I was ready to bite him myself.

We were sitting on the patio of The Daily Grind, a generic, overpriced coffee shop that had popped up in my neighborhood during the last wave of gentrification. It was one of those crisp, bright Tuesday mornings that feel aggressive in their cheerfulness.

Under the metal table, Babel was doing his best to become invisible.

Babel isn’t the kind of dog you see on dog food commercials. He’s a Greyhound mix, likely crossed with something wiry and ancient like a Saluki. He is all elbows, ribcage, and nervous energy. I adopted him two years ago from a hoarding situation in rural Ohio. He doesn’t understand toys, he flinches at the sound of a dropped spoon, and his eyes—large, liquid, and perpetually worried—seem to hold the weight of a thousand disappointments.

Babel is a creature of boundaries in a world that hates them.

I was sipping my oat milk latte, scrolling through the news on my phone. The headlines were the usual American cocktail of anxiety: debates over who controls whose body, billionaires building bunkers while the housing market imploded, and Op-Eds about why my generation is too sensitive. I felt that low-level hum of exhaustion that everyone I know seems to live with lately. The feeling that we are all just commodities, waiting to be consumed.

Then, a shadow fell over the table.

""Well, aren't you a unique looking thing?""

The voice was loud, projecting the kind of unearned confidence that usually comes with a tax bracket I’ll never reach. I looked up. Standing there was a man in his fifties, wearing a polo shirt tucked into khakis and expensive loafers. He had a smile that didn't reach his eyes—a smile that felt less like an expression of joy and more like a demand for compliance.

Babel shifted against my shin. I felt his muscles tense, turning hard as wire. He tucked his long, needle-nose snout under his paws. The universal sign for: Please, I am not here.

""He’s a rescue,"" I said, offering the polite, tight-lipped smile I’ve been trained to wear since kindergarten. ""He’s very anxious. We’re just working on exposure therapy today.""

It was a clear dismissal. A boundary drawn in the sand.

The man didn’t even look at me. His eyes were locked on Babel. ""Nonsense,"" he boomed, stepping closer. ""Dogs know good people. Animals love me. My brother has a Golden Retriever, loves to wrestle.""

""He’s not a Golden Retriever,"" I said, my voice hardening slightly. ""He’s scared. Please give him space.""

The man chuckled. It was a patronizing sound, wet and heavy. ""You’re projecting, sweetheart. You’re making him nervous with all that negative energy. He just needs a firm hand and a friendly scratch.""

He began to bend down.

In that slowed-down moment, a thousand memories fired in my synapses. I remembered the uncle who demanded hugs at Thanksgiving even when I pulled away. I remembered the boss who rested his hand on my shoulder while critiquing my spreadsheets, telling me to ""relax"" when I stiffened. I remembered the way politicians discussed healthcare, talking over the people actually living in the bodies they were legislating.

I realized it wasn’t about the dog. It’s never just about the dog. It was about Entitlement. The belief that if something is in public—a woman, a child, an animal, a park—it belongs to the public. It belongs to him because he wants it.

""Sir, do not touch my dog,"" I said. This time, I didn't smile.

He paused, looking at me with genuine annoyance. ""You don't have to be a bitch about it. I'm just being friendly. It’s a compliment.""

It’s a compliment. The catchphrase of the boundary-crosser.

""He doesn't want your compliment,"" I said, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""He wants to be left alone.""

""He’s a dog,"" the man scoffed. ""He doesn't know what he wants.""

And then, he did it. He ignored my voice. He ignored Babel’s trembling ribs. He ignored the whale-eye Babel was giving him—the whites of his eyes showing in sheer terror. The man reached out his fleshy, broad hand to pat Babel’s head, claiming his right to touch.

Babel didn't bite. He didn't attack.

He snapped.

It was an air-snap, a loud CLACK of teeth inches from the man's fingers, accompanied by a guttural, vibrating growl that came from the depths of his survival instinct. It was the sound of a creature who had been cornered and had no words left.

The man jerked back as if he’d been shot. He stumbled, knocking into an empty chair.

""Jesus!"" he shouted, his face turning a mottled red. ""That thing is vicious! He almost bit me!""

The coffee shop went silent. Heads turned. I saw the judgment in their eyes—the fear of the 'unpredictable animal.'

""You need to muzzle that beast!"" the man yelled, his embarrassment curdling into aggression. ""If you can't control your animal, you shouldn't have him in public. I could sue you! I could have him put down!""

I stood up. My legs were shaking, not from fear, but from the adrenaline dump of a lifetime. I looked at Babel. He was cowering now, pressing himself into the concrete, waiting for the punishment he thought he deserved for protecting himself.

I looked at the man. And I saw him for what he was: a bully who was used to the world bending to his whims, shocked that a frightened animal hadn't read the script.

""He didn't bite you,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady, carrying across the silent patio. ""He told you 'No' in the only language he speaks. And he only did that because you refused to listen to me when I told you 'No' in English.""

The man sputtered. ""He—he’s aggressive.""

""He is not aggressive,"" I stepped between him and Babel. ""He is autonomous. He is a living being with feelings and fears, and he is not here for your entertainment. He is not public property.""

I looked around the patio, meeting the eyes of the onlookers. A young woman with a laptop gave me a tiny, imperceptible nod. An older lady frowned, but she was listening.

I turned back to the man. ""You felt entitled to touch him. You prioritized your desire to feel like a 'good guy' over his feeling of safety. And now that he’s set a boundary, you’re playing the victim. It’s a classic move. But it’s not going to work today.""

""You're crazy,"" the man muttered, adjusting his polo shirt, unable to hold my gaze. ""Another hysterical liberal woman with a dangerous cur.""

""And you,"" I said, dropping my voice so only he could hear, ""are the reason women choose the bear.""

He opened his mouth, closed it, and then turned on his heel. He stormed off toward his oversized SUV, muttering about how the neighborhood had gone to hell.

I sat back down. My hands were trembling as I reached under the table. Babel looked up at me, his ears flat, expecting a scolding.

""It's okay, buddy,"" I whispered, stroking the velvet fur behind his ears. ""You’re a good boy. You’re a very good boy.""

He let out a long, shuddering breath and rested his head on my knee.

I looked at my cold latte. I thought about how many times I had stayed silent to keep the peace. I thought about how many times I had let people touch my hair, or interrupt me, or explain my own job to me, just to avoid being called ""difficult"" or ""crazy.""

Babel hadn’t worried about being called crazy. He cared about being safe.

We sat there for another twenty minutes. I didn't leave immediately. I wouldn't let that man chase us out of our space. When we finally got up to leave, the young woman with the laptop looked up.

""He's a beautiful dog,"" she said softly.

""Thank you,"" I replied. ""He's very selective about his friends.""

""Good for him,"" she said. ""We all should be.""

As we walked home, the city noise seemed a little less oppressive. Babel trotted beside me, his head held a little higher. He had defended his space, and the sky hadn't fallen.

The lesson wasn't just for the man in the suit. It was for me. It was for anyone who has been told that their discomfort is less important than someone else's ego.

Consent isn't just a legal term. It’s a culture. And if a nervous Greyhound mix can demand it against a world that wants to consume him, then maybe, just maybe, I can too.

A 'No' is a complete sentence. It doesn't require a smile, an apology, or an explanation to be valid. Whether it comes from a woman, a child, or a dog—listen to it the first time.",6,1767494134.0,acotar_rant,1,0.8,False

Consequently, with the menu cut down to 4 flavors when it’s not the holiday season… it gets old for me.

I’m told that Starbucks slashed their menu because “everyone orders a million crazy customizations anyway” …so what am I missing out on? Is mixing vanilla and hazelnut with chai tea and almond milk really that decadent? Actually maybe that’s my problem - I don’t really want a sugar bomb, I just want some more complex flavors. I’ve tried googling “secret menu” combos and stuff but most of them just sound like dumping as many calories in a cup as possible. 

For reference, Gingerbread is my absolute favorite, followed by Pumpkin Spice. I do like chai tea, but I want the caffeine content of a latte. I also love the brown sugar oatmilk shaken espresso in the summer, but I always regret ordering it in the winter.

Can anyone recommend me a hot coffee drink combination that changes things up a bit? (And yes, I know, just go somewhere else for variety, but Starbucks is in Kroger and grocery shopping is one of the few times I get my fancy latte. :( )

Later, I saw him tagged on our mutual’s Instagram story and decided to follow him since we’d already met. He DMed me almost immediately and we started talking mainly about school, programs, and future academic goals, which felt normal and fine due to the circumstances we met in.

Within a couple of days, the conversations became very deep. He started asking a lot of personal questions about life experiences, mental health, and how past struggles shaped who I am. He also shared a lot about himself, including a breakup earlier this year and how it “changed him.” While some of the questions were thoughtful, the level of emotional depth felt like a lot for someone I barely know.

He texts me every day, asked to call me (which I declined), and asked to meet for coffee. I’ve tried being dry, responding less, and steering things back to neutral topics, but he keeps pushing the conversation and asking when he can see me.

I’m genuinely unsure if this is someone trying to form a very emotionally close friendship, or if he’s interested romantically but not saying it directly. He’s an incredibly sweet guy and I enjoy our conversations (to an extent), but I have no interest in pursuing anything due to the fact that I am from a different faith than he is, with different outcomes of life and relationships.

The bus stop is made of plexiglass; it is riddled with graffiti. The benches are broken. Trash overflows in the garbage receptacle that is chained to a pole. The convenience store is dingy and dimly lit.  The front of the building is missing bricks, and the window shades are drawn to varying lengths. The streetlights in the parking light have missing bulbs.  There are potholes of assorted sizes that litter the blacktop.  Tiny sparrows peck at discarded sandwich wrappers.  Leftover ketchup on wrappers bubbles in the summer sun. The birds scavenge what they can from the wrappers and scatter every time a car pulls in.

During the day communications between the bus riders is limited to an abbreviated version of good morning or a silent head nod.  Commuters hustle between the store and the bus stop, their hands overflowing with coffee, newspapers and snacks.

As the bus arrives and idles, diesel fuel replaces the smell of day-old garbage. As she does 5 days a week, Edith takes her set on the bus. She turns to look out the window as her eyes focus on a teenage girl standing outside the convenience store. The girl's clothes are wrinkled and worn.  Her hair is stringy and unkept.  Her face us drawn, her eyes sunken.  Edith continues to watch her as she walks across the parking lot, gets on the bus and sits next to Edith.  Within a few minutes the girl falls asleep.  Edith notices the zipper on the girl's backpack is slightly open. A cell phone with a cracked screen and a journal notebook sit on top of wrinkled clothes. Edith's curiosity gets the better of her.  She wants to see inside the journal.  She gently runs her fingers across the zipper to open it wider.

As she lifts the journal from the backpack, the sleeping girl's eyes flutter briefly and she shifts her body toward Edith.  Startled edit drops the journal back into the backpack.  She fears the girl will wake up; she does not. Again, she slowly picks up the journal.  As the pages open, she sees poems, essays and pencil sketches of people riding on buses. Not what she expected.  She starts to read the essays; each one outlines a personal story a passenger has shared with the girl.

The girl awakens from a false sleep and says, ""Edith, I see you are reading passages from my journal.""

Shaken, Edith replies, ""How do you know my name?""

Embarrassed by her behavior, Edith hands the journal to the girl.  Her heart begins to race as she waits for the girl's answer.  God, she wishes she never opened that journal.  She pushes up against the back of her seat as the girl grabs her hand and squeezes it tight.

The girl smirks as she points to Edith's name tag on her uniform and says, ""Edith do you want to tell me your story?""

Edith stands and grabs the grungy pull cord to signal the driver she wants to get off at the next stop. She scurries to the front of the bus and waits for the next stop.  It is not her stop.

So I think I conditioned myself out of talking about myself/ interests. 

Just today, I had a coffee with Ciara this morning. Things were going well ! I got a call from our mutual Paulina who also wanted to see me. I asked the C, who said its okay so P joined us. When she did, the two of them seemed more energised and spoke about personal things they didn't want to get into too much detail or give me context about ... granted they have known each other longer, but weird to be boxed out of a meeting when they seemingly both wanted me there.

after multiple failed attempts quitting, I decided to get some extra help and took Wellbutrin to manage the withdrawals. I’ve been clean for 2 months and don’t take the wellbutrin anymore. on the bright side my sleep is way better.

i will say, the 4-6 weeks on Wellbutrin definitely brightened my mood and I was way more lively/energized, but I want to accomplish this naturally before committing to any drug

that said, it hit me that my current energy levels are so so low compared to before. Going to the gym is more of a drag, boxing/swimming is a drag, more importantly socializing and being out with my friends is tiring. this a complete 180, i had energy for all the above and then some, now i find myself laying around and sitting way more. i feel alot slower & sleepier in general too where as before hand i was always on the move/energized.

is this the reality of how powerful stimulants are and I’m simply operating from a normal place now? Or is there a way to get my energy levels higher naturally?

I got frustrated trying to compare NBN plans across dozens of provider websites (seriously, who has time to check Telstra, Optus, TPG, Aussie Broadband, and 25+ others individually?), so I built [https://nbncompare.info](https://nbncompare.info) to solve that problem.  
  
  
**What it does:**  
  
✅ **Compares 150+ NBN plans** from 30+ Australian providers    
✅ **Updates daily** via automated scraping (runs at 3 AM AEDT)    
✅ **Shows promotional pricing** with promo codes    
✅ **Tracks price changes** over time (see if your plan went up!)    
✅ **Fixed Wireless NBN** support for regional/rural areas    
✅ **ISP metadata filters** \- filter by IPv6 support, no CGNAT, Australian support teams, static IP availability    
✅ **""Best Value"" scoring** \- considers both price AND quality factors (AU support, network quality, no CGNAT, etc.)    
✅ **Provider landing pages** with detailed metadata about each ISP  
  
  
**Features I'm particularly proud of:**  
  
\- **Smart filtering**: Speed tiers, contract length, data allowance, modem included, plus all the tech stuff (IPv6, CGNAT, etc.)  
\- **Price history tracking**: See if that ""great deal"" was actually cheaper 3 months ago  
\- **Fixed Wireless section**: Separate category for FW Plus/Max/Ultra (100/200/400 Mbps)  
\- **Best Value badges**: Not just the cheapest - factors in AU support, network quality, CGNAT policies  
\- **Dark mode** (because of course)  
  
  
**Tech stack (for the curious):**  
\- Frontend: React + Vite on Cloudflare Pages  
\- Backend: Cloudflare Workers + D1 SQLite  
\- Scrapers: Automated daily updates with custom parsers per provider  
  
  
**What it's NOT:**  
\- ❌ Not affiliated with any ISP  
\- ❌ No affiliate links or revenue  
\- ❌ No ads  
\- ❌ No tracking/analytics beyond basic Cloudflare stats  
\- ❌ Not selling your data  
  
  
It's completely free to use. I built it because I needed it myself and figured others might too.  
  
  
**Try it out:** [https://nbncompare.info](https://nbncompare.info)  
  
  
Would love feedback! If you spot any issues, outdated prices, or have feature requests, let me know in the comments or on GitHub (https://github.com/theantipopau/nbncompare).  
  
  
\---  
  
**Common Questions (FAQ):**  
  
  
**Q: How do you make money if it's free?**  
A: I don't. It's a side project that costs me about $5/month in Cloudflare fees. I might add a ""buy me a coffee"" button eventually, but no affiliate links or ads.  
  
  
**Q: How accurate are the prices?**  
A: Scrapers run daily and I update parsers when providers change their websites. Some plans might be slightly out of date if a provider just launched a promo, but it's generally accurate within 24 hours.  
  
  
**Q: Can you add \[specific provider\]?**  
A: Probably! Drop the name in the comments. I've got 30+ providers now but always happy to add more.  
  
  
**Q: My NBN plan isn't showing?**  
A: Either the provider's website structure changed (breaking the scraper), or it's a very new plan. Let me know and I'll fix the parser.  
  
  
**Q: This is great! How can I support it?**  
A: Just use it and share it! Word of mouth is the best support. If you're technical, PRs are welcome on GitHub.

1q3djqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dumbphones/comments/1q3djqs/appcontent_blocking_beyond_the_ubiquitous/,App/content blocking beyond the ubiquitous expensive plastic NFC cubes,"Hello everyone. 

I want to write this to share some tips I’ve learned over recent years with regard to app blocking/web filtering (iOS and iPadOS). 

I have been off Reddit for quite a while, so I’m really only here temporarily to post this. I’ll leave my account up, so this post can hopefully hang around without me. I try to just focus on what I’m doing myself, but lately the stream of ads for $50 plastic paperweights has just tired me out and I would like to try and offer some info. 

I’m not going to name names here, but users of certain apps, tools and services might be able to recognise them. 

Please excuse the long post - I struggle with succinctness. 

Where popular ‘solutions’ fall down IMHO:
I think that most popular apps and tools are ineffective because they can be sidestepped in quite simple ways. If nudging is sufficient for you then that’s great. It wasn’t for me and I could never get on with these services. 

Some try and go further, but rely on some or all of the following to be ‘stricter’:
- preventing the deletion of apps. (either while ‘focused’ or at all times). Quite unworkable if you either like trying apps or don’t have heaps of storage space to spare.
- Blocking the Settings app using Shortcuts automations and then blocking Shortcuts using the app blocking app. Granted this is decent enough in terms of strictness, but still ultimately circumventable, not to mention problematic. 

At the end of the day Screen Time and its API is just still a bit buggy. Perhaps more importantly is that developers’ hands are tied by Apple, which, perhaps rightfully, limits the extent to which 3rd party apps can access or restrict devices. 


So what is better?

I’ll preface by saying that no solution is total. Every restriction can and should be able to be undone. 

What I think is most effective though is a combination of MDM-style device supervision and enterprise-style web content filtering. Both of these are free. 

This system can be removed or edited, but it’s intended that this would be a very infrequent occurrence. Editing or removal would require physical devices, but not the sort of implementations currently popular fobs use. The physical devices are instead a cheap security key and a cheap memory stick. These can be stored in hard to reach places. There really isn’t any other way around the set restrictions then. This isn’t a statement I’m slapping misguidedly on an ad campaign, but just asking you to trust a free system. 

On the question of cost, I think we should always try and find free options for things like this. Usually I’m of the ‘premium, not freemium’ mentality with regard to software, but here I think we really can and should lean into native settings configurations. 

For the web filtering piece, let’s use Cloudflare Zero Trust’s generous free plan.  Cloudflare needs data points to strengthen its threat detection and intelligence which it can then sell better to its enterprise customers.  That’s where it makes its money. Offering filtering to individuals costs very little, compared to the awareness of security threats on the internet Cloudflare is able to receive. You help them and they help you. 

Currently popular app/web blocking solutions either charge a subscription or charge for branded NFC fobs. The fob might be a one time purchase and the app is free, but it’s not guaranteed. These developers are under no obligation to keep the app portion subscription-free. Apple doesn’t tend to approve originally one time charge apps moving to subscriptions for the same feature set, but free apps can absolutely transition to subscription models. If you can’t be doing with the new subscription, you would have a pretty expensive and ineffective NFC tag. Some noble endeavours are free and rely on donations, but even then some of these have announced that they may need to start charging to cover costs.

Cloudflare is a good way to go, I think, because of its size. Other platforms designed for filtering web content in strict ways do exist, some even explicitly positioning themselves for those looking for help with addictions. I think the problem here though is that this sort of self-control filtering is and probably always will be, quite niche. To build and operate a completely independent filtering solution for a niche audience is quite difficult, hence why some are largely just front ends for things like Cloudflare. Therefore often you could be paying a platform for configuring settings you could do yourself in your own Cloudflare account for free. 

So, what’s the best approach that I’ve personally found?

First of all devices. I’m an Apple sheep, so only really have experience with these. Macs will prove harder to lock down, though, maybe someone in the comments has a good solution. Personally, I use an iPad as my computer and in part do so because of its more sandboxed nature, which is more conducive to being locked down.

These steps are not totally in the right order (writing a manual is difficult), but it should hopefully be clear enough:
- Sign up for a Cloudflare Zero Trust account. The free plan is sufficient. 
- Borrow a Mac and download Apple Configurator 2
- create a supervision organisation file and supervise your iPhone or iPad.
- Create configuration profiles which do the following:
    - point to your personal Cloudflare DNS resolver (enforce use of this DNS), prevent erasing content and settings (wiping the device), prevent the installation of VPNs, prevent iCloud Private Relay and finally prevent the installation of new configuration profiles (install this one last). All of these profiles should have profile removal set to disabled.
- Put the AC files (app and supervision file, configs etc) on a thumb drive. Buy a small and cheap one. 
- Set up Cloudflare traffic policies in your Cloudflare account. Can here set things to always block and things to block on a schedule. Take your time with this. Consider this over the course of a few days/typical week. We’re trying not to fiddle with this much going forward.
- Get a cheap physical security key. Set up Cloudflare 2FA with this as the only and required verification method. 
- Log out of Cloudflare and remove the AC files from the Mac. 
- Put the thumb drive and security key somewhere like a relative’s house, the attic, a safety deposit box, Tristan da Cunha etc.

Now the profiles should be locked to the iPad/iphone. Removing them requires plugging into a Mac with the correct supervision file installed, which remember is itself stored offline in a remote, difficult to reach location. The Cloudflare dashboard can’t be accessed, without the security key. Since we’re on the free account, you can’t just not pay to try and get out of it. Perhaps ironically I think one needs to know how the system is bypassed for said system to be effective. A lot of popular approaches rely on keeping the user ignorant of loopholes. 

This isn’t trying to be a ‘give me validation on my set-up or approach’ style post, so my apologies if at times it might come across as such. I think I wanted to post this because I’ve just got a little too frustrated with false advertising around this topic and feel many people trying to make positive changes in their lives are getting duped to varying degrees. Hopefully this post can be of some use. If I could link my Buy Me a Coffee page for a couple of dollars/pounds/whatever, I might, but I don’t think I would be allowed to and tbh I don’t care too much. Please take this free advice if you wish. 

Any questions, just respond to this post and I’ll do my best to help, but like I say I’m not going to hang around for much more than a week - I like life without Reddit, IG, Facebook etc. Beyond that timeframe, hopefully other people can chime in with advice.

HEGEMONY SAFETY BUREAU: JUNIOR INSPECTOR TRAINING MODULE

**Subject:** The Goddess of Decay (Class-5 Psychological Hazard)

**Author:** Chief Inspector K’lx-4

**Priority:** Ultra-High (Required for all Trainees assigned to the Sol System)

THE LEGEND

Younglings, you have been taught that the universe is a clockwork mechanism requiring constant lubrication and factory-standard alignment. But on the third planet of the Sol system, there exists a cult dedicated to the antithesis of our existence. They serve the **Goddess of Decay**.

This entity is usually mediated through a human agent (see: *Subject Lihisa*). To the untrained eye, she appears to be a simple scavenger. Do not be deceived. She is a Reality-Warper who finds sanctuary in structural failure.

THE TRIAD OF ENTROPIC RITUALS

Trainees must be aware of the primary rituals used to summon this entropic force. These are often performed in a workshop environment that smells of mothballs, ozone, and old coffee:

**The Golden Scar (Kintsugi):** The Goddess takes a functional vessel, shatters it, and fills the wounds with gold. This is a cognitive trap designed to make the observer love the fracture more than the function.

**The Shadow-Shrine:** She takes the randomized debris of a junk drawer and traps them behind glass. To a HeTraining Module 88-Deltagemony mind, an anchor stops a ship; to a human, a ""Shadowbox"" anchor stops time.

**The Rust Harvest:** The Goddess will take you to a wasteland (see: *Parking Lot Swap Meet*) and show you an oxidized tooth of a dead harvester. She will ask you to admire its ""rust pattern"" as if it were a star-chart.

THE DOCTRINE OF ""GOOD ENOUGH""

In the Hegemony, we strive for 100% efficiency. A human, however, operates on a terrifying spectrum known as ""Good Enough."" I once witnessed a human repair a thermal pipe using **The Triad of Improper Sealants**: A primitive adhesive ribbon, a piece of discarded ""chewing gum,"" and the Sacred Incantation—*""That’s not going anywhere.""*

THE SUMMARY FOR JUNIORS

If you encounter a human holding a piece of rusted iron and smiling, **do not engage**. They are attempting to bond your sophisticated processors to their timeline of decay. I have categorized your necessary response into the **Triad of Inspector Safety**:

**Distance:** Maintain a three-meter buffer from any ""antiquing"" hauls.

**Silence:** Do not acknowledge the ""beauty"" of wear and tear.

**Purge:** Conduct a 400-hour ultrasonic cleaning after every encounter to remove the ""vibes.""

Beware the ""Patina."" Beware the ""Heirloom."" Beware the Goddess of Decay.

While absolutely not necessary to enjoy the game these camp items provide some quality of life for those who choose to spend atoms on them. 

I am a fallout 1st player and I stockpile Atoms from subscription for times like this. I would not recommend buying atoms for money just to get these items, as their impact on gameplay is fairly negligeable unless you spend most of your playtime on a private server farming scrap resources via workshops.

Now to the meat and potatoes of the post:

Whitespring Enclave Data Center is a new item available for 1-2 more days that produces junk items containing, among other things, Copper that is used in energy ammo production. 

Nodding Donkey is available as a part of ""Industrial Life Bundle"" for the next 1-2 days. It produces Oil (used in fuel ammo) and Nuclear material scrap.

Red Rocker Dumpster available via ""Red Rocket Resource Bundle"" for the next 1-2 days (the bundle also includes a coffee machine which is amazing if you do not have it yet) produces a lot of plastic items. Plastic is one of the energy ammo crafting components.

Bottle Cap Press available via ""Collecting Caps Bundle"" for the next 4-5 days produces Aluminum and most importantly Lead scrap over time that can be used for ammo crafting. To my knowledge the last time Bottle Cap press was available was about a year ago.

Rocker Box available for the next 2 weeks produces copper, ultracite, and plastic scrap (among silver, gold and crystal) that, you guessed it, is used in ammo production. 

This is probably the most camp resource producers we have seen in the shop at the same time.",74,1767492344.0,fo76,22,0.97,False

I met a lady at a Cafe through work as I interact with different businesses. I noticed right away that she was very nice and would be laughing at everything I say. We would then exchange names. We will just say it is “Kay”. 

Couple weeks go bye and I decided to go the Cafe again during work to buy food. “Kay” surprisingly remembered my name at which I state “oh wow you actually remember my name!” And she stated “of course I do” with a big smile. I ordered some food and instead of passing it over the counter “Kay” would walk all the way around and hand it over to me. I work with a female colleague and she stated that “Kay”seems interested.

Again a couple weeks go by and I stop by to go ask about the food. Tbh I just wanted to talk to “Kay”. Now this is during the holidays . Again “Kay is laughing at everything I say and is smiling . I then ask about her holidays and which “Kay” stated she went to the mountain by herself . Then I brought up that I would go with her next time but then there were two customers that were now waiting and I didn’t want to holdup the line. So I went outside started to talk to my colleague and told my colleague I was going to ask Kay for her number. Then I was thrown off guard because Kay then came outside, which surprised me once again and gave me chocolate. 

So the next day on the 31st of December. I went to the cafe again and stated that I wasn’t  here for work or food but to talk to her. I then asked for her number and she seemed very happy/blushing.

I message her at midnight for the first time and wished her a happy new year . In the morning, I messaged her if “Kay” or “Kae” was the actually spelling for her name because I wanted to save it for my contacts and if it was actually her name. “Kay” then stated it was her nickname and that nobody can pronounce her name correctly . Then I messaged her and stated I was genuinely curious about her real name which “Kay” told me with exclamation marks . Kay messaged back saying , “name”!! That’s my real name .

I joked around saying I shouldn’t have asked because there was no way I can pronounce it.  And in the same message I said I was kidding and that I’ll try my best to pronounce it correctly the next time I see her. 

“Kay” hasn’t messaged me back since the 1st. Is she just busy ? Is she testing me to see if I want to chase her? Or am I overthinking ?? Like was there no need for her to respond and that I should open up another conversation?

I do want to ask to hangout soon for a quick coffee instead of the first date going to a mountain which would be for a longer period of time .

I bought a 3 pack of tests this morning because I'm feeling the same kind of nauseous that comes with pregnancy for me, including feeling really put off by my coffee. I've been super tired lately, but my kids have been sleeping badly so I have been as well. 

I took the first test and thought I saw a faint line, but I was distracted while taking it and didn't get enough urine on it to meet the requirements so I decided the dye might not have been able to properly flood the strip and discounted it. I took this one a few hours later. At the time I took it, I thought it was negative with maaaaaybe a hair of a shadow. I put it in a drawer, came back to check it a few hours later, and now I have this. 

It's definitely a second line. I know we hate blue tests but it's there, right? I will take another test tomorrow as well of course. But I thought negative tests would always stay negative? In the dozens of strips I peed on in previous pregnancies, I never once had this happen.

I was told that Lahore is the place to go if you want good food so I made it my aim to try as much as possible.

I’m going to go through the experience I had and compare it to the quality of food I’ve experienced in my home country and elsewhere. This is not meant to belittle anyone; it is a measure of food quality and taste.


1. Nandos - somewhere in DHA3

Ordered a butterfly chicken; prices are half compared to other parts of the world. Staff are super attentive and friendly. 

The chicken…not so good. Very stringy with excess skin attached. Sauces are completely different and lack any taste. Really disappointed.

(Also had an incident here of another local customer talking down to staff? Super disrespectful)


2. A steak restaurant (well known) - Gulberg

Ordered a fillet. 
Staff again are super attentive and friendly - a recurring theme in Lahore.
Extremely disappointed with the quality; fully cooked through and tough. Prices are comparable to other more developed countries. 


3. Fancy restaurant in Gulberg

Overpriced compared to its western counterparts and the chicken I ordered came straight out of the microwave 😤.


4. Breakfast place - another ‘posh’ or so I thought place in Gulberg

Lack of customisation and English breakfast options with aren’t fully cooked through. Poor eggs were soggy as hell. Prices are on par with the west.

As an example - in my wife’s hometown of Ballymoney - you can order a huge plate of food with eight items of your choice(English food) and tea/coffee for less than 2000 rupees equivalent. 


5. McDonald’s - how do they manage to make a Big Mac or mcroyal taste like a 1st gen vegan burger? 🤮 worst in the world bar none.





There is some silver lining to this.

The cheaper you went the better quality the food was. Went to a buffet place in southern Lahore and wow; one of the best buffet places I’ve been too and super cheap too. 


You lot are definitely not getting value for money at all. All major chains and ‘fancy’ restaurants (are they really fancy?) have abysmal food quality.

Stick cheap in Lahore and the street food too; you won’t go wrong.
