I know the title sounds a bit rough, but i’ll explain what happened. myself (F19), and my friend (F19), let’s call her lucy, were in the same friend group, and from there got close. we went through a lot together and were always there for each other, and bonded really quick. lucy’s girlfriend of around 1 year(F18), let’s call her jen, was also in the friend group, but me and her never really got that close. after being best friends with lucy for just over a year, lucy and jen ended up breaking up. the relationship had been tense for a few months, and it was about time it ended. at the same time the breakup happened, all three of us auditioned for the same community theatre musical. all three of us got in. however after the first few rehearsals, lucy decided to drop out of the show. so it was just me and jen left. jen was the only person in the cast that i knew, so as someone with raging social anxiety, i naturally i hung around her. after a couple months of long, exhausting rehearsals, sometimes dancing for 6 hours straight, the cast bonded a lot, including me and jen. then, after a cast social gathering that i hosted, jen had to stay the night due to drinking. we ended up chatting till 3am and just clicked. it was the most we’d ever talked and it just felt like we’d been friends for years. i’ve never clicked so fast with someone in my life. at the same time this was all happening, lucy had got a boyfriend, and had kind of disappeared from my life. i respect that when a relationship starts, you enter the honeymoon phase and all you want to do is spend time with them. so i let them be for a month and just did my own thing. but after a while i realised she wasn’t really coming back. we had gone from talking every single day, to flicking each other a message every week or two. i got a little sad, as i felt like i’d lost my best friend. i think she could tell I was upset, and the conversation got brought up. we ended up meeting for coffee and chatting about it all. she said she felt like i was villainising her for being happy, which i felt was unfair. the conversation ended with me apologising for overreacting, and she apologised for nothing. so i felt a bit confused. our friendship wasn’t really the same after that, probably because i felt like she hadn’t taken any responsibility for ditching me. at the same time, me and jen were getting really close. i would say jen was my best friend. i understood the awkwardness of the situation though. i mean i was becoming best friends with my other best friend’s ex. i chatted to one of lucy and i’s mutual friends, let’s call her abby (F19), and asked for some advice. i was aware that lucy was hurt, but i was also the happiest i had ever been being friends with jen, and didn’t want to give that up. here is where I did make a mistake. i didn’t end up talking to lucy about it. but she also didn’t talk to me about it. at the end of our coffee, the one thing we agreed on was that we needed to communicate with each other always. so we both failed to communicate. i have since then apologised to her for that twice. she has not. in my opinion once i have apologised for something, it is her choice to continue to hold a grudge for that. a few months later, i was talking to lucy maybe once a month if i was lucky, and i was seeing jen almost everyday. lucy sent me a message asking to talk. i asked her what was up. and she basically said that me being friends with someone who gave her so much trauma was just mean, and she couldn’t bare to be friends with me while i was still friends with jen. i thought trauma was a very strong word to use, as all that happened in the breakup was that jen fell out of love, and broke up with lucy. jen definitely left it a bit long to breakup, which was hard on lucy, but i wouldn’t call it trauma. i explained to her that i would never go and intentionally become besties with her ex, it just happened so naturally because of the situation, and how much time we were spending together at rehearsals. i also explained to her that i felt like our friendship wasn’t the same, as she had changed a lot, and so had i, and i felt like we just didn’t gel anymore and had gone down two very different paths in life. i followed that up by saying that that is no one’s fault, it’s just a factor of life. i was noticing us drift, and i had decided to let that happen naturally, rather than making a big deal out of it. she got really mad, and didn’t even respond to my message, and we didn’t really talk since then. remember the mutual friend abby from earlier? well she is best friends with lucy, and also my flatmate. i know, sticky situation. we were a close friend group of three for a while, until this whole thing happened with lucy. so on abby’s birthday, she hosted a party at our flat, which lucy attended. we agreed to be friendly for the night for abby’s sake. fast forward a bit, everyone is really drunk, especially abby, so we are sitting in the bathroom and abby is throwing up. lucy then decided that was a good time to bring up our situation, and started going at me with everything i did wrong and blamed everything on me. which i thought was so selfish, considering the birthday girl was literally right next to us throwing up, and this was also supposed to be her happy night. i was so drunk i could barely talk or think, and i joked ‘im so drunk i probably won’t remember this lol’ and lucy said ‘yeah i know, that’s why im saying this now’. well i did remember it, and i find that wild that she admitted to using my drunkness to argue her point, without me being able to defend myself. she basically repeated everything she said in her first message. from the words i could muster up, i said “i don’t think it’s anyone’s fault. i think it’s either both of our fault, or no one’s, but i don’t think this is just on one person”. she argued back and basically said this is all my fault. in my personal opinion, i think we both made mistakes. the thing is i have taken responsibility and apologised to lucy for my mistakes, she has not taken responsibility for a single thing. i also feel like i got put in an really unfair situation. lucy made me pick between her and jen. at the time that she made me choose, i was so much closer with jen, was now at the same dance school, and was seeing her 2-3 times a week. i had seen lucy once in like 3 months. i’ve always struggled with making friends my whole life, and my friendship with jen felt like the most incredible thing ever. she’s such a positive, loving, nonjudgmental person and i’ve never had a friendship like this before, where i feel genuinely loved no matter what, and there’s 150% trust. being her friend makes me so happy. i feel like it’s human nature that when i got made to choose, i chose jen. i feel like i’ve been set up to be the bad person because no matter what, i was going to hurt somebody’s feelings. i honestly don’t know why lucy felt that i couldn’t be friends with both, maybe that’s something i don’t understand as i’ve never experienced love or an intense relationship. so were my mistakes bad enough that im the ah for choosing jen over lucy? or am i right in feeling that i was put in an unfair situation? i genuinely don’t know anymore.

Keen for advice. I am in a management level role in the PS. My manager made the decision to take on my direct reports before I started so I have none. I have close to 20 years of experience in my industry and have always been well regarded at work and given a lot of opportunities. 

Since I started in this (senior level) role my manager has treated me like a new grad and his glorified admin. I’m not allowed to even talk to our executive who I’m meant to be working directly with as per my JD. We’ve had a new starter in the last few months. This person is older than both of us and specialised in another area. This person took a step down but is acting like they own the place - they’re always taking time offline for appointments or to go for coffee with friends, they don’t send anything for review and they also send out things to exec without my managers review. Their work isn’t hitting the mark. I’m supposed to be their first review point but they leapfrog directly to my manager. They also delegate everything and don’t actually produce much work. 

I’ve never experienced this before and I honestly don’t see any point in my role. I’ve tried to talk to my manager numerous times and he just gets very defensive. I’m at a stage in life where I just want a steady job. Has anyone had any success in these situations? ",1,1730966859.0,AusPublicService,0,1.0,False

—————————

I would like to believe that I’ve always enjoyed some of the more mundane things in life. That’s probably why I love photography. It gives the ability to eternalize a memory and displays the beauty in places that often go overlooked. Trees that display stories with gnarled bark about harsh weather it persevered, a spider that spins an intricate tapestry of web to catch its unsuspecting prey, or a flower that stands proudly out from the crowd. But nothing compares to a sunset. The way the sky explodes into an extravagant display of reds, pinks, oranges, and yellows. Sometimes, by a pure stroke of luck, some deep purples and blues will make themselves seen as well. Other times, they are somewhat less noteworthy, just the gigantic ball of gas and fire, slowly falling behind the horizon. But being picturesque does not determine whether or not something can be enjoyed however. To lay in the grass in the warmth of the summer, watching the day turn into night is never an opportunity I would dream of passing up.

Why are these things so often overlooked? Why is everyone in such a rush to get through life? What’s the harm in going slow? Is everyone scared of getting left in the dust of the rampaging bull of innovation? Or is everybody just too attached to the pace of life to even consider slowing down? 

I watched my entire summer unfold through the viewfinder of my camera. Vibrant colored balls that rolled toward tiny plastic holes over astroturf that’s now smooth after being trodden on by toddlers and adults alike. Fibrous wooden blocks with hundreds of tiny nicks and dents on the surface from crashing and falling which they threatened to do once more. Sauce laden chicken wings that left hands, faces, and napkins a mess but were bottomless in both quantity and joy. 

Rarely a sunset though.

But many of my older brother. The older brother that was about to leave for university and would only return if time permitted. The older brother that helped me navigate through life. Everything between introducing me to the gym and being the best chauffeur that anyone could ever ask for, he was there. My tour guide through life would soon be reduced to a small photo of the time we beat an escape room in half an hour together, and some grey bubbles filled with words devoid of real emotion. 

As the closing days of August were quickly approaching, I was frantically doing everything I could to put more sand in the top of the hour glass that seemed to only fall faster out of pure spite. If only there was a plug I could use to slow the continuous flow of the fine sand to the side of the glass that represented the past.

Throughout our last month together I did find the plug a couple times. A few times at the YMCA where we worked out together. A time where we played Farkle by candlelight, because a massive, raging storm had cut our power. Once at a Cold Stone where he won a bet in a landslide against my little brother to see who could eat more ice cream. And one time when I found it on my own in the lyrics of American Aquarium and the mechanical hum of the forest green car we shared. 

I was at Target, searching for the object that best says “Thank you for the world” and “Don’t forget about me when you’re gone” and “I love you man.” I walked out of the store empty handed, because nothing can say all of those things and cost less than the fifteen bucks that was stashed in the glove box in case I ever forgot my card, which I did. As I meandered back to the car, I racked my brain, trying to figure out what a college freshman could possibly need or want or use in between linear algebra and Project X.

Approaching the car that stood alone in the lot, I saw the sky reflecting off the deep, shimmering green paint. The beautiful, brilliant sky. A sky that was filled with a smattering of clouds and colors that were only reserved for coffee table books. Pushing off my prior commitments to my friends with an “I’ll be a bit late” text, I sat on the hill that overlooked the Target. I watched in silence as the sun painted the sky and I listened to the cars speeding by, on their way to a thing that’s so important because someone said so and so would be there, and without the breakneck speed, they would miss them. But look at the sunset. I never took a picture of that sky because sometimes my memory serves me better than just a photo. Also, because my phone was locked in the car so I wouldn’t be bothered by the nuisance of the buzzing and ringing. As the sunset faded I got back into the car, driving east toward my destination and watched the sun finally disappear along the horizon in the rear view mirror. With the windows down as “One Day at a Time” played on repeat. I finally found the plug that fit snugly into the neck of the hourglass.

I'm a European visiting the US for the first time (for work), staying near the Port of San Francisco in the Mission Bay area.

As someone who loves early morning walks and will likely be up around 6 ~ 6:30 AM, where can I wander for about 1.5 hours that:

- Gives me a good chance of spotting a raccoon? (I promise, no approaching or feeding—just hoping to see one from a distance! I've never seen one)

- Minimises risk of being a target of antisocial behavior?

Thanks!

Self harm and some emotional abuse was used to control me and it was really an emotionally draining thing. I had to be there for them to console them of their mental health problems, but when I shared my problems they were straight dismissed.

5th time when they came to break up I said Enough Enough Enough I am tired of all these and how it all was affecting me. I said now I will never come back and they did self harm again and blamed on me.

I again fell for them because of self harm part, I felt guilty for expressing boundaries.
Later they again dumped me on my birthday. This time was the last one and I gave up because I could see my mental health going downhill. All the self harm stuff used to haunt me and kept me up at night. 

They again created a scene in school and I needed to help them cause I had some proofs which were needed to present to teachers bcz her ex was sharing her private chats with other boys and I had proofs.
Our relationship ship started about 2 months later her ex ghosted her, but my relationship with her was partly consensual as I didn't wanted a relationship even though she was my crush. But bcz of her health and I made being feeling guilty for not liking her I partly came in a platonic relationship with certain boundaries.

3 days later I helped with proofs I came to know my chats were sent to her best friend each and everything with screenshot.

I blocked them completely again. Later after a crime which happened in our city she asked one of my friend that it's an emergency and I need to unblock, she was in trouble, feeling paranoid I calmed her down and got back to my work as I had my competitive exam infront which I had prepared for since an year. But 2 days before exam even they knew I had an exam they again started the argument verbal abuse etc and it affected me  I had extreme headache after that I did block them completely, and later on I missed to clear the cutoff by merely 4 marks, during exam too I had stress and headache.

A month later one friend told me it's an emergency I unblocked and I got to know they attempted suicide by them and told the reason is me.

I could now see myself down on the bottom, My mental state was extremely poor and listening to this it affected it more. Feeling agitated ,slapping myself, punching wall, throwing hot black coffee on me cause I couldn't focus and rather had hurricane of thoughts in mind.

This my blocking part was affecting me more than the staying with them part, there was a kind of love from them even if it was a possessive one, I wished I didn't existed, I wish I ruined my face, I wish I threw acid on my face, so that I would bot have to reject them 3 times and come into a forceful hostage relationship.

The story continues but rn I am not feeling well rn. May Post continued part in next post.

1gllf0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_allseasonsdental/comments/1gllf0l/how_long_do_porcelain_dental_veneers_last/,"How Long Do Porcelain Dental Veneers Last?
","Porcelain veneers are a popular choice for enhancing smiles, offering a natural look while concealing imperfections like chips, gaps, and discoloration. Many people considering this cosmetic option wonder, “How long do porcelain veneers last?” Here, we’ll cover what affects the lifespan of porcelain veneers and how you can make them last as long as possible.

**Average Lifespan of Porcelain Veneers**

Typically, porcelain veneers last between 10 to 15 years with proper care. High-quality materials and good dental hygiene can help extend their longevity. Over time, however, veneers may require replacement due to normal wear.

**Factors Affecting Veneer Durability**

Several factors impact how long your veneers will last:

* **Oral Hygiene**: Daily brushing, flossing, and regular dental check-ups are essential.
* **Diet Choices**: Limiting hard foods and staining drinks like coffee can protect your veneers.
* **Teeth Grinding**: If you grind your teeth, using a nightguard can prevent wear and damage.

If you’re interested in [porcelain veneers near you](https://www.allseasonsdentalclinic.com/service/porcelain-veneers/), consulting a professional dentist is the best way to learn about the process and expected results. Your dentist will evaluate your unique needs to ensure veneers are a suitable option.

**Tips to Extend the Life of Your Veneers**

Maintaining good dental habits is key to extending the life of your veneers. Regular cleanings and check-ups with a [dentist in North Kildonan](https://www.allseasonsdentalclinic.com/) will help detect any potential issues early. Avoid using your teeth as tools or biting hard objects to prevent chipping.

1glle32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1glle32,AIO for not helping my mom after her surgery ,"
Couple days ago my mother got a full knee replacement. She was supposed to go to a rehab facility for two weeks. Instead she told the doctors that since I work from home and my bro is unemployed, that we will help her instead. She never gave us an option. She just assumed we would help. 

Days before the surgery I spent over 300 dollars on her. Organizers, refills of various cleaning supplies, food etc… I cleaned and organized the apartment with the help of my sister. It is important to note My brother has done NOTHING at this point. 

Fast forward to day of the surgery. I will attach texts, but my sis texted our group chat and I responded. My bro did not. He was in his room playing videos games so I told her to call him. She called him about 5 times and he NEVER picked up. About an hour later he got mad and said I never made an attempt to tell him anything? (Even tho my sis made multiple attempts to reach him at this point.) An hour later my bro saw me put my shoes and jacket on to walk my mom inside while my sister parked. My brother just made a cup of coffee and went back to playing video games. He then came out 1hr after she got inside and blamed me AGAIN for not telling him anything. 

That night, all we asked was for him to keep the door open and to take the trash out. My bro shut his door EVERYTIME we opened it. (About 6 times) my mom ended up asking him what he’s doing because it’s been an entire day and he still hasn’t taken the trash out. He said not to bother him bc he had headphones on and then made a comment about why he has to help When “OP isn’t doing anything”. 

Which is obviously a complete lie as I have been with my mother all day long and helped out with what I could as my sis and nana were also here doing what they could to help. The first day of surgery went fine. The 2nd and third day is when it gets worse.

For this next part, you’ll need a lil backstory. I have made a prior post on this forum talking about my brother but if u don’t want to go check that out, a quick summary is He has high functioning autism and he does not like me. My mom and nana use his autism as an excuse for everything. Something he likes to do is lie to our family to turn them against me. For example, I will attach pics of his texts to my mom but one morning I sat on the living room couch while my mom wasn’t home. I had headphones on and I was editing videos as that’s my job. I was out there for 30 mins max. My bro walked out and cooked breakfast. The second he went back to his room, my mom called me about leaving the oven on. I was confused as I wasn’t the one cooking. So I looked in her phone and found texts of him telling my mom that I slept out there and blared the TV all night. He said I left The oven on and it was smoking and burnt food was left everywhere. When my mom said “just wake her up” he said That if he woke me up I would start screaming and attack him. 

I want to make a BIG DISCLAIMER. I have never attacked my brother, my family knows this. He started saying this about me since my dad was arrested on charges of child abuse in 2019.  I was the one who went to the cops so I think he holds resentment towards me for that? Idk I don’t understand him as he doesn’t talk to me.

This information is important as he lies about me to my nana. And she believes him and then proceeds to make comments about me every time she’s over. Well, remember what I said about how I helped out as much as I could and my bro just sat in his room all day and didn’t help at all?

My nana came over and first thing out of her mouth was “when are we gonna get OP to start helping around the house because her brother has been doing everything.” I instantly started defending my self. I went into my room to cool off and my sister texted me that she has my back. But my brother heard what we were saying about him and he came out screaming that I was making comments about him. my nana kept sticking up him and kept saying how I treat my brother so unfairly (when she doesn’t even live here to know that. She goes off what my brother tells her) I also want to mention that my mom and sister were saying the same stuff as me. But my brother and nana only got mad at ME. My brother ended up saying “I still have bruises from OP from yesterday” AGAIN I NEVER WENT NEAR HIM? My sis and mom told me to ignore it. My nana went into to his room to comfort him by saying “I know, I know what OP does to u” I started crying and my nana just scoffed at me. she ended up going home but my mom said nana is coming back the next day to “do her a favor at the bank” 

Now this is where I don’t understand if I’m
Being an overreacting pms-ing asshole. 

That night I walked out sobbing, having a panic attack. I told Her to tell nana not to come over that next day. Whatever favor nana is doing, I can do it instead. I pleaded and begged her to let me do it. She just kept telling me to “shut up, go away, don’t talk to me”. She just took out her phone and started texting ppl about me instead of actually responding to me. I told her it was all too much. I have to worry about everything going on with my brother, now I have to worry about nana, and making sure my mom is ok, and also just the holidays coming up in general. Also, all of this is happening in a 2 bedroom apt that’s 100 degrees with about 5 people in it at any given time. So I’m a lil overstimulated. 

I told my mom if nana comes over that I’m Either going to a hotel or I’m just not leaving my room until she goes home. Which I thought was fair considering how she treated me the days prior. My mom did not like that and has given me the silent treatment all day. So once my nana left I just sat in my room for the rest of the day. I came out to do my chores and took pictures  of it for proof but that’s it. I didn’t help her with anything. (My bro was home to help so I just assumed that if I’m apparently doing nothing and my bro is really doing all these things then she has nothing to worry about) 

But now it’s 1am and I’m start to feel guilty. My emotions are telling me that I have a right to be upset and to not let them treat me like this and that I don’t owe anybody anything. And if she wants to give me The Silent treatment then I can do the same to her. But the logical side of me is saying i should have just kept my mouth shut and helped my mom because at the end of the day she is going through a rough recovery. So I shouldn’t just abandon her during a surgery like this. I also know my sister will be upset with me that I stopped helping her. I hate upsetting my sister as she does have my back for most things and is very level headed. Like my sister just does stuff and doesn’t show her emotions and gets over it quickly. I honestly don’t know how she does it but I aspire to be like her but instead I exploded and basically gave my mom the ultimatum of picking between my nana or me. And when she didn’t pick me I just gave up. I feel like that was wrong of me. Am I overreacting? Should I apologize and get over it and start helping her again? I just feel like no matter what I do I’m the “bad guy”. Im terrified that I’m not a good person but I don’t want to constantly give to people that only take.

1gll94j,https://i.redd.it/8hqpf8fmofzd1.jpeg,Staying toasty in ice water,"Honestly I wanted to write this up today before I forget all the preparation it took to set out for cold water diving; maybe someone else wants to give diving in other places than 30 degree water a chance😄

We went for a swim around the Jökulsárlón glacier lagoon for about 2h and prepared a few months prior to this with lake training in Switzerland to prep ourselves for the cold water. It was cold on the face, I won’t lie, but after the 3rd time splashing yourself it was honestly great.

The glacier lagoon is connected to the ocean and during the incoming tide the glacier water mixes with salty ocean water, which significantly decreases the temperature as well - good to remember to always research the location on first cold water dive.
The water temperature is between -3 and 3 degrees Celsius and the wind in Iceland adds to the odds.

For my gear

- suit Elios, 7mm smoothskin with Sharkskin lining (insulating lining, less delicate than smoothskin)
- 5mm gloves with extra thermal lining
- 5mm open cell socks
- finn keepers
- around 5kg weight on my belt to stay sensibly weighted even at the surface
- rental freediving fins


We had a whole setup of boiling 2L of hot organic soapy water to pour into my suit and let that soak for a bit. Then I could slip in easily and not worry about ripping because the lubrication and sharkskin lining gave the suit a lot more durability than i.e. my 3mm open cell smoothskin could take.

Once in the suit the wind is not really noticeable and the hot water kept my really toasty for the entire duration which was about 2h in the water and 1h walking to our entry and back; the hands can get cold but generally flexing and keeping your digits moving was enough to warm back up.

For the gear, I’d say one of the most important things was definitely the finn keepers. We saved on luggage by not bringing our own fins and the 5mm socks with soap and water will begin feeling like jello - so with finn keepers I at least knew my fins were not going to flop off my feet when I kick.

Another thing would be the weight. We didn’t dive in Iceland before, so generally we were cautious about our own limits, despite being quite advanced scuba and freedivers. Safety comes first in situations like this and a huge part of that is being able to reliably control your movement in the water.

We didn’t dive here for deep dives, the water is actually very silty with debris and minerals from the glacier and the ocean mixing it up, so the view was less than 10m.
But we focused more on exploring the lagoon and its ice bergs, for which I still needed the 5kg weights to balance out the bouyancy of the suit, gloves and salt water.

Getting in and out of the water was pretty uneventful, besides the fact that we were completely alone; and we set up coffee and food ready to go back at our car so that we could start the hot pot while getting out of our suits.

Diving in Iceland was great, we also did a few other spots with better visibility but I wanted to share how research & preparation are the most important things for our excursions and I hope you all stay safe out there!

Based in Melbourne, I danced through a life that was both exhilarating and exhausting. My days were filled with a diverse mix of straight-laced professionals, enigmatic underworld figures, and glamorous celebrities. I found myself navigating the opulent mansions of Toorak, mingling with artists, athletes, and transient men from afar—businessmen in suits, carefree musicians, and the occasional hopeful soul who had scrimped and saved for months just for an hour of my time.

Amidst the Crown Villas parties, hosted by James Packer and attended by football stars, politicians, and faces I recognized yet couldn’t name, connection was sought by both them and I. Intimate evenings shared with a single client gave way to nights pulsing with the chaotic energy of cocaine and party drugs, which I abstained from, yet somehow found myself caught in the current. In each of these fleeting encounters, I saw through the windows of their lives—each client a mosaic of dreams, vulnerabilities, and desires.

Many came seeking pleasure, while others longed for a deeper bond. I embraced their narratives, relishing the stories of successes and feeling the sadness of their challenges. A couple of years removed from my sheltered life at Loreto, an elite all-girls private Catholic school, I was often asked, ""What are you doing this for?"" The question hung in the air, a perplexing paradox for many as I stood at the intersection of lives that would never again collide in the ordinary world.

Perhaps it was their pursuit of connection, whether superficial or profound, that resonated within me. But for every client that left me elated, there were those who brought an inexplicable sorrow, a heaviness I couldn’t shake. Some stirred a longing within me—a glimmer of wanting a life that mirrored theirs. But I was acutely aware of my choice; becoming an escort had meant relinquishing the possibility of love. I had entered this world deliberately, my eyes wide open to the ramifications, yet unaware of how deeply it would echo within my psyche.

My client interactions became a reflection of my chaotic upbringing, a family life wrought with turmoil. Why would I want to replicate that disarray? No, I would chase after material success, unfettered by the bonds of love. From 17, my gateway into the adult industry was boxing events to promotional modeling—V8 Supercars, Hustler, to stripping at the Men’s Gallery and Spearmint Rhino, to escort agencies like Paramour— Finally, I had carved my niche in the adult industry, eventually earning my independence as a registered private escort.

The money flowed freely, bookings filling my calendar weeks in advance. This was the life I had envisioned, brimming with freedom, excitement, and richness in experience. Yet, on this particular night, I desired solitude. I yearned for stillness, wishing my phone would cease its relentless buzzing. My body ached with exhaustion.

As I scrolled through the reviews on “Punterplanet,” anxiety clawed at my insides. To me, those intimate moments deserved reverence, not the cold scrutiny of public opinion. My heart sank with each word I read, a reminder that, beneath the surface of my profession, a human wished for connection and privacy. That night, I surrendered to my loneliness, allowing tears to flow freely.

I lived in the Vogue apartment complex on Chapel Street, a hotspot of trendy hipsters in Melbourne. Across my building, a hot yoga studio titled “One Hot Yoga” had opened. Seeking refuge, I made it a point to escape there whenever possible. The heat and postures sculpted my body better than any other exercise, but more than that, the practice provided a sanctuary for my restless mind. In the cocoon of heat, I found peace—a stillness that allowed me to peel back the layers I wore while navigating my dual existence.

Over time, the effects of yoga began to seep into my life; I turned away from intoxicants, both at work and socially. I didn’t feel strong enough to resist; it simply didn’t resonate with me anymore. Clients who initially seemed disappointed ended up respecting my choices, our interactions becoming raw and authentic. My client list grew, but I found deeper connection through sobriety.

In the same yoga studio, not long ago, I had overheard conversations about a “Vipassana meditation retreat.” The participants glowed with an otherworldly radiance, their eyes shimmering with life. Something deep within me stirred—a wave of goosebumps rippling through my body at the sheer mention of the retreat's essence: no speaking, no eye contact, just meditation for 12 hours daily. My father’s past participation in such retreats in India echoed in my mind, as did my mother’s decision to pursue one in the hopes of healing her spiritual wounds, many of which she associated with my chosen profession.

When I met her post-retreat for coffee, she was transformed—a tranquil presence that commanded respect. I listened intently as energy crackled between us, her calm demeanor radiating peace. Whatever she had experienced, I craved it for myself.

That night, weighed down by sadness, I contemplated Vipassana. Perhaps this was the antidote I sought. I logged off Punterplanet, swiftly researching the meditation retreat and submitting my application. A few days later, an acceptance letter confirmed my participation from September 15th to 26th. In that moment, a thought flashed through my mind: \*Whatever happens, I won’t let this change my life.\* The resistance within me felt palpable; I could sense the challenge ahead.

Upon arrival at Dhamma Alokha, Woori Yallock, I filled out the initial form with a surprising mixture of trepidation and excitement. “Occupation?” I wrote, “Escort.” A lady from the management team scanned my answers and met my gaze. “That must be difficult for your family,” she said, her tone edged with compassion.

I brushed her words aside, but as I followed Janine to my dormitory with three other beds, somewhere deep within me, the seed of change had undoubtedly been planted. This was the beginning of my journey—a dance between the life I knew and the unexplored territory that awaited. The paradox of desire—was I ready to confront the truths buried beneath the surface?",1,1730964790.0,healwithgrace,0,1.0,False

I always find reviews helpful, so I thought I'd share. Some of them I haven't burned yet. I'll update the post when I do.

# Rainbow Cereal

Cold: This one reminds me of a bowl of Fruit Loops. It has a hint of lactose, but mostly a fruity blend. It smells how the leftover milk in the bowl tastes.

# Care Bear Dream Clouds

Cold: I question whether or not this one is a repackage of Rainbow Cereal. I honestly couldn't tell a difference.

Burning: This one has a lot of throw! It's almost too strong for me. It becomes more sour when melted.

# Rainbow Sherbert

Cold: This one is heavy on the citrus. I get a strong hint of orange with some sourness (maybe lemon or lime). The berry smell is more tart (maybe a raspberry). I think it will make a good summer scent.

# Strawberry Shortcake: Raspberry Tart

Cold: Smells so good! There's a very tart raspberry scent with just a hint of sweetness. It reminds me of how my strawberry shortcake doll smelled as a kid in the 80s.

# Holiday Rum

Cold: This one smells so good! I get the sweetness of vanilla cake but it's well-balanced with the rum without being boozy. I'm looking forward to warming this one.

# Marshmallow Snowcream

Cold: Sweet vanilla but not overly sweet. Smells just like a marshmallow with a hint of the eggy meringue.

Burning: The scent shifts a bit when warm and smells more like marshmallow taffy to me. I still really enjoy it. The throw was strong but not overpowering.

# Red Velvet Cupcake

Cold: I get a good balance of cocoa/cake with a tinge of tanginess from the cream cheese.

Burning: I was a bit disappointed that more of the cocoa didn't come through with the burn. I love chocolate candles (like Espresso Cake Pop). You get more of the cream cheese frosting scent. Still good but not as well-balanced as I'd like it to be.

# Elf: Son of a Nutcracker

Cold: I get the caramel and vanilla but was hoping for more peanut butter. It reminds me a bit of the Whipped Caramel Espresso candle but not as strong.

# Elf: World's Best Cup of Coffee

Cold: FINALLY a coffee candle that actually smells like coffee. Smells like a dark roasted coffee with a hint of cinnamon. I also get some lactose creaminess.

Burning: The coffee scent overpowers any of the other scents in the profile. I smell the cream sugar but not the cinnamon or cocoa when hot. Smells like I just walked into a first-wave coffee shop.

# Elf: Chrismas Candy

Cold: This smells exactly as it should. Like the cheap ribbon Christmas candy my grandma used to buy. I'm not sure how this will burn. It smells a bit artificial on cold, but it may be perfect on warm.

I originally wrote this for my AP lang class but ended up really liking it and it’s something that I’m pretty proud of and k wanted to share. I’d love to hear your feedback.

Begin Essay:

I would like to believe that I’ve always enjoyed some of the more mundane things in life. That’s probably why I love photography. It gives the ability to eternalize a memory and displays the beauty in places that often go overlooked. Trees that display stories with gnarled bark about harsh weather it persevered, a spider that spins an intricate tapestry of web to catch its unsuspecting prey, or a flower that stands proudly out from the crowd. But nothing compares to a sunset. The way the sky explodes into an extravagant display of reds, pinks, oranges, and yellows. Sometimes, by a pure stroke of luck, some deep purples and blues will make themselves seen as well. Other times, they are somewhat less noteworthy, just the gigantic ball of gas and fire, slowly falling behind the horizon. But being picturesque does not determine whether or not something can be enjoyed however. To lay in the grass in the warmth of the summer, watching the day turn into night is never an opportunity I would dream of passing up.

Why are these things so often overlooked? Why is everyone in such a rush to get through life? What’s the harm in going slow? Is everyone scared of getting left in the dust of the rampaging bull of innovation? Or is everybody just too attached to the pace of life to even consider slowing down? 

I watched my entire summer unfold through the viewfinder of my camera. Vibrant colored balls that rolled toward tiny plastic holes over astroturf that’s now smooth after being trodden on by toddlers and adults alike. Fibrous wooden blocks with hundreds of tiny nicks and dents on the surface from crashing and falling which they threatened to do once more. Sauce laden chicken wings that left hands, faces, and napkins a mess but were bottomless in both quantity and joy. 

Rarely a sunset though.

But many of my older brother. The older brother that was about to leave for university and would only return if time permitted. The older brother that helped me navigate through life. Everything between introducing me to the gym and being the best chauffeur that anyone could ever ask for, he was there. My tour guide through life would soon be reduced to a small photo of the time we beat an escape room in half an hour together, and some grey bubbles filled with words devoid of real emotion. 

As the closing days of August were quickly approaching, I was frantically doing everything I could to put more sand in the top of the hour glass that seemed to only fall faster out of pure spite. If only there was a plug I could use to slow the continuous flow of the fine sand to the side of the glass that represented the past.

Throughout our last month together I did find the plug a couple times. A few times at the YMCA where we worked out together. A time where we played Farkle by candlelight, because a massive, raging storm had cut our power. Once at a Cold Stone where he won a bet in a landslide against my little brother to see who could eat more ice cream. And one time when I found it on my own in the lyrics of American Aquarium and the mechanical hum of the forest green car we shared. 

I was at Target, searching for the object that best says “Thank you for the world” and “Don’t forget about me when you’re gone” and “I love you man.” I walked out of the store empty handed, because nothing can say all of those things and cost less than the fifteen bucks that was stashed in the glove box in case I ever forgot my card, which I did. As I meandered back to the car, I racked my brain, trying to figure out what a college freshman could possibly need or want or use in between linear algebra and Project X.

Approaching the car that stood alone in the lot, I saw the sky reflecting off the deep, shimmering green paint. The beautiful, brilliant sky. A sky that was filled with a smattering of clouds and colors that were only reserved for coffee table books. Pushing off my prior commitments to my friends with an “I’ll be a bit late” text, I sat on the hill that overlooked the Target. I watched in silence as the sun painted the sky and I listened to the cars speeding by, on their way to a thing that’s so important because someone said so and so would be there, and without the breakneck speed, they would miss them. But look at the sunset. I never took a picture of that sky because sometimes my memory serves me better than just a photo. Also, because my phone was locked in the car so I wouldn’t be bothered by the nuisance of the buzzing and ringing. As the sunset faded I got back into the car, driving east toward my destination and watched the sun finally disappear along the horizon in the rear view mirror. With the windows down as “One Day at a Time” played on repeat. I finally found the plug that fit snugly into the neck of the hourglass.

1glkxnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1glkxnm/my_experience_with_laughland_teeth_whitening_does/,My Experience with Laughland Teeth Whitening: Does It Really Work?,"I’ve been on a search for a good teeth whitening product for ages. Between coffee, tea, and just regular life, my teeth had gotten pretty stained over the years. I didn’t think my teeth were *that* bad, but I noticed that I’d gotten into the habit of not smiling as much, or hiding my teeth in photos. I tried various methods to whiten my teeth, like strips and whitening toothpaste, but they either didn’t work well or made my teeth sensitive. So when I came across **Laughland Teeth Whitening**, I was curious.

I want to share my full experience with Laughland because it’s a product that seems to be popping up more and more, and maybe you’re in the same boat I was. If you’re wondering if it’s worth it or if it’s any different from other teeth whitening products, hopefully, my story will help.

# What Made Me Try Laughland Teeth Whitening?

To be honest, I hadn’t heard much about Laughland before. But what caught my attention was that Laughland is **dentist-formulated** and supposed to be more “science-backed” than some of the DIY kits out there. I’ve had mixed experiences with teeth whitening in the past. Some products would make my teeth whiter temporarily, but they’d always go back to looking yellow within a week or two. Worse, most of these products made my teeth super sensitive. So, the fact that **Laughland teeth whitening** was designed to work without causing sensitivity was a big selling point for me.

Another reason I was interested was because the Laughland formula is actually temperature-controlled. They don’t let the ingredients degrade, which means that the whitening agents stay strong until you use them. Most over-the-counter kits don’t do this, so they end up being weaker than what they claim on the package.

# Unboxing the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit

When I ordered the Laughland teeth whitening kit, I got it within a few days, and opening it was honestly pretty fun. Inside, there were clear **instructions** on how to use it, which I appreciated because sometimes these kits can be confusing. The kit includes the **whitening gel**, an LED mouthpiece, and a little adapter so you can plug it into your phone or USB. I liked that the design was simple and didn’t feel overwhelming.

The instructions were clear: brush your teeth, apply the gel, and then use the LED light for about 10 minutes. That’s it. I also liked that they included tips on using it daily for the best results. I was actually excited to start using it because it didn’t seem like a huge hassle.

# First Impressions: Easy to Use

Using the Laughland kit was a lot easier than I expected. In the past, some kits required long sessions or multiple steps, which made it easy to skip out of sheer laziness. With **Laughland teeth whitening**, it’s literally just 10 minutes a day. You apply the gel to your teeth, put in the LED mouthpiece, and let it work. You can do other things while you wait, like scrolling on your phone, watching TV, or reading.

After the first session, my teeth felt a little different—not sensitive or anything, but I could tell something had happened. I didn’t notice any immediate results, which is probably normal, but I was curious to see if anything would change after a few days.

# Results After a Few Days

By the third day, I started to notice a bit of brightness in my teeth. I didn’t expect drastic changes immediately, but it was nice to see a bit of improvement early on. The **Laughland instructions** recommend using it consistently, so I kept up with it daily. By the end of the sixth day, I noticed a bigger difference—my teeth were definitely whiter. It wasn’t a shocking, Hollywood-bright white, but it was a natural kind of brightness, which I actually prefer.

One thing that surprised me was that there was absolutely no sensitivity. I didn’t experience any of the weird, sharp pains I’ve had with other products. My teeth just felt… normal. The lack of sensitivity made it so much easier to keep using the product because I wasn’t dreading the sessions.

# How Laughland Works on Deep Stains

Laughland uses **hydrogen peroxide**, the same active ingredient used by dentists, but it’s combined with ingredients that keep it gentle on the teeth. This formula is what helps break down deep stains without damaging your enamel. I was impressed with how it worked on some of the darker stains I thought were permanent. I’m not saying it’s a miracle, but my teeth looked significantly whiter and cleaner by the end of the first week.

Another cool part of the kit is the **LED mouthpiece**. The light supposedly helps activate the whitening gel, which speeds up the process. I was skeptical about this, but it really seems to make a difference. The LED adds a professional feel to it, and I think it made the whole experience feel a bit more legit compared to just using strips.

# Final Results and Thoughts

After using Laughland for two weeks, my teeth were visibly whiter, and I felt a lot more confident smiling. It’s strange how something as simple as teeth whitening can make you feel better about yourself, but it’s true. I didn’t have super high expectations, but Laughland definitely exceeded them.

The results were consistent, and they didn’t fade quickly, which was one of my main worries. I’ve tried other whitening products that made my teeth look whiter for a day or two, only for the results to wear off. Laughland’s results seem to last longer, which I really appreciate. I’m not constantly thinking, “Oh, I need to re-whiten my teeth again.”

# Pros of Laughland Teeth Whitening:

* **Fast, noticeable results** in just 6 days
* **No sensitivity** issues
* Simple and **easy-to-follow Laughland instructions**
* High-quality formula and **LED technology** for deeper whitening
* Temperature-controlled storage ensures the formula is effective when it reaches you

If you’ve been thinking about teeth whitening, I’d recommend giving **Laughland teeth whitening** a try. It’s way easier and less painful than most other options, and it’s convenient to use at home. It’s also a lot more affordable than in-office treatments, which can cost hundreds of dollars.

# Is Laughland Worth It?

In my opinion, Laughland teeth whitening is absolutely worth trying. I’ve seen a noticeable improvement in my smile, and it’s given me a lot more confidence. If you’re looking for something that’s effective, simple, and doesn’t cause pain, then I think Laughland could be a good fit.

So far, the **Laughland reviews** I’ve read have been pretty accurate about the product. It’s one of the few at-home whitening kits that lives up to its claims. Overall, it’s made a big difference for me, and I’d recommend it to anyone who’s tired of less effective whitening options.

I hope this post helps if you’re considering trying **Laughland teeth whitening**! Feel free to ask any questions, and I’ll share more about my experience.",1,1730963866.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

For a while it used to come and go, I could have periods of perfect sleep and then straight back to messed up sleep. 

But recently, I haven't had more than 6 hours sleep for the past 3 or so months. 

I live with other people and we had different schedules so I would sleep at 10am and they at 2am, this caused me to develop anxiety about when I would be a able to sleep. 

Fortunately, our schedules line up now and the anxiety is mostly gone, but my sleeping is still not fixed. 

Ive tried everything, I always sleep at the same time in a quiet dark room, melatonin, supplements, CBD, and only recently have I started drinking coffee as I'm so tired every day but it's never more than one cup so I'm not over caffeinated. 

The only thing that had moderate success for me was THC gummies, they used to be quite helpful but even now theyve stopped working and I wake up after 6 or less hours and can't get to sleep again. 

Does anyone have a similar experience and how they ""fixed"" it? I'm losing my mind and can't enjoy life living like this.

I had to leave my workplace for a few years. I reached out to my former extremely friendly co-workers as I was re-entering the workforce. 

They acted like I was a pariah and brushed me off. None of them even wanted to have coffee with me. I was outraged at my cousin for basically ruining my career. 

I did have a LinkedIn profile up last year. A few people from my cousin's friend's department viewed my profile. They have nothing to do with my job search. It was disturbing. 

I was a software engineer. Most of my family has not gone beyond high school. I stand out in my family with this and it doesn't help that I'm female. 

I'm pretty sure my cousin was egged on by my bpd/npd brother. My family is a living nightmare for stalking and harassing me.

I want to work but am very wary of being on LinkedIn.  They both troll websites looking for information about family members. I know I can block them but they have flying monkeys.

1glkr0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SemiCreativeNameHere/comments/1glkr0m/diary_of_sorts_51/,diary of sorts [51],"Haiii hii hello hi sillies! Guess who's reading all 922 pages of project 2025 to create a comprehensive post of exactly what rights we're losing and why? :D 

I am genuinely having problems taking this document seriously because... just look at this- ""Contemporary elites have even repurposed the worst ingredients of1970s “radical chic” to build the totalitarian cult known today as “The Great Awokening”"" *^(()*^(Kevin D. Roberts) *^(Project 2025, pg1))* What the fuck??????? I cant. On an off note ""The Great Awokening"" is metal af and I'm definitely gonna use that for something

I meant to read the entire thing, get a cohesive idea of it, and then share it instead of my diary today, buuut apparently 922 pages is longer than I thought and even though I read fast, I think the most I've read was 519 in one night, and that took like 5 hours. Also novels are easier to read than political documents. 

There was a reason for this though, I think its very important to remind everyone that its going to be alright. Most of the hateful stuff from Angry Orange probably just campaign stuff, and on a local level people and communities will stay the same. Dont change any major life things because Fat Cheeto was elected. Your friend groups and parents will not all of a sudden stop being tolerant because of election results. Stick through it, and remember we also have another three months before inauguration, so nothing will change for a little bit at least. 

The election also doesnt tell us there are a lot of anti-trans people. Most folks vote on issues that affect them, and they simply don't think about, or don't judge their vote, off of trans rights. Even allies may vote or not vote for different reason. My mom is not American, but if she was, she would never vote for Harris, because for her, giving the democrats the win would mean that their support of the genocide in Palestine went unchecked. I am sure many trans people while thinking about our own rights didnt consider the active death down there or the rights and lives of many other groups as we voted, not because we dont care, but because for us its a simple question of ""which side would *not* hate us for existing"" 

All that to say, dont be discouraged. Not everyone who voted was thinking about trans rights, they have their own problems, and Trump did get less votes than he did in 2020. The problem was democrats not voting, which again, you cant be too mad at when theres other issues like Palestine. 

Feel free to point out inaccuracies.. I'm not a politician nor a political commentator. I'm just a silly girlie who is very very good at being optimistic, and who does her best to understand where *everyone* is coming from. It just hurts knowing that we'll possibly lose more lives from the fear in the community around Trumps election than the actual election itself. 

I myself am honestly not worried about the election, just worried about how people are taking it. 

I did have my birthday today! I got called birthday boy, man, son, quite a bit, but I'm currently in a ""its a bit silly to think of me as a girl"" mood instead of a hyper dysphoric mood, so its alright. I slept in, had a nice ice coffee, looked at some trailers(they're quite nice and I'm definitely sold on the idea now), had therapy session, taught some classes, and had a little family party. At a point when my mom was taking a picture of us and saying ""smile!"" for half a second it almost felt like I was a kid again, and my family was together, and everything was ok. I didnt realize how much i missed it until I had a small glimps of what it was like before. The security, I guess, and stability. 

I am almost debating whether to leave the top part in, but I think its important, though I cant think what for at the moment... I'm afraid I went a bit too much into rambling, but I hope it helps somewhat I guess. 

Well, I really did mean to sleep earlier, but I got caught up in the project 2025 fiasco. I did eat quite well today, cabbage soup for dinner!(my favorite) and an ice cream cake >:3 

You are all awesome, remember that. You are so much more than what any politics sum you up as, you are a wonderful person, making amazing small differences, even if its just on reddit! Big hugs to all of you <3

I've been lurking around here for a while, picking up tips and admiring everyone’s setups. I thought it was finally time to share my own little coffee (beverage) corner!



Last year, after a trip to Italy, I finally realized I was done with drinking bad coffee. Every morning there felt like a ritual, starting with delicious espresso. Coming back home, and drinking my first coffee at home and in the office, I realized how bad it was.



Since I was just starting out, I went for a budget-friendly setup, and it’s been a great way to learn the craft without going overboard on expenses. Here’s what I’ve got:


Machine: I went with a Dedica, which has been surprisingly good as a beginner machine! I’ve made a few upgrades to get the most out of it. I switched out the steam wand to a better one for more control over frothing, and I installed an IMS shower screen. Plus, I upgraded to a nicer bottomless portafilter for those satisfying extractions.


Grinder: I started off with the C3esp manual grinder. It was great for learning about grind consistency, but I eventually got tired of the hand grinding routine. I recently upgraded to the Hibrew G5 grinder, which I found for a great price (around €110 with discounts on AliExpress). It’s been a game-changer in terms of convenience, and I’m excited to dive deeper into its performance.


I’ll probably post a more detailed review of the Hibrew G5 soon for anyone interested!



I have to admit, this hobby drove me a little crazy in the beginning. I ordered some local beans and some popular online ones, but I kept running into the same issue—there was always too much acidity in the cup. I kept grinding finer and finer (cause that's what seems to be always the answer!), until I eventually clogged the machine trying to dial it in.


Finally, I switched to darker roasts, and it made a world of difference. Right away, I noticed I enjoyed the taste a lot more. Turns out, I’m just not a fan of fruity coffee profiles. Ever since then, my setup has been working pretty well for me. I’ve even experimented with some medium-dark roasts and can now appreciate a bit of fruitiness without confusing it for pure acidity. Still, I definitely prefer my espresso on the darker and more bitter side!


Would love to hear any feedback or recommendations on further upgrades. Thanks for all the inspiration, everyone!

>Inside the car, I set the parking disc on the dashboard. My car, an older blue Volvo with flat sides and an angular nose, was parked close to the gay bar.

>This felt like a mission in hostile territory, so I took a moment to prepare. In the mirror, my blue eyes reflected back at me; 'He's your little brother, and you promised him this.'

>Stepping out, I surveyed the surroundings, it was a warm evening in the middle of the summer.

>Standing a five-nine, I shared this stature with my little brother. While he was thin like a dancer, my physique was more athletic and muscular due to my military training.

>Glancing around, I noticed the neighbourhood and the disco at the end of the parking lot. Men outnumbered women.

>'Le Chat Noir,' or the Cabaret, was a music venue primarily for gays and women seeking refuge from male attention.

>As I approached the door, the doorman scrutinized me and asked, “First visit?”

>I nodded, feeling a bit nervous, and glanced into the hallway. “My brother is performing.”

>It was his fourth or fifth time singing in front of an audience, with a song competition he hoped to win.

Page 2:

>He was a dance and song teacher at a school, so he was use to singing, but normally in front of or with the kids he trained.

>He sang well... My keyboard skills were lacking, but our shared love for old songs—Abba, Roxette, and even some Beatles' tunes—allowed us to play together.

>Entering the cloakroom, I realized I had no outerwear to check-in, so I just paid the entrance fee with my card.

>Our parents divorced when he was one year old, and I moved with our father to Jutland, while he stayed with our mother and her dance school.

>Walking through the partially open door to the hall, I emerged into the gay world.

>The hall resembled a music hall, with a dominant stage on the right where some gays were singing karaoke. In the centre was a small dance floor, while the left side featured tables, chairs, and various booths. At the back wall to my left stood a bar, which I headed towards.

>Many eyes followed me, whether it was due to my broad shoulders and well-trained body or the Hawaiian shirt my wife had insisted I wear.

>Women often have a better eye for fashion than most men... except perhaps the men in this establishment.

>Though the room was not crowded, I still encountered a few instances of unwanted touching on my ass, as I made my way to the bar.

>The bar itself was a long counter with some outdated cash register machines that seemed unused. Glitter and bands of bright colours adorned those machines.

>Behind the bar, the back mirror had a rack adorned with bottles of alcohol.

>I tried to fade into the background and asked for a beer. The bartender, a little chubby and wearing a purple vest, looked at me with a nervous expression and asked, ""First time?""

>I nodded and paid for my bottle of beer. He asked again, a little more insistently, holding the beer away from me, ""Is this your first time here?""

>Once again, I nodded and explained, ""My little brother is going to perform.""

>He smiled and allowed me to have my beer.

>The chair was a standard bar stool that could rotate. With my beer in hand, I leaned against the bar and glanced around the hall.

Page 3:

>Garlands in various colours hung from the ceiling, though it was hard to make out the art deco design due to the shifting lights.

>The older man singing karaoke performed well, belting out an old disco classic, and I found myself humming along.

>Many eyes turned towards me from time to time, as I sat and sipped from my bottle of beer. Some looked nervous, while others seemed more curious.

>A slender young man sat down beside me and ordered a mojito. He smiled at me and asked, ""So are you a sailor who's just come to town?""

>The noise made it difficult to hear, so I leaned in closer. He repeated with a smile, ""A sailor open to new adventures?""

>I shook my head. My wife had briefed me a bit about the hidden world beyond what I knew. My voice carried the authority I wielded with my men on the battlefield as I replied, ""No. I am a soldier.""

>The young man let out a small squeal and placed a hand on mine, saying, ""I love soldiers.""

>I offered a slight smile. My brother sometimes behaved similarly, and my wife had warned me about such encounters, though they still proved a bit scary.

>I attempted to explain, ""My little brother is performing, so I'm here to support him...""

>The young man smiled, with a hint of warning, ""You're not an undercover cop, are you?""

>I easily dismissed that notion, stating, ""No. I am an off-duty soldier, and my little brother is competing in tonight's song contest.""

>The bartender, who I had conversed with earlier, tapped me on the shoulder, asking, ""Can we have a chat?""

>He led me to a door labelled ""Employees.""

>As we entered, I noticed the passageway leading towards a small kitchen with a refrigerator.

>He stopped me before we reached the kitchen and asked, ""You're not a member of the Vice police, are you?""

>I frowned, clarifying, ""No, I am a soldier, and I'm just here to support my little brother. Is there a problem?""

>He smiled: “You're serious, just here to support your little brother.? Not looking for your 'girlfriend', out on an adventure or meeting a Polish friend.?”

>Now it was my turn to smile.

Page 4:

>My brother's path and mine had been very different. When our parents divorced, I moved with my father to rural Jutland, and his family. They were farmers, and my father became a garbage man in Ribe. He loved physical work and hunting. We spent many hours hunting, fishing and sleeping in tents in the big forests of Jutland..

>I tried to explain it: “My brother and I got separated when he was a year old. I moved to Jutland, and he stayed here in Copenhagen.”

>The bartender smiled: ""What's her name.?""

>It was another crazy thing: ""My brother's name is Jens.?""

>He smiled and tried to explain: ""My name is Peter when I'm at home and at my daytime job... but here I'm Patricia.""

>I still hadn't understood it, but it was starting to dawn: ""Like a different persona when you're… here.?""

>We went to the kitchen, he took a cup and poured hot coffee from a coffee machine. He offered me a cup: ""Everyone in there, fears that you are a Vice cop and that there will be a police raid tonight.""

>The looks that I had received began to mean something else in my head: ""But there were some men who flirted with me.?""

>He nodded, “Some are stupid, some are horny, and some just like the danger of you being a cop.”

>I began to understand: “Then two things. How can I appear less like a cop.?”

>The coffee was okay, but could have used a little sugar. He shook his head and grinned: ""Some gays are afraid, and they will always believe the worst about strangers...""

>We got up and went towards the bar: ""What else did you want to know?""

>I laughed a little: ""How can I turn them down without seeming...?""

>He smiled and looked down at me. I still had the beer bottle in my hand: ""You must not sit with the beer in your hand, pointing out from your crotch.""

>I laughed a little. That's how I normally sat, with my beer, but it could well look like a...

>We went back to the bar and I sat on the chair and waited. I had to wait half an hour before my brother showed up.

Page 5:

>He was in skinny jeans, a tight white shirt, and a little make-up. He was my height, and shared my blue eyes, but except for our last name, nothing was evidenced that we were brothers.

>I gave him a tentative hug, and he hugged me back. It was one of the things mother had insisted on when we met.

>We talked a little about dad and our lives, but it felt like two strangers on a train going in different directions. I had a wife and a small daughter, and he was in a stable-ish relationship with another man.

>That had been the last time we had met, when Jens invited my wife and me to dinner with his new boyfriend, about a year ago.

>Jens was sad that Dad would not be here, but then Dad hated gays and hated that his son was gay. I had had a long talk about it with the psychologist at the army camp... You could write long dissertations about why dads hated their gay sons.

>After ten minutes, he walked away, and I found my place on the seat at the bar.

>He walked around and talked, hugged, and even kissed some of the other men in the club.

>I felt like I was the one who was is the wrong place.

>It was as if you had only ever watched lions alone in a cage, and now you saw them in the wild, running and being free in their natural habitat.

Page 6;

>The song contest was about to start, and Jens walked around to the backstage's changing area. By that time, I had settled in between the different groups in the hall.

>My brother came out in a little pink dress that our father would have killed him for, if he had seen him in it…

>His performance was good, and he sang cleanly. I had heard four other versions of Abba's 'Gimme, gimme, gimme' tonight... But my brother was the best, I thought.

>I applauded him like a big brother should.

>He won, and I clapped even more.

>After that, he came down and gave me a hug, which felt a little weird because he was still dressed in the dress. He wanted to go on into town and celebrate his victory, and I had to go home.

>My wife barely woke up when I lay down in bed: ""Was it good?""

>I whispered back: ""Yep. Little brother won.""

I used to have this whole system with Google Docs for my itinerary, a Google Drive folder for tickets and bookings, and Splitwise for expenses. It was a mess.

I tried Tripit and Wanderlog, but they were just meh. Tripit was as exciting as watching paint dry, and Wanderlog's got too much going on. Plus, they both want an arm and a leg for essential stuff like offline access to your trips. Splitwise offered me 3 free expenses to record per day. Like I would spend only a dollar each day on my trip.

So, I thought, why not make my own travel app that's actually worth using? And that's how I created [Roamcalm](https://roamcalm.com).

With Roamcalm, you don't need a million apps for your travel needs. You can plan your itinerary, split expenses with your friends, and store all your booking documents in one place. All of it with a yearly subscription that's cheaper than a fancy coffee. And even if you're not subscribed, you can still join trips and see what's up. 

What's even better is, if you don't feel like planning, just forward your emails to us, and we'll sort out your itinerary and organize your booking PDFs. You'll be ready to go without lifting a finger.

Now what Roamcalm is **NOT**: Roamcalm isn't some fancy AI itinerary planner. There are plenty of those out there already. Roamcalm is more like your travel sidekick, keeping all your info at your fingertips when you need it.

So, if you're tired of the travel app jungle, give Roamcalm a shot. It's the travel companion you didn't know you needed. [https://roamcalm.com](https://roamcalm.com)

1glkct6,https://i.redd.it/5ay6voiscfzd1.jpeg,Lost 15 lbs from two 72 hour fasts in 5 weeks ,"Hello fellow fasters. Wanted to share an accomplishment. I’ve done a couple fast years back and I remember how good I felt but I haven’t been able to successfully complete one for years now. I know I needed to do something drastic to get back in shape and I was finally able to complete not one but two different fast over the course of five weeks.

I’m 45, 5’6 and I started out at 182 lbs.  I lost 10 lbs on the first 72 hour fast a few weeks back.  On the first day of fasting, I did a heavy cardio workout on my peloton bike. The second day I did a light workout and on the 3rd day I broke the fast at 72 hours.  I drank a ton of water, black coffee and some pinches of salt.  I ended up gaining a few pounds back to 175 over the next two weeks with good eating and exercise.

I decided to do another fast this last Monday. My goal was to go 120 hours but I didn’t make it. I did manage to get down to 167 pounds which I’m extremely proud of. Once again, I did a heavy workout on my peloton bike the first day with a light workout the second day and nothing the third and breaking my fast.  

The second fast was much easier than the first one.  It’s definitely mind control. But I feel great and I feel sharp and focused with a lot of extra energy. Additionally, I feel like my testosterone has improved as well.  Water, black coffee, some pinches of salt and I added some unmatched Electra this time which helped with my workouts.  

I must say fasting is kind of addicting when you see the quick results. I definitely just plan on managing my weight now and doing a 72 hr once a month if needed.  Excellent way to kickstart healthy habits!",53,1730961348.0,fasting,5,1.0,False

We have lived together for a year now and its mostly okay, I have definitely had worse roommates, but I definitely have some qualms that I dont know how to bring up when we move into the new apartment. So a little background. We split the rent unevenly, my roommate doesnt work alot and needed a place when they moved in so I did not mind covering the slightly bigger half of the apartment and all the utilities. Anyways, were moving into a slightly cheaper apartment, and my rooomate is having their boyfriend move in so we will be splitting the rent three ways and we have not discussed the utilities. Although I do not mind still covering them as I will be saving a good deal of money the way that we are splitting rent. My only issue is that my roommate and their bf are not the cleanest people. Dont get me wrong I am busy all the time and I leave dishes in the sink and dont sweep up dog fur that my dog sheds everday. But my roommate cooks with their  bf almost everynight now and leaves like the sinks full for a few days. This morning I was trying to get a togo starbucks for my hot coffee (we have like 8 for refrence) but there were no clean ones and I had to wash one real quick. I did not say anything to my roommate but they said they would do the dishes after they saw me struggling tofind a cup. They did not until I texted them again this evening to remind them. I do not like being super confrontational and I do not wish to fight with my roommate. The only time I was ever noticeably frustrated was when they left chocolaye cake out for a week and then my dog ate it while I was at work on the 7th day. Anyways I am sorry for rambling but I am trying to figure out how to go about making some rules. I have looked online and people say make an alternating chore chart but I do not particularly want to have alternating chores. I was like chores based on usage. Like you make a mess with the dishes you wash them (maybe by the end of the same day??) you dirty up the countertops or the stove top you clean it up. You fill up the trash you take it out. We wont be sharing bathrooms in the new apartment so I dont really care, but I just want a clean space all the time and be able to have a fork when I need to eat. I dont even mind being the one to mop and sweep the kitchen/living room. i know my dog sheds so its my responsibility. But any guidance how to make a rule or an agreement or something. It just gets really frustrating. I understand my roommate struggles with money and health issues but I would at least hope that they could like make up for late rent by being cleaner or something. I work alot to afford the place and its really exhausting having to come home and clean too. ",1,1730960190.0,roommates,4,1.0,False
1glk2fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1glk2fc/best_decaf_pods_for_iced_americanos_ol_and_vertuo/,Best decaf pods for iced americanos (OL and Vertuo),"I drink 5-8 big cups of iced americanos (ice cubes, coffee, some water) daily, and I have tried every available decaf pod from both machines that I can buy. I go through maybe 400 pods a month, 80-90% decaf.

Here's my list:  
S: **Altissio decaf** (best decaf pod in the world \[vertuo\]); **Ristretto decaf** (best OL decaf, very slightly under Altissio)

S-: **Melozio decaf** (this is honestly extremely close to S, but gun to head, Altissio wins by a very small margin, #2 vertuo decaf); **Volluto decaf** and **Arpeggio decaf** (both are excellent OL decaf pods and again extremely close to ristretto decaf, and just very slightly under Melozio)

A: **Fortado decaf** (honestly not bad, but the competition is too tough, this is the worst tasting Nespresso decaf pod in my opinion, and it's still better than any off-brand ones!)

*Non Nespresso:*

B+: **Illy decaf** (OL, the best tasting non Nespresso decaf. On a good day, this will be on-par or beats Fortado)

B: **Dallmayr Capsa decaf** (OL, the taste is not bad, but still not as good as any Nespresso pod); **M&S Decaf** (OL, this is also not too bad, something to have in your line up in case you are bored with Nespresso pods)

C: **Starbucks decaf espresso** (OL, this is the worst tasting decaf pod that I have on my lineup, and I still buy it just for variation, that's how good all the Nespresso decaf pods are).

  
Bottom line: Nespresso please make more decaf pods!

Curious to hear what other decaf afficionados think. To be honest, I think you can never go wrong with any Nespresso decaf pod, they're some of the best tasting decaf ever, even better than the cup of decaf you get at a coffee shop.",2,1730960177.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False
