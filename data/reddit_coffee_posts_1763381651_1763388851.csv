Based on a **true** story that happens to me and my **friend** the other day, so that's that.

---

Once upon a **Whatchamacallit** or **Whatsoever**...

In the peaceful place of **Tokisadame** Central Park...

Where winds blow breezly, birds were chirping, and many peaceful citizens just walking by on the hard grounds and to respect to not **WALK** on the grass.

Meanwhile, nearby a random bench, sits down a two **Identical** little dorks (who are not ""actually"" related btw.),

Yuuko (Aioi)
and
**Yuuki (Aiko)**...

Both were just staring around the park in silence, not a single sound was made from their mouths...

They kept on continuing, suddenly...

""WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTT????"" Said Yuuko

""WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTT????"" Yuuki copies back.

""WHAT..."" ""WHAAAAAAT!?!?!"" ""what..."" ""WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTT!?!?!""

Yuuko and Yuuki can't stop turning their eyes onto random spots in the Park while shouting **""What!?""** All over again.

This goes on for several minutes, before both of them then stop...

Yuuko then got up from the bench, Yuuki later got up... As they both **held** hands together, they both have left (in silence, that's weird...).

While walking normally, them two almost passed by a **Vending** Machine.

""Oooooh, Coffee..."" Said Yuuko, in curiosity

""Coffee?"" Said Yuuki

""Coffee!"" Yuuko says

""Coffee?"" Yuuki responds

""Coffee!"" Yuuko replies

""Coffee?"" Yuuki returned the words

""Coffee!"" Yuuko says it back

""Coffee.......?"" Said Yuuki

...
...
...

""COFFEE!!!"" Yuuko and Yuuki said it in **sync.**

Yuuko and Yuuki preparing their wallets from their pockets...

""Oh man, i could really use for a **mocha** right now, the weather's here sure is getting cold, huh Yukko?..."" Said Yuuki

""Yep! It sure does... So, who's gonna get it first?"" Yuuko responds

""uuuuuuuh....."" Yuuki replied curiously

The two now had no idea who wanted to get the **coffee** first... Since vending machine are fast and easy to use, there's no way Yuuko and Yuuki would get one at the same time.

Well, Yuuko has her wallet with her this time, so as Yuuki...

To settle this and who gets to have the coffee first... They played: **ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS**

""JAN, KEN PON!"" Yuuko and Yuuki shouted as they instantly shows a hand with the object said in the game's title...

And, **they're both the same...**

Yuuko and Yuuki both picked **Paper**, and it's a tie...

So they try again.

""JAN, KEN, PON!"" Yuuko and Yuuki shouted

Yet again, they **both** picked Rock... And again it's a tie...

They repeatedly play rock paper scissors over and over again, and they always got **tied**...

Until...

""JAN, KEN, PON-"" Yuuki and Yuu-

""KISSU!"" Yuuko added a word

And draws a hand with it's mouth shaped into **duck lips** against Yuuki's scissor hand...

And with that, Yuuko got closer to Yuuki's face and slowly **kisses** him on the face-cheek, causing Yuuki to **blushed** slightly.

""Hey, there's no 4th option in this game !~"" Yuuki shouts playfully, but wasn't mad either

""And kisses does count to me, cause that's how my **Rock, Paper Scissors** goes! (wink)"" Yuuko Yuuko playfully claims

""Heh, can't argue with that~"" Said Yuuki

Yuuko then goes to the vending machine, and looking at the variety of **coffee** selection... Staring at one of the icons...

""Hmmm, i think I'm gonna get myself a mocha this time!"" Yuuko stated

""Hey, mocha's my favorite type of coffee too!"" Said Yuuki

""Yeah, and it's creamy too cause of the chocolate! You want me to get one for you too?"" Says Yuuko

""Uh, I'll get mine myself, you go first. i got my wallet with me... So it's fair."" Yuuki claims

Yuuko went to the coffee vending machine and also pressed to order **Mocha**... While in the process...

The cup didn't appear in the hole, so Yuuko ducked down to see in the hole, where the cup suppose to appear, but all of a sudden...

A cup literally got hit right onto Yuuko's forehead at a fast-paced... Causing a red mark to appear.

Yuuko groans when the cup hits her, Yuuki heard the sounds of her in pain, so he went to Yuuko to comfort her.

""Oh my goodness, Yukko... are you okay? What happened?"" Yuuki says calmly

""Ow, my forehead hurts... The cup just launches at me for no reason, why did it do that?"" Yuuko explains

""Shh, there there Yukko... Don't worry, I'm sure it's just a glitch, i know that machine didn't really meant to hurt you like that, but don't worry... I'll go get the coffee for you"" Yuuki exclaims

""r-really?"" Yuuko whines

""Yes, well... The machine's malfunctioning, I'm sure it didn't mean to do that to you..."" Yuuki says

Yuuki leave a kiss on Yuuko's forehead to make her feel better, before approaching the vending machine...

He grabs the money from his wallet, and inserted it into the machine.

The machine's process, no sounds...

Yuuki then goes to check the hole at the bottom, seeing no signs of a cup approaches, Untill...

The Cup Dispenser launches the cup straight to Yuuki's forehead, knocking him down to the ground, **also**...

It seems like the Coffee Vending Machine is **malfunctioning**, moments ago it works just fine... Now it glitches right in front of them, and there's no signs of it refixing itself back...

Yuuko goes to Yuuki to comfort him in return, hugging him as both looked at the vending machine...

""Maybe, I should just get coffee somewhere else instead, i don't mind..."" Yuuki says

""Okay, sure..."" Yuuko responds softly

Yuuko got up first, before looking down at him and offers him a hand, Yuuko lifts him up from the ground... Yuuki opens his scarf and shares it with Yuuko (Due to how big and **long** it is...)

And they both moved on and walked to a different direction...

""Um, Yukko...""

""Yeah...?"" Yuuko responds

""You know... Can we just get ourselves one at the coffee shop instead? I heard there's one in town. We should go check it out!"" Yuuki stated

""Oh no no no no, Yukki... Trust me. I'm already way ahead of you, I don't even know what's a **Doppio**?!"" Yuuko says

""Oh... me neither..."" Yuuki responds

At the end of the day, Yuuko and Yuuki decides to just make **one** at home... Cause who knows who in this **world** can even make **good** coffee anymore.

El fin...

I dont even know where to begin.

I dont understand how it even came about for someone to think that a waiter deserves more money from you if you order an expensive dish rather than a cheap dish. I could maybe see you tipping the \*cook\* more for making a complicated dish. But if i order white toast and coffee for $5, or if I order the filet for $50, what has the waiter done differently that society has decided he deserves like 7x more money for the second one? (just using rough numbers)

The white toast with butter isnt any harder to remember than a medium rare filet, it any harder to carry over the one plate and drink for both orders, the waiter does the exact same amount of work both times. And yet I would be considered very generous if I tipped $10 for one, and barely doing more than the bare minimum if I tipped $10 for the other. 

  
If we are going to exist in a completely asinine system where restaurants are just allowed to pay their servers less than any other worker is legally allowed to be paid, which I dont know why they allow, the only thing that makes sense is that we decide a flat rate. like the amount of work required to serve a person dinner is like $8 or something, and thats what everyone spends. because I can see how serving a larger table would warrant a larger tip, but again a large table of steaks doesnt warrant a higher tip than a large table of salads. 

So its dumb to shame a person for not tipping the right percentage, because firstly the (i think) generally accepted amount of a 15% tip is a completely arbitrary number, and secondly the arbitrary number is one in a system that makes no sense in the first place. if a waiter is paid ten bucks for carrying one plate to a table I feel like thats pretty damn generous regardless of whats on the plate. 

  
And Im going to close by saying that Im not trying to get out of tipping, I make sure to tip well all the time. I just hate things that dont make any sense. And here we have people shaming other people for not going along with something that makes no sense, for a reason they themselves cant even defend.",16,1763388267.0,changemyview,14,0.67,False

1ozh2oa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopcraving/comments/1ozh2oa/declassified_field_report/,Declassified Field Report,"**AGENCY:** Bureau of Internal Affairs & Phenomena
**CASE FILE:** #778-B (""The Echo"")
**AGENT:** [REDACTED]
**STATUS:** ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE

**LOG ENTRY: DAY 34**

The entity has resurfaced. Onset occurred at 15:42, triggered by a minor stress event (a spilled coffee). As per standard protocol, I did not engage. I am observing.

The initial manifestation is, as always, impressive. It presents as a hostile, psychic entity of immense power. Initial bio-signatures show a spike in the host's (my) cortisol levels, a narrowing of cognitive focus, and the activation of a familiar auditory illusion—a low-frequency, internal monologue that attempts to justify the entity's continued existence.

Its primary attack vector is a form of temporal distortion. It creates a powerful illusion that the present moment is unbearable and that the only relief can be found in a past action. The entity appears to feed on resistance; the more I actively oppose it, the louder its psychic ""roar"" becomes. It is a formidable, awe-inspiring, and frankly, terrifying display of power.

For 33 days, this has been the operating theory.

**LOG ENTRY: DAY 35 (ADDENDUM)**

Last night, I deployed a new piece of diagnostic equipment: the Empathic Resonance Scanner. The goal was to get a reading on the entity's emotional state during a manifestation event. I was expecting to register pure malice, hunger, or a kind of cold, alien aggression.

The results of the scan are... problematic.

The entity manifested at 21:09. The usual psychic roar, the cortisol spike, the whole dramatic performance. I initiated the scan.

The initial reading was so unexpected, I ran the diagnostic three times to be sure.

The entity is not projecting malice. It is not projecting power.

The overwhelming, single, and incredibly powerful emotion it is projecting is...

Sheer, unadulterated, pants-wetting terror.

This has forced a complete re-evaluation of the data. The ""psychic roar"" is not a roar. When filtered through the resonance scanner, it translates more accurately as a high-pitched, terrified squeak. The ""imposing, powerful presence"" is, in fact, the bio-signature of a creature that is cornered, starving, and knows it is about to be evicted from the only home it has ever known.

It's not a monster.

It's a tiny, terrified mouse, standing in the middle of a clean kitchen floor after the lights have been turned on, screaming its little mouse-heart out, hoping that if it makes itself look big enough, you won't notice that it is very, very small, and very, very scared.

The threat has been re-classified.

I am no longer observing a hostile entity.

I am observing a dramatic hamster.

And I can't stop laughing.

If it does increase with batch size, is there a formula to estimate how much water will be retained based on the weight of the coffee grounds?

The build quality feels premium the retractable cable mechanism is smooth and clicks back neatly without feeling flimsy. The cable itself feels sturdy too, though I’ll need more time to see how it holds up long-term.  
  
Performance-wise, it’s impressive. I’ve charged my phone, and earbuds at once, and it handled them without slowing down. It does get slightly warm during heavy use, but nothing concerning though. Charging speeds are fast and consistent across all three USB-C ports.  
  
The best part for me is how travel-friendly it is. I took it on a short trip recently, and not having to carry extra cables was a relief. The retractable cable also helps keep things tidy, and having three ports in one block meant I could charge everything from a single outlet.  
  
Though a few things could have been better like built-in cable could’ve been a bit longer. In hotel rooms or coffee shops where outlets aren’t close by, that extra length would make a big difference. Also, depending on the outlet layout, the block might cover the adjacent socket.

Hook – The moment I realized “no‑code” wasn’t a buzzword but a breakthrough (≈150 words) And there I was, stuck in a three‑hour Zoom with a retail client who’d just spent $250 k on a custom‑built recommendation engine that still couldn’t tell a sneaker from a sandal. I could hear the clock ticking in the background, the client’s patience evaporating like steam. “We need results yesterday,” she said, and I felt the familiar knot in my stomach that every consultant knows when a project spirals. Now here’s the thing: I’d just finished a weekend hackathon using a no‑code AI platform that turned a spreadsheet of sales data into a live forecasting dashboard in 45 minutes. I thought, *What if I could give that speed and price tag to my client?* I pitched the idea on the spot. “What if we rebuild your engine without writing a single line of code?” I asked. She laughed, then asked, “Is that even possible?” The answer was a resounding **yes**—and the ROI that followed blew the old model out of the water. That day I learned that no‑code isn’t a shortcut; it’s a new highway, and every consultant who stays on the old road is leaving money on the table. --- ### 2. The Problem – Why consultants keep hitting a wall (≈100 words) Sound familiar? You’ve got a client demanding AI, a budget that looks more like a coffee‑run allowance, and a timeline that would make a sprint look lazy. Traditional AI projects drag on for months, cost six‑figures, and still deliver a prototype that no one can actually use. The pain is real: you’re stuck between delivering value **and** protecting your reputation. In my experience, 68 % of consulting engagements that promise AI end up with a “nice‑to‑have” report instead of a revenue‑generating product. The result? Frustrated clients, empty invoices, and a reputation that’s harder to rebuild than a broken API. --- ### 3. Solution – 5 Actionable No‑Code AI Playbooks (≈1,200 words) Below are the playbooks I use with every client who wants high‑ROI AI without the usual headaches. Each step is packed with concrete examples, tools you can try today, and the exact mindset shift you need. #### Playbook 1 – Pinpoint the “Low‑Hanging Fruit” Use Cases **Ever wonder why 73 % of companies invest in AI but only 22 % see measurable profit?** Because they chase moonshots instead of quick wins. Start by mapping every client process to three questions: 1. *Is the task repetitive?* 2. *Does it generate measurable data?* 3. *Can a decision be automated or augmented?* If you answer “yes” to all three, you’ve found a low‑hanging fruit. *Example:* A mid‑size logistics firm was drowning in carrier‑selection emails. By feeding those email logs into a no‑code classification model (I used **Bubble + AI Builder**), we built a bot that suggested the optimal carrier 80 % of the time. The client saved **$45

Rows of duplicated entries, columns of “‑‑‑” where data should have been, and a clock ticking louder than my coffee machine. I’d spent **four hours** just to reconcile yesterday’s sales numbers—time I could’ve spent actually *selling* something. In my experience, that moment is the tipping point for many leaders: you either keep feeding the beast of manual work, or you pull the plug and let AI do the heavy lifting. **Let me be honest**—most companies choose the former, because the idea of “AI” still feels like a sci‑fi buzzword rather than a practical ally. But wait, the landscape is shifting faster than a startup’s runway. By the end of 2025, the firms that **embrace AI automation** won’t just shave minutes off tasks; they’ll rewrite the very definition of “efficient.” I’m about to spill the beans on the five trends that are turning that vision into reality. --- ### 2️⃣ The Problem – Your Pain, Plain and Simple (≈ 100 words) Ever wonder why your team’s inbox is a black hole while your KPI dashboard shows flat‑lined growth? **73% of companies** still rely on manual data entry, and that translates into wasted hours, human error, and a morale dip that no pep‑talk can fix.

The bot scans incoming orders, cross‑checks inventory levels, and flags any anomalies for a human manager. The result? **38% faster order processing** and a **22% reduction in approval errors**. **Quick‑start tip:** Identify a repetitive, rule‑based task (e.g., invoice matching). Deploy a low‑code RPA platform that now offers “AI‑enhanced OCR.” Run a pilot for two weeks, measure time saved, and iterate. **Why it matters:** You’re no longer hiring a digital intern that can’t think. You’re giving your bots a brain, and that brain learns from every transaction—turning a static script into a living, improving asset. --- #### 🔹 Trend #2 –

1ozgvll,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ozgvll,Ideas for my very vibrant living room,"Hello everyone,

here you can see my rather bold and colorful room. I know it’s too much for many people, but I feel very comfortable here. Still, I’m still in the process of furnishing it and many things are still open. So I have a few questions and hope you can give me some new ideas. Basically, the desk should stay where it is, and I also want to hang lots of hanging plants with macramé from the ceiling.

1. How would you arrange the seating furniture? I definitely want to keep the sofa and the chaise longue, and I also have a second Acapulco chair in green. I don’t plan on installing a TV, but I do want to add a coffee table. The couch should preferably stay on this wall, I just don’t know how to arrange the furniture around it. Do you have any ideas?
2. What type of ceiling lamp would you recommend? When I am in the room, 95% of the time I use mood lighting because I find bright ceiling lights unpleasant. The smoke from the (still-to-be-installed) cigarette-on-the-ceiling installation is illuminated, and there is also a small light next to the door. I will add more smaller light sources as well. Nevertheless, I would like a ceiling lamp instead of the bare cables. I just don’t know which shape or style would fit.
3. Do you have any thoughts about the pink curtains? They don’t really feel right to me.
4. What ideas do you have regarding wall decoration? It can definitely be a bit unusual—I’m open to unconventional things. I can't stand the emptyness any longer and am definately not a minimalist.

Every other thought is also welcome. :)",1,1763387661.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Let me brief about myself. I'm a international student and when I came to NY for studies and from that point of time, I found myself searching 'is this place safe to go'. I tried asking from many seniors and people and all answers were based on 'vibes', some said go and explore freely ,some said don't go at night. I was literally so frustrated. 

Most of the time , I wanted to go and explore new places but found myself locked in hostel room just because I don't if there is sufficient lightning conditions, how is the walkability, can I roam around there after 7 etc. I realised no one really tracks this data and if people can rate places based on the safety and not on how good coffee was, it can be so much helpful! 

Therefore me and my friend started building this product called Safe or Not, literally so simple product just type in the location and boom all the data at one place. Best part you can also rate the place based on your experiences and help other people.

1ozgt5o,https://i.redd.it/8kkwvriqvq1g1.png,(Reposted and Ooc) Give me your MMV2 headcanons,"
Here's some I have (Horror Mario specifically):

He has social anxiety (it's fair to assume he does)

He doesn't fully own the horrorbrews specifically, they belong to one of his original takes. (Guess who) (For exacts, almost the entirety of Woodland of Lies and Hellish Heights, and the entirety of Classified Castle don't fully belong to him, but the entirety of Irregularity Isle, Beta Luigi, Content Cosmos, and the Unbeatable gang does fully belong to him)

Worked on the entire mod by himself, and as a consequence, his sleep schedule is all kinds of fucked up.

He and Horror Peach are happily married. In fact, they were married long before the cartridge (they got trapped together) \[Starman Slaughter was a bump in the road, they made up afterwards. He also made up with Yoshi.exe\]

Had a daughter named Christine about five years before the cartridge with Horror Peach, sadly she didn't come along with them. He hopes that she's doing alright. Unbeknownst to him, she actually got adopted by the Dearests and now works for them as a maid, but she often wonders where her bio-parents went. (Credit to u/AncientDisaster2230 for the concept)

He can't age due to being trapped in the cartridge, and is permanently stuck at 25. (Same for Peach)

Was pretty powerful pre cartridge, and omnipotent post cartridge, but had to hold back in the mod. He still hates himself for not being able to fight back against DD.

Speaking of pre cartridge, he originally looked like Mario in a business suit, the only noteworthy things being his teeth were slightly sharper than the original Mario.

The reason why he has that cleaver is because when DD's true intentions were revealed, he was so blindsided that he didn't even think to use his powers, and used his hands plus a cleaver he grabbed from the kitchen. Unfortunately, he was ultimately overwhelmed, with many claw marks all over his torso and his knife having been chipped. The cleaver is more of a reminder of what he lost than anything.

Also, the reason why Pico went to Mr. L's world was because the original Super Horror Mario appeared behind him and threw off his aim. (That dude has an ability to turn invisible, but the problem arises when he is completely undetectable in that state.)

He can also purr like a cat, but it only really happens when he's extremely happy. It's actually natural for him, but he's always embarrassed about it around others when it happens. The only exception is Peach, who loves him for it and will happily pet him when it does.

LOVES spaghetti. He'll get instantly summoned by the scent.

He also drinks Coke a lot. He also drinks coffee too, but only in the mornings, otherwise he can't fall asleep.

Threw out BF and GF's corpses because he didn't want to be reminded of what he did. Plus, they were starting to stink up the place.

He also let Pico out because he had no involvement in his situation.

He has severe depression, but Peach is helping him through it as best she can.

He likes listening to the Shadow the Hedgehog OST, his favourite songs are ""I Am All Of Me"" and ""Never Turn Back"" (they kind of fit him)

The power nullification thing isn't actually caused by him, the world itself causes that. He can turn it on and off, he justs keeps forgetting to turn it off.

(In fact, the ""Oh, don't bother using your powers, they're useless here. This is...MY world."" line was actually improvised on the spot.)

Speaking of power nullification, there is a limit to it, which has been broken by the original take that owns all the horrorbrews.

He's immune to porn due to seeing the Friday Night Funkin fandom.

Arranges more violent murder methods if anyone dares to leak his mod.

Is concerningly good with guns.

He's also bisexual

(Okay I'm done rambling)

(Also, this is more personal than anything)

1ozgszu,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr43dpqvl3go,"Couple Chloe and Josh Bashford were stabbed and strangled to death by trusted family friend and former husband of Chloe's mother Derek Martin in 2023. After killing the couple, Martin picked their four children up from school and took them to Costa Coffee and McDonald's.","British man Derek Martin, who killed a young couple Chloe and Josh Bashford at their home in Newhaven in Suffolk before picking their children up from school and taking them to McDonalds, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for their murders. 

On 9 June 2023 Martin walked into Brighton Police Station and confessed to officers: “I’ve killed two people.” He admitted killing Chloe and Josh, but denied murder due to diminished responsibility resulting from a depressive disorder. The court was told Martin did not have a history of violence but had experienced depression and anxiety.

Martin was convicted of murder on Friday 24 October 2025 following a three-week trial at Lewes Crown Court, sitting at Brighton. His life sentences for each count come with a minimum term of 29 years, reduced to 26 years, seven months and seven days for time served, before Martin can apply for parole.

The trial Judge said the attacks on Chloe and Josh were “driven by rage and resentment”, and addressing Martin directly, she added: 

>“It is clear that Chloe and Josh were loving, and loved. As a result of your actions, their families will suffer for the rest of their lives.”

**What happened to Chloe and Josh**

Chloe Bashford was 30 years old at the time of her death and husband Josh Bashford was aged 33. The couple lived in Whitehaven, UK and had four children, two boys aged 15 and 4, and two girls aged 12 and 7, at the time their parents were murdered. 

Derek Martin had been married to Chloe Bashford's mother Elaine long before Chloe was born. However, in the years before the murder Martin and his ex-wife, who shared four children, had become friendly again following his release from prison where he had served time for burglary. As a result, Martin and Chloe had also become close in recent years. The jury heard that Martin was considered a family friend, would help the Bashford with decorating and jobs round their home, and would take the couple's four children to school.

CCTV shown at the trial show on the day of the killings Martin going about his normal routine on the morning of the killings, including helping Chloe with the school run, buying a drink at Costa in Newhaven, buying Chloe breakfast at The Stonehouse restaurant in Peacehaven, and waiting in the car while Chloe shopped at a supermarket. 

Around 10.30 the pair returned to the Bashford family home and Martin did some jobs around the house. Martin claimed that around 12.15pm and while he had been cleaning the windows they had a row about money and he became enraged. He proceeded to hit Chloe on the head with a hammer multiple times. Whilst Chloe was incapacitated by the blows to her head he took a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her eight times. Chloe suffered five stab wounds to her upper back and to her abdomen. Two of the wounds penetrated to a depth of around 20 cm. She died from unsurvivable blood loss.

Josh arrived home from work a few minutes after the attack on his wife as he, Chloe and Martin had planned to look at a new car. Martin chased Josh upstairs whilst slashing his back with a knife. In the master bedroom he stabbed Josh to the front of his body four times, one of the wounds penetrating 12 cm. Whilst Josh lay dying from the stab wounds Martin strangled him with a belt or rope. Josh’s cause of death was stab wounds and compression of the neck. 

Martin then cleaned the knife and some of the bloodstains. He removed the door handles from the rooms where Josh and Chloe's bodies lay, later explaining he did so as he wanted to ensure the children could not see what had happened to their parents. He also hid the couple's car on a different road ""to make it look like no-one was there"" and hid Chloe's iPhone in a bush near a supermarket. 

**Martin takes the children to McDonalds**

Martin then picked up Chloe and Josh's younger children from school and told the older two children to meet him at Costa Coffee. The Bashford's oldest child, son Brooklyn, was 15 at the time and had just sat one of his GCSE exams when he received the message. He says getting such a message from Martin was common, happening to the children around once a week, so raised no concern. 

Martin bought the children drinks at Costa. Brooklyn recalls;

>""I remember he said to me that my parents had had a big argument.""

>""Then he just sat down and we talked about football and all sorts really, just completely normal stuff.""

After leaving Costa Coffee, Martin drove the children towards Newhaven. Brooklyn remembers they thought he was taking them home but instead they stopped at a supermarket, where Martin got out of the car.

>Brooklyn said: ""I just saw him get out, run towards the corner, and a couple of seconds later come back, get back in the car.

>""It was weird to me, but I didn't really think too much of it.""
Waiting in the back seat of the car, Brooklyn's 12-year-old sister was concerned that her mum hadn't replied to text messages she had sent her earlier that afternoon.

>She sent a message to Chloe's phone asking: ""Are you mad with me?""

>She was unaware that at that very moment, Martin was discarding Chloe's phone in bushes at the corner of the supermarket car park, where it was later found by police.

Martin then took them for a meal at MacDonalds, before taking them to their grandmother’s.

>""I remember one of my sisters asking where mum and dad was and what was going on,"" he said.

>""And he was a bit snappy. This is the point where I started thinking he was a bit stressed.""

>In Brighton, Martin stopped the car near the home of Chloe's mum, his ex-wife Elaine.

>He asked Brooklyn to take the younger children inside while he found a parking space, but he did not return.

>Inside, Elaine and her husband Graham were packing to go away for the weekend and were not expecting the children.
>""They were really surprised to see us, which was a bit weird we thought,"" Brooklyn said.

>Growing increasingly concerned, his 12-year-old sister texted and called Martin repeatedly. Elaine tried to call him too.

>At 18:11, Martin texted Elaine to say: ""I'm so sorry, I can't believe what I've done.
>""Please look after the children really well. I'm just about to walk into the police station…don't take the children home x.""
>As panic grew, the Bashfords' 12-year-old daughter messaged Chloe's phone again, telling her: ""Mum please answer. We're all worried sick!""

>Again, she received no reply.
>Instead, some time later, police arrived at the house. They took the adults into the garden and told them that Chloe and Josh had been found dead in their home.

>""I remember hearing my nan's reaction,"" said Brooklyn. ""She just screamed.""
>""I started crying. It was the worst feeling I've ever felt. I just felt my heart drop.""

>After dropping the children off at Elaine's, Martin had gone to a nearby shop and then sat on the beach drinking beers and smoking cigarettes.

>At 19:00, he walked into Brighton Police Station and handed himself in.
>In interviews after his arrest, Martin became emotional as he told officers: ""I wanted to take them to McDonald's to have dinner.
>""Then I wanted to take them home and look after them but I couldn't.""

>Telling police about receiving multiple calls and texts from Brooklyn's 12-year-old sister while at the beach he said: ""She wanted to know where I was.
>""She obviously wanted to go home. They didn't know what happened.""

**Family response**

Elaine Sturges, Chloe's Mum and Martin's ex-wife, said Martin had been ""like Jekyll and Hyde"" and had severe mood swings related to gambling but she believed he had changed in recent years and that was why she had involved him in family life.

>""He had a temper, but I never thought he'd be capable of doing anything like this,"" she said.

>""I would never have let him near Chloe and Josh if I thought it was like this.""

Brooklyn, now aged 18, said outside court that he was ""happy"" with the verdict because ""it's what he deserves"" and described Josh and Chloe as ""amazing people"" and ""perfect parents"" who were ""always there for us"".

>Now 18, Brooklyn has left school and is training to be an electrician.
>He and his siblings are being cared for by their grandmother Elaine.
>He said after many difficult months, they are ""learning to live with"" the shocking loss of their parents.
>""It's hard to think about them without thinking about what happened to them,"" he said.
>""But 99% of the time it's just good memories about trips that we've done, good things we've done.
>""But it's always in the back of your mind. You'll never get rid of it.""

1ozgrgz,https://i.redd.it/hg3o7ryokt1g1.gif,My chart is basically made up of three signs. Any first impressions? [astro-seek],"I've been studying astrology for almost a decade now, not too theoretic as I come and go away from it. I read more when I am meeting my friends from my home country. Anyways, I have always loved my chart, especially since I don't usually come across charts with this little sign variation. Literally, if you close one eye this chart might as well only be Gemini, Aquarius and Sag. I feel like everything here represents me to an extent that is too much: I talk a lot, I read a lot, I LOVE academic research just for the sake of knowing. My 11th stellium made me befriend the most complex group of people and I always get sentimental when they tell me ""I never would have thought you'd understand me so well"". I am also always described as weird and eccentric, but it always comes off as something people respect and like about me.

Now, I am mostly sure that if I were to show this to the ""your sign your coffee order"" crowd (don't hate, I also love those; reminds me of the 2014 tumblr astro era) it would generate a round of horror screams, given the Gemini hate train:)))). But I've always been curious about what astrological readers would make of my chart.

Last year, I hit a point where I’d walk into the office and feel my chest tighten.

I was running marketing for products that targeted older people with offers I didn’t believe in. Nothing illegal — just the kind of stuff that slowly eats away at your conscience.  
  
Every morning I’d force myself through the door telling myself it was ""just work.""  
Every night I went home feeling like I was slowly turning into someone I didn’t like.

It was the worst during cold winters that we have here:  
Wake up in the dark → sit in the office all day → go home in the dark.  
Repeat.  
For 6 years straight.

On paper everything looked fine. Decent techie salary, nice team, predictable routine.  
But inside I felt like I was disappearing.

One night, after another 8-hour day pushing ads I didn’t respect, I opened my laptop and told myself: if I’m going to pour this much energy into something, it better be something I actually believe in.

So I created it — Skaler — a tool to help performance marketers create high-converting ads in this AI slop era:  
• Real creative insights  
• Real competitive data  
• Real tools to build better ads

It took way longer than I thought. I knew nothing about building web apps. And my SEO content is still client-side rendered (in human language  - this hurts search results).

But I'm working on it.

And building it felt like I was slowly getting my integrity back.

The craziest thing is people use it. It even paid for the coffee in the pic (still need to really optimize the toolstack). And for the first time in a long while I finally feel like I'm working on something that aligns with my values.

Here it is if you’re curious: [https://skaler.app](https://skaler.app)

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I’m trying to build a stable routine.,"Honestly, building better energy in the morning didn’t happen overnight for me. But a few simple habits made a HUGE difference — and they’re super easy to follow.

**1. Getting sunlight within the first 10 minutes after waking up**  
This is the biggest game-changer. Stepping outside for even 2–5 minutes resets the body’s internal clock, reduces grogginess, and boosts cortisol *naturally* (the good kind that gives you alertness). It’s better than coffee.

**2. Drinking water before anything else**  
Most people feel tired because they wake up dehydrated. I keep a bottle next to my bed. One big drink and my brain genuinely switches on faster.

**3. Light stretching or mobility for 3–5 minutes**  
Not a workout—just simple movements: neck circles, shoulder rolls, hip openers, a few deep breaths. It sends fresh blood flow to the brain and gets rid of morning stiffness.

**4. Keeping the phone away for the first 20–30 minutes**  
Opening social media or messages immediately drains mental energy. When I delayed screen time, my mind stayed calmer and more focused the whole day.

**5. A protein-rich breakfast (or a small fruit if I’m not hungry)**  
Protein keeps energy stable, while sugary foods cause a crash. On days I eat protein first, my energy stays steady for hours.

**6. Planning the day on paper**  
Just writing 3 priority tasks removes mental clutter. I stopped feeling overwhelmed, and it honestly raised my energy because I wasn’t thinking about 20 different things at once.

**7. Sleeping with a fixed wake-up time**  
Energy improves when the body expects the same timing every day. Even on weekends, I try to wake at the same time (±1 hour). My mornings became way smoother.",4,1763386731.0,getdisciplined,1,1.0,False

The office environment I work in is filled with shunning. It's hard to get work done. The only way I can get through to someone is by email.

I lost my key card and was let into the elevators by security. The doors to the office were locked… So I was stuck behind a glass door.

I see one of the women who shuns me and I was like… “hmmm she's gotta help me get in the office? Is shunning really gonna stop someone from letting their colleagues into work?” For the 10 seconds she's in front of the glass door I'm screaming her name and banging on the door. She completely ignored me!! If it were a client just standing there she would do something about it.

I got someone else to open the door and I told them what happened and they agreed it was petty. 

The lady who shuns me has coffee in the HR office… They have been friends for 30 years. Next thing I know I’m arguing with her and the HR manager.

Has anyone gotten away with arguing with HR and nothing happening? Is shunning normal? 

My manager isn’t in yet, so I’ll update everyone on what happens if you tell HR to “say it to my face” 🙃.

1ozgao7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1ozgao7/the_invisible_traffic_system_ready_to_pull/,The Invisible Traffic System : Ready to Pull Audiences Out of Thin Air? Here’s the scoop ...,"Thank you for reading our **Invisible Traffic System review**.

The YouTube dashboard has a special talent for making a grown adult feel like a confused intern. I worked at **getting YouTube traffic without showing my face** ... my empty analytics felt like a gut-punch. Even my coffee judged me.

I saw that same mood in Evan, who once pushed a video live, watched it sit at four views, then asked if the internet was broken. He needed **faceless YouTube methods for beginners**, not another motivational tweet, so this system hit at the right moment.

Both of us used the course for **creating YouTube videos without editing** that eat half the night. We just wanted something simple, friendly and not coated in “guru glitter”. Thankfully, this product is more practical than preachy.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Invisible Traffic System  
**Category:** Digital Marketing Tools → YouTube Traffic Systems  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.4/5

The idea behind this tool is surprisingly calm for a YouTube course. You follow **simple YouTube traffic methods that require no filming** and skip the part where you glare at your own camera like an enemy. No lights or microphones needed.

The training lays out **making videos without a camera or microphone**, so the user can assemble clips quickly without feeling like they just opened a film studio. The workflow aims for clarity, not chaos, which already puts it ahead of most courses.

The content reveals how to create **faceless video systems for passive traffic**, avoiding heavy editing. So let's get into the nitty gritty:

# 🧩 How The Invisible Traffic System Works

Right away, the product shows how to build simple scripts, choose visuals and export clips with **AI-powered video creation tools** that handle the boring parts. The tools give structure, so the user spends time thinking, not fumbling.

Next, the training walks through **AI-driven faceless video strategies**, which help the user work beside the algorithm instead of fighting it. Each lesson focuses on one piece at a time to keep the creative load light. Evan liked that part more than he expected.

There are clear examples of **AI YouTube automation** that help assemble clips faster. Think caption aids, script ideas and quick thumbnail helpers. All the little things that drain time get replaced with small, tidy steps.

The training also explains **beginner-friendly AI video traffic methods** and why simple titles and straightforward hooks still bring results. The whole thing feels grounded, like the authors know new creators freeze when tasks get too heavy.

Near the middle, the course covers **using AI tools to create viral videos** by showing how to shape topics and angles with predictable behaviors. Nothing flashy. Just smart patterns that keep early videos from sinking.

A final layer teaches **hands-off video marketing systems**, so the user can upload without juggling fifteen tabs. This section helped Evan finish his first set of clips without losing steam.

# 🔍 Is Invisible Traffic System Legit?

Before testing anything, I checked **whether the Invisible Traffic System is legitimate**. The creators have a long presence online, which makes the product feel like something real people built, not a template scraped together in an hour.

Comments show **genuine complaints about the Invisible Traffic System**, mostly about upsells or expectations. Even so, I saw successful refunds, which calmed my nerves. Evan found that part reassuring, since he has been burned before.

He also checked for **concerns about Invisible Traffic System scams** by reading a few threads. The general vibe was “solid enough for the price”, which is rare in this space. The billing pages are clear and the delivery is instant.

I ran through **Invisible Traffic System pricing details** and saw nothing sneaky. The funnel is standard, predictable and labeled well. Evan liked that it did not hide costs behind random pop-ups.

# 🧰 Features And Training Breakdown

Each module is short and direct, with **zero-editing YouTube video approaches** that help someone publish without fear. The layout keeps energy steady instead of draining it.

Inside the training, the authors demo **AI-powered video creation tools** to show real prompts and real adjustments. Watching that play out builds confidence for someone who has never made a clip before.

I liked how often the lessons returned to **AI YouTube automation** for everyday tasks. The user gets tools that speed things up in small but helpful ways.

One smart section demonstrates **using AI tools to create viral videos** by using trend patterns and simple hooks. The aim here is clarity, not hype. It is a relief to see something honest.

Toward the end, there is a practical set of **hands-off video marketing systems** that bring the process together.

# 👤 Evan's Personal Experience ...

Let me hand this part over to **Evan R.**, a friend of mine from an old plant-based meetup group who somehow ended up running a tiny YouTube side project about cruelty-free tech gadgets. Evan’s the kind of guy who gets excited about anything that saves time because he works long shifts and has the attention span of a caffeinated squirrel. He agreed to try the system and share his honest take.

“I’ll be real: I’ve got zero interest in filming myself, and even less interest in hearing my voice played back like some haunted voicemail. That’s why testing the Invisible Traffic System felt like a safe experiment for someone like me, especially since I’ve tried **ranking faceless videos quickly** before, without much success.

I started a tiny channel just to see what would happen. One evening after work, I put together a short clip using the steps in the training, and it took maybe fifteen minutes. No lights, no mic, no panic attack. Within a couple of days, that video had more views than anything I’d ever uploaded before. It wasn’t viral or anything dramatic, it just finally felt like the algorithm wasn’t ghosting me.

The workflow didn’t feel overwhelming, and once I got into a rhythm, each video required fewer steps. I did run into one drawback: the stock visuals can feel repetitive if you don’t mix things up, but that’s easily fixed by swapping in your own clips or images. The important part is that the core method stayed consistent, and using **simple video automation approaches** genuinely cut the friction that usually kills momentum for beginners.

If you’re camera-shy or juggling a busy schedule, this kind of system makes the whole thing feel less like a chore and more like something you can actually stick with.”

# 🚀 Performance And Effectiveness For Beginners

Welcome to ecom. Nothing is unique.
The game isn’t about having the best product. It is about owning a corner of the market nobody else is thinking about.

Here’s how you actually compete when your product is the same as everyone else’s.

1. Stop targeting the same avatar as everyone else

If you sell the same thing as twenty other stores and you speak to the same generic avatar, you will lose every time.

Most brands aim straight at the “mass market person”
Comfort seekers
Casual hobbyists
General audiences

That avatar already sees 200 ads a day. You are invisible to them.

Pick someone specific.
Someone with a clear identity and clear pain points.
When the ad feels like it was made for that one person, you win.

2. Find the underserved corners inside your niche

Every niche has sub identities nobody is touching.

Instead of going after
“people who like skincare”
think
“people who break out when they’re stressed and overdosing on iced coffee”

Instead of
“people who want better sleep”
think
“people who work night shifts and feel dead by 3pm”

Instead of
“people who exercise”
think
“people who lift alone in their garage and rely on routine more than motivation”

These pockets convert like crazy because nobody else is speaking directly to them.

3. Study competitors until you see their blind spots

Go through Meta Ad Library and look at the big brands selling similar products.

Ask yourself
Who are they NOT talking to
What transformation are they ignoring
What desire are they missing

That gap is your opportunity.

Competitors already proved the demand.
You just step into the angle they didn’t pursue.

4. Shoot creatives for that specific avatar, not the whole world

If your product is a water bottle and everyone else is filming it for gym users
Film it for construction workers who need hydration in the heat
Film it for nurses who work twelve hour shifts
Film it for travelers who hate TSA spills

Same product
Different story
Different emotional payoff

That is how you print.

5. Build the entire brand around that niche

If your first winning angle is “for nurses who work nights”
Your landing page should feel like it was written by someone who has pulled a night shift
Your offer should match their pressure and lifestyle
Your social proof should be from their world
Your creatives should speak their language

Suddenly your brand feels like a home for that avatar
Not another generic store with a generic product.

6. Become the first store they think of for that niche

People buy the first brand that comes to mind when they feel the problem.
Not the best brand.
The first one.

When you go micro niche, you become the only name in that space
Which means even an average product becomes a category leader.

The product didn’t change.
The positioning did.

That is the real skill.
That is how you take a product everyone else is selling and turn it into something that prints serious money.

If you want, I can also break down niche examples for your specific product or help you turn this into a full angle testing plan.",2,1763386122.0,shopify_hustlers,1,1.0,False

1ozg7mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ozg7mj/aita_for_wanting_to_ghost_my_best_friend/,AITA for wanting to ghost my best friend,"*Throwaway. Names changed.*

First time poster i hope I did this right and it makes sense. 

I (27F) have been friends with “Jane” (27F) for a few years. When we met, her marriage was already falling apart. She has three kids and was the main financial support. They had a nanny, her husband stayed home and barely helped, and eventually they began divorce proceedings.

Throughout all of this, I supported her emotionally, mentally, physically, and even financially. I never expected anything in return — she was my friend and I genuinely cared. But over time, it started to feel like my support was being *taken for granted* while the friendship itself became incredibly one-sided.

Any time she started flirting with a new guy at work, she’d disappear for days. I only heard from her when she needed something or wanted to vent, and when the fling crashed she’d suddenly reappear, needing hours of emotional support again.

One example: my beloved dog died. She hadn’t messaged me in two days, then texted solely to confirm I’d still be picking her up for something she needed. I sent two voice notes — one saying my dog had passed, the second confirming I’d still help her. She ignored the part about my dog completely and only talked about pick-up time. When I repeated it, she admitted she “didn’t really pay attention” because she was focused on her plans. That hurt more than I expected.

We had a long talk and she admitted she knew she’d been a bad friend. But even in that conversation, when I told her *three separate times* that I wanted us to meet up and clear the air, she brushed past it each time and instead talked about how she and her newest work flirtation were meeting up the next day to “clear the air.” I told her how painful that was — that she could prioritise clearing things up with a guy she barely knew, but not with me.

She then claimed the reason we hadn’t met was because she wanted to “be in a better financial space” so she could treat me. I explained that I wasn’t looking to be spoiled — I just wanted us to talk and fix the friendship. I also pointed out the obvious: she *was* going out with the new guy, she *was* going out with co-workers, and she definitely had energy and money for that… just not for me. Meanwhile, in the messages she did send, the new guy was constantly being mentioned, sprinkled into every story, but she couldn’t spare the same effort to maintain our friendship.

Things got better briefly, then the cycle repeated.

We no longer work together (I’m a stay-at-home wife now), but she kept saying she “missed me” and that we should meet. Every time, I’d tell her, “Just tell me when, and I’ll make a plan.” She never followed through.

Most recently, she didn’t speak to me for a week. Then she suddenly sent a “check-in” message. I was polite but distant. She said she missed me again and suggested coffee. I said, “Let me know when,” and she said sometime in the coming week.

She went silent the entire week.

Six days later she messaged again, same tone implying she wasn’t doing well. I replied bluntly that I was fine, hoped she was fine, and that I was still waiting for her to make a plan — which clearly wasn’t happening. She didn’t respond. When she finally did message again, it was a casual “hi,” like nothing had happened.

At this point, I’m exhausted. I feel like I’m just the person she turns to when she’s lonely, struggling, or her latest flirtation falls apart — never when she’s actually happy or busy. It feels like I’m the emotional safety net she drops whenever something more exciting comes along.

So AITA for considering just ghosting her? Should I push again for a real conversation, send one last message explaining my feelings, or just let the distance happen naturally?",5,1763385950.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,13,1.0,False

I am part of a large WhatsApp group that holds social events. I met a cute girl at said event (it was like a sunday outdoors party with some drinks, dj etc)

Context: I was sitting across from her at a big group table. 4 people (me and another guy on one side and her and another girl on the other). We were like playing some get-to-know-you card game where you ask unconventional questions about each other.

Anyways, we chatted one-on-one for a bit in the group setting for a bit, and she mentioned like dating scene and stuff so I know she’s single. 

Was gonna ask for her number but I went to another part of the party and didn’t see her again.

But her number is in like the big WhatsApp group. (Like 250 people in the group).

I wouldn’t say I got like super hard vibes that she was into me. But definitely didn’t get the impression she wasn’t interested either. (Let’s be honest though; I am but a simple man and have no idea if women are interested in me or not haha)

Anyways. Would it be creepy to ask her for drinks or coffee by contacting her on WhatsApp without her explicitly giving me her number? 

I feel like if she’s not interested it’s kinda awkward for her as she cant just unmatch me like on a dating app.

Pretty good chance I will run into her again where I could ask in person but you never know…

So shoot my shot? Or just wait and hope I see her again and not be a creep.

Not as bad as some of the stories I’ve read here, but it’s really messing with my head and I need some advice. I don’t really have anyone else to talk to about it.

Long story short, I dated this girl for two months (brief, I know — and that’s part of what’s bothering me). We were friends before, not close, just a bit of mutual interest and the occasional message.

I had just come back from living abroad three months ago, and about two weeks before returning she started messaging me in a flirty way, asking to grab coffee and all that. I thought, why not?

We did, and I really liked her. Immediately I noticed she wasn’t trying to be “just a friend.” We kissed that night. After that she started talking to me every day, and things escalated really fast.

We started seeing each other every weekend and even during the week. She told me she didn’t want a relationship because she had just broken up with her ex of 7 years (I know, don’t be mean). I agreed because I wasn’t sure either, but then she asked for exclusivity.

The thing is, she said she didn’t want a relationship, but at the same time she started treating me like her boyfriend. Talking about our future, introducing me (informally) to some of her family, all her co-workers knew we were “dating” because I picked her up from work sometimes.

I genuinely did my best, but I constantly felt like I wasn’t a priority. It was like she was fitting me into her schedule, but not doing the same for me.

Three weeks before ending things, I noticed she was still in contact with her ex. I told her I wasn’t okay with that. By that point this was FAR from being casual. She told me she was in love with me, that I was everything she wanted, etc.

She promised they were only in contact because he was going through a rough time and for logistical reasons, nothing more. I tried to believe her, but my gut kept telling me something was off. I kept feeling like I wasn’t a priority, like she didn’t respect my time, and that she escalated everything really fast and then blamed me for “having too many expectations” while still talking about the future, introducing me to family, etc. It was insane.

I was getting a lot of anxiety and noticing that I felt weird every time she was on her phone. I didn’t trust her. I was becoming someone I’m not. So I decided to end things for my mental health.

I told her everything. I honestly wanted her to fight for it. She insisted a bit but also let me go. I blocked her everywhere. She called me that night and I didn’t answer. She called again a week later saying she wanted to fix things and be with me. I told her how I felt and that I needed a lot more from her, starting with cutting contact with her ex. I’d had a drink so I said we should talk later.

I unblocked her. The next day I woke up to a message saying I was right, that we should end things, that she wasn’t bringing anything good into my life — and then she blocked me.

That completely messed me up. I told her I wanted to talk, that you can’t call someone saying all those things and then send a breakup message and block them less than 24 hours later.

We talked that day. She said she only had 15 minutes, and in the coldest way possible told me I was good to her and she was bad for me, and that we should leave it at that. I said “ok, bye haha,” but honestly it crushed me.

I know she’s not good for me. I know a lot of this is my ego being hurt, and I’m mad at myself for letting things get this far without taking better care of myself. I’m sure she’s not coming back after that conversation, but I feel stuck. And even though it was just two months, I don’t know why it hurts this much. It’s so annoying how much it’s distracting me from work and life in general.

Any advice? :(

I (M18) am spiteful and irritated by it because I feel like they dont trust me at all to basically take care of myself to a certain degree

Hello, I apologize if this is the wrong sub to ask this question, and I will remove it if asked to do so. Its just, this one has been bugging my mind for quite some time now and I have no idea where or who to ask

For context, my parents both came from a family oriented culture, family always comes first before anything and anyone. Now, I do understand the importance of family supporting each other, its just, often times I get irritated by how my parents view this sometimes. My parents seem to think that it is their job to protect us and prevent us from making mistakes and therefore they often try to involve themselves in our lives to a point where it feels like they are either too attached, micro managing us, or both

For instance, I remember one night when me and my mom were coming home from getting some groceries, she was telling me about the importance of letting them know where we are or who were with at all times, even when we are adults. Basically saying that ""if something happens to us"" they know our last known location or who to speak to. Many times when I came home late at night from the gym, or to hang out with a friend I often got scolded by my parents who kept telling me how I was gonna get kidnapped, mugged or beaten by some bum on the street. If im going somewhere they want to know the exact address or the names of who im going out with or they get really irritated if I dont tell them much about it. If im going to catch a trainbearly in the morning, my parents have to know about or they will worry too much. If im going to catch an Uber, my mom will watch me like a hawk and won't leave until I get in. Just the other night, I heard my parents arguing with my sister (she is 25 years old) who lives in another country for not letting them know where she was all night and it came to a point where they had to text her friend where she was, then proceeded to give her a lecture about how dangerous some areas in the city could be and why she has to let them know where she is when they ask her. (From what I got out of that argument, she was studying in a coffee shop with friends for an exam, and later went to have a sleep over at their house).

Another irritating for me is when they tell me they have a right to get involved in my decision making ""and guide me to make the right choice"". Now, im only 18 years old, and given I dont know much about the world I think there is a level validity to this thought process. Its just, the way conversations like this normally goes is that, if im  not making a decision that they like or can accept, im automatically wrong. My first time making a major decision for myself was when I decided I am going to enlist in the military, when I first tried to have a real conversation with them it didn't take long before I got called crazy and stupid. Despite me doing all my research, connecting with veterans and reading about their experiences, and taking my time to weigh the pros and cons they told me that none of that mattered because I was still ""a kid"" and ""too young"" to make decisions for myself. That because they were my parents, they knew more than me because they had more life experience, they were right and I was wrong even if I had done more research than them. I was called disrespectful, inconsiderate of their feelings, the reason they would die early, ignorant, and at one point they started discussing if they should schedule me to see a therapist to make sure that I dont have Any psychological issues that is making me ""choose danger"", which really pissed me off. Their excuse for saying all this when I confronted them about it? ""They love me and care for me, so its natural for them to worry""

Now, im only 18 and dont have a lot of world experiences. I dont understand what its like to be a parent, and im probably willfully ignorant, spiteful, irrational and immature to a certain degree regarding this topic. I also have to admit that I am probably being unfair to how I represented my parents in this post as they are good people and I can see they really love me and my siblings and want the best for us, and I myself have been incredibly rude and disrespectful to them at times. Its just, their views on making sure that that I am safe at all times, making sure that they ""guide me to the right path"" at all times, makes me feel insulted. It makes me feel that they don't trust me to be independent to a certain degree, that they dont trust me to think for myself  and make some good decisions, that they don't trust me to take care of myself, and that all they can see in me is a small fragile boy that is in need of their protection and guidance 24/7. I am spiteful of it because in my opinion, their protective mentality has left me underdeveloped socially compared to a lot of people my age, and their inability to understand that combined with their protectivenedd has made me lose trust and comfort in opening up to them about anything at all

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

I am 95% sure my ex has ROCD and he broke up with me two weeks ago out of nowhere. He talked about feeling like he doesn't love me in ""that way anymore"" and thought maybe he loved me more as a friend, felt guilt for attraction and urges to ""get to know others"", said he wasn't built for the safe relationship I was offering, has reported feeling foggy post-break, etc. He seemed very conflicted himself during the breakup, crying alot and bargaining here and there. It's worth mentioning I am his first safe, stable relationship and we have been exclusive for a four months and were dating for one.

I wrote him a google doc letter the few hours after the breakup, admittedly a bit heavy with my perspective on everything since I didn't get to have my full say. He said he needed a ""couple days or so"" to get in a better headspace to read it and hoped I was kind myself. Then that turned into almost couple weeks which I never expected so I reached out and he said he read it, though the first read frustrated him so he needed space to sit with it and wanted to ""feel things out"", and he plans to reread it when he is less ""foggy"". I did send him a text about knowing about relationship OCD and researching it then told him we didn't have to talk about it over text and he didn't engage but did say he is starting therapy this week. 

He wants to get coffee in a couple days to catch up and says he is looking forward to it, so I am just so curious how that is going to go, if I am going to be firmly friend-boxed or not. My letter did call for a potential pause which he himself said during the breakup he wasn't opposed to but he just didn't lock anything in.

I came to Delhi 2 years back for studies and from that point of time , I have always been googling is this place safe to go? Asked seniors which areas were safe to explore, everyone gave different answers. Some said South Delhi was fine, others said don't go anywhere alone after dark. Nobody had actual data, just ""vibes."" Saw girls posting their solo adventures looking confident, meanwhile I was googling ""is this safe for girls"" before leaving my room. My mom and dad would call me 1000 times to know if I was safe.

I remember during my first year I skipped plans because most of my friends were day scholars and I don't want to come back my pg alone . I was so literally so frustrated and have to come back to my pg before 7 most of the times. Every time I want to explore somewhere new in Delhi or plan a trip, it's the same anxiety: checking five different sources, asking random people, still not knowing for sure. I don't have a big friend group just me and my 2 friends and that's why it still a problem for us!

**Here's what I realized:** nobody tracks the information that actually matters for solo travelers especially women. Not which cafe has good coffee, but whether you'll get harassed walking there alone at 7 PM.

1. **Does milk/coffee/tea worsen HS?** I can give up soft drinks but giving up milk or coffee is hard for me. Not an addict but just really like stuff with milk especially in winters. Is there any type of milk that's ""better"" than the normal whole milk.
2. **People who passed on biologics and went the natural/herbal route, what sort of stuff did you take that helped? any remedies?** I've been advised to take biologics but I'm really skeptical about them and want to try literally every other option before I say yes to them.
3. **If I had to choose a brand, which should I go for? Humira, cosentyx, something else?**
4. **Lately I've been trying to gym/gain weight - going the supplements + workout route. Is there anything I should avoid? (Like milkshakes, creatine, other supplements).**

1ozfnfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indoorclimbinggym/comments/1ozfnfk/what_chalk_are_you_using_right_now_and_why/,What chalk are you using right now and why?,"So I’ve been thinking about chalk way more than I probably should. When I first started climbing I literally grabbed whatever the gym sold at the counter and never questioned it. It was just… white dust that magically made my hands less gross. But lately I’ve noticed people have actual strong opinions about chalk. Like some climbers will defend their brand like it’s their favorite coffee or something. I saw a guy rage when his liquid chalk was sold out and I kinda respect the passion.

For me, it’s been a weird little journey. Some days loose chalk feels amazing and I’m sticking to slopers like Spider-Man. Other days my fingers get sweaty and suddenly nothing sticks and I’m sliding right off the start hold like it’s made of ice. I started wondering if I’m using the wrong type or maybe just not chalking up right. Sometimes I’ll clap my hands and a huge cloud goes everywhere, and I’m like, great, half my chalk is on the mat now. Sorry gym staff.

Then there’s chalk balls. I used to think they were just for neat freaks but honestly they make sense when the holds are dusty or when I don’t want to look like I’m wasting a bunch of chalk. Although sometimes I squeeze it and get like… one grain. And I’m standing there rubbing the ball like a confused hamster thinking, hello… please work.

Liquid chalk is the biggest mystery for me. I’ve tried a bunch of them because everyone hypes it up. It does help on the first few tries but after that my skin feels kinda dry? Also why do so many of them smell like they’re made out of kindergarten glue. I’m not trying to relive art class while hanging on a crimp.

I also didn’t realize chalk has grades. Not climbing grades, like chalk grades. Fine. Chunky. Pure magnesium carbonate. Blended. Like excuse me since when was chalk a science experiment. And don’t even get me started on watching YouTube reviews where someone is like “this chalk gives me 7% better friction on sandstone volumes”. Bro how did you measure that.

But I guess small things can make a big mental difference. If you *feel* grippy you climb a bit bolder. If your hands are sweaty and chalk isn’t sticking, you start doubting yourself before you even pull on. It’s kinda wild how something that seems boring ends up affecting confidence on the wall.

So I’m really curious now. What chalk are you using right this second, like what’s literally in your bag. Loose? Ball? Liquid? Fancy branded or cheap bulk stuff? Did you pick it for a reason or was it just what you found first. Do you notice a real difference in grip or is it more of a ritual that helps you reset before a hard move.

And if you’ve switched chalk recently… was it worth it? What changed for you? Help a confused chalk wanderer out because I swear I overthink this way too much lol.

Let me know what your hands are coated in these days. I wanna learn what actually works for other climbers so maybe I finally stop buying chalk just because the packaging looks cool.",1,1763384467.0,Indoorclimbinggym,2,1.0,False

However, when I saw it on sale on Amazon, my curiosity got the best of me and I ordered one.  

The next day after arriving, I  changed out my regular filter screen for this one.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It had no effect on coffee flavor.  It was the same delicious cup of coffee.  The difference was that I no longer had to invert the device to make my coffee to prevent drippage.  

This meant much less chance of the device giving me problems and making a mess all over my kitchen counter.  It also allowed me to safely use my funnel to add coffee and water.  This small device is honestly a game changer and I highly recommend it.  It completely eliminates the need to make coffee using the inverted method.  

  
The only drawback is in cleaning.  The original filter screen usually comes out clean with no grounds in it.  The flow control cap does require you to clean it to remove the grounds.  This is a minor drawback and only takes a second to rinse and clean.  

  
Price for this cap is also a problem.  It is certainly overpriced.  However, as I said earlier, I found mine on sale for $16.00 online.  I think this is still too much for such a simple accessory, but much better than having to clean up spills and messes.  ",0,1763383637.0,AeroPress,5,0.5,False

Want kids in 5 years and relying on pay rises. Is this too risky, and if yes, would you sell sooner or ride it out?



My partner and I have a combined income of \~£150k (me £100k, partner £50k). We expect my partner's salary to increase by £5-15k in the next year, and mine to fluctuate between £100-150k, with possible growth over the next 5 years but nothing guaranteed. Tech sector.



We’ve just bought a 3 bed in SW London for \~£800k with a 10% deposit, 5yr fix, 40yr term. We have a high risk tolerance, the bank would have lent us more fwiw. We chose a house that needs no work and could be a “forever” home (good catchment too). We also have an emergency fund, 3m worst case.



Mortgage is £3.2k/month. Our essential costs (mortgage, bills, commute, food) are about £4.7k/month. On paper that leaves \~£3.5k “discretionary”, but since moving in we’ve been basically spending everything, mostly due to constant house related costs (furnishing and all that). I’m hoping that settles down, we have cut pretty much all our eating out, coffee's out, drinks, etc in the interim.



My concerns:

1. We’d like kids in \~5 years and are basically relying on future pay rises to afford that.
2. I’ve seen people on here nervous about £600k mortgages on similar incomes. Am I missing something, or do we just have an abnormally higher risk tolerance/stupidity?



**Question:**

If it turns out this is too risky, what would be a sensible plan? Sell sooner (even if we take a hit), or ride it out for the next \~5 years on the fix and then reconsider?

In 9g out 18,x g within \~25seconds.  
The extraction on numbers are ok. But the output looks like bearly pouring. And at the final of extraction there is no silky pouring at all

1. if I go finer -> I think I will choke and water will over-extract
2. if I go coarse -> will be less body than now, and the extraction is around 20seconds

The espresso ATM does have no body, is more like african beans, not americam central one (good body, sweet etc). The taste is not bad, I like it, but is weird because I use Costa Rica , yellow honey wased, it's supposed to be different.

I'm new in preparing, but drinking specialty coffee in last 10 yers.  
I use Gaggia e24 + eureka zero 65 ap (in case helps, but I think doesn't count). Also all gear is stock. I'm still pending for a IMS basket.

I know that if you like taste of the coffee in the end nothing is wrong. But in my case here, I expect something silky, a lot of body and not sour at all.

ABYG, inis na inis na ko sa pinsan kong mukhang “SANA ALL”.
Everytime may i-myday ako, laging naka “SANA ALL.” Hindi pala masarap yung feeling na may laging nag sa-SANA ALL, yung tipong kahit simpleng bagay, may sana all agad. Promise, nakakapikon.

Example: lagi kaming nagca-coffee shop ng best friend ko (hobby namin to try diff coffee shops), kaya madalas ko i-myday. Hindi na rin ako ma-FB post lately, so sa MyDay ko nalang nilalagay, pagod na rin kasi ako sa notif lalo na pag may react and comments sa post mo, syempre need mo pa react-an isa isa lol.

Mahilig din pala kami manood ng sine. One time, bucket list ko lang na manood mag-isa, last full show pa, as in ako lang yung tao sa sinehan, so minyday ko. Ayun, kinabukasan SANA ALL na naman sya, di ko pinansin. Iniintindi ko na lang pero sobra na talaga minsan.

One time, nagpapa-edit sya ng invitation sakin. Take note: free yun, di ko sya pinapabayaran kasi alam ko naman yung situation nya. Pero hindi ko lang talaga magawa agad kasi sobrang busy ako with my two jobs. Weekends ko nalang pahinga and ayoko na sana humarap pa sa monitor kasi buong weekdays nasa harap na ako ng screen.

Nag-follow up sya about the invitation. Sabi ko, ""di ko pa nagagawa kasi busy ako sa work"" and in-explain ko naman kung bakit. Then, nagbigay sya ng bagong details (kasi nung una wala pa syang venue). Tapos bigla syang may pa-line sa huli na: “Wag ka muna manonood ng sine, concert, or magkape ah?”

Kaya napa-Huh? at Bakit? Ako sa isip ko.
Parang mali pa yung pag-treat ko sa sarili ko?? Parang di man lang nya naiisip na habang nag-eedit ako ng invitation nya nang libre, ako pagod na pagod sa two jobs ko.

Anyway, back to the pattern:
Iniisip ko na lang na mom of 2 sya, halos magkasunod pa. Yung panganay kaka-1 year old lang nung nabuntis sya ulit. Hindi naman sa nangdodown ako dahil mommy na sya (mas matanda sya sakin by 2–3 years), it’s just that, parang ako pa yung may kasalanan na nage-enjoy ako sa life ko, habang siya nag-aalaga ng kids niya, don't get me wrong, pangarap ko rin maging mommy, pero alam ko sa sarili ko na di pa ko ready even though mag-29 na ko this November, and aminado akong late bloomer ako. Yung gala, inom, experiences is ngayon ko lang talaga naeenjoy, and I always tell myself deserve ko ’to.

Pero ayun nga, itong pinsan ko walang work ngayon dahil sa babies nya. Yung asawa nya di rin naman ganun kalaki ang sweldo. Even nung buntis sya sa pangalawa, sya pa mismo nagsabi na “tita, matanda na ko” kasi CS sya at pinagsasabihan sya ng mga tita namin. Payat na sya dati, tapos mas lalo pang namayat and honestly, parang malnourished na nung buntis sya. Tapos ngayon, pag-aalaga ng panganay nya inaasa nya sa tatay nya (tito ko who’s already a senior and may mga nararamdaman na. Hiwalay nga pala parents nya and naiwan sya sa tatay nya), kasama pa nila isa naming tito na may mental issue.

Sa side ko naman:
Since 2019 breadwinner na ako. Si papa may work pa noon but eventually nag-retire (since 16 yrs old kasi nagtrabaho na sya). After nya magretire tinulungang nya na lang mama ko as helper sa isang sari sari store pang-extra lang rin since maliit lang rin sahod ko that time. And kinaya ko pa noon kasi mas mura pa bilihin, and nagsisimula pa lang rin ako sa corporate world, madami pa ko energy since bata pa that time 🥹

Then 2023, na-stroke and nagka-heart attack si papa. Mas mahirap na kasi halos lahat ng gastos ako na. Buti scholar kapatid ko kaya wala naman akong gastos sakanya. Minsan nakakagala pa rin ako, and nakakanood ng concerts, 3 straight years na. First TWICE (because of my bf), second 2NE1, now BLACKPINK this November. Kanina clinaim na ni boyfie yung tix since this sat na yun then minyday ko yung ticket ko tapos ayun, nag-“SANA ALL MADAMING PERA” sya. Sa sobrang inis ko nasagot ko na sya:

Me: birthday gift to sakin ng bf ko.
Cousin: Mukha ka ng blackpink.
Me: Ikaw nga mukhang sana all.

Gusto ko pa dagdagan pero pinigilan ko sarili ko. Iniisip ko na lang may postpartum sya. And mabuti na lang di na sya nagreply ulit.

Soooo, ABYG??? Valid ba inis ko? Or ako ba may mali?

P.S  this year nag-accept pa ko ng isa pang work. Yung main job ko 3D RTO, 2D WFH. So, yung 2D WFH ko na yun sa main job, yung yung RTO ko sa side job. So ngayon araw-araw biyahe ako, daily 2 laptops dala ko (taga-south ako; Ortigas + Pasay pa yung jobs ko). Pagod pero yung small treats ko sa sarili ko yung nagpapasaya sa akin.

P.P.S. Unahan ko na kayo, bakit di ko na lang i-block o i-hide sa kanya yung mydayko?
Simple lang: I don’t block or hide her because she has her own struggles and responsibilities. It’s not my fault na nage-enjoy ako sa life, and I refuse to live in fear na baka masaktan siya. Sharing my life is how I take care of myself and it doesn’t mean I don’t care about her.",14,1763382819.0,AkoBaYungGago,21,0.85,False
1ozf272,https://www.reddit.com/r/APIcalypse/comments/1ozf272/goal_of_human_life_by_paliba/,goal of human life - by Paliba,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My wife and I have never been on a cruise before, and we are looking at MSC Seascape for our first one, out of Galveston. I've been watching a bunch of videos and doing a bunch of research. Hoping someone can clarify some questions. Thank you!

1. We aren't big drinkers, but we enjoy specialty coffees, smoothies, fresh-squeezed juices, etc. So I assume the non-alcohol package would be good to get. And then we would just pay cash for the individual alcoholic drinks we may want?

2. To pay for things onboard, whether drinks or in shops etc., do you just use your room card or wristband which is connected to a credit card?

3. I know there are multiple ""main dining rooms"" - it looks like the menu is the same for all of them? Do you rotate between them throughout the cruise or are you assigned one of the MDR's and you go to that one the entire time? What happens if you show up at one of the other ones instead?

4. If you're assigned a later dinner time but you would prefer to go earlier, can you just show up and they get you in for an earlier dinner if there is space available?

5. If you don't buy the wi-fi package, there is no connectivity of any kind while onboard? Family wouldn't be able to reach us in case of an emergency for example?

6. I've read about a 15-drink-per-day limit; does that only apply to alcoholic drinks, or to all types of drinks combined? And is that per person? How do they track it?

7. Are the port excursions offered from MSC a good value? Or would you arrange excursions on your own?

8. Do you leave your passport in your room safe during port days? I would be terrified of a disaster happening while on shore and not making it back to the ship before it leaves and watching my passport sail away while I'm in a foreign country.

9. Are the rooms all king beds, or do they have options for two doubles?",2,1763382758.0,MSCCruises,5,0.67,False

So taking a multivitamin helped the left side of my neck but the right side was breaking out. In June I was drinking smoothies to help my immune system before surgery of my thyroid/parathyroid gland. I thought it was the spring mix or arugula that helped because the right side cleared up before surgery then broke out again after I stopped my smoothies. I tried to recreate what I did in June but couldn’t figure it out.   
well two days ago I tried two kiwis in my smoothie instead of one and I’m not sure if it’s the antifungal properties, the vitamin c content or the digestive enzymes in it but I don’t get itchy on my neck after I have this smoothie. All day long. And it seems like my skin is calming down. It’s crazy. and this is was happened in June too, the itchiness went away and it was healing on both sides of my neck.

in case anyone is interested i put these ingredients in my smoothie and I change it around too depending on what i have and what will fit in the smoothie cup :

This spicy cheese spread can be found on most holiday tables and tailgate fests during the Michigan college football season. Michigan cooks pride themselves on making homemade versions. Schuler’s Restaurant and Pub in Marshall, Michigan, produced this horseradish-cheese spread until 1984. Now Win Schuler's Bar Cheese is a national brand and available in many stores in the Midwest. Serve with hard rye crunchy garlic crackers. It is a perfect happy hour addition to a festive table. Our favorite recipe for this savory delight is below.\

Michigan Tart Cherry Pie\
\
Michigan's Cherry Pie is a Favorite.\
\
The Traverse City area is one of the largest growers of sweet and tart cherries in the world. Blessed with the ideal location and weather-moderating factor of the Great Lakes, this area has millions of cherry trees and is a key producer of table fruits and vineyards. While the State of Michigan does not have an official food, the tart cherry pie has been picked in reader’s choice polls year after year. In 2021 the President of the United States stopped by northern Michigan for a slice.\
\
Michigan Pinconning Cheese\
\
Available only in Michigan \
\
If you are traveling mid-Michigan on I-75 near Bay City, take a stop and visit Williams Cheese Company in Pinconning. This family-run cheese producer was started in a barn in 1945. This uniquely Michigan sharp, semi-hard version of Colby cheese was produced and developed in 1915. By the Second World War, Williams Cheese was the primary producer. Its hardness and flavor sharpen with age, and Michigan cooks use it as a replacement for cheddar.\
\
Michigan Smoked Whitefish\
\
Smoked Fish - Bay Port Fish Company\
\
If you have never had smoked fish from the Great Lakes, you are in for a treat. This stable of the great lakes is known for its delicate and flavorful meat. We see many surprised looks from novices as they have their first taste of this delectable light-tasting fish. Smoked Whitefish is available throughout Michigan, but this freshwater delicacy is more common the further north you go. The smoking process yields an ever so slightly salty taste accompanied by the gentle aroma and flavor imparted by hickory or oak smoke.\
\
Hint: When buying smoked fish, make sure it is less than a few days after smoking. Look for a light coppery color. Too dark of color means it was smoked too hot and tends to be dry.\

Famous Trenary Toast from Michigan's UP\
\
This Crunchy Cinnamon Toast is a Breakfast Treat | Source\
\
Trenary Toast is a Michigan Upper Peninsula bakery tradition loved by thousands from Manitoba to Toledo. Trenary was at its peak a logging and mining town. Now there is a mill, a small grocery store, a gas station, a couple of bars, and churches. Yet the bakery is still going.\
\
Trenary Toast is a hard, crunchy, twice-baked bread covered in cinnamon. It travels and stores well because cinnamon acts as a natural preservative. The owner of the Trenary bakery said it best, “You sit down, you collect your thoughts, you introspect, have your morning coffee or afternoon tea and have your toast, or you have people around you, and you have dunks together.”\
\
Trenary Toast is available across the Great Lakes region, typically at high-end and independent groceries.\
\
The Michigan Pasty\
\
\
\
This rutabaga and meat pie was brought to the copper mining area of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula by Cornish immigrants in the 1800s. We have embraced it as our own ever since. The traditional Yooper way to enjoy this buttery crust creation is with two hands. If you’re a student at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, you can expect to see the Pasty in your freshmen dorm.\

There is no other uniquely Michigan foods that will spark arguments than Michiganders' love of Coney dogs. Brought to Michigan by Greek immigrants who passed through New York in the early 1900s, the Michigan-style Coney dog consists of a grilled natural casing hot dog sitting on a steamed bun that has been smothered in meat sauce and topped with mustard and onions. The variations of this concoction are endless. However, there are four basic Coney Island styles found in the Great Lake State.\

Detroit Style – If you have stumbled into Lafayette or American Coney Island in Detroit after a Red Wings game, you will savor a hotdog with a chili meat sauce that is slightly spicy. Typically eaten with a fork because it literally melts away from the sauce before your eyes. Delicious.\
\
Flint Style – North of Detroit, the “Buick City” Coney has a dry meat topping made with finely ground beef heart. Purists will also demand that the only hot dog used is the Kogel natural casing, and the onions are sautéed in beef tallow.\
\
Jackson Style – West of Detroit, Coney aficionados get serious. Here the Coney topping is a very thick sauce of ground beef and heart with a secret blend of spices. Folklore states that Todoroff’s Coney was the first Coney restaurant in Michigan. Located in the train station, the family served their famous Coney until World War II. After the war, the family reopened a new restaurant nearby.\
\
Kalamazoo Style – It is different in Kzoo. Coney Island Kalamazoo claims to be the longest continuously running Coney Island in Michigan. Established downtown in 1915, the restaurant uses skinless grilled Kogel hotdogs with secret spicy meat topping with hints of the exotically expensive Saffron and Turmeric. This is the only style Coney that you do not need a fork to eat and enjoy. However, we found it hard to eat just one.\

The US Senate Michigan White Navy Bean Soup\
\
Served in the U.S. Senate Dining Room | Source\
\
Michigan's navy bean soup has been a menu item for over one hundred years in the U.S. Senate dining room. The Senate bean soup is made with white navy beans, ham hocks, celery, garlic, and parsley. The original recipe included mashed potatoes.\
\
The story goes that Senator Fred Dubois of Idaho and Senator Knute Nelson of Minnesota both requested the hardy soup be placed on the menu in the early 1900s.\

I’m writing this from a place I didn’t quite expect to be at in my late 30s - getting divorced, gay, and learning how to rebuild a life that feels like mine again. It’s strange, liberating, scary, and exciting all at once.

So here I am, doing something I’ve never done before: putting out a genuine call for friendship. I’ve lost myself in someone else’s life for the last little while. 

If you’re in or around DC or NoVa, maybe also navigating transitions, maybe also queer, maybe just someone who values good conversation and genuine connection—I’d love to meet you. I’m looking for friends to grab coffee with, explore the city, laugh at the absurdity of adulthood, talk about life, hike, find great food, go to queer events, or just sit on the couch with takeout after a long week.
A little about me:
• late 30s, lesbian
• Recovering from a tough chapter but hopeful for what’s next
• Loves bookstores, dogs, art, road trips, and people who can appreciate awkward humor
• Trying to say yes to more things, even when it feels scary
If you’re also building or rebuilding your circle, or just want to expand it, I’d love to connect. Sometimes friendship starts with something as simple as “hi,” so… hi.",4,1763382276.0,actuallesbians,2,1.0,False

As America is deep into football season, the USPTO is lining up under center to remind everyone that **teamwork, tenacity, and thoughtfulness** are the real keys to victory! 💪📜

After all, innovation isn’t a solo sport — it’s a full-contact collaboration! 🤝

Just ask the inventors behind:

🏈 **U.S. Patent No. 1,559,117** — the ellipsoid football! Proof that with a little hot air, anything is possible. 😉

🪖 **U.S. Patent No. 9,943,128** — the helmet impact sensor. Because safety’s the best defense (and, let’s face it, the best offense too)!

🏆 **Trademark Reg. No. 882,283** — Super Bowl®, the Big Game™ itself, that reminds us you can’t spell “brandwagon” without “brand”!

Here at America's Innovation Training Camp, we’re all about **moving the goalposts (like U.S. Patent No. 3,908,992) — in the best possible way**! Whether you’re running a search, reviewing a claim, or calling an audible on your workflow, remember:

* 📑 Every application’s a new play.

* 🧠 Every Office Action’s a chance for a comeback.

* 🦾 And every after-final amendment is just a *two-minute drill for improvement*!

So grab your coffee, check your metrics, and get ready to *give 110%* (because we ran the numbers, and **95% just wasn’t enough**)! 📈

Let’s make this week a *winning drive* for innovation:

Don’t fumble your filings!

Keep your morale flags down!

And remember, in the great game of patents — even when you’re under (streamlined) review, **you’re always in play**!

Stay productive, stay positive, and stay in formation!

Let’s punt burnout, tackle excellence, and score big for our stakeholders! 🦅

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1763381748.0,FeudalistParty,0,1.0,False

1ozeoy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/techiesgonemad/comments/1ozeoy8/a_tiny_onpage_seo_trick_that_quietly_boosts/,A tiny On-page SEO trick that quietly boosts rankings (and barely takes 2 minutes),"Okay, sharing a super underrated SEO hack that I swear more people should use — and it’s so simple you’ll wonder why you weren’t already doing it.

# Add a “People Also Ask–style” mini FAQ at the bottom of your article.

Not a full-blown FAQ page… just 2–3 short Q&As that directly answer related search questions.

Why this works:

1. **Google LOVES clear, concise answers.** When you give clean answers in an FAQ format, Google often picks them up for snippets or PAA boxes.
2. **You naturally sprinkle long-tail keywords.** Without overthinking it or stuffing keywords like a robot.
3. **It boosts topical relevance.** You’re basically telling Google, “Hey, I understand everything around this topic — not just the main keyword.”
4. **It improves user experience.** People get quick answers, which increases dwell time and reduces bounce rates.

Here’s a small example:

**Q: Is black coffee good for weight loss?**  
A: Yes — when consumed without sugar or milk, black coffee may boost metabolism slightly.

**Q: How many cups of coffee a day is safe?**  
A: Most research suggests up to 3–4 cups for healthy adults.

Clean. Simple. Helpful.

# Bonus tip:

Mark your FAQ with **FAQ schema**.  
It takes 30 seconds and can help your result appear bigger in SERPs — which = more clicks.

This tiny addition has helped several of my pages jump a few spots without changing anything else.

Try it on one article and see how Google reacts over the next 1–2 weeks.
