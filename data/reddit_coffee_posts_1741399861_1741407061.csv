Naturally, this is fairly big. I tried adding the whole ""he said, she asked, she said"" at the end of some dialogue phrases...but it didn't feel right? But now that I see the lack of ""he said she said"", that bothers me too. 

On one hand, I'm glad I caught this to address...but on the other, I'm not too certain what to do. Do I add all the ""he said, she said""s?

1j68lg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1j68lg9/how_to_reduce_hunger_in_calorie_deficit/,How to reduce hunger in calorie deficit?,"56F.

At 5‚Äô9‚Äù and 169-170 lbs, I am exactly at the border of healthy/overweight BMI.  I do have a broad frame/larger bones, Eastern European peasant stock, all that.

5 or 6 years ago, I lost 30 lbs via CICO, and I have kept 15 of them off. 

Currently, I would like to decrease fat and increase muscle (body recomp). I look okay, but could stand to drop a bit, particularly around the belly. That would be healthiest for me, and I could wear my old pants again.

This is harder after a few chronic injuries, but I know it‚Äôs not impossible. I can‚Äôt push hard (athletically) like I used to, at least not yet. Sometimes I have to rest during flareups. Aside from these mostly healed orthopedic injuries, the rest of my health is quite good. And I know that weight loss is mostly diet.

So about a week ago, I decided to attack the remaining 15-20 lbs. I got myself onto Chronometer and set my initial deficit at 500 calories/day. Yes, I am weighing what I consume, except for greens and carrots, and black coffee. Better yet, for the first time ever, I am actually paying attention to macros: I am getting sufficient protein (at least 70g/day‚Äîtotally a first for me) and decent healthy fats. My carb intake is the lowest it‚Äôs ever been. I‚Äôm basically only eating healthy things: a lot of veggies and whole food, beans, berries; tofu, eggs, cottage cheese, some bread/tortillas, but minimal. I do eat a Beyond Burger about once per day because I want the protein and satiation.  I‚Äôm okay with this and haven‚Äôt been missing anything. If I did I‚Äôd find a way to work it in. 

I don‚Äôt have an issue with bingeing or emotional eating. I used to many years ago, but not now. 

So here‚Äôs my problem:
I am so freaking hungry, it‚Äôs difficult to function.  
The hunger settles in, and it feels like a low grade burning all day, in my core and the center of my limbs.  Plus a lot of ‚Äúfood noise‚Äù thoughts.

‚ÄúBackfilling‚Äù with carrots or berries helps when I‚Äôm extra hungry.  I‚Äôve compensated a bit with caffeine, but if I push that too hard I end up with adrenal fatigue, so I can‚Äôt do that. (This used to be a good trick when I was younger/premenopausal, but not so much anymore.)

Last night I ate a lot more food‚Äînot out of any bingeing, but because I just HAD to, physically.  I was SO hungry. My body was all, ‚ÄúYESSS!!!!‚Äù

Now I changed my Chronometer set to lose only 1/2 pound a week, perhaps just to ease into it. But I‚Äôm still hungry.  

What on earth can I do to make this hunger go away?

I have a friend who‚Äôs on Weight Watchers; but their idea of ‚Äúfree foods‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, because the ‚Äúfree‚Äù foods still contain calories and I expect that I would probably not lose weight. 

Thank you for any thoughts!

I've been a long-time player since the game was released, and while the events, prizes, and rewards have always been decent in the grand scheme of the game, but I will give credit to say I‚Äôve noticed a significant improvement in their visual quality over the years. However, I‚Äôve always had bigger ideas for the game. Whenever a survey was conducted, I consistently addressed the lack of shadows and warmer lighting, inventory/home store management and organizing, the (still) limited build mode features, and the need for terrain modifications, like creating hills and land dips, foundations, and terrain paints. Not to mention, the town map view has some serious visual issues with balconies, patios, doors, windows, railings, and overall just poor visual quality. Its 2025. Let‚Äôs get it together now.. Sims Mobile was perfect in a lot of ways so SFP needs to rip a few pages from their book without jeopardizing their success. 

I've been extremely bored with the game due to its repetitive nature over the past couple of years, but I‚Äôve kept up with their social media and YouTube creators to decide whether to engage with the updates, which is probably only a handful of them I‚Äôve done from start to end in the past year. I just wanted to say how happy this lighting update makes me, and I‚Äôm looking forward to building again, and I hope this lighting effect will eventually apply to the town map view across the different towns we have now. I just think the next phase of overall game improvements should include a complete cleanup of the map view, followed by updates to build mode and inventory/home store. I don't need or want anotherrrrr coffee machine or some stupid sofa - I want to see REAL improvements with every update more than ever.

My family has owed it since the 30‚Äôs, back then it was small, just a two story house a small pond and a tree line boarding the edge of the field. It was a struggle in the beginning but as time went on we bought up more farms around us. Nowadays it was a vast expanse of nothing but wheat, stretching as far as the eye could see, without a single speck on the horizon. It was peaceful existence, at least that‚Äôs what I thought until the farm was mine.
	
Well it‚Äôs funny how the older you get how your precipitation of the past changes. When I was a young it was a place of adventure and mystery. I would run through the golden string like stalks of wheat, or swing in the pond on a rope that seemed like it had always been there. But as I got to be a teenager I viewed this place as a prison, some where to break out of, try and get far away. Like many others I left. But as I got older the memories of the farm was warm happy ones, where a child like wonder and a slower time called to me. So I conceded. 	
	
For awhile the farm had lived up to the fantasies in my head. The only complaint was the awful smell at night, but this was to be expected there was a pig farm a little ways down the road. It was ran by an old man who didn‚Äôt come out much. Many would describe him as eccentric, others would just say he was caught up in the past. Whatever that‚Äôs worth I never met him, so I hadn‚Äôt made my opinion yet. 
	
I remember the first time, went to go drink my coffee on the porch as usual before starting my chores. There in front of my door was an old burlap sack and it seemed to have a note pinned to it say  ‚Äúyou take , you leave‚Äù. Looking inside it I saw what was meat wrapped in brown butcher paper. It was still cold so I took it in put it away, grabbed some grain from the bin and set it on the porch. Now to some of y‚Äôall this might seemed odd, but where I come from trading between farmers was common practice. After leaving the sack I went to work when I stopped for lunch I noticed the sack was gone. I figured my neighbor had grabbed it. 
	
That night I decided I would have some of the pork he had given me. It was a beautiful dance of tenderness and savory delights that before I knew it I had eaten everything I cooked. ‚ÄúMust have been the freshness‚Äù I thought out loud. It had been awhile since I had  fresh meat like that. Come to think of it I was young, my father used to have it every Thursday. That was before he ran off. I was probably 15 back then. no one told me what was going on, but as I got older I could put the pieces together. 
	
I kept trading with joe, I came to find out his name from an old address book my dad had left. I found myself looking forward every week to his drop offs. Till one week I was so busy I forgot to bring the bag and fill it with grain, after that the sack stop coming. I noticed that night the smell had gotten stronger like it was closer than before, it kept me up at night. Soon after I would hear the occasional long high screech of the deck and a faint tapping sound on the door. But every time I would try to focus, it seemed like it got even softer, making me question whether or not I was hearing it or if my brain was just trying to fill the gaps. It was driving me up a wall. 
	
Then one night I was woke straight out of my sleep my heart was racing, and that smell was even worse I could barely catch my breath. Then I heard what had woke me up ‚Äútap, tap, tap‚Äù against the window. I jerked my head to the window beside my bed and in the moon light all I could see was a long bony finger with a long curved finger nail on it. A chill rain down my spine, not because of the finger but as I panned up I caught just its bloodshot eyes peering at me on the top of the window. Fear over took me and I shut my eyes. But as soon as I open them it was gone. There was no way I was going to sleep that night so I sat up just try to tell myself it was my tired mind. 
	
I just got straight to work that morning, I didn‚Äôt even make coffee. The whole day just trying to shake that feeling last night. I could see him clear as day every time I closed my eyes. That look he gave me it was like he had that gleeful hungry look you give when you are looking through the glass at a butcher shop. That evening I called it quits early and went down to the old watering hole, I needed a good smoke and drink. 
	
Figured it would help, but while I was down there I ran into an old friend Pete. We hadn‚Äôt talked in years, he sat down and we talked, drank, and had a good time. I don‚Äôt know why but joe had came to my mind I hadn‚Äôt gotten a sack from him in a month or so. So I asked Pete ‚Äúhey do you know old Joe he lives down by me‚Äù. ‚ÄúYea It‚Äôs sad what happened to him‚Äù said Pete, ‚Äúwhat happened‚Äù I asked ‚Äúabout 2 or so years ago he went missing, we thought he had ran off like the all the others but about three months later we had found his body‚Äù Pete answered. I looked at him weird, Pete took a shot staring off like he was trying to collect himself for the next sentence. He continued ‚Äúthere was limbs and pieces missing off him like someone had carved him up‚Äù, ‚Äúwho has the farm now‚Äù I nervously asked. ‚ÄúNobody, they had trouble selling the place after he had passed‚Äù Pet said after taking a shot. 
	
I went home that night feeling even worse than I had when I went in. That night I stayed up watching the tv. Sometime in the night I was woke again by the awful smells filling my lungs. Then loudly ‚Äúknock, knock, knock‚Äù I got straight out of my chair it was coming from my front door. Slowly trying not trying to make a sound I tiptoed to the window trying to get a view of my front door. When I looked I was frozen in shock. Standing in front of my door was this humanoid creature. The skin was brown and it was like it had wrinkles every where that had been pulled tight, as if it body was pulling it in. The body itself was tall with long limbs that looked as if someone had hung skin on bones. And as look up. Its head was shaped like an oval with two wide open blood shot eyes. Then sharply it looked at me and I could see it had a smile that stretched all the way across its face bearing its teeth, that where oddly white, even though the rest of him looked as if he had cleaned himself in years.
	
I blacked out my body couldn‚Äôt had the terror. The next day i woke up and I had a dull stinging pain in my hand. I looked down and my hand was missing nothing but a bloody stump. I freaked out ran to the kitchen to grab a towel so I could go to the hospital. I told them i had lost it in a farming accident, so they got me fixed up and sent me on my way. When I got home I noticed there was something on the counter when I got closer it was another package wrapped in butcher paper with a note beside it that read ‚Äúyou take, You leave‚Äù.",2,1741404461.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

After one falling through last minute a few weeks ago, this one is in a better location, bigger, and really well kept.  The basement is finished and has access outside access from the front of the house. 

I love the idea of airbnb, but after thinking about it, we don‚Äôt want to give up our backyard. We have dogs, and are coming from an apartment, so we‚Äôre not willing to give the yard up for X amount of days. So we loved the separate access from the front yard. 

We‚Äôre in a mountain town, so there will be plenty of things to do, as well as a 5 min walk from a park and a coffee shop, and downtown is about a 20 min walk. 

We are a few weeks from moving in, but trying to get a head start of setting it up. Seems like with our city, we‚Äôll need to get one of the limited number of permits. It also seems like the whole thing will need to be set up and ready to go before they issue it. 

What are some that you did when you first started that worked well? We have a washer and dryer in the basement, clean carpet, 2 bed, but the second one is small and we‚Äôre not sure what to do with it. We‚Äôd like to put in a pull out couch for sure.  We‚Äôll also need a kitchenette.

Respectfully, we do live far enough to need to road trip/fly/train and she didnt bother to see me or meet up for 5 years. also dont particularly want to go to her wedding and have been struggling with that decision. Not sure if I try to give her the benefit of the doubt or go out of town the weekend shes visiting

Background for those who like to read:
I (27F) had a friend in college (27F) who thought we were close than we were maybe? We caught up via phone here and there but made no effort to visit for over 5 years. Im not mad about it bc I moved on and i dont think she really has friends now/ only hags out with her fiancee and some of her co workers. She speaks poorly about my friends im in touch with still from college and is nasty prob bc she‚Äôs projecting (like insulted my job to other people like my girl what also we are both nurses so its not like we do anything glam) She invited me to her wedding which was nice and invited me to be in the wedding party. I felt uncomfortable but thought I could pull through. She had a stressful moment after asking me (not an excuse AT ALL) and completely came at me for NO reason to project stress. In that projection, she insulted my bf (she doesnt even know him lol) and I told her to knock it off bc it was mean and i wont tolerate that. It was really bad and then she gaslit me and said I needed to ‚Äúcool down‚Äù and then didn‚Äôt apologize but gave some half assed paragraph apologizing for being stressed but not insulting and being exclusive. I responded and said in order for our friendship to continue, I cant be in the wedding. She didn‚Äôt apologize but continued to apologize for ‚Äúthinking out loud to you‚Äù (like no you INSULTED me and used me as a human punching bag) and then slapped on his name onto the save the date and mailed it to us. 

Honestly, if she had apologized and said she wanted to invite the both of us‚Ä¶ i would have been able to move forward. She didnt. And ive been struggling with the decision to go to the wedding at all/alone. 

Ive been keeping quiet bc I have some time before I have to decide. She texted me and asked if I would be around in my own city in a few months (of course i would be bc I freakin live here?) and said she was coming to this city to visit her husbands friends and asked to see me (for a quick drink or coffee bc they have a super busy weekend). I thought it was weird maybe her poorly worded way of trying to make things up. Idk why it irked me so bad. Like we do live in different cities (5 hour drive, 40 min flight, 4 hour train) so there would be travel and in the 5 years she never asked to like meet half way, meet up and visit hometowns (both major cities), or just do a trip together. (Again im not mad she didnt do this) but like its been too long and its kinda weird and super awk of her to ask and act like nothing happened esp after she was super out of line? Coffee or a drink wont cover up the past honestly? And if she thinks it will, shes kidding herself. 

Im def sensitive to the topic (but if someone offended you and insulted your partner then how else would you react??) and am wary of her and if she thinks that visiting and penciling me in for a quick drink smooths it all over and will make me wanna come to her wedding (it wont). I dont wanna RSVP no and have her come to town and bitch me out and i dont wanna get a drink with her then RSVP no and have her come at me again. My other friend invited me on a trip that weekend that shes in town and I really want to say yes and just get out of town but I feel really petty doing that. Should I just make a choice, tell her before she comes to town, and then go out of town? Or should I give her the opportunity to meet up really quick? ",1,1741404294.0,AskWomenNoCensor,4,1.0,False

He provides a lot, roof over me and our son‚Äôs head, food on the table, water to drink.. yeah what am I complaining for right? I should always be grateful that im in this position, which i am. It‚Äôs just there are things that still bothers me, that ruins my mood, sucking the soul out of me little by little, draining my life day by day, inch by inch. Idk if im just a whiny wife, but here are some things that messes w my head everyday:

1) He NEVER puts his coffee mugs in the sink after he used them, there‚Äôs always hundreds of them outside where he smokes (i told him a million times to put it in the sink after he finish using it, i dont mind washing it, JUST PUT IT IN THE FUCKING SINK) but noopee, still compiling outside the house. Til this day, i let it be, there are still 4-5 mugs outside the house, not gonna touch it ever unless he brings it in. This is so sad for me, cus he knows i got a bad eczema on my hands, so everytime i wash BUTTLOADS of dishes, i have to wear gloves, wash the gloves, dry the gloves, also wash my hands bc rubber gloves makes me itchy a bit etcetc my main point is its hell and back on earth for me to do dishes, and he‚Äôs not considerate of that. We once had a big fight bc when we‚Äôre at our inlaws (his fam) he fucking WASHED HIS MUG??? Huh? Since when the fuck do u do that? So you care what your family says about you instead of caring about your eczema hands wife? Yea fuck you.

2) he rarely takes care of our son. I literally do everything. He only takes care of him if i told him to. Sometimes when i shower, i have to actually ask him ‚Äòcan you watch him for a bit‚Äô he has this ugly smug face and said ‚Äòk‚Äô like um wtf? You‚Äôre supposed to b excited?? He‚Äôs your son??? You will b rarely seeing him cus you work offshore???? Get this, infront of his family, he acts so fatherly, playing with him, taking care of his diapers etc while me, if we‚Äôre actually home, IM DOING ALL THE FUCKING STUFF, not him. He literally does shit IF i tell him to. He‚Äôs never considerate of how tired i am 24/7. 90% of the time if I dont wanna see his smug face if i have to shower and no one is watching our son, i had to put our son in his crib and let him watch ms rachel on ipad, eventho it hurts me doing that cus im limiting his screen time. And what was my husband doing that time? PLAYING LEAGUE OF LEGENDS, and he‚Äôll be like ‚Äòsorry im in game, i cant quit‚Äô well fuck you. And also get this, when i found out that im pregnant and i wanted to abort it (cus i know im not ready) he was the ONE who strongly insisted to keep it cus he said he cant wait to be a dad. Well step the fuck up bro

3) idk if im wrong or just exaggerating but he prioritizes his family over me and my son. If there was a fire, he would save his 4 brothers and 5 sisters instead of his wife and son. He would go to the ends of the earth for them ( once he had to deliver something car oil at 6AM for his sister n her husband, 6AM??? Mf usually wakes up at 2pm ffs. 

4) he has this obsession w fixing up old cars he would spend loads of money on it and w literally his blood, sweat, tears and his time. Yo i don‚Äôt mind mf got a hobby, i got a hobby too, that‚Äôs great for him, but wht abt when i need to shower???? Do i have to go outside to ask you to watch over our son again with your ugly smug face again?? to sum up he has 2 obsession, league of legends and his car. None of which you can bother him at all. My hobby is just gym. JUST GYM. FOR 1 HOUR. At which i can ONLY work out when my son takes his afternoon nap! I just want him to evenly schedule his hobby.. not to the point he doesn‚Äôt have time for his son or me. Do u think he listens? Nah. Everytime i told him this he‚Äôll be like ‚Äòthis is the only time i can do this, while im working at sea i cant do this stuff‚Äô im like HELLO? cars and games are forever?? Your wife and son could leave you or die anytime? wtf is his mindset mahn istg he‚Äôs still acts like a teenager. I literally feel like i have 2 sons as of this time.

5) his dirty clothes and socks. Need i say more? I feel like almost every wife experienced this. 

6) he spills his coffee and chocolate milk every where in the kitchen but never wipes it. (I once saw the mf VACUUMS his family‚Äôs kitchen bc there was a spilled rice grains). Basically he‚Äôs really sloppy. 

There are more but that‚Äôs the top of my head. Idk what I should do. Everytime i tell him whats been bothering me, we always have a huge fight and it always ends with (ok i promise i wont do it again) but he still does and its and endless cycle. I cant leave him bc I literally have no money to raise my son alone (AND my mom is getting old, so i have to take care of her too). So til now im just tolerating everything but it drains my energy so much but at the same time i put on a happy smile on my face for my son, i dont ever want my son to see depressed or angry. 

Mind you, he used to b very sweet and thoughtful at the beginning of our dating life and marriage life. I thought he was the most amazing guy. I know he loves me and my son, but i dont think he loves me enough to change his ugly habits. ",2,1741403882.0,TrueOffMyChest,12,0.63,False

Like, I‚Äôm talking **10,000-piece**, *takes-months-to-finish* level dedication. My most recent one? A **custom** $2,000 puzzle of a Van Gogh painting. (Yes, I know I have a problem.)

Enter my neighbor‚Äôs cat, *Mittens*.

Mittens is an **unholy menace** who sneaks into my house **constantly**. I told my neighbor to keep her inside, but they always say, *‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just exploring!‚Äù*

Well. Mittens ‚Äúexplored‚Äù my living room, jumped on my puzzle table, and sent **three months of work** crashing to the floor. I swear I saw her **smirk** before walking off.

So, I may have‚Ä¶ **framed Mittens for a crime she didn‚Äôt commit.**

After she **obliterated** my puzzle, I had a moment of clarity: Mittens wasn‚Äôt just a cat. **She was a menace to society.** So, I hatched a plan.

I gathered **every piece of evidence** I could:

* Scratched-up furniture (thanks to her previous ‚Äúvisits‚Äù).
* A chewed-up shoelace (Mittens‚Äô favorite snack).
* The most damning clue? A **half-eaten bird corpse** from my backyard.

Then, I wrote an **anonymous letter** to Animal Control that said:

>

I signed it **‚ÄúA concerned citizen.‚Äù**

Two days later, **the van showed up.**

My neighbor ran outside, screaming about how *Mittens would never hurt anyone!* But it was **too late.** The officers had already found my ‚Äúevidence.‚Äù They even interviewed me, and I, with **tears in my eyes**, whispered, *‚ÄúI just want to feel safe in my own home.‚Äù*

Mittens was **taken away in a little carrier**, meowing in protest. My neighbor sobbed, calling it a **miscarriage of justice**. But deep down, I knew:

Justice had been **served.**

Now, I sip my coffee every morning, gazing upon my brand-new, **cat-free puzzle table**, knowing that Mittens is probably locked up **in kitty Alcatraz**, telling the other inmates about the time she was framed for murder.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

4. customer latte art requests. i‚Äôm not sure how the satisfaction scores would work with this, but even just as a voluntary request would be cute and fun.

5. different espresso options (long, ristretto, blonde, decaf). possibly solely for the ‚Äúcoffee purists‚Äù in the game?

6. an online gallery where people can upload their latte art! i love looking at creations on here for inspiration or even just to awe at it. maybe a competition as well?

7. CUSTOMER STORYLINES/ARCS. as a barista i love my regulars and honestly seeing them grow/change everyday. a random example maybe one girl comes in saying she‚Äôs going on a date, then the next day she comes in and says how the date went, the next day they come in together? ü•π how cute , and it would definitely want me to keep playing.

The love that doesn‚Äôt just walk beside you but truly understands the rhythm of your steps, matching them, sometimes leading, sometimes following, always in tune.

It will be the love that makes you feel things you never thought possible, stirring emotions deep within you, awakening a warmth in places you thought had long gone cold. It will be the kind of love that gently erases the scars of the past, not by ignoring them, but by showing you they no longer define you.

This love will wake before you in the morning, slipping out of bed just to make you coffee, because they know the way you like it. The exact amount of sugar, the way you hold the cup for warmth before taking your first sip. They will remember the smallest things, like that one time you said you liked buttons, and somehow, weeks later, they‚Äôll surprise you with a handful of the most charming ones they could find, just because they thought of you.

They won‚Äôt mind when you stop to admire a particularly beautiful rock on the ground, instead, they‚Äôll smile, kneel down beside you, and agree that yes, this rock is, in fact, very cool. They will know your favorite perfume, the one that makes you feel like yourself, and they will surprise you with it on days when they sense you need a reminder of who you are.

This love will feel your energy shift before you even speak, will notice when your light begins to dim. And without asking, they will pull you close, arms wrapped around you, as if holding you together while you recharge. When your mind becomes too loud, when thoughts press in too heavily, they will be there to wipe your tears, to remind you that you are not alone in the weight of your own mind.

Their hand in yours will be more than just a touch. It will be a promise, an anchor, a quiet vow that they are here and they are staying. With them, silence will be comfortable, words will be unnecessary, because they will know what you‚Äôre thinking just by looking at you. And when words do come, they will finish your sentences without hesitation, and you will both dissolve into laughter, knowing that your souls are speaking the same language.

This love will not be perfect, but it will be real. It will be the love that makes you feel loved,not just in grand gestures, but in the smallest, most beautiful ways. And when you find it, you will know. You will know, because this love will not just see you‚Äîit will cherish you.",6,1741402435.0,letters,2,0.88,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I‚Äôm a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I‚Äôm an introvert with a resting ‚Äúwhy so serious?‚Äù face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).¬†¬†

Here‚Äôs the deal: I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I‚Äôm looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can‚Äôt stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I‚Äôm open to seeing where it goes‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.¬†¬†

A bit about me:¬†¬†

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and SZA are on repeat. If you‚Äôre into music that hits the soul, we‚Äôll get along.¬†¬†
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I‚Äôm into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it‚Äôs my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.¬†¬†
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.¬†¬†
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we‚Äôre golden.¬†¬†
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you‚Äôre into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.¬†¬†

### What I‚Äôm looking for:¬†¬†
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who‚Äôs okay with my occasional shutdowns (I‚Äôm working on it, I promise).¬†¬†
- Someone who‚Äôs passionate about *something*‚Äîart, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.¬†¬†
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.¬†¬†
- Bonus if you‚Äôre a football fan or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.¬†¬†

I‚Äôm not here to rush into anything. Let‚Äôs start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let‚Äôs figure this life thing out together.¬†¬†

P.S. If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a ‚Äúhi‚Äù if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. üòä

Whether you're just starting out or looking to boost your client base, there are plenty of low-cost or free massage advertising and marketing strategies you can use to attract new clients and grow your business.

In this post, I‚Äôm sharing 10 tried-and-true promotion methods that cost little to nothing but can have a big impact on your business. I‚Äôm also currently using these strategies to grow my house call massage business, so you‚Äôre getting real, practical advice that works!

# 1. Use Business Cards & Printed Marketing Materials

A simple yet effective old-school marketing method is to have business cards and rack cards that you can distribute strategically. Hand them out wherever you go‚Äîrestaurants, coffee shops, gyms, and any other places your ideal clients frequent.

üí° Pro Tip: When ordering printed materials from services like Vistaprint, sign up, then wait for a 40% off coupon to save money!

# 2. Tap into Your Personal Network

Your personal contacts can be a goldmine for referrals! Reach out to friends, family, former clients, and even social media contacts. Let them know you're accepting new clients and encourage them to spread the word.

**How to do it:**  
\- Send friendly, no-pressure messages letting people know about your services.  
\- Post about your business on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn to remind your network that you're available.

**Here's a sample script to h**elp you get started:

*""I hope you're doing well! I just wanted to reach out and share some exciting news‚ÄîI'm currently \[starting/rebuilding/growing\] my massage business, and I'm looking to connect with more people who could benefit from my services.*

*If you or anyone you know could use a relaxing or therapeutic massage, I‚Äôd love the opportunity to help. No pressure at all, but if you happen to think of someone who might be interested, I‚Äôd truly appreciate you passing along my info. üòä*

*I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions or chat if you‚Äôre interested. Hope to catch up soon!""*

# 3. Claim Your Free Business Listings

Take advantage of free online directories like:  
‚úÖ Google My Business (a must-have for local SEO!)  
‚úÖ Facebook Business Page  
‚úÖ LinkedIn Business Profile  
‚úÖ Local business directories like Yelp, Alignable and Nextdoor

These listings help potential clients find you and improve your visibility in local searches.

# 4. Create a Basic Website

Even a simple, one-page website can make a huge difference! It builds credibility and gives potential clients an easy way to learn about your services and book appointments.

Affordable website options:  
üíª Many professional massage organizations offer free website templates.  
üåê Some platforms, like Google Sites or Wix, have free plans that work well for basic needs.

# 5. Leverage Social Media (Without Overwhelm)

You don‚Äôt have to post daily or spend hours online, but you should keep your social profiles active and up to date.

Simple strategy:  
üìÖ Post 1-3 times per week with a mix of educational, promotional, and behind-the-scenes content.  
üîó Share customer testimonials, massage benefits, or special offers.  
üèòÔ∏è Post in local Facebook groups where people ask for service recommendations!

# 6. Volunteer & Get Involved Locally

Giving free chair massages at community events, teacher appreciation days, or health fairs can introduce you to new clients!

Find local opportunities by:  
üìÖ Checking your Chamber of Commerce website for upcoming events.  
üè´ Connecting with schools, fitness studios, and businesses that may host wellness days.  
üö¥ Attending races, triathlons, or athletic events where massage is in demand!

# 7. Optimize Your Google Business Profile

Your Google Business Profile is one of the most powerful free marketing tools. Make sure to:  
‚úÖ Fill in all details completely (hours, services, contact info).  
‚úÖ Post updates and special offers monthly.  
‚úÖ Encourage clients to leave Google reviews‚Äîthis boosts your ranking!

# 8. Attend Local Networking Events

Networking can lead to powerful referrals! Many local business groups offer free or low-cost events. Even if you're not a Chamber of Commerce member, many networking events are open to non-members for a small fee.

üè¢ Search for local business meetups, women‚Äôs networking groups, or wellness industry mixers.

üí° Pro Tip: Introduce yourself with a simple, confident elevator pitch about your services.

Here's a sample script to help you get started:

Hi, I‚Äôm \[Your Name\], a professional massage therapist specializing in \[your specialty, e.g., deep tissue, relaxation, sports massage\]. I help people \[benefit statement, e.g., reduce stress, relieve pain, improve mobility\] through customized massage sessions.

I recently started \[or am growing\] my practice in \[your location\], and I‚Äôm always looking to connect with people who could benefit from quality, professional massage. If you or someone you know is looking for relaxation or pain relief, I‚Äôd love to help!

# 9. Reach Out to Local Businesses (Cold Calling Works!)

Cold calling or visiting businesses in person can feel intimidating, but it works!

üìû Who to contact: Hotels, B&Bs, chiropractors, gyms, salons, yoga studios‚Äîanywhere your ideal clients might be!

üè® Example: Call B&B's or Air BNB managers and ask, ‚ÄúDo you have a preferred massage therapist for guests? I‚Äôd love to introduce myself and drop off some business cards.‚Äù

Even if you get many rejections, one ‚Äòyes‚Äô can lead to a steady flow of new clients!

# 10. Network with Other Massage Therapists

Building relationships with fellow therapists can open doors for referrals, mentorship, and even client trades.

ü§ù Start a monthly coffee meetup with local massage therapists.  
üîÑ Offer to trade services‚Äîthis builds trust and potential business collaborations.

The fire was reduced to a smoldering heap. His horse‚Äìeyes illuminated by the last embers‚Äìgazed past the bend that concealed the cave exit.

‚ÄúWhat is it, Nobu?‚Äù Augustus asked, placing a hand on his coal-coated stead.

Rather than answer, Nobu held his stare. Watching him, a thought struck Augustus; one he came to realize many times over the last five years. His horse wasn‚Äôt like other animals. When faced with the unknown, most animals give in to fear or intrigue. Nobu embraced both, approaching situations like a human. It was that balance between curiosity and caution that had saved Augustus many times.

Augustus grumbled to his feet, rubbing the sleep off his eyes and shaking the soreness out of his legs. He was no stranger to hard travel, but eleven days without seeing a bed or a soul was pushing it, even for him. His back groaned at the thought of the days still ahead. All this for a face he could barely recall.

It was ironic that he spent more time thinking of Aki since they split than when they were together. Every morning, Augustus would sit with his coffee, put himself in the man‚Äôs mind, and plan his routes accordingly. Every town he reached, he‚Äôd scan the papers‚Äîhalf terrified, half hopeful‚Äìsearching for some sign. When he felt tired, Aki shook him. When it hurt, Aki numbed him. When he wanted to give up, Aki picked him back up.

And yet, his old master‚Äôs face had faded to an outline. In his dreams, Aki told him stories with his deep, baritone voice. His coarse hands waved along as if playing conductor to the tale. In his nightmares, Aki's eyes-and only his eyes-glared at Augustus through the dark. It was that look from their final encounter. Sometimes, it scorched its way into Augustus' waking moments.

When Augustus turned the bend, he was greeted with the bitter cold. The wind tore fresh snow from the valley and stifled the night sky with curtains of white. The crescent moon shuffled from cloud to cloud, piercing the powder with a yellow haze. The haze dimly illuminated the surrounding mountain peaks‚Äìand the bear standing atop one.",1,1741401238.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I had to stop my first attempt with IF last year due to getting debilitating headaches.  I do get headaches fairly often anyway and am on medication to reduce migraine headaches.  But the headaches I get while intermittent fasting are different and persistent.

The only thing that changes with my eating pattern when intermittent fasting is I finish eating earlier in the evening.  I always start eating early afternoon, having black coffee and water until then.  But instead of snacking half the night I stop all eating after the 8 hour window.  While getting into the routine of only eating during the window I don't consciously change anything else about what I am eating.  The idea being that once I am in a routine of not eating late at night I can focus on what I am eating instead of when.  So I don't think that it's a case of withdrawal headaches from sugar or whatever. 

I've tried google, and the only advise that I get is to eat regularly, small meals, hydrate.  Which isn't super helpful at all.",3,1741400821.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.81,False

I haven't been one to ever fit in a trend. At times, I get really sick of them. There's something about hearing ""I love that for you!"" that ends up feeling stale. Often I think people are saying it to have a response that doesn't kill the the conversation. It's not a full opinion but it sounds like one that's not offensive so long as no one is using it sarcastically.

I labeled myself a snob, even been told I'm contrarian but I wonder now if it's because I feel oversaturated by social trends. I find myself looking for music that doesn't sound like everything else that's mainstream but it's not because I always feel that the music major pop artists are putting out is ""bad."" There's some really good stuff but it's harder to jump into new pop music when at first hearing it sounds a lot like what everyone else is putting out. What's trending now is the the club, grocery store, bookshop, coffee shop, radio. It's a lot. Especially if it's not what I'm into at the moment.

I love Beyonce for a ton of reasons. One of them is that I don't think she sounds like any other artist. 

Yet. I sorta skipped the David Guetta era of EDM. I can go back now and remember Titanium in a billion places I've heard it, miss those memories and like the song.

I don't hate the music because it's trendy. I just can't get into it trendy music immediately.

I'm speculating people think I might like 2000s music because I'm stuck in the past, it was my heyday. But I wasn't aware of a lot of stuff back in ""my time.""

Anyone else?

I also find it fun to come into artists late because it means i get whole catalogues to dive into. Late is sometimes awesome. But also that artist will dominate my listening for months at a time so I lose track of trends.

Ever been starving at 2 AM, scrolling through Zomato, realizing everything‚Äôs closed, and questioning your life choices? Same. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm thinking of starting a late-night food stall/kiosk serving chai, coffee, parathas, kulchas, Maggi, and other soul-saving snacks for all the night owls, insomniacs, drunk philosophers, and overworked students out there. But before I take the plunge, I need to know if this is a genius idea or just my hunger messing with me.

Tell me honestly:

1. Do you actually go out looking for food at night, or do you just accept your fate and sleep hungry?


2. What‚Äôs your ultimate late-night craving? (Be real, I won‚Äôt judge‚Ä¶)


3. Where should I set this up? (Golden Temple area, Ranjit Avenue, Railway Station, some shady alley where deals and meals both happen?)


4. Would you prefer a small sit-down setup or just a quick takeaway stall?


5. What timings would actually work? (10 PM - 4 AM? 24/7? )


6. What‚Äôs the max amount you‚Äôd pay for a proper late-night meal? (Because I‚Äôm not opening a five-star hotel, but I also don‚Äôt wanna go bankrupt.)


7. What‚Äôs your preferred drink? (Tandoori Chai, Masala Chai, Cold Coffee, some secret drink that only real Amritsaris know about?)


8. Besides parathas and Maggi, what else should be on the menu? 

9. Do you prefer home-style food or greasy street food that could kill you but is worth it?


10. Should the stall have a chill vibe with music, or just a basic ‚Äúeat-and-run‚Äù setup?


11. What‚Äôs the most annoying thing about finding food at night in Amritsar? 

12. Any name ideas for the stall? (Best name gets free chai when I open.)



Give me your brutally honest opinions. If enough of you are into this, we might finally have a proper place to kill those midnight cravings in Amritsar without resorting to stale biscuits and regret.

1j66vd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1j66vd6/hunger_causing_bad_flare_up/,Hunger causing bad flare up???,"
Hi there! I have GERD and am currently experiencing: nausea, acid reflux, sore throat (that feels like I need to hiccup?), chills (thinking from anxiety AND our heat was off), burning in stomach-- on top of that, I feel hungry, but the nausea is making me worried about trying to eat. 

Does anyone else experience these things?? I'm a little worried only because of the nausea- but because I'm hungry is that making me feel like this?? Is it triggering my GERD? 

Earlier today I ate waffles, veggie nests, and mac n cheese puffs-- and coffee! My last meal was 6 hours ago!

EDIT: I have pretty bad emetophobia that I'm working hard on getting better with!! But the nausea part of this really gets me anxious haha",3,1741400313.0,GERD,5,1.0,False

I am feeling better and better, and I think it‚Äôs likely because of my sleep quality improving. I seriously couldn‚Äôt remember the last time I‚Äôd slept well in a really long time, so I decided to quit coffee. 

I‚Äôve been having night terrors consistently, meaning I think a shadow is some intruder and scream and then wake up. My boyfriend says I haven‚Äôt had them for this last week (and maybe longer I didn‚Äôt ask until now). 

I also have (voluntary) tics, so hopefully they continue to lessen because so far I‚Äôve noticed a decrease in the urgency to do the tics (clench my jaw, squeeze and contract muscles all over my body). There is no way the decrease in the feeling of urgency to do the tics is placebo. 

I was close to getting a sleep study done, but I don‚Äôt think I will if these symptoms (tics, depression, night terrors, non-restful sleep) continue to improve ",5,1741400040.0,decaf,2,1.0,False
1j66rys,https://www.reddit.com/r/estatesales/comments/1j66rys/ever_ran_into_a_really_bad_apple/,Ever ran into a really bad apple?,"I wish I was making this up.

Some people view estate sales as if they are the last estate sale ever held, and get way too competitive. Personally, I try to avoid confrontation. 

I waited a little over 2 hours for a number, this older lady who looked like she had a history of hard drug usage and her daughter, literally walk right in front of me to get a number. This made me a bit peeved, but being off a number or two isn't the end of the world.

Hour between numbers and the sale, so I go to a nearby gas station to get some coffee. One restroom was in use and I really needed to go. I wait 10 minutes and apparently they had fallen asleep in there, so I tell the cashier and the other restroom, which was out of order, the nano-second she takes the sign off the door, (I guess they fixed it and forgot to take the sign down) the same lady comes out of nowhere and walks right in front of me to use the damn bathroom. 

I go in after her, the sink was bone dry, the toilet wasn't filling back up - meaning she was probably in there using.

Go inside the sale once it opens, and her and her daughter are literally filling tote bags full of jewelry. When  There's probably 10 or so flats of jewelry and smalls. 

They see me, and start going through a flat, but the way the house was situated, I would need to wait for them to move to go further down the living room and look at more stuff. 

I watch as they literally go through this same flat 5 times. There's maybe 8 pieces of jewelry in this flat. 

So after watching them pick up these 8 items, look at them, and sit them down down five times, I realize they are purposely being in my way. 

However, they finally start sauntering further down maybe a foot, and once I was closer, I see one piece of jewelry that looked decent, and right as they start moving down again, I reach in the flat to pick it up, and she starts reaching for it, stops, and the daughter sees this and starts getting huffy with me, accusing me of ""taking something out of her mom's hand"". I told her I don't pull that shit and literally sat it back down in the flat, and she says ""Ya whatever buddy"" and rolls her eyes.

I have no clue what their damn issue was, but these are the types of people I hate seeing at sales. 

They know I know jewelry and since that's their ""niche"", they want to act like assholes to try and have me retaliate and get me kicked out. 

I can see right through their BS and I'll act like Mr Rogers to their face, and I could tell their little ""trap"" of trying to get me pissed off at them, made them even more mad when they realized I'm not falling for that shit.
