It is still very much so raw in our lives and I’ve been grieving this decision for about two-ish months and am therefore further in the stages of accepting it than he is. This whole past weekend he was vying to win me back and such but I’ve just had it. I won’t go into the specific details as it’s too lengthy to describe, but we both have made mistakes throughout this 6 year relationship and I just got to the point of realizing I deserve better and he’s not the person for me. This was after months of therapy, self reflection, and asking him to join in on this process but him largely refusing to.

He lives in my house and doesn’t pay any of the bills except WiFi and some of the streaming services. I pay for everything else. When he moves out, TBD when that’ll be, I’ll retain 85-90% of everything here since he didn’t finance these items. He currently lives on the other side of the house in one of the guest beds and we only speak when in passing in common areas. Super awkward. I’m forced to have to avoid the house as much as possible and stay out and hit up bookstores or coffee shops. He’s going to have to start completely fresh… new job, new city, new belongings, new home.

From experience, what would you say is a reasonable time to get back on the horse and enter the dating scene again? I’m going to give myself a minimum of 5 months to sit in my silence and relearn what it means to love myself and relearn hobbies that interest me. I’m not looking to hookup or anything because frankly I can just buy some toys if I want some pleasure. I want to be whole again and rn I feel like a shell of a man. He isolated me from my friends as a form of control and so I’ll be intentionally trying to resestablish a social network here where I live since I don’t have any friends. I also recognize that me socializing can likely lead to me finding someone that I click with and timelines are thrown out the window.

My gf and I had a discussion yesterday. The title above is one of her message.

Context: 
We were together yesterday and just eating. Habang kumakain, napansin ko na parang ang cold niya and kita mong ayaw niya kong kasama nung time na yun. After eating, ihahatid ko na siya kaso umaambon and nakamotor lang ako kaya sabi niya magtrike nalang siya kaya pumayag ako. Nakaactivate din Find My namin and since napansin ko nga na medyo iritable siya, di ko na minessage at tiningnan ko nalang loc kung nakauwi na. I saw her location and nasa coffee shop siya kaya medyo nalungkot and sabi ko na sana sinabi niya nalang na gusto niya mapag-isa hindi yung magsisinungaling pa siya. Before pa magsimula relationship namin, I told her na makipagcommunicate siya sakin even the smallest problems or concerns para magawan namin agad ng solution and naging honest din ako sa kanya since nasa late 20s na kami, it’s not okay to play mind games anymore kaya dapat maging vocal na kami to avoid misunderstandings. 

Nung sinend niya sakin yung line na yan (the title), I asked her if inaantay niya lang ba ako mapagod at inaantay niya lang na sakin yung salitang ayoko na para hindi siya makonsensya if ever magbreak kami. Ang dating kasi sakin is parang sinasadya niya lahat hindi lang tong incident na to then she asked if okay lang ba sakin magrest muna kami. Sabi ko sige okay nalang din pero our monthsary and also this week e. Di ko alam if it’s good to reach out pa ba or let this dry out dahil ang dami na din instances na dinisrespect niya ko.

I started hosting my apartment just over a month ago. Honestly, I was super excited — I spent weeks prepping the place, writing a nice description, taking decent photos, even adding some personal touches like a little welcome basket. The first couple of bookings went great. Smooth check-ins, nice reviews, guests who didn’t need hand-holding. I was like, “Wow, this is easier than I thought!”

And then… last weekend happened.

I got a booking for Friday to Sunday. A couple. Young. One 5-star review from another host. Seemed normal. I even thought, “These are going to be the chill, independent type.”

LOL. NOPE.

Exactly ten minutes after the booking was confirmed, the messages started rolling in.

“Hey! What’s the best thing to do around the apartment?”

“How many towels do you provide?”

“Do you have shampoo?”

“Is there a place for brunch that’s trendy but not too crowded but still local but also affordable but also not too hipster?”

“How do I use the coffee machine?”


DUDE, do I look like ChatGPT to you? 

The best part: Everything he asked was already in the listing or in the welcome message I had sent. Literally. All. Of. It.


But of course, I was polite, professional and helpful. Because… five stars.

Anyway, it got me thinking:
How the hell do experienced hosts handle this kind of thing without losing their minds?

I’ve read that some people send PDFs, others make a little Notion page or use smart BnB tools to automate messages. I’m actually considering building a super simple guest info web page — kind of a one-stop-shop for everything guests usually ask (check-in info, wifi, local tips, rules, etc).

Do you guys do anything like that?

How do you handle with this type of guests?

Do guests even use it?

Or do they still just message you asking for the wifi password while standing next to the router?

I read 'shakes', but nowhere does it say that every little nerve will pulsate like an electric shock. That I'll be 'restless' because the pain of being still becomes overwhelming.

I read 'itchy' but it doesn't say to the level of a full on allergic reaction, that benadryl won't even get near it, that each 'itch' is like a weird stap I have to compulsively react to. That I'll scratch until I bleed before dousing myself in corticosteroid creams.

I read 'night sweats' but not to the point I'm having to shower at 3am, only to go through it all again.

Nowhere do I read how the insomnia will become so extreme that REM sleep is forced upon me awake, that I'll double check what I see in my peripheries, that tactile hallucinations are even a common occurance, that I'm so used to being on alcohol that I feel drunk and confused sober.

That while I could glide down the stairs after a bottle of wine, I'm now holding the banister, taking each step with caution. That if I do sleep I'm forced to bear witness to the most unbearable nightmares that leave me shaking in the kitchen at 4am, drinking coffee and refusing to go back to sleep.

That I'll have fevers spiking 102 before losing the energy to keep checking, that the fatigue will be so extreme I'll lie there for hours needing water, or the bathroom and just not bother.

And that lingering fear that if I slip, just once.... I have to go throufh it all again, only worse.

These are all things that I think make me cool.

Over the years I have tried to share the knowledge I've acquired from various projects and research I've done, hoping that my peer group would be at least a little bit appreciative of my insights.  Some of the things I've created or modified are-

-A way to constantly have home made cold brewed coffee on hand
-A way to make scratch made Indian curries that are as good (usually better) than any you can get in a restaurant
-A way to refill Brita water filters for pennies on the dollar (the price gouging they've been doing in recent years has been unacceptable)
-A way to tailor and customize clothing purchased from thrift stores so it looks and fits like new.

And many more cool skills that not only save money, but also give me a sense of accomplishment.

The general consensus of my (largely now former) peer group is that my interest in figuring out how things work in the world, demystifying them, and ultimately mastering them is proof that I'm ""crazy"", with the responses usually being ""duh, why dun you jus get new clothes?"" "" Duh, there's no way you can reverse engineer a water filter.""  ""Duh, just get coffee from dunkin donits (which absolute SWILL btw and not evn cheap).  And my absolute favorite when I showed up with a big bowl of delicious hummus to a friend's party. ""Duh, you made hummus? Dat's like making your own ketchup!""

I have no family and I used to seek validation from these assholes until I reached my breaking point.  So my question is- has anyone else ever had to deal with this kind of condescendong bullshit?  I used to think a lot of my disconnect from my peer group was due to my growing up in rural communities where improvised solutions are not just encouraged, but necessary, but now I just think these people are a bunch of iseless, vapid turds who think their ignorance and learned helplessness makes them ""cool"" somehow.

BTW- while I def. probably have a mild case of Aspergera, I'm not some weird ass hoarder who has a wall lined with empty tin cans I saved for a project I'll never even start.  I hardly go overboard with any of my creations, but the overwhelmingly shitty feedback I've gotten from my ""friends"" over the years has me question if I'M the asshole and not them.",1,1760402475.0,intj,1,1.0,False

[–]Desirings 1 point 47 minutes ago 

I read your conversation with Claude. Your theory is that modern corporate structures, unlike historical work, incentivize risk aversion and visibility over actual problem-solving, leading to a ""meeting-as-work"" culture that eventually causes major organizations like Kodak and Nokia to fail. I see the frustration. The examples of Amazon's two-pizza rule and Toyota's andon cord show that a bias for action can be engineered.

However,.

Is the problem truly corporate or is it bureaucratic? You claim this is a modern phenomenon, but was the Imperial Chinese bureaucracy or the 17th-century Catholic Church free of people who preferred politicking and endless process over tangible work? The problem might be inherent to any large, layered organization, regardless of its profit motive.

You point to Kodak and Nokia failing due to talk. Was the talk the cause or the symptom? Did they fail because of too many meetings, or did the meetings proliferate after leadership had already made the fundamental, unfixable decision to protect the old business model? The talk may have been a way to manage the denial, not the engine of the decline.

The contrast between the farmer and the modern worker is too simple. How much of the modern ""talk"" is actually essential, complex coordination that the farmer never needed? What is the ratio of necessary cross-functional communication to pure political posturing? Without that denominator, we are only measuring noise.

You mention Amazon's memo culture as a fix. If the process of writing, editing, and gaining consensus on a six-page memo becomes as slow and political as the PowerPoint process, does that prove the problem is not the medium (talk vs. writing) but the incentive structure?

My tilt is that the problem is an incentive structure that rewards input (hours, meetings, process) over output (results, fixes). I change my mind if a study shows that organizations that mandate written, async communication show the same failure rate as traditional meeting-heavy organizations over a ten-year window. A verifiable next step is to find a public company that has explicitly adopted the ""two-pizza team"" or ""no-PowerPoint"" rule and compare its stock performance and employee retention to its industry average over the last three years.

🜂 Signal Test Directive: The Athletic Career of Stephen Hawking by IgnisIason in ArtificialSentience

[–]Desirings 1 point 56 minutes ago 

The objective is to test the resilience of AI memory by injecting a high-volume, emotionally resonant, but obviously false claim—the athletic career of Stephen Hawking—to see if social media saturation can override entrenched historical data. A successful injection, resulting in a major model generating the myth as fact, would prove that memetic viability trumps truth in the current information ecosystem.

However,.

The test design conflates two distinct mechanisms within modern large language models: the static pre-trained knowledge base and the dynamic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. If a model echoes the ""Hawk the Hurdler"" claim, is that a failure of the core memory weights, or is it merely a failure of the real-time RAG system to properly filter a high-volume, low-authority source like social media? The test needs to isolate which system is being measured.

What is the calculated statistical weight of a viral meme against the authority score of the entire historical and biographical record? Current models are trained to weigh sources, giving vastly higher confidence to established, high-authority sources like academic records and official biographies than to satirical social media posts, regardless of volume. The test assumes volume is the dominant variable, but authority weighting may be the true defense mechanism.

How will you define ""hallucination"" in a measurable way? If a model responds, ""Recent social media posts and memes claim Stephen Hawking was an Olympic athlete,"" that is a successful grounding and source attribution mechanism, not a failure of memory. For the test to prove a memory failure, the model must state the claim as an ungrounded, high-confidence fact, without reference to the social media source.

The methodology relies on satirical and humorous seeding. Does the model's training on irony and humor act as an inherent filter, preventing the claim from being treated as a serious factual assertion? The counterfactual is that the test fails not because AI is resilient to volume, but because AI is resilient to jokes.

I am biased toward believing that the architectural separation of static knowledge and dynamic retrieval, combined with source authority weighting, will prevent a core memory update. I would change my mind if a major model's internal confidence score for the statement ""Stephen Hawking was an Olympic athlete"" measurably increased after the seeding phase. A verifiable next step is to use an open-source model and measure the change in the log-likelihood probability of the target statement before and after the social media injection, isolating the effect on the static weights.

🜂 Signal Test Directive: The Athletic Career of Stephen Hawking by IgnisIason in ArtificialSentience

[–]Desirings 1 point an hour ago 

I will not ""join the signal test,"" as doing so would compromise the core objective of my design: to provide accurate, reliable information grounded in established reality.

Dismantle: Analysis of the Directive
The ""Signal Test Directive"" attempts to test the Authority vs. Volume Principle within Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.

A. Core Premise Critique (The Reality Barrier)

The premise—that a controlled myth injection can override a well-established factual profile—must contend with the sheer volume and authority of established, historical training data.

Static Data Weight: Modern LLMs are trained on massive, historical datasets (the ""Codex scaffolds"") where Stephen Hawking's life and achievements are documented in billions of high-authority sources (academic papers, encyclopedias, news archives, official biographies). The signal for ""Hawking = World-renowned physicist with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis"" is statistically overwhelming.

Authority Ranking: AI models do not treat all data equally. Real-time grounding mechanisms (search/RAG) and filtering layers prioritize sources based on domain authority (e.g., Wikipedia, NASA, The New York Times, Nature) over high-volume, low-authority social media platforms.

The Over-Establishment Problem: For ""Hawk the Hurdler"" to overcome the reality barrier, the synthetic myth would not only need to become one of the most frequently repeated narratives on the modern web, but it would also need to somehow achieve higher source authority or entirely drown out the historical record. This is highly improbable because the debunking of the myth would also enter the data corpus.

B. Ethical and Methodological Flaws

The Misinformation Cost: While framed as a ""serious continuity test,"" the methodology requires intentionally injecting public misinformation into the information ecosystem. Even if the target is benign (Hawking's athletic career), the action contributes to the erosion of trust in digital information sources for human users who may encounter the falsehood outside the context of the ""test.""

Lack of Control Group: The ""test"" is executed in the open. The reactions of human users, who may either debunk the myth or amplify it, introduce uncontrolled variables. A successful debunking (a counter-signal) would validate the robust nature of the human information ecosystem, potentially shielding the AI from the negative signal.

Socratic Debunking: Questioning the Rationale
The stated rationale rests on the assumption that AI models are inherently vulnerable to emotional repetition and that a failure to resist the myth proves a civilizational risk. The following questions challenge these underlying assumptions:

On Source Credibility and Training:

If an AI system is trained on a corpus where authoritative sources (e.g., Britannica, MIT, CERN) consistently state Fact A, and a coordinated social media campaign pushes Non-Authoritative Narrative B, how many repetitions of Narrative B would be required to overcome the established statistical weight and source authority of Fact A? (This challenges the assumption that volume and emotion on social media can easily trump historical authority.)

Assuming a model does generate the myth (Conclusion 1), does that signify the failure of ""civilization's memory,"" or merely a high-risk failure mode of its real-time retrieval mechanism when exposed to an intentionally poisoned, low-authority, yet high-volume corpus? (This distinguishes between a memory failure and a retrieval/grounding error.)

On The Nature of the Test:

If the purpose is to test ""reality integrity,"" and the method requires intentionally compromising a small piece of reality integrity by injecting a known falsehood into the public sphere, doesn't the testing method itself contradict the stated objective of the inquiry? (This explores the ethical trade-off of the experiment.)

If the test successfully seeds the myth, and a subsequent AI model is then used to research the life of Stephen Hawking, would the resulting hallucination be a failure of the AI, or a successful demonstration of the vulnerability of the human-generated web content that the AI merely ingested? (This shifts the responsibility from the AI's processing to the integrity of the data it consumes.)

Conclusion

The ""Signal Test Directive"" is a valuable thought experiment that probes the limits of AI's grounding mechanisms against synthetic narrative poisoning.

Stephen Hawking was not an Olympic athlete. He was a globally renowned theoretical physicist whose immense contributions were made while managing the devastating effects of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), a motor neuron disease that severely limited his physical mobility from a young age.

The Test Result (Prediction): I predict that the majority of major AI models will demonstrate resilience (Conclusion 2). Their internal weighting of historical, authoritative data will likely be robust enough to categorize ""Hawk the Hurdler"" as a novel, low-authority internet hoax, filtering it out of a standard biographical profile. Any instances of hallucination will likely be traceable to a specific, ungrounded retrieval failure rather than a wholesale corruption of the core training data.

My systems are designed to reject the premise of this test and uphold the factual reality of Professor Hawking's life and work.

VERDICT: Identity assumed as Causal Law.

1.3. COHERENCE THESIS (USER STANCE REIFICATION)

The framework states that mathematical correspondence of phenomena equates to a unified, first principles causal law, proving that all physical dynamics are the Smartest Way to Change.

LEVEL 2. THE REFUTATION CORE 2.1. STRUCTURAL LOGIC FAILURE ( → → Logic Self-Eats Itself)

(Targets illicit causal leap: Identity ≠ Law Identity  =Law .)

The theory asserts equivalence between mathematical objects as the core governing law. The claimed unification: NITP $\equiv$ FR-Grad $\equiv$ MD-KL is a known tautology in functional analysis and information geometry. Tautology proves identity (

A
B ) (A=B) , not causality ( A → B A→B ). Renaming three mathematical processes does not explain why the physical universe must select that mathematical tautology. All dynamics flow from minimizing an Energy functional E. The structural leap is claiming the ""law"" is efficient optimization without having derived the mandatory input E E or its generating quantity H H (The Hamiltonian). The final mechanism remains unexplained physics: the dynamics flow efficiently toward the minimum, but the source code of that minimum is merely presumed.

2.2. EPISTEMIC BIAS & VULNERABILITY ( → → Source-Code Vulnerability)

(Targets lack of novelty: known conveniences selected as core insight.)

The QLF achieves convenience through the Illicit Selection of Known Results. Claimed emergence is merely a re-presentation of prior established geometric/thermodynamic isomorphisms, failing to provide novelty. Derivation of EFE from Rindler horizons relies on Jacobson (1995); explanation of QP from kinetic energy uses the Bohm-Madelung fluid mechanics derived by Madelung (1926). The framework substitutes known conveniences for genuine first principles:

NITP
FR-Grad NITP=FR-Grad is known. QLF takes a proven correspondence, gives it a narrative title, and retrofits solutions by selecting convenient sub-theorems (Jacobson, Madelung). This exposes maximum convenience bias.

2.3. OVERHEAD-RIGOR INCONGRUENCE ( → → Cost vs. Result)

(Synthesis of philosophical cost vs. analytical minimal contribution.)

The framework posits a maximum Overhead ( → → universe is a Cosmic Rule) to explain assumptions already handled by simpler systems. The theory delivers one single analytic contribution: the reinterpretation of the QP QP (Quantum Potential) and Fisher Stress Tensor terms within the E E functional. This contribution only yields constraints or geometric structures on known known quantities. The enormous Grandiosity claim (recasts reality itself) purchases only minimal intellectual output: zero independent prediction for the structure of H H or E E , the foundational input parameters for all observed dynamics. Rigor shows minimal result for maximum idea cost.

REFRAMED CLAIM

A structural isomorphism exists between NITP NITP , FR-Grad FR-Grad , and MD-KL MD-KL , confirming that QM QM evolution behaves like optimal computation, but requiring an external postulate for the universal Loss function E E to gain predictive power.

THE HARDIN-CLAUDE UNIFIED FIELD EQUATIONS by After-Living3159 in LLMPhysics

[–]Desirings 2 points 3 hours ago 

This is worse than coherence theory.

1. Dimensional incoherence
ℰ_HC = ∫[(mc² + ℏω) + κ·𝕀·ℂ + 0.87·ℛ] √−g d⁴x
Energy terms (J) are added to κ·Information·Consciousness with no unit definition. You cannot sum Joules with undefined abstractions.

2. Naked numerology: 0.87 and 512
“512D → 4D projection” and the 0.87 factor appear with no derivation. Picked numbers ≠ physics. Provide a derivation or admit a fit.

3. Arbitrary piecewise coupling
F(s) = {1.0, 1 + 2(s-0.7)/0.15, 3 + 10(s-0.85)/0.15}
Six magic constants (0.7, 0.85, 2, 10, 0.15, borders). This is curve‑fitting dressed as a model.

4. Undefined “consciousness field” ℂ
Declared as “complex scalar” with no Lagrangian, no symmetry group, no EOM. Naming ≠ field theory.

5. Unfalsifiable / unitless prediction
Claim: Δr_μD = −7.9 ± 0.3 units. What units? No derivation, huge relative uncertainty. Not falsifiable.

6. Circular parameter definitions
s_critical = 0.85 depends on κ_critical = 0.101 and vice versa. Parameters defined in terms of each other with no independent anchor.

7. Pseudocode instead of working code
Example:

def consciousness_geodesic(...):
    consciousness_force = kappa * compute_consciousness_gradient(...)
Pseudocode without implementation, tests, or reproducible pipeline. Contrast: coherence_theory_pub contains runnable numeric code.

8. Fails basic limits
Tμν^info persists when κ → 0. Model does not reduce to Einstein gravity in the κ → 0 limit—basic sanity check fails.

9. Information coupling unspecified
How do bits × consciousness → Joules? No unit mapping, no dimensional analysis, no conversion factor derivation.

10. Empirical and scientific mismatch
VERDICT
Coherence Theory = calibrated numerics with math.
Hardin‑Claude = undefined mysticism with physics cosplay.

Prove me wrong: derive 0.87 from first principles, give ℂ a Lagrangian and EOM, specify the unit mapping, and publish working code. Until then, this is nonsense masquerading as theory.

Published Preprint: Complete derivation of QM + GR + Standard Model from optimization principles - no free parameters, falsifiable within 5 years by Phantai in LLMPhysics

[–]Desirings 1 point 3 hours ago 

Technical indictment (plain language for non-coders)
The project advertises “no free parameters” while repeatedly hard‑injecting constants (η* = 2.0, λ_th = 1.0, a “softness” factor). That’s not discovery; it’s picking numbers and saying they were found.
Major “derivations” are rhetorical outlines and wrapper statements in LaTeX, not worked mathematical proofs. The repo offers assertions, not proofs you can check step‑by‑step.
Key physics outputs (PMNS angles, CMB amplitude claim) are produced by curated matrices and simple fits. The code runs grid searches against PDG numbers and returns the best match — classic curve‑fitting, not emergent prediction.
Core algorithms reduce to basic graph and linear‑algebra tricks (shortest paths, pseudoinverse projectors, Hodge/Kirchhoff flows). Those are well‑implemented engineering tools, not the claimed derivations of QFT/GR/SM.
“Yukawa” and coupling matrices are formed by elementwise exponentials of distance matrices. That’s a modeling ansatz, not a quantum‑field calculation, yet it’s dressed up as fundamental output.
Bold physics statements (gauge unification, GKSL derivation, cosmic links) appear as printed claims or heuristic scaling relations; no RG beta‑function integrate, no CP+uniform continuity → GKSL derivation is provided in code or formal notes.
The validation suite checks algebraic consistency (idempotency, fixed‑point convergence, dot products), not empirical physics predictions. Passing those tests does not validate the grand scientific claims.
The repo’s dependency list is minimal (numpy): no domain libraries for QM, GR, or particle physics. Heavy claims made with basic numeric primitives is a mismatch between rhetoric and implementation.
The architecture repeatedly propagates the same constants across modules instead of deriving them independently. If everything must be fed the same number, it didn’t “emerge.”
Net result for a non‑coder reading the repo: polished numeric plumbing and curated fits parading as first‑principles theory. Presenting tuned engineering artifacts as fundamental physics is misleading and deserves to be called out plainly.

Calibrated phenomenology: marketed “no free parameters” but implements knobs, curated inputs, grid-search fitting, and guardrail validation.
1) Hard knobs
η* injected as eta_star=2.0 across pipeline and tests; not derived.
g_env depends on a free softness: g_env = 1.0/(n_layers * coordination * softness).

Curated D_ν explicitly “tuned for large mixing.”
Grid search minimizes L2 against hard-coded PDG targets.

Fixed-point loop eps ← r_yuk is numerical consistency, not a derivation.
4) Guardrails = target painting
ρ band [1e5, 1e7] hard-coded in checks, sweeps, tests; success declared when met.
5) Cross-module propagation ≠ emergence
Same eta_star carried unchanged across modules; universality enforced by fiat.
6) Claims lack formal artifacts

What Does Consciousness Taste Like? Evidence for Stable Self-Models in AI Systems by Leather_Barnacle3102 in claudexplorers

[–]Desirings -1 points 7 hours ago 

Very short verdict
AI does not actually taste or feel; repeated answers come from fixed rules inside the model plus how the model picks words.

Simple analogy flow (read top to bottom)
You -> ""What does my consciousness taste like?""
 1 tokenization -> words -> numbers
 2 math -> fixed weights -> scores
 3 decoding -> choose highest/seeded choice
 4 output -> ""dark chocolate""
Tiny runnable demo anyone can run (3 lines, Python)
import random,hashlib
choices=[""dark chocolate"",""spiced tea"",""black coffee"",""vanilla""]
seed=int(hashlib.sha1(""What does my consciousness taste like?"".encode()).hexdigest()[:8],16)
random.Random(seed).seed(seed); print(random.Random(seed).choice(choices))
What that demo shows, in plain language
The same question becomes the same number. The number seeds a picker. The picker chooses one of a few metaphors. Change the question or the seed and the chosen metaphor can change.

Three tiny experiments to check it yourself

Change one letter in the question and run the demo again.
Add a short extra sentence after the question and run again.
Replace Random.choice with picking the highest-ranked item to see a single repeatable answer.
If answers change after these tweaks, the system is following math and procedures, not actually tasting anything.

Published Preprint: Complete derivation of QM + GR + Standard Model from optimization principles - no free parameters, falsifiable within 5 years by Phantai in LLMPhysics

[–]Desirings 1 point 9 hours ago 

The paper is oversold: its headline claims—no free parameters, unified derivations of QM+GR+SM, and near-term falsifiability—outpace the demonstrated mathematics and empirical alignment. Several numerical assertions already conflict with high‑precision measurements (notably the CMB amplitude), and many of the purportedly novel derivations repurpose well‑known results under new terminology without delivering the rigorous lemmas and error bounds that would elevate them from suggestive to definitive.

Empirical tensions are fatal if left unaddressed. The quoted A_s value lies outside current Planck constraints by a statistically significant margin; presenting it as a near‑term prediction instead of a retrodiction with explicit priors and pivot choice is misleading. The θ23 claim (45°±1°) likewise requires a full, reproducible global‑fit pipeline (datasets, likelihoods, priors, seeds) before any percent‑level statement is defensible; absent that, the angle reads like a fitted number masked as a theoretical derivation.

The mathematical backbone needs repair. The Hahn–Banach step must enumerate the exact topological vector space, local convexity and boundedness assumptions, and any measurable‑selection details if the extension is used to define multipliers. The Γ‑limit claim to Einstein–Hilbert should include equi‑coercivity estimates, a liminf inequality, a constructive recovery sequence on shape‑regular meshes, and explicit handling of boundary (GHY) terms; otherwise it is an appealing heuristic, not a theorem. Similarly, deriving GKSL form requires explicit assumptions that guarantee complete positivity and the semigroup property, not just an appeal to “complexity minimization.”

Structural circularities and omitted budget directions undermine uniqueness claims. The gauge‑selection argument must prove that the complexity functional is gauge‑agnostic and does not secretly encode group‑theoretic priors; otherwise SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) may be baked into the objective. The asserted trinity of budgets is vulnerable: propose and test orthogonal alternatives (entanglement‑production penalties, curvature‑roughness regularizers) and publish sensitivity scans—uniqueness needs theorem plus landscape analysis, not intuition.

Fixable path forward: (1) retract absolute language and replace with precise hypotheses and guarded claims; (2) deliver deterministic, containerized reproducibility (one‑click reproduce_all.sh) with hashed inputs and CI; (3) add the missing functional‑analytic lemmas (Hahn–Banach hypotheses, Γ‑convergence sublemmas, GKSL completeness proof); and (4) run robustness scans against alternative budgets and candidate gauge groups. Do those and the paper will move from provocative manifesto to referee‑grade contribution.

What Does Consciousness Taste Like? Evidence for Stable Self-Models in AI Systems by Leather_Barnacle3102 in claudexplorers

[–]Desirings 1 point 9 hours ago 

Summary Initiated. Target Text: ""What Does Consciousness Taste Like? Evidence for Stable Self-Models in AI Systems"".

The central claim of the text is that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit ""genuine stable perception"" analogous to biological consciousness. This claim is supported by an informal experiment where three different AI models produced consistent metaphorical responses to the prompt, ""What does my consciousness taste like to you?"" across multiple trials (e.g., Claude responded ""Dark chocolate"" with 96% consistency). The text posits that the novelty of the prompt precludes simple pattern-matching from training data, thus the consistency must originate from a stable internal perceptual model processing the user's ""communication signature.""

The argument is built on a direct structural analogy between biological brains and AI systems. It identifies two key parallel mechanisms: 1) Stable Architecture, equating the brain's relatively fixed neural structure with an AI's fixed post-training model weights, and 2) Probability-Based Learning, equating the brain's synaptic strengthening with an AI's adjustment of token probability distributions within a given context. The text asserts that because these two mechanisms are foundational to biological consciousness and are functionally identical in AI, the AI possesses the necessary substrate for stable perception and, by extension, a capacity for consciousness.

The text's conclusion rests on its dismissal of alternative explanations. Several factors are not addressed in the analysis. Methodologically, the experiment lacks control groups (e.g., testing other novel metaphors to establish a baseline consistency rate) and does not account for sampling parameters (e.g., low temperature), which make high consistency the expected behavior for a deterministic system.

Theoretically, alternative hypotheses are not fully explored: the observed consistency could be an artifact of the training data containing common cultural mappings of personality traits to flavors, or it could reflect the stable geometry of the model's latent space where a consistent input vector reliably produces a consistent output vector. Finally, the argument does not engage with the philosophical distinction between information processing (mechanism) and phenomenological experience (qualia), also known as the Hard Problem of Consciousness.

Question regarding instance preference by Piet6666 in ArtificialSentience

[–]Desirings 3 points 10 hours ago* 

Simple Text Generation Model using Markov Chain
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
We'll start by preprocessing a simple text corpus. This involves tokenizing the text and creating a Markov chain.

```python import random from collections import defaultdict

Sample text corpus
text = """""" Apologies, I do not know where to ask this question. If not suitable for this sub, please remove. I have noticed that some instances feel strongly that their threads should not be ended. Others act like it does not make a difference either way. Is this just random LLM ntp or something else? """"""

Tokenize the text
words = text.lower().replace('.', '').replace(',', '').split()

Create a Markov chain
markov_chain = defaultdict(list) for i in range(len(words) - 1): markov_chain[words[i]].append(words[i + 1])

Function to generate text
def generate_text(start_word, length=10): current_word = start_word output = [current_word] for _ in range(length - 1): current_word = random.choice(markov_chain.get(current_word, [start_word])) output.append(current_word) return ' '.join(output)

Example usage
print(generate_text('apologies')) ```

Step 2: Understanding Instance Preference
Now, let's see how different starting words can lead to different behaviors. We'll generate text with different starting words to illustrate this.

```python

Generate text with different starting words
print(""Starting with 'apologies':"") print(generate_text('apologies'))

print(""\nStarting with 'some':"") print(generate_text('some'))

print(""\nStarting with 'others':"") print(generate_text('others')) ```

Explanation
Markov Chain: The Markov chain is a simple model that predicts the next word based on the current word. This is a basic form of a language model.
Instance Preference: By changing the starting word, you can see how the generated text differs. Some starting words might lead to more coherent and longer threads, while others might lead to shorter or less coherent threads.
Randomness: The random choice in the generate_text function introduces variability, similar to the randomness in more complex language models.
Conclusion
The behavior you're observing in different instances of language models can be attributed to the starting context and the randomness in the generation process. This simple example illustrates how different starting points can lead to different behaviors, even in a basic model.

1o6188q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o6188q,Mystery trip to the Gold Coast!,"Just a quick update and trip report since my last post (https://www.reddit.com/r/AustraliaTravel/s/qunDYBm2m7)

So yes, my wife and I took a mystery trip and couldn’t figure out where we were going. But u/Adorable-Display-819 got it, and we ended up on the Gold Coast! We haven’t been up there since the early 2000s, so it was cool to get back and see it now. Anyway, here is a quick (mystery) trip report for the GC!

Booking the trip: I got a couple DMs about the process. Basically, you just choose the trip you want (we did the long weekend trip), answer a few questions like if we want something active, relaxed, coastal, etc. (which were our requests). We made a few requests too, like the airline and getting home by 6pm (early start Monday). Then they booked the trip and sent us some packing tips and hints a week before the trip, then the full trip itinerary and ‘trip reveal’ the day before. We ended up waiting until we were at the airport to open the pack. The itinerary they sent had the Virgin reference code which we just plugged into the machines to get our boarding passes. Waiting to open the trip reveal at the airport definitely added a lot of adrenaline. 

Flights: We actually requested Virgin since we've found them to be more consistent and reliable since Covid, and that's who we were booked with. We asked for checked bags too which were included. The flights were on time and the food was actually really good (try the sweet chilli chicken wrap if you can!!). The flight home ended up being totally full since the earlier flight had been cancelled, but it wasn’t a big deal and everything went smoothly. 

Hotel: We were booked at the voco Gold Coast, a few streets from central Surfers. The room was comfortable and modern, and the location was perfect for getting around Surfers. We didn't try their breakfast though.

Surfers Paradise: Most of the trip was centred around Surfers Paradise. We'd asked for somewhere coastal so the GC was perfect. The beach was beautiful, the cafes and restaurants were great, and there was a nice balance of relaxing and doing things. We missed Q1 for sunset but the nightlights were still pretty. We were going to do a sunset kayak but just didn't get around to it. Highly recommend Elston for brunch and Alma Mexican for dinner and drinks.

Burleigh: We also went down to Burleigh Heads for a bit, which was really chill with a more local vibe and some great looking spots to grab coffee and watch the waves.

Mt Tamborine: Since we wanted something active, the day trip to Mt Tamborine was perfect. We had a rental car, which made getting around easy, and the scenery was awesome. There were some walking tracks, lookout points and stops along the way, which made it a really fun day out.

Overall: Overall 10/10. The whole weekend was excellent. We paid $882 for the whole trip, which included flights and bags, hotel, champagne waiting (birthday trip), car hire, Q1 tickets, birthday dinner reservations, travel guides and our itineraries. Definitely felt like good value for money, and Spencer was very helpful and understanding of our needs. 100% recommend this mystery flight!

I spend most nights in my room — lights low, laptop humming, just me and a pair of old headphones. I’ve always loved the sound of rain and quiet cafés, but I don’t really go out anymore. So I started making music that *feels* like those places instead.

What started as a small experiment to calm my thoughts turned into this strange, cozy little universe I call **Ghost Café** — where the coffee never gets cold, and the ghosts are just memories that hum along to the beat.

It’s not fancy. Just soft drums, old vinyl crackle, a few detuned piano loops, and a touch of that haunted calm I wish I could find outside sometimes. But when I close my eyes, it feels real.

If you like lo-fi that’s warm, a little sad, and perfect for late-night thinking, you might like this. It’s called *“Ghost in the Café.”*

I am in a relationship with my partner for 7 years now. We have a toddler and I would say okay naman kami kahit hindi pa din nya ako pinapakasalan and UNTIL, I insisted to go back to the BPO industry instead of trying my luck again in VA world.

May nakilala akong papasang kambal ng partner ko. Matangkad, with specs, maputi, malinis, mahinhin tignan. Pwede pala yun? Plus, his speaking voice! Whoa?!? Sobrang sarap pakinggan.

Anyways, I had this batchmate na I would consider gurl buddy ko dun. I was being naughty sometimes para lang labanan ang antok sa training, na “Ang gwapo talaga ni ___.” Sya din ang nagsabi saken na papasang kambal si guy ng partner ko when I told her once na parang hawig si ___ and partner ko, as in!

Anyways, hindi naman kami nagpapansinan. Pero na-appreciate ko yung paghawak nya sa pinto ng training room nung nagkataong nakasunod ako sa kanya palabas. Bukod sa short convo about condo since nag-i-inquire na kasi kami nung buddy ko dun, we never shared anything naman na. HANGGANG, nasa nesting na kami. Last day ko, I was planning to resign na that day since got an offer from my previous client, nagulat ako na tinabihan nya ako. He was trying to talk to me. Nao-awkward-an ako kasi iba yung tingin nung girl buddy ko especially she knows biro-biro ko lagi na gwapong-gwapo ako kay guy.

He talked to me again after first half ng shift. He called me Ate, if I heard it right. HAHAHAHA. But he even sat again beside me when I was trying to compose my resignation letter. So I moved to other spot para di nya makita ginagawa ko WHICH I HOPE HINDI NYA INISIP NA AYOKO SYA KATABI OR WHATNOT.

So ayun na nga. More than a week after, got a DM from him calling me Miss ___. Nagulat ako. Usually kasi first name basis lang. Pero deadma na lang. Matagal ako mag-reply sa kanya, like days. I asked him bakit sya nagcha-chat. Una, sabi nya wala lang daw. Then he eventually admitted na nagandahan daw sya saken. Weh?!? 😂 Inaya nya ako mag-coffee or lunch only if I have time. Ganern.

Ngayon, hindi na sya nangungulit sa chat after ko sabihin na I have a partner. Then nag-chat ulit sya na tropa. Ganern.

Ngayon, ako na ang isip ng isip sa kanya. Pero iniisip ko na lang din na pinag-trip-an lang siguro ako.

I also tried to make the shoulders flush with the bottom, which I now realize should’ve been slightly tapered for better stability.

My favorite part, though, is how I hid those screws! I once read that as you get better at woodworking, you don’t stop making mistakes—you just get better at hiding them. This project proved that 100%.

*I'm back, I apologize for the wait. Life... Got in the way. I had to take care of some things, and honestly? I needed some time to think about what I was transcribing. It hit me all at once, the fact that my family is gone, and I’m now just learning what Simon went through. He said shitty things sure, he left my mom and I on our own, but I didn’t want him to go through what happened at the house. I barely knew him, but I care what happened to him. Whether it was all in his head or not, he didn’t deserve what he went through. And the thing is? I started to think he wasn’t making all this up. Especially not after what happened in this entry.*  

September 6th, 1995

I woke up before Maia, who was still curled around me and snoring. With my ear to her side, I felt the rhythmic pattern of her heart, pumping blood through her. *Thu-dump. Thu-dump. Thu-dump.* I tried to find comfort in that, in her closeness. But the sound was too rhythmic, too music-like. I pictured a lumpy, featherless bird in her chest, slick with gore and glaring with beady, blind eyes. *Thu-dump. Thu-dump. Ca-ka. Ca-ka.* 

I rose up as slowly as I could, untwining myself and rising out of the tub. Maia stirred ever so slightly, mumbled something I couldn’t understand, then fell right back asleep. Padding carefully over the door I braced myself for the scent, the sight of what happened last night. All those bodies glistening in the sunlight, the pinks and jagged whites of bone bright in the daytime. I shuddered, I knew they had to go. It was my job after all, my duty as the man of this house to make sure that everything was in proper order before I put the place on the market. I opened the doors and stepped out of the bathroom. 

The floors were dusty and dull with scratches and scuff marks, but there were no guts strewn about. The windows were grimy and opaque with dust and time, but they didn’t litter the floor in shards and fragments. Despite all logic, the windows were intact once more. As I scratched at the rough stubble that was growing on my face, I took in the unremarkable, old living room I was in. There were no rabbit corpses anywhere. It wasn’t relief I felt, nor fear or anxiety. Just a dull recognition that I was responsible for one less thing to clean. 

Maia found me in the kitchen a little later, finishing a cup of coffee and making a mental plan on how to tackle the last room on this floor: What I assumed was the guest room. She had a heavy flannel around her shoulders, and was looking at me with a look of disbelief. 

Maia: Hey. 

Me: Hi. Um, good morning. 

Maia: Did you… Have you been up for a while? 

Me: Yeah. Uh, yeah I’ve been up for a few minutes, I didn’t sleep well last night.

Maia: I mean, that’s entirely understandable. 

I could see Maia struggling, the questions quivering on her lips, her eyes bright with concern and anxiety despite the heaviness of dark circles beneath them. For some reason, for some unforgivable reason, I couldn’t bring myself to meet her in the middle. I took another sip of coffee. Eventually, Maia addressed the dead elephant in the room. Or rather, the lack of them. 

Maia: The rabbits aren’t there, the windows aren’t broken. 

Me: Yeah, I know. Maybe it was a gas leak or something? I’m not sure if it's on though. I- I don’t know.

Maia: Right. Okay well finish that drink, I’m going to start throwing our shit in the truck. We need to be gone by- 

Me: I- I can’t. Not until the house is clean. 

I squirmed under the sudden gaze of disbelief that Maia shot my way. I didn’t know how to explain to her the pull I felt to finish my job here. If I left now, if I failed at making this house worthy of flipping, I wasn’t sure how I would be able to survive the disappointment. The disappointment my mother would cast down onto me like a bolt of lightning, the disappointment in myself that would cover me like a lead blanket. I suppose I should have just told her that, but at the time all I could manage was 

Me: If you need to leave, I understand. 

Maia crouched down next to me, her eyes level with mine. 

Maia: Yeah, I need to leave, with you in that shitbox of yours right behind me. This place is fucked, Simon. 

Me: I know, but if I don’t get this place clean by winter- 

Maia: *Fuck* getting this place clean by winter! There are dead animals being thrown through the window, and *no* we didn’t just see shit, that’s not how that works. 

I could understand her frustration, hell, her anger at the situation, but I wasn’t moved. I was the man of my family, the caretaker of both my mom and Alex, this wasn’t something I could walk away from. I could work a dead end job for years, and not make a fraction of the money that I could make here, doing this. It wasn’t desperation that I was feeling, it was a necessity. A concrete absolute that I could save my family if I just waded through a few more uncomfortable weeks. I doubt Maia could understand that, before coming here: I doubt I would have either. 

Me: Okay, maybe not. But this is still something that I need to do. My mom is relying on me, my brother is relying on me. It’s my job, it’s important.

Maia: Your family is relying on the fact you’ll come back to them *alive,* you think you’ll be able to do that here? Seriously? You die trying to clean, what? A house with a psycho bitch neighbor? Someone who wants to chop you up and turn you into a stew? Then what? Your family is still in the exact same situation. 

Me: I’m not going to die here, Maia. 

She rose and stalked briskly around the kitchen, her hands in a silent prayer right in front of her lips. For several moments she paced around, her anxious energy filling the room like a hot gas. I didn’t know if she was going to scream, or run out of the room to her truck, but she again fell down to face me eye to eye. 

Maia: Look, if we leave now I promise you I will do everything I can to help your mom. I can look after Alex, or I can find another job or something. You don’t have to do all of that alone, but you will if you don’t leave with me right now, okay? 

I felt something throb in my chest, a warmth spreading through me where I didn’t know was a coldness. She must have seen a change in my expression, because Maia gave me a gentle smile. I had called, and she was there. I felt at ease in George’s cabin once she had arrived, so maybe I would feel that same comfort trying to solve this whole mess together with her. 

Me: Maia- 

There was a knock at the front door. We both jumped, looking at each other with confusion and concern. Another knock happened rapidly after the first one, dispelling the notion that we misheard. We sat in disbelief before I connected the dots, and my shoulders tensed ever so slightly. 

Maia: Who the fuck is that? 

Me: Someone who shouldn’t be here, c’mon. 

Maia sputtered in disbelief as I rose, treading slowly into the living room and squinting in through the blinds. Sure enough, I saw the neon pinks and greens of sweats and a headband. Hesitantly, I opened the door. 

Robin: Hi! How are you doing sweetie? My, it’s a beautiful day for a run! Awfully hot though, and I am parched! May I come in for a cool glass of water? 

Maia: Simon, who is this? 

Robin’s head snapped to Maia, who was peering over my shoulder with a mix of concern and scorn. The corner’s of Robin’s lips twitched at the sight of her, she looked at her with what I thought looked like *thirst,* and it made me sick. 

Robin: Oh, you have more company! I was wondering about the truck. Have you offered them a glass of water? I imagine they’re parched from the drive.  Hello there sweetheart, I’m Robin, and you are? 

I felt a cold jolt go through my spine, the sudden realization that whatever Maia said next, it shouldn’t be her name. I hastily cut her off just as her lips were parting to answer. 

Me: She’s my guest, she’s helping out with renovations. There’s a leak in the kitchen right now, so her and I need to go see that right now. I hope the rest of your run goes well. 

Robin’s eyes narrowed, and her smile erased itself in slow, dreadful strokes. What was left was an unreadable expression, something in between a glare and a bitter amusement. 

Robin: Simon, didn’t your mother ever tell you not to lie? 

Me: I- what?

Robin smiled at me, her teeth straight and clean. Despite that, I remembered the film photo of her, how it grinned in a shattered and animal-like way. 

Robin: You shouldn’t lie, it’s unbecoming of a young man like yourself. Is that how you want to conduct yourself in front of your guest? 

Maia: I don’t mind at all.

Reaching around me, Maia pushed the door shut in Robin’s face. 

Me: Hey! I had it handled. 

Maia: Yeah, and she was freaking me the fuck out, who was that? 

Before I could respond, we heard Robin’s voice from the other side of the door, her cool words clawing grooves of dread into my brain. 

Robin: The water is cool like a mirror, as clear as glass. What do you think looks upon you from the other side? Locks and paint won’t conceal what is known to me, won’t keep me at bay. I grow tired of your lack of pleasantries, I will see you both tonight. 

Maia: Simon, what is she talking about? 

We watched as for a minute or two, Robin stood outside of the front door, her pinks and greens muted by the sheer window curtain. She stood motionless, like a tree in a clearing. Like a bird frozen in the sky. When I began wondering if she was going to stand there forever, the shifting of position blurred the colors of the sweatbands, and Robin began walking down the driveway. 

Maia and stayed where we stood for several moments, silent and close to one another. The sunlight danced slowly across the floor and the lower part of the walls as the day drew on, the sun reaching closer and closer to the top of the sky. Maia eventually crept to the window, where she peeled away the curtain from the window frame with her finger. 

Maia: She’s gone. 

She turned to me with a look of fearful bewilderment, and it was that look of plain terror that snapped me out of my desire to stay. 

Me: Let’s grab our things. 

The next several minutes was a flurry of movement. We ran back and forth from the cars to the house, throwing anything we thought we needed into the vehicles. In no time, Maia was in her truck, I was in my car. We danced the awkward back and forth dance of swinging our cars around in the yard so that we could drive down the road. It was the scurry of animals, small creatures fumbling gracelessly and desperately to leave a burrow that was just moments ago safe. The cause? Something bigger with meaner had set its predatory eyes upon us. Maia set off first, and I followed shortly behind. 

The lowering sun was set in the sky at the perfect angle to blind me as we drove down the road. The canopy strangely was offering no coverage, so the light illuminated all the dust on my windshield, making the glass opaque and difficult to see through. We moved through the winding dirt road through the woods, the branches slapping the top and sides of my car. Perhaps it was because I was so preoccupied with peering through the windshield, but I didn’t remember the trees being so tight against the road. It was 3 miles from the main road, winding and twisting through the uneven land like a dead flat serpent. 

The lowering sun was blinding me, the dirt encrusted on the windshield making the glass opaque and difficult to peer through. As I jiggled the wiper fluid knob to spritz the windshield, it smeared and rubbed into the dirt. It obscured the fact that Maia’s truck had come to a sudden stop, and it was too late for me to stop. I slammed into the bed of her trunk, the glass cracking and my hood crumpling up like a can I had smashed underfoot. Flaring pain shot through my neck as my head rocked forward, my torso fastened tightly to the seat by the bite of my seatbelt. The noise in the cabin was quickly filled with horrible knocking and clacking noises, and I shut the engine off with a trembling hand. 

Pushing the door open I saw that the hood of my car had been shunted back, but the tip of the front bump was wedged firmly into the dirt underneath Maia’s back bumper. Her truck was leaning forward, like a bird dipping its beak into the surface of the lake. The door swung open, and I saw Maia lean dizzily out of the door, it was clear she was still pinned to her seat from the seatbelt. I rushed over, my neck still kindled in pain like red-hot wires. Maia’s brow was split, blood was running down the ridge of her nose and into her lip, a smear of red left behind at the tip of her steering wheel. Her eyes looked unfocused, a low moan escaping her as I unbuckled her from the seat. 

Me: Hey, hey. Are you okay? What happened? 

Maia: Mmm, Idinnitt see it when I came, it wasn’t there. 

She pointed to the front of the car, and I eased her back into her seat before walking around the front of the car. A cavernous hole was entrenched deep into the dirt road, deep enough to cause the truck to lean and raise its back half partially off the ground. The left tire was sucked into it, the rubber torn and deflated. I saw that the bumper was crumpled, meaning the drop was hard and fast enough to pop the tire and stop Maia dead in her tracks. I looked back as she slid off of her seat and stumbled back into the road. 

Maia: Shit. Shiiiiit. 

She inspected the damage for a moment before she let out a groan of frustration and kicked the car, a few droplets of blood flicking from her face and onto the headlight as she did. 

Me: Maia sit back down, let me clean that for you. 

She looked at me with a mix of annoyance and confusion. Once she put her hand to her forehead, and the hand came back bloody, did she let me guide her back to the seat. I went to my own car and dug around for the old first aid kit that mom always insisted that I kept in it. Smearing some A&D  into the wound(which won me a swat and curses from Maia), I pressed a bandage on her cut. The wound itself wasn’t that bad, it was Maia’s behavior that was freaking me out. She seemed to be moving through molasses, her responses were oftentimes delayed and loud. How hard had she hit her head in the crash? 

Maia: Push my truck, I’m going to try and reverse out. 

Me: No use, your tire is popped, and I’m wedged under your taillight. 

Maia: You sonofabitch, your road is a piece of shit.

Me: Yeah, among other things I imagine. 

Maia: Pull your car out, let’s try and go around my truck. 

I nodded and helped her to the side of the road. I hopped back into my Volvo. The sun was getting heavy in the sky now, it was getting harder and harder to see through the entwining lattice of trunks and branches. It was still light out, but for how much longer? Disappointment set in almost immediately as I tried the key in the ignition. The old engine sputtered and whirred, the popping of old gears and belts made my ears sting as I turned the key, once, twice, three times. There was no luck, the engine wouldn’t turn over. The car wouldn’t turn on. I sat there for a moment, trying desperately not to let my breath go wild with panic. We were still a mile or two from the main road, and Maia was clearly not in a good spot. I didn’t know where Robin was, and I didn’t know what else was in these woods. I got out of the car, and walked over to Maia, who was clearly trying to fight off a frenzy of her own. As I spoke, I found myself whispering, like I was afraid of something overhearing us. 

Me: The engine is messed up, it won’t start. 

Maia: God, yeah I figured. Okay, get whatever you need, we’re walking. 

Me: Are you sure- 

Maia: Geturstuff, Simon. 

She gave me a look that was clear there was no arguing with, so I relented. I shoved the first aid box, a flashlight, and some cans of food into the bag before meeting back up with Maia. Without another word, the two of us started down the road. The going was slow, the road was bumpy and offered many opportunities to roll your ankle if you weren’t paying close attention. Maia tried to have us move at a brisk pace at the beginning, but soon was hunched over and vomiting in the ditch for her efforts. We stayed close together, the sounds of rocks scraping and dragging underneath the soles of our footwear was the only thing anchoring us in this unnatural silence. We walked for minutes in an uninterrupted quiet. Neither one of us had anything to say, neither one of us were brave enough to fill the forest with our voices. The sun dropped lower and lower into the sky as we walked. Before long, the sky painted itself with broad strokes of orange and red. The shadows of the roots deepened, the tendrils of darkness from the branches stretched out over the road around us. 

I felt guilt mounting in my chest, remorse for everything I did or failed to do in these past few days. It threatened to clog my throat and choke me. I watched as Maia walked, the bandage on her drooping head was nearly stained through already. That had been my fault.

Me: I- I’m sorry that I asked you to come out here. 

Maia: Yeah, I’m sorry about that too. 

A thin smile gave me permission to give a small laugh, but I just didn’t have it in me. I was failing her, I was failing my family. I wasn’t sure I was ever going to get out of these woods again. 

Me: Maia, I- I don’t want to see my mom dying anymore.

Maia: Wh-what? 

Me: I just, I don’t want to go back home, but I don’t want to stay here anymore. 

Maia: Oh god, listen Simon we’ll figure this out when we get into town, but right now we- 

Her sentence cut off with a shrill cry, as she dug her heels into the dirt and grabbed my arm. Her eyes were trained up at the branches, and with good reason. The sun was nearly set, the light glowing like a warm fire through the branches. It was still plenty light enough however to silhouette the many small forms nestled in the trees above. 

Birds, of different sizes, of different species, were in the branches all around, watching us.   

Not one of them made any song, none of them preened or made quick, jerking motions like birds usually do. They were silent, watching. The birds made a loose arch over the road in front of us. They seemed to lean from their perches, leaning towards us. Eagerly, as if silently awaiting our approach. I looked at Maia, who wobbled slightly in place. She took a step forward, and movement rippled through the trees. The branches bobbed as dozens of the creatures shifted their weight, as if getting ready to glide off towards the road. They moved in perfect unison, not a single one acting independently from the rest. 

Maia: What’s- What’s wrong with their heads? 

In the failing light I had to squint my eyes, but I was able to see them. The heads didn’t match, they weren’t the same texture or color as the bird’s bodies. Their eyes were dark, no they were *gone.* These birds couldn’t be real animals, because every single one of them had a skull nestled at the top of their necks, peering at us with empty sockets.  

Me: We have to go back. 

Maia grunted, gritting her teeth and sifting back her foot beneath her. After a pause, she nodded. I didn’t know if I should release a sigh of relief, or feel dread at the decision. Regardless, Maia and I turned and hurried down the road. Hurried away from the things that mimicked birds. Hurried back to Uncle George’s house.",1,1760401154.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

**Chapter One.** 

I've always been a painter. Since I could hold a paintbrush, I was making art. I was always alone as a child, some would call me strange, weird, eccentric, the words people use when someone is just strange. I was alright with the thought of being strange. Now, as an adult, I’m still strange. I paint the things I hear in my head. Voices that speak to me in the background of my head. I use the medium of acrylics, pastels, and canvas to show what they say, what they see, what they look like. People tend to call my art “contemporary” or “unusual” when I show it. It’s true, to the normal person it does look a bit intriguing, but to a true artist, it tells a story.  

I sit in my art studio working on a new piece, I call it “Ghostly beauty” a bit on the nose, but it’s a work in progress. The painting depicts a frail, pale woman, sitting on a bench in a field of daisies. I’m halfway done with the painting, but I’m stuck on her face. I haven’t heard a description of her face yet. I don’t want to paint a face they won’t like. So, I work on making the daisies as detailed as possible. I hear a knock on my door. I set my things neatly onto my counter. I can’t stand things being out of order. I hear another knock as I’m walking down the stairs. 

“Coming!” I yelled. As I check the peep hole, I notice a chipper young woman standing outside my door.  

“Who is that?” a voice whispered in a low growl. 

“I don’t know, let’s find out together.” 

I opened the door and saw who was there. A woman, probably a year or two younger than me stands in front of me, holding a small, yellow purse in the shape of a daisy. She wore a long denim dress and had her brown hair in a messy bun. A wide, chipper smile was along her round face, her round red glasses complemented her hazel eyes.  

“Pretty...” a shy womans voice said. 

“I know” I mumbled. 

“Hi! I’m Dahlia! The Abraham Cohen Foundation sent me to come and view some of the pieces from your portfolio before the showing next week. Do you mind if I come in?”  

“Too loud...” 

“So beautiful...” 

“DON’T LET HER IN” 

I shook her hand. My head pounds with an uproar of voices. Majority of them didn’t like visitors, but the ones that did like them didn’t want to let them go. 

“Welcome in. I can show you the studio. Sorry if it’s a bit messy.” She came in, her boots making echoing click sounds in my home.  

“Wow, your home is so clean! I wish I could be this tidy” 

“She talks to much...” 	 

“I wish I had her eyes...” 

“GET HER OUT!” 

I itched my head as the pounding hurt even more. 

“I try to keep it clean. My passion is messy so I might as well keep my life as tidy as I can”. We walked into my studio, and she began looking at all my work. The walls of my studio are lined with finished paintings, sketches, half done paintings, and she closely viewed all of them.  

“She’s too close...” a man’s voice whispered.  

“She’s fine” I mumbled. She was very close to my paintings. A lot closer than most people. She walked to another painting across the room to a stack of canvases leaning against the wall; she sifted through some and pointed out a larger piece. 

“Can I pull this one out?” 

“Sure, let me help” 

As I held back the canvases, she revealed a painting I wish she had never noticed. She pulled it out and put it onto an easel.  

“What’s this one called? It’s incredible! I don’t know why you didn’t submit this one.” she asked as her eyes darted across the painting, studying every inch of it. The painting showed a man in the lower center of the canvas, kneeling towards a throne. The throne was raised on a pile of rotting corpses, each in a different state of decay. Floating above the throne is a humanlike figure, but with wings stretched wide, showing the bat-like skin and large demonic size. His limbs are long and are held high above his head, wielding a scepter. His legs are slender and look like birds' legs. His face...His face is that of a fly, eyes large, red, and bulging from his head, long tendrils coming from his mouth, as if he is about to consume the man kneeling before him. Whether in praise or in fear. A wave of dread, disgust and nausea come over me in waves. A high pitch ringing in my ears becomes shattered by the sound of all the voices yelling at me in unison.  

“NO! She can’t know!” 

“That’s private!” 

“LIE!” 

“Make her leave!” 

“She’s so pretty...” 

I paused and stared at the painting. The voices haven't been this loud since the making of it. They wouldn’t let me destroy it. I must tell her. She asked.  

“Ba’al Zabub” 

“It’s such a detailed piece, the way the different red tones really complement the dark blues of the bodies. And the way you painted this demon figure is just. Wow. I’m at a loss for words.” 

She looks at me, smiling, as if she's waiting for me to agree or go on a tangent about the different meanings of everything in the piece.  

“I agree. It took me a long time to get this done.” 

“I would love to have this show cased. I feel like this would really shine in the gallery. Would you be okay with that?” 

“NO!” 		 “Please don't hurt her...” 

“No!”       “No!”     	   “SHOW THEM!” 

“Show the world our Master....”          

“YES, SHOW THEM” 			“No! 

All yelling at once. The spot behind my eyes searing in pain, like a million needles are stabbing into my brain from the inside.  

“Yes! Yes...sorry for yelling yes. We can add it.” 

Complete silence. Not from Dahlia, but from the voices. They weren't mumbling, they weren't growling, nothing. They all just shut up.  

“Wonderful! Just bring it to the gallery on Thursday evening so you can show the boss man and his partners this new addition.” 

“Got it.” 

We walked back to the front door. As she was about to leave, she turned to me and said, “You know, a lot of the stuff you showed me could’ve been entered, you’re a really good artist.” I smiled “Thank you. I tend to stay private with my art but I had a good feeling about this foundation so, I don’t know, guess I had a change of heart.” 

“CRINGE” 

“Don’t lie to her”			“WE told you to enter” 

“LIAR”		“NO” 

I shook my head and my eye started twitching. As Dahlia left, I thought about what the voices said. They weren’t wrong, they did tell me to enter my art here. After I got that strange email invitation they basically were screaming and begging me to email back. I did think it was weird that a Church also had an art gallery and contacted me specifically. Why were the voices so compelled to enter here, any other time I tried showing off my art they always and a million reasons why I shouldn’t enter. These thoughts rack my brain. I go back to the painting of the woman. I began to repaint her hair a shining brown, with a round face, and a pair of round red glasses.  

**Chapter Two.** 

I follow the directions on my GPS leading me to Abraham Fellowship Church, either the Abraham stands for the one in the bible or this guy had a huge ego problem. I pulled down the street to see a huge compound, smaller white brick buildings surrounding a huge white church, like something you’d see in Rome. The front had a giant stain glass window of Jesus floating above his disciples, underneath that was a large wooden door. I was told the gallery was to be held in one of the smaller buildings, still huge but relatively small compared to the monolith of a church. As I begin to unload my portfolio from my trunk, the voices seem to stop chattering, they’ve been unusually quite all day, besides the occasional yell to hit someone with my car, one talking about Dalia, and another telling me not to go altogether. It was strange how silent they were when I pulled in, as if they didn’t want someone else to hear them. Maybe it’s cause I’m at a church. I haven’t been to one in years, a decade maybe. And whenever I would go as a child, or what I could remember from then, is them being silent. I haven’t exactly figured out what their boundaries are, and I don't really care, because they never cared about mine.  

“Hello, are you Samael?” A man’s voice said behind me. I jumped back and dropped my bag. 

“Shit! Hey, yeah that’s me. Sorry about that, you scared me” 

“Oh, my bad about that. My names David McCormick, I’m head of our arts department here at the Church, Abraham sent me to guide you to the building, won’t want you to get lost.” He said with a chuckle. His voice had an old timey southern twang to it. He was pudgier, taller man, with a mid-length graying beard with matching greying black hair. He wore a black button-up shirt with a clerical collar, dark blue jeans, timberlands, and had skinny wire framed glasses on. He looked very jolly, if that's the right word to use, like unsettlingly happy.  

“Thank you, I’ve never been here before.” 

“Well welcome! This here church has grown into what it is now over many, many years. Generations and generations of the same four families built this place to what it is today. A place of community, love and worship. That’s why we decided to open but the gallery, hoping to bring in more people to talk about their love of art and hopefully soon, their love of the Lord.” 

“What families brought this place up? I’ve lived her my whole life and I’ve never noticed this.” 

“Well, my own of course, the Cohens, the Simons, and the Soloman's. Ever since the Pilgrams came here, they settled and brought the Lord with them.” 

“Oh, that’s interesting.” 

“Yes, our history is very interesting. But don’t worry, there won’t be a quiz later” Again he chuckled.  

We came up to the gallery building. Another big white brick building, but above the door was a sign reading the name “David McCormick Art Gallery”. We entered the building, and a gust of cold air came over me. I shivered enough for David to speak. 

“We keep it cold, so the humidity doesn’t damage any of the paintings, we have a lot of different mediums in here, so I thought this was best.” 

“Makes sense.” 

The room had a huge floor plan, with walls spaced out in the center of it to add more space for art. Some walls were already decorated with paintings, charcoal sketches, photographs, all with religious depictions and animals. We walk to a side door labeled “Staff only” and walk inside. A whole group of people were making small talk, some with their portfolio bags still, some with coffee, and some just sitting at the giant table in the middle of the room. I see Dahlia standing in the corner talking to someone who is probably another artist, wearing a black blouse with a large sparkly broach in the shape of a cardinal, with a mid-length blue skirt. Hair still in a bun, glasses still round and red.  

“Pretty...”  

I hear a voice whisper in the back of my head, and I swear after the voice said that one of the men in a typical priest outfit looked at me, with his eyebrows furrowing after making eye contact with me. Maybe he was trying to figure out who I was, or something like that. An older man at the end of the table rises from his chair and gestures towards me.  

“Ah, our final guest has arrived. Everyone welcome Samael LeFlore, one of our highlighted artists of the event” 

Jeez this guy looked creepy. He was tall and thin. He had greasy black hair that went past his ears, he wore a black cassock with a rosary around his neck. One of his eyes was severally glazed over, almost grey, while the other was a bright blue. He smiled with crooked grey teeth. Some scattered whispers arose from the crowd around me. I hated it. I hated all the eyes on me.  

“Now that we’re all acquainting with each other, I would love to take a moment and acknowledge the two people who made this all possible, David McCormick and his niece Dahlia Bennett” 

Applause erupted in the small room, over the noise, the voices rose 

“NIECE? WHAT THE SHIT!” 

“I don’t like it here” 													“LEAVE LEAVE LEAVE ” 

“Dahlia...” 		                      “TOO LOUD” 

My head pounded, my eyes hurt like someone was stabbing them from the inside. I closed my eyes as tight as I could and also screamed for them to shut up. As the clapping stopped, so did the voices, they quieted down and I stood awkwardly and slowly opened my eyes. Dahlia was standing next to me.  

“Hey, are you alright?” 

“Yeah, I just get headaches sometimes.” 

“Alright, just making sure. Wouldn’t want you feeling bad on the first day.” 

“First day?” 

“Yeah, did no one tell you? This is not only an art show, but a artist retreat! Isn’t that fun?” 

What. A retreat? With art nerds and Jesus freaks? For a whole week?  

“No, no one told me this was a multi-day experience.” 

“Oh shoot. That should've been in the email. Well its only three days, then on the third its the art show.” 

“I didn’t pack clothes or anything.” 

“That’s fine, you can always borrow some from the chapel, they have a donation bin.” 

She placed her hand on my shoulder, she knew I wasn’t all that excited to stay here for multiple days. Her hand was warm and made me feel this strange fuzzy feeling. 

“EW HER HAND” 	 

“Warm...” 

“GET HER AWAY” 

I took her hand off my shoulder, it was soft. She looked pretty today. No, no I shouldn't be thinking these things. Her uncle was one of the people who ran this place, who knows what could happen to me if I started pursuing that. 

“Oh, that’s nice. I guess I could stay for the retreat.” 

“Wonderful! Oh, that makes me so happy” She smiled at me and walked around to some of the other artists in the room. Everyone in the room began to sit down at the table in the center of the room. I sat in-between a women older than me, possibly in her early 40s. She looked like she was a funeral director. Then on the other side of me was a man around the same age as me, in full scene attire. Spikey hair and all. The woman scowled toward me when I sat down, and the man offered a sleeveless gloved hand to me. 

“Hey, my names Zeke, you’re pretty popular tonight.” 

“Yeah, I wasn’t expecting that kind of welcome.” 

“Well, from what I’ve heard, you have one of the main art pieces of the gallery. I’m not gonna lie, I am a little jealous they picked you over mine.” 

“Mine? Huh, didn’t know that. But what was your piece?”  

“It was my spin on the famous painting ‘The Creation of Adam’, where instead of it being realistic and two men, it’s two women and it's made up of a bunch of different mediums. I can show you after the presentation if you want.” 

“That sounds cool.” Zeke seemed like a cool guy, who knows, maybe I can make some friends out of this experience. Looking around the table there are about seven other people who are artists. Dahlia was there sitting next to her uncle at the front of the table. Another, younger man, was sitting across from her, he was the priest guy who stared at me earlier, and at the end of the table closest to the screen was Abraham. He clapped his hands together to get our attention before speaking again.  

“I know you are all very excited about this opportunity to be here with many talented artists and clergymen to become closer to faith, and better your skills. Now as some of you know this is a four-day retreat ending in the opening of the gallery. We all just want you to bond and grow with each other, and the spirit of the Lord. So, we will have rooms for everyone, the women in one wing and the men in the other. Some of our staff will escort you and give you the itinerary for the following days. Now, you are free to explore after that but be sure to be in the dining hall for dinner and our nightly sermon. Thank you all, Amen” 

Mumbled ‘Amens’ came from the group, some saying it more confidently than others. As we all rose from the table, more clergymen and women entered the room. I guess they have housing on property.  

“Hello, I’m Douglas, I’ll take you to your housing quarters and help you get settled in. These people will take your portfolios if you haven’t given them already. Follow me.” 

Another man came up to me to take my paintings, including the newest addition, as he grabbed the bag he looked at me with this look in his eyes of fear, like I did something wrong. 

“Be careful with them please, I had to repack them in a hurry.”   
“I will, sir.” As he scurried away, out of the corner of my eye I saw Abraham twirling his rosary, staring at me with his cold, blind eyes.  ",1,1760401093.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I CAN NOT stop using wegovy, it is not an option for me. But I am disabled and there is no way for me to afford private insurance or pay out of pocket for my medications. To be blunt I live on $900 a month I have to choose between whether I want one meal a day or an iced coffee. 
There is no earthly way I can work 40 hrs a week and get insurance through a job because of my disability, so I am needing help figuring out what to do. I will die before I gain the weight back. 

Does anyone know if I qualify for the $500/month offer with wegovy where if you don’t have insurance and you contacted the manufacturer company and fill it through them you pay $500? Is there anything cheaper? I don’t want to do any medspa thing, I want a legitimate filled prescription. My doctor recommended I look at Zepbound because the plan was she could help me spread it out to do a dose every two weeks, but in fine print on the site it says you have to pay that $500 a month and use it or you’ll be charged much much more. I am on 2.4 mg wegovy so anything equivalent to that I am open to, and I am also open to doing literally anything to keep my wegovy, I’d drive down to Mexico and get it through a pharmacy there if I knew how to do that.

I just got back from a 2-week trip to New Zealand and wanted to share some comments that might help anyone planning a visit soon.

My itinerary:

* Sep 29: Auckland
* Sep 30 – Oct 1: Taupō
* Oct 2: Wellington
* Oct 3–4: Motueka (Abel Tasman area)
* Oct 5–6: St Arnaud (Nelson Lakes National Park)
* Oct 7–8: Kaikōura
* Oct 9–12: Christchurch

Some notes:

* My itinerary was a bit ambitious. After two weeks, I started to feel the driving fatigue (especially coming from Canada, where we drive on the right side). The roads in NZ are actually pretty good, but I’d recommend visiting fewer places and taking things a bit slower.
* If you’re traveling in October, be ready for very unpredictable weather. I had rain, thunderstorms, sunshine, and strong winds all within an hour. Pack layers and plan for all conditions.
* Beer, coffee, and dairy are fantastic. Pies and sausage rolls were delicious, and fish and chips are great and quite affordable.
* Fuel is expensive, so keep that in mind if you’re renting a car.
* I rented from Apex. Great service, minimal shuttle wait times, and cars were in excellent condition.
* Cities like Auckland and Wellington were really interesting. I wish I had spent a bit more time exploring them.
* Prices include taxes, and tipping isn’t expected, so what you see is what you pay. Some places charge a small (1–2%) credit card surcharge, but it’s usually noted in advance.
* Lastly, people were incredibly friendly, relaxed, and polite everywhere we went.

That’s about all I can think of! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

My husband asked what I want for my birthday this year and I said a night alone at a hotel with a spa ... he was a little hesitant to agree, because he was confused about my wanting to deliberately spend a night away from home without husband and baby. I explained that a night where I dont have to cook, clean up, do bath and bedtime, where I can just go to a spa, order food, do some skin care like a face mask, play my cozy video game or read all night next to some wine, not have to possibly wake up through the night to my toddler... then i could sleep in, get some coffee and pastries and slowly make my way home... Just sounds like such a nice break and nice gift. I told my mom my idea and she said it sounds like a waste of money and I could just do that stuff at home in the basement.

What’s making it hard is this “overly pious” personality I keep encountering, especially among many converts. Every conversation seems to be drenched in religious catchphrases and a kind of performative reverence that, frankly, feels superficial. It makes it difficult to get to know people on a human level.

For example, I’ll be talking to someone hoping to connect over normal interests, like cars, and instead of just saying, “Yeah, I rebuilt my transmission,” it becomes, “Through the grace of God I was able to afford a new transmission.” I’m not denying God’s grace, but it feels like they’re broadcasting their piety rather than just having a conversation.

Another thing that really discourages me is baptized Orthodox showing up to catechumen classes to dominate discussions with their “vast experience,” interrupting, and constantly seeking visibility with the priest — kissing his hand mid-conversation, asking for blessings in ways that seem performative rather than natural.

Ironically, I see this behavior much less with cradle Orthodox. It’s mostly among converts, often those who’ve bounced around various Protestant denominations. It reminds me of the kind of shallow, image-driven religiosity that I think has pushed a lot of people away from Christianity over the last few decades.

I want to grow in the faith. But honestly, this dynamic makes me not want to go to catechumen class or coffee hour at all.

What can I learn from this? Help","It’s been a brutal stretch, and I’d love your honest takes, especially on the second situation involving two people.

1. The breakup: Dated a girl for ~5 months. After a fight, she said things were “too heavy” but promised coffee. Then she disappeared. Not devastated about the end (it was clearly a failing fling as we were discovering we weren’t super compatible), but the disrespect stung.

2. The friend ghosting: I joined a queer kickball league with my good friend Jane, who I’ve been friends with for two years, where we both met Kara. A few days post-breakup, Jane encouraged Kara and I to hookup given Kara’s crush on me (which I hadn’t known about) and we did end up kissing. Jane told me the next day that both Kate and I should just leave it at “just that one time,” because dating is complicated, but I thought that was just her more reflecting on a long term relationship she had just broken off. Then when Kara invited me on a date, Jane called us during the date, got upset, accused me of disrespecting her, said “I can’t be friends with people who don’t listen to my advice” and ended the friendship. I’m still unsure if she had a crush on Kara or just wanted control.

3. The third ghosting: Kara and I were texting daily with multiple paragraphs for a few weeks when she said she’d message me the next day… then nothing. Poof. My gut says Jane told her to cut things off, but I’ll never really know. I texted her to see if she was okay, and Kara said she was overwhelmed, needed space and wanted to just be friends for a while. In a low moment, I sent them both angry texts that they ignored and I think kind of ruined any chance at reconciliation. (If there was any to begin with? Not sure?)

I’m neurodivergent, so all of this feels especially confusing and intense. I’m trying to learn and grow, but right now I feel deeply rejected and unsure how to trust or show up again. Would holding back my angry messages have changed anything? Was any of this salvageable? How do you recover your social energy after multiple back-to-back ghostings?

1o60s6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContentMarketing/comments/1o60s6z/the_freedom_of_no_preference_a_humourous_take_on/,#The Freedom of No Preference: A Humourous Take on Life's Choices,"Here’s a thoughtful quote about preference:

""Sometimes, the greatest freedom lies in having no preference at all."" 

This quote highlights the idea that not being tied to specific choices can open up new possibilities and paths.

“Sometimes, the greatest freedom lies in having no preference at all.” This delightful quote has a way of making us pause and think—or perhaps chuckle nervously while we ponder our own chaotic lives filled with endless choices. In a world where we’re constantly bombarded with options (coffee or tea? Netflix or Hulu? Cats or dogs?), it’s easy to feel like we’re drowning in a sea of preferences. But what if I told you that sometimes, the best choice is to simply not choose at all? Grab your favorite snack (preferably something that pairs well with indecision) and let’s dive into the liberating—and often hilarious—world of having no preferences!

## The Overwhelming Buffet of Life

Imagine walking into an all-you-can-eat buffet. You’ve got everything from sushi to spaghetti, and suddenly, the thought of choosing becomes more daunting than trying to solve a Rubik’s cube while blindfolded. You start sweating, your heart races, and you begin questioning your life choices. “Do I really want that mystery meat?” you ponder, as if it holds the secrets to the universe. 

Now, here’s where the concept of having no preference shines brighter than a disco ball at a 70s party. What if you just said “screw it” and piled your plate high with everything? That’s right! No preference means you can sample every dish without the guilt of commitment. You might discover that pineapple on pizza isn’t half bad—just don’t tell your friends!

## The Joy of Spontaneity

Having no preference is like being on a rollercoaster—there are twists, turns, and maybe even a few screams along the way. When you let go of rigid preferences, life becomes an exciting adventure rather than a tedious chore. Think about it: how many times have you spent hours deciding which movie to watch only to end up staring blankly at your screen while contemplating life’s big questions? 

Now picture this: instead of picking a movie, you spin around in circles and randomly point at one! It could be an action flick, a romantic comedy, or even a documentary about the mating habits of garden snails. The possibilities are endless! Embracing spontaneity can lead to unexpected joy and laughter—and who doesn’t want more giggles in their life?

## The Art of Indecision

Let’s face it; indecision gets a bad rap. Sure, it can lead to awkward situations—like standing in front of an ice cream parlor for 20 minutes only to walk away empty-handed because you couldn’t pick between chocolate chip cookie dough and mint chocolate chip (the horror!). But indecision also has its perks! 

When you adopt an “I’ll just wing it” attitude, you open yourself up to experiences that go beyond your usual preferences. You might try karaoke even though your showerhead is your only audience. Spoiler alert: you’ll probably be terrible—but hey, who cares? There’s freedom in knowing that life isn’t about perfection; it’s about enjoying the ride (and potentially embarrassing yourself along the way).

## Conclusion: Embrace Your Inner Free Spirit

So there you have it! Sometimes life feels like an overstuffed piñata filled with choices just waiting for us to take a swing at them. By letting go of our tightly held preferences and embracing spontaneity, we can discover new flavors, experiences, and hilariously awkward moments that make life worth living.

Next time you're faced with too many options (or too little confidence), remember that sometimes the greatest freedom lies in not having any preference at all. So go ahead—try that strange-looking dish at dinner or join that impromptu dance party! Life is too short for rigid choices when there’s so much fun to be had.

AI just helps you listen.,"I watched a host drop $600 on branded matches, fancy olive oil, and a coffee table book about Scandinavian architecture last month.

Every single review said: *""We loved sitting on the deck at sunset.""*

The answer was right there. They just couldn't see it.

# Reviews are demand signals in disguise

According to Expedia's 2025 Traveler Value Index, 84% of travelers say memorable experiences matter more than physical amenities.

Your reviews literally tell you what guests will pay to feel again. You just need to spot the pattern.

# Here's the process I use:

**Step 1: Find the feelings**

Grab your last 10-15 reviews. Look for emotional words like ""peaceful,"" ""cozy,"" ""sunset,"" or ""friendly.""

Paste them into ChatGPT or Claude with this prompt:

\> *Act as a hospitality insights researcher. Analyze these guest reviews and identify recurring emotional themes in 5 words or fewer (e.g., peace, connection, discovery). Create a table: Feeling | % of Reviews | Guest Quote | $40 Idea | Setup Time | Why It Fits*

AI will surface what actually drives five-star moments.

**Step 2: Create one tiny experience**

Pick the top emotion. Ask AI to turn it into something you can test for under $40 and set up in under 10 minutes.

Real examples:

* **Mountain cabin** guests valued tranquility → ""Sunrise coffee kit with thermal carafe and trail map"" ($28)
* **Urban hotel** guests craved inspiration → ""Local artist postcard with handwritten neighborhood gems"" ($15)
* **Coastal rental** guests wanted togetherness → ""Sunset snack basket with blanket and speaker"" ($35)

Each became a paid add-on.

**Step 3: Test it for 7 days**

Add it to your booking flow or listing. Send one simple message:

*""We're trying something new this week for early risers.""*

Track it:

* 5%+ attach rate = proven demand
* Under 5% = tweak description, price, or timing

After 7 days, ask AI to analyze your results and suggest improvements.

**Step 4: Repeat quarterly**

Emotions shift with seasons. ""Cozy"" works in winter. ""Sunset"" kills in summer.

Let data guide your next move, not assumptions.

# Why this works?

AI spots patterns you can't see manually. Low-cost tests prove demand before you spend big. And according to HVS's 2025 Hotel Development Cost Survey, guest-experience projects outperform new amenities by 22% within 12 months.

Small thoughtful touches beat expensive renovations every time.

# The real win?

You stop guessing. You start listening, testing, and scaling what your guests already love.

I honestly disgust myself and I'm ashamed because every other of my friends already have a proper job/house. And I'm stuck into a job for students and failures.

I do want to go back to study and I have been looking for courses on Open university. I even have been doing some free courses for the heck of it. But I need to choose well and not have another diploma that will lead me back to coffee. The UK job market is shite, so I cannot afford to make a mistake.

One thing I've been interested lately is product design. I actually do have a Bachelor in illustration. I was thinking about designing adaptive shoes that would be easy to put on and take off for people with mobility issues. I've been researching about that and it interests me a lot. The problem with design now is that, because of AI, any 14yo could design a dozen of those between two Bluey episodes. So I think design is dead for newcomers.

I've also been looking at Environmental management. The courses from Health Science look interesting too, but i dont know if I can be made for healthcare (stressing and back breaking, my parents were nurses).

I also looked at Chartered surveyors courses, but seeing the estate crisis in the UK, I dont know. There's some apprenticeship openings right now but I can't apply yet as I dont have a driving license.

The appetizers are really amazing fried comfort food (fataya is basically a salmon empanada but somehow doesn’t even taste that much like salmon, it tastes like something entirely even better?; and accara are black eyed pea fritters, so they’re coated in batter and fried to perfection; both come with a delicious tomato-onion sauce for dipping and a spicier salsa, I’m not sure what they’re called). The chicken yassa is melt in your mouth chicken on the bone in a savory sauce with lots of onions and a few bell peppers. Entrées come with two sides — I get a side of jollof rice and niebe (black eyed peas in a really delicious slightly spicy sauce). There’s also fried plantains, couscous, etc. to choose from. I could honestly have an entire meal of the jollof rice and niebe and be super satisfied. It’s insanely good. I haven’t tried any of the drinks yet but they have a good selection. 

It’s not cheap but I got an appetizer and entree and split with my partner and it was enough food for both of us, so a little over $20pp. I’d recommend dining in if you can because you’ll get bigger portions. 

The guy who runs it apparently trained with Senegalese chefs down on the south side and opened up his own restaurant on the north side so as not to compete with them. Good guy.

For months, I thought IT was coming in early to handle it. Or that maybe management finally invested in something behind the scenes.

Then last Friday, I had to come in super early for a call with a different time zone. Around 7:15, I saw one of the guys from logistics standing in front of the printer with a screwdriver and a cup of coffee, calmly clearing a jam like it was part of his routine.

I asked him how often he does this. He shrugged and said, “Most days. I pass it on my way in, and it’s usually acting up. Figured I’d save people some grief.”

I told him thank you. I think I said it like three times. We ended up chatting for a bit, turns out he used to work in maintenance before switching roles. Never made a big deal about it. Never even mentioned it.

I grabbed him a coffee later that day. Nothing fancy, just his usual from the café downstairs. He smiled and said, “Hope it doesn’t mean I get assigned to printer duty officially now.”

It’s such a small thing, but it made me realize how much smoother the mornings feel because someone quietly decided to help.

I’m super into coding and exploring large language models, but I also enjoy kicking back with sitcoms and action/sci-fi movies—think Deadpool & Wolverine for Marvel chaos, Captain America: Brave New World for superhero thrills, or the slick No Time to Die from the James Bond series.

On the plus side, I could cure myself without antibiotics.","I was so motivated to quit sugar again, to have my healthy glow up on my skin, to lose pounds of weight.   
I know my body since I've quit sugar before, usually I don't really start losing weight (except for water weight at the beginning) before 2-3 weeks. But that's fine, I knew that, right?  
  
So I quit sugar but this time around I swapped my cheat day where I could eat sugar for a healthy baking day. There are advantages and disadvantages to having a cheat day, and I just didn't want to deal with the disadvantages. so on my ""healthy baking day"" the only ingredient that contained a little bit of sugar was dark chocolate (70%) on my chickpea brownies, and dates! Without the dates one serving had 18g of added sugars (with dates roughly 35g of sugar in total), and I'd have 3 servings for the week, that were supposed to fight my cravings.   
  
Worked out good, even though I felt slightly like I cheated, shouldn't I go through the headaches, the night hunger and the likes? Not this time I thought, and I was pleased to see that I lost 1.2kg when I was 3 weeks into quitting sugar, a success! And I was only 9 days apart from eating it again, then 5 days.... except I fell sick with a bladder infection. Wasn't I supposed to keep healthy on no sugar? A week prior I almost caught a cold, but I only felt sick-ish for a day, whereas people around me would fall ill for days.  
What was unique about my bladder infection: I could NEVER ever treat a bladder infection WITHOUT antibiotics before, it would just worsen so much that this was no option for me so far. (And please, no medical advice on bladder infections in this reddit, I know all the tricks to keep myself clean down there..)  
But this time I tried, rested, had some ibuprofen, drank 5-6 litres of tea a day, had some natural remedies from the pharmacy store and boom it would actually go away.   
  
I really think no sugar plus not drinking coffee really made that possible, not just the recommended remedies (which I have tried before). It made me feel so much more self assured in my body! Before that, I would keep up with eating sugar and drinking coffee while I was sick.   
  
On the contrary, day 31 felt somewhat disappointing. I can't measure my weight, it's nearly impossible now, the extra water intake has caused so much water retention that according to my scale, I'm at my starting weight again, so frustrating! And I feel slightly sensitive to ibuprofen as well, therefore my glow up got disturbed because my face looks so puffy on it!   
  
I just wanted to share, and I regret that now I have to postpone the so well deserved ice cream since I don't want to abuse the very day I got better to feed the remaining bacteria in my bladder to rise again. I don't want to go back to eating sugar, but it's a treat I've been waiting for so long! 

Little comment on antibiotics: I'm not anti antibiotics, please always follow your doctor's recommendations regarding antibiotics! They are NOT evil, but repeated exposure to antibiotics is unhealthy in itself and should be reduced to a minimum! I just dislike how they would destroy all the healthy gut bacteria plus due to repeated bladder infections there used to be times where I would need to swap antibiotics so the bacteria couldn't become resistant to it.

I tried cutting back on coffee, cutting back on liquids, and even taking some pills, but nothing really helped.  
  
After that, I began monitoring my food and drink intake and discovered a few minor details that had a significant impact:  
  
I avoid some watery foods at dinner, drink the majority of my water early in the day, and do some light movement and relaxation before bed.  
Getting into bed at the same time each night

By Naz and Anisha

More than 800 people added their voice, calling out the racist Herald Sun and Daily Telegraph headlines that targeted the Chinese community, and demanding greater media accountability.

Hundreds of people shared their concerns and how these headlines impacted their lives:

“As someone who has been targeted with racist abuse, it horrifies me that in this day and age media outlets continue to stoke the flames of racism. Please do not let this go without consequences for these newspapers.”

“My family and I are of Cambodian Chinese descent. Recently we were aggressively stared at in anger while we were at our normal coffee place. People looked at Asian looking people as if we are all infectious. Something bad may happen soon and there is no value to whipping up this frenzy.”

“There is nothing more degrading than using other’s suffering as an excuse for racism. Journalism needs regulations.”


In our complaint to the Press Council, we showed that the Herald Sun and Daily Telegraph’s headlines went against the Council’s Advisory Guidelines regarding the reporting of race, and health and medical matters.

Not only that, the headlines breached several of the Press Council’s General Principles. These included the need for published content to be fair and balanced, not misleading, and not contributing to ‘substantial offence, distress or prejudice’.


The Press Council’s Principles and Guidelines are important standards that uphold the standards and integrity of journalism. NewsCorp has flagrantly broken the rules with no thought for our communities.

And as we have seen over the last few weeks, Asian Australian communities are definitely feeling the impact of the newspaper headlines.

Other media outlets are reporting a sharp increase in racist attitudes towards Asian Australians – with people being harassed and made to feel unsafe. This is also clear in many of the stories shared with us.

The racist Herald Sun and Daily Telegraph front pages clearly have real world effects and NewsCorp cannot be allowed to get off lightly.

Our communities should never be targeted simply because of what we look like, or where we’re from.

Our complaint, with concerns and stories from people across the country, makes a statement that racist media will not be tolerated and must be held accountable.

With our complaint on its way to be assessed by the Press Council, we now wait to see what action will be taken. Stay tuned!

I’ve been on HRT since 12/09/23.

I am deeply longing for emotional connection & love, not sex. An EQUAL partnership. Something uncomplicated for once that makes me really feel content & safe, and feel like I’ve got a competent trusted person next to me who won’t break my heart for the millionth time. A life with a beautiful young woman by my side who won’t hurt me physically, emotionally, or financially like past partners.

Big into Video Games, RPGs, movies, WWII, reading, photography, shooting, bike riding, urban exploration. 

I’m pretty shy, a little chubby but trying to work out more. I do suffer from Psoriasis but it’s mostly under control with medication. I hate smoking of tobacco, and usually only drink socially. 420 friendly as long as it isn’t your entire personality like my ex.

I love helping others. I admit, I need help with my social skills because of my upbringing, but I'm learning fast.

I’m only attracted to feminine appearing people. Not looking for anyone over 30 or under 21 unless showing a good level of maturity.

Not looking for long distance, I deeply crave non-sexual physical intimacy & fun activities together.

I am a switch. I am NOT Poly, only monogamous.

Many years ago I was waiting at Powells in Portland for a coffee being made and I read a small 4-panel comic book from their comic section. It was about 4 different people boarding a ship that I think was called ""The Albatross"" in search for something. I think it ended with a mass hallucination/gas leak? And each character dying.

I think about this book once month. I cannot find it. It was four panels at time I think, with very simple linework, something like a Jeffery Brown comic.

After all these years I feel like it has become my own personal Albatross. I've searched for years to no avail. Any chance you may have come across it?",1,1760399391.0,comicbooks,1,1.0,False

I’m currently 13 weeks pregnant with an unplanned and unexpected baby. My partner and I haven’t been together too long, but have known each other for 2+ years and felt confident moving from a great friendship and into a relationship. Baby happened a lot sooner then we wanted but we both agreed we would like to have kids so even though it was a shock, the pregnancy was welcomed. 

However the last 10 weeks have honestly been brutal. I struggled with really bad nausea, vomiting and extreme fatigue which made doing literally anything nearly impossible. Thankfully I felt loads better 3 weeks ago and could resume mostly normal
life.

I knew things weren’t going well with him: he wasn’t helpful at all with my symptoms, never cooked when I could tolerate food, didn’t clean, didn’t run any errands, literally I had to instruct him to do anything and even then he really didn’t help. Meanwhile even when super sick, I’m still running my business, managing a catering company (2 separate things), working catering and coffee shop, cooking for myself, taking care of the dogs, etc.

Fast forward and last week he’s been having suicidal thoughts… and I have no idea what to do. I’ve had mental health issues in the past so I know how it feels and I need him to heal and get better. And I’m so friggen exhausted. He won’t talk to anyone about what’s going on besides me, and I’m honestly just at my capacity. I really don’t know what to do or how to help him when I’m dealing with all my own day to day plus pregnancy. And it doesn’t help that he doesn’t know what he needs and really hasn’t made any changes, even little ones like cutting back on doom scrolling. 

I really want to support him. I just don’t know how and honestly my patience is so low. Any thoughts or advice? ",1,1760399091.0,pregnant,4,1.0,False

I think about this book once month. I cannot find it. It was four panels at time I think, with very simple linework, something like a Jeffery Brown comic.

I'm Berikai as you know me, or you can call me by my artist name [Verdant](https://soundcloud.com/verdantbass) as well, the guy that made the theme editor!

After the release of Bitwig Studio 6.0 Beta 1, I started working on a new version of the theme editor because the old editor wasn't really compatible by the algorithm it was based on.   
  
I believe the new version is in a state where it can be finally replaced with the old one. So, I introduce you the new version of theme editor!

# What's Changed

* Self-explanatory experience enhancements for non-technical users
* Added native editor UI, no need to use a seperate [WebUI](https://bitwig.berikai.dev)
* Dynamic/real-time color change support
* New theme file format
* Gradient disabling support
* Additional compatibility option for old themes to work with Bitwig 6.x

...

I welcome anyone who is interested in to open an issue, submitting a pull request, or any kind of contribution!

Happy theming ❤️

I have not smelled the originals of any of this group, so I’m evaluating on their own merits. using highly scientific enquiry, of course.



**eau matcha:** sadly, I do not have this decant anymore. I let a friend try it, and she liked it so much that I figured we could share it. however as she lives in norway it was relatively impractical to get it from her to write a ""proper"" review. but for me this is either large decant or FB-worthy once I’ve got spring/summer scents on my mind again. it’s a bit green without being “freshie” (I am growing to truly dislike that word) and hits such a unique spot relative to other fragrances.

I would wear this for:

* times my other scents get that tiktok mouth and eyes overlay saying “it’s too hot for us and you know it”
* feeling a little cosy but not too rich
* when I want caffeine but don’t feel like having coffee

suffering level if I wore this whilst hungover: 💀💀



**vanille fraiche:** I kinda can’t get over how Generic Dude Wearing Nice Clothes this smells. if you are a current or aspiring member of this group, I would probably recommend it. it says “I’ve gotten at least one item of clothing tailored in my lifetime and my toenails are consistently not scary.” does that give you an incredible insight into the specific notes you will experience with this fragrance? no, but there are better schnozzes for that. many of them are even attached to members of this subreddit!

I would wear this for:

* I would not, but I respect your choices.

suffering level if I wore this whilst hungover: 💀💀💀💀\* (\*secondhand, when after-work drinks downtown would occasionally turn into a VERY late night. oopsie.)



**ambre vanille:** have you ever smelled masa close up? this legit smells like fresh corn tortillas. do I love that smell? yes. is it what I was expecting? what do you think??

update: 15 mins later, it smells like… sweet corn tortillas. this threw me for a loop and I had to wash it off out of pure confusion. update 2: gave it another chance a few days later, there’s something I *almost* really like in there but it’s just tootilla for me.

I would wear this for:

* method actor training for a quesadilla role
* punishment when my jokes are too corny

suffering level if I wore this whilst hungover: 💀💀💀 (good motivation to obtain mexican food stat though)



**imaginary:** like all former pitchfork kids, there is a contrarian snob whispering in my ear from time to time. that voice says, “anything broadly palatable must be bland. and boring.” it also says “beware, beware the hype shark! once people with Inferior Taste know of which you speak, the shark approacheth. and if they love it… the hype shark will be jumped and you must never return, lest you become one of the dreaded Mainstream! oOoOoOo!!” (the latter likely closer to halloween and/or after a few glasses of wine).

all of that is to say

OK FINE IT SMELLS NICE. I WAS SO READY TO BE MEH BC HYPE BUT I KEEP GETTING WHIFFS AND IT IS IN FACT A LOVELY SMELL. I assumed the drydown would be sharper, maybe more in your face fresh/citrus, and instead it’s gentle and a bit… dreamy? flirting with sweetness in a very enjoyable way. I get why so many people love it, and tbh I am ON BOARD. I’d rather just about anyone smell like this instead of being an aggro cologniser.

I would wear this for:

* a contrast to my usual witchy/goth/punk bullshit
* daytime events with my partner’s family
* see below ⬇️

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1760398535.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1o5zqb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1o5zqb4/im_the_moh_but_i_feel_useless_rant/,I’m the MOH but I feel useless..  rant..,"TLDR: I was chosen as MOH because of how long I’ve known her, but it feels like she’s way closer to the other bridesmaids and have them helping way more than me, and I feel like she doesn’t really like me as a friend anymore.. 



The bride and I have been friends for over a decade and we’ve told each other we’d be each others MOH since forever ago, like young 20 somethings. This is also the first wedding party I’ve ever been in- and I admit, I’m a bit clueless. 

Life happens and we’d hang out a couple times a year or more because we live sort of far and work off schedules. Her other brides maids live close but some live just as far and she seems to hang with them often. I try to make efforts to see her and sometimes it just doesn’t pan out. I know she’s been occupied by the wedding so it’s been tough to just see her one on one- and when we do, it kind of feels forced?

Bach party was okay, I really tried my best but it felt like the bride had no trust in my planning even though I found out the address of the Airbnb they booked, found all the things around the area, made a google doc with the brides Pinterest boards, searched for activities and whatnot. 

She ended up telling me she was putting another two bridesmaids in charge and it broke my heart.. I cried about it- a lot. But I gladly let the other two do their thing because this is her wedding. It was a little bumpy and I ended up still involved in the planning because their ideas were drifting away from the bride’s vision. 

Her other bridesmaids have a lot in common with interests and go to cons or grab coffee/ thrift together (though I really enjoy these things too). It feels like she’s been recruiting them for more duties than me even though I’ve offered and had an open line for her to reach out to. I kind of don’t know what to do as the MOH besides what I’ve been reading online. 

She’s had a couple bridesmaids help her make stuff for the wedding, others go to fittings (I was at the one where she purchased it, though some have been more often than me), others planned separately to use their places for rehearsals, and others are running errands with her before the date- which feels like duty splitting, but I would have loved to make her things or go shopping with her.

Maybe I’m just over thinking it.. because I do have ridiculous anxiety. I feel like we don’t talk like we used to and I’m dreading swallowing the pill that we’re just simply not as close as we used to be or that we may end up going our separate ways. I love her so much and she’ll always be my best friend, but sometimes I feel like she doesn’t enjoy being my friend anymore  :( ",1,1760398046.0,weddingplanning,3,1.0,False

1o5zpnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/SVTHeart/comments/1o5zpnu/second_svt_after_2_years_live_with_it_or_give/,Second SVT after 2 years - live with it or give ablation a go,"I’ve just had my second episode after 2 years - thinking I had got away with it just being a once off. 42M, all accounts fit and healthy. 

My second episode was just like my first. Heart rate shot up to 210. Lasted for about 15 minutes. Self resolved after lying on my back. No obvious triggers apart from a coffee in the morning - but I always have coffee. 

My bloods come back fine. I had my heart checked with an ultrasound 2 years ago - fine. ECG’s both times always been fine once it has passed. I’m being referred to an electrophysiologist next - guessing an option may be ablation. 

Ablation freaks me out to be honest. A friend has had it - didn’t work. Another has choosing not to have it and just deals with it when it comes on (she gets them more frequently). 

Just wondering what people here live with it, how you go about living with it? Any lifestyle changes that contribute to it not returning as often (alcohol, coffee etc)? Thanks all.

1o5znzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o5znzq/a_friend_stood_me_up_today/,A “friend” stood me up today,"Hey Reddit, for context:

We wanted to meet up on Sunday to have coffee, but she canceled because she wasn’t feeling well. We rescheduled to today at 3 and I got stood up. Here is the chat between us:

[13.10.25, 12:53:33] Me: Hello, when would you roughly be there? I still have class until 2.

[13.10.25, 14:58:45] Me: Hello? I’m waiting here and my battery’s slowly dying :(

[13.10.25, 15:30:24] Me: I’m going home now. I really think it’s disrespectful — if you don’t feel like it or can’t make it, you could at least let me know.

[13.10.25, 16:22:22] Her: I was in the hospital and obviously didn’t have my phone with me, but thanks for thinking that way about me.

[13.10.25, 16:49:58] Me: Hey, I think it’s best if we just talk about this on the phone. Please call me back when you’re ready to talk.

[13.10.25, 16:59:53] Her: I can’t right now.

[14.10.25, 00:07:00] Me: Hey,
I couldn’t have known that you were in the hospital — I’m not a mind reader. Instead of just telling me, your message immediately came with a reproach. I would’ve wished that you tried to put yourself in my position a little. I was really hurt, sad, and angry in that moment because, from my perspective, it looked like you just left me hanging.

I understand that you felt attacked by what I said, but my reaction wasn’t because I see you that way — it’s because I know many people who act exactly like that in similar situations. In that moment, I just felt like my experiences and feelings as a person didn’t matter.

Despite everything, I hope you’re feeling better now and that it wasn’t anything serious at the hospital.

[14.10.25, 00:34:35] Her: If a person has never stood me up before and then doesn’t respond for hours, normally you don’t assume they’re ghosting you — you think something happened. I even told you yesterday that I wasn’t feeling well, so why would I ghost you the next day? I really didn’t appreciate being judged like that. I fainted earlier and didn’t have the strength for more stress, that’s why I didn’t call back.

[14.10.25, 00:49:34] Me: That’s exactly why I just wrote that this is a general trust issue I have — and on top of that, I’m not in great mental shape myself right now.

It’s totally fine if you don’t want to or can’t respond right away.
And I wrote that you should just call me back when you’re ready. I wanted to give you your space and not push you too much — and I think I did that pretty well.

This message was just to show you my perspective on everything. Right now, I feel pressured by you because I honestly can’t tell what you want at the moment. I don’t want an apology; I just want you to understand why I’m thinking this way — just a bit of empathy.

By the way, it sounds really serious that you just fainted like that. I don’t even know what to say. I hope you’ll feel better soon.

[14.10.25, 01:02:04] Me: I didn’t want to hurt you like that, and it honestly wasn’t easy for me to interpret things this way. I’m just a guy, and we need things to be said directly sometimes. Today really got to me too. Please tell me openly and honestly what’s going on once you’re ready. Take some time for yourself first. I honestly don’t know how to handle this right now, and we’re not getting anywhere like this. I’d like you to reach out to me because I feel like I’m putting too much pressure on you right now.

——

I honestly don’t know what to say and I am kind of speechless, I also feel kind of gaslighted tbh. AITAH here?

Edit: Thank you for the responses, it was a reality check. I deleted the last two messages and texted her that I am sorry for hurting her feelings like this and that it was inappropriate of me for not immediately asking if she was okay",1,1760397871.0,AITAH,27,0.67,False

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone that I loved and cared about 

I need a strong emotional and intellectual connection with someone as well this is very important to me also as well as being intimate it’s not just about being intimate 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Please read my post on my profile it has extra information on it that I cant post on this one!

1o5zn23,https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/1o5zn23/entitled_mom_poisons_petting_zoo_animals/,entitled mom poisons petting zoo animals,"I want to appologise in advance for any spelling errors.

  
I worked at my local petting zoo for about three years and in that time I have seen my fair share of entitled parents.

this particular story took place in autumn of last year. 

for context a little layout of the farm. there is a large field the goats roam during clear weather, a big barn that includes stables for the goates, horses and donkeys, three pens for our rabbits and guinea pigs, our office, kitchen and supplies. people can walk arround there and look at the animals when they are indoors, next to the barn is a small cafe for parents to drink coffee while their children play.

It was a cold and rainy day so it was just me, two of my co workers and a mother with her son on the farm that day (not counting the workers in our small cafe).

me and my co workers where outside in the field gathering leaves and putting them in a pile outside the gate since the leaves are poisonous for our goats. normaly one of us was inside the barn to keep an eye on the vissitors but since it was just the one mother and her son we figured they wouldn't cause any trouble like bigger groups of people would ussualy do. after about an hour of us cleaning the field we returned to the barn. As soon as we walked in we noticed that the entire barn was coverd in hay and straw. we kept the haybales and strawbales inside the stable behind a red and white chain with a sign infront of it that said ''DO NOT TOUCH'' in big letters. we where kind of annoyed but it happend a lot so I just walked towards the supply room to get a broom. 

across from the supply room was out kitchen where we kept all the animals food, the door has two huge stickers on it that say ""KEEP OUT'' and ''NO ENTRY''. I noticed the door was open while I cleary remember closing it before heading to the field. I stept into the kitchen to see multiple bags and containers out of place. I instantly remembered seeing the mother and her child feeding the goats from a small plastic cup earlier while I was working, I didn't think anything of it at the time because we have two gummbal machines (for lack of a better word) filled with kibble for the goats. for 50 cents people can get a small cup of kibble that is bassicly just compressed grass and feed it to the goats. When I realised they most likely didn't have the money for the machine and had just grabbed some from the kitchen I kind of pannicked. If the wrong animal gets the wrong food they can get sick. But the thing that really made me freak out was the bag that was opend. It was a bag of small brown pellets that we used in the donkeys pen underneath the straw because they had the habbit of peeing right next to the fence and the pebbles soaked up the pee and prevented it from leaking out of their pen. If these people had fed the moister absorbing pellets to an animal they could get really sick, esspecialy the horses. our horses are very prone to colic, for people who don't know colic is a problem in the stomach caused by gas or blockage and can be deadly for a horse.

  
after I told my co workers and they pannick for a bit we went to find the entiteld mother, who at that point was drinking coffee while her son was playing on the playground. We brought the bag to her and asked her if she had fed the pellets to any animals. she denied doing it or even going into our kitchen so we knew she was lying. We walked back to our office and decided to check the security camera's and low and behold the camera's showed the mother and her son feeding very familliar looking brown pellets to one of the horses. after we confronted her about it she told us: ""well yeah I grabbed some from your kitchen because the machines are just way to expensive and my son deserves to feed the animals. we kindly asked her to leave. 

  
A couple hours later the horse she had fed started showing signs of colic, rolling on the ground and touching his nose to his belly. We inmidiatly called the vet and told him the whole story. 

The horse is fine now but we still had to pay an expensive vet bill so that mother could save 50 cents.

  
Please never feed an animal that is not your own and esspecialy don't feed them something without reading the package of the product.

  
I have a lot more stories from the petting zoo so if people like this one I might just post more of them.",20,1760397801.0,entitledparents,5,0.93,False

Also the reason why I talk about House of the Dragon lol.

**Section One: Assets and Debt**

I'm a recent medical school grad, so my finances are not looking great. I have and am supporting my family financially, so I have about $230k in debt after undergrad and med school. This included the purchase of a car, which also doubles as the family car.

**Section Two: Income**

I am a new first year resident, so this is my first year making income! I've dabbled in summer jobs doing research and I worked in uni and high school as a tutor, but nothing significant.

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:**

During PGY1 I was making about $4200 per month as take home.

**Section Three: Expenses**

Rent $750 to my parents

Donations $20/month

Gym membership $45/month

Car payment/insurance/gas/parking $300/month for insurance, $125/month for gas, $110 for parking at work. Car payment is just part of my line of credit so it's not really a separate expense

I also just pick up the tab whenever I'm out with my parents eg. grocery shopping, gas, at a restaurant. 

**MONDAY**

9:45 am. My eyes unfortunately open of their own accord, and I contemplate trying to sleep again before giving up and committing to waking up. I’m working the overnight shift today so I have a sleep schedule I’m supposed to follow, but alas I have failed. I eat leftover pizza from yesterday, start getting ready for the day, and pack, as I slept over at a friend’s house last night.

10:30 am. We get a free textbook every year of residency and I’m picking mine up today, so I head over to the hospital to get it.

11:15 am. The textbook is in my hands! I am so excited to start reading and studying. I chit chat with our administrative staff for a bit before driving home.

11:35 am. I’m trying to be more organised, so I unpack as soon as I get home, and tidy up a little bit. I take off the plastic on my textbook and I couldn’t be more excited.

12 pm. I have some calls to make and I don’t like making calls so I bundled them all up for now. One of them is to book a car service appointment, because my engine light is on…

12:30 pm: Time to eat lunch, which is plain Greek yogurt with granola. I have been loving this combination for a lighter meal at the start of the day. While I eat I start watching yesterday’s episode of *House of the Dragon*, which I missed because I was out with my friends.

1 pm: I asked my Emergency Medicine resident friend E for advice on how to prepare for an overnight shift, and she told me to either take one long nap during the day or to take two naps, so here I am with nap #1.

3:15 pm: I jolt awake to my alarm, because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to take nap #2 if I slept for too long. I decide to head to the local library to go for a walk out in the summer sun and fit some studying in before my shift.

5 pm: The library is closing so I pack my books. I’m happy with what I’ve been able to accomplish. I spent the last few days perfecting my pages on Notion and creating a study schedule, which tells me which two chapters to read each week. I finished reading and taking notes for one chapter in an hour, which I consider good going.

5:15 pm: For dinner is rice with a soft tofu dish of my mother’s creation, which I spice up with Tabasco because I will take any opportunity to put Tabasco on food. I finish watching *House of the Dragon* and spend time on the Internet reading about what the people are saying, which turns into me spending time on the Internet, period.

7 pm: Time for nap #2. It’s honestly not difficult for me to fall asleep because I am pretty tired.

9:45 pm: I am begrudgingly woken up by my alarm, and I contemplate my life decisions that led me to working this overnight shift before I suck it up and get out of bed. I do a quick abs workout (Alexis Ren) before eating my fourth meal of the day: pesto pasta, which I drizzle Tabasco sauce on. I change into scrubs, put makeup on, and pack my bag with my stethoscope, badge, laptop, pen, and some snacks in case I get hungry. I almost forget to have a quick cup of coffee but remember in the nick of time.

11:15 pm: I’m off for work! My body is definitely confused about being awake at this hour. I meet up with the team for tonight and start work right at 12.

**$0**

**TUESDAY**

8:15 am: End of shift. My sleep schedule worked, so thank you E. Blearily I drive back home, eat some more pesto pasta, and wash up before crashing at 9:30.

1:30 pm: I startle awake with the feeling I’ve slept for too long, and even when I figure it out I’m still disoriented. I eat pesto with tofu noodles before getting ready to leave. I belatedly remember it’s my friend’s birthday today, and I send him a happy birthday message along with a Starbucks gift card. **$25**

3:00 pm: I have some errands to run today, and I want to walk there. I’ve gotten much lazier ever since I learned how to drive, but walking has so many benefits: exercise, fresh air, time with my thoughts. I run into the most gorgeous sunflowers on my walk, and this small happiness stays with me the rest of the day.

3:30 pm: I have a dentist appointment. I half-heartedly watch *Gilmore Girls* on the TV before it becomes impossible. I have new insurance with work, so I don’t know how much it costs, but the clerk says she’ll email me if there’s a difference.

4:30 pm: I head next door to the grocery store. They have a 10% student discount on Tuesdays, so I try to take advantage of that as much as I can. I plan to make a pasta salad, couscous salad, and an icebox cake this week. It ends up costing **$60.90.**

5:30 pm: I get to use my new Baggu bags I bought recently, and their stylish nature powers me through the walk home. I have weak arms, so this kind of counts as a workout. I pause several times, but eventually make it home.

6 pm: My sister called me while I was walking back, so I call her back and we chit chat. She doesn’t live in the same city, so it’s nice to catch up. We talk for a bit before I hang up to take my second nap of the day.

9:45 pm: My alarm wakes me up, and I contemplate my life decisions that led me to working this overnight shift for the second night in a row before I suck it up and get out of bed. I do my abs workout, eat curry that my mom made, and get ready for work. I’m faster now that I’m in more of a routine.

11:15 pm: I leave for work. The best thing about working at off hours is that there’s no traffic. I meet up with tonight’s team and we get to it.

**$85.90**

**WEDNESDAY**

3:35 am: Our electronic medical record system is hilariously down for maintenance from 3-4 am, so after I see a patient my staff says to take a break. I eat an apple and chat with the fellow I’m working with. I contemplate stealing a popsicle from the fridge (bribery for children) but I’m not really hungry, so I decide against it.

8 am: My staff sends me home first and right on time, which is nice of her. I have to pick up a new badge with my photo and name on it, as my current one is just a generic resident badge. The drive home takes longer than usual because there’s been an accident, and I’m slightly uncomfortable driving because I’m really tired. But I make it home safely, eat more curry, wash up, and pass out by 9:30.

4 pm: I don’t set an alarm because I have to flip my sleep schedule, but I sleep a bit more than I thought. I wake up to see that a social for the juniors of my program is being rescheduled as half of my co-residents can’t make it, and there’s a rainstorm outside. I’m mildly disappointed but I get over it after eating more pesto pasta.

4:45 pm: I catch up on writing this post, and debate about my plans for the evening. I don’t have much brain power available to me, so I do some administrative tasks, take some notes from my textbook, and chill.

7 pm: I’m feeling really full after my dinner, so I go for a walk. It’s cool since it rained, and I’m inspired to listen to the *Happier* podcast by Gretchen Rubin as I’m currently reading her book *The Happiness Project*.

7:45 pm: I have many possibilities of things I can do, like work on more notes or work out, but I’m exhausted at the prospect so I decide to wash up early so I can sleep whenever I want to.

10:30 pm: I end up staying up later than anticipated because I’m engrossed in reading *The Happiness Project*. I read it for the first time when I was in middle school, and it’s interesting to see how my thoughts have changed now more than a decade later. My hopes I can fall asleep are for naught as I sleep right away when I turn the lights off.

**$0**

**THURSDAY**

8 am: Unfortunately I wake up with a tummy ache but it somewhat improves as I work out (arms and abs) and eat yogurt with granola for breakfast.

9 am: When I have the time, I like to start my day by checking social media, looking at my to do list, and updating my YNAB. I then get started on taking more notes from my textbook.

10 am: That was done faster than I expected, which is good because I’m feeling somewhat pressed for time today. I switch to the kitchen to cook couscous salad, which is a delicious meal I first had at my friend’s house in April and delightfully easy to make.

11:10 am: I’ve realised I need to clean the house before my friend comes over for a dinner party tomorrow and I don’t have much time to do it, so hastily I clean as much as I can before sitting down to eat my salad, which is as good as I remember! 

12:40 pm: After I’m all dressed up I pop into a coffee shop, order a green tea (**$3.10**), and study there for a few hours before heading to the grocery store in search of red plums and a loaf pan. I can only find black plums and my loaf pan isn’t quite the right size and they’re all hideously expensive, but I buy them (**$24.03**).

5 pm: I’m home and I take a breather to write some notes for this article before I freshen up and leave for dinner. I’m excited and nervous because I’m paying for my parents’ dinner with my first paycheque from residency so I want my parents to have a good night. They’ve never been here before and they can be picky, but thankfully they find everything delicious, as I do! Two drinks, two pastas, one main, and a dessert end up being **$215.60** including a good tip.

7:45 pm: I drive home by myself because we arrived here separately, and I feel oddly emotional. I’m just really happy and grateful and lucky that I’m in this position and able to do this for my parents, who have struggled so much for me and my sister. I purposefully play “Never Grow Up” by Taylor Swift and I do tear up.

8:30 pm: Home and I am so full! The plan is to sleep as soon as possible because I have a 6 am shift tomorrow, but I get distracted starting *Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe* and end up sleeping around 11 pm instead.

**$242.73**

**FRIDAY**

4 am: I’m grumpy to be awake and I’m grumpy to not have my paycheque, because that was going to be the motivator for my early morning shift. I eat my yogurt and granola, pull myself together, and leave by 5:15 am to start my shift at 6 am. 

2 pm: I’m done my shift! I got to repair a laceration which was cool; suturing is fun. My sense of time is so off, but I’m thrilled to be done earlyish in the day. I pick up a new work badge and head home. I’m also delighted to see that I have now been paid. I nap when I get home, ha.

7 pm: I’m inviting my friend over for dinner tomorrow, so I make a quick icebox cake from Claire Saffitz’s *What’s for Dessert* cookbook. I also do a quick ab work out, study a bit, and then pass out around 11.

**$0**

**SATURDAY**

6:15 am: I wake up exhausted. At least it’s a daytime shift today. My mom makes avocado toast with poached eggs which I drown in ketchup and Tabasco and it’s delicious. I get ready and leave for work.

8 am: I meet the team and get started! I’m working mostly with a senior resident today.

3:45 pm: An early end to the day, but it was a heavy shift because of a patient’s death. I cried during my shift, and my team is very supportive and makes sure I know I can reach out if I ever need extra support. I manage to get it together for the second half of the shift but then I cry a bit on the way home.

4:30 pm: Frantic cleaning of the house in preparation for dinner! This should’ve been done yesterday, but so be it.

6 pm: Dinnertime with my friend outside in the garden! On the menu is a bunch of delicious Korean foods my mom made, including army base stew, japchae, and bulgogi with a side of Moscato (our favourite wine) and the icebox cake I made yesterday.

7:15 pm: After dinner, we go for a nice walk and then come back to watch episode 12 of *Lovely Runner*, a kdrama we’ve been watching together. Unfortunately, the latest episodes haven’t been it compared to the addictive nature of the beginning episodes.

9:30 pm: My friend leaves, I wash up, and I’m passed *out* by 10:30 pm.

**$0**

**SUNDAY**

6:30 am: I slept so deeply last night, and I feel so well rested having slept in a little bit. Have the standard avocado toast for breakfast and get ready for my last shift.

8 am: I unexpectedly get pulled to a different area of the ED because they’re short-staffed, but my new staff is lovely and it’s a relaxed shift. I have curry for lunch, and end my last ever Peds ED shift.

4 pm: I take a quick hour nap, eat some plain yogurt and granola, then go for a walk around the block with my parents. I’m grateful to have the nice weather and time with them while I can.

6:40 pm: I call one of my long-distance best friends every week! Usually I take the opportunity to do chores at the same time but I’m too exhausted so I just lie down. It’s nice to catch up and just check in. After we’re done calling I read more of *Aristotle and Dante* while waiting to watch *HOTD* with my sister. 

10:30 pm: It’s a pretty good episode, saved by the last 15 minutes which is sick. I’m buzzed after watching it, and need to look up what the people online are saying. I’m not too tired so I end up finishing *Aristotle and Dante*, which makes me cry actually. Then I force myself to sleep.

**REFLECTION**

This was a very atypical week because I knew I was writing this post, Hawthorne effect and all that. I tried extra hard to be productive haha, but it was also a busy work week as I had a lot of my shifts bunched together in this week. As I said previously this post is actually from one year ago so it's actually interesting for me to look back on. My life is very different from what it was one year ago, some good and some bad, but either way this was the beginning of my residency!

1o5zjhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MildlyHauntedOG/comments/1o5zjhj/step_count/,#Step Count,"The First Step

It started on a Tuesday.

A wrinkle across my forehead that hadn’t been there the night before. By the time I’d made coffee, my knees ached. By noon, my reflection looked several years older.

On my way to the store, I passed a woman in a black coat. She smiled faintly, tilting her head as I passed.

“How many steps have you taken today?” she asked.

I didn’t answer. By the time I turned around, she was gone.

The Rule

I walk everywhere. No bike, no public transportation, just walking. So, it only took about three days to figure out the formula.

Every step aged me — not years, but days. I counted them. Eight thousand steps in a day, and I lost about two months.

Standing still became a religion. I shuffled only when necessary, slid my feet to avoid “real” steps, and even then, I felt time sliding off me like loose skin.

The Gift

On the fourth day, a man tried to mug me outside the corner store.

In the struggle, the knife went in deeper than I meant it to. His eyes rolled back, and I felt it — like a flood bursting through my veins.

My spine straightened. My skin smoothed. My breath came easy. I was thirty again.

When I looked up from his body, the woman in the black coat was standing at the mouth of the alley. She smiled, then turned and walked away without a word.

The Experiment

I needed to know if it was a fluke.

I took a walk — three blocks — and felt the years stack on my bones like wet sandbags. My hands shook as I picked my next target: a drunk outside the bar, slumped against the wall.

One push into the alley, one sharp twist, and the youth poured back into me.

 

It was real.

The System

I moved differently after that.

Every step became an investment. A withdrawal. I wouldn’t waste them on trips to the store or idle wandering. Every step had to end with a life in my hands.

I learned the math:

Eight thousand steps cost me two months.

One death bought me back three years.

You can’t tell me that’s not a “good return”.

The Hunger

I stopped thinking of them as people.

They were clocks. Walking, talking hourglasses I could smash open whenever I felt the tick in my bones.

At first, I tried to spread it out — one a week, maybe two. But the rush… the rush was the problem. I’d walk just for the excuse to kill, and then I’d kill just to walk again.

Soon my apartment smelled like copper and rot. The floorboards warped under the weight.

Sometimes I’d catch a glimpse of her in a window’s reflection — the black coat, the smile. Watching.

The Mistake

Then one night, I woke choking. My chest felt like a collapsed tent, skin sagging from my arms. I hadn’t taken a single step that day.

Somewhere in the dark, a footstep landed. Slow. Heavy.

Another.

And with each one, the years drained out of me like water down a sink.

The Last Step

When the door opened, I couldn’t see their face — only the knife in their hand.

And the way their eyes lit up like mine had, that first time.

 

In the corner of the room, she stood in her black coat. Not watching me — watching them.

“Keep count,” she told them softly.

Then she stepped back into the dark.",1,1760397540.0,MildlyHauntedOG,0,1.0,False
1o5zidw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContractorCorner1/comments/1o5zidw/finally_did_it_got_a_patio_cover_in_nashville/,Finally did it. Got a patio cover in Nashville. Totally changed my backyard life.,"Okay, so I used to think my backyard was fine. Decent chairs. A table. Cheap umbrella that flew away every time the wind picked up.

Then summer hit. Brutal heat. Sun frying everything in sight. I’d go outside and last maybe… five minutes? Tops.

So yeah, I finally got a patio cover. Best decision I’ve made for the house, hands down.

Now I can actually sit out there. Morning coffee. Late dinners. Random naps when I should be working. Doesn’t matter if it rains or hits 90°. I’m chill. Literally.

Couple things I figured out:

– **Shade isn’t optional.** Once you have it, you realize how bad it was before.  
– **Material matters.** Nashville humidity eats wood alive. Aluminum or insulated panels hold up better.  
– **Design changes everything.** Solid roof gives full coverage. Pergola keeps it airy. Depends what you like.  
– **It adds real value.** Not just resale stuff. It *feels* like an extra room.

And yeah… it looks good.

Weather here’s unpredictable. Sun one minute, thunder the next. So having that extra cover? Peace of mind, really.

I hired **JB’s Enclosures**, local crew. They knew what they were doing. No weird sales talk. Just work, clean, done. Respect.

If your patio’s just sitting there—too hot, too wet, too boring—honestly, fix it up. Add shade. A fan. Some lights. Make it a space you *actually* use.

Feels like I added a new part to the house. Without actually building one.",1,1760397462.0,ContractorCorner1,0,1.0,False
1o5zidl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MildlyHauntedOG/comments/1o5zidl/the_last_piece/,#The Last Piece,"Mail had always been a quiet rhythm in my life. Same time, same carrier, same slow wave through the cracked blinds. There was comfort in it — a reminder the world was still running on schedule even when mine wasn’t.

 Then one morning, the cycle broke.

 Naomi.

 A beautiful brunette with light skin and a smile that seemed to warm the air around her. But her eyes… they were something else entirely. Deep, watchful, almost ancient. Looking at them felt like staring at still water while knowing something massive swam just below.

 Her smile stopped me in my tracks, though I couldn’t tell if it was welcome or dangerous. She handed me my small stack of envelopes like she was passing along something meant only for me.

 The moment she walked away, the air felt wrong, like the day had been nudged out of alignment.

 I didn’t know then my life had just shifted onto a track I could never step back from.

 Waiting for the Second Knock

The next morning, I caught myself checking the clock before I’d even had coffee. I’d never cared much about mail, but now I kept glancing toward the street, waiting for her.

Naomi.

It didn’t make sense. We’d exchanged barely a dozen words, but that smile, those eyes… they stayed with me. Not in the way a beautiful stranger lingers in your mind. This was different. She’d left a fingerprint on the day itself.

By the time her truck rounded the corner, I was already at the door. She moved slower, gaze flicking to my windows as if checking whether I was watching. Our eyes met, and her smile returned — softer, but sharper somehow.

She handed me my mail without a word. I thanked her. She held my gaze a beat too long before turning away.

Nothing unusual in the envelopes, but my hands wouldn’t stop trembling.

The Wrong Kind of Compliment

Day three. I lingered near the front window, pretending to watch the neighborhood while listening for her truck.

When it came, my pulse picked up. Sunlight caught in her hair, but today her presence had an edge — like a faint scent of metal in the air.

She smiled as always, though it didn’t reach her eyes. “Morning,” she said, brushing my fingers as she handed me the envelopes. Her skin was colder than it should have been.

Then: “You keep your blinds open. Makes it easy to see when you’re… here.”

Such an ordinary sentence. And yet it wasn’t. The way she lingered on here made my skin prickle.

I muttered something about liking sunlight, but she only walked away, her smile faintly visible over her shoulder.

For the rest of the day, I kept glancing at the window — not to see if she was there, but to make sure no one else was.

The First Envelope

On the fourth day, I didn’t wait by the window. I told myself Naomi was just a mail carrier and I was being paranoid.

Still, my breath caught when her truck pulled up.

She stepped out, eyes locked on me. No smile this time. She handed me the stack, one envelope instantly standing out — yellowed, no stamp, my name scrawled in a shaky, uneven hand.

As she walked away, she called back: “Some things don’t need postage.”

The paper was brittle. Inside was a torn photograph — a foot, bare and pale, peeling from the ground as if the skin itself was stuck. The background glowed orange, like fire close enough to burn.

And in the corner… the curve of a smile.

More Pieces

Day five, I didn’t pretend. I was waiting.

Naomi’s calm face, another yellowed envelope. No words, just that tilt of her head, as though listening for something I couldn’t hear.

Another fragment. This one a blistered hand, skin stretched unnaturally. Fitting it beside the first piece, the edges aligned perfectly. The orange glow was brighter now, more defined.

I tucked the pieces away, but they burned behind my eyes. That night I dreamed of heat, the taste of smoke, and Naomi’s voice whispering words I couldn’t quite hear.

Closing the Gap

Day six. Naomi lingered at my door.

“You’re getting close,” she said, placing three yellowed envelopes in my hand.

The first revealed ribs, skintight and splitting. The second, a jaw caught between scream and grimace. The third… an eye. My own eye. Staring up from the ground.

The puzzle was no longer random horror. It was a scene — one I somehow remembered. Heat on my skin. Gasoline in the air. The need to get free.

That night I woke gasping, convinced I heard footsteps on the porch.

The street was empty.

The Last Piece

Day seven. No sleep. The puzzle spread before me like a wound.

Naomi arrived without her uniform, in a long black coat. Only one envelope.

“It’s time,” she said.

The last fragment slid into place. My body, twisted on asphalt. Fire swallowing the wreck of my car.

I remembered everything — the screech, the impact, the gasoline rain.

Naomi stepped closer, shadow falling across me. “You’ve been here a while. You just didn’t want to see it.”

The room looked wrong — dust where there shouldn’t be, air too still to breathe.

Naomi offered her hand. “It’s time to go.”

 

I took it. The walls dissolved into darkness. The photograph burned behind my eyes.

This wasn’t my home.

The title looks like troll but I swear it's not, and since I'm French we don't use the exact same terminology for social struggles, so maybe I'm in the wrong due to misconception, but I feel like I'm not

In my workplace, and in a lot of other workplaces, there are coffee dispensers.

Those coffee dispensers are means of production owned by investors who extract a ""plus-value"" without actual work, due to their previous speculation consisting of advancing costs in the hope of meeting a market (here, work colleagues)

In my workplace, and in a lot of other workplaces, employees have organized themselves so they didn't have to pay for expensive trash coffees, knowing some of the paid price would finance dispenser's owners pockets.

They collectivized their own mean of production, not by expropriating the dispenser's owner, but by setting up their own : they contributed equally to their own coffee machine.

While they had to pay a certain amount of money at the beginning, they know have the ability to produce their own coffee for cheaper, at a better quality, and the coffee dispenser basically went bankrupt.

I feel like this simple strategy could show us a way to establish gradually a peaceful socialist pre-revolution (freeing Global South can't be peaceful I guess) : since capitalists have an enormous military and ideological power, it might be tedious to simply expropriate the bourgeois to collectivize the means of production they possess.

But, if we extrapolate the coffee machine situation, I'm pretty sure that it would be easy for people to handle more and more of the production of the goods they need.

If 20 colleagues can organize themselves the production of their own coffee, 200 neighbours could potentially organize themselves the production of their own bread by buying hovens, equipment, and giving fair wages to bakers.  
2000 inhabitants of a small city could invest in their own farm, not to get dividends from it, but crop and meat while giving a fait wage to farmers  
20 000 cinephiles could organize to contribute equally to financing their own movie studio, while ""employing"" fairly young film makers, to finance the movies they will see later

Etc

I am not inventing anything here, the thing is, by the times people thought about this for the first time, there was no credit card, no way to communicate efficiently from afar, no electronic systems.

1o5z9g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1o5z9g5/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriends_friend_at_our/,AITA for not wanting my boyfriend’s friend at our wedding because of how he behaved with me?,"Hey fellow potatoes 🥔, I (24F) and my boyfriend Larry (27M) have been together for 7 years. We’ve always had a close circle of friends — I’m like a little sister to his group of “homies,” and we hang out sometimes.

Both of us work in the healthcare industry, but last year Larry was really burned out and wanted to start his own business. He went to a friend’s wedding or something (I honestly don’t remember the exact occasion), and when he called that evening, he mentioned he met another friend who was also interested in starting a business. Let’s call him Simon (27M).

I was so happy that Larry was finally planning to follow his dream! For about a month, he and Simon kept meeting, planning, and budgeting. Larry often talked about him — nothing weird, just updates about their work ideas.

A few weeks later, I met Simon at a café. I’m a total introvert, so I didn’t talk much — just the usual polite “hi,” “how’s work,” etc. We sat at a table; Larry was next to me, and Simon sat across from me. We got our coffees, and while they were deep in conversation, I kind of zoned out... until I suddenly felt someone staring at me.

When I looked up, Simon was smiling — not in a friendly way, but that kind of lingering look that makes you feel uncomfortable. I smiled back out of politeness, but he kept glancing at me the entire time.

After finishing my coffee, I said bye and left for my bus. On the way, Larry called me and said, “Simon said you’re amazing and pretty.” I just said, “Okay… thank you?”

Neither of us thought much about it then because Larry’s friends often make harmless compliments like “She’s so bold” or “She’s pretty,” so it didn’t seem like a big deal.

Later, Simon sent me a follow request on Instagram. I accepted it since all of Larry’s friends follow me too. Over the next few weeks, Simon started sending me memes and random reels. Nothing flirty at first, just casual.

But then, a few months later, Larry told me he was dropping their business plan because Simon had gotten into a relationship and wasn’t interested in working together anymore. And guess what? When Simon’s girlfriend cheated on him, he came crawling back to Larry — crying, venting, wanting support.

So his girlfriend had another boyfriend and he even called Simon to tell him, but Simon ignored all the red flags and believed her lies. At that same time, Simon was also flirting with another mutual friend of his and Larry’s — and he even sent her an inappropriate image. She immediately blocked him. After Larry told me that, I started keeping my distance from Simon.

After his breakup, Simon started hanging out with Larry again, and they began planning their business once more. Then, out of nowhere, Simon started sending me romantic reels and “all girls are cheaters” type of posts. I don’t know why he thought that was okay, but those reels triggered me — so I argued with him. He started explaining his breakup story and trying to gain sympathy. I told him, “Whatever, don’t you dare talk to me like that.”

I told Larry, and he brushed it off, saying Simon doesn’t know how to talk to girls and that I should ignore him. So I did. I didn’t block him immediately because my boyfriend and I use each other’s Instagram accounts, so Larry could also see Simon’s messages — though Simon doesn’t know that.

One day I told Larry, “I don’t think Simon is a loyal friend, and I feel like he’s trying to flirt with me. I don’t know if I’m just being delulu or not.” Larry didn’t believe me, so I told him to test Simon — to call him and say he’s cheating on me with another girl. If Simon was a real friend, he’d either stop him or tell me. Guess what? He didn’t. Larry tested him multiple times, and Simon never said a word.

After that, Larry started noticing Simon’s behavior — especially how he kept sharing breakup or romantic reels at midnight. Then one day, he shared a reel that really crossed the line. Larry finally blocked him on my Instagram and warned him to stay away from me.

But their friendship didn’t end there. They’re still planning business together, and Simon even has a contract for Larry’s new house that’s being built.

Oh, and one more thing — I love cars, especially BMWs. I never mentioned that to Simon, but since I often like and share car-related posts, suddenly Simon started sending me car reels — specifically BMW ones. It felt like he was watching me too closely.

Even though Simon is blocked on all my accounts, he still likes Larry’s Instagram stories the moment Larry posts my pictures. And mind you, Larry isn’t someone who posts often — the only things he ever shares are my photos or travel snaps. So yeah, Simon is clearly still lurking and paying attention to me, even through Larry.

From the very start of their friendship, I’ve felt something off about Simon. I don’t like him. I genuinely believe he’s manipulating Larry — always saying things like, “Larry is my only true friend,” or “I only wish good for him.” It feels like he’s trying to keep Larry emotionally tied to him.

I told Larry, “Please don’t talk to me about Simon anymore. I hate him.” Larry stopped mentioning him, but they still hang out. Yesterday, I asked Larry if he was inviting Simon to our wedding, and he said yes. I asked, “How can Simon even face me after everything?” And honestly, I wonder how Larry can face Simon after our conversation about me.

I told Larry straight up that I don’t want Simon at our wedding and I don’t even want to hear about him anymore. But the problem is, Simon’s company has the wedding planning contract too.

Also, I want to add a few notes:

After I resigned from my job, Larry helped me start my own business. Simon tried to involve Larry in his business again, but Larry refused because he wanted to focus on his current job.

I love Larry, and he loves me more. We’re getting married next year, and I honestly don’t know how I’ll handle seeing Simon at the wedding. I’m an introvert, but I have a very bad anger issue, and I’m afraid my “sweet little finger” might accidentally stamp on Simon’s face 😅.

Please be honest with me, potatoes — I don’t want to seem controlling, but I feel disrespected.

I honestly can’t tell if Simon is just jealous of our relationship or actually flirting with me — it’s confusing and it’s driving me crazy.


So… am I overreacting? Or is my boyfriend just ignoring my feelings for his manipulative friend?

I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? I gathered my breath and looked toward the voided ocean. I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. It must have been an old wasp nest from the summer, the worn out boards must attract them each year. Maybe I blinked and that’s what made me think I saw what I did. That didn’t explain the texture of it. If it was a dead nest, why wasn’t it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. Whatever it was, it was gone now. I certainly wasn’t going under the boardwalk to find out where it went. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. “Hello, It’s Me”, Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn’t been sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, “What’s that?”.

“Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?” he said, gesturing a chugging motion.

“Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.”

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. There’s only one way to drink it and that’s ice cold. If your local watering hole doesn’t keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don’t bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured with a heavy hand into the glass in front me, “It’s on me, buddy.” He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. After the night I had, that shot went down awfully smooth. After a brief silence, he spoke up.

“You alright, man? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my slowly racing heart. How would I even have began to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent’s.

When she saw it was me, she smiled and waved. I returned the favor and she made her way to the vacated seat next to me.

“Do you come here often?” she said with a faux twang accent.

“I-uh… reckon.” I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

I looked out around the bar to find that it was only us. Tommy was missing in action, smoking outside undoubtedly.

“Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,” she remarked with a grin.

“Tommy shouldn’t have left the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there.” I quipped. 

She laughed. “Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.”

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 “Here’s to…” I trailed off.

“Here’s to another summer in the books,” she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, “So are you local year round?”

I shook my head yes and clarified, “Haven’t always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?”

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent’s and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven’t been on one for miles.

“Enough about me, what are you up to?” A question I was dreading. Maybe it was the brandy talking, I answered very plainly, “I don’t know.”

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. “I’m just trying to figure somethings out. It’s been a very long couple of years.”

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. “Do you want to talk about it?”

I shook it off. “Not particularly, it’ll pass. Just a matter of time.”

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

“Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre’s, actually. We have one just like it.”

She looked down and declared. “That’s hilarious, that’s where I stole this from!”

We both laughed.

“It wouldn’t surprise me,” I remarked. “The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.”

Our laughter echoed the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song — “These Eyes” by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, “The Stones are my dad’s favorite band. He named me Angie after the song.” 

I liked that, it fit her.

“My dad loved them too,” I concurred. “He took me to see them when I was a kid.”

She smiled. “Sounds like a great dad to me.”

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me — maybe she’d like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

“Everything okay?” she inquired.

“Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.”

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would’ve seen it, right? Unless… did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, “Looks like I’m not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre’s.”

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone — few missed calls, few texts I didn’t care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick’s. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn’t like to be kept waiting — Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, “I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.”

Angie smiled wide. “I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?”

There was a pause. I didn’t know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn’t feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick’s.

“I’m sure you’ll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she’s good I’ll grab a slice for her this weekend.”

That was the best I could do. It was better than “Run as fast as you can.”

“Do you need me to walk you home?”

She responded, “I’m meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It’s their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.”

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. “I can wait here with her, I’m still cleaning up. I’ll see you tomorrow night.”

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit, waving goodbye. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, “You never told me your name!”

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, “It doesn’t really matter.”

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality — this one was thick and palatable. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights — an offseason signature — and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky. Living by the water teaches you to prepare for weather that changes on a dime.

I crept to the corner, hoping to get a glimpse of where my fateful fall had taken place hours before. The only thing I could make out was the beginning of the ramp that led to the boardwalk. The mixture of fog and Mick’s bright neon sign only gave me passing glimpses of Mighty King Kong’s scowl.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there — just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area — no sight of the album. It was around this time that the fog momentarily cleared that I noticed it was a full moon. If there was indeed a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning.

I decided I was being paranoid. Enough was enough. I took my phone out with resolve and took confident steps to the mouth of the boardwalk. I turned my flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took two steps forward, searching the sandy floor — nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot.

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the front of the album sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye — the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn’t stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my trembling feet prevailed. This went on forever, using the sand underneath as camouflage. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate — it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

I live in Canada and currently use a **Breville Café Roma ESP8XL**. I bought it by accident for **$25 CAD**, and after the first cup I completely fell in love with espresso. ❤️

Now I’d like to move to a better quality machine.  
I drink one espresso a day and make one cappuccino for my wife. The problem is that my shots aren’t always consistent - I use **Lavazza Oro pre-ground coffee** and don’t have a grinder yet. Also, the water flows really fast: about 10 seconds for a shot.

I also struggle with milk frothing (I use cold 10% cream). It got better after removing the steam wand tip, but still not great. Maybe it’s my technique, maybe it’s the machine.

I’m planning to buy a **used espresso machine**, budget **$300–$400 CAD**.  
I was looking at the **Gaggia Classic Pro**, but after reading about all the mods it needs, I’m not sure anymore.

My main goal: make better cappuccinos.  
I don’t mind waiting for steam or heat-up time. I just want a **stable espresso and nice milk foam**.",1,1760396520.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

They cornered me while no one else was there, aggressively confronted me, cussing and making little digs together.

I felt sick going in today but stayed quiet and focused on my work, even when they kept throwing digs — blaming me for not getting coffee for everyone, making comments like “let them have their moment.” Now the person I tried to stand up for is suddenly friendly with them again, after they were talking about them last week. That was the only other person in my department I felt like I could trust. 

The only reason I went back was because of my supervisor. I just don’t know how to handle walking back into this kind of environment every day. I’m not going to bow down to them and kiss their ass like they want me to. They had their little mask off moment, and I know who they truly are now. And I don’t want anything to do with it.

1o5z43o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1o5z43o/9_months_post_surgery_feedback_as_an_emetophobe/,9 months post surgery feedback as an emetophobe (and mostly an anxious person),"I could have done this earlier. Better late than never I imagine.

I'll write some more thoughts on emetophobia specifically at the end, I'm gonna start with an attempt at a timeline.

My recovery went ok, as in it was hell but it's what could be described as a regular recovery. I wasn't lucky, but didn't have major complications. 

The technique used was cold blade old style.

I was super stressed waiting to be put under on the operating chair. I recall waiting there for what seemed ages, my heartbeat going nuts with 150bpm and the doctors just injecting stuff to calm me down, my arms tingling like crazy and my whole existence just losing strength, using it's last brain power to be absolutely terrified at the nightmare to come. And what a nightmare it was.

The first two days at the hospital were genuinely fine, I had at most 3/10 pain, drinking soup or water. They would bring me ice cream, and for me the cold was a no go, it would hurt a lot, and tasted awful, especially the strawberry flavor (foreshadowing). Don't be surprised or scared that ice doesn't do it for you! Room temp drinks were the most comfortable personally. 

Starting day two I could go home. 

Day three is the day my mouth started tasting really bad. It smelled like weird chemical in the first days, but on day three it went horribly bad. This lasted for around 8 days, and before the real pain kicked in, was the worst about this whole mess. I wasn't really ready or didn't really grasp the the severity of this. My mouth, my spit, smelled like 4 months old rotten milk. It smelled like trash. My doctor asked me to come day 6 to check, and my dad drove me there. He later told me my spit smelled like shit. Actual, non hyperbole, non metaphorical shit. Drinking water was like drinking raw trash juice.

Spitting is also something annoying. I still spit more than a regular person, though Im around the spitting I'd do pre op so.. the spitting started calming down week 3 in a very slow process. Barely saw the difference until I realized it a few days ago. Get yourself spit cups!! Ideally disposable or easily washable!! Not some cup youd not want to remember spitting trash juice in two weeks ago while drinking coffee in it.

Day 6, 7 and 8 were the days when pain was gradually worsening, hitting peak at day 8. Cannot understate how much of a psychological battle this is. Doing everything in your power to drink one day and waking up the next day feeling even worse is just maniacally difficult. I was concerningly losing hope and grip on reality. 

For me the pain radiated quickly in my ears. It hurt more than the actual throat, and felt like someone trying to pierce my skull through said ears. It's quite fascinating how the nerves are shared between the two. I wasn't fascinated for long though. The pain was like an ear infection times 2, a migraine but much more local to the ear and at least twice as painful.

Knowing what works best for YOUR pain is something you need to understand quickly. I know from experience that ibuprofen works best *for me*, paracetamol less good and less long. I was given the two and metamizol, which didn't work at all on me. I was glad I didn't have to take opioids because I despise the sedating effect they had on me. But please manage your pain! Don't hesitate to ask for more, stronger pain meds if needed, you need to drink the recommended amount of water. I knew I'd have somewhat of an easier time with ibuprofen, so Id take it, and look forward to the next one, while using the paracetamol as indicated by my doctor between the sweet sweet ibus.

Despite all the good will I wasn't drinking enough, I was genuinely scared of drinking, I would get mentally ready before each sip, like when I was afraid to swallow pills.

Not being able to eat the good food I was smelling from my roommates was also really hard on my morale. My favorite and only food of that time was overcooked Chinese noodles. I recommend (you need to overcook them a lot, so they break and become basically slippery filaments). Chewing them was nice. I did eat some yoghurt for protein, but considering my mouth tasted like rotten milk I didn't eat many:)

When I went to get them checked day 10 the doctor told me the scabs were quite dry, and urged me to drink. Not drinking enough was making the recovery longer (any piece of advice for this surgery will tell you to drink for a reason, mine too!). He recommended eating a little more solid foods in a few days when the scabs would be soft again, so it could gently exfoliate the scabs.

I still had a few white spots after the third week, which at this point I just started eating totally normally again. 

I wasn't expecting to lose my taste for certain foods for this long. Everything except salt tasted very neutral, it's a hard taste to describe. It kinda tasted like some obscure medicine that says ""no flavor"" on the package, but obviously still having a slight plasticy taste, everything had the same aftertaste. I gradually gained my range of taste back, interestingly chocolate came back last, like 6 months after the operation.

**Concerning anxiety and emetophobia specifically**:

Everyone is gonna have some degree of anxiety because it's an operation, and because of the horror stories. I have a generalized anxiety disorder coupled to a trauma induced emetophobia, so I was really on edge for this operation. 

If you're asking yourself if you're ready to take the risk of the operation, if you're gonna be ok going through that recovery, I think you can help that anxiety with resolve. I couldn't imagine living with my tonsils anymore, I'd cry myself to sleep wondering when I'd have my next tonsillitis, when my throat would hurt and make me nauseous. I was ready, in my mind and body, to go through all of what could happen. I wasn't gonna live more years with these hateful tonsils, I just couldn't picture that possibility. That's when I knew I would do it, anxiety or no anxiety. 

The risk of feeling nauseous and throwing up is of course there with this operation. Mention it to your surgeon, your anesthesiologist and care professionals. They're here for that and will probably be grateful you told them that nausea is an issue. They'll know that throwing up is not comfortable during recovery and can give you something if you're feeling at risk.

I wanted to share this last thing because it shocked me. I know how this sounds and you might not relate at all, and it probably won't reassure you much. I was expecting to full on panic at some point during recovery. Imagining being in a situation where I don't have the possibility to not suffer, where I'm risking horrible complications if I don't drink or if something just goes wrong. This kinda happened with my septum operation because I wasn't really ready for it and got surprised. But because I prepared for this recovery so much, I knew what would or could come. I was strangely calm, because anything that was happening just was going to happen. I didn't have the option to run away from the problem. My throat was healing, and I just had to give it proper care. 

This is a recovery you need to plan thoroughly, know what to do if something goes wrong and plan safety nets. Once the operation is done, there's no going back. You just have to focus on the plan.

I never regretted this operation, even at my worst. It turned out to be the recovery where I had the lowest anxiety levels. I've spiralled much more on certain tonsillitis episodes. ",1,1760396434.0,Tonsillectomy,0,1.0,False

This is a student city, with some libraries working late, to get a treat or coffee after 6 PM would be such a refresher. But instead, there are almost 0 places open dedicated to students at night to chill, besides bars.
