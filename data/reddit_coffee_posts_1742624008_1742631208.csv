During our relationship, we were part of a friend group that included a girl, M (18F), who was finishing high school at the time. Everyone in the group talked about how gorgeous she was, and S, who had met her before, dismissed the hype, saying, ""I don‚Äôt get what people see in her."" Looking back, it was clear she was jealous.
The day I first met M, was supposed to be mine and my ex's fav day ever , sadly , after I broke up with her and she started apologizing about all of her lies she said she wasn't that much into me back then (When we were 8 months in the relationship) she was having a ""down"" and trying to feel something again, fair enough, she's a teenager.
A former friend of mine was obsessed with M ( a guy who my ex cheated on me with a bunch of times for reasons like "" he just begged for a kiss"" or "" I was bored"" or "" I really missed kissing guys"" and I was insecure about the fact that she's bisexual because of this ""missing guys"" thing) when I first met M , I instantly noticed everything about her. I even told my ex, ""She looks like Jennie Kim."" At that moment, I didn‚Äôt have any romantic feelings for M‚ÄîI was just struck by her beauty.That day, I bought drinks for everyone, randomly handing out whatever I grabbed.The iced coffee (my fav) landed with M.Later, when S and I were alone, M and her friend joined us because M suggested it. We all ended up at a mall together, and during the walk, I found myself talking to M about her exams. As someone who had been through the same academic hell the year before, I offered advice, telling her that once the exams were over, she‚Äôd feel like a completely different person. It was a simple, friendly conversation.
After that day, I‚Äôd occasionally check in on her,asking how her exams went. She‚Äôd vent and I‚Äôd listen. Nothing deep. However, S told me to stop because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt like her.‚Äùand I did.
Fast forward to later in the year: My relationship with S started falling apart and I eventually broke up with her on November 14, 2024. Ironically, S asked M to talk to me and try to fix things. But when I explained to M what had actually happened between me and S (Cheating, lying, manipulation, all that highschool crap that I was so done with), she realized she couldn‚Äôt help and told S she was done helping. Still, M and I kept talking, and over time, our bond grew into something real. On Valentine‚Äôs Day, three months later, we officially got together.
 I was giving up on life , and on relationships , because the bad things about this 15 month long hell ride was enough to make anybody want to take a vacation from life . For like 5 years . But M , who's a therapist-to-be , literally saved my life.
Somehow, my ex found out about our relationship, she's trying to take avenge for ""Being stabbed in the back by a friend??"" Who she never talked to. And told me that I've lost my morals because I'm dating the girl she ""introduced me to"" . AITA?",1,1742630893.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

Hot lemon water, then coffee with almond milk and honey

 kefir, fruit and chia and mixed seeds, 2 boiled eggs am

Lunch is always dinner from the night before, usually some concoction of green veg, peppers and onion, and beans / cheese / occasionally chicken plus rice or potato

However something is clearly going very wrong! If anything rings alarm bells please let me know

That‚Äôs exactly what this app represented for me.

As a starving college student, I took pride in stretching every last dollar when it came to food. So when I discovered this app, I was thrilled‚Äînot just for the potential savings, but to explore my city in ways most people don‚Äôt, and relive the struggle that defined my 19-year-old, broke-but-resourceful self.

This post is a rundown of the places I visited in Sacramento, CA, and an open invitation for you to share your own experiences. What started as an exciting experiment soon took a turn, and unfortunately, this app didn‚Äôt live up to the hype.

Whole Foods ‚Äì This one felt too good to be true, so much so that I literally set a timer on my phone to remind me to log in and snag a deal before it vanished in under three minutes. And honestly? Worth it. Whole Foods never disappointed‚Äîexcept for that one time when my meal gave me the most catastrophic, room-clearing gas of my life. I‚Äôm talking biochemical warfare levels. I swear the smell had a half-life because it lingered for days. If you‚Äôre willing to risk potential self-destruction for a bargain, this is a solid choice.

Peet‚Äôs Coffee ‚Äì As a self-proclaimed coffee addict, I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck‚Äîfresh, whole coffee beans for just $4? Unreal. Peet‚Äôs, you have my heart. If you‚Äôre in Sacramento, hit up the Midtown location. It‚Äôs a must.

Kaylo‚Äôs BBQ ‚Äì A local gem. I had high hopes, and Kaylo‚Äôs delivered. Friendly staff, amazing barbecue, and a $5 meal that included a rib (or two), barbecue chicken, a side, and bread? Absolute steal. No notes.

Chocolate Fish Coffee Roasters ‚Äì This one had me excited‚Äîfancy coffee shop in East Sac, specialty vibe, all that good stuff. But paying $12 for a bag of beans when Peet‚Äôs was selling theirs for $4? Painful. And then the real betrayal‚Äîjust as I parked outside, my order was canceled. Right then and there. I felt personally victimized. Never again.

Abyssinia ‚Äì Ethiopian food? Yes, please. A minority-owned business? Even better. But after arriving at a restaurant that was maybe one-fourth full, I waited 50 minutes for a meal that ended up being‚Ä¶ just some bread and lentils. No magic, no spark‚Äîjust vibes and disappointment.

Sun and Soil ‚Äì I walked in expecting fresh juice. I left with a small bottle of vegetable broth. That‚Äôs it. I don‚Äôt even think it was on the menu, but someone clearly thought, ‚ÄúYeah, this will do.‚Äù It did not.

Posh Bakery ‚Äì Everyone hyped this place up. A massive bakery, tons of variety, and seemingly endless selections. I was ready to feast. Instead, I got stale and moldy desserts and donuts. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this deal on my worst enemy. Actually I would. But for me - terrible. Just terrible.

Colo‚Äôs Soul Food ‚Äì This place shows up on the app all the time, so I tried twice. Both times, my order was canceled. Why? What‚Äôs the secret? Is it a test? A social experiment? I just wanted some soul food.

I‚Äôve officially retired from this app. Honestly, the whole chase just isn‚Äôt worth it anymore. It feels like playing a slot machine with a variable rate of reinforcement‚Äîsometimes you hit the jackpot, but more often than not, you‚Äôre left with disappointment (or, in my case, stale pastries and mystery broth). If you enjoy the thrill, more power to you. But for me? I‚Äôd rather pay full price for something I know will make me and my bowels happy. ",2,1742629895.0,toogoodtogo,1,1.0,False

1jh3awz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Night-Busy/comments/1jh3awz/unleashing_the_future_my_journey_into_mavryks/,Unleashing the Future: My Journey into Mavryk‚Äôs Vision of a Decentralized Tomorrow,"When I first stumbled across Mavryk, I‚Äôll admit I was skeptical. Another blockchain project promising to ‚Äúrevolutionize‚Äù finance? I‚Äôd heard it all before‚Äîhype-laden pitches that often fizzled out into obscurity. But something about Mavryk stuck with me. Maybe it was the bold claim of bridging real-world assets (RWAs) to a digital future, or perhaps it was the unapologetic ambition to redefine how we think about ownership, value, and trust. Whatever it was, I dove in, and what I found wasn‚Äôt just another crypto buzzword factory‚Äîit was a glimpse into a future I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd been waiting for.



**What Is Mavryk, Really?**  
At its core, Mavryk is a network that‚Äôs all about empowerment. Whether it‚Äôs through Mavryk Finance building decentralized banking on the Tezos blockchain, Mavryk Network connecting the dots of a digital revolution, or Mavryk‚Äôs broader ecosystem of growth partners and social selling tools, the mission feels cohesive: take power from the gatekeepers and hand it back to the people. It‚Äôs not just about crypto for the sake of crypto‚Äîit‚Äôs about using blockchain to solve real problems, like how we tokenize assets, scale businesses, or even tell stories that matter.  
Take real-world assets, for instance. The idea of turning physical things‚Äîproperty, art, even intellectual property‚Äîinto digital tokens isn‚Äôt new, but Mavryk‚Äôs approach feels different. It‚Äôs not about slapping a blockchain label on everything and calling it a day. It‚Äôs about creating a system where these assets can move freely, securely, and transparently in a decentralized economy. Imagine owning a fraction of a skyscraper in Dubai or a masterpiece painting, not because you‚Äôre a billionaire, but because Mavryk made it possible through tokenization. That‚Äôs the kind of future I can get behind.  
  
**A Personal Connection:**   
Why Mavryk ResonatesI‚Äôve always been fascinated by systems‚Äîhow they work, how they break, and how they can be rebuilt better. Growing up, I watched my parents struggle with traditional finance: opaque loan terms, endless middlemen, and a banking system that seemed designed to keep them on the outside looking in. When I read about Mavryk Finance‚Äôs vision of a ‚Äúdigitally operated banking cooperative controlled by its community,‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but think of them. What if they‚Äôd had access to a system that didn‚Äôt custody their funds but empowered them to control their own wealth? That‚Äôs not just a technical innovation‚Äîit‚Äôs a personal one.  
My first real encounter with Mavryk‚Äôs ecosystem came through their blog and litepapers. I‚Äôm no blockchain expert, but the way they broke down complex ideas‚Äîlike liquidity baking on Tezos or the potential of decentralized finance (DeFi)‚Äîfelt approachable. It wasn‚Äôt preachy or jargon-heavy; it was like a friend explaining something they‚Äôre passionate about over coffee. That authenticity hooked me. I started imagining how these tools could‚Äôve changed my own path‚Äîmaybe I‚Äôd have taken more risks as a freelancer if I‚Äôd had access to decentralized funding or a community-driven growth model like Mavryk‚Äôs.  
  
**The Mavryk Difference:**   
Beyond the BuzzwordsWhat sets Mavryk apart, in my view, isn‚Äôt just the tech (though it‚Äôs impressive‚ÄîTezos‚Äô energy efficiency and self-upgrading protocol are a big plus). It‚Äôs the mindset. Take Mavryk Dynamics or Mavryk Network: they‚Äôre not content with tweaking the status quo‚Äîthey want to rewrite it. I see this in their focus on RWAs, where they‚Äôre not just tokenizing for the sake of it but building a bridge between the physical and digital worlds. It‚Äôs practical ambition, not pie-in-the-sky dreaming.  
Then there‚Äôs the community angle. Posts on X about the Mavryk Wordsmith Competition got me thinking: this isn‚Äôt a faceless corporation. They‚Äôre inviting people like me‚Äîwriters, dreamers, skeptics‚Äîto shape their narrative. That‚Äôs rare. Most projects hoard their story like it‚Äôs a trade secret, but Mavryk seems to thrive on collective input. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the tools‚Äînow you tell us what this future looks like.‚Äù That‚Äôs a gamble, but it‚Äôs one that makes me trust them more, not less.  
  
**A Vision I Can‚Äôt Unsee**  
Here‚Äôs where my perspective shifts from observer to believer. Mavryk isn‚Äôt just about finance or assets‚Äîit‚Äôs about identity. In a world where we‚Äôre increasingly defined by what we own (or don‚Äôt), Mavryk offers a way to reclaim that narrative. Tokenizing RWAs could democratize wealth, sure, but it could also redefine success. Maybe it‚Äôs not about owning the whole pie but having a slice that‚Äôs truly yours, backed by a system you trust because you helped build it.  
I keep coming back to their docs‚Äîdry reading for some, but to me, they‚Äôre a roadmap. The litepapers talk about things like permissionless finance and real-world impact, and I can‚Äôt help but picture how this plays out. A small business owner in Lagos using Mavryk to tokenize their inventory and attract global investors. An artist in Berlin turning their portfolio into a tradable asset without a gallery taking 50%. These aren‚Äôt hypotheticals‚Äîthey‚Äôre possibilities Mavryk is actively chasing.  
  
**The Skeptic‚Äôs Take:**   
What Could Go Wrong?I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt have doubts. Decentralization sounds great until you hit scalability snags or regulatory roadblocks. Tezos is solid, but it‚Äôs not the biggest player‚Äîcan Mavryk compete with the Ethereum giants? And community control is empowering until it‚Äôs not‚Äîwhat happens if the crowd makes a bad call? These are real risks, and I don‚Äôt think Mavryk‚Äôs invincible. But what I respect is their transparency about it. Their blog doesn‚Äôt shy away from the messy stuff‚Äîmarket volatility, adoption hurdles‚Äîand that honesty makes me root for them even more.  
  
**Why I‚Äôm All In**  
Writing this feels like stepping into a conversation bigger than myself. Mavryk isn‚Äôt just a project‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. It‚Äôs for the entrepreneurs who‚Äôve been burned by gatekeepers, the creators who want their work to matter, and the dreamers who see a world where value isn‚Äôt dictated by a handful of suits in a boardroom. My unique insight? Mavryk isn‚Äôt selling a product‚Äîit‚Äôs selling a possibility. And after years of watching centralized systems fail people I care about, that possibility feels like a lifeline.  
So here‚Äôs my submission, my voice in the chorus. If I win those Mavopoly points, great‚ÄîI‚Äôll climb that leaderboard with a grin. But even if I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôve already gained something: a stake in a vision I believe in. Mavryk‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs real, and in a world of smoke and mirrors, that‚Äôs enough for me. #BeMavryk.",1,1742629430.0,u_Night-Busy,0,1.0,False

1jh39xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1jh39xq/ultimate_candida_cure_protocol/,Ultimate Candida cure Protocol,"Hey Redditor,  
I found an insane way to get better from candida.  
I have aspergers and add and basically depression anxiety low energy is my problem.

8 months ago after a toenail laser treatment i realised i had more mental clarity and believed i had fungus inside of me as well.  
So i found reddit found i have candida.  
I did months of raw kefir carnivore keto(really helped get all oxilates out the first 14 days my bum was burning from the oxilates and before pooing i was limping to the toilet with backpain from the oxilates leaving which was relieved with finishing the toilet, also had itching that was from candida die off)

i did s boulardii, cloves caprilic acid.  
then 4 weeks ago had a breaktrhough with taking nystatin 6 pills for 14 days, depression and fever was the herx reaction.

then my spit became christal clear and my mind sharp.

i recommend doing this as ultimate candida healing protcol  
s boulardii serrapeptase (biofilm breaker) nystatin carnivore for 2 weeks, the resume to normal diet and no supplements or nystatin repeat as needed and start liver flushing

I thought maybe there is even a higher level, cause many say candida could come back, so i started liver flushing which i know from old hippie friends, but found in in reddit candida on   
a christian fruit guy that does liver flushing  
[Candida overgrowth gone, symptoms gone. One word answer. : r/Candida](https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/ath0zc/candida_overgrowth_gone_symptoms_gone_one_word/)

i tell you this process isnt always easy but fun. 

what happened was i did more flushes then what is considered healthy,   
i did 5 in the first 4 days, and nothing came out except one small green stone.  
Then i started sticking to the real protocol doing it evening instead of morning and adding epsom salt which dilates the bile duckts.  
Boom i had the best experience of my life.  
started herxing cause body uses the freed up space to get toxins out of the whole body.

then i refined the prep and flush.

so now i tell you the absolute elixor of life 

drink 1 liter raw juice made with a slow juicer melon apple pinapple or whatever but no oxilate stuff like beets spinach berries

every morning to lubricate the liver

on flush day drink only juice whatever you like

flush day

18pm 1 glass water with 1 flatened tablespoon epsom salt  
20pm 1 glass water with flatened tablespoon epsom salt  
22pm drink 150ml olive oil with the 150ml juice of one grapfruit (dilates bile ducts) and one lemon

sleep after 0-3 bowel movements

at 6 o clock you should wake up feeling pretty clear

a few bowel movements start

6 am dink 1 last flatened tablespoon of epsom salt with one glass of water

do a coffee enema buy cooking 200ml water with three largely heaped tablespoon of coffee powder for 30 seconds.  
and cool it down with 800ml cold water.  
its instantly ready for an enema.  
do this 1l enema hold it for 15 minutes (sometimes its not possible to hold it longer then seconds or 5 minutes it will still work)  
this releases toxins and glutathion and activates the liver and excretion duct of the liver opens more

i have 200-300 stones come out at this point in time like today morning

then drink a liter of juice again and eat normally

this cures absolutely everything cause we all have our 3000 liver bile ducts clogged up for some reason, some speculate vaccines, and bile doesnt flow so detox and a lot of body functions dont work.

repeat this protocol for 20-80 times and chronic illnes get reversed

do it once a week on the weekend for some 12 times seems enough.

once there is 5 flushes without stones coming out and you are really high on life so you know there is no more in there you can do them once or twice a year as maintenance because sometimes new stones are created from toxins that the body draws out of the whole body or food

I‚Äôve been taking inositol in my coffee with Yasmin and vitamin D supplements. I‚Äôve been taking inositol for quite awhile. Yesterday, I had what I can only guess was a prolonged hypoglycaemic state?? All day, I felt weird, like I was in a dreamland, I was grouchy, anxious and when I came home I had a massive headache. 

I fell asleep right after dinner at like 8pm. It‚Äôs 3am now and i just woke up from having the worst, 
most horrific and disturbing nightmares.

I‚Äôm beginning to wonder whether I‚Äôm managing my blood sugar a little too well, because without confirmed IR it‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm running low most of the time. I don‚Äôt have a CGM or anything. I‚Äôm taking inositol because it helps me stay asleep also but I‚Äôm beginning to think it may be backfiring. I feel okay now I ate a cookie.

I think inositol, in combination with being lean, active and taking Yasmin & Vitamin D may be lowering my glucose too low.

I think we really need to be a little more wary of these bs lowering supplements, as without proper use in the right conditions I think they may be very dangerous. Severe hypoglycaemia can kill you in your sleep apparently. I‚Äôll be backing off the inositol and seeing my doc about this.

What would you do?,"We been married for 2.5 years and staying at his parent‚Äôs house since then while waiting for our BTO to come in another 3 years. 

Some days are bad, like today in particular. I feel very alone in the house as any time there‚Äôs an argument with him it feels like I‚Äôm outnumbered and alone. 
I will be feeling sad and bothered while he will just go about his days as per normal. The in laws won‚Äôt know that we quarrelled so they will still happily engage in conversations with him about little things like new food places in the living room while I just keep to myself in the bedroom. 

It makes me feel no one in the family care how I feel. 

What did we quarrel about? 

We were happily watching tv when his mom came home and wanted to talk to him about this new hawker centre that opened, then he casually replied‚Ä¶ ‚Äúher aunt went.. and said it‚Äôs so crowded‚Ä¶‚Äù and then I hear him say ‚Äúonly idiots will go when the place just open‚Äù and my mother in law laughed and repeated ‚Äúya idiot‚Äù siding his son. I think she brought it up cause she wanted to explore this new place too. But after hearing what his son said she changed her stance as usual. 

I asked him if he is implying that my aunt is an idiot for going. Then he says no, he is just saying that my other aunt commented it‚Äôs crowded shouldn‚Äôt go (which is true, but she didn‚Äôt use idiot in the group chat) 

So after his annoyed explanation I just kept quiet and his dad continued to interrupt us from watching drama by commenting again on this new food centre.. he got irritated, switched off the tv and went into his study room. He just simply switch it off without telling me. Then he tell his dad that there‚Äôs curry puff on the table to eat. 
There he left me sitting in the living room staring at the black screen‚Ä¶ 

Was I wrong to ask to clarify about the idiot conversation? I wanted to know because if he really did mention idiot isn‚Äôt it disrespectful? And to say so in front of his mother and me‚Ä¶

And it wasn‚Äôt my fault that his parents keep interrupting us when we are watching the tv, why did he just switch it off like that? Why does he react this way? 

It makes me feel like my husband doesn‚Äôt really care how I feel. 

There are some little things that bothers me but I been trying to communicate with him for so long I feel tired. 

Example like his piling of letters on the living room coffee table for years‚Ä¶ occasionally a few gets cleared when it becomes too much but it will not be dealt with until necessary. The in laws have been living with it so it doesn‚Äôt bother them. 
My spouse used to say that he will clear it, but the day never comes. When I remind, he says I‚Äôm nagging. It‚Äôs an eyesore to me everyday when I go into the living room, I see it but I try to ignore it as much as I can because if not we may get into an argument again‚Ä¶   

Sometimes I worry when our own house comes, will it be for better or for worse?

1jh36bq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jh36bq,"Cycene (*) - London, England","There's no getting around it: the Blue Mountain School in Shoreditch has been something of a revolving door for restaurants and chefs alike over the last few years. The site opened in 2018 and initially hosted the one-Michelin star M√£os. Once that restaurant shuttered, Cycene opened in 2022 under Theo Clench (who has worked at Trinity, Clove Club, Portland, and Akoko), and was awarded one Michelin star six months later. Then in August 2024, Clench departed, leaving sous chef Taz Sarhane (who had been working at Cycene for a couple of years and prior to this had been a member of Claude Bosi's team at the two-star Bibendum) to take the reigns. All of this said, you'd be forgiven for wondering whether Cycene could still deliver at the level it operated at upon opening. Despite issues of pacing (more on that later), Cycene offers a creative and often-times delicious menu that assures its status as a London restaurant very much worth visiting.

A meal at Cycene - meaning 'kitchen' in the English of olde - unfolds over three spaces: the bar, where aperitifs are served as well as the first course of broth, bread, butter and bcharcuterie; the kitchen itself, where head chef Taz introduces some snacks utilizing their A5 wagyu; and finally the main dining room, which has space for around 16 covers and is where the lion's share of the menu unfolds. I'm still not entirely convinced of the need for such movement between spaces when the menu doesn't have a clear thematic delineation that benefits from a change in space. But it is experiential nonetheless.

The broth that begins the meal is a delicious, almost decadent treat; smoked sardines form the basis along with the bones of the fish used throughout the week, koji soy sauce produced in-house, rendered chicken fat, and a vinegar made from Pedro Xim√©nez aged for 50 years. The butter provided as an accompaniment to the sourdough (also created in-house) is virgin, with a greater concentration of lactic acid - as well as a more cheesy flavour - than regular butter. As is alluded to in this first course and becomes more obvious as the menu progresses, there is something of a New Nordic influence at play. Fermentation, dry-aging, and foraged ingredients are all on display at Cycene, used as creative building blocks for modern dishes featuring (largely) British produce.

After this, it's up the stairs, past the dry-aging and fermentation cabinets, and into the kitchen, where an hors d'oeuvre of wagyu, confit egg yolk and caviar bursts with butteriness in the mouth. If the bread and butter at the beginning of the meal weren't clue enough, Cycene doesn't stick to the usual menu format. Rather than have all of the hors d'oeuvres served at the beginning of the meal, bites are served in between larger dishes. Of the hors d'oeuvres, the aforementioned wagyu and the oyster and lardo are of particular note, the latter being incredibly rich, sweet and creamy. The lobster and shrimp, while holding all the fresh brininess of the sea, could have benefitted from a lighter shell, as the heavy batter was texturally at odds with the filling, the former dominating in a not altogether pleasant manner.

After the bites of wagyu, it was around the corner and into the dining room, where the lights are turned down low, leaving the main sources of light the lit candles on each table. At this point, it would be quicker to note the dishes that didn't work than those that did. The Torbay prawn dish was exceptional, the cream of rice acting in such a way as to create a film over the prawns that locked in a rich butteriness, imparting a delightful mouthfeel as well as intense flavour. This was an early highlight of the meal, which followed hotly on from the custard of wild garlic with apples marinated in shoyu. The dish, smelling incredibly herbaceous, leads one to believe that they are about to get a blast of mint. However, this is not the case at all, with umami being dominant but cut through by the tempered sweetness of the apples.

The brown crab with radish two ways (pickled and roasted) was sublime, the green peppercorns providing a wonderful spice to the sauce (made from the crab shell), while the goat and cuttlefish had arguably the best plating of the dishes on the menu. Not just good looks, the goat had its smokiness shorn away by the coffee, the ragu again being deeply umami. Of the savoury dishes mentioned, the depth of flavour in each one is truly commendable.

Not to be outdone by the savoury courses, the dessert of quince (partly caramelized), jerusalem artichoke ice cream and caviar was a marriage of flavours that ended the meal on a satisfyingly high note.

Not everything was smooth sailing though. I felt that the pollock dish - while the pollock itself was a joy, tender as can be from dry aging - wasn't at the same level of creativity as the other dishes, with the creme fraiche and rhubarb adding very little to the fish.
In addition, the sauce of the hogget dish was unappetisingly sour. The rib that was given as a side to this dish was much more enjoyable than the dish itself.

Other than these quibbles concerning the food (which are relatively minor, considering the breadth and scope of the rest of the menu), the main drawback with Cycene is the pacing. My seating lasted for 3.5 hours, and I was the first out the door (and also not the first to arrive). It is a small team in a small kitchen, so it is understandable that food will take some time to be served. However, there didn't appear to be any method to the pace or to whom the dishes were brought to. The first few dishes in the main dining room were brought out quite quickly to myself, while other diners had to wait. After these dishes there would be a long gap followed by a couple more quickly proffered dishes, followed by more waiting. This is after it took 30 minutes to go from the bar to the kitchen (only the bread, butter and broth was had in that time). This being said, those of us who were kept waiting in the bar got first a lemonade made from macerated Meyer lemons comped, and then a glass of white wine. Cycene recognized that the they weren't moving optimally the evening that I dined, and this acknowledgement is appreciated. Still, it's something to bear in mind if considering a trip - be prepared for a long evening.

Fortunately, there is enough invention on display, with surprises around almost every corner, to make the wait worthwhile. Cycene is a strong Michelin-starred restaurant by a group of young chefs that are fearless in their approach to fine dining. I very much look forward to returning.

1jh34x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1jh34x6/repost_the_alpha_kings_human_mate_looking_for_a/,"REPOST: ""THE ALPHA KING'S HUMAN MATE"". Looking for a link, no ppp","If you were to ask my parents to describe my older brother, they‚Äôd tell you he was a natural leader. Fearless and courageous, the kind of man born to lead armies. 
 
And if you asked them to describe my sister, they‚Äôd gush about her sweet disposition and her selfless heart. 
 
But me? 
 
There‚Äôs only one word my parents would use to describe me: human. 
 
You might not think that ""human"" could be used as an insult, but somehow, I‚Äôve spent my entire life wearing this word like a badge of shame. When I showed up on my Alpha father‚Äôs doorstep at twelve, he told the rest of the pack that I was there because of my human mother‚Äôs failure. I was thrust into the wolf pack ‚Äì literally ‚Äì but my status as the only human there made me an instant outcast. I couldn‚Äôt run or wrestle or shift into wolves like the rest of the neighborhood kids. I‚Äôd never meet my mate or experience that instantaneous true love that mated pairs had. 
 
I was still the Alpha‚Äôs kid, and while that might‚Äôve saved me from the bullies, it didn‚Äôt mean I fit in. The werewolf world was drastically different from the human one, and to them, my humanity was a weakness.
 
My father never told me he was ashamed of me, but I could still feel his disappointment ‚Äì it hung in the air every time he called me his human daughter or explained that I was the product of a short affair with a human woman eighteen-years-ago. 
 
My stepmom, my father‚Äôs true mate, did try to make me feel included. She was the epitome of the perfect Luna ‚Äì gentle and good-natured ‚Äì but I could still tell she was ashamed of me. If there was ever evidence that her family wasn‚Äôt perfect, I was living proof of it. Every time she looked at me, she was reminded that her mate had cheated on her. 
Try as they might, none of this made a good recipe for the perfect family. I‚Äôd spent six years living under my father‚Äôs roof, in his pack, and in the werewolf world, but I‚Äôd already accepted that I‚Äôd never fit in there. 
*Or so I thought. *
Despite making plans to go to college far, far away from the pack that had no room for me, my life was about to change completely. Something ‚Äì technically, someone ‚Äì was about to ensure that there was plenty of space in the werewolf world for this ordinary little human.

*Dear Clark Bellevue, 
After carefully reviewing your application, it is with regret that we inform you that we are unable to offer you admission into the University of Florida at this time. We appreciate the time and effort put into your application, but unfortunately, this year‚Äôs large pool of applicants has made our decision difficult and we have limited space for each admitted class. 
We are confident you will go on to achieve great things in your studies, and we wish you the best in your academic journey! 
*Best Regards,
Dean of Admissions 
University of Florida*
 
I read the rejection email at least five different times, my eyes darting across the screen for something I might‚Äôve missed. Unfortunately, there was no hidden message to be found ‚Äì it was just another generic rejection email from another college that didn‚Äôt want me. My senior year of high school was ending, and although I had applied to an endless list of colleges, I‚Äôd only received three rejections and one waitlist.
Most of the schools I applied for were state schools with decent academic records ‚Äì but really, all I cared about was finding a college that was far away. Somewhere far enough where I‚Äôd have an excuse not to make it home on the weekends or for most holidays. 
Given that I lived in cold, rainy Washington, Florida‚Äôs sunny (and distant) climate would‚Äôve been perfect ‚Äì but it didn‚Äôt look like that was going to happen. 
‚ÄúClark!‚Äù 
My pity party got cut short by the sound of my sister, Lily, yelling my name. I barely had time to exit out of my Gmail screen before Lily was bursting into my room without even a knock. 
‚ÄúClark, I‚Äôve been calling you for the past five minutes,‚Äù she sighed, leaning against my door frame, ‚ÄúWere you watching another trashy reality show or just tuning out my voice?‚Äù 
Although we were half-sisters, Lily and I hardly looked alike. She was tall, fair-skinned, with long, blonde locks that never seemed frizzy or out-of-control. Her and my brother both shared my father‚Äôs bright, blue eyes. Her eyes were her best feature, and they constantly seemed like they were trying to poke beneath the surface. 
‚ÄúSorry, I wasn‚Äôt trying to tune you out, Lil,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù 
Her piercing blue eyes narrowed, but she seemed to accept my apology. ‚ÄúDad wants to see us, there‚Äôs a big meeting tonight at the pack house. A bunch of people are going to be there.‚Äù 
My eyebrows furrowed. Pack meetings weren‚Äôt unusual for our pack, but I wasn‚Äôt usually required to attend. As Blacktooth Pack‚Äôs only resident human, I wasn‚Äôt a huge part of pack business. I couldn‚Äôt shift, which meant I couldn‚Äôt participate in patrols or defend the pack. 
‚ÄúWhy is dad asking for me?‚Äù I asked. 
‚ÄúNot sure,‚Äù Lily shrugged, ‚ÄúHe just told me to come get you. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs for a good reason, dad wouldn‚Äôt bring you around if it wasn‚Äôt. Come on.‚Äù 
Lily didn‚Äôt waste any more time waiting for me, and I watched her strut out of the room. 
Not even the golden child knows why I‚Äôm being summoned, I thought, this must be important then. 
I followed Lily out of my room, and we descended the stairs in silence. With high ceilings and hardwood floors, our family house was one of the largest in the pack ‚Äì a perk that came with being part of the Alpha‚Äôs family. Photos of Lily and my brother, Sebastian‚Äôs, accomplishments hung on the walls like the trophies they were: Lily as a baby, Seb at his first pack football game, Lily at prom with her friends. 
As I expected, Dad, Seb, and Grace were all waiting in the living room. Dad lounged in the recliner like it was his throne with Grace perched on his lap while Sebastian stood awkwardly by the mantel.
‚ÄúAh, girls, there you are,‚Äù Dad said, and his booming voice echoed around the room, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a pack meeting tonight and we‚Äôll need both of you there.‚Äù 
Even in his forties, my dad didn‚Äôt look a day over thirty. He shared the same fair hair and blue eyes as Lily, and his strong jawline and intimidating frame made him look every bit like the Alpha wolf he was. 
My older half-brother, Sebastian, was just as tall as my dad, but he got his chestnut brown hair from his mother, Grace. Grace ‚Äì or Luna Grace if you weren‚Äôt her step-daughter ‚Äì was my dad‚Äôs true mate and Seb and Lily‚Äôs biological mom. She was the final piece to this picture-perfect family my dad had created. 
‚ÄúWhy is Clark coming to the meeting tonight?‚Äù Sebastian asked, glancing over at me. He didn‚Äôt mean it as an insult ‚Äì like me, he knew I was rarely needed (or wanted) at pack meetings. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk about it at the meeting,‚Äù dad said, standing up with Grace, ‚ÄúIs everyone ready? It‚Äôll be starting soon, we should head over.‚Äù 
We all nodded. 
‚ÄúOh, Clark, honey,‚Äù Grace piped up from my dad‚Äôs side, ‚ÄúAre you sure you don‚Äôt want to change? That outfit might be a little casual for a pack meeting.‚Äù 
I glanced down at my jeans and plain black t-shirt ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt exactly glamorous, but nobody else was dressed up either. Seb had on a t-shirt and shorts, and Lily rocked a jean skirt and some sort of ruffle top. 
‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôll just wear this,‚Äù I said. Grace nodded, but I could see her eyes do another sweep over my outfit. 
It‚Äôs not as if I‚Äôm going to be the center of attention here, I thought, the elders will be too busy with dad, the pack warriors are going to have their eyes glued to Lily‚Äôs butt, and any unmated girls will be flirting with my brother. 
If I was lucky, I‚Äôd blend into the background ‚Äì and frankly, that was exactly where I wanted to be at these sorts of events. 
‚ÄúEnough hanging around, let‚Äôs go,‚Äù My dad grumbled, taking Grace‚Äôs hand. He led the way out of the house, Seb, Lily, and I trailing behind him like puppies ‚Äì no pun intended. We walked in silence, and I took a moment to appreciate the scenery. 
Our pack lived in its own forested community, which meant that most places, like the pack house, were still within walking distance. Family houses lined one side of the street, but you‚Äôd eventually run into a pack-run grocery store and infirmary if you kept walking. Pack members were allowed to leave whenever they wanted, but the setup of our community meant that you rarely needed to. 
And, if you did need to, you‚Äôd still have to answer to the guards that protected our borders. They wouldn‚Äôt keep you in, but they did make it much harder to sneak out. 
The little residential part of the community was just a small part of the pack, though ‚Äì most of our territory was just wooded areas where wolves could run, play, and shift anytime they wanted to. 
For werewolves, this was the ideal setup. 
 
As a human who wouldn‚Äôt label themselves as ‚Äúoutdoorsy,‚Äù living an hour from the nearest town wasn‚Äôt exactly a high point. I wasn‚Äôt a prisoner by any means, but there were times when living in Blacktooth territory did make me feel trapped. 
 
With guards running every inch of the property, it was hard to just come and go as I pleased. And since I wasn‚Äôt a werewolf, I couldn‚Äôt just shift and run through the woods on four legs like my siblings could whenever I wanted some fresh air. 
 
Whether I wanted to be or not, I was a human living in the wolf‚Äôs den. 
 
Chapter 2
‚ÄúOutcasts always mourn.‚Äù 
‚Äì Oscar Wilde 
 
The walk to the pack house was short, and within ten minutes, we were walking through its massive foyer. The pack house was the biggest home in our territory, and since it was used for meetings, parties, or other pack events, it was made to house close to a thousand people if needed. It was designed like one massive log cabin with chairs, couches, bean bags, and other furniture scattered throughout the living room. 
 
From the moment we walked in the door, there were people. 
 
*Everywhere. *
 
The elders of our pack were seated on the couches, sipping their coffee and engaging in small talk. A couple of mated couples cuddled up on love seats and chairs, completely tuned out to everything but each other. Some of the pack warriors stood around laughing and joking in groups, most of them unmated or keeping their mates at home. 
 
As soon as my father stepped through the door, a gradual silence swept over the room and all eyes fell on us. The conversation ceased and many people inclined their heads in respect for my father. 
 
I could feel curious gazes on me too ‚Äì most of them were probably wondering why the human girl was at the meeting, just like I was. While Grace disappeared to one of the couches to sit with some of the female elders, my dad and Seb took front-and-center in the room. Lily and I both snagged an empty couch, although she was already waving some of her friends over. 
 
Unlike me, my sister was a social butterfly, and as the Alpha‚Äôs daughter, she might‚Äôve well have been the pack princess. Girls wanted to be her friend, and boys crossed their fingers that they‚Äôd be lucky enough to have Lily as a mate. 
 
Lily hadn‚Äôt met her mate yet, but at eighteen, it could happen anytime. Werewolves could identify their mates at sixteen, and it wasn‚Äôt unusual for most wolves to find them within a year or two. By eighteen or nineteen, most of the unmated wolves I‚Äôd met were antsy about finding their ‚Äútrue loves‚Äù ‚Äì they wanted to get married and start popping out babies immediately. 
 
For a brief moment, I wondered if that would happen to Lily too. If my headstrong, good-natured sister would turn into another docile wife with a pregnant belly by the end of the year. That was the expectation for female werewolves, but for some reason, the thought unsettled me. 
 
‚ÄúAttention, everyone,‚Äù my dad clapped his hands together, although all eyes were already on him, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve called you here today to discuss something important ‚Äì something that has already begun affecting our pack.‚Äù 
 
As my dad spoke, my brother stood strong beside him, arms crossed and ready to back up whatever he said. 
 
‚ÄúAs you may have heard whispers from other packs, there are tensions rising in the werewolf world,‚Äù dad said, ‚ÄúTwo of the largest packs in the country, the Crescent Moon pack and the Pacific Rock pack, have been on the brink of a war for the past two months. If their conflict does escalate, it won‚Äôt just be blood from their packs that get shed. Both packs have alliances across the country ‚Äì we‚Äôve even got a long-standing alliance with the Pacific Rock pack, and if they call upon us to help, I‚Äôll have to send warriors to fight.‚Äù 
 
I could hear a few gasps across the room, and some of the elders began to whisper. 
 
‚ÄúWhat even started this conflict? Why is the Crescent Moon pack at odds with the Pacific Rock wolves?‚Äù One of the younger male warriors piped up from the side of the room. 
 
My father sighed. ‚ÄúIt started the same way that most of these conflicts start: by wolves trying to claim things that aren‚Äôt theirs. The Crescent Moon‚Äôs new Alpha is ambitious and he‚Äôs been trying to expand his pack lands since he took over. For the past few months, they‚Äôve been steadily creeping into Pacific Rock territory.‚Äù 
 
While I‚Äôd heard my father grumbling about this latest conflict to Sebastian or Grace at home, this was the first time I‚Äôd heard about it in such detail. It wasn‚Äôt unusual either ‚Äì since I‚Äôd been living in the werewolf world, I‚Äôd heard countless stories of packs trying to take over other packs or warring for territories. Werewolves were possessive about everything, and that included their lands. 
 
However, this was the first time I‚Äôd been subject to a conflict that might affect my own pack. My father was a good Alpha, and he‚Äôd spent his entire rule trying to stay out of territory disputes and other conflicts with nearby packs. 
 
‚ÄúI know this must sound worrying,‚Äù my father continued, ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt believe it will escalate to a war. The Alpha King is aware of the dispute, and he doesn‚Äôt want this to turn into an out-of-control war with both sides trying to call on alliances. He believes that both Alphas can come to an understanding as long as they meet on neutral ground with the King himself present.‚Äù 
 
Ah, the mysterious, all-powerful Alpha King. At least this guy is finally doing his job. 
 
Ever since I‚Äôd been in the werewolf world, I‚Äôd been hearing about the Alpha King. I‚Äôd never met the guy or even seen a picture of him, but from what I understood, he was the closest thing the werewolves had to a monarch ‚Äì and a celebrity. 
 
He had his own territory and pack, but he ruled over everyone. He was the Alpha of Alphas wolves ‚Äì the one that ruled them all. His word was final, and while he didn‚Äôt usually get involved in pack business, he might step in special cases. Like, you know, to prevent a war. 
 
Last I‚Äôd heard, the current Alpha King was around my dad‚Äôs age, but he was grooming his son to take over when he died. I didn‚Äôt know much about the King‚Äôs son either, but then again, it‚Äôs not as if I was the hub for all-things-werewolf-knowledge. Besides what I heard around the house or the bare-bones explanation my dad gave me about pack hierarchy and wolf biology when I started living with him, I was still pretty clueless. 
 
‚ÄúThis is good news then,‚Äù said one of the elders, a wrinkled, old man gripping onto his coffee cup for dear life, ‚ÄúThe Alpha King will surely placate both packs. Is there something else you‚Äôre worried about, Alpha?‚Äù 
 
My dad sighed and crossed his arms, ‚ÄúThere is one other thing. In fact, it‚Äôs the main reason I‚Äôve gathered so many of you here tonight.‚Äù Briefly, he made eye contact with me. 
 
Guess we‚Äôre about to get to the good stuff here then. 
 
‚ÄúThe Alpha King sees this as an opportunity to strengthen alliances and understandings for every pack ‚Äì not just the Crescent Moon and Pacific Rock wolves. He‚Äôs asked each Alpha to send their children as diplomats.‚Äù 
 
Beside me, Lily inhaled sharply and I watched Sebastian‚Äôs eyes widen. 
 
I‚Äôd watched my dad leave for diplomatic trips and meetings before, but never my brother or sister ‚Äì most packs wanted to deal with the current Alpha, not the future one. 
‚ÄúWhy Alpha children?‚Äù The same elder asked, ‚ÄúSebastian is still years from taking over your position. What benefit would it be for us to send such young wolves?‚Äù 
 
A couple of people nodded in agreement across the room, and I couldn‚Äôt disagree with the elder‚Äôs logic. As long as my dad didn‚Äôt die unexpectedly, Sebastian wouldn‚Äôt be the Alpha for years to come and it didn‚Äôt make much sense to send Lily either. As a female wolf, she maybe had a small chance of becoming Alpha if dad and Seb both died ‚Äì but that would only be after she proved herself to the pack. 
 
I guess the only upside here is that if Lily and Sebastian have to leave on some diplomatic wolf mission, I‚Äôll get the house to myself (and free reign of Lily‚Äôs closets). 
‚ÄúThe Alpha King believes that it‚Äôs important for the future of the werewolf world to learn how to cohabitate now ‚Äì before they‚Äôre handed real power and given titles. He thinks teaching them to be diplomats might prevent further disputes like the one we‚Äôre in the midst of now.‚Äù
 
‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù The elder asked. 
 
‚ÄúWell,‚Äù my dad said, and I could see he was reluctant to say this next part, ‚ÄúThat was the reasoning he‚Äôs given us as Alphas, and I do believe it explains why he wants the future Alphas there. However, I have a feeling there‚Äôs another ulterior motive at play. The King has asked for every Alpha child, including our daughters. His son has just turned twenty-five and he‚Äôs still mateless. I believe this is another opportunity for the prince to search for his mate.‚Äù 
 
‚ÄúAll Alpha daughters?‚Äù Another elder spoke, and almost every eye in the room landed on me. 
 
No, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm included in this. 
 
I‚Äôm human, that‚Äôs an automatic pass out of most werewolf events, especially diplomatic pack meetings. 
 
My dad turned to me, his eyes full of concern. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, yes, that means that he‚Äôll want to see my human daughter, Clark, too. She‚Äôll be attending the meeting with her siblings.‚Äù 
 
Oh, no. 

Chapter 3
*‚ÄúWerewolves are much more common animals than you might think.‚Äù 
Daniel Pinkwater*
 
Whispers spread across the room like wildfire. 
 
My human ears couldn‚Äôt make anything out any of the murmurs from other pack members, so I just tried to focus on keeping calm. 
 
Did I want to attend some uber-important diplomatic meeting filled to the brim with short-tempered wolves? 
 
No. 
 
Did I have a choice in the matter? 
 
Also no. I might not have been the hub for all-things-werewolf knowledge, but even I knew that the Alpha King‚Äôs word was final. If the guy told you that he wanted you at a meeting, you were going to be there. 
 
‚ÄúOkay, everyone, let‚Äôs settle down,‚Äù Dad‚Äôs voice boomed through the room, and the chatter ceased immediately. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already contacted one of the Alpha King‚Äôs contacts about Clark‚Äôs attendance. The King aware that she‚Äôs human, but she‚Äôs also an Alpha‚Äôs daughter, so he‚Äôs not willing to make an exception.‚Äù 
 
I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should be pissed or flattered. Part of me was touched that my dad had already gone out of his way to get me out of this whole ordeal, but part of me was pissed that he hadn‚Äôt said anything to me. He‚Äôd clearly known about this meeting for a little while if he had enough time to try and contact the Alpha King, so why was I just now learning about this? 
 
*A little heads up would‚Äôve been nice, that‚Äôs all.* 
 
But then I glanced over at Lily, who had gone pale, and remembered that I wasn‚Äôt the only one in the dark. Neither of my siblings had any idea about this meeting either. 
‚ÄúYou okay, Lil?‚Äù I asked my sister, touching her shoulder. She was still pale, wide, blue eyes fixed on her lap. 
 
At my touch, she looked up and schooled her expression. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said.
 
I didn‚Äôt quite believe her, but I didn‚Äôt want to push ‚Äì especially here, in front of the rest of the pack. 
 
I looked up at Sebastian. His face was stoic, but even from across the room, I could see his furrowed eyebrows. He was worried. 
 
He was just as much as part of this as Lily and I was, although his presence at a diplomatic meeting made more sense. He was next in line to be Alpha.
 
‚ÄúThe meeting is on short notice,‚Äù Dad continued, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be sending Sebastian, Lily, and Clark off next week. I will not be able to accompany them, but I will send a few pack warriors for safety. I‚Äôll speak with those I‚Äôve picked for that role in private this week. Now, moving on, Healer Ren has informed me that we‚Äôre running low on a few medical supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù 
 
The rest of the pack meeting passed in a blur, with dad covering routine, normal pack business. Despite the change of subject, I still felt plenty of eyes on me. 
 
Once dad finished talking, most of the pack began socializing with each other, much like they‚Äôd been doing before we showed up. 
 
Lily immediately disappeared into a throng of her friends, and I awkwardly kept to myself on the couch. I had always felt a little socially awkward, but after dad‚Äôs big announcement, I felt even less like socializing. 
 
‚ÄúAre you worried, Clark?‚Äù 
 
A raspy voice broke my train of thought, and I looked up to see one of the male elders had approached me. I recognized him, he was one of our oldest pack members, but I couldn‚Äôt remember his name. 
 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm, uh, just surprised,‚Äù I confessed, ‚ÄúI understand why the King might want future Alphas there, even future Alpha daughters that might be his son‚Äôs mate. I guess I just feel as if my presence might be unnecessary.‚Äù I tried to choose my words carefully. Although the elder had kind eyes, he was still a werewolf, and I didn‚Äôt want too trash talk the King too much. 
 
‚ÄúIf I had to speculate as to why the King insisted you be there, despite your human status,‚Äù The elder said, ‚ÄúMy guess would be that he doesn‚Äôt want to take any chances.‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Take any chances about what?‚Äù 
‚ÄúAbout his son, Clark,‚Äù he said, and he almost looked amused, ‚ÄúYour father said it himself, this meeting is only half about diplomacy. It‚Äôs also about getting every Alpha daughter in the same room, and giving the Prince an opportunity to find his mate.‚Äù 
‚ÄúRight, but I‚Äôm human. Doesn‚Äôt that automatically disqualify me from having a mate?‚Äù 
The old man‚Äôs lips twisted upwards. ‚ÄúNot exactly. You‚Äôre an unusual case, Clark. You don‚Äôt have the wolf gene, but you‚Äôve still got Alpha blood running through your system. While it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôd have a mate, let alone the future Alpha King, there‚Äôs still a chance. A miniscule one.‚Äù 
It felt like my world had been rocked twice in one night. 
When my dad had given me my werewolf biology lesson all those years ago, he‚Äôd never mentioned the possibility of me having a mate. He‚Äôd explained that the mating process happened between two wolves ‚Äì that their inner beasts called out to each other. 
It had been a comfort to me, the idea that I would never have to worry about being chained to some territorial, domineering wolf for the rest of my life. 
‚ÄúHow does that even work, a wolf mating with a human?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard of that. I thought mating happened when two people‚Äôs inner beasts choose each other. But someone like me doesn‚Äôt have an inner wolf.‚Äù
 
The elder nodded thoughtfully. ‚ÄúYes, that is how it usually happens,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúTwo inner wolves call out to each other. Our inner wolves are intuitive, and they know who is right for us upon first glance. This is why mates recognize each other the first time they make contact. The bond is forged immediately, and there‚Äôs no going back. 
However, there are rare cases. I have seen human-wolf pairings in my lifetime, but only a few times. As I said, it‚Äôs rare. Having a human mate carries the risk that you‚Äôll end up with children that have wolf blood, but lack the actual gene.‚Äù 
‚ÄúLike me.‚Äù 
‚ÄúYes. And most humans are simply not strong enough to survive in this kind of world, they do not understand our pack mentality. Most inner wolves recognize this. It‚Äôs in our nature to seek strong mates, ones that will bear strong children. But there have been times, very rarely, when a wolf has recognized a human as worthy of mating. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why, that is beyond my wisdom. Only an inner wolf can decide who is the right mate. But from what I understand, human-wolf pairings are exceptionally difficult.‚Äù 
 
‚ÄúWhy‚Äôs that?‚Äù 
 
‚ÄúA werewolf spends their entire life learning about the mate bond, and they desire it. With their inner wolf, there is a natural pull to their mate. They feel the bond constantly, and they can‚Äôt bear to pull away. It‚Äôs why divorce and separation don‚Äôt exist in our world. The desire for your mate is so strong, no wolf could possibly fathom being away from them. But humans don‚Äôt have an inner wolf, they don‚Äôt feel the bond the same way. I‚Äôm not sure if they experience a pull, but if they do, it‚Äôs nothing like what a wolf feels. And from what I‚Äôve seen, human mates don‚Äôt get handled the same way that regular mates do.‚Äù 
 
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked. 
 
The elder smiled ruefully. ‚ÄúHaving grown up in this world, you already know how possessive wolves can be, especially male wolves,‚Äù he continued, ‚ÄúMost wolves are naturally territorial of their mates. It‚Äôs in our nature to be protective and dominant of what‚Äôs ours. The higher ranking the wolf is, the more possessive they‚Äôll be. Alphas are the most possessive, and while I‚Äôve never met the Alpha King or the Prince, I assume they‚Äôre even worse than normal Alphas. As you know, humans are more fragile than werewolves. Your senses aren‚Äôt as good, you break more easily, take longer to heal, and you get sick. Having such a fragile mate would put any wolf on edge ‚Äì any possessiveness or protectiveness they‚Äôd feel just gets amplified ten times over. Several decades ago, one of our pack warriors had a human mate. He was beside himself with worry about her most of the time, even when she was fine. He wouldn‚Äôt let her leave the house by herself. He hardly let her cook, he was too worried that she‚Äôd cut herself with a knife or burn herself on the stove. He‚Äôd keep her on bed rest for days if he even thought she was getting a cold.‚Äù
 
He shook his head and sighed, ‚ÄúThat poor girl. I‚Äôm not sure how she ever functioned like that.‚Äù 
 
I couldn‚Äôt see my own face, but I must‚Äôve looked pretty freaked out because the old man put a comforting hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to worry, Clark,‚Äù he said, patting my arm, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to scare you. As I told you earlier, human mates are so rare, they almost never happen. The chance that you‚Äôd be a wolf‚Äôs mate, it‚Äôs almost impossible.‚Äù
 
*Impossible, yes.* 
 
*There‚Äôs no need to make a big deal out of this, Clark. You heard the man ‚Äì human mates almost never happen, and if they do, it‚Äôs probably just to uber-special humans.*
I took a deep breath, and tried to hold onto that thought. 
 
*Everything is going to be okay.*
*There‚Äôs no way I have a mate.*",1,1742628666.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1jh3107,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jh3107/my_m35_gf_f34_left_me_and_disappeared_for_good/,My (m35) gf (F34) left me and disappeared for good,"My relationship with her has gone through various dynamics over the years.

When we started dating, it was through Tinder. She wasn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúTinder girl,‚Äù and it was a friend who installed the app for her because she had just come out of a casual relationship in the summer of 2020.


I wasn‚Äôt her type, and it was a battle on my part to win her over. As soon as I saw her, I fell in love and knew it would be worth it.


I managed to get her to give me a chance, but then the first problem came up‚Äîsex. We weren‚Äôt anatomically compatible (she was very tight, and I‚Äôm well-endowed), which made things really difficult. Add to that the fact that she had come from a casual relationship where the sex was constant and good.


In her mind, this wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a serious, long-term relationship, so she didn‚Äôt make much effort. She even said once, ‚ÄúI come home from work and do what with you?‚Äù Couple that with the fact that I knew her sex life before me was perfect.


I felt terrible and started building resentment, even though I really liked her.
Then the house issue came up because she owns a place in Lisbon but also has a family home on the south bank (across the river, about 15km from her place). 


Since I wanted her to stay with me at all costs, I always said I didn‚Äôt mind moving and living on the south bank, even if it meant being farther from my family and friends.


When we argued (due to the lack of sex), I‚Äôd say I didn‚Äôt want to live there, and that created hurt feelings.
It took years for the dynamic to flip‚Äîshe started liking me more, but I didn‚Äôt feel as strongly about her anymore. When that shift happened, I became short-tempered and kept thinking I could find someone else and have the life I‚Äôd always wanted.


When she finally started trying, there was a day when I‚Äôd had enough and broke up with her over text. She tried everything‚Äîcalling, crying, exactly what I‚Äôm doing now‚Äîbut I didn‚Äôt want to hear it.


Fifteen days later, the longing hit me, and I reached out to fix things. By then, she was doing better and had already been talking to other people.
We got back together, and from there, the arguments escalated‚Äîraised voices, me storming out, her holding me back from leaving. I once yelled at her in the street at night in a McDonald‚Äôs parking lot.

 Things I look back on now and feel utterly ashamed of.
Whenever we broke up, she was always the one to come looking for me to fix things, and she did that for so long until one day she stopped, and I became the one chasing after her when we split.


Her father passed away last year, which didn‚Äôt help.
But the worst was her illness‚Äîadenomyosis. If our sex life was already bad, it got 10 times worse after that. On top of the intense pain and constant sickness (rhinitis, headaches, etc.), her libido completely vanished.


Then comes the part where I mess up. I start feeling bad about the lack of sex > I get frustrated > she doesn‚Äôt like it > arguments.
This has been going on for a year and a half. The fault is mine because I say I‚Äôll accept it and handle it, but sooner or later, my frustration takes over, and we fight.


She‚Äôs been seeing a psychologist for a year, and on top of that, all the doctors treating her say she should end the relationship because it‚Äôs not working.


Out of the last 10 times we broke up, it was always her decision‚Äînot because she doesn‚Äôt love me, but because she‚Äôs fed up with this environment. I always try to get her back, and somehow I manage to.


The second-to-last time (not counting this one), 15 days ago, she ended it again over the same issue. I said I‚Äôd try my best (like I always promise), and with a lot of persistence, we got back together.


She asked why I want this relationship so badly, why I put myself through this, and I said what I always say‚Äîit‚Äôs just a bad phase, and it‚Äôll pass.


We had an amazing week with her family, with friends, and then last Sunday, it happened.
After work, I went to hang out with a friend while she was at a family lunch.
When I met up with her, her mom invited me for coffee, and I accepted. Then her mom offered a snack, and I accepted that too.
She asked if I hadn‚Äôt eaten with my friend since I was already out and could‚Äôve done so, but I reacted badly.


I said I hadn‚Äôt eaten, and while her mom went to walk the dog, she brought it up again. Annoyed, I said I hadn‚Äôt eaten and asked if there was a problem.
She said there obviously wasn‚Äôt. When we got to her place, I was still bothered by it, but she wasn‚Äôt‚Äîshe was fine. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs hurting me so much‚Äîthe fact that I couldn‚Äôt let it go.
I‚Äôd had a bad day at work, got caught in the rain, and was in a foul mood, so when she asked that, I didn‚Äôt like it.


She noticed I was upset, and that‚Äôs when I lost it and said, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it to you if I ate at work or not?‚Äù in a loud tone. She immediately told me to leave her house, and I started packing my things.


While I was packing, she came to me and asked if I wanted to talk, but being the hot-headed, immature idiot I am, I said no.
Before leaving, I told her it‚Äôd be the last time she kicked me out like that.


When I got home, I was already blocked, and it‚Äôs been 7 days since she disappeared.",3,1742628179.0,relationship_advice,2,0.8,False

1jh2zqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/online_sellers/comments/1jh2zqh/how_to_validate_a_product_idea_before_wasting/,How to Validate a Product Idea Before Wasting Time & Money,"  

Starting a business or launching a new product can be exciting, but investing time and money without proper validation can lead to failure. Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of assuming that their idea is great just because they love it. However, without testing the market, they risk wasting resources on something that no one wants.  

If you're looking to build a successful product‚Äîwhether for Etsy, Shopify, or your own brand‚Äîvalidating your idea first is crucial. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to ensure you‚Äôre creating something that people are willing to pay for.  

---

## **1. Define Your Product Idea Clearly**  

Before you can validate an idea, you need to define it clearly. Ask yourself:  

- What problem does my product solve?  
- Who is my target audience?  
- Why would someone buy this instead of existing alternatives?  

For example, if you're thinking of selling handmade eco-friendly tote bags, clarify what makes them unique. Are they made from a specific sustainable material? Are they customizable? Are they cheaper or more durable than competitors?  

If you can‚Äôt answer these questions, take a step back and refine your idea.  

---

## **2. Research the Market Demand**  

Once you have a clear idea, research whether there is demand for it. Some methods to do this include:  

### **A. Search Volume & Trends**  
Use free tools like:  

- **Google Trends** ‚Äì Check if interest in your product idea is increasing or declining.  
- **Keyword Planner (Google Ads)** ‚Äì Find how many people search for related terms.  
- **Etsy & Amazon Search Bar** ‚Äì Start typing your product name and see what autofills. If related terms show up, that‚Äôs a good sign.  

For instance, if you‚Äôre considering selling handmade ceramic mugs, check if people are searching for ‚Äúhandmade ceramic mugs‚Äù or ‚Äúunique coffee mugs‚Äù frequently.  

### **B. Competitor Research**  
Look at your potential competitors:  

- Check **Etsy, Amazon, and Shopify stores** to see if similar products exist.  
- Read **customer reviews** to find out what people like or dislike.  
- Check how many **sales and ratings** a product has. If top competitors have thousands of reviews, there‚Äôs demand. If no one is selling something similar, it might mean there's no market.  

---

## **3. Validate with a Small Audience (Low-Cost Testing)**  

Before investing in inventory, test your product idea in a low-risk way.  

### **A. Conduct Surveys & Polls**  
- Use **Google Forms, Typeform, or Instagram Polls** to ask potential customers about their interest.  
- Join **Facebook groups, Reddit communities, and Discord servers** related to your niche and ask for honest feedback.  

Example: If you‚Äôre thinking about selling minimalist phone cases, create a short survey asking:  
1. Would you buy this design?  
2. What price would you pay?  
3. What features matter most to you?  

### **B. Create a Waitlist or Landing Page**  
A landing page lets you see if people are willing to sign up before you even launch. Use:  
- **Carrd, Wix, or WordPress** to create a simple one-page website.  
- Offer a **discount or early access** for those who sign up.  
- Share the page on **social media, Reddit, or through ads** to test interest.  

If people are willing to give their email, they‚Äôre more likely to buy when you launch.  

---

## **4. Make a Prototype or MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**  

Instead of investing in bulk inventory, start with a small batch or prototype.  

- If you‚Äôre making handmade products, **create a few samples** and list them on Etsy or Instagram.  
- If it‚Äôs a digital product (like templates or guides), offer a **free beta version** and ask for feedback.  
- If it‚Äôs a service, **offer it for free or at a discount** to early customers in exchange for testimonials.  

For example, if you want to sell hand-drawn art prints, create 5-10 designs and test selling them before making 100+ prints.  

---

## **5. Test with Real Buyers**  

The best validation comes from actual sales.  

### **A. List on Etsy, eBay, or Facebook Marketplace**  
Instead of building a full e-commerce website, test by listing a few items on platforms that already have buyers.  

Example: If you‚Äôre selling crochet plushies, create a few and list them on Etsy. If they sell, you know there‚Äôs demand.  

### **B. Run a Small Ad Campaign**  
- Use **Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest ads** with a small budget ($5‚Äì$10 per day).  
- Target your ideal audience and check if people click and engage.  
- If no one is interested after a few days, it might indicate a lack of demand.  

---

## **6. Analyze Feedback & Adjust**  

After testing, analyze what worked and what didn‚Äôt.  

- If people **buy immediately**, that‚Äôs a great sign.  
- If you get **interest but no sales**, maybe the price is too high, or the design needs tweaking.  
- If there‚Äôs **zero engagement**, the idea might need a complete rethink.  

Example: If you sell handmade wooden coasters and people love the design but say they‚Äôre too expensive, consider adjusting pricing or materials.  

---

## **7. Scale Only After Validation**  

Once you have proof that people are willing to pay for your product:  

- Order **larger inventory** if necessary.  
- Invest in **better branding, packaging, and marketing**.  
- Set up a **proper online store (Shopify, WooCommerce, or Etsy shop upgrade)**.  

Avoid spending on **expensive branding or a full website** before you confirm that your product sells.  

---

## **Final Thoughts: Don‚Äôt Fall in Love with Your Idea‚ÄîFall in Love with Solving Problems**  

Many businesses fail because they invest too much in a product they ""love"" without checking if people actually want it. Instead of assuming, validate.  

- If your idea gets interest‚Äîgreat! Build on it.  
- If not, **pivot and adapt** based on what people want.  

By following this process, you‚Äôll save time, money, and frustration, ensuring that your product has real potential before going all in.

I‚Äôm in training with three others‚ÄîAnna, Julia, and Ellie. Anna and Julia are the only ones with cars.

Anna offered to drive me and Ellie to and from work, saying it didn‚Äôt make sense for us to Uber since she was going the same way. We offered multiple times to pitch in for gas, but she refused, so we‚Äôd occasionally buy her coffee or lunch to thank her. She would text in our group chat in the morning when she was about to leave so Ellie and I could meet her downstairs. We usually left at 7:15 AM, and this arrangement worked fine for three weeks.

One morning, Julia texted the group at 7 AM asking for help and then offered a ride. I replied, ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll join Julia today,‚Äù and she said she‚Äôd leave at 7:20. When I went downstairs, I saw Anna‚Äôs car still parked, which was odd. Julia called her twice‚Äîno answer. I called once‚Äîno answer. On my second call, she picked up. I asked if everything was okay since we saw her car still there, and she just said, ‚ÄúYes, yes, see you there,‚Äù then hung up.

Minutes later, she texted the group asking if we had left, even though I had just told her on the phone that we had. When I confirmed, she replied, ‚ÄúThank you for replying,‚Äù which, in hindsight, felt passive-aggressive.

I was shocked. She was the one who offered the rides in the first place, and now she was making it sound like I had been using her?

1jh2w3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jh2w3s/flair_or_machine_for_milkbased_drinks_200/,Flair or machine for milk-based drinks? [$200],"I recently posted this on r/FlairEspresso and would like to ask non-Flair subreddit for the sake of eliminating bias.

‚Äî-

I currently have DF54 and Delonghi EC155 as my first setup for years and I'm pretty content with it.

Lately, it could be that my taste changed, the machine is actually degrading, or my perception increases.

It *seems* I now find EC155 to be inconsistent.

Now this is the reason why I'm upgrading.

Things to be noted:

* I like piccolo, cortado, and flat white
* I don't mind taking time I need since I will just be at home
* I don't mind complementing Flair with something like NanoFoamer

I have no first-hand experience in direct comparison of equipments.

I appreciate really good drinks from better machines in specialty shops, but EC155 served me well and I was really pragmatic with my expectations.

And that being said, my new equipment options are:

* Flair Neo Flex
* Gemilai CRM3610

I have no idea how much difference an excellent espresso would make to a milk-based drink.

If milk ultimately hides the nuances of coffee, then it does not makes sense to me to spend more time and will just go for the convenience of Gemilai regardless if it yields mediocre shot and mediocre steamed milk.

If the opposite is true, I can make peace with Flair and NanoFoamer.

Again, I have no preferences with workflow and time.

But if a longer workflow does not even yield an even better drink, I'll be fine with a good enough machine.

I would love to hear your thoughts especially from those who‚Äôve tried both setups.",1,1742627557.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Haven't spoken to her for close to a week now after having a horrible text convo with her that showed me how little she thinks of me, and how she must function within a sore victim mentality to suppress any deeper emotions. I thought I would be absolutely brutalised by the emotions of estrangement. It happened the last time we broke up ‚Äî I would cry at any moment I found myself alone, and it was so painful and scary. This time, I've been relatively okay. 

I'm eating well, I'm happy. I can go for long moments not thinking of her. 

At first, I thought I was in shock and numb and scared to feel the pain again, and that it would hit me eventually. But even when I did finally have a big sob the other day after seeing a mutual friend of ours for coffee, I simply let it out, dried my tears and got out of bed. I sought the solace of my best friend and then went out for drinks with another close friend of mine. This encounter with my emotions reminded me how much more I have to offer to people, and how much love is actually out there. Proper love ‚Äî one that does not trigger me, or asks me to beg. 

I doubt I won't cry again, and I certainly do get the pangs of missing her. She has a big show on at the moment which I watched her work on over the past couple years of our relationship. I do selfishly keep tabs on it. But there's something lighter in me. Eventually, I think I'll be grateful to her for ending it so abruptly because I was stuck in an endless, obsessive loop. If anything, being this okay after such a short period of time of no contact just shows me how much I had actually moved on in the time we were still in contact. 

I am so afraid of the unknown, I am so afraid of loving someone new and not knowing her anymore. But I can't wait to redirect the love I held, and continue to hold for her, into someone else. I like myself when I'm in love and I like feeling loved. ",1,1742626922.0,redscarepod,1,0.67,False

It‚Äôs not just that there are fewer options‚Äîthat‚Äôs expected in a smaller town‚Äîit‚Äôs that even the basics, like fresh ingredients, well-cooked meals, and decent coffee, seem inconsistent.

I‚Äôve tried a mix of cafes, pubs, and restaurants across different parts of Ballarat, hoping to find some standout spots, but I keep running into the same issues: basic bland flavors, overcooked or under-seasoned food, and prices that don‚Äôt seem to match the quality. There have been a few decent places, but nothing I‚Äôd go out of my way to recommend. Even just finding a reliably good coffee has been a struggle, which is surprising given how strong cafe culture is in Victoria.

This makes me wonder‚Äîwhat‚Äôs going on here? Is it a supply chain issue where Ballarat struggles to get fresh, high-quality produce? Is there a lack of competition, so places don‚Äôt feel the need to step up their game? Or is it just that local demand is different, and people are generally happy with what‚Äôs available? I‚Äôd love to hear from locals‚Äîdo you think the food scene here is actually good, or is it something that could be improved?

To be fair, I could just be picking the wrong places. If there are hidden gems I‚Äôve been missing, I‚Äôd love some recommendations. I‚Äôm more than happy to be proven wrong! But so far, every trip to Ballarat has left me thinking: why isn‚Äôt the food here better?

Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

First time i post on reddit.

English is not my lative language so i will do my best to be as comprehensive as possible.

A few months ago, I was diagnosed with ADHD and therefore received treatment, Ritalin for those who know what that is.  


But I quickly stopped because I noticed it was causing me anxiety attacks, particularly a racing heart, difficulty breathing, the feeling that I was going to die any minute.

For 2 months after stopping the treatement everything was fine, but on the day of my departure for my vacation, I started having the same anxiety or panic attack for no reason at the boarding gate, probably because I was frustrated that the boarding was delayed.

I attributed it to the impressive amount of caffeine I was consuming throughout the day, as a large dose of caffeine ironically does me good.  
  
So I have reduced my caffeine intake, going from maybe 7 or 8 coffees (double espresso) to just 1 coffee in the morning when I wake up.  


Everything was getting better and last night all of a sudden I felt a wave of anxiety wash over me, with a feeling of imminent death, it was extremely unpleasant, the only common factor I found is my coffee consumption, the act of dipping my lips in caffeine triggers waves of anxiety that can last all day, this morning for example I didn't consume caffeine and I feel very good and serene.  


I am aware that this site is not a medical office, and I have actually made an appointment with a doctor for a checkup upon my return from vacation, but are there any people who have had the same experiences as me? I have the impression that my problem is entirely psychological, especially because before taking Ritalin, I had to undergo an ECG and a blood test, and my heart is in very good condition.  
  
Moreover, when I exercise, my heart doesn't give me any problems; on the contrary, I feel a sense of well-being, and if there were an issue with my heart, I doubt I would be able to regain my composure and calm down.

  
If anyone has had an experience similar to mine, particularly sudden intolerance to caffeine, your testimony is welcome.

1jh2dx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1jh2dx5/success_with_fibre/,Success with Fibre,"I've been at this a year.  Last February I had my first cholesterol test and it came at 4.07mmol (157mg).   I changed my diet completely to a low fat diet:

1) Breakfast - Mixed Nuts and a Banana
2) Chick Pea Salad (Chick Peas, Cucumber, Avacado, Carrots, Tomatoes, Fat Free Italian Dressing and some cracked papper).   Also a tupperware of mixed nuts to eat during the day.  I was also snacking on dehydrated mangos.
3) Dinners, low fat meat (chicken breast, turkey breast, salmon or cod). Served with yams, potatoes, couscous, brown rice, or quinoa, plus a bunch of veggies.   We would have chicken breast fajitas (whole grain wrap, veggies, salsa and fat free sour cream), or salmon burgers and fries.  Our mid week thing.  Weekends I might have a tuna sandwich and an apple instead of the salad.  We would do takeout once a week.  Tried to go for lower fat stuff.  Sushi, Chicken Shwarma, found vegan pizza that had 1g for sat fat per slice, pad thai, vindaloo).

All that, and keeping under 10g of sat fat 99% of the time and I only got down to 3.33mmol (1.29mg) last September.  I also lost close to 40lbs.   My neutral weight went from close to 220 to just over 180.   It's been pretty flat for about 6 months.

I made some modifications.  Mostly fibre:

1) I switched the 1% milk I was using for skim.  I have a single big cup of coffee every morning (filtered).  I'd put a splash of milk in it and take a slam from the carton.  About 2 litres/week, I switched to skim.

2) I change my breakfast to half a cup of All Bran Buds with some skim milk and a banana.  It was the highest fibre cereal I found.  Half a cup has 5g of soluble fibre.

3) I felt I was eating too many nuts (I think I leaned too heavy on cashews).  I subbed my small lunch tupperware of nuts for an apple.  I only have the odd handful now during the day if I'm home.  Usually mixed nuts, as cashews have higher sat. fat than other nuts.  I also cut out the dried mangos, I think it was making my blood glucose go up.

4) I take 5 metamucil capsules with my dinner.  I think that's about 3 g of soluble fibre.   I figured I easily get the rest from my meals.

Today's Test.   2.83mmol (1.09mg).    The fibre had way more impact than I was expecting.  Knocked it down a significant chunk.  My doctor was iffy on putting me on a statin with the 3.33mol.  This one is so close to the goal of 2.6.

I was really happy with the fibre result.    Super stoked it made a big dent.    Not quite at the goal of 2.6 (100mg), but I'm not sure I have much left to trim out.  Pretty consistent low fat diet, and a solid amount of fibre, between all bran buds, food, and metamucil caps.

Let‚Äôs be honest: flashy gadgets and trendy possessions? They lose their sparkle overnight. True fulfillment comes from something deeper. Here‚Äôs what lights the path to a life brimming with purpose and joy:  
  
¬†**1. Someone to Love**  
This is your anchor‚Äîa person who inspires you to grow, even when they‚Äôre not trying to. It might be a partner, a child, a friend, or a furry companion. Loving someone (or something) bigger than yourself gives your heart a home and your actions meaning. They‚Äôre your ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù your gentle nudge to keep becoming your best self.  
  
¬†**2. Something to Do**  
Purpose is the fuel that gets you out of bed, eager to greet the day. Whether you‚Äôre crafting code, teaching students, gardening, or running a business, do it with all your heart . As MLK Jr. reminded us: Even a street sweeper can leave a legacy by mastering their craft. When your work aligns with your passion? That‚Äôs not a job‚Äîit‚Äôs a calling.  
  
¬†**3. Something to Look Forward To**  
Life thrives on rhythm‚Äîand a little anticipation makes the ordinary extraordinary. Maybe it‚Äôs a weekend hike, a reunion with friends, a creative project, or simply savoring your favorite coffee tomorrow morning. These moments remind you that joy isn‚Äôt just in grand achievements; it‚Äôs in the small, intentional pauses that make the ‚Äúhave-to‚Äôs‚Äù worth it.  
  
**The Magic Happens When They Combine**  
Imagine this: Waking up to a day where you‚Äôre working on a project you adore, alongside people who light up your soul, while knowing something wonderful awaits you later. [That‚Äôs living.](https://www.degreelessmillionaire.com/)  
  
Happiness isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about weaving love, purpose, and hope into every chapter. Start today. Choose one key to nurture, and watch how the others fall into place. Your brightest days aren‚Äôt behind you‚Äîthey‚Äôre waiting to be created.¬†  
  
*""The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.""*

1jh2acd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jh2acd/my_wife_used_me_to_get_close_to_someone_else/,My wife used me to get close to someone else,"This has been sitting on my chest for weeks, and I can't talk to anyone about it yet. So I‚Äôm putting it here.

I‚Äôve been married for seven years. We have two kids. I met my wife when I relocated to a new city for work. I was in my early 30s, sent there for a corporate acquisition. I didn‚Äôt know anyone. She was 19 when we met‚Äîyoung, yes, but confident, sharp, disarming in a way that made me feel alive again.

We met outside a bookstore. I dropped my phone, she picked it up, made a joke about fate, and that was it. We clicked immediately. She was smart, bold, charming. Magnetic. I stayed. We moved fast‚Äîmoved in, married, built a life. I thought we were solid. I thought I was lucky.

About a month ago, I found a USB drive buried in an old storage box. It was labeled ‚ÄúARCHIVE.‚Äù It looked like something I‚Äôd forgotten about. Out of curiosity, I plugged it in.

What I found inside gutted me.

Photos. Notes. Videos. Dozens of files, most focused on someone I barely recognized‚Äîsomeone who used to work for my company years ago. He was a delivery driver who eventually became a manager. Quiet. Professional. He left a couple of years back.

What I now know is that he and my wife were in a relationship before I ever met her.

And she knew who I was before I knew her.

There were references to my name, my job title, my routine. She knew where I got coffee, what time I left work. She was watching. Waiting. There were notes‚Äî‚Äútry again next week,‚Äù ‚Äúwait for a cleaner opening.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt spontaneous. It was planned.

In one saved draft, she tells him she‚Äôs ‚Äúdating someone who works directly over you,‚Äù and that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to make things difficult.‚Äù The tone wasn‚Äôt begging. It was pressure.

And then there were the photos. Some were older, of them together before me. But some were more recent.There were explicit photos and videos. Her with him. 

While I was at work. While I was home with our son. While we were planning our future. She gave him parts of herself I didn‚Äôt know existed‚Äîsexually, emotionally, all of it. She recorded it. She saved it. She kept that version of herself completely separate from me.

I found toys, outfits, gear locked in cases behind her wardrobe and other places. Some I‚Äôd seen. Most I hadn‚Äôt. All of it matched what I saw on that drive.

From everything I can piece together, it continued well into our marriage. There‚Äôs a clear trail until about two years ago, when he left the city. After that‚Äînothing. Just silence.

She never said a word. Never slipped up. No signs of guilt. She‚Äôs still the same woman who makes dinner, kisses our kids goodnight, curls up next to me like nothing ever happened.

But I know now.

She gave another man the most private parts of herself‚Äîthe unfiltered, uninhibited version of her that I never got to see. She gave him everything she kept locked away from me.

And she used me to make it happen.

I confronted her a few days ago. At first, she denied it. Then she broke. Admitted to most of it. She was in a relationship with the guy for a couple of years but broke up after he got a job and then she threatened to use me to fire him if he didn't get back with her. Said it started as a plan to get close to him again, but she fell in love with me along the way. Said she‚Äôs ashamed, that she hates who she was back then, but that our life now is real. That she‚Äôs not that person anymore.

Then she brought up the kids.

She said we‚Äôve built something worth protecting. That breaking this apart wouldn‚Äôt just punish her‚Äîit would hurt them. And I know what she was doing. She wasn‚Äôt wrong, but she was using it.

She wants to move forward. To put it in the past. To treat it like a mistake she outgrew.

But it wasn‚Äôt just a mistake. It was years. And it was me. I wasn‚Äôt her second choice‚ÄîI was her strategy.

Now, every time she hugs me, I feel the space between what I believed and what I know.

I haven‚Äôt told anyone. I haven‚Äôt left. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do.

I just know I‚Äôm not the same person I was before I opened that drive.",0,1742624860.0,TrueOffMyChest,17,0.47,False

‚Ä¶


Sometimes I think of you in anger, and sometimes I think of you in pain, but each time, no matter how mad I get, I think about how much I loved you. 

I think about how I counted down mile markers on the drive back from your friend‚Äôs show before I got the courage to hold your hand. We were almost back in our town ‚Äî your town ‚Äî and I remember the bend in the highway when I convinced myself that enough was enough. And I reached for you and you let me. And I felt like fire inside the rest of the drive, because you, of all people, would hold my hand. You held it that night in the dark and you held it in the light. You held it when that man yelled slurs at us across the downtown avenue, crossing streets and crossing hearts, and we hurried back to our hotel and laughed at how close we were to the end of it all. 

I think about the first time I spent at your house, and how I danced outside with your big dog that would become ours; the dog we‚Äôd pick maggots out of when she became too old and ill and slow to fight the flies on her own. I‚Äôm still sorry you had to say goodbye alone. I‚Äôll always miss her. And you. 

But you didn‚Äôt care to say goodbye alone, did you?

I think about the desert landscape and the peacock cries and the saguaros  stabbing the sky. I think about the way copper melts and the heat of the fire and the impossible place you brought us. I think about oatmeal and coffee. I think about posole verde and tacos and beer. 

Sometimes I think of you in vain and the speech you told yourself in the mirror when you were young, and how I never could say the same for me. I think of the jealousy I felt. I think of the envy that I wasn‚Äôt the girl with the other name that you always went back to. 

I think of how you said you hope my daughter didn‚Äôt have my eyes, because the world would spoil.

She has my eyes and my face. And she has her father‚Äôs spirit.

And I think of how your world is spoiled. I think of how you ruined it all. And I think of how grateful I am, because I think you made me brave. And I think you made me scared. And I think you made me strong while keeping me weak. And I think you made me sure and steady. 

Sometimes I think of you. ",1,1742624605.0,prose,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve got myself a new beautiful black Profitec GO previous month.
In the last couple of days I‚Äôm experiencing the following:
1. When the machine is heating (after turning the machine on) - the pressure is slowly rising and can reach even to 9. This did not happen till now. Once FLU appears on the PID and I am running water through the group head, the pressure is going down to 0.
2. When brewing a coffee, the pressure bar is not going up to 8-9 as it used to, sometimes 3, sometimes 6. And on I‚Äôm stopping the brewing, the pressure goes up all the way to 9, until I flush the water (same as when the machine is heating)
Seems like there is pressure stuck somewehere? 
Anyway to figure what‚Äôs wrong and to fix it myself?

Asalamu alaikum wa rahmatulahi wa barakatuh,

First off, i wanted to thank u/cell-apprehensive23 for giving this idea of posting on this platform. The reason i am posting on this platform is because there are very limited avenues to look for people interested in polygyny. 

The reason that i am looking for a co-wife on behalf of my husband is because i feel like this may be a good way to establish trust / rapport with a potential co-wife (because a man can claim that his first wife is supportive of polygyny, but unfortunately we have heard of stories where the men have lied about this being the case, etc). If it's coming directly from a woman, i would hope that this would help put more sister's hearts at ease. 

I am looking for a co-wife for my husband. I understand we live in times where polygyny is frowned upon. I also understand we live in times where unfortunately polygyny has been associated with horror stories / conflicts / jealousy leading to bad adab (manners) from amongst co-wives.

I first want to start of with clarifying that since i embraced Islam (over 5 years ago), i started to imagine that a polygynous relationship would suit my personality. Also, i genuinely enjoy learning about the deen, and thought that with the time my husband spends with my future co-wife, i could devote that time to learning more, attending classes and increasing in good deeds for this life and the next. 

The thing is, if i were married to any other man, perhaps Allah (swt) would not have opened my heart as much to the idea of polygyny. The reason why i am supportive / encouraging him to have another wife is because i genuinely - with all my heart - want another sister to experience the ease, the love, the mercy, the compassion and the companionship my husband has given me.

We can learn alot about a man through asking their wife. My husband has never once raised his voice at me, shown his annoyance or fallen short of his responsibilities mashaAllah. If anything, he has exeeded my expectations with his gentle nature, good adab and above-average empathic personality. My husband's other strength (in addition to many) is that he is amazing with being upfront / truthful / clear with his expectations from the beginning so that no one is left guessing. In a world where people struggle to establish clear boundaries, my husband has been gifted this ability which is extremely important for a man wanting to consider polygyny.¬†

Knowing my husband's personality, i know that he has been gifted by Allah (swt) with the ability to take on the responsibility of having a second wife. My husband and i view having a 2nd wife as an opportunity to increase our family, increase in happiness and love for this life and the next. I pray that we can be an example of a loving and merciful family and i pray that our actions can reflect that we are people who fear Allah (swt).

Extra information about my husband (age, height, etc) can be confirmed via dm for anyone interested.
