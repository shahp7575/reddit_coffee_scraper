It was during Christmas time and all gifts were wrapped in those colors , i dint even pay much attention to that detail and i tried to explain the same to her but she misunderstood for romantic gesture and fought for months and gave me silent treatment for 5 months .


1.	‚Å†Does not let me sit on the couch in the hall without shower even for few minutes In the morning if it want to sit and enjoy my morning coffee.
2.	‚Å†Hides tv remote when she is not watching the tv .
3.	‚Å†Rage over small things like forgetting to replace the paper towel in kitchen , not finishing her left overs when she goes on a trip .

4 . Rage and fight for 3 hours over the joke that I said about my immunity being stronger than her when she fell sick cause of pollen . She asked me to leave the apartment over that joke and I am searching right now for a new one .

5. No matter how much I clean it‚Äôs never enough for her and she may be having ocd .

6. One time I agreed to help and buy her groceries as she dint want to come and I told her after coming back that  it took 2 hours of my time and it would have been nice if she had come instead of nicely watching tv . She dint like that and gave me silent treatment for 2 months and had a huge fight and accused me of not being happy for her . I let that go thinking she must be frustrated with her situation as she was waiting for a new job to start after 6 months of being unemployed.

7 , I went on a trip with my friend group and dint mention this to her as her job recently started and assumed it‚Äôs hard for her to take a vacation.  She picked a fight and accused me of making this plan so that I can sleep with the guys and intentionally not telling her . All my friend group are happily married and we only had permit for 4 people for the backpacking trip and hence their family could not join on this one .

8 . I am not allowed to ask any questions regarding her dating life or work life  etc and should only listen to what she shares as she thinks that I wish bad for her for some reason I can‚Äôt understand.

There were several fights over minor things and she blames everything on me and months of silent treatment . At this point I am starting to think that I could be living with a narcissist . I stayed thinking I could fix issues and be a better person ",1,1746295918.0,narcissism,1,1.0,False

Been almost three months since we broke up. Though we kept some contact, it was kind of superficial. Somehow, I wanted it back - yes, ik, once it‚Äôs over, it is over.

Just some backstory - there wasn‚Äôt any sort of cheating, it was simply because things didn‚Äôt work out - and also because we ended up long distance for more than seven months.

Now the twist - I was getting done with my training, and maybe, a just a small part of me, was getting ready to move on. I get a text, from an unsaved but familiar number. ‚ÄúX has given me an offer letter‚Äù (X pertaining to the company name). Text 2 arrives, ‚ÄúIts in Kochi, I felt I needed to let you know‚Äù. My heart skipped beats, head whirled, felt all nauseated.

Couple days after - I had helped her regarding some onboarding formalities, before her asking (she might have not asked, still). We talked, she seemed a bit indifferent - but yeah, we agreed to have coffee.

The day - I was so fucking anxious. Still, I put on my best self and decided to wait for her to text. No texts in the morning. (Ofc I was kidding myself, why on earth would would she have the need to acknowledge me). ‚ÄúLunch break, for sure, she will text‚Äù. Nope, no sir.

To clarify, the wait wasn‚Äôt for reconciliation - it was just to confront this anxiety, to see an old friend, to bid adieu in the nicest way possible, to put bandages to an open wound that might never be closed.

She had seen another friend of mine in the break. That gave me an ache.
I decided to text her as the day was almost getting over. ‚ÄúAm in cabin C, will see you‚Äù. I waited outside the cabin, heart thumping, blood rushing, hands all cold. I saw her through the glass. She was with a couple of friends (from college). She was happy, I guess.

Now, there she comes. ‚ÄúHello‚Äù. (hello, stranger). She talked as if she met me for the first time, and as if I was a sales associate knocking on her door to desperately sell some books.
‚ÄúCan we have coffee?‚Äù. 
‚ÄúSorry, there‚Äôs a brother of mine, Rahul, coming to see me. He works in infopark‚Äù. 
Why wouldn‚Äôt I know you have a brother? Why wouldn‚Äôt I know his name? Why wouldn‚Äôt I know he works here? 
The tone, the unfamiliarity, everything together was so much for me to handle. I left the place, a tear in my eye, disguised with my glasses on.

They named it original sin

It was separation.
The slow forgetting of the One

Offer coffee.

I'm in my late 20s, and I recently ended a friendship that had started out really meaningful but took a pretty hurtful turn. Now I‚Äôm second-guessing myself ‚Äî did I overreact, or was it the right call?

This friend (I'll call him Charles) and I met through my university‚Äôs library. We clicked quickly, and over time, I opened up to him about some heavy personal stuff ‚Äî childhood trauma, family conflict, and my mental health, including some dark thoughts I‚Äôd had in the past. I genuinely believed he was someone I could trust.

Eventually, he invited me to his church group. I didn‚Äôt mind at first, but the tone gradually shifted ‚Äî especially when political talk started dominating things. I made it clear I wasn‚Äôt comfortable getting into politics, but Charles and his brother kept pushing, mostly with pro-Trump stuff. It got personal when Charles questioned if my values were just ""inherited from my dad"" ‚Äî even after I told him I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. He wouldn't let it go.

I finally told him his behavior was upsetting and that I felt I was owed an apology. Instead of texting back reasonably, he insisted on meeting in person ‚Äî but not before announcing that our friendship was ‚Äúalready over.‚Äù I showed up anyway and even got him coffee, hoping we could talk like adults. But instead of owning up to anything, he said I had low self-esteem, accused me of dragging him down to my level, and at one point told me I was ‚Äútalking like the devil.‚Äù He even tried to initiate a prayer I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with. I left feeling humiliated and decided that was it ‚Äî I cut ties.

Since then, I‚Äôve distanced myself not only from him but also from his church group and mutual connections. I thought I‚Äôd feel relief, but instead, I feel unsettled. His brother removed me on LinkedIn out of the blue, and Charles acts overly casual when we run into each other ‚Äî like nothing happened, just giving fist bumps and acting upbeat. Some mutual friends have reached out to me, but I haven‚Äôt really engaged ‚Äî just said I was busy.

Now I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he might be telling others the things I confided in him ‚Äî the deeply personal stuff ‚Äî maybe even spinning it to make me look unstable or bitter. I feel like I‚Äôve lost control over my own story, and it‚Äôs been eating at me.

Today, I saw him sitting two seats in front of me at the library (his back was facing me). When. got up to go for a drink, he quickly grabbed his stuff and moved 4 rows down and sat facing towards me. what's that all about ? How do you even process that kind of betrayal without exploding?

But seriously, what if I told you there are ways to reign in that chaotic brain of ours without resorting to meditation? üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Today, I wanted to share my favorite ‚ÄúFocus Hack‚Äù and see what you guys swear by too!

**So here‚Äôs mine:** **The Pomodoro Technique.** üçÖ

This little gem has been a game-changer for me. It‚Äôs simple, effective, and allows me to channel my inner productivity beast! Here's how it works:

1. **Pick Your Task:** Find something that needs your attention. This could be work, studying, or even organizing your sock drawer (hey, adulting is hard).
   
2. **Set a Timer:** Start with 25 minutes. That‚Äôs right‚Äîjust 25! Set a timer and dive deep into your task.

3. **Work Like Crazy:** No distractions, just pure focus. It‚Äôs like a mini-mission every time. Imagine you're in a spy movie and every second counts! üé¨

4. **Time's Up? Take a Break!** When that timer goes off, take a 5-minute break. Stretch, grab a snack, or just stare at the wall (seriously, sometimes that‚Äôs the best part).

5. **Repeat:** After 4 cycles, treat yourself to a longer break (15-30 minutes). You‚Äôve earned it, champ!

Why I love this? It gives my brain a deadline, and trust me, there's nothing like a little pressure to kick those procrastination gremlins to the curb. Plus, the breaks help me recharge so I‚Äôm not running on empty by the end of the day.

But hey, I know the Pomodoro Technique isn‚Äôt for everyone. 

**What about you?** 

- Do you have a quirky focus hack that works wonders?
- Maybe it‚Äôs something unexpected, like working in a funky coffee shop, or perhaps blasting 80s music? üé∂
- Or is it as simple as putting your phone in another room?

1kdz55a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1kdz55a/colleague_dynamics/,colleague dynamics,"I am tenure track woman at an R2, state school, been in my current position for a few years.

I like my institution, hope to stay awhile, but I am finding some colleague dynamics distressing and am hopeful for some advice here.

There is one colleague in particular, I will call him Jim. When I first arrived Jim was very welcoming in  the formal ways which I appreciated. As I started to get settled Jim started making light comments about my appearance ( say if i wore heels one day he would make a casual pointed comment), then continual comments on my clothing , makeup choices. He then started sending me direct messages on my social media accounts.  The DM's were usually some funny post he wanted to share or some private comment about a post I made.

I asked him to stop, just because I really don't pay close attention to DM's and I would hate to miss an important message from a colleague but also I just prefer formal channels. He kept ""forgetting"". I now just ignore them, as he has multiple email addresses for me as well as my phone number ( something I wish I would have never given him now tbh)

Our offices are near each other and there are 4 different entrances into the building. I usually take the front entrance but sometimes I take another entrance that is quicker but that one goes right by his office window: not super close but close enough for him to clock who is entering/leaving the building.

One day he made some comment about my comings and goings and it just felt a little creepy. So in general I avoid that entrance now, but I took it once a few weeks ago and he immediately texted me about it. Just a joke, but it made me wildly uncomfortable and I felt that it would not be wise for me to say anything, and made note to self to not take that exit/entrance anymore.

Then there are student issues, Jim is very territorial with some of his students. He would hint to me that a conversation he had with student would include advice I gave the same student, generally going against my advice. I try not to take this too seriously. I think students should be getting as many inputs as possible, but it has changed the way I speak with any of the students that I know he is territorial about, and I feel that it's strange that he would share that information with me.

There is another colleague I have who is also a bit territorial, but I just figure this is all par for the course and I just need to work around it the best I can. With Jim it feels heavier because of all the other things.

Jim also sends me emails on my courses that no one else in my department does: asking questions, making comments etc... at one point I realized he was asking me questions he absolutely knew the answers to, but was seeing what I knew etc...a competition of sorts. We teach in the same overall field but not the same area and I never have seen him as competition. He is a big braggart and I have noticed the only way to talk to him really is to let him talk about himself. This doesn't bother me if anything it makes him easier to deal with.

Jim  also does a lot of socializing with students, under the rubric of ""teaching"" in a way I would never be comfortable.

Jim has also invited me out a few times post working hours. I have politely declined. Luckily that has stopped.

I am more than happy to gather with colleagues on campus, always inviting people out for coffee, a lunch,  but I really protect my non work time for my family and friends, and I rarely will do any after hours anything with any colleague. I don't really let my work life get too close, just because my area is pretty intensive and I need boundaries around my other time away from campus just for my mental health.

Lastly, I am also an assault survivor and Jim's constant clocking of me raises all my alarms. And makes me wonder if I need to contact HR?

But in my head I keep telling myself it's just my filter and bias (I personally am not comfortable hanging out with most hetero male colleagues like Jim alone) unless it's on campus, no after hours anything unless it's a group of us. But Jim's constant focus on me is also making me question if I can stay at my current institution. I also am resenting  some of the emotional labor. Just writing all this is pissing me off. As a woman in my field there has always been some uncomfortable dynamics, but at this point in my career I was really hoping it would end.  Thanks for reading.",4,1746295519.0,Professors,2,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19.30ish. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

Would love and appreciate some advice on what to do next. I was just trying to to put a smooth clear coat on this coffee table.

I stained it and did a few coats of poly spray to seal, then did a glaze coat with famowood (used a quart, a little under their low-end recommendation for the square footage).

Made a comical amount of mistakes on first application - did it outside not in a tent (about 45 bugs stuck), part of the table in direct sunlight, didn't have a torch (was using a lighter), gave up on getting rid of bubbles after an hour of lighter work and they hardened, didn't use quite enough for it to self-level, didn't have all the tools that were recommended, and more I'm sure.

I did a rough sand at 150 grit for an hour or so, but stopped to get some advice before I go further.

What can I do to salvage this and get a clear coat on it? It's about 10 square feet.",2,1746295380.0,epoxy,0,1.0,False
1kdz1t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtsyWeirdoPerfume/comments/1kdz1t0/trying_out_alkemia/,Trying out Alkemia!,"I keep seeing recommendations for Alkemia all over the perfume subreddits and decided to take a chance on a bunch of samples, even though they seem glaringly similar to Hexennacht and Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab which I don‚Äôt really care for. Well, if they end up smelling cheap it‚Äôs because they are, so I decided to have fun with some cheapie indies and see what I end up with. *spoiler: I actually really liked most of them!*

I got two sample sets, one choose your own, and one ‚Äúcurated‚Äù set where I tell them notes I do and don‚Äôt like and what kind of vibe I want and let them pick for me. 

For the choose your own I picked the following:

**Seaglass** - star fruit, mango, yuzu, lemon verbena, seafoam sage, French tarragon, rosewood, cypress, saffron, gray ambergris, and a kiss of saltwater from the sea - **This was my most disappointing pick. All I really get out of it is the sage and tarragon, and it smells like a generic men‚Äôs scent, very similar to classic Old Spice. Not a bad smell, but I was really hoping for some tangy fruits and salty ambergris to show up.**

**The First Dandelion** - sunny dandelion flowers, green dandelion leaves, and warm dirt - **This one is super green! Smells exactly like mowing the lawn, definitely gives me the vibe of laying in the grass among the dandelions as a kid.**

**Ecstasies of Light** - white amber infused with pear blossoms, white figs, bergamot, gorse flowers, winter honeysuckle, and osmanthus - **this is a sweet yellow floral, very soft with almost no sillage, but it‚Äôs bright and happy smelling!**

**Cosmic Lotus** - sacred incense, Egyptian musk, and fully blooming lotus flowers - **a nice aquatic lotus that quickly fades into an Egyptian musk scent.**

**Nocturnes of the Honeysuckle** - Night blooming honeysuckle, sweet galium, sweet fern, and soft mosses are gently embraced by delicate vanilla and fresh tea leaves - **greens and soft white florals, doesn‚Äôt really smell much like honeysuckle but it does smell nice! Fairy forest vibes for sure.**

For the curated set I gave them this to work with:

Dislike: Cherry, almond, honey, sugar, marshmallow, ambroxan/cetalox. 

Like: all florals, vetiver, citrus, amber, oud, iso e super, tea, smoke/incense, apricot, peach, black currant, blackberry, fig, petrichor, patchouli, sandalwood, hinoki, cardamom, ginger, greens. 

Aesthetic/vibe: inner city minimalist gothic, city witch, modern-day Lilith

They had a super quick turnaround on my order which made me think they didn‚Äôt really give much thought to my curated list lol, but here are the samples I received, and I do think they did a great job with the notes and the vibe except for the city/minimalist part, but that‚Äôs probably just not in their wheelhouse:

**Elixir of Aphrodite** - Persian apricots dipped in orange blossom honey swirling with a sensual enchantment of peach and plum blossoms, mimosa, white star jasmine, ambrette, guaiac wood, and vanilla musk - **super sweet peaches and apricots, very ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù smelling, definitely a good sexy spring scent**

**Dark Goddess** - black amber, earthy vetiver root, dark red roses, spicy carnation, black Java vanilla, black locust, oakmoss, black pine resin, civet, myrrh, and bay leaf - **earthy and resinous soil scent, dark forest, witchy vibes for sure!**

**As Dark Things are Meant to be Loved** - Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf - **a sweeter take on darkness, the coffee and coconut really come through with just a hint of smokiness.**

**Femme Sauvage** - wild blackberries, voluptuous musk, randy dark patchouli, and the warmth of come-hither ambers - **blackberry and patchouli stand out here, it‚Äôs a really nice combo! Earthy yet sweet, summery in a dark way.**

**Carmilla** - Ambre marocain, cashmere musk, Malgas lily, Ylang-ylang, dark Bourbon rose, soft patchouli, and erotic whispers of jasmine incense - **sweet, dark floral. Jasmine and rose really stand out in this one.**

**Shine Bright My Desire** - golden amber, star jasmine, pink lotus, and orchid swathed in patchouli boudoir incense ignited by passionate kisses of pink pepper, Ceylon cinnamon, ginger zest, and bright verbena - **the ginger really comes through up front, this one has very low sillage. A nice light, subtle, clean gingery scent that I could see wearing on super hot days.**

Overall, this was a fun haul! None of the scents have much sillage, which I expect from an oil, but some are extremely subtle so I mentioned it on those scents. Most of these seem to have almost no longevity to speak of, which is a little disappointing, but Elixir of Aphrodite seems promising as one that will stick around for more than an hour! Nothing smells super waxy to my nose like BPAL and newer Hexennacht offerings have done, so that‚Äôs a total win! Definitely a fun haul and I may be ordering bigger versions of a couple of these in the future!

We are looking for a 4th member of my little group of night owl weirdos to come rock out some bread and pastries. If you're not sure if you're interested or qualified, hear me out! 

What you DO need:
- dependability 
- cooperative attitude
- communication 
- time management 
- take instructions 
- availability overnight (roughly 10pm-6am) including weekends

What you DON'T need:
- baking/kitchen experience 
- this to be your only job 
- social skills other than aforementioned 

The job entails:
- baking off the daily batches of bread and pastry, most of which has been started by day team
- a little upper body strength, the scones are a workout 
- keeping track of supply needs 

Pros:
- pretty much never interact with customers 
- mostly have kitchen to yourself 
- all the coffee you can drink (Herman's Boy!) 
- learn craft from an experienced pastry chef/baker
- normal people hours left free
- we're super cool /s

Cons:
- small team means more responsibility
- night work isn't for everyone 
- health benefits not available (yet!) 

I can't personally give most details about pay etc since my job is more about training and supporting the team but other than that I'm happy to answer questions! It is likely that whoever we hire is going to be groomed as my replacement as lead so maybe keep that in mind as a potential move up within a few months. 

I've been with Wealthy for 4 years and it's been by far the best job I've ever had. I am planning on moving away at the end of this year and I'm sad to leave it behind, but I want to do what I can to leave my team and the community that loves the bakeries in good hands.

1kdyzt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kdyzt0/explore_the_quqiyso_copper21_french_press_review/,Explore the QUQIYSO Copper-21 French Press Review: Is It Worth the Hype?,"Using the **QUQIYSO Copper-21 French Press**, I‚Äôve experienced a new dimension of brewing coffee at home, and it has undoubtedly added a sense of satisfaction and style to my daily ritual. The sophisticated copper finish immediately catches the eye, and with its elegant design, it doesn‚Äôt just brew coffee‚Äîit becomes part of your kitchen decor. For a coffee enthusiast like myself, the visual appeal is an excellent first impression, but there‚Äôs so much more to uncover about this product.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
The thing that truly defines this French Press is the super-efficient filtering system. With its dual-layered filter comprising a perforated plate and an 80-mesh filter, this setup ensures a virtually sediment-free cup every single time. I noticed an immediate difference in flavor clarity compared to some of the cheaper models I‚Äôd tried before. While preparing my favorite medium-roast coffee, I found that the QUQIYSO Copper-21 extracts all the vibrant flavors while keeping the gritty bits out. The process is smooth, uncomplicated, and honestly feels like a meditative morning exercise for anyone who takes joy in manual brewing methods.  

[Check QUQIYSO Copper-21 French Press price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0b589s46b/)

**Design and Durability**  
This copper beauty isn‚Äôt just about looks; there‚Äôs substance beneath the style. Having personally cleaned and handled it almost daily for months now, I can confirm that the borosilicate glass beaker stands firm against heat changes without cracking. The handles are well-designed, avoiding any awkward grips or too-hot-to-touch moments. While the lid requires a little extra care during washing to prevent scratches, the overall durability is remarkable. With BPA-free components, it‚Äôs also reassuring to know my coffee experience is toxin-free.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Despite its refined aesthetics, the French Press is incredibly user-friendly. This aspect stood out to me when my partner, who isn‚Äôt a coffee fanatic, had no issues operating it during his first go. Whether you want to brew coffee, steep loose-leaf tea, or even whip up frothy almond milk, the design makes it all intuitive. Cleaning is equally hassle-free; the glass beaker and filter can go in the dishwasher, making life considerably easier. However, note that the lid isn‚Äôt dishwasher-safe and demands handwashing with gentle care, which is one minor inconvenience for someone in a hurry.

**Strengths**  
- Sleek copper finish adds elegance to any space  
- Dual-layer filtration provides a smooth, grit-free coffee  
- Multifunctional‚Äîuse it for coffee, tea, or cold brews  
- Durable and heat-resistant borosilicate glass construction  

**Shortcomings**  
- Lid isn‚Äôt dishwasher safe and requires careful hand cleaning  
- The 21 oz capacity might feel a tad small for larger households  
- Copper finish can scratch if mishandled  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing it against similar options like the Bodum Chambord, I‚Äôd say this French Press holds its own well. While the Bodum emphasizes timeless simplicity, the QUQIYSO Copper-21 stands out with its copper finish and reinforced durability. Additionally, the filtering quality feels more refined with this one. On the other hand, brands like Espro P3 offer superior micro-filters, albeit at a significantly higher price, leaving QUQIYSO as the more affordable yet high-performing option. For those wanting unique aesthetics and uncompromising coffee quality, the QUQIYSO shines brightly.

**Value Proposition**  
Is it worth investing in this French Press? Considering the premium features it offers‚Äîtop-tier filtering, a robust build, and multifunctional brewing‚Äîits price-point aligns well with its value. I appreciate that it eliminates the need for disposable filters, saving money in the long haul and lowering my waste footprint. It‚Äôs rare to encounter a coffee product that strikes such a great price-to-performance ratio.

The ""I was too lazy to do dishes so this is what's clean"" old cookware. Not the torn up but comfy weekend sweats. 

The normal day to day stuff that's outlived it's usefulness but you still feel guilty replacing. 

I know *exactly* where it comes from. It comes from never being provided with new underwear until they literally disintegrated because ""who's going to see them?"" Idk my friends in gym class? That boy I don't dare tell you about because you police my body and sexuality? ME??? Even if no one sees them, *I* know, and now as an adult just knowing you're wearing something cute or sexy under your clothes *for yourself* is a confidence boost. 

Why can't I have them??? 

She'd say ""Mine are like that too. They don't last anyway."" Ok well maybe you're fine with stains and holes and ripped out waistbands but I'm not. 

Cookwear is the same way. I'm embarrassed to admit I couldn't remember the last time I bought cookware because it doesn't generally ""fall apart"". It does, however , rust and the non stick coating wears down. So I'm in the process of replacing all that. 

Shoes. ""You have shoes."" Well I need gym shoes. ""There's nothing wrong with what you have"". Except they weren't *sports* shoes of any type or quality. I had a pair of Keds and a pair of Payless ""running"" shoes. I was trying to play softball in flimsy canvas Keds. Because they were $5. 

I don't need top of the line *anything*. Probably wouldn't buy it even if I could afford it. I've always been totally okay with mid range, well made *whatever*. There's a very small handful of things I will drop cash on (work shoes..... I'm in healthcare and the $200 Brooks or On Clouds are a *necessity*, not a want). But it's because those things are genuinely NEEDED. But I still feel guilty about it. 

I couldn't have clothes that fit. Everything had to be 2 sizes too big because my grandma could sew and she could ""hem"" it amd ""take it in"". I had pants 10"" too long ""hemmed"" and then ""taken down"" with weird fade lines. 

I feel guilty replacing old chipped furniture because it's ""just a coffee table"" or ""you paid good money for that"". 

I slept on the same mattress for 15 years because it never occurred to me they wear out. I had ONE my whole life at Nmom's place.

1kdyyif,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kdyyif/can_olixis_portable_ice_maker_truly_keep_up_with/,Can OLIXIS Portable Ice Maker Truly Keep Up with Daily Demands Review?,"Testing the OLIXIS OLM-PBK Portable Ice Machine has been quite a refreshing experience! This compact countertop ice maker is marketed as a rapid and portable ice-making solution, and being someone who loves their iced coffee and chilled beverages, I was more than curious to see if it would live up to the hype. With features like bullet-shaped ice cubes, self-cleaning functionality, and portable design, I couldn't resist putting it to the test.

**Design and Compactness**

The black stainless steel and plastic build of this portable ice maker blends seamlessly with my kitchen countertop. Its sleek, minimalist design looks modern and sophisticated without taking up much space. Measuring 11.6"" D x 8.8"" W x 12.5"" H, it's small enough to fit snugly into tight corners yet capacious enough to satisfy regular ice demands. I found the integrated handle particularly useful when moving it to my deck for an impromptu outdoor barbecue. The transparent top window is a neat touch, as it lets me peek at the ice formation process without interrupting. With this design, having a dependable ice maker at close reach never felt so convenient.

**Quick Ice Production**

The most striking claim here was the rapid production of nine bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes. After testing, I can confirm the OLIXIS OLM-PBK does deliver on this front. In less time than it takes for me to chop fruit for a smoothie, this device churns out crystal-clear ice. This speed is a game-changer during parties or when I need fresh ice for a second batch of drinks. Over a 24-hour period, it manages to generate up to 26.5 pounds of ice. This performance exceeded my expectations; unless you're running a cafe, that‚Äôs more than enough ice for most personal or family needs.

[Check OLIXIS OLM-PBK price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dlh7nfq2/)

**Advantages**

- Two sizes of ice cubes (small and large) for versatile use in beverages or to keep seafood fresh.  
- Whisper-quiet operation with noise levels under 40dB‚Äîquieter than my fridge.  
- User-friendly control panel with light indicators for water refill and full ice basket.  

**Self-Cleaning and Maintenance**

One of the major headaches with ice makers is cleaning them, but the self-cleaning function of this unit simplifies the process. By holding the power button for five seconds, it activates the cleaning mode. This has saved me time and ensures that my ice remains hygienic, which is especially appreciated during flu season in my household. While consistent self-cleaning doesn‚Äôt completely replace manual checks, it does minimize the frequency with which I have to deep-clean it myself.

**Portability for Various Situations**

Weighing 15.4 pounds, this unit feels surprisingly lightweight for how much it offers. I‚Äôve taken it to my friend‚Äôs potluck party and even loaded it into our RV for a weekend trip. Its portability makes it an asset not just at home but also for camping, tailgating, and even small office gatherings. This adaptability is rare to find in an appliance without compromising functionality.

**Highlights**

- Compact yet efficient design perfect for kitchens, bars, offices, and RVs.  
- Bullet ice cubes that are smooth and safe for consumption and don‚Äôt damage glassware.  
- Handy carry handle for enhanced portability.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**

Despite how much I loved testing the OLIXIS OLM-PBK, there were a few quirks worth mentioning:  

- The ice cubes tend to melt quickly unless immediately transferred to a freezer.  
- While the self-cleaning function is handy, it doesn‚Äôt entirely eliminate the need for manual maintenance occasionally.  
- Limited water capacity (1.5 L) might necessitate frequent refills during extended use.  

**Competing Brands**

Comparing this product to competitors like the GE Profile Opal and Igloo Ice Maker, the OLIXIS product holds its own quite well. The GE Profile Opal, though excellent for its nugget ice and Bluetooth app integration, is significantly pricier and bulkier. On the other hand, the Igloo Ice Maker matches the OLIXIS model‚Äôs compact portability but sacrifices the self-cleaning feature, which I‚Äôve found indispensable. If affordability and essential features are what you prioritize, this ice maker comfortably outperforms its rivals for daily use while hitting a sweet spot in the market.

**Bang for the Buck**

While the upfront cost might initially make you hesitate, the value proposition here is tremendous. With features such as self-cleaning, versatile ice sizes, and whisper-quiet operation, this machine‚Äôs performance justifies its price for frequent users like households, small offices, or adventurous campers. Investing in this compact machine saves you from the recurring costs of buying bagged ice or dealing with low-quality alternatives.

Key benefits they promise:



Boost energy naturally



Improve focus and brain performance



Support healthy weight management



Reduce joint pain and inflammation



Fight cellular aging



To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.



üî¨ What‚Äôs Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)

What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health ‚Äî not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.



Some of the star ingredients include:



CoQ10 ‚Äì Supports cellular energy and heart health



PQQ ‚Äì Promotes the growth of new mitochondria



Acetyl-L-Carnitine ‚Äì Improves mental clarity and memory



Alpha Lipoic Acid ‚Äì Fights oxidative stress



Resveratrol ‚Äì Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties



Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 ‚Äì Essential for energy production



Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging ‚Äî mitochondrial decline.



‚úÖ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?

I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed ‚Äî 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:



‚úÖ Week 1:

Slight increase in morning energy



Clearer mental focus during work



No crash in the afternoon like before



‚úÖ Week 2:

Woke up before my alarm ‚Äî feeling refreshed



Digestion felt smoother



Less brain fog



I started to feel ‚Äúlighter‚Äù



‚úÖ Week 3:

My energy levels felt stable and strong all day



I could focus better at work for longer periods



My workouts improved ‚Äî less joint pain



I noticed a mood boost too ‚Äî more optimistic



‚úÖ Week 4:

I felt like I got my younger self back



I stopped reaching for coffee



My weight dropped by 3 pounds



I felt clear-headed, more active, and even happier



üí• Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN

After one month, here‚Äôs what changed drastically:



‚ö° Energy: I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.



üß† Focus: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.

üí™ Recovery: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.



ü¶¥ Joint Relief: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.



‚ú® Overall Mood: I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.



üò¨ MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know

No review is honest without mentioning the downsides ‚Äî and yes, MITOLYN has a few:



1. Not Instant

You won‚Äôt feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù ‚Äî it‚Äôs a science-backed long-term upgrade.

It‚Äôs not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth the investment.



3. Limited Stock

This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2‚Äì3 bottles upfront.

Feeling constantly tired



Struggling with brain fog or poor memory



Battling joint pain

It‚Äôs a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I‚Äôve tried dozens of products over the years ‚Äî but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.

I Was Exhausted, Mentally and Physically ‚Äì Until MITOLYN

Before I found MITOLYN, my life felt like it was slipping through my fingers. I‚Äôm a 42-year-old professional with a family, a career, and what should be a vibrant life. But I felt tired all the time. No matter how much I slept, I woke up feeling like I hadn‚Äôt rested at all. I couldn‚Äôt focus at work. My motivation was gone. My workouts felt pointless. Even spending time with my kids became a struggle.



Doctors told me everything looked ""normal"" in my labs. But I knew something was wrong.



Then, late one night while searching for answers online, I stumbled upon MITOLYN ‚Äì a supplement designed to revitalize mitochondrial function, the powerhouse of every cell in your body. I was skeptical. I‚Äôve tried dozens of supplements over the years, and nothing ever made a difference. But something about MITOLYN was different.



What caught my attention was scientific backing. The creators of MITOLYN aren‚Äôt just marketers ‚Äì they‚Äôre experts in cellular health and anti-aging science. The formula includes powerful ingredients like Urolithin A, NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), PQQ, CoQ10, and Resveratrol, all clinically studied to improve mitochondrial health, reduce inflammation, and restore cellular energy.



I figured I had nothing to lose‚Ä¶ so I ordered my first bottle.



The First 7 Days ‚Äì Noticeable Energy Shift

By day three, I noticed I was waking up feeling just a little bit lighter. My brain fog began to lift. I wasn‚Äôt chugging 3 cups of coffee by noon anymore.



By day seven, the difference was impossible to ignore. I had energy. Not the jittery kind you get from energy drinks ‚Äì this was real, steady, sustainable energy. I felt alive in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.



My productivity at work soared. I even started jogging again, something I hadn‚Äôt done in months. MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just give me energy ‚Äì it gave me hope.



By Week 4 ‚Äì I Got My Life Back

I can‚Äôt overstate this: MITOLYN gave me my life back. After 30 days, I felt 10 years younger. I was waking up refreshed. My mental clarity was razor sharp. My skin looked healthier. My digestion improved. My mood lifted.



The chronic inflammation and ‚Äúdrag‚Äù that had haunted me for years seemed to melt away.



Even my wife noticed the changes ‚Äì not just in my energy, but in my confidence, my happiness, my presence as a father and partner.



Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

What sets MITOLYN apart isn‚Äôt just its ingredient list ‚Äì it‚Äôs the synergistic formula and absorption technology. Many supplements throw together popular buzzwords but don‚Äôt deliver results. MITOLYN uses bioavailable forms of each compound, meaning your body actually absorbs and uses the nutrients.



Each capsule is packed with potent, clean, and clinically researched ingredients that:



‚úÖ Boost mitochondrial regeneration

‚úÖ Support ATP (energy) production

‚úÖ Reduce oxidative stress and cellular aging

‚úÖ Improve brain function and memory

‚úÖ Enhance cardiovascular and metabolic health



This is not a gimmick. It‚Äôs not a temporary caffeine fix. MITOLYN works from the cellular level up ‚Äì addressing the root cause of fatigue, brain fog, and early aging.



Real People, Real Results ‚Äì I‚Äôm Not Alone

After joining a MITOLYN Facebook support group, I realized something powerful: thousands of people were experiencing the same transformation. From tired moms to aging professionals to fitness enthusiasts ‚Äì MITOLYN was restoring lives everywhere.



I read stories of people recovering from burnout, reversing age-related decline, and feeling youthful again ‚Äì all thanks to this one product. That gave me even more confidence that MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just hype ‚Äì it‚Äôs the real deal.



Safe, Natural, and Backed by Science

Another reason I trust MITOLYN is its purity and transparency. It‚Äôs manufactured in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility in the USA, with no artificial fillers, no gluten, and no GMOs. You can actually scan the barcode and see the lab results.



And they offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. That means if you don‚Äôt feel a dramatic improvement in your energy and focus, you can get your money back. No hassle.



But trust me: you won‚Äôt be asking for a refund.



Who Should Use MITOLYN?

If you:



Feel tired even after a full night‚Äôs sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or motivation



Experience chronic stress or mental burnout



Want to slow down aging from the inside out



Are dealing with inflammation, weight gain, or metabolic issues



Want to support your heart, brain, and cellular health long-term



Then MITOLYN is for you.



Final Verdict ‚Äì Buy It Now Before It Sells Out

MITOLYN is not just another supplement ‚Äì it‚Äôs a life-changer. I‚Äôve already stocked up on 6 bottles because I never want to go back to feeling like I used to.



I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say this: MITOLYN should be in every medicine cabinet. It‚Äôs the closest thing to a ‚Äúcellular reset‚Äù I‚Äôve ever experienced. It gave me back my energy, my focus, and my joy. And it might just do the same for you.



Don‚Äôt waste years searching for solutions that don‚Äôt work. Start with the one that does. MITOLYN is in high demand, and it sells out fast ‚Äì so if it‚Äôs in stock right now, grab it.



You owe it to yourself ‚Äì and your future ‚Äì to try MITOLYN.



Update: 3 Months Later ‚Äì Still Going Strong!



I‚Äôve now been taking MITOLYN for over 3 months, and the benefits have only compounded. I‚Äôve lost 12 pounds without even trying. My blood pressure is better. My mood is stable. And I genuinely look forward to each day with purpose and energy.



MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just restore my health. It restored my freedom.



If you're still on the fence, I get it. But just try one bottle. Just one. You‚Äôll feel the shift ‚Äì and you‚Äôll never look back.",1,1746294972.0,TheCosmicWheelSister,1,1.0,False

MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just restore my health. It restored my freedom.

I never thought I'd be writing a review like this. In fact, I used to be the person who avoided smiling in photos, kept my mouth slightly closed when laughing, and constantly worried about bad breath‚Äîeven after brushing. My teeth weren‚Äôt falling out or anything drastic, but they just didn‚Äôt feel healthy. I had bleeding gums, sensitive teeth, and this constant ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù feeling on my tongue no matter how often I brushed.



‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



I tried all the typical fixes‚Äîfancy electric toothbrushes, special toothpastes, mouthwashes that burned my mouth, flossing religiously. You name it. Nothing seemed to work long-term.



That‚Äôs when I stumbled upon ProDentim.



And I have to say: ProDentim didn‚Äôt just improve my oral health‚Äîit completely transformed it.

If you‚Äôve been struggling like I was, please keep reading. Because I‚Äôm going to share my full experience, why I think this product is so different, and why it‚Äôs something I wish I had found years earlier.



The Struggle: A Silent Confidence Killer

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîyour mouth is one of the first things people notice about you. Whether you‚Äôre speaking, smiling, or laughing, your oral health is always on display.



For years, I had issues with:



Bleeding gums during brushing



Occasional bad breath (even with mints)



Tooth sensitivity to cold and hot



A constant dry or ‚Äúcoated‚Äù feeling on my tongue



And an overall lack of confidence in how my mouth felt



And the most frustrating part? I was doing everything right‚Äîbrushing twice a day, flossing, using mouthwash. Still, something felt off. And dental visits? They were always followed by guilt trips and expensive cleanings that left me feeling worse.



The Discovery: A Different Kind of Oral Health Solution

I first heard about ProDentim through a health podcast. They were discussing the surprising fact that dental problems aren't always caused by ""bad brushing""‚Äîbut by an imbalance in the good and bad bacteria in our mouths.



That caught my attention. I knew about gut health and probiotics, but it never occurred to me that our mouths have a microbiome too.



The speaker explained how traditional products‚Äîespecially alcohol-based mouthwashes and chemical-laden toothpaste‚Äîcan actually kill the good bacteria in your mouth, leaving the bad ones to dominate. This imbalance causes bad breath, plaque buildup, bleeding gums, and other problems.



Enter ProDentim‚Äîa probiotic supplement specifically designed for oral health.



Instead of scrubbing and killing everything, ProDentim works by repopulating your mouth with healthy bacteria, supporting gums, teeth, and breath from the inside out.



That made so much sense to me.



I ordered a 3-bottle bundle right away.



What Happened After I Started Taking ProDentim

Each ProDentim tablet is a soft chewable that tastes like peppermint. You take one daily, ideally in the morning after brushing. It takes about 30 seconds to dissolve, and then you just go about your day.



I noticed changes faster than I expected.



Week 1: A Noticeable Freshness

After just a few days, my mouth started feeling cleaner‚Äînot from the burning of mouthwash, but a natural, lasting kind of freshness. My tongue felt cleaner, and I didn't wake up with that ‚Äúmorning breath‚Äù I used to dread.



Even after coffee and lunch, I noticed my breath stayed fresher longer. This was a small thing, but it gave me a huge boost in confidence during meetings.



Week 2: Gum Sensitivity Improving

By the second week, something amazing happened‚ÄîI brushed my teeth and there was no bleeding. None. I had gotten so used to that bit of pink in the sink that I assumed it was normal. But with ProDentim, it just‚Ä¶ stopped.



My gums looked pinker and healthier, and my sensitivity to hot and cold foods started to fade. I even bit into an ice cream cone without wincing!



Week 4: The Full Transformation

After a month, I was hooked.



My gums were no longer swollen or tender



My breath stayed fresh all day, even without gum or mints



My teeth felt smoother and looked whiter (even though this isn‚Äôt technically a whitening product)



I had zero pain or discomfort when eating or drinking



And most importantly‚ÄîI smiled with full confidence again



It‚Äôs hard to explain how powerful that is. I felt more confident, more attractive, and more free than I had in years. All from a tiny chewable tablet.



Why ProDentim Works (What‚Äôs Inside Matters)

The reason ProDentim works so well is because of its carefully chosen natural ingredients and probiotic strains. Here are a few that stood out to me:



Lactobacillus Paracasei: Supports gum health and reduces inflammation



Lactobacillus Reuteri: Helps with bad breath and balances oral flora



BLIS M-18 and BLIS K-12: Two powerful strains that protect teeth and freshen breath



Inulin: A prebiotic that feeds the good bacteria and supports balance



Peppermint and Malic Acid: Natural ingredients that support a clean, fresh mouth feel



Everything is clinically backed, non-GMO, and made in an FDA-approved facility. That gave me a lot of peace of mind, especially since I was putting this into my body daily.



A Few Tips for Best Results

If you're planning to try ProDentim (and you absolutely should), here are a few things I recommend:



Be consistent. Take one tablet every morning. It‚Äôs easy and becomes second nature.



Let it dissolve slowly. Don‚Äôt chew and swallow too fast‚Äîlet it work its magic in your mouth.



Give it time. I saw changes in the first week, but the real magic happened around weeks 3‚Äì4.



Also, pair it with a gentle, fluoride-free toothpaste if possible. I noticed better results when I stopped using harsh chemical-based pastes.



Final Thoughts: This is the Oral Health Secret No One Tells You About

I never imagined I‚Äôd find something that would fix so many issues‚Äîbad breath, bleeding gums, sensitivity, and confidence‚Äîall in one product.



But ProDentim did that for me.



And what‚Äôs wild is: it‚Äôs not a pill, not a paste, not a rinse. It‚Äôs a natural probiotic formula that simply restores balance to your mouth‚Äîsomething that years of brushing and flossing couldn‚Äôt do.



If you‚Äôve been suffering silently with oral discomfort, if you avoid smiling fully, or if you‚Äôre tired of gum pain, embarrassing breath, or expensive dental visits‚Äîthis is your answer.



It‚Äôs affordable, easy to use, and best of all‚Äîit actually works.



Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)

Verdict: An absolute game-changer. I‚Äôll never go a day without it again.

Hai guys. So a little bit ago (idk how Long ago) I had some sort of what I'd call an ego death? Idrk who I am anymore. But yet I still possess all the memories and neural pathways of previous me. I feel like I've only been alive for a week and I don't know who I am. It's all so confusing. Idk what I like, I have friends and when I hang with them it feels that idk them. The previous me really liked things like coffee or gaming but idk if i like those. I'm not sure how to make sense of it to other people though. It feels like my mind is split? I've just been labeling all of it me as of now, and previous me. 
I became emotionally reliant on one of my online friends. It kind of sucks and I don't want to do that to him. So I've been taking some time away from him while i rebalance myself. Ugh but it just hurts so much. I didn't think not talking to him would cause me so much mental and physical anguish. I constantly think about him, I have conversations in my head with him. Idk anytime I want to say something to anyone it's always him. He might have my reddit though, I hope he doesn't see this lol

But anyways I was feeling very depressed/suicidal. I was unable to eat or sleep. I went days without much of each. But i decided to start working on myself! I've been going on walks, talking to friends about how I feel. (I've even been talking to chatgpt about it lol) but I'm doing a lot better now. I've been eating and sleeping again, I'm less suicidal and everything seems a little brighter. I've still got a long path to healing ahead of me, I'm just taking small victories at a time. I think I'm going to get a haircut and change the way I dress soon though. Once I figure out who I am, what I like and what makes me happy. I think it'll all be alright

# Before Waterloo

I was one of those kids who used to watch adam wong and joma tech on youtube hoping to get into Waterloo CS. I was a try hard and put my best efforts to get 95+ and get in. I was so confident I didn‚Äôt apply to many other programs and schools. I didn‚Äôt get in. womp womp. I was so upset. It didn‚Äôt make sense to me that people who didn‚Äôt even have experience coding got in over me what the fudge. I didn‚Äôt know how to process this so I sought people with similar expereince as me on ummm reddit. I decided that the next best thing was getting into UW Math then transferring into CS. I still had confidence that I could do it. I asked people how hard it was to switch and they warned me but I didn‚Äôt take it seriously.

This was how I began to develop a really toxic and narrow mindset.

I remember feeling very inferior to the CS students. I was worried I would be called a CS reject lol.

**What I wish I did:**

* Apply to more programs like software eng, computer eng, architecture, biomed eng, health sci, pharmacy etc.
* Apply to colleges in the US and take the SAT (not to discourage you but you begin to realize just how intense the competition really is)
* Put a lot of time and thought into your applications. Looking back, mine were way too straightforward and boring. Dig deeper into why you genuinely want to pursue something, what you are hoping to get out of it and how you see this school helping you grow. Answer it at your level of expertise, you don‚Äôt need to sound like someone who has it all figured out and write some complex explanation. Don‚Äôt be generic. Tell a story. Maybe write about a conversation/ a project/ a startup or something that inspired you. Don‚Äôt try to emulate others. It is best to be honest, personal, and show who you are, not who you think they want you to be

# First Year

During Covid, very few classes were held in person except for math classes. I decided to stay on campus because I couldn‚Äôt wait to leave my house and experience a romanticized college life hanging out with a multicultural friend group lol.

It wasn't exactly what I had imagined but I had a really good time. I grew close to all my floor mates and enjoyed having a large dorm room all to myself, thanks to Covid. I had delicious food, played ping pong at CMH, and went on late-night walks in Waterloo Park with friends.

Academically, I struggled a bit. I lacked a solid foundation for doing proofs and integrals because my last semester of high school was online and I didn‚Äôt learn well. I often spent long hours on a single assignment and remember submitting them at 11:59 PM then going out at midnight to finally eat. It was tough and I didn't know how to study for these courses. The classrooms were large, filled with many students and I felt intimidated to ask questions. The content moved quickly and I felt so lost. At one point, I started skipping classes because I didn‚Äôt understand what the professor was saying. I thought I could learn the material better on my own. It was so easy to skip since there was no attendance anymore. I began to rely on calculators which led to building poor foundations.

Midterms came around, I got grades in the 50s/60s for the first time. I was incredibly disappointed and quickly recalculated how much I would need to score to achieve 90+ in the course (something I would do every exam season throughout my entire undergraduate experience). I remember a professor telling us to watch ""Inside Out"" to cope lmaoo (a core memory fr).

I was relieved to find out I wasn't alone and found many reddit posts that convinced me that grades don‚Äôt matter. I began to believe in two conflicting ideas simultaneously: ‚ÄúI am still smart and can somehow get 90+‚Äù and ‚Äúgrades don‚Äôt really matter anyway it‚Äôll be fine if I just get a job at a FANG company‚Äù.

In 1B, I found a group of friends to study with, which significantly improved my commitment to studying. We met almost every day of the week and I would review everything before our study sessions so I could be helpful. Realizing that I wasn't alone in feeling lost was so helpful and I ended up getting pretty good grades that term!

I also started applying for internships that term. I actually didn‚Äôt apply for any jobs in the first round because I felt my resume wasn‚Äôt good enough. I wanted to improve it, do 5+ projects, create a website, do 100 leetcode questions all at once before applying lmaoo. I also avoided mock interviews because I didn‚Äôt want to seem dumb. I was a crippling perfectionist.

Eventually, I did get a job and I was over the moon. It wasn‚Äôt a fancy position, it was a QA job but it was my first time working and getting payed! Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt learn much during my first internship. They essentially paid me to do nothing, and working remotely meant I just slept through meetings and worked from bed. Life was great, but I became quite lazy.

**What I wish I did:**

* Go to all my classes                                                                                                                                           The habits you create in first year will stick with you for a long time. Show up to classes regularly and get there on time/early even if you find the professor boring. Try to stick around a bit longer before deciding that you are better off learning on your own (sometimes it is but not in first year boo)
* Talk to people in my classes                                                                                                                                Make an effort to talk to people in your classes. Even if you feel like the dumbest person in class and don‚Äôt want to be asked if you started on an assignment/asked a question you don‚Äôt know the answer to. If they don‚Äôt talk to you cuz you dont have the answers, thats just some odd behavior not on you. It might feel awkward at first, but most people are open to chatting, you just have to take the first step.   Not everyone you talk to will become your best friend and that‚Äôs totally fine. Having people you can ask quick questions or vent to during stressful weeks makes life bearable. These little connections go a long way. If you end up in the same classes again in upper years, it‚Äôs so much easier to reconnect, form group chats, or work together.
* Talk to the professors and go go go go to office hours I beg of you                                                                Even if you think your questions are dumb or even if you don‚Äôt have a super specific question, just go. Even if your question is from content six weeks ago and you feel lowkey embarrassed to bring it up, still go and ask. Don‚Äôt wait until exams to try and clear all your doubts at once. It‚Äôs never too late to catch up, and profs won‚Äôt judge you(they have seen it all). You can ask them to re-explain a topic that went over your head or walk through an example again more slowly. Profs are usually way more chill and helpful one-on-one than they seem in lectures. You will hear what other students are asking too which might even clear up your own confusion.                                                                                                  The more you go, the easier it gets. It also helps your prof remember you, which means they can better tailor their explanations and understand how to actually help you. Also ask them about what made them get into this field, what kind of research they do in simple terms or how what you are learning is used in the real world! Sometimes you will end up having the same prof for future courses so building that connection makes it way easier to ask for reference letters! Don‚Äôt wait until 4th year to start talking to profs and asking reference letters!
* Do the practice questions                                                                                                                                           I used to think that because there was so much content, I was good to go if I just understood the concepts and did the examples we covered in class. But that‚Äôs where I messed up. One thing that frustrates me about profs is that they don‚Äôt show you how to actually apply the concepts they will teach the theory then throw completely unfamiliar-looking questions at you on the exam. They will be worded differently, structured differently‚Ä¶ it lowkey feels like they want to fail you.                                               Do the practice questions and be smart about it. Try them as early as possible so you have time to get help. Don‚Äôt waste your whole day banging your head against one question you don‚Äôt understand. Give each question 30 to 40 minutes max and if it‚Äôs not clicking, move on and bring it to office hours.                    First year math courses feels like learning a new language and a new way of thinking. Some assignments were so hard and I had no idea how to solve it w/out divine intervension. You will feel dumb when solutions don‚Äôt come to you intuitively but that‚Äôs normal. That intuition gets built over time by seeing similar questions again and again throughout your undergrad. So don‚Äôt stress if it‚Äôs not natural right away, it will come.
* Grades do matter                                                                                                                                             Don‚Äôt let reddit posts or random people online convince you otherwise. Right now, you might think you will never want to do research, work in quantitative finance, or get a master‚Äôs degree/PhD. But trust me, you will change your mind. And when you do, you will wish you had kept your options open. Don‚Äôt let bad grades take opportunities away from you.                                                                                   Don‚Äôt take these courses lightly, they are hard and demand way more time and energy than anything you did in high school. So put your ego and delusion aside and start practicing how to work hard now. Working hard beats talent. You can‚Äôt get good grades just relying on your ‚Äútalent.‚Äù You have to put in real effort, be consistent, face failures, be willing to accept that you‚Äôre not a genius, and still commit to improving your study skills.                                                                                                                                      At the end of the day, for me, it‚Äôs honestly not even about the grades. Yeah, grades are satisfying and they give you that quick moment of validation. But that feeling fades so fast because, you‚Äôve got to move on to the next course, the next exam and now you have to maintain that grade. Ugh. It never really ends. The real reward is the confidence you build from knowing that even when things got hard, when you were overwhelmed, behind, or questioning if you could even do it, you didn‚Äôt give up. You showed up, you tried and you pushed through. That kind of strength doesn‚Äôt show up on a transcript, but it shapes who you are. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve come to respect the most.                                                          One thing a prof once told me that really helped me in first year was that ‚ÄúThere is nothing in this course content that you can‚Äôt do.‚Äù These concepts aren‚Äôt some wildly complex, unsolved problems, they are foundational ideas. And with enough diligent studying and practice you can get it!                                  If you are really on the grades grind:
   * Try reading the lecture notes *before* class it helps you stay engaged. If you can do this consistenly, you are a star THE main character and goat of ur life
   * Stop taking aesthetic or overly detailed notes in class. You end up so busy writing everything down that you‚Äôre not actually listening to what the prof is saying. Instead, take simple notes and focus on jotting down your questions and points of confusion.
   * Fight the urge to finish one assignment completely before starting another especially when you‚Äôve got 4-5 things due in the same week. Spend short amounts of time each day on each task. Switching between tasks is actually good for your brain.
   * If you‚Äôre falling behind, don‚Äôt set the goal of getting 100% in every course from here on out. It is not realistic and it‚Äôll just make you spiral. Prioritize the core courses you need for over random electives. Don‚Äôt spend 5 hours working on a discussion post, then end up half-studying for a math quiz at 3 AM. Prioritize based on importance, even if your brain wants to do the easy or fun thing first.
   * Prioritize based on how much each assignment or quiz is worth. At the beginning of the term, when you look at the course outline, make a mental note, a physical note, a screenshot whatever it takes to remind yourself what each task is worth. This way, you can plan ahead and assign your time accordingly for heavier-weighted tasks.
   * Double-check submission times. There have been a couple times I missed a deadline because I thought it was due at 11:59 PM but it was actually due at 12 PM. Argggh. Don‚Äôt be me. Set calendar reminders. Alarms. Tattoo it on your brain.
   * I used Trello to make a Kanban board with all the tasks I needed to get done each term. It was super satisfying to drag things into Submitted
   * Start studying for exams at least 2‚Äì3 weeks in advance. Don‚Äôt leave it all for the night before.
   * Practice doing questions **FASTT. E**xams are long and your test-taking speed matters a lot.
   * My go-to exam prep method: break the course notes into small chunks you can read in 25‚Äì30 minutes. Read a chunk, try to process it *without* taking notes first. Then, from memory, consolidate that info into your own notes. After that, do examples on your own. Finally, go back and check what you missed or misunderstood and fill in the gaps.
* Stop using AI for everything                                                                                                                                        It is a disservice to yourself. Use it to guide your thinking and help you learn concepts, but don‚Äôt use it to shortcut the actual work. If you avoid learning now, you will just keep putting it off and eventually you will be embarrassed to admit you don‚Äôt know something basic. Then you will have to learn it alongside way harder concepts later. That‚Äôs how you end up stunting your own growth.
* Take care of your health                                                                                                                                      Please get 8 hours of sleep before every exam, puh-lease. Your brain will absolutely betray you if you don‚Äôt sleep.                                                                                                                                                        Exercise at least 3‚Äì4 times a week, even just for an hour. But don‚Äôt spend 3 hours at the gym avoiding your work either. I used to do that and it just made me sore and sleepy during class. On the otherside, becoming a total couch potato can tank your energy and confidence, especially when you‚Äôre already feeling like an imposter academically.                                                                                                                            I used to feel sleepy all the time in classes, these are a few tips that helped:
   * Sleep
   * Wear light clothes under jackets
   * Avoid long commutes if you can
   * Don‚Äôt work out in the morning
   * Don‚Äôt eat heavy meals before class
   * Eat oranges or anything citrusy
   * Pre-read lecture notes, it helps you follow along instead of zoning out
   * Drink iced water
* Try not to get sick during exams or even during the term.                                                                                       But if you do get sick, don‚Äôt try to push through it. Get a doctor‚Äôs note and submit a VIF form. If it‚Äôs during exams, don‚Äôt try to tough it out and write while your brain is foggy. Exams are usually worth 50‚Äì60% of your final grade and failing just because you didn‚Äôt want to postpone is not worth it. Don‚Äôt be overconfident and get help. A VIF form can let you write the exam next term instead if your grades before the exam are satisfactory.                                                                                                                               Don‚Äôt use your one short-term absence per term too early in the term unless absolutenly necessary. You are way more likely to need it later toward the end of the term when everything piles up.                                If you are struggling with mental health, document it. Talk to a doctor and apply for accommodations through Waterloo Accessibility Services. You deserve support. Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself when you‚Äôre physically or mentally unwell.
* Make friends outisde your program and join clubs                                                                                                      Talk to new people! put yourself out there! join clubs! It will help you find your people and that really comes in clutch when you‚Äôre looking for roommates in second year and beyond. You don‚Äôt want to end up living with randoms who bring chaos and problems into your life.                                                                       I personally recommend Badminton Club, UW Volleyball, UW Muay Thai, UW Hip Hop, UW Ceramics Club. I always wanted to join clubs like UW Tech, UWCS, but I was a lil too shy and felt like I‚Äôd be judged, which is really not the case. I also highly recommend Socratica and finding mentor(s) through UW Tech+. Clubs like UWCS, UWPM, and UWDSc can be super valuable if you get involved in thier teams. Otherwise, it might feel a bit disconnected or hard to break into.
* Applying to Jobs                                                                                                                                                      Don't solely rely on WaterlooWorks. Apply for jobs outside as well. This will help you build confidence to apply for some cooler jobs which are not always on WaterlooWorks. Don‚Äôt limit youself to what you find on WaterlooWorks.                                                                                                                                 Students share internship openings along with direct application links and status updates (open, closed, etc.): [https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships)Don‚Äôt expect yourself to master everything. Most employers understand that you‚Äôre a beginner and that‚Äôs okay! Don‚Äôt be intimidated by job descriptions, they list a zillion tools but typically only use one or two on a daily basis. Apply to any positions you think you are even remotely qualified.                     Resource: [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/)Lays out skills for different tech roles. It breaks down what to learn, in what order, and which tools are most relevant today. Great for figuring out what to focus on when you're feeling lost or overwhelmed by how much there is to learn.                                                                        When creating personal projects, don‚Äôt stop at the mockup or give up the moment you hit your first obstacle. Set a deadline, commit to seeing it through, and reward yourself well when you finish. Your project doesn‚Äôt have to be the next TikTok. It can literally just be a calculator. People love to say that‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy,‚Äù but most never sit down and actually build one from scratch. If it‚Äôs your first time doing a project, keep it simple and doable. Once you finish it, you‚Äôll feel so much more confident. And then for your next project you can build on what you learned and challenge yourself a bit more. But if you have the time, go wild. Build something crazy. It‚Äôs way more fun when you do it with friends, and you will learn so much faster bouncing ideas off each other.                                                                                                Research the company you interview for and prepare any questions you may have, even if they are not directly related to your role. Show them that you are genuinely interested in becoming involved.               Don‚Äôt try to pull a story out of thin air when they ask you questions like ‚Äúdescribe a time when you faced a challenge and how you overcame it‚Äù. Think it through and write down a few stories that you can discuss confidently beforehand.                                                                                                                        Don‚Äôt be discouraged by LeetCode. It is verrrryyyy challenging and as a beginner, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to achieve the most efficient solutions right away. Ik its hard to keep doing it. Its so traumatizing but keep practicing! You will develop better intuition for these types of questions over time. Do it with friends if you find it daunting. Don‚Äôt put pressure on yourself to solve 100‚Äì200 LeetCode questions just to feel ‚Äúready.‚Äù Yes, that kind of grind helps but you don‚Äôt need all that if you haven‚Äôt even solved one yet. Start small, be patient with yourself, and celebrate every question you do manage to solve. It all adds up.                                                                                                                                                                   Don‚Äôt be afraid of interviewers, they are just people. Treat the interview as a two-way conversation and a level playing field. Interviewing can be tough and stressful, but the more you practice, the better you'll become.                                                                                                                                                                  I like to research my interviewers on LinkedIn and read any interesting posts they've shared. This allows me to ask thoughtful questions instead of just the typical ones like, ""What does a day in this role look like?"" or ""What does success in this position look like?"" These questions are tired. Never let them know your next question lol.                                                                                                                     While I focused on software and data roles, remember that there are many other options available, such as project management, quality assurance, and DevOps roles. Don‚Äôt limit yourself!
* Your First Co-op / Internship: What to Expect                                                                                                                I was always so nervous on the first day. I deadass believed I‚Äôd be hit with a surprise technical interview if I fail, they would fire me. Nope. Your first day is usually just an orientation: signing forms, reading onboarding docs and introducing yourself to a bunch of people. Don‚Äôt be shy. Skip the default ‚ÄúHi, my name is \_\_\_, I go to \_\_\_, I‚Äôll be working as \_\_\_, and I‚Äôm excited to be here‚Äù script. Say something that makes you a bit more memorable. But it‚Äôs up to you. You don‚Äôt have to force it if it doesn‚Äôt feel natural. I found that when I was too shy, people didn‚Äôt really message me or trust me with work I wanted to do. I had to push myself to be a little more outgoing.                                                                                              Some tips to make the most of it:
   * Talk to your coworkers                                                                                                                                    Say hi, be curious, request coffee chats with everyone. Ask what they studied, how they got into their role, or what they find interesting about their work, what they wished they learned in school, what certification they did etc. or what their favorite food is or if they invest in stocks/efts, literally anything.
   * Keep a daily log/diary of what you work on.                                                                                                   This will be so useful when writing your resume and preparing for future interviews
   * Ask for more work if you finish tasks early and show initiative.                                                                          This is yourrrr time to gain skills. Whether it‚Äôs communication, presenting, documentation, or just learning how to work on a team, everything counts. Don‚Äôt just coast through it. Work hard even during co-op. What you learn here will directly help you land your next one!
   * If you don‚Äôt fully understand a task, don‚Äôt guess or pretend you do. Ask questions right away. Don‚Äôt try to figure everything out on your own and end up taking way longer on something that could‚Äôve been solved quickly with a bit of clarification.
   * Communicate your progress honestly and regularly. It‚Äôs totally okay to say, ‚ÄúHey, I got stuck here‚Äù instead of feeling guilty or embarrassed. Most people would rather know where you are at than be surprised later.
   * Ask for honest feedback often. Don‚Äôt wait till your manager tells you what you should‚Äôve done better at the end of your internship.
* Save all your notes, assignments, quizzes for every single course in cloud storage or on a USB

That was a lot. But here are some overall thoughts about first year:

Don‚Äôt take this opportunity to study for granted! You have everything you need to succeed in life, whatever that means to you. It‚Äôs okay to fail. Life happens. But please don‚Äôt just give up on your grades or classes. Learn how to build yourself back up when things feel messy and hopeless.

You‚Äôre not supposed to have it all figured out. Don‚Äôt expect perfection from yourself, that‚Äôs too harsh and just not fair. You will learn better through your mistakes, so don‚Äôt beat yourself up over them. Didn‚Äôt get 80%+ on a practice test? Took you 5 hours to solve *one* question? That‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs normal. You‚Äôll learn way more by reviewing your mistakes. Your brain will make stronger connections the more it struggles and bounces back.

Good friends will make your experience 10x better. Take initiative to start group chats, plan study sessions or just hang out. Don‚Äôt isolate yourself. 

Don‚Äôt delay learning. If you avoid it now, you‚Äôre just going to have to learn it tomorrow, on top of tomorrow‚Äôs work.

Don‚Äôt give up! You‚Äôre a smart little bean and you can do anything you put your mind and heart into. Pat yourself on the back, listen to ‚ÄúGo Baby‚Äù by Cleo Sol, and take a deep breath, you are gonna be okay.

# Second Year

I moved into a room with five roommates and had to cook for myself! I made some delicious meals, but I mostly ate out, lol. My room was really pretty and I had one amazing roommate. Classes reopened, and I finally started attending UW clubs and meeting more people! I made some incredible friends! I could drink then and started going to parties and clubs! It was my most fun year at university.

But my grades went down the drain. I always feel like I was less focused in the fall because there were so many people and activities happening.

I was delusional. I kept thinking I could just catch up later if I missed a class or two. That became ‚ÄúOh this assignment‚Äôs only worth 5%? I‚Äôll just grind for the midterm.‚Äù Then the midterms came... and I was cooked. I didn‚Äôt have time to cover everything. I dropped courses thinking ‚Äúgrades don‚Äôt matter as long as I get a good job, right? wrong.

Embarassingly, I was on hinge for the first time in second year and this is a sick place. I wanted a relationship so badddd. Everyone was in love and I wasn‚Äôt. Its not worth all the time u will waste talking to guys who will only text u back at night. Most of them will leave u wondering if u are worthy of love. Yes, u are and pls get off that app asap and promise me u will never download it again. Also if a guy is into asian abgs and u r not one pls don‚Äôt wonder whats wrong w u if he doesn‚Äôt like u. Its not u queeen, they just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs outside thier little bubble.

Second year was a roller coster ride.

**What I wish I did:**

* Don‚Äôt drop courses you need to graduate. Drop an elective instead.
* If you drop 3/5 courses, you‚Äôre considered a part-time student, not full-time. OSAP will penalize you for that and put you on probation for a whole year.
* STAT230 and STAT231 are suuuper important and super hard. Make them your top priority and put your best efforts.
   * You need 60%+ in both to be allowed into any 300-level STAT courses. So don‚Äôt just aim to pass or you‚Äôll end up having to retake them.
* Attend hackathons and competitions
   * Lowkey seemed like a menace to me back then cuz why would I waste a weekend trying to make some thing work and its just a mockup. But honestly, they‚Äôre such a good way to meet people, gain exposure, and make connections. It‚Äôs a fun, chaotic undergrad experience you‚Äôll be glad you had.
* Study Exchanges                                                                                                                                                          I heard it‚Äôs super chill and sooo fun. One of my biggest regrets is not having the grades to apply for an exchange. Please use this as your motivation!!! Just imagineee the life -meeting new people, eating amazing food, exploring a new country! You need a 75% CAV and 70% MAV to apply. Plan accordingly! Most students apply in second year to go abroad in third year.

# Third Year/Fourth Year

Everything was completely in-person now. I had weekly quizzes and in-person midterms, and I was not ready. I still hadn‚Äôt fixed my class attendance and was skipping some assignments. My grades dropped again. I remember not being able to sleep during exams. My eyes would burn when I tried to close them for five straight days because I was cramming for my courses right before the exams. I bombed the exams and failed two courses. I was genuinely tweaking thinking that I would have to drop out and I wish I had felt this scared before failing or dropping courses. There was nothing left to do except try. I had no choice, so I started putting in a lot of effort the next term. I attended all my classes, built up the courage to ask questions, went to office hours and improved my studying skills. It kind of worked. I didn‚Äôt fail anymore! But I still wasn‚Äôt getting above 80s. The exams always got to me. I‚Äôm a slow thinker and writer and I didn‚Äôt practice improving my exam taking speed and skills.

I left behind everything I loved doing just to focus on improving my grades. I did improve, but not in the miraculous way I had hoped. I didn‚Äôt have trouble getting co-op positions, but I wasn't getting the FAANG jobs I wanted.

Eventually to cope, I started binging on TV shows and food to fill a void. I told myself I was ‚Äústudying,‚Äù but honestly, I was in survival mode. I wasn‚Äôt studying because I wanted to. I felt I had to. I thought I needed to be perfect to redeem myself. That narrow mindset, believing I had to outdo the CS students, achieve perfect grades, and land a prestigious FAANG job, was suffocating me.

Now, I just wish I could do it all over again. I wish I had understood earlier how valuable this opportunity was. I wish I learned how to genuinely enjoy the process of learning. I still catch myself thinking, ‚ÄúIf I just get a FAANG job or get into a fancy grad school maybe I‚Äôll finally feel like I‚Äôm good enough.‚Äù But I think I lost the plot.

**What I wish I did:**

* Try **CO, ACTSCI, AFM** courses instead of just STAT/CS courses
* Save and use co-op earnings wisely                                                                                                                               I regret mostly spending all my co-op earnings on food and clothes. Please, save your money. Start an emergency fund and begin planning for travel every year! You don‚Äôt have to wait until after you graduate to travel. Learn about investing your money. I'm not suggesting you need to engage in risky investments (unless that's what you want to do), but I do wish I had learned about investing earlier.

**Courses I suggest:**

* **SCI206**

It wasn‚Äôt particularly difficult but it was very time-consuming. It can be enjoyable if you like proofs and integrating/derivations.

It‚Äôs best to take it in a lighter term as you will need to invest significant amount of time into this class.

I hope to find something more fulfilling than grades and FAANG jobs. In my final term, I want to stop sacrificing fun for the sake of studying. I want to find a balance and enjoy life a bit more. My goal is to build a lifestyle I won‚Äôt want to escape from. If you have any tips for achieving this, please share them!

[[Explore Top Rated anker soundcore earbuds on Amazon.]](https://itsallgarden.com/tablet-accessories/?kw=anker soundcore earbuds)

## Key Features Analysis

The Anker Soundcore series boasts a range of models, each with unique strengths and characteristics. Understanding the core features will help you identify the earbuds that best align with your individual needs and preferences.**Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)**

Many Anker Soundcore earbuds now incorporate active noise cancellation technology. This feature uses microphones to detect ambient noise and electronically counteract it, creating a more immersive and distraction-free listening experience. The effectiveness of ANC varies between models, with premium options offering wider frequency range cancellation and the ability to adapt to different environments. Whether you're commuting on a noisy train or working in a busy office, ANC can significantly improve your focus and enjoyment of your audio.

**Sound Quality and Tuning**

Sound quality is paramount when choosing earbuds.Anker Soundcore generally delivers a balanced sound signature, though specific models may emphasize certain frequencies. Some may feature more bass-heavy profiles, while others offer a flatter response for more accurate sound reproduction. Many Soundcore earbuds also include custom EQ settings within the Soundcore app, allowing you to fine-tune the sound to your liking.

**Battery Life and Charging**

Battery life is a crucial consideration for on-the-go listeners. Anker Soundcore earbuds typically offer competitive battery performance, with many models providing 7-10 hours of listening time on a single charge.

Higher IPX ratings indicate greater protection against submersion, making them suitable for workouts and outdoor activities.

Comfort is essential for extended listening sessions. Anker Soundcore earbuds often come with multiple sizes of ear tips to ensure a secure and agreeable fit for a wide range of ear shapes. Some models also feature ergonomic designs that conform to the contours of the ear, further enhancing comfort.

1kdyg86,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kdyg86/should_you_consider_the_delonghi_dinamica_plus/,Should you consider the De'Longhi Dinamica Plus espresso machine? A review awaits!,"The De'Longhi ECAM38085SB Dinamica Plus Espresso & Coffee Machine truly adds an upscale caf√© experience to your home. Immediately upon unboxing, its sleek silver design and compact dimensions of 16.9""D x 9.3""W x 13.7""H stood out, making it a kitchen centerpiece. The machine is user-friendly, thanks to the inclusion of a vibrant 3.5‚Äù full-touch TFT color display with soft-touch buttons, making navigation a breeze. With its minimalist yet modern aesthetic, this espresso machine seamlessly fits into most kitchen setups.  

The automated functionality catches your attention early on. The Dinamica Plus boasts a built-in conical burr grinder with 13 adjustable settings, allowing the grind to adapt easily to the type of coffee beans you prefer. Testing it with medium-dark roast whole beans, the freshness and flavor infusion were impressive. Not to mention, the machine remembers your preferred beverages through its Smart One-Touch system, which prioritizes frequently chosen drinks at the forefront of its menu. This level of intuition had me genuinely impressed with how well it ""learns"" your habits.  

**Advantages**  
- The Smart One-Touch feature adds convenience for regular users.  
- Customization for multiple user profiles enhances personalization.  
- Simple setup with efficient cleaning capabilities.  

[Find the best price for De'Longhi ECAM38085SB on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dqfngwwf/)  

Another notable feature is the proprietary LatteCrema Hot System. I tried frothed oat milk for an iced cappuccino and was amazed by the creamy texture. It works equally well with regular dairy and plant substitutes like almond or soy milk. You can opt between light, creamy, or dense foam settings for the perfect finish to any latte or cappuccino. My dad, a cappuccino aficionado, couldn‚Äôt stop raving about the silky consistency it achieved with almond milk, proving its versatility.  

On the practical side, there are four user profiles available, making it perfect for families or shared households. Each user can save their preferences, eliminating repetitive adjustments. Despite this benefit, I did find navigating the profiles occasionally cumbersome, especially when guests wanted a quick coffee and weren‚Äôt added as a profile.  

Cleaning and maintenance come in as mixed positives and negatives. Dishwasher-safe components like the removable water spout and milk carafe are convenient, but the overall cleaning process isn't entirely hands-free. While the self-cleaning mode works effectively, areas like the grinder and frother do require occasional manual attention to avoid build-up.  

**Critiques**  
- Manual cleaning needed despite having self-cleaning features.  
- Switching between user profiles might feel slightly awkward for beginners.  

Performance-wise, this machine delivers in quality and consistency. Americano, macchiato, and even iced coffee are some of the stellar offerings. Experimenting with the 24 one-touch recipes was a journey of indulgence. There‚Äôs a slight learning curve to balance the grind size and brewing strength, but once you have your settings dialed in, the flavor spectrum this machine delivers is unmatched. The robustity of an espresso shot paired with the tactful creaminess of a flat white gave me the kind of satisfaction matching anything a premium caf√© could offer.  

Considering competitors in the super-automatic espresso machine market, the Dinamica Plus holds its ground well. Compared to models like the Jura E6, De'Longhi offers more drink recipes and a lower footprint. Brands like Breville may match in terms of espresso quality, but they lack similar automation features. On the downside, Breville models tend to offer better durability in the grinder department. Yet, the Dinamica Plus shines for those prioritizing diversity and ease over manual tweaking.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
When evaluating the price-performance ratio, this espresso machine justifies its place in the higher-end tier for home-brewing systems. While initial costs lean towards premium, its robust feature set, including the intuitive Smart One-Touch system, adjustable froth settings, and customizable profiles, ensures value for families or espresso lovers. It‚Äôs handy for someone transitioning from semi-manual setups to automated coffee magic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding Adaptogenic Herbs and Their Role in Stress Relief

Adaptogenic herbs are natural substances that help the body resist stressors of all kinds, whether physical, chemical, or biological. These herbs work by supporting the adrenal glands‚Äîthe small organs responsible for producing stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. By regulating hormone production and balancing the body's response to stress, adaptogens can improve resilience and promote a stable mood.

Unlike stimulants or sedatives, adaptogenic herbs do not cause extreme shifts in energy or mood. Instead, they gently bring the body back to a state of equilibrium. This balancing effect makes them ideal for everyday stress management, as they support mental clarity and physical endurance without causing dependency or tolerance.

### Popular Adaptogenic Herbs and Their Benefits

Several well-researched adaptogens are commonly used to improve stress management. Each offers unique benefits, allowing you to choose based on your specific needs.

- **Ashwagandha:** Often praised for its calming effects, ashwagandha helps reduce cortisol levels and ease anxiety symptoms. It supports better sleep quality, which is essential for mental balance.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** Known to enhance stamina and reduce fatigue, rhodiola can boost mental performance during stressful times. It also improves mood by influencing serotonin and dopamine pathways.
- **Holy Basil (Tulsi):** This herb acts as a natural mood stabilizer and promotes relaxation. It‚Äôs also rich in antioxidants, helping protect your body from the harmful impact of stress.
- **Schisandra Chinensis:** Used traditionally in Chinese medicine, schisandra supports mental focus and combats stress-induced exhaustion.
- **Eleuthero (Siberian Ginseng):** It enhances physical endurance and sharpens mental alertness, making it easier to manage daily stress challenges.

### How Adaptogens Work to Improve Mental Balance

Adaptogens influence key body systems to maintain homeostasis, the stable condition necessary for optimal health. They act primarily on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the system responsible for stress responses. When stress occurs, the HPA axis triggers hormone release to cope with danger or pressure. However, chronic stress can overstimulate this system, leading to fatigue, anxiety, and depression.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
By modulating the HPA axis, adaptogens help normalize cortisol levels, which reduces the negative effects of prolonged stress. They also promote neurotransmitter balance in the brain. Neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) play crucial roles in mood regulation and anxiety control. Adaptogens support the production and release of these chemicals, fostering a calm and stable mindset.

### Simple Tips for Adaptogens into Your Routine

Adding adaptogenic herbs to your daily life doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. Here are practical tips to help you get started:

- **Choose the Right Form:** Adaptogens are available as powders, capsules, teas, and tinctures. Capsules are convenient for on-the-go use, while teas can be a soothing way to unwind in the evening.
- **Start with Small Doses:** Begin with a low dose to see how your body reacts. Gradually increase if needed, but avoid taking too much at once to prevent any unwanted side effects.
- **Consistency is Key:** Adaptive effects build over time. Take your chosen herb daily for several weeks to notice improvements in stress tolerance and mental clarity.
- **Combine Wisely:** Adaptogens can work synergistically. Consider blends that combine different herbs to cover multiple aspects of stress support.
- **Consult a Professional:** If you have ongoing health concerns or take other medications, speak with a healthcare provider before starting any adaptogenic herb.

### Additional Strategies to Complement Adaptogenic Benefits

While adaptogens offer powerful support for stress management, combining them with healthy lifestyle habits can enhance their effectiveness:

- **Practice Mindfulness:** Simple mindfulness exercises help calm the nervous system, making the body more receptive to adaptogens‚Äô balancing effects.
- **Stay Hydrated and Eat Nutrient-Dense Foods:** Proper nutrition supports adrenal health and overall resilience.
- **Regular Physical Activity:** Exercise reduces stress hormone levels and improves mood by releasing endorphins.
- **Prioritize Sleep:** Quality sleep restores mental balance and supports the body‚Äôs natural stress response systems.

### The Science Behind Adaptogens and Stress Management

Research over the past decades has increasingly validated the benefits of adaptogenic herbs through clinical trials and animal studies. For example, ashwagandha has been shown to significantly lower cortisol levels and reduce perceived stress in human participants. Rhodiola rosea demonstrates the ability to improve performance in individuals facing stress by enhancing energy metabolism and reducing mental fatigue.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
Moreover, adaptogens‚Äô antioxidant properties protect brain cells from oxidative stress, which is linked to anxiety and cognitive decline. These herbs modulate inflammation in the nervous system, maintaining healthy brain function and emotional stability.

By supporting multiple body pathways simultaneously, adaptogens provide a holistic approach to managing stress. Their gentle influence helps your body adapt naturally to stressors, avoiding the burnout often caused by chronic anxiety or overexertion.

### Empowering Yourself to Manage Stress Better

You have tools at your fingertips to improve how you handle stress, and adaptogenic herbs are a natural, safe addition to your wellness toolkit. As you explore herbal options, remember that mental balance is a journey, not a quick fix. With patience and consistency, these herbs can help you navigate everyday challenges with greater calm and clarity.

Incorporate adaptogens into a stress management plan that respects your unique needs. By finding the right blend and supporting your body through healthy habits, you can create a resilient foundation for lasting mental well-being.

### Choosing the Right Adaptogenic Herbs for Your Needs

Before adding adaptogenic herbs to your lifestyle, it‚Äôs important to select those that best match your individual requirements. Different herbs offer unique benefits:

- **Ashwagandha:** Known for reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** Enhances mental focus and combats fatigue.

‚Äã -Get 20% Off Adaptogen Mushroom Superblends Here:https://hownow101.github.io/Adaptogens - ‚Äã  
  
#### Start with Small, Consistent Doses

Begin by introducing adaptogens in small amounts to observe how your body responds. Many adaptogens are available in powder or capsule form. Starting with a half-dose or a teaspoon of powdered extract in the morning can be a gentle way to adjust.

#### Blend Adaptogens into Beverages

Add adaptogenic powders to your tea, coffee, smoothies, or even warm milk. For example, ashwagandha powder mixes well with a latte, creating a soothing drink that calms your nervous system. Rhodiola can be added to morning tea for enhanced alertness without the jitters of caffeine.

#### Combine with Mindful Practices

Adaptogens work best alongside mindfulness and relaxation techniques. Pair herb consumption with morning meditation, deep breathing exercises, or an evening wind-down routine. This combination supports your body‚Äôs stress management on multiple levels.

### Maximize Benefits Through Lifestyle Adjustments

- **Prioritize Sleep:** A consistent sleep schedule enhances adaptogens' effectiveness in stress reduction.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Proper hydration aids in detoxification and keeps your body balanced.
- **Exercise Regularly:** Physical activity further reduces stress hormones, amplifying the calming effects of adaptogens.

### Understanding Timing and Duration for Best Results

Adaptogens typically need to be taken consistently over a period of weeks to experience noticeable improvements in stress management. They are not quick fixes like stimulants or sedatives but work by gradually enhancing the body‚Äôs natural ability to handle stress. Morning intake can boost daily energy and focus, while evening doses‚Äîespecially of calming adaptogens like ashwagandha‚Äîmay improve sleep quality.

### Potential Precautions and Advice

While adaptogenic herbs are generally safe for most people, it‚Äôs important to pay attention to your body and any possible reactions. If you are pregnant, nursing, or taking medication, consult with a healthcare provider before starting adaptogens. Also, avoid high doses initially to prevent side effects such as digestive discomfort.

Keep in mind that not all products are created equal. Choose high-quality, organic supplements from reputable sources to ensure potency and purity. Reading labels carefully and looking out for third-party testing can help you avoid contaminants.

### Empowering Your Stress Management Journey

Integrating adaptogenic herbs into your daily life can be a straightforward and rewarding strategy for managing stress more effectively. By selecting the right herbs, incorporating them thoughtfully, and supporting your routine with healthy habits, you give your body the tools it needs to stay balanced and resilient. Over time, these natural allies can enhance your ability to face daily challenges with calm and clarity, improving your overall quality of life.

I wanted to share a quick update on my experience with LPR and ask for your long-term recovery stories.

My symptoms (started 2 years ago):
	‚Ä¢	Constant ‚Äúlump in throat‚Äù (globus sensation)
	‚Ä¢	Frequent throat clearing
	‚Ä¢	Sensation of blocked air on inhale (sometimes feels like choking)
	‚Ä¢	Tightness in the upper throat, especially when swallowing saliva
	‚Ä¢	No classic heartburn or burning sensation
	‚Ä¢	No sour taste or regurgitation

Diagnosis:
	‚Ä¢	ENT confirmed LPR based on nasoendoscopy and symptoms
	‚Ä¢	First exam showed thick mucus, swollen nasal and throat mucosa
	‚Ä¢	Second exam (1 month later) showed reduced inflammation, barely any mucus

Treatment so far (1 month strict):
	‚Ä¢	Medication: Emanera (esomeprazole), Esoxx One, Prokit (itopride), Ryaltris
	‚Ä¢	Strict low-acid, reflux-safe diet: no coffee, chocolate, fried food, citrus, alcohol, etc.


Results after 4 weeks:
	‚Ä¢	I rarely clear my throat now
	‚Ä¢	The mucus has decreased significantly
	‚Ä¢	Still have the globus sensation, but it‚Äôs a bit less intense
	‚Ä¢	No burning, no regurgitation
	‚Ä¢	I tested 100ml of clean vodka once ‚Äì no worsening
	‚Ä¢	Also tested mild yerba mate (Kraus sin humo) - no worsening 

Mindset:
I‚Äôm treating this like a ‚Äúsprained larynx‚Äù ‚Äì I believe that with rest, proper diet, and medication, it can heal. I understand it may take 3‚Äì6 months to fully calm the system down. I‚Äôm okay with occasional testing, as long as I track what triggers symptoms.

My question to you:
Have you completely silenced your LPR?

How long did it take?

Did the globus or breathing sensation ever fully go away?

What did you keep out of your life long-term ‚Äì and what were you able to bring back?

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who made it to full remission or stable, symptom-free living.

Thanks!

Phone glued to my hand. YouTube playing in the background 24/7. Brain so fried I couldn‚Äôt read a full paragraph without checking Reddit. I felt like my attention span was cooked.

So I spent 30 days resetting my brain ‚Äî not with cheesy self-help books, but actual stuff that worked. Here‚Äôs what helped me go from brain-fried to actually disciplined again:

Phase 1: Dopamine detox (the real kind)
	‚Ä¢	Phone went grayscale. Insta and TikTok became boring overnight.
	‚Ä¢	No social media before 12PM. Morning brain is sacred now.
	‚Ä¢	Blocked Reddit + YouTube during work hours. Cold-turkey. It hurt, but it worked.
	‚Ä¢	Made a ‚Äúdopamine menu‚Äù ‚Äî stuff that gives long-term joy: workouts, walking outside, journaling. When I get the itch to scroll, I pick one from the list.

Phase 2: Mental bootcamp
	‚Ä¢	Woke up and made my bed immediately ‚Äî it‚Äôs dumb but it flips a switch.
	‚Ä¢	Cold showers every morning. Instant reset button.
	‚Ä¢	10-minute ‚Äúmind dump‚Äù journaling every night. Stops the 2AM overthinking spiral.
	‚Ä¢	Practiced just sitting in silence for 5 minutes. No music. No phone. No stimulus. Surprisingly hard ‚Äî and that‚Äôs why it works.

Phase 3: Discipline by design
	‚Ä¢	Created a ‚Äúshutdown‚Äù ritual at night ‚Äî lights off, screens off, book out. Brain starts winding down automatically now.
	‚Ä¢	Broke my work into 90-minute blocks with real breaks. Way more sustainable than grinding nonstop.
	‚Ä¢	Took the pressure off being ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù Missed a day? Whatever. Show up tomorrow.
	‚Ä¢	Set 1 non-negotiable task per day. Do that, day‚Äôs a win. Bonus tasks = extra points.

Small habits that had big results:
	‚Ä¢	Chew gum while working (weirdly helps me focus).
	‚Ä¢	Switched coffee to matcha + L-theanine. No more jittery crashes.
	‚Ä¢	Set up a time-locking box for my phone. Game changer.
	‚Ä¢	Box breathing (4-4-4-4). Sounds cheesy. Works.

Final thoughts:

I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúhack‚Äù my brain. I just stopped poisoning it 24/7 and gave it space to work. If you‚Äôre stuck, don‚Äôt overcomplicate it. Just start. Build a system that helps you show up even when you feel like crap.",35,1746293354.0,getdisciplined,4,1.0,False

I was going to post this as a response to a very recent thread talking about how it should only take 1-2 weeks for the adenosine system to readjust to a new baseline after quitting caffeine, but Reddit wasn't letting me submit the post. I guess maybe OP deleted their post? 

Anyway, the point I was going to make is that caffeine doesn't just affect the adenosine system. Long-term, chronic caffeine use can also **reduce brain volume, decrease gray matter density** in different parts of the brain, and **inhibit neurogenesis and neural function** in the hippocampus, among other things. At least some people who consume large amount of caffeine on a daily basis for many years could quite literally have **smaller, less dense, and in some ways less functional brains**, which means that the caffeine recovery process may require the growth of new tissue throughout the brain. 

For reference, it takes [weeks to months for a single new neuron](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/adult-neurons-unique/) to grow and mature. Now project that timeframe out to imagine how long it might take to **transform brain structures and neural circuits that have been shaped and shriveled by decades of caffeine abuse** \- in many cases since early childhood, if not from the womb. It's very easy to imagine how, depending on an individual's sensitivity to caffeine, how long they have been using it, how much they have been using, and so on, it might take many months to recover. 

So, I think it's important for people to consider whether/how they might be using caffeine to self-medicate some underlying issue - whether that be a sleep disorder, emotional problem, etc, but **it's also important to not gaslight and dismiss people who did need many months** to recover from post-acute withdrawal syndrome without ever changing anything else about their lives. Sometimes it just takes a long time to quit caffeine, and it's better to be aware of that fact than to go in thinking it'll just be a quick week or two (even though it might be).

Hi everyone,
I wanted to share a quick update on my experience with LPR and ask for your long-term recovery stories.

My symptoms (started 2 years ago):
	‚Ä¢	Constant ‚Äúlump in throat‚Äù (globus sensation)
	‚Ä¢	Frequent throat clearing
	‚Ä¢	Sensation of blocked air on inhale (sometimes feels like choking)
	‚Ä¢	Tightness in the upper throat, especially when swallowing saliva
	‚Ä¢	No classic heartburn or burning sensation
	‚Ä¢	No sour taste or regurgitation

Diagnosis:
	‚Ä¢	ENT confirmed LPR based on nasoendoscopy and symptoms
	‚Ä¢	First exam showed thick mucus, swollen nasal and throat mucosa
	‚Ä¢	Second exam (1 month later) showed reduced inflammation, barely any mucus

Treatment so far (1 month strict):
	‚Ä¢	Medication: Emanera (esomeprazole), Esoxx One, Prokit (itopride), Ryaltris
	‚Ä¢	Strict low-acid, reflux-safe diet: no coffee, chocolate, fried food, citrus, alcohol, etc.


Results after 4 weeks:
	‚Ä¢	I rarely clear my throat now
	‚Ä¢	The mucus has decreased significantly
	‚Ä¢	Still have the globus sensation, but it‚Äôs a bit less intense
	‚Ä¢	No burning, no regurgitation
	‚Ä¢	I tested 100ml of clean vodka once ‚Äì no worsening
	‚Ä¢	Also tested mild yerba mate (Kraus sin humo) - no worsening 

Mindset:
I‚Äôm treating this like a ‚Äúsprained larynx‚Äù ‚Äì I believe that with rest, proper diet, and medication, it can heal. I understand it may take 3‚Äì6 months to fully calm the system down. I‚Äôm okay with occasional testing, as long as I track what triggers symptoms.

My question to you:
Have you completely silenced your LPR?

How long did it take?

Did the globus or breathing sensation ever fully go away?

What did you keep out of your life long-term ‚Äì and what were you able to bring back?

I‚Äôd love to hear from anyone who made it to full remission or stable, symptom-free living.

Thanks!

1kdy2he,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchreckNet/comments/1kdy2he/the_wraith_is_gone_and_demons_might_be_real/,The Wraith Is Gone And Demons Might Be Real,"So much has happened since the last time I posted it and frankly, I think I‚Äôm in a bit of a shock. Or traumatized. 

We never did find my coterie mate‚Äòs sire. I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs dealing with, but I hope it‚Äôs not too big of a shit storm. But me and my coterie mate are no longer haunted, and the wraith is in hell‚Ä¶.or eaten by a demon. And no, I‚Äôm not joking and I wish I was.

No, I‚Äôm not responsible. The moron of a ghost did it to himself. Though I didn‚Äôt get to bite him a bit and revenge before he went to his demise and yes, that‚Äôs a thing you can do. 

A Banu Haqim associate was doing an apprenticeship? Internship? Not sure what to call it, but he was studying under one of the Hecata. By the time me and my friend were too far into the consult it attacked, and she was on the ground, acting like she couldn‚Äôt breathe. Even though kindred don‚Äôt need to it looked awful. I‚Äôm glad we decided to act and not wait around.

Anyway, the Hecata takes us to this meat locker looking room, and I‚Äôm not sure whether we‚Äôre going to do a s√©ance or play a live action of dead by daylight or both. But she brings this hook down and manages to impale the fucker. That manages to keep him in place and to get him to stop attacking my friend for a little while. Meanwhile, while he‚Äôs cursing and threatening, she grinds up some bone and blood and smeared it on my forehead and upper and lower lips and suddenly I can see the damn thing that has been tormenting me for weeks.

He looked like an old store clerk. It was very disappointing. A squat, middle aged man was my nemesis?

So it turns out that he was my friend‚Äôs first meal when she had first been embraced. Not on purpose. You know how it is when you first wake up and your‚Äôre like us‚Ä¶. it was tragic, but not intentional.

I asked what the hell his beef was with me, and if it had caused me to lose control of my dementation that night. And the store clerk gives me the most spiteful, harrowing look and tells me that it was only after me because I was helping my friend. 

Frankly, I don‚Äôt care why he did it. I only care that it meant that he deserved what I did next. 

I decided I wanted to find out what a wraith tasted like. And you know it‚Äôs funny. Even though he called us monsters, he‚Äôs the one who tasted like an energy drink, hahaha.

And no, I didn‚Äôt drain all of his ‚Ä¶ ectoplasm? I think that‚Äôs what it was called. I was trying to get revenge, not kill him again. If that‚Äôs even possible.

And then this terrifying voice comes out of whatever dimension the ritual has brought us into and is mega pissy that the wrath allowed himself to be bitten by me . Something about claiming a soul.

‚Ä¶. I think my mind actually blacked out what I saw. But I think I saw horns. Something came out of the darkness for him. 

All I remember was the Hecata lady freaking out and then her and the Banu Haqim were tearing down all of the wards and sealing up the place that they taken us. Not just whatever spiritual realm or pocket dimension we had gone into but the entire Haven. I think she was ready to burn it and frankly I won‚Äôt be surprised if she returned later to do just that. 

All of us were a little freaked out and messed up after that confrontation. The ghost is gone. I don‚Äôt know what that thing did to him and have no interest in knowing. But demons are real. And the stupid ghost had made a pact with one. 

The Hecata wants to leave the city, possibly the country and can‚Äôt say I blame her. Perhaps that means she will forget about that boon I now owe. For a time.

My coterie member is back to normal and we are , by some miracle, unscathed, so if there is a god maybe he doesn‚Äôt hate us. Or he hates something else more.

I‚Äôm going to go home, drink the biggest pot of coffee and perhaps fall into torpor until I forget everything. 

I don‚Äôt know what this means. If what I saw tonight was real then nothing is too wild or outlandish to be real. ",7,1746292740.0,SchreckNet,5,1.0,False

I planned to take a more coast-hugging route back and to go further but my legs were too tired so I took a more direct route back.

Unlike when I‚Äôm hiking, I had to camp relatively close to the roads but I found the quietest spots I could and practised my stealth camping skills to ensure I bothered nobody. I pitched late and left early and took away as much of other people‚Äôs litter as I could. It‚Äôs sad how much crap has been strewn around our lovely lakes and lowlands. I was outraged every 5 to 10 minutes by what I saw.

Weather was spectacular, Thursday was hot as hell though and I nearly died getting to the top of Honister Pass but the cafe at the top fed me a sausage and bacon sandwich and so by the healing powers of pork, I was rejuvenated.

I camped with my ultralight poncho/tarp and bug bivi setup, the midges were about and biting but not in full force.

My secret weapon was bringing my hammock. I didn‚Äôt camp in it but I took a couple of rests in the hottest parts of the day for an hour or so.

1kdxyzx,https://i.redd.it/77rjr535olye1.png,DF54 Brew Burr Mini Review,"For those who are unaware, DF recently released a set of brew-specific burrs for the DF54. As seen in the photo, the geometry appears to be inspired by the Mahlkonig Guatemala burrs, a burr geometry which was made popular by SSP with their 64mm Brew and MP burrs.

The TL;DR is they are a great value burr set if you already own a DF54 and would like more clarity than the stock burrs offer.

I haven't spent a ton of time with these burrs, as I have a few grinders and burr combos that I'm playing with currently. I figured I'd post my early impressions, as I haven't seen anything posted about these burrs yet.

For filter: Clean brews with little-to-no astringency, but a bit one dimensional when compared to more expensive options from SSP, Timemore, etc. The drawdowns are fast, with few visible fines in the bed. They remind me of the Eureka 50mm brew burrs found in the Filtro and Crono. Not my favorite burr set ever, but a big step up from the stock espresso-focused burrs, and a very good value at $57 CAD (available from Eight Ounce Coffee).

The grind speed is crazy fast at filter settings, and the grounds are a little warm to the touch. I have no idea what impact this actually has, but I suspect it's not a good thing. I will try some very slow feeding at some point to see if it makes a noticeable difference. 

For espresso: Bright shots with punchy acidity and low astringency. I haven't tried many different coffees on espresso, as I'm just not really into espresso currently, but the florals in the washed Ethiopian I was brewing were very pronounced. A big upgrade from stock for modern-style espresso. 

I should note that I'm currently using a 54mm Breville machine, which doesn't require a super fine grind. I was only a few ticks away from burr chirp, so it's possible users with 58mm PF may struggle to produce a fine enough grind for traditional shots. I also haven't aligned the burrs, which can make a difference for more unimodal burrs at very fine settings.

Overall: For those looking for a high-clarity, budget-friendly, multipurpose electric grinder, this is a really great option - the best I'm aware of in its price range. I don't think I'd recommend it over the Ode Gen 2 for filter only, but it's also quite a bit cheaper, even with the extra cost of the second burr set.

1kdxylq,https://i.redd.it/q8j7k322olye1.jpeg,Regular mycelium growth or contamination?,"First time growing mushrooms. Does this look like normal mycelium growth to you?

I started this pink oyster mushroom about 6 days ago from a cultivated spawn bag, which I layered into straw that I purchased from a local feed store and pasteurized in hot water (>160) for 2 hours. I also added some used coffee grounds. Before adding all this into the bucket I had soaked the bucket in diluted bleach, then wiped it down with 70% isopropyl alcohol. I used sterile gloves to handle everything when adding the straw and spawn. Since then I‚Äôve tried to keep the temps around 68-70, and humidity is 85% or higher. I also have shiitake growing close by using the same process, which have some white fuzziness spreading as well, but not nearly as much as this pink oyster mushroom bucket.

Could this be contamination? Or just normal mycelium growth? Thanks in advance! ",1,1746292460.0,mycology,1,1.0,False

1kdxy2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/apprenticeuk/comments/1kdxy2f/ranking_the_winners_part_3_simon_ambrose_s3/,Ranking the Winners - Part 3: Simon Ambrose S3,"Simon is often regarded as a good winner but is never really anyone‚Äôs favourite winner either I‚Äôve noticed. At the time, Kristina was the overwhelming favourite to win as well. Let‚Äôs go over Simon‚Äôs run on the show and see how overrated or underrated he actually is.

As usual, the same rankings will be applied per episode based on his performance:

Fantastic

Good

Mixed

Invisible 

Bad

Awful 
____

*Series 3, Episode 1* - **Fantastic**

Both him and Tre were practically carrying the whole team in terms of sales of their coffee and only had to stop because Jadine stupidly pulled the mobile van back for no reason other than to lecture them on how to perfectly get the eclipse logo on top of their coffee.

*Episode 2* - **Good**

Came up with the dog blanket that collects hair which the entire focus group loved and should have been the clear option to go with. Sadly PM Rory refused to listen to anyone but himself.

*Episode 3* - **Invisible**

By far the most invisible episode for Simon. He did some grafting by cleaning customer‚Äôs backyards but it did seem like the job he did wasn‚Äôt received well by one of the customers. He also sang in the karaoke I guess. There‚Äôs just nothing here to call this a good or bad episode for him.

*Episode 4* - **Good**

Noted to be one of the few good salesman on Adam‚Äôs team and made sure to move his team‚Äôs stand to a more suitable location as the original one was placed in a shadowy area off to the side next to some air vents.

*Episode 5* - **Good**

Simon and Adam were the only two out of the whole team who were able to sell any of the art pieces. Now he also got swept up by the artist‚Äôs demands as well which wasn‚Äôt ideal but he was the only one (along with Adam) who contributed anything positive to this team.

*Episode 6* - **Good**

Yes he did annoy Jadine and Naomi at a point by constantly trying to force through his ideas but he was a great salesman on the actual day and contributed quite a fair bit to the task. The stand‚Äôs marketing was way better than the other team and seemed to negotiate well too for the products they got.

*Episode 7* - **Mixed**

This was Simon‚Äôs first win as PM and sadly I really don‚Äôt think it was a strong performance. In fact, his team only won by 97p. His negotiations were actually pretty poor all around and even one of them resulted in a fine due to getting a second hand version of the product. I do think his leadership was fine overall which keeps this one from being lower.

*Episode 8* - **Good**

Acted in the sneaker advert after the other actors were unqualified for the role, offered ideas, dealt with Tre being moody and overall was upbeat and positive for most of the task.

*Episode 9* - **Bad**

Simon was very lucky to escape the boardroom here and Margaret even agrees with me in the episode. He wrote down a list of numbers to call for the other team only for them to find out that most of the numbers were incorrect anyway. Both him and Tre were a complete mess all day with no strategy.

*Episode 10* - **Awful**

Simon‚Äôs most infamous performance - The trampoline incident. It‚Äôs safe to say he was a horrible presenter but also he chose really out there products as well. How many people watching teleshopping are in dire need of a wheelchair? 

*The Final* - **Good**

Simon‚Äôs end design and presentation for the building ended up being a lot better than Kristina‚Äôs team. Now I can‚Äôt put Fantastic here because he was quite poor on the first day, ignoring the other sub-team and being totally swept up by Tre and his suggestion to go with a boat design that surely would have not gone down well. However Jadine‚Äôs pep talk whipped him into shape and he ran the team very well for the rest of the final.

**Simon‚Äôs Final Stats**

Fantastic - 1 Episode

Good - 6 Episodes

Mixed - 1 Episode

Invisible - 1 Episode 

Bad - 1 Episode

Awful - 1 Episode 

Honestly Simon might be the most underrated winner now that I‚Äôve done this list. He‚Äôs kinda similar to Tim in that he struggled a little bit in the second half of the process but he contributed positively in nearly every other task. I think the big problem with him is that both his PM outings weren‚Äôt particularly impressive which might harm his overall ranking. I‚Äôm quite torn on who should be higher out of Tim and Simon but I‚Äôm going to put Tim simply because Tim‚Äôs PM performances were so much stronger than Simon‚Äôs despite Simon having 1 more good task over him. I think both of them will remain highly ranked in my overall Winner‚Äôs Rankings when it‚Äôs over.

1kdxwb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1kdxwb9/should_you_choose_delsey_paris_sky_max_luggage/,Should you Choose DELSEY Paris Sky Max Luggage Review for Seamless Travels?,"Crafting a full-bodied review for the DELSEY Paris Sky Max 2.0 Softside Expandable Luggage with Spinner Wheels was quite the adventure. As someone who travels frequently, testing a suitcase that promises durability, lightweight design, and functionality felt like a golden opportunity to see if it could keep up with my lifestyle. With a history dating back to 1946, DELSEY has built its brand around blending tradition and innovation. So, I strapped in for a hands-on exploration of this piece, and here‚Äôs what I discovered.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, I noticed the elegant twill pattern on the polyester fabric. A suitcase might not seem like the most stylish thing in the world, but this one genuinely stands out. The construction feels sturdy, and the lightweight material immediately caught my attention. I could toss this into the trunk of a car without breaking a sweat. The spinner wheels are a lifesaver for maneuvering crowded airports, gliding smoothly with just the slightest nudge. What I appreciate most is how the exterior looks polished yet practical, which is rare for softside luggage.

**Packing Convenience**

Space is the name of the game, and this bag does not disappoint. There‚Äôs a generous main compartment, perfect for business trips or extended getaways. Five exterior pockets give you room for shoes, toiletries, or those random knickknacks you always forget until 10 minutes before departure. Organizing everything felt oddly satisfying‚ÄîI‚Äôm not even an organized packer usually, yet this design made me rethink that. The interior zippers are self-repairing, which feels like a minor miracle when you‚Äôve dealt with broken zippers mid-trip before.

**Advantages**

- Spinner wheels deliver smooth, effortless rolling.  
- Several exterior pockets make organization simple, even for over-packers.  
- Lightweight build without compromising durability.  
- Dual carrying options: use the carry handles or the adjustable shoulder strap.  

[Grab DELSEY Paris Sky Max 2.0 pricing details on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0b6m8sn3w/)

**Handling and Transport**

Although the Sky Max 2.0 is technically softside luggage, it doesn‚Äôt exhibit the fragility you might associate with that type. The dual-wrapping carry handles are comfortable to hold, and the removable shoulder strap offers a hands-free option when my hands were juggling coffee and a boarding pass. Sliding it over the handles of a rolling suitcase with the integrated smart band felt like a breeze. However, I found that overloading it can cause a slight wobble, making the bag less secure when stacked atop larger suitcases.

**Limitations**

- Overloading can create stability issues when paired with other luggage.  
- The polyester, while durable, might lack the water resistance that some hard-shell cases provide.  

**Performance and Capacity**

I‚Äôm the kind of traveler who brings ‚Äújust-in-case‚Äù items like an extra pair of shoes, so space is a huge plus here. This luggage fits plenty while staying lightweight enough not to curse myself later for packing it. Performance-wise, the wheels rolled with precision across various surfaces, from sleek airport tiles to rugged parking lot gravel. The ergonomic zipper pulls make accessing the contents smooth, and the stitching seems to hold up even under stress.

**Competitive Options**

Comparing it to market rivals such as Samsonite or Travelpro, the DELSEY Sky Max 2.0 stands out in terms of lightweight functionality and additional compartments for storage. Samsonite might offer a more premium build with hard-shell options or additional water resistance, but you trade off some of the storage flexibility. Travelpro competes on durability and is a frequent flyer favorite, though it can sometimes feel bulkier. The Sky Max 2.0 finds a good middle ground with spacious design while being carry-on friendly in many cases.

**Value Proposition**

In terms of cost-effectiveness, this suitcase provides excellent quality for a price point that won‚Äôt make your wallet cry. It doesn‚Äôt have premium extras like USB chargers or biometric locks, but such features are not always necessary unless you're after technological frills. For the minimalist who values smooth navigation and capacity over gimmicks, this luggage stands as a strong contender. Whether for business or leisure, the Sky Max 2.0 feels like an investment built for utility and long-term use without breaking the bank.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Discover Stunning Beaches Without Breaking the Bank

Dreaming of sandy shores and ocean breezes but worried about the cost? You're not alone. For budget-conscious travelers, finding beautiful beaches that don't charge an entry fee combined with affordable nearby hotels is like striking gold. Luckily, there are numerous coastal gems around the world that offer just that‚Äîa perfect blend of natural beauty and wallet-friendly accommodation.

### Why Choose Beaches with Free Entry?

Many popular beach destinations have started imposing entry fees to cover maintenance and crowd control. While these fees support local services, they can add up, especially for families or frequent visitors. Beaches with free entry allow you to soak in sun and surf without extra costs, letting your money go towards other travel pleasures like delicious food, excursions, or souvenirs.

### Key Factors When Selecting Budget-Friendly Beach Destinations

To make the most of your beach getaway, consider these factors:

- **Accessibility:** Look for beaches close to public transport or main roads to save on travel expenses.
- **Hotel Prices:** Explore accommodations that are inexpensive but safe and comfortable.
- **Local Amenities:** Nearby restaurants, shops, and market stalls can enhance your experience without driving up costs.
- **Seasonality:** Traveling during off-peak seasons often means lower hotel rates and fewer crowds.

Muizenberg is famous for its colorful beach huts and surf-friendly waves. The beach itself is free for visitors. Nearby, affordable lodgings including B&amp;Bs and hostels welcome travelers on a budget. Local cafes offer delicious pastries and coffee without a hefty price tag.

- **Book early:** Often, the best budget hotels fill up fast. Reserve your spot ahead of time to snag the lowest rates.
- **Use local transportation:** Skip expensive taxis and use buses or bicycle rentals where possible.
- **Eat like a local:** Street food and small eateries usually offer delicious meals at a fraction of tourist prices.
- **Travel off-season:** Avoid peak holiday times to enjoy discounted prices and fewer crowds.
 
Exploring spectacular beaches that don‚Äôt charge an entry fee and pairing them with affordable nearby hotels allows you to experience paradise without stress. Whether you desire tropical vibes in Southeast Asia, surf spots in South America, or charming coastal towns in Europe, this list proves that enjoying the beach on a budget is truly possible.

</div>Tips for Finding Cheap Accommodation Close to Popular Beach Destinations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Choosing the Right Location Near the Beach

When searching for affordable accommodation close to a popular beach, it helps to look just beyond the prime beachfront areas. Properties directly on the sand tend to carry a premium price due to their location and scenic views. However, staying a little inland or within neighboring neighborhoods can offer significant savings. For example, towns a few miles away from major beach hubs often provide budget-friendly hotels and guesthouses while still granting easy access to the beach.

Consider what matters most to you: is it waking up to the sound of waves or having convenient amenities nearby? Sometimes, a short bus or bike ride to the beach can be worth the lower nightly rates. Use online maps and public transit options to identify accessible places that won‚Äôt break your travel budget.

### Leverage Online Platforms to Compare Prices

Take full advantage of multiple travel and booking websites that specialize in comparing accommodation prices. Sites like Booking.com, Agoda, Airbnb, and Hostelworld allow you to filter stays by proximity to popular beach destinations and price range, making it easier to uncover budget-friendly options. Enable email alerts to get notifications for price drops or flash sales on hotels near your favorite beach.

#### Tips for Effective Online Searching:

- Use filters to narrow down by distance from landmarks or beaches.
- Sort by lowest price first and read recent guest reviews carefully.
- Check cancellation policies to avoid hidden fees.
- Compare reviews on independent platforms like TripAdvisor.
 
### Consider Alternative Lodging Options

Besides traditional hotels, explore other accommodations that tend to be cheaper and often have a unique charm. Hostels, vacation rentals, guesthouses, and small boutique inns can provide affordable, comfortable stays close to the beach. Platforms like Airbnb often feature private rooms or entire apartments at competitive rates, especially if you book early or for longer stays.

You can also look for beachside campsites or eco-lodges if you enjoy a more outdoorsy experience. Some destinations offer community-run hostels with shared facilities, combining low cost with the opportunity to meet fellow travelers.

### Timing Is Key

Travel dates significantly impact accommodation prices near beaches. Peak tourist seasons, holidays, and weekends typically drive rates higher. To find cheap hotels near popular beaches, travel during the shoulder seasons or midweek when demand drops. For example, booking a stay from Tuesday to Thursday usually yields better deals than weekend nights.

Avoiding major festivals or local events can also save you money. Use a flexible date search feature on booking sites to spot the most affordable periods. Planning well in advance lets you lock in low rates and find hidden gems.

### Direct Booking and Negotiation

Once you identify a few ideal properties, reach out directly to the hotel or guesthouse. Sometimes, booking fare directly through their website or via phone offers discounts not available on third-party platforms. This can also allow for requests like early check-in, late checkout, or free upgrades.

In smaller seaside towns, owners may be open to negotiating long-term rates or off-season discounts if you communicate clearly. Always ask if there are unpublished deals, especially if you plan to stay several nights.

### Utilize Travel Forums and Local Insights

Engage with travel communities online where personal experiences shine. Forums like Lonely Planet‚Äôs Thorn Tree or Reddit‚Äôs travel subreddits often have threads on budget accommodations near top beaches. You‚Äôll discover lesser-known spots that don‚Äôt appear high on commercial booking sites but offer great value.

Reaching out to locals via social media or travel blogs can also reveal affordable lodging options. Often, small family-run inns don‚Äôt heavily advertise online but give excellent service and authentic cultural immersion.

### Factor In Transportation Costs

Cheap hotel rates near a beach don‚Äôt always mean overall savings. Calculate transportation expenses between the accommodation and beach carefully. If taking taxis or renting scooters frequently, small savings on hotels can be offset. Prioritize locations with good public transport or walkable access to the shore.

Sometimes, a slightly pricier hotel right on the beach can be more cost-effective by eliminating daily travel expenses. Assess total costs before finalizing your booking.

### Book Early and Be Ready to Act Fast

Popular beach destinations fill up quickly, especially for accommodations with free or low entry fees to nearby attractions. Early bookings often secure the best rates and rooms that match your preferences. Keep your travel documents ready and payment details organized so you can complete reservations swiftly when good deals appear.

Monitoring multiple booking platforms and subscribing to travel deal newsletters enables you to jump on discounts before they expire.

### Summary of Practical Tips

- Look just outside main beach areas for cheaper options
- Use comparison websites and flexible date searches
- Explore hostels, guesthouses, and vacation rentals
- Travel during shoulder seasons and weekdays
- Book directly and try negotiating with property owners
- Leverage advice from travel forums and locals
- Consider total costs, including daily transport
- Reserve early to lock in the best deals
 
By applying these strategies, you can enjoy your time near stunning beaches without spending a fortune on accommodation. With a bit of research and flexibility, you‚Äôll find the perfect spot that suits both your budget and beach vacation dreams.

</div>### Conclusion

Discovering beautiful beaches that don‚Äôt charge an entry fee, combined with affordable hotels nearby, makes for an ideal vacation without breaking the bank. By focusing your search on these 10 beaches with free entry and cheap nearby hotels, you open the door to unforgettable experiences filled with sun, sand, and savings.

When hunting for inexpensive places to stay near popular beach spots, simple strategies can make a big difference.

Use online travel platforms and read reviews carefully to find accommodations that offer clean, safe, and comfortable lodging while keeping your budget intact.

Ultimately, combining free beach access with cleverly chosen cheap hotels creates a perfect balance for travelers seeking relaxation and adventure on a budget.

Renato and I were hanging by a thread. The fast-paced life in S√£o Paulo had drained us: our patience, our humor‚Äîeven our silence. Everything was noise, lines, traffic, pressure. So when we saw that ad on the vacation rental website, it felt like a sign. *‚ÄúRustic house high up in the mountains, perfect for those seeking peace and isolation.‚Äù* Exactly what we needed.

The drive there was long and bumpy. By the time we left the asphalt and hit the dirt road, the sun was already beginning to set. We passed through thick forest, a few abandoned fields, and then... nothing. No houses, no human sounds. Just the wind and the song of birds I had never heard before.

The house was older than the pictures had shown, but it had a certain charm‚Äîsloped red-tile roof, wooden porch, a collapsed fence on one side. I opened the door and the smell hit right away: damp wood mixed with something else... hard to describe. A musty scent, like cloth stored in a basement. Renato made a joke, calling it ‚Äúthe smell of peace and quiet.‚Äù

Inside, the house was simple. A living room with an old couch, thick rug, a small kitchen with white cabinets. The bedrooms were upstairs, but one thing caught my eye immediately: an old, solid wood cabinet that didn‚Äôt match the others, which were modern and metallic. The wall behind it stood out too. It didn‚Äôt match the rest of the kitchen. It was wooden, while the others were made of brick and mortar. I ran my hand over it out of curiosity.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúWeird wall,‚Äù I said to Renato.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúYou and your horror movies,‚Äù he laughed.  
I let it go. It was just a wall.

That first night was quiet, which alone made the whole drive worth it. Used to horns, sirens, and street yelling, the forest silence was almost deafening. We went to bed early.

I woke the next morning with *that feeling*. You know the one‚Äîlike someone‚Äôs watching you, even when no one‚Äôs there. I went to the kitchen to make coffee and stepped onto the porch in my pajamas, trying to shake off the weight in my chest with the smell of trees and earth.

That‚Äôs when I noticed the footprints.  
In the soft dirt by the side of the house‚Äîhuman footprints. They led up to the living room window... and stopped. They didn‚Äôt return. Didn‚Äôt go further. Just stopped, as if whoever made them had vanished into thin air.  
I called Renato. He tried to laugh it off.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúProbably the caretaker.‚Äù  
‚Äî ‚ÄúThere is no caretaker.‚Äù  
‚Äî ‚ÄúMaybe from an old guest.‚Äù  
But the prints were fresh. The earth was still dark and damp. Hard to ignore.

That night, we locked everything up. I checked the doors and windows twice. A third time, just to be sure.

At two in the morning, I woke up to a low sound coming from the kitchen. A slow creaking. Like a door being opened very carefully.

I called Renato. He got up to check. Came back saying everything was fine‚Äîbut I knew better. A small voice inside me told me to stay alert.

¬†

The next day, after breakfast, Renato and I decided to explore the area around the house. The mist still clung to the woods, but gradually, the sun tore through the white veil and revealed the landscape: hills covered in low brush, a few twisted trees, and a silence broken only by birdsong.

It was beautiful, I won‚Äôt lie. A silence that seeped into your skin. We walked slowly, hand in hand, saying little. It felt like the whole place was waiting for us to be quiet‚Äîto listen better.

After about forty minutes of walking, we saw the ‚Äúneighbor‚Äôs house‚Äù the ad had mentioned‚Äîthe only one for miles, according to the owner. An old structure with mud walls and a crooked roof. There was a low fence and a wooden gate hanging by one hinge.

That‚Äôs when I saw him.

A boy. Skinny, maybe 17 at most. Worn-out shirt, pants too big, dark hair falling across his face. He stood at the edge of the woods, about twenty yards from the house. Not moving. Just watching us.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúYou see him?‚Äù I asked.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúYeah. Is he... staring at us?‚Äù Renato squeezed my hand.

The boy didn‚Äôt say anything. Didn‚Äôt move. Just stared with an intensity that sent chills through me. It wasn‚Äôt curiosity. It felt like he was studying us.

I felt exposed. Like we were naked in that landscape. The discomfort rose so fast we didn‚Äôt even need to speak‚Äîwe turned and walked back the same way. Not running, but not looking back either.

When the house appeared between the trees, my heart jumped. The door. It was slightly open.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúDid you lock it?‚Äù I asked, already knowing the answer.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

We approached slowly. The kitchen light was on. I swear I‚Äôd turned everything off before we left. Renato went in first. I stayed by the door, holding my breath.

Nothing seemed out of place. The living room looked the same, backpacks in the same corner. But something... I can‚Äôt explain.

Renato searched every room, opened cabinets, looked behind doors. Nothing. No sign of a break-in.

But the feeling didn‚Äôt go away. The same one I‚Äôd had the night before. Like something in that house was watching us.

And worse: now it knew we knew.

¬†

That night, I woke up with a start. The mattress was moving slowly. When I opened my eyes, I saw Renato getting up, stepping carefully on the wooden floor.

‚Äî ‚ÄúRenato... what is it?‚Äù I murmured, still half-asleep.

He paused for a second, then whispered:  
‚Äî ‚ÄúI think I heard something downstairs.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. I sat up, straining to hear what he had. Nothing. Just silence. But the way he said it killed any urge I had to argue.

We grabbed our jackets and went down slowly, one step at a time. When we turned the hallway corner, the kitchen light was on again.

Standing at the edge of the room, it took us a few seconds to notice. Renato pointed at the floor, eyes wide. The floor was full of marks. Footprints. He knelt down and ran his hand across the dirty tiles.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúIs this... mud?‚Äù I whispered.  
The muddy prints led straight to the wooden cabinet‚Äîthe oldest one in the kitchen.  
The trail stopped there. ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù he muttered. I said nothing, just scanned the room, feeling that deep, cold fear you only feel when something‚Äôs *really* wrong.

Renato slowly opened the cabinet, expecting... who knows what. But there was nothing‚Äîjust plates, old pans, some cans of corn.  
Carefully, he began tapping the sides of the cabinet with his knuckles. Solid wood... until he hit the back. The sound changed. Hollow.

He looked at me. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something here.‚Äù That‚Äôs when we saw it‚Äîa barely noticeable groove in the wall beside it. He pulled hard and the wooden panel creaked, revealing a short door with a rusty old latch. Renato reached for it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt open it yet,‚Äù I said instinctively. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs think. Let‚Äôs call someone‚Ä¶‚Äù

Renato froze, hand still on the latch, as if struggling inside. I didn‚Äôt want to seem hysterical, but everything in me screamed *do not go further*. That‚Äôs when we heard it‚Äîa sound like a woman screaming.

¬†

Renato yanked the latch. It cracked like a dry bone snapping. The door opened a few inches with a groan, and a strong smell rushed out. Something between stagnant water and rotting flesh. I recoiled instinctively, covering my face. My stomach turned.

Renato turned on his phone‚Äôs flashlight and pointed it inside. It was a tunnel. Narrow, damp, the walls supported by wooden beams, lined with uneven stones and moss. The floor was dirt and mud, with fresh footprints mixed into the muck. It didn‚Äôt look like a basement‚Äîmore like a coal mine.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt normal, Renato.‚Äù My voice was trembling. He nodded, but looked hypnotized. He crouched and went in, and I followed. The light swung across the walls like it was revealing secrets that didn‚Äôt want to be seen.

The tunnel branched off underground. We followed the one that spiraled downward for a few yards, ending at a wooden door reinforced with beams and chains. On the floor were marks, as if something heavy had been dragged to that spot. The air smelled stronger there‚Äîalmost unbearable.

Renato ran his hand along the doorknob. Locked. But there was a small gap between the door and the frame. He brought the flashlight closer, and I leaned beside him to peek inside.

And that‚Äôs when we saw, for the first time, proof that something horrifying had happened there.

There were remains. Bones. Some small, others far too big to belong to animals. Torn fabric stained with dried blood. A chain hanging from a hook in the wall. A rusty bucket in the corner. We had no idea how long we stood there, paralyzed. But when we finally turned to go back through the tunnel‚Äîguided only by the weak phone flashlight‚Äîwe were horrified to discover the passage we came through... was now closed.

¬†

Something heavy was blocking the path. Renato pushed hard, but it was useless.  
""What do we do now?"" I whispered, barely able to speak.  
Before he could answer, we heard voices coming from the dark tunnels behind us. Twisted laughter and the sound of footsteps in the mud. Renato turned off the flashlight, and we stood still in total darkness, listening to our own hearts pounding too loud.  
When they noticed our presence, they began to shout and run toward us.  
Without thinking, we bolted through the tunnel, stumbling and hitting the dirt walls. We ran blind, guided only by the instinct to survive, trying to escape the maddened voices that seemed to close in from every side.

That‚Äôs when we found another door. Old wood, the lock nearly rotted through. We knocked, pushed, but it seemed locked. Behind us, the voices drew closer.  
The door creaked and suddenly opened. A small room, stinking of mold and rot. And inside, almost invisible in the dim light, was the boy we‚Äôd seen outside ‚Äî thin, filthy, eyes wide open. Without a word, he made a quick gesture for silence.  
We rushed inside, and he quietly closed the door, sliding a piece of wood across it to act as a lock. From the other side, we heard our pursuers arrive and start banging, trying to break it down.  
The boy pointed to another exit ‚Äî a trapdoor hidden under a pile of torn clothes.  
With hurried gestures, he guided us. We crawled through a tight passage that led into the kitchen of the house. There, we saw a woman ‚Äî his mother, I assumed ‚Äî with her back to us, cooking something on a wood stove. She was humming a children‚Äôs song off-key, unaware of our presence.

With quiet steps, we crossed the room. The boy opened the back door. The cold night air hit us like a slap. And we escaped into the yard, running without looking back.  
He stayed at the threshold, motionless, watching as we disappeared into the darkness.

We ran through the yard, not looking back. The tall grass cut our legs, branches scratched our arms, but the only thing that mattered was getting out. Renato chose not to turn on his phone flashlight again so we wouldn't give away our position. The moonlight barely lit the path, but even in the dark we could see our car parked at the front of the house, just as we‚Äôd left it.  
Renato pulled the keys from his pocket and tried to unlock the car, but it didn‚Äôt work.  
""Damn it‚Ä¶"" he muttered, pressing the button over and over.  
That‚Äôs when we noticed all four tires were slashed and the hood was slightly open ‚Äî the battery was gone. They wanted to keep us trapped.

The voices and footsteps were getting closer. We could clearly hear more than one ‚Äî several ‚Äî coming toward us. They shouted nonsense, some laughing like kids playing tag.  
""Run! Run!"" Renato yelled.  
We left the car and dove into the dense underbrush, heading the opposite way from the voices. The cold night air burned our lungs with each frantic breath. Thorns tore our clothes, but the adrenaline kept us from feeling any pain.  
After what felt like an eternity of blind running, we saw something ahead: metal structures reflecting the faint light. As we got closer, we saw what it was ‚Äî an empty lot filled with old, abandoned cars swallowed by weeds.  
We didn‚Äôt think twice. We began opening doors, trying to find a vehicle that could still save us.

Most were just junk: rust, rotted seats, broken steering wheels.  
Then Renato whispered, ""Here! This one!""  
It was an old car, but intact. And miraculously, the key was still in the ignition.  
Without hesitation, he turned the key. The engine coughed once, twice‚Ä¶ then caught, sputtering but alive.  
As Renato revved the engine to keep it going, I saw through the broken windows of the junkyard ‚Äî shadows approaching. Three of them, running, waving their arms like rabid animals.  
""Go! Go! Go!"" I shouted.  
Renato floored it. The car jerked forward, bumping into old shells of metal and wood. As we reached the dirt road, we could already see some of the pursuers coming out of the brush, their faces twisted with rage.

We left that hell behind. The house, the tunnel, the pursuers ‚Äî all disappearing in the rearview mirror, swallowed by the darkness. But the car didn‚Äôt make it much farther. The engine died, leaving us stranded in the middle of the woods and night. Still, it was far enough to get away from that nightmare.

After hours of walking through the forest, exhausted, filthy, and still terrified, we finally reached the main road. We flagged down the first car we saw, and the driver, seeing our condition, didn‚Äôt hesitate to take us to the nearest police station.  
Sitting under the cold lights of the lobby, we recounted everything we had been through: the isolated house, the tunnels, the pursuers, the mute boy who helped us. As we spoke, the officers exchanged glances ‚Äî some serious, others with a mix of disbelief and unease.  
Despite everything, they agreed to go with us to the place, now in broad daylight, to verify our story.

We arrived at the house, now bathed in sunlight. From a distance, it looked like just another old farmhouse. But as the officers inspected the area, they began to find signs: trails, debris, fresh marks in the dirt.  
Inside, the scene showed signs of a rushed abandonment ‚Äî still-warm pots, clothes strewn about, inner doors flung open. In the tunnels, the officers found disturbing evidence: personal belongings from several people, IDs, broken phones, torn clothes.  
One of the officers muttered while examining the items:  
""We‚Äôve suspected that family for years... The Hobolds.""  
They explained that the family, of German descent, had long been investigated for the disappearances of tourists in the region, but there had never been enough proof. Now, with our testimony and the evidence found, they could finally act.

As I got into the police car, I looked back one last time. For a moment, I thought I saw the silhouette of the mute boy at the window, watching us. I felt a bitter mix of relief and sorrow. He had saved us... but was still trapped in that nightmare.",3,1746291995.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Renato and I were hanging by a thread. The fast-paced life in S√£o Paulo had drained us: our patience, our humor‚Äîeven our silence. Everything was noise, lines, traffic, pressure. So when we saw that ad on the vacation rental website, it felt like a sign. *‚ÄúRustic house high up in the mountains, perfect for those seeking peace and isolation.‚Äù* Exactly what we needed.

The drive there was long and bumpy. By the time we left the asphalt and hit the dirt road, the sun was already beginning to set. We passed through thick forest, a few abandoned fields, and then... nothing. No houses, no human sounds. Just the wind and the song of birds I had never heard before.

The house was older than the pictures had shown, but it had a certain charm‚Äîsloped red-tile roof, wooden porch, a collapsed fence on one side. I opened the door and the smell hit right away: damp wood mixed with something else... hard to describe. A musty scent, like cloth stored in a basement. Renato made a joke, calling it ‚Äúthe smell of peace and quiet.‚Äù

Inside, the house was simple. A living room with an old couch, thick rug, a small kitchen with white cabinets. The bedrooms were upstairs, but one thing caught my eye immediately: an old, solid wood cabinet that didn‚Äôt match the others, which were modern and metallic. The wall behind it stood out too. It didn‚Äôt match the rest of the kitchen. It was wooden, while the others were made of brick and mortar. I ran my hand over it out of curiosity.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúWeird wall,‚Äù I said to Renato.  
‚Äî ‚ÄúYou and your horror movies,‚Äù he laughed.  
I let it go. It was just a wall.

That first night was quiet, which alone made the whole drive worth it. Used to horns, sirens, and street yelling, the forest silence was almost deafening. We went to bed early.

I woke the next morning with *that feeling*. You know the one‚Äîlike someone‚Äôs watching you, even when no one‚Äôs there. I went to the kitchen to make coffee and stepped onto the porch in my pajamas, trying to shake off the weight in my chest with the smell of trees and earth.

i‚Äôve been feeling the symptoms for a couple of months, like just one day i woke up and i was a different person, mood swings mania cloudy mind all the stuff.

but a crazy thing that changed in me was my reaction to caffeine. before all my symptoms appeared, i could have caffeine and it wasn‚Äôt really a big thing. i‚Äôve never been a coffee or energy drink liker, and i know that back then before this i had bad reactions to energy drinks, but it wasn‚Äôt ever like how it is now.

now, even if i have small amounts, like in a can soda (which has never been a prob before) it triggers mania-like symptoms. the buzzing skin, i feel tired and also like i need to run a million miles, LOUD thoughts, the inability to comprehend the consequences of my actions, aggression, and talking fast. and this has happened MULTIPLE times when i have just small amounts of caffeine. and this has only started happening when the bipolar symptoms started showing up.

is this normal? should i just avoid caffeine forever? it‚Äôs an INTENSE reaction. like ive never seen anything like it in anyone else when they have caffeine. 

just curious if this is a me thing or if this is common with bipolar people or??? i don‚Äôt know. i think i‚Äôll talk to the psychiatrist about it.",1,1746291901.0,bipolar,2,1.0,False

Looking for specific advice on buying a beginner machine. First off, I'm not a HUGE coffee snob but I enjoy coffee. I use a mokapot daily and make milk-based drinks. I have an Aeroccino that I use for steaming/frothing. I'm looking to upgrade to an espresso machine. 

I drink coffee every morning but hoping to host biweekly/monthly coffee parties with a group of 4-5 friends so I looked at the Breville Dual Boiler + Baratza for a grinder. I'm looking at a dual boiler specifically because I was hoping to make multiple drinks at a time for these parties, but since I have an Aeroccino that does a lot of my steaming too, do I really need the BDB or can I downgrade to something like the Bambino+Baratza? 

Cost is not a huge issue but I'm frugal and would love to stay <$2000 if possible. Thanks!",1,1746291877.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

Last night I had my 1st one night stand. It was just so easy. When a girl just thinks your attractive and is sexually free, things just happen. I met her on tinder. We went out for coffee and then she invited me home at the same night. She introduced me to her parents (I know weird... but whatever.) We then just hanged out for a bit, I used the basic line, do u wanna kiss me? She said yes. And then led me to her room. We had great sex for about an hour or more... and then just cuddled till morning. She made me coffee, told me to say goodbye to her parents and led me out.... BRO, what just happened?

Why the need to invite themselves into my me activity instead of asking   for a  coffee or walk with them at another time? My gut says this may be some sort of ego protection but idk, it does seem easy to just invite themselves in. Honestly in each case I lost some attraction because of it.

I was in a DV situation at the time and ended up in a Psych ward, where I was helped to get out of the situation. I met this person in the ward as a patient and we seemed to get along really well. The friendship has gone on for 7 months now.

We were always fairly open about discussing things normally, but at times they wanted me to be covert about what they do for work (sex work), especially in front of roommates. I never spoke about it openly in front of others, but sometimes, when they talked about their work (covertly) while we were in the loungeroom and their roommates were in their bedrooms, I might use a term that wasn't very covert (sex workers, beds etc.).

Last night they had left their journal (with work stuff in it) on the coffee table and we're worried their housemates had read it. After that we started chatting, they showed me some photos of their workplace and talked about their work and relationships and such (roommates were in bed) and I used the term ""sex workers"" in conversation without thinking, I suppose because I felt we were alone.

After that, we went outside to discuss things. They spoke kindly to me, asked what I needed. They said that I had ""outed"" them, though and that they will probably move out of their place now to live in another city. I asked if we would stay in contact, they didn't answer directly, but implied that we wouldn't.

I sent an apology. Now they are sending me the contacts of mutual friends (trying up loose ends I guess) and acting very distant but cordial. They left something in my car that I need to meet them to return tomorrow and I feel like it will be awkward. At this point

I can't tell if I am in the wrong or not. Or how in the wrong I am.

There are some things that I think are relevant.

.They recently told their housemates that I thought one of the housemate's straight friends was attractive without asking me if it was ok (I am a gay man).

.They have had a lot of falling outs with friends and family in the past. They have several friend groups blocked on Instagram.

. They have been diagnosed with BPD, but they believe they were misdiagnosed.

.If I'm being honest, I have been bothered by their habit of judging people based on their physical appearance in the past, and value themselves for their beauty. I did bring it up to some degree by letting them know it made me feel insecure.

I feel like I'd just like to step away from the friendship at this point, even if they change their mind, but I'm worried I will make similar mistakes in other friendships and screw them up as well, as I am trying to become more involved in the queer community.

How bad was what I did?

How can I avoid doing it again in the future?

1kdxoe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1kdxoe1/ok_im_in/,"Ok, I'm in","Hi,

So, recently I bought some instant coffee that I usually like as I always do. However, this batch was very bitter and tasteless at the same time.  
I restarted my passion again of searching for other methods to drink coffee, I tried capsules before and didn't like that I had to buy the capsules, so that didn't continue for so long.  
Anyway, first I wanted a full automatic, but it was expensive and I really don't have much place to put that machine in, but it was a safe choice since I tried its coffee at work and I liked it.  
then I circulated the idea of aeropress again in my mind and watched couple of videos, I decided to get a one which I did for (40‚Ç¨), and in addition to that bought a cheap grinder from amazon (20‚Ç¨).  
I watched James Hoffmanns beans choosing video, and settled on some cheap super market brand (13‚Ç¨/kilo) to try for my first.  
I opened my machine, ground my coffee with some doubt, and did couple of mistakes following the recipe (again james hoffmans).  
But to my surprise the coffee was much better than any instant coffee, actually it was less bitter than my work super automatic.  
So, now I'm keeping it, and I am officially in your team.

So there I was, sipping on my third coffee of the day, eyes glued to the charts like they're the last season of Breaking Bad. ETH's been doing a number on my poor wallet lately, ngl. But hey, that's the game, right?

So anyway, I see this setup I've been watching for a while. It's one of those ""if I squint real hard it might just work"" kinda things. On the daily, ETH's been riding this trendline like a champ, and I've got this hunch it's gonna bounce.

Now, I ain't no Nostradamus, but I've got a couple tools in my kit - TradingView for the basics, and this AI agent I stumbled upon called AIQuant for spotting patterns. It's like having an extra set of eyes, y'know?

So I'm sitting there, waiting for the bounce, and boom, it happens. I kid you not, the moment I see the green candle, my heart starts pounding like a drum. I mean, it's one thing to guess it right, but seeing it play out is a whole 'nother thing.

So I'm in. Now, the waiting game begins. And lemme tell ya, nothing, and I mean NOTHING, tests your patience like watching a trade play out. It's like watching paint dry while riding a rollercoaster. 

A few days go by. It's up, it's down. My coffee intake has tripled. I'm a mess but hey, who needs sleep when there's a trade going on, amirite?

Finally, the trade closes. And would you believe it, I actually made a profit. Not a Lambo, but hey, a win's a win. After a week of ups and downs, it felt like crossing the finish line of a marathon.

But here's the thing, this wasn't just about the win. It was about the journey. The patience, the strategy, the tools, the emotional rollercoaster - it's all part of the game. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way.

So there ya have it, folks. My wild ride with ETH. Just goes to show ya, even when the market's brutal, there's always a play to be made. You just gotta have the right tools, a bit of patience, and a whole lotta coffee.

I currently live here with two friends but when our lease ends in a few months they are looking to move but I want to stay because I truly love this apartment!!!

  
Rent will be about **575$ per person**. There's central AC, lots of light, newer furnishings, it's honestly a big steal. Before you get TOO excited, I would really keep in mind why the price is so low, Its very small/close quarters and the walls are on the thin side, plus a small kitchen. The bedrooms both fit a twin sized bed and a desk but not a whole lot else in my opinion, there is a built in closet, not ideal for a maximalist or someone with a hoarding issue. 

The lease will be likely **9 months** (kind of strange ik) , **08/01/2025 thru 05/01/2026**, PERFECT for students, cosigners are accepted :)

It is located in West Pilsen nearish to Douglas Park. It just a block from a Pink line stop, grocery store, and 3-4 major bus lines! The location is awesome. Hence why I want to stay here longer.

The landlord hasn't given me much issue, and is good at replying and fixing things in a timely manor.

Jose awoke promptly at 5:30am, as was his norm, threw on his sweats and PT belt, and went for his morning run. He stopped a few times to talk with some of his neighbors, and then at a Vietnamese bakery that belonged to an old couple who had been in the NML since before it had been named that. After two hours he made it home, ate breakfast, and walked across the back lot to his shop.

The first order of the day was the thugs, no, Rob and Greg‚Äôs, he corrected himself, van. He gave the old thing a once over, then placed his hands on the engine. Soon a purple glow began to emanate from the compartment, and after a few minutes ceased. He checked the oil, transmission fluid, and coolant, then closed the hood. Next up were the tires, a quick glow later and they were almost as good as new; as opposed to the breaks, which were as good as new.

Finally, he crawled under the van to look at the frame. It was bent and had rusty speed holes, as did the drive shaft and exhaust. He extricated himself, grabbed 23.5 pounds of scrap steel from behind the shop, and returned to the van. Laying the scrap under the vehicle, he laid his hands on the individual parts, and began to work. Less than five minutes later, everything was near perfect.

*Only half an hour. I seem to be getting better and better. Last year this would have taken over an hour.* He thought.

Last, he lifted the rear bumper into place and held it there as the purple light did its thing. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs done. Now onward to coffee!‚Äù

\-

Rob and Greg took the city bus into the NML, exiting at the stop across from the mechanic‚Äôs shop. As they got off, the ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù sign in the shops window sprung to life. They dodged traffic as the crossed the street.

‚ÄúWho opens shop at 9am in this place?‚Äù Rob wondered aloud.

‚ÄúObviously this guy.‚Äù Greg responded, coffee in one hand, lox bagel in the other.

As they crossed the shops lot, the overhead door opened, and the van rolled out. The thing didn‚Äôt look any different, the sound‚Ä¶

Greg‚Äôs eyes widened as the van pulled out, ‚ÄúDo you hear that? Nothing! That thing hasn‚Äôt sounded this good ever!‚Äù

Jose stepped out of the van, ‚ÄúYou guys like what you hear? It wasn‚Äôt as bad as I had feared. A couple new valves, plugs, and wires, new oil and other fluids. I even fixed the breaks and threw on some better rubber.‚Äù

Greg and Rob just stared at the man.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say I‚Äôve never had customers speechless before.‚Äù Jose smiled at the men. ‚ÄúAnd since you paid in advance, she‚Äôs all yours. Oh, and that funny vibration in the dash? I fixed that too.‚Äù

\-

Jose dragged the next customers car into the shop. It needed work. Lots of work. If the couple who had brought it in last week hadn‚Äôt been in desperate need, he would have just bought the junker from them to use as parts, but they needed a vehicle, so he had charged them less than half the going rate. 20 minutes of purple light later, it was running like a car ten years younger than it was; he couldn‚Äôt afford to go overboard. Again. The engine was good again, as were all the usual wear spots, aside from cosmetics. He sent the couple a text to come and pick it up tomorrow afternoon, when it would be ‚Äúdone‚Äù.

The next several hours were spent restoring broken parts to factory new condition, lunch, and the ever-needed coffee. Last job of the day, he ordered junker cars from ‚ÄúJunccars.net‚Äù (the best site on the web for parts cars) for delivery later in the week. He figured he would list the ‚ÄúNew Old Stock‚Äù parts online tomorrow. He clicked off the Open sign, and waited for the evening customers to show up.

Monkey in the Middle hopped off the bus across the street from The Mechanic‚Äôs shop, and walked in the back door. ‚ÄúHey M, got a thing I need fixed.‚Äù

The Mechanic looked up from his bench in the back of the shop. ‚ÄúHey Mim. What you got this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt really know. I got it off [Villinay.Net](http://Villinay.Net), some kinda strength booster.‚Äù Mim replied. ‚ÄúIt was slightly damaged from being dropped by Captain Handsome when 808 knocked him out of the sky.‚Äù

‚ÄúI remember that fight!‚Äù Jose said, a smile crossing his face. ‚ÄúI hate that guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost do.‚Äù Mim replied. ‚ÄúAnyway, if you could do your thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou remember the price?‚Äù

‚Äú10K. Direct transfer. No refunds if it doesn‚Äôt do what I think it should do.‚Äù Mim replied with a sigh.

‚ÄúGood! You get the transfer started; I‚Äôll get to work.‚Äù

Mim walked out of the shop, and began transferring the money, and Jose started the fixing. These things were always a bit tricky, they were usually one-off items that weren‚Äôt always sure what they were, or what they were supposed to do, so he took his time. Half an hour later, the device had turned into a pair of arm bracers that hummed with power.

He pinged Mim, and let him back into the shop. ‚ÄúThey seem to be done. When you test them, start on the ‚Äì ‚Äú

‚ÄúLowest setting and get used to them before using them in a caper.‚Äù Mim finished.

‚ÄúYup!‚Äù Jose grinned. ‚ÄúNow I think you should skedaddle, I have another appointment soon.‚Äù

Mim nodded, and slunk out of the area.

\-

Super Soda Pop, or SSP as the news was calling, he now, dropped from the sky onto the unsuspecting warehouse. At almost roof level, she stopped and surveyed the area. *Radio and tv antenna. Junk cars. Three security cameras. Nothing out of the ordinary.* But she still had an uncomfortable feeling in her gut as she dropped to the ground next to the back door of the shop.

A back door that opened before she could reach for the handle. A deep voice from inside announced ‚ÄúCome in Ms. Pop. I‚Äôve been expecting you.‚Äù

\-

‚ÄòPop sat in a comfortable chair across the desk from The Mechanic. He wore his normal outfit, a suit of powered armor built from automotive scraps. Her eyes wandered over the armor, looking for some sort of weakness.

‚ÄúHow may I help you Ms. Pop?‚Äù The Mechanic asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for Monkey in the Middle.‚Äù ‚ÄòPop said, taking a slow look around the office. ‚ÄúI heard from sources that he was here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will neither confirm nor deny the presence of a customer in my shop.‚Äù The Mechanic replied.

‚ÄúI figured as much.‚Äù ‚ÄòPop said. ‚ÄúIf you are unwilling to answer my questions here, would you like to come downtown and answer them in the cells?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know my lawyer will disrupt that before you first words are out of your mouth.‚Äù The Mechanic replied.

‚ÄúThen I guess we‚Äôre at an impasse. I won‚Äôt leave until you give me something.‚Äù ‚ÄòPop shot back, knowing that the lawyer from DC&H would be a major thorn if she took him to detention for questioning.

‚ÄúHow about I clean all your equipment for free?‚Äù The Mechanic asked.

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù She glared at him through hooded eyes. ‚ÄúYou know that‚Äôs NOT how this works.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course I do.‚Äù The Mechanic chuckled from beneath his mask. ‚ÄúBut seeing you flustered is so much fun, Ms. Pop.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did Monkey want?‚Äù ‚ÄòPop raised her voice.

‚ÄúYou will have to be more specific, Ms. Pop. There are several villains, and a hero with some variation of that name.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, Jose, you are being frustrating! There‚Äôs no point to it.‚Äù ‚ÄòPop raised her voice some more.

Jose turned off the voice modulator in his helmet, ‚ÄúAll jokes and snide comments aside, I can‚Äôt break trust with my customers. You know that. Should I blab to someone what your chest size is? I know what it is from the last time I had to fix your breastplate.‚Äù

‚ÄòPop exhaled dramatically, and slouched in her chair. ‚ÄúI know, I know. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve been chasing the brat around town for most of the week, and mom wants me there for Sunday brunch, and I can‚Äôt show up tired. Again.‚Äù

Jose took off his helmet, and looked the teen in the eyes, ‚ÄúI get that. I just can‚Äôt tell you anything, my lawyer would skin me alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you get a dedicated lawyer from DC&H, anyway?‚Äù ‚ÄòPop asked. ‚ÄúThat kind of treatment is reserved for the best of the best.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, easy. I fixed Mr. Howe‚Äôs car for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Bently? He has a dedicated guy for that.‚Äù ‚ÄòPop said. ‚ÄúPull the other one, it‚Äôs got bells on.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot that one. The 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Z06.‚Äù Jose said, smiling.

‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶how‚Ä¶ WTF MAN!‚Äù ‚ÄòPop shot into the air. ‚ÄúHow did you get the parts?!?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have my ways.‚Äù Jose winked at her. ‚ÄúAnd I am ‚ÄúThe Mechanic‚Äù, you know.‚Äù

With that, Super Soda Pop stormed out of the shop, slamming the door so hard that it fell off. Jose sighed, ‚ÄúIf she had punched me, I would have spilled my guts! I‚Äôm glad she‚Äôs a car freak.‚Äù He fixed the door, and tottered off to bed.

\*-\*-\*

I will eventually put a link to the first part. Honest! (LOLOLOL)

  
I am only partly sure of why I like this character the most. I think it's because while he is mercenary, he doesn't overcharge, and for most folks, undercharges, he does the ""right"" thing according to his principles.¬†

That and of all the powers there are in this world, I want this one the most. Not just for the money I could make, but for the help I could give to people. Busted car? No problem! Fried electronics? Got that covered! Burned down home? I can fix that!

Utility powers are the best!!!",10,1746291084.0,HFY,4,0.92,False
1kdxeqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/korea/comments/1kdxeqg/looking_for_electronics_overstock_bstock/,"Looking for Electronics Overstock / B-Stock Suppliers (Samsung, LG) in Korea ‚Äì Export","
Hello! 

I‚Äôm looking for wholesale suppliers or contacts in South Korea who deal with electronics overstock, B-grade items, or returns ‚Äì especially from major brands like Samsung and LG.

I run a resale business in Dubai (UAE) and also operate a warehouse in Germany. My goal is to export stock from Korea to the UAE, focusing on TVs, monitors, smartphones, household appliances, and similar items, also barista coffee machines.

If you know:

Any reliable contacts or companies who sell returns/B-stock

Export-ready suppliers in Yongsan Electronics Market or elsewhere in Korea

Or if you‚Äôre in the business and open to a conversation


‚Ä¶please feel free to DM me or comment below. I‚Äôm open to building long-term partnerships and can handle logistics, payment, and documentation professionally.

Thanks so much in advance!",2,1746291006.0,korea,0,1.0,False

i go to the library a lot but felt like i shouldn't bother anyone, even when i'd really wanna talk to them, to respect their time reading/studying or whatever. and i feel like the same thing applies to people at a coffee shop? people be like ""cafes"" but are you just supposed to go up to someone working in a starbucks and initiate a whole conversation with them?? is that not kinda weird??? or is my socially anxious ass just tripping?

i just don't know where/when would it be appropriate to go up to someone and start a conversation ... and also maybe how. and it feels impossible with girls because there's always that connotation of romantic interest when approaching them so then i'd feel like i could come off as a creep. i'm not a super shy person, i'm generally an ambivert but i have my days where i just cant do anything social. so it's not like this is *just* for the assignment either, i'd want to be able to genuinely be comfortable approaching people anyway. 

methods? plz? ;\_;",1,1746290906.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

1kdxcld,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdxcld,2 night bike-packing wild camping trip around the Lake District,"I‚Äôve just got pack from a big tour of the Lake District on my bike! I covered about 280km in 3 days. I started in Cark in the South and visitted a lot of the big lakes, Coniston, Elter Water, the tip of Windermere, Rydal Water, Grasmere, Thirlmere, Derwent Water, Bassenthwaite, Buttermere, Crummock Water, Loweswater and Ennerdale Water I finished back at Cark again after a ride down the coast(ish). I planned to take a more coast-hugging route back and to go further but my legs were too tired so I took a more direct route back. 

Unlike when I‚Äôm hiking, I had to camp relatively close to the roads but I found the quietest spots I could and practised my stealth camping skills to ensure I bothered nobody. I pitched late and left early and took away as much of other people‚Äôs litter as I could. It‚Äôs sad how much crap has been strewn around our lovely lakes and lowlands. I was outraged every 5 to 10 minutes by what I saw. 

Weather was spectacular, Thursday was hot as hell though and I nearly died getting to the top of Honister Pass but the cafe at the top fed me a sausage and bacon sandwich and so by the healing powers of pork, I was rejuvenated. 

I camped with my ultralight poncho/tarp and bug bivi setup, the midges were about but not in full force. 

My secret weapon was bringing my hammock. I didn‚Äôt camp in it but I took a couple of rests in the hottest parts of the day for an hour or so. Having a total relax was very rejuvenating and kept me going. I ate mostly at pubs and cafes, I only took a cured sausage and a handful of nutty bars by way of food plus some vitamin/cafiene soluble tablets to substitute for my morning coffee.

All in all, a great trip. Gonna get a bath now and reward myself with a few beers and a pizza. ",26,1746290848.0,wildcampingintheuk,5,1.0,False

* Squad car vehicle: When the enemy uses a weapon, gains x damage/shield and haste. Switches between damage and shielding every second giving the impression of police lights.
* Police station property: Not too sure on this one, maybe destroys enemy items as though they are locked up.
* Donut: Healing food item that scales on haste.
* Coffee: Hastes adjacent items and charges them instead of they are food for some built in synergy with donut.
* Handcuffs: Tool that freezes.
* Riot shotgun: Weapon that slows instead of dealing damage.

1kdxauk,https://www.reddit.com/r/oilandgasworkers/comments/1kdxauk/are_there_any_offshore_oil_riggscompanies_that/,Are there any offshore Oil Riggs/Companies that hire internationally with no experience?,"After I graduate this year I‚Äôm hoping to get a job such as a roustabout and work my way up on an offshore rig and work there for a few years to earn money for studies.
My end goal is to be a pilot.

I was wondering which rigs might hire me if any? 

I currently work at a butchery and will be working at a cafe/coffee shop as a second job in a couple of weeks, though I doubt that will count for anything on my resume.

I like the idea of doing the hard labor because I know it will pay off one day, and like being physically fit. I know it‚Äôs a hard, difficult, taxing job and I look forward it. Being away from family is not a problem.

I can‚Äôt find much information on which companies hire internationally. I‚Äôm from South Africa so if I were to work for a South African rig the pay would be horrendous unfortunately and would only be a waste of time that I don‚Äôt have. The only way I‚Äôll make anything worth while is If I earn in dollars or euros.

Also I‚Äôm a woman so that might sabotage my prospects

Any info is helpful, please and thank you ü´∂

I've always had trouble following instructions for physical tasks (cooking, using a coffee machine, driving lessons), so maybe these instructions are plenty but is this a normal amount of guidance for a lesson?

I assumed it would be more technical and I'd have more guidelines about what I'm doing and why and how it asks the horse to move etc.

Are there any youtube channels or visual guides I can look at in between lessons? I almost want like a picture of what I'm looking like to be taken and then for that to be compared against what I should be doing. 

Just nervous I don't want to annoy the horse with what I'm doing!

I am a bit stuck with dialling in (bit of a novice). Finally reached this level of set up, previously had figured out the pressurised basket but it was right on the edge of the espresso settings on the grinder so wasn't making the most of it, hence got a depressurised basket (I was on setting between 18-20). Coffee is clearly already way better and I started with a setting of 15 but now I feel a bit stuck... I'm currently weighing in about 18-19g on setting 15 and pulling shots at about 20secs give or take 2 secs (from first drop). I can't tell anymore if it's too sour or bitter, feels like a mix, which supposedly is channeling but I use the distributor and the tamper so not sure what more I can do... feeling a bit demotivated because I'm struggled to dial in any further. Changing either dose / grind setting doesn't seem to be making any logical difference, it seems almost random how the shot turns out :( 

The beans I am using are pretty light roast tbh so I don't know if I should maybe not be running a 1:2 ratio. 

Would appreciate any guidance. I have looked at the beginners manual but I feel there are too many variables for me to figure out which to focus on. ",1,1746290251.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1kdx1t0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1kdx1t0/poker_for_combat/,poker for combat?,"Has this been tried before?

I was just having my coffee and this idea sprang to mind. 5 card draw for combat and you get one round of asking for cards, and if your hand beats the monster's hand you hit. 

This probably bogs down combat way too much. But I liked the idea of you getting more control over your roll, yet still has luck involved. 

now poker was my original idea because you can beat a opponent's hand by degrees so say you get critical damage if you beat the hand by 2 hand values higher.  Monster has a pair, so if you had 3 of a kind would be normal damage, but if you had a straight+ you would do critical damage. 

Then I was thinking maybe Blackjack would be a better system,  adding a push your luck element. The monster being the dealer, you need to beat. In this system I was thinking maybe the monsters get one deck and the heroes get their own deck, and the cards aren't reset and shuffled until after the whole combat encounter is over. So their strength/stamina deplete over time, and that gives you more information if you get all your face cards early in combat. You beat the dealer you score a hit, dealer beats you the monster blocks and if you bust the monster hits you. 

Since these are gambling games maybe you could add in a betting element. Maybe characters can bet their gear, they do extra damage or get an extra action if they win, but if they lose their equipment breaks or malfunctions in some way. 

Besides the likely outcome of this being too clunky and slow, what do you think?

# I Was Exhausted, Mentally and Physically ‚Äì Until MITOLYN

Before I found **MITOLYN**, my life felt like it was slipping through my fingers. I‚Äôm a 42-year-old professional with a family, a career, and what should be a vibrant life. But I felt **tired all the time**. No matter how much I slept, I woke up feeling like I hadn‚Äôt rested at all. I couldn‚Äôt focus at work. My motivation was gone. My workouts felt pointless. Even spending time with my kids became a struggle.

Doctors told me everything looked ""normal"" in my labs. But I knew something was wrong.

Then, late one night while searching for answers online, I stumbled upon **MITOLYN** ‚Äì a supplement designed to **revitalize mitochondrial function**, the powerhouse of every cell in your body. I was skeptical. I‚Äôve tried dozens of supplements over the years, and nothing ever made a difference. But something about MITOLYN was different.

What caught my attention was **scientific backing**. The creators of MITOLYN aren‚Äôt just marketers ‚Äì they‚Äôre experts in cellular health and anti-aging science. The formula includes powerful ingredients like **Urolithin A, NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), PQQ, CoQ10, and Resveratrol**, all clinically studied to improve mitochondrial health, reduce inflammation, and restore cellular energy.

I figured I had nothing to lose‚Ä¶ so I ordered my first bottle.

# The First 7 Days ‚Äì Noticeable Energy Shift

By day three, I noticed I was waking up feeling just a little bit *lighter*. My brain fog began to lift. I wasn‚Äôt chugging 3 cups of coffee by noon anymore.

By day seven, the difference was **impossible to ignore**. I had energy. Not the jittery kind you get from energy drinks ‚Äì this was real, steady, sustainable energy. I felt **alive** in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.

My productivity at work soared. I even started jogging again, something I hadn‚Äôt done in months. MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just give me energy ‚Äì it gave me **hope**.

# By Week 4 ‚Äì I Got My Life Back

I can‚Äôt overstate this: MITOLYN gave me **my life back**. After 30 days, I felt **10 years younger**. I was waking up refreshed. My mental clarity was razor sharp. My skin looked healthier. My digestion improved. My mood lifted.

The chronic inflammation and ‚Äúdrag‚Äù that had haunted me for years seemed to **melt away**.

Even my wife noticed the changes ‚Äì not just in my energy, but in my confidence, my happiness, my presence as a father and partner.

# Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

What sets MITOLYN apart isn‚Äôt just its ingredient list ‚Äì it‚Äôs the **synergistic formula** and **absorption technology**. Many supplements throw together popular buzzwords but don‚Äôt deliver results. MITOLYN uses **bioavailable forms** of each compound, meaning your body actually absorbs and uses the nutrients.

Each capsule is packed with potent, clean, and clinically researched ingredients that:

‚úÖ **Boost mitochondrial regeneration**  
‚úÖ **Support ATP (energy) production**  
‚úÖ **Reduce oxidative stress and cellular aging**  
‚úÖ **Improve brain function and memory**  
‚úÖ **Enhance cardiovascular and metabolic health**

This is not a gimmick. It‚Äôs not a temporary caffeine fix. MITOLYN works **from the cellular level up** ‚Äì addressing the **root cause** of fatigue, brain fog, and early aging.

# Real People, Real Results ‚Äì I‚Äôm Not Alone

After joining a MITOLYN Facebook support group, I realized something powerful: **thousands of people were experiencing the same transformation**. From tired moms to aging professionals to fitness enthusiasts ‚Äì MITOLYN was restoring lives everywhere.

I read stories of people recovering from burnout, reversing age-related decline, and feeling youthful again ‚Äì all thanks to this one product. That gave me even more confidence that MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just hype ‚Äì it‚Äôs the **real deal**.

# Safe, Natural, and Backed by Science

Another reason I trust MITOLYN is its **purity and transparency**. It‚Äôs manufactured in an **FDA-registered**, **GMP-certified facility** in the USA, with **no artificial fillers, no gluten, and no GMOs**. You can actually scan the barcode and see the lab results.

And they offer a **100% satisfaction guarantee**. That means if you don‚Äôt feel a dramatic improvement in your energy and focus, you can get your money back. No hassle.

But trust me: you won‚Äôt be asking for a refund.

# Who Should Use MITOLYN?

If you:

* Feel tired even after a full night‚Äôs sleep
* Struggle with focus, memory, or motivation
* Experience chronic stress or mental burnout
* Want to slow down aging from the inside out
* Are dealing with inflammation, weight gain, or metabolic issues
* Want to support your heart, brain, and cellular health long-term

Then **MITOLYN is for you**.

# Final Verdict ‚Äì Buy It Now Before It Sells Out

MITOLYN is not just another supplement ‚Äì it‚Äôs a **life-changer**. I‚Äôve already stocked up on 6 bottles because I never want to go back to feeling like I used to.

I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say this: **MITOLYN should be in every medicine cabinet**. It‚Äôs the closest thing to a ‚Äúcellular reset‚Äù I‚Äôve ever experienced. It gave me back my energy, my focus, and my joy. And it might just do the same for you.

Don‚Äôt waste years searching for solutions that don‚Äôt work. **Start with the one that does.** MITOLYN is in high demand, and it sells out fast ‚Äì so if it‚Äôs in stock right now, grab it.

You owe it to yourself ‚Äì and your future ‚Äì to try MITOLYN.

**Update: 3 Months Later ‚Äì Still Going Strong!**

I‚Äôve now been taking MITOLYN for over 3 months, and the benefits have only compounded. I‚Äôve lost 12 pounds without even trying. My blood pressure is better. My mood is stable. And I genuinely look forward to each day with purpose and energy.

MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just restore my health. It restored my **freedom**.

If you're still on the fence, I get it. But just try one bottle. Just one. You‚Äôll feel the shift ‚Äì and you‚Äôll never look back.",1,1746289733.0,DiagnosisNetflix,1,1.0,False

But I felt **tired all the time**. No matter how much I slept, I woke up feeling like I hadn‚Äôt rested at all. I couldn‚Äôt focus at work. My motivation was gone. My workouts felt pointless. Even spending time with my kids became a struggle.

Doctors told me everything looked ""normal"" in my labs. But I knew something was wrong.

Then, late one night while searching for answers online, I stumbled upon **MITOLYN** ‚Äì a supplement designed to **revitalize mitochondrial function**, the powerhouse of every cell in your body. I was skeptical. I‚Äôve tried dozens of supplements over the years, and nothing ever made a difference. But something about MITOLYN was different.

What caught my attention was **scientific backing**. The creators of MITOLYN aren‚Äôt just marketers ‚Äì they‚Äôre experts in cellular health and anti-aging science. The formula includes powerful ingredients like **Urolithin A, NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), PQQ, CoQ10, and Resveratrol**, all clinically studied to improve mitochondrial health, reduce inflammation, and restore cellular energy.

I figured I had nothing to lose‚Ä¶ so I ordered my first bottle.

# The First 7 Days ‚Äì Noticeable Energy Shift

By day three, I noticed I was waking up feeling just a little bit *lighter*. My brain fog began to lift. I wasn‚Äôt chugging 3 cups of coffee by noon anymore.

By day seven, the difference was **impossible to ignore**. I had energy. Not the jittery kind you get from energy drinks ‚Äì this was real, steady, sustainable energy. I felt **alive** in a way I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.

My productivity at work soared. I even started jogging again, something I hadn‚Äôt done in months. MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just give me energy ‚Äì it gave me **hope**.

# By Week 4 ‚Äì I Got My Life Back

I can‚Äôt overstate this: MITOLYN gave me **my life back**. After 30 days, I felt **10 years younger**. I was waking up refreshed. My mental clarity was razor sharp. My skin looked healthier. My digestion improved. My mood lifted.

The chronic inflammation and ‚Äúdrag‚Äù that had haunted me for years seemed to **melt away**.

Even my wife noticed the changes ‚Äì not just in my energy, but in my confidence, my happiness, my presence as a father and partner.

# Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

What sets MITOLYN apart isn‚Äôt just its ingredient list ‚Äì it‚Äôs the **synergistic formula** and **absorption technology**. Many supplements throw together popular buzzwords but don‚Äôt deliver results. MITOLYN uses **bioavailable forms** of each compound, meaning your body actually absorbs and uses the nutrients.

Each capsule is packed with potent, clean, and clinically researched ingredients that:

‚úÖ **Boost mitochondrial regeneration**  
‚úÖ **Support ATP (energy) production**  
‚úÖ **Reduce oxidative stress and cellular aging**  
‚úÖ **Improve brain function and memory**  
‚úÖ **Enhance cardiovascular and metabolic health**

This is not a gimmick. It‚Äôs not a temporary caffeine fix. MITOLYN works **from the cellular level up** ‚Äì addressing the **root cause** of fatigue, brain fog, and early aging.

# Real People, Real Results ‚Äì I‚Äôm Not Alone

After joining a MITOLYN Facebook support group, I realized something powerful: **thousands of people were experiencing the same transformation**. From tired moms to aging professionals to fitness enthusiasts ‚Äì MITOLYN was restoring lives everywhere.

I read stories of people recovering from burnout, reversing age-related decline, and feeling youthful again ‚Äì all thanks to this one product. That gave me even more confidence that MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just hype ‚Äì it‚Äôs the **real deal**.

# Safe, Natural, and Backed by Science

Another reason I trust MITOLYN is its **purity and transparency**. It‚Äôs manufactured in an **FDA-registered**, **GMP-certified facility** in the USA, with **no artificial fillers, no gluten, and no GMOs**. You can actually scan the barcode and see the lab results.

And they offer a **100% satisfaction guarantee**. That means if you don‚Äôt feel a dramatic improvement in your energy and focus, you can get your money back. No hassle.

But trust me: you won‚Äôt be asking for a refund.

# Who Should Use MITOLYN?

If you:

* Feel tired even after a full night‚Äôs sleep
* Struggle with focus, memory, or motivation
* Experience chronic stress or mental burnout
* Want to slow down aging from the inside out
* Are dealing with inflammation, weight gain, or metabolic issues
* Want to support your heart, brain, and cellular health long-term

Then **MITOLYN is for you**.

# Final Verdict ‚Äì Buy It Now Before It Sells Out

MITOLYN is not just another supplement ‚Äì it‚Äôs a **life-changer**. I‚Äôve already stocked up on 6 bottles because I never want to go back to feeling like I used to.

I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say this: **MITOLYN should be in every medicine cabinet**. It‚Äôs the closest thing to a ‚Äúcellular reset‚Äù I‚Äôve ever experienced. It gave me back my energy, my focus, and my joy. And it might just do the same for you.

Don‚Äôt waste years searching for solutions that don‚Äôt work. **Start with the one that does.** MITOLYN is in high demand, and it sells out fast ‚Äì so if it‚Äôs in stock right now, grab it.

You owe it to yourself ‚Äì and your future ‚Äì to try MITOLYN.

**Update: 3 Months Later ‚Äì Still Going Strong!**

I‚Äôve now been taking MITOLYN for over 3 months, and the benefits have only compounded. I‚Äôve lost 12 pounds without even trying. My blood pressure is better. My mood is stable. And I genuinely look forward to each day with purpose and energy.

MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just restore my health. It restored my **freedom**.

If you're still on the fence, I get it. But just try one bottle. Just one. You‚Äôll feel the shift ‚Äì and you‚Äôll never look back.",1,1746289723.0,DiagnosisNetflix,1,1.0,False
1kdwxdq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kdwxdq,Goat milk soap help,"We started making goat milk soap from our own goats. We freeze it and then use it from its frozen form when we add the lye. 

Our scents are oat & honey, lavender, coffee and a naked bar with nothing extra, which it‚Äôs not pictured. 

The soap doesn‚Äôt come out white. Is that normal? When we freeze the milk it turns slightly yellow, but I‚Äôve read this is the best way so that the lye doesn‚Äôt cook the soap and turn it orange. 

Also working on presentation as this is our first time but we‚Äôre also trying to keep it with a natural farmhouse type look. So nothing too fancy but also not too plain. I have a new idea for the lavender that I‚Äôll try next time.

- lye 2oz

- olive oil 5oz
- vegetable oil 6oz

1kdwwtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kdwwtp/i_think_i_have_damaged_my_relationship_with_a/,"I think I have damaged my relationship with a friend, and they seem to be preparing to discard me. Looking for perspectives and how in the wrong I was.","I made a friend late last year during a very tough period in both of our lives. I was in a DV situation at the time and ended up in a Psych ward, where I was helped to get out of the situation. I met this person in the ward as a patient and we seemed to get along really well. The friendship has gone on for 7 months now.

We were always fairly open about discussing things normally, but at times they wanted me to be covert about what they do for work (sex work), especially in front of roommates. I never spoke about it openly in front of others, but sometimes, when they talked about their work (covertly) while we were in the loungeroom and their roommates were in their bedrooms, I might use a term that wasn't very covert (sex workers, beds etc.). 

Last night they had left their journal (with work stuff in it) on the coffee table and we're worried their housemates had read it. After that we started chatting, they showed me some photos of their workplace and talked about their work and relationships and such (roommates were in bed) and I used the term ""sex workers"" in conversation without thinking, I suppose because I felt we were alone.

After that, we went outside to discuss things. They spoke kindly to me, asked what I needed. They said that I had ""outed"" them, though and that they will probably move out of their place now to live in another city. I asked if we would stay in contact, they didn't answer directly, but implied that we wouldn't.

I sent an apology. Now they are sending me the contacts of mutual friends (trying up loose ends I guess) and acting very distant but cordial. They left something in my car that I need to meet them to return tomorrow and I feel like it will be awkward. At this point

I can't tell if I am in the wrong or not. Or how in the wrong I am.

There are some things that I think are relevant.

.They recently told their housemates that I thought one of the housemate's straight friends was attractive without asking me if it was ok (I am a gay man).

.They have had a lot of falling outs with friends and family in the past. They have several friend groups blocked on Instagram. 

. They have been diagnosed with BPD, but they believe they were misdiagnosed.

.If I'm being honest, I have been bothered by their habit of judging people based on their physical appearance in the past, and value themselves for their beauty. I did bring it up to some degree by letting them know it made me feel insecure.  

I feel like I'd just like to step away from the friendship at this point, even if they change their mind, but I'm worried I will make similar mistakes in other friendships and screw them up as well, as I am trying to become more involved in the queer community. 

How bad was what I did?

How can I avoid doing it again in the future? 

Any advice is appreciated.

I try to make myself presentable but I guess I‚Äôm not the prettiest person (definitely not a swamp creature either). I‚Äôm like 5‚Äô10, blonde, blue eyes, around 170lbs.

I‚Äôm only saying this bc I‚Äôve noticed a lot of moms in my area are beautiful, always put together, and I‚Äôm more plain with black leggings and a hoodie kinda thing. 

I feel like perhaps I‚Äôm only a little boring? The only hobbies I truly have are hiking, long walks, The Sims 4, plants, and books. I don‚Äôt know much about American pop culture so I know that takes me out of some conversations. I also feel like because I assume people don‚Äôt like me maybe I‚Äôm acting off or weird?

However, since August 2024, It started getting more frequent. I think it was exacerbated by stress and anxiety as I have been very stressed and anxious since August 2024 to this day. My symptoms are acid reflux, nausea, headache (very bad), belching when I have active reflux. Heartburn is not that common, happens once in a while but I do feel that burn sensation sometimes in my throat when belching. I do not have any pain in my stomach but I do feel a burning sensation. It goes away by itself.

I visited a gastro around mid-march and he put me on Somopraz 40 mg with Amitriptyline 10 mg (for a month) as I was having trouble sleeping due to anxiety. He did not ask me to taper the dosage but I did try to taper it as per my understanding. I have been off of Sompraz for a week now. I changed my lifestyle as well. Not lying down after meals, sleeping on the left side, walk after every meal, workout 4 days a week. I also do not consume tea, coffee, alcohol, or any processed food. However, my symptoms have returned now. I get that burning sensation, my appetite has reduced, I feel satiated after eating very little, it feels live food is sititng right at the centre of my chest. I have not got any heartburn yet. That acidic belch has occurred twice in one week. My bloodwork was all normal, ultrasound was normal. I got food intolerance test done and am allergic to only cheese and carrots.

I am very scared now that I can see the symptoms return. Could it just be rebound acid or could it be something serious? Should I get endoscopy done? I feel very scared and hopeless.

Dear Future Partner Who Knows How to Makes Me Leave My Couch and gets me stuck in traffic worth it,


Here‚Äôs what life taught me ‚Äî sometimes the hard way, sometimes through bad dates, questionable decisions, and a lot of coffee (ok I lied... soju or whiskey not coffee) -fueled epiphanies:
I am a whole person - not just a face, boobs or whatever body part or a friggin personality. I am a complete person with dark humor, who sings loudly even when out of key. I am someone always at the opposite ends of the pole... with complex personality and emotions. A person made up of traumas, walls, and craziness. I am not ""too much""... I am just right and enough. Plus points if you try to figure me out one quirky moment at a time.

I deserve flowers for no reason, hype-up texts before big meetings, and forehead kisses. I like the you reading stories and the times you just sing or play for me... I like being randomly twirled after getting off the escalator or even when we're just walking (I dun even care if others are looking) yes, I'm that kind of cheesy and I‚Äôm not sorry. 

I am selectively social- so you better be worth leaving my couch for or getting stuck in traffic to just meet you.  I learned that loving me comes with side effects, including: excessive laughter, deep conversations at 2 AM, occasional mood swings, and random clinginess. I‚Äôm not asking for a knight in shining armor ‚Äîjust someone who can handle deep talks, grocery shopping, and me when I‚Äôm on my third cup of coffee still not fine talking. I just need you to be in my corner rooting for me. Okay, you can go help me but like be my support just leave the tanking and DPS-ing to me. As I said I am selectively social I do not open up to anyone. I do not get comfy with anyone. My walls and guard is always up and if you fine me talking a lot, I choose to spend time with you, I make time for you, please know that you are friggin special. And if I say ""I'm yours""  I am really yours. No distractions, no comparisons. I'd choose you every single day. Even when times gets tough or even when you're being difficult. Ride or die. 

I have been told that people took me for granted cause I'm always available and that I always adjust. I've been told that I give everything (almost everything);and I make the effort. I know that all too well. The thing is I can't change the way how I show that person how important he is to me but no mistake cause the moment I stop caring that's the end of it. When things change I can catch on easily. I could look the other way and weather it out with you. Or leave without you knowing why or when I started to stop caring. I won't beg, instead I'll find my peace.

And if you're reading this ‚Äî you, the one who would stay-know that I‚Äôll give you a love that is ride or die, funny, a little weird, stubborn in all the right ways, and patient enough to binge-watch shows with you (even when you fall asleep halfway through every episode or grind a silly MMORPG). But also know:
I will steal your hoodie. I will finish your fries. I will sing badly in the car. And I will love you in a way that I know how.

And to me ‚Äî the woman who knows her worth, who kept her softness even when life told her to harden up ‚Äî
You‚Äôre the real MVP.
I love you ü©∑.

The covers were people's faces in shadow with blues and purples I think? It's set in a college town and maybe there's a coffee shop everyone visits/the main character works at? I'm pretty sure the first one started with a human girl getting almost attacked at a frat party and she escapes to the house where all the vampires are living and they protect her (you need permission to enter if you're not a vampire yourself? Something about the entrance rule relies on the vampire/human status or the house owner). There's an enemies to lovers with the girl and one of the vampires in the house and maybe a love triangle with another mythical creature. The main character gets turned into a vampire eventually. It was a little bit more mature YA with swearing and some sexual content. The author was an older woman.,1,1746289322.0,whatsthatbook,0,0.67,False
1kdwrqk,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1kdwrqk/longest_episode_yet/,Longest episode yet,"I'm writing coz I need to vent and hopefully it helps. I did a relatively good job these last three weeks, so hopefully this kills it for some time, before it emerges again - coz of course it effin will.

I‚Äôve known my LO for about 30 years. We met in high school, and from the beginning, there was something between us that set her apart from other friends in my life. At the time, I wasn‚Äôt consciously in love with her, but we formed a deep, trusting bond, especially during a time when she was going through turmoil with her then-boyfriend, who later became her husband. I was there for her in a way that created a kind of emotional blueprint for us: I was the confidant, the one who offered comfort, perspective, and support.

I kind of lost contact with her and her boyfriend/husband after high school, with lives taking us in different directions, but we rekindled our friendship 15 years ago, so you could say our friendship survived the test of time, marriages, careers, and children on their part. But it also became complicated for me. Throughout my adult life, even as I‚Äôve built a loving and committed marriage, LO has remained an emotional presence that‚Äôs difficult to fully define. I‚Äôve never acted on these feelings physically, and I‚Äôve always held fidelity as a core value. But emotionally, the pull toward her has been a recurring undercurrent in my life and sometimes it‚Äôs been overwhelming.

The most recent limerent episode began last spring. LO and I had been spending more time together in our friend group and I was reminded again of all the qualities in her that have always drawn me in: her warmth, humor, intelligence, subtle affection toward me. On top of that, there‚Äôs a physical attraction to the point that when I see a woman physically resembling LO I'm automatically attracted to that woman.  
What made this episode particularly intense was that it coincided with a rough patch in my own life. I‚Äôve had some family issues and my work had taken a major hit, leaving me anxious and destabilized ‚Äî and during that time, I revisited old memories and attachments, including my connection to LO. That emotional vulnerability poured fuel on the fire.

But it's not just about physical attraction. She‚Äôs married, I‚Äôm married, and yet I‚Äôve always felt this deeper pull toward her. Part of that comes from our shared history, part of it is my own internal wiring which was shaped by a chaotic childhood with an alcoholic father, emotionally distant mother, a lifelong craving for validation and financial stability, and a deep drive to be the white knight for all the emotionally guarded women I‚Äôve met along the way.  
This ties into my LO because despite her outward warmth, she has a notable emotional guardedness. Her childhood, though financially stable, was emotionally complicated: a strict and sometimes abusive mother, a distant father, and an unstable brother. Over time, my LO has developed an approach to life that largely avoids emotional confrontation and depth. She prefers calm, control, and surface stability, even when cracks are clearly visible. This is especially frustrating for me, as I crave emotional openness and depth. I like to get to the bone of things. With her, when things get too intimate or intense, there‚Äôs often a subtle but clear retreat and she pulls back into herself.

The longevity of this episode has brought me down so for the past three weeks, I've leaned into a sort of an internal ""scorched earth"" strategy where I pushed myself as close as possible to LO, without jeopardizing our marriages. I did this to test the limits of that closeness, to see if pushing up against her emotional boundaries would either break through them or burn out my limerence. I saw her multiple times one-on-one and from my perspective, it seemed as if she was working from her side to keep these meeting just between us and not involve our partners. We shared moments of warmth, conversation, and physical closeness. There were long hugs, light touches, dancing, inside jokes. I even dropped by her office unexpectedly with cookies and met her for coffee. We shared an intimate walk on the cemetery. And yet, she's emotionally stunted and when there was a moment where you'd think she'd let her guard down, she retreated behind her tall, cold walls.  
Now, by the end of this, I'm emotionally drained. The scorched earth strategy worked. I've killed not just my limerent emotions, but all emotion and I feel like I'm coming out of a house that's burned down.  
And I feel guilt and I feel like I've been found out because I've never pushed this hard. And I pushed this hard, because this was the longest effing episode in the past 30 years.

I dunno‚Ä¶ hate this. I can‚Äôt tell my wife, and I feel like my closest friends wouldn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm equally dreading and looking forward to the moment when I get through this episode, because I know there‚Äôll be another in the near future.",3,1746289279.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

1kdwq9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1kdwq9h/nainggit_ako_sa_lovelife_ng_kawork_ko_pt2/,Nainggit ako sa lovelife ng kawork ko pt2,"So kanina yung unit blessing nila sa Manda. Selected peeps lang yung ininvite nila so including them, mga 6 lang kami. Ang warm ng pag welcome nila samin. I was shocked kase 2 lang kaming ininvite ni kawork sa unit blessing nila. 

Sa sala nila, meron dun collage ng photos nila since day 1 till nabili nila yung condo unit nila. Then this month sila mag 7 years and plan nilang mag Palawan. Lahat inarrange ng partner ni kawork and nag kwentuhan kami dun. After ng prayer, nag kainan na kami. Then dun na namin nakilala yung best friend ng partner ni kawork na nag kwento about their relationship. Isa rin pala siya sa mga nainggit sa relationship nila and OMG out of nowhere bigla nalang akong napasabi na ""OMG same here! Super fan and inggit talaga ako! Perp inggit is a strong and nega word so we should use inspired instead of inggit"" then the couple laughed hard kase nagulat daw sila sa reaction ko pati si best friend nagulat like as if parang magagalit daw ako sa reaction ko sa sinabi niya. Natawa nalang kaming 6 dun. 

Then nag kwento sila kung pano naging sila. Si kawork pala yung nagparamdam sa partner niya for 8 months then naging sila. Si partner ni kawork naman is sobrang nainlove kay kawork and from there, inalagaan talaga niya ng husto si kaworkmate namin. Super chill lang nila as in. Hindi naman daw perfect yung relationship nila. There are times na they fight pero later on, okay na sila then kanya kanyang bawi na. They don't usually think of themselves but they will think of their partners feelings first. Iba talaga! Super matured nila as in. 

May isang friend nila na nag ask about open relationship pero ayaw nila and never nilang napag usapan yun. Very open to each other. Alam nila pw ng soc med accounts and yung sa phone perp they don't check it kase nandun yung trust nila sa isat isa. And open sila sa both parents nila. I asked if plan ba nilang magadopt or magpa surrogate And yes meron pero soon kase they have to save up and to make sure na may enough savings sila para sa future ng magiging anak nila. 

Medyo nag melt ako sa kanila kase magkatabi na nga lang sila naka holding hands pa and ang lambing. Ito yung couple na makikita mo na never kang mauumay talaga i swear to God. Then itong si best friend ng partner ni kawork is nag ask if I'm taken ba raw. Then sumagot si kawork na single nga raw ako and just patiently waiting lang. Then tuloy parin yung kwentuhan namin 6. 

Nag aya nang umuwi yung friend namin ni kawork then sumunod narin yung iba. Nag coffee pa kami ng friend namin then i told him na super bihira lang yung ganyang ssr (same sex rel) na tumatagal. Tho yung akin naman is 8 years kami ng ex ko Pero na fall out of love kami so we both decided na to end it nalang. Pero sana hindi sila mag sawa pareho and i pray na sila na talaga.

Yes! Inggit is a strong and negative word. I won't deny that. Pero for me, siguro naging totoo lang din ako. And let's admit, minsan meron din tayong ""sana ako rin"" moment sa buhay natin. Hay. I know may darating din para satin. Chill lang tayo. üòä",0,1746289163.0,phlgbt,0,0.5,False

Not intermittently, no CICO or anything. FASTING. Only eating Wed, Fri, & Sunday. Meat, salt, eggs, some dairy. Some mornings on eating days I have coffee or tea with honey & half n half. Fasting days I just have water with electrolytes. Everyday I supplement with Lugol‚Äôs Solution iodine. 

First month stats: started at 155lbs (5‚Äô8 F early 40‚Äôs) ate everyday as stated above, (did not have honey), and exercised. Had some treats at a wedding. Three pounds down. No visible changes other than my facial skin looks and feels better. (Side note): I was already living the lectin free lifestyle for a while, so the transition was easy! I didn‚Äôt have any bathroom attacks or anything. Was kinda disappointed how not much changed on the outside, but it helped to be reminded here that fat adaptation and healing takes place within. Thanks everyone for sharing your advice, ect.

2nd month stats: (only four days into it now) and I‚Äôm at 149lbs : ) goal is getting back to 136lbs. The areas that I‚Äôm trying to improve are my thighs and hip dips. Those have always been dimply thunder since puberty. Been athletic since a lil kid, worked hard mostly on my feet all day. I never knew why my body kept the fat there, with flat chest and small stomach. Just learned about lipedema‚Ä¶ big sigh. That‚Äôs gotta be what it is!

When the goal is reached, I plan to add a couple days of eating and see what it takes for maintenance, and adjust from there. I‚Äôd love to confidently wear shorts, and a bathing suit in public at water parks! How about your goals? How‚Äôs your carnivore experience treating ya?
