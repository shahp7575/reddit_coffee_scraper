I mean hindi naman lagi, parang once a year or once every 3-4 years? Hindi ko na alam. Lagi naman kasi may reason pag nawawalan ako ng malay pero di ko alam kung dapat na ba ako magpatingin.

First time ko kasi na-experience mahimatay year 2018 dahil sa irregular period (regular na me ngayon). After that, sunod ako nahimatay last yr nung sinamahan ko yung kapatid ko na magpatanggal ng tahi (post op). Nahimatay na lang ako bigla habang tinatanggal tahi nya. Nandun din ako sa room kung san tinatanggalan sya. Tapos ang pinaka-recent is kanina sa salon jusme. Nagpa-pedi ako tas tinanggalan ako ng ingrown ni ate. Nung nilalagyan nya na ng bulak yung gilid ng kuko ko kasi dumugo, unti unti na kong nanghina pero conscious ako. Sinabi ko kay ateng naglilinis ng kuko ko na pipikit lang ako tas pati sya ninerbyos sa'kin kasi nanahimik daw ako bigla. Pagtingin nya sakin, maputla na  raw ako tas pinagpapawisan daw ako eh iced coffee yung iniiinom ko. Di ako totally nawalan ng malay kasi nakakapagsalita pa ko habang nakapikit pero ramdam kong kung nagtuloy tuloy yung pakiramdam na yun kanina, talagang mahihimatay ako. Na-bother lang din ako kasi sabi ng katabi kong customer kanina sa salon, baka raw may sakit ako sa puso? Ewan ko ba.

Her birthday is in August. I, 18 F, have a hard time saying no to things (it's something I'm working on with my therapist) and, despite being horrified, I said OKAY. So, I bought her the Martha Manual by Martha Stewart. I knew for years it would be the gift I got her for 18th birthday, because of its practicality, plus it's a cool coffee table book!

Anyways, I told her I'd have her birthday present to her by the end of the week. Then, however, on the 8th, she texted me and asked me to buy her a Robux gift card. For the second time this week, I was insulted. She told me she'd pay me back, but was my birthday present to her not enough? Seriously!

I got upset and told her so. Then told her no and she went about her evening. However, I was fuming. 

The fact that she had the gall to ask for her birthday present 6 months early was bad enough, but to ask for another thing on top of that? And to treat me like her fucking credit card? Like she lives with 15-minute walking distance of the store. She can walk, for fuck's sake! Or pay her parents!

So, because I was angry, I returned her gift. She will never be getting a gift from me ever again. 

And I also want to say that I am thinking about ending this friendship for other reasons:

\- We never initiate any time to hangout. I used to, but she was always busy, so I gave up. 

\- Our conversations are dry and sparse

\- She only speaks to me when she wants something

\- Overall, a very miserable relationship. It's literally hanging by the threads.

My father mentioned her asking about the gift 6 months early might something in her Chinese culture. I'm not sure if it's a culture thing, it might be, or it could be just ignorance. But she and I are both part American and it's definitely not that, because I never learned that behavior. I also know that in my French culture we don't do that shit. 

Honestly, I think it's her just being a fucking, ignorant bitch.

Hey MaximizeMe fam! üôå

So, let me take you back to a month ago when I was drowning in the depths of *goal-setting hell.* You know that feeling: endless lists, high expectations, and the constant pressure to ""hustle harder""? Yeah, I was *so* over it.

**One day, I hit a wall.** I threw my hands up, said ‚Äúscrew it,‚Äù and decided to ignore my goals altogether for 30 days. You might think: *What a reckless move!* But hold up ‚Äì it was the best decision I ever made! 

Here‚Äôs what I discovered during my little sabbatical from goal chasing:

1. **I Reconnected with Joy** üéâ  
   Without the pressure of goals, I found myself doing things I genuinely enjoyed. Remember that hobby you swore you‚Äôd get back to? I dusted off my guitar and started strumming again. 

2. **The ""Power of Nothing""** ‚úåÔ∏è  
   I embraced the idea of doing *nothing* productive. And guess what? It felt liberating! I binged some shows, went for walks, and even took naps without guilt. Turns out, leisure is a thing!

3. **Mindfulness Over Multitasking** üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  
   With the time I usually spent juggling tasks, I focused on being present. Whether cooking, reading, or just sipping my coffee, I allowed myself to savor each moment. It‚Äôs amazing how much clearer my mind felt afterwards.

4. **Celebrating Tiny Wins** üéä  
   I started recognizing the little things. Like, ‚ÄúHey, I made it out of bed today!‚Äù üôå or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt eat cereal for dinner three nights this week!‚Äù It reminded me that motivation doesn‚Äôt only come from big accomplishments.

5. **Rediscovered Creativity** üé®  
   Without the structured pressure of goals, my mind started wandering. I wrote silly poems, doodled, and even tried my hand at cooking new recipes. Creativity thrives in freedom!

*Here‚Äôs the kicker:* After 30 days, I wasn‚Äôt just refreshed; I was flooded with new motivation. Instead of feeling burned out and uninspired, I was excited about pursuing my goals, but now with a new perspective.

Reflecting on it all, I realized that sometimes, stepping back can mean stepping forward. Maybe we need to slack off a bit to reignite that fire within us. It‚Äôs like letting your phone battery drain before it revs back to life!

So, the next time you‚Äôre feeling burnt-out or unmotivated, consider taking a break from the grind. Give yourself permission to be human for a while. 

What have you done to boost your motivation? Have you ever ignored your goals and found something unexpected? Let‚Äôs chat about it! üåü",1,1744294081.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1jvysrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutsourceDevHub/comments/1jvysrl/how_to_nail_emr_data_migration_top_tips_for_a/,"How to Nail EMR Data Migration: Top Tips for a Clean, Compliant Move","Let‚Äôs face it: **EMR data migration** isn‚Äôt exactly a walk in the cloud. You‚Äôre dealing with mountains of sensitive patient information, complex regulatory demands, and legacy systems that look like they belong in a medical museum. But whether you're moving from paper to pixels or upgrading to a modern EHR platform, getting this right is crucial.

Here‚Äôs how to dodge disaster and come out on top.

# 1. Know What You‚Äôre Up Against

EMR (Electronic Medical Record) systems aren't plug-and-play. Each platform stores data differently ‚Äî think custom tables, undocumented fields, even rogue CSV exports. Add to that HL7, FHIR, or XML formats, and it becomes clear: this isn‚Äôt just a copy-paste job.

**Tip:** Start with a detailed data inventory. Classify what‚Äôs critical (e.g., clinical notes, lab results), what‚Äôs optional, and what can be archived.

# 2. Plan for Compliance Like It‚Äôs a Root Canal

HIPAA doesn‚Äôt take coffee breaks. During migration, PHI (Protected Health Information) must be protected at every stage. That means encrypted transfers, strict access control, and a tested rollback plan in case something blows up ‚Äî which, let‚Äôs be honest, it might.

**Regex nerd alert:** Use pattern-matching to scan for sensitive fields ‚Äî e.g., `/\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b/` to flag SSNs hiding in free-text notes.

# 3. Test, Test, Then Test Again

One dry run isn‚Äôt enough. Test your migration scripts in a sandbox that mimics production. Compare before/after data counts, perform field-level validation, and don‚Äôt skip on user feedback. Doctors don‚Äôt like surprises ‚Äî unless it's a free espresso.

# 4. Bring in the Big Guns

Let‚Äôs be honest, most internal IT teams aren‚Äôt EMR migration ninjas. This is where a partner like **Abto Software** can help ‚Äî they‚Äôve handled complex healthcare integrations, and know how to keep things lean, secure, and on schedule. Especially if you're juggling custom APIs or migrating across platforms like Epic, Cerner, or Meditech.

# 5. Don't Overlook Training and Support

You can migrate the data, but if your team doesn't know how to access it, what‚Äôs the point? Allocate time for post-migration support. A well-trained nurse with a fully working chart beats a frustrated surgeon yelling at an empty screen.

# Final Word

EMR data migration isn‚Äôt sexy, but it‚Äôs necessary. With proper prep, the right tools, and maybe a partner who‚Äôs been there, done that, you can make the transition smooth, safe, and stress-free. Just don‚Äôt wing it ‚Äî your patients (and your IT budget) will thank you.",1,1744294073.0,OutsourceDevHub,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm looking for recommendations for a pourover device for someone who likes a splash of milk with their coffee. You might think that‚Äôs a weird combo and you might be right - I‚Äôm open to alternatives. I had a bean-to-cup espresso/cappuccino maker for years, until I moved into a van a couple weeks ago. I experimented with the moka pot (following many tutorials and ensuring not to burn the coffee), which was okay‚Ä¶ but then I bought a ¬£3 plastic cup-top pourover device with some filters, followed James Hoffmann‚Äôs one cup V60 recipe (I know my thing probably doesn‚Äôt even resemble a V60, it converges to a line of 4 holes rather than a single point), splash of whole milk when it‚Äôs done‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs my favourite coffee I‚Äôve ever made myself. Tried it without milk and I can appreciate it, but I just really like a little bit of milk to take the edge off.

So if I love this one, why do I need a new one? Well I‚Äôm not a fan of boiling water in plastic 
daily for the rest of my life. I know there are lots of posts about the safety of different plastics but I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it. That (sadly) also means aeropress is out of the question for me.

So, I clearly I‚Äôm not an expert and probably wouldn‚Äôt benefit from going too deep down any pourover rabbit holes given that I like a splash of milk (tell me if you disagree though). So this makes me think that something like a Kalita Wave 155 might be better for me than something like a V60, as I may not appreciate the complexity achievable through the V60?

1jvyjce,https://www.reddit.com/r/BFS/comments/1jvyjce/new_twitcher_health_anxiety/,New twitcher & health anxiety,"Hi all! This is my first post so I‚Äôm just gonna start off by explaining my situation so far. I (23F) past 4 months of my life I have struggled with severe health anxiety where I would convince myself of a new illness every 2 weeks or so. It started as perceived hair loss, then i got so stressed out I gave myself Pityriasis Rosea for 2 months, then it was leukemia for a slightly low WBC on bloodwork that i got done while sick, and liver disease for a bruise on my palm. 

1 month ago my twitching started. I say the past month but I have always been twitchy. when I have panic attacks my face twitches so much I can‚Äôt communicate, and I had spells in childhood where muscles would twitch when I was stressed. i have a tremor in my hands and several shoulder injuries from having Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (dislocations, instability, shoulder separations etc). I saw 1 tiktok a month ago of a young person talking about their *** diagnosis, and my anxiety latched onto the word ~fasciculations~. at first i thought my pinky was twitching, then i thought the shaking was coming from my elbow, then my shoulder, and low and behold the next day my entire trunk is twitching non stop. back and forth between shoulders, abs, chest, all down my back. a week later suddenly my upper body stopped and it moved to my legs and the arch of my right foot. Now I feel twitching all across my entire body at least twice a minute if i focus on it. It‚Äôs mostly single punches in larger muscles like shoulders, calves, glutes. hotspots genuinely change by the day.

From what I understand here there are so many parts of my story that even so early in put me in the clear of ***. First the body wide twitching pretty rapidly, then the focus on the trunk, the dormancy of twitches for days at a time, that they get better with posture changes or movement, and the fact that I have done numerous clinical weakness tests and have never failed or felt like I could fail them. If I drink coffee or don‚Äôt sleep well I‚Äôm in for a bad day of twitching, and I know it gets worse when my posture is bad. I am only a month in so my trust in this is not great. When my shoulders were bad my physiotherapist felt my twitches and muscles and told me they are trained for detecting emergencies, and I am fine. I‚Äôm set to see my doctor in a week, but an EMG in my province lists the wait time for non-complete-emergency tests at multiple years. I don‚Äôt want to take that appointment date away from someone who might actually need it.

There is a lot of shame that comes with having health anxiety about something so serious. I often ask myself why I think that I‚Äôm so special that i would the ‚Äòthe one‚Äô who is that rare 0.1% chance of people from a group who are already so rare it can‚Äôt be put into numbers. It‚Äôs not fair. So the last resort is turning to anxiety management, and replacing testing of symptoms with other actions.

If i feel perceived weakness I will do a light workout. A couple sets of arm curls, physio exercises, squats, a quick power walk around the block. If my foot or shoulder is twitching (which usually makes me the most anxious) I roll out the muscles with a lacrosse ball. Do things with fine motor movement; play a video game, pick up an instrument, knit, FIND A HOBBY! Every second, and I mean every second, that you succeed you prove to yourself and remind yourself that you are ok. I know deep breathing doesn‚Äôt make the twitches stop, but action does. The trick with this is not only with the movement stop the twitching, it helps manage your anxiety which is the biggest kicker here. 

BIGGEST THING! NO DR. GOOGLE! When I am genuinely in such a deep hole that I feel hopeless, I turn to my running conversation with Dr. AI that reminds me that my symptoms do not point to my fears. not my proudest coping technique, but it keeps me going. I have OCD so this does need to stop, but man is it safer than Dr. Google.

I feel like i‚Äôve always had the ability to be twitchy, and the level of stress i‚Äôve been under for so long has finally caused a breakthrough. I know most people joke in here that everyone needs to see a psychiatrist more than they need an EMG, which does seem like the case for me. All i know is it‚Äôs important to stay calm, and recognize the patterns. Nobody has died of a twitchy butt. Listen to those around you, coping can happen but it is your responsibility.

1jvyhsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1jvyhsq/made_it_13_days_of_a_20_day_fast/,Made it 13 days of a 20 day fast,"Posting because I thought my experience might be useful for others.  It's lent, and I generally try and lose a bunch of weight for lent, because Orthodox diet restriction rules make it so I won't really enjoy eating much anyway.  I'd been doing OMAD on Wed, Thur, Sat, eat as much as I want Sun, and eat nothing Mon, Tues, Fri.  My starting weight was 253 (6'3"" M, 40 years old), target weight is 210.  Saw by week 4 I wasn't going to make it and thought I'd try just doing a total fast the rest of the way, with a few days for refeeding so I could enjoy the Pascha feast.  Prior to this 3 days has been my limit, where I get distracted wanting to eat enough that it effects my work.  At the start of my extended fast I was 236 lbs.  

Days 1 - 5: not pleasent, but no better or worse than other days of lent not eating.  I for sure was having issues with standing up too fast causing head rush.  Tried upping my electrolytes till I'd get diarrhea, and ultimately just accepted that it was going to be a thing.  I learned that really all I'd have to do is bend over enough to put my hands on my knees and it'd go away.  I continued to do 1.5 mile morning runs, lift weights, and go walking 2 - 4 miles in the evenings. 

Day 6: the promised past hunger phase!

Day 7 - 11: some times would get hunger back but not so bad.  I'd still think of food, but at the same time know that if I actually went out and eat a whole pizza it'd make me sick.  I went to the grocery store to pick up some vitamins and dog bones and found myself looking at junk food kind of like a kid with a broken leg looking at other kids playing tag.  Like I want to want this food, but if I actually took it home and ate it, it wouldn't be fun.  For exercise I'd try and keep it hard as I could without going over a threshold.  I've been on high protein diets before and can sort of tell when I'm metabolizing protein due to the ammonia smell.  So if I got that smell, I'd try and back off.  This would happen if I'd run too fast, or lift too heavy.  For lifting it was basically just dead lifts that could cause it.

Day 13: did my morning run, and then was really dragging.  Lowest energy day so far.  Decided to not lift weights and skip running the next day.  

Day 14: to keep good habits, I still went on a morning walk, just no run.  But my energy levels were still supper low.  I was at 214, so close to my goal weight, but still clearly had/have stubborn fat in my love handles.  But then I started getting the ammonia smell, just at work.  Not doing any exercise.  And it was persistent.  Took that as a sign that my body wasn't getting enough fat to burn and so it was having to go to lean tissue.  Decided that was it, and started refeeding.  It being Wednesday, with a Presanctified liturgy service, I ate 3 pieces of boiled broccoli, 2 boiled shrimps at noon, and then had to do the communion fast (no food or water) from noon till 6:30 when we had communion.  After communion I had 4 pieces of blessed bread (for those not orthodox, we do a spoon full of bread and wine mixed together for communion, and then to make sure we don't accidentally spit it out or cough it up, etc, we take some blessed bread to eat that will sponge it up in our mouths basically).  Then after that we had our church Lenten meal which was basically vegan chili and bread.  I had two small bowls, and two pieces of bread.  I also took a bowl home and had it along with some rice noodles, shrimp and mixed vegetables all boiled together before bed.  

Anyway, I'm sad I wasn't able to get my full 20 days, but think I learned a lot.  I was looking here for what signs are there to stop, and don't think smelling ammonia ever came up.  I know some posters have said ketones will cause that smell, but I think if that were true I should have been smelling it all along.  And I definitely know what it smells like when I'm metabolizing protein.  Also, I think I was way more worried about the refeed than I needed to be.  My last meal yesterday was basically a full sized meal.  Granted I did build up to it, and it was healthy food, but I thought it'd be a matter of days not hours, and not sure I even needed the build up I took.  

General notes: I took ""Fasting Electrolyte Supplement Powder"" for electrolytes, which I bought off Amazon.  I'd add some table salt to it too because I felt like low sodium was the biggest issue.  I'd put 2 scoops into a coffee mug and then fill with hot water.  I went from 1 cup a day, to 3, to 2, which seemed right in terms of not getting diarrhea, but also having the most energy possible.  My sleep wasn't the best, but not horrible either.  Today I went up from 214.6 to 216.4, which I thought was a pretty small jump, although I'd been plateaued at 214.x for 3 days.  

Anyway, hopefully this is useful, and if I did anything stupid, I'm sure you'll all let me know in the comments.  Thanks",4,1744293305.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

Yesterday...

Up with the sun. Out of tent. Phones at outlet on side of building. Off to walmart. Doughnuts, yogurt, coffee, orange, salami slices, provolone cheese. Recon ahstrays on way back to tent. In tent. Practice ancient art of pack chow. Smoke a couple refries. Much better. Check phone. Some greenbacks in Venmo from kind internet friend for the trip. 'Thanks man!' 

Check maps. Approximately two and a half miles to next exit, through town. Gear packed. Out of tent. Gear out. Tent down and on pack. Phones/chargers in pack. Gear up. Through parking lot. Up street.

Notice lightly used dirt road on way to cross-street. 'This will shorten my walk by at least half.' Down dirt road past a few houses. Beautiful woods right in the middle of town. Over blocked off concrete bridge. Pause for pic. Onward. 

Come up to other, more populated main street. Cross intersection. Left toward onramp. Car stopped on it's way out of parking lot.

""Where you going?"" ""California."" ""Will Lake Land help you?"" ""Yeah, definitely."" ""Hop in."" Gear in car. Me in car. Down the road we go. Brief diatribe about religion. ""Do you mind if I smoke?"" ""Not at all. Can I bum one?"" ""Sure."" Dude's a little all over the place with conversation.  I realize he's just listening to himself speak. He's not really paying attention to what I'm saying.

Thirty-some-odd miles later dropped off near onramp. Down ramp. Gear down. Thumb out. Text notification. 'Whenever you get there (bus station) see about a phone number so I can cover the ticket.' 'Will do.'

Check maps. Bus station an hour and a half away on foot. Soonest bus leaving in exactly an hour and a half. 'Not gonna make that one. Next one at 7:20pm. Might as well try and hitchhike.' Off onramp. Down street. Gear down. Thumb out. Forty-five minutes later, 'Fuck this. Time to walk.'

Four miles. Bus station. Walk up seven minutes after they close. Brief texts back and forth. Ticket purchased. Straight shot west from here at 5:30. No going through Jacksonville and Atlanta. 'Nice!' Off to gas station. Winstons. Winn Dixie. Munchies for the trip. Sandwich, pretzels, tuna salad and crackers, sweet tea. Back to bus station. Dabs. A sweet, sweet, winston. Salami and cheese.

Bus pulls in one minute late. Gear under bus. Me, chargers, phones, jacket, hoody on bus. Down the road. 'Damn! This thing has air conditioning. Sweet! A bit more comfortable than standing on an onramp too...'

We pull in two minutes late to catch next bus. 'Oh, here we go. Always a fucking nightmare on the bus. Probably gonna get stuck for twenty-four hours waiting on the next bus.' 

The next bus waited for us. 'Praise the baby jesus! Someone at greyhound actually gave a fuck and has some sense!' Haul ass for bus. Gear under bus. Me in bus. On down the road we go...

'Don't worry, be happy. How many fucking times do we have to go over this? Every day it would seem üòÜüòÜüòÜ Dumbass.'

Mobile, Alabama. 11:00pm. 'Been here recently.' Easy street. Hour layover. Dude sitting next to me is changing busses. Inside. Out to smoke. Back in. Out to smoke right before bus is ready. Back inside.

""All reboards traveling coming from Florida going to Houston line B!"" Gear. Line B. 

There's been a disabled child onboard so far. Loud. (I've been a musician for 39 years.) Like, loud. No big deal to me. That's what this twenty-one year playlist I've been building is for. And, I'm the oldest of eight. Nothing a kid is gonna do is gonna bother me. I did think he was a dog that someone else had for a while though.

All that to say... Kid, *makes loud noise.* New, testy bus driver checking our tickets, ""If that dog barks once I'm putting it off the bus!"" Someone in line, ""It's a kid."" Bus driver, obviously knocked down a few pegs, ""I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.""

Gear on bus. Me on bus. Both seats. Get deep in to the philosophy of sleeping in unnatural positions. Tunes in ears. Didn't sleep but feel better this morning for having rested.

Wake up in the wee hours. We're coming up on a stop. Looks like we're hanging for a minute. Off bus. Smoke. Follow bus driver on bus. She gets situated, turns around, sees me, ""What are you doing?"" ""Reboarding."" Get chewed for getting off bus while not being told to do so. Kill her with kindness. Ninety per cent effective. Back on bus.

Sleep-ish. Sun's up. Announcement for 15 minute break. Legally allowed to get off bus. Smoke. Dab. 'Hm. Must be low.' Check. Affirmative. Bus driver walks into convenience store. Back on bus. Reload. Off bus. 'Back to what I was doing before I was so rudely interrupted. üòÜ' 

('What the fuck was I writing about... Oh yeah.)

Back on bus. Out on the highway. 'Where the fuck are we...'

They were in the campus library one day, sitting alone. I took it as a sign from the universe. So I casually walked over with my coffee, fully intending to say something smooth like, ‚ÄúHey, mind if I join you?‚Äù

But the universe had other plans.

As I was walking, I tripped. Not a normal stumble‚Äîno. I did a full-on cinematic slow-mo fall, launched my coffee into the air like a rocket, and it landed right on their open laptop. I wanted to evaporate on the spot.

They were surprisingly chill about it, but the embarrassment is still burned into my soul. The worst part? I ended up having to Venmo them for the laptop repair‚Ä¶ and now every time I see them, they just smirk and say ‚ÄúCareful with your coffee.‚Äù

So yeah, I shot my shot, and it ricocheted directly into my own face. Has anyone else had a painfully awkward moment like this? Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone.

I‚Äôm not here to sugarcoat anything. If your profile doesn‚Äôt meet certain standards, don‚Äôt expect a fully funded Master‚Äôs. Partial scholarships are possible, but you may still need to pay a lot‚Äîanywhere between 10 to 60 lakhs depending on the country.

Now let‚Äôs begin!

Getting admitted to universities abroad is relatively easy, but securing funding is the real challenge. I‚Äôll focus on the funding aspect here, but first, let‚Äôs talk about building a strong profile.
---

My Admissions & Scholarships (my_qualifications) 

Here‚Äôs a quick overview of where I got in and what kind of funding I received:

1. Imperial College London (MSc Management) ‚Äì No scholarship (applied for Chevening but didn‚Äôt get it)

2. New York University (MSc in Core Engineering) ‚Äì $16,000 scholarship

3. Northeastern University (MSc in Core Engineering) ‚Äì 5% tuition discount (minimal scholarship)

4. Three different Erasmus Mundus programs ‚Äì Reduced tuition but no full scholarship

5. University of Tokyo (MSc in Core Engineering) ‚Äì Fully funded MEXT scholarship

(Happy to verify this if needed) 

---

How to Build a Strong Profile

To increase your chances of getting funded, aim to build a cohesive and competitive profile:

0. IELTS: Aim for an overall band of 7.5+ with no section below 7.0 (this is a basic requirement for most programs).

1. GPA: If your GPA is below 8.0, consider getting it evaluated through WES. It can improve your chances.

2. Internships: Research or industry internships carry weight‚Äîinclude them.

3. Research Papers: Even one decent paper can stand in for GRE scores or boost your academic value.

4. GRE Score: Not mandatory everywhere, but a score above 310 helps.

5. Statement of Purpose: Don‚Äôt underestimate this. A weak SOP can ruin an otherwise good profile.

6. Letters of Recommendation: Get three solid ones from professors or employers who know your work.
---

Strategies to Secure Funding

1. Cold Emailing Professors: This used to work, but it's highly saturated now. Unless your email stands out, it's not very effective anymore.

2. LinkedIn: Follow researchers, scholarship communities, and student mentors. Many post about assistantships and grants.

3. Direct Applications: Some universities automatically consider you for scholarships when you apply, but keep in mind: free application = more applicants = more competition.

Couples being goofy and kind. Strangers doing nice things without a reason. It‚Äôs not just content‚Äîit‚Äôs the reminder that love like that exists. That people like me still make sense.

I‚Äôm 18. I‚Äôm someone who gives love like a storm‚Äîintense, consuming, loyal, and unapologetically tender. If I‚Äôm in, I‚Äôm all in. I‚Äôll flirt with you like I‚Äôve studied your smile for years. I‚Äôll check in on how your soul‚Äôs doing, not just your day. I‚Äôll remember the small things, even when you forget them yourself. I love deeply, and I love deliberately.

I‚Äôm not here for casual. I‚Äôm not here for games. I‚Äôm here because I still believe that two people can build something real‚Äîsomething that‚Äôs messy, slow-burning, wildly romantic, and a little exhausting in all the best ways.

When I‚Äôm not working toward my dream of becoming a robotics scientist, I‚Äôm usually learning something new, vibing to songs (Linkin Park or Radiohead when the emotions hit), or cooking‚Äîbecause food and love have one thing in common: effort.

I love people who are kind for no reason. I get attached to souls more than bodies. I don‚Äôt care about your looks. I care about your character. About whether you'd help a lost dog or remember your friend‚Äôs weird coffee order. I'm agnostic, but I respect people who have faith‚Äîany faith‚Äîas long as they respect others too.

I‚Äôm not perfect. I feel a lot. I think too much. I love in ways that scare me sometimes. But if you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs been waiting to be truly seen, truly chosen, truly held‚Äînot just physically, but emotionally and spiritually‚ÄîI might just be your kind of person.
Say hi‚Äîsure. But say more than that.
If I poured a piece of my soul into this, I hope you can spare a little of yours too.
Tell me what part of this resonated. Or tell me who you are. Tell me what makes you feel like you still deserve love that doesn‚Äôt flinch. I‚Äôll be reading every word.

So I 30M and my 23F partner have been together for a year and a half now. We have gone through many phases, I have gone through many bad relationships, I have grown. I know that I have done wrong in those relationships and I know what has been done wrong to me.

I was physically abused in in a 7 year relationship long prior to this one. Every now and then I have nightmares of being stuck there, still. I was 27 when I left that relationship and returned to England, it was the 7th suicide attempt that made me realize, I couldn't hack it anymore. 

Okay, that's some backstory on me.

Ever since leaving that relationship behind, I've strived for communication in every relationship that I've been in. I've made sure to have one day sometime in a week where we can sit and talk with some coffee or tea. I believe that I've always been attentive to what is said, consider the angles the views of my partners, I've taken on criticism, understood points and grievances even change somethings about myself to help support my partners.

I strongly am from the point of view that I am always learning, everyday at all times. Life's a school.

Even times while I'm at home (WFH) I'll text my partner every few hours. My job is busy, very busy. There's not a moment that I have free aside from break and lunch times. 

I struggle with sleep.  
I can't seem to fall asleep when needed and that makes me tired for the next day. On this particular day, I had only slept, give or take, 2 hours. I had expressed this to my partner, informing them that I was extremely exhausted and work was taking it's toll, I work with customers, rectifying issues that they're having. 

That same day my partner who struggles with finding work (which I completely understand) and mental health (which I completely understand, again) told me they were having a rough day after not responding to me at work and a few hours after work. I ask them how I can help with this feeling and provide the support that they need, they told me to be myself and provide connection.

We get together and I have a bunch of jokes that I thought were funny, I thought maybe some jokes might help. That didn't work. I switched gears, I spoke about my day and they were receptive, nodding along, acknowledging, but it was obvious that they were distant, very obvious. I switch gears again, I ask if they're okay, but they say ""meh"" which is their go to. I ask for details, trying to understand what's at the root of their feelings. Nothing.

I was still very exhausted and I put that to the wayside up until now. An hour and a half into this attempt at connection, I found my body heavy and my mind cloudy. 

I had gone silent too. 

Lost for what to do, lost for what to say, lost for how to provide a connection where it is obvious that it needs to be mainly from me this time, I'm lost. 

She says goodbye and I'm defeated and exhausted. 

Later that night we text and I'm in bed early, ready to pass out yet I want them to know I'm going to bed soon but I am here to talk. 

They tell me they're disappointed, that they told me they're having a hard day and they needed me and I couldn't provide them the connection they needed.

They voiced their concerns and I just couldn't understand. They told me I was being defensive, I don't think I was, somewhere deep down I still don't think so. I was trying to understand where I went wrong, I was asking and even at that point I was still made it clear I want to understand. I didn't feel attacked, I felt confused. I was asking where in what I did was not showing that connection that I was trying get. 

They told me it's not about being right or wrong which I never thought it was. They told me it was about understanding them even if they're wrong in my eyes so that they feel safe and heard, even if I'm right. That even if I'm tired I shouldn't bring that up at a time we are talking about their issues even though this applied to the both of us and me providing the best care possible.

Once again I felt lost.

So, yeah. I would like to quit weed, but don't know where to start as its become a part of my routine. I go for walks (have been since about 2021 when I picked up the habit). Walking and smoking weed in my neighborhood is to me what booty is to the booty warrior. I lost like 40-50 pounds in that time and I feel great, but let's be honest: a black man has limited opportunities, even in NYC. Weed makes that shit even less. Don't even think about driving something with air brakes if you have weed in your system. And rightfully so: I had the most responsibility when I was driving for a certain bike sharking company in NYC. The power something like a school bus has is terrifying. Which brings me here. I wish to stop smoking weed for good, I heard gummies may help with the smoking part. I've also heard it's easier than cigarettes which I quit after 12 years (6 months so far). 

  
What helped me a lot with cigarettes was tapering (I did that for nearly a year: getting loosies and eventually patching up. Smoked my last cigarette on the 13 of October and forgot the patches (fell off) on my birthday. Caffeine really helped me at first as that felt like a cig. Of course nine cups of coffee/tea a day ain't good for the heart, but neither are cigarettes. I'm free of cigs now. I dream of them from time to time. And even think about them but I'm holding. I need to do the same with weed because I plan on upgrading my license to a CDL. And weed is a big no-no (rightfully so). Help me internet friends.

But some of them have been on the market for more than a year, likely due to high price tags and developers having to wait on rezoning in the Town of Orchard Park ‚Äì which occurred in October.

An East Side apostolic church is seeking a rezoning of three city-owned lots it plans to purchase and put up a $10 million townhome project around the corner with 28 residential units.

The United House of Prayer for All People wants to construct a set of 14 attached townhouse buildings in three clusters on Adams and Watson streets, with two apartments in each townhouse. Two five-unit clusters would be located next to each other on Adams, while a four-unit cluster would be located behind them on Watson, with a courtyard, walking paths and greenspace in between.

There‚Äôs more than meets the eye in the disagreements over the future of the Boulevard Mall in Amherst.

Mall owner Douglas Jemal said this week after meeting with Town Supervisor Brian Kulpa that the town was dropping its plan to take the entire site by eminent domain as part of a bigger redevelopment, because the town lacks the money.

Jemal, frustrated after emptying the mall of most tenants in anticipation of the $150 million plan to turn the site into a lifestyle center, says he‚Äôs now left to refill the shopping center and pursue his own plan.

Not so fast, Kulpa says. He says the town hasn‚Äôt wavered from the eminent domain plan, but that Jemal is impatient and needs cash. And Kulpa says the town won‚Äôt be rushed.

‚ÄúProceeding with what?‚Äù Jemal responded. ‚ÄúWhat has he offered?‚Äù

The two versions of the same meeting illustrate a widening gulf between Jemal and Kulpa over how to proceed with the 64-acre mall, once the region‚Äôs second-largest retail center but now a mostly vacant hulk on Niagara Falls Boulevard.

(They are making it extremely hard to continue to defend this plan, get your acts together fellas!)

The Niagara Falls businessman who has been trying for years to renovate and reopen the Niagara Club next to Niagara Falls State Park hopes to finish a new upscale steakhouse and seafood restaurant in the building by year-end.

Businessman and hospitality entrepreneur B.F. ""Babu"" Patel wants to finish converting the historic private club building at 24 Buffalo Ave. into a ""premier dining, social and entertainment destination"" that would include the city's only urban rooftop terrace and bar, overlooking the Niagara River rapids...

Through his Rupal Hospitality, he already undertook the first phase of work a few years ago, so that the building already contains a Spot Coffee location and an Indian restaurant, Bombay Palace, both of which would stay. Now he's ready to kick off the second phase, which will total just over $2 million of work.

Upon completion, the 25,571-square-foot building would also feature a banquet and event hall capable of accommodating up to 250 guests for conferences, weddings and other events, as well as the 150-seat restaurant and outdoor patio. It also would include the rooftop terrace, with both food service and live music.",2,1744292354.0,Buffalo,7,1.0,False

1jvy2k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1jvy2k1/trip_report_0407apr2025/,Trip Report 04-07Apr2025,"Hi All ‚Äì

¬†Just got back from a three-day trip to Iceland 04-07Apr (flew out of Boston on Icelandair) and wanted to share some details as I have been reading this forum for awhile and used it as a resource for my trip.

¬†I brought my Patagonia Black Hole Mini MLC 30L and carried a Target plastic bag (doubled up for strength). On the way to Iceland my backpack and plastic bag were ¬æ full and on the return flight both bags were full but not stuffed. Both flights were fully booked but I did not see any bags being measured or hear any announcements about doing so. A person in line in front of me said her bag was measured on her way to Iceland but she had a medium sized roller bag and a decently sized stuffed backpack.

¬†I rented a car from Hertz (Gold Member) and the process was super quick (all of the rental kiosks are inside the airport) and it was a bit of a walk to the rental lot to grab my vehicle. Driving around the country was very easy and I would not have gone with any other option.

My itinerary:

Day 1:

* Land at KEF
* Hafnarberg (sea cliffs)
* Blue Lagoon
* Pallett for coffee/snack (highly recommended)
* Strolled around Reykjavik the rest of the day/night (not in order)
   * Hallgrimskirkja
   * Kolaporti√∞ (highly recommended)
   * The Icelandic Phallological Museum
   * B√¶jarins Beztu Pylsur (has to happen)
   * Smekkleysa Coffee & Record Shop
   * Reykjavik Roasters
   * Sun Voyager
   * Punk Rock Museum
   * Tobacco Shop Reykjav√≠k
   * Icelandic Street Food
   * Tons of other shops and sights

¬†Day 2:

* Drove to Snaefellsnes Peninsula
   * Bjarnarfoss (waterfall)
   * B√∫√∞aklettur (black church)
   * Arnarstapi (grabbed a cheeseburger)
   * Dj√∫pal√≥nssandur beach (volcanic rock beach)
   * Sv√∂√∞ufoss (waterfall)
   * Kirkjufellsfoss (waterfall and mountain)
   * Grundarfoss (waterfall)
* Explored Reykjavik for a bit

¬†Day 3:

* Walked around Reykjavik to pick up souvenirs
* Viking Museum
* Bonus to grab candy
* Returned car and hung at the airport until my return flight

¬†Some helpful info:

¬∑ My rationale for taking a plastic Target bag as my personal item was that it looked like something I just purchased at the airport and would not draw attention if the airline was measuring bags

¬∑¬†You cannot buy anything at KEF until you clear entry into the country, the stores all scan your boarding pass to make sure you are departing ‚Äì this one confused me for a little bit but once you are through customs there is a huge Duty Free and other shops inside the airport

¬∑¬†I stayed at the Canopy Hilton; it was right downtown and very convenient, parking is close by but it was loud on Saturday night due to the proximity to a few bars

¬∑¬†N1 has the easiest gas pump interface (multiple languages) and I had to enter a PIN to pump

¬∑¬†There is a Bonus (grocery) store right near the airport ‚Äì I highly recommend stopping to grab some snacks/drinks once you land and for Icelandic candy/food to take home as souvenirs (cheaper than gift shops and the airport)

¬∑¬†Try the Collab beverage; the red was my favorite and I took a few home

¬∑¬†There are some barren areas in the country but I never had any concern about running out of fuel

¬∑¬†Everywhere I shopped at accepted my Mastercard and I also used the local currency at a few spots

¬∑¬†I wore my Danner 600s and Kuhl Free Rydr pants the whole time and never felt out of place

¬∑¬†I had my hoodie/ winter coat and hat on most of the time, but the shops and places to eat are super warm

¬∑¬†I didn‚Äôt wear my thermals or rain gear even though I did a few decent hikes and climbed right next to some of the waterfalls

¬∑¬†I also did not use my newly purchased tripod, learned I am not a selfie person üòä

¬†If you have any questions I am more than happy to answer or dive deeper into any of the topics. I am 100% going to return to Iceland once I explore more countries and suggestions are always welcome!",3,1744292155.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False

Seriously though, Sunday night I felt a bit off. Felt stressed and at capacity. Heart rate up a bit elevated around 120 at rest. I have had a stressful full few months with a big situation and thought it was residual leaving the body finally. Monday morning I woke up to alerts on my Fitbit app that I was in AFib. With the Fitbit not being the most accurate device I thought well I do still feel like I have been taking shots of expresso so let me get it checked out. I was lucky to get in with a cardiologist the following day because it had a cancellation. After 5 minutes of being in the office they told me I'm in AFib. The Fitbit told me my heart rate was 130 while I was laying on the table but in fact it was 175 using their tools. I was sent to the emergency room from there, where I had a pleasant overnight stay. My heart is back in rhythm and heart rate is coming down after we figured out the cause. I only bought the Fitbit because I had a $200 credit to the Google store but I had to use. I have to say without that warning I probably would have ignored how I've been feeling for a couple more days. And after learning what afib is nsvt it could have led to a blood clot which would have led to a stroke. I was still going to the gym and still drinking coffee while in AFib. So thanks Fitbit.

It was around 10:40AM when my friends decided to leave to eat for lunch and left their laptops unplugged to prevent overcharging, and their bags at the table itself and on the chairs they sit in. I'm left alone with 2 of my other friend who was also sleeping so I try to neatly arrange their laptop and other items so other students know that someone is sitting on that spot.

Charged my phone before I went to sleep at around 11:00AM cause I've already eaten before them and when I woke up at 12:03PM, I saw someone sitting on the other side of the table I was sitting on, and has their laptop already plugged in. I thought it was my friend before I picked up my glasses and saw that its a completely different person. I WAS SHOCKED ASF IT SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME üò≠üò≠ They didn't even wave at me or asked if they can use the extension cord, I know they're not obligated to but it's a common decency atleast please. I was uncontrollably shaking inside and I had to immediately message one of my friends to come back cause I was scared shitless, they don't seem to be bad guy at all so I don't know why I'm feeling like this. I just try to sleep it off then 3 of their friends come in and moved the items to the side to place their bag and take a tiktok with their phone or something, I wasn't paying attention to what they're doing anymore cause I got scared even more for some reason. It felt the longest time waiting for my friend to come back, and I had calmed down a bit after the first and 2 more of my friends came back.

This is more of about me than about them, but after this experience I think I'm not gonna be able to sleep off alone on the huge table anymore.. üò©üò©üò©",5,1744291734.0,WeAreRAMS,0,1.0,False

1jvxtmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jvxtmp/aitah_for_wanting_to_breakup_with_my_boyfriend/,AITAH for wanting to breakup with my boyfriend over sharing food?,"Basically I (17F) am dating J (17 M) and we have been together for 7 months. So far we really haven‚Äôt had any conflicts other than the start of our relationship and that‚Äôs about it. This has slightly been a persistent issue and my goal is to figure out how to properly explain my viewpoint to him/ why I got mad because he doesn‚Äôt understand. 

The issue at hand is one of our mutual friends A (F) has been acting a little too close for comfort towards him. Before this situation happened some examples are play fighting (which they were doing before we were dating), asking for food off his plate (like right after we started dating), joining us (J and I) a lot in our walks, and the key moment that made me a little worried, she was trying to force open a window to say hi to him. After I had already said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have to do that since he is coming here anyways‚Äù and held the window shut. The reason I was so worried about the window is because we were in a classroom, for a club meeting, and the teacher wasn‚Äôt there so I felt it wasn‚Äôt appropriate to do. I also told him this was how I was feeling about her before the situation happened. At this point I also haven‚Äôt talked to her about her actions bothering me, but Ill explain why later. The problem that caused the argument was the fact that:

1. J and A were hanging out alone for an hour and a half because J had a free block (which I also had but he didn‚Äôt tell me) and ended up finding A and hanging out with her

2. On our campus there is a coffee place which they walked to together at the time we were all supposed to meet at before walking. This is a time A knows well, and i saw them walking off to the building together.

3. They leave and they both have drinks (which I assume he bought, but it turns out he didn‚Äôt)

4. When I go to take a sip of J‚Äôs drink, A warns me that it might be hot and she burned her tongue on it with the first sip she took. (He gave her a separate straw)

So this freaked me out and I went and talked to him about how those actions left me uncomfortable, though when I first brought it up i did lowkey spam him with a lot of texts. Cherry on top, he was the one who offered her a sip of his drink. He said it was because she said she has never had the drink before (even tho her mom was obsessed with it and our other friend has brought it and baked with it multiple times) and because he is really passionate about how good it is and wants to put his friends on. Afterwards I made it clear this was a boundary I was setting for future situations and he was understanding of that but he still didn‚Äôt completely agree or understand why I was annoyed about it. Also when I told him I was originally displeased by the fact he might have bought her the drink he said that also would have been fine in his book. He also told his mom and three friends about it, only ONE of those people have a healthy relationship. In his defense I am his first girlfriend/ proper relationship EVER. 

I haven‚Äôt brought anything up with A yet because when I talked to my sister about it she said:

1. If it is truly worse case where A likes J then telling her this would only mean she got what she wanted 

2. A should know how to respect your best friend boyfriend (i had a talk to her ab this when she had a boyfriend)

3. I don‚Äôt want to come off as a bitch and the boundary is something we BOTH have to stand on, not just one of us.

The logic I tried explaining to him:

1. Its not good because from outsider perspective it looks like she is your girlfriend
 
2. Germs can still be spread even if you use a straw

3. All three of us are walking together, why would you only get a drink for her and not your girlfriend.

4. It could create the possibility of her gaining feelings and you would just be fanning the flames with that

Overall, my sister and mom want me to break up with him (which I really don‚Äôt want to do) and I really want him to better understand and agree with my view point so if a similar situation happens he knows to not interact with it out of respect. Also this might get taken down soon after as I don‚Äôt want either of them to see this because it would be awkward. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt really know how to handle this as it is also my first relationship.

After spending the final centuries of his final incarnation defending Trenzalore against alien invaders, the dying Doctor was granted a new regeneration cycle by the Time Lords. Mirroring his first incarnation, this new **Doctor** resembled an older man with a cold and abrasive personality that often came at odds with his current companion Clara, who no longer recognized the dashing young adventurer she once knew. Clara wasn't the only one who didn't know what to make of the Doctor. The Doctor himself questioned if he really lived up to the heroic image he was known for throughout the universe, or if he was actually just as malicious and destructive as the aliens he routinely thwarted. 

Even on his second regeneration cycle and second millennium of life, the Doctor soon realized there's still so much to learn about himself and the universe.

###Regeneration 

**Regeneration** is a process Time Lords undergo when approaching death that rewrites every cell in their body into a renewed form with a different appearance and personality. This incarnation was set between two major physical changes, going from [young to old](https://imgur.com/Zp1d7YJ ""TotD"") then [male to female](https://imgur.com/thVjbxU ""TUAT""). 

* [The Twelfth Doctor is a rare example of the Doctor not regenerating randomly. Instead he resembles an aged Lobus Caecilius: a man his tenth incarnation saved despite his proximity in a fixed point in time. The Doctor subconsciously took on this face as a reminder to always save somebody](https://redd.it/1inzf3c ""S9E5""). Additionally, [Madame Vastra suggests the Doctor's older appearance is him ""lifting the veil"" by no longer sporting a youthful visage that appeals to humans](https://redd.it/1j248ic ""S8E1"") to match his blunter personality. Though, [the Eleventh Doctor's negative reaction to his successor's age suggests it was influenced retroactively.](https://redd.it/l6vsws ""S8E1"")

* Regeneration energy can be expelled on command even when the Time Lord isn't dying. Though, it isn't advisable as it could have detrimental effects on future regenerations. 
 * [Lends Davros some regeneration energy to heal his eyesight which he then funnels to every Dalek on Skaro. However, this also renews the aged Daleks that were discarded into the sewers who proceed to attack the Daleks on the surface.](https://redd.it/1inzf55 ""S9E2"") 
 * [Expels regeneration energy from his body in order to trick Bill into thinking she killed him.](https://imgur.com/iCyEqo6 ""S10E8"")
* Regeneration can be delayed without succumbing to one's injuries, putting the Time Lord in [a state of grace for a time before they must either chose to undergo the change or die as they are.](https://imgur.com/vL0DQ9W ""TUAT"")
The Doctor [put off his regeneration for two weeks](https://imgur.com/H96fjop ""S10E12"") while preparing for a Cyberman attack, though [it took a physical toll on him](https://imgur.com/C6BuhVc ""S10E12"") which [continued](https://imgur.com/jTfD122 ""TUAT"") as [he further refused to change.](https://redd.it/1iwim7o ""S10E12"") 
* [Time Lords are invulnerable to harm while regenerating, as evidenced by the Doctor surviving being blasted with a Cyberman's laser a few times and the ensuing explosion that was big enough to wipe out an entire field of Cybermen. The Doctor merely lost consciousness.](https://redd.it/1ix0xuf ""S10E12"")
* [As a consequence of delaying regeneration for so long, the resulting energy discharges violently in the form of electric bolts that damage the TARDIS console room.](https://imgur.com/thVjbxU ""TUAT"")

**Miscellaneous Biology** 

* Possess a respiratory bypass system that allows Time Lords to go without breathing for a long time. The Doctor used it [to hold his breath for several minutes to avoid being detected by robots](https://redd.it/1ie4ajt ""S8E1"") and [to rescue a group of humans from a space train that was being deprived of air.](https://redd.it/1ig5pfc ""S8E8"")
* Has a much longer lifespan than humans. [He spent 50-70 years teaching at St Luke's University without visibly aging.](https://imgur.com/LC2jVcr ""S10E1"")
* [Has two hearts and thus twice the blood pressure.](https://imgur.com/DG5fKKu ""S10E2"")

* [The fate of the Moon in 2049 is a ""grey area"" the Doctor is unclear on despite his knowledge of the future](https://redd.it/1ieirfr ""S8E7""). After the Moon's fate is decided, [the Doctor projects the course of humanity from then on.](https://redd.it/1ieipwb ""S8E7"")

I‚Äôm on my first watch of all things Twin Peaks.¬†I have watched:  
Season 1 & Season 2 (with log lady intros)  
Fire Walk With Me

And I‚Äôm baffled.

To clarify, this is not my first foray into Lynch, or things with complex lore, but I feel particularly ‚Äòbehind‚Äô with this.¬†

I really think I‚Äôm intended to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô the supernatural elements more by this point.¬†

I‚Äôm fully aware that TMP will clarify many things, and S3/TR may do the same. But I‚Äôm struck by the fact that the information I have now is all that people had for over 2 decades!  
And I guess I don‚Äôt know how much I‚Äôm supposed to know by now.¬†

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

So here are my questions:

(PLEASE DON‚ÄôT SPOIL ANYTHING MAJOR IN TMP OR S3! If it‚Äôs something I should know by now, please point me in the direction of what I should rewatch for clarity. If it cannot be understood yet, and is cleared up in later parts, please tell me. Give me hints, not answers pleaseeeee)

1. FWWM seems to suggest that Leland has more agency over his actions than the series tells us he does. But this has large implications for Dale‚Äôs ‚Äòpossession‚Äô at the end of S2. If Laura can refuse to host BOB, then why didn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt Dale?
2. Exactly how much was I supposed to glean from Philip Jeffries‚Äô scene? From what we see of him in the film (again, ignoring TMP for now), we hear about a character Judy, we see other figures meeting with The Arm and BOB, and something about a table and the garmonbozia. Without later instalments, am I supposed to know the following?:
   1. Who are all the other people?
   2. Why do they have meetings?
   3. Do they all reside in the black lodge? Or just The Arm and BOB?
   4. Who is Judy? (again no spoilers please)?
   5. Why was MIKE not at the meeting, but in the Black Lodge?
   6. If MIKE and The Arm are ‚Äògood‚Äô, allied against BOB, why do they still feed (literally) on pain and suffering? And why does BOB give it to them?
3. The monkey says ‚ÄòJudy‚Äô. I‚Äôve heard later works clarify this but what were people supposed to think between 1992-2014?
4. I still don‚Äôt understand why ‚Äúuncle‚Äù is *missing* from ‚Äúmy mother‚Äôs sister‚Äôs girl‚Äù. That sentence is grammatically and logically sound as it is. It intimidates me, thinking that every single sentence of dialogue *could* be interpreted as missing a vaguely related word.¬†
5. Also, the explaining of Lil‚Äôs actions set to be a tutorial before the main storyline, but I have no idea who I should be analysing this way‚Ä¶¬†
6. The blue rose and the number 7 are mysteries that seem really important, but that I still don‚Äôt understand.
7. Laura states that she‚Äôs worried BOB/Leland will kill James if he found out about him, but wouldn‚Äôt this also endanger Bobby? Why was Bobby not punished by BOB?
8. Some hard to hear dialogue is subtitled. Some isn‚Äôt. Is there a reason for this?
9. If MIKE removed the arm as an act of defiance against BOB, then why is the arm also ‚Äògood‚Äô and not ‚Äòevil‚Äô?¬†
10. The magician kid sometimes, but not always, wears the same mask and hold the same stick as the screaming figure in Jeffries‚Äô scene. What‚Äôs the significance of this?
11. If Laura knows BOB is real and only he could have known about the diary‚Äôs hiding place, then how could he not know her other secrets? Including Harold hiding the diary! She says he‚Äôll be safe but surely BOB has access to her thoughts/memories because he knows where to find the diary.
12. Not 100% sure what role the ring serves: BOB will kill Laura if he cannot possess her. So what‚Äôs the point of a ring that prevents possession? He killed her anyway. Did MIKE give her the ring? Or is it theorised that he drops the ring mistakenly (doesn‚Äôt look like it)‚Ä¶

Questions I still have unanswered about the series:

1. So what‚Äôs the significance of the Log Lady‚Äôs husband‚Äôs death?
2. Who is the butler we see in Series 2?
3. What‚Äôs the significance of the ‚Äòwind in the trees‚Äô?¬†
4. The tree gum, the pies‚Ä¶?
5. When is the gate to the Black Lodge actually open? S2 suggests it is only when Jupiter and Saturn align but the film suggests the spirits have been around long before this. Can some access it anytime without Jupiter and Saturn? Why?
6. The ‚Äòotherwold‚Äô seems to be a place that exists outside of Earth‚Äôs time-space (they all speak backwards, coffee behaves differently, there‚Äôs a time-loop in FWWM). I‚Äôm still confused about how Dale can exist in Laura‚Äôs dreams, however.¬†

Questions about retcons/errors/concerns:

1. It feels odd to have no mention of Ben despite his involvement with her (I know there was an intended scene that was not filmed)
2. Is it not a retcon to have Donna mingle with Jacques, given that she never mentioned this event in the series?
3. The Palmer household inexplicably has a different layout in FWWM compared to the series (Laura‚Äôs bedroom is different, and in the film the dining room is to the right as you enter the house, whereas this room is the lounge in the series)
4. Despite my ignorance, a major theme I loved about the series was nature‚Äôs presence, almost as a character itself, integral to the show‚Äôs exploration of consequence, agency, and . That feels missing from the film.
5. Is it not a plot convenience that Laura, after years of abuse, only discovers BOB‚Äôs real-world identity within the last 7 days of her life?

There‚Äôs a certain *charm* a rifle gets once it breaks that century old mark. They get worn in at odd angles, showing you exactly where everyone that‚Äôs ever carried it held it. 

Mine was no different, though it was a tad bit more than a century old. It had a big ‚Äú1943‚Äù stamped on it so, assuming that was accurate, it‚Äôd be 149 years old. So maybe more than a tad over. 

It had a triangle with an arrow in it stamped on top of the receiver, and some old fella once told me that meant it was an ‚Äúizhevsk,‚Äù whatever  that meant. I‚Äôm pretty sure that means it was made at the ‚Äúizhevsk‚Äù factory, and if it were a couple years ago I‚Äôd just look that up, but a stable connection is hard to come by these days and every time I *do* have one, I‚Äôve got more pressing matters to attend to. 

I *miss* the internet, I really do. But with everything else going wrong, what with that whole big war and everything, it‚Äôs probably at the bottom of my list of complaints. I miss hot coffee, and fresh cigarettes more than anything. Oh, except maybe for non-skunk beer, or those bootleg Quaaludes my cousin used to print out. 

I‚Äôd gotten used to being away from the internet and all its convenience *years* ago, lucky for me, in that *other* war we just finished, that slightly smaller yet equally unpleasant one. My brilliant self was in good old Grand Rapids, the one and only jewel of the not-at-all-famous Kent County, when our Canadian friends in the great white north flipped that switch, and I‚Äôd like to say I was visiting family, but I wasn‚Äôt. Nor was I applying for jobs, or investing in lucrative business ventures, or any number of more polite things. But no, I was there with my aforementioned cousin, scamming and siphoning money anywhere we could. I‚Äôd like to give you more details, but I‚Äôve got just barely enough pride to not not go too deep into the details there. 

You see, the country formerly known as the United States had been poking at the white bear for the better part of the last century, nicking counties and cities and municipalities whenever they could get away with it, but not full on marching troops down the road in broad daylight like they did with poor old Mexico and three quarters of the islands in the Caribbean. No, they knew our amigos to the north are *just* enough like us that a full blown blitzkrieg would go horribly enough to eliminate all public support, so trade wars and diplomatic bullying were thought to be enough. 

At least, until some beautiful Quebecois thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to literally *guillotine* an emissary out of Buffalo. And I‚Äôve gotta admit, I can‚Äôt deny the showmanship of it, but the war that came after it sucked quite a bit. 

So then the president at the time, a trust-fund pecker-head from the great city of Los Angeles, one Mr. Nathaniel Midas, decided it‚Äôd be a good idea to roll the Michigan National guard *right over* the Ambassador bridge and take every city between Windsor and Ottawa. 

Unfortunately for anyone south of the border, those clever Canadians had other ideas. You see, they‚Äôd been expecting us Yankees to make a move sooner or later, so they‚Äôd been planning for that very moment for the better part of a century at that point. 

Now if you‚Äôre neither human nor a resident of the North American continent, and I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre neither of those things if you‚Äôre actually reading this, you probably won‚Äôt know just how reliant the northern half of the old US was on Canadian power. To give you the summary of what some could write a whole essay on, it‚Äôs a lot. 

Then the good old Prime Minister Callender gives the order to flip the switch. And all of the sudden, the power grid for millions of people just turns *off.* Completely. 

On a cold February night, in the middle of the biggest snowstorm the Great Lakes had seen since the 2020s, the power just goes *off.* At the same time, a concerningly large number of paratroopers dropped into the border states, met up with the militias they‚Äôd been conveniently and secretly been training this whole time, and got to work making life horrible for everyone. Turns out, the citizens of the world‚Äôs most imperialist nation weren‚Äôt too keen on seeing the first battle on American (or formerly American) soil since the War of 1813. 

Unfortunately for me, they had a lot in mind for the Great Lakes region, and the great state of Michigan in particular. And as I said earlier, I was in Grand Rapids at the time, which I never was if I could help it. But I was there, and then boom, no more lights, no more internet, no more anything. But there was *a lot* of shooting. 

My cousin and I, being not at all keen on war fighting at this very moment, thought it‚Äôd be a pretty good idea to not be there anymore. So like millions of other people, we went south. Or at least we tried. 

Now if you don‚Äôt have a map in front of you, you can‚Äôt really go any other three cardinal directions if you‚Äôre trying to leave the most pleasant of peninsulas. East is a big lake, west is an even bigger one. North is another *much* larger lake, and then Canada, who we were all the sudden at war with, so that wasn‚Äôt a good idea either. 

The problem was the only *real* place for the literal millions of newly refugeed people to go for now was Chicago, or the bigger cities in Ohio like Toledo, or Cincinnati, or Columbus, or any of those other crap towns. 

If you aren‚Äôt human, and again I‚Äôm assuming you aren‚Äôt, you probably haven‚Äôt had the privilege of meeting a human who‚Äôd at some point called themselves American. And seeing as how only one in twenty Americans had the honor of calling themselves Michiganders *before* that big war I just mentioned, you probably haven‚Äôt met anyone from Michigan. 

To save you a whole lot of trouble reading about ancient blood feuds between states in a country that doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, going to Ohio on purpose just wasn‚Äôt an option. Chalk it up to us clinging onto whatever lingering pride we had left after getting chased out of our home. 

Chicago wasn‚Äôt really an option either, which is another story altogether that I‚Äôll omit for the time being. 

Which then leaves the smaller cities, of which there were few. I wasn‚Äôt going to Indianapolis for reasons you‚Äôll understand if you‚Äôd ever been there, and I hate Fort Wayne even more than I hate Ohio. 

So we went north. Which seems counterintuitive given the overlong spiel I‚Äôve just given you, but I promise it‚Äôd make sense if you were there. 

By now I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôre probably wondering ‚Äúwhy in the world is this guy rambling on about some war *before* First contact between two nations that don‚Äôt even exist anymore? And why did he start by rambling about an old gun in the beginning?‚Äù 

Well, I‚Äôm getting there. It‚Äôll make the complete desolation of what was formerly the most developed nation *on the planet* make a whole lot more sense.  

Where was I? Oh, so we go north. And then more north. And eventually we hit the lake, so like the sneaking thugs we were, we snuck our way *under* the mackinac bridge *across the ice* like a couple of real clever movie characters. Until we got snagged by some rebels on the way over. 

Lucky for us, they were on our side. Or at least, on the side of the county formerly known as the United States, now known as the proud ‚ÄúNorth American Republic.‚Äù 

I‚Äôd never liked that name. If it were up to me to reorganize the world‚Äôs premier superpower into a fascist dictatorship, I probably would‚Äôve picked a better name, but that‚Äôs just me. 

But those beautiful people were a sight for sore eyes, we‚Äôd ducked red maple leaf wearing special forces and milita a dozen times by then, and we were glad to see that at least some of us had been giving them hell on our behalf. 

They took us in, gave us hot food and a lukewarm shower, and we were smitten. They talked us into ‚Äúfighting for god and county‚Äù and whatever that means tends to change with who you ask. But for us, it meant finally doing something other than taking stuff from other people. And we enjoyed it, in the odd way guerilla fighters across history always have. And we were pretty good at it, too. Turns out all the sneaking and lying and running away we‚Äôd been up to made us pretty good at hit-and-running convoys of pickup trucks filled with militia fighters.

I got *real* good at shooting folks in the back, or from very far away. Now I won‚Äôt lie to you and tell you I‚Äôm some gunslinging one man army type, because I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm not too great in a straight up gunfight or proper battle, what with the lack of training and all. But I *am* rather good at ambushing and backstabbing, and a better bushwhacker you‚Äôll not find this side of the Mississippi. 

For a while there, we were enjoying ourselves. At least until we ran into actual, *real* soldiers, and then it didn‚Äôt really go our way. 

We were true believers too, did a complete 180. We found ourselves more patriotic for our god awful country than we‚Äôd ever been. Until some borged out Canadian super soldier blew my cousin‚Äôs head off, which wasn‚Äôt fun. 

It was sad, tragic even. But I won‚Äôt waste your time waxing poetic about the loss of my dear beloved cousin. He was a thief, a shooter of men and women looking the other direction, and a real rapscallion. Just like me, and we both knew we‚Äôll never deserve a eulogy. 

That being said, I did enjoy it when we finally got the better of that prick. A sniper, he was. A gentleman by the name of ‚ÄúRoland McCallister,‚Äù and I remember it only because I‚Äôm reminded of it every time I boot up my neural interface. 

Turns out that even when you cut the stabilizing implants from someone‚Äôs upper appendages, you can get a chop-doc to cut up your own arms and plant those puppies in there, but it‚Äôs *really* hard to unsync their information from the computer end of it. So every time I run a diagnostics check, or check tolerances, or set it up, or calibrate my arms for anything *at all,* I get a big ‚ÄúSergeant Roland McCallister‚Äù in the corner of my vision. 

After I‚Äôd chewed through enough stolen pain meds to kill a shire horse, not to toot my own horn or anything but I did make quite a name for myself among those on my side of the isle. Nobody you‚Äôd have heard of, by any means, but I‚Äôd soon find myself fighting with someone you‚Äôd have a higher chance of knowing. 

‚ÄúOh my god old man, can you get to the point already?‚Äù I can hear you cry. To which I would reply ‚Äúhave patience, child. I‚Äôm getting there.‚Äù 

As you may have noticed, I‚Äôm not a terribly good story teller. But I‚Äôm *very* good at spinning yarns, so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing, and you‚Äôll appreciate all this exposition going forward, I promise. 

Anyway, as you‚Äôd suspect, the good old North American Republic started winning before long. And that meant getting military supplies, weapons, equipment, the whole lot of it. Oh, and actual leadership instead of the clinically insane militia folk I‚Äôd been riding with. 

The brass sent me even farther north. To Marquette, if you know the area. Which you probably don‚Äôt. There I joined up with some vet from the Caribbean campaigns, some madman who called himself ‚Äúthe snow fox,‚Äù and we specialized in making life hell for anyone coming in or out of the Great Lakes. I killed a lot of people there, and stole even more. It was a great time, other than the incredible cold, of course. 

From there it wasn‚Äôt long before the war started going our way, and even the Canadians knew it eventually would. Their goal I suspect wasn‚Äôt *winning* per se, but more about making sure we had blood on our teeth south side of the Saint Lawrence. 

So they surrendered, as we all knew they would. But they used their holdings all across the Great Lakes region almost like a bartering chip for a better deal post-annexation. 

Not that we had time to really deal with that. 

Because *just* as negotiations were coming to a close, Christopher Douglass was born. 

‚ÄúWho in the blazes is that?‚Äù you ask? 

I‚Äôll tell you. 

The first human born on a different planet. Mars, to be precise. That ugly red planet we‚Äôd spent the fortunes of pillaged nations developing. Which *should* have been a more noteworthy achievement, had it not been for the quote-unquote ‚Äúbenevolent‚Äù Federation of Allied Species deciding to make an appearance. 

Apparently young Christopher‚Äôs birth was the very last in a series of prerequisites needed for the alien federation to make a surprise appearance. 

They practically busted through our metaphorical saloon doors and said ‚Äúhello everyone, aliens exist. Deal with it, don‚Äôt kill each other. You‚Äôve got 25 years to get your affairs in order before we give you space ships. Oh by the way, here‚Äôs a couple *million* extra-terrestrial refugees just to make sure you‚Äôre capable of *not* genociding a different species.‚Äù 

Which is a hell of a way to make an entrance, I‚Äôll admit. Though I might have been a bit more subtle, had I been in charge of an ancient intergalactic alliance of literal aliens. 

To our credit, it actually went pretty smoothly at first. At least for a while. Before that *other* war started, that really big one I‚Äôve been working my way towards.

The world goes crazy, as you‚Äôd suspect. World powers everywhere used first contact as an excuse to consolidate even more power than they already had. Russia scooped up Eastern Europe while the beaten-down west said ‚Äúhey, don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù China snagged *most* of that side of the world while India wagged a finger and said ‚Äúhey, don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù Africa hastily organized itself into their ‚ÄúPan African Coalition,‚Äù a miserable little alliance that tried to keep everyone‚Äôs hands off their resources. As it would seem they hated the rest of the world even more than they hated each other, but by how much exactly is anyone‚Äôs guess. 

Which leads me to my home, the often abbreviated NAR, the aforementioned North American Republic. 

The *real* problem with the long awaited first contact was the advisors, if you can believe that. Our good old Federation had it in their infinite rule book that the integrating world should be allowed ‚Äúten to thirty advisors per inhabited area.‚Äù They were pretty vague on what defines an ‚Äúinhabited area,‚Äù to say the least, so rather quickly the planet earth got flooded with the alien equivalent of trust fund babies, tourists, and real estate investors. 

They were particularly fond of our wood, of all things. They like to make furniture out of it. Which isn‚Äôt relevant to this story in particular, but I thought you might find it interesting. 

And then, it was November. And the NAR‚Äôs populace, in their infinite wisdom, sought fit to elect *Eddie Hill* the gaudy, irreverent, loud, fake southern accent sporting golden boy of the ‚ÄúAmerican Union Party.‚Äù He was Midas‚Äôs VP, and though the two hated each other publicly, the beloved Midas endorsed his underling, and the whack job got elected. 

President Hill was a denigator and smack-talker of great renown, and though I can‚Äôt say I cared for the man I must admit, he was rather good at it. But he made a lot of enemies, and pissed even more people off. 

So this glorious madman was giving a speech, about what nobody remembers. But he was running Midas, now the governor of California, a metric load of crap. Ribbing him for not sending his troops into what remained of Mexico under the guise of ‚Äúpacification.‚Äù 

Now you probably wouldn‚Äôt know this if you weren‚Äôt there, so I‚Äôll tell you. Part of that whole ‚Äúreorganizing a world superpower into a fascist dictatorship‚Äù I referenced earlier involved moving the power to control state national guards into the hands of their governors directly. It‚Äôs pretty handy for quickly snuffing out resistance here, and running protestors over with tanks there. 

So there he was, my president, gabbing away at the *former* president, calling him a yellow-bellied coward and what not, when some magnificent human blows the poor man‚Äôs head *smooth off* mid speech, on live television. 

Oh boy, did it get wild then. 

Militias on all sides of the spectrum, all across the world but mainly in the old USA saw that as a divine signal to start their glorious revolution right then and there. 

Then there were peaceful protests, and then peaceful protests turned into not so peaceful protests, which turned into riots, which turned into uprisings, which turned into full blown secessions. 

California seceded with the rest of the pacific coast. Then Canada seceded, not two years after they‚Äôd been made a state. Then Cuba, then Hati, then Jamaica, and the rest of the Caribbean that had been slowly conquered over the last hundred years. And the NAR, even being a superpower with military bases *on an entirely different planet,* managed to get kicked in the pants over and over and over. 

And good old Michigan, who hadn‚Äôt yet recovered from that other war we talked about, went *right* back to fighting. Canadians and Michiganders went hand in hand to throw Molotovs at tanks and I gotta say, it was pretty poetic. 


And now that I‚Äôve explained to you where I was, and when I was doing it, I can tell you what all it was that I was doing. 

And then there was me, who‚Äôd spent the short time post-war stealing anything that was worth money and not nailed down everywhere between Detroit and Green Bay. 

And that finally, leads me back to my old rifle. 

This is the region‚Äôs *second* war in the last decade, and all the good guns were taken. A real shame, really. For every well armed militiaman with a 60 year old AR-15, an old US issue chest rig, and whatever side arm their dad bought the decade prior, there were five with old bolt guns and lever actions. If you had anything other than a .22, you were lucky. 

Now I‚Äôd love to say that I was on *either* side of the conflict, I really would. But I wasn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt particularly care for my country at that point, and I held no allegiances with any of the hundred different rebel groups. 

Constant warfare was however *very* good for those in the business of taking things from other people, and I am not ashamed at all to say I fell into that group. 

I‚Äôd shacked up with a band of straight up bandits, like some gang in the old west, only we were half human and half bug-eyed six-armed alien refugees. 

We were watching the trails outside of a little town in the lower peninsula called Baldwin. It‚Äôd been a logging town a few hundred years ago, and was a pile of garbage by that time of this story. Every real road between here and Sioux Falls was watched by either soldiers, or militia, or bandits, or otherwise people more than willing to put bullets in you in exchange for whatever you‚Äôve got on your person. So if you were smart, you stayed off them. 

Four humans, lightly armed. Easy pickings. We didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but one of them was equipped with the monetary equivalent of a small nations GDP when it came to their military issue cybernetic augmentations. 

Now if you know humans, and I‚Äôm assuming you do if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôll know we‚Äôre quite famous for sticking our meat sacks full of metal and hydraulics, and stuff that makes us into nightmare fuel for your feeble little alien bodies. All of the horrible stories you‚Äôve heard about us are true, and if they‚Äôre at all exaggerated, it‚Äôs to make us look *less* scary. 

‚ÄúOne of ‚Äòem‚Äôs only got a pistol,‚Äù Mark said, he was an old grey-haired sod, and the de facto leader of our little outfit. 

‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs borged,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhy else would she come out with only that?‚Äù 

‚ÄúCause she‚Äôs stupid,‚Äù Mark answered. 

‚ÄúFair enough,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll get lucky.‚Äù 

I raised that old rifle of mine, and looked down the scope I‚Äôd mounted on it. 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got a bow on her shoulder,‚Äù I added. 

Mark scoffed. ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù he blurted. 

‚ÄúSeems like something you might want to know, capn‚Äô.‚Äù 

Now the appearance of an old fashioned bow and arrow might not seem outwardly threatening to you at the moment, but it‚Äôll be of great importance here shortly. 

If you aren‚Äôt yet aware what ‚Äúborg‚Äù or ‚Äúborged‚Äù means, it‚Äôs shorthand for ‚Äúcyborg,‚Äù which is a colloquial term for those with mechanical bodily enhancements. Many names were given to those sorts of folks shortly after there started being those sorts of folks, but no name really stuck. The term ‚Äúaugmented individuals‚Äù was the clinical term, but if you know humans, you‚Äôll know we aren‚Äôt often fond of doing what we‚Äôre told. So we called them a million other things, mostly from the stories we‚Äôd read or movies we watched. ‚ÄúPost human‚Äù and ‚Äúchromed‚Äù were fashionable for a time but eventually the old fashioned ‚Äúcyborg‚Äù fell back into use, which eventually just shortened to ‚ÄúBorg‚Äù because two syllables is one too many. 

And then, there was a gunshot. One of the humans down trail, a younger man carrying a beaten old AK of some kind, doubled over as red enveloped the underside of his flannel shirt. 

A gut shot. *Sloppy.* 

We were supposed to stop them first, we were out here robbing after all, not bushwhacking folks. So I looked over to see which trigger happy nut started the fight. 

I saw Gjarsh, who looked to be a cockroach the size of a gorilla, holding an old rifle of his own. A human one, but not as old as mine. His species had an actual name, but nobody could pronounce it. Everyone just called them ‚Äúdrones‚Äù, and they‚Äôd been fighting in a great big civil war light years away, and they were *extremely* ugly. Two of his arms not holding his rifle were loose at his side, but the other two held a machete, and a bottle of whisky. 

Mark fired his old M16, it had a proper sight on it, one you could land good shots with. He hit the other young man in the chest a few times, and he died quick. 

Saz opened up with that machine gun of his, some old belt-fed with a name that was half numbers. He was a hairy man, at least I think he was a man. I didn‚Äôt know him long enough to ask. I think his species where called ‚Äúharaz,‚Äù or some other word that sounded like a sneeze. He was every bit of eight feet tall, and if I‚Äôm being honest, kind of looked like a werewolf. He cut the third traveler in half, an older guy with a patchy beard. He slumped over, dropping the pack he‚Äôd been carrying, and the shotgun slung on his shoulder. 

I centered my scope on the woman‚Äôs head, and fired. 

My aim was true, and the bullet smacked her in her temple. 

The more observant among you might‚Äôve taken note by now that my rifle was *very* old, even compared to the junk that had been sent into this war. And you‚Äôd be right, but there‚Äôs a reason I kept it this long. 

Like I said, *a lot* of old guns got taken out of closets for this fight. Some of them were demonstrably better than others. The old ought-sixes and thirty-thirties were outdated sure, but their power made up for that. 308 was still old, but still used. Easy enough to find, and bigger than the more common intermediate cartridges. The extra oomf made fighting folks with armor a bit easier, too. 

But 7.62x54r, the ancient round used in my particular old rifle, was *comically* outdated, and not super easy to find. Fortunately for me though, our good friends the Russians *still* used it for their heavy machine guns, and they shipped quite a lot of it over here to us during that war with Canada. Those guns and those bullets found their way into the hands of anyone willing to take it, and it was conveniently almost always armor piercing. 

So my old rifle was always loaded with armor piercing rounds, and as such were *almost* always enough to punch their way through the subdermal armor most borgs had under their skin. 

But I wasn‚Äôt lucky. I watched *nothing* happen as that round stuck her skull, other than a *very* angry set of beady brown eyes suddenly pointed in my direction. 

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù I said, unsure of what exploitative I should use at the realization of my immediate death. 

*‚ÄùBorg!‚Äù* Gjarsh howled in that scratchy voice those people all had. ‚ÄúBorg! Borg!‚Äù 

*I noticed* I thought, but didn‚Äôt say. 

While the others were too shocked to react, the woman pulled the bow from her shoulder, and then nocked an arrow at a speed almost too fast to even follow. Saz opened up with his machine gun, and a couple rounds bounced off of her chest and abdomen while she side-stepped out of his burst. 

The woman drew the bow, and loosed. 

Now, I‚Äôd assume few if any of you have ever seen a proper post-human war bow. And let me tell you, a more terrifying thing you‚Äôd find hard to find. 

Us humans *love* our slug throwers, as you call them. Still do, even after we fully integrated into the federation. Most species like to use stuff like lasers, or plasma, or boiling hot gas, or any number of much quieter things. But we like gunpowder. I think a primal part of our brains just *loves* the acrid smell of it, and *longs* for the ringing in our ears that comes after. The only downside, they‚Äôre awful loud. You can load up subsonic rounds and slap a suppressor on there sure, but it‚Äôll *never* be quiet. 

A bow and arrow on the other hand? 

Humans aren‚Äôt the only culture to develop the bow and arrow, not by any stretch of the imagination. Seems slinging a string onto a stick is a pretty ubiquitous way of killing things too far to throw sharper things at. So we *loved* our bow and arrows, even well into the days of gunpowder. And we kept them into the days of space travel and cyborgs too, only in magnitudes more powerful. 

I asked her after this little scuffle, and the woman told me that this war bow in particular had a draw weight of one *thousand* pounds. 

Your average hunting bow‚Ä¶ is less than one hundred. 

Imagine if you will, the *sound* of that arrow coming at you. An arrow the size of your forearm, made out of tungsten steel just so it doesn‚Äôt *shatter* behind the weight of the bow, coming at you at a speed just *barely* south of the sound barrier. 

It struck Saz in the chest, and didn‚Äôt even slow down. It went through the tree behind him too, struck that poor bug Gjarsh behind it, and blew off a sizable chunk of his driver‚Äôs side thorax. He dropped the whisky bottle, and it shattered on the ground. It was good whisky too, a real shame. 

I worked the bolt on my rifle, wondering if it was even worth it. 

Mark got up, and tried to flank her. He tried to suppress her by hurling a load of lead at her chest, but it didn‚Äôt matter. She hurled another arrow at his head, and it took it clean off at the shoulders. 

I centered my crosshair, and took a shot at her hand, hoping to at least make her drop the bow. She loosed an arrow first, but noticed she didn‚Äôt pull it back far. 

‚ÄúAh,‚Äù I said again, watching the arrow come my way.

It landed in my shoulder and sounded like a minivan getting smacked by a semi truck. It stuck about three quarters of the way through, and just stayed there. 

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù I said, a lot louder than I had earlier. I dropped my rifle, I hoped I didn‚Äôt break the scope. 

I hit the ground, and found myself wishing I‚Äôd died in that other war. 

I heard a lot of steps then, sounded like a horse if I‚Äôm being honest. They came rushing at me at a speed I thought must be impossible, and then hand grabbed me as the ankle. 

‚ÄúAh!‚Äù I screamed, much louder than before, and more shrill than I had hoped. 

I looked at her from the other side of my own body, and assed the form in front of me. 

She was tall, but not hulking. Hair short and brown, worn tight over the ears. Her skin was noticeably paler under her neckline where a uniform collar would normally ride. 

*A veteran* I thought, hoping that observation might help me talk my way out of this. 

‚ÄúYou are cyborged, yes?‚Äù she asked in a near comically thick Russian accent. 

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I lied. 

I tried to scan her face, to see if I could find who she was. I didn‚Äôt have *a lot* of cool stuff stitched in my noggin, but my neural interface was set up real good, had a lot of stuff I wasn‚Äôt supposed to have. 

My whole vision went black for a moment, ringing struck my ears, and a metallic taste came in my throat. It left just a second later, my vision and all going back to normal, but felt like an hour. 

‚ÄúYou will lie to me again?‚Äù she asked in a harsher voice, hoisting me up so that we were almost eye level. 

‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù I said, thinking honesty might be my best option. 

She laughed, and dropped me on my head. 

‚ÄúYou did not shoot first,‚Äù she started. ‚ÄúWhy. You have poor ambush, marksman should shoot first.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt supposed to be an ambush,‚Äù I admitted, clutching the fire in my shoulder. ‚ÄúWe were just gonna rob you, *and* I was gonna tell them *not* to rob you, but they just started shooting anyway.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIs this the truth?‚Äù she asked. And I can‚Äôt fault her for asking. 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, being honest. 

I *was* going to tell them not to attack. I was gonna tell them all that I‚Äôd seen people like her in that other war, and that I‚Äôd rather not get beaten to death with my own severed arms. But obviously, I didn‚Äôt get that far. 

‚ÄúIs this a lie?‚Äù she asked, and again, can‚Äôt fault her for doing so. I was a liar, after all. 

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù I answered. 

‚ÄúIs *this* a lie?‚Äù she echoed, and then, it was starting to get old. 

‚ÄúNot at all,‚Äù I said again as the pain in my shoulder started to almost turn numb as the adrenaline started pouring through me. 

I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to get out of this, and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I even could. I was pretty sure I was going to die. 

‚ÄúI believe you,‚Äù she said, and I felt my heart rate slow. The pain started coming back then, and part of me wished she‚Äôd just split my skull and been done with it. 

I rolled over so I could get comfortable before I bled out, and was surprised to hear her talking again without killing me first. 

She dug her finger into her temple where I‚Äôd shot her, blood still dripping down it, and pulled the pancaked remnant of my bullet from her skin. 

‚ÄúThat was a good shot.‚Äù she said, and I admit, I felt a little proud. ‚ÄúThat would have killed me if I did not have good armor. You would have shot first if you meant to kill me.‚Äù 

Part of me really appreciated her understanding and reasoning, and the other part of me was amazed she was being so *rational* and *mature* about me only shooting her in the head because my friends pressured me into it. 

‚ÄúI appreciate your understanding,‚Äù I said through pained grunts. ‚ÄúSorry I shot you in the head.‚Äù 

She grunted in a way I assumed was her equivalent of a nose-exhale almost laugh. 

‚ÄúI am sorry I killed your fiends ,‚Äù she said, sounding close to honest. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt nice.‚Äù 

I wasn‚Äôt lying there, either. They weren‚Äôt nice, not that I was much nicer than them. But I wasn‚Äôt the one trying to just gun people down in the woods, if that helps my case. 

‚ÄúYou fight with people you do not like?‚Äù she asked, more of an accusation. 

‚ÄúRobbers aren‚Äôt typically nice people,‚Äù I told her. 

She stood there silent for a second, and I wondered if she was deciding if she should club me to death with my arms, or my legs. 

‚ÄúYou fight in Toronto war?‚Äù she asked me, and that phrase gave her away as someone who *didn‚Äôt* fight in it. 

‚ÄúSure did,‚Äù I said, telling her the truth. No sense in lying about it, tons of people did. 

‚ÄúFor who?‚Äù she questioned. 

I figured that given her accent and all, and the fact that Russia and the NAR were pals, that we‚Äôd been on the same side. 

‚ÄúUncle Sam,‚Äù I said, now grabbing the arrow in my shoulder, trying but losing the stomach to pull it out. I hoped it‚Äôd make me bleed out quicker. 

She grunted in an approving sentiment, and nodded her head a bit. 

*Now we‚Äôre getting somewhere* I thought, hoping I might find a way to weasel my way out of this on account of our similar allegiances. 

‚ÄúFor who?‚Äù she said again, making apparent her affinity for repetitive phrases. 

‚ÄúColonel Carson* I told her, seeing no point in lying to her. 

‚ÄúThe Snow Fox?‚Äù she asked me, with a hint of wonder in her voice. 

I got a little excited, she‚Äôd clearly heard of the old crazy sod. I was a tad less terrified then, hoping I could work my way to not dying, after all. 

‚ÄúThe very same,‚Äù I started, speaking softly in the way wounded men do. ‚ÄúColonel Carson, great guy. You‚Äôd like him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBushwacker,‚Äù she said accusingly, and I was surprised she knew the term. ‚ÄúYou shoot people while they sleep.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much safer that way,‚Äù I said. 

She chuckled again, and put a boot on my chest. 

*Here it comes* I thought, closing my eyes and preparing myself for the feeling of my entire chest being caved in. 

She yanked the arrow from my shoulder, *very* rapidly. 

I won‚Äôt lie, I yelped a little bit when she did it. 

I opened me eyes, baffled she didn‚Äôt kill me, and put out a hand. I hesitantly grabbed it, more so afraid she‚Äôd change her mind if I didn‚Äôt, and she all but threw me to my feet. 

‚ÄúYou will help me,‚Äù she said sternly. ‚ÄúAnd I will give you medicine.‚Äù 

*‚ÄùWhat?‚Äù* I blurted, not trying to hide my surprise. 

‚ÄúMy guide is dead, I cannot get where I am going without a guide. Not without risk.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, well,‚Äù I began, unsure of how to address her dead friends. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm uh, sorry my‚Ä¶ compatriots killed your friends.‚Äù 

She grunted again. 

‚ÄúThey were not my friends, do not be sorry,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey were not nice, not good people.‚Äù 

She put the arrow she‚Äôd pulled out of my back into the quiver that hung on her hip, and shifted the bow farther onto her shoulder. I noticed I‚Äôd only grazed her hand where I‚Äôd shot at her. 

‚ÄúThese rebels are not good people, but we share similar allegiances,‚Äù she said, answering what I was wondering before I could ask. 

‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre a separatist?‚Äù I asked, surprised she wasn‚Äôt working on behalf of the government. 

‚ÄúTechnically,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúWe have a common enemy, so they help me get through. But I do not like them.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah, rebels tend to be pricks,‚Äù I replied. 

‚ÄúWhy are you not rebel?‚Äù she asked me. ‚ÄúRebels can use good marksman, you waste effort robbing people. Shameful.‚Äù 

I felt a little hurt, but I couldn‚Äôt disagree. But I *really* didn‚Äôt like the rebels, the lot of pricks they were, and I wasn‚Äôt gonna let her talk me into it, 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve shed enough blood for this country, I think,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good with just robbing people, there‚Äôs no point in fighting for anyone anyway.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou fight for money,‚Äù she said, reusing that accusatory tone. ‚ÄúThis is better?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI like money more than I like fighting for old men,‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúBut for what it‚Äôs worth, I like robbing the feds more than I like robbing you guys.‚Äù 

She pondered me for a moment, and a wave of understanding came across her face. 

‚ÄúFair enough,‚Äù she grunted. ‚ÄúBut still, my guide is dead and you will help me. It is fair you help me, and I do not kill you.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFair enough,‚Äù I answered, not seeing the point in arguing with her. 

Did I want to help a Russian cyborg go somewhere to do something with secessionist rebels? Not at all. Did I want to be strangled with my own intestines? Even less.

‚ÄúI can get you from here to Omaha without touching a road,‚Äù I said, only lying a little bit. ‚ÄúAside from crossing them, of course.‚Äù 

She grunted in approval, and grabbed something from her pocket. It looked like a needle. 

‚ÄúWhat is that?‚Äù I asked, not sure what answer I was hoping for. 

‚ÄúLittle doctor robots,‚Äù she answered, and I assumed she meant the horribly expensive medical nanobots that came in clusters filled with ‚Äúprintable meat.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, thank you,‚Äù I said, not sure how to phrase that more eloquently. 

She stuck the needle into me right next to where the arrow had, and it stung almost worse than the arrow. She pulled the arrow back out, and almost immediately after I felt those miraculous machines stitching me back together. I‚Äôd only had the honor of experiencing this effect once before, back in the other war after getting a gut shot from the same sniper that had killed my cousin. I nabbed the syringe from the sergeant‚Äôs first aid kit. 

‚ÄúWe go to Texas,‚Äù she declared. 

*‚ÄùTexas?‚Äù* I asked through the pain of my arm going back together. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI go to meet a colonel in the SRF. I have sensitive information that cannot risk being transferred by data.‚Äù 

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you just fly there?‚Äù I asked her, annoyed she‚Äôd bothered walking in the first place. 

‚ÄúThe skies are not safe from here to Colorado. I must go at least there.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt fly *at all?*‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot without risk. This cannot be risked.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs that important, huh?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said with a twinge of irritation, and I decided to shelve my zealous comments. ‚ÄúIt is that important.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOkay, okay,‚Äù I said defensively. ‚ÄúWhat is the SRF, another rebel group?‚Äù 

‚ÄúSpecial Raiding Force,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúCalifornian. Training militia from west Texas to Arizona. Disrupting supply lines. Important work. I must see him.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI believe you,‚Äù I told her, and I believe I did. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take you, no problem. No problem at all.‚Äù 

She stared at me again for a second. Too long, as it always was and would continue to be. 

‚ÄúDo not shoot me in the back, bushwacker.‚Äù 

She walked away, and turned her back to me. Almost like she was *begging* me to put a bullet in her spine. I reached down to pick up my rifle, checking to see if I‚Äôd broken the scope. 

I hadn‚Äôt. 

I leveled the rifle on an arm that felt like it was on fire, but worked as good as it ever could. I cycled the bolt, and dropped the spent casing. I topped the magazine off, and held it in my arms, testing if the weight of it made my arm hurt any more than the little doctor robots did. 

I thought about shooting her in the back, if only to make her turn around and plug me in the forehead. 

It‚Äôd surely be quicker than whatever lies ahead. 

She turned around to face me again, and I wondered if she could read my thoughts. 

‚ÄúBut I would be disappointed if you did not try.‚Äù

So ayun, 21F ako, college student sa Manila, tapos nakilala ko si A, 32M, sa Bumble. At first, di ko naman siya sineryoso‚Äîparang trip lang, swipe-swipe, kilig-kilig. Pero nagulat ako kasi he was actually so easy to talk to. Ang mature niyang kausap, hindi bastos, tapos parang sobrang invested sa mga kwento ko, like legit nakikinig. Nagtagal kami sa chatting, tapos ayun, nagkita kami IRL after mga 2 weeks.

BTW‚Äîthis is my first time dating someone this much older than me.. Like, usually ka-age ko lang or isang taon lang tanda. Kaya nung una, kinabahan talaga ako. Pero naisip ko, baka mas okay kasi mas alam na niya ang gusto niya, mas stable, mas mature. Well‚Ä¶ or so I thought.

First date namin, super chill‚Äîcoffee lang sa QC area. Pero after that, we started hanging out more, tapos naging thing na namin ‚Äòyung video calls every night, random kwentuhan, padala ng food during exam week.

Pero laging may disclaimer: ‚Äúdi pa ako ready for a relationship‚Äù daw kasi galing siya sa long-term breakup‚Äîtwo years ago pa. Like, huh? Gets ko naman yung healing, pero two years? Pero sweet siya lagi?

1jvxkm0,https://i.redd.it/zfqqq2nib0ue1.png,2003 Misaka Expansion VIII MS [Misaka Sports],"Introducing the 2003 Misaka Expansion VIII MS: The Midlife Crisis That‚Äôs Actually Fun

Meet the 2003 Misaka Expansion VIII MS, the automotive equivalent of a high-octane energy drink‚Äîguaranteed to rev up your heart and make you question the validity of your life choices. While other cars whisper ‚Äúcomfort,‚Äù the Expansion VIII MS shouts, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for speed, thrills, and just a dash of chaos!‚Äù Sorry, Hirochi, but your ‚Äúreliable rally sedan‚Äù vibes are no match for this adrenaline monster.

Under the hood, you‚Äôll find a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four engine that cranks out around 282 horsepower, launching you from 0-100 km/h in a breathtaking 5.05 seconds. Meanwhile, the Sunburst might take its sweet time, perfecting the art of being ‚Äúadequate‚Äù while you blast past in a cloud of excitement.

Driving the Misaka is an experience rather than just a means of getting from A to B. With its rally-bred roots, navigating corners feels like a thrilling dance where gravity takes a backseat, and the all-wheel-drive system keeps you glued to the asphalt, rendering the Sunburst‚Äôs more pedestrian handling pointless. Plus, its aggressive design‚Äîcomplete with a front bumper that screams ‚Äúlook at me‚Äù and a rear wing that has more attitude than the guy who thinks he can out-accelerate you at the stoplight‚Äîonly adds to the exhilarating experience!

inside, the Expansion VIII MS embraces its raw racing spirit with a minimalist setup that feels more like a cockpit than a cozy cab. This isn‚Äôt a place for leisurely conversations about the best coffee blends‚Äîthis is where you harness the thrill of the drive, much unlike the Sunburst, which beckons you to relax and enjoy a soothing ride.

And owning this beast? It‚Äôs a ticket into a vibrant subculture of turbocharged enthusiasts, where the only acceptable debate revolves around who has the best aftermarket parts. Mispronouncing ‚ÄúTommi Makinen‚Äù might get you some side-eyes, but hey, at least you‚Äôre not getting side-eyed for driving a glorified grocery getter posing as a Sports Car like the Sunburst.

In summary, the 2003 Misaka Expansion VIII MS isn‚Äôt just a car; it‚Äôs an adrenaline-fueled adventure that leaves the Hirochi Sunburst eating your dust. So strap yourself in, pop that can of excitement, and embrace the thrilling chaos‚Äîbecause when it comes to performance cars, it‚Äôs not the destination that matters; it‚Äôs how fast you get there and how many hearts you leave racing in your wake!

I'm a 19-year-old student from Lithuania, and I'm looking for female friends from Europe or even Lithuania who would like to chat and maybe even become good friends.

I'm really into art! Whenever I have free time, I love drawing and painting. I enjoy visiting art galleries, going to the theater, and watching movies. I once volunteered at a theater, which made me fall in love with acting and performance arts. Besides that, I love watching all kinds of movies and series, especially about history, politics, and nature but I also enjoy something fun and lighthearted. Right now, I‚Äôm really into the series *Cunk on Earth*.

I love reading books, from classics to psychology. My favorite literature is Lithuanian, and my favorite book is *T≈´la*.

Music is also a big part of my life. I listen to all kinds of genres, from classical and jazz to electronic music. Some of my favorite artists are Aphex Twin, The Smiths, Kamani≈≥ ≈†ilelis, Alina Orlova, The Be Good Tanyas, and many more.

I‚Äôm always curious and love learning new things, so I enjoy reading about history, philosophy, and psychology.

I also love going on walks whether it's strolling through the old town, walking in parks, or by the river. In summer, I enjoy cycling, wandering through fields and meadows, swimming in lakes, and watching the sunrise and sunset.

Oh, and I‚Äôm a huge coffee fan, it‚Äôs basically my hobby!

I also adore cats! I have one myself, so expect lots of cat pictures from me. :D

The cushions of the chairs arranged around the coffee table were stuffed with human hair. The sconce stems lining the walls were crafted from human bones. Hubal sat at his uncle‚Äôs desk and scanned the long rectangular room. Overhead hung an unlit chandelier, and this too was constructed from the bones of murdered slaves.

It was three days since Salamander Truth‚Äôs funeral, and since the old man‚Äôs death Hubal had been unable to pull himself from the study‚Äîlining every space of wall not covered by framed photos or paintings were master-crafted shelves, pushed into the walls themselves, and sitting on those shelves was a perfectly kept selection of books ranging in genre from medical texts to philosophy to reputable literature bound in the leathered skin of the dead. Not a flat surface meant for them was empty.

The room was quiet, save Hubal‚Äôs tapping of his filthy nails on the desk. The only entrance to the place stood opposite where Hubal sat‚Äîarranged halfway between himself and the ornate double doors was the sitting area with those stuffed chairs; standing sentry there on the coffee table was a narrow vase containing a single white lily.

Hubal reached for the bottle of red wine there on the desk and poured himself a glass into a tumbler. He knocked it back and when he sat it back on the table, half gone, those double doors cracked open, and a head peered in at him.

He waved them in, and a scrawny man entered the study with a bucket full of cleaning supplies swinging in the crook of his arm; the cleaner wore plain clothes and a slave collar and kept his eyes averted as he came to the coffee table, sat the bucket on the Moroccan trellis rug, and began to dust the table with cloth.

Sipping at his wine, Hubal watched the man go about his work‚Äîthe slave started at the table, examined the level of water in the white lily‚Äôs vase, batted the cushions of the chairs, then began wiping the bookshelves with his cloth.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù called Hubal, and the man froze in his work, cloth frozen in a fist. ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù said the slaver.

The slave glanced back at his undone task.

‚ÄúCome here, now,‚Äù said Hubal.

The slave moved quickly, approached the desk, ‚ÄúWhat can I do for you?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúDo you know how Uncle Sal received his name? His last name.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was the tree, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù asked the slave.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve heard it!‚Äù Hubal clapped then began to refill the tumbler of wine. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the cherry tree in the plaza! There‚Äôs even a plaque out there for visitors.‚Äù

The slave nodded briskly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read it once or twice.‚Äù

Hubal tilted the bottle of wine to stop himself from pouring and then asked, ‚ÄúOh? Who taught you how to do that?‚Äù

Immediately the slave opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came.

Hubal grinned and tapped his nose with his forefinger and barked a laugh and continued pouring his tumbler full to the rim. Like a child, he mouth-sucked the tension off the top of the glass then recapped the wine and set it aside. ‚ÄúYou know then that the cherry tree has that big mark on its trunk from his axe?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the slave.

The slaver was grinning and his eyes shone from drunkenness; he couched himself in the desk chair and put his arms out wide, so they hung out broadly from him. ‚ÄúHe could not tell a lie. He started at the tree with his axe, and upon being caught, he was accosted by his father. Uncle Sal said, ‚ÄòI cannot tell a lie.‚Äô That is how he came by his surname. Honestly.‚Äù Hubal sniffed then rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúHe was a good man, of course. Of course, he was a good man, and no one knew generosity better than him. Sorry.‚Äù Hubal wiped at his eyes, but when he locked his gaze with the slave‚Äôs, each of Hubal‚Äôs eyes looked dry enough. ‚ÄúHe was my uncle. Actually, of course. But he told everyone to call him Uncle Sal. Good man. Come,‚Äù he motioned the slave forward, ‚ÄúCome drink with me.‚Äù

He grabbed an empty tumbler with the wine, a twin of his own glass. He poured it a quarter full.

‚ÄúGo on and take some and just listen to me harp on.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù said the slave‚Äîit seemed that he might shake his head, but those micromovements, possibly imagined, could scarcely be seen.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù laughed Hubal, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lonely, and of course I try to keep the rule of never drinking alone. Look at me! Who‚Äôs going to reprimand you? It‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù asked the slave.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Hubal leaned down to open one of the lower drawers of the desk and removed a book of matches and a sleeve of cigarettes. He lit one and began smoking. He watched the slave lift the tumbler he pushed to him and continued, ‚ÄúUncle Sal never liked it when I smoked in here. He said it wasn‚Äôt good for books. Of course, he‚Äôs gone now.‚Äù He shrugged and took another drag then reached for another cigarette and handed it to the slave.

The slave took it, setting his cleaning cloth on the desk; Hubal lingered at the rag and puffed and leaned back again in the chair.

Then he jerked forward, ‚ÄúMy apologies, really,‚Äù said Hubal. He reached for the matches and lit the cigarette sticking from the slave‚Äôs mouth then shook the match out and grinned. ‚ÄúGo on and drink it. Tell me what you think of it. It‚Äôs from long before,‚Äù he motioned all around, trailing smoke from his right hand, ‚ÄúAll this. Incredibly expensive.‚Äù

Putting his nose to the wine, the slave sniffed and then offered another glance at the master who nodded eagerly. The slave drank the wine and made a face.

‚ÄúGood?‚Äù

The slave nodded then began to drag on the cigarette given to him.

Hubal‚Äôs gaze drifted to the books, the chandelier, the rug‚Äîhe angled over the desk, putting his hands together so his forearms formed a triangle with his chest. He nodded, ‚ÄúMy uncle was a good man, indeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was,‚Äù agreed the slave.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the cherry tree though. That‚Äôs why it grows bent at an angle and only gives half the fruit it might otherwise. His father could have cleared the plot, but he kept it, and then when Uncle Sal took over, he kept it too and had it roped off for public viewing. It‚Äôs a symbol. Of course, symbols are very important.‚Äù Hubal stared at the collar the slave wore; it was a rugged metal thing with a red flickering light. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt that thing ever get itchy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the slave drank greedily from his glass, ‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù

Hubal adjusted to remove something from his pocket. It was a slaver‚Äôs switch. ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù he commanded.

The slave froze upon seeing the thing in the other man‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúLean down so I can get it.‚Äù

The slave abided.

Hubal took the switch to the back of the collar, ‚ÄúYours is tighter than most. There it is!‚Äù he called.

The collar clicked open then fell away from the man‚Äôs throat, leaving behind a callus of skin.

‚ÄúGo on and rub it. I bet that will feel much better now.‚Äù Hubal took the collar and set it on the desk with his own glass of wine.

The slave abided once more and scrubbed at the sides of his neck with the heel of the hand holding his cigarette.

‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the slave.

Hubal took a deep gulp from his glass and then drew long from his cigarette.

The slave mirrored the master.

Hubal went into the drawer of the desk again and withdrew a flat image, a photograph of twenty-four individuals lined up against a wall, staggered as though for an event photo. Center stage was a bearded, younger Uncle Salamander Truth. The other twenty-three people in the photo were his favorites‚Äîhis personal slaves and entertainment, each one collared and grinning with only their mouths. Furthest to the left was a young woman and a young man; the woman was arched over and holding onto the man‚Äôs sleeve‚Äîthe man grinned doubly so than the others, for he wore a clown tattoo on his face. He had no ears. ‚ÄúSee this?‚Äù Hubal asked the slave.

The slave craned over to see.

The master flicked the picture‚Äôs corner while holding it up to the slave‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúKnew I recognized them,‚Äù said Hubal. He sighed and dropped the photo onto the table and spat violently at the space between his legs. Hubal leaned back in his chair. ‚ÄúAll of this talk of honest Uncle Sal.‚Äù He shook his head, ‚ÄúAll of this talk of him and his honesty and so I wonder, why have you done this?‚Äù he asked.

The slave raised his brow and opened his mouth as if to speak, but clapped it shut as the master continued.

‚ÄúWhy is it that when I came in here and saw you pilfering cigarettes and wine, you overpowered me to remove your collar? All this talk of honesty, and you go and do a thing like that. Why have you done that? Can you explain?‚Äù Hubal waited for an answer.

The slave stood frozen, eyes wide from understanding.

Hubal returned to the drawer a final time to produce a pistol, and he shot the slave in the face‚Äîthe man‚Äôs body smacked the floor. The wine glass clattered, and the slaver moved to stand over the prone man. He stared into the gurgling mess he‚Äôd made then reached for the bottle of wine and uncapped it and moved across the room with the mouth between his lips, turning its bottom up high; he tossed the cap over his shoulder.

He shoved through the double doors and left the study.

\*\*\*

¬†

Time passed‚Äîthere were no windows in this underground facility, so it became impossible to tell when one day began and the last ended without Hoichi looking at the handheld device that X had given him: the phone. It was touchscreen and worked much the same as any of the tablets Hoichi had seen in his days outside of this strange place‚Äîthough the old tech was bulky and older, much older.

Weeks. Weeks had gone by and Hoichi readily vocalized his surprise and elation at the amount of music he found on the phone. He‚Äôd found an artist by the name of Nat King Cole that he enjoyed thoroughly and often danced, poorly swinging his arms around the empty room he‚Äôd been given by the odd man called X. He'd become so familiar with the crooner‚Äôs songs that he often mimed their lyrics in an exaggerated manner with his lips as they played and sometimes, with total abandon, he belted the words out, so they reverberated off the metal walls of his cell.

It was a cell in many ways.

X allowed Hoichi to travel certain hallways of the facility, but others were sealed off by large doors which resembled the ones he‚Äôd passed through at the entrance of the bunker. Often times, X left through one of those otherwise closed doors, so Hoichi was alone for stretches.

Earlier, while Hoichi recovered from his injuries in bed, he asked questions of the man called X. Questions like: ‚ÄúWhere are we exactly?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan I leave?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAm I dead‚Äîis this heaven or hell?‚Äù

X, who lounged in the seat adjacent the clown in total silence whenever he came to visit, seemed to find the last question particularly amusing even though he did not laugh; the corners of his mouth darted up for a millisecond and then his expression became neutral immediately. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt heaven nor hell,‚Äù said X, ‚ÄúThis is an old clubhouse‚Äîa bunker. One of many that was constructed before the deluge, as you‚Äôve called it. It was a place for us captains of industry. And our friends and families.‚Äù Hoichi had long given up on deciphering how X was able to speak without opening his mouth; whenever he prodded the strange man about it, he received no answer, no matter the frustration.

‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt there more people here?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many people should be here?‚Äù asked X.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù the clown sighed, ‚ÄúYou said there‚Äôs a woman down here with you, right? Eliza? You said her name was Eliza, and you said it was because of her that you came to help me. I didn‚Äôt misremember that, did I?‚Äù

X nodded mechanically, ‚ÄúEliza is here.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I speak to her?‚Äù

‚ÄúLater,‚Äù said X.

Hoichi looked over his injuries and rubbed his head and hissed. ‚ÄúOnce I can walk without my head splitting, I need to get back to my sister. She‚Äôs probably worried sick about me.‚Äù The clown paused and his expression flattened upon examining X‚Äôs still face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about her too.‚Äù He raised himself in the bed and still cradled his left hand. ‚ÄúCould you take me, maybe?‚Äù

‚ÄúOutside?‚Äù asked X.

The clown nodded.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the man, definitively. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go outside. We don‚Äôt go outside. Ever.‚Äù

Hoichi stared at X‚Äôs unblinking face and asked, ‚ÄúHow long have you been down here?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever had popcorn?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey‚Äî

X reached out for Hoichi‚Äôs right hand and helped him out of bed.

They moved out of the room, the clown using X for support in his steps. ‚ÄúI still get dizzy,‚Äù said Hoichi.

‚ÄúYou should be dead.‚Äù

The clown squinted at the man as they moved into the hallway.

‚ÄúNo, sorry. I mean only that your injuries should have killed you. I still don‚Äôt understand it. Now here, lean on me as much as you need, and I‚Äôll show you popcorn.‚Äù

The hall was as stark as when Hoichi first entered the room. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen it before,‚Äù offered the clown, ‚ÄúThey make it at those roadside stalls in metal pans! Lots of butter.‚Äù

X took the clown down the hall, ignoring the response, and Hoichi peered in through the doors which lined either side of the path; each one of them was a room, some were identical to the one Hoichi was kept in while others were marginally larger with two or three beds; some of the mattresses were doubles or bunks. The overhead lights cast the scene in dim yellow and the entire place hummed steadily with electricity.

‚ÄúThis place is big enough to house an army,‚Äù said the clown.

X guffawed, but did not answer, and continued to lead him.

They came to a T intersection. To the left, the hall continued; to the right was a broader opening closed shut by double doors. They moved right and pushed through those doors‚Äîbeyond was what looked like a military mess hall with a high plain ceiling. Organized in neat rows were twenty bench-tables, each one placed over its own plain black rug. The walls here were as sterile as the ones in the hall. At the far end of the broad room was a long kitchen with a series of plain cabinets and utility-style sinks and box fridges and microwaves and stoves. Cookware hung from pegs on the walls.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù said the clown, ‚ÄúWhat is all of this?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the level one kitchen,‚Äù said X, ‚ÄúAs you feel up to it, it might suit you to come here on your own, at your leisure. If you need me, do not hesitate to call, but if you‚Äôd like to, you are permitted to come here whenever you desire.‚Äù

They stood there in the doorway of the kitchen and the clown scanned the room once then scanned it again; his mouth pursed, and he blinked in rapid succession several times. ‚ÄúAre all of those plugged in?‚Äù asked Hoichi.

‚ÄúThe appliances?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fridges and everything!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

The clown knitted his brow. ‚ÄúWhat a waste of power. Wait‚Äîare they stocked?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù said X, ‚ÄúCome on. I‚Äôll show you popcorn. It‚Äôs delightful. I have, in my time here, wasted too many packages of it. Now there is someone to eat whatever might instead be wasted. Come on and I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen corn in all styles. They sell street corn in Dallas. Some places even do it by the cob.‚Äù

‚ÄúDallas?‚Äù X shook his head, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. This isn‚Äôt street corn. This is popcorn. A simple snack but,‚Äù X froze for a moment, expressionless and perhaps searching for another adjective; he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs delightful. It‚Äôs not even the flavor that‚Äôs the most delightful aspect of it, but you‚Äôll see what I mean.‚Äù

X led the clown to the wall furthest from the entrance to the mess hall and let Hoichi support himself along the counter while he opened an overhead cabinet‚Äîthe designs of the storage paneling imitated wood, but these surfaces too reflected like polished metal or glass. The strange man called X removed a flat envelope and offered it to Hoichi.

The clown took it and examined the thing. The package was plain and dull like wax paper and when Hoichi moved his pressing fingers across it, spherical indentations remained, outlining what was within; he lifted the package back to X and the man snatched it away before nodding in Hoichi‚Äôs direction.

‚ÄúYup,‚Äù said the clown flatly, ‚ÄúI see it. Amazing stuff, garcon. Indeed. Yikes, I can hardly contain my excitement!‚Äù The clown grinned fiendishly to the point of farce, planting his left forearm against the counter while swinging his right arm hooklike.  
X moved to the nearest microwave and Hoichi followed, keeping contact with the counter; he passed over a sink basin and briefly angled forward to glance into the open pipe, before meeting where X awaited excitedly on tiptoes.

X ripped open the microwave door, launched the package into the small room so that it thudded against the back wall, then slammed the door shut. He pushed a single button and then reached over to support Hoichi on his shoulder so the clown might see from a better angle.

The microwave window, roughly one and a half feet wide, was alight from within by a single bulb, and the package rotated in the center of the compartment; the package expanded, and then the popcorn kernels within began to explode with pops. X squeezed his guest‚Äôs bicep, and the clown examined the still expression of X‚Äôs face which did not at all reflect the animation of the man. The machine-gun pops forced gleeful giggles from X and the clown shook his head, teeth nibbling lips as he blinked through the awkward display.

Once the microwave went dark and signaled the end of its task via several quick beeps, X removed the package and pinched one end of the now air-fattened package to open. ‚ÄúPopcorn,‚Äù said X with incredible delight.

‚ÄúYeah, chief. Yeah, it is,‚Äù nodded the clown.

On more than one occasion since arriving at the bunker of those captains of industry, Hoichi asked X if he was a demon and each time, X laughed the inquiry away and then asked Hoichi if he was a demon. It seemed to X that both thoughts were equally likely.

Still, Hoichi recovered hastily and listened to music and took himself to the mess hall, the place which X dubbed ‚Äòthe level one kitchen‚Äô, on days that he was left entirely to his own devices. He danced there alone and sometimes pushed the bench-tables together, and once he‚Äôd fully recovered from his wounds, he lifted himself onto the table surfaces and leapt across them while dancing as though a performer on stages. This behavior was something of a habit. He explored the plain halls of the facility limited to him by X and become so frustrated at the strange man‚Äôs illusiveness that he would outright insult X; X never seemed to take notice of Hoichi‚Äôs overt cruelty, and so the vulgar language Hoichi used for X sounded not only comfortable, but natural‚Äînever did his tone seem playful nor congenial.

Hoichi was asleep when X roused him awake with a finger prod directly to the forehead‚Äîthe clown came awake immediately, flailing his arms and snagging the blankets off himself so they sashed along his bed‚Äôs edge. Huffing and blinking madly, the clown yelped, ‚ÄúJesus, ass-face, you almost gave me a heart attack.‚Äù He blinked a few more times in the absolute black of the room. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even hear you breathing there!‚Äù And upon blinking a few more times, he called, ‚ÄúThat is you, isn‚Äôt it, X?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù said the man; the room burst forth with immediate overhead light, sending Hoichi pinching his eyes shut and clapping his flat hands over his brow. ‚ÄúYou seem completely healed now,‚Äù said X; his eyes remained locked onto that of the clown‚Äôs, ‚ÄúThe clocks indicate it‚Äôs been more than six weeks since your arrival. How is your wrist? Any headaches?‚Äù

Still wiping at his eyes with his knuckles, Hoichi started nodding then froze and stared into the middle distance, towards the foot of his bed, ‚ÄúYeah, fuck-face. I‚Äôm all better. Is it time for me to go home now?‚Äù

X shook his head, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with your kidneys.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Not exactly the kidneys. Do you know where those are located?‚Äù

Hoichi yanked on the discarded blankets and pulled them up to cover his bare chest; he nodded at the question.

‚ÄúGood. It‚Äôs not exactly the kidneys,‚Äù repeated X, ‚ÄúThe adrenal glands‚Äîthose rest directly on top of the kidneys‚Äîare swollen, agitated.‚Äù Mocking contemplation, X crossed his arms across his chest and pivoted to swing into the chair by the bed. He lifted his right hand to his chin and began scratching there while staring at the floor. ‚ÄúMy first thought was that you had a cancer, but the scans show no signs of such a thing. It must have something to do with your spike in cortisol production. When you first showed up on our doorstep, I thought it was a mutation, considering your circumstances‚Äîyour way of life, the demon. But your adrenal glands look almost fatty in the scans.‚Äù

‚ÄúScans?‚Äù asked Hoichi, ‚ÄúWhat scans? Have you been scanning me?‚Äù His eyes traced the room, the corners, and the ceiling. ‚ÄúHave you been scanning me while I‚Äôm asleep? How did you even do that? Fucking creepy.‚Äù

X waved this away then continued with his long gaze, ‚ÄúNo, not while you were sleeping. You‚Äôre under constant monitoring here.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúDid you ingest anything recently? Anything strange?‚Äù

Hoichi swiped his hand across the crown of his head to flatten his mutinous bed hair. ‚ÄúYeah, I did now that you mention it. It was back in Roswell.‚Äù He let the blanket fall away and he stood, totally nude along the bed across from X; he yanked on a pair of dulle blue shorts.

‚ÄúDo you have any idea what its contents were?‚Äù

‚ÄúBooze? Drugs? A little of this and a little of that. Hey, what‚Äôs this got to do with anything?‚Äù Hoichi climbed into a thin white shirt.

X‚Äôs head tilted forward then back, and he locked on to Hoichi. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said the man, ‚ÄúBut I have a test. I‚Äôll need your cooperation.‚Äù

X then led Hoichi to a copy of a copy of all the other bunk rooms within the facility; this room, however, was barer than the rest without a bed. It had no humanizing touches. They sat at a table facing one another atop two padded metal frame chairs‚Äîthe only furniture in the square‚Äîand X guffawed.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt look so dour,‚Äù said X.  
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to go home,‚Äù said Hoichi.

X nodded, ‚ÄúBack out there? Where there are cannibals and rapists and demons?‚Äù

Hoichi grinned wickedly, satirically, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs home.‚Äù

X guffawed again in response.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this test?‚Äù

‚ÄúPut your hands flat upon the table. Palms down.‚Äù

Hoichi chewed his lips and complied.

Immediately, X moved his hand into his interior breast pocket, as though reaching for a handkerchief. In a millisecond, a scalpel was erect in his hand and without hesitation, he brought the blade down on Hoichi‚Äôs left hand so hard that the metal of the instrument scraped against the metal of the table.

The clown, without thinking, ripped away from the spot, lurching the blade further along in his flesh. ‚ÄúF-fuck!‚Äù screeched Hoichi, ‚ÄúHoly shit you crazy bastard! You cunt!‚Äù He cried, eyes bulging through wild tears. ‚ÄúHoly shit!‚Äù he huffed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù said X, ‚ÄúI can guarantee you that I won‚Äôt move, so if you move, you might give yourself permanent nerve damage. Or worse.‚Äù X looked dumbly at the place he held the scalpel firm. The blade was gone entirely within the other man‚Äôs hand, as well as some of the instrument‚Äôs handle. Dark blood erupted from the wound.

Hoichi pranced where he stood; the chair he‚Äôd been sitting on was cast on its side and the clown moved up and down, squatting, standing‚Äîhis eyes danced from his left hand, planted firmly there by the blade and to X‚Äôs expressionless face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to rip my fucking hand in two!‚Äù Finally, he came to half-squat, helplessly planted where he was.

X watched the clown then reached into the other side of his interior breast pocket with his free hand to withdraw a sidearm‚Äîa Luger. He aimed it at Hoichi‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúWhoa, fucker, whoa!‚Äù Hoichi went to his knees, so his chin rested on the table; the rolling blood from his hand met him there, but he paid no attention to it. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing, X?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to shoot you, Hoichi.‚Äù The man‚Äôs voice was monotone completely.

Hoichi threw up his right hand as if to block the bullets, and in doing so, the gun was ripped from X‚Äôs hand and spun through the air where it smacked the far wall behind X.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said X, looking at his own empty hand, ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù He dislodged the scalpel from the clown‚Äôs hand and returned it to his breast pocket.

The clown withdrew his left hand and cradled it. ‚ÄúYou crazy fuck,‚Äù he whimpered.

X rose and retrieved the pistol while Hoichi clamored to the closed door, but X put the gun away as well. ‚ÄúHoichi,‚Äù called the man.

Hoichi kept his back to the door, his fingers, slick with his own blood, sliding along the polished surfaces there, as if in search of a handle; there wasn‚Äôt one.

‚ÄúHoichi,‚Äù called X again, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt intend to kill you. The pistol wasn‚Äôt loaded,‚Äù he lifted his empty palms. ‚ÄúIt was an experiment. A test. Your adrenal glands are swollen. Your cortisol levels are high to kill a man. You possess telekinesis.‚Äù

‚ÄúTelekinesis?‚Äù Hoichi was shaking, shivering, still searching for a door handle.

‚ÄúYou will things to be with your mind. To what degree, I cannot yet tell.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been contaminated, Hoichi.‚Äù

‚ÄúI knocked the gun out of your hand!‚Äù

X guffawed, ‚ÄúSo to speak, you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must‚Äôve touched it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did not.‚Äù

The cushions of the chairs arranged around the coffee table were stuffed with human hair. The sconce stems lining the walls were crafted from human bones. Hubal sat at his uncle‚Äôs desk and scanned the long rectangular room. Overhead hung an unlit chandelier, and this too was constructed from the bones of murdered slaves.

It was three days since Salamander Truth‚Äôs funeral, and since the old man‚Äôs death Hubal had been unable to pull himself from the study‚Äîlining every space of wall not covered by framed photos or paintings were master-crafted shelves, pushed into the walls themselves, and sitting on those shelves was a perfectly kept selection of books ranging in genre from medical texts to philosophy to reputable literature bound in the leathered skin of the dead. Not a flat surface meant for them was empty.

The room was quiet, save Hubal‚Äôs tapping of his filthy nails on the desk. The only entrance to the place stood opposite where Hubal sat‚Äîarranged halfway between himself and the ornate double doors was the sitting area with those stuffed chairs; standing sentry there on the coffee table was a narrow vase containing a single white lily.

Hubal reached for the bottle of red wine there on the desk and poured himself a glass into a tumbler. He knocked it back and when he sat it back on the table, half gone, those double doors cracked open, and a head peered in at him.

He waved them in, and a scrawny man entered the study with a bucket full of cleaning supplies swinging in the crook of his arm; the cleaner wore plain clothes and a slave collar and kept his eyes averted as he came to the coffee table, sat the bucket on the Moroccan trellis rug, and began to dust the table with cloth.

Sipping at his wine, Hubal watched the man go about his work‚Äîthe slave started at the table, examined the level of water in the white lily‚Äôs vase, batted the cushions of the chairs, then began wiping the bookshelves with his cloth.

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù called Hubal, and the man froze in his work, cloth frozen in a fist. ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù said the slaver.

The slave glanced back at his undone task.

‚ÄúCome here, now,‚Äù said Hubal.

The slave moved quickly, approached the desk, ‚ÄúWhat can I do for you?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúDo you know how Uncle Sal received his name? His last name.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was the tree, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù asked the slave.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve heard it!‚Äù Hubal clapped then began to refill the tumbler of wine. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the cherry tree in the plaza! There‚Äôs even a plaque out there for visitors.‚Äù

The slave nodded briskly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read it once or twice.‚Äù

Hubal tilted the bottle of wine to stop himself from pouring and then asked, ‚ÄúOh? Who taught you how to do that?‚Äù

Immediately the slave opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came.

Hubal grinned and tapped his nose with his forefinger and barked a laugh and continued pouring his tumbler full to the rim. Like a child, he mouth-sucked the tension off the top of the glass then recapped the wine and set it aside. ‚ÄúYou know then that the cherry tree has that big mark on its trunk from his axe?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the slave.

The slaver was grinning and his eyes shone from drunkenness; he couched himself in the desk chair and put his arms out wide, so they hung out broadly from him. ‚ÄúHe could not tell a lie. He started at the tree with his axe, and upon being caught, he was accosted by his father. Uncle Sal said, ‚ÄòI cannot tell a lie.‚Äô That is how he came by his surname. Honestly.‚Äù Hubal sniffed then rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúHe was a good man, of course. Of course, he was a good man, and no one knew generosity better than him. Sorry.‚Äù Hubal wiped at his eyes, but when he locked his gaze with the slave‚Äôs, each of Hubal‚Äôs eyes looked dry enough. ‚ÄúHe was my uncle. Actually, of course. But he told everyone to call him Uncle Sal. Good man. Come,‚Äù he motioned the slave forward, ‚ÄúCome drink with me.‚Äù

He grabbed an empty tumbler with the wine, a twin of his own glass. He poured it a quarter full.

‚ÄúGo on and take some and just listen to me harp on.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù said the slave‚Äîit seemed that he might shake his head, but those micromovements, possibly imagined, could scarcely be seen.

‚ÄúGo on,‚Äù laughed Hubal, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lonely, and of course I try to keep the rule of never drinking alone. Look at me! Who‚Äôs going to reprimand you? It‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre sure?‚Äù asked the slave.

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù Hubal leaned down to open one of the lower drawers of the desk and removed a book of matches and a sleeve of cigarettes. He lit one and began smoking. He watched the slave lift the tumbler he pushed to him and continued, ‚ÄúUncle Sal never liked it when I smoked in here. He said it wasn‚Äôt good for books. Of course, he‚Äôs gone now.‚Äù He shrugged and took another drag then reached for another cigarette and handed it to the slave.

The slave took it, setting his cleaning cloth on the desk; Hubal lingered at the rag and puffed and leaned back again in the chair.

Then he jerked forward, ‚ÄúMy apologies, really,‚Äù said Hubal. He reached for the matches and lit the cigarette sticking from the slave‚Äôs mouth then shook the match out and grinned. ‚ÄúGo on and drink it. Tell me what you think of it. It‚Äôs from long before,‚Äù he motioned all around, trailing smoke from his right hand, ‚ÄúAll this. Incredibly expensive.‚Äù

Putting his nose to the wine, the slave sniffed and then offered another glance at the master who nodded eagerly. The slave drank the wine and made a face.

‚ÄúGood?‚Äù

The slave nodded then began to drag on the cigarette given to him.

Hubal‚Äôs gaze drifted to the books, the chandelier, the rug‚Äîhe angled over the desk, putting his hands together so his forearms formed a triangle with his chest. He nodded, ‚ÄúMy uncle was a good man, indeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was,‚Äù agreed the slave.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the cherry tree though. That‚Äôs why it grows bent at an angle and only gives half the fruit it might otherwise. His father could have cleared the plot, but he kept it, and then when Uncle Sal took over, he kept it too and had it roped off for public viewing. It‚Äôs a symbol. Of course, symbols are very important.‚Äù Hubal stared at the collar the slave wore; it was a rugged metal thing with a red flickering light. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt that thing ever get itchy?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the slave drank greedily from his glass, ‚ÄúNot at all.‚Äù

Hubal adjusted to remove something from his pocket. It was a slaver‚Äôs switch. ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù he commanded.

The slave froze upon seeing the thing in the other man‚Äôs hand.

‚ÄúLean down so I can get it.‚Äù

The slave abided.

Hubal took the switch to the back of the collar, ‚ÄúYours is tighter than most. There it is!‚Äù he called.

The collar clicked open then fell away from the man‚Äôs throat, leaving behind a callus of skin.

‚ÄúGo on and rub it. I bet that will feel much better now.‚Äù Hubal took the collar and set it on the desk with his own glass of wine.

The slave abided once more and scrubbed at the sides of his neck with the heel of the hand holding his cigarette.

‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the slave.

Hubal took a deep gulp from his glass and then drew long from his cigarette.

The slave mirrored the master.

Hubal went into the drawer of the desk again and withdrew a flat image, a photograph of twenty-four individuals lined up against a wall, staggered as though for an event photo. Center stage was a bearded, younger Uncle Salamander Truth. The other twenty-three people in the photo were his favorites‚Äîhis personal slaves and entertainment, each one collared and grinning with only their mouths. Furthest to the left was a young woman and a young man; the woman was arched over and holding onto the man‚Äôs sleeve‚Äîthe man grinned doubly so than the others, for he wore a clown tattoo on his face. He had no ears. ‚ÄúSee this?‚Äù Hubal asked the slave.

The slave craned over to see.

The master flicked the picture‚Äôs corner while holding it up to the slave‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúKnew I recognized them,‚Äù said Hubal. He sighed and dropped the photo onto the table and spat violently at the space between his legs. Hubal leaned back in his chair. ‚ÄúAll of this talk of honest Uncle Sal.‚Äù He shook his head, ‚ÄúAll of this talk of him and his honesty and so I wonder, why have you done this?‚Äù he asked.

The slave raised his brow and opened his mouth as if to speak, but clapped it shut as the master continued.

‚ÄúWhy is it that when I came in here and saw you pilfering cigarettes and wine, you overpowered me to remove your collar? All this talk of honesty, and you go and do a thing like that. Why have you done that? Can you explain?‚Äù Hubal waited for an answer.

The slave stood frozen, eyes wide from understanding.

Hubal returned to the drawer a final time to produce a pistol, and he shot the slave in the face‚Äîthe man‚Äôs body smacked the floor. The wine glass clattered, and the slaver moved to stand over the prone man. He stared into the gurgling mess he‚Äôd made then reached for the bottle of wine and uncapped it and moved across the room with the mouth between his lips, turning its bottom up high; he tossed the cap over his shoulder.

He shoved through the double doors and left the study.

Time passed‚Äîthere were no windows in this underground facility, so it became impossible to tell when one day began and the last ended without Hoichi looking at the handheld device that X had given him: the phone. It was touchscreen and worked much the same as any of the tablets Hoichi had seen in his days outside of this strange place‚Äîthough the old tech was bulky and older, much older.

Weeks. Weeks had gone by and Hoichi readily vocalized his surprise and elation at the amount of music he found on the phone. He‚Äôd found an artist by the name of Nat King Cole that he enjoyed thoroughly and often danced, poorly swinging his arms around the empty room he‚Äôd been given by the odd man called X. He'd become so familiar with the crooner‚Äôs songs that he often mimed their lyrics in an exaggerated manner with his lips as they played and sometimes, with total abandon, he belted the words out, so they reverberated off the metal walls of his cell.

It was a cell in many ways.

X allowed Hoichi to travel certain hallways of the facility, but others were sealed off by large doors which resembled the ones he‚Äôd passed through at the entrance of the bunker. Often times, X left through one of those otherwise closed doors, so Hoichi was alone for stretches.

Earlier, while Hoichi recovered from his injuries in bed, he asked questions of the man called X. Questions like: ‚ÄúWhere are we exactly?‚Äù, ‚ÄúCan I leave?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAm I dead‚Äîis this heaven or hell?‚Äù

X, who lounged in the seat adjacent the clown in total silence whenever he came to visit, seemed to find the last question particularly amusing even though he did not laugh; the corners of his mouth darted up for a millisecond and then his expression became neutral immediately. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt heaven nor hell,‚Äù said X, ‚ÄúThis is an old clubhouse‚Äîa bunker. One of many that was constructed before the deluge, as you‚Äôve called it. It was a place for us captains of industry. And our friends and families.‚Äù Hoichi had long given up on deciphering how X was able to speak without opening his mouth; whenever he prodded the strange man about it, he received no answer, no matter the frustration.

‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt there more people here?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many people should be here?‚Äù asked X.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù the clown sighed, ‚ÄúYou said there‚Äôs a woman down here with you, right? Eliza? You said her name was Eliza, and you said it was because of her that you came to help me. I didn‚Äôt misremember that, did I?‚Äù

X nodded mechanically, ‚ÄúEliza is here.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I speak to her?‚Äù

‚ÄúLater,‚Äù said X.

Hoichi looked over his injuries and rubbed his head and hissed. ‚ÄúOnce I can walk without my head splitting, I need to get back to my sister. She‚Äôs probably worried sick about me.‚Äù The clown paused and his expression flattened upon examining X‚Äôs still face. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about her too.‚Äù He raised himself in the bed and still cradled his left hand. ‚ÄúCould you take me, maybe?‚Äù

‚ÄúOutside?‚Äù asked X.

The clown nodded.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the man, definitively. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt go outside. We don‚Äôt go outside. Ever.‚Äù

Hoichi stared at X‚Äôs unblinking face and asked, ‚ÄúHow long have you been down here?‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever had popcorn?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey‚Äî

X reached out for Hoichi‚Äôs right hand and helped him out of bed.

They moved out of the room, the clown using X for support in his steps. ‚ÄúI still get dizzy,‚Äù said Hoichi.

‚ÄúYou should be dead.‚Äù

The clown squinted at the man as they moved into the hallway.

‚ÄúNo, sorry. I mean only that your injuries should have killed you. I still don‚Äôt understand it. Now here, lean on me as much as you need, and I‚Äôll show you popcorn.‚Äù

The hall was as stark as when Hoichi first entered the room. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen it before,‚Äù offered the clown, ‚ÄúThey make it at those roadside stalls in metal pans! Lots of butter.‚Äù

X took the clown down the hall, ignoring the response, and Hoichi peered in through the doors which lined either side of the path; each one of them was a room, some were identical to the one Hoichi was kept in while others were marginally larger with two or three beds; some of the mattresses were doubles or bunks. The overhead lights cast the scene in dim yellow and the entire place hummed steadily with electricity.

‚ÄúThis place is big enough to house an army,‚Äù said the clown.

X guffawed, but did not answer, and continued to lead him.

They came to a T intersection. To the left, the hall continued; to the right was a broader opening closed shut by double doors. They moved right and pushed through those doors‚Äîbeyond was what looked like a military mess hall with a high plain ceiling. Organized in neat rows were twenty bench-tables, each one placed over its own plain black rug. The walls here were as sterile as the ones in the hall. At the far end of the broad room was a long kitchen with a series of plain cabinets and utility-style sinks and box fridges and microwaves and stoves. Cookware hung from pegs on the walls.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù said the clown, ‚ÄúWhat is all of this?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the level one kitchen,‚Äù said X, ‚ÄúAs you feel up to it, it might suit you to come here on your own, at your leisure. If you need me, do not hesitate to call, but if you‚Äôd like to, you are permitted to come here whenever you desire.‚Äù

They stood there in the doorway of the kitchen and the clown scanned the room once then scanned it again; his mouth pursed, and he blinked in rapid succession several times. ‚ÄúAre all of those plugged in?‚Äù asked Hoichi.

‚ÄúThe appliances?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fridges and everything!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

The clown knitted his brow. ‚ÄúWhat a waste of power. Wait‚Äîare they stocked?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù said X, ‚ÄúCome on. I‚Äôll show you popcorn. It‚Äôs delightful. I have, in my time here, wasted too many packages of it. Now there is someone to eat whatever might instead be wasted. Come on and I‚Äôll show you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen corn in all styles. They sell street corn in Dallas. Some places even do it by the cob.‚Äù

‚ÄúDallas?‚Äù X shook his head, ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. This isn‚Äôt street corn. This is popcorn. A simple snack but,‚Äù X froze for a moment, expressionless and perhaps searching for another adjective; he shrugged and said, ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs delightful. It‚Äôs not even the flavor that‚Äôs the most delightful aspect of it, but you‚Äôll see what I mean.‚Äù

X led the clown to the wall furthest from the entrance to the mess hall and let Hoichi support himself along the counter while he opened an overhead cabinet‚Äîthe designs of the storage paneling imitated wood, but these surfaces too reflected like polished metal or glass. The strange man called X removed a flat envelope and offered it to Hoichi.

The clown took it and examined the thing. The package was plain and dull like wax paper and when Hoichi moved his pressing fingers across it, spherical indentations remained, outlining what was within; he lifted the package back to X and the man snatched it away before nodding in Hoichi‚Äôs direction.

‚ÄúYup,‚Äù said the clown flatly, ‚ÄúI see it. Amazing stuff, garcon. Indeed. Yikes, I can hardly contain my excitement!‚Äù The clown grinned fiendishly to the point of farce, planting his left forearm against the counter while swinging his right arm hooklike.  
X moved to the nearest microwave and Hoichi followed, keeping contact with the counter; he passed over a sink basin and briefly angled forward to glance into the open pipe, before meeting where X awaited excitedly on tiptoes.

X ripped open the microwave door, launched the package into the small room so that it thudded against the back wall, then slammed the door shut. He pushed a single button and then reached over to support Hoichi on his shoulder so the clown might see from a better angle.

The microwave window, roughly one and a half feet wide, was alight from within by a single bulb, and the package rotated in the center of the compartment; the package expanded, and then the popcorn kernels within began to explode with pops. X squeezed his guest‚Äôs bicep, and the clown examined the still expression of X‚Äôs face which did not at all reflect the animation of the man. The machine-gun pops forced gleeful giggles from X and the clown shook his head, teeth nibbling lips as he blinked through the awkward display.

Once the microwave went dark and signaled the end of its task via several quick beeps, X removed the package and pinched one end of the now air-fattened package to open. ‚ÄúPopcorn,‚Äù said X with incredible delight.

‚ÄúYeah, chief. Yeah, it is,‚Äù nodded the clown.

On more than one occasion since arriving at the bunker of those captains of industry, Hoichi asked X if he was a demon and each time, X laughed the inquiry away and then asked Hoichi if he was a demon. It seemed to X that both thoughts were equally likely.

Still, Hoichi recovered hastily and listened to music and took himself to the mess hall, the place which X dubbed ‚Äòthe level one kitchen‚Äô, on days that he was left entirely to his own devices. He danced there alone and sometimes pushed the bench-tables together, and once he‚Äôd fully recovered from his wounds, he lifted himself onto the table surfaces and leapt across them while dancing as though a performer on stages. This behavior was something of a habit. He explored the plain halls of the facility limited to him by X and become so frustrated at the strange man‚Äôs illusiveness that he would outright insult X; X never seemed to take notice of Hoichi‚Äôs overt cruelty, and so the vulgar language Hoichi used for X sounded not only comfortable, but natural‚Äînever did his tone seem playful nor congenial.

Hoichi was asleep when X roused him awake with a finger prod directly to the forehead‚Äîthe clown came awake immediately, flailing his arms and snagging the blankets off himself so they sashed along his bed‚Äôs edge. Huffing and blinking madly, the clown yelped, ‚ÄúJesus, ass-face, you almost gave me a heart attack.‚Äù He blinked a few more times in the absolute black of the room. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even hear you breathing there!‚Äù And upon blinking a few more times, he called, ‚ÄúThat is you, isn‚Äôt it, X?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is,‚Äù said the man; the room burst forth with immediate overhead light, sending Hoichi pinching his eyes shut and clapping his flat hands over his brow. ‚ÄúYou seem completely healed now,‚Äù said X; his eyes remained locked onto that of the clown‚Äôs, ‚ÄúThe clocks indicate it‚Äôs been more than six weeks since your arrival. How is your wrist? Any headaches?‚Äù

Still wiping at his eyes with his knuckles, Hoichi started nodding then froze and stared into the middle distance, towards the foot of his bed, ‚ÄúYeah, fuck-face. I‚Äôm all better. Is it time for me to go home now?‚Äù

X shook his head, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something wrong with your kidneys.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Not exactly the kidneys. Do you know where those are located?‚Äù

Hoichi yanked on the discarded blankets and pulled them up to cover his bare chest; he nodded at the question.

‚ÄúGood. It‚Äôs not exactly the kidneys,‚Äù repeated X, ‚ÄúThe adrenal glands‚Äîthose rest directly on top of the kidneys‚Äîare swollen, agitated.‚Äù Mocking contemplation, X crossed his arms across his chest and pivoted to swing into the chair by the bed. He lifted his right hand to his chin and began scratching there while staring at the floor. ‚ÄúMy first thought was that you had a cancer, but the scans show no signs of such a thing. It must have something to do with your spike in cortisol production. When you first showed up on our doorstep, I thought it was a mutation, considering your circumstances‚Äîyour way of life, the demon. But your adrenal glands look almost fatty in the scans.‚Äù

‚ÄúScans?‚Äù asked Hoichi, ‚ÄúWhat scans? Have you been scanning me?‚Äù His eyes traced the room, the corners, and the ceiling. ‚ÄúHave you been scanning me while I‚Äôm asleep? How did you even do that? Fucking creepy.‚Äù

X waved this away then continued with his long gaze, ‚ÄúNo, not while you were sleeping. You‚Äôre under constant monitoring here.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúDid you ingest anything recently? Anything strange?‚Äù

Hoichi swiped his hand across the crown of his head to flatten his mutinous bed hair. ‚ÄúYeah, I did now that you mention it. It was back in Roswell.‚Äù He let the blanket fall away and he stood, totally nude along the bed across from X; he yanked on a pair of dulle blue shorts.

‚ÄúDo you have any idea what its contents were?‚Äù

‚ÄúBooze? Drugs? A little of this and a little of that. Hey, what‚Äôs this got to do with anything?‚Äù Hoichi climbed into a thin white shirt.

X‚Äôs head tilted forward then back, and he locked on to Hoichi. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù said the man, ‚ÄúBut I have a test. I‚Äôll need your cooperation.‚Äù

X then led Hoichi to a copy of a copy of all the other bunk rooms within the facility; this room, however, was barer than the rest without a bed. It had no humanizing touches. They sat at a table facing one another atop two padded metal frame chairs‚Äîthe only furniture in the square‚Äîand X guffawed.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt look so dour,‚Äù said X.  
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to go home,‚Äù said Hoichi.

X nodded, ‚ÄúBack out there? Where there are cannibals and rapists and demons?‚Äù

Hoichi grinned wickedly, satirically, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs home.‚Äù

X guffawed again in response.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this test?‚Äù

‚ÄúPut your hands flat upon the table. Palms down.‚Äù

Hoichi chewed his lips and complied.

Immediately, X moved his hand into his interior breast pocket, as though reaching for a handkerchief. In a millisecond, a scalpel was erect in his hand and without hesitation, he brought the blade down on Hoichi‚Äôs left hand so hard that the metal of the instrument scraped against the metal of the table.

The clown, without thinking, ripped away from the spot, lurching the blade further along in his flesh. ‚ÄúF-fuck!‚Äù screeched Hoichi, ‚ÄúHoly shit you crazy bastard! You cunt!‚Äù He cried, eyes bulging through wild tears. ‚ÄúHoly shit!‚Äù he huffed.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù said X, ‚ÄúI can guarantee you that I won‚Äôt move, so if you move, you might give yourself permanent nerve damage. Or worse.‚Äù X looked dumbly at the place he held the scalpel firm. The blade was gone entirely within the other man‚Äôs hand, as well as some of the instrument‚Äôs handle. Dark blood erupted from the wound.

Hoichi pranced where he stood; the chair he‚Äôd been sitting on was cast on its side and the clown moved up and down, squatting, standing‚Äîhis eyes danced from his left hand, planted firmly there by the blade and to X‚Äôs expressionless face. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to rip my fucking hand in two!‚Äù Finally, he came to half-squat, helplessly planted where he was.

X watched the clown then reached into the other side of his interior breast pocket with his free hand to withdraw a sidearm‚Äîa Luger. He aimed it at Hoichi‚Äôs head.

‚ÄúWhoa, fucker, whoa!‚Äù Hoichi went to his knees, so his chin rested on the table; the rolling blood from his hand met him there, but he paid no attention to it. ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing, X?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to shoot you, Hoichi.‚Äù The man‚Äôs voice was monotone completely.

Hoichi threw up his right hand as if to block the bullets, and in doing so, the gun was ripped from X‚Äôs hand and spun through the air where it smacked the far wall behind X.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù said X, looking at his own empty hand, ‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù He dislodged the scalpel from the clown‚Äôs hand and returned it to his breast pocket.

The clown withdrew his left hand and cradled it. ‚ÄúYou crazy fuck,‚Äù he whimpered.

X rose and retrieved the pistol while Hoichi clamored to the closed door, but X put the gun away as well. ‚ÄúHoichi,‚Äù called the man.

Hoichi kept his back to the door, his fingers, slick with his own blood, sliding along the polished surfaces there, as if in search of a handle; there wasn‚Äôt one.

‚ÄúHoichi,‚Äù called X again, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt intend to kill you. The pistol wasn‚Äôt loaded,‚Äù he lifted his empty palms. ‚ÄúIt was an experiment. A test. Your adrenal glands are swollen. Your cortisol levels are high to kill a man. You possess telekinesis.‚Äù

‚ÄúTelekinesis?‚Äù Hoichi was shaking, shivering, still searching for a door handle.

‚ÄúYou will things to be with your mind. To what degree, I cannot yet tell.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been contaminated, Hoichi.‚Äù

‚ÄúI knocked the gun out of your hand!‚Äù

X guffawed, ‚ÄúSo to speak, you did.‚Äù

‚ÄúI must‚Äôve touched it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did not.‚Äù

By ""real"" espresso machine, I mean one where you use freshly ground coffee or pre-ground beans (so not capsules). I‚Äôm curious about a few things:

* Is the difference in taste and quality really that noticeable?
* How much more work is it (grinding beans, prepping the shot, cleaning, etc.)?
* Is it significantly more expensive in the long run (machine, grinder, beans, maintenance)?
* And from what price point can you get a *good* espresso machine that actually delivers quality espresso?

Would love to hear from anyone who made the switch or has experience with both. Is it worth the upgrade, or is Nespresso good enough for daily use?

I got separated 8 months ago and haven‚Äôt had any physical intimacy in years. But reading some comments made me quite horny both nights and today afternoon, I agreed to meet someone who has been messaging me here on the chat since my first post on Tuesday. After all, I had to take the plunge soon. 

(I wanted to mention his Reddit handle here, but he asked me not to as of now, and I respect that. Maybe if something else happens) 

He is 27 and a Tamilian working in Mumbai, same like me. There is a notable age difference, but this was the kink I wanted to explore and so did he. He was chatting with me normally only (with just some light sexting) in between) and we didn‚Äôt exchange numbers or pictures even, but today he said he was near Bandra.. and asked me to meet for a quick coffee. He didn‚Äôt insist, but asked me politely a couple of times and I thought what‚Äôs the worst that could happen? 

I had an hour‚Äôs break and said ok, took a cab to Third Wave Coffee which I frequent since it‚Äôs a safe space for me. I was wearing a simple kurta and jeans to work today, which looked too plain, so I just changed my top into a gym T shirt I had in my bag. I had kept it to use tomorrow morning in case I forgot. It was a bit tight, but fit me well and I wanted to look good too. I was wearing a nice amante full figure bra and a cute M & S panty inside. 

We met there and he was quite nice looking, had a decent body, and it was fun to talk to him in Tamil and discuss movies and music. We kept the conversation very light hearted and nothing about my ex-husband or serious topics. This is exactly what I wanted. He did glance at my t shirt a few times, as his eyes wandered to my tits which were popping out a bit (my bra size is 36D) but quickly looked up when he saw I noticed. We spent just half an hour talking and I said it was a good first meeting and I should leave. 

He offered to drop me back to my office building. I initially said no and I booked an Ola, but he stood waiting next to me quite gentlemanly, so I gave in and said he could take me. I got in and it was a short ride only, just 20 minutes. Around 10 minutes in, he mentioned a couple of things about my body and why he found me desirable which turned me on a bit. As someone who hasn‚Äôt been hit on for years, and to have a younger guy eye-fucking you so eagerly is quite arousing. Moreover, my top had scrunched up a bit due over my jeans and was exposing quite a bit of my midriff with the tight seatbelt also really making my tits pop. He casually placed one of his hands over my waist and rubbed it, ran a finger over my midriff and my left nipple and brought it up to my lips (which were now wet) and traced it over them. I was feeling quite awkward and anxious, but I was also gasping in anticipation and didn‚Äôt know what to do. He kept running his fingers over my body and I was a bit paralysed, but didn‚Äôt want him to stop. He asked me if it was ok - and I just nodded mutely. 

Then he asked if he can find an isolated spot on the way somewhere and stop for just a short while. I could feel my panty getting wet by now (my pussy has been leaking so much the last 3 days) and I said fine, but nothing too dangerous and to make it quick. He found a small cut close to my office and parked there. Leaned in and kissed me lightly, pinched my breasts slightly over my shirt and then bit my ear. I kissed him back, and rubbed my hands over his erect dick over his trousers that I could clearly see. I asked him to kiss my navel as that‚Äôs one of my biggest kinks, so he pulled my jeans down a bit.. just enough until the top of my panty was visible.. he was ready to keep going but I stopped him. He bent down and kissed and licked my navel and ran his tongue over my entire waist and just the edge of my underwear. He was going down further to the very top of my bush (I haven‚Äôt shaved down there in a while) but i stopped him. He apologised and came back up. I said no problem since he was very gentle and handled me with a lot of care. 

We set our clothes right (I had messed up his hair and removed the top button of his shirt) but this quickie had lasted just 7-8 minutes. He dropped me outside my office building and I went back with a naughty smile on my face. 

Did I think I would meet someone so soon? No way. Did I imagine I would have the courage to do it even? Not at all. But did I enjoy it? So much. 

I told the Redditor that this could be a one time thing and I wasn‚Äôt sure if we would meet again. It depends on how I felt about him going forward or if there was anyone else. He understood that and kept it really cool without any pressure, which is what I liked most about him. I sent him a semi-nude click just an hour ago on Reddit chat itself just for helping me rediscover intimacy again.

Thanks to this forum for helping me come out of my cave. Sorry to everyone I haven‚Äôt replied to so far.

I have been having a wild three days ending with this incident. Not sure if I will meet the same guy or anyone else soon, but will see. For now, just happy that I did something similar to a teenage girl and I‚Äôm giggling about it all day long. My nips are still erect and my panty‚Äôs still moist. Hope more fun days are in store.

We met a year ago when we had gone on a date (she‚Äôs recently MTF trans) and didn‚Äôt feel the spark, but we stayed friends. We‚Äôve done a lot of coffee meetups together and about two months ago it came up that she was looking for a roommate. 

I had already been miserable at my job and looking to move anyway, and so I recently went ahead and started that process of moving in with her to be closer to the city instead of an hour away. I‚Äôd been looking for a roommate for a while but couldn‚Äôt find anyone that I thought would be a good fit. 

We had a day trip together last weekend and it was fun, but I started noticing more little boundary issues than I had before. Using my hairbrush for almost half an hour, climbing in my back seat to get a lit cigarette that they had asked me for and dropped, after opening my door on the highway and not closing it back all the way, it was just a lot. I went to my bfs house that night (30M) and we talked about if I really wanted to move in with her. I was like, yeah it was just a bad day and I was already in a mood because she was 45 minutes late and it changed our plans. He said it would be nice to have me closer, but he doesn‚Äôt want me to end up in a bad situation down the line. He says moving in with my parents would be a better option so I can save up more money and not rush to move out there before I‚Äôm ready. I told him I‚Äôd have a boundary talk with her and we should be fine, but she‚Äôs been really busy and I‚Äôve been really stressed since Saturday. 

Well, last night she called me crying saying she had ‚Äúhurt herself ‚Äú and couldn‚Äôt calm down enough to say what has happened. I‚Äôm trying to figure it out, and it turns out she dislocated her shoulder while dancing in her room (didn‚Äôt find this out until later that night). I basically was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an hour away, you need to call your parents or someone who can come and get you‚Äù. She did, and I asked her to let me know how it went. I asked later why she called me and she said I was the first person her mind went to, and she didn‚Äôt even think about distance, and how much it meant how quickly I picked up the phone. She always says how thankful she is for me and I thought I have made it very clear that I only think of her as a friend, and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just blowing this out of proportion. But now I‚Äôm worried that if I move in, I‚Äôm going to be some kind of pseudo relationship with a codependent person. I haven‚Äôt signed a lease yet but they‚Äôre supposed to be sending something over in a couple of days. I‚Äôve already told my landlord so he could be a reference for me, and I‚Äôve been applying for jobs only out in that area. My other option at this point is going to be moving back in with my parents. 

I don‚Äôt know if another conversation about boundaries would help, or if I should just reevaluate the situation. ",2,1744290153.0,AIO,12,0.75,False

1jvx5yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1jvx5yx/she_showed_up/,She showed up.,"I was desperate.

Not just physically but emotionally, spiritually, in every way a person can feel starved. My marriage, for years, had been a hollow room. Loveless. Sexless. A quiet arrangement built on duty, silence, and slowly fading hope. Divorce wasn‚Äôt an option, not for cultural reasons, not for practical ones. So I stayed. I still stay. And some days, it feels like I‚Äôm dissolving inside my own life.

That‚Äôs when I met her.

She was 45. I was 41. She lived in Bangalore. I was in Kerala. We met online, through letters. Long, thoughtful ones. She wrote about the loneliness in her own marriage, about rediscovering herself in her 40s, about how silence sometimes felt safer than confrontation. I understood every word like it was written from the marrow of my own bones.

Her messages weren‚Äôt dramatic. They didn‚Äôt flirt. But they lit me up. Knowing someone out there, smart, soulful, slightly wounded, cared enough to write back, to remember the little things I said, to meet me in the middle of my day with a story, a memory, a moment‚Ä¶ that gave me life again.

But soon, it wasn‚Äôt enough. I became obsessed. Not in a dark, unhealthy way, but in the way a parched man dreams about rain. I needed to be closer to her. I didn‚Äôt know what I was expecting  a friendship, something more.  I just knew I had to try.

So I moved to Bangalore.

I told myself it was for work, but I knew it was for her. She never asked me to come. I never asked if I should. I never even asked her if it was okay. I just landed there quietly, with hope packed between my shirts.

Months passed. We kept exchanging letters. And then, one fine day, I asked,  
‚ÄúWould you like to meet for coffee?‚Äù

She agreed.

We met at a quiet cafe in Indiranagar. She walked in wearing a dark green kurti, no makeup, her hair tied in a loose bun. She looked exactly as I imagined - not in features, but in aura. Calm, grounded, radiant in a way only someone who‚Äôs made peace with her chaos can be. I forgot how to talk.

We spoke slowly at first, then freely. About books. About life. About pain and poetry and all the in-between. When she laughed, I laughed too  -  not because of what she said, but because joy on her face made me feel like maybe, just maybe, I was worth something.

We met again. And again. We went shopping together. Shared addresses and numbers. She once ordered me biryani when I said I was too lazy to go out. And then one sunday morning, she showed up at my apartment.

No warning. Just a message:  
‚ÄúOpen the door.‚Äù

She stood there with a paper bag of snacks, walked in like she belonged, sat on the couch like she had always been part of the story. She smiled at my attempt at brunch  -  and we sat on the balcony after, watching the city blink quietly under a rainy sky.

‚ÄúI used to think love was overrated,‚Äù she said.  
‚ÄúAnd now?‚Äù I asked.  
‚ÄúNow I think I just hadn‚Äôt found the right silence to sit in.‚Äù

I held her hand. She didn‚Äôt pull away.

We didn‚Äôt kiss. We didn‚Äôt promise anything. But that evening, when she left, she turned at the door and smiled,  
‚ÄúNext time, I‚Äôm cooking.‚Äù

It was the first night in years I fell asleep smiling. Not because something romantic happened, but because something true did.

But here‚Äôs the truth. The only real part of this story is me, and the marriage I live in. A loveless, sexless, silent arrangement that I carry like a second skin. She never existed. Not her emails. Not her voice. Not our conversations in cafe or our balcony silences. I imagined it all. I created her, maybe out of desperation, maybe out of hope, because I needed to feel something again. I needed someone to care for me, even if she lived only in the corners of my mind. In a life where so little feels mine, she became my escape. My creation. My comfort.

And maybe that‚Äôs what I needed most.  
Not a partner. Not a lover.

Is this normal for INTPs relarionships?,"So I (INFJ female) had a coworker, (INTP male), a few years ago. He was the typical computer scientist, nerdy INTP type. We developed a friendship due to our shared sense of humor and supporting each other. I liked him, cared for him, and thought he did too. He was a great person, and I found him interesting‚Äîhis quirks were quite cute. After I left the company, we talked a few times, and we met up for coffee and conversation. Given his nerdy and socially awkward persona, I thought that must mean he cared for me. I thought we were friends.

Then came a time of silence that lasted for months. I contacted him a few times‚Äîhe was very nice, but he never initiated contact. I started to feel that our relationship was asymmetrical and that he wasn‚Äôt really interested in me. During this time, I went through a very delicate and aggressive brain surgery. I reached out to tell him about my condition, and I honestly told him, ‚ÄúListen, I didn‚Äôt know if I should be telling you this, because I don‚Äôt know if you care or if we‚Äôre really friends, but just in case‚Ä¶‚Äù He assured me he cared and was thankful to know, and I think he was honest‚Äîhe never seemed like a dishonest person to me.

We started talking again. A few months after my surgery, his father fell ill and died in a pretty dramatic way. I tried to be there for him. I talked to him and let him vent. I thought that meant some sort of bonding.

As I had been recovering for a while and was able to walk and do some things again, he proposed going to a restaurant and having a nice time. I thought this was very kind of him. I don‚Äôt think he knew, but he was the first person I decided to see during my recovery. I was still in bad physical condition, and he knew‚ÄîI had lost hearing on the left side, had facial paralysis, and my left eye was damaged. He knew all of this. Yet the lunch turned out to be quite awkward and painful for me. He was almost half an hour late, and when he arrived, he seemed completely in shock at my condition. I tried to mention everything, to shake off the taboo and laugh about it a little, but it didn‚Äôt work. He looked stiff and uncomfortable. When the waiter came from my blind and deaf side, he just sat there, watching me struggle, without offering any help. I felt heartbroken. And although I tried to understand that it might have been hard for him, some of his behavior didn‚Äôt sit well with me at all.

I didn‚Äôt contact him anymore, and unsurprisingly, he never reached out either. It was sad, though. I feel like he never really cared for me, and maybe I‚Äôd been pushing a friendship that was unwanted. But there‚Äôs a lot of incoherence in his behavior too.

I really don‚Äôt understand what happened. He was a pretty immature and turbulent INTP. But I cared for him.

[[Explore Top Rated cuisinart coffee maker with grinder on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/chefs-knife/?kw=cuisinart coffee maker with grinder)
## Why Choose a Cuisinart Coffee Maker with Grinder?

Before we delve into specific models,let's understand the benefits of integrating a grinder into your coffee maker. A **coffee maker with grinder** offers a meaningful advantage: freshness. Pre-ground coffee begins to lose its aroma and flavor almost immediately after grinding. Coffee beans, conversely, retain their volatile oils and flavor compounds until they are ground. By grinding your beans immediately before brewing, a **cuisinart coffee maker with built in grinder** provides a noticeably richer and more flavorful cup of coffee.

Moreover, these machines are incredibly convenient. By combining two appliances into one, they save valuable counter space and simplify the brewing process. Many **automatic coffee maker with grinder** models offer programmable features, allowing you to wake up to the enticing aroma of freshly brewed coffee every morning. For busy professionals and coffee enthusiasts alike, the convenience and superior flavor offered by a **cuisinart grind and brew coffee maker** are hard to resist.

## key Features to Consider: Finding the Right Fit

When choosing a **cuisinart coffee maker with grinder**, several factors should influence your decision:

Burr grinders, like those found in the DGB-900BC and DGB-800, are superior as they produce a consistent grind size, resulting in a more even extraction and better flavor. Blade grinders,while less expensive,chop the beans unevenly,which can lead to a bitter taste. Understanding **cuisinart grind control** differences can help you make the best choice.

*   **Capacity:** Consider how much coffee you typically brew. If you regularly brew for a family or a group, a 12-cup model may be the best fit. If you only need a few cups at a time, a **small coffee maker with grinder** like the single-serve DGB-2 might be more suitable.

*   **Programmability:** Many Cuisinart models offer programmable features, allowing you to set a timer to automatically grind and brew your coffee at a specific time. This feature is perfect for those who want to wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Look for models with adjustable auto-shutoff settings for added safety and convenience.

*   **Carafe Type:** Cuisinart offers models with both glass and thermal carafes. Thermal carafes are generally preferred as they keep coffee hot for longer without scorching it,preserving the flavor.

*   **Ease of Cleaning:** Cleaning is an essential aspect of maintaining your **cuisinart coffee maker with grinder**. Choose a model with easily removable parts and clear cleaning instructions. Refer to the **cuisinart coffee maker with grinder cleaning** manual for specific instructions.

Hi! 

I received for my birthday a De Longhi Specialista Arte Evo machine, and I am struggling to make a good espresso or a good lungo with it. I have 0 skills in coffee making - I used to buy from coffee shops my black lungo in the morning, the only coffee machine I ever owned was a regular Nespresso - so any tips are more than welcome! 

I got a few tips from the internet and the coffee roaster on how to regulate grinding and temperature but it can‚Äôt seem to work well for me. Also, I put around 10g of coffee to grind based on what I read online and in the manual. However pressure shown is always below optimal range or right at it - but even when it is it doesn‚Äôt taste that good. I never get the good amount of foam. All in all, I can‚Äôt get the links between all this parameters to properly adjust my testing, I mean for example : what makes the foaming ? Grinding level ? Amount of coffee put ? Temperature ? Pressure level ? Etc etc 

Any tips/introduction to the amazing world of coffee would be so much appreciated ! Thanks a lot ",2,1744288245.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

We‚Äôre saving for our first house in a HCOL area. We were previously renting and not able to save anything so my parents offered to help and let us move in so we could be able to save more. We also have a toddler. The only condition that my mom gave us when moving in was that we had to buy our own groceries, we didn‚Äôt have to contribute to rent. We‚Äôve been here almost 2 years now and I have not only been buying groceries for the entire house hold, but I have been funding my parents overspending. My dad retired and is receiving a pension but he just spends mindlessly. They run out of money every week and then ask me for gas money, coffee money, food, etc. my husband also lent them $5,000 one month when they were really struggling. I lent them $2,500 to go on vacation for my mom‚Äôs 60th birthday. Their cars break down, my husband pays for parts and he fixes them (he‚Äôs a mechanic). We‚Äôve easily given them almost $15,000. They have the audacity to ask how much we‚Äôve saved since living here while we‚Äôre spending $200-300 on groceries for everyone and also picking up their losses. They make me feel guilty that we are living here rent free so I should help out more financially but every time I offer to actually contribute to rent or even some of the house bills, they tell me no. My husband and I don‚Äôt want to go back to renting. In our area for a 2 bedroom condo it‚Äôs $3,000 a month. A house is between $5,000-6000. We‚Äôd never afford our own home if we were paying that. I‚Äôve tried setting boundaries with my parents in regards to the money I give them but it goes ignored then when I get mad about it they tell me I have an attitude problem.

I moved an hour away several years ago. Long story short, she wanted out of the city and fell in love with everything about the area that I moved to. The school district, housing prices, smaller town feel, etc. it was everything they wanted for their kids, plus having each other as a support system, since she didn‚Äôt have much of one to begin with. So after several months of her and her husband weighing out the pros and cons, they pulled the trigger.

I wish I would have prefaced this with: her husband at one point was seeing another woman behind her back 3-4 years prior.

Ok! So now they‚Äôve moved. He still commutes to work for the time being and sometimes even stays over night near his work in the city to cut down on commute time (again for the time being). Then of a sudden I‚Äôm hearing less and less from her now that he has a job here and doesn‚Äôt commute. 

Her husband is all of a sudden paranoid that she‚Äôs being unfaithful. This continues over the course of a year. We go from coffee on her porch every Tuesday, to maybe a text once a week, to nothing‚Ä¶

He even had the nerve to say she was unfaithful and being shady with my husband. It would never ever happen. My husband simply texted her one day because he was going over there to help move a dresser for her when they first moved in. Her husband wasn‚Äôt home and I was there too! It‚Äôs insane, and I feel like he‚Äôs doing it just to push us away and alienate her.

I did come out and ask her if we could get together several times to where it seems like she‚Äôs only willing to if we meet up at the mall, or some sort of public place. She never stops by anymore as she said he tracks her location and if she veers off her route to work, she is questioned and scolded.

I‚Äôm so sad. She is such a hard working mom, wife and employee. She would never step out on her marriage. It was never supposed to be like this. Our kids were supposed to grow up together, we had all these plans. And now I don‚Äôt even see or know who she is anymore.

I wish so much to just send him a shitty message and tell him how he has cut my friend down to being a shell of a human being. I don‚Äôt hate. But I do hate him, and it‚Äôs sad because I never did, we always got along. Idk sorry about this. I just miss my best friend üòî

I'm also mid 40s and had a hysterectomy 5 years ago that led to the weight gain pushing me into early menopause so nothing I did over those 5 years regulated my hormones enough to not keep losing and gaining the same stone at the top end over and over.

I‚Äôve been on MJ since October (one month at 2.5, 2 months each on 5 & 7.5 and now I‚Äôm on week 6 of 10mg). Towards the end of the second month of 7.5 I had already lost 1/3^(rd) ( 2 stone) of the weight I needed to lose but noticed I was barely losing 1lb for the last couple of weeks so my thinking was to go up to 10mg for a month to see if that was the only boost needed.

Now, I‚Äôve lost just 2lb in 6 weeks on 10mg, I‚Äôm baffled and worried that that‚Äôs it for me now.

For the first few months I couldn‚Äôt do my usual exercise (mix of HIIT, Strength, Core Conditioning) without feeling really sick during it (Nausea has been the worst symptom for me on MJ) but I‚Äôve been trying to push past that these last couple of weeks thinking that must be what is lacking.

Water intake has always been over 3L as I don‚Äôt drink tea, coffee or anything like soft drinks anyway, never have. Protein is high- because peri menopause food recommendations and all that.

I don‚Äôt think my smaller body could handle 12.5 - I‚Äôm eating about 750 cals a day and I‚Äôm genuinely having to force those. I don‚Äôt want further suppression, to eat less than this because I fear that eating too few calories and getting used to those much smaller amounts will be the sure fire way to gain it all back FAST once I get to the maintenance phase and start eating TDEE cals.

I‚Äôm also noticing my hair is feeling noticeably thinner since 7.5-10 . Its really fine and mid/short anyway so I am starting to see my scalp and that‚Äôs scaring me so I‚Äòm wanting to start titrating down not up sooner rather than later.

Any advice to keep losing without upping the dose? Or maybe I go back down to 7.5 as that was working? My BMI is currently 26.3 and I‚Äôve almost exactly a stone to lose still.",2,1744288099.0,mounjarouk,2,1.0,False

1jvwlxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ApplicationChance745/comments/1jvwlxp/5_innovative_interior_design_concepts_for/,5 Innovative Interior Design Concepts for Commercial Spaces in 2025,"As commercial spaces evolve to meet new business models, customer expectations, and hybrid work trends, the role of interior design is shifting beyond aesthetics. Today, it‚Äôs about creating **experiential environments** that influence behavior, communicate brand identity, and maximize flexibility.

Here are five elevated interior design concepts I‚Äôve been working with that are especially relevant for commercial environments in 2025:

**1. Experience-Led Spatial Design**  
Modern consumers crave more than service‚Äîthey want an experience. This means designing commercial interiors that tell a story. From curated scent and soundscapes to interactive digital installations, the focus is on creating immersive moments that deepen brand connection. In retail, this could mean gallery-style product displays. In hospitality, it could involve flexible pop-up zones that shift weekly to surprise repeat visitors.

**2. Smart Spatial Adaptability**  
Gone are the days of static commercial interiors. Businesses are rethinking long-term leases and shifting toward modular setups. Think sliding acoustic partitions, adjustable-height counters, mobile walls with integrated shelving, and lighting systems that adapt to different functions or times of day. A space should be able to pivot between a high-energy team session in the morning to a calm, client-facing setting in the afternoon.

**3. Hospitality Crossover Aesthetic**  
Even in corporate or retail environments, the ""resimercial"" trend is evolving into a more polished hospitality aesthetic. That means commercial spaces are taking cues from boutique hotels: rich textures, ambient lighting, tactile materials, and a focus on comfort. Lounges in lobbies. Artisanal coffee corners in offices. Soft furnishings in boardrooms. It‚Äôs about creating commercial environments people *want* to be in, not just work in.

**4. Purposeful Sustainability**  
Sustainability has moved beyond buzzword status. In 2025, it‚Äôs about transparency and narrative‚Äîdesigning with reclaimed materials, carbon-neutral suppliers, and showcasing those choices through storytelling in the space itself. Signage that explains material sourcing or walls made from repurposed building waste become part of the visual language and brand story. It‚Äôs not just eco-conscious‚Äîit‚Äôs marketable.

**5. Sensory Layering for Behavior Design**  
Designing with senses in mind‚Äîbeyond visual‚Äîis becoming essential. Using lighting to energize or relax, temperature zones to guide movement, sound masking for focused work, or scent branding to make spaces memorable are all part of creating an emotional response. Sensory design doesn‚Äôt just enhance mood‚Äîit can influence time spent in a space, sales behavior, and productivity.

These concepts aren't just trends‚Äîthey‚Äôre responses to how people engage with space in an era of high expectation, brand saturation, and shifting work-life dynamics. I‚Äôd love to know what other designers here are focusing on this year. Are your clients prioritizing tech, flexibility, or something else entirely?",1,1744287896.0,u_ApplicationChance745,0,1.0,False

1jvwkib,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1jvwkib/is_he_an_abuser_is_this_enough_to_leave/,Is he an abuser? Is this enough to leave?,"My marriage has become emotionally and physically draining because of my husband‚Äôs behavior. His aggressive and manipulative actions constantly create tension in our home. He often gets angry over small things, like the baby waking up at 3 a.m., and when he‚Äôs frustrated, he acts aggressively, stomping around and visibly irritated. Recently, he even said that it would be easier if he weren‚Äôt around, which only increases my feelings of insecurity. Although he started seeing a psychiatrist and is taking antidepressants, his reactions still involve emotional manipulation, threats of suicide when we fight, and constant manipulation of my feelings.

His behavior sometimes crosses into physical violence, like the time a year and a half ago, in the middle of the night, when I was breastfeeding the baby and he slapped me. He claimed he was just trying to calm me down. This happened at 2 a.m., and every time I bring it up, he insists that it was nothing, that I‚Äôm exaggerating and annoying him. He frequently shifts the blame onto me, saying that his actions are a result of my behavior. For example, while we‚Äôve needed a new car seat for the baby for months, he‚Äôd rather spend money on more expensive items like an Apple Watch, avoiding purchasing what is actually necessary. His approach to household tasks is also irresponsible ‚Äî for example, the sink in our bathroom has been broken for a year, but he will immediately spend money on personal things instead of fixing it.

In one incident, he even told me that he would like to pour the urine from the potty on my head. A few days ago, he stormed out of the house without his phone or watch, leaving me unable to contact him. He supposedly went to find a place to kill himself. At one point, he told me that if I wanted a divorce, I should leave the apartment because, in his words, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to provide anything for the children. Later, he changed his mind and said that he would ‚Äúbe okay‚Äù and that things would be better, but I am left confused and scared.

When he doesn‚Äôt get his way, he often threatens to leave the house or says that I won‚Äôt get the kids if I decide to leave. His emotional manipulation is constant ‚Äî he always makes me feel like I‚Äôm the one at fault, even for his outbursts. Once, he even said that he would like to pour hot water from the kettle I was using to make coffee on me. After one of our arguments, he locked himself in the bedroom, and our older child (3) refused to go in because he could sense his bad mood and aggression.

He also frequently reminds me that I‚Äôm a stay-at-home mom, which was an arrangement we agreed upon, and that I don‚Äôt have my own income. My younger child (1,5) won‚Äôt start preschool until September, so I can‚Äôt go to work until then. His behavior includes constant threats of violence, emotional blackmail, and him pulling away. When I try to have a calm conversation, he refuses to communicate or threatens that I‚Äôll be responsible for his bad reactions. It feels like everything revolves around his needs and desires, while mine are completely disregarded. Even when he occasionally tries to be better, he quickly reverts to his old behavior, leaving me feeling drained.

A few days ago, I gave him what I said would be his last chance, as he promised he would leave the apartment if he reacted aggressively again. But now, he is playing a role, pretending to be better and behaving well. This ‚Äúperformance‚Äù is exhausting for me, as I feel like he is only doing it to avoid consequences, rather than genuinely changing. I am left feeling frustrated and on edge, questioning whether I might be the one to blame for everything, and wondering if I‚Äôm maybe the one who‚Äôs been the cause of all this.

Gusto ko rin maranasan coffee dates, maglakad lakad sa dagat during sunset habang mag kaholding hands, movie date, concert date tapos magkaakbay kayo habang sumasabay sa kanta, picnic date kahit tusok tusok lang yung food, sleep over date yung tipong magka-cuddle kayo then watch movies together, date sa park with pets (dogs or cats whatever kahit hamster yan gew lang), date sa mall then bibili kayo ng matching clothes to wear sa next date, magpicture sa photobooth para may ilagay sa likod ng phone case, gusto ko rin yung bibili kayo sa anik-anik store ng matching bracelets or keychain.

Napapaisip ako bakit sa iba ang dali nila makahanap? Maybe kasi pogi sila, samantalang ako mukhang patatas haha. Di rin ganon katangos ilong ko ksks. Ewan q ba ang drama ko ata. Sinasabi ng friends ko makakahanap din daw ako. Well easy for them to say kasi may nahanap na sila or natry na nila mag-enter into a relationship.

1jvwgem,https://i.redd.it/ab11ujxx10ue1.jpeg,First flash brew of the year,"I haven‚Äôt made a flash brew in the Hario Switch before so I tried it this morning. I crossed my usual flash brew recipe (1:15, 40% ice) with my usual Devils recipe and it actually turned out phenomenal. Only 3 pours because I accidentally over poured and decided to just do bloom, pour, immersion in about 3:30. 40g medium ground coffee, 80g 1min bloom (90c switch closed)), slow pour up to 260g (90c switch open) and once all of that drained pour to 360 (70c switch closed). Open at 3:30. All over 240g ice. I‚Äôll probably go 2 clicks finer than I did today when I go again tomorrow and will experiment with doing 2 smaller pours with the same bloom and immersion stages to see how it changes but I forgot how fantastic a good flash brew is.

1jvwfwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jvwfwk/i_feel_like_my_husband_doesnt_like_me/,I feel like my Husband doesnt like me,"I (32 F) have been in a relationship with my (34 M) Husband for 17 years. High school sweethearts type of thing. We have 4 kids together. Like any couple weve had our ups and downs.

Lately ive been feeling like Im the one chasing him. Im usually the one that hugs him kisses him and usually initiate. He reciprocates but I think i shouldnt be the only one. 

Before anybody jumps to cheating, Im 100% sure thats not it. This man is completely connected to me. Phone wise. Hes not ""tech savvy"" and has me set up everything for him, from his google, email, social media. He says it easier if I connect his phone to mine because Ill remember my password. 

Now on to the issue. Apparently Im the one with the higher drive. So even when Im not attempting to initiate anything I think hes never to sure. So at night time I love my cuddles, so were always close, sometimes ill accidentally touch his area. When I do that hes been turning away from me, even of it was just as i move my hand. No lingering. 

He cliams he doesnt know hes doing that, that hes asleep. But its been happening everytime for the last couple of weeks. Even though Im not attempting anything I feel rejected. I tried bringing it up this morning in a joking manner and he got upset. 

It went like this:
Me: Hey next time I accidentally touch you and you turn away were fighting
Him: Omg youre already gonna start 
Proceeds to walk away

I asked what his problem was that I was just playing. He says its like the dreams, Ive had dreams of him cheating, but in my defense I know theyre dreams and I dont treat him like theyre real. He refers to the fact that I will say things like ""your girlfriend"". Always playing. And he usually plays along asking if they were at least cute. So Im confused as to why hes all of a sudden mad about that. 

It kind of turned into and argument after that. I made his coffee and made sure he had ice water in his jug and turned on his car so he can go to work. I feel bad if I dont do the usual things before he leaves, even if were not getting along at the moment.

Sorry if its everywhere I have alot going through my head and dont know what to put in this post.

1jvweli,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/1jvweli/customers_thats_it/,Customers that‚Äôs it,"Pretty much got the most bullshit customer complaint today.

Last week I served two customers at 5:15pm which is also the time we close the coffee machine for the day. And they went off their nutter complaining
about how apparently ‚Äúour store is always closed‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äôs come in at 12pm and have been told we‚Äôre closed for being understaffed‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how you guys run a place like this‚Äù 

Which is all lies as we have not been closed during the day since I‚Äôve worked there (7 months) and our boss is very much obsessed with us staying open as long as possible so he‚Äôd never allow it

We ended up directing them to another store to get coffee.

Then today I saw the same customers walk up so I went and did another task while my coworker served them. It was probably over a 5 minute interaction between them getting their coffee and talking to my coworker

Turns out they were pretty much complaining about the service they got last week and told my coworker we refused to serve them coffee at 1:30pm which is ridiculous because as I was working with the manager and she would never let that happen and the coworker I was with when we originally served them wasn‚Äôt even on shift.

Some customers are just insane I swear, like how delusional are you to come up with such lies and potentially get an innocent worker in Trouble because you didn‚Äôt get what you wanted. Grown adults need to stop throwing tantrums
