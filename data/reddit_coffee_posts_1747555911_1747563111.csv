1kpglp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1kpglp5/mormon_hypocrisy_at_its_finest/,Mormon hypocrisy at its finest.,"The hypocrisy from my Mormon friend on a recent international trip astounds me. I drank the delicious, local coffee daily during our trip. Meanwhile, my Mormon friend brought loads of powdered caffeine mixes for water bottle consumption on the daily and purchased various caffeinated soda drinks. They commented on people with ‚Äúcoffee breath‚Äù as though they were the scourge of the earth (as I proudly enjoyed my cappuccino). Needless to say, I bit my tongue the entire trip. 

They even brought up how their grandparent left the Mormon church because they were ‚Äúoffended.‚Äù I did say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure there was more to it than that,‚Äù but left out anything further. 

Other points of conversation included how they and their in-laws are terrible with money, have multiple mortgages on their home, and may ultimately lose their home. But it didn‚Äôt matter because, ‚Äúthey can‚Äôt take it with them in the afterlife.‚Äù It‚Äôs this kind of attitude toward financial health, education, caring for our planet, etc. that truly bother me about Mormons. Perhaps if they weren‚Äôt so focused on the next life, they would value this life more. 

The trip was about exploring a new country, seeing the sites, and having a great time, not about trying to get my friend to doubt the Mormon cult. I do love my friend dearly, but it was mentally exhausting for me to listen to so much Mormon drivel. ",1,1747563017.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

1kpgg3h,https://i.redd.it/rklp99q6ki1f1.jpeg,Does he ever think about reconciling?,"For context, I saw this man for four months who was temporarily working and living in my country and all was going amazingly. He insinuated that we were headed towards commitment, consistently told me how much he liked me and met my family. He even said to me that he told his family back home that he was seeing me too. We had similar values, interests and I basically fell in love before I realised it. I was essentially his girlfriend without the label for four months. He brought me a hairbrush and toothbrush to keep at his house as I stayed over quite a bit. 

Around the four month mark he pulled back and started acting distant so I gave him space. When I did eventually gently broach how he felt about our connection he turned very cold and suddenly said ‚Äúwe would have to call it off soon anyway‚Äù due to him leaving my country in the future. I was quite hurt so I called it off. For the next two years he continued to contact me sporadically checking in, even though I didn‚Äôt contact him again. 

Two years later, right before he was due to leave, he asked to see me in person for coffee. I stupidly agreed as I was hoping for some form of closure. When I saw him he behaved bizarrely and still was hot and cold towards me. He never discussed what happened between us or apologised. I blocked him afterwards and still feel at a loss to what happened. I understand this is a silly spread but I was wondering if anyone has any perspectives on this spread. I believe the cards are saying that despite his eagerness to see me before he left (four of wands), it was a purely a friendly gesture (six of cups) to alleviate any guilt he had for how he initially left me (five of pentacles) and there is no further desire for reconciliation.",1,1747562389.0,Tarotpractices,1,1.0,False

1kpgfft,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1kpgfft/hepato_burn_and_how_liver_detox_may_affect_body/,Hepato Burn and how liver detox may affect body fat and energy,"I used to think I was doing everything right - clean meals, daily walks, watching sugar, but still, that **belly fat** wouldn‚Äôt budge. I wasn‚Äôt even trying to get six-pack abs. I just wanted to feel lighter, healthier, and not so drained all the time. But the results never matched the effort.

Eventually, I stopped blaming myself and started asking different questions. One that kept popping up: *what if my body isn‚Äôt burning fat because something inside is off?* That led me straight to the liver.

**Your liver may be the missing link in fat loss**

We talk a lot about calories, carbs, and cardio, but we rarely talk about the **liver**. And yet, it‚Äôs one of the most important organs for **fat metabolism**. Every bite of food you eat passes through the liver. It decides whether those nutrients get burned as fuel or stored as **body fat**.

If your **liver function** is compromised - from stress, processed food, alcohol, medications - it can become sluggish. That‚Äôs when fat burning slows, energy drops, and fat, especially around the belly, starts piling on.

That realization changed how I approached **weight loss**.

**Why I tried Hepato Burn**

I started looking into **natural liver cleanse** options and came across **Hepato Burn** in a few discussions. What caught my eye was the dual focus: it wasn‚Äôt just about detoxing. It also aimed to support **liver function** and help improve **metabolism**.

The ingredients were all plant-based: green tea extract, resveratrol, silymarin, choline, glutathione, known for supporting both **liver detoxification** and **fat burning**.

Here‚Äôs the link I used to read more about it:  
[**Check Hepato Burn details here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2K78HHXJ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)

**What I noticed after a few weeks**

Week one was uneventful, but by week two, I was waking up with more energy. I didn‚Äôt need that second cup of coffee, and I wasn‚Äôt crashing mid-afternoon. That alone felt like a win.

Week three? The bloat I‚Äôd been carrying around finally eased. My stomach felt lighter. My pants started fitting better - not drastically, but noticeably. I didn‚Äôt lose a ton of pounds, but my **body fat** felt like it was finally going in the right direction.

My cravings mellowed out too. I wasn‚Äôt rummaging through the kitchen at night like I used to.

This is the second page I bookmarked to keep checking ingredients and benefits:  
[**Explore Hepato Burn benefits**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2K78HHXJ/?uid=35947&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)

**How a detoxed liver may support weight loss**

Your liver doesn‚Äôt need extreme cleansing. It just needs support to do what it‚Äôs built to do - break down fat, filter toxins, and regulate energy. A sluggish liver can stall all that, even if you‚Äôre doing everything else right.

That‚Äôs why a good **liver detox supplement** can make a difference. It‚Äôs not about forcing weight loss. It‚Äôs about helping your body function better so it can start burning **fat** more efficiently, especially in those stubborn areas.

**Final thoughts on Hepato Burn and liver-focused fat burning**

If you‚Äôve ever felt stuck with no explanation, and nothing you do seems to make a dent in your **belly fat**, take a step back and look at your **liver health**. For me, **Hepato Burn** was a quiet shift in the right direction - better energy, less bloat, and finally feeling like my body was working with me instead of against me.

Anyone else experiment with **liver detox supplements** or target **liver function** for fat loss? I‚Äôd love to hear what helped or what didn‚Äôt in your journey.",1,1747562310.0,HowToLoseWeightFST,0,1.0,False

I believe you‚Äôre the type to love strongly as well.

And without it, It feels as if a part of you is missing, a part of you that makes you.. well, \*you\*.I can be really sappy at times :) But I do have a eccentric and excitable side to me that I‚Äôm prone to letting out when I like someone. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh I need to share as much as I can with this person!‚Äù You know‚Ä¶? And like every person on earth, I have my faults. Sometimes I stay up late at night \*just\* to think and nothing more. Sometimes ordering takeout is a much more preferable option than home cooking, I get lost in a trance when it comes to arts and crafts. And worst of all, I stay inside more than I‚Äôd like. 

Despite my love for travel, my anxiety makes it difficult to meet people. Sometimes sitting on the roof and people watching like some exotic grey haired bird feels safer. But all in all, I do try. Growing with someone, discovering each other in every aspect‚Ä¶ that is incredibly important to me.

I‚Äôm very fond of firsts, and there have been many things I‚Äôve been selfishly saving for that special connection I yearn for. I have a fondness for digging deep into other people‚Äôs minds and \*especially\* making firsts with them. Like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never seen a sky full of stars. Let‚Äôs do that together? Nor have I been camping, or walking along a lakeside, I‚Äôve never tried salt coffee in Vietnam, or painted with pastels in Hungary. The point is‚Ä¶ I love making memories and trying something new, it would be made all the better with \*you\*.As for appearance‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to meet a man who values words over looks. But I will describe a bit of myself to you, and down the line if we‚Äôre smitten, I can give you my main account.For now: My eyes are big and dark (usually tired), my hair short and dyed grey, I have a nose piercing and a lip piercing, I bet my hands could fit perfectly in yours. I‚Äôm 162 cm (5'4), strong , fit, and curvy (working towards being thin). I‚Äôm small in statue but have a big personality :) I‚Äôm seeking out those ages 24-37

1kpgckc,https://v.redd.it/pvt4hndxii1f1,Opinions on my ‚Äúflex recipe‚Äù,"After years of trying different techniques this is the one I use everyday. I call it flex Recipe just because there‚Äôs a lot of reading and adaptation based on a base recipe. 

One could call it a remix of James Hoffman recipes. One thing that I could never master was swirling or stirring the coffee either on bloom or draw down. In my experience it had a good risk of adding bitterness to the cup. 

To counteract the lack of swirl, I use a lot of flow control in the bloom phase, high enough and keeping the laminar flow going to help mix and saturate the bed, amount is generous (3x the amount of coffee but really I just go by looks. I prefer to over saturate rather than under saturate).

Then after 45-60 seconds I do a single pour. Here the base pour is usually a steady laminar flow in circles, with moderate agitation - until it hits 150 - from there I keep it low and steady in the center. 

When it‚Äôs close to 230-240 I do a last circle from a higher spot to somewhat flatten the bed. Reaching the 250g mark

What I like about where I am now with this method is that I understand most of how each variable will affect the final result. Usually the adjustments go mostly on levels of agitation. Either reducing the pour height, or tweaking the ratio between the circle pour vs centre pour.

- grind size is usually between 4.5 / 5 mark on the ZP6
- Boiling water for base recipe. But I reduce temp after bloom depending on bean type (decafs, some darker roasts)
- draw down time is less of a target but an indicator. It‚Äôs usually at 2m but I don‚Äôt care too much about it as my bloom phase sometimes goes longer


Any opinions on this type of pour?

*December 9, 2024*

I (29 F) have this friend (30 F) who booked their wedding date 6 days before ours. For background, his boyfriend, I and my fiance went to the same university. We're not that close but fast forward, the 4 of us are currently working abroad and became close over the span of 2 years. Close friends as in we were together for almost every week for that period. My fiance and I got engaged last June and we booked the date, venue and other major suppliers on the same month. We immediately told our friend group about the date so that they can plot it in their calendar ahead of time. I have been sharing every detail to this close friend of mine since she already appointed herself as one of my bridesmaids (which I really intend to). Then 4 months after, this close friend of mine got engaged which I'm obviously happy with until she told me a month ago that they picked a date which is 6 DAYS BEFORE OURS.

I was so shocked because it seems like she didn't consider the people around her. We have common friends who will both be attending on our wedding and both of our wedding will be held at the same city, 4 hours away from the metro. I immediately told her that I might not be on her wedding since for sure I'll be busy a week before my wedding since I have no coordinator. I live abroad & will held our wedding in our home country which I only took a work leave for 3 weeks max. There's a lot to do for last minute preparations. After telling her that, she replied to me ""It's okay I understand"" then goes out to my room as if the info she told me is only an ""FYI"" which hurts me a little more because she doesn't care if I'll be at her wedding or not. She's in my bridesmaids list but I'm planning to remove her due to this.

I didn't talk to her about this but I've been hurting since then. At the end of the day, its not within my control. She can pick any date she wants but I just hope she considered me in any way. So AITA for having this feeling? What should I do? How can I tell her about removing her on my list without getting into these details? I played in my mind what if I open up my feelings to her but I think she'll play the victim or as if I'm overreacting.

Commenters say she should be removed as a bridesmaid.

PS: They booked the same team who will cover our wedding photos. She showed me the venue that‚Äôs a 2nd choice in her list but I immediately told her in a jokingly way not to choose that because we already did a downpayment for that venue. I‚Äôm not sure if she still proceeded with it or not. But she told me it‚Äôs the same city with ours. 

- 

You expect her to travel to your home country, which is also her home country, but she isn't allowed to get married while she is there? Does she, and all of your friends, have enough money to travel twice? How long do you expect her to wait to get married? You get the day but that is it.

I was engaged and we had set the wedding date. My uncle then got engaged and they asked if they could get married 6 days before we did and we told them sure. Everyone got to travel once for two weddings. No one had to choose between weddings. It worked very well. They got married and made it back in time to attend our wedding.

But I was hurt with the way she told me about it, the way everything‚Äôs just okay with her & I‚Äôm worrying about our friends‚Äô schedules. We all leave in the same home country, same city - I just wish it‚Äôs not the same week with mine. These common friends will have to drive back & forth twice that week since staying there for a week is expensive and most of them will spend time with their family in the metro as well in the middle of those 2 weddings. We have the same prior weekend where our bachelorette parties will be held. We have some same bridesmaids as well but we don‚Äôt have the same group of friends in our home country. And most importantly she told me that info as if it‚Äôs an FYI.

- 

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre good enough friends that she assumed she‚Äôs in the wedding party but doesn‚Äôt care that she can‚Äôt make it.‚Äù - This is so on point. I was hurt on the way she informed me about it knowing that it‚Äôll affect my schedule says a lot on how she values our friendship. I valued this friendship more than she did - that‚Äôs the main reason why I was hurt. I didn‚Äôt expect that. We went to this country together, just the 2 of us. Applied for jobs together, got our jobs together (different companies) and such. I want to see her walking down the aisle.. which is impossible now. 

- 

2 weeks is different to having it on the same week. And I also hope she asked me first or at least give more details about picking the date beforehand. Because she only said the date, it‚Äôs final without further any other details. That‚Äôs why I felt like she didn‚Äôt care at all. If she told me about it the same way you did, I wouldn‚Äôt be hurt at all. 

- 

Just wanted to add, I want to cut her off but I just couldn‚Äôt. My question is AITA for feeling this way? I think I cannot remove the fact that we will see each other since we‚Äôre in the same friend group. But now I understand how she values our friendship, maybe I‚Äôll just reciprocate just on that level. I wouldn‚Äôt go beyond for this friend anymore. IT‚ÄôS NOTED. It‚Äôs been a month already, I‚Äôm trying to ignore it. I‚Äôm answering whenever she calls me but I‚Äôm not that lively anymore whenever I talk to her. She never brings up wedding staff after she told me about their date. I just heard she‚Äôs meeting other friends in our group and telling them about the date without us. She even gave more details about it to them than to me who‚Äôll have a wedding on the same week.

*May 17, 2025, about 5 months later*

Hello! Just wanted to give an update. Thank you for all the insights regarding my previous post.

So at first, I didn‚Äôt cutoff my ‚Äúclose friend‚Äù because I‚Äôm trying my best to remind myself that this is their wedding, not mine so I have no control over it. But something definitely changed between us, I know she knows it too.

Few months later, her fiance messaged & asked my fiance to be his groomsman. He even requested for my fiance to allot at least 2-3 days of his time to prepare as a groomsman. My blood boiled, they set their wedding 6 days before ours then he had the audacity to ask for the prep days? Take note, that‚Äôs for the role of an entourage, so they knew that a groom needs maybe more than 6 days to prep for his own wedding. My fiance politely declined and explained that we have things to polish days before our wedding since we have no coordinator and we have a lot of things to do - last minute prep.

This girl also asked me about being a bridesmaid but I politely declined as well. She lowkey asked me if they‚Äôre still invited but indirectly told her that we will remove them on our list and we‚Äôre considering that they‚Äôre on their honeymoon anyways. I was furious again on how inconsiderate they are so I decided to talk to her to open up about how I felt.

So we went for a coffee and talked about the issue. None of us said sorry. She told me that if she was in my shoes, she wouldn‚Äôt feel mad about what they did. She feels like based on my personality, I was just too emotional as a person that‚Äôs why I took it the way I did. She really wishes me to be part of her entourage & thought that 6 days is enough. I told her it‚Äôs easier to think that when your wedding is on the first few days of the week and not on the latter. His fiance even asked 3 days for prep as a groosman so they know that a groom needs to prep more than 6 days especially if there‚Äôs last minute things that we need to handle.

After the talk, I realized that our EQ weren‚Äôt just the same because I would never be so inconsiderate to a close friend of mine. We‚Äôre not going to each other‚Äôs wedding but we‚Äôll support each other as a bride. I recommended suppliers that she still needs and she does the same. After that talk, I took a step back to our friendship and went back to being an acquaintance. I never had a friend like that, I focused on my true friends but somehow I still feel bad about it.

It‚Äôs really an unfortunate event, what‚Äôs most sad about it is it affected how I viewed the wedding planning phase. My enthusiasm to it really skyrocketed down and I feel really bad to my fiance. I always see this couple since we‚Äôre in a small group of friends working abroad but we‚Äôre slowly starting to set some boundaries like not inviting them to my bday since I don‚Äôt feel good whenever I see them. My fiance is very protective of me and very objective to this issue. He already told me before not to get too close with this girl because he feels like she‚Äôs always prioritizing herself without consideration on the people around her (there are some instances before) but I even fought him about his view to her. Our other friends doesn‚Äôt know about this issue and I felt like it will be awkward when we send the invites & they‚Äôll know that this couple isn‚Äôt invited. I don‚Äôt want to retell the story anymore.

>>The topic came out once & we told them we couldn‚Äôt come to their wedding since it‚Äôs close to ours and we need time for last minute prep. We will spend over a million in our currency so we will try our best to make things go smoothly. And they told us what if the girl and the guy wouldn‚Äôt come as well to our wedding due to that? I told them they‚Äôre on their honeymoon anyways. But I actually just uninvited them since I won‚Äôt feel good on my wedding day seeing them both - which is so hard to tell because I need to tell again the story. I‚Äôm scared to be painted as too emotional but if it comes to that, be it. At least I‚Äôm considerate.

""Everything okay?"" I asked, setting my backpack down.

She glanced up, then quickly back down. ""Fine.""

""Jenny,"" I said quietly, ""I know about the door. I'm going to try to close it.""

Her head snapped up, eyes wide with fear‚Äîand recognition?

""You can't,"" she whispered.

""Maggie Olson thinks we can. Tonight.""

Jenny's hands stilled. ""They won't let you.""

""Who won't?""

""The visitors."" She stepped back. ""They're watching. Always watching.""

I studied her face, noticing how pale she looked, how her eyes never quite focused.

""Jenny, when was the last time you saw Tony Gustafson?""

She flinched. ""I have to go.""

As she hurried toward the door, I called after her: ""Jenny, wait!""

She paused, hand on the door.

""Be careful driving home,"" I said lamely.

A strange smile crossed her face. ""I don't drive anymore. Tony picks me up.""

The door closed. Through the window, I watched her walk across the dark parking lot to where a figure waited beside an old Camry. The man's face was in shadow, but his posture seemed wrong‚Äîtoo stiff.

As they drove away, a chill settled over me, colder than the Minnesota winter.

The hours until midnight crawled. I followed the rules mechanically‚Äîlocked the bathroom, unplugged coffee machines‚Äîpreparing. At 11:45, I checked the breaker box, familiarizing myself.

At 12:30, the phone rang‚Äîoff-schedule. I let it ring three times. ""Kwik Trip 483,"" I answered cautiously.

""Don't let them in."" Tony Gustafson's voice, hollow, distant. ""They'll trap us forever.""

""Tony? Where are you?""

""Between. We're all between."" His voice grew fainter. ""The door goes both ways, Finn. Don't‚Äî""

The line went dead.

At 1:15 AM, headlights swept the lot. Uncle Lars's truck. Three figures emerged‚ÄîLars, Sven, and Maggie, carrying a large canvas bag.

They entered. I nodded. ""Ready?""

Maggie's eyes darted to the cameras. ""Do it now.""

I hurried to the storage room and pulled the main breaker. Darkness. Emergency lights cast weak pools.

As my eyes adjusted, I saw Maggie and Sven moving swiftly toward the bathroom, Lars close behind. Thirty seconds. I restored power. Lights flickered, computers rebooted.

I returned to find the bathroom door ajar, voices murmuring. Approaching cautiously, I peered in.

The small space was transformed. Candles burned. Maggie drew a complex pattern on the floor with chalk, reciting words in a language I didn't recognize. Sven and Lars stood by, holding open an ancient book.

""Good, you're here,"" Maggie said without looking up. ""We need to begin.""

""Stand in the center,"" Maggie instructed, completing the symbols‚Äîconcentric circles, strange runes. ""We don't have much time.""

I hesitated. ""What exactly are we doing?""

""Sealing the breach,"" she replied, lighting another candle. ""The bathroom is built directly over the old cellar. The door between worlds is weakest here.""

The bathroom looked different. Walls pulsed subtly, breathing. The mirror reflected shadows that didn't match us.

""The entities crossed over gradually,"" Maggie continued, arranging small objects‚Äîstone, feather, water, burnt wood. ""First through dreams, then reflections. Eventually, physically, but only at certain times.""

""That's why the rules specify times,"" I realized. ""3:33 AM, 4:13 AM.""

""Exactly. Boundaries weaken at specific moments."" Maggie gestured for me to enter the circle. ""We need to perform the ritual exactly at 3:33.""

Sven checked his watch. ""Twenty minutes.""

I stepped carefully into the center. The pendant felt warm.

""What now?""

""We wait,"" Lars said, positioning himself by the door. ""And hope nothing interferes.""

Minutes ticked by in tense silence. Outside, the store was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet.

At 3:25 AM, the lights flickered. A low hum built in the walls, vibrating through the floor.

""They know,"" Maggie whispered, clutching her book. ""They're coming.""

The temperature dropped. My breath clouded. The mirror fogged, strange symbols appearing in condensation.

""Stand ready,"" Sven warned, pulling a knife. He pricked his finger, letting blood fall onto the chalk. ""Blood of the bereaved to bind the door.""

Maggie did the same. ""Blood of the seeker to find the way.""

Lars followed. ""Blood of the land to guard the threshold.""

They looked at me.

""Blood of the witness to seal the breach,"" Maggie prompted.

Sven handed me the knife. I pricked my finger, watching the crimson droplet fall. It sizzled, the chalk glowing red.

The hum intensified. The mirror cracked from edge to edge with a sound like breaking ice.

""It's starting,"" Maggie said, opening the book. ""When I begin, repeat the response after each line. Don't stop, no matter what you see or hear.""

I nodded, throat dry.

""3:32,"" Sven announced. ""Ten seconds. Five, four, three, two.""

At exactly 3:33 AM, Maggie began to recite words that sounded ancient‚Äîharsh consonants, flowing vowels that made my ears ache. After each phrase, she paused, and I repeated a response in the same language.

Walls trembled. Dust fell. The black water coalesced into a vaguely humanoid shape, reaching toward us.

""Keep going,"" Lars urged when I faltered.

Maggie's voice grew stronger, words tumbling faster. The chalk lines glowed‚Äîwhite, then blue, then deep purple. The air felt charged.

The water creature lunged but couldn't cross the glowing boundary. It shrieked in frustration.

""We close the path,"" Maggie intoned in English.

""We close the path,"" I repeated.

""We seal the door.""

""We seal the door.""

""By blood and word, by fire and stone.""

I echoed her, feeling a strange power building, pressure against my eardrums.

The bathroom door slammed shut, then burst open. Standing in the doorway was Jenny, but her face was wrong‚Äîeyes too wide, smile too stretched.

""Stop,"" she said, voice overlaid with others. ""You're making a terrible mistake.""

""Keep going,"" Sven growled. ""It's not her.""

""The spirits aren't your enemies,"" Jenny continued, stepping forward. ""They offer gifts. Knowledge. Power.""

""Ignore it,"" Lars said.

Maggie hadn't stopped. I forced myself to follow, repeating each phrase, words like sand in my mouth.

Jenny's form flickered, briefly showing something else beneath‚Äîtoo many joints, too many eyes.

""Your uncle knows the truth,"" she hissed, focus shifting to Lars. ""Tell them what really happened in the cellar, Lars Larson. Tell them what your grandfather took.""

Lars flinched but held his ground. ""Keep going!""

The chalk lines flared brighter. The black water creature wailed, dissolving.

Jenny's face contorted in rage. ""Fools! You'll trap them forever!""

""That's the point,"" Sven muttered.

""Not them,"" Jenny snarled, pointing at me. ""Them!""

Behind her, more figures appeared‚ÄîTony Gustafson, skin paper-white, eyes hollow. Beside him, a young man who looked so much like Sven he could only be Erik.

Maggie faltered, a small cry escaping her. ""Erik?""

""Mom,"" the figure said. ""Please stop. We can't come back if you close it.""

Sven stepped forward. ""It's not him. It's using his image.""

""It is me, Dad."" Erik's voice broke. ""I'm trapped between worlds. The ritual won't free us‚Äîit'll seal us away forever.""

Tears streamed down Maggie's face, but she continued, voice shaking. I repeated the words, each one a betrayal as I watched Erik's desperate expression.

""The final binding,"" Maggie said in English. ""Speak their names to banish them.""

""What names?"" I asked.

""The names of those taken. You must renounce them.""

I looked at the figures‚ÄîJenny, Tony, Erik, others stretching down the hallway.

""I renounce you,"" I began. ""Jenny.""

Her form flickered violently.

""Tony Gustafson.""

The black water creature shrieked.

""Erik Olson.""

""No!"" Maggie cried. ""Not my boy!""

Too late. The name hung in the air. Erik's figure dissolved like smoke.

""Mom,"" he whispered. ""I'm sorry.""

Maggie fell to her knees, sobbing. The ritual faltered.

The chalk lines dimmed. Pressure dropped.

""No,"" Sven barked. ""We have to finish it!""

Uncle Lars grabbed the book. ""I'll do it.""

As he began to recite, the figures rushed forward. The black water creature expanded, enveloping Jenny and Tony. They crossed the threshold into the bathroom.

""Stay in the circle!"" Lars shouted.

I stood frozen as the entity surged toward us. It hit the inner circle boundary and recoiled, hissing.

""The final words,"" Lars urged. ""Now!""

I stumbled through the closing phrases, voice breaking. The chalk circle blazed blue-white. Walls shook. Tiles cracked and fell.

""By our will, by our blood, the door is closed!""

A concussive wave erupted, throwing everyone backward. I slammed against the wall, pain exploding in my shoulder. Blackness.

When I came to, the bathroom was in ruins. Mirror shattered. Sink hung at an angle, water spraying. Chalk markings gone.

Sven helped Maggie up. Lars lay near the toilet, a gash bleeding.

""Uncle Lars!"" I scrambled to him.

""I'm alright,"" he groaned, sitting up. ""Did it work?""

We looked around. The oppressive feeling vanished. Air felt normal.

""I think so,"" I said.

""No,"" Maggie whispered, staring at the floor. ""Look.""

In the center, where the circles had been, a small crack appeared in the tile. It widened slightly, a faint glow emanating from within.

""We weakened it,"" Sven said grimly. ""But didn't close it entirely.""

""Why not?"" I demanded. ""We did everything right.""

Maggie looked at Lars, her expression hardening. ""Because someone here doesn't want it closed.""

Lars avoided her gaze.

""What's she talking about?"" I asked him.

Before he could answer, store bells jingled. Someone entered.

""Who could that be?"" Sven whispered.

We crept out, soaked, battered. In the harsh fluorescent light stood Patricia, strangely calm.

""I was afraid of this,"" she said, surveying us. ""You tried to close it.""

""Patricia,"" I started. ""We can explain‚Äî""

""No need."" She walked forward, movements stiff. ""I've been expecting this since you first saw the woman in the red scarf.""

My blood ran cold. ""How did you know? I never told you who I saw.""

She smiled, the expression never reaching her eyes. ""Because she is me, of course.""

Patricia's form flickered, briefly revealing a gaunt figure in a crimson scarf before shifting back.

""You're one of them,"" I whispered.

""I am their voice in this world."" She looked at Lars. ""Just as your uncle was meant to be.""

All eyes turned to Lars, pale, shaking.

""What is she talking about?"" I demanded.

""Tell them, Lars,"" Patricia urged. ""Tell them what your grandfather really found in the Svenson cellar.""

Lars swallowed hard. ""A book. Like Maggie's, but older. And a key.""

""A key to what?"" Sven asked.

""To the door between worlds,"" Patricia answered. ""The Larson family were chosen as keepers. Your grandfather embraced this role, but your father rejected it.""

""And you?"" I asked my uncle.

Lars wouldn't meet my eyes. ""I didn't believe any of it. Not until you started working here.""

""He's been helping us,"" Patricia said, smiling coldly. ""Sending his own nephew to feed our hunger.""

Rage boiled inside me. ""Is that true? You sent me here knowing?""

""No!"" Lars protested. ""I gave you the pendant for protection. I tried to warn you!""

""Half-measures,"" Patricia scoffed. ""You knew the truth but lacked courage."" She turned to me. ""But you, Finn Larson, have proven worthy. You've seen us, survived. Spoken with us, maintained your mind.""

""What do you want?"" I asked, backing away.

""To take your rightful place as keeper of the door."" Patricia extended her hand. ""In exchange for the safe return of those taken.""

Behind her, the front doors opened. Jenny and Tony entered, followed by Erik and others‚Äîpale, moving with strange coordination, but unmistakably alive.

Maggie gasped, reaching toward her son. ""Erik?""

""They can come back,"" Patricia said. ""All of them. If you agree to maintain the balance. Not to close the door, but to guard it. Follow the rules, ensure others do too.""

""Don't listen,"" Sven warned. ""It's a trick.""

But Maggie was already moving toward Erik, face transformed by hope.

""Mom,"" Erik said, voice faint but his own. ""Please.""

Patricia turned to me, eyes gleaming. ""What will it be, Finn? Close the door forever and condemn these souls? Or become the new keeper, and save them all?""

I fingered the pendant, mind racing. The ritual failed, but we'd weakened the door. If I agreed, would I save them or damn myself?

""I need to think,"" I said.

""There's no time,"" Patricia replied. ""The door is unstable. Choose quickly, or lose everything.""

Behind her, Erik reached for his mother's hand. Their fingers touched. Maggie sobbed with relief.

""Finn, please,"" she begged. ""Save my boy.""

The weight of the decision pressed down. Close the door forever, or become its keeper?

In that moment, looking at the faces of those trapped, I made my choice.

""I'll do it,"" I said, words burning. ""I'll be the keeper.""

Patricia's smile widened. ""A wise decision.""

""Finn, no,"" Uncle Lars grabbed my arm. ""You don't understand.""

I jerked away. ""And whose fault is that? You knew.""

""Not everything,"" he insisted. ""Pieces. Stories I never believed.""

""Enough,"" Patricia cut in. ""The bargain is struck."" She extended her hand. ""Come.""

I hesitated, glancing at Maggie, clutching Erik's cold hand. Her face was torn.

""If I do this,"" I said to Patricia, ""everyone comes back? Jenny, Tony, Erik, all of them?""

""They return to this world, yes.""

""Fully? Not as.. whatever they are now?""

Patricia's expression flickered with amusement. ""They will live again. Different, perhaps, but alive.""

""And what does 'keeper' entail?""

""You maintain the balance. Follow the rules. Ensure others do as well."" She gestured around the store. ""This place was built as a crossing point. It requires management.""

""Management,"" I repeated flatly. ""Like a supernatural border patrol.""

""If you prefer that analogy, yes."" Her patience thinned. ""The door wants to open fully. The rules keep it from swinging too wide, too fast.""

I took a deep breath. ""And if I refuse?""

Patricia's face hardened. ""Then the door destabilizes completely. No more rules, no more boundaries."" She glanced at the returned people. ""And these souls remain trapped forever.""

Sven stepped forward. ""You're lying. The ritual was working.""

Patricia ignored him, focusing on me. ""Choose now, Finn Larson. Time is running out.""

The pendant grew hot enough to burn. I wrapped my fingers around it, feeling its power.

An idea struck me‚Äîdesperate, dangerous.

""I accept,"" I said, stepping toward Patricia. ""Show me what to do.""

Relief washed over Maggie. Uncle Lars looked devastated.

Patricia nodded. ""Follow me.""

She led me to the bathroom, others trailing. The room lay in ruins, water pooling. The crack had widened, glowing bluish.

""The first act of the keeper is to reestablish the boundary,"" Patricia explained. She withdrew a small object‚Äîa key, ancient, black metal. ""This belongs to your family line.""

""My grandfather's key,"" Lars whispered.

""The S√°mi pendant,"" I said, understanding. ""It's the same metal.""

Patricia nodded. ""Both forged beyond the door. One opens, one protects.""

She handed me the key. It felt heavy, thrumming.

""Place it in the center of the breach,"" she instructed.

I knelt by the crack, key in one hand, pendant clutched in the other. Everyone watched.

""Now,"" Patricia continued, ""recite the keeper's oath."" She began to speak in the ancient language.

I pretended to follow, mumbling nonsense, watching her. Her attention was fixed on the key, expression hungry.

In that moment, I made my real choice.

In one fluid motion, I yanked the pendant from my neck, wrapped its cord around the key, and slammed both into the crack.

""What are you doing?"" Patricia shrieked.

""Closing the door my way,"" I growled.

Pendant and key connected with a blinding flash of blue-white light. Energy surged. The building groaned.

Patricia lunged, disguise falling away, revealing the gaunt, twisted creature‚Äîwrong angles, too-long limbs. I scrambled back as elongated fingers grabbed for my throat.

""Finn!"" Uncle Lars tackled her, sending both crashing into the broken sink.

The crack widened explosively. A howling wind erupted, pulling at us.

""Everyone out!"" I yelled, grabbing Maggie's arm.

""Not without Erik!"" she cried.

I looked back. Erik and the others stood motionless, forms wavering.

""Mom,"" Erik said, voice clearer. ""It's okay. We need to go back through.""

""No!"" Maggie fought.

Sven grabbed her other arm. ""Maggie, we have to go!""

Patricia had thrown Lars aside, now stood at the chasm's edge, form elongating, stretching toward the light below. ""You fool!"" she howled. ""You've destabilized everything!""

Emergency lights flashed as main power failed. Through the doorway, products flew off shelves, windows shattered.

""Get out now!"" Lars bellowed, blood streaming.

We dragged Maggie from the bathroom as the floor gave way. Erik and the others remained still, forms growing transparent.

""I love you,"" Erik called, voice fading. ""I'm sorry.""

Patricia let out an inhuman wail as her body stretched, twisted, pulled downward. ""You cannot close it forever! We will find another way!""

The roof above the bathroom collapsed with a deafening crash. Dust and debris filled the air. We stumbled toward the front.

""The rules!"" Patricia's voice echoed, distorted, fading. ""Without the rules, the balance fails! You've doomed both worlds!""

We burst through the front doors into the cold night. Behind us, the Kwik Trip shuddered. Walls buckled, windows exploded.

""Get to the truck!"" Lars shouted, pushing us.

We barely reached his pickup when the building imploded with a roar. The ground collapsed, taking the structure down into a gaping sinkhole.

A final pulse of blue light shot upward, piercing the sky before dissipating.

Silence. Broken only by distant sirens.

We stood in shock, staring at the smoking crater.

Maggie fell to her knees, sobbing. Sven knelt beside her, arms around her, tears carving tracks through dust.

Uncle Lars approached, limping. ""What did you do?""

""I combined the pendant and the key,"" I explained, struggling to breathe. ""One opens, one protects. Together, I thought they might.""

""Cancel each other out,"" he finished. ""Or create something new.""

""Did it work?"" I asked. ""Is the door closed?""

Lars looked back at the destruction. ""I think so. It feels.. different now.""

""Different how?""

""Lighter."" He touched his chest. ""Like something pressing down has lifted.""

In the distance, emergency vehicles approached.

""What do we tell them?"" I asked.

""Gas leak,"" Lars replied. ""Believable enough with the evidence gone.""

""And the people? Erik? Tony? Jenny?""

His face fell. ""I don't know, Finn. I truly don't.""

We watched fire trucks, police cars arrive. Officials shouted orders. One spotted us.

""Anyone hurt?"" the officer asked, taking in our appearance.

""We're okay,"" Lars answered. ""Just driving by.""

The officer nodded, skeptical but with bigger concerns. ""Stay here. Statements soon.""

As he rushed back, I noticed something odd about the crater. No broken pipes, no water spraying.

""The sink was broken,"" I whispered to Lars. ""Water everywhere. Where did it go?""

He stared. ""Maybe when the floor collapsed.""

""No,"" I shook my head. ""No debris. No merchandise. Nothing but a hole.""

The realization hit us.

""It didn't collapse,"" Lars murmured. ""It went through.""

""The whole building?""

""Everything inside it.""

Including the people. Erik. Tony. Jenny. Patricia.

An EMT approached. ""Hospital?""

""We're fine,"" Lars assured him. ""Just shaken.""

""Still, protocol‚Äî""

""My sister-in-law is having a panic attack,"" Lars interrupted, gesturing to Maggie. ""Help her first?""

As the EMT hurried to Maggie, Lars pulled me away.

""The pendant and key,"" he said quietly. ""They weren't destroyed. They went through with everything else.""

""Does that matter?""

""I don't know."" His eyes were troubled. ""But if they crossed over.""

""Someone on the other side could use them,"" I realized. ""To open the door again.""

""Possibly.""

""So this isn't over.""

Lars shook his head slowly. ""I don't think so. But whatever happens next won't be here. Not at this spot.""

I looked back at the crater, trying to imagine where everything went. A backwards Kwik Trip? Were Erik and the others still trapped?

""Your grandfather,"" I said. ""In the stories, what happened after he found the key?""

Lars hesitated. ""He.. changed. Began to see things others couldn't. Places others couldn't go.""

""Like what?""

""Doors. Everywhere. Ordinary doors that led to extraordinary places."" Lars looked at me intently. ""Finn, have you noticed anything strange since you used the pendant?""

Now that he mentioned it, I had seen something odd. The empty hole seemed to shimmer, revealing an inverted gas station, lights glowing from underneath.

""Maybe,"" I admitted. ""Not sure.""

A police officer approached for statements. For an hour, we repeated our fabricated story. Authorities accepted the sinkhole theory.

By dawn, we were allowed to leave. Sven and Maggie followed us to Lars's house, too shaken to be alone.

Pulling into the driveway, I noticed something unusual on the porch‚Äîa small cardboard box.

""Stay in the car,"" Lars ordered, approaching cautiously.

He examined it without touching, then called me over. ""It's addressed to you.""

My name was written on top in neat script. No return address.

""Should I open it?"" I asked.

Lars nodded grimly. ""I think you have to.""

Inside, nestled in crumpled newspaper, lay a single item: a red scarf.

Beneath it, a handwritten note: ""Rules can be rewritten. We'll be seeing you, Keeper.""

The red scarf felt wrong‚Äîordinary fabric, extraordinary weight. Uncle Lars insisted we burn it. We watched it curl and blacken, yet I couldn't shake the feeling destroying it accomplished nothing.

In the days that followed, Hallock attempted normalcy. The Kwik Trip incident dominated news, authorities settling on a sinkhole explanation. Plans to rebuild were underway.

I attended Erik Olson's memorial. His body never found. The church was packed. Maggie stood stoic beside Sven. When she saw me, a shared understanding passed between us.

""He's not gone,"" she whispered. ""Just somewhere else now.""

I nodded, hoping she was right.

A week later, I sat with Uncle Lars, discussing my future.

""Offer for construction up in Grand Forks,"" I told him. ""Decent pay.""

""You're leaving then.""

""I need to. Every time I drive past that empty lot.""

""I understand."" He toyed with his bottle. ""But Finn, you should know.. what happened, what you did with the pendant and key‚Äîit marked you.""

""What do you mean?""

""The note called you 'Keeper.' That means something."" His eyes were grave. ""They don't give up easily.""

""The door is closed,"" I insisted. ""The building's gone.""

""Doors can be rebuilt,"" he countered. ""Especially when the key and pendant crossed over.""

I rubbed my temples, a headache building. ""So what do I do? Guard an empty lot?""

Lars shook his head. ""No. But be vigilant. Watch for signs. And if you ever see another list of rules.""

""Run the other way,"" I finished.

""Exactly.""

That night, I dreamed of Erik Olson. We stood in a version of Kwik Trip #483‚Äîfamiliar, wrong. Colors inverted, angles askew. Air hummed.

""You shouldn't be here,"" Erik said, form more solid.

""Where is here?"" I asked, looking around the twisted store.

""The space between. The halfway place."" He gestured to the walls, breathing slightly. ""It exists alongside your world, touching at certain points.""

""Like the gas station.""

He nodded. ""Places built on thresholds. Crossroads. Borders.""

""Are you.. okay?"" I asked awkwardly.

A smile ghosted across his face. ""I'm something. Not alive, not dead. But I exist.""

""And the others? Jenny? Tony?""

""Here too. We all serve the purpose.""

""What purpose?""

Erik's expression darkened. ""You'll find out soon enough. She's not finished with you.""

""Patricia? Red scarf woman?""

""She has many names. Many faces."" He glanced nervously over his shoulder. ""I shouldn't be talking to you. They'll know.""

""Who's 'they'?""

""The Travelers. The ones who walk between."" He began to fade. ""Be careful of doors, Finn. All doors.""

I woke with a jolt, heart racing. Sunlight streamed through the window, but the dream felt more real. I could still smell the inverted Kwik Trip‚Äîozone, wet earth.

Downstairs, Uncle Lars was up. He took one look at my face.

""You saw something.""

I nodded, describing the dream. He listened, expression troubled.

""It's starting,"" he said. ""Just like with my grandfather.""

""What happened to him?""

Lars sighed. ""After he found the key, visions. Sleepwalking. Found him in strange places‚Äîold wells, abandoned houses, once in Lake of the Woods at night, miles from shore.""

""How?""

""Claimed he used doors. Regular doors connecting to other places."" Lars poured coffee, hands shaking. ""Eventually, disappeared. Left a note saying he'd found the 'right door' and was going through.""

""Never saw him again?""

""Not in this world."" He met my eyes. ""But I think you just did, in your dream.""

Ice shot through my veins. ""Your grandfather was one of them?""

""Maybe. Or became something else."" Lars pushed a mug toward me. ""Point is, this isn't over for you.""

I drove to Grand Forks that afternoon. The city felt reassuringly normal.

The apartment was small, clean, on the third floor. As the landlord showed me around, I felt myself relaxing. This could work. A fresh start.

""So what do you think?"" the landlord asked.

""I'll take it,"" I said. ""When can I move in?""

""End of the week? First and last month's rent.""

We shook hands. I wrote a check, feeling oddly optimistic. Maybe Lars was paranoid. Maybe the nightmare was over.

On my drive back, I stopped at a diner. Nearly empty. Trucker, elderly couple. I sat at the far end.

Waiting for coffee, I noticed something strange about the restroom door. It seemed to shimmer, wood grain shifting. I blinked. It disappeared.

Imagination. Had to be.

The waitress returned. As she set down the plate, I saw her name tag: Patricia.

My blood went cold.

""Something wrong, honey?"" she asked, voice nothing like the Patricia I knew.

""No, sorry. Just tired."" I forced a smile.

She nodded. ""Long drive?""

""Not too bad. Heading back to Hallock.""

""Hallock?"" She frowned. ""Gas station collapsed? Terrible business.""

""Yeah, I was there.""

Eyebrows shot up. ""No kidding? Lucky to be alive.""

""Guess so.""

She refilled my coffee. ""Enjoy your pie. Holler if you need anything.""

As she walked away, my heartbeat returned to normal. Coincidence. Patricia was common.

I ate quickly, eager to leave. Finished, left cash, headed for the exit. Passing the restroom, the door shimmered again‚Äîmore noticeably. Wood grain swirled like water, forming patterns.

Despite every instinct screaming, I was drawn toward it. My hand reached for the knob.

The door swung open to reveal not a bathroom, but a long, dimly lit hallway that couldn't possibly fit. Walls lined with doors‚Äîdozens, stretching into darkness.

I stumbled backward, slamming the door shut. No one noticed. Trucker ate. Couple chatted.

I hurried outside, hands shaking. Dropped my keys twice. Slid behind the wheel. Movement in my rearview mirror.

The waitress‚ÄîPatricia‚Äîstood in the doorway, watching. As our eyes met in the mirror, her face rippled, briefly revealing another face beneath‚Äîgaunt, too-wide eyes, familiar hungry expression.

I peeled out of the parking lot, heart hammering. It wasn't over. Never would be.

Back in Hallock, I packed frantically. Uncle Lars watched from the doorway, grim.

""You saw something.""

""Doors,"" I confirmed, stuffing clothes into my duffel bag. ""And her. Patricia. Whatever she is.""

He nodded, unsurprised. ""Where will you go?""

""I don't know. Somewhere far. Canada, maybe.""

""It won't matter,"" he said quietly. ""Distance means nothing. They'll find you through the doors.""

I paused, a shirt half-folded. ""Then what?""

""Learn to control it."" He sat on the bed. ""My grandfather wrote journals before he disappeared. Notes about the doors, how to find them, how to choose where they lead.""

""You have these journals?""

""Some. Others lost."" He met my eyes. ""But I think you might be able to find them.""

""How?""

""Through the doors. If you can learn to navigate them, control which ones you open."" He trailed off. ""You could find answers. Maybe even find a way to truly close the breach.""

""Or I could disappear like your grandfather.""

""That's the risk."" He didn't sugarcoat it. ""But running won't save you. They've marked you as Keeper. They'll keep finding you, testing you.""

I sank down beside him, exhausted. ""I never asked for this.""

""None of us did."" He patted my shoulder. ""But here we are.""

That night, I dreamed of doors‚Äîhundreds, thousands, stretching through infinite gray fog. Some ornate, carved. Others simple, wooden, familiar. One by one, they opened as I passed, revealing glimpses of other places, other times.

Erik stood beside me in the fog, more substantial.

""You're beginning to see,"" he said. ""The spaces between.""

""I don't want to see.""

""Too late."" He gestured at the endless doors. ""You crossed the threshold when you combined the key and pendant. Now you're part of the system.""

""What system?""

""The balance."" His expression sympathetic. ""Every door must have a keeper. Someone to decide who passes through and when.""

""And that's me now?""

""By your own choice, yes.""

I shook my head. ""I was trying to close the door permanently.""

""No door stays closed forever,"" Erik said. ""Rules can be broken, changed, rewritten. But not eliminated.""

""So what happens now?""

Erik pointed to a simple wooden door standing alone. Looked like my uncle's spare bedroom door.

""Now you choose. Stay in your world and wait for them. Or step through and learn to control the doors yourself.""

""What's on the other side?""

""I don't know."" He began to fade. ""That's the nature of doors, Finn. You never know until you open them.""

I woke at dawn, dream vivid. Bedroom door stood slightly ajar. I was certain I'd closed it.

As I watched, it swung open wider, revealing not the hallway, but a long, fog-shrouded corridor lined with doors.

I sat frozen, heart pounding. Not a dream. The door to my room had become a gateway.

Footsteps echoed‚Äîslow, measured, approaching. A figure emerged from the fog, tall, thin, wearing a red scarf trailing behind.

""Hello, Keeper,"" Patricia said, voice reverberating strangely. ""Ready for your first lesson?""

The bell above the door chimes as I lock up Kwik Trip #483. Six months on the job. No one questions why I'm the only graveyard shift employee. Some raise eyebrows at the covered mirrors. Others wonder about the chalk symbols on the threshold.

Small town folks are practical. Coffee's hot, gas pumps work‚Äîthey don't dig deep.

I finish my closing checklist‚Äîfar more complex than the corporate version. Checking the storage room lock for scratch marks, listening for whispers in the dairy cooler, measuring shadow angles in aisle three.

Just as I complete the final task, my phone buzzes. Text from Maggie Olson: ""Anything tonight?""

""Nothing unusual,"" I reply. ""How's Erik?""

She sends a photo‚ÄîErik sitting at their kitchen table, pale but smiling. Getting him back wasn't easy. Required sacrifices, bargains with entities in the spaces between. But he's home now, even if he stares at ordinary doors for hours, or speaks in languages that never existed here.

The store feels different after hours‚Äîalive in ways that defy explanation. Coolers hum in harmonies too perfect. Shadows move against light. The bathroom door occasionally knocks from the inside, gentle but persistent.

I hang up my name badge and retrieve a different one. This one simply reads ""Keeper"" in flowing script that changes color.

""Ready?"" Patricia asks, materializing beside the coffee counter. Her red scarf is the only vibrant thing about her‚Äîthe rest slightly transparent.

I nod, pulling a ring of peculiar keys from my pocket. ""Which ones tonight?""

""Four breaches. Fargo, Bemidji. Two more up north, near the Canadian border."" She consults a ledger that wasn't there a moment ago. ""Northern ones are troublesome. Something large trying to squeeze through.""

I select a key of dark metal, too cold against my skin. ""Let's start there.""

We approach the bathroom door‚Äîthe primary portal. Rules are strict: specific times, specific words. I've learned the hard way what happens when they're broken.

The lock clicks open to reveal not the bathroom, but a swirling corridor of mist and floating doorways. My domain now‚Äîthe space between worlds I'm tasked with maintaining.

Uncle Lars visits sometimes, bringing journals from his grandfather‚Äîprevious Keeper before he ventured too deep. Knowledge helps, but some lessons are only learned through experience.

Like navigating the floating doors. Sensing which lead to safety, which open onto hungry voids. Speaking with entities without losing pieces of yourself.

A chill breeze flows from the corridor, carrying whispers. Patricia steps through first, form becoming more substantial. I follow, weight of responsibility settling.

The door swings shut behind us, sealing off the gas station. To customers tomorrow, nothing will seem amiss. Night manager restocked, cleaned, updated prices‚Äînormal tasks.

They'll never know I spent the darkest hours walking between realities, sealing breaches, negotiating with things that never knew sunlight. Won't see the residue clinging to my fingertips, or notice how I step over thresholds in a specific pattern.

And they certainly won't understand why I enforce the store's peculiar policies with rigid insistence. Why certain items can't be sold after midnight. Why the bathroom is always ""out of order"" during specific hours.

These rules aren't arbitrary‚Äîthey're the foundation of safety. Balance between worlds rests on these small, strange rituals.

It's not the life I would have chosen. But moving through the misty corridor toward the troublesome northern doorways, I realize it's the life I was always heading toward‚Äîstanding at the threshold, keeping watch, making sure what belongs on the other side stays there.

So I went to a bussiness trip abroad where I met this girl that approched us (me and my co-workers), and she and I kinda clicked. The next day us two were hanging out on most coffee breaks. 

After the meetings that day we went exploring the city. On that day she mentioned, in the context of a topic, that she is in a relationship, so I knew where the bounderies were (I take that very seriously), so I was very careful to not give the wrong impression. 

So at the end of that day, she asked me how do we (my country) say goodbye, with kisses? (they do in hers). And I said I usually hug, so we hugged and then we went our seperate ways.

The next day she didn't approach me and was barely talking to me. Now that I am back home, I messaged her the link to the photo album with pictures I took on our walk. She thanked me for the photos, said they were beautiful. I also asked her if she wanted to stay in touch and chat once in a while, but she never replied to that, not even opened the message. 

So what happened? What should I do? Leave her be?

His Little Wolf

Bethany

""Bethany, Beth wake up baby!""

""Momma, what's wrong?""

""Rogues, we're under attack. I need you to take Bella to the safe room and don't come out until I come and get you, ok? Promise me you won't come out until it's safe Beth!""

""Ok momma, I won't I promise!""

""Good girl, now run and don't stop, protect Bella. I love you, Bethany.""

""I love you too momma.""

I take a sleeping Bella from my mom's arms and run out of my bedroom, down the hallway, down the stairs, through the living room, and finally reach the kitchen. I pop open the door as the growls and pain-filled howls start to get louder and I'm just grateful that Bella is sleeping through all of this.

Finally, we reach the safe room. I lock the door once we're inside and lay Bella on the mattress on the floor. This room has everything we need, there are two mattresses on the floor with blankets and pillows, torches within reach just in case the power goes out or we need to keep the main light off, and a cupboard with drinks and food that doesn't need to be cooked.

There's a small toilet room adjacent to this room, it literally only has a toilet and sink in there but that's all we need. There are two windows high up on the wall, the glass is fogged so no one can see in or out but the light shines through so you can tell if it's day or night.

I've been stuck in this room during attacks before and I can tell you that being able to tell if it's day or night helps a lot especially when you don't have a clue what time it is. The room is soundproofed and the door is made of steel making it harder to break through, not that anyone has tried before thank goddess.

I lay down on the mattress and cuddle into Bella. I'm sure we'll be fine, we're not a big pack, there are only 250 members but we have some very strong warriors and have done well when under attacks before. I can't fight because I don't have my wolf yet, I'll get my wolf when I'm 18 but right now I'm only 14.

Bella is 6 months old, she's my niece, my brother Josh's daughter. He and his mate Harley are warriors so after she was born it was agreed that if there was ever an attack, I would take her to the safe room while they fight. My dad Tom is the top warrior here at moonshine and while my mother Helen isn't a warrior, she is one hell of a fighter. She used to be a warrior but quit, choosing to work in the nursery instead. Josh is the 2nd top male warrior and Harley is the 10th top female warrior.

My older sister Brooke was the 2nd top female warrior here which is a great achievement at 18 years old but she met her mate 3 weeks ago at the annual blue moon ball and moved to his pack 6 hours away to be with him. Calvin is the Alpha of the claw moon pack, he's 20 and seems like a really good Alpha and mate to my sister.

I've not met him yet or anyone from the pack as I can't attend the ball until I'm 18 but we are going there in 1 week for the Luna ceremony and I can't wait. I'm super proud of my sister becoming Luna, she's such a lovely person and I know she'll be a great Luna.

The women, children, and elderly usually go to the safe room at the packhouse but my dad insisted we have one in our basement, so he and Josh build one 5 years ago. It's great because we don't need to go outside when there's a sudden attack but it's not great when I'm here on my own.

Of course, I have Bella but she's just a baby. It can get lonely and scary down here on my own but I always remind myself that my family are out there fighting to keep us safe. The least I can do is suck it up in here for a few hours.

My mind has been working overtime so much that I've given myself a migraine and I know Bella will be up in a couple of hours. I decide to try and get some sleep, I'm never normally able to fall asleep in here I get creeped out.

Between that and worrying about my family and pack sleep is always impossible but this headache isn't shifting so I've got to try so I snuggle into Bella some more and finally, sleep takes over.

I'm slowly waking up and suddenly remembering where I am. I jump up with a start and see we are still in the safe room. When I went to sleep, I was hoping that we would wake up in our beds and that this would all be over but clearly not. Bella starts to stir so I go make her bottle and by the time I'm done she's wide awake and whiny.

I change her diaper and start feeding her. I'm good at looking after Bella I can do everything she needs or wants, which is a good thing considering I'm all she has right now. Plus Harley says I'm a natural which I love because I can't wait to have my own kids one day when I get my mate. I can find my mate once I turn 18, but I just hope I don't have to wait too long.

As soon as Bella's fed and burped I take her into the toilet room, wash her down with a washcloth, and get her dressed. I then get myself sorted while she lays on the floor and plays. she's such a happy baby and I love her so much.

When Harley and Josh asked me to protect Bella, they knew I didn't need an adult here with us, they know I'd die to protect her. I may only be 14 but my family are warriors and Josh works me hard in training so much that when we have practice fights, I have to fight the older kids because no one my age can keep up with me.

I don't know what time it is but I know it's been hours and I've started getting a sinking feeling in my stomach, I've never been in this room this long before. I don't want to think it but I know deep down in my heart I know this attack hasn't gone our way. I know my family and pack are dead because If anyone had survived, they would have come for us.

I let myself have a few minutes to panic about how it's just me and Bella now, how I'm 14 and have to look after a baby. How do I do this? How do I live without my family? I want to break down, I want to smash this room up but I can't, I have to be strong now for Bella.

There's still a small part of me that wants to believe they are ok, what if they are alive? What if they're laying outside now injured and need me? I have to know; I have to see for myself if there are any survivors. I grab the backpack in the corner which has supplies for me and Bella for a few days.

It's kept here just Incase the worst happens and I need to run with her and as much as I don't want to admit it, I think it has. I throw it over my shoulder, pick up Bella and put her in the baby carrier I've put on, and pray to the moon goddess that if the worst has happened, I can get us out of here.

Here we go!

I slowly open the door, peaking out I can't see or hear anyone. I slowly make my way up the stairs into the kitchen and the sight before me doesn't give me any hope, the place has been trashed. I make my way through the house and every room is the same.

I think maybe the Rogues were looking for anyone hidden. It would be hard for them to find the safe room at my house because the outside door is covered in the same wallpaper as the kitchen, so it doesn't look like a door.

I head to my bedroom and pray they didn't find my emergency box, Josh and I both have them. They contain a bank card to my parent's savings account, a few hundred dollars in cash, a new phone, and a photo album just in case there's no return. Thankfully it's still there, I put everything in my bag and make my way to the front door.

I get out of the front door and I feel like I've walked onto the set of a horror film. Everything is trashed, there are dead bodies littered everywhere, blood and even body parts sprawled out on the ground.

I feel sick! I'm so glad Bella is sleeping, baby or not she should never see something like this. I take deep breaths to try and calm myself and slowly make my way forwards, as much as I want to run away from this right now, I have to be sure, I have to know if my family is dead.

Making my way around the bodies I want to break down, all these people are just gone, the people I knew, the people I was talking with Just yesterday. Why did this happen? After a few more steps I find Josh and Harley next to each other... they're both dead... their throats have been torn out. My heart breaks for Bella, of course, it breaks for me too but they were her parents and she'll never remember them. I kiss them both on the head and keep walking.

I'm almost to the packhouse when I see my beautiful mom, her hearts torn out and as much as I try, I can't stop my tears from falling. I tell her I love her, kiss her on the head and go look for my dad the only one left I can hope is still alive.

I finally find him with the Beta and Alpha... he's dead his throat has been torn apart and his legs have been bitten off. It's all too much, I can't breathe, I crumble to the floor and quietly sob my heart out while cuddling a sleeping, Bella. It takes me some time to finally calm myself, I look around to see if anyone's coming but no one is, then I remember something...

The safe room in the packhouse. The women, children, and elderly will still be there. I take a few more minutes to say goodbye to my family then I take both my parent's wedding rings and place them on my neckless.

My mom made me, Josh, and Brooke promise a long time ago that if something happened to both of them and any of us was able to, we were to take their rings and keep them with us and I will keep that promise.

Harley and Josh weren't married yet but were engaged so I take Harley's engagement ring and also place it on my neckless, I will keep it safe until Bella is old enough to have it. I can't bear to see my family in pieces anymore so I say my final goodbyes and start walking away. That's not how I want to remember them and they wouldn't want that either.

I make my way to the packhouse on high alert. I still don't know if any Rogues are hanging around. I make it inside the house and it's all clear so far thank moon goddess. This place has been trashed too, everything in ruins and more bodies on the ground.

Arriving in the kitchen I head straight for the pantry, the door to the safe room is inside there. My legs can't move quick enough, I don't want to be alone anymore. The people in there may not be my family by blood but they are still family. I open the door and make my way down the stairs and I can't believe what my eyes are seeing...

# Chapter 2

Bethany

The women, children, and elderly are still in here... but they're dead. HOW? How did anyone get in here? How could anyone kill these defenseless people? those poor babies! What have they been through? What did they see before they were murdered?

I can't hold back my tears; I start looking around praying there's someone still alive but the longer I'm here the less hope I have. I call out quietly begging someone to answer me and someone does, I can't believe it. I move quickly to where the sound is coming from to find Mrs Thompson my best friend Carly's mom.

""Mrs Thompson, are you ok?""

""Beth dear hi, no sweetheart I'm bleeding pretty bad!""

""Oh Mrs Thompson we need to get you help now; do you know where Carly is?""

""No, it's too late for me Beth, as soon as I stand, I'll bleed out, I don't have much longer left. Beth sweetheart Carly... she's... gone... She's dead!""

I knew in my heart that she was gone but hearing it out loud still feels like a knife tearing my heart apart, we've been best friends since we were 3 years old.

""Beth is there anyone else out there?""

""No... I've not found anyone alive yet. I don't understand how the Rogues got in here, it's never happened before."" My voice is barely above a whisper as I try not to break down again.

""Beth... I need you to listen to me, I don't have long and you need to hear this."" I nod my head ""Beth this was an inside job. One of our own was working with the Rogues. He showed a group of them this place, he let them in."" I'm floored, I sit back on my bum in complete shock.

""I don't understand, who would do that? Why?"" Mrs Thompson suddenly breaks down sobbing her heart out and I move in to cuddle her while she continues.

""Beth it was... Marcus who brought the Rogues in here he was a part of it, he doesn't want to have an Alpha anymore he wants to be one so he made a deal with a group of Rogues, they help him wipe out the pack, he'll be the new Alpha and he'll take them in.""

""Marcus... as in your SON Marcus?""

""Sadly yes, Beth he killed Carly himself. I don't know who he is but he's not the son I raised!""

I'm so stunned I can't move, can barely form any words. He killed his own sister, he destroyed our pack, FUCK!

""Bethany... I need you to listen to me, he said for his plan to work everyone must die. He must be the only survivor to claim the lands. Beth, take Bella and run now sweetheart, and don't look back!""

""I won't leave you alone Joan, I can't!""

""Sweetheart there's nothing that can be done for me. You know I've always loved you like my own, I couldn't save Carly please let me save you and that sweet baby girl!"" She's begging me and my heart is torn.

""But... I can't, how do I live without everyone?""

""Beth you are so much stronger than you know. You need to get off the pack lands before they come back, get into town amongst the humans. Have you got a phone on you?""

""Yes, I do bu-""

""Beth get you and Bella into town and call Brooke, she'll help you both, please promise me you'll get away from here before they come back?""

Brooke, how hadn't I thought of that? I've been so consumed by anger and grief that I didn't think about my sister, she's still alive and she'll help us.

""Ok, Joan I promise I will but I can't leave you to die alone!""

""You can and you will sweetie. Don't worry about me I'm ok with dying, my family is waiting for me, please go now Beth let this be my dying wish!""

This woman has just blackmailed me with a dying wish how the hell am I supposed to say no to that? I want to stay with her but I also know she's right, the Rogues have taken down an entire pack so they'll have no trouble dealing with a teenage girl with a baby.

""Ok Beth it's time for you to leave now, promise me you'll phone Brooke, promise me you'll live life to the very most and you'll find happiness!""

I don't know if I'll be able to do all she wants but I'm not going to tell her that, she doesn't need to hear different when she's minutes from dying so instead I promise her that I'll do it all, I kiss her on the forehead and my heart breaks as I run from her and out of the packhouse.

I make my way off of the pack lands finally accepting that there are no other survivors and head for town. I stick to the roads as I need to avoid the woods, they could be anywhere in there. I can't run at my normal speed because of Bella but I jog as fast as I can, making sure to stay in the shadows as much as possible.

20 minutes later and I'm Finally in town not that I feel any safer. Bella woke up about 5 minutes ago and is whiny so I walk to the local baby shop they have a baby room, it's public and safe. Once she's all fed, burped, and changed I make my way outside to a quiet corner, and with a lump in my throat, I call Brooke.

*Ring ring*¬†ring ring\* ring ring\* ring...

No answer ugh! she always answers her phone. I try her again and again but still no answer, Shit! I shoot her a text to phone me ASAP and head for the local Diner I know; I'll hide out there until she calls. I head into Danny's Diner and take a seat in a booth at the back out of the way and order a BLT and coffee. I'm really not hungry but I have to keep my strength up for Bella who's fallen back to sleep again snuggled into my chest.

4 hours later and still no call from Brooke and I've lost count of the number of times I've called her. Why is she not answering? It's 8 pm and I know I need to find somewhere to spend the night, somewhere for Bella to safely sleep. I ask the waitress for a local hotel and she sends me in the right direction.

It's only a 5-minute walk and thankfully they have a room for me. I request a travel cot to be sent to the room and make my way up to the 7th floor in the elevator. I arrive at the door at the same time as a guy arrives with the travel cot, he sets it up for me and I thank him before he leaves.

It's a small room, there's a double bed on one wall with the cot on one side and a bedside table on the other side. A unit on the wall at the bottom of the bed with a tv, kettle, and water bottles on it, a built-in wardrobe is on the left-hand side and the bathroom is on the right. Sink toilet and shower nothing special but all we need.

I place Bella in the travel cot, going in my backpack I take out her blanket and bunny teddy and place them in with her. I've not showered since before bed last night so that's next on my list and thankfully this hotel provides travel-size bathroom accessories or I'd be screwed.

I lock the door and go turn on the shower leaving the bathroom door open so I can hear Bella. I strip off and step under the hot running water, it may be doing a great job of soothing my muscles but my mind is anywhere but here. I can't stop reliving everything that's happened in the last 24 hours.

The tears I've been holding back since leaving the pack lands come to the surface only this time, I don't stop them in fact I welcome them. I slide down the shower wall, pull my knees up to my chest and I break down. I cry for losing my family and my pack. I cry for Bella losing her parents. I cry for Mrs Thompson and having to leave her to die alone and I cry out the anger and frustration that just makes me want to tear apart everything in my view.

It feels like I'll never stop crying but then my mind wonders to Bella and the fact that right now I'm all she has. I have to be strong for her. I made a promise to Josh and Harley that I'd look after her, and protect her and that's exactly what I'll do.

I Wash up, brush my teeth and get into my pj's before crawling into bed. I try calling Brooke again but no answer ugh! The day slowly catches up with me and I fall into a nightmare-filled sleep...

*Ring ring*¬†*ring ring*¬†ring ring\*

I'm dragged out of another nightmare by my phone ringing, I dive out of bed, it's Brooke Oh, thank moon goddess.

""Brooke, where have you been? I've called you about 30 times, why didn't you answer?"" I'm speaking so fast I'm struggling to breathe in between.

""Whoa whoa, calm down sweetheart, I'm sorry I didn't answer we had a BBQ last night and I left my phone in my bedroom, what's wrong? Are you ok?""

""No Brooke I'm not, nothing's going to be ok again, I can't do this!"" I'm back to holding the tears in.

""I need you to take a deep breath, ok sweetheart? And tell me what's wrong?""

""Tuesday night Rogues attacked the pack lands... the... they killed everyone, Brooke... Mom, Dad, Josh, Harley, Carly... everyone's gone!"" My sobs are back and I feel so broken.

""Oh, goddess no!"" I can hear the sheer terror in Brooke's voice as she realizes what's happened.

""How did you... what about Isabella?""

""Bella's fine I've got her but it's just us two now.""

The phone goes quiet before I hear shuffling from the other end of the phone.

""Bethany, this is Alpha Calvin, are you safe? Where are you?""

""I'm safe, I have my niece Bella with me. We're at a hotel in the human town called the tree line in room 319.""

""Ok Beth, don't worry you won't be on your own much longer I am sending my Gamma and a few warriors to come and get you both straight away, they will bring you here to Brooke, to us, ok?""

""Thank you so much, Alpha... but how will I know they are your warriors?""

""Smart girl. Gamma Jack will be there with my warriors John, Callum, Jake, Scott, and David. I will give them the password of Brooke how's that work for you?""

""That sounds ok."" I quickly write down the names he gave me.

""Good now it will take them roughly 6 hours to get there, they will be driving straight through to get you both so they should be with you around twelve, ok? In the meantime, I'd prefer it if you didn't leave the room so anything you need order through room service and Gamma Jack will settle the bill when he arrives, please don't worry about the cost!""

""Thank you, Alpha Calvin thank you so much, I don't want to be alone anymore!"" My voice breaks as the tears keep falling.

""There's no need to thank me, Beth we are family and you won't be alone for much longer, ok? I know you've lost your home and nothing can replace that but there's a place here with me and Brooke waiting for you both ok?""

""Ok thank you Alpha that means more than you'll ever know, how's Brooke doing?"" Bella starts waking up as I'm waiting for his reply.

""She's not doing great but I imagine you are the same?""

""I am, Bella's waking up so I need to make her bottle, please look after Brooke Alpha Calvin.""

He assures me he will and that he'll call back soon to check on me. I pop my phone on charge and make a start on Bella‚Äôs morning routine... six more hours on our own... we can do this.

*Knock knock knock knock*

My heart picks up pace at the sound of someone knocking on the door.

""Bethany, it's Gamma Jack, we're here to take you and little Isabella home.""

""Gamma Jack... who else is with you?"" I have to be sure.

""Bethany, I have 5 warriors with me John, Callum, Jake, Scott, and David."" As he says the names, they all say hi to me one by one.

""Ok, and what's the password?"" Better to be safe than sorry.

""It's Brooke.""

I decide I'm happy to believe it's them and I slowly open the door to a huge guy standing there he's at least 6ft3 short jet black hair, bright blue eyes, and very muscular, the power coming off him tells me he's of a high rank. The other 5 guys are also incredibly tall and muscular and I know Bella and I will be safe with them.

He gives me a kind smile as I open the door more so they can come inside. Bella is babbling away in her travel cot while sucking on one of her teddy bunny ears and I swear I see every single one of the guys soften looking at her.

We make quick work of gathering mine and Bella's stuff and leave the room. Gamma Jack offers to carry Bella but I want her with me. I'm not saying he's a bad guy but I don't know him well enough yet and until I get to Brooke, she's all I have.

I go to pay the bill for our room and room service but Gamma Jack stops me and insists he pays and I'm too lost in myself to argue it.

We make our way to the SUV they brought, strap Bella in the car seat and all pile in ready to leave this place behind, to leave my family behind.",1,1747560639.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I don't know If this is the best place to talk about this, but i'm really hurting and need to talk about tnis
About 2 months ago, my dog passed away, her name was Tikinha, she was old, about 17 years and a half, and for some time she wasn't eating very well, and we took her to the vet, she already had some heart problems and we found that she may have epilepsy.
A few days later, i woke up and opened the door to the yard, as we do every morning, so she can have her morning pee, and i went to the kitchen to make my coffee. A few minutes later my mother called me Very desperated, i went there running, and my dog was convulsing in the floor, both me and my mom got Very shocked, because It was the first time that happened, I picked her up and put her in a confortable pillow in the bed, when she calmed down, I took her to the vet, he gave her some medicine, explained how to deal with convulsiona and reccomended some exames, as she was feeling better, we took her home, in the night of that day I noticed she was Very slow and not very responsive, but i tought It was the medicine effect, and went to sleep, in the next day my dad woke me up saying she was convulsing again, and we took her to the vet, she spent ALL the day there, and she couldn't recover, she had multiple convulsiona and couldn't recover, she was suffering a lot and probably had brain damage, so, we decided to allow the vet to use euthanasia 
Before she died, I went to the room she was and hugged and kissed ver a lot, I got destroyed

After 2 months, of dealing with the grife, my other dog, named Pandora started to have weird symptons, she wasn't eating, and had a weird breathing, we took her to the vet, and we found she had a problem in her lungs, Pandora also was a old girl, 17 years old, and had heart problems, so, the vet reccomended some medicines, and we took her home, After a few days, she didn't got better, so, we went back there, and she got hospitalized, we diacovered she was suffering from pneumonia, she spent a week in the vet clinic, and wasn't getting better, her tongue was blue and she wasn't breathing well, the vet Said there wasn't much more they could do and i got terrified, I still was dealing with the fact that we had to use euthanasia on Tikinha, I didn't want to deal with It again, I know that It was the better option, but i felt guilty.
But It wasn't necessary, about 2 hours later he called saying Pandora had a heart failure and passed away, I cried for hours, but after that, I had an okay week and dealt okay with ALL (that happened a week Ago)

But today, I started crying a lot again, Pandora and Tikinha spent more than half of my life (i'mm 30) with me, and when i was recovering from Tikinha's grief I got hit with my other little girl dying
I'm Very good at dealing with my feelings, and i go to therapy, but still, its Very hard to know that i'll never see any of my 2 babies again, I don't know how to deal with It, i feel guilty, idk exactly how to explain, but i feel bad to feel happy
I'm having one of the best times with my life, my personal projecta are finally working, I have great friends, a great family and have two trips that i'mm really looking forward in the next months, but, at the same time, I feel bad, i miss my dogs and while half of me feels like my 2 babies would love to see me happy, other half of me can't be happy, i'm having difficulty t√¥ deal with the fact that i'll never see them again

1kpfzur,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1kpfzur/may_16_2025_mayors_desk_summary_more_about/,"May 16, 2025 Mayor's Desk summary. More about Martial Arts","Hello, everyone. Following the release of Interface 4 last week, this week's [**Mayor's Desk video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO1YeqR7A4w) with Rob Barefoot and James Hutt, the mayor of Balance Town, also has a lot of martial arts questions. 

5:13 to 17:55

* This is a question from [last week (1 hour 15 mins)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1kjz7px/may_9_2025_mayors_desk_summary_interface_4_and/) where James said the answer was in an errata, but we weren't sure where to find that. James clarifies the -2 penalty from being in a grapple applies to all *Checks.* Wrestling's chokehold and reversal resolutions are always going to be rolled at -2 whenever you attempt them, since the conditions are you are grappling someone or being grappled. Same for Silat's Violent Leverage. 

* James wants to clarify that Silat's requirement of a target you haven't grappled before resets every combat, so if you meet the same combatant again in a separate fight, you can try Violent Leverage again. 

* Does My Friend the Ocelot from [Cutiemas](https://rtalsoriangames.com/2025/03/31/cyberpunk-red-alert-april-2025-dlc-12-days-of-cutiemas/) take 2 actions to reload since you have to pet it to open the ammunition chamber? Yes, taking 2 actions to reload was a way of limiting such a powerful weapon. Rob says the one who pets it and the one who loads the slugs doesn't have to be the same person, so you could give your Friend the Ocelot to someone else and use your action to pet it and then they could load it, either for your use or their use. 

* What do you think is a negative part of living in Night City that doesn't get much attention? The smell? James says the sound. Night City is very loud, 24/7. Rob says the light pollution. 

* Does Arnis's Coordinated Combination fulfill the requirements of Capoeira's Slash Dance? Yes. These two resolutions having the same highly specific weapon requirements is intentional. It sounds powerful, but it requires succeeding a lot of rolls in order to work so it isn't something you will accomplish all the time.

18:35 to 24:45

* This question was also covered in [an earlier Mayor's Desk.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1k5g3nt/april_18th_2025_mayors_desk_summary/) Quickhacking requires line of sight. How does this work with cover? Losing line of sight does not jack out the netrunner, but the netrunner will not be able to quickhack. They stay in the target's neuroport and can do non-quickhack net actions if they so desire, such as breaching passwalls or writing a virus. Leaving the range limit determined by the netrunner's cyberdeck/hardware would unsafely jack out the netrunner. The target using an action for the Concentration check would unsafely jack out the netrunner. But it's too easy to break line of sight to have it unsafely jack out the netrunner. (Note: some kinds of cover are transparent, such as bulletproof glass and bulletproof shields. I'd assume you could quickhack through those.)

* When determining the cost of a tech invention, how do you invent cheaper items? Such as if you wanted to invent coffee, would you be required to invent a 500eb coffee machine and *then* use it to make cheap coffee? Or could you invent cheap instant coffee for less than 500eb? The 500eb minimum is there for a reason. To invent a cheap drink, you're inventing the process to make it, or the machine that makes it. If you just want to make one cup of coffee, you'd still be inventing the recipe. Just because it's cheap to make doesn't mean the process is cheap/easy. You would still have to go through the 500eb Invention process in order to fabricate your brand new 20eb beverage.

24:53 to 33:48

* Does Wrestling's Reversal satisfy Silat's Violent Leverage? For example, enemy grapples you on their turn, then on your turn you roll Reversal so you are grappling them, then you roll Violent Leverage to attack with a weapon, all without using your action? Wrestling's Reversal will be updated to clarify it counts as starting a new grapple. Silat's Violent Leverage will be updated to clarify it needs to look for grapples only you start. (I think this is a yes? Being grappled by a target doesn't invalidate you being able to use Violent Leverage on them if you break free and then grapple them.)

* Rob talks a bit about how starting with a digital release is very helpful for finding these weaknesses in the wording so they can fix it before the book goes to print. 

* The facedown rule says the loser must back down or take -2 to future actions against the opponent until they beat the opponent. Does this -2 include evading attacks from the winner? If the loser does back down but the winner attacks anyway, does the -2 still apply? Yes, the -2 from losing a facedown does apply to evasion. Facedowns are VERY good and meant to be a strong incentive for having good social skills.

* How did Morgan Blackhand survive? [Mike Pondsmith said something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9c6Epqpn2A) about surfing down the collapsing Arasaka Tower using Adam Smasher's body. Rob and James insist they can't talk about this. They can't talk about future releases. 

* If a fixer PC sets up or participates in a Night Market, how do you determine how much money they make? ""Roleplay!"" - James Hutt. There are no shopkeeping rules here, but you can have the player roll skills such as Haggle, or roleplay to make deals. Rob says Night Markets are not just for one person's benefit, but for the benefit of everyone for making money and connections, so you also earn things that aren't money. If you want something specific, like ""all vendors who show up, give me 5% of your earnings,"" you would use the Haggle ability. James says this 5% cut is unlikely to be a deal anyone would take. He reiterates that Night Markets are only once per month, so you shouldn't have them be in the background or in downtime unless you've already done it before and the players don't need to play it all out. (Note: I have played a fixer where I was expected to roleplay out every single haggle. I could not do that. I didn't find it fun. I much prefer dice rolls to handwave certain interactions, with roleplay reserved only for important NPCs I want to make connections with. Or roleplay for when I critically fail because it would be funny to show how I catastrophically offend whoever I'm trying to buy from!)

39:27 to 45:50

* Different causes of unconsciousness aren't worded quite the same way. [Sedative](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/RTG-CPR-DLC-HornetsPhramacyv1.11.pdf) and sleep ammo last 1 minute, and the target wakes upon taking damage or being roused (someone takes an action to wake them). The [gang jazzler](https://rtalsoriangames.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/RTG-CPR-DLC-12DaysofCybermas.pdf) and choking do not have that line. The unconscious condition itself in the core book lasts for 1 minute, so unconsciousness from choking and the gang jazzler last for 1 minute. (Note: it's not clear to me if taking damage or someone else using an action to wake you works for a person choked or gang jazzle'd unconscious)

* Can FBCs be stabilized using Cybertech? No. It is intentional that FBCs can be repaired with cybertech, but can't be stabilized with cybertech. 

* Are there self-driving cars in 2045, such as how 2077 has Delamain? There are cars that can be summoned automatically via netarch, but it's too early in the timeline for self-driving cars as a service to be a good business model. 

* You can ask Mayor's Desk questions on Youtube in the Youtube Community Posts as well as on Discord, but Rob deletes the Youtube Community Posts afterwards because the Youtube algorithm will show older questions to people so they end up asking new questions in the older posts, making it hard to find which questions have and haven't been answered yet.

46:22 to 53 minutes

* Why doesn't Interface 4 add any shared special moves, such as the core book's DV13 Recovery? Shared special moves are very difficult to design and there aren't a lot of things relevant to all martial art styles. Vague hint that maybe there might be another shared special move in the future. But they can't talk about future content!

* Should Cut the Bullet work with thrown melee weapons? James Hutt writes a note for himself to update Cut the Bullet's description. You have to use a handheld melee weapon, not a thrown weapon, to cut a projectile, but he will clarify that it works for thrown knives and ninja stars and stuff as well. Cut the Bullet was really designed for grenades, but logically it should work with other airborne objects. Rob believes Cut the Bullet should require a sharp cutting edge, but James feels this would be unnecessary extra text. 

* Any martial arts they thought of adding that didn't make the cut? No, but James acknowledges his blind spots: he wanted to have martial arts from all over the world, but is pretty sure there's some martial arts styles from the Middle East and India that he missed. There are way more martial arts styles than would fit in a book, so there's plenty of room to add your own, though they didn't have any they thought of adding but ended up cutting.

## Key Features Analysis

The best power inverters for trucks combine robust performance,safety features,and user-kind design elements. These features ensure reliable power conversion and protect both your devices and your truck's electrical system.

**Wattage rating:** The wattage rating of a power inverter determines the maximum amount of power it can deliver. Higher wattage inverters can handle more demanding appliances and tools. It's crucial to select an inverter with a wattage rating that exceeds the total power consumption of the devices you plan to use together. Such as, if you need to power a laptop (60W), a phone charger (15W), and a small refrigerator (150W), you‚Äôll need an inverter with a continuous wattage rating of at least 225W, and ideally more to handle surge demands during startup.

**Input Voltage:** Power inverters are designed to operate with a specific input voltage, typically 12V for trucks. Ensuring compatibility with your truck's electrical system is crucial for avoiding damage to the inverter or your vehicle. Confirm that the inverter you choose is specifically designed for 12V DC input to prevent any electrical issues.

**Output Waveform:** Power inverters produce either a modified sine wave or a pure sine wave output. Pure sine wave inverters provide cleaner and more stable power, making them suitable for sensitive electronics like laptops, medical equipment, and audio devices. Modified sine wave inverters are less expensive and can handle many common appliances, but they may cause interference or damage to certain sensitive devices. If you plan to power sensitive electronics, a pure sine wave inverter is the preferred choice.

**Safety Features:** Comprehensive safety features are essential in a power inverter to protect against overloads, short circuits, overheating, and low voltage. These features safeguard both the inverter and the connected devices from potential damage. Look for inverters with built-in fuses,automatic shutdown mechanisms,and audible or visual alerts for fault conditions.Overload protection prevents the inverter from exceeding its maximum power capacity, while short circuit protection immediately shuts down the inverter in case of a wiring fault.

**Ease of Installation and Use:** A user-friendly design simplifies the installation and operation of the power inverter. Look for models with clear instructions,readily accessible power outlets,and intuitive controls. Some inverters come with remote control panels, allowing you to monitor and control the inverter from a convenient location. Consider the location where you plan to mount the inverter and ensure that the cables and connections are easily accessible.

Key features of the best power inverters for trucks include:

*   High wattage rating for simultaneous device operation
*   Pure sine wave output for sensitive electronics
*   Comprehensive safety features for device and vehicle protection
*   User-friendly design for easy installation and operation

## FAQs Section

**What size power inverter do I need for my truck?**
The appropriate size of power inverter depends on the combined wattage of the devices you intend to operate simultaneously. Add up the wattage requirements of all devices and choose an inverter with a continuous wattage rating that exceeds this total. It's also advisable to consider the surge wattage requirements of certain devices, which may exceed their normal operating wattage during startup. A safety margin of 20-30% is recommended to ensure the inverter can handle peak loads.

**How do I connect a power inverter to my truck's battery?**
A power inverter can be connected directly to your truck's battery using heavy-duty cables. Ensure the inverter is turned off before connecting it to the battery. Connect the red cable to the positive (+) terminal and the black cable to the negative (-) terminal. Some inverters can also be connected to the cigarette lighter socket for low-power applications. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper installation to prevent electrical hazards.

**Can I leave a power inverter plugged into my truck's battery when the engine is off?**
Leaving a power inverter plugged into your truck's battery when the engine is off can drain the battery, especially when the inverter is drawing power to operate devices. It's best to disconnect the inverter or turn it off when not in use to conserve battery power. Some inverters have a low-voltage shutdown feature that automatically turns off the inverter when the battery voltage drops to a certain level, preventing excessive battery drain.

This is an episodic wall of complaining about a lot of the shit that's gone wrong in the past year of my life, some of which was my fault, some of which was not. Grab some popcorn if you want to read the saga of caca that has been my life post-graduation.

TL,DR; Former gifted kid goes through hardcore burnout, moves in with and becomes the live-in caregiver of their friend and then gets mistreated by that friend's abusive-ass family, loses 3 friendships, gets fired, loses cat, moves back in with parents, deals with a new personality disorder and ruins their relationship, becomes a single, unemployed, virtually friendless, out-of-shape bum with some glaring character flaws. 

Disclaimer: I know this paragraph is going to be a pretty shameless wall of bragging, I just want to emphasize how far I've drifted away from my former self. Illustrating my fall from grace, if you will; I was a pretty good student for all my life. Neurodivergence and terrible mental health plus a lot of awful experiences throughout my high school years meant that my grades eventually kinda turned to shit, but I made up for that by being a fantastic competitor in Academic Decathlon (the most decorated on my school's varsity team for the year I competed, and was a state-level gold and silver medalist). At state competitions, I started dating an amazing and sweet and intelligent guy who was on my team whom I had previously befriended. I lifted 5x a week, biked an hour a day, cooked and ate healthy (though not nearly enough for how much I was exercising), woke up at the asscrack of dawn. I studied multiple languages and had excellent Spanish, I took the AP's and the STEM courses, was a stellar writer who had the steadfast support of one of my English teachers (he's the reason I haven't given up on my lifelong dream of being an author). I did a few commercial gigs for a few different companies because I wanted the money, even considered going into some niche forms of modelling because I was cute and fit and was pretty sure I could do it. I did everything ""right"". I did everything amazingly, actually. Even when I hit such a huge wall of burnout that I became physically ill and had to take a whole damn week off school, I came back from it. Wearily, but I did. 

Post-high school, I moved in with my best friend to work as their live-in caregiver, which ended awfully. Their abusive family did their best to make my life a living hell for me and my friend enabled their mistreatment. I was crushed by the disappointment of realizing moving out of my parents' at 18 wasn't an achievement at all, just a trap I fell into because of an opportunity I had out of sheer coincidence of being friends with someone who needed a caregiver while I was looking for a job. I've always had shitty mental health, but my living situation pushed me into such a deep depression that I lost the will to do almost anything. I became sedentary, lost the will to exercise and cook even though they were both things I enjoyed, I gained almost 40 pounds in a few months. I stopped writing. I stopped going outside. I became practically agoraphobic (and I don't use the term lightly, I developed an anxious aversion to the outside world that I'm still working through). I stopped learning. My daily screentime climbed to the double digits. I couldn't even properly do my job anymore. 

I loved my friend, I wanted to take care of them, but I was too depressed and too anxious to leave my room to even take out my half-drank cups of coffee before they grew mold. I made myself sick and triggered my asthma and couldn't breathe well in my own room. My world became compressed to the size of my bed and yet my friend didn't seem to realize just how much their decisions were hurting me. They never took responsibility for bringing me into a toxic household, just dumped their guilt onto me in a self-deprecating way and begged for reassurance I wouldn't leave (to which I told them, I didn't want to leave, but I would if things didn't change). They never exercised the power they had to fire their nightmare of a grandmother who was their previous caregiver. They resisted me reporting the illegal things I saw go down even though I was a mandate reporter and could've been in legal trouble myself had it come to light I didn't report the shit that happened. They didn't stand up for me as their mother berated me and insulted me and said I was a terrible friend after I had a migraine and was too unwell to go with my friend to an event I'd said I'd go with them to. Their toxic family wasn't my place to intervene in until they dragged me into it, and then they expected me to just play along and take the turmoil to the chin.

As someone who's dealt with a lot of abuse myself, I understand firsthand the unwillingness to change things. It *is* scary to make such massive life changes and to cut people out of your life, even if they are dangerous and abusive. But my firsthand experience is also why I absolutely cannot forgive them for dragging me into it. Never in a thousand years could I fathom putting somebody else in harm's way like how they did to me. I did it when I was 11. Reported my abuser. You know why? To keep my little brother safe. To make sure he didn't wind up abused like I was. Because I love him and couldn't have lived with myself if he got hurt because I was too afraid to say anything. That's the sort of love I provide, and the sort of love I expect in return. 

My first taste of the adult world I'd craved so desperately after being so powerless and hopeless for most of my childhood was just as bitter as everything I wanted to escape. I ended up moving out, my friend fired me and said I abandoned them and they were better off without me, and we blocked each other on everything. My home, my job, my best friend, my cat (whom my friend legally owned, but she had bonded to me and everybody acknowledged she was ""my"" cat); all gone. 

Throughout all of this, three other shitty things happened: 

1. My childhood best friend revealed that they resented me, though never gave me a reason as to why, just said they didn't want to be friends anymore. The friend who I helped through their mental struggles and identity issues and whom I was there beside when their body started failing and they became disabled, whom I was there to take care of when they went through their first surgery that they were scared shitless for. They just... didn't want me as their friend anymore. No reason given. 

I wholeheartedly believe in the adage ""if you smell shit everywhere you go, check your shoe"". And yeah, I was far from perfect in all of the situations I was in. I wasn't as patient or understanding as I should've been with other peoples' unwillingness to stir conflict, I wasn't as good at following through with things as I should've been, I wasn't as emotionally resilient or regulated as I could've been and I did sometimes shift the burden of my emotional regulation onto them because I was used to carrying the burden of other peoples' emotions and wanted that same boundary-less devotion in return. But I *was* a good, caring person. If I was truly so awful as to have brought it all upon myself, would I be sitting here, wholly respecting these peoples' decisions to cut ties with me, reflecting on what I did wrong in situations where I was definitively wronged and hurt? I was a human, not a saint. I was (am, it's been a few months lol) a traumatized teenager with little support, not a beacon of morality who had a reference for forming the healthiest of relationships. I don't even know if the reasons I listed are the reasons my friend dropped me because, like I said, they dropped me without reason. It literally just felt like they hated me one day, and our years of friendship meant nothing. 

2. I invited an old friend whom I hadn't spoken to in a long time over to my house. He said I had gotten fat, that my house was dirty, and after I explained the relationship issues that I was having, said that my boyfriend was probably just staying with me to be nice. I called him out on his shit and we never spoke again. That one I don't really have any introspective ""I could've been better"" thoughts on. Fuck that guy.

3. The thing that disturbs my sleep the most, and what was unequivocally my fault; when the mental toll of everything going on in my life brought the symptoms of a previously dormant personality disorder to the forefront of my mind, and I became a horrible partner. I treated my boyfriend like shit. He was great, and understanding, and caring, and patient, and loving, and I became a terrible fucking partner. I tried to fix it but I couldn't hold myself together. I could not get ahold of my newfound BPD symptoms. I became clingy and anxious and would freak out over the smallest things and I'd accuse him of hating me and not caring about me, then break down over the guilt from my lashing out, and we'd have an okay few days, and then the cycle would repeat. We understandably broke up in February, though on good terms. We went back to being friends, and our dynamic's only gotten healthier since I've taken more time to process and heal. I haven't had a single episode in months. He's an angel. Now, I can say that our breaking up was the process of gaining a great friendship and necessary to me becoming a better person. At the time, it felt like the final nail in my coffin, the last abandonment I could handle.

I moved back in with my father and stepmother in December. And honestly, I haven't done anything with my life since. I burned through what little savings I had after being so irresponsible with my money while I was employed. I got my driving permit and I'm an okay driver now, though I've been putting off getting my license for the sake of ""getting just a bit more practice"". I've been passively applying to places since but live in a shithole city where the job market is especially terrible. I sent out hundreds of applications last month and got 1 callback from a place that then ghosted me, and then bombed an open interview for McDonald's. There's a community college I'm going to attend in the fall, but I have no idea what I'm going to study. I doubt that any degree I get is going to lead to money or success. I don't really care what job I have, it would just be a full time side hustle to keep myself financially afloat while I pursue writing. But it's been so long since I've written that I don't even know if I have the ability to write a novel anymore. 

I used to have such a vision for the future. Every step in life was just one more miserable thing that I would find my way to power through before eventually finding success. Now here I am. Just... existing. Not accomplishing or doing anything. No hobbies or mental enrichment. Just the four walls of my room, a lethargic complacency for being an unproductive freeloader having my father keep a roof over my head, and no firm grasp on the future.

I guess a year of being in an unproductive rut isn't the worst thing to happen. I get there's things I can do to fix this situation I'm currently in. Being 19 with few friends and being unemployed for a few months before going to college isn't that bad, I don't think. I had a half-hour lifting session yesterday for the first time in a year and it felt amazing. I have a good friend and with college I can have the opportunity to make more if I talk to people. I'm getting better and doing better.

Someday, objectively, this will just seem like a shitty chapter. A shitty roommate situation, losing a few friendships and my cat, getting fired, dealing with episodes of a new disorder and being jumped in an alleyway by all the negative traits I've picked up over a lifetime of mistreatment and toxic coping mechanisms, being kinda an unemployed single loser for a while. It could be worse. But fuck has it been awful.

I‚Äôll keep my story short. Went through my entire life without ever having a long term relationship. I always thought that I‚Äôd wait until I found the perfect one before going all in. This story is about I and Amy (fake name)

Fast forward to my senior year of college, I was entering my first class of the day and decided to sit next to Amy because she seemed really smart and I tend to ask a lot of dumb questions are the start of the semester. It also just helps with social anxiety when I can make a connection with someone in the class so I know I have someone I can talk too about the class. At first, Amy was pretty dismissive to my questions, but she warmed up to me by the end of class and started telling me more about what she did in her free time (played tennis, studying to be come a doctor, etc). Amy also told me about her class schedule and we found out we had 2 more classes with each other. Once the class ended, she rushed off and I mostly put our interaction behind me. 

Fast forward a few hours later, I‚Äôm entering my final class of the day and started prepping to take notes when the same girl was trying to catch my attention by waving at me from across the table. I was surprised at first, mainly because I didnt realize how beautiful Amy looked initially. Anyways, the class required us to form a group for a semester long class project. We formed a group with a few folks and created a group chat. Over the course of the semester, I would contact Amy separately to ask questions about our classes or our project. I also tried to be playfully funny over texts and calls because I just thought it was some harmless flirting (she reciprocated this, of course). Fast forward a few weeks of texting/calling, we were talking to each other on a daily basis at this point. I would get so excited to just see her name pop up on my screen. Amy and I had a mutual friend named Jake. Jake was basically the ‚Äòtherapist‚Äô for Amy and I. We would tell him about all types of things honestly. 

One day, I told Jake that I had strong feelings for Amy and asked if he knew what her current situation was. He told me that Amy had broken up with her Boyfriend a month previously because he had cheated on her birthday trip from several months ago. Apparently Amy‚Äôs ex boyfriend had gotten upset at Amy during her bday and cheated on her and didn‚Äôt tell her until months later. After they had broken up, Jake told me that they would occasionally hook up. At this point, I decided not to dig a deeper hole for myself and pursue anything with her. I decided to start talking to her much less than we did previously. 

Halloween: My Halloween parties were pretty legendary in college and I thought I‚Äôd invite Amy as well since she was a friend of mine. Prior to the party, she said she wanted to coordinate costumes with me (which seemed like a couple things to do) but I went along with it. We decided to dress up as a cow and a farmer which is irrelevant to the story. The first 2 hours of the party, I was having a great time with my friends and the Amy had arrived her friends. I couldn‚Äôt focus on any other girl in the room except her. Amy did seem a little out of it though. She told me she might have had Covid and was feeling unwell but she unfortunately had ‚Äúgummies‚Äù before the party because her ex-boyfriend was supposed to pick her up after the party so that they can ‚Äútalk‚Äù but never did and so she wanted to feel numb (I didn‚Äôt find this out until much later). Aside from that, I wanted to help Amy sober up, so I quickly made some tacos and fed them to her. She was stoned, but she still looked adorable. After the party decided to die down, I ordered an uber for her and her friends so that they could get home safely and that was that.

The following day, Amy and I talked again and she thanked me for the food and the party. I told her that I was getting ready to go to my friends party, when she told me she was going to stay in because she was confirmed to have Covid and felt really sick. Instead of going to my friends party, I decided to go to the grocery store, grab some ingredients, went home, and made some soup. I packaged up the soup and went over to Amy‚Äôs apartment so I could make sure she was okay and to give her the soup. She invited me in and I spent the next 2 days taking care of her. I would only go home to take a shower or grab something that she didn‚Äôt have in her apt but those 2 days were the best days in my life. She explained more about her situation with her ex-boyfriend and the next thing I know, we both admit to each other that we have feelings for one another. I was confused and happy and scared all at the same time. I was confused about how to move forward, happy that we liked each other, and scared that she could get back together with her ex at any moment. She stated that she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship but wanted to continue with what we had (text/calling/flirting). Even though I did want a relationship with her, I decided to do it her way (a situationship). We were hooking up, grabbing coffee, cooking together, going to parties together, studying together. And then a few months in, I told her I loved her. 

I think this scared her. Because a week later, she told me she was going to Jamaica with mutual friend of ours for free. I said nothing of it. Later on, i found out that the reason she got to go for free is because her ex-boyfriend was there and his brother played for a basketball team whose tournament was being hosted in Jamaica. Even after i found out, i stayed quiet but was enraged. 

A few months after this, she told me she was going to Australia to was the Australian Open and that her friend was playing in it. Again, i didn‚Äôt think this was a big deal. But while she was in australia, i asked her to check in with me as well as when she got back. I got almost no responses back. After a month of limited contact, she told me that she went to Australia with her ex bf because her friend who played in the tournament was also his friend. Apparently, they said that they still loved each other and she was working the courage to tell me. I told her I was cutting her off because i could no longer do this ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù where i was in love with her and she was still talking to her ex. She called me repeatedly for days and even asked my own friends to give her a call back. Eventually I caved in after a week and met up with her for coffee but did nothing else since i was still mad at her. A week later, i was making my way to my friends birthday party, when Amy called asking if we could walk together. I told her no because i didn‚Äôt feel comfortable being alone with her. After an hour of convincing, I caved in, went to her place to pick her up, and she invited me in. We talked about ‚Äúus‚Äù and how she cared about me and such. And we ended up ditching my friends bday party since there was also a terrible rainstorm to basically hook up. We were together for a few more months, and then I ended it around graduation because my heart couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Her ex attended her graduation party and I traveled to Europe for a month to figure myself out. 

Coming back from europe, we started talking again and was right back in a ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù for a few more months. One day, she gave me her phone to help her with something when I was that her ex bf texted her. I was curious so I went through her messages. She has been asking her ex to buy stuff for her like lulumelon which I thought was insane and I also saw in a text to her best friend that was seriously considering dating me but didn‚Äôt know for sure because she didn‚Äôt know about her ex bf. Once I saw these messages, i literally cried in front of her because my heart exploded. I love this girl and she even told me she loved me a few weeks prior to this. I was so confused but also felt like an idiot. She even had the audacity to ask me a month later to petsit her dog while she went on vacation with her family ( I did it because I was close with her famkly but it was still insane for her to ask me this) 

we stopped talking for about a year. Then she asked to meet up with me to talk. I didn‚Äôt because I felt like I needed closure. I also was not planning to do anything with Amy because I was in a relationship at the time (yes my gf was aware that I was meeting amy, she actually encouraged me to meet her to gain closure.) Amy apologized for the way she treated me and it actually felt good to move on. 

I ended up breaking things off with my gf (for reasons not involving Amy). A few days after my breakup, Amy calls to check in. We chatted for a little to catchup which was nice and that was pretty much it. 

A few weeks later, I had a cake delivered to her apt for her bday which she appreciated. We spoke a little and she asked me to come visit her (for a booty call im assuming) but our schedules didn‚Äôt line up. What I found weird was that Amy started sharing her location with me for no reason. But for the last 2 days, I saw that she wasn‚Äôt at her apt, but instead at her ex bf‚Äôs house. My assumption is that they are hooking up, and this feels really crappy because I still love her but can‚Äôt do anything about it. 

Anyways, that‚Äôs my story. I‚Äôm strongly in love with a girl for almost 2 years now and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. And it‚Äôs just worse knowing that she‚Äôs as her ex bfs house right now. The last few times we spoke, she‚Äôs even hinted of us starting to talk once again so like wtf! Any advice?

Rowena

Alpha's daughter? I can vividly imagine them: powerful, beautiful, flawless. And as for me? I'm the outlier in the family, the odd one out.

My father was a serious and upstanding alpha who ran the New Moon Pack; a pack that was revered as one of the most powerful ever known. My mother was a gentle and graceful luna, a woman who was as elegant and beautiful as she was intelligent and wise.

And my brother, Eric Griffith?

Well, he was a natural leader‚Äîa strong lion of the Griffith family. Among our peers, he was always considered to be the most likely person to become the Warrior King.

Aside from their achievements, my entire family was utterly beautiful with dazzling platinum blonde hair, ocean blue eyes, tall and slender with the perfect muscles. Their wolves were unmatched beauties, fast and strong and perfect in every way.

But not me.

With a petite frame and dull brown hair, I stood from my family like a sore thumb. It wasn‚Äôt just my appearance, either; I was wolfless. No one in the Griffith clan had ever been wolfless.

However, I did the best I could at what I was good at‚Äîmy intelligence‚Äîand thus, I became the nerd of the bunch. After Eric left the pack to travel, I survived the remainder of my long high school years as an ignored fringe with no friends, no respect, and certainly no romance.

But still, thanks to my grades, I got into one of the colleges outside the pack‚Äîthe best, actually‚Äîand its warrior camp represented the highest caliber of werewolves in the entire South.

There was a time when I was so excited to receive my acceptance email, where I thought I would finally be recognized for what I was worth. I thought that it would be a new start.

Oh, how wrong I was.

As I gaze into the smudged bathroom mirror, I still wonder if coming here to college was a bad decision.

Wolfless, the word that defined my place among the freshmen. Someone maliciously embedded gum into my curly brown hair, and despite my persistent attempts to pry it out with my fingers, it stubbornly clung on.

No one here even associates me with alpha of the New Moon pack, and when my last name no longer protects me, the bullying becomes even worse. I became an invisible entity, a pitiable nerd adorned with glasses, immersed in my studies all day.

Finally, with a soft grunt, I managed to break the piece of gum free‚Äîalong with a small chunk of hair. I winced as I flicked the sticky pink mess into the trash, then got to work washing my hands.

I quickly pulled my hair back once more into a ponytail, like I usually wore it, but then I paused; I put it into a tight bun instead. At least now someone might be less inclined to mess with it while I was walking through the halls.

Hopefully.

Once I was done, a quick glance at my phone revealed that class was in five minutes. Quickly gathering my things, I scurried out of the bathrooms and down the hall toward my second class of the day: medical training.

As a warrior combat management major, one would have thought that this class was my favorite‚Äîand it was, in theory.

As I walked into the classroom, the professor glared at me down his thin, birdlike nose and tapped his watch impatiently.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late, Rowena.‚Äù

I frowned and glanced up at the clock on the wall. ‚ÄúI have three minutes‚Äî‚Äù I began, but he cut me off with a wave of his hand.

‚ÄúTake your seat. In the future, you should know well enough to come ten minutes early like the rest of your classmates.‚Äù

Even though I wanted to argue and tell him that the reason why I wasn‚Äôt ten minutes early was because I was picking chewing gum out of my hair, I said nothing and took my seat. The snickers of my classmates floated through the air, causing a hot flush to rise into my cheeks.

‚ÄúNow that everyone is finally here,‚Äù the professor continued, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to be starting a new group project. Everyone, split off into groups of three.‚Äù

As the professor spoke, I felt my stomach sink; and as I watched all of the other students happily pair off into their groups of three, completely ignoring me, I felt it sink even more.

The professor, noticing how I was still sitting there, shot me another stern look. ‚ÄúDid you not hear me, Rowena?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúPair off. Groups of three. We haven‚Äôt got all day.‚Äù

I swallowed and looked around, but it seemed as though all of the other students were already taken. I turned back toward the professor.

‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt anyone left, sir.‚Äù

The professor let out an exasperated sigh and pinched the bridge of his nose for a moment. ‚ÄúCan anyone make room for an extra lone pity?‚Äù he bellowed.

The room fell into what felt like a silent mockery. It was typical; despite my top grades, no one respected me. I often wondered if they were jealous, and maybe they were, but it didn‚Äôt really matter. What actually mattered was that no one wanted the wolfless loser in their group.

The professor sighed again. ‚ÄúNo one?‚Äù

Still, nothing but silence. And then I heard it.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not even fit to be a warrior‚Äôs ornament. Why should I want her in my group?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe's such a loser that even her own wolf doesn‚Äôt want her.‚Äù

The voice came as a whisper, and I whipped my head around to find the source, but was only met with snickers and narrowed eyes. No one moved to make room in their group, and it was clear that I wasn‚Äôt welcome here.

‚ÄúMay I work in the library, professor?‚Äù I asked, turning to face him and blinking away the tears that threatened to spill.

He sighed and nodded. This had become our routine; no one ever wanted to work with me, and so I would often spend my class time in the library, working by myself.

I liked it better there, anyway. The books were quiet, and they didn‚Äôt judge me. Standing, I ignored the disdainful whispers of my classmates and slipped out the door with another word, making my way toward the library.

But then, as I was rounding the corner toward the eastern wing, I stopped in my tracks.

‚ÄúOh, look who it is,‚Äù a sharp female voice called out. ‚ÄúI think I found something that belongs to you.‚Äù

I whirled around, and that was when I saw her.

Emma White. She was in the same major as me, but we couldn‚Äôt have been more different; she was a cheerleader, a tall and slender girl with long blonde hair and striking blue eyes. She was one of the most popular girls at this school, and she hated me.

And she was holding my notebook. No, not just my notebook; it was my journal, a place where I poured out my inner thoughts, my fears, my‚Ä¶ desires. It wasn‚Äôt for anyone but me, and yet here Emma White was, reading all of it.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Emma said, flipping through the pages, ‚Äúthis is rather interesting. How many love notes have you written in this book? A hundred? Two hundred?‚Äù

‚ÄúGive it back,‚Äù I growled, marching toward her. But Emma twirled away.

‚ÄúTsk, tsk,‚Äù she purred. ‚ÄúSo silly, Rowena. What makes you think that the strongest warrior in this school would ever fancy the likes of‚Ä¶ you? A wolfless little nerd from the New Moon pack.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmma, stop‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really pathetic,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúTo choose a major that you‚Äôre no good in just to be close to your dream lover. Well, keep dreaming.‚Äù

‚ÄúEmma,‚Äù I hissed, ‚Äúyou know as well as I do that I score top marks. You‚Äôre barely even passing.‚Äù

I must have pissed her off then. In a fit of rage, Emma lurched forward, and her coffee cup‚Ä¶ it spilled straight onto my shirt. Dark brown liquid spread across the clean, crisp whiteness, soaking straight through to my skin. My eyes widened, and I stared down at it, frozen in place.

‚ÄúOops,‚Äù Emma cooed. ‚ÄúMy bad.‚Äù

I opened my mouth to say something, but before I could, a strangely familiar voice caught my attention. ‚ÄúWhen did you start secretly crushing on me, Rowena?‚Äù

Emma and I both turned sharply to see the source of the voice. And there he stood, at the top of the staircase with the sun at his back: handsome, muscular, with blonde hair that fell in lazy curls down to his shoulders. His ocean-blue eyes smiled down at me. I knew those eyes.

My brother, Eric, had returned.

# Chapter 2

Rowena

‚ÄúI guess I should be considered the strongest warrior in the camp now, shouldn‚Äôt I?‚Äù

Emma and I blinked up at the tall, handsome form as he sauntered down the stairs. He took each step slowly, his footsteps echoing through the quiet hallway.

I couldn‚Äôt believe it; my brother, Eric, had returned after three long years.

‚ÄúEric?‚Äù I murmured, taking a step forward. His hair was longer now, and he was more muscular, but it was certainly him. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù

Eric stepped down off the last stair and walked up to me with his hands in his pockets. There was a casual air about him as he approached me, and yet my heart was pounding in my chest.

‚ÄúMiss me?‚Äù he asked.

I opened my mouth to respond, but before any words could come, Emma‚Äôs sharp voice sliced through the air.

‚ÄúEric Griffith?‚Äù she called out. ‚ÄúAs in‚Ä¶ the Alpha‚Äôs son from New Moon?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the flesh,‚Äù Eric said, sweeping his blue-eyed gaze across the cheerleader. ‚ÄúFuture warrior king, too. Don‚Äôt forget that part.‚Äù

As Eric spoke, Emma fell silent. Nearby, students who had begun to get out of their classes stopped, overhearing the exchange and murmuring amongst themselves. In this school, Adrian Almond was the strongest warrior; not Eric, despite his prowess back in high school. For now, at least.

Growing up, though, my brother had been the strongest warrior in our entire pack. He was, of course, the son of an Alpha. My father spared no expenses when it came to Eric‚Äôs training, and it was obvious.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre back,‚Äù I muttered, feeling my face get hot. ‚ÄúAll this time‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThree years,‚Äù Eric said. He reached out to ruffle my hair, and my face got even hotter. ‚ÄúA long three years.‚Äù

I almost laughed. That was the truth; it probably felt even longer for me. Back when Eric was still living with us, people had respected me, at least somewhat.

Even though I lacked the white-blonde hair that was distinctive of my family, sharing only the bright blue eyes, people couldn‚Äôt disrespect me with my brother around. They were too afraid of him. Behind his back, they said that they didn‚Äôt believe I was his sister, but they didn‚Äôt dare much else.

But then he had been called away to warrior training. He had gotten to spend three years traveling the world and training at various warrior camps while I had been stuck at home, ridiculed by my peers.

I had begged my father to let me go with Eric, but he had said no.

And each day, the bullying had gotten worse.

But now he was back, a day late and a dollar short. What did that mean for me now?

Emma, who was still standing there with a dumbfounded look in her eyes, began to put two and two together. ‚ÄúGriffith‚Ä¶‚Äù she repeated, blinking at me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a Griffith, too. But you look nothing alike.‚Äù

A buzz of conversation started nearby as the onlookers continued to observe. Of course no one linked me to Eric, to the prestigious Griffith family. My caramel brown curls were completely out of place, and besides, no one would believe me even if I had tried to explain.

So I hadn‚Äôt. At least, not until now.

Before I could say anything, Eric pulled me in to a tight hug. His arms were bigger than I remembered, but he still wore the same scent: a cologne that smelled like campfire ash and whiskey.

‚ÄúI missed you, sister.‚Äù

I buried my face in his chest. ‚ÄúI missed you, too, Eric.‚Äù

When we pulled away, Eric‚Äôs eyes swept down to my blouse‚Äîruined by Emma‚Äôs coffee. I had gotten so caught up in his sudden return that I had completely forgotten until now.

‚ÄúDid you do this?‚Äù His gaze swept over to Emma, and she seemed to shrink beneath his stare.

‚ÄúI‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt‚Äî‚Äù she stammered, but Eric cut her off with a wave of his hand. He turned back to me and took me by both shoulders, inspecting the damage done to my shirt.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got an extra in my bag,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou need to change.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

Eric turned to leave then, but I stopped him. I didn‚Äôt need to say anything; my gaze darted to my notebook, which was still held in Emma‚Äôs hands. Without a word, Eric held his hand out to her expectantly.

She placed the notebook in his hand without further question.

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhat was in that notebook, anyway?‚Äù

Eric‚Äôs voice, deeper and huskier than I remembered, echoed off of the walls of the locker room. I unbuttoned my shirt, hidden behind a row of lockers. My face turned a deep shade of red as I glanced down at the notebook that was now peeking out of my bag.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù I lied, swallowing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just my journal. It fell out of my bag, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù

Eric scoffed. ‚ÄúAnd that little girl took it?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt she know who she‚Äôs messing with?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one believes we‚Äôre siblings, Eric,‚Äù I said as I shrugged off my stained shirt and grabbed the t-shirt that Eric had loaned me. ‚ÄúShe clearly had no idea.‚Äù

Eric was silent, but I knew he was there. I could hear him tapping his foot, a habit that clearly hadn‚Äôt gone away over the past three years.

‚ÄúYou know, sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm adopted,‚Äù I said with a sigh.

There was another pause before Eric answered. ‚ÄúYou know how mom always says that you were a gift from the Moon Goddess. Don‚Äôt doubt yourself; you‚Äôve always been a Griffith.‚Äù

I let out a wry chuckle. ‚ÄúWhy, then, are there not any photographs of me before the age of two?‚Äù

The tapping stopped. ‚ÄúYou know the story, Rowena; you were in the hospital until then. Mom didn‚Äôt know if you would survive, so‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I interrupted. ‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt want to take photos of a baby that might die because it would just remind her.‚Äù

I slipped Eric‚Äôs shirt over my head. It was crisp and clean, a plain white t-shirt. It fit much too big on me, but it was better than a coffee-stained shirt. Finally, I came out from behind the row of lockers.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said, pointing as I shrugged my bag onto my shoulder, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù

Eric turned to see a flyer taped to one of the lockers. Standing‚Äîand reminding me once again how tall he had gotten‚Äîhe walked over to it and ripped it down.

‚ÄúWarrior camp internship,‚Äù he said with a shrug. ‚ÄúFor combat management majors.‚Äù

I furrowed my brow and snatched it out of his hands before he could throw it away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a warrior combat management major.‚Äù

Eric scoffed. ‚ÄúYou? Really?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said slowly, lifting my gaze to meet his, ‚Äúwhy? Is that a problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo problem.‚Äù

I returned my gaze to the flyer. The idea of an internship, especially in my major, was intriguing. ‚ÄúHm,‚Äù I muttered as we began making our way toward the door. ‚ÄúMaybe I should try out. I wonder what the selection criteria is.‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably the prettiest one, when it comes to combat managers.‚Äù

I narrowed my eyes at him.

‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not saying that I agree with it,‚Äù Eric teased. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs the truth. It‚Äôs all anyone cares about these days. But I mean, if it was up to me, I‚Äôd look at intellect rather than appearances.‚Äù

Eric‚Äôs words, although intended to be reassuring, just made me roll my eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, sure. You don‚Äôt care about appearances, Mr. I-Only-Date-Models.‚Äù

Eric smirked, but said nothing. We made our way out of the locker room and down the hall, which was now bustling with students headed to lunch. I was still clutching the flyer in my hands.

‚ÄúDo you think I‚Äôd make the cut for the internship?‚Äù I asked suddenly.

He raised an eyebrow, appraising me. ‚ÄúMaybe a 5% chance,‚Äù he teased. Then, his hand shot out and he grabbed my glasses off of my face, holding them out of my reach. ‚ÄúWithout glasses, maybe 70%.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Eric,‚Äù I said, reaching for my glasses. ‚ÄúWhat are you, five years old?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, you can reach.‚Äù

‚ÄúEric‚Äî‚Äù

Suddenly, I felt a bump on my shoulder that caused me to stumble. I winced and rubbed my eyes, ready to apologize‚Äîif only I had my glasses, I thought to myself, I could have seen the person coming.

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù a familiar male voice said then. ‚ÄúIs this your new lover?‚Äù

Eric‚Äôs arm wrapped around my waist.

‚ÄúYes. She‚Äôs my most beloved one.‚Äù",1,1747558898.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kpfgmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hashimotos/comments/1kpfgmf/levothyroxin_absorption/,Levothyroxin Absorption,"Sorry for long post, I hope some of you have the patience to read it.

Hello fellow thyroid autoimmune friends! So, I have the opposite of all of you, I have an overactive thyroid (Graves disease). I hope it's ok that I am here because I have a question about levothyroxin and it seems that the medication regimin that I'm on is not very common amongst redditors in the Graves community. I am on block and replace, ie I take methimazole twice a day to block thyroid hormone and levothyroxin to replace it. It's a more expensive way to medicate Graves, it requires more medication and closer monitoring, so I think most doctors avoid it I guess due to pressure to save money but my endocrinologist here in Sweden does a lot of research and publishes on thyroid autoimmune disease and this is his preferred method to treat Graves. Apparently the thought process is that by stopping the over production of thyroid hormone all together the body gets a break from it and is more likely to go into remission. Also, Graves seems to have fluctuations and flares and this avoids that.

My question is, when do you take your levothyroxin for best absorption? I seem to not absorb it very well and I'm now on 150/125 micrograms alternating days and my TSH has gone from less than 0.001 to 5.2 in 6 months. I know that's not very hypo but, well I feel very lethargic all the time and I'd rather not feel like this.

My medication timing is complicated, I have to take methimazole twice a day at 12 hour intervals. I am also on dexamphetamines and Wellbutrin for ADHD which I need to take first thing in the morning and eat because I don't feel like eating again until around 3pm. So you see my dilemma, having to get up, take levothyroxin and wait an hour, then take all the other meds and eat breakfast makes for a long morning. I'm a teacher and ain't nobody got time for dat so I just end up skipping breakfast and taking my second round of meds with my coffee in my car when I pull up to work. Not great because it takes a while for the ADHD meds to kick in and my students think I'm a space cadet in the morning (they are 13/14 year olds so I have just explained the situation to them and they *try* to be kind). Also, the ADHD medication stays in the system for a while and makes it hard to get so sleep so the later I take it, the later I get to sleep at night. Currently, I fall asleep between 2-3am. Just to add to all of this, I also have type 2 diabetes and fasting is ok but I should eat breakfast.

I've also read that optimally you should wait 3-4 hours after levothyroxin before eating, drinking or taking other meds. Is that a real thing? I was told half an hour to an hour but I'm not sure that's working well for me.

So, I've started taking my levothyroxin when I go to bed, at 11pm. I don't eat or drink or take any more meds after 7pm. Does anyone else do this? I feel like it's working better, easier to get up in the mornings and my weight has been hovering around the same for months despite not eating much and suddenly I've lost 2kgs in 10 days. Is 4 hours without food, drink and medication enough time? I'd so appreciate any advice.

Also, I've had this comment from people with Hashis and without thyroid disease so I'll tell all of you. I'm not lucky for getting Graves. Firstly, no one is lucky for getting thyroid autoimmune disease and secondly, no it's not free weight loss. Graves is hard on the heart, pushes blood pressure up and can cause damage to kidneys (which it has for me), at one point I could hardly walk from my front door to my car without my heart rate skyrocketing and getting out of breath. Fortunately, I did not get the eye disease but that is horrible, makes your eyes bulge and even with treatment and being euthyroid you have it for life. The medication is awful, methimazole makes your hair fall out and yes, I lost 8kgs prior to diagnosis, but I put all of that on in a month after starting methimazole and a lot of the weight that I lost was muscle mass. I've done pretty well and I have managed to get that 8kgs off again plus another 4kgs despite being hypo, but I've heard of others who have gained upwards of 30kgs from methimazole, people who have never had a weight problem in their lives. These autoimmune thyroid diseases are shit. 0/10 do not recommend.",1,1747558103.0,Hashimotos,0,1.0,False

We had a fight and broke up and she went no contact blocking me everywhere .
2 days ago we talked about our issues and problems and she told me she needs space and time. 
Yesterday we had coffee and talked about everything and i plainly asked her if she has someone new and if she needs to free , she gave me her phone and told me to check every single social account she has and whatsapp to show that she is only focusing on her mental health/issues/family pressing her not to talk to me .
I kissed her when she left she kissed back.
And she wants to be sure 100% if getting back together is the right decision.
I told her that i'm starting to make more money now and will be stable for our future and i told how about we be together but no physically and whenever me or her feel think about the other we say hi and ask about each other .
She has been silent since yesterday afternoon and i don't know if i should text or talk or give her space .

There was this guy helping an older lady carry her tray to a table. It wasn't a big deal, just a random act of kindness. But it made me realize just how often I overlook these small interactions in daily life.

It's weird how something so simple can feel so... beautiful. Like, in a world where we're all rushing around, it's these tiny, often unnoticed moments that hold a certain quiet beauty. I guess it's a reminder that there's joy to be found in everyday kindness. Who knew a coffee shop could be such a source of inspiration? üòä",4,1747557354.0,NormaldayEpiphanies,0,0.84,False

My Vertuo Next (Krups) (out of warranty) was starting to make strange noises, and suddenly yesterday no more coffee came out. When I pressed the button I heard a couple of attempts to start it spinning but it stopped and the top light flashed orange a couple of times.

Following a couple of youtube videos I disassembled the top part and cleaned the nozzle, which had some coffee residue on it. After closing everything, the coffee maker works correctly, but now it leaks water from the back of the chamber both when decalcifying and when making coffee (area marked in red. The water comes from below the tube, tube connection is ok)

Any idea what could have happened? Maybe tightening the screws of the chamber will solve it? I checked the tightness of all of them, but I can redo them.

 Maybe there is some clearance in the little blue+white gasket after taking out the injector? (marked in green)

My first big one was when I was 15. my mums friend came over for a coffee, while she was here I started to feel uneasy, like a pit in my stomach. My mums friend left because my mum had to go to work, I was begging my mum to stay at home because something bad was going to happen. She stayed. About an hour later we found out my mums friend (who had been round for coffee) her husband had just died from a massive heart attack. 

Everytime I get this feeling it‚Äôs so strong it‚Äôs debilitating. Everytime I‚Äôve had it 4 family members/friends have died. 

Most recently I‚Äôd been waking up full of dread, anxiety and nausea to the point I physically couldn‚Äôt leave my house for a week. I fully convinced myself I had c****r and made a GP appointment. Thursday I took my soul cat to the vet because I noticed Wednesday evening he didn‚Äôt eat his dinner. Upon investigation it was found he was riddled with c****r. He was in agony and the prognosis was extremely poor. So I made the decision to send him to rainbow bridge. I‚Äôm heartbroken. Obviously. But my debilitating anxiety and feelings of dread have gone. 

I get more ‚Äúshallow bad feelings‚Äù whether jt be knowing my car is going to break down, my children have had a bad day at school, not too long ago I told my friend I‚Äôve got a bad feeling and she walked into her house just as her tumble drier was going up in flames. 

My Nan was a clairvoyant.
When I was younger my mum had been stopped on Mutiple occasions and been told I‚Äôve got an energy / I‚Äôm extremely gifted - my mum told me this a few days ago after I‚Äôd told her about the cat

I‚Äôve been to two dates with this girl. First one was a bit boring but the second one was much better as we were hanging out for more than 4 hours and did something more than just a bar or coffee.

I was wondering what my next date with her should be. I have two options. First is to invite her to a bar quiz that I go to with two of my friends(all men). This option is more friendly and fun environment and not so romantic.

The second option is to invite her over to my place and cook dinner watch a movie or some other activity. Here I can escalate with more physical contact and a kiss maybe.

I try not to overthink it but prefer to be prepared and that way to show I‚Äôm interest in her.

Gibt es Gamer, die Interesse an einer Halo: Infinite Mehrspieler-Session √ºber das Starbucks-WLAN in Schottentor haben? Das Spiel ist kostenlos und l√§uft auf dem Steam Deck sowie auf allen Ger√§ten, die Steam ausf√ºhren k√∂nnen. Laptops halte ich f√ºr ungeeignet, da sie zu aufdringlich sind. Wer teilnehmen m√∂chte, sollte das Spiel bereits installiert haben, den Akku vollst√§ndig geladen sowie eine geladene Powerbank mitbringen. Wenn sich eine regelm√§√üige Gruppe bildet, k√∂nnten wir zuk√ºnftig gr√∂√üere Locations mit stabilem WLAN nutzen. Ich glaube, dass Gaming-Handhelds f√ºr √∂ffentliche Einrichtungen weniger st√∂rend sind und eine zwanglose M√∂glichkeit f√ºr LAN-Partys bieten.

And we were talking about doing another show, and I just kind of half-asleep came up with the idea of a color rule for a bunch of characters. The red, white, black and yellow color scheme was something that was very prominent even in my previous work, so I started matching names up, matching ideas up. Also thinking about like, some of the ideas I‚Äôd stored up over the years. At some point or another the word ‚ÄòRWBY‚Äô came to me.

**Monty**: Starting the show out originally, I designed the original character, Ruby, as well as going into the other characters. So once I had the first trailer done, and thinking about the rest of the characters for the show, I started bringing in other artists who I had watched for years. People I‚Äôd always said ‚Äúsomeday I‚Äôll work with them, someday I‚Äôll have them design for me.‚Äù And when I was certain about having certain characters, I first contacted an artist I admired and found over DeviantArt. Her name was Ein Lee, she‚Äôs actually from Taiwan, and I found her art probably well over five years ago, and just loved her art style, and therefore wanted to incorporate it into my characters. So, I would do rough designs for team RWBY as well as designs for team JNPR, and she would flesh that out to be even further. To the point where eventually I didn‚Äôt need to design characters anymore, she started designing a bunch of the rest of the characters down the line.

**Monty**: The second person I brought on to RWBY was Kerry, because we had just been having conversations about the kind of show we could make. I‚Äôd been working with Miles on Season 10. He was writing scenes while I was making scenes, and so the three of us would have a lot of meetings and collaborate on the show to the point where I just started coming up with the broad strokes eventually and they had pretty much written the bulk of the show. Collaboration‚Äôs a big deal here, and I tried to include as many people as I can.

**Kerry Shawcross \[Co-writer\]**: Right after RvB ended, we wanted to just go straight into RWBY, but that was like right when we were going into commercial season. So we would work our normal hours here. Like 10 to 7-ish, then we would go back to one of our apartments and just start writing.

**Miles Luna \[Co-writer\]**: Monty really was enthusiastic about having these characters that may appear really one-dimensional for like the first few scenes that you see them, but the longer you get to know them, you realise ‚ÄúOh, Yang isn‚Äôt just a dumb blonde party girl. She‚Äôs a very caring and nurturing girl, that has had to essentially be there for Ruby when she was young.‚Äù

**Kathleen Zuelch \[Producer\]:**¬†When Monty and Miles and Kerry came to me, and really took me through the story. I started becoming a huge believer, because I‚Äôm a big fan of old school, traditional fairy tales, I love the Brothers Grimm, I love all the Snow White, and I love Little Red Riding Hood. I grew up with all of those stories, and the way that they were very clever in creating this whole world that‚Äôs kind of making homage to all of these amazing stories really inspired me to get more on board with what they wanted to do with this whole anime show.

**Taylor McNee (n√©e Pelto) \[Art Director\]:**¬†The world of RWBY, it looks very familiar. We wanted a blend of very classic looking architecture and clothing and cars, but we‚Äôre also mixing in this really kind of futuristic feel, like these little touches of some really futuristic stuff like holograms and things that you wouldn‚Äôt find in a classic \[inaudible\]. And that‚Äôs how we‚Äôre making this world unique. Our assets have to go through this pipeline of concept, modelling, texturing, and then finally being able to be put into the 3D program. So we start out with the concept and we usually bring that image into Maya, which is the main 3D software that we use. We have to make a 3D model that looks exactly like the concept that we were given, and it‚Äôs quite a process. Basically, we‚Äôre pushing polys and extruding stuff until we make the perfect shape, then afterwards we have to UV unwrap it, and then lay everything out on a texture sheet and then paint it, and that will put the image on the model. After that we‚Äôre basically done with the model and texture, and then we have to give it to the animators. So then we will set it up in Poser so the animators can grab it and use it for their characters.

**Gray Haddock**¬†**\[Lead Editor\]:**¬†There‚Äôs a lot of people working on this show, and there‚Äôs a lot of different elements in the pipeline. Editorial kinda serves as a hub between all the different departments, so we help all the communication and coordination between all the different pieces of the show, depending on what part of development that they‚Äôre in. Editorial‚Äôs getting involved way early in the process, we work alongside the director and the writers and the storyboard artists, and we use the scripts to help develop the storyboards and the camera angles for all those boards. So editorial is responsible for building up the moments of any given scene in terms of the timing and what you wanna look at, at any given moment. So we take the script and we help develop the camera angles and how long you wanna linger in a particular camera angle, look at one character or another or the scene as a whole, and the rhythm of the scene in terms of how long is it gonna take to spend on a particular line or when you want the music to come in, things like that. So we build up a set of animatics with the storyboards, and the first pass of all the audio. This is what then is handed off to the animators, so they can know exactly what is in what shot and how long do they have to animate it in a given shot. And once they‚Äôre done animating and their shot‚Äôs been approved, then their shot goes to the render farm, we get the rendered shot back and we drop it into the timeline for our episode and finesse the cut a little bit if we have to. But for the most part, we‚Äôve done our job right and everything should pretty much be locked in for the most part by the time we‚Äôre getting animation.

**Kerry:**¬†What‚Äôs kinda interesting as we‚Äôre creating the characters is, we kinda knew what kind of character they‚Äôd be. We knew Ruby would act a certain way, we knew Weiss would act a certain way, but we didn‚Äôt really know much about them. So we would get to the point where we‚Äôd be figuring out plotlines or figuring out dialogue and we‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúWhat¬†*would*¬†Weiss say here? What would Nora say here?‚Äù And then it turned into ‚ÄúOh well now we know.‚Äù

**Miles:**¬†Obviously we put a lot of thought into Ruby, Weiss, Blake and Yang before we started writing the dialogue. I remember sitting upstairs and we made a show bible, and we‚Äôre starting- we talked about likes, dislikes, personality traits. One of the first things I remember making was ‚ÄúWeiss drinks coffee. Blake drinks tea.‚Äù

**Kerry:**¬†It‚Äôs important. It sounds not important at all, but it‚Äôs very important. It says so much about them

**Miles:**¬†But it‚Äôs so important. So much about them, also it says nothing about them. It was just like- that‚Äôs just what it is.

**Monty:**¬†I want the show to have resonance with people who are growing up. Cos everyone‚Äôs story is the story of kind of becoming who they are. Especially these days when the path of becoming who you are tends to be marginalised with reality. Having done what I‚Äôve done, where I‚Äôve essentially dropped out of high school, started learning this stuff on my own, and therefore land in a position where I get to take the things I was dreaming about when I was growing up and make it real. I tend to get a lot of response from people who are also not sure what they‚Äôre meant to become, a lot of them also have the same bright imaginations and with the way the world is, the hardships of what it means to grow up tends to marginalise who you are, and I would hate that to happen to anyone because the future is in creativity and that‚Äôs not something you can just manufacture. I actually would like this show to grow up with the people, so unlike most shows where they tend to be ageless or age very slowly, I‚Äôd like our fifteen-year-old fans watching fifteen-year-old Ruby, when they‚Äôre twenty-five, to be watching twenty-five-year-old Ruby, and to actually have some resonance with the character. Probably one of my favourite types of feedback is to say ‚ÄúI know this person‚Äù or ‚Äúthis person is just like me,‚Äù and that‚Äôs probably one of the best things about coming up with these characters.

I am reading Yellowface and I am 60 pages into this book. All I can say is: I cannot believe June's audacity. She's really good at justifying her actions and she's quite manipulative. But the fact that she's the same age as I am and that we both want to be commercially successful published authors feels so freaking eerie. Athena was 27 too. Not to sound crazy but I feel like this story was written for me.

1. Power tripping management - yung tipong pwde sa kanila pero bawal sa inyo (I'm talking about undertime, loitering, doing personal transactions during office hours and personal lakad with friends and coffee things) ika nga, sabi nila, ""Wait til you become one. Wala kang karapatang magreklamo kasi wala ka sa posisyon."" (Tama nga naman, lowest mammal lang ako - utusan kung baga)
2.BOSH issues - Walang urgency sa Health concerns. Context: 
 A. Monitor na sira na, they don't replace immediately and you have no choice but to use it because hindi mo naman pwde i tabi muna ang work mo.
 B. Mga Peste (rats) which took more than a month bago na address (It took me 2 months before I trusted getting water from the dispenser and using office utensils again)
 C. Lighting - the office is so dark and I can't believe na endure ko ang lighting for several years. 
3. Gossip - mostly, the higher ups ang nangunguna mag Kalat ng chismis down to the lower ranking staffs. 
4. They don't follow certain policies crafted by CSC.
5. Inconsistent boss (instructions niya is pa iba2. I'm not sure if nagpapa sikat sya na alam nya lahat then nakita nya mali pala ang instructions nya kaya chinachange nya or talagang may topak lang siya)
To add as well, almost whole day siyang nakikipag chikahan sa ibang top management employees pero pag yung mga low mammals at JO nag uusap, bawal. Bawal daw ang cellphone (it's one of the policies naman) pero siya mismo buong araw naka titig sa reels. 

Though maganda naman ang Agency and most of my ""ka level"" okay naman, pero the factors I mentioned above are one of the reasons why I decided to leave. It's a plantilla item but I have no regrets leaving it. Sobrang toxic na talaga to the point na kahit kaka tanggap mo palang ng bulk na gawain mo, gusto agad ng boss mo na tapos na agad.
