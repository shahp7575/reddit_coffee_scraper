1jpek0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/yotta/comments/1jpek0p/tomorrows_the_day_for_me/,Tomorrow's the Day (for me),"This past Friday Evolve finally submitted a response to my complaint (which was submitted back in October). Unfortunately, I'm not able to share that response to help y'all plan for their arguments. Plenty of eye rolling content. However, since we are in mediation and not in the ""court"" aspect of arbitration, I really don't know what to expect for a result.

I did get a call from a lawyer representing a different bank. Being aware of our arbitration case, they were curious what route my wife and I were going and if we would be learning anything that may be of interest to them and the possibility of sharing information. They are in discovery themselves and commented on things that align with topics we have already commented on quite a bit on this forum, Jason's Fintech Weekly has reported on, and is even in the CoffeeZilla video. For example, they did reference Evolve's part in the shortfall (the Mercury migration and the fee's being taken out of end user FBO accounts).

Unfortunately, it does not appear this route my wife and I are taking will be of use for them.

Unsure if I'll be in a position to make any further contributions after tomorrow, I wanted to add this last bit of free info the lawyer offered as a courtesy for me returning their call.

Expect Mediation to go something Like this

1. The mediator is going to come in hard stating we don't have a case, why are we going through this now for what amounts to a loss of $400. Etc.
2. Just as hard as the mediator comes at us, he will be doing the samething to Evolve. To not get too discouraged, Evolve will be taking their blows as well.
3. Ultimately, the mediator only cares to get us to agree. He's not interested in anything else. He just wants to get the parties to an agreement which requires breaking us both down - that's how they get paid, that's how they build up their resume. 
4. Lastly, the lawyer mentioned to make sure we are aware of state laws for punitive damages. Not every state allows punitive damages in arbitration (Tennessee does).

Praying the best for everyone involved and impacted. My hope - with all of my posts of the last year - is that somehow, someway, what I've been able to provide, share, and accomplish others will be able to learn from and better prepare themselves so they get real results.",2,1743562359.0,yotta,0,1.0,False
1jpej35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1jpej35/belize_trip_reflection/,Belize Trip Reflection,"Leaving a reflection on a recent first trip to Belize we took in March 2025.  We had long wanted to visit, had previously travelled to Mexico and Guatemala, and jumped on short trip to Belize.  We absolutely loved it and would return.  Beautiful people, amazing country, unique experiences, and a very easy country to travel in.

**Broke Up the Trip.**  With only 9 nights, we wanted to get a taste of different areas - 1) the coastal plain and beaches, 2) the inland jungle, and 3) the island life.  We stayed outside of San Ignacio, on Maya Beach, and on Caye Caulker.  Our first night was at the Belize Zoo.  We loved moving to different spots every few nights and enjoyed the travel in between. 

**Rented a Car.**  The car rental agencies are literally steps across the small street from the airport.  Book ahead.  We went with Crystal – no problems with an after 6pm check out.  Having a vehicle provided so much freedom and driving was a highlight for us.  Distances are relatively short, fuel a little expensive, and roads go from fantastic to rough at the next turn or urban side street.  Driving in Belize was easy and oddly relaxing, as the pace is slow and the scenery fantastic.

**Chose Two Must do Tours.**  We focused on smaller owner-operator businesses with a great reputation, more personable interaction, and stated intent to leave early to beat the crowds. 

* ATM Cave Tour with the famous Patrick Bradley.  Patrick is a true storyteller of Mayan history, a seasoned guide, an exaggerator with a great sense of humor.  This is a once in a lifetime tour in terms of Mayan cultural significance, sheer sense of adventure and the fun Patrick instills.    [https://www.belizelimpkin.com/](https://www.belizelimpkin.com/)
* Hol Chan Snorkeling tour including shark ray alley, a shipwreck, all close to Caye Caulker.  In the 5hr trip we saw plenty of eagle rays, turtles, heaps of nurse sharks, schools of fish, a crayfish, some beautiful coral – with signs of decay.  Fantastic swimming conditions, clear, water is so warm.  Capt. Wilson and dad run a reputable owner-operator business.   [https://cayecaulkerreeffriendlytours.com/](https://cayecaulkerreeffriendlytours.com/)

**Travel costs.**   For accommodation we (2 people) leaned on Airbnb and found some very unique and ideal spots – costs from $150-300 per night.  Car rental was closer to $100 per day, for the 6-7 days we rented.  We splurged on the internal fights between BZE to Caye Caulker – well worth it but would go water taxi next time.  For daily spending we easily used $130 USD cash for two people on restaurants, coffees, beers, groceries, fuel for car, and a few mementos.  We cooked breakfasts most days in our accommodation, which is ideal as the places we stayed were the destination.

**Customs/Immigration.**

* Use the sticky at the top of r/Belize to complete the Digital Customs Form.  We also used QR codes in the Caye Caulker airport.  Don’t use pay sites!
* As a tourist, don’t fret too much on what you are bringing in terms of customs.  We packed our bags FULL of gifts and items we wanted to consume – Nothing to Declare line.  80% of one checked bag included gifts and donations for pack with purpose.  We had no questions during entry/scanning of our luggage.  More on Pack for Purpose here: [https://www.packforapurpose.org/destinations/central-america/belize/](https://www.packforapurpose.org/destinations/central-america/belize/)
* DO fret about getting stamped in and out of the country.  During our exit the immigration official oddly waved us through his checkpoint and as we passed alongside his booth we laughed how he was catching up on a telenovela on his side screen.  No joke!  We knew something was wrong and backtracked, showed the QR codes on our phones, handed passports, and got the exit stamp we needed.  The airport is easy to navigate, but this misstep and risk surprised us.

**People Made Our Trip.**  We loved our interactions with locals, hosts, expats, travelers too.  Belizeans are easy to engage with.  We had precious interactions with kids, debates with locals, and always felt welcome and safe.  Picking up hitch hikers and chatting with foreigners who have made Belize their home was also a highlight.  I can see why people return to Belize and why many stay.",1,1743562275.0,Belize,0,1.0,False

1jped09,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wattpad/comments/1jped09/april_fools_joke/,April Fools’ Joke,"On April 1st, I came across a viral Q&A post.  
“How do you stop your wife from suspecting that you’re cheating?”  
The top comment had the most upvotes:  
“Just confess to your wife on April Fools' Day and then wish her a Happy April Fools’ Day.”  
“She’ll think you’re just joking, and she’ll let her guard down from now on.”  
I didn’t think much of it, but then I saw a screenshot of a chat conversation posted by the person who answered.  
Although the profile picture was hidden, the messages were identical to those my husband had sent me.  
When I saw that comment at the bottom of the post, it felt like my blood froze. My fingers tightened around my phone, turning white.  
I’ve been married to Jack for five years, and our relationship had always been stable.  
I stay at home as a housewife, but I also run a food blog with a significant following. My videos get a lot of views, and I earn quite a bit—probably just as much as Jack.  
Whenever I went grocery shopping, the neighbors would compliment me on having such a good husband. I always thought so too, until today, when I saw that post.  
I didn’t believe it, so I clicked on the person’s profile to examine the avatar more closely.  
The man in the picture was wearing a suit with the collar exposed, but I recognized it immediately.  
It was the same custom suit Jack had worn on our fifth wedding anniversary.  
Although it was expensive, I didn’t tell him the real price because I didn’t want him to feel pressured.  
I continued scrolling through his profile.  
“How to hide an affair—proven effective.”  
“Say this to your wife, and she’ll think you’re a deeply devoted husband.”  
“Cheating secrets that won’t get caught—updated regularly.”  
Clicking on these posts, I saw various chat logs between him and other women, all of which were messages he had once sent to me.  
My phone slipped from my hand and landed on my foot.  
I wasn’t sure if it was the physical pain or the realization of my husband’s betrayal that made tears fall uncontrollably.  
I couldn’t believe it. My husband had been cheating on me all along, and I had no idea.  
I quickly took screenshots to save all the evidence.  
Click, click.  
As I was screenshotting, I heard a notification from the house.  
I followed the sound and saw Jack’s tablet on the nightstand, constantly receiving messages.  
I unlocked the tablet with Jack’s birthday and opened it.  
This tablet was used by Jack to handle work at home, but from what I had just seen, he wasn’t working.  
He was selling “cheating tips” and contacting his affairs in a forum.  
Sure enough, one message was from a girl with a cartoon cat avatar.  
“Jack\~ Can you come see me today?”  
“I’m wearing the pajamas you bought me\~”  
She sent a photo of herself in lingerie, intentionally revealing some intimate details.  
And Jack actually replied to her.  
“I’ll come after work, my little darling. I can’t wait to see you.”  
After sending that, he used another account to send me a message:  
“Sweetheart, I have to go fishing with the boss today, so I won’t be coming home.  
“I’ll catch a big fish for you when I get back\~”  
I felt sick to my stomach and couldn’t stop myself from vomiting into the trash can nearby.  
After a few minutes, I started to calm down and continued scrolling.  
There were over a dozen girls listed, but some of them had stopped replying.  
I guessed that once Jack got tired of them, he’d cut them off and find new targets.  
The pinned post seemed to be a recent find.  
“Scumbag!”  
“A dog who can’t control his lower half, turning his affairs into a bragging point!”  
I cursed while copying everything from the tablet onto a USB drive.  
Then, I sent Jack a message:  
“Make sure to stay safe, my dear husband\~”  
When I saw these things, my first reaction was to gather the evidence and divorce him, making him leave with nothing.  
But after a moment of reflection, I realized that would be too easy for him.  
Losing a little money and reputation? That wouldn’t be enough. I wanted him to pay.  
Maybe it was because he forgot to log out of his account, but when I tried to check the messages again, the login was already gone.  
A second later, Jack’s account sent me an update:  
“Tell the wife you’re going fishing, and she’ll think you’re fishing in the lake, but in reality, you’re fishing for beautiful women in bed.”  
The post included screenshots of our conversations and unedited photos of the girl.  
The comments below were full of praise for him:  
“You’re amazing! You’ve got such young girls, you must be really something!”  
“Such a life is really enviable\~”  
Jack probably felt like a superstar reading these.  
“Jack, the more you gloat, the more hopeless you’ll feel when the punishment comes.”  
The first thing I thought of was to go to the hospital and get checked for any diseases this scumbag might have given me.  
After all, my health was the most important thing.  
On the way to the hospital, I looked at a post from another man confessing his affair, and one photo caught my eye.  
It was a family photo of him with his wife and child. He was standing behind them, and the woman was holding their kid.  
Why did it feel familiar?  
Because it was a month ago, I had seen this woman in my fan group. She was my top fan, Jean.  
Back then, she happily told me how much her husband and child loved the recipes I shared.  
I never thought I’d see her name under a post about a cheating husband.  
I immediately contacted her.  
“Hello, I need to talk to you about something.”  
The air conditioning in the taxi made my hands and feet cold, and even my typing fingers trembled.  
I was worried that telling her about this might ruin her marriage.  
And her daughter was so young—would she be able to handle the truth?  
Jean replied quickly, sounding excited.  
“I never thought my favorite blogger would contact me privately. I’m so excited!”  
“If you need anything, I’ll definitely help!”  
The more she said this, the more guilty and uneasy I felt.  
But I sent her the draft I had prepared.  
“I found out that my friend’s husband is cheating, and I’m not sure if I should tell her.”  
I saw the message bubble appear in the chat, and I nervously swallowed.  
Even the driver noticed my unease.  
“Don’t worry, miss, everything will be fine at home,” he said as he turned off the air conditioning.  
The brief kindness from a stranger helped calm my nerves. I smiled and nodded at him.  
At that moment, Jean sent a reply:  
“If it were me, I’d definitely tell the other person. This kind of thing can’t be forgiven.”  
I decided to tell her about my situation first, so she could discover the truth on her own.  
“Actually, the friend is me.”  
There was a long silence in the chat, and before she could respond, I arrived at the hospital.  
While waiting for my blood test results, I started to feel uneasy again.  
Suddenly, my phone buzzed, and Jean’s reply made me smile.  
“Shall we take revenge together?”  
She must have figured it out from the post I shared.  
“Cheaters should pay the price, don’t you think?”  
Jack came back the next morning, holding fishing gear and looking downcast as he entered.  
Though he seemed regretful, I could still see the satisfaction in his expression from fulfilling his desires.  
“Wife, I fished all night, but still came up empty…”  
His head rested on my shoulder, looking like a dog that had been beaten.  
I patted his messy hair.  
“It’s okay. We’ll just try fishing somewhere else next time.”  
I pretended not to know anything and acted like the foolish housewife who still believed in him.  
“Go get cleaned up. I made you some soup. You haven’t slept all night—drink it and rest.”  
Jack went to the bathroom to freshen up, and I used a wet wipe to clean the areas he had touched.  
Looking at the fragrant soup simmering in the pot, I took a photo and sent it to Jean.  
“The nourishing soup is ready! How are things on your end?”  
Jean replied with the same message, and I closed my eyes with a satisfied smile.  
“Honey, the price you’ll pay is starting to take shape\~”  
Jack drank the soup and felt a little groggy, unsure if it was from yesterday’s efforts or just from exhaustion.  
All he wanted was a place to sleep.  
After kissing me on the cheek, he went straight to the bedroom and collapsed into a deep sleep.  
I cleaned up the dishes, hearing his snoring from the bedroom, before I felt at ease and walked into the room.  
I used Jack’s fingerprint to unlock his phone, then installed the content-syncing app I had on my phone onto his device.  
This was the plan Jean and I had discussed after deciding to take revenge on the scumbag.  
The app was something I got from a friend I knew back in college, all to get the evidence we needed.

Jean's speed was quick. Looking at the messages on my phone, I couldn’t help but feel quite pleased.

""My dear husband\~ I hope your body can endure all of my revenge.""

After that day, my video account announced a temporary halt in uploads. I needed to make my husband pay the price first—how could I focus on managing the account as I did before?

When I arrived at Jack's company with the lunch box, I ran into Jean right at the entrance. We had already video-called, but I didn’t expect that my unfaithful husband would be working at the same company.

Jean's voice was as gentle as her personality: ""I was going to bring you the ingredients after I finished cooking\~""

I couldn’t understand why her husband would cheat. Such a good woman, yet she wasn't properly cherished.

She pressed the button for the top floor, and almost instantly, I knew who her husband was. I got off the elevator on the middle floor, exchanged a glance with her, and then walked into Jack's work area.

I didn’t visit his company often, only meeting a few of his close colleagues.

""Who are you? Why are you in our work area?"" A young woman stepped in front of me and questioned me. Although her words were directed at me, her eyes clearly indicated that she recognized who I was.

I didn’t answer, seemingly contemplating which of Jack’s past lovers this girl might match.

It was another observant colleague who spotted me and quickly came over to pull her away. She scratched her head apologetically toward me.

""Hellen, what brings you here today? Jack’s busy. Don’t mind Lisa, she’s new and doesn’t know any better.""

I narrowed my eyes and vaguely remembered this girl named Lisa. She was Jack's previous mistress, whom I discovered and forced him to break up with.

No wonder she looked at me with such hostility.

A worthless cucumber, and they’re fighting over it.

When I entered Jack's office, he was sitting at his desk processing documents. He didn’t even stand up when he saw me.

""Darling... what are you doing here?""

I placed the lunch box on the table, my voice carrying a hint of sweetness.

""Just came to bring you lunch, worried your stomach isn’t good. It’s bad to eat outside, it could affect your health.""

Jack smiled, but it was clearly forced. As soon as I moved, he seemed nervous.

I suddenly found this quite amusing, so I stood up and deliberately walked closer to his desk.

Jack broke out into a cold sweat, constantly swallowing, afraid that someone would notice what he was doing under the table.

""Darling\~ you must eat well\~ this is a wonderful tonic for your body\~""

Then I turned and left the office, but I could still vaguely hear Jack’s voice.

""Damn! That almost gave me a heart attack...""

I sat in the coffee shop downstairs with Jean, leisurely sipping my coffee.

A post I was following on my phone suddenly updated, so I opened it to check.

""My wife brought me lunch, but I was secretly cheating in the office.

""Nervous and thrilling, after she left, I had a wild time in the office.

""Afterward, I ate the big tonic meal she brought, and my conquered wife will never suspect me.""

It even included a photo, showing a woman lying on the desk, covered in red marks, with comments filled with admiration and praise for Jack. They practically revered Jack as a god of infidelity.

For a moment, I didn’t know whether to curse Jack or pity the woman. Her naked photo was exposed to the public. I wondered if she would break down after seeing this.

I shook my head and saved the new evidence as screenshots.

Jean, however, remained unusually calm, which made me curious.

""You seem to be used to this kind of thing?""

Jean enjoyed the rich aroma of her coffee.

""It’s not that I'm used to it, it’s just that they gave us an opportunity.""

I grew more suspicious. ""What opportunity?""

""My marriage is a business one. Although there’s some emotion involved, to me, the benefits are the most important.""

""He gave me an opportunity to bring him down. How could I not be happy about that?""

""Don’t worry, my actions won’t delay your revenge on your husband.""

I looked at Jean seriously, beginning to understand her perspective.

Who says women can only be housewives?

Who says we have to tolerate infidelity?

A smile spread across my face, and I found the coffee in front of me even more enjoyable.

""It seems our opinions align perfectly.""

When Jack got home from work, he saw me wearing an apron, making soup in the kitchen.

He came over and hugged me, still smelling of the lingering scent of women’s perfume—sweet and cloying, making me feel nauseous.

But I couldn’t show this emotion yet. I just smiled and turned to embrace him.

""Hubby, you’re back! I missed you so much\~"" I said.

But on the side he couldn’t see, my face darkened, and I almost wanted to strangle him right then and there.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed, and Jack loosened his hold on me.

He quickly pressed the screen down to hide what was on it, unaware that the message had already synced to my phone.

""Sweetheart, it’s something from the office. I’ll go handle it.""

Watching him walk into the study and close the door, I opened the message on my phone.

It was from that girl.

""Jack\~ The water's been cut off at my place. Want to come shower with me?""

She seemed particularly skilled at using her body to flatter men.

Along with the message, she sent a photo of herself with a towel that was about to fall off.

Jack was smiling so broadly that his grin almost reached the back of his head. He hurriedly sent the girl a voice message.

""Miss me that much? Didn’t I take care of you enough at the office today?""

When I clicked play to listen, my skin crawled with disgust.

""Sweetheart!""

Suddenly, Jack burst out of the study, startling me so much that I turned off my phone, afraid he would find out.

""I’ve got a colleague nearby whose water’s been cut off. She was wondering if she could use our shower,"" Jack said with a clumsy excuse.

His story was so poorly constructed. The nearby neighborhoods all share the same water supply pipe. How could part of the area be cut off while the rest had water?

In just a few seconds, I saw through Jack’s plan but still agreed to his suggestion.

After all, I wanted to watch him dig his own grave.

""Baby, let her use our shower,"" I said. ""Don’t worry, Hellen will never find out.""

The doorbell rang soon after, but Jack didn’t dare open the door himself. Instead, he asked me to answer it.

After the girl entered, she shot Jack a playful glance as if I weren’t even in the room.

""Hello, sister-in-law\~""

Before she came to my house, I thought maybe this girl was innocent. But now, though she respectfully greeted me, her subtle challenge toward me was unmistakable.

I knew that she and Jack were in cahoots, one willing to strike and the other willing to take the hit.

""The soup’s still cooking in the kitchen. If you need anything, ask Jack,"" I replied.

Jack seemed pleased with my response.

As I headed toward the kitchen, he tried to cover up his nervousness by calling out loudly, ""Sweetheart, I’m going back to the study to handle some work!""

But he didn’t notice that my phone was set to selfie mode and was facing directly toward the bathroom.

I lifted the lid of the pot, inhaling the rich aroma of the soup, and pulled out a small gourd-shaped bottle from my apron pocket.

Inside it was powdered herbs—an ingredient that could cause weakness and shortness of breath.

After all, when I started my food blog after marriage, I specifically learned about herbal medicine from the local herbalists.

I stirred the herbs into the soup, letting the powder dissolve completely.

I ignored the occasional soft moans coming from the bathroom.

When Jack came out of the bathroom, I suddenly appeared in the kitchen holding a knife, my face cold with a sinister smile.

Jack froze in fear, collapsing onto the floor, his voice trembling.

""Sweetheart... Sweetheart, you’ve misunderstood! I... I just...""

I tilted my head, showing no emotion in my eyes. ""Misunderstood what?""

Jack’s legs were shaking uncontrollably, and I could see a faint wet stain in the middle of his pants.

After scaring him enough, I finally lowered the knife.

""I just finished cutting the ribs. I was wondering if your colleague wanted to join us for dinner?""

When he heard that, he finally breathed a sigh of relief, scrambling to his feet, but his legs continued to tremble.

""Sure! Sweetheart, your cooking is so delicious. I’ll let her try your cooking,"" he said, reaching out to embrace me. But when he saw the knife, he quickly retracted his hand.

The dinner wasn’t very pleasant. Jack kept thinking about the moment I scared him earlier, while the girl across from him had her foot on his thigh, but he barely noticed.

""Well, Hellen, I’ll head back now. Jack, see you at the office tomorrow\~"" she said, her tone split between disdain for me and flirtation with Jack.

That night, lying beside Jack, I brought a flower pot into the bedroom before sleeping.

The flower was quite ordinary, but if someone who’d been startled during the day smelled its fragrance while sleeping, they would fall into a deep, dreamlike state, waking up repeatedly only to fall back into it. Over time, this would lead to nervous exhaustion.

I looked at Jack, already breaking into a cold sweat, and smiled with satisfaction.

""Sweetheart\~ Your time for sweet dreams is over\~""

For the next week, Jack was tormented by nightmares every night. Each time he woke up and saw me asking if he was okay, he trembled and tried to distance himself from me.

Even his communication with that girl gradually dwindled. Whenever she sent seductive messages, Jack would come up with various excuses to delay her.

One day when I brought Jack lunch, the girl had just left the office. She shot me a vicious glare, clearly frustrated at not getting what she wanted from Jack, and then looked at me with displeasure.

After setting down the lunchbox, I looked at Jack’s pale face and deliberately added a tone of concern.

""Sweetheart, are you not feeling well? Should you rest properly?""

Jack shook his head. He had been having nightmares frequently, and now, whenever he saw me, he instinctively wanted to avoid me.

Sighing, I pretended to be sad and left the office.

This time, I didn’t take the elevator but headed to the stairwell.

I had just seen that girl enter there.

The hallway was filled with the pungent smell of smoke, and it was so quiet that I could only hear one person speaking.

""Damn it! Why did she suddenly lose interest in me?""

""Could it be some other bitch seduced her? Is it one of the interns?""

The girl muttered, occasionally puffing out smoke rings.

She turned and locked eyes with me.

""Ah, isn’t that Hellen? Why are you out so soon?""

Lisa extinguished her cigarette and slowly walked toward me from downstairs.

""You heard all that?""

I could only feel how the smoke on her body was so pungent, making me unwilling to converse with her.  
""Don't worry,"" she said casually, ""I'm not trying to destroy your family. I just want to get what I need from him.""  
""When I have what I want, I'll naturally cut ties with him, and then I’ll return Jack to you.""  
She spoke so easily, as though Jack was merely an object she could use and return when done.

I raised an eyebrow slightly. ""Why would you think I’d want something that's already been used by someone else?""  
""Sorry, I’m a bit of a clean freak. What you don’t want, I don’t want either.""

She suddenly burst into laughter and moved even closer to me.  
""Hellen, I think you’re more interesting than him.""

I couldn't help but roll my eyes, pushing her away as I left through the stairwell. Before I closed the door, I left her with a final remark.  
""What are you after with me? You might as well take care of your own body; no one else can control that.""  
I had a pretty good guess at what she wanted from Jack, but I didn’t approve of her methods. Trading with one's body only leads to self-harm or leaving someone with a hand to hold over you. Though I wasn’t some grand heroine, I at least refused to be someone who submitted.

But this was certainly a piece of information that could be used. Since she had actively seduced Jack, I could choose to use her in return.  
I opened my phone and found the girl who had first stopped me.  
""Are you there? Want to know why Jack dumped you?""

The reply came quickly. I knew her feelings for Jack weren’t as simple as just a one-night affair. After all, she often sent him messages, hoping he would change his mind, but received no replies, even being blocked. A person with such obsession was likely to do something crazy, and I was very curious.

As I subtly brainwashed Yao Yao, I continued feeding Jack the ""super-nutritious soup,"" sending him meals for a month straight. His condition visibly worsened, losing weight from the continuous torment and nightmares.

As he stopped updating, most of the comments on his account were asking,  
""Has the host been found by his wife?""  
""Still waiting for the host to give us more benefits.""

I smirked at one comment that felt especially accurate. ""Indeed, he’s been found, but he can't update, and it’s not just because of that.""  
I really wanted to reveal to the commenters that the real reason Jack couldn’t cheat anymore was that he couldn’t even get it up.

After preparing today’s meal, I had to visit the office, only to find the floor where Jack worked had turned into chaos.  
A girl named Lisa was pulling the other girl's hair, her eyes bloodshot as she screamed in fury.  
""You bitch! You seduced him, didn’t you!""

The younger girl was clumsy in her struggle, and Lisa's anger had reached its peak. This erupted during the lunch break.  
A few employees tried to intervene, but most were just watching the spectacle.  
""You can't handle your man and now you want to blame me? Fine, I’ll return him once I’m done with him!""

Her words were just like what she had said to me, but it only enraged Lisa further.  
The two women were suddenly pulled apart.

I hid in the crowd, sharpening my voice.  
""If this were streamed, I bet it’d make quite a bit of money!""

My provocation had a few people filming the scene, and before long, it quickly made it to the trending list. I thought it’d be shut down fast, but I received a message from Jean.

""I told my husband about what’s going on on your floor, and I also mentioned the company’s stock price drop. He fainted from rage.  
""He’s being resuscitated right now, so no one has time for your floor.  
""Keep making a scene, this is perfect for us to profit from.""

I relaxed, watching the scene unfold. I figured it was about time for Jack to appear.

Jack walked over, unsteady, his exhaustion evident in his eyes.

I glanced at the comments in the livestream, feeling strangely satisfied.  
""Is this the guy the two women are fighting over? He’s this weak?""  
""He must’ve been drained by them! Trying to have both?""  
""Which one’s the wife and which one’s the mistress?""

As I considered the comments, plotting when to make my appearance, I saw Lisa, suddenly bolstered by unknown strength, break free from those holding her back.  
She rushed over, tearing open the other girl's shirt, exposing her chest completely.

Some sharp-eyed viewers began to comment on the mole and tattoo, recognizing the girl as the one from Jack’s posts.  
""Isn’t that the girl from the post? Could this weak guy really be the one they’re fighting over?""

Within minutes, Jack’s post link appeared in the livestream, and the scene hit the number one trending topic.

""Thought it was some rich guy playing games, turns out he’s just weak.""  
""He's ordinary, but wow, look at the games he’s playing.""  
""Disgusting, really feel sorry for his wife. I’d be tempted to chop his dick off.""

As the two women continued their futile fight, someone had spilled the truth, so now it was my turn to make an entrance.

Trying to stop them, Jack was shoved by Lisa, falling to the ground in a mess. I slipped in from a less crowded side, the meal I was holding falling to the floor.

The sudden change in the situation left the chaotic scene in an eerie silence.  
""Husband? Could it be that all this is true?""

I acted like a naïve fool, just realizing the truth, covering my mouth as I feigned tears.  
There were no screaming accusations, no curses.  
The more silent and broken I appeared, the more pathetic and unlucky I seemed.

The comments quickly turned their focus to me, as if they were preparing to judge Jack.  
I didn’t give him the chance to speak, instead throwing out a series of questions that, while seemingly filled with doubt, effectively summarized his wrongs.

""So, you really cheated with these two girls at work?""  
""And those posts about your cheating, were they real?  
""No wonder I’ve been trying to help you with your health, but we can’t conceive… you’ve already been drained by them, haven’t you?""

I wiped away the nonexistent tears, performing the scene with great skill. I even thought I should be awarded a trophy for my performance.

Jack, in a panic, tried to explain himself, but the moment he stood up, he collapsed backward.

The live stream abruptly cut off at that moment, but the heat of the incident didn’t diminish.

I followed the ambulance to the hospital, my eyes red, looking utterly pitiful.

Jack's surgery was deemed a success, as his life was saved. Though most of his organs showed signs of failure, the online frenzy continued, and no one suspected that the herbs I had secretly placed in his meal were the cause.

When Jack woke up, he saw me sitting by his bedside. He confidently spoke, almost making me slap him across the face.

“Wife, I didn’t expect you to love me this much, taking care of me day and night...”

“I’m so touched. After I recover, we’ll live a good life together. When I’m better, you can give me a big fat son.”

He became increasingly shameless, confidently thinking that as long as he returned to me, I would always stay by his side.

“After all that’s happened, I realized, wife, you are the one who loves me the most.”

“Those women outside are just passers-by; you are my home.”

I rubbed my ears, my patience completely worn thin, eyes filled with annoyance.

“Are you brainless or do you have none at all? Are you the Jade Emperor? Do you think your words are imperial decrees?”

His sudden silence gave me the opportunity to speak.

“I knew you were cheating from the very first time. That’s why every day I added medicine to your food to prevent you from having children.”

“After all, who would want the child of a rotten cucumber?”

Although Jack was saved, I knew his body was already depleted. His current appearance was just a facade, hanging on by a thread.

Once that thread snapped, he would be gone, and only then would he tell the truth.

“Taking these herbs for just over a month won’t completely drain you. So, I started acting two years ago, when you first cheated.”

I was never a kind-hearted housewife. When a big goose in my village bit me as a child, I killed it on the spot and had my mom cook it for dinner.

In high school, when someone accused me of spreading false rumors, I quietly lurked around for a month, then shoved a dirty rag in his mouth and made him wash it clean.

I gently stroked Jack’s slumped head, tenderly like when we first got married.

“My dear husband, can you guess why I’m telling you all these truths?”

Jack’s eyes widened in shock, his breathing becoming more difficult, no longer showing the energy he had moments before.

“You... what did you give me...?”

He stuttered, trying to ask me what medicine I had given him.

But I simply pinched myself hard, letting the tears fall, and loudly cried in the hospital room.

“Doctor! Come quickly! My husband, he’s not doing well again!”

The machines beeped urgently. By the time the doctors arrived, his heart rate had flatlined.

One of the doctors sighed and patted my shoulder.

“We did everything we could, ma’am. Please accept our condolences.”

As the doctors confirmed his death, I nearly couldn't suppress a smile at the corner of my lips.

Jean, who had also lost her husband, sent me a comforting message. She had taken over the company and gave an inspiring speech to the board.

“I will make sure his company reaches new heights!”

Lisa and the other girl were fired from the company. Lisa was fortunate that no scandals about her were exposed, and she quickly found a new job. However, the other girl was publicly shamed, and wherever she went, people gossiped about her. She eventually had to leave the country.

After everything was over, I resumed posting on my long-abandoned account.

The first post was a public service announcement about which herbs are toxic and should never be consumed together.

Jean and I sat in a coffee shop, sipping rich coffee, both eyes gleaming with cunning.

She and I were cut from the same cloth. Our marriages hadn’t ended in divorce; they had ended in widowhood.",2,1743561838.0,Wattpad,1,1.0,False

There have been several times where he’s gone weeks without seeing our son, and when he does show up, he’s never actually sober—yet somehow, I’m the one constantly being accused of being the problem.

The most recent incident that pushed me over the edge: I was leaving a party and called him asking if he could bring out the full iced coffee I forgot inside. I was exhausted, already overwhelmed, and when he told me it was dumped, I got frustrated and upset. What I didn’t know was that he had me on speakerphone in front of 12+ people, including his family and friends. Everyone heard me being upset. As I drove by the building, I saw people literally turn and look at me. He set me up to be embarrassed.

Later, he told me everyone at the party now thinks I “treat him like shit.”

Then it turned into this whole thing about how I removed a tag from a Facebook post (one that his sister made—not even him) about our son’s birthday. He claimed that I “don’t want people to know he’s involved,” even though I posted all about the party myself. He and his sister made it seem like our son took his first steps at the party—to him—which wasn’t true. My son had already been walking.

It felt like a weird performance to make himself look like super dad in front of everyone, while at the same time I was being talked about and subtly attacked in social posts. When I tried to set a boundary and stop the argument, he said I was “avoiding accountability” and “couldn’t handle the truth.”

This is also a man who drank 12 beers at our son’s first birthday party—but now claims he’s the one who “cleaned up” and that I’m bitter and jealous of his growth.

When I ignore him, I’m “cold.” When I speak, I’m “aggressive.” When I try to disengage, he says I “run from accountability.” Even when I’m literally putting our son to bed, he says I’m “avoiding the conversation.”

I’m just tired of being blamed for everything while trying to keep things peaceful for our child. He constantly flips things and tells me I’m lying, manipulative, or hiding things for “clout.”

I have screenshots of it all, but honestly—I just feel broken down.

Am I wrong for feeling hurt? Is this emotional abuse? Or is it just a really toxic co-parenting dynamic?
If anyone has been in this kind of situation, please tell me how you protected your peace—especially when you have a child with someone like this.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed (like I was), especially after learning you carry APOE4, here are 3 things that made a real difference in my daily stress:

**1) Meditation + Journaling** Try a few different apps—Headspace, Calm, and see what clicks for you.  
Even 5 minutes helps.  
As for journaling, I just brain-dump whatever’s in my head. No filter.  
Then I make it a habit to write a few things I’m grateful for—small and big.  
Coffee that tasted great. News from a friend back home. A brain that’s still functioning just fine.

**2) Lift Heavy Things. Sweat a Little. Repeat.**  
Exercise is free therapy.  
Cardio clears your head. Lifting weights gives you a sense of control.  
And let’s be honest—it doesn’t hurt to look in the mirror and feel strong.  
Mood improves. Sleep improves. Stress goes down.  
Literally zero downsides.

**3) Nature Walks.**   
Yes it sounds like some hippie stuff, but walking in trees changes something.  
I used to think this was woo-woo stuff, until I read about *shinrin-yoku* (Japanese forest bathing).  
Turns out there’s solid science behind it—lower cortisol, improved immune markers, better mood.  
But even if you don’t believe in the science?  
Worst case: you got some steps in. And moving your body = less stress. Always.

1jpe1k0,https://i.redd.it/lm6pkxn32cse1.jpeg,I am looking for a potential buyer for something amazing my boyfriend found,"So about 10 years ago, in Coffee Creek, California,  my boyfriend was digging a hole for a septic system on his property. When he was about 17 feet down into the ground digging this hole, he noticed this rock, it was quite dirty so he just tossed it out of the hole onto the ground. Later on, he picked it back up, cleaned off all the dirt, and couldn't believe his eyes. There staring back at him was this native American, reaching out in distress. Some people say it is Jesus, but we believe it is a native American, they were very prodominent on where his land now is years ago when this was thier land. This rock came out of the ground exactly like this, that means this rock was ran through that dredge and tossed into those rock piles, somehow finding its way to where it was found . There has been no alterations of any kind, just cleaned. The area where this was found used to be a beautiful pasture, but the gold rush brought white men, who dregded the land and made it nothing but huge rock piles, and then created a huge lake and made a big dam, trinity dam.

This is something truly and absolutely amazing, and somehow it found its way into our hands, not too long ago our home burned down completely, a total loss, but for some reason he had a feeling to take it to his mother's house right before the fire, somehow he knew to take it out of there.

My mom had it but I didn’t start experiencing RLS until I started seriously training to run long distances in my early 20s. I understand it’s hereditary so I most likely inherited it. 

I had the ‘Forrest Gump’ experience where I just kept running to see how far I could go which eventually led to running fifteen half marathons in under two years. I started out running 1 then 2 then 3 miles and on and on leading to running 30-55 miles per week. I run 5-6 days per week now. I’ve been running for almost a decade now usually 30-60 miles per week. I’d love to eventually run a marathon and then ultra. Who knows if I can. This information is just for context.

When the symptoms got really bad, I took a break from running but the RLS did not disappear. I wondered if my caffeine intake may be affecting it so on a bad night where I couldn’t sleep and was in tears I decided to quit coffee to see if it helped RLS. It helps me sleep better when I do fall asleep but it doesn’t help the RLS. The only way I can fall asleep when I have symptoms is if I shove my toes from one foot into the bottom of the other foot and lay on my stomach with one arm under my head. 

I’m not sure exactly when RLS appeared but it was when I started consistently training. So curious if any athletes have had similar experiences. 

I was a vegetarian for seven years in my 20s but when my iron levels dropped dramatically and RLS was awful I was put on iron pills. I had RLS before my iron dropped and it just got progressively worse. I was a dropping for years before the weird iron levels dripping. When the iron pills didn’t improve the iron levels, my dr suggested being in an iron iv. My mom died of breast cancer and I didnt want to feel like a cancer patient so I asked if I could try eating meat and increasing high iron vegetables to see if it would raise. I was hoping it would also solve the RLS. It helped my iron levels go back to normal thankfully but it didn’t solve the RLS. I was referred to a neurologist who recommended starting Gabapentin, if that didn’t work then Ropinirole, if that didn’t work an opioid, and if that didn’t work I’d be able to try benzodiazepine. I want to try to get rid of without the use of medication that I may need to take forever.

My mind is a labyrinth, dearest. Just when I think I've made it out alive, it takes me back to the moment when I realized how deeply I'd fallen for you. Back to when I first caught sight of your hands trembling around a cup of coffee, eyes jaded with sleepy tiredness, not gleaming with the mischievous spark that I'd mastered the art of teasing you just so I can bring it out. 

How vividly I remember clenching my fist behind my back, nails digging into my palms, almost breaking skin. 

But the only pain I truly felt was the pain of not being able to reach out, envelop your hands with mine, and never let them go.

Because when I love, I love so selflessly.

I still remember it with deep detestation: the day I first saw you light a cigarette. I remember how my heart sank as I witnessed that cursed death stick suck the life out of your lips.

If only I could pull it out and replace it with my own searing kisses– only a fool like me would dare fight fire with fire!

But rather than smoke, I'd exhale bits of my soul into your body –only the shiniest ones, not the broken ones, not the stained ones–with each sigh of adoration I let out, just so I could keep you in my arms a bit longer. 

Because when I love, I love so selflessly.

Essential Tips for Crafting and Finishing Yard Art Woodworks
------------------------------------------------------------

Creating beautiful yard art woodworks is a fulfilling project that can add charm and personality to your outdoor space. Whether you are a seasoned woodworker or just getting started, it's important to keep some essential tips in mind to enhance the crafting and finishing processes. Below are key insights to help you work effectively and produce stunning yard art pieces.

### Choosing the Right Materials

Start by selecting quality wood. Cedar and redwood are popular choices because they are naturally resistant to moisture and insects, which is crucial for outdoor durability. Plywood can also be useful, especially for intricate designs. Always ensure you choose untreated wood to avoid chemical interactions with any finishes.

### Planning Your Design

Before grabbing your tools, sketch a clear design. This serves as your blueprint, showing dimensions and making the cutting process more manageable. Consider incorporating elements that reflect your personal style or the theme of your garden. Simplicity can be key; sometimes, less is more when creating eye-catching yard art.

### Gathering Essential Tools

- Jigsaw or bandsaw for intricate cuts
- Sawhorses for stability while cutting
- Drill for making holes for eyes, anchors, and embellishments
- Sandpaper for smoothing edges
- Paintbrushes and spray guns for applying finishes

### Cutting with Precision

When it comes to cutting your wood pieces, precision is paramount. Use a sharp blade and take your time to ensure clean cuts. If you are working with intricate designs, start with larger pieces before moving on to the finer details. This helps maintain the integrity of the overall structure as you progress.

### Smoothing and Preparing the Surface

Once your pieces are cut, it’s important to smooth all edges and surfaces. Sanding helps eliminate splinters and prepares the surface for painting or staining. Use a finer grit sandpaper for finishing touches. The smoother the surface, the better your paint or stain will adhere.

### Choosing Finishes Wisely

The right finish enhances the look of your yard art and protects it from the elements. Here are some options:

Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
- **Outdoor Polyurethane:** Great for clear protection without altering wood color.
- **Stains:** These can add color while highlighting the wood grain.
- **Paint:** Use quality outdoor acrylics for vibrant colors that stand out.

Make sure to apply multiple coats, allowing proper drying time between each layer. This will ensure lasting durability.

### Fun Features

Yard art is an excellent opportunity to get creative. You might consider adding motion elements like wind spinners, or interactive features such as bird feeders. Mirrors and colorful glass can also be used for extra flair. The key is to engage the senses and encourage exploration.

### Anchoring Your Art

Once your piece is complete, it’s crucial to secure it properly. Consider the following methods:

- **Concrete bases:** These offer sturdy support for larger structures.
- **Ground stakes:** Use heavy-duty stakes for smaller art pieces.
- **Hanging options:** For pieces that are designed to hang, ensure you use weather-resistant hardware.

### Maintaining Your Yard Art

Regular maintenance will prolong the life of your yard art. Check for signs of wear, such as peeling paint or wood degradation, especially after harsh weather. Touch up paint and finishes as needed to keep your art looking fresh.

Just wanted to see some different perspectives and views?

Even advice or insights. I uploaded this to ai to problem solve and create some boundaries but now I need human insights. I’m not open to leaving our relationship even if the response below sounds dramatic. I just typed out everything I was feeling previously in the moment and included extra information I gave ai.

— So i got upset at my boyfriend yesterday and i feel as if it was due to my excitement being diminished. I ended up crying in front of him for the first time which i never do but i tell him i usually dont talk abt my emotions verbally because ill cry. I usually type them out or something. But we had agreed that i would decorate my side of his car. My seat and he was so down for it and even told his friends about it. When the time comes i got things i thought were cute and started. Just some plushies, a blanket, and a bow lumbar rest and head rest. He said it was too much and overwhelming and okay thats fine i respected that but it still hurt and i removed my decor. He asked me why i took all of it away even though he was okay with some and he asked me why not compromise. I told him that his disapproval of it makes me uncomfortable seeing the items so its okay it i just got rid of the decor. But i cried about it because i was so excited for it and it made me realize how many “boundaries” or things i have to diminish myself for. Like right now his car was given to him from his mom and he said it just felt weird since he used to ride in this car as a kid and i was like ok thats fine i dont have to have any decor in him. Then he said he didnt know if he wanted his car to look more so like mine than his. I asked him why he didnt put any decorations in it and he said he didnt know it just didnt feel like his car or that he didnt get around to it. And i respected that. But it also made me realize how many uncomfortable situations i had to sit through. Like when he was sick i gave him medicine and checked in on him and stuff but when i was sick for spring break i was really upset because i had a week planned out and he did check on me but would say things like “oh ill get you soup” then never did, or would face time me while he was with his friends and be like “you would like this its so cute do you want me to get it. “ I would say “if you want to. “ then he even said he was going to ask for my size and go get it and never ended up getting it. Or one time for Christmas i told him about this one bag and he said he was going to buy it and almost did but because i said it was something i wanted he didnt get it which confused me. In the future he noticed i never bought the bag for myself then he said that i said i dont like when people buy me things im going to get for myself. I NEVER. Said that. He said that and i told him that. I explained to him why would i deny someone getting me something that i WANT. Thats the whole point of lists, etc. I even explained that whatever my family didnt get on my list i went back and bought for myself. But he didnt get me that bag and it was annoying bc he kept asking me what i wanted and when i listed items i guess his idea was to not get my anything i listed and get me something better but he didnt get my something better… he got me like $50 worth of gift which is fine but it was like… trinket stuff. Like a bow keyboard cap, a photo card, and bow earrings which i bought in another color for $12. I spent over $500 for him and focused on things he genuinely liked such has pokemon cards, his perfume, etc. then he tried to make it up for me valentines at got me a matcha basket, something ive been asking for and then right after that he tells me we have been spending too much money for gifts. Like what!! You get me one nice gift and now we’re spending too much money. And our gift giving is just for holidays and now it makes my gift seem ungenuine. I get my gifts bc i know they would like it, but for him it seems to be a cost thing. Like he knew i would like what he saw at the mall but refused to get it. Even times i always surprise him with coffee or snacks but he never ever surprises me with anything. He does get my flowers but now those seem ungeninue. Recently he got me followers and they just screamed “here, damn.” Like no flowers i like, i tell him i love orchids and to just get me those as they are the same price… but still no. I even went out and just made my own orchid bouquet because ive been wanting one since forever. You can really tell a difference between the amount of love i put into my bouquet and then just the flowers he got me on his break… and i know they have better flowers in store but he got me this neon yellow astorias and red ones. That was all in the boquet. I threw them away because it felt so forced and unloved. I even told him i wanted pink flowers…. I gave him the boquet paper. He’s seen the flowers i make for his mom and ive never even received similar from him. And on top of that i have ti deal with his family being slightly racist then he wants me to help him cope woth that. What do you mean you want me to help you cope with your family being racist towards me!!! What!! Stand up to them. We cant even move in together because of them, because hes so set on doing what they say and trying to make both parties happy. But i feel as if he can be doing extra to make me happy outside of that. Like maybe listeningto what flowers i want. Getting me gifts i actually ask for, etc. i remember i even asked him to text me more and hes like okay and never does it and this has been a problem for a while where he goes like 24 hrs without speaking to me. We work together so i see him but then hes ghost on his days off. He said he’d even send good morning texts. He does it for two days max and then nothing but when he asks me to change something i do. Like i used to just ignore him when im upset and now i talk it out with him even if it means ill cry. Then for our dates… which we rarely have we end up splitting in some way which is fine but its bothersone seeing other girls never have to pay for dates or have men who genuinely want to pay. Like we will have a date maybe 1 or 2 times a month. If we go to maybe 2 or 3 places in one day im expected to pay for one or i at least offer to be generous. Sometimes he will even ask me to split but heres the gag, he doesnt pay any rent, or bills and lives at home w his parents and makes 3.5 monthly just about! I pay rent and all my bills and his cat is living with me so its frustrating to see that he cant do anything! He cant either one pay for our dates, or two get me things that j get for him. And i feel like im not even asking for both, but at least one would be nice to counteract his parents behavior or the emotions i feel from it. Even from him not holding up his part and not ghosting me like he says he wouldnt. But i ended up blocking him and disabling my notifications bc i dont want to contact him at all right now. And i feel like bc im off for the next 3 days and dont have to see him, he can stay blocked. I dont even know what im going to tell him because this is a lot

ADDON - Also another detail is that he thinks its okay to let his family control his like just because “they’re asian.” Or “thats how asian families are.” But they control him in so many ways even to making him possibly quit his job or them being okay him him moving him with his friends but not okay with him moving in with me. And maybe that influences some of his decision making but even so we cant even have sleep overs for too long without them wanting him to come home just because they want his presence in the house. They dont even need him for anything. But also note that he is buying a house now so he cant rent, so mentioned that because i know his excuse will be exactly that. Keep in mind we planned to move in together in November when he wasnt buying a house so things were different then

ADDON - Oh and then when i get him thoughtful gifts for his family. Sometimes hes like oh that will be too much or thats doing to much. Like for valentines day i wanted to get his sister a gift and he was like oh no thats too much. And i was excited bc his sister is reslly sweet. I still got her a gift which was flowers and his mom loved it for her

ADDON - Even if this is a hard thing for him to change bc i know his parents weight heavily on his emotions too bc they were kind of abusive, let him know that he can be more engaged or supporting outside of that such as loving me similarly to how i love him. Rather than me dealing with his family but now also having to pile on everything else.

ADDON - You know whats even crazier. I like the point where you mention “what if i mess up again.” (Ai suggested this perspective) Because he did mention before that he used to love planning cheesy picnic dates, etc, and even got upset when his ex was the one not communicating or texting him enough. And maybe we just dont have the time because we work everyday day of the week except Tuesday and thursday but we have class those days so maybe its stress or overwhelming

TL;DR: I’ve been feeling emotionally drained in my relationship. I put in a lot of effort by planning thoughtful gifts, expressing love in small ways, supporting my boyfriend through tough moments, and trying to build a real future together. But I keep feeling like I have to shrink myself. He dismisses or downplays my efforts, does not follow through on things he says, and lets his family’s bias affect our relationship. For example, they are okay with him living with a friend but not with me. I know he is dealing with pressure from his family and a stressful schedule, but I just want him to be more emotionally present, thoughtful, and supportive in the ways I try to be for him.

I’m a huge nerd, an introvert, a data analyst, a poet, and a stoner. I’m neurodivergent and mindful of my mental health. I love books, cozy video games, learning new things, baking, crafting, and watching tv. I have a cat and I love being cozy. I have a good collection of stuffed animals and love to spend my weekends reading in a blanket fort. I love to talk about science, literature, tech, and deep conversations. I’m a swiftie and like a lot of other pop artists. I love going to concerts, museums, and art exhibits. I take my coffee cold, iced vanilla oat milk latte is my go-to order. I’m focused on community and love taking care of others. My love languages are gift giving and acts of service. I’m the kind of lover that will give you random gifts because something reminded me of you, that learns how to make you as comfortable as possible, someone you can talk to about anything, and someone who will hop up to help you as soon as I can.

I’ve decided to come on here to see if I can meet another poly femme with similar interests to connect with. I like to start as friends and see where things go naturally. While I’ve been on a bunch of first dates, I’ve never dated another woman and I’d love to change that. I’ve loved women and am attracted to them, so this isn’t just me experimenting or anything.

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

Literally second guessing the path I'm on in life. 

Distract me. Recommend me a song or show or movie. Tell me a story. 

Full disclosure I'm not looking for anything flirty. Just a conversation that may or may not last past when I eventually fall asleep tonight. 

About me. My 30th bday party was shrek themed. I like rollerblading down by the lake. My perfect day would include coffee, a farmers market, and a book store. I like cheesecake. Love baking but hate eating most sweets. I like to lift weights. I'm terrible at watching movies. In the last 10 years I've watched shrek 1, shrek 2, the Mario movie, school of rock, nacho libre. In case it's not obvious I like Jack Black. I like charcuterie boards but I'm lactose intolerant. I suck at drinking water. I use to play piano and guitar. I have a stupid tramp stamp on my back I got at 17. I ironically started listening to creed but now I like creed. I don't have a favorite color.

1jpdom9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jpdom9/i_keep_dreaming_of_a_graveyard_that_doesnt_exist/,I keep dreaming of a graveyard that doesn’t exist.,"Two weeks ago, I saw her again—the girl I don’t remember, but who knows me too well.



I was walking down a street in my grandmother’s village. There was a girl walking beside me—blue dress, orange hair. 

I can't clearly remember her face. We walked past the park and headed down a road lined with trees on both sides. 

A couple of minutes later, we arrived at a graveyard surrounded by stone walls. They were a little taller than me and had some kind of engravings on them.



We stepped inside, and it looked like a normal graveyard filled with old headstones. The girl didn’t speak, and I didn’t feel like I needed to either. 

I wasn’t scared—if anything, it felt peaceful. Familiar.



Then I woke up.



It was an interesting dream, but nothing too strange. I didn’t think much of it—until two days later, during lunch at work. 

A random thought hit me: that graveyard felt real. Not just real… familiar. But I couldn’t place it. I’d been visiting my grandmother’s village every summer until I was fifteen. 

I thought maybe it was a memory. I checked the area on the map—zoomed around every corner of that place, looking for it.



Nothing.



Maybe the map data was outdated. That happens, right? Some old places don’t show up. I couldn’t stop thinking about it, though. So I decided to take a couple days off and visit my grandma.



That evening, I packed a bag and drove down. It’s only two hours away—easy. I got there around 9 PM. Grandma was surprised but happy to see me. We sat down, drank tea, caught up.



I didn’t tell her the real reason I came. That night, I had the dream again. It was almost exactly the same—except this time, I remembered her face.



Bright blue eyes. Orange hair. A small scar on her nose. Pale skin with freckles.



She felt familiar. But also like someone I didn’t know.



I woke up with a strange, distressed feeling. Grandma was already up—noises coming from downstairs and the smell of something amazing. I ate breakfast, and she poured us coffee. We sat down, and I asked:



“Grandma, I want to visit the graveyard.”



“Sure. Why do you want to go?”



“I want to visit Grandfather.”



“Oh, I get it, son. When do you want to go?”



“Right after this coffee, Grandma.”



“Alright. As you want.”



I finished my coffee and left the house. As I got closer to the street from my dream, I realized—it was exactly the same. The park was there. The buildings were in place. Everything matched.



I entered the tree-lined road and kept walking.



But when I reached the spot where the graveyard should’ve been—there were only trees. Just forest. I kept walking. Nothing. I felt weird—scared, confused.



On the way back, I saw an old friend walking. At first, he didn’t notice me, but I called out:



“Henry!”



He looked over, surprised, and walked toward me. He smiled, hugged me, and asked:



“Taylor! What brings you here?”



“I’m visiting Grandma.”



“Oh, nice! Good to see you after all these years.”



“Thanks, nice to see you too.”



“Where are you coming from?”



“I was trying to visit Grandfather’s grave, but… I guess I forgot where the graveyard was.”



“Let me take you there—we can catch up on the way.”



“Sure, let’s go.”



We walked for ten minutes. He led me to the graveyard. It was in a place I didn’t remember at all. I paid my respects at Grandfather’s grave, then said goodbye to Henry and returned home.



Grandma brought out a large photo album that evening. Old, worn leather cover—full of childhood pictures.



“Oh, Grandma, this again?”



“Come on, son. You know I love these. Let’s take a look.”



I sat beside her as she flipped through the pages. Photos of me as a child, with my parents, uncles, cousins. Then something caught my eye.



“Grandma—wait a second.”



I pointed to a photo.



“Who are those kids?”



In the picture: a little boy with dirt on his clothes and face. A shy-looking girl beside him—orange hair,her face just slightly blurry.



Grandma laughed.



“Oh, come on. You don’t recognize her?”



I squinted. No recognition at all.



“No, Grandma.”



She smiled. “That’s you and Juliana.”



Me? Juliana?



I felt something twist in my stomach. I didn’t remember her. I got curious and asked:



“Grandma… I really don’t remember. Who was she?”



“What do you mean you don’t remember? She was your best friend when you were little. You two were inseparable—little lovers.”



“Oh, Grandma, don’t start.”



“You remember Emma, right? Or Parry? That silly girl Mandy?”



“Okay, okay. Enough. I’m going to bed. Goodnight, Grandma.”



“Oh, don’t run off, Taylor! We haven’t even gotten to the other girls!”



I went up to my room and fell asleep.



That night, I dreamed again.



Same walk. Same girl. Same graveyard.



But this time… her face wasn’t clear again.



And the gravestones?



They had names on them: Mandy. Emma. Parry. Three more I didn’t recognize. All names I’d known from childhood… people I’d loved or been close to.



Juliana’s name was missing.



The dream ended, like before. I woke up. I was in shock. What I’d seen scared me. I stayed in bed for almost an hour, staring at the ceiling.



Eventually, I got up. Took a shower. Went downstairs.



Grandma wasn’t in the house.



Panic twisted through me. I ran outside, calling for her.



A voice came from the garden. She was tending flowers.



Relieved, I went back inside. While she was in the garden, I pulled out the photo album and flipped to that same picture.



The girl’s face was clear now.



I stared, frozen. My hands trembled.



She felt familiar in a way that made no sense.



Then the door creaked.



It was Grandma, carrying a few tomatoes and vegetables. She saw me and smiled.



“Oh, you’re looking at the photos?”



“Yeah… Grandma, can you come here a second?”



She walked over.



“Sure, what is it?”



“Wasn’t this girl’s face unclear yesterday?”



She looked at the photo, then at me.



“Yeah… it still is.”



“Still? What do you mean?”



I took the photo again. When I looked—her face was blurry. Just like before.



I dropped the picture and ran upstairs. Grandma called after me.



I lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling. My mind racing.



What was that? I swear I saw her face.



What’s happening to me?



Who is that girl?



Why can’t I remember?



Is she the girl from my dreams?



I don’t know what to do.



I stayed in my room for hours until Grandma came and got me out. I went downstairs, and we sat down. She began to speak.



""Listen son, I know you’re embarrassed about your childhood girlfriends, but it’s okay.""



Hearing that—Grandma still doesn’t realize anything—I got mad. I got up, walked toward the door, and said to my grandma,



""I’m going for a walk. I need some air.""



I got out of the house and walked a little, but I didn’t know where to go. I was already scared out of my mind. I walked toward the park. In front of it were a couple of teens hanging out. I walked near them and said,



""Hi kids, can I join?""



""Sure man, come sit,"" one of them said. Three of them were sitting, all looking normal. One was eating chips and the other two were drinking some beverage. As I sat down, one asked,



""You’re not from here, are you?""



""Actually no, my grandma lives here, just at the end of the street.""



""Oh, are you Ms. Susan’s grandson?""



""Yeah, do you know my grandma?""



""Not much, but we know people in this village. You’re Taylor, right? My sister used to talk about you.""



""Your sister—who is she?""



""Juliana,"" he said. As I heard it, I stared blankly at his face. His hair was orange. Was he the brother of that girl I don’t remember? I was scared and reluctantly asked him, afraid of what he might say.



""Which Juliana? The one with orange hair?""



""Yeah, there isn’t any Juliana in this village besides my sister.""



""She’s in the village right now?""



""Yeah, she’s at home. Why are you asking?""



""Nothing, just asking. Anyway, I need to go. Have a good night.""



""Yeah, you too, man.""



I immediately got up and walked back home. As soon as I arrived, I wanted to ask Grandma about it, but she was already asleep. 

I didn’t want to wake her up, so I went upstairs and headed to bed, scared to sleep. It took me hours to fall asleep. I kept turning and turning in bed. When I woke up, I felt relieved.



That’s all I remember. It’s been a week since I returned from my trip to the village—at least, that’s what my friends say. I’m too scared to return there, or even talk with my grandma. 

I don’t know what happened. I don’t know what is real or not. Did I dream those things? Did they happen? Am I going crazy? Am I experiencing something otherworldly? I don’t know.



But every night, I dream of her. Of that place. Of the grave I never found.



I don’t know what’s real anymore.



Only that she’s still there. Waiting.



And that I’ll see her again tonight.

1jpdoim,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jpdoim/the_last_voyage_of_the_horven/,The last voyage of The Horven.,"We know more about space than we do about the depths of our own ocean, at least that's what they say. I'm not sure who “they” are, or if there is even any truth to it. What I do know, is that what we found down there doesn't belong here. What I have seen, can never be unseen. It has changed me... forever. 

 

The salty cold spray splashed against my face as we pulled the cage over to the dump area.  A mix of The Dropkick Murphys, ACDC and Metallica blared from the deck mounted speakers as the rigging groaned under the weight of the haul. The cage, once in position, was flipped and opened, dumping 300lbs of Alaskan king crab onto the sorting table.  

“Get sorting greenhorn!” Yelled Cobb, the deck boss. Cobb was a big man in his early 40s, he was built like a linebacker and had the disposition of an irritable grizzly. Apart from the captain, he was the oldest, most experienced crabber on the ship. 

I nodded and stepped up to the table to begin digging through the mass of bright red legs and claws. Jimbo, a short wiry man and the only other deckhand on the ship, joined in and we began sorting by size and sex. The females and the undersized crabs are separated to be released back into the sea, while the legal-size males are dropped down a chute to the live well below the deck, where they would be stored until we returned to port.  

Being a crabber was never something I planned on doing. After graduating high school and disappointing my parents by refusing to go to law school like they had always planned, I decided to go traveling. I bummed my way around my home state of Texas for a while before making my way north, and then even farther north. I had originally come to Alaska with a friend who had promised me a career in the oil business. Unfortunately, that had fallen through, as most of his plans did. I found myself broke, jobless, and homeless in a cold and unforgiving climate. I could have called my parents for help, but my pride wouldn't allow it. I had set out to make it on my own and that is exactly what I would do it. I spent the summer working odd jobs here and there but never found anything stable. I was wiping tables at a bar in Unalaska when I met Captain Larsson.  

“You like working here?” He asked as he watched me prepare to clean up a puddle of vomit on the bar floor. His voice was deep and carried a hint of a Scandanavian accent. 

I looked up at him and shrugged, “Not really, but I need the money.” 

He was a tall man with broad shoulders, I guessed he was maybe late 40s to mid 50s. He had a head of shaggy blonde hair streaked with gray and a short beard to match. He nodded, “You look like you can handle hard work” He said looking me over, “I happen to be in need of a deckhand. Ever thought of being a fisherman?” 

I shook my head, “No, but I never planned on doing this either. How's the pay?” 

“Better than you’ll make here.” He said, glancing around the bar room. His eyes fell to the vomit on the floor, “And you won't have to clean any more of that, unless you make it yourself.” 

“Where do I sign up?” I asked.   

He smiled, “Come to the harbor tomorrow morning, we’ll get you sorted.” He finished his beer and headed for the door. 

“Wait.” I called after him, “Which ship is it?” 

With a slight glance back over his shoulder he called back, “The Horven.” 

Weird fucking name. I thought. 

 

“Wake up kid.” Said Jimbo, giving me a shove. “We got 50 more pots to haul in, no time for daydreaming.” 

I nodded and went back to work. The rest of the day went on the same as usual, haul in the pot, dump the catch, sort the crab, stow the pot. Captain Larsson was right; it was hard work, repetitive hard work, and damn was it cold. After four weeks at sea, you’d think I'd be used to the cold. But my warm Texas blood refused to acclimate to the frigid climate. 

“Incoming.” Yelled Cobb. 

The pot was pulled up the side of the ship and swung over to the dumping area. 

“Looks like we got a hitchhiker.” Said Jimbo, as he looked over the pot. 

“A hitchhiker?” I asked, trying to see what he was talking about. 

As the pot was spun, in preparation for dumping the haul, I saw what he was referring to. Clinging to the side of the pot, its tentacles in a writhing mass, was a giant pacific octopus. Hauling up an octopus wasn't exactly uncommon, but they were usually caught inside the crab pots. I hadn't heard of one riding a pot up on the outside, but there it was. It had an unusual color to it as well. I mean, everyone knows that an octopus can change its color, but this seemed different. It was a sickly gray color with odd purple veinlike designs covering its body.  As we approached the pot, I noticed something else. There was something clutched in the grip of the tentacles. 

“What the hell kind of octopus is that?” Asked Jimbo. 

“Biggest one I've seen.” Said Cobb. “Greenhorn, pull it loose and toss it overboard.” 

I nodded and stepped forward, “Hey guys, its holding onto something.” 

“Yeah, the cage.” said Jimbo, “Come on Evans, just get it done.” 

I reached out, preparing to pry the odd colored octopus from the pot. Suddenly it let go and dropped to the deck at my feet. I leapt back in surprise, causing the others to burst into laughter.  

“Shit, I got it.” I said, as I reached down for the limp creature. 

“Is it dead?” Asked Jimbo as he stepped over to look down at it. 

“It doesn't matter.” said Cobb, “Just toss it over already.”  

I tried to lift the huge octopus but kept losing my grip. The thing had to weigh a hundred pounds or more, and its limp slimy texture made it almost impossible to handle. 

“Move over.” Said Cobb, as he bent and hefted the limp creature over his shoulder, “Fucking greenhorn.”  

As he carried the octopus to the starboard edge of the deck, it dropped what it had been holding on to. I walked over and picked up the object, looking it over. It was a large egg-shaped stone, cracked open down the center. I turned it over in my hands, it was lighter than it looked. As I investigated the crack, I noticed it was hollow with jagged purple crystals within it. The crystals seemed to glow with an inner light, a soft, beautiful light. 

“AHH! HELP!” Yelled Cobb. 

I looked up to see the octopus’ tentacles wrapped around Cobb’s torso, its head bobbing around on his shoulder Jimbo and I rushed over and began trying to pull the tentacles free. 

“GET THIS FUCKING THING OFF!” Yelled Cobb, “ITS BITING ME!” 

We tried and tried but we didn't have enough hands, every time we got one tentacle free another took its place. Luckily the captain and Ramirez, the ship’s engineer, had seen the commotion and came running. With their help we managed to pull the creature off of Cobb and tossed it overboard. 

“Ahh!” Groaned Cobb, holding his shoulder.  

Captain Larsson rushed over to him and pulled his coat aside to inspect the wound. There were two large gouges, where the beak had taken out chunks of flesh. 

“Ramirez, Jimbo, get him inside and patch him up.” He turned to look down at the stone as it rolled across the deck. His brow furrowed as he studied it, “Evans, toss that thing overboard.” He said pointing to the stone. 

“What? Why?” I asked. 

The captain gave me a stern, uncompromising glare, “Do as I say, now.” 

I nodded, “Yes, sir.”  

The captain returned to the wheelhouse as the others helped Cobb inside. I walked across the deck and picked up the stone. When I had seen that it was full of crystals, I thought that it might be worth something. Me being broke, I could have used all the extra cash I could get. I glanced up to the wheelhouse and saw the captain watching me, so I made my way over and hesitantly tossed the stone back into the ocean. As I did, I looked back to the wheelhouse, the captain gave me a nod of appreciation. With a slight hesitation, I nodded back. With nothing else to do on the deck, I decided to head inside and see how Cobb was doing. 

“I'm fine.” Said Cobb as Ramirez packed his wound with gauze. 

“I know that.” Said Ramirez, pushing his glasses up on his nose. “But I still want you to stay inside and rest. I can help the boys finish up the haul for the day.” 

Cobb sighed and shook his head, “It's really nothing, the damn thing surprised me more than anything.” 

“No kidding.” Said Jimbo, “I mean, I know they can bite, but who ever heard of an octopus attacking someone like that?” 

Ramirez nodded, “It can happen, usually only if they are threatened. What did you do to it?” 

“No idea?” Said Cobb, “I thought it was dead, one minute it was completely limp. Next thing I know, the thing is squeezing the hell out of me and trying to gnaw my arm off.” 

Ramirez shrugged, “Well, whatever set it off, it took a serious bite out of you, my friend. But you're patched up for now.” 

Cobb started to get up from his seat at the dining table, “Alright, let's get back to it.” 

“No.” Said Ramirez, “We got this, you take it easy for now.” 

Cobb looked from Ramirez to Jimbo, then to me, “What do you say greenhorn? Can you try not to be a fuck up for once?” 

I sighed and nodded, “Yeah, Cobb. I can handle it.” 

“I’ll keep an eye on him.” Said Jimbo. “You just rest that arm.” 

And with that, Jimbo, Ramirez and I headed back out to the deck to continue hauling in the few remaining pots. A few hours later, after the last pot was stowed and the others went inside to the bunkroom to check on Cobb, I decided to head to the wheelhouse. 

 Captain Larsson glanced at me from behind the control panel as I opened the door. He took a puff on his long-stemmed pipe, filling the wheelhouse with the aromatic smoke.  

“Storms coming.” He said, looking back out the front facing window.  

I removed my hood and took a steadying breath, “Captain, I...” I paused. 

“What's on your mind Evans?” He asked, still looking out the window. 

I cleared my throat, “The stone, I was wondering why it bothered you so much? You took one look at it and...” I trailed off, feeling foolish for even bringing it up. 

“I've been a fisherman in one form or another for going on thirty-five years. I've never been married, never had any children, at least that I know of.” he grinned and winked at me. “I've had good seasons and bad seasons. I've seen good men die young and bastards live to old age. I've lost friends and found new ones. And I've done it all out here, on the water. The sea is all I've ever known, and its likely I'll die out here one day. Through it all, there's only one thing I've ever truly trusted.” He turned to face me, “Instinct. A captain has to know when it's time to turn the ship around to avoid a storm, or when to go for one more haul. A captain must trust his instincts, his gut feeling. Because when it's all said and done, it all rests on his shoulders. Do you understand?” 

I nodded but didn't speak. 

“When I looked at that thing,” Said the Captain, “I felt a deep and powerful dread come over me. I don't know what it is or where it came from, but I tell you now boy, there's an evil about it.” 

Thunder rumbled in the distance. 

Just then, the wheelhouse door opened, and Ramirez came in. He was a heavy-set man with a kind face. 

“How's Cobb?” Asked the captain. 

“He’s sleeping.” Said Ramirez, “I was going to change his bandage, but I figured I'd just let him rest.” 

Captain Larsson nodded, “Fine, just make sure you change it first thing in the morning.” 

Ramirez nodded, “Will do.” He turned to me and smiled, “You did good today greenhorn.” 

“Thanks, I'm trying to pull my weight.” I said. 

“You're doing just fine, Cobb only picks on you ‘cause you're new. Next season you’ll be best friends.” Said Ramirez, as he slapped shoulder.  

“If he doesn't kill you first.” said Captain Larsson. 

Ramirez and I laughed. 

After another ten to fifteen minutes of small talk about the season, and what we would be doing when we got back to port, I was getting pretty tired. I told the two of them goodnight and headed for my bunk.  

The bunk room on The Horven was a small, cramped space, consisting of three sets of bunk beds along one wall. Cobb, who usually sleeps on the bunk above Jimbo, had lay down on the spare bunk and was out cold. Jimbo was snoring loudly from his usual spot, which would normally bother me. Tonight however, I was exhausted. Nothing would be keeping me up, or so I thought. As I lay down in my bunk, I heard the boom of thunder in the distance. I listened to the storm in the distance, growing closer and closer. Eventually the rocking of the waves lulled me to sleep, despite the booming thunder, and Jimbos snoring. 

Suddenly I was jarred awake by a heavy metallic thump. I looked at the clock on the wall, it was nearly 1:00, I had only been asleep for about an hour. I climbed out of my bunk and switched on the light to see Cobb lying in the floor, his body shaking violently. 

“Shit! Ramirez, Jimbo, somethings wrong with Cobb!” I shouted shaking them both awake. 

Ramirez jumped out of bed and rushed over, “Fuck!” he exclaimed, “Looks like he's having a seizure.” 

“What's going on?” Asked Jimbo as he sat up in his bunk, rubbing his eyes. 

“Cobbs having a seizure. Go get the captain.” Said Ramirez, “Evans, help me move him.” 

“Oh shit. Okay I'm on it.” Said Jimbo jumping up and rushing to the door. 

I knelt down next to Ramirez, “What do I do?” I asked. 

“Help me move him onto side and grab his pillow. Shit, he’s burning up.” 

After we carefully rolled Cobb onto his side, Ramirez slid the pillow under his head and raised his chin. Cobb continued to seize for around a minute before falling limp. 

“Is he dead?” Jimbo asked from the doorway. 

The captain pushed him aside and knelt down beside Ramirez. 

“No.” Said Ramirez, “He’s unconscious.” 

“Should we move him?” I asked. 

The captain shook his head, “Let's give him a couple minutes, make sure the seizures are over.” 

We all sat in silence for the next few minutes. I think we all hoped that Cobb would just wake up and be fine, but that didn't happen. 

“Okay.” said Ramirez, “I think he's done. Let's get him into his bunk.” 

After lifting Cobb’s limp body into his bunk, Ramirez bent down and examined the wound on his shoulder. 

“Oh shit.” he said, after removing the bandages. 

“What is it?” asked the captain. 

Ramirez stepped back from Cobb's bunk, revealing the wound. The flesh around the bite mark was swollen and discolored. There were dark lines running out in all directions from the wound, which seeped a dark oily substance. 

“My god.” Muttered Jimbo, “Is he gonna be alright?” 

Ramirez shrugged, “Its clearly some kind of infection, but I haven't seen anything like it before.” He turned to the captain. “We need to get him back to port. All we have out here is ibuprofen, he needs a doctor, antibiotics. He needs more than I can do.”  

Ramirez ran his hands through his hair, clearly stressed. Aside from being the engineer, he was the ship medic as well. He took his responsibility of taking care of the ship and the crew very seriously. 

The captain put a hand on his shoulder, “I know you're doing what you can, I can't ask for more than that.”  

Ramirez nodded, “Yes sir.” 

The captain turned to Jimbo and me, “Evans, you stay here with Ramirez and Cobb. Jimbo, to the wheelhouse with me. We’re headed for Dutch Harbor, and I need coffee.”  

And with that Jimbo and the captain left. Ramirez and I sat there in silence for several minutes. Cobb's breathing grew labored as the ship rocked back and forth. Ramirez bent over Cobb and pulled open his mouth. 

“What are you looking for?” I asked. 

He turned to me, “I'm checking to make sure his airway is clear.” 

“I thought swallowing your tongue during a seizure was a myth.” I said. 

“It is, but he could still be choked if he...” Ramirez trailed off. 

“What?” I asked.  

He glanced at me, “Somethings wrong with his tongue.” 

“I thought you just said...” 

“Just shut up and come look at this.” Ramirez said interrupting me. 

I stepped over and looked into Cobb's mouth. Something was definitely wrong. Cobb's tongue was swollen and covered in lines, like scars. 

“What the hell?” I asked, “Were those there before?” 

Ramirez Shook his head, “No, I don't know what this is. The lines are too symmetrical.” 

He was right, the lines ran from the back of Cobbs mouth down to a central point on the tip of his tongue. And his breath, Jesus it was horrible, like rotting fish. 

“Ramirez.” The captains voice called over the intercom, startling us both. “I need you in the wheelhouse.” 

Ramirez looked at me, “Are you good here?”  

I nodded, “Yeah, I think so.” 

“If anything changes, anything at all, you come find me.”  

“Right, I got it.” I said, trying to sound confident. 

Ramirez patted my shoulder and left the bunkroom, leaving me alone with Cobb. The next half hour was pretty uneventful. Cobb slept, his breathing ragged and labored. I sat on the bunk next to him, waiting for someone to come and tell me what was happening. I was beginning to get bored when all of a sudden, Cobb started choking violently. I jumped to my feet and leaned over him, not knowing what to do. He coughed and sputtered, dark saliva flying from his lips.  

“Cobb, Cobb!” I shouted, “Fuck, I'm going to get Ramirez. Just hang on man, he’ll know wat to do.” 

I ran out of the bunkroom and up to the wheelhouse, my heart pounding in my chest. 

“Ramirez!” I shouted as I flung open the door. But he wasn't there. 

“What's wrong?” Asked the captain. 

“It's Cobb! He’s coughing and choking, I don’t know what to do!” I said, my breath coming hard. 

“Shit.” Said the captain before turning to the intercom, “Ramirez, get back to the bunkroom now, Cobb needs help.” 

“Where are they? What's going on?” I asked. 

He turned back to face me, a worried look on his face, “Engine room, something's wrong with the ship. The engine has power, but she won't move. We’re dead in the water.” 

“What do we do?” I asked. 

The captain stood up and threw on his coat, “I’ll head down to the engine room and see what I can do. You head back to the bunkroom; Ramirez may need help.” 

I nodded and we both left the wheelhouse. This whole situation was wrong. Of course, accidents happen. People get hurt or sick, the ship has problems, but... this was something else. I could feel it, like the captain said, instinct. 

I entered the bunkroom to find Ramirez, alone. 

“Where's Cobb?” I asked. 

Ramirez whirled around, “Jesus, Evans. You scared the hell out of me.” He shook his head, “I could ask you the same thing, what happened?” 

“He was here when I went to find you. He started choking on something. I didn't know what to do, there was some stuff he was spitting up, dark stuff.” 

“What kind of dark stuff? Was it blood?” Ramirez asked. 

I shrugged, “I don't know. I don't think so.” I thought for a second, “I think it was black, and had chunks in it or something.” 

Ramirez studied me for a moment, “Whatever it was, we need to find him. He has a fever; he could be delirious.” 

I nodded and we left to tell the captain and Jimbo what was happening. 

 

“Gone?” Jimbo asked, “What do you mean gone? Where could he go?” 

“We’ll find him.” Said Captain Larsson, “Ramirez, you and Jimbo stay here, get my ship moving. Evans and I will search the ship and find Cobb. One of us will come get you when we do.” 

We all agreed, and the captain and I set out to search for our missing crew mate.  

We swept the upper and lower deck, the wheelhouse, the latrine, the dining area and back to the bunkroom. The Horven wasn't a large ship, but still there was no sign of Cobb anywhere. 

“Could he have fallen overboard?” I had to shout the question over the raging storm.  

We had gone back out to check the decks again, thinking that maybe we had missed him among the nearly 200 crab pots. 

“If he has, then he's lost. We’ll make a few more passes before we start thinking that though.” The captain shouted back. 

We started to make our way back inside, when I noticed something. The chute that we used to drop the crab down to the holding tank had a cover on it that usually stays closed when not in use. The cover was pushed to the side, leaving a gaping portal down into the tank. 

“Wait.” I called out, “Captain the hold.” 

The captain turned to see what I had seen. 

“Shit!” He exclaimed, “If he fell down there, he could be seriously injured.” 

We rushed over to the controls for the holding tank's large hydraulic door. The door groaned as it opened. The deck lighting illuminated the inside of the tank as the door opened wider and wider. I feared I would see Cobb's limp and broken body in the tank, being feasted on by thousands of large hungry crabs. But... I was only half right. Cobb was there, his flesh ripped and bleeding from the pinchers and claws of the large crustaceans, but he was still alive. He turned to look up at us, a large crab shell in his hands, his mouth was ragged and torn as he chewed the shell along with the meat.  

“What the fuck?” I exclaimed, stepping back from the door. 

The captain stood his ground, “Mr. Cobb, I need you to come with me. You aren't well.” 

He just stared back, unblinking as the freezing rain pelted his face. Dark blood flowing from dozens of open wounds. All the while, continuing to chew. 

“Cobb!” Shouted the captain, “Get the hell out here now!” He leaned over to me, “Go get Ramirez. Tell him to bring some rope.” 

“Rope?” I asked. 

Captain Larsson met my eyes, “I’ll not have this man loose on my ship.” 

“You think he's dangerous?” I asked. 

“Cobb was dangerous before he went mad. Now, I don't know what to think.” 

I nodded, “Yes sir.” and rushed off to get Ramirez. 

As I ran, I kept seeing Cobbs's face in my head. His face... it just looked wrong, like it didn't fit right anymore. What the hell was happening to him? I didn't think an octopus could even hurt a person, let alone give them some kind of infection. Whatever was happening, I would not be returning for another season on this ship. 

I entered the engine room to see Ramirez scratching his head. 

“We have power, I don't understand what's happening.” He said pacing back and forth. 

“Ramirez.” I called, “We found him.” 

After explaining how we had found Cobb and the state he was in, Ramírez's face went pale, “Madre de Dios.” He muttered. 

Jimbo tried to smile, “You’re joking right? You have to be joking.” 

His smile fell away when he saw the look on my face.  

“Theres more.” I said, “The captain said to bring some rope, he thinks Cobb may be a threat.” 

“What kind of threat?” asked Jimbo. 

I shrugged, “I don't know, but I think he's right.” 

Ramirez nodded, “I agree. If not to us, he’s clearly a danger to himself.” 

And with that the three of us left the engine room and headed for the deck. Ramirez found a large coil of thick nylon rope on the way. It was clear to see that the two of them didn't like the idea of tying up their friend, but what choice did we have? Something was very wrong with Cobb's mind. 

When we stepped out onto the deck, we saw no sign of the captain. We approached the holding tank door, still standing wide open, afraid of what we might find inside. But, apart from a half-eaten crab on the deck, there was no sign of Cobb either. 

“Where are they?” Asked Jimbo. 

“I don't know, dammit! They were both right here!” I shouted in frustration. 

Ramirez put up his hands in a calming motion “We will find them. Let's just stick together and search the ship.” 

We did exactly that, we scoured every inch of the ship and dammit there was no sign of either of them. After the search, the three of us sat down in the wheelhouse. Jimbo had his head in his hands. Ramirez just sat there silently, lost in thought. 

“Guys?” I said breaking the silence, “What do we do?” 

Jimbo took a breath and shook his head, “I don't know man, the captains gone, Cobbs gone. I don't know what's happening, but they are gone. I just want to go home.” 

“Look we don't know if they are gone, maybe we search again?” I suggested. 

“Wake the fuck up man!” Jimbo shouted, “They're gone. Something happened to them, and I don't want it to happen to me!” There were tears in his eyes. “They were my friends, but I won't die out here!” 

Ramirez stood up, “Okay, that's enough!”  

With the captain and Cobb both gone, Ramirez was next in command. Not that Jimbo and I were much to command. “Look, I think you are both right. Evans, I want to find them too. I care a lot about both of them, but I think Jimbo is right, something isn't right here.” He thought for another moment then said, “Whatever happens, the ship still needs fixed, so that's what I'm gonna do. Jimbo, I want you on get on the radio and call for help. We are pretty far out here and I'm not sure we will be able to reach anyone, but we have to try.” He turned to me, “Evans, search the ship for the others. It's possible they fell overboard, but if they are here, find them.”  

I nodded, “If they're here, I'll find them.” 

“And I’ll get to work trying to reach someone on the radio.” Said Jimbo, taking up position at the radio. 

“Alright.” Said Ramirez, “I’ll head below and see if I can figure out what's going on with the ship.” 

With the others tending to their duties, I headed off to search the ship yet again. Only this time, I didn't get far before the shit really hit the fan. 

 

I had just finished checking the dining area and latrine again and was about to head into the bunkroom when I heard Jimbo's voice over the ship intercom. 

“Evans, there's someone on the upper deck.”  

Finally, I thought. I had begun to fear that the missing men had fallen overboard, maybe our luck was turning.  

I stepped onto the deck and peered through the pouring rain, but I couldn't see anyone. I turned back to face the wheelhouse where I could see Jimbo looking out at me. I gave him a shrug. 

“He was at the bow, all the way out. I can't see him now.” said Jimbo, his voice tinny over the intercom. 

I wanted to ask him who was at the bow, I found myself hoping it was the captain and not Cobb. But I figured that at that distance he wouldn't be able to tell anyway. I made my way down the narrow path between the stacks of crab pots to the end of the bow, and still, I didn't see anyone. 

“Shit! Evans, He’s on top of the pots.” Jimbo sounded panicked.  

I looked up just in time to see someone jump across the pots overhead. Whoever it was they were damn fast. I began to feel less like a man searching for his friends and more like prey being stalked by some unknown predator. I turned and started back towards the wheelhouse. 

“Evans!” Jimbo's voice was growing more panicked, “Jesus, he’s...” His vice cut off abruptly.  

The nearest intercom speaker had gone silent, I could still hear Jimbo's voice coming from the speaker further up the deck, but with the storm raging around me I couldn't make it out. 

“Jimbo!” I shouted, fear taking hold of me. 

I ran for the wheelhouse, hearing the rattle of the crab pots above me as the unseen person pursued me. My heart pounded harder and harder with each step. Suddenly, I lost my footing and slipped. The cold hard floor of the ships deck rushed up to meet me. I tried to catch myself, but my hands slid forward on the slick metal. My chin slammed into the floor, splitting open and rattling my entire skull. For a moment, I was too stunned to move. 

When I finally climbed to my knees, I could feel the warm blood flowing from the gash on my chin, but that wasn't all.  I could taste it too, I spat the warm coppery fluid onto the deck and saw a few shattered teeth among the mess. 

“Fuck.” I mumbled painfully. 

I realized, I could hear Jimbo now. His voice racked with fear, “Evans, Ramirez! It's not Cobb anymore! Someone help me!” 

I stood on shaky legs and started toward the wheelhouse. I was still seeing stars, but Jimbo's panic spurred me on. “I'm coming!” I shouted.  

But, when I got to the wheelhouse, it was too late. The door had been smashed in, and Jimbo was gone. 

 “God Dammit!” I shouted in frustration. 

I rushed over to the intercom and called for Ramirez, “Ramirez, where are you? Jimbos gone, someone took him, I think it was Cobb.” 

I waited for Ramirez to come to the wheelhouse, praying I wasn't alone now. But he never came. 

After another ten minutes of calling for help, from Ramirez, the coast guard, God, anyone who would listen. I decided to head for the engine room, maybe he was still there, maybe the intercom was busted. I didn't know what to do, I just couldn't stay there. Before leaving the wheelhouse, I took the fire axe from its glass compartment. Whoever took Jimbo, even if it was Cobb, they wouldn't get me without a fight.  

I started down the stairs, axe in hand. I'm not a very big man, and the axe felt heavy in my hands, but I’d swing it for all I was worth if I had to. As I was about to enter the engine room, I felt a presence behind me. I froze, my grip tightening on the axe handle, but I wasn't fast enough. A pair of strong hands latched onto me from behind. One of them wrapping around and pinning the axe to my chest, the other clamped over my mouth stifling a scream. I squirmed and fought but couldn't break loose. 

“Calm yourself boy.” Came a hushed voice, “we may yet get out of this.” 

I calmed and he released me. When I turned around, I saw the last person I expected to see, “Captain Larsson.” I exhaled feeling a sense of relief, I wasn't alone. 

“Where have you been?” I asked, “We thought you fell overboard.” 

“I did.” He said in a shaky voice, “Cobb came after me like a mad man, swinging wildly. I tried to fight him off, but he was too strong, too primal. I ran, tried to get away, but the bastard chased me. His teeth chattering like he wanted to take a chunk out of me. I tried to make it back to the wheelhouse, but he tackled me over the side. I must have hit my head because I woke up hanging off the side of the ship, my leg tangled in the rigging and soaked to the bone.” 

“God, Jimbo was right.” I muttered. 

The captain nodded, “Whatever happened to him, he’s changed. When I finally managed to pull myself back aboard, I saw him. He’s not human anymore.” 

“What do you mean?” I asked. “And how did he get back on board?”  

“I don't know how he got aboard. But I saw him break down the door to the wheelhouse, I tried to get there but my numb fingers couldn't move fast enough to get the rope untangled from my leg.” His head dropped as he spoke, clearly disappointed that he couldn't protect a member of his crew. 

I looked him over; he was absolutely drenched and shivering violently. I was amazed he was alive, let alone on his feet. 

“I tried to get there too, but I fell. We tried radioing for help, but I don't think anyone heard us. And I don't know where Ramirez is, I was on my way to the engine room when you found me.” I explained. 

The captain nodded, motioning for me to give him the axe. ""Good man. I’ll take the lead from here; you just stay close. I won't lose anyone else tonight.”  

I didn't argue. I handed over the axe and fell in behind him. I was just glad I didn't have to face whatever was going alone. 

As we approached the engine room door, the captain ducked low and motioned for me to do the same. He carefully turned the handle and pushed the door open, being as quiet as the squealing hinges would allow. We stepped inside and were greeted with a scene straight out of a nightmare.  

Cobb was there, but Jimbo and the captain were right, he wasn't Cobb anymore. His back was to us, but I could see enough. His hair had mostly fallen out, his head swollen and misshapen. His arms had lengthened, nearly to below his knees and his flesh was the color of a rotting corpse. 

Jimbo and Ramirez were there too. Their bodies wrapped up in a mass of black slime-like webbing that covered the walls of the engine room, like massive, bloated flies in a spider's web. I could see chunks of flesh missing from Ramirez's body, yet somehow, he was still alive. Jimbo squirmed and fought against the webbing when he saw us, his eyes pleading for mercy. 

We watched on in horror as Cobb stepped to the back of the room and knelt down, bowing his head in supplication as the octopus climbed out from the shadows behind the ship's engine. The creature had grown massive since the last time we saw it; its size dominated the engine room. 

“Holy shit. Is that...” 

“Yes.” breathed the captain. 

“It can't be.” I whispered, “Its huge.” 

“It is.” 

 The creature crawled over to the black webbing where Jimbo had been cocooned. 

“Jesus!” I gasped, “Its eating them alive.” 

 But before it could start in on its fresh meal the captain stood and began shouting and banging the axe against the wall. 

“Leave them alone, you bastards!” He shouted, before turning to face me. “Go to the wheelhouse, get the life raft and get away from this place.” 

“What? No, I'm not leaving you here.”  

“I won't leave my men to suffer. Now go!” 

Cobb had turned to face us. He looked even more terrifying now, dead skin hung loose on his face and his eyes bulged from their sockets.  

“Damn you boy, go now!” Yelled the captain, “I’ll hold them off.” 

He gave me a shove out of the engine room, then slammed the door behind him. With no other option in sight, I ran. I ran as fast as I could to the wheelhouse. I found the inflatable life raft and made my way out onto the deck, then hesitated. Could I really leave the captain and the others here? Where was I supposed to go if I did leave the ship? Maybe I could find a weapon and help the captain fight them. Yes, I thought. I would help the captain; we would save the others.  

I began looking around for something, anything I could use as a weapon, then I heard it. A wet, broken, gargled voice from behind me.  

“G... Gr...Grreeeennhorn.” 

I turned to see Cobb, standing at the top of the stairway. He had a large gash across his chest and shoulder, which oozed dark purple. I think he tried to smile, but the loose flesh didn't move with whatever was underneath. 

“Oh God.” I breathed. 

“N... Not y...yett.” Said Cobb, in his grotesque voice. 

He lunged for me. I tried to back away, but I slipped again. I fell hard onto my back, kicking out at Cobb. My foot made contact with his face and knocked more flesh loose, he hissed and sputtered as I continued kicking but I couldn't get him off of me. His long arms reached out and clamped onto my shoulders, pulling my face closer to his. I punched him as hard as I could, causing him to grunt in pain but he never slowed. In a last effort I reached out and took hold of the loose skin on his face. With a mighty heave, I ripped it away, causing him to howl in pain and me to shriek in terror. Underneath the dead skin was mottled gray flesh lined with purple veins, just like the octopus. He was left with a gaunt featureless face under a swollen and bulbous head.  

I screamed and screamed as his mouth opened, what was once his tongue was now a writhing mass of tentacles which reached out and wrapped around the back of my head, pulling me closer and closer to certain death. I fought and fought but could do nothing but watch as inch by inch my head would be pulled into Cobbs waiting jaws.  

Suddenly there came a wet thwack sound. The tentacles around my head tensed once more before falling limp along with the rest of Cobbs body. I scrambled back away from him to see the fire axe buried in his head. 

“Why the hell are you still here?” Asked Captain Larsson.  

I jumped to my feet, “The others?” I asked. 

The captain shook his head, “Nothing to be done. Get the raft inflated, now. It's coming.”  

I grabbed the life raft and pulled the cord, the raft self-inflated in a sudden whoosh of air.  

“Wait.” I said, “Can't it just follow us into the water?”  

The captain smiled. “There is no us boy, I'm staying.” 

“Are you crazy? You can't stay here.” I said. 

He looked out to sea for a moment, “Did I ever tell you the meaning of the ships name?” 

“The Horven?” I asked, “Its Scandinavian, right?” 

He nodded, “Thats right. Back in Norway, my grandfather would always tell me tales of the old myths and legends. Tales of hero's and monsters. The horven was always his favorite, mine too I suppose. But the horven has another name.” 

“What name?” I asked. 

He smiled a grim smile, “Kraken.” 

I shook my head, “No. That's just a story...” 

He put his hand on my shoulder silencing me, “Maybe it is just a story. Or maybe, by naming my ship after the beast, I cursed us all. Either way, it's here and I’ll not leave while it lives.” 

“But...” 

“No, Evans. My mind is made up. Take the raft and go. If I kill the beast, I'll have avenged my crew. If it kills me, well, I’d like to think that at least someone made it out alive.” 

I studied his expression, “You don't think you can beat it, do you?” 

He looked down at his leg, blood pouring from an open wound and shrugged, “I'll give it hell all the same, maybe keep it busy long enough for...” 

Just then something wrapped around my ankle and began pulling me across the deck. I looked to see the huge octopus climbing its way to the top of the stairs from the engine room below. I screamed in pain and fear. The tentacle gripped my leg so hard; I thought it would crush the bone. Captain Larsson rushed forward and with a swift chop, severed the tentacle. We rushed to the life raft and tossed it into the sea below. I held the rope tight, keeping the raft from drifting away. 

“Captain, I can stay, I can help.” I said. 

He smiled warmly and put his hand on my shoulder, “Live a good life, son.” And with that he shoved me backwards off of the ship and into the waiting lifeboat below. 

The waves quickly pulled my raft out to sea, away from The Horven. I managed to get one last glimpse of Captain Larsson, before the waves took me away. A flash of lightning lit the scene as he swung the axe amidst the flailing tentacles, again and again. He screamed in rage as blood flew from the massive creature, and then I was carried away. 

 

I was only at sea for a few hours before another crab boat came along. Their captain had heard our distress call and came looking for us. After getting me some dry clothes and a blanket, they asked if there had been any other survivors. I thought about Jimbo and Ramirez, if they were alive, they were probably infected with whatever changed Cobb. I thought about the captain, I hoped he had survived, but didn't think he had. If he didn't manage to kill the creature, he’d be in the same shape as the other two. 

“No.” I said after a while. “There was no one else.” ",3,1743560150.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

1jpdhbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/1jpdhbr/uber_is_not_pocketing_50_my_2_cents_and_has_uber/,"Uber is not pocketing 50%, my 2 cents, and has Uber benefited you?","I see a lot of posts about uber drivers saying Uber is pocketing more than 50%, which is not true. Unlike Ticketmaster, the price the consumer accepts, give or take, includes all fees upfront. Uber is not pocketing 50%. **On average, their take rate is \~20% after fees.**

For instance, my recent trip to NYC broke down like this:

* **My Total: $43.00**
* Trip Fare: $33.50
* Taxes & Surcharges: $11.50
* **Uber's 20% cut (estimate): $6.70**
* Insurance Expense (estimate): 10–20% ($3.35 - $6.70)
* **Driver Receives \~$20.10 - $23.45 (46.7% - 54.54%)**

A breakdown like this shows Uber is not actually ""pocketing"" \~50% like people say. However, this was from the airport ride where fees may be higher. The government is the large benefactor and Uber takes the punch.

This can be proven by looking at their most recent public earnings (24Q4):

24Q4 Adjusted EBITDA Margins:

1. Mobility: 7.8% of gross bookings
2. Delivery: 3.6% of gross bookings
3. Freight: –1.7% of gross bookings

If they were truly taking > 50%, Uber's margins would be much higher. Additionally, the numbers Uber's reported are their company ""adjusted"" numbers, which are inflated to show more profitability than reality.

Above is their margin profitability after accruing **$30b of operating losses** over the past decade. For reference, Apple's Q4 EBITDA margins were \~34%.

https://preview.redd.it/6hvxm945wbse1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccc4782a7f7bdd1cd5345bc9bb8a4e5c157cf06f

The ride-share business is a very tough business to run. Ride-share companies need to juggle the customer, driver, and regulatory demands. The customer wants the lowest price, the driver wants the highest wage, and the regulators want a cut of the pie — these all squeeze margins. Only two rideshare companies in the US, Uber and Lyft, have been able to sustain such large operating losses to turn the corner. On top of that, they have an evolutionary risk (AV robotaxi) where you innovate or die.

As we all know, Uber is a platform that connects drivers with riders. It seems simple enough that ChatGPT could create it, but it's not. Otherwise, Uber and Lyft would not be the only players in town (in the US). All parties (including Uber) accept a transaction because it is beneficial to them. There is a symbiotic relationship. Uber gets a commission for facilitating the matchmaking and backend (insurance, support, payment). The rider accepts a price because it has the lowest opportunity cost, and the driver accepts a price because it has the highest opportunity benefit. If any party disagreed, no transaction would happen. All participants are at will.

I enjoy reading about the perspective of a driver. However, I believe many drivers are missing that Uber is a platform and everyone is at will. Riders are not forced to take rides. Drivers are not forced to accept rides. On the driver side, Uber simply provides drivers the opportunity to accept a ride. Drivers can accept or decline it. Uber acts as a facilitator. Their goal is to maximize activity aka gross booking volume, of which they get a cut. Theoretically, they would do this via maximizing driver supply and consumer demand Adam Smith style.

(However, now in some States (like CA, MA.), there are minimum pay guarantees that cause deadweight losses. This essentially means there is more driver supply than consumer demand. This creates spare capacity and makes it hard for full-time drivers to work full-time. It also makes the floor price essentially the ceiling. However, the earnings per active hour worked may be higher than otherwise.)

Additionally, drivers on this subreddit are very caught up on how much Uber is taking (20%, but many drivers think > 50%). (Wait until Starbucks workers learn they sell a 10-cent cup of coffee for $6). In reality, that should not matter. The only thing that should matter is the amount Uber pays you and if it is greater than a different job prospect. ""Show me the money.""

For what there is to say about Uber, there are many problems with this system, which have been discussed numerous times on uber subreddits, such as pay transparency and workers' rights. All else being equal, every additional driver in the pool slightly reduces the pay for others via driver competition.

However, for others, Uber provides a great job opportunity for the most underprivileged groups in America. These are people who likely would not have a job without the flexibility of a gig app like Uber or people who are short on cash for the week and can get it from working on Uber and avoid payday loans.

As an invention, I believe Uber adds a ton of value to society. For me, the two biggest benefits have been that it provides opportunities to the most underprivileged groups in society and that the accessibility has reduced drunk driving.

As drivers and users, do you believe Uber has benefited your life, and what about society?",0,1743559650.0,uber,5,0.17,False
1jpdgd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1jpdgd9/im_taking_my_cat_to_the_park_tomorrow_any_advice/,I'm taking my cat to the park tomorrow. Any advice is appreciated!,"For context, Ollie is 10 months old. He is currently fully indoors as I live in a second floor flat in the city, and there is no way to safely allow him to roam freely. My plan has always been to harness train him so that I can allow him to safely explore the outside world, take him on walks in parks or the woods, etc. 

Since he's a summer baby, by the time he was old enough and fully vaccinated, it was the middle of winter, and I didn't think it was a good idea to bring him outside for the first time in harsh, cold, rainy British weather. Now that the sun has come back, I wanted to start that process.

I'm sure he'll be completely fine. Whenever I've brought him to the vet before, I'll wait in the coffee shop next door for my bus and sit him next to me in his carrier. After a couple of times, I noticed him getting curious so I'd open the carrier a little bit so he can poke his head out and look around. (With his harness and leash on to prevent any chance of him running away/reaping havoc) When I do this he's so confident and curious, even in a busy coffee shop surrounded by people. He sticks his head out, looks around, interacts with anyone who comes to say hello, and is just overall very happy. I'm not worried he's going to be overly stressed or scared, but I'll have his carrier for if he wants an enclosed space to be alone for a bit.

My plan for tomorrow is to go to my local park, quite close to my house, with a book and just relax in the sun. I'm gonna bring a blanket, snacks (for both of us) plenty of water, a couple toys, and set us up in a nice quiet place that doesn't have too many people around. That way I can see how he reacts in as controlled an environment as I can manage before we try anything like a walk or a hike.

My main reason for doing this is that I feel bad that he has to be cooped up in the house, all day every day. It's also a way for me to spend time with him on my days off outside of the house. I work pretty long shifts, and on my days off I don't like leaving the house, because I already leave him home alone all the time when I'm working. This is a way for me to spend time and bond with him while still feeling like a human, and not spending all of my free time in potato mode at home. 

Is there anything I've failed to consider? Anything else I need to prepare for? I think my main concern is dogs. I'll be going to a park that enforces leash laws, but there's always the possibility of someone ignoring that, and I don't want somebody else's irresponsibility to end in Ollie getting hurt. I will have his carrier close at hand at all times, so I can quickly get him to safety if I see any dogs getting too close, but any other ideas are more than welcome.

It’s hard narrowing it down much more without actually being in the neighborhoods so I thought we would look to Reddit for some help. 

We love outdoor activities (hiking, biking, kayaking, skiing, etc). We would like to be close to a park or walking trails to take our daughter to. We would also love to be in walking distance to at least a few restaurants/coffee shops. I’ve heard commutes from all of these neighborhoods can be rough, but we shouldn’t have to commute into the city. 

North and West Vancouver seem to be perfectly located for the outdoor activities we love, but we were wondering if outside of Lonsdale it would be too suburban with not much of a walkable town and if Lonsdale would be too much of a big city feel. Port Moody looks like a super cute town with good access to nature, but not quite as much as North/West Vancouver. Any insight would be much appreciated!

1jpddbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jpddbf/i_blew_417_on_claude_code_to_build_a_word_game/,I blew $417 on Claude Code to build a word game. Here's the brutal truth.,"Alright, so a few weeks ago ago I had this idea for a Scrabble-style game and thought ""why not try one of these fancy AI coding assistants?"" Fast forward through a sh\*t ton of prompting, $417 in Claude credits, and enough coffee to kill a small horse, I've finally got a working game called LetterLinks: [https://playletterlinks.com/](https://playletterlinks.com/)

**The actual game (if you care)**  
  
It's basically my take on Scrabble/Wordle with daily challenges:

  \- Place letter tiles on a board

  \- Form words, get points

  \- Daily themes and bonus challenges

  \- Leaderboards to flex on strangers



**The Good Parts (there were some)**

*Actually nailed the implementation*

I literally started with ""make me a scrabble-like game"" and somehow Claude understood what I meant. No mockups, no wireframes, just me saying ""make the board purple"" or ""I need a timer"" and it spitting out working code. Not gonna lie, that part was pretty sick.

Once I described a feature I wanted - like skill levels that show progress - Claude would run with it. 

Ultimately I think the finished result is pretty slick, and while there are some bugs, I'm proud of what Claude and I did together.

  
*Debugging that didn't always completely suck*

When stuff broke (which was constant), conversations often went like:  
  
Me: ""The orange multiplier badges are showing the wrong number""

Claude: *dumps exact code location and fix*  
  
This happened often enough to make me not throw my laptop out the window.

  
**The Bad Parts (oh boy)**

*Context window is a giant middle finger*

Once the codebase hit about 15K lines, Claude basically became that friend who keeps asking you to repeat the story you just told:

Me: ""Fix the bug in the theme detection

Claude: ""What theme detection?""

Me: ""The one we've been working on FOR THE PAST WEEK""

I had to use the /claude compact feature more and more frequently.

  
*The ""I found it!"" BS*

Most irritating phrase ever:

Claude: ""I found the issue! It's definitely this line right here.""

*implements fix*

*bug still exists*

Claude: ""Ah, I see the REAL issue now...""

  
Rinse and repeat until you're questioning your life choices. Bonus points when Claude confidently ""fixes"" something and introduces three new bugs.  


 *Cost spiral is real*

What really pissed me off was how the cost scaled:

 \- First week: Built most of the game logic for \~$100

 \- Last week: One stupid animation fix cost me $20 because Claude needed to re-learn the entire codebase

  
**The biggest ""I'm never doing this again but probably will"" part**  
  
Testing? What testing?

Every. Single. Change. Had to be manually tested by me. Claude can write code all day but can't click a f\*\*\*ing button to see if it works.

This turned into:

 1. Claude writes code

 2. I test

 3. I report issues

 4. Claude apologizes and tries again

 5. Repeat until I'm considering a career change

  
**Worth it?**  
  
For $417? Honestly, yeah, kinda. A decent freelancer would have charged me $2-3K minimum. Also I plan to use this in my business, so it's company money, not mine. But it wasn't the magical experience they sell in the ads.

Think of Claude as that junior dev who sometimes has brilliant ideas but also needs constant supervision and occasionally sets your project on fire.

  
Next time I'll:

1. Split everything into tiny modules from day one

2. Keep a separate doc with all the architecture decisions

3. Set a hard budget per feature

4. Lower my expectations substantially

Life's been feeling like an endless cycle of planning for the worst, hoping for the best, and expecting something in between. But lately, it’s been harder to shake the weight of it all. Depression has a way of creeping in, making things feel heavy, even when there’s no specific reason. I know I’m not alone in that. I'm divorced, with no kids so far (it would be a nice one if that person already has kids... I'll skip the tutorial, jajaj; it doesn't matter if she doesent want... its ok).

Some days ago, I think I lost the last positive connection I had with someone I could talk freely to, someone that understood how i am in reality in all of the turmoil I'm living, and that left me again alone in the dark.

My actual job is to prepare for things to go wrong, which is fitting because my brain kind of does the same thing, ""Always flirting with chaos and Issues."" I’ve got a nerdy, slightly goth side, a love for deep conversations, and a dark sense of humor, but most of all, a need for a connection that might keep me going. On the surface, I stay optimistic, but deep down, I wrestle with that quiet nihilism that makes it hard to see the point sometimes.

I guess I’m just looking for someone to talk to on a daily basis—someone who can talk about life, share random thoughts, and maybe help each other find a little more light in the mess. No pressure, no weirdness, no NSFW, just good conversations and a reminder that the world isn’t as isolating as it feels.

  
Physically,  
5,6 / 170 pounds,  
Working out to achieve my goal, and make the other one feel good   


A little about me:

🔹 Tech geek by day, engineering specialist (both digital and personal) by night.

🔹 Sometimes sarcastic, witty, and a firm believer that memes are a love language.

🔹Cooking and making coffee is the way to know the other one, but i'm the cook.

🔹 Music taste? Industrial, metal, reggeton, and whatever fits the mood.

🔹 Into gaming, horror movies, and fixing things most people would just replace.

🔹 A fan of waking someone up with a deep phrase or a simple good morning poetry.

🔹 Big fan of deep, weird, and unfiltered conversations—sometimes geeky but mostly emotionally charged with poetry maybe, sometimes way crazier and out of the blue.

What I’m looking for:

👉 Someone close to my age (26-43) who enjoys excellent conversations and might want to spark things for the future.

👉 Nerdy, goth, alternative, or just someone with their own unique spark. I'm not exigent on those things.

👉 Bonus points if you like gaming, cooking, tech, horror, or just being delightfully weird.

If any of this resonates, send me a message; let's dive into a crappy chat for some time, since ghosting seems to be the way of reddit and its bots.

If you’re out there, let’s talk. Maybe we can make things suck a little less together.",1,1743559034.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1jpd87z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpd87z,Así es como le hacían…,"Que triste historia… sinceramente me imagine algo muy fuera de lo normal pero nunca el tamaño de la situacion. Espero que mis verdaderos amigos y los que verdad me conocen la lean, porque de esta forma es como empieza siempre cúpula, la parte mas peligra del crimen organizado.

El mentado Mark de la exposición esa “que trabajaba en una empresa de animatronics una cosa así que registraban un traje unos movimientos y que estaba ligado con Carlos Herrera el profesor de la universidad y Pete Butiglieg…” que en la película de Napoleón Dynamite el puto de “la technology” decían era ese cabron ya era que… “mi integridad”. Se chingaron al tal pete… 

Primero yo hablo Jose Fernandez, en el año 2009, una excelente persona, muy talentosa. Jose Fernandez, me da varios consejos de como hacer un pequeño video, entre todo esto al igual a seleccionar música de fondo, cuales tenian que ser sus elementos que le dieran el contraste necesario a las imágenes, una lección muy bonita. Jose Fernandez, me lo presento mi amigo Guillermo que supe que falleció. 

Estas personas por logica, sus mentes enanoides, no entienden que se trata de la industria del entretenimiento, del cine asi como diversas otras artes relativas. No tienen absolutamente ningun sentido ni ninguna correlación real. Resulto la misma historia de los pendejos frustrados de nuevo. Se acuerdan la historia que escribí de la tal “LO LA…” que unas personas de la ciudad, que estudiaron en dos generaciones abajo de la primaria, los dos se llamaban “Jose Manuel”, apellidaban diferente, y los dos eran de descendencia española… resulto que son esos mismos… los organizaban los Yunes… 

La parte de “You will get your coffee..” Que cosa mas pasada de verga… todo relativo a “Una putería por la espalda…” pero no la historia original… para lograr la putería… fue mas o menos como dijo Burt… “Tuvieron que tener todos los elementos muy muy difícil de lograr. Para lograr una mamada como la que hicieron…”

Efectivamente. Primero hablo con Jose Fernandez, por Skype… entonces ya se imaginan quien fue… en el 2009…. Creo que ya lo habia comprado Microsoft en ese año… como por mitad del año fue la reunión en linea… la organizo Guillermo… fue en Cordoba… 

Mientras vivió mi papa, se quedaron agazapados… parecia seguían instrucciones de la pelicula El Rey Leon… todo con precisión… en los eventos que esta gente mantenía que organizaban los orates esos para matar niñas en otras partes… tal cual como tipo dentistas… se dedicaban a seguir una supuesto rectoría de el tal Juan Bosco… ese es el sobrino de Pablo… el tal licenciado, que es el que nos mete el vergazo ya despues de que se muere mi papa… y ese termina al final se parte su madre solo… pero resulta que meternos el putazo… es que por medio de la primera pelicula la de Napoleon Dynamite… es que empiezan a elaborar supuestas anacrónias… las volvían isocronias… ya leyendo mas libros de Norman te das cuenta de lo que trata… toda una organización como fáctica… todo con elementos de palabras de las clases de maestra que yo grababa en un programa se llamaba Pear Note… por ejemplo… daban una cátedra… donde explicaban la “Verosimilitud”, y que la gorda que hacia las mamadas se llama “Veronica”.

Impresionante la pelicula… toda la gente esta empieza a operar, porque definen ya como un elemento ya una constante… que íbamos a cooperar y a colaborar con estas personas locales… esta gente le hablan a un sin numero mas de personas, que de España, que de Francia, que de Alemania, etc etc etc… todos operan a el mismo ritmo y la misma sintonía… es que por medio de todas estas mamadas, dicen que organizan cuestiones, en donde Yo ya doy autorización como mi propio padre, el cual se hacen ellos pasar por el tema por diversos factores, como estas mamadas que revisaban la basura de mi casa… y un sin numero de chingaderas…

Uno de los pendejos esos Jose Manuel, estudio Acustica… y es que empiezan a denominar elementos histéricos… “Peeeero Como!!!! Ha hablado con Jose Fernandez!!!!” Empiezan a organizar supuestos sentimientos de celos… celotipia, frustración profesional, y un sin numero de mamadas, relativas, pero todo todo todo estos pendejos empiezan a construir a su peor enemigo… con una supuesta guerra como que le llaman naval… a hacernos pendejadas de características sexuales… feas… chingaderas… cuando nadie absolutamente nadie, sabe cual es su verdadera razón logica… puesto que yo no les debo ni un centavo… de absolutamente nada… nunca les he pedido un favor… ni nada… construyen un valor completamente ficticio… 

Este tipo de recursos son los que tenian… 

Face off al señor Bill Gates… que todo el tema lo tienen como una supuesta organización hidráulica… que abren una llave… una compuerta inicial diciendo que es el Skype… de ahi un sin numero de mamadas inimaginables… cuestiones que sinceramente, son impresionantes… lo que le hacen a una niña… durante tanto pero tanto tantísimo tiempo… 

Donde forzosamente nos esperan en España… todo un grupo como de violadores… de bullys profesionales… yo no puedo hacer absolutamente nada porque no estoy armado, ni tengo ningun titulo autoritario, ni absolutamente ningun poder de fuego… ni nada… 

Pero lo que si puedo es por lo menos escribir esto… toda es una organización de gente que no quiere trabajar… toda una banda profesional que ha estudiado todas las probabilidades habidas y por haber… de absolutamente todos los recursos que cuento los que necesito y los que no tengo para poder desarrollar mi vida… y como ellos pueden seguir ganando del tema por diversos medios y algún tipo de objetivo que tienen….

Reed no sirve para nada ni nunca ha servido… y sinceramente EEUU pudiera ser un lugar muy peligroso a donde ir… son personas que estan VICIADAS… es una palabra que pocas personas lo entienden… 

Algo que no avanza… porque tenian este tipo de mamadas… pienso… “Por lo menos me hubieran dejado abandonado en Italia… ahi de verdad las personas me querian…” vienen a regresarme a toda estas PUTISISISISIMAS MAMADAS, impresionantes… a estar escuchando los quejidos, de puros pendejos altamente frustrados… dia con dia y hora y hora… duro y duro y duro y dale.. estos pendejos… 

Yo ya le dije… Por favor vete a tu casa… nos vemos en Japón… ahi la gente no quiere saber nada… “Que les vaya bien…” va a aparecer por ahi… en cualquier lugar… 

Para que yo vaya a EEUU… primero tengo que hacer una llamada telefónica… al North Command… “Quiero ver acción… real….” No hay acción… “Que dios los bendiga… yo por mi lado y ustedes por el suyo…” y ojalá que logren sus objetivos de todo lo que decidan hacer… yo voy a pasármela muy bien teniendo hijos… lo mas probable es que me quede en Asia…

Tienen a este pendejo todos los días con su SKYPE… increíblemente todas las anacondas, de la pelicula… como bloqueaban las conexiones entrantes de la conexión de Kamailio… la caja cerrada… el capitán, sin la mitad del torso inferior… una historia… tristísima…

Hoy volví a empeñar mis cosas… que historia… compre en su mayoría arroz y frijoles para poder comer… porque pues habían dicho primero que “Solo era el ver a Tom y Jerry…” y sin embargo siguieron con esto… que ellos denominan tienen un servidor, que “yo lo acredite” yo no acredite absolutamente nada… y que siguen con la historia esta que suman elementos que tengan relación con esta pelicula… y por logica con cualquier cosa relativa al nombre “JOSE FERNANDEZ”

Lo mas interesante es en Torino… ahi por la estación… habia una esquina… de un restaurante… la esquina tenia por logica dos paredes… de frente al lugar, la pared izquierda… decía el apellido de Guillermo era… Basignani…. Algo asi… tenia un saxofón de color dorado…. Entre el bulleting board y el vidrio que lo cubría… luego llegando a Bologna, me avisaron que habia muerto… al poco tiempo murio Pele… llego meses muchos meses despues a Berlin…. Y la gorda esa parte de la organización de estas mismas personas… resulto que tenia mi saxofón adentro de su recamara… y que la mujer tenia dos gatos… en su casa… que habia vivido un año en Japón… que tenia un marco de una fotografia atras del sofa donde veía las películas color dorado se lo habia regalado Ernesto Lara… que era su mujer… y que mi saxofón era color plateado no dorado… y dicen mas o menos las fechas en donde Ernesto lo llevo a casa de la mujer… entre el 2011 y el 2014… bastante tiempo… 

Entre los eventos que ocurrieron donde se metían a mi casa… de forma ilegitima sin que hubiera nadie… en uno de ellos confirman, que este pendejo el tal Ernesto… agarra un marco de fotografías digital… saca la memoria… y la empieza a duplicar… en su computadora portátil… y es que empiezan a buscar la forma, como volver a Erin la mujer alemana esa… y el marco era “Una familia” la cual la mantenía… para que se imaginen de que se trata la historia… completa….

Llega una muchacha muy afligida de Inglaterra… a decirme que supo los amigos de Steven… lo que le habían hecho a Erin y todo que complicado esta con esta gente local… de todo lo que han venido haciendo diciendo que eran mi papa… y era un pendejo que se habia tomado la sangre menstrual de mi mama… en un show… despues llego a la misma secundaria, en donde lo implantan y lo quieren volver un supuesto hasta rey… todo un circo que tienen consecuencias… puesto yo no tengo por que colaborar…

No hubieran hecho nada de esas mamadas… hasta la fecha… hasta el dia de ayer…. con la mayor desfachatez del mundo… todavia sigue hablando Yunes Linares… aqui… pidiendo una serie de mamadas impresionantes… 

Lo de el plato de Melamina… resulto que era la pieza de plastico… “Color Cafe…” del hombre ese minusválido… para que se imaginen de que trata… 

Unos autores… que iban que… que improvisando… 

Ojala que no los hubiera yo agarrado, con todo esto… pero ni modo… asi es la vida… Jose Fernandez… ese se va a reír… primero va a decir yo ni los conozco… 

Asi el pedo… ni modo… dicen los que mataron a Steven Jobs… “Por lo menos los van a sacar de aqui…” pues si tiene logica… “Por lo menos me vaya a un lugar donde yo tenga amigos…” no viva rodeado de mis enemigos… “Miraaa!!! Miraaa!!! Lo que hace!!!” “Anotadle…!!!” Miraaa miraaaa… vamos a ponerlo… etc etc… a donde hablan con los putos estos transexuales histéricos… etc etc etc…

Me pongo a pensar hasta donde esta el putazo… al grado que dicen los japoneses “ADOPTAMOS”, asi es el mensaje, de personas que sin duda alguna… me aman de verdad… para mandarme a decir eso… y que la mujer de la pelicula es idéntica a la tal Priscila… la amante de Troy y mi papa… y que luego de mi supuesta “mama”, todavia tienen a una “abuelita”, todo bajo ilusiones mentales… encubierto con todo este tipo de recursos.

Algo me imaginaba de Gates… pero no tanta culerada… sinceramente… pero bueno… haber que pasa… de entrada si yo hubiera sabido de esas mamadas… nooooombre, si a esas putas campañas no tenia yo nada que ganar, igual con Marti… yo hubiera sabido de que trataban… desde hace cuanto me hubiera ido de marihuano a Canada… como hacen muchos…. A New Zealand… Australia etc etc etc… “Esto se trata que usted va a estar solo, contra EL HAMBRE”, aparte “NO VA A GANAR USTED ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA”….  Sinceramente les hubiera dicho chinguen a su madre…. ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA… en Cordoba me pagaban a la semana en esa campala 1300 para los gastos, me tomaba como a la semana 3 botellas de whisky de 1000 cada una… con unas viejas… mejor me hubiera quedado hasta en mi casa… 

Ahora hay que aguantar los pinches nigros estos… que lloran… que se aflijen… no crean que mucho… “Ellos ya estan muy muy contentos…” “Lo lograron…” como verse todos los días en el espejo una cicatriz…. en todo el ojo… desde la frente hasta el cachete… creen que se me va a olvidar… esas mamadas no se le olvidan a nadie.",1,1743558941.0,LasAventurasDeEnrique,0,1.0,False

1jpd7ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/abundancedems/comments/1jpd7ln/the_blessing_of_abundance/,The blessing of Abundance,"What I believe to be so great about Abundance by Ezra Klein andDerek Thompson is that it expands the American left. If you’re a young adult and find living in a major international city ( i.e NYC, Paris, Amsterdam) appealing then you what you want is Abundance Liberalism. 

Abundance Liberalism is:

1. Dense mixed-use housing. This is what gets you those corner bakeries, local coffee shops, rooftop bars, “everything is so close” feeling, bike lanes and so now you’re maybe biking to work or school but it’s more like Amsterdam biking and less like Los Angeles biking. No more “only having one drink because I got to drive home” moments. Why is this liberal abundance? Because you’re encouraging the city to grow, the collective and not the individual. You’re acknowledging a public domain (city life, urban density, public space) needs to grow.

2. No parking minimums. This gets you buildings that look more like Copenhagen and NYC brownstones and less like Dallas apartment buildings (you post pictures in front of which buildings?). This also eventually gets you less auto shops, billboards, noise, dirty air, car insurance bills, parking tickets, traffic, small  sidewalks etc. Why is this liberal abundance? Because you believe the end goal of policy matters. You think it’s better for a city if its people walked more, biked more and took transit more than one with traffic, highways, and parking lots. If you prefer the traffic, highways and parking lots and you want abundance but not liberal abundance. 

3. Public transit. You probably want to be able to live in San Francisco but work in LA. Or how about be able to work on the other side of town without needing a car? Spring break in Miami and you live in Chicago? Take the high speed rail. The reason why you love Europe is because you can hop on a train and get to another cool city fairly quickly, affordable in a really nice train that you drank beer in. Public transit as a whole is quite literally a ginormous machine that is always running. You need to upkeep this machine. You need to feed it what it wants. When it gets crowded, you grow it. You probably want it cleaner, more frequent, more safe, to go to places you need, to be on time and to be cheap. You probably want it to feel like Vienna or Tokyo and less like the LA Metro. Why is this liberal abundance? Again, it’s public and you want to grow and feed it. Not just through allocating dollars but more importantly in giving the beast that it is the freedom to grow.

If you’re a 20-45 year old, living in a city in America and go to places like Amsterdam, Rome, Barcelona or Paris and think wow this place is awesome, it is because the American city that you’re in is probably liberal but not producing liberal abundance. What I mentioned above are 4 simple ways to get the city you’re in to feel more like those awesome cities you travel to. ",2,1743558890.0,abundancedems,3,0.75,False

tl;dr: need 1 caster DPS for 7.1 savage and beyond; Tues/Wed 9-10:30 ET.

Our static, Degenerate Coffee House, is looking for one DPS for 7.1 savage and beyond! We're a 6-person static that has been mostly raiding together since Stormblood! We're looking for goofy, mature people with level heads and a good sense of humor. Our group was previously midcore/semi-hardcore, but as three of our members have recently had children and we've all gotten a little older, we've decided to switch to a ""motivated casual"" style.

We're raiding Tues/Wed 9-10:30 ET. Reclears will be done on Tuesdays, if we fail to reclear, there will be optional regroups during the rest of the week to reclear. Wednesdays will be dedicated prog days.

Crafted gear is not expected, but we do expect you to bring consumables and keep up with tomes/normal drops. Reading up on upcoming fight mechanics is a requirement, this will not be a blind party due to time limits. Consistency, communication, and timeliness are also a requirement for the same reasons.

Last tier was our first time trying the 90-minute format, and I'm happy to be able to say that it worked well for us in spite of losing multiple raid nights to maintenance, holidays, and the unexpected departure of one of our members. We previously raided Mon/Tues, so we're switching to Tues/Wed to avoid the same problem of overlapping maintenance times.

If you're looking for fast, early clears, our group is unfortunately not for you (unless you just want a second group to raid with that is more casual, which is fine! our last caster did that). If you want a group that goes at their own pace, has fun, avoids burnout, and [b]will[/b] clear before echo, give us a ring!

Our first raid night will be April 8/9 at half attendance due to various absences. We will have our first full attendance raid nights on April 15/16.

I’m trying to get out of my introverted box and get into writer communities, so thanks in advance for the help here! I did work with my editor on this query and have 10 out right now. 



Dear Agent,
 
(Personalization). I would love to introduce my debut novel Hunting Shadows, a completed 90,000-word crime thriller.
 
Hunting Shadows is a story about Lana Hunter, a tenacious female homicide detective, who is forced to work undercover, against her colleagues and the FBI, hunting a serial killer. She has to make increasingly tough decisions as she fights for justice for a series of murdered women and to save the life of her best friend.
 
There’s a serial killer in St. Louis, and he’s hiding in plain sight in the coffee shops he hunts in. Paul Wellington is a wealthy man with a simple desire: to have Victoria Monet – now living a new life as Jennifer Morris, CSI lead and Lana's best friend – all to himself. He killed her sister ten years ago and with ten victims under his belt he’s ready to throw all his rules out to secure his real target: her.  
 
Lana Hunter is a seasoned homicide detective. She thought she had seen it all—until she entered Heather Meyer’s crime scene. She realized the murder was the work of someone who  had killed many times before. Her partner, Devin Westbrook, wasn’t convinced.  For the first time in their careers, the two find themselves at odds, forcing Lana to turn to her best friend, CSI lead Jennifer Morris. The two women devise a plan to catch Heather’s killer before he strikes again. Jennifer only agrees to help if Lana keeps their plan a secret from Devin and her boyfriend, FBI Agent Owen Quinn. But Jennifer has a past Lana doesn’t know about.
 
When Jennifer goes missing, Lana is forced to confront the weight of her secrets and the possibility that her actions have put her best friend’s life in danger while dealing with the broken trust of her team. Meanwhile, Paul’s carefully constructed plans begin to unravel. In a final confrontation at a secluded barn, Lana must risk everything—including her career—to stop him and save her friend.
 
Hunting Shadows explores the deep bonds of friendship, the consequences of secrets, and the darkness of obsession. Its shared themes of justice, and the power of unearthing long-buried secrets, will appeal to readers of Rita Herron’s The Silent Dolls, and Gillian Flynn's Dark Places. Its dark tone and pacy, alternating perspectives will appeal to readers of Alaina Urquhart’s The Butcher and the Wren, and its theme of dark obsession will appeal to readers of Gabriel Bergmoser’s The Caretaker.
 
(Bio)
 
I have attached a synopsis and the first three chapters of the manuscript(or whatever material the agent noted), and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

And nearly every time I did, would find more evidence, then she would deny and attack me for invading privacy.  It only fueled more anxiety.

Fast forward to my current marriage.  We agree that we should be able to go through each others phones whenever we wanted to feel comfortable that each of us was being faithful. This agreement had gotten us through nearly 18 years.

In the last couple of years, I screwed up by not listening to my wife.  I admit that I wasn't patient enough to listen to her.  This went on for years, ""I need you to do this"", ""I feel like your mother"", etc.  My brain heard these things, but I had nearly no motivation/mental capacity to force myself to do it.  I would hear it, just never act on it.  I would get home and collapse from mental exhaustion.

Fast forward to September of 2024, my father died.  My nerves shut everything down.  I couldn't process anything, even my friends say I wasn't listening anymore.

During this time my wife games online and meets a groups of friends.  One of them lives in another continent, but she became really close to him because they share the same trauma. 

I begin to notice more and more she was spending time with him online, either watching movies, playing games, talking, or messaging.  I would ask to spend time with her in the evening around 9 or so, and she wouldn't come to bed until past 11 saying that they had a hard time finishing a level or whatever.

This is where my anxiety from my past wife starts kicking in, worrying about if there's something going on online.  She would comfort me by telling me he lives in another continent, but I've been cheated on before with just an Internet connection and a webcam, I'm not stupid.

We had a blowout fight, I told her if she felt this guy was more important than me then we should go ahead and divorce.

Boom, anxiety kicks up in her.  We had a fight, she has a trauma response, we finally hit some calm and we go to bed.  However she stays up and talks with her friend online.

Next day I watch online while this guy from literal morning until late evening is either messaging or with my wife in voice chat.  I finally had enough and confronted him that next afternoon, he stated he has no interest in anyone romanticall and gave up relationships, and they were just friends helping each other with trauma.

My wife walks in, barely able to talk to me until she figured out I was talking with him.  Then for a brief period, she becomes friendly asking what we had discussed, then when I told her, she broke away and became extremely distant.  I began to think everything I was told was true, and begged her to forgive me, she began to cry, and I asked what was wrong, she said she was afraid her friends relationship had changed.

After that, she didn't want to have the open phone policy anymore.  She wanted distance and privacy.

I was devastated.  At some point I went through their texts and found out that after that first argument that she talked about all of our marital problems to him and called him her best friend.  My anxiety comes up again - round 2.

More and more fighting happened until I finally bring up her past and told her she forgot how bad it was with her past boyfriends (I used her trauma against her).  She said a few explatives and walked out. 

Since then, I can tell when I talk with her it causes her anxiety.  She's constantly looking for a way out of the conversation or the room.  For the first few days it was just 1 word answers.

All the while as soon as she gets up, she's on the computer with him laughing and carrying on.

They both claim that shared trauma and talking to each other help and nothing is going on, but I can't shake this feeling something more is going on.

From morning to night since then, it's been the same pattern.  Wake up, coffee, wait until I leave, he eventually gets on, they chat, they play games, they watch TV, break, then repeat until evening.  

 In the meantime I've acknowledged that my dad's death and previous behavior has been a large contributing factor to all of this.  I've taken all the things she's told me, gotten lists together, and began planning to get them done.  Starting doing random and planned romantic gestures and taking chores on a regular basis.

She is opening back up slowly, but my anxiety keeps kicking up because while I'm trying to talk with her, he keeps texting her, I have to stop talking so she can reply.  The replies always happen with a smile or giggle, then when she talks with me it's stone faced.

It's agonizing.  I want this fixed, but she says every time I begin to question if anything is going on, that she feels controlled like she used to and her anxiety kicks up.  At that same time, I have to watch another man be first place in her life instead of me, wondering if more is going on.

I'm doing the 40 day love challenge, and I want this to work and have decided I'm going to try.  But I don't know what to do about her constant gaming and her attachment to this guy.

What I imagined with this project was, instead of seeing these messages online where our algorithms are tailored to our interests, they be plastered in public spaces for a broader audience, in the hopes they get the attention of anyone not paying attention. On their way to work, on billboards, at the bus stop, on their church bulletins, at the coffee shop, on the way to class, etc. They critique American ideals, class struggle, highlight important historical events & movements, briefly explain how MAGA came to be, and even mention important names like Curtis Yarvin and Peter Thiel.

I’m no graphic designer by any means, so feel free to recreate or use as inspiration to make your own. But the goal is to print them out and put them EVERYWHERE. On telephone poles, in the windows of local shops, libraries, church bulletins, and banners. Make yard signs out of them to call out your MAGA conservative neighbors. Get them on billboards in your deep red state. Hold them up at the next protest or town hall with your representatives. If you live in a metropolis like NYC or LA, hold them up outside of news stations. Be bold. Put the mirror up to their faces. Words have weight so get the word out!

But drinking coffee frequently didn't help either. It only really stopped a few days after quitting. I'm trying journaling.. should I just stick with CBT person? Is this a stupid question? I feel like if its a CBT issue I can just google.

Honestly didn't mean to switch therapists.... edit: like genuinely what if I get into issues if i open up to him about it, suddenly getting an iffy feeling.. just worried I'm making a mistake by switching back to this therapist.

1jpcnx1,https://i.redd.it/601dumtuqbse1.jpeg,Increased fees - venting,"No advice needed, just venting about an email sent out regarding price increases randomly.

1) amenity renewal fee. 3 years ago there was no fee, 2 years ago there was no fee. Last year they added a $100 fee. Now it’s $150 for the same amenities 
The amenities include: 
- 2 grills that either never have propane or are never cleaned by the previous user. 
- a building that houses a small sized pool table and a gym. The gym has 3 things; a treadmill, bike and elliptical. 

That’s it. Last year they also added a lease renewal fee of $100 to cover maintenance

Not sure what sort of events they are planning but in the past they’ve tried 2 things and no one shows up. Everyone works so they can afford to live here, not decorate coffee cups together 

2) dog fee. Currently $25 per month for both dogs and cats. Cat owners are not getting an increase. No mention of how the extra money will allow the community to be more pet friendly. We have waste stations around that are never emptied and a tiny dog park that is next to a community of feral cats lol

So, 1998, it was an alright year for Microsoft, but to me, it had been a year of horror. In 1998, I was around 21 years old, and my work office required me to buy a computer for work, so I did, little did I know, this would end tragically. I had bought a Windows 98 Office PC which was a bundle, so I’d save some money, and once I told my boss, he’d heard a rumor spreading around the office that an employee all the way at Microsoft Headquarters had died testing one of the Office 98 PC’s, I thought it was a stupid rumor at the time, so I told my boss I got an office computer for home, The reason for having to buy a computer was because the office I worked at was shutting down for a month due to a roach infestation. Someone had left the coffee machine on, and the coffee pot was leaking a bit, leading to bugs finding it, and having it IMPOSSIBLE to clean. So my boss gave me the sign to head home that I was good, and I realized I needed a place to set up my computer.

When I headed home, it didn't take me long to find room for it, I had set up the desktop monitor, the keyboard and mouse, and of course, the PC. After I turned it on, it was already set up, “Huh.” I had said to myself confusingly. but when I opened up Excel, and had noticed a somewhat bald man with a mustache, notepad and pen who was wearing a blue long sleeve shirt, though I’d assume it is button up, but the assistant was pixely, so it was hard to make out, he had a white undershirt with a red tie, brown slackeys, and white shoes. He had asked me if I needed help with a spreadsheet, I’d clicked no and he just stayed there. It was kind of creeping me out, so I tried to figure out how to disable him, I eventually found the Control Panel, and disabled the office assistant, and continued working on my spreadsheet, then, he’d pop up again.

We are in relationship for more than 9months and she love me very much and I love her very much . We are open to each other on everything and we communicate as much we can . We both are honest and straightforward and have pretty healthy relationship. 

So I’m out of country rn for trip with family . There is 2hr + time difference and I’ve poor network here so messages are delayed and we aren’t able to vid call / audio call due to privacy and network issues . 

For some more context she used to talk to many random guys online on all kind of stuff as she was single back then but after coming into relationship she herself stopped that without ever pointing out which is truly remarkable change I appreciate her I’m glad she did it herself but today she was texting a random senior she don’t even know . So I came online while she was talking to that guy in insta but she still continued chatting with him . Yeah I’ll agree my internet was slow so messages were delayed ( 10-40 sec ) , video / audio weren’t clear on call but I’m shocked that she was chatting with him simultaneously almost whole time literally even when we were arguing when I taunted her on this thing . 

She said she had opened the my chat waiting for messages but replying him from notifications. Yeah I got angry as today I rushed from the place to come to hotel and have a chat with her but she did this but later on things ended on good note but now I’m feeling disappointed. 

If she says I’m her first priority then why she was continuously talking to that guy , can’t she wait for my message as I’ve genuine issue.  

Also for the chatting it wasn’t much special he was trying to talk to her by roasting himself, she was just roasting her while staying respectful to him . She asked some study related questions ( little bit ). Also that guy was calling her names) idiot in native language which isn’t offensive, which further annoyed me ) . Also that guy asked for coffee but she turned it down and he complimented her also flirted ( I really hate it when someone flirts with her but she can’t control what other person will say) but she just stayed playful so that she won’t disrespect him. I have context above because I want to know that she had habit of that freedom of doing anything to anyone so what could be a possible reason she was chatting with him when I was talking to her ?

Maybe I’m insecure or very jealous person ( maybe both ) but I’m okay when she talks to her male friends / person she knows but this random person thing I’m not okay with it . Every time she had long chats with random person I’m overthinking , we have fight because of person we both even don’t know but she still do this like after 2-3 months .

I believe this my disrespect ( maybe over reacting ) .I feel like shit ngl . Like I don’t think basic things should be asked like please talk to me ( even though I’ve said earlier ( different story )) and not to someone else . We are grown up adults and we know what to do . How our action will affect other person . Yeah I check her Instagram too much read her almost every chat ( random person ones ). 

Did I overreacted? Am I controlling freak who can’t watch her talking to other guy ? Maybe I’m boring ? 

Yeah also I’m an overthinker so I can’t sleep rn even though I was very very tired .

I was at the doctor last month and weighed almost 200 pounds, the heaviest I have ever been in my life. They even weighed me multiple times to be sure. Lately a lot of people have been commenting on my weight loss, which I just kinda brushed off and today I finally weighted myself and was down to the 160s. I weighted myself multiple times as my scale is less reliable than the doctors, but it was consistently weighing in the 160s. I have struggled with eating disorders my whole life and up until the first of the year did not prioritize eating (i actually eat more now than I every have). I have started choosing more organic options as well as cutting out some junk.

Mentally I am not in the greatest state of mind and am constantly under immense stress and hardships both at home and work. I am in post grad and am constantly working or studying for my boards. Not including the 2 hour round trip commute I do everyday on top of living with family with intense and chronic mental illness. My assumption is the weight loss is obviously because of stress but I just wanted some other opinions. I also stopped taking all of my medication including Adderall, Wellbutrin ,and birth control. I have added in supplements including fish oil, woman's multivitamin and probiotic as well as hair growth supplements.. 

Some other strange symptoms I have been experiencing include intense cramping and pain in hips and abdomen, throwing up when overwhelmed/over stimulated, fatigued and lethargic (i have caught myself nodding off at the wheel first thing in the morning after 2 cups of coffee), there are definitely others I am forgetting but cannot recall currently. 

I am not a very active person wither, as work I do a lot of physical restrains on very strong individuals as well as taking my dog on a daily walk (most days). As for diet I don't really restrict myself. I usually have sone sort of meal body subscriptions to motivate myself to eat. I also have completely cut out soada and diet soda. 

My doctor did testing last month and the results I was told that there was elevated white blood cells in  my vaginal swab, but everything was normal otherwise.

Any ways to reduce neighbor smells,"I bought a new build townhouse in 2020 and got the 2.5% interest rate (this goes down as the biggest mistake of my life, sharing walls)

First few years were amazing. Had a great neighborly relationship with the lady who shared a wall next door. Amazing location, nice yard etc 

She moved out a year ago and is renting her side out to her family member 

This renter smokes weed inside and it permeates the walls, plumbing and vents into my home. My friend came over and asked if I smoke weed it was so strong lol

So what I’ve tried to mitigate the smell and it hasn’t helped:

Air purifiers with charcoal 

HVAC guy placed charcoal filters in the vents

Multiple box Fans to direct the smell out the window

Windows open 

Air fresheners 

Coffee grounds throughout the rooms

Made the neighbor aware that it’s coming over to our side very strongly 

None of this has worked. We sadly can’t move for another couple years until my husband gets a raise at work. Any other ideas? 
People in my life have told me to let the landlord know (my old neighbor), I have her number and she told me to let her know if anything needs to be addressed, and also told me ahead of time that they are smokers but they can’t smoke inside because she knew I was pregnant and didn’t want this to happen.

Why are we still drinking plain water. If you leave it out it goes stale, if you let it get warm it just feels weird, and if it’s cold all it does is numb your tongue. There is no dopamine from the taste. It’s just a nothing burger essentially. 

Even sugar water is better. Our bodies crave sugar, or anything sweet. It makes us happy, feel good, feel nourished. 

And to solve the health problems related to excess sugar? Sugarfree alternatives or just— not sugaring. That’s where sugarfree syrup comes in. Dozens of flavors, can be mixed easily, and has tons of colors! They can have sugar, none, or an alternative. It’s perfect! You get a nice taste in your mouth and the gratification and slightly more fullness from just… water, colors, and sugar alternatives. Minimal calories, fun, and basically like juice.

Not into crazy sugary? Lemon water, teas, coffee, coconut water… any random thing with a flavor in it + water???

I simply don’t understand why people choose unflavored water now. And DO NOTTT say health benefits. Basically all of these liquids I just listed are 95% or MORE water. Look on the back of a coke bottle for example. It’ll say something like “less than 2% of” and include the colorant, flavoring, preservatives, etc. soda is mostly water with some carbon, juice is mostly water, tea is leaf water. All of these drinks are MOSTLY WATER!!! Even some foods have a high water content! Like WATERmelon at 95%. So **SHUT UP ABOUT IT NEEDING TO BE WATER.

Accommodations : Sibonné Beach Hotel. Absolutely loved it. The small size was perfect and just what I was looking for. Comfortable and safe, I felt fine leaving my belongings on the loungers while I maximized time in the ocean water. Having a good restaurant right next door was super convenient for travel days. Service at breakfast was quite slow, dinner was more professional and on point. The ONLY minus to this hotel was that they are building a massive high rise hotel in a lot nearby and construction noise all day was not ideal. Can’t escape the hammering of “progress.” Would stay here again absolutely, as I avoid the large all-inclusives. 


Car rental : Grace Bay Car Rentals from the airport. No issues, straight forward. Driving in T&C was pretty easy, the roundabouts take a bit of getting used to, but fine overall. 


Restaurant recs: 

•Overall winner : Las Brisas! Food, atmosphere, and service were all excellent. 

•Would go again: Cocovan, Grace’s Cottage, Rickie’s Flamingo Cafe, Bay Bistro, Mr. Grouper. For sure, Conch Shack - definitely worth the ride out there. 

•Would skip: Le Comptoir Français - super overpriced even for T&C, and the food was aggressively mediocre. Omar’s, unless you are going for the sole purpose of being at a beach bar. The location felt a little too off the beaten path and the food took FOREVER even for a Caribbean pace. Saw a couple tables get the wrong items. Service (apart from Omar being very friendly) was not great. 

Beaches: Loved Leeward for morning walks and spent most my time at Grace Bay near Sibonné. Would skip the trek out to Long Bay, unless you’re a windsurfer.

1jpc9oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1jpc9oo/my_best_friend_of_two_years_hasnt_been_treating/,My best friend of two years hasn’t been treating me like an actual friend,"Hi, I’m coming on here now because I’m not sure what to do about a certain friend and I want to get others opinions on the situation. 
My best friend, who I’ll call Allie, has been my best friend throughout all of middle school and now 9th grade year. She used to be the most amazing person I knew, constantly putting other people before herself and always making time for me no matter the circumstances, (And actually seemed like she wanted to hangout). But since we’ve gotten into high school, she’s changed in so many small ways that just all come together to make the person she is now. Since she joined cross country this year, she’s made this huge group of friends who she’s spending majority of her free time with even when it’s not in cross country season. Since she now has such a big group of friends, it’s almost like she’s developed this inner superiority complex that she’s not even aware of; she used to be able to take responsibility for her actions and actually know when she’s in the wrong, but now she’s incapable of doing that and has a SEVERE victim complex. She’s so wrapped up in her own little world and is only concerned with what’s going on in her life, yet she’s completely unaware of that and thinks she’s the most amazing and caring person. We used to text 24/7 about the most random things and now I hardly get 3 texts a day; she used to be at my house multiple times a week including Wednesdays when we would go to church together, but now the last time she was at my house was for my birthday party, (Which was over a month ago). To be fair, I haven’t REALLY tried to arrange plans but I’ve slid the idea over multiple times that we should hangout soon and she never makes any effort to. I also stopped making a genuine effort because I noticed that I was the one planning all of our hangouts and she didn’t even try to anymore. It would be different if she’s a genuinely busy person who doesn’t have a lot of free time, but somehow she still ends up making time for her new boyfriend, while I haven’t hung out with her in over a month. I’ve talked to her multiple times about how I’ve been feeling and almost every time she said she would try to make me a bigger priority. I’ve seen no change whatsoever. Also, the day that we stopped going to church together was when my sister and I were waiting for her at our usual coffee shop, (like we would do EVERY single week beforehand), and she just never showed up and didn’t bother to tell us she wouldn’t be coming to said coffee shop; she ended up sitting with her cross country friends that night as well. I just want to mention that this is not a jealousy issue of her new friends, I’m perfectly fine with her having other friends. My problem is her incapability to balance it out or even make an effort to spend time with me. I forgot to mention that I eat lunch in a teachers classroom at school and there have been several days that the teacher wasn’t there, so I would eat with her, but multiple times now she’s said she wouldn’t eat with me because she made plans with some of the cross country girls and that I need to tell her beforehand. Mind you there’s an entire group of them and I have no one to eat lunch with; I have other friends but they have their friends that they eat lunch with and that’s just an awkward situation to be in. She knows this, but still wouldn’t eat lunch with me even though there’s a whole group of them and they eat lunch together every single day. I was so close to having to sit in the bathroom on the toilet for the entire lunch period before I finally figured out what to do. Also shouldn’t be having to book a reservation with her, I just needed to eat lunch with my best friend for one day. I don’t want to drop her, but I’m not sure what to do anymore since I’ve talked to her multiple times and there’s been no changes. Sorry for the rant",1,1743556075.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

First few years were amazing. Had a great neighborly relationship with the lady who shared a wall next door. Amazing location, nice yard etc 

She moved out a year ago and is renting her side out to her family member 

This renter smokes weed inside and it permeates the walls, plumbing and vents into my home. My friend came over and asked if I smoke weed it was so strong lol

So what I’ve tried to mitigate the smell and it hasn’t helped:

Air purifiers with charcoal 

HVAC guy placed charcoal filters in the vents

Multiple box Fans to direct the smell out the window

Windows open 

Air fresheners 

Coffee grounds throughout the rooms

Made the neighbor aware that it’s coming over to our side very strongly 

None of this has worked. We sadly can’t move for another couple years until my husband gets a raise at work. Any other ideas? 
People in my life have told me to let the landlord know (my old neighbor), I have her number and she told me to let her know if anything needs to be addressed, and also told me ahead of time that they are smokers but they can’t smoke inside because she knew I was pregnant and didn’t want this to happen. I don’t want to start neighbor wars or get anyone in trouble. Just want other tips to help with the smell. ",4,1743556055.0,homeowners,24,0.83,False

**Space / Vacuum bags for clothes, blankets, anything soft.**  They have both reduced the space of those things and also been an efficient way of packing clothes.  If you are going to use them, though, make sure you either have a vacuum with an attachment to suck the air out or buy a set with a plug in air sucker thing.   A lot of them sell them with a hand pump it's not going to work as well and add a lot of time.  I've had good luck with the brand ""Storage Master""

Have a jar for coins:  The amount of change I've found cleaning out drawers, moving furniture, etc. is shocking.  I've nearly filled a decent sized jar at this point.  The Safeway store near me has a thing you can dump change in and it counts it and gives you the amount in dollars.  Coinstar.  They seem to be at a lot of grocery stores.  

Don't pack your coffee maker (in my case, I'm a tea drinker so electric kettle) until the very end.  In fact, I'm not packing my electric kettle at all, bringing it in the car, because our stuff could get delayed, I'm not going that long without tea. ",4,1743555617.0,moving,1,0.84,False
1jpc3mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jpc3mk/found_and_lost/,Found and Lost,"Someone suggested taking photos of myself to document changes, and I did try. I took pictures of my face, my arms and hands, my torso, and my legs. On my chest right in the center I have this large freckle. Honestly it'd be better to call it a birthmark, but it's been there all my life. It's something I've always been a little self conscious about and it was in the photo I took. But when I checked myself this morning, it was gone, all that was left behind was rough skin, almost like a scar? 



I spent a good thirty minutes bouncing between having the mother of anxiety attacks, and just touching the skin where that mark used be. When I finally checked the photo, all it showed was the weird scar. No birthmark looking thing, nothing but that scar, like the mark had never been there, so... not only is that plan a bust, but I don't know if I can trust my memories, pictures of memories, or anything.



That's the biggest reason I decided to visit the address I was given. I was in over my head with all this, I had no idea what to do and the thought that maybe at the end of the road there could be some help, a savior from this madness? It was an easy decision.



When I left my motel room I made sure to take everything I still had in my possession with me, I was terrified of the thought of coming back to it and having a repeat of my apartment. It wasn't much, just my phone, laptop, the clothes I'd been wearing, and my keys. But they were \*mine\* and I refused to lose anything else, I was determined not too.



When I plugged the address into google maps, though, something fucking bizarre happened - the app went all, I don't know how else to describe it, but glitchy. For a moment it froze, then it flickered and crashed. I tried it a second time, with the same results. On the third try it finally stuck, though the app kept flickering the entire time - like it wanted to crash but couldn't anymore.



It was a fairly long drive, a good forty minutes away from the motel I was staying at, so I decided to call Maddy, my boss, to let her know I wouldn't be coming in today. It was a call I didn't need to make. I'd called her personal number, it was easier to get in touch with her that way, and when she answered her first words were, ""Hello? Who is this?"" I was shocked, to say the least, and felt dread building in my gut. We had our numbers programmed into each others phones. She had this ridiculous ringtone set specifically for me, but here she was asking who I was? 



My first question was if she got a new phone, maybe she was doing that stupid 'new phone, who dis', thing? But she wasn't, she sounded confused, and a little defensive even when she said it was her regular phone, and questioned again who I was. When I told her who I was, and that I was calling to say that I wouldn't be able to come in today, that I was calling in sick, her response left me feeling numb, and the blood in my veins colder than ice.



She didn't know who I was, didn't know what I was talking about. She said no one by my name had \*ever\* worked at the store with her, in fact it was just herself and a few volunteers. Was this my weird way of trying to ask for a job? When I pushed, insisting that we'd just talked literally yesterday, she got angry, and my pleading with her to remember me ended in her hanging up.



I had to pull onto the side of the road after that. I couldn't breathe, couldn't think, couldn't do anything but feel the confusion and panic and devastation boiling inside of me. Distantly, I could hear someone screaming and cursing, and realized after a few beats it was me. I was sobbing, pounding on my steering wheel and, to be absolutely blunt, losing my shit.



It took a while for me to calm down enough to continue driving. There was a moment when I genuinely considered just saying 'fuck it' and staying there on the side of the road. What was the point after all? I had no home, no job, no cat. I was losing everything important to me and I had no idea why. I think that was what spurred me to continue though. The not knowing, not understanding why it was happening. That more than anything else. I wanted...no, I \*needed\* answers.



When I pulled up to the address, what I found had me feeling even more off kilter than I had previously. All that was there was a little shop, the outside looked like it had seen better days. Paint was peeling and there was a sign hanging above the door - I couldn't quite make out what it said, it was so faded and weathered. And on either side of the store were abandoned, broken down buildings that looked like they'd been left empty for years, decades maybe.



This was the address though, this was where the cop I had told me to go, so despite an intense amount of uncertainty on my part, I opened the shop door and went inside. 



When I opened the door I heard a faint chime, but when I looked around there wasn't a chime on the door, or even anything that might have indicated a motion activated sound. It was just a faded door. What popped out at me first were the dimensions, the size of the shop itself. Just looking around it made me feel queasy, like I was on a rollercoaster ride. It was like the walls and ceiling were too long and short at the same time, both variations occupying the same space in a way that made my head ache, and my eyes water.



The second thing I noticed were the lights, they flickered above, casting the shop interior in strange shadows, but there was no buzzing sound from them. There wasn't any sound, actually. No sound from the traffic outside, no sound from the flickering lights, no sound as I gingerly walked across the too soft feeling floor. It was like the entire space within absorbed sound, leaving nothing but abject silence in its wake.



I was about to call out, more just to hear something than out of any need to find someone, when I was grabbed from behind. I would have screamed, but whoever it was had the foresight to clap their hand over my mouth as they started dragging me past the counter and towards the door behind it.



I was putting up a struggle, who wouldn't, when I heard a voice hiss in my ear, ""What the \*fuck\* are you doing here? Are you insane?"" The tones less angry and more filled with a desperate urgency, ""Just stay quiet, and come with me."" Was whispered once I stopped trying to break free. I was turning to face whoever it was that had grabbed me, when I hard a sharp hiss of breath and found myself being yanked unceremoniously to the door, even as the door to the shop opened and another chime sounded, followed by a presence I can only describe as \*heavy\*. It felt like being in the space as whoever had just entered was a weight on my bones, pressing me down until I couldn't move.



I likely would have stayed rooted to the spot I was in if it hadn't been for the person dragging and literally shoving me through the door. I stumbled to a stop inside what looked like a break room. There was a coffee pot, and one of those older bulky tvs affixed to the wall that was playing static. 



Beyond that there were people, several people, that stood or sat in groups around the room, a room that was larger than it had first seemed. They stared at me, and I stared back until I found myself being spun around by my attacker, or maybe my last chance at surviving this. Meeting their gaze, I noticed that their eyes were the same flat brown shade mine were. I think they noticed as well, because their expression shifted from anger, to confusion, and finally to sympathy. 



Whatever he saw in my eyes, it was obvious he'd seen it before, maybe lived it before.



""Ah, shit. I remember that look. Didn’t think I’d see it again so soon. You got it's attention, didn't you?”



I stared at him for a second, feeling overwhelmed and confused before answering.



""What does that even mean? What fucking look? What does that even have to do with anything?""



Before I could keep yelling, and it \*was\* yelling, panicked unthinking yelling a hand clamped down firmly over my mouth, silencing me and leaving me staring wide eyed at the man. 



""Look, I know everything happening is probably confusing, frightening for you. But you're going to have to keep your \*fucking\* voice down, you understand me?""



I didn't really have any choice other than to nod, even as my eyes darted around looking for some sign that someone might intervene, the people around us, they all stayed silent. Some were watching us with interest, other seemed utterly unaware we were even there. The man, seeing my gaze, maybe realizing what I was searching for, scoffed, a bitter sound that spoke of a hard earned knowledge.



""You're not gonna find any help from them, don't bother. It doesn't matter anyway, this room, right here."" At that he gestured around the break room, that seemed simultaneously filled with people and oddly empty at the same time. The harder I stared, the more confusing it became until the man shook me by the shoulders, grabbing my attention, ""This is the only safe place you'll find. Nothing can get in here. Now, listen, that thing out there - I know you fucking felt it - but that thing, it's after you. It doesn't want to kill you, that'd be too kind of it. No, no, what it wants to do is eat the \*essence\* of what you are. Who you are. Your memories, your thoughts, the memories of you. It's going to eat, and eat, and eat until there's not a goddamned thing left. Nothing to ever say you were here. That you existed. That you fucking \*mattered\*""



I wanted to call him a liar, call him crazy, call this whole goddamned thing a twisted joke. But he was right, I \*had\* felt it.



""I...I don't know what I felt, I didn't see anything - anyone""



""You had it right the first time with 'anything'. What's out there isn't a person, it doesn't think like a person does, or feel like a person does. It's just...hunger incarnate.""



He shook his head then, looking me up and down before heaving out a weary sight, ""You've got two choices ahead of you, and I'll tell you now neither one of them is easy. You can fight to survive, fight to stay real, to exist. Or you can give up, and become one of them.""



At that he gestured towards the people that hadn't yet acknowledged me, hadn't acknowledged anything really. They were...it wasn't that they were see through, it was more that there presence in the world was like an echo of a thing, like a memory of a memory, and all that was left was the blank people before me.



I was staring, maybe a little too long, when the nearest woman finally turned her head to face me. She still wasn't looking at me, it was more like she was looking through me, but when she spoke, I knew it was directed at me alone. ""You think you matter....you think you're real...you won't. Not for much longer...maybe you never did."" 



My stomach churned as she spoke, not just because of what she said, but her voice. It was soft, but rough and crackling, like someone had recorded a woman speaking, then recorded that same sound over, and over onto different tapes until all that was left was a copy of a copy. Was that what was happening to me? What I'd become? What was the point of fighting if that's what was at the end of the road.



It was another shake from the man before me that yanked me out of my downward spiral. 



""Just ignore her, ignore them. Her and the rest like her, they stopped fighting. Some gave up. Some didn’t even know they were losing until it was too late. Now they just sit there, waiting to disappear completely. They’re already ghosts, all they're doing is waiting for the room to soak up what's left.""



As he said that, above us the lights - that had up to that point been steady if muted - began to flicker, and on the static filled tv screen flashes of an unsettling familiar room began to drift in and out of the crackling static. My living room, but warped, twisted, in a way I couldn't put a name to. In a way I didn't \*want\* to name.



Jerking my gaze from the tv I looked back to the man I blurted out, ""You said it was safe in here, right? That nothing can get in here?"" 



I'm not ashamed to admit my voice was shaking, that I was crying. His own eyes were wide, filled with a helpless sort of fear...and a strange determination, as he met my gaze.



""Nothing \*can\* get in here, that doesn't mean it can't try to make us come out.""

This is a long story but I want to make it short.

I met this guy last year in April in the library and we opened up a lot, very fast. He eventually introduced me to a lot of his friends and family and we talked more (started going to his church). He's one of those very argumentative guys who has strong beliefs and rarely negotiates (loves to debate types and laugh at you for not agreeing with him). I didn't see this side of him until things settled down.

I gave him a lot of advice regarding girls and career stuff etc. I came to him for advice like once regarding a job interview I had even though he doesn't have experience with interviews (he works at a movie theatre and I work in a high rise office. im not putting him down when I say this for your information but he hints at wishing he could do my type of job). The other day, the topic of politics came up and he mentioned how he is a republican and asked what I support and I said democrat. He said he guessed its probably because my father was a democrat and I said yes, partially but not entirely because of my father. He laughed and said how much (in terms of influence) ? I said I wouldn't quantify it and then he said ok ""I'm gonna assume a lot"" and started to tell me about how everything ive agreed with is basically what republicans support. it sounded like he was trying to convince me, subtly - even started telling me to go read more on DJT and what he stands for and to not listen to media's that destroy his reputation.

The next day, over text, I addressed the part where he assumed im solely a democrat because of my father and said ""Hey Charles, I didn’t appreciate how you tried boxing me in yesterday when you said you believe the reason I’m liberal is solely due to my father after I told you I didn’t want to go into politics. An apology will suffice"". This sparked conflict and asked me to meet him in person which I did. But he sent this before we met that evening when we went back and forth :

""Ok. See you next time. Consider this friendship over. But I’m looking forward to taking about what you didn’t like about what I said and, if warranted, an apology will be made. Things will be cordial and amicable moving forward, but this friendship is over my dear bro. You are my brother in Christ, but a friendship is out of the question. I’ll hit u up for next time. I’m looking forward to it.""

I ended up going to meet. I bought us both coffee at Starbucks and sat on a couch with him. In person, he insulted my character, raised his voice and said I only asked him to apologize because I have low self esteem and low confidence and how I want to bring him down to my level by forcing an apology and submit, how he doesn't trust me, how I love to argue, how controlling I am etc. I told him he's wrong about me and im not doing that and even mentioned the things ive done for him that were in his best interest like uplift him (not to come off as bragging but to dismantle his argument and show him my perspective).

After he left. I sent him this :

I don’t feel bad about myself Charles nor do I have low self esteem. I'm ok the way I am, Charles even much better than others

This apology thing bothered you that much, to the point where you began insulting me and throwing all kinds of bad words in my direction. 

People do things in their life, sometimes bad sometimes good, even you joke about it when it happens. 

But you took it seriously today (even the texting) and threw unnecessary bad words against my character. Non stop.

I’m not interested in ever being friends after this. I don’t deserve this type of treatment and disrespect. Ciao for now"".

Its been almost 9 weeks of no contact and i've stopped going to that specific church (I get texts from people at church saying they miss me and asking if everything is alright but I just say ive been busy with work and school stuff to avoid drama). When he sees me in passing he just nods my head or actually gives me a pound with his fist and says ""hey what's up Adam"". AITA ?",2,1743555570.0,AITAH,0,0.76,False

1jpc24t,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jpc24t/nf_kilimanjaro/,[NF] Kilimanjaro,"The longest night

Day 5:
The alarm on my watch trills at quarter to midnight  and I wake with instant purpose. Wrestle with clothes, take about half the contents of my daysack out; It is time to prioritise lightness over being well-equipped. Then carelessly stuff the rest of my gear in the holdall. 

Pankaj, my Ugandan-Indian tentmate remains in the depths of sleep. 70 years old, wiry and the pride of his 2 daughters on the trip, he has met the challenge of the mountain with relentless endurance but his fatigue is too great . He will not summit today. 

My legs shoot me forward out of the tent and from pushup position my arms propel me up from the dirt, this effort makes me pant. I look up to a sky dense with unfamiliar stars and make my way over as one of the first to the mess tent. The warmth of the gas lamps are refuge from the biting frostless night.

The bleariness of the Masai staff contrasts with their usual irrepressible cheerfulness and I sit wordless running numbers, calculating the effort in an attempt to ration up my mental reserve. As I see it, 1300m vertical equals 1 Ben Nevis, with half the oxygen in the air. or 26 times up the 15 flights up to P floor at the Hallamshire Hospital that I accustomed myself to doing when dad was there, close to the end.

We have biscuits and fruit and tea then listen intently to our briefings. I am irked there is no coffee. Then I think how water, toilets, tents and everything else is carried up the mountain with the manpower of 9 stone locals paid 10 dollars a day who rely on ugali [porridge] as food. The contrast between their toil and my laziness and comfort is jarringly obscene. I can do without coffee.

Natalie arrives in the tent, looking a little pained, eventually to be joined by the others. She has felt the altitude for a few days but she’s OK enough. She was the reason I was here. The one who asked me to come. The one I craved for. The one who quite unknowingly dragged me out of numbness into a world of yearning, of vividness, of hope and of pain. 

Half past midnight and time to go. I feel the 4 days hiking in my legs now. Already, lights snake up the face above, the sole distinguishable feature in the substantive blackness of a moonless night. In the short amble to the Barafu camp sign, I become breathless to the bottom of my lungs. My blood oxygen has dropped 10 percent overnight. My head hurts and my stomach constricts painfully as my body knows what it has to do. Maintain core functions. Survive. Digestive function is surplus. Survival isn’t my mind’s priority though. The peak is.

A sign reads “Dear Esteemed Climbers. Do not push yourself to higher altitudes if you have breathing problems, persistent headaches…”  I feel a jab of fear and seriously consider heading back to camp. But I carry on with a feeling like doing something stupid at school I would have to explain to the headmaster later. Steadily up the loose rock switchbacks behind head guide Benjamin. Weakest at the front is the rule and so that’s where I stay. Every step feels like I’ve just been sprinting. I don’t think much of my chances to make the summit now. But no, I must fight this fight. Even though I feel almost punch drunk, one good blow from knockout, like many a boxer I will not concede defeat. It’s for someone else to throw in the towel.

We are overtaking groups while I struggle to hang on to the pace at all. Every time we have to divert from the track to steeper ground to overtake is a further push towards absolute exhaustion of the reserves of mind and body. Finally we stop to gulp water between breaths and contend with the nausea to force a few chocolate hobnobs down. And we offer each other comfort, jokes and compare hardships. Most of us met on a trip to Mt Toubkal. Coming out of Covid times, rediscovering the intensity of close company, it was a trip more joyous than anything before or since and we know each other well from it. Benjamin sees my state and takes my bag, he has 3 now. With the ever thinning air the facade each of us show to the world is cracking. 

Benjamin tells us we’re getting close to Stella Point, where the path meets the great crater at the top of the dormant volcano. It has to be true… I need it to be true. Then the rising full moon at half four casta pallid light on the mountain face, revealing the lie. The face still looms large above us. I can’t bear to look up so I keep my head down from then, rocks are skipping about in my vision and I watch carefully to see what stays fixed so that I know it’s real and not hallucinated. I cannot stumble, they will send me down and all the money and effort will be for nothing, another proof of my worthlessness, another mountain of the many I turned my back on. The guides sing in Swahili “Jambo, Jambo Bwana…”, I try feebly to join in. It’s hypnotising and annoying and a welcome distraction from the breath and the pain.

Anna is crying, she is determination and fragility and shyness and boldness. Contradictions tangled together at war with each other. I try and offer what comfort I can and tell her I believe in her. I really hope Anna doesn’t crack, we talked about her love of theatre and performing music and Camus lower down the mountain and I’ve grown to like her deeply. We are exactly as awkward as each other. Her boyfriend James, she tells me, had to go back. He was hallucinating that he was covered in blood and begging to descend. He is lean and fit, keen on Wim Hof’s ice baths and breathing exercises so it didn’t occur to me to doubt he would summit. James and I had a memorable day earlier in the year in the mountains above Glencoe’s lost valley. We descended a steep gully full of loose rock and were lucky to escape with just a few cuts, especially when a football-sized rock quickly gathered speed towards him and missed by inches. I was freaking out, near cragfast just above. 

We stop for sweet tea and respite. They said we would have tea at Stella Point but we are still not here. No matter how close we get the distance feels agonising as moving gets even more laboured. Natalie and I talk closely. She thought she saw Steve who is falling off the mountainside. Steve runs the trip and he is all working class shamelessness, borderline alcoholism and Turkey teeth. One of 3 from Merseyside on the trip. The first hints of sunlight show in the sky. The girlboss veneer in Natalie is cracking, she throws the tea away in a temper. She is pretty sick but her determination is abundant.

Finally, relief. I think Stella Point is where the ridge is silhouetted but Benjamin points to some lights below where it actually is, we have nearly arrived. I walk the final steps, near collapse on a rock, doubling over to get breath. 

From now, I know reaching the summit will be little more effort than staying upright. There is a bit of uphill labour to gain the top of the crater but the path is wide now and we split. Kieron, a witty curly haired PT gains the front, he is one of the scousers.  Mike follows behind, almost as if taking this in his stride. His absolute placidity and stamina is almost unnerving. Peak fever hits and I want to be first man but Kieron has more in him than I do. I drop back and talk to Natalie again, my heart warms at our togetherness. I can’t find words that are fitting to this transcendent moment. We walk as the sun reaches over the top of the horizon of vast yellowed Tanzanian planes some 250 miles away. The summit glaciers are majestic and white to our left and below in the far reaches of the crater to the right too. The sky glows orange to welcome the day. Mt Meru is still in darkness and pierces the horizon ahead. 

I push ahead now and leave her. She has been distant recently so I fight off the urge to keep her company. I can’t see the rest of the party behind. Then over the ridge I see it finally, the place I have seen so often but thought was impossible for me to reach. The highest freestanding summit in the world. Uhuru, Kilimanjaro. Somehow, I have hauled all 16 stone of myself up here to the top of Africa. Surprisingly we were a strong party and make it in 5:45. Some of those straggling below might take 9 hours. Kieron and Steve greet me with hugs and I drink in the whole of the view on a perfect blue-sky day. The hundred mile triangular shadow accentuates the vastness of the great mountain. I wait to see who has made it. Everyone else who set off today has done it, I hug them all, to the last they have fought their own battle to the top. Vic has struggled despite this being her second trip here, her blue lips showing the lack of oxygen in her body. Last is Isha, Pankaj’s daughter. She is so proud and cries wishing her dad made it with her. When I wonder away from the summit for a picture the emotion blindsides me too. Finally I connect with  what this moment means to me. I am proud to be here. I wish my parents were here to tell about this.",1,1743555469.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I started in re brokerage back in 2019, and I’ve been working full-time as an agent since then. In January 2024, I decided to go back to school to finish my degree and I’m on track to graduate in May 2026 with a focus on real estate.

I’ve been trying to break into the corporate side of the industry – ideally roles like acquisitions, asset management, valuation, or anything on the finance/analyst side. I’ve been targeting about major real estate/ investment firms and messaging professionals who accept my LinkedIn connection requests to ask for informational interviews or quick coffee chats.

One thing I’m wondering: for those of you already in these roles – is it weird when someone who cold-messaged you on LinkedIn ends up getting hired and you run into them at the office? Did they say anything or was it awkward? Did they bring up the fact that you didn't respond?

Also still trying to get an internship for this summer so if you have any advice on that or any tips for making cold LinkedIn messages more effective, I’m all ears. lol 

Appreciate any advice or stories. Trying to be thoughtful about how I’m networking and breaking into the space.

Thanks!
