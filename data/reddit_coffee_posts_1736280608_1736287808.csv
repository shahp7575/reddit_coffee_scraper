The crisp, cool air, the solitude, and the breathtaking views make it an unforgettable experience. Unlike the scorching heat of summer, the desert in winter is peaceful and inviting—perfect for long nights under the stars and cozy mornings in the camper.

This shot captures my setup: my Jeep and camper, ready for whatever the desert throws my way. There’s nothing like waking up to the stillness of the desert, brewing a fresh cup of coffee, and watching the sun rise over the dunes.

Desert winters aren’t just about beauty they’re a reminder of simplicity and self-reliance. Who else loves desert camping this time of year? Let’s see your favorite setups or hear about your best winter camping spots!",3,1736287280.0,TruckCampers,0,1.0,False

1hw36pp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hw36pp,Bellamy's Story,"Hello again,
As I posted before about my baby girl Bella. So, this is her story:

Me and my husband intended to give our 3 years old Staffy ""Queen"" a sister (We never want to know if she is a pure or mix but for sure, she will always be the Queen of the house 😁)

The day of Queen's vet visit, we met with a colleague of my husband whom his father's female dog just gave birth to 10 puppies. The 6 of the puppies didn't survived that day as another 4 were in critical conditions. 

We witnessed the puppies in 2 different boxes. And my heart dropped to see how they were sleeping peacefully and the 4 survivors cried for milk. 

And all of a sudden, the man asked me if I would like to adopt one, as his parents would not be able due to their old age to take care of the uncertain 4 survivors. So I asked if among these puppies, he has a female one. And he said yes, the only one. I kissed her that day and said ""you are mine and just LIVE! 

I admit, I can't take my mind of her and mind me... I cried after a month later, I heard only 3 survived but she was still alive. So, in purpose I went to the office where the man works (nearby where i live) to ask about her. And the news I got was shocking. They lose hope either any of the puppies would ever survived. The man refused my help as i asked if the puppies need milk as the mother was still in critical conditions and not able to breastfeed them. So, I said.. I believe the 3 will survive and live. And I named Bellamy Grace for the puppy I kissed that day. And he just smiled but still I can see no hope on his eyes. 

I prayed man... I prayed with tears in my eyes that she and the 2 brothers WILL SURVIVE though after back and forth treatments and check ups along with the mother. Then, during my trip home from my work's event to another city, my husband texted if I still want to adopt Bella with no guarantee of survival. And ofc, DEFINITELY YES!! 

Couple of days before she reached 3 months old, she was delivered to my hands. I cried and I hugged the man and his mother with full gratitude of trusting me to adopt her. Just by the Grace of God, she and the 2 brothers survived. (Because I believed on what I said and stick my faith to it) 

The next day, I got her checked at the vet (the same vet where my Queen always went) the vet who helped the labour was happy that we adopt her and yes, she is definitely HEALTHY and going strong 💪

She is going 6 months this 22th. Registered, chipped, has insurance and going to day care. She is so friendly towards human as well as with dogs. And yes, we are happy as Queen finally got a little sister she can play with and sleep with 😁

Pic 1 : Queen and Bella with their judgement looks 👀
Pic 2 : After day care on rainy days 😬
Pic 3 : one of the positions how they sleep together 😴
Pic 4 : with one of her besties (Zeus, 1 years old Red Nose) 🐕 at the park

Thank you for your time reading my baby's girl story. It was a struggle yet with a beautiful ending.

Paws 🐾 love for everyone!

1hw35no,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hw35no/stargate_and_gate_inspired_manifest_fantasy/,[Stargate and GATE Inspired] Manifest Fantasy Chapter 31: The One That Got Away,"**Author’s Note:**



I'm back! Starting Chapter 33, uploads will be half the length but twice as frequent. Instead of one big chapter every two weeks, it's basically one (half-size) chapter every week.



[FIRST](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/s/yl8E7gpzo3)

– –



Well, fuck. Henry set the thought of smokeless powder aside. Today just kept getting better. “Copy that, Professor. Any indication where they went?”



“A stable hand observed a carriage departing in the midst of the battle, taking the principal exit from the Academy grounds into the city.”



“So it’s either still in the city, or long gone…”



“I cannot say with certainty whether they remain within the city’s bounds or have fled further afield. Sir Orlen! Have you any word of carriages beyond the gates?”



Henry glanced at the dropping EMF levels while Elwes conferred with Orlen. The levels were low enough that Elwes could reach them from the Academy – obviously, given their current conversation – but still high enough that they’d be shit outta luck trying to track inert artifacts through the ambient mana. 



“Captain Donnager, it seems three carriages departed the city but minutes past, all upon the western road.”



“Alright. Anything else?”



“They were of wood, their canopies white, or so I am told.”



How original. Might as well call it a ‘carriage with wheels’ since they’re a dime a dozen. In a city this size, brown wooden carriages were about as distinctive as Honda Civics in LA. “Well, that *sure* narrows things down.”



Elwes chuckled softly behind the radio. “It is scarce the most useful detail, I grant you. Yet if none other have departed, I daresay we may consider that convoy our quarry.”



“Yeah, fair enough. Thanks, Professor. We’ll report it up the chain.”



The interference had finally gotten low enough for them to reach Armstrong. He switched channels. “Armstrong, this is Alpha Actual, over.”



“Alpha Actual, Armstrong. Send it, over.”



“Armstrong, rune system’s neutralized, but we’ve received report of a security breach at Hogwarts. Possible target: three brown carriages with white canopies, westbound main road, departed city limits recently. Request ISR on route and connectors. Break. Request ground units establish checkpoints; risk of carriage dump post-clearance. We can move to investigate or continue SSE at current location. How copy, over?”



The crinkle of a bag accompanied the response. “Alpha Actual, solid copy. Stand by, over.”



Henry glanced at the inert core sitting beside Sera. They’d already bagged and tagged the core, along with samples of the orichalcum wiring and those celisyrin vines they’d used as conductors. Between the rune system, the fyrite, and those treants, this site was a goldmine for R&D. If the Doc’s excitement was any indicator, Lamarr and Perdue were sure to go crazy over all this.



The chip guy came back after a minute. “Alpha Team, you’re cleared to pursue. We have a Reaper on station tasked for route recon, ETA three minutes. We’ll send over a collection team to pick up the site exploitation work. Armstrong, out.”



Going into a pursuit while low on ammo wasn’t the best idea, but allowing the Nobians to secure Baranthurian artifacts was, without question, worse. “Alright, y’all heard Chippy. Let’s get moving.”



Ron snorted. “Chippy?”



“Yeah, guy’s infamous at this point. Lieutenant Callahan, or something.” Henry got in his MRAP, strapping in. “Sera, Kel, y’all good on mana?”



Their confirmation came as a relief. Even if they didn’t have TOW missiles to lob at the enemy, they’d at least have *some* utility available. Maybe some light environmental manipulation didn’t take too much? Or they just had crazy capacities. Given what Kel had said about how many Earth Artillery spells he could cast, it was probably the latter.



The dense forest gave way to patchy woodland as they backtracked their route in. Three carriages. Knowing the Nobians, it wouldn’t be easy finding the stolen artifacts. Hell, they could probably consider it a lost cause by now. 



The road emerged from the treeline as Isaac spoke up. “We’ve got eyes on the road. Got two carriages along the main road – about a klick south of Armstrong.”



“Two? Where’s our third?” Ryan asked.



""All stations, Watchdog Three. Five carriages matching description on the main trade route toward Grenden, spread over three klicks. Four more matches on alternate routes, plus four carriages not matching description. Continuing to monitor main route and alternates. Stand by for target track data. Over.""



Henry could already see where this was going. Plus a few more *not* matching the description? Shit, he’d bet on a handoff – or several, given they were dealing with Nobians. 



“Watchdog Three, Alpha Actual. Any chance of IDing which ones came from the Academy? Henry’s voice didn’t even come out frustrated. Honestly, this was just one of those times when he saw bullshit and had to begrudgingly deal with it. 



“Alpha Actual, that’s negative. Will update if we spot any deviations or new targets.”



Henry glanced at his display. They wouldn’t catch shit at this rate – hell, they probably wouldn’t even have the time to set up a checkpoint. And that was assuming the Nobians didn't have cloaked assassins waiting to ambush them whenever they stopped. There was no telling if the cargo even *was* on the carriages at this point. For all he knew, cloaked riders could be halfway to the border already.



Henry checked the map overlay in his IVAS. Watchdog had tagged the closest pair of carriages barely a klick ahead. The forest road was narrow but well-maintained – good ambush territory, honestly. Trees pressed in close on both sides, giving maybe fifteen feet of clearance.



The RWS feed remained unsettlingly devoid. The calm before the storm, the deafening silence; his gut knew the feeling well enough. “Sera, Kel – you see anything, focus on defense. Don’t wait for orders.”



Their acknowledgments came as they rounded a gentle curve. The road ahead was clear for about two hundred meters before bending right.



Then the ground directly ahead of them erupted. Not even time for a warning – just suddenly there was a fucking ramp where flat road had been not even a second ago. They hit it at forty miles an hour. 



The MRAP’s front left tire caught the slope and the whole vehicle lurched sideways. For a split second they balanced on two wheels, then momentum took over. 



“Shit shit SHIT–”



The world spun, Henry's body straining against his restraints as the MRAP rolled. Impact came with a massive crash that slammed his head into the RWS controls. Gravity pulled him right; the vehicle must have rolled onto its passenger side. His left window showed sky, the right one nothing but dirt and crushed grass.



The first arrows hit before his ears stopped ringing. Sharp crack-snaps against the top and undercarriage as what he assumed to be wind snipes hammered their armor, followed by the sound of splintering shafts skittering across the plating. Most of the arrows seemed to hit their underside. A few glanced off the forward windshield at bad angles, leaving small spider-web cracks but nothing serious.



“Nobians,” Sera hissed. A barrier of rock materialized between them and the tree line just as thick smoke started billowing around both vehicles.



Good – that meant Sera was fine. “Owens?”



“Still breathing,” Ron grunted, gripping the sidewall to brace himself as the other MRAP’s turret lit up. Bursts came sporadically; after their fiasco with the Vorikha Apex, they didn’t exactly have a ton of ammo to work with.



Henry keyed his mic. “Armstrong, Alpha Actual. MRAP flipped, ambushed at grid 3 klicks southwest. Enemy cloaked, deploying smoke as defense. No visual on hostiles, assuming heavy contact. Holding position. Request ISR focus on grid for hostile tracking, QRF and immediate CAS. Over.”



The ISR part was more wishful thinking, since they literally had a drone over them this whole time and it still couldn’t find a thing, but maybe the Nobians would slip up. Even being able to identify where the arrows were generally coming from could be useful information.



The response crackled through almost immediately. “Alpha Actual, Armstrong. Solid copy. ISR prioritizing your pos now. QRF alert initiated, ETA 15 mikes. Thunder 1-2 en route for Close Air Support, ETA 6 mikes. ISR confirms no thermal signatures; attempting to track projectiles on release – no direct fix on cloaked targets. Over.”



Thunder 1-2, here to save the day yet again. How many drinks would Henry owe now? “Armstrong, Alpha Actual. Copy all. Confirm Thunder will suppress northeast treeline,” he said, selecting the area where most of the arrows had come from.



“Solid copy, Alpha Actual. Armstrong, out.”



Henry shared the news to his team. “Thunder’s inbound, eight mikes. Watch the smoke; conserve ammo. We’ll just have to hunker down ‘til support gets here.”



A new volley came in, arrows producing dull thunks against Sera’s stone barrier. An occasional crack still rang out when an arrow arced over the stone walls and landed atop their flipped MRAP, but most of the subsequent barrages were caught by the wall. Outside, the smoke from Kelmithus’ spell still churned thick and gray.



Then it winded down. The next volley never came. Five, ten, fifteen seconds – nothing. No one ever emerged through their smokescreen, either. Unless they found a way to phase through the smoke without parting it, it seemed as if the Nobians had just… given up. One more arrow struck Sera’s wall with that distinctive thud, then nothing. 



A minute dragged by. No more impacts. The smoke continued to swirl, but the unnerving drone in the back of his mind only grew. Funny, wasn’t it? How the absence of arrows somehow felt worse than the rain of them. It was a vacuum of sound that pulled every thought toward worst-case scenarios. There was no relief – only anticipation under the facade of calm. Just what the hell could they be planning?



Henry got his answer almost immediately as an unnaturally loud voice boomed, seemingly coming from everywhere at once. “To those who oppose us, heed my words. You are surrounded, and your plight is dire. Cease your struggle, and we may yet speak as men of reason.”



*Seriously?* Movie villain monologue wasn’t quite what he expected, but fuck it. Six minutes ‘til air support, and if this guy wanted to chat, he might as well run with it. But… how?



He glanced at his door. Opening it would be pretty stupid – one lucky wind snipe and he’d sport the same cut as the Headless Horseman. He dug through his pack, pulling out his field notebook. Not ideal, but it’d work. Cracking the door just enough, he wedged it with the manual.



“If I may,” Sera whispered, “I might amplify your voice with the wind.”



Henry nodded. Now, what to say? These guys didn’t really state who they were, but there was only one faction that had the ability to launch cloaked surprise attacks. Might as well try to confirm. “Nobian commander, you are engaging U.S. military forces. Stand down and identify yourself!”



“Ah, Captain Donnager. I had hoped our paths might cross again, though I confess I expected your ingenuity would spare you such a predicament. Tell me, how fares your pursuit of phantoms and shadows?”



That voice. Henry knew that voice. It sounded so familiar. Coupled with his impression of a villain monologue earlier, it had to be someone he’d interacted with. The cadence of it nagged at him for a moment before his brain made the connection. The formal speech patterns, that aristocratic tone that somehow managed to sound arrogant and condescending in any situation – yeah, he’d met only one Nobian who talked like that: their friend from GB-2, the one who’d tried to shake them down for their Holding Bags.



“*Carvus*. I’d say the pursuit’s going just fine – turns out phantoms and shadows bleed like anyone else. But since you’re so keen to talk, how about starting with your intent?”



“Intent, Henry? Surely it is not beyond your reckoning. Yet, if I must state it plainly: it is to forestall your dogged pursuit of that which lies beyond your grasp. I regret only that force was required to teach so simple a lesson.”



“You know, Vicearch, I believe some lessons can be delivered only through force. I reckon the Sonarans wouldn’t mind if they lose some artifacts permanently, especially if it teaches you and your buddies a lesson.”



“You presume much, Captain. How many lives would you hazard upon such fragile certainty? Those carriages may bear what you seek. Or they may belong to traders, innocents ensnared by your suspicion. Will you risk so great a cost for so little assurance?”



Innocents? Really? What a fucking tool. Henry almost laughed at the hypocrisy. “Funny you’d care about civilians after Hardale; after the Academy. But sure, let’s play your game – city’s been locked down for a while. Our chances are looking pretty damn good.”



“Be that as it may, the Nobian Empire will not suffer such insolence unchallenged. Should you destroy those carriages, you invite war, Captain – war which neither you nor your allies are prepared to endure. Mark me well, for the wrath of the Empire will reach far beyond these woods.”



Four minutes. As much as Henry wanted to dismiss it, war wasn’t an empty threat. Sure, they had better tech; Thunder 1-2 could probably level this forest in one pass, but what good was air superiority against an enemy they couldn’t even target? 



Even now, stuck in this MRAP with Carvus chatting like they were at a coffee shop, Henry had no idea where a single one of his soldiers was. No thermals, no movement, no parting smoke, nothing.



And that was just a small unit. Like yeah, they could probably take out their emperor once they got their Typhon up and running with its cruise missiles, but how would the 3 or 4 thousand personnel in Armstrong deal with a hostile empire likely numbering in the tens of millions? They’d get overrun.



Still, the fact that Carvus was pulling a stunt like this; that the Nobians at large were still playing the clandestine game instead of leveraging that massive advantage… something wasn’t adding up. Maybe they’re not confident in a fight against both them and the Sonarans? At the very least, it’d explain why the Nobians hadn’t reacted more forcefully, even despite the possibility of losing their geopolitical status quo. 



Ruins grabbed by the U.S. and the Sonaran Federation; new technology forcing the Nobian Empire’s hand. Yeah, maybe.



“You and I both know *damn* well that it’s your Empire that’s scrambling around, desperately holding on to whatever power it can. You’re afraid – afraid of a new player. It’s a shame you weren’t more like the Sonarans. We could’ve had peace. And we still can, but that depends on you.”



“A clever attempt to turn the board, Captain, but misplaced. The Sonarans’ claim to peace is but a mask, for they would have yielded their dominion were it their true aim. Whether your pursuit ends in fire or folly, I shall waste no more of my efforts upon you.”



Two minutes left. The faint thumping of helicopter rotors had already seeped into the MRAP. Carvus probably heard it too, hence his impatience.



“Sounds like a long way of saying you’ve got nothing left to offer. Or maybe you’re just trying to figure out how much you’ve already lost.”



“Think as you will. Your machines may mimic the power of high Tier magic, but they are finite. This exchange has served its end, and your words no longer hold value. You may depart unscathed this day, Captain, but the next time we meet – should you be so unfortunate – shall be your last.”



And just like that, the presence was gone. Yeah, they could’ve lingered around a bit longer, but Henry knew better than that. He wouldn’t be so lucky as to have his biggest thorn sit around just to get conveniently blown up. 



The thrum of rotors grew louder until Thunder 1-2 had entered the area of operations. “Thunder 1-2, Alpha Actual. Cleared hot on marked pos.”



The Apache thundered overhead as Henry peeked over the door. The chain gun opened up, loud enough that he could feel it in the air, the vibration resonating through the MRAP’s armor. Trees basically disintegrated as 30mm rounds tore through the treeline.



And hit absolutely nothing. Because of course they didn’t. As he’d suspected, the Carvus didn’t want to fuck around and find out. Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things he did, but he sure as hell knew *something* was coming to save them. This close to the base, he must’ve realized a siege wasn’t something worth risking.



“Alpha Actual, Thunder 1-2. Negative effect on target. No visual or thermal signatures. Repositioning for second pass, adjusting to eastward ingress. Over.”



Thunder swept around for another run. Same result - just more torn up forest. They could level the whole damn woods and probably wouldn't find a single Nobian boot print. But then again, they probably wouldn’t be able to find one anyway amidst all the craters.



Henry sighed. “Thunder 1-2, Alpha Actual. Cease engagement. Targets not present. Conserve ammunition. Over.”



“Alpha Actual, Thunder 1-2. Cease engagement acknowledged. Holding station until QRF arrival. Out.”



Henry swapped over to Armstrong’s channel. “Armstrong, Alpha Actual. Request ETA on QRF, over.”



“Alpha Actual, Armstrong. QRF ETA five mikes. Request SITREP when available, over.”



Henry gave Armstrong a quick rundown of the ambush – the Nobian trap, Carvus’ appearance, their withdrawal before air support arrived, and the mission failure.



“Alpha Actual, Armstrong. Solid copy. Debrief upon arrival. Keep QRF on station until you’re mobile. Armstrong, out.”



They’d unstrapped earlier to avoid fighting gravity and enable easier evacuation, but that just meant finding creative new ways to be uncomfortable. Henry shifted against the window, trying to find a position that wouldn’t have his spine screaming at him later. After some awkward maneuvering, he ended up in a half-crouch under the RWS controls while Sera got herself situated on what used to be the passenger seat's side panel. His ass was going numb already, but the setup worked well enough – well worth it, too, all thanks to Sera’s half smile. One of them might as well be somewhat comfortable while they waited for QRF to show up and unfuck their MRAP.



Despite the extra room up front, Ron ironically had it even worse. The driver’s area was an obstacle course turned sideways. Between the steering column, the radio stack, and all their gear that had migrated down with gravity, he was basically playing Tetris with his own body. Every time Henry glanced forward he could see Ron trying to find some magic configuration between two ammo cans and a pack of equipment.



“Alpha Actual, Raptor Actual. On approach. Three victors, recovery with us. ETA two mikes.”



Thank God. The sudden message was almost enough to send Henry to his knees – if he could even adopt such a position. “Raptor Actual, Alpha Actual. Copy. Ambush site’s clear for now – no contact since Thunder arrived. Smoke should be clear by now. Watch your approach.”



“Alpha Actual, solid copy. Eyes on. See you in two.”



The rumble of engines grew steadily louder until they ceased. The brief silence was followed by a silhouette appearing on their front windshield – Captain Lewis, the dude who was supposedly related to a basketball player. 



He knocked on the window. “Yo, Alpha! Perimeter’s secured. Y’all good to dismount.”



“Aight.” Henry climbed out. Around them sat three MRAPs – four, including Ryan’s – and an HEMMT wrecker. The lead vehicle had pulled up about thirty meters ahead while the other two had been split off to establish a perimeter alongside Ryan’s vehicle, all while giving enough space for the wrecker to operate.



Ron gravitated toward the recovery vehicle, probably hoping to speed things along. Sera drifted off to Ryan’s MRAP, no doubt to compare notes with Kel about the Nobians. 



Lewis called out to their recovery vehicle. “Ay, Couture! You’re up!” He turned back to Henry as the wrecker maneuvered into position. “We gon’ need ‘bout four, five mikes before we good to go. Anyway, the fuck happened here?”



Henry stepped back as the wrecker moved its crane. “Hit a magic ramp. You ever played those racing games with ramps? Like Asphalt? Same shit. And the rest? Well, you’ve probably already seen for yourself.” He rounded the vehicle, facing the undercarriage now.



A handful of arrowheads were stuck in the plating, shafts sticking out like toothpicks. Most of the arrows hadn’t even penetrated the armor, minor scars marring the surface where they ricocheted off. 



Lewis whistled. “Shit, bruh, the flip prolly did more damage than the arrows.”



Henry nodded silently.



“Man, I ain’t gon’ front – I was tryna get on one of them adventuring teams, though. Signed up for Bravo Team but shit, everything from Charlie to Foxtrot’s already locked down by Zulu-9 niggas, plus whoever else they bringin’ through from back home. Suppose it makes sense, since they been here the longest.”



To be fair, Zulu-9 did have an advantage beyond just being first in Gaerra. Henry let out a chuckle. “Not far off, but dude, Zulu-9s been grabbing people straight from The Unit, Green Berets, y’know? Probably won’t have too much luck unless you got a secret archaeology degree, or unless you’re from the 75th.”



“Shit, I am, actually. Second Batt for three years now.” Lewis grinned, sudden interest lighting his face like Superman himself had just descended to give him hope. “That help my chances?”



“Definitely does. But I heard they’ve got even weirder criteria now. When I first signed up, they asked me if I’d seen Stargate. I did, obviously, but now they’re apparently asking about DnD and anime. Thought it was a joke at first, ‘til I realized they were dead serious – something about familiarity, flexibility. Totally agree with them, though.” 



The wrecker’s arm stabilized the MRAP mid-lift, preparing to turn it over.



“For real?” Lewis faced away, pumping his arm. “Fuck yeah.”



“I mean, you still gotta wait for a slot to open up, though. I wouldn’t mind putting in a word for Golf Team.”



Lewis beamed back at him. “Y’know what, you a real nigga. ‘Preciate it, gang.” He dapped him up.



“Yeah, well, don’t thank me too early. My guess is they’re gonna have y’all do some fetch quests for Dr. Perdue – the shit Tier 2 parties be doing. Gather this herb, gather these stones, shit probably ain’t gonna be as fun as you think.”



“Bruh, you kiddin’ me? That’s like, the whole fantasy experience right there! Gathering reagents, learning the magic system, shit’s the dream, bro.”



Henry couldn’t argue. “Fair enough. Just don’t expect any quest markers or convenient NPCs telling you exactly where to go. And number one rule: wrap your willy.”



“Y’all seen a catgirl yet? Bunny girl?” Lewis’ eyes got even wider.



“Well, yeah. To both.”



A devious grin popped up on Lewis’ face. 



Henry smirked. “Aight, brother. You might think it’ll be worth it ‘til your shit burns, shrivels up, and then falls off.”



The grin dropped for a moment. “What, it’s happened already? Ain’t hear nothin’ from Perdue.”



“Hasn’t happened. I’m just sayin’.” 



The grin returned. “Ah, then fuck it; we ball.”



The wrecker’s hydraulics hissed as it retracted its arm, their MRAP finally settled back on its wheels.



“You do you, man. Just don’t come crying if your shit really does fall off,” Henry laughed, hopping back in his MRAP.



Ron clambered back into the driver’s seat while Henry helped Sera up. Once everyone was secure, Henry radioed a quick status check to Lewis’s team. Three MRAPs and the wrecker formed up around them, Lewis taking point while they headed back to Armstrong.



The drive back was mercifully uneventful, their little convoy rolling through forest roads in silence. All Henry could do was contemplate the day’s clusterfuck. What kept gnawing at him was Carvus’s play. The whole thing felt... performative. Like yeah, flipping their MRAP had been one hell of a statement, but then to just stand around and monologue?



He hadn’t really realized it until now, but the Nobians could’ve done way more. Two options stuck out: the first was that Carvus didn’t know how long it’d take to wipe them out, if at all possible given the MRAP’s armor. His forces had engaged MRAPs twice at this point, including the bandit attack and GB-2, and none had come close to inflicting lasting damage on their vehicles. He probably had some Tier 8 or higher magic in store that’d be able to do something, but didn’t want to risk it knowing that help was on the way.



The second was that Carvus wanted to relay his threat. It was significant enough to warrant a report to Armstrong, and maybe he thought it’d give them second thoughts about their relationship with the Sonarans. Ally with the Sonarans, and be dragged into a full-fledged war against a militaristic empire, or something of the sort.



Then there was the processing of failure – though ‘failure’ felt both accurate and somehow unfair at the same time. They’d failed to intercept, sure. But the more Henry turned it over in his mind, the more he saw the elegant brutality of the Nobian plan. Hit them during a monster stampede, when every spare unit was tied up in city defense. Use their own protocols against them – of course they’d have to respond to both threats. They’d also have to split their forces.



By now, the convoy had probably made it all the way to the Nobian border – nothing they’d risk crossing even though the Reaper could track the targets beyond that. Nothing they could do without adequate intel on what the Nobian Empire was actually like; what the territory beyond looked like.



Still, that nagging voice kept whispering: what if? What if he'd spotted the pattern earlier? He’d known there was a spy in the Academy, known the Nobians played these kinds of games. But then again, what would he have done differently? Ignored a possible terror attack? Let monsters rampage through civilian areas?



No, the real bitch of it was how perfectly they’d been boxed in. Every decision that led them here had been tactically sound, even necessary. And that was probably what Carvus had counted on. The smug bastard had practically engineered a scenario where they’d do exactly what they were supposed to do – and fail anyway. Or fail *because* of it.



They pulled into Armstrong's motor pool just as the sun was starting to think about setting. Time to break down exactly how thoroughly they'd been outmaneuvered. Not failed, really. Just... outplayed by an enemy who'd been setting up this chess game while they were still learning the rules.



Henry hated the taste of excuses – always had – but sometimes truth wore that same bitter flavor. The only way forward was to swallow both: the failure, and the fact that maybe, this time, the excuse and reality were one and the same.



The fact that General Harding understood this made the whole thing feel both better and worse. Interesting how validation somehow made the failure taste even more bitter. 



The General’s face held no accusation as Henry laid out the sequence of events. Then again, there was no time for accusation; only for working out a shitty hand that they’d had the misfortune of being dealt.



“Great,” Ambassador Perry sighed. “Thompson’s really gonna enjoy this.”



Harding barely even gave himself time to ruminate. “Not as much as President Keener himself, I’m afraid. How likely do you think it is that they’ll follow through?” He looked at Perry, then at Sinclair, eyes suggesting he was already bracing for an answer he didn’t want to hear.



Perry leaned back in his seat. “A nation as militaristic and hegemonic as them? Likely. Almost guaranteed, unless we can show that it won’t be worth their effort; if we can show them it’ll be pyrrhic or worse in the end.” 



Having dealt first hand with the Nobians, Henry didn’t doubt it. And Sinclair’s confirmation was the nail in the coffin. “Intel corroborates this, sir. The Nobians are wrapping up a conflict with a kingdom further west, near the coast. It might be a few years, give or take, until their resources are freed up.”



“Si vis pacem, para bellum… SecDef’s not gonna like my request for reinforcements.” General Harding rubbed his temples. “In fact, I think he’ll hate it. A year’s enough time to bring over a few divisions, but I suspect the President won’t take too kindly about having to explain why 50,000 men have vanished into Area 51 and haven’t resurfaced. We can handle the Nobians if push comes to shove, but…”



“Last resort,” Perry offered.



“Yup.”



Henry folded his arms. Yeah, that tracked. Not only would families start raising questions the government wouldn’t want to answer, but foreign relations would also go down the shitter.



The silence stretched until Perry finally thought up a recommendation. “I could… Well, the Sonaran Federation might be amenable to cooperation. At that point, it’s only a question of how much we’re willing to pay them.”



“Indeed,” Kelmithus remarked, “though, should the Council concede to such an arrangement, they will assuredly seek recompense – whatever technologies the Sanctum Arcanum deems of greatest value.”



Perry kept his diplomatic facade, even through his complaints. “I appreciate the honesty, Archmage. Technologies are a… fickle thing. Kickstarting an industrial revolution has its consequences – a double-edged sword. If they spread unchecked – which they will, be it through espionage or simple diffusion – it might empower the Nobians as much as your Federation. Still, the Council must see that mutual defense outweighs such risks.”



“Your point is well-taken, Ambassador. Be assured, the Council will indeed regard such a union as mutually beneficial. Yet they will, without doubt, seek that recompense. It is not their way to let opportunity pass unheeded, nor to suffer the Federation’s hand to be stayed by magnanimity.”



The Ambassador exhaled sharply through his nose, giving a slight chuckle. “Everyone wants to milk the cow dry, don’t they? Can’t say I blame them. Zero-sum games are, unfortunately, just another day in the office. Frankly, dealing with the Sonaran Federation would be a breath of fresh air. Much more receptive than a certain bunch who build walls – literal and figurative – around themselves and expect the world to marvel at their isolation.”



Harding caught the edge in his tone and smirked faintly. “Walls, huh? Sounds familiar.”



“Ovinnegard,” the Ambassador confirmed. “Brilliant tacticians, exceptional defenses, but impossible negotiators. Every meeting feels like trying to scale those damn peaks of theirs without so much as a rope.”



Kelmithus smiled, clearly amused. “Their obstinance is well-earned, Ambassador. The dwarves regard every negotiation as a trial of resolve. It is not their way to concede lightly, for to do so would betray the values of their forebears. Yet, I suspect, if you can but show them that the stakes are truly dire, their loyalty will be steadfast – unyielding as the stone they call home.”



“Which is a very diplomatic way of saying they’ll grind us into dust before they agree to lift a finger.” Perry turned to Henry. “Well then, I suppose now’s a good as time as any to relay the great news.”



Something about Perry’s voice set off every warning bell Henry had. ‘Great news’ delivered in that tone was about as trustworthy as a Nobian peace treaty.



“Hey now,” Perry held up a hand. Fair enough; Henry didn’t bother hiding his skepticism. “Maybe you’ll like this. Anyway, Ovinnegard’s offered two potential concessions – trade, or a favor. And before you ask, no, we don’t know what this ‘favor’ is yet. But if I had to guess, it’s likely some grand undertaking. Something only we can provide.”



Kel’s eyebrow went up. “The dwarves seldom barter without imposing a trial of merit. Such trials are their way of discerning true allies from opportunists. Whatever form this favor takes, it will speak to their values and ours. As warriors, they shall seek more than simple brute strength.”



“Possibly. Either way, they won’t discuss the favor until we meet them in person; they made that clear over the aethergraph. Which means… I’ll be tagging along when Alpha Team heads north.” Perry addressed Henry. “When will you be ready?” 



Henry recalled the schedule. “Tier 7 evaluation’s in a few days, just before New Year’s Eve. Sera will finish her training maybe a couple weeks after that, or a week, if we expedite some stuff, cut some corners.” 



“Alright then, you’ll have the time you need. Don’t let anything else cloud your head; focus on the certification. Dismissed.”

Looking for some advice on where to live. I’m young 30s adult who is single who will be working for Seattle children’s. Ideally I’d like a shorter commute but a neighborhood that’s walkable with my dog. My ideal would be a place that has a yard but I understand if that’s asking too much as my price range would be up to $2100.  I say a shorter commute and that’s involving a car! 

As far as neighborhood - it’d be cool to be able to walk to coffee shops/restraunts/ etc but also happy to be just in a safe neighborhood.

1) is there a solution for the lack of extra tire in the trunk? Anyone using ""run flat"" tires have noticed anything wierd while driving? Maybe in the USA or first world countries is not a problem but yeah, in latinamerica, streets are not so friendly and full with holes in the pavement.

2) Regarding ""comfort""...i usually drive around with coffee or any other drink, which i always put inside the cupholders of the console between front seats (i have a 2017 mazda 3) and in that car im.always driving with my girlfriend...but then I've noticed that 2025 Miata doesn't have cupholders in the console...it comes with some kind of removable cup holders, but if you're driving with a passenger and both of you have a drink...is it comfortable? Can u put the cup holders somewhere else or am I missing something? 😂

In the last two years I've been working hard at getting my miscellaneous spending under control - eating out less, getting coffee less, shopping less, going to concerts less, etc. I spent less money on food last year than I have any year since I started tracking my expenses a decade ago. 

Despite my best efforts to save more, everything keeps happening - my roof needed replaced and all the plywood underneath was rotted, my car broke down, there was mold in my bathroom so we needed to tear out all the tile and bathtub, my dog has thrown his back out twice (lil guy who forgets he's 9 years old), my cat ate some string and needed an emergency vet. 

Now my furnace blower has gone out. The furnace is 22 years old and a new blower is over $1000. My AC is also 22 years old, so it makes sense to replace them both now to save on the labor costs. The quotes I got to replace both with more efficient units are between $10-$15k. 

Again, I am incredibly lucky - I bought my house before covid, so even though I'm spending $40k in maintenance in the last five years, I've gained $100k in equity and my mortgage is $1000/month cheaper than if I tried to buy my house at today's value/interest rates.

1hw2x03,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSeattle/comments/1hw2x03/additional_suggestions_for_potentialmove_research/,Additional suggestions for potential-move research trip,"Happy new year, Seattle community! 

I’m doing a 3-4 day “research trip” later this week as I consider moving. I’ve never been, and want to get an initial feel for daily living (warts and all) in the area. This sub has been very helpful thus far, and I’m looking for additional suggestions (or even a sanity-check) relevant to my context/needs - 

*Context:* 

Currently in the DC/VA area, and will be leaving my job by this summer. I’m (re)evaluating where I want to live for the medium-long term. I’d only move with a job, and realistically expect to land \~$150-180k annual comp; trying to determine if Seattle is one I’d seriously recruit in. Single mid-30s, and have lived in DC, Manhattan and Boston over the past 13Y, so am familiar with higher-COL and city life. I’d like to get an initial but realistic feel for day-to-day living and the various neighborhoods, both in Seattle proper and outside. I’m especially interested in the downsides, with my trip timing intentionally coinciding with the shortest/greyest period.  

I’m fortunate with my income bracket, but try to live small and am prudent with keeping housing costs reasonably in check – something I’d like to continue. I don’t need/want to be downtown, and am looking for the balance between quieter and close-enough-to-be-social. Eg. I live on the edges of the city now, and am comfortable with \~30min drives/commutes to social activities. I’ve seen the recs to check out eastside areas like Bothell, Kirkland, Issaquah, Woodinville and Bellevue; as well as others like Kent and Mill Creek. 

Questions/Additional Suggestions: 

* Initially, I’d hope for a roommate situation. Am I more likely to find folks with similar life-context in some of these areas vs. others?
* If trying to keep my monthly total accom costs (rent, utilities, parking) \~$1.8-2k with roommate(s) which of these neighborhoods would I deprioritize? Others I should seriously consider?
* Any recs for neighborhood coffee shops and restaurants within these areas one might frequent? I’m thinking of local favorites one might be a regular at + want to support, vs. the meet-a-friend/special occasion types
* I also really enjoy Squash, and have earmarked a couple places in Seattle proper. Any suggestions for facilities outside?
* Other aspects to get acquainted with too? Esp downsides: I do intend to experience the traffic + public transit for myself while there; will give stranger-interactions a go too to get a superficial taste of the Freeze

I’ve got the tourist-y things covered and will squeeze some in, but know they may not be representative of “living”. That said, happy to take strong recs for anything that should influence my decision!

Thanks in advance to all, and apologies if I’ve missed some of these from my sub trawls :)

1hw2w1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersInTransition/comments/1hw2w1i/second_week_working_not_at_a_school/,Second week working (not at a school),"I've posted about my school's experience before, but you all know what that is like. I went on FMLA back in October, and started a new job as a medical case manager last week! The difference has been astounding already. 

Even though I already have 6 days of experience, they would prefer to thoroughly train me before I start working with client. Weird.

The training has been full of useful, applicable, and engaging information. A lot of it has to do with working with trauma, but literally EVERYTHING has been helpful! I've been going home and sharing the good stuff with my partner daily. Never once did that with school training. 

Lastly, the workload. My direct supervisor has been sick for the last 4 days, so I was feeling a little lost (without the literally neverending pile of things to catch up on). I only have MAYBE one email when I get in in the morning. Barely touched my coffee and it is done. The lack of work made me feel like I must be missing something, anything, everything, so I shot an email to my bosses boss asking if I could go over a few things with her to make sure I'm on top of it.

Big mistake. Supervisor called me while sick to remind me NEVER to bother people that far up the ladder, and if I finish up to just entertain myself until something comes up.

So now I get to spend my free time working on IT certifications, because that is what I want to do next! I'm able to focus on growing personally and professionally, instead of just putting out trash fires all day! And my boss already told me she would put in a reference with the IT department here once I'm eligible for internal transfers.

It's all just.... so .... fucking functional. I never thought I'd feel this lost being a part of a well oiled machine. Will take some getting used to, for sure.

Cesarean section 6 months ago 
No existing health conditions 

For the past month or so I have been experiencing right side abdominal discomfort. I wouldn’t say “pain” as it is more of an ache. I can feel something in my abdomen. The best way I can put it into words is like an oblong sausage shaped lump. Only felt on the inside, not visible on the outside. I can roll it around and I do feel pressure when pressing. Sometimes when pressing on this side of my abdomen I can hear and feel gas. I feel discomfort in the area sometimes when bending over or sitting with my legs up. I have had an excessive amount of gas and burping. To the point I googled how many farts a day are normal because I was shocked at what was coming out of me. You can laugh, I’m laughing too. I have always been very constipated. Easily go 5+ days with no bowel movement. Recently I have had a change in frequency of bowel movements along with consistency. I feel constipated but my bowel movements will come along after a cup of coffee, or a meal, and will be a loose bowel. No blood since the start of the bowel changes. The only time I have experienced blood is when I have been extremely constipated and was passing large and hard stools or have had a visible hemorrhoid. I feel nausea often. Mostly after a meal depending on what I eat. I experience back pain most of the day off and on… right lower side of the back and right flank. It worsens when I lay down at night. Last symptom would be reoccurring UTI feeling that just goes away on its own. Frequent urination, vaginal pains, etc. I originally thought I was dealing with a kidney stone possibly due to frequent urination and back pain, until the bowel symptoms came along.  

In 2022 I did have a CT after mentioning mild discomfort to the same area, constipation and again feeling this same “lump” although it felt much less inflamed back then. Nothing was found.

I realize there’s many things this could be… just curious if anything jumps out to anyone as a red flag.

My name is Alex. I’m 31 (Bi), and my wife Evie, who’s 28 (Bi), and I have been married for nearly four years, together for seven. We met on Bumble in 2017, and from the moment I met her, I knew she was someone special. Evie’s the kind of person who naturally draws people in, funny, sharp, and effortlessly cool. I fell for her hard and fast.

Early in our relationship, Evie confided in me that she’s bisexual. I was the first person she told, and I stood by her side when she came out to her parents. Thankfully, they were accepting, and it brought us even closer. Our relationship was built on trust, honesty, and mutual respect, and I always felt secure in the life we were building together.

Over the years, we would joke about her attraction to women. We would sit in coffee shops, pointing out women we thought were cute. Occasionally, the topic of a threesome would come up, but it was always light-hearted. We weren’t actively pursuing anything like that; it was more of a “what if” fantasy. I never felt like it was something we would actually explore.

But everything started to shift in mid-2023, when Keira, one of Evie’s new co-workers, entered our lives. Keira initially came across as friendly and confident, a typical new colleague. I didn’t think much of it when Evie started spending more time with her, grabbing drinks after work, texting more often, and occasionally inviting her over. Evie had been feeling a bit isolated since we moved in 2022, so I was glad to see her making a new friend.

When I first met Keira in person, I could tell she wasn’t just some casual friend. She was charismatic, with a natural charm that made people feel at ease. She identifies as queer (anything but straight). One evening, when we were all having drinks at home, the conversation turned playful, and we touched on the idea of a threesome. It was more of a joke at first, but there was an energy in the room that made it clear we weren’t just talking hypotheticals anymore.

A few days later, Keira approached me privately. She admitted that she had feelings for Evie but didn’t want to disrupt our marriage. She respected our boundaries and asked if it was okay to share those feelings with Evie. I appreciated her honesty. It felt like a rare kind of openness. After thinking it over, I gave her my blessing, under the condition that everything stayed above-board and Evie and I maintained open communication.

At first, things felt manageable. Evie was transparent about her feelings, and Keira made an effort to include me, making sure I never felt left out or sidelined. They started exploring their connection, which led to us having a threesome at one point. It was meant to be a shared experience, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that Evie and Keira were more focused on each other than on me. Still, I tried to see it as part of our journey, something we were navigating together.

Over the next few months, Keira became a constant presence in our lives. She would come over for dinner, spend nights on our couch, and even join us for outings. By October 2024, her lease was ending, and Evie asked if she could move in temporarily. I hesitated at first, unsure of how this would affect our dynamic. But after several honest conversations, I agreed.

Once Keira moved in, our lives became more intertwined. The boundaries we had initially set became blurrier. Evie and I still had our moments together, whether it was date nights or quiet evenings spent talking about the future. But Keira was always there, an ever-present part of our household. It wasn’t long before her clothes started showing up in the laundry, her favourite snacks appeared in our pantry, and her toothbrush found a permanent spot in our bathroom.

I’d be lying if I said I didn’t struggle with it at times. There were nights when I came home from work trips and found Evie and Keira curled up on the couch, or worse, sharing our bed. They assured me it wasn’t meant to push me out, and I tried my best to believe them. I knew Evie loved me, and I didn’t want my insecurities to cloud our relationship.

Things came to a head in December 2024, when we got news that should have been the happiest moment of our lives. Evie was pregnant. After months of trying, we were finally going to be parents. For a brief moment, it felt like everything would fall into place. Evie was radiant, her excitement infectious as we talked about baby names and started planning for the nursery.

But the joy was short-lived. One evening, Evie and Keira sat me down for a serious talk. Evie, with tears in her eyes, admitted that her feelings for Keira had deepened. She was in love with her, but she also insisted that her love for me hadn’t changed. She wanted to find a way for the three of us to coexist as a family. Keira stayed quiet, but her presence alone made the weight of the moment unbearable.

It felt like the ground had shifted beneath me. I was hurt, confused, and unsure of where I stood in all of this. But I could see how much Evie was struggling, torn between her love for me and her feelings for Keira. She begged me to understand, to give her time to figure things out. Despite my heartbreak, I told her I was willing to try, or her, for us, and for the baby.

We agreed to keep the lines of communication open and to set boundaries that worked for all of us. Over the next few months, we tried to navigate this new reality. Some days were easier than others. I could see how happy Evie was with Keira, but I couldn’t help feeling like a bystander in my own marriage.

By the time Keira fully integrated into our lives, it was clear that this wasn’t just a phase or a temporary arrangement. Evie’s love for Keira was real, and so was her commitment to me. We even revisited the idea of a threesome, not as a solution to our problems, but as a way to deepen the connection between all of us. It wasn’t perfect, but it helped us feel more united, even if only briefly.

We’ve had a lot of conversations about how this dynamic would work when it comes to parenting. Keira has expressed that she wants to take an active role in raising our child, not just as Evie’s girlfriend but as someone deeply invested in the family we’re building. She wants to contribute emotionally, financially, and practically—essentially co-parenting alongside us.

It’s a lot to wrap my head around. I see how much Evie and Keira care for each other, and I can tell Keira is genuine about wanting to be a part of our child’s life. Will I still feel like an equal partner? Will we be able to maintain healthy boundaries while raising a child in such an unconventional setup?

These are questions we’re still working through, but I want to give this a fair shot. At the end of the day, the most important thing is creating a stable, loving environment for our child. If we can figure out a way to make this work, with clear communication and mutual respect, maybe this can be a version of family that works for all of us.

It’s not what I imagined when Evie and I started our journey together, but life rarely plays out the way you expect. I’m learning to embrace the unexpected and focus on what truly matters: love, support, and the commitment to making this family as strong as it can be.",1,1736285903.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

A boxer wakes up at 5 a.m. and punches frozen meat to Eye of the Tiger.

A scrappy developer spills coffee on their laptop and accidentally invents the next unicorn startup.

Yeah, I thought starting something might *kind of* feel like that. 

Spoiler: it doesn’t.

Instead, I’ve spent the last 10 minutes trying to get my brain to believe opening the laptop is a significant achievement. 

(Spoiler: it’s not. But I’ve gaslit myself to believe it, so we’ll roll with it.)

But hey, it’s **Day 5**, and I haven’t rage-quit or vanished into the abyss. 

That alone feels like a win. 

Consistency isn’t glamorous, but it’s showing up every day—even if it means dragging yourself here on autopilot. 

**Why Starting Feels Like Scaling Everest... Without Legs**

* **Brain Overload Syndrome™**: Too many ideas—some are pure genius, and others… well, let’s just say they're best left in the depths of my mind.
* **Action Paralysis**: Overthinking? Zero calories burned, but 100% of your ambition gets ground to dust.
* **Fear Factor**: What if I flop? At worst, I'll end up a viral meme, so there's that.
* **Perfectionist Panic:** My brain wants a masterpiece, but I'm over here trying to find the motivation to open a Word doc. 

But here’s the catch: *none* of those excuses matter because I’m writing this post instead of scrolling Reddit or online shopping for desk organisers I won’t use.

*Is it much? Nope.*

*But it’s consistent—and showing up is half the battle.*

That’s the thing I’m learning: consistency *is* the real win, even if it doesn’t feel flashy. 

Here’s the truth nobody tells you: most of starting isn’t big, inspiring leaps. 

It’s tiny, dumb steps that feel ridiculous in the moment but eventually get you somewhere. 

Just not quitting when everything screams “take a nap, you deserve it”

That’s the actual secret. 

# Here’s My Grand Strategy for “Doing” Things Now

It’s simple. It’s genius. It’s basically foolproof.

The first offering I ever gave her was an apple. This apple sat on my secret altar (lived with my parents) for 4 months until i had to get rid of it cause there was a smidge of mold. During that 4 months the apple did not smell, mold, or do anything except get a bit brown and mushy. I give her liquid offerings really frequently too. Mostly coffee, craft whiskey, and teas. These rarely go bad fast and usually don’t evaporate too quickly, like… a lot will evaporate quick, then it’ll sit at almost the same level for a bit, then it’ll repeat. I also offered garlic many times. Every time i put it in a goblet i thrifted that has a lid on it. Every time the garlic will sprout and will take forever to rot lol. This garlic that’s on her altar has sat in complete darkness for around 6 months, it has been sprouted that whole time too. idk, i’ve heard of gods helping to put off the decaying of offerings, but idk i’ve never really heard of anything to this “extreme”.

I feel i should also mention that Lilith and Lucifer do this with their offerings too, I just have more stories about Hekate as i’ve worked with her longer. One time i have the three of them sections from a mandarine orange i was eating and within a week they were dry, like they had been baked in an oven on low lol.

1hw2mmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hw2mmu/fn_my_demons/,[FN] My Demons,"There is always at least one demon on shift throughout my day.

There is Mr. Squeezy Man. He normally works the day shift but has been known to work overtime. He lives right behind my nose. Whenever I try to wake up from behind my eyes, he takes his big, strong, gray, pustulated hands, places his fingers on my top eyelid, and his thumb on my bottom eyelid, and tries to force my eyes closed. Mr. Squeezy Man is one of the few that I have never seen face to face. All I see of him are his hands, with their chipped and rotted fingernails, which only happens when his hands slip off. The only way to free myself of Mr. Squeezy Man’s vicelike grip is with coffee. He has gotten stronger over the years. In high school, one cup was enough—and that was with cream and sugar—but now I need no less than three cups of the strongest, blackest coffee available.

There is Mr. Potato. Mr. Potato works mid-shift but is also on call for the night shift. He lives in my stomach. He is roughly the size and shape of a panda, with the biggest exception being that he has no legs and instead has little muffin-sized nubs that can barely hold his weight. His skin is yellow and covered with butter and month-old cooking grease. He smells like a restaurant’s back alley in all the worst ways possible. All Mr. Potato wants me to do is sit down, watch TV, and eat junk food. The more junk food I eat, the bigger Mr. Potato becomes. He is one of the hardest demons for me to deal with because Mr. Potato is clever—and he can talk. So even when he isn’t pinning me in front of the TV screen, shoving junk food down my throat, he tries to convince me that’s what I want. The only way for me to deal with Mr. Potato is by being proactive, meal-prepping my food, and trying to hit the gym at least three times a week. If I let up even a little, Mr. Potato catches up to me—which is surprising, given his size and small legs.

There is Ms. Somia. She works the night shift. She lives inside my pillow. Her body is roughly the size of a cat, but she has arms long enough to reach the other side of my queen-size bed. Her skin is purple and wrinkled, like a grape that isn’t quite a raisin. Whenever I am about to fall asleep, she likes to play a trick on me. Sometimes, she cups one hand around my ear, making a megaphone, and uses the other to bang on the radiator. Other times, she gives me an anti-massage, which is very much like a regular massage, except that the longer it continues, the stiffer and more unrelaxed I become. But she has been known to play other tricks on me, such as tugging the blanket away from my feet so I get too cold, or using her long arms to bang on the ceiling, imitating the sound of the neighbors walking above. (I haven’t had upstairs neighbors in years.) There are a couple of ways for me to free myself from the effects of her little tricks. I can work out before bed, but that is only when Mr. Potato is off shift. Or I can take melatonin. Like Mr. Squeezy Man, she has also gotten stronger. I used to go through a bottle every two months in high school, and now I am lucky if the bottle of melatonin lasts me a week.

I’ve recently purchased a new Ascaso Steel Duo Plus, but I’m experiencing some concerns with the brewing temperature. To get 92°C at the showerhead, I had to set the offset value (U-value) to 21, which seems very high to me. Is this normal for this machine? My PID display is set to 94°C.

Most of my espressos taste sour, even though I stay within the typical range of 25-30 seconds extraction time for medium-roasted coffee beans. I use 18g coffee in and aim for 36-40g output.

As a last resort, I decided to check the temperature at the showerhead, and the results surprised me. I’d love to hear your thoughts or similar experiences.

This is my very first post as I am quite new around here. I've been digging around and it seems great to see all the stuff people share...

I'd love to poke your experienced brains to see if my initial tests with grain spawn are running smooth. I made about 14 jars of 490ml or 16oz so far, in two separate batches, all properly pressured cooked and inoculated with Reishi:

* 7 jars only with Rye
* 7 jars with rye and a spoon of ground coffee and barley malt (somewhere I read it was good, so I felt like  testing and potentially compare).

I inoculated the jars about 10 days ago with 1cc each. I have them in a closed box over a heating mat for plant (not touching but barely one inch apart) set to 26C or 78F. While the growth of the mycelium seems on its way, it also seem slow for 10 days.

How quick should one expect to see a jar colonized?

Also, I wonder if its the temperature but as you can see in the image on the right side the rye looks rather dry and with hyphae. on the left side, it looks quite wet altough prior to the inoculation, I let the exterior moisture on the rye to dry... so don't really know why this humidity/condensation showed up.

Would that be an obstacle to the colonization? Just in case I gave all jars a nice shake today.

1hw2k1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1hw2k1c/buckle_up/,Buckle up ,"Buckle up.  
 
My wife and I have been separated almost 7 months now.  I violated some boundaries (looked at some porn, deleting texts - not sexual or flirtatious, just didn’t want to fight over stupid stuff-).  She is not perfect either, but rather than discuss her imperfections, I am only going to mention my own. We almost separated in January but she realized she didn't want to. She broke it to me on Father's Day that she wanted a separation, seemingly out of nowhere.  The months of February - early June had the feel of the honeymoon phase all over again. She was actively discussing how happy she was that we were rediscovering our love. So needless to say I was blindsided.

Those first two weeks she ranged from angry to wanting me to just hold and hug her at times.  There was one night she dropped an ""I miss you"" out of the blue and later told me she had almost asked me to come back for the night.  There was some intimacy sprinkled in as well. Over the next few months she lead me on a roller coaster emotionally.  For further context, she would live at the house Monday – Thursday, I would stay there Friday – Sunday with our daughter.  One day would be an ""I love you"" and a kiss goodbye.  Two days later, she's not even acknowledging me as I'm saying goodbye.  There would also be a week or so straight of saying ‘I love you” before going to sleep each night.  A lot of fluctuation on expressing love on her end.

Fast forward to late August.  We go to dinner to celebrate our 5 year anniversary.  She wears her ring for the first time since separating and the first necklace I ever bought her. She makes mention at dinner as to missing her rings. The night seemed like the good times.  We were ourselves.  That night she had me spend the night up in the bedroom for the first time since the separation.  We were not intimate, but she allowed me to sleep with her.  The family went on vacation the next day and I stayed back (a decision she'd made a month prior). Our anniversary date actually fell on a day they were gone and she's since relayed she was miserable most of that week.  Upon returning from vacation, I spent the next two nights with her after spending a couple of days together that seemed like old times.  No intimacy at night, but still allowed to sleep beside her. 

September/October
I start hearing my 3 year old daughter mention a man's I didn't really recognize.  I don't think anything of it outside of knowing it was the name of a co-worker . She then says it again one night in the car as we're all together.  I ask aloud about that name and she mentions it's a co worker friend who has been over just as a friend.  That night she flatly asks me what I am going to do once she starts dating as she knows it bothered me that she has had a guy coming by.  The next month he starts showing up once a week at the house to be a support.  He too is recently divorced and has two kids of his own and tells her he can coach her through this with his experience.  I expressed to her that I can see exactly what he is doing.  He is leveraging his experience through his own divorce to prey upon her vulnerability.  He knows he can take his time as she will just continually trust him more until he believes she is prime to make a move on.  She denies this is his intent, and claims he is just being a support person for her. 
 
November
The day after Thanksgiving, my ex drops my daughter off and she talks about how the night before she had slept in bed between momma and the new guy.  Very specific with saying “momma sleep on this side and he sleep on this side.”  I brought this up with her later that day and she vehemently denied it.  She claimed he had never spent the night in any capacity and has no clue where our daughter had got that from.  I also learn that he is 50 years old (my ex is 36, I am 40)
The Monday after Thanksgiving, my ex had an argument with my sister and wants to discuss it with me.  After we discuss the argument, she out of the blue asks me “can we start getting coffee once a week again.  Thanksgiving made me realize how much I miss you.”  I told her we could.  Before she left she gave me a big hug and told me she loved me. 
 
 
December
I go over to the house one morning to grab my winter jacket.  His car is in the driveway.  I go into the house to ask for my jacket and I ask her to talk outside.  I come out and ask “did he spend the night last night,” to which she responded yes.  I was going to just leave but she followed me and I broke down in the driveway and then in the car.  She got in my car alongside me and I went off on her.  I explained how hurt I was that she has already started seeing another man just months into our separation and not even being divorced yet.  There was more venting on my part before I had to be somewhere. She ended up texting me later that she wanted to discuss this further as we couldn’t leave it where it was.  I end up going over and for the first hour we are just at each others throats.  She tells me the night prior was the first time he made a move on her and it was late so she asked him if he wanted sleep up with her.  She claims they only slept.  I ask her if she believes they will be a couple by the end of the week to which she admits is likely once they discuss it.  She breaks down the timeline of their relationship to me.  They didn’t even meet in person till end of September.  October he started swinging over to the house.  The next hour is spent discussing how we currently feel for each other.  She tells me “I love you as much as I ever have.  It has not waned at all.  If anything, I find my love for you growing as I see you interact with our daughter.  I just can’t be with you right now as I still have to heal.  She made a promise to herself to not take me back right now as she feels like she would be just forgiving me.”  There is a lot more talk around how we feel for each other but the consensus is we still are very much in love.  The final 45 minutes becomes very sexual.  I let her know I deleted things off my phone so she didn’t have to worry about that.  This put her mind in the gutter and she started making references to things we had done around the house.  She tells me she wants to bring up upstairs but wont because she made a promise to herself that she wouldn’t.  There is some flashing by both of us during this flirtatious period before I leave.  Shortly after I leave, she starts texting me very explicit messages.  This carries through the night where she wanted to continue things through text, audio, and video.  We end not following through on what she wanted due to her not feeling well.  She asks for a rain check for the next night.  The next day is again spent with messages.  We again do not follow up that night as work had drained her.  I send her a long message asking if she wants to make love once more as it is clear that attraction is there.  I also tell her we do not have to follow through with this as I don’t want to put her in a position she will regret.  In regards to making love she says no, as she would want it to be like it was before and right now it might be a mistake emotionally.  And she makes it a point to say she does want to follow through with the texting, video fun.  Sunday comes and goes and once again do not follow through.  We get coffee later that week and she comes out and tells me they had had the conversation and decided to exclusively see each other so we could not follow through any further.  In my opinion, she was okay doing everything she did with me that weekend because even though she knew they were going to become a couple, the fact that they had not had the conversation yet meant it was still okay and she could be guiltless. 
 
A couple weeks later she needs me at the house early to watch our daughter as she has an early work meeting she has to go to.  In the midst of getting herself ready that morning she starts telling me that they had done a family tradition the night before and all she could keep thinking to herself was “he should be here.”  She then broke down completely, falling into my arms telling me how much she misses me.  I gave her a hug and she had to leave.  A few days later is my birthday.  I decide to give myself a gift and write her a letter basically stating that I believe she still loves me and in her heart wants us to be together.  I outline my rational on this and state if its true why are we wasting time we could be spending together.  We end up having a chat that night where she doesn’t acknowledge my intuition is wrong, just that she cannot be with me right now.  She brings up the possibility of the future which is not the first time she has done this. She reiterates how much she loves me.  She then gets upset that I would garner any hope from her telling me how much she missed me.  She then exclaims, “I should be allowed to tell you how much I miss you without you reading any more into it.”  I leave in a very depressive state and do not have much interaction with her for the next couple weeks.
 
Over this period of time where I do not interact with her, I learn some information.  The SIL of a co-worker is currently being trained by my ex to take the place of her new guy.  I should add this guy was recently fired from his job for apparently not filling out reports correctly.  But if you were to ask my ex, they were looking for a reason to push him out.  The on the job training entails the two of them driving around together from place to place, so they spend a good deal of time one on one.  During this my ex tells her trainee that her new guy had taken his ex wife to dinner because she was “struggling.” My ex was given the impression that her new guy’s ex did not want anything to do with him anymore.  They had divorced because she had cheated on him.  He was the one who fought to get her back.  My ex must have loved this as she was not in the picture at all.  Him suddenly taking her to dinner must have shaken her.  Her trainee said she seemed distant and disconnected the entire day and could barely hold a conversation.  Since getting this information, I have not heard anything more, I just know they are still together so he may have smoothed things over. 
 
This past Sunday night I drop my daughter off at home and my ex is finishing up training her co worker.  I pop in quick as to not be rude before leaving.  Later that night I get a text from her asking if we can talk.  I tell her no problem and she immediately responds with “nevermind.”  At this point its going to bug me if she doesn’t tell me what’s on her mind.  She keeps telling me it’s stupid and not to worry about it.  Finally I convince her to tell me.  She straight up asks me to please not date the person she is training.  She knows she has no right to ask not to date anyone but she would not be able to handle it if I dated this woman.  For context, I have only seen this woman like 3 times ever with the 3rd being that night.  It had been a legit 7-9 months since the last time I did, and this was at a store where my ex just introduced me to her as a girl she was doing orientation with.  I have never had a one on one conversation with this woman before.  Oh and I should add that she is married but apparently having her own very real marital issues.  I was completely blown away but this as I had no clue why my ex would be asking me not to date someone I didn’t even know or had any communication with.  She continued to fill me in that the girl she is training had become asking very intimate and personal details about our sex life when we were together.  There was a particular focus on me; what kind of lover I am and exactly how I went about doing certain things.  She also had been making comments about how good of a father I am and how great of a guy I seem to be.  This all reached a point where it has put my ex completely on alert and believes this girl is “Crushing on you.”  My ex went on to explain more into why she does not want me to date this woman.  The fact that they work together.  That she has been in our house.  That my ex shared very intimate information regarding our marriage to her.  This includes confiding in her how much she misses me (and likely more) and feeling like she is the type of fake nice that would pursue me even though she knows all this.  She then goes on to tell me “I was thinking about this and I started getting shaky, sick to my stomach, and started crying, which is why I reached out to you tonight.”  I talked her off this ledge and by the end of the conversation she says “I feel like I am starting to see a new side of you through all of this.”
 
This is the briefest I could possibly make the past few months.  There is a ton more I could add and have likely left out but this would become a full blown novel.  I have been going to individual therapy for the past few months and it has helped.  My ex and tried couples therapy but did not really like that therapist.  I do find something quite audacious about her asking me not to date someone when she herself is actively dating someone I am not comfortable with.   ",1,1736285312.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

He’s the least receptive to other people’s needs when he’s sober now but it doesn’t seem fair that he’s so complacent when he’s high but also so lazy and unhelpful that I have to do it all  myself. I’m very nice about it when I make requests I just worry he’s all out of his own dopamine at this point and don’t know what to do. ",10,1736285191.0,Marriage,16,0.92,False

29M, 170cm, 64kg, East Asian.

Had a pre-employment medical checkup with blood analysis. Prior to that, I thought I was in reasonable shape; daily 30m exercise, OK diet, not perfect but I'm not splurging on fast food/restaurant, I drink alcohol once a year maybe (99% of the time is water) and I watch my macro and avoid saturated fat. I don't smoke nor do any drug (including coffee). No medical complaints, haven't been to the doc for like 10 years.

I was quite surprised reading my blood analysis

The report says I should go to my family doctor; I don't have any plus I recently moved to another country and waiting for my insurance to kick in.

In the meantime, can you guys tell me if this is concerning and if I should absolutely consult a doctor asap?

I recently bought the bambino (not the plus) and I’m using about 18.5-19g and a fine grind. To be specific, I have a bodum grinder and grind the beans on the fine setting 4 times for my current coarseness. 

Currently I’m getting about 2 ounces with only one side dripping at a somewhat “watery” pace. 
In my opinion, something isn’t right like my coffee can be better but maybe I’m just over thinking it. Also, puck is still wet when I empty the portafilter.

TLDR: What this MAKE .com automation does, it scrapes all the products pages at once (134 in my case, every day), takes the lowest BSR, and imports that into our google sheet column, daily. So you see the trends for the past month for your and competitors BSRs. That's it! 

I spent 50 hours on this last week, and here’s a simple way I solved it for less than 40$ a month. (this is for the apify scraper cost for 134 listings a day, if you use more, then more, if less then less...)

* Have a sheet ready, with ASIN in 1st column, and rank for date X in column 2, rank for date X+1 in column 3 etc... 
* Make a make .com account,  I do have an refferal link you could ask me if you want to

* 1 blue print is to scrape your list, take asins / links and feed into scraper, nr 2 blueprint is to then take scraped data and put into google sheet. 
* Enjoy!

I have no idea where I want to work or what I want to do. I am on the bank as HCSW and almost every place I go for shift- I don’t like in my city. I had placements on the islands (Orkney and Shetland) and it was great! I loved it. Manageable amount of patients and responsibilities, nice teams and feeling supported, however I could never live here. 
In my city, as mentioned before- always understaffed, always issues, always lazy people hiding in toilets etc., rude staff, no time for the patients care, so much stress! I’ve seen plenty of people crying on their shifts, heard from band 7, that as a nurse I will be never able to organise my rota, in that ward some nurses would do nights for months! Even switching a shift with another band 5 seems to be a big issue.. 
I also miss being “me”. I know that will sounds shallow, but I miss my lashes, i miss having my nails done, overall I feel bad mentally with myself, wearing this uniforms which also makes me sweat like crazy, sometimes I need to change my top 2/3 times a day, and will still have massive wet spots under my armpits… 
I was doing mental health nursing but after my placement in ED, i switched to adult nursing, and honestly at this point I have no idea what I am doing. This year I am supposed to graduate, but all I see and hear is negatives from other nurses and students. 

I have been working in hotel before my studies and sometimes I still go there to help, and to compare I am getting there 12£ an hour for checking people in, serving at the bar, and other tiny things while sitting down and drinking coffee. Have plenty of benefits such as free food on the shift, bonuses… So thinking about how much will be expected from me for almost the same amount of money and so much stress, responsibilities etc, sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it.

","Burnout is something I hear about a lot, especially from nurses. The long shifts, the emotional toll—it’s no wonder so many feel stuck and drained. But what if there was a way to do work that truly fills your cup while still making a real difference in people’s lives?  
  
As a paramedical tattoo artist, I’ve seen how fulfilling work can actually be.  
  
I go to work excited to meet clients who are also excited to meet me.  
  
I get to express my creativity in an inspiring, beautiful space with tons of natural light, plants and art.   
  
I get to start my “work” day after enjoying a full cup of coffee, getting my son ready for school and working out.   
  
I get to create a career that supports my personal and family life…and because of that, it’s been years since I’ve had the Monday blues.  
  
For nurses feeling burnt out and stuck in the bedside role, it’s possible to transition into something that makes a real difference in people’s lives while also fulfilling your own needs. It’s all about finding a path that aligns with your skills and passions.

1hw2dyk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hw2dyk,Chungking Express (1994),"Two police officers in separate stories, both coping in their own ways with recent breakups of relationships, fall for women who enter their lives. All of them lonely, all of them coping and trying to understand what it is to be in love.

The first of the two stories centres on Cop 223 and a woman in a blond wig. Takeshi Kaneshiro, with his youthful appearance as Cop 223 is obsessed with a previous relationship. Her breaking up with him on April Fools Day makes him believe it’s a joke, so he hangs around a local food store hoping to hear from her again, checking messages, and giving himself a month for her to realise her apparent mistake. Amusingly he does this by tracking the sell by date on tinned pineapple, as she likes the fruit, so he eats a can a day of tins that expire on May 1st, the same date he will allow his relationship to end. This is just one of many bizarre, yet fantastical details seen throughout the film. It’s in this first story he discusses heartbreak: “Whenever I do, I go jogging. The body loses water when you jog, so I don’t cry as easily” a line both touching and hilarious. Much like the film itself. 

The woman, Brigitte Lin, in long coat, sunglasses at night and blond wig is seemingly disinterested in his affections, distracted as she is by the fact she is a drug dealer who has lost a family of drug running Indians. In one hilarious scene stealing a child to get information. The character is the epitome of cool. It could be said that like this character the film is very surface level, but that would be to dismiss the depths the film reaches when looking at people and the loneliness of big city living, and loving. A film of small gestures and scenes that tell a story more importantly than most, such as the taking of shoes and cleaning them. We don’t need swathes of back story to identify with the characters in this film. What Chungking does so well is make us feel, feel and remember what it’s like to be lonely, what it’s like to love.

The second story made me realise I’m not going to get the song California Dreamin’ out of my mind for a while. Cop 663 we witness at the tail end of his relationship with a Stewardess. A seduction scene to What a Difference a Day Makes opens the film, the camera moving with the couple as they chase each other around the room, Tony Leung’s cop flying a toy plane. Losing her he also has odd ways of coping, he consoles inanimate objects in his home, such as soap about the weight it’s lost, all a diversion of his own feelings, the apartment copes with the stewardesses absence, then so does he.

He in turn meets Faye, Faye Wong, who works at the same food store that Cop 223 would wait for his pineapple loving ex. Whilst getting lunch at the store he becomes aware of her, but it’s her reaction to him and his relationship he lost that drives her infatuation. She pursues him, living out a fantasy existence once she gains access to his apartment, he oblivious.  
As with the rest of the film it’s excellently scored, a version of the Cranberries Dreams plays as she moves around his apartment cleaning and taking on part of his life, albeit on the periphery.

The direction by Wong Kar Wai, the cinematography by Christopher Doyle and Wai Keung Lau complement and create an astounding film. From its impressive opening, the madness, the hectic kinetic camera, focusing on Cop 223 as he dashes through the crowd to a shot of 663 slowly drinking coffee, Faye watching him, the crowd blurred in the foreground moving at a pace. Elsewhere, Neon drenched train stations, close quartered shopping districts are shot with an immediacy and kinetic energy. 

Love and loneliness in a beautiful masterpiece that will have you falling in love with Chungking Express, and all films that make you feel this good. ",9,1736284883.0,iwatchedanoldmovie,1,1.0,False

1hw2cj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1hw2cj4/will_this_write_up_screw_my_promotion_over/,Will this write up screw my promotion over?,"Hey all - been a barista for just over a year. I lost my last corporate job over 2 years ago, was on unemployment, had a contract job with my old company and have another part time job, applied to thousands of jobs, been through two or more rounds with dozens of companies, and started a coding boot camp that turned out to be a disaster, all before I took a barista job last year to help make ends meet.

I expected it to just be something I did until I got another desk job, but over the last year (and I promise I’m really not a corporate dickrider when I say this), it’s really changed my life. My crew is awesome here, nearly all of us are friends and have deep connections to each other. I used my health insurance to pursue a depression treatment that very likely saved my life. I’ve become a barista trainer and have trained 4 people, and am three seasonal blends away from becoming a coffee master. Being on my feet and talking to people, rather than working remotely, has led me to consider a big career change to becoming a nurse. While I go back to school for that, I want to be able to stay on and have been on the track since the summer to become a shift supervisor. My current store manager is leaving to open a new store, and our manager trainee who’s likely taking our store over and our DM had set up a timeline before Christmas that would have me in the shift role by mid to late February.

Here’s where I have trouble - I had a write up in May that fell off in November; my phone died the night before a morning shift and didn’t turn back on when I plugged it in to charge, so I slept in a few hours from when I was due to go in. Before then, I’d had a write up for tardiness in early March, but in between March and May, and May until recently, nothing has happened.

A few weeks ago, I got in under 5 minutes late and my shift had said to “write the real time in the book or else I can’t cover you to HR,” which seemed strange since he’s been guilty of writing the original start time in the book when he’s come in late too. All of us have. So, I originally wrote the late time in the book and talked to my manager trainee, who said as long as no one said anything, he’d take care of it. So, I went back and wrote it to be a 0.

One girl on that shift, who’s had an axe to grind with me for months for reasons I still don’t fully know, took a photo of the book and reported me to HR. She’s a more tenured barista and used to be super revered and liked, but has turned into a relentlessly miserable person and has drained any potential empathy people on the team would have for her away from them. She constantly complains about missing the old crew, and we’ve tried to invite her to do things with us, but she never wants to be involved. She calls off all the time, usually after shifts start, and also had a scheduling mixup with someone where neither of them ended up coming in and my shift friend and I had to two man an open.

My manager trainee said it was going in as a write up and will very likely delay my shift movement until July. I found this out on NYE, spent 20 hours in bed before working a double because I was too panicked and anxious to want to be awake. I cancelled a party I was gonna have with my work friends and they were scared of how dark of a place I was in.

My manager trainee said he still believes in me and if he gets our DM’s blessing to look past this, we’ll move forward with my shift training. She’s fairly by the book, but has also been a barista, knows my work ethic, and has said she fully endorses the idea of me being a shift. I’ve talked to the union and have some ideas on how to challenge this, and I’ve seen on here people have said they’ve moved up with write ups on their record.

So tell me, Reddit - is my promotion doomed? I really need it to go through so I can be more stable and less reliant on familial help. And also I really love my store and (almost) all of my team there and don’t want to leave them. Has anyone known anyone who’s gotten past this to move up?",0,1736284785.0,starbucks,2,0.25,False

I'll try my best to keep everything together this last week's just been.. alot. I'm sending this out to whoever finds it, I don't expect anyone to believe it but, I need to get it off my chest. 



----My parents headed out on Monday, this weird work trip I don't know I've never really pried, sounds like some excuse to hang out in a fancy hotel, and all I know is they should've been gone for at least the week. Me being.. i mean a late teen without enough hobbies, usually takes it as a break, to bum around the house, relax, what you're picturing basically, Just me and my mom's cat Alice. 



----For the most part that first day was normal I think, I was tired but nothing really, noteworthy? But it was getting late and I was really feeling that second coffee, thinking I'd level out, go sit on the steps by the door and have a smoke. I stepped out in my pjs and.. damn it was cold.. like eye watering, nose running, painfully cold. I wasn't out there for long, I don't think I could have, and between the snow outside and the snacks I knew waited for me in the kitchen? I headed in pretty quick.


 After a few minutes of raiding the cupboards I heard Alice wadlle into the kitchen behind me, I glanced over and she meowd at me, mooching like always, with a faint grin I leaned back on the counter, shaking my head and just before I could make make fun of her.. I heard another? Another meow.. like down the hallway. It was way too dark, I mean all the lights were off except for the kitchen ones over us, and I was staring at the cat, she didn't move.. I got a chill down my spine, my heartrate picked up, and i got deathly still, trying to not make a noise, but just as I started to reason with myself that I'm just high, or I just blinked and missed Alice make the noise.. I heard it again.


 It was off.. coming from down by my parent room I think, it was raspy, and like it was struggling almost. I tried my best to get Alice to follow me but she heard it too, not batting an eye at me quietly trying to scold her. If I wasn't that tired, that on edge already, I'd probably just turn the lights on and go look too but.. I needed to sleep, my eyes were so heavy, I kept telling myself it wasn't real, I'm just tired, so I walked past the hallway, not turning to look for where she went, and right into my room, shutting the door behind me with my foot and walking towards my bed. I did that stupid little shuffle? Like with your hands out, little steps, trying to find the bed in the pitch black but.. after a few seconds I realized I walked.. way.. too far.


 I kept going, glancing back but the doors faint outline was consumed by the dark anyways, I started to panic, reaching down till I touched the floor, and reaching around but.. nothing.. not a desk, not a bed, nothing.. looking back it must sound stupid but.. I yelled for help. Screamed.. I screamed. After a few minutes and realizing I was genuinely lost, I begged for anything to happen, anyone to call out or help. I don't really remember what happened next, as weird as it sounds or cliche, I woke up in bed? The lights were still out and it was dark, had to be night, but i could just barely see the light coming from the kitchen under my door, I took a deep breath, weirdly tired, and tried to peice together what happened, best I can manage I must've just passed out at somepoint as I walked in.. 




----I sat there in bed for a good little bit, I've had those naps where you wake up half asleep still but it almost felt like those screams, all that time in the dark genuinely got to me. ""I gotta stop smoking"" I mumbled to myself and reached over to grab my phone, pulling it out to distract myself, at least till I can pass out again. After probably an hour or two of rotting in bed, zoned out, endlessly scrolling, I swear I heard my door. The only way I can describe it was like If someone tried testing your handle without waking you, just a jiggle of the handle you know? But it was definitely moving, it didn't stop either, for a few seconds before I felt that same wave of fear wash over me, the chill, the ring in my ears, I shut my phone off and didn't have the balls to move, to speak, I just sat there staring at the doors outline through the void of my room.


 Unable to tell If my eyes were failing as I fought passing out again or the faint shadows at the doors edges were real, I spent so long watching the light.. I got so tired.. I would've probably just gave in if it wasnt for the flies? Not like a swarm but I mean, they were there, and they kept divebombing me, like a mosquito zipping past your ears, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the door but they kept hitting me, landing on my face, testing me and I wish I could say more but again I just.. woke up in bed.. I had to have passed out again.



----Tuesday then, I guess, honestly the whole few days blurred together I wish I could be more exact I just know it was light out when I woke up again though. I sat up, got out of bed, and realized how weak I felt, heavy, like every movement was this monstrous task, every step took more effort than it should as I worked my way back towards the door.


 I feel embarrassed admitting it now but It took me a good few minutes to open the door.. I stared at that handle like it was red hot, like the shit you picture in the corner of your eye at night, that vuage shapless monster, was on the other side of that door waiting for me, still testing to see if i locked it. I eventually opened the door, I stepped out, and I looked both ways in dead silence before walking towards the bathroom, down that same dark hallway, not really thinking about it in the moment but the second I got into the room I shut the door and locked it behind me, turning on the dim lights, dropping my phone on the counter and splashing water in my face at the sink to wake up. 


Looking at myself I started noticing how bloodshot my eyes looked, how dark the bags under them were, I shook my head and stripped down as I walked to the shower, stepping into it, shutting the glass door carefully and letting the warm water rush over me, I couldn't help but lean back against the wall and slide down till I was sitting in the corner on the floor of the shower, facing the glass as my eyes fluttered open and closed, over, and over.


 I don't think I've ever been this tired, it didn't stop, it didn't  get better, I needed rest. As the hot water hummed away, running over me, beading up on the glass as steam fills the room, I actually felt a little relaxed, i let myself take a deep, long, blink. My eyes stung, the lids felt glued shut ""fuck.."" i mumbled to myself weakly, but I forced them open, and as I looked up at the glass, I immediately regretted not letting myself fall into that deep sleep my body was begging for..



---- through the thousands of beads along the glass, a distorted, not totally clear outline of, at least what looked like, a naked.. old.. man.. was standing there just watching me sit on the cold tile.. i couldnt tell if his arms were too long, or his body was too short, it couldve just been my eyes again but.. I've never felt so caught off guard, vulnerable, but nomatter what ran through my mind I couldn't for the life of me move. I wanted to scream, to make a break for it, but he was so close to the glass, and I was so utterly horrified. 


I sat there, staring back at him, my heart feeling like it was gonna pound out through my ribs, my eyes straining to keep open, and on him. I waited for so long I had pins an needles through my legs, the hot water mustve ran out after a half an hour, i had goosebumps down my entire body as the water ran cold, shaking slightly, till the point of my breath becoming visible, I was starving, and so tired..  but i didnt let myself move out of fear of provoking him. I couldn't help it, I couldn't keep them open, I felt my eyes shutting and as terrified as I was of letting my eyes drift off of him.. they shut, and eventually, woke up again. Curled up just like before, against the tile, goosebumps still rittling my skin from head to toe ""it was a dream.. I need to sleep.. it's a dream"" 



----after an hour or two I had managed to get up again, and mostly dressed, fearing every blink, praying i didnt pass out again, or see anything.. with nothing but sleep on my mind, I just barely pried the door open and stepped out into the hallway. I stumbled down towards my room, hand on the wall, feeling something dribble down my top lip but just before I reached up I heard this.. horrific scream behind me.. for help. My mom's voice was so crystal clear, begging for help, I just mumbled to myself ""ill wake up.. I'll wake up.. I'll wake up"" I walked away from her voice, tears welling up in my eyes, my throat swelling, wether I believed it or not.. it was her voice. ""I just fell asleep again.. its not real.."" I kept walking as she sobbed. I didn't remember shutting my eyes, or fighting sleep off.. but it had to be fake itd only been like.. 2 days? 


They couldn't have been back.. 
I walked into my room, through the dark as her voice echoed through my head, tossing my phone towards my side table as I crawled into bed, crying quietly as I laid back and stared at the ceiling ""ill wake up.."" I reached up to wipe tears away away, my eyes in so much pain as I listened to her losing her voice down the halway before stopping... just dead silence. My phone went off beside my head at somepoint.. cast a glow into my room.. just barely enough light that.. I saw it.. him.. standing there.. he was beside my bed, just like the shower just.. looking over me.. I didn't move my eyes from the ceiling as I started to shake, and mumble to myself ""ill just wake up.. I'll wake.. up.."" 



----I did, at somepoint.. I must've i guess, but I'm only getting worse, and im sorry for how this ends but whatever is happening is only getting more vivid.. more real. I can't stay here I just needed to have this somewhere, to say it outloud, my parents aren't here, alice is gone, the.. thing.. isn't here.. I don't know what to do, who to call, but im leaving..

She explained she has some anxiety and doesn't go out much. We are both quite new in town, so difficult to recommend places by either of us. Anyway, I made a joke about being certain she'd want to meet me in public but she quickly retorted she was fine to come over.

For context, we live in a relatively culturally conservative country, and we are both foreign.

Anyway, I've started prying for details on any dietary requirements, etc to make sure she doesn't have any allergies or things like that.

But basically after some advice on what to do. I'm quite happy to sit and chat for hours and do it well. I don't necessarily want to end up staring at a TV.

When I turn on the machine from dead cold and turn the steam boiler on, most times it heats up fine and is ready to steam milk without issue. 

However, if the coffee boiler has been on and then I turn the steam boiler on, or if I turn it on by waking the machine out of standby mode — it almost always does this. The valve is 100% closed tight, but there is steam leaking all inside the machine, everything gets wicked hot as you can see from the videos, and there is no way to get the steam boiler ready for steaming. When I finally give up and turn the boiler off, the pump turns on, presumably pulling new water in.

Has anyone had experience with a doctor diagnosing digestive enzyme deficiencies? I can’t help but wonder if this is the reason I’ve been developing more food intolerances (it seems like every year, 1-2 new ones pop up).

I'll try my best to keep everything together this last week's just been.. alot. I'm sending this out to whoever finds it, I don't expect anyone to believe it but, I need to get it off my chest. 



----My parents headed out on Monday, this weird work trip I don't know I've never really pried, sounds like some excuse to hang out in a fancy hotel, and all I know is they should've been gone for at least the week. Me being.. i mean a late teen without enough hobbies, usually takes it as a break, to bum around the house, relax, what you're picturing basically, Just me and my mom's cat Alice. 



----For the most part that first day was normal I think, I was tired but nothing really, noteworthy? But it was getting late and I was really feeling that second coffee, thinking I'd level out, go sit on the steps by the door and have a smoke. I stepped out in my pjs and.. damn it was cold.. like eye watering, nose running, painfully cold. I wasn't out there for long, I don't think I could have, and between the snow outside and the snacks I knew waited for me in the kitchen? I headed in pretty quick.


 After a few minutes of raiding the cupboards I heard Alice wadlle into the kitchen behind me, I glanced over and she meowd at me, mooching like always, with a faint grin I leaned back on the counter, shaking my head and just before I could make make fun of her.. I heard another? Another meow.. like down the hallway. It was way too dark, I mean all the lights were off except for the kitchen ones over us, and I was staring at the cat, she didn't move.. I got a chill down my spine, my heartrate picked up, and i got deathly still, trying to not make a noise, but just as I started to reason with myself that I'm just high, or I just blinked and missed Alice make the noise.. I heard it again.


 It was off.. coming from down by my parent room I think, it was raspy, and like it was struggling almost. I tried my best to get Alice to follow me but she heard it too, not batting an eye at me quietly trying to scold her. If I wasn't that tired, that on edge already, I'd probably just turn the lights on and go look too but.. I needed to sleep, my eyes were so heavy, I kept telling myself it wasn't real, I'm just tired, so I walked past the hallway, not turning to look for where she went, and right into my room, shutting the door behind me with my foot and walking towards my bed. I did that stupid little shuffle? Like with your hands out, little steps, trying to find the bed in the pitch black but.. after a few seconds I realized I walked.. way.. too far.


 I kept going, glancing back but the doors faint outline was consumed by the dark anyways, I started to panic, reaching down till I touched the floor, and reaching around but.. nothing.. not a desk, not a bed, nothing.. looking back it must sound stupid but.. I yelled for help. Screamed.. I screamed. After a few minutes and realizing I was genuinely lost, I begged for anything to happen, anyone to call out or help. I don't really remember what happened next, as weird as it sounds or cliche, I woke up in bed? The lights were still out and it was dark, had to be night, but i could just barely see the light coming from the kitchen under my door, I took a deep breath, weirdly tired, and tried to peice together what happened, best I can manage I must've just passed out at somepoint as I walked in.. 




----I sat there in bed for a good little bit, I've had those naps where you wake up half asleep still but it almost felt like those screams, all that time in the dark genuinely got to me. ""I gotta stop smoking"" I mumbled to myself and reached over to grab my phone, pulling it out to distract myself, at least till I can pass out again. After probably an hour or two of rotting in bed, zoned out, endlessly scrolling, I swear I heard my door. The only way I can describe it was like If someone tried testing your handle without waking you, just a jiggle of the handle you know? But it was definitely moving, it didn't stop either, for a few seconds before I felt that same wave of fear wash over me, the chill, the ring in my ears, I shut my phone off and didn't have the balls to move, to speak, I just sat there staring at the doors outline through the void of my room.


 Unable to tell If my eyes were failing as I fought passing out again or the faint shadows at the doors edges were real, I spent so long watching the light.. I got so tired.. I would've probably just gave in if it wasnt for the flies? Not like a swarm but I mean, they were there, and they kept divebombing me, like a mosquito zipping past your ears, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the door but they kept hitting me, landing on my face, testing me and I wish I could say more but again I just.. woke up in bed.. I had to have passed out again.



----Tuesday then, I guess, honestly the whole few days blurred together I wish I could be more exact I just know it was light out when I woke up again though. I sat up, got out of bed, and realized how weak I felt, heavy, like every movement was this monstrous task, every step took more effort than it should as I worked my way back towards the door.


 I feel embarrassed admitting it now but It took me a good few minutes to open the door.. I stared at that handle like it was red hot, like the shit you picture in the corner of your eye at night, that vuage shapless monster, was on the other side of that door waiting for me, still testing to see if i locked it. I eventually opened the door, I stepped out, and I looked both ways in dead silence before walking towards the bathroom, down that same dark hallway, not really thinking about it in the moment but the second I got into the room I shut the door and locked it behind me, turning on the dim lights, dropping my phone on the counter and splashing water in my face at the sink to wake up. 


Looking at myself I started noticing how bloodshot my eyes looked, how dark the bags under them were, I shook my head and stripped down as I walked to the shower, stepping into it, shutting the glass door carefully and letting the warm water rush over me, I couldn't help but lean back against the wall and slide down till I was sitting in the corner on the floor of the shower, facing the glass as my eyes fluttered open and closed, over, and over.


 I don't think I've ever been this tired, it didn't stop, it didn't  get better, I needed rest. As the hot water hummed away, running over me, beading up on the glass as steam fills the room, I actually felt a little relaxed, i let myself take a deep, long, blink. My eyes stung, the lids felt glued shut ""fuck.."" i mumbled to myself weakly, but I forced them open, and as I looked up at the glass, I immediately regretted not letting myself fall into that deep sleep my body was begging for..



---- through the thousands of beads along the glass, a distorted, not totally clear outline of, at least what looked like, a naked.. old.. man.. was standing there just watching me sit on the cold tile.. i couldnt tell if his arms were too long, or his body was too short, it couldve just been my eyes again but.. I've never felt so caught off guard, vulnerable, but nomatter what ran through my mind I couldn't for the life of me move. I wanted to scream, to make a break for it, but he was so close to the glass, and I was so utterly horrified. 


I sat there, staring back at him, my heart feeling like it was gonna pound out through my ribs, my eyes straining to keep open, and on him. I waited for so long I had pins an needles through my legs, the hot water mustve ran out after a half an hour, i had goosebumps down my entire body as the water ran cold, shaking slightly, till the point of my breath becoming visible, I was starving, and so tired..  but i didnt let myself move out of fear of provoking him.

Hello,
I am M and i have known my bf (female) from work, we still work together and we worked for like 5 years.

Last year i saw a change in her, she started going with me alone to movies/coffee, even she told me some years before that if a girl goes alone with you to coffee it is something good.

She started being gealous for things like talking about meeting with some male colleagues and saying things like “you are happy to see them but you do not do the same for me”.

Also, she gave me gifts that i didn’t expect for her to remember because i told her a lot of time ago and i didn’t even remember.

I also tried to reciprocate, i got her some gifts that i knew she wanted and she was always happy, never told me that i should stop because it is weird.

I want to know if there could be something between us, she’s my best friend and i do not want to ruin our friendship because of a misunderstanding.

What do you think i should do? From my part, i started to like her, i don’t know if she feels the same or she is just friendly.

Hi, everyone from my crevice of the world! 25F, UK, born and raised in the capital. I’ve never had a penpal before, surprisingly, as I adore writing and connecting with others on a deeper level. I want to build a network of creatives to converse with—share our meditations, love for the arts, and fragments of our varicoloured lives.  🎶📖🎨🖌️🎭 Writers, musicians, artists, entrepreneurs, photographers, actors, and or aspiring, hobbyists; let’s encourage and uplift each other in our journeys! 

Creativity and curiosity have been natural to us since childhood. Why shouldn’t these traits be accentuated in adulthood? 

I have always been interested in people. The smallest things interest me. I think every human being is interesting, so feel free to write to me about ANYTHING, especially if you live outside of the UK, and are a French or Russian native speaker. (One of my goals for this year is to begin learning these languages.) I’ve been quite interested in Christianity recently, so I’d love to converse with any Christians or theologians. 

I love literature—especially classics, gothic, and Russian literature; writers like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy. Art, beauty, philosophy, history, nature, architecture, psychology, cinema, politics, religion, and poetry are some of my greatest interests and passions. My book wishlist... does anyone else have a problem buying books before finishing all the ones they already have!? I'm a very passionate person, if you are also passionate about something in your life, whether it’s a new hobby that you’ve picked up, something that you’re studying, or a philosophical musing that has occupied the ivory clouds of your mind. I would love to hear it!

For the foreseeable future due to travel and living arrangements. I will be unable to exchange letters which means our correspondence will have to be through email. I have a lot of love to give to humanity and enjoy the art of letters; if you’re feeling down, or unmotivated and would like to receive a handwritten poem, please let me know. Tell me what you would like the poem to be about and share some things about your life. I adore penmanship and wax seals 💗🕯️ Hopefully my letter can bring you some joy. I write from the soul. 🌌

My only requirements are honesty, being a kind person, 21+ and a platonic friendship.

One of the baristas I often see there was more talkative with me.

I usually order the same thing, but sometimes i do have variants of coffee i decide to choose from, but its usually black coffee.

I asked her for a black coffee, and while preparing it, she asked for my name. She mentioned that she sees me often, ordering the same thing, yet I always seem unsure.... (maybe she sensed im on the spectrum, i have aspergers.)

She goes to talk about how i should say things in a certain way, like a more confident way i guess. A more assertive way essentially.

*(I have a deep voice by the way, and, no one has ever called me out on the way I project my voice; if anything, I get compliments on how deep my voice is.)*

In my head, I was like WTF, why would she feel comfortable saying that to me, I'm not out of shape, not short, I was wearing a gym tank top that showcased my broad shoulders.... How dare she say something like that to me... the nerve of her... (my ego essentially)

Why would she tell me this today, if all the other days, i ordered the same coffee without hesitation. Hard to tell if she was trolling me, or trying to get under my skin. Either way, i think its out of line to make a comment like that to a customer. I don't know her at all. Yes, she's attractive, latina, and a bit shorter than me.

I didn't want to explain myself to her, i really just wanted to smile and respectfully leave, but i caved in and told her i had anxiety, she listens empathically, closer to me now, and she tells me i should practice. She said all this in a cheerful enthusiastic way. I can tell she is a social butterfly, im a complete introvert, and can't stand being around people for long periods of time.

I've seen her again **today,** and the moment i saw her, she smiled at me, and said hi. I order the usual black coffee, and she asked me how my day was... etc, small talk essentially. I never made small talk with her, but maybe she's just doing her job. When i seen her before the unsolicited advice, we didn't make small talk.

I've always been a chill dude, i never needed to beat my chest, or overly assert myself, but i guess i need to sound more assertive apparently. Maybe, there is a stereotype that black men need to be assertive, and dominant, at all times. Just hard going through life, and people telling you how you should be, its very intrusive.",1,1736283776.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

We knew eachkther since highschool, but i felt like he moved too fast in our relationship and i wasn't ready for that so i broke it off 2-3 years ago. He moved back home now and recently told me he wanted to try dating me again. I was so shocked i didn't know what to answer, but he told me he could wait for my yes or no answer and he would tell me his reasoning for trying again, if i said yes. 
I don't know what to say, when i broke up i wasn't feeling mature enough for a serious relationship and i know that's what he is searching for. He works hard, takes care of his mom and grandfather and is building his own house. A totally fine and kind dude. The thing is i never saw him as anything more than a friend, and i felt awkward sometimes in our past relationship. When we were together we met only for two dates and then he had to go abroad to work and we talked online mostly. It was the most time i ever spent in a relationship, but i felt like it was going so fast. He talked about me to his family and mom and wanted to invite me to a family cookout just some months after we started the ""talking phase"". I felt like i wasn't actually attracted to him romantically and told him so on the phone, since he was abroad. 
During the years i noticed he was sad about everything and tried to invite me to coffee once or twice, but i declined feeling like it would bring back bad memories for him. He once asked if i threw out his gift for me, or if i hated him ? I told him that i never hated him. I tried to be a friend and talk normally to him, like i would with every other friend i have. 

I honestly thought he moved on since the breakup and focused on someone else. I honestly am not a great catch either, i am slightly overweight and i can admit i feel lonely sometimes and wish to have a partner. However, i feel like i wouldn't be the partner he deserves or imagines. As far as i know he would like children and a good housewife, while i am not sure i ever wanna have kids and i'm terrible at cooking.  But i also know having a faithful companion in your life is far more valuable than having a hot dude next to you. So i'm conflicted... 

My friend told me to give it a try again. The thing is i come from a very conservative background from a small town, where if they ever saw me once with anyone on a date, the whole family and neighbourhood would know. It wouldn't be as easy as just going on some dates and seeing if we are compatible or not? Cuz what if i don't feel the spark again and reject him for the second time? I don't wanna be the asshole break his heart again. Or waste his time... ",1,1736283654.0,relationship_advice,12,1.0,False

I'm married to my long-term partner (NB27) and engaged to my fiancé (M31) but I'm looking for something new!

Board games (like a huge variety), cats, music, crystals, tattoos, piercings, unhinged memes, TikTok, coffee/energy drinks and reading (horror and smut specifically) 

About me:
I have brown hair typically but I do love dying my hair. Hazel eyes that get called pretty often. I'm a hopeless romantic who loves to cuddle, go on cute dates, send sweet memes/TikToks, I'm loyal and empathetic (almost to a fault), I cannot stand dry conversations, I tend to wear shorts and t-shirts because they're comfy. I'm not religious and very liberal. I'm also a mom! 

What I'm looking for: 
I would love someone who will let me be clingy, respond in a timely manner (or let me know that you're away/busy), have a dark sense of humor, and is open and honest, I tend to prefer thick body types but I'm more into your personality. 

I'm currently looking for online and long-term, but I'd love some new friends, and would be interested in-person if we hit it off, dms are open! ♥️",2,1736283545.0,polyamoryR4R,1,0.75,False

I am diagnosed with Bipolar I. I have manic, psychotic and severe depressive episodes mixed in there, but I am mostly “normal” where my normal leans towards depressed and existential. I typically come across as reserved and rational and I have a resting bit*c face to match. When euthymic, overall, I am not miserable, but I also wouldn’t describe myself as happy or the joy of the party…until now. 

I am trying a new medication for my condition and it seems to be working. I am stable, but get this, I now feel happy. Not manic happy, just like happy and content for once. I am starting to enjoy sunrises and sunsets, cups of coffee, babies, cat pictures, etc, like normal, simple stuff! I feel good. However, this happy and good feeling is super new to me, so new and foreign that every time I realize I am feeling happy and normal, which is every hour or so, I get this urge to want to express it because OMG I finally feel happy and I have spent the last 42 years under a gray cloud and I just can’t believe most everyone gets to experience this as their normal and this is potentially my new normal, and OMG I JUST FEEL HAPPY for once!!! I am constantly amazed and in awe at this new feeling. 

Problem is I don’t know what to do with it. If I want to share my newfound joy with friends or family they either become annoyed or think I am becoming manic. I hate to have to limit the expression of my joy to avoid annoying or worrying them. I am sure I’ll get used to this new feeling (though it’s been 4 months and I still can’t get over it) and the urge to express it will subside, in the meantime, what can I do with and about my new found happiness that is overflowing?!?? 

How does one manage or process the “happy” feeling. Like what do you do with it? Again this is not mania or hypomania, I just feel happy and since it is new to me I am somewhat in awe of the feeling. ",4,1736283364.0,bipolar,5,1.0,False

But: after logging my pigeon milk consumption, I’d like to report a pattern:

**Brewster only offers pigeon milk if the time of day is at least** ***10 minutes earlier*** **than your previous login.** 

  
Well, either that, or it really is random and I’ve just had a VERY long string of coincidences 😅

**Example:**

Day 1: you get coffee at 🌤️11am.  
Day 2: you get coffee at ⛅️10am- earlier than yesterday. 🥛Milk offered!  
Day 3: you get coffee at 🌘7pm- later than yesterday. 🚫No regurgitated milk for you.  
Day 4: you get coffee at ☀️2pm- earlier than yesterday. 🥛Milk offered!  
Day 5: you get coffee at ☀️1:50pm- 10mins earlier than yesterday. 🥛Milk offered!  
Day 6: you get coffee at ☀️1:45pm- 5mins earlier than yesterday. 🚫Not earlier enough; no milk for you!

\-

**What about Time Travel?**

Time traveling into the **FUTURE**:   
It seems like only the TIME of day, rather than the AMOUNT of days, has an effect.  
Example: You get coffee at 🌘7pm. You travel 2 weeks into the future and get coffee at 🌤️11am. 🥛Milk offered!

EXCEPTION: there seems to be a limit to how far ahead you can travel before Brewster keeps his milk to himself. When I tried going forward a year, 🚫no milk for me (even though the time of day was earlier than previous).

Time traveling into the **PAST**:  
🚫No milk at all, no matter the time of day, no matter how far into the past. 

EXCEPTION: after all this time travel testing, I reset my console time to sync with the internet. My previous login was in year 2026 in the 🌤️morning, and my new synced login was today (2025) in the ☀️afternoon- and he offered milk🥛.

Those two were the only exceptions, after a weekish of tracking daily login play, and \[counts\] 17 time travel trips.

CONTROL INFO that may or may not have an effect on results: I have unlocked the >!Brewstoid!< gift, and I say “yes” every time he offers pigeon milk.

**WHO CARES? PIGEON MILK IS GROSS?**

    The ground out there is a collage of complimenting colors. Inky mud deep and dark enough to swallow one whole, mixed with streaks of viridian grasses wet with condensed morning tears. On top of that, coarse and cracked grey concrete sidewalk, and the pure-white-cloudiness of the snow and the mist.

    The large, dull-grey eyes of the man fixate on an old oak tree with a cold and morbid curiosity. Its branches are twisted and deformed; they’re slumped down in shame.

It all started like any other Friday night. Our group had gathered at Mark’s place to hang out, debate which movie to watch, and enjoy some pizza. Nicole was there, sitting cross-legged on the couch, laughing at something silly I said. That laugh—it was effortless, bright, and it lit up the room.

I shouldn’t have been staring, but I couldn’t help it. The way her hair cascaded over her shoulders, the sparkle in her eyes when she smiled—it was magnetic. Every moment with her felt special, like we were the only two people in the room.

“Ethan?” Mark waved a hand in front of my face, snapping me back to reality. “You zoned out, man. You okay?”

“Yeah,” I replied quickly, grabbing a slice of pizza. “Just thinking about the game tomorrow.”

He grinned. “We’re gonna crush them!”

But my mind wasn’t on basketball. It was on Nicole. She wasn’t just stunning; she was kind, funny, and we shared so many interests—music, books, even a weird obsession with vintage arcade games. The more time I spent with her, the deeper I fell.

The guilt gnawed at me every time I saw her with Mark. They seemed happy, but I noticed the small things—how he’d dismiss her opinions or forget little promises. She deserved better, but who was I to interfere? He was my friend, after all.


---

One night, the weight of my feelings became too much to bear. I headed over to Ryan’s place, hoping to get some advice.

“Ryan,” I began, slumping onto his couch. “I need to tell you something, but you have to promise to keep it between us.”

He raised an eyebrow, a sly grin forming. “Sounds serious. Spill.”

I took a deep breath. “I think I’m in love with Nicole.”

He whistled softly. “Mark’s girl? That’s... complicated.”

“I know,” I groaned. “I feel terrible about it. I’d never act on it, but I can’t stop thinking about her.”

He leaned back, eyes glinting with something I couldn't quite place. “Well, secrets are safe with me, man. Maybe you should tell her how you feel.”

“I can’t do that to Mark,” I insisted. “I just needed to tell someone.”

He patted my shoulder. “No worries. Your secret’s safe here.”

Relief washed over me. “Thanks, Ryan. I appreciate it.”


---

A couple of days later, while grabbing coffee at our favorite café, Mark barged in, his face flushed with anger.

“Ethan!” he shouted, causing heads to turn. “We need to talk. Now.”

I stood up, confused. “What’s going on?”

“Don’t play dumb,” he snarled. “Ryan told me everything. How you think I don't deserve Nicole and that you're planning to steal her from me.”

My heart sank. “What? I never said that!”

“Stop lying!” His eyes were filled with hurt and fury. “I trusted you, and you go behind my back like this?”

“Mark, I swear, that's not true! Ryan must have misunderstood or something.”

He shook his head. “I thought you were my friend.” Then, in a shocking move, he spat at me before storming out.

I stood there, stunned, as whispers and stares from the other patrons enveloped me. Humiliation burned my cheeks.


---

Fuming, I marched over to Ryan's apartment. He opened the door with a smug look.

“Why, hello, Ethan,” he drawled.

“Why did you lie to Mark about what I said?” I demanded.

He feigned innocence. “Lie? I just told him what you told me.”

“You twisted my words! I never said he didn't deserve her or that I'd steal her!”

He smirked. “Maybe I heard what you really meant.”

“Why are you doing this?” I asked, desperation creeping into my voice.

He stepped closer, his expression darkening. “Because I can. And maybe I like seeing you squirm.”

I realized then that Ryan wasn't the friend I thought he was. “You're sick,” I whispered before turning away.


---

That evening, seeking solace, I found myself at a dimly lit bar downtown. The hum of conversation and clinking glasses did little to soothe my turmoil. I nursed a beer, contemplating how everything had spiraled out of control.

As I headed to the restroom, I noticed Ryan in a corner, engaged in a hushed conversation with a shady-looking guy. Curiosity piqued, I watched from a distance. Ryan discreetly handed over small packets in exchange for cash. My eyes widened—he was dealing drugs.

A mix of anger and opportunity surged within me. Pulling out my phone, I discreetly recorded the transaction. Evidence.


---

The next morning, I confronted Ryan once more.

“Ryan,” I said coldly, holding up my phone. “Care to explain this?”

He glanced at the screen, and his face paled. “Delete that. Now.”

“Not happening,” I replied firmly. “You're going to tell Mark the truth—that you lied—or this video goes straight to the police.”

He sneered, but there was fear in his eyes. “You wouldn't dare.”

I met his gaze steadily. “Try me.”

After a tense moment, he relented. “Fine. I'll talk to him.”


---

True to his word, Ryan confessed to Mark. Later that day, Mark approached me while I was shooting hoops at the park.

“Hey,” he called out awkwardly.

“Hey,” I replied, not sure where we stood.

“Ryan told me everything. About how he lied. I'm... I'm sorry I didn't believe you.”

I shrugged. “It's okay. I get why you'd be upset.”

He kicked at the dirt. “Nicole broke up with me.”

I looked up sharply. “What? Why?”

He sighed. “She said she has feelings for someone else.”

My heart skipped a beat. “Did she say who?”

He gave a small, bitter laugh. “Yeah. You.”

I was speechless.

He held up a hand. “Look, I'm not mad anymore. Maybe this is how it's supposed to be. Just... treat her right, okay?”

“Mark, I don't know what to say.”

He offered a weak smile. “You don't have to say anything.”


---

A few days later, Nicole and I met up at the little bookstore we both loved.

“I heard about what happened with Mark,” I began hesitantly.

She nodded. “I wanted to tell you sooner, but everything was so complicated.”

“Do you really... have feelings for me?” I asked cautiously.

She reached out to take my hand. “Yes, Ethan. I do. I've felt this way for a while.”

Relief and joy washed over me. “I feel the same,” I admitted.

She smiled, that radiant smile that made everything else fade away. “So, where do we go from here?”

“Anywhere you want,” I replied, grinning.


---

A week later, as things began to settle, I thought about the chaos Ryan had caused. His manipulation, his drug dealings—it wasn't something I could ignore. Remembering the video on my phone, I made a decision.

I walked into the local police station and handed over my phone. “I'd like to report illegal drug activity,” I said to the officer at the desk.


---

A few days passed before news spread that Ryan had been arrested. Mark called me up.

“Did you hear about Ryan?” he asked.

“Yeah,” I replied quietly.

“Did you... have anything to do with it?”

I paused. “I couldn't let him keep hurting people, Mark.”

He was silent for a moment. “Maybe it's for the best.”


---

With Ryan held accountable and the truth out in the open, a weight lifted off my shoulders. Nicole and I continued to grow closer, building a relationship founded on honesty and shared dreams.

One evening, as we watched the sunset from a hill overlooking the city, she rested her head on my shoulder.

“Do you think all of this happened for a reason?” she murmured.

I thought about the twists and turns, the pain and the unexpected outcomes. “Maybe,” I replied. “Maybe it led us here.”

She smiled softly. “I'm glad it did.”

And for the first time in a long while, I felt genuinely hopeful about what the future might hold.

1hw1g4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1hw1g4s/need_advice_on_estrangement/,Need Advice On Estrangement,"Hey all,

I'm trying to go no contact with my mom but not her side of the family and need advice.

Basically, I've never had a relationship with my mom, she left when I was 3 and has barely acknowledged my existence ever since. Growing up, I always had the fake presents on the coffee table, every school play missed, every major achievement or milestone skipped out on, and it was always on me to call her while she was playing perfect mum on Facebook.

A main highlight's from my 13th birthday. I got my first letter from her ever, and I was so excited I read it aloud to my dad and grandparents, only for the letter to be about getting a new baby sister and a potential step father who was closer to my age than hers (she was late 30s by this point). When I visited mom to meet this sister, turns out she was also 7-8 months pregnant with my brother. And then asked to borrow £50 for a takeaway that night.

I started low contact after another broken promise for my 21st birthday, she was going to take me to comic con as a way to ""make up"" for... well, everything. She even showed me the receipt of her buying 2 tickets as proof and she'd keep me updated for travel and accommodation costs, which I was happy to help with. Next thing I know she's showing me photos she took with Jason Mamoa and Matthew Lillard gushing about comic con that she went to with one of her friends.

We only talked during a group family call on Christmas and New Year's. Problem is, those phone calls always ruin the holiday for me because I've grown to have this bubble of anger towards my mom and I've had to swallow it for peace, swifly followed by anxiety from the anger bursting out and grief after the call seeing my siblings grow up through a 2 minute facetime session. This year, I finally bit the bullet and spoke to everyone on her side of the family but her for the holidays. I've got nothing against them as her parents helped me a LOT throughout life and are genuinely amazing grandparents, same with my aunt, and I can't fault my siblings for being born to her, I've even got hope that I can fully bond with that side of the family as there was no anxiety of having to deal with my mom, and my siblings are old enough for their own devices so I don't need to go through her now!

Problem is, now my Mom's messaged me on every platform asking why I've talked to them and not her. Is there any way to keep it no contact or do I have to swallow this anger every time I want to have a connection to my better relatives? Do I need to cut off that entire side if I want to maintain no contact? Is there a way of explaining why without things blowing up? Should I even explain it to her in the first place? My brain's been buzzing since she noticed after New Year's (yes, she didn't notice on Christmas that I didn't even text her like last year)

I tried explaining my feelings to her before but it led to me being ostracised from that side of the family for 3 years, and I really don't want that again!",3,1736282547.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,0.81,False

Frequent visitor of Chicago with a solid number of friends now moving into the city. I know that there’s an abundance of museums, parks, coffee shops, stores, etc. that pique the interest of many.

That’s just not who I am as a person - not that I have anything against it, but I’ve always been incredibly introverted and love living a peaceful life.

I love having downtime after work and usually spend time reading and watching sports. I don’t know if I’ll make the most of Chicago and if I’ll be wasting money on high expenses - if I don’t partake in a common activity I know is found here.

Just recently upgraded my espresso machine from a Rancilio Silvia with PID to this lovely Mara X. Couldn't be happier with this upgrade. Now I feel like the time has come to try another grinder. I've had the DF64 gen II with SSP Lab Sweets for 1 year now, and though it tastes good when dialed in, I feel like the flaws of this machine is getting to me. 

What i dont like about this grinder: 

\- Impossible to change from filter to espresso and get a decent shot without dialing in again.   
\- Retention in the shute is pretty bad actually.   
\- Cleaning the burrs sucks causing you to need to recalibrate the 0 position.   
\- The filter coffee it produces is kind of dull. I have a ZP6

What I drink:   
\- Morning pourover with the ZP6. Light roast coffee.  
\- Afternoon cappuccino/flat white/ espresso. Medium roast or light roasts. I do RDT, WDT, distribution and leveled tamp. 

Now - I have had my eyes on the new Option-O Lagom Casa 65 (65 because of the better grind time). Seems like a very well built grinder with 0 retention, easy cleaning, light roast oriented, and the ability to better switch from pour over to espresso. My ZP6 is absolutely fantastic, but i'm interested to try another take on pour over grinding. 

What alternatives should I be looking at? Timemore 078S? Others?

Budget: around 700$ US. (What the Lagom Casa cost where i'm at.)

-I started the conversation on Hinge by relating to something in her photos. I always try to make open ended statements, probably half the time I’m not even asking a question, and if I do ask a question I do my best to not make it a yes/no question.

-Her attraction level was probably a 6. It made it very easy to ask her out. I gave her a day, then a time and place. This was on a Tuesday. On Saturday, I asked if she was keeping the date. Not textbook but I’m not driving an hour and paying a bridge toll to prove anything.

-I dressed casually but I was well groomed and wearing nice cologne. I opened the door for her, we ordered and I was a gentleman to her and the wait staff and left a tip. 

-Now the important part. We sat down opposite each other and I let her do most of the talking. Probably 75%. I circled back on things mentioned previously, cracked jokes and smiled. I said little about myself and when I did I put a positive spin on things and left things opaque. This was BY FAR the most comfortable I have ever been on a date. I wasn’t sweating, nervous or yammering. 

-We went for a walk afterwards and she was bumping into me and sometimes walking too close. She didn’t take my hand or anything but I can at least read this behavior now (formerly clueless man 🙋). I didn’t close with a kiss (I didn’t read that level of attraction) but she did ask if I would see her again. I said yes. I am planning to ask her out again tomorrow.

I think a lot went right. It’s so much easier to ask out women who are attracted to you. Like CW said, THEY WILL MAKE IT EASY IF THEY ARE ATTRACTED TO YOU. I could have flirted more but I am still working on it. I also need to work on some strategies to escalate things but I am proud of myself.

I've had the Libre3+ for almost two months and have been looking at the data that comes from it. (I still think it reads low, but that's another issue).  One thing I have noticed is my blood sugar begins to rise between 4-6am and tends to creep up to usually at the days highest (except for spikes where it goes back down) around noon. 


I usually wake and get ready for work around 7am.  I am not a big  early morning breakfast person, physically can't as I get nauseated, but usually have coffee (black) and then a handful of nuts and some cheese around 9-10am.   


I tried having a protein drink this morning at 830am and my blood sugar did not lower as I thought it may (20g carbs: 8g fiber, 1g sugar, 21g protein in oat milk 6g carbs, 1 fiber, o sugar, 3 protein) but steadily rose (with little dips and peaks). I did dnt have what is call a spike, but a steady rise. This surprised me as I thought protein in the morning may help with the dawn phenomenon. 


How do others deal with this phenomenon? Since getting the Libre3+ I am much more aware levels and find it helpful overall, but will admit i can get a little obsessive at watching it as I try to figure out what foods affect me in what ways. 


Any advice or thoughts from others who have experienced this are welcome .  I am still learning what is ""normal"" and how to interpret my readings. (Just to note I am under medical supervision and the other obvs listen to/talk to my doc, but am looking for real life advice/experiences as well.)

Anyway hi, to those who don't know, two years ago I made an EP taking every poem from the first game with a rhyme in it and setting it to music. Now I'm taking them all and revising them. This means Yuri only gets one poem, but it's the longest on the EP and one of my favorites overall. I even want through the trouble of getting my coffee (no tea available) and cigarillo, which the lighting is the sound in the beginning, so I could get in the mood... Hehe.

I did it on day one of week 28. I was allowed to eat before mine (didn’t need to fast) and drink water while waiting for the blood draw. I avoid carbs and sugar beforehand, so I had black coffee, two hard boiled eggs, an avocado with salt, and some pistachios. The drink I had for the test was clear and tasted like Sprite and I had to drink it within 5 minutes. While I waited I hung out in the lobby and drank water, played on my phone, and didn’t really notice anything in my body. Maybe a tiny increase in heart rate and also the baby was very wiggly. Reacting to sugar possibly?

A little bit about us: A family of 3 including an 11 year old adventurer.  Its our 5th trip to Belize and we love it there for the people and ability to reconnect with each other and nature.  We are probably mid-budget travelers, and comfortable in more rustic accommodations.  We try not to jam pack our days because we also enjoy relaxing. Not huge partiers or crowd-type people.

**San Ignacio**

* We rented a car from [Crystal Auto Rental](https://crystalautorentalbelize.com/) \- all went according to plan.
* We stayed at [Crystal Paradise Resort](https://www.crystalparadise.com/) \- this was our third stay at this lovely Belizean-owned family establishment.  We absolutely LOVE it here.  Carolita is the chef and she makes fantastic family-style Belizean meals for breakfast and dinner.  Birds come at eat from the feeders and it's the BEST to drink coffee and watch the birds.  Our kiddo loved to roam the grounds.  We overlapped with a few other families and the kids all enjoyed playing together.  The resort is located in Cristo Rey which is a little outside of San Ignacio.  They also participate in 'Pack for a Purpose' so you are able to donate school supplies if you're able.
* Day 1: Lunch at [Black Rock Lodge](https://www.blackrocklodge.com/) \- what a beautiful place and a scenic drive!  We were able to enjoy the property - there are extensive hiking trails (including a trail) but really, we just swam on their beach, which includes a rope swing.  After some 'play' time, we enjoyed lunch in their dining room.  I confirmed via WhatsApp that it was ok for us to utilize the property if we were eating lunch there.
* Day 2: (Christmas Eve) - We did Cave Tubing and Ziplining at Nohoch Che'en Caves Branch.  This was our first time doing this.  We felt the ziplining was good (theres other better ones in the area), but the cave tubing was excellent!
* Day 3: (Christmas Day) - Lunch at [Authentic Flavors](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yAmCTPM3fbTspS678) \- wow!  First time here and it was SO GOOD.  And open on Christmas day which was a huge help for us.  In the evening we went on a night tour with Eric Tut of [Birding in Belize.](https://www.birdinginbelize.com/birding-tours/)  He took us to the Spanish Lookout area and we saw too may birds to name but including potoos, bat hawks, eastern meadowlark, forked tail flycatcher, and barn owls. Other animals included foxes, coatimundis, possums, howler monkeys, and heard a tapir.  Eric was amazing and also super patient with the 11 year old.
* Day 4: [Rio on Pools](https://g.co/kgs/9q7zQ4A) \- always a blast, and the road is SO MUCH BETTER year-over-year.  Also this night, back at the resort, the 11 year old was able to find a scorpion at night using a UV light so that was pretty fun!
* Day 5: Cooking Class at[ San Antonios Womens Coop](https://g.co/kgs/raifyUD) \- this was an incredible 3+ hour experience cooking and eating.  It wasn't 100% traditional mayan, but definitely mayan inspired.  We also received copies of the recipes to take home.  That afternoon we took the kiddo to [Monkey Falls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QjZGv9f8aeMNXT7b9) \- which is the local Cristo Rey waterfall.  There were lots of local kids swimming and playing, so the kiddo enjoyed having playmates.  There was a fair amount of trash, but this is not a tourist destination but rather a local hangout.
* Day 6:  Another favorite of ours- [The Belize Raptor Center](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qWjubHYWg7yn967M7) \- we did the VIP tour which included four up-close encounters with raptors.  Since we've been there before, they let us provide input on which birds to interact with.  This is hugely educational and fun - and we think they're doing great work in the community!!  For lunch we went back to  [Authentic Flavors](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yAmCTPM3fbTspS678) due to proximity and tastiness.  That evening we went back to [Monkey Falls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QjZGv9f8aeMNXT7b9) as a last hurrah in Cristo Rey.
* Day 7: Travel to Caye Caulker via driving to Belize City, returning rental car, and taking the water taxi out to Caye Caulker.

**Caye Caulker**

* We stayed at [Comfy Cabana Tropical Dreams](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/985520?source_impression_id=p3_1736279864_P3lQoS2KHX47emER) \- which is an AirBnb on the Southern side of the island.  For us it was a very convenient location, and included a shared pool.  I was unsure if the kiddo would use the pool when we'd be in the water a bunch - spoiler alert - he did!  The place did not include bikes so we had to rent them.
* Overall, I would say the cost on Caye Caulker has gone up substantially (much like the rest of the world).  While 7 years ago I'd be able to call this a 'budget vacation' -- it is no longer to us.  I would certainly be prepared to open your wallet accordingly!
* Day 7 (cont'd): A swim down at the Split, and dinner at [Wish Willy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z9SZMPfQ7JizLNki8)\- a favorite and thus our first dinner!
* Day 8: Swims at[ Iguana Reef](https://maps.app.goo.gl/u56fY2CpYiGCnKk7A), and we paid a visit to the [Caye Caulker Library](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bTYgCTt61RFfUcjh8) to donate books and purchase post cards which benefit the library and high school.  If you're going to Caye Caulker, I recommend reaching out to them via WhatsApp and bringing books to donate.  Dinner at [Elba's Little Kitchen](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mbkfDTNrvrSjJZE29) \-- highly recommend the conch fritters!!
* Day 9: (New Years Eve) Breakfast at [Suggestion Gourmet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WTX69T7WCpJXgEjA7) \- I love their smoothie bowl!  We had lunch at [The Pelican Sunset Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WBk2Bu6XWYhRF66z6) \- and were pleasantly surprised!  We've been there before for the sunset but this was the first time eating there and we all really enjoyed it.  The water was clear and the kiddo was able to spot a lot of sea life as well.
* Day 10: (New Years Day) - a lazy rainy day in which we hung out at home.  We had dinner at Il [Pellicano Cucina Italiana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qgb21ubuaPuCRpbK9) \- delicious fresh pasta and a really nice 'date night'.
* Day 11: More rain!  But we made the most of it. Lunch at[ Chef Juans](https://maps.app.goo.gl/byjDoMD8HPhUZc9V8) where his pulled pork sandwich is chefs kiss!  We did some swimming, shopping, biking, meandering.  Then the rain really hit so we had some more indoor time.  For dinner we ordered DELIVERY from [Suggestion Gourmet](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WTX69T7WCpJXgEjA7) \- great crispy pizza and lasagna!  They even brought it to our door in the rain!
* Day 12: Rain stopped so we had to get OUT.  We swam and got out - including tamales from the tamale guy riding around, and some take out from [Jenny's To Go Food](https://maps.app.goo.gl/epMHpjrHpmtoQrAo9) (try the special fry jack.). Dinner back at Elbas because, why not.
* Day 13: Fishing trip with [Gerald and Gerald](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kuGqyXiWVCFz6b9RA) \-- we tried to go off-shore fishing but the water was just too rough.  So at some point we decided just to pivot and come inland.  Once we did, we still caught a GIANT barracuda, and two trevally jacks.  He parked the boat for a nice picnic and dip in the water.  It was really, really fun - and I'm glad even though the waves were rough he was able to pivot to a better experience for us and the kiddo.  We cooked the fish for dinner.  We hope to try off-shore fishing in a future trip.
* Day 14: Last full day!  Whew!  Lots of swimming at the Split and Iguana Reef.  The current was REALLY BAD this day and the kiddo really struggled with the current by the Split.  He's a really solid swimmer and has never had a problem there before - so this is a good reminder for the parents to keep eyes on your kid even if they are strong swimmers!!!  A stop by the playground.  Dinner at [Wish Willy](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Z9SZMPfQ7JizLNki8)\- who cooked up our remaining fish for us.
* Day 15: Water Taxi to airport to head home.

1hw1441,https://www.reddit.com/r/PregnancyUK/comments/1hw1441/how_much_did_you_save_ahead_of_maternity/,How much did you save ahead of maternity?,"Hi all! I’m currently 18w pregnant (FTM), and although it hasn’t been agreed with my employer, if all goes well with the pregnancy, I’m hoping to be able to continue working until the first week of June (due 10th June).

My employer offers standard maternity leave (6 weeks 90% salary, 33 weeks SMP). I’m hoping to take the full 52 weeks so I want to get finances straight.

I am the higher earner out of me and my partner. He’s on a decent wage, and our bare minimum monthly outgoings (eg, mortgage, average bills, food, utilities like petrol for his commute) come to about £750 split between us (so £1,500 total). I may have done my calculations incorrectly, but I think it means that the weekly statutory payment covers my half of the bills with a little buffer.

Essentially, I want to ensure there’s enough saved between us so that we can cover the bills etc, and so that we can still enjoy a nice quality of life without being constantly worried about money until I’m back at work. Nothing extravagant lifestyle wise, but covering things like baby classes, going for coffees or nice family days out.

I suppose what I’m asking is what kind of “lifestyle” spend did people budget for/spend when on maternity, so I can factor that into monthly outgoings on top of bills etc.

I have a bit saved already. My partner has less saved (he wasn’t always the most financially savvy until recently, but he’s put a lot of hard work into building a pot up), but is committed to putting a decent chunk of his wage aside to both cover big purchases for the baby as well as go towards the household when I’m on Mat leave.

For context, I am a bit of a worrier when it comes to money (despite being a good saver), so I may be overthinking this!

Sorry for the ramble - any insight into how you approached this would be really useful x

I will now have to wait for the specialist to call me for an appointment to come up with a plan for myself. He says that he believes that I will need. Diet excerise and insulin 🫣 my anxiety is off the roof to say the least. Has anyone gone through something similar with a positive outcome? Is there anything thing anyone recommends that I should start doing. I already cut coffee sweets and sodas from my diet when he told me I failed the initial test which was only a week ago told myself that I will do better for myself even if I did pass the 3 hour test. But that’s not my outcome so now it really has to be implanted and stick. I’m just so tired at this point. I’m already high risk due to having short cervix and the appointments have been non stop. Taking aspirin every night for precautionary measures because I had a bit of hypertension after I gave birth to my 1st born six years ago. So that’s been already giving me a head start on anxiety but now I’m feeling defeated. 😞 ,3,1736281668.0,GestationalDiabetes,4,0.81,False

The Rancilio Silvia V3 is a highly regarded espresso machine among coffee enthusiasts, known for its robust build and reliable performance. This review delves into its features, operation, maintenance, and overall value, helping you determine if it's the right espresso machine for your home.

## Overview of the Rancilio Silvia V3: A Workhorse for Home Baristas

The Rancilio Silvia V3 boasts a compact yet sturdy design.  Measuring 13.25""""H x 11.25""""W x 9.25""""D and weighing 30 pounds, it's a substantial machine that feels built to last. The stainless steel casing and steel frame contribute to its professional aesthetic and robust feel.  Its Italian heritage and a 12-month parts and labor warranty offer reassurance to buyers.  This machine isn't just aesthetically pleasing; it's built to withstand daily use.  The built-in 2-liter water tank is a convenient feature, minimizing the need for frequent refills.

## Key Features:  Brass Construction and Ergonomic Design

A standout feature of the Rancilio Silvia V3 is its **brass construction**.  The brass boiler and grouphead are responsible for the machine's excellent temperature stability.  Unlike aluminum boilers found in some entry-level machines, brass retains heat more effectively, leading to more consistent espresso extraction. This contributes significantly to the quality and consistency of your shots.  This is a key differentiator compared to machines like the Gaggia Classic, which uses an aluminum boiler, often resulting in temperature fluctuations.

The **ergonomic portafilter**, with its chrome-plated brass handle, is another well-designed feature. Its weight is carefully balanced to minimize wrist strain during use.  The **stainless steel steam wand** is efficient at producing microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos, a testament to Rancilio's attention to detail in every aspect of the machine's design.  The 1100-watt power consumption under 120 volts ensures efficient operation without excessive energy use.

## Espresso Performance: Achieving Consistent Results

The Rancilio Silvia V3 excels in temperature stability, a crucial factor for consistent espresso extraction. The combination of the brass boiler and grouphead minimizes temperature fluctuations, resulting in shots with excellent crema and balanced flavor profiles.  However, achieving optimal results requires proper technique.  **Proper tamping** is essential; inconsistent tamping can lead to uneven extraction and a less than ideal shot.  Experimenting with the **coffee-to-water ratio** is also crucial to find the perfect balance for your preferred beans.

While the machine is generally reliable, some users report experiencing """"temperature surfing"""" –  fluctuations in water temperature during extraction. This can be mitigated through careful preheating and consistent use.  For those seeking even tighter temperature control, a PID controller can be added as an aftermarket upgrade.


## Milk Steaming and Microfoam: Mastering Latte Art

The stainless steel steam wand performs admirably, producing the microfoam essential for creating velvety lattes and cappuccinos.  Mastering milk steaming requires practice, but the Silvia V3’s wand provides the tools to achieve that perfect, silky texture.  Tips for achieving perfect microfoam include:

* **Purging the wand:**  Before steaming, purge the wand to remove any condensed water.
* **Correct angle:** Hold the pitcher at a 45-degree angle, submerging the tip slightly below the surface.
* **Maintain consistent pressure:**  Avoid fluctuating the pressure during the steaming process.
* **Practice:** Experiment to find the ideal steam pressure and temperature for your desired milk texture.

## Maintenance and Cleaning: Keeping Your Silvia V3 in Top Shape

Regular maintenance is vital for the longevity and performance of your Rancilio Silvia V3.  A daily cleaning routine, involving rinsing the portafilter, group head, and steam wand, is essential.  More thorough cleaning should be done weekly.  Descaling the machine every 3-6 months (or more frequently depending on water hardness) is crucial to prevent mineral buildup and ensure optimal performance.  This involves using a dedicated descaling solution following the manufacturer's instructions.  Regular calibration, while not always strictly necessary, can further optimize the machine’s performance.

Common maintenance issues include clogged steam wands and group head blockages.  These can usually be resolved with thorough cleaning using appropriate tools and descaling solutions.


## Comparison with Other Espresso Machines:  The Silvia V3’s Strengths

The Rancilio Silvia V3 sits comfortably in the upper echelon of entry-level espresso machines.  Compared to machines like the Gaggia Classic and Sage Bambino Plus, the Silvia V3 offers superior build quality, notably the brass boiler, resulting in better temperature stability. While the Gaggia Classic is a popular and reliable option, it lacks the robust construction and consistent temperature control of the Silvia V3. The Sage Bambino Plus, while user-friendly, sacrifices some of the advanced features and build quality found in the Silvia V3.  The Silvia V3 offers a compelling balance of performance, features, and value.

## Industry Recommendations and User Feedback:  A Proven Performer

The Rancilio Silvia V3 has garnered significant positive feedback from both professional baristas and home enthusiasts.  Many online reviews on sites like Home-Barista.com highlight its reliability, consistent performance, and ease of use.  While not without its minor drawbacks (like the smaller boiler capacity), the overall consensus points to a machine that delivers excellent results for its price point.  It's a machine frequently recommended for those serious about home espresso making who are ready to move beyond entry-level machines.

## Conclusion: The Rancilio Silvia V3 – A Smart Investment

The Rancilio Silvia V3 is a robust and reliable espresso machine that delivers excellent performance. Its brass construction, ergonomic design, and consistent temperature stability make it a top choice for home baristas seeking to elevate their espresso game. While requiring some initial investment and a commitment to proper maintenance, the Silvia V3 provides a rewarding experience for years to come, offering excellent value for money.  Its combination of build quality, performance, and user-friendly design makes it a strong contender in the home espresso machine market.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Does the Rancilio Silvia V3 require a grinder?**

A: Yes, you'll need a separate burr grinder to ensure consistently ground coffee for optimal espresso extraction.

**Q: How often should I descale my Rancilio Silvia V3?**

A: Descaling frequency depends on your water hardness.  Generally, descaling every 3-6 months is recommended, but more frequent descaling may be necessary in areas with hard water.

**Q: Can I use the Rancilio Silvia V3 with different types of coffee beans?**

A: Yes, the Silvia V3 is compatible with various coffee beans.  Experimenting with different roasts and origins is part of the fun of espresso making!

A: The Rancilio Silvia V3 typically comes with a 12-month parts and labor warranty.  Check with your retailer for details.

a couple of months ago, i started looking for alternatives to the usual stuff like coffee or energy drinks. they’d always give me a quick boost but leave me feeling jittery and exhausted later. one day, a friend recommended these things called nectar patches. at first, i laughed because i didn’t think a patch you stick on your skin could do anything, but i was desperate and gave it a shot.

y’all. the difference was insane. the focus patch didn’t make me feel wired or anxious, but it was like my brain suddenly had clarity for the first time in years. i started getting through my tasks faster, didn’t need to check my phone every five minutes, and even found myself feeling calm while being productive. it’s been such a game-changer that i’m not sure how i managed without it.

what’s cool is you can just peel it off whenever you’re done and don’t need the boost anymore. i didn’t expect this little thing to have such a big impact, but honestly, it’s been one of the best decisions i’ve made for myself. has anyone else here tried patches for focus or other things? would love to hear your experiences.",1,1736281483.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Cesarean section 6 months ago 
No existing health conditions 

For the past month or so I have been experiencing right side abdominal discomfort. I wouldn’t say “pain” as it is more of an ache. I can feel something in my abdomen. The best way I can put it into words is like an oblong sausage shaped lump. Only felt on the inside, not visible on the outside. I can roll it around and I do feel pressure when pressing. Sometimes when pressing on this side of my abdomen I can hear and feel gas. I feel discomfort in the area sometimes when bending over or sitting with my legs up. I have had an excessive amount of gas and burping. To the point I googled how many farts a day are normal because I was shocked at what was coming out of me. You can laugh, I’m laughing too. I have always been very constipated. Easily go 5+ days with no bowel movement. Recently I have had a change in frequency of bowel movements along with consistency. I feel constipated but my bowel movements will come along after a cup of coffee, or a meal, and will be a loose bowel. No blood since the start of the bowel changes. The only time I have experienced blood is when I have been extremely constipated and was passing large and hard stools or have had a visible hemorrhoid. I feel nausea often. Mostly after a meal depending on what I eat. I experience back pain most of the day off and on… right lower side of the back and right flank. It worsens when I lay down at night. Last symptom would be reoccurring UTI feeling that just goes away on its own. Frequent urination, vaginal pains, etc. I originally thought I was dealing with a kidney stone possibly due to frequent urination and back pain, until the bowel symptoms came along.  

In 2022 I did have a CT after mentioning mild discomfort to the same area, constipation and again feeling this same “lump” although it felt much less inflamed back then. Nothing was found.

I realize there’s many things this could be… just curious if anything jumps out to anyone as a red flag.

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1hw0uks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1hw0uks/my_brother_strongly_likely_autistic_has_0_care/,My brother (strongly likely autistic) has 0 care towards his health and the cleanliness of his environment.  I am worried about the long-term health impacts. How do I get him to engage in things beneficial for his personal and environmental health?,"Met up with him for the holidays, and earlier in 2024 I stayed at his flat. I am increasingly concerned about his seemingly complete apathy towards his physical health and the cleanliness of his environment. 


**Environment**: I'm not talking about it being messy. I'm messy. I'm talking about years worth of encrusted gunk on the edges of his counters, hair all over the sink, a toilet bowl the colour of toast, and being told he tidied for my arrival only to find dirty underwear on the floor. I offered to help clean, and cleared a section of counter of the rubbish, gunk, and broken equipment in his kitchen. I had to buy cleaning spray and cloths. I dread seeing how it is now, 6 months later. I also pushed and got him to let me get rid of his broken microwave (broken for months) and broken coffee grinder (which he considered usable because it would grind if he held it in a very specific position; the wires were hanging out). He still has his broken counter-top washing machine. He never opens his curtains, so there is that smell that comes from a room being permeated with bacteria that would otherwise be killed by sunlight.


He's expressed,  insofar as he expresses emotions or desires, that he would like his friends to come over more and stay longer when they do. I gently suggested he clean. He shrugged and said, ""whatever"".


**Health**: To my knowledge he has no inherited physical conditions such as asthma or EDS. He goes for a walk with friends once a week, and that seems to be the entirety of his exercise. Everything he got up from a sofa over the holidays, he said, ""Oof, my legs, come on, work"", or words to that effect. On one occasion, when it was just us two, I said in response that he needs to do something to strengthen his legs so it doesn't become a debilitating problem later, he replied his catchphrase of, ""Eh."" and said it was no big deal, and I concluded by saying, ""I'm being serious"". I am. He shuffles like a 60 year old man. He can't crouch fully now, never mind get up from one without arm support. He came rock climbing with me once (he chose to) a year ago and during the session I realised he couldn't crouch and extend his arms at the same time.


The only exercise I've ever seen him interested in is kayaking. We both did it from when we were kids until we went to uni. He took his equipment to uni, which had a club that did kayaking. He never touched it again (it's been a decade). He has no physical hobbies that I am aware of. His hobbies are all digital - watching stuff, programming, and TTRPGs (sometimes in person). 


He is 30. He is my little brother. I am so concerned about him. His stock response when  I ask how he is or how he's doing (emotionally,  psychologically, or physically) is ""Eh"" and shrugging, or saying that he doesn't know.

What are some ways for me to try communicating with him and getting him to engage in practical self-care?

So a little background, There's a department within my company I've been eyeing for about 2 years now. It's not really a secret as even my current manager knows where my goals are... I've even gone as far as having lunches and informal conversations with super higher ups in that area, they are aware of my feelings as well.

That being a said, a position in that department opened up today and there is an internal posting. When I read the listing i saw the hiring manager in the department is someone I've literally not spoken to in my entire tenure at this company. Can you guys give some strategies on how I can reach out to speak about the job. Is asking her for a coffee to discuss the position a good idea, or does that put everyone in an uncomfortable position and will end up looking terribly on me? How would I even do that?

It's actually a grade down from where I currently am. I don't really care, hopefully pay can be close, but that's a problem for another day. I really want to be a part of this department, and if I have to start low I will.

- Ultra: Red- 9.3/10
Cranberry-raspberry almost to a T. Definitely a slight Taurine flavor. Light red colour. UV reactive!!! Not sweet, more tart.
- Lo-Carb- 9.0/10
Sweet, Salty, Tart, Taurine, Monster. Tastes wet almost? Crispy. Normal energy drink, watery tea colour. Glows under blacklight!
- Juice: Pipeline Punch- 8.9/10
Very Tropical but without Pineapple. Does not taste pink. Cloudy Orange colour was a pleasant surprise. No Taurine taste. 
- Java: Mean Bean- 8.3/10
Coffee with a light sweet cream flavor. Slight taurine, but blends well. Light orange brown color.
- Juice: Mango Loco- 8/10
Mango juice. Sooo much juice flavor. Taurine adds a bite. Texture is a bit thick. Like Jumex Mango juice but more tart. Opaque orange/yellow colour. Glows under blacklight. 
- Java: Loca Mocha- 7.9
Perfect blend of coffee, cream, and chocolate. Tastes like coffee with normal cream and a bit of chocolate syrup. No taurine flavor. Velvety texture. Light chocolate colour. 
- Ultra: Fiesta Mango- 7.7/10
Mango popping boba bubbles. Maybe passion fruit? Very little Taurine flavor.
- Java: Café Latte- 7.4/10
Not flavoured, just cream and sugar. Very nice! Taurine gives it a bit of a bite, but it’s nice. Light caramel colour. Not too coffee tasting, more just sweet cream. Kinda like a Starbucks bottled coffee.  
- Juice: Papillon- 6.9/10
Tropical Nectarine taste. Very light and pleasant. Typical cloudy orange colour. No Taurine flavor. Very juice forward. Perfect amount of sweetness. Blacklight reactive!
- Ultra: Peachy Keen- 6.9/10
Peach popping boba bubbles. Light taurine flavor. Little tart. Yellow orange colour. 
- Nitro: Cosmic Peach- 6.9/10
Spicyyyyy fizz. Flavor is nice, light artificial peach cream. Contains milk, makes the texture softer. Really foams up. Clear Orange colour. Glows under blacklight. 
- Juice: Aussie Lemonade- 6.8/10
Tastes like Lemonade Sunny-D. Poison aftertaste? Blacklight Reactive!
- Juice: Pacific Punch- 6.7/10
Just a typical fruit punch flavor with a little more punch. Like red Gatorade. Same colour. Glows under blacklight! Taurine flavor actually enhances it, makes it less flat.
- Nitro- Superdry- 6.6/10
Citrusy. A little sour. It has a Sunny-D adjacent flavor. Contains Milk. Velvety soft texture. Smells like orange peels. Fair bit of foam. Lime green colour. Glows under blacklight! 
- Hydro: Purple Passion- 6.6/10
Just kinda tastes purple. Like a grape scented pen. Colour is a little off putting. Dangerous, I could drink so many of these and never know there was caffeine. No taurine taste.
- Ultra: Rosa- 6.6/10
Colour is very nice light pink. Notably sweet. Very one tone flavor profile. Just kinda tastes pink, maybe a bit strawberry. Can is beautiful. Taurine taste is definitely there.
- Java: Irish Créme- 6.5
Tastes like Bailey’s. Like alcohol without alcohol. Good if you like that kind of thing. Bad if you don’t. Smooth. Light milk chocolate colour. 
- Ultra: Ruby Red- 6.5/10
Colour is the BEST. Very polite light Pink. Tastes exactly like Sunny-D.
- Monster Energy- 6.5/10
It tastes like a Monster. Sweet, a little dry, a little hint of bubblegum you’ve been chewing for a while so it’s just a memory of the flavor. Taurine is there for a sour flavor. Normal energy drink colour. Glows under blacklight. 
- Ultra: Zero- 6.4/10
Citrus and taurine flavor. Like a zero sugar lemon Popsicle with a bit of bite. Not too sweet. Cloudy clear colour. Tastes like a Monster. 
- Reserve: Peaches N’ Cream- 6.4
Very sweet artificial peach flavor. Like peach rings. No taurine flavor. Missing that Monster bite. Clear bright orange colour. Glows under blacklight. 
- Ultra: Vice Guava- 6.2/10
Definitely Guava. Taurine does not mesh well with it. Slightly rancid. Can is my favorite. Magenta pink. Glows slightly under blacklight. 
- Juice: Khaotic- 5.8/10
Cloudy orange colour. Glows under blacklight! Pretty noticeable taurine flavor. Orange flavor, but not mind numbingly intense. Maybe a hint of pineapple? Candy sweetness, but not too strong! Definitely a juice in there, not sure what kind, but it is in there. Tastes like a Monster.
- Ultra: Violet- 5.1/10
Grape Pixie Stick. Colour is a bit too dark.
- Java: Salted Caramel- 5.1/10
Salted coffee flavor. Pleasant Caramel syrup flavor. Taurine taste does not mesh well with the caramel. Smells better than it tastes. 
- Rehab: Strawberry Lemonade- 5/10
Very sweet with a hint of taurine tartness. An unpleasant strawberry lemonade flavor. Tastes cheap. Like too much of a liquid water flavoring. Artificial watermelon colour. 
- Ultra: Paradise- 5/10
Green Apple flavor, bit of kiwi. Very sweet, but not sickly. A little sour, maybe a slight lime note.  A lime green colour. No taurine taste.
- Rehab: Peach Tea- 4.6/10
Very sweet black tea mixed with peach juice. Snapple esque, but tastes like there’s real juice in it. Normal black tea colour. No taurine flavor. 
- Reserve: Kiwi Strawberry- 4.4/10
MY FAVORITE COLOUR, glows very slightly under blacklight. Just Kiwi Strawberry. Nothing special. No Taurine flavor. Doesn’t even taste like a Monster.
- Juice: Rio Punch- 3.4/10
VERY sweet. No taurine flavor. Tastes like I ate a handful of miscellaneous gobstoppers. Cloudy orange colour. Glows under Blacklight!
- Ultra: Watermelon- 3.3/10
Sweet watermelon. Like a watermelon candy, but less intense. A little sour. Cherry candy colour. Glows under blacklight. 
- Hydro: Blue Ice- 3.3
Just kind of overall unpleasant. Tastes like a bad Liquid IV. Very Taurine forward. Blue Raspberry if blue raspberry was poison. 
- Ultra: Sunrise- 3.2/10
Really sweet. One tone flavor. Melted orange popsicle. Cloudy yellow orange color, pleasant. Unlike the taste. No Taurine. Just artificial orange

I’m meeting a POT SD for the first time tomorrow. I’m planning to wear an outfit that I usually wear, this includes 10cm high block heel ankle boots. (This is just a coffee chat so I’m sure my outfit is appropriate). But I’m fairly tall (5’9) and he’s 5’11 according to his profile. 

Can I still wear these boots or should I just keep to flats just be safe? I’ve heard that some men are iffy about being shorter yk

This hero had the black and grey flag decal with one red stripe. I assumed fireman, but nope. Crane operator, because of course. Not wanting this brave soul’s valor to go unrecognized I followed him for the rest of the day and bought every meal and coffee he stopped for. Thank you for your service.

Have some capital to invest but not looking to invest anymore in the UK due to low economic growth and high taxes. 

Need a decent cash flow business and thinking of investing in Dubai retail (toy shops, kids clothing, coffee shops etc). Anyone done anything similar and invested in bricks and mortar outside the UK? Just feel the UK is the wrong place to invest right now and I need to look beyond these shores.",0,1736280656.0,HENRYUK,9,0.27,False

I’m having such a hard time getting out of the house without feeling mom guilt. Baby is just about 6 months old and I have been on maternity leave since he was born. Since then I really haven’t done anything for myself(I.e go out with friends, a coffee stop etc.) without my baby in tow. But the handful of times I have I just can’t enjoy the time because I feel so so guilty about leaving the little one. My husband is a spectacular dad, a little aloof at times maybe but I’m definitely not concerned with leaving the baby with him. So I’m not sure where this all consuming feeling is coming from. 

I’m getting even more intense guilt and lots of anxiety about returning to work in a few weeks. Any advice/strategies/helpful hints on how to deal with mom guilt?? ",1,1736280655.0,Mommit,1,1.0,False

I am working with a nonprofit organization in Puerto Rico called Caribbean Regenerative Community Development (CRCD Puerto Rico) to support Puerto Rican coffee and cacao farmers in implementing climate-smart agricultural practices and expanding markets for sustainably produced Puerto Rican coffee and cacao.

To better understand the preferences of coffee and cacao consumers, we have created a brief survey that we believe your customers will find interesting. We would greatly appreciate it if you could help us promote this survey among your customers. The survey is designed to be quick and anonymous, and all responses will be securely stored. As a thank you, participants will have the chance to enter a drawing to win a basket of Puerto Rican coffee and cacao products.

Here is the survey link: [https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/h1DnOWJa](https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/h1DnOWJa)

This would be a wonderful opportunity to gather valuable insights while demonstrating your commitment to understanding and meeting your customers needs. Please let me know if you would be interested in collaborating or if there’s any other way we can assist you. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response!
