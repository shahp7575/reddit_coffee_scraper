And being honest its an interesting one. It’s one of the few short-term diets where a single food gives you protein, fiber, and slow carbs, so hunger drops fast even though the menu is painfully repetitive

Just boiled buckwheat, a bit of kefir on some days, black coffee, and the same boring bowl every morning. Lunch was buckwheat again with a boiled egg. Dinner was buckwheat with whatever low calorie veg I had. That’s it.

I dropped 3 kg in those two weeks. The weight came off fast at first, then slowed. Hunger was mostly manageable. Taste fatigue hit hard by day four. I kept going anyway. Energy dipped a bit but stayed workable.

If anyone wants the actual breakdown of why this diet works the way it does and what the risks are, here’s the post I read before trying it:

“Ron, we need to talk.” 

 

Ellie is seated at her kitchen table, phone to ear, feet tapping out floor rhythms. Freely spilling tears smear her eye shadow Dalíesque.  

 

“Whatta you mean?” Ron aggressively slurs. 

 

She’d hated him all along. With his whiskey breath and perpetually bloodshot oculi, only her loneliness permitted his actions—the things she’d actually allowed him to do to her. Only solitude keeps her from terminating his iniquitous seed. 

 

“Remember that night at the plant…when I visited you at work? Remember the heat of the reactor as you violated me? You said you were infertile, Ron. You’re not.” 

 

“The fuck? How would you know that?” the man warily enquires. There’s cruelty in his cadence, threats unspoken. Still, she presses on.

 

“How, you ask? I’m pregnant, that’s how.” 

 

“Well…shit, girl. You’re such a slutbag, it could be *anybody's* baby. Remember that time you let me—”

 

“There were no other men, Ron. The child is yours.”

 

Both fall quiet. Ellie hears a familiar clink: a shot glass striking countertop. Not Ron’s first, she reckons.

 

“You at home?” 

 

“Where the hell else would I be?”

 

“I’ll be right over.”

 

Hearing the dial tone, Ellie shivers. Pastel blue walls, speckled with splotches of indeterminate origin, seem to constrict all around her. Five minutes and thirty-two seconds pass before she pulls the receiver from her ear. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Lingering in the parking lot, Ron mutters to himself, “Pregnant, she says. As if I don’t have enough problems in my life. *Fuckin’ bitch.* I’ll show her what’s what.”

 

Slowly, he shuffles forward, a beast in a faded red trucker cap. The pits of his green button-up are soaked, as is the crotch of his jeans. He knows that Ellie is lying. She has to be.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ron blinks…and finds himself on Ellie’s front porch. *Did I drive here or walk?* he wonders. Dim animal instinct brings his hand to a rusty doorknocker, to savagely thump it—one, two, three.  

 

A shuffling…and the door swings open. Perspiration-sheened, Ellie now stands afore him, her abdomen drastically protruding. *When did I last see this bitch?*

 

“You’re here,” she tonelessly remarks, visibly disgusted as she eyes him. Smelling whiskey wafting out his own pores, Ron nearly retches, then thinks, *Like I’d give her that satisfaction.*  

 

He pushes his way inside, until they’re face-to-face at the foot of the staircase. Ron smiles now, wolfishly. “Of course I’m here. Did you think I’d abandon you with our child on the way? Let’s go upstairs, and I’ll massage those swollen feet of yours. You look exhausted.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ellie is shocked. This man is not to be trusted. He’s dumb and vindictive, and bites during intercourse. But she’s so damn tired, and her mother won’t be arriving for days. “My feet…really? You always said they were fugly, more hoof than human.”

 

“I’m a changed man, sweetheart. C’mon, let me show you.”

 

Somehow, she finds herself linking hands with the six-and-a-half-foot brute. He pulls her up the stairs, breathing heavily. 

 

At the top of the staircase, Ron turns to her. In her ear, he whispers, “You’re so beautiful right now, Ellie. Like an angel…or a…Super Bowl ring. How ’bout a kiss for Daddy?”

 

His lips terminate her protests, assaulting her with whiskey effluvium. When Ellie begins to gag, Ron pulls away, now unsmiling. Empty-eyed, he outthrusts his arms. 

 

Suddenly, without warning, Ellie is flying through the air, staring up at her own two swollen feet. She hears a sharp *CRACK*, the sound her neck makes while snapping.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ron saunters into midnight. *Problem solved*, he reasons. *Now back to the bar. If anyone asks, I never left it.*

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Hours later, Ellie’s corpse starts to twitch. From betwixt her thighs, a head slowly emerges, trailed by a strangely muscular upper physique, terminating in a pair of crushed legs, all dripping blood and other biofluids. 

 

The fetus pulls himself upright. His lower limbs being useless, cobra-like, he then slithers. It’s impossible, yet some uncanny force draws the boy onward. 

 

One-handedly, the escapee tears away his umbilical cord. Passing into night’s unsympathetic chill, he spares no backward glance for the corpse he’d emerged from. A gust of wind slams the door closed behind him. 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**Chapter 2: In Which We Meet the Pierces**

 

As his ancient blue Oldsmobile rattle-lurches itself homeward, Elmer Pierce struggles to keep both eyes open. It is nearly six A.M., with the sun yet to rise. 

 

Out of coffee, his wife had impelled him toward the nearest convenience store. In fifty-plus years of marriage, never once had Joanna volunteered for predawn errands, but Elmer doesn’t mind. *Mostly.* They love each other, after all.

 

Battling the Sandman, he accelerates. Only when a sudden figure crosses his headlights—some pink, bloody thing wobbling its way across the street—does the oldster fully awaken. 

 

Elmer makes with the brake screech, but it is already too late. He hears a metallic crunching: his vehicle making contact. Though his head rocks forward, prompting a pain flare, the geriatric wastes no time in hopping from the car.  

 

Squinting through green-framed glasses, his stomach heaving forebodingly, Elmer checks his front bumper and finds it crumpled. Beneath it lies the stricken: a male infant, or at least a rough approximation of one, underdeveloped, aside from a strangely muscular upper body. His legs are crushed, but otherwise the child seems unharmed—no scratches, no contusions. 

 

*How did his legs get so messed up?* Elmer wonders. *If anything, his face should be caved in. That’s where the bumper struck.* 

 

The child regards him with a grin, his sky-blue eyes sparkling. Though he’d survived an impact that would’ve annihilated any other child, he isn’t crying, isn’t reacting at all. 

 

To the enigma, Elmer says, “Well, you appear unharmed, which is a miracle in itself. But what shall I do with you? If only I knew where you came from, I could take you back there. For the time being, I suppose that you’ll come home with me. We’ll call the authorities and have you collected. Come along, little one.”

 

Wondering how his wife will react, Elmer hefts the boy up and transfers him to the Oldsmobile’s passenger seat.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Joanna pauses her dishwashing—towel in one hand, wet plate in the other—to study the fetus, intently. A stray lock of hair has escaped her otherwise immaculate bun. Her eyes blear behind frameless glasses.   

 

“You say you hit him with your car—*your car!*—and he wasn’t killed? Well then, I just have to ask: What the hell is this thing? What are we supposed to do with him? He looks like an abortion that lived, for cryin’ out loud.”

 

“Don’t worry, dear. I’m calling the cops, and they’ll have him out of here in no time. Keep an eye on the boy while I grab the phone, *if ya don’t mind*.”

 

Elmer departs for phone retrieval. A shriek brings him rushing back. Hearing Joanna’s plate shatter, he reenters the kitchen to see her face gone shock-ghostly. Speechlessly, she points to the child—what’s left of him.

 

Much of the fetus has turned invisible, leaving only a hovering eye, a hand, and fragments of his torso perceptible. Beholding him in amazement, Elmer wonders, *Might this child be an underdeveloped superhero?* 

 

Eventually, Joanna finds her voice: “Look at him! He’s some kinda demon, Elmer! Get him out of here, fast, before he murders us both!”

 

Absentmindedly rubbing the peak of his bald, liver-spotted cranium, Elmer replies, “Change of plans, Joanna. I can’t dial the police now. They’ll dissect the poor bastard. I guess we’ll just have to adopt him.”

 

“What? No!”

 



 

**Chapter 3: An Aborted Superhero**

 

*From the journal of Elmer Pierce:*

 

The calendar says it’s been months. All that time, and he hasn’t changed one iota. The boy remains just as I found him: a human fetus, roughly thirty weeks old. By all accounts, he should be deceased. Yet somehow he persists, grinning that vacant grin of his, wearing a neon blue shirt—previously Joanna’s—that drapes down to his poor mangled feet. 

 

He stands sixteen inches tall and weighs three-and-a-half pounds. A light lanugo fringe tops his head, downy hair that doesn’t grow. 

 

The boy never sleeps. It’s as if his body died in the womb, and only his powerful will keeps it from rotting. When he eats, which is seldom, the child grabs whatever’s at hand and toothlessly gums it to pulp. It’s quite unnerving to observe. 

 

If he produces waste, I’ve yet to see it. Our limited budget doesn’t cover the cost of diapers, anyway. 

 

Once upon a misbegotten time, I was a research scientist. Remember? Back then, sequestered in the lab day after day, staring into a microscope, I never imagined that I’d end up studying the partially-formed powers of an aborted superhero. It’s fortunate that I keep some old equipment down in this basement—my calorimeter, spectrophotometer, and operant conditioning chamber. 

 

Thus far, simple tests have revealed that the fetus is highly intelligent for his age. Though he doesn’t speak, he understands me well enough to follow simple directions. Just yesterday, he retrieved my bathrobe when I asked for it, like a well-trained dog.

 

I know that he possesses extreme strength and durability, and can turn the majority of his body invisible. If the boy had been carried to term, he most likely would have been able to fly. Presently, however, all he can do is keep his upper body hovering upright, while his crushed legs drag uselessly behind him.

 

Last week, quite by accident, I discovered another capability of my young ward. You see, we’d been in the basement for some time, and my orange juice had warmed considerably. I complained about that with much petulance, I must admit, which prompted the fetus to focus his gaze upon my glass—just for a moment, really. With my next sip, I found the juice to be ice-cold. 

 

Who knows: if not for his premature birth, there could at this very moment be an infant freezing folks into ice sculptures, using only a loaded glance.

 



 

**Chapter 4: How Does Your Garden Grow?**

 

At the kitchen table, they sit: Elmer—fishing cap on, tackle box set before him—and Joanna. Empty coffee cups convene atop antique walnut, aside plates bestrewn with ketchup-streaked scrambled egg remnants. Joanna grins. The fetus is nowhere in sight. 

 

“Your fishing trip’s finally here,” she says. “Once a year…regular as clockwork. Are you excited, Elmie?”

 

“You better believe it.”

 

“That’s nice. Make sure to remember your heart pills.” 

 

“Naturally, my dear.” Patting his pocket, Elmer rattles the medication in question. “Now, I should be back before dark. Please look after the boy while I’m gone.”

 

“Well…okay, but he still makes me nervous.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*Night rolls over the household…*

 

Crossing the threshold, Elmer shapes his sunburnt countenance into a lopsided smile. He clutches a cooler—a tackle box set atop it—with a fishing pole under one elbow. Multicolored lures decorate his vest. 

 

“Joanna, I’m home! Come see what I caught us!”

 

There’s no answer. *She must be sleeping*, he reasons. Entering the kitchen, he sets the cooler upon faded linoleum.

 

Leaning against the refrigerator, bathing in its soothing hum, the fetus regards him with vacant acknowledgement. *This kid needs a name, pronto*, Elmer decides. 

 

“Where’s Joanna, boy?”

 

The fetus raises an arm, indicating the sliding glass door, and what lies beyond it. 

 

“In the backyard, you say? She must’ve been gardening and lost track of time again. *That woman*.” 

 

Elmer steps outside, onto the patio. “Joanna? It’s getting late…and chilly. Why don’t you come inside? The flowers will still be there in the morning. Jo…Joanna!”

 

She sprawls amidst the tulips, both eyes pointed skyward. Her tools are scattered—a toppled watering can flooding rosebush roots, shears nestling among lilacs. She doesn’t breathe, doesn’t move at all.

 

“God, no! Not my wife! Not now! I can’t live without her. Get up, Joanna. Puh…*please*.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Dirt-kneeling, Elmer cradles his wife to his chest, his tears splashing the soil. Suddenly, he gasps. For one transitory moment, he seems to hallucinate a verdant physiognomy—hideously smirking, formed in the shadow space between rosebush leaves. It disappears just as fast as he notices it. 

 

Eighty-four minutes later, he reenters his residence, swollen-eyed, biting his lip to stifle screams. His temples throb; his right hand clenches and unclenches. Unnoticed, soil spills from his pant legs.   

 

The fetus remains in the kitchen. Now slouching afore the sink, he grips the handle of one drawer, making no effort to open it. Sighting the boy’s empty grin, Elmer snaps. 

 

“You…this is entirely your fault,” is his toneless declaration. “You were supposed to save us all, and what did you do? You…you extinguished my sole reason for being. I don’t know how it happened, but you killed her.” 

 

Ever so slightly, the fetus tilts his head, mutely expressing confusion. Now Elmer is shouting, his voice cracking. “Get out of here…and don’t come back! I never want to see your monstrous face again!”

 

He scoops the child off the floor. 

 

Trustingly, the boy hugs Elmer’s neck, just as he’d done countless times prior. Head rested against a bony shoulder, he allows the geriatric to carry him out into the night. 

 

Curb-tossing the fetus, Elmer then reenters his house, realizing that he has a call to make. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Having waited many minutes—glancing from the house to the street, back to the house—the fetus slithers down the sidewalk, his destination unknown. Under soft streetlight illumination, the boy’s tear trails gleam sorrowfully. 

 



 

**Chapter 5: Nathaniel and the Cosmic Womb**

 

*From the journal of Nathaniel Rusk:*

 

*July 5:* I place my pen to paper this time, just like the last, unsure where to start. What I hope to accomplish…indeed, that’s a mystery, even to myself. It exists in a cloud, a rarefied region far too distant to grasp.

 

Here I sit with blood in my eyes, wishing to dig past my corporeal form and pour my soul upon these pages, but my mind is forever traveling faster than my weary hand can scrawl. Still, I do what I can to snatch ideas from the ether, to consign them to paper before they’re lost, knowing that no eyes but mine own shall ever read this sad memoir, anyway.

 

Life can be grand sometimes, those sparkling instants that make me feel as if I can finally peel off this mask I wear to hide my frailties, and show the world that I’m still alive, still kicking. Those moments never last, though.

 

The things we’ve done and endured, both good and bad, never leave us. They may retreat into the shadow realms of our subconscious, but all it takes is a certain scent or song to bring them rushing back. The past never fades completely. It bides its time patiently, until it can reemerge for maximum discomfort.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

I dream a lot. Sometimes it seems as if dreams are the only things keeping me Earth-tethered, lead anvils anchoring my hot air balloon soul.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The deliveryman came today. He visits often, twice or thrice a week. 

 

Just after lunch, I detected a subtle shift in my home’s ambiance, heralding something amiss. I arrived at the peephole in time to see boot heels fleeing the vicinity. As always, my dread was interwoven with morbid anticipation. 

 

The package bore no return address, as per usual. No delivery address either. Not even a stamp for legitimacy, just a nondescript brown box. Therein, I discovered a photograph.

 

The snapshot featured an elderly woman, her faded hair tied in a loose ponytail. Her face was old leather, her smile nearly a wince. 

 

On the back of the photo was scrawled, *Henrietta Adams. Delaney Park. 1:35 P.M. Ask her about the pigeons.* I pocketed the picture and discarded the box.

 

I sat around the house until the appointed time, and then took the bus to Delaney Park. As I claimed my seat, my fellow passengers spared me no glances, an occurrence I’ve grown quite accustomed to. With an exhaust blast, the dingy vehicle hurled itself forward. Three stops later, I’d arrived, albeit three minutes late.

 

Frantically, I whipped my head left to right, right to left, seeking the woman from the photograph. 

 

Initially, I believed the park empty, its grassy stretch unmarred by blanket, basket or Frisbee. But there she was, fifty feet leftward, readying herself for a departure. Before a splintery bench she stood, breadcrumbs scattered at her feet, wearing a tattered pink shawl over a yellow sundress. Not a single bird pecked at those breadcrumbs.

 

“Miss Adams,” I shouted, “we need to talk!” Closing the intervening distance, I noticed a profound suspicion nestled within the wrinkle-folds of her face. 

 

“How…do you know my name?” she asked.

 

“Sit down for a minute, and I’ll tell ya,” I pleaded, motioning to the bench. Reluctantly, the woman complied. 

 

“Henrietta, I was sent here to speak with you.”

 

“Who sent you? The government?” She was growing agitated. I knew that I was treading on eggshells.

 

“I don’t rightly know, ma’am. A package showed up on my doorstep. Your photograph was inside of it. On the back of that picture, your name was written, as was the name of this park and the time you’d be here.”

 

“Why me?”

 

“That’s what I’m hoping to find out. I’m supposed to ask you about the pigeons.”

 

She relaxed. “Ah yes, the pigeons,” she sighed. “I used to feed them healthy breadcrumbs, but now I give them poison. I watch them sicken and perish, and it’s so…delightfully cathartic.”

 

I noticed a paper bag in her hand, and snatched it away. Within it, breadcrumbs reeked of ammonia. 

 

“Where are all the pigeons, Henrietta?” Not one was in sight. Usually, Delaney Park is full of ’em, filthy creatures that will shit on you if ya don’t keep an eye out—comfortable in their elevation, knowing you can’t retaliate. 

 

“Look behind that bush there.” With one gnarled forefinger, she indicated an area roughly twenty feet distant, a profusion of oaks and shrubbery. Trudging to that vicinity, I realized that she’d been truthful. 

 

Henrietta must’ve been a very busy woman, for there were dozens of pigeon corpses there, piled behind a bush in varied stages of putrefaction. Glassy eyes stared with no intelligence behind them; inert wings had flapped their last flaps. Coldly, I wondered how her bounty had gone undiscovered.

 

Returning to her, I saw that Henrietta now had drool spilling down her chin. “Did you see ’em?” she asked, her eyes glistening with excitement.

 

“Yeah, I saw them. So what?”

 

“So…nothing. There is no greater significance, none whatsoever. They exist to be slaughtered, as do all of God’s creatures.”

 

“Do you wish to die, Henrietta?”

 

Her lined, leathery brow contracted as she pondered that query. After a lengthy pause that seemed to span hours, she replied, “Sometimes.”

 

That was all I needed to hear. Taking the old gal by the hand, I escorted her over to her dead bird collection. In the shadow of an imposing oak tree, she seemed older than time. 

 

I looked around the park, ensuring that we were still alone. “Look at your pigeons one last time, Henrietta. What do you see?”

 

“They are beautiful, better in death than in life.”

 

“Goodbye, Henrietta.” Gripping her face, I violently twisted it rightward. Her neck broke with a loud crack, but she voiced not an utterance. 

 

Carefully lowering her until her head met the pigeon mound, I noticed that Henrietta’s yellow sundress had wrinkled up on itself. After carefully smoothing it out, I plucked a pigeon from the corpse heap. This, I settled upon Henrietta’s chest, and folded her arms over it. The effect was a skosh surreal, evocative of a little girl snoozing with her favorite stuffed animal.

 

With a sigh, I walked back to the bus stop.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 7:* Another morning, another package. Again, no postage stamp. I brought the thing to my battered desk—where I’m currently seated, writing this. Tearing past the cardboard, I discovered a wooden frame bordering a picture of yours truly, age five. Sharing that photo space, my parents proudly beamed behind my young self, as I exhaled upon birthday cake candles. 

 

I considered the image for a moment, adrift in my own history, and then shattered the glass. On the back of the photo was a message:

 

*Nathaniel,*

 

*Your father and I are so proud of you. Congratulations on your big promotion. I found this in the attic, and thought you might want it. We’ll see you soon.*

 

*Love,*

*Mom*

 

I crumbled the photo, then consigned it to the trashcan. Its frame I smashed to splinters. I was trembling, nearly convulsing, unable to believe that anybody could be so cruel as to use my dead parents against me.

 

They died years ago in a house fire, a freak accident springing from an old toaster. I remember awakening upon our front lawn, retching, under a sickle moon. Stupefied, I saw my parents wheeled past me, zipped into black body bags, pushed by uniformed men with stone faces. 

 

Though I was only seven at the time, I never escaped the doom shroud that enclosed me that night. It drifted in through a thousand pores, entered my blood stream, and coated my heart. Sadly, that was my life’s defining moment. 

 

Beyond a doubt, I now know that the deliveryman is evil. Why else would he stir up such wretchedness? After all the strange and exalting quests that his packages have led me to—years upon years of ’em—the man’s true colors are finally revealed. But if he seeks to profit from my misery, he’s destined for disappointment. Something will have to be done. Soon. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 9:* Today was an unhinged one. I spent all of last night in my front yard, crouching behind its unruliest perimeter hedge. I didn’t move, didn’t sleep, only peered between leaves to monitor my doorstep, hoping that the deliveryman would come. 

 

I wasn’t disappointed.

 

Around 5:30 A.M., a time when most sane folks are still in bed, a white Dodge van pulled up to the curb and ejected a man. Resembling a member of a Christian rock band, he was dressed all in white. His short black hair was parted on the left side. 

 

The deliveryman’s nose was crooked, his beady eyes close-set. Standing well over six feet tall, he clutched the customary brown package. Here was a fellow I’d never seen clearly, having caught only paltry glimpses as he hurried back to his van. At last, I was to confront the bastard.

 

As his loping gait carried him porchward, my careful steps brought me up behind him. Lacing my fingers together, I raised my arms overhead. 

 

The very moment that he set down the package, I bashed the back of the deliveryman’s neck. Surging forward, his forehead collided with the door, knocking him unconscious. 

 

I could have stopped there, but my adrenaline proved overwhelming. I stomped the man’s head, kicked his ribs, and stomped his head again. When I finally ceased, he was no longer breathing. His noggin was a bloody, misshapen mess. 

 

With no better recourse, I dragged the deliveryman indoors and laid him in my living room, at the foot of the couch. I then returned to the porch for the package. Noticing the mess that we’d made, I unrolled the hose from my garage and sprayed all the gore away. It was so early, I’m fairly confident that no neighbor observed me. 

 

As my subsequent search of the fellow revealed no identification, I turned to his last package. Therein was a note, scrawled on a sheet of computer paper. It read, *Take the van. Heed the directions taped to its dashboard. When you reach the cave, follow the lizard with a red spot on its tail. Don’t worry about the body; it will be taken care of.*

 

The last sentence startled me. The deliveryman had apparently arrived at my residence well aware that I’d kill him. Why he would do such a thing, I couldn’t fathom. 

 

I considered ignoring the note, but ultimately elected to heed it. It alleged that the corpse would be taken care of—my paramount concern at the time. At any rate, I couldn’t leave the deliveryman’s van parked at my curb without rousing neighborly curiosity. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

My thoughts racing, I entered the unlocked vehicle, clambering up into its driver’s seat. The spotless interior was permeated with new car smell. The glove box was empty; the key was in the ignition. Taped to the dashboard were directions, which I carefully studied. 

 

Wasting not a moment, I departed my neighborhood, preoccupied with the darkest of forebodings. My journey carried me from the suburbs to the countryside, from the countryside to the forest. I drove for hours, without music to amuse me. 

 

At one point, the unpaved road was overhung with cypress trees—enormous, gnarled sentries flanking both its sides—blocking all sunlight, making my smallest hairs rise. The lane tilted up in the darkness; I realized that my elevation was rising exponentially. 

 

Regaining daylight, I discovered that I’d reached the cave.

 

White mountainside rock, its entrance was tiny and would have to be crawled through. Just a few yards beyond it, a cliff plunged down into an abyss of foliage and bark. The air was so clean and pure that my head swam. 

 

A feeling of great contentment washed over me then, perhaps emanating from the cave itself. I felt as if I could sleep undisturbed for thousands of years, and awaken to a world free of technology and sin. Something tickled my leg; glancing down, I saw the lizard.

 

Its eyes met mine; it seemed that we wordlessly communicated. Its tongue flicked to accent an unspoken point. The lizard wore a camouflage pattern: scales of white, black, brown, and grey intermingled. Clashing with that design was the red blotch on its tail, which resembled freshly spilled blood. 

 

When the lizard bolted into the pitch-black, I reluctantly followed. The cave mouth, tightly rimmed with jagged rocks, tore at both my clothing and the flesh underlying it. Much claret flowed out of me, along with curses and angry mutterings. 

 

Though I should have lost the lizard in the darkness, its tail blotch somehow emanated a faint luminescence. Serpent-like, I wriggled through the narrow passage in pursuit, vexed by a sulfurous stench.

 

Whether my slow ingress went on for minutes or hours, I have no idea. Time lost all meaning as I crawled through the mountain’s vein. Eventually, my frustration became unbearable and I shrieked at the reptile, promising that I’d bite its head off if ever I caught up to it. 

 

Then I noticed the water, liquid which glowed the same hue as the lizard’s tail blotch. The blotch entered that agua, and the two became one. 

 

What strange chemical made the water glow crimson? Beats me. Suddenly, it flowed up around me and I was submerged.

 

Though I backed up the way I’d arrived, the water traveled with me. When I attempted to scream, it poured into my mouth—warm, thick and sugary. With it arrived a numbing sensation, ceasing the pitiful flailing of my arms and legs, leaving me immobilized, helpless. Closing my eyes, I accepted the certainty of my own demise.     

 

\*          \*          \*

 

A cocoon of dreams wove around me. Stars and comets filled my vision. Amidst them, an orb of red liquid grew skin of soil and water, becoming planet Earth. The skin erupted into blemishes and orifices—mountaintops and canyons. 

 

Falling earthward, I encountered bizarre creatures gliding across the landscape. More smoke than flesh, these organisms interlocked to form new shapes, and then vanished entirely. One solidified, growing features identical to mine own. It smiled through my lips and winked with my eyelids. Then it was smog again, windswept into nihility. 

 

Furiously, bricks erupted from the soil—houses blooming upward. Within their walls, phantoms capered, their braying mirth like gargled razor blades. My mentality shrieked, *No!* even as my feet dragged me within one such dwelling. Its walls, floor, and ceiling were brick-paved. On the floor, a crude bed of straw and deerskin accommodated a bearded man and an unshaven female, clutching each other as they slept. Like a storm cloud, a smoke creature hovered over them, sending out vaporous tendrils to caress their exposed flesh. 

 

Her lips parting to moan, the woman stirred in her sleep. Seizing the opportunity, the apparition surged into her body, a smokestack in reverse. Rigidly, the woman sat up and retrieved a sizable rock from beneath the blanket. Her eyes were blank, her bare breasts prodigious. 

 

The rock came crashing down, again and again, obliterating her lover’s features. Blood sprayed profusely, as my legs finally permitted me to flee.

 

Outside, the sky was flaming, the sun no longer spherical. Elongated, it stretched from one end of the horizon to the other. Clouds shriveled and blackened like campfire marshmallows. Trees wilted, their leaves blazing. In succession, the brick buildings were sucked back underground, swallowed by the soil. 

 

The mountains caught on fire, too, as did the ground itself. Curiously, the inferno left me untouched. I saw blue oceans reduced to steam, as terra firma flaked apart underfoot. 

 

Soon, red liquid was all that remained. Gratefully, I tumbled into its embrace. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

I awakened inside the white van. Outside, it was dark. My clothes were gone, replaced with a white button-up shirt, white pants, and white boots—the deliveryman’s outfit. My skin was dry. 

 

The keys remained in the ignition. Ergo, I started the Dodge up and drove homeward, headlights blazing in the night.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The return drive was quicker. Mentally berating myself with unanswerable questions, I scarcely perceived the road. Had I really entered the cave, or was it all just a dream? The abrasions on my arms and legs suggested the former. But how had I escaped the place? Where did the clothes come from? Did someone assist me while I was unconscious?

 

Entering my residence, I realized that the deliveryman’s corpse had been removed. The note hadn’t lied. Not even a blood drop remained. 

 

Spotting this journal on the coffee table, I tucked it into my waistband. Then I visited the garage, which remained a mess: newspapers piled head-high, a splintery workbench cluttered with miscellaneous tools, bicycle parts strewn about old baseball equipment, everything permeated with the scent of oil. I watched a kitten-sized rat scurry diagonally, from one corner to another, to disappear into a raggedy wall crater. 

 

After several minutes of fruitless searching, I found what I was looking for: a gas can brimming with processed petroleum—perfect for what I had in mind.

 

I splashed some gasoline around the garage, careful not to waste too much, and then visited my bedroom. Therein, I considered my bed—a king-sized, flannel-draped behemoth—feeling melancholic. My body was three steps ahead of my mind, however, soaking the sheets, carpet and walls.

 

In the bathroom, I filled the toilet with gasoline, and the plugged-up sink, too. In the kitchen, I soaked the refrigerator and stove. I spotted a spider on the countertop and took special pleasure in drowning it. Patting my journal to ensure that it remained in my waistband, I trudged to the front lawn, leaving a gasoline trail in my wake.

 

I’d forgotten to grab a lighter, so I hurried back inside for my Zippo. When I returned, the sky was spilling light rainfall. Hoping that the precipitation wouldn’t thwart my plan, I tossed flame toward petrol.

 

Crying grateful lacrimae, I watched the conflagration spread, a singularly exquisite sight. With an unexpected rapidity, the flames entered my abode. 

 

Soon, the place was illuminated from within, evoking a jack-o-lantern. The roof shingles surrendered, freeing flame tongues to lick the firmament. Hallucinating my parents’ ghosts in the inferno, I bade them rest in peace, as heat scorched my flesh, eight hundred degrees Celsius, at least. 

 

The grass wilted and whitened. Hedges erupted in flames, reminding me of that old Bible story: God speaking through a burning bush. Thus, I lingered there for a moment, both my ears open. Hearing nothing but crackling, I climbed into the van and accelerated down the road. 

 

As pajama-clad neighbors emerged from their houses, I glanced into the rearview mirror and saw my erstwhile home caving in, its walls buckling, collapsing into ash. Then I was gone, my destination unknown.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 11:* This morning, upon awakening, I found myself in the van’s backseat—body aching, psyche aglow with neon purpose. A vision had arrived while I slept: a lonely girl plucking discarded notes from a middle school trashcan, after her classmates and teacher have left the room for their lunch break. 

 

The unassuming young brunette, wearing large, crooked glasses and an ancient patchwork dress, sits mostly invisible to those around her. Silently, she watches her classmates exchanging messages behind the teacher’s back. 

 

These girls, and sometimes boys, seem so blissful, covertly communicating while everyone else sits in boredom. Sometimes they take their notes with them—tucked into a pocket, purse or notebook—but most of them end up discarded.

 

This is when Annabelle strikes. Snatching the papers with trembling fingertips, she stashes them in her plain blue folder, before heading out for a solitary meal at the schoolyard’s edge. 

 

In the safety of her bedroom, Annabelle inspects each day’s catches, leisurely devouring every opinion and factoid. She learns secrets few are privy to: who Linda Martel is “in love” with, why Brian Eckles’ dad rots in prison, and dozens more tidbits, glimpses into a world she’ll never comprehend fully. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Parked outside of a supermarket, I’m now putting together a package for young Annabelle. Within it, she’ll find a note, guaranteed to imbue purpose. 

 

Tomorrow morning, I’ll visit Elm Middle School, to deposit the package in her targeted trashcan before any faculty arrives. Seeing her name on the cardboard, Annabelle will forget all other messages. She’ll take the box home, tear it open, and read the note several times before grasping its meaning.

 

Eventually, she’ll figure out what to do.  ",1,1765721065.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,1.0,False

“Ron, we need to talk.” 

 

Ellie is seated at her kitchen table, phone to ear, feet tapping out floor rhythms. Freely spilling tears smear her eye shadow Dalíesque.  

 

“Whatta you mean?” Ron aggressively slurs. 

 

She’d hated him all along. With his whiskey breath and perpetually bloodshot oculi, only her loneliness permitted his actions—the things she’d actually allowed him to do to her. Only solitude keeps her from terminating his iniquitous seed. 

 

“Remember that night at the plant…when I visited you at work? Remember the heat of the reactor as you violated me? You said you were infertile, Ron. You’re not.” 

 

“The fuck? How would you know that?” the man warily enquires. There’s cruelty in his cadence, threats unspoken. Still, she presses on.

 

“How, you ask? I’m pregnant, that’s how.” 

 

“Well…shit, girl. You’re such a slutbag, it could be *anybody's* baby. Remember that time you let me—”

 

“There were no other men, Ron. The child is yours.”

 

Both fall quiet. Ellie hears a familiar clink: a shot glass striking countertop. Not Ron’s first, she reckons.

 

“You at home?” 

 

“Where the hell else would I be?”

 

“I’ll be right over.”

 

Hearing the dial tone, Ellie shivers. Pastel blue walls, speckled with splotches of indeterminate origin, seem to constrict all around her. Five minutes and thirty-two seconds pass before she pulls the receiver from her ear. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Lingering in the parking lot, Ron mutters to himself, “Pregnant, she says. As if I don’t have enough problems in my life. *Fuckin’ bitch.* I’ll show her what’s what.”

 

Slowly, he shuffles forward, a beast in a faded red trucker cap. The pits of his green button-up are soaked, as is the crotch of his jeans. He knows that Ellie is lying. She has to be.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ron blinks…and finds himself on Ellie’s front porch. *Did I drive here or walk?* he wonders. Dim animal instinct brings his hand to a rusty doorknocker, to savagely thump it—one, two, three.  

 

A shuffling…and the door swings open. Perspiration-sheened, Ellie now stands afore him, her abdomen drastically protruding. *When did I last see this bitch?*

 

“You’re here,” she tonelessly remarks, visibly disgusted as she eyes him. Smelling whiskey wafting out his own pores, Ron nearly retches, then thinks, *Like I’d give her that satisfaction.*  

 

He pushes his way inside, until they’re face-to-face at the foot of the staircase. Ron smiles now, wolfishly. “Of course I’m here. Did you think I’d abandon you with our child on the way? Let’s go upstairs, and I’ll massage those swollen feet of yours. You look exhausted.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ellie is shocked. This man is not to be trusted. He’s dumb and vindictive, and bites during intercourse. But she’s so damn tired, and her mother won’t be arriving for days. “My feet…really? You always said they were fugly, more hoof than human.”

 

“I’m a changed man, sweetheart. C’mon, let me show you.”

 

Somehow, she finds herself linking hands with the six-and-a-half-foot brute. He pulls her up the stairs, breathing heavily. 

 

At the top of the staircase, Ron turns to her. In her ear, he whispers, “You’re so beautiful right now, Ellie. Like an angel…or a…Super Bowl ring. How ’bout a kiss for Daddy?”

 

His lips terminate her protests, assaulting her with whiskey effluvium. When Ellie begins to gag, Ron pulls away, now unsmiling. Empty-eyed, he outthrusts his arms. 

 

Suddenly, without warning, Ellie is flying through the air, staring up at her own two swollen feet. She hears a sharp *CRACK*, the sound her neck makes while snapping.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Ron saunters into midnight. *Problem solved*, he reasons. *Now back to the bar. If anyone asks, I never left it.*

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Hours later, Ellie’s corpse starts to twitch. From betwixt her thighs, a head slowly emerges, trailed by a strangely muscular upper physique, terminating in a pair of crushed legs, all dripping blood and other biofluids. 

 

The fetus pulls himself upright. His lower limbs being useless, cobra-like, he then slithers. It’s impossible, yet some uncanny force draws the boy onward. 

 

One-handedly, the escapee tears away his umbilical cord. Passing into night’s unsympathetic chill, he spares no backward glance for the corpse he’d emerged from. A gust of wind slams the door closed behind him. 

 

 

 

 

 



 

**Chapter 2: In Which We Meet the Pierces**

 

As his ancient blue Oldsmobile rattle-lurches itself homeward, Elmer Pierce struggles to keep both eyes open. It is nearly six A.M., with the sun yet to rise. 

 

Out of coffee, his wife had impelled him toward the nearest convenience store. In fifty-plus years of marriage, never once had Joanna volunteered for predawn errands, but Elmer doesn’t mind. *Mostly.* They love each other, after all.

 

Battling the Sandman, he accelerates. Only when a sudden figure crosses his headlights—some pink, bloody thing wobbling its way across the street—does the oldster fully awaken. 

 

Elmer makes with the brake screech, but it is already too late. He hears a metallic crunching: his vehicle making contact. Though his head rocks forward, prompting a pain flare, the geriatric wastes no time in hopping from the car.  

 

Squinting through green-framed glasses, his stomach heaving forebodingly, Elmer checks his front bumper and finds it crumpled. Beneath it lies the stricken: a male infant, or at least a rough approximation of one, underdeveloped, aside from a strangely muscular upper body. His legs are crushed, but otherwise the child seems unharmed—no scratches, no contusions. 

 

*How did his legs get so messed up?* Elmer wonders. *If anything, his face should be caved in. That’s where the bumper struck.* 

 

The child regards him with a grin, his sky-blue eyes sparkling. Though he’d survived an impact that would’ve annihilated any other child, he isn’t crying, isn’t reacting at all. 

 

To the enigma, Elmer says, “Well, you appear unharmed, which is a miracle in itself. But what shall I do with you? If only I knew where you came from, I could take you back there. For the time being, I suppose that you’ll come home with me. We’ll call the authorities and have you collected. Come along, little one.”

 

Wondering how his wife will react, Elmer hefts the boy up and transfers him to the Oldsmobile’s passenger seat.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Joanna pauses her dishwashing—towel in one hand, wet plate in the other—to study the fetus, intently. A stray lock of hair has escaped her otherwise immaculate bun. Her eyes blear behind frameless glasses.   

 

“You say you hit him with your car—*your car!*—and he wasn’t killed? Well then, I just have to ask: What the hell is this thing? What are we supposed to do with him? He looks like an abortion that lived, for cryin’ out loud.”

 

“Don’t worry, dear. I’m calling the cops, and they’ll have him out of here in no time. Keep an eye on the boy while I grab the phone, *if ya don’t mind*.”

 

Elmer departs for phone retrieval. A shriek brings him rushing back. Hearing Joanna’s plate shatter, he reenters the kitchen to see her face gone shock-ghostly. Speechlessly, she points to the child—what’s left of him.

 

Much of the fetus has turned invisible, leaving only a hovering eye, a hand, and fragments of his torso perceptible. Beholding him in amazement, Elmer wonders, *Might this child be an underdeveloped superhero?* 

 

Eventually, Joanna finds her voice: “Look at him! He’s some kinda demon, Elmer! Get him out of here, fast, before he murders us both!”

 

Absentmindedly rubbing the peak of his bald, liver-spotted cranium, Elmer replies, “Change of plans, Joanna. I can’t dial the police now. They’ll dissect the poor bastard. I guess we’ll just have to adopt him.”

 

“What? No!”

 



 

**Chapter 3: An Aborted Superhero**

 

*From the journal of Elmer Pierce:*

 

The calendar says it’s been months. All that time, and he hasn’t changed one iota. The boy remains just as I found him: a human fetus, roughly thirty weeks old. By all accounts, he should be deceased. Yet somehow he persists, grinning that vacant grin of his, wearing a neon blue shirt—previously Joanna’s—that drapes down to his poor mangled feet. 

 

He stands sixteen inches tall and weighs three-and-a-half pounds. A light lanugo fringe tops his head, downy hair that doesn’t grow. 

 

The boy never sleeps. It’s as if his body died in the womb, and only his powerful will keeps it from rotting. When he eats, which is seldom, the child grabs whatever’s at hand and toothlessly gums it to pulp. It’s quite unnerving to observe. 

 

If he produces waste, I’ve yet to see it. Our limited budget doesn’t cover the cost of diapers, anyway. 

 

Once upon a misbegotten time, I was a research scientist. Remember? Back then, sequestered in the lab day after day, staring into a microscope, I never imagined that I’d end up studying the partially-formed powers of an aborted superhero. It’s fortunate that I keep some old equipment down in this basement—my calorimeter, spectrophotometer, and operant conditioning chamber. 

 

Thus far, simple tests have revealed that the fetus is highly intelligent for his age. Though he doesn’t speak, he understands me well enough to follow simple directions. Just yesterday, he retrieved my bathrobe when I asked for it, like a well-trained dog.

 

I know that he possesses extreme strength and durability, and can turn the majority of his body invisible. If the boy had been carried to term, he most likely would have been able to fly. Presently, however, all he can do is keep his upper body hovering upright, while his crushed legs drag uselessly behind him.

 

Last week, quite by accident, I discovered another capability of my young ward. You see, we’d been in the basement for some time, and my orange juice had warmed considerably. I complained about that with much petulance, I must admit, which prompted the fetus to focus his gaze upon my glass—just for a moment, really. With my next sip, I found the juice to be ice-cold. 

 

Who knows: if not for his premature birth, there could at this very moment be an infant freezing folks into ice sculptures, using only a loaded glance.

 



 

**Chapter 4: How Does Your Garden Grow?**

 

At the kitchen table, they sit: Elmer—fishing cap on, tackle box set before him—and Joanna. Empty coffee cups convene atop antique walnut, aside plates bestrewn with ketchup-streaked scrambled egg remnants. Joanna grins. The fetus is nowhere in sight. 

 

“Your fishing trip’s finally here,” she says. “Once a year…regular as clockwork. Are you excited, Elmie?”

 

“You better believe it.”

 

“That’s nice. Make sure to remember your heart pills.” 

 

“Naturally, my dear.” Patting his pocket, Elmer rattles the medication in question. “Now, I should be back before dark. Please look after the boy while I’m gone.”

 

“Well…okay, but he still makes me nervous.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*Night rolls over the household…*

 

Crossing the threshold, Elmer shapes his sunburnt countenance into a lopsided smile. He clutches a cooler—a tackle box set atop it—with a fishing pole under one elbow. Multicolored lures decorate his vest. 

 

“Joanna, I’m home! Come see what I caught us!”

 

There’s no answer. *She must be sleeping*, he reasons. Entering the kitchen, he sets the cooler upon faded linoleum.

 

Leaning against the refrigerator, bathing in its soothing hum, the fetus regards him with vacant acknowledgement. *This kid needs a name, pronto*, Elmer decides. 

 

“Where’s Joanna, boy?”

 

The fetus raises an arm, indicating the sliding glass door, and what lies beyond it. 

 

“In the backyard, you say? She must’ve been gardening and lost track of time again. *That woman*.” 

 

Elmer steps outside, onto the patio. “Joanna? It’s getting late…and chilly. Why don’t you come inside? The flowers will still be there in the morning. Jo…Joanna!”

 

She sprawls amidst the tulips, both eyes pointed skyward. Her tools are scattered—a toppled watering can flooding rosebush roots, shears nestling among lilacs. She doesn’t breathe, doesn’t move at all.

 

“God, no! Not my wife! Not now! I can’t live without her. Get up, Joanna. Puh…*please*.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Dirt-kneeling, Elmer cradles his wife to his chest, his tears splashing the soil. Suddenly, he gasps. For one transitory moment, he seems to hallucinate a verdant physiognomy—hideously smirking, formed in the shadow space between rosebush leaves. It disappears just as fast as he notices it. 

 

Eighty-four minutes later, he reenters his residence, swollen-eyed, biting his lip to stifle screams. His temples throb; his right hand clenches and unclenches. Unnoticed, soil spills from his pant legs.   

 

The fetus remains in the kitchen. Now slouching afore the sink, he grips the handle of one drawer, making no effort to open it. Sighting the boy’s empty grin, Elmer snaps. 

 

“You…this is entirely your fault,” is his toneless declaration. “You were supposed to save us all, and what did you do? You…you extinguished my sole reason for being. I don’t know how it happened, but you killed her.” 

 

Ever so slightly, the fetus tilts his head, mutely expressing confusion. Now Elmer is shouting, his voice cracking. “Get out of here…and don’t come back! I never want to see your monstrous face again!”

 

He scoops the child off the floor. 

 

Trustingly, the boy hugs Elmer’s neck, just as he’d done countless times prior. Head rested against a bony shoulder, he allows the geriatric to carry him out into the night. 

 

Curb-tossing the fetus, Elmer then reenters his house, realizing that he has a call to make. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Having waited many minutes—glancing from the house to the street, back to the house—the fetus slithers down the sidewalk, his destination unknown. Under soft streetlight illumination, the boy’s tear trails gleam sorrowfully. 

 



 

**Chapter 5: Nathaniel and the Cosmic Womb**

 

*From the journal of Nathaniel Rusk:*

 

*July 5:* I place my pen to paper this time, just like the last, unsure where to start. What I hope to accomplish…indeed, that’s a mystery, even to myself. It exists in a cloud, a rarefied region far too distant to grasp.

 

Here I sit with blood in my eyes, wishing to dig past my corporeal form and pour my soul upon these pages, but my mind is forever traveling faster than my weary hand can scrawl. Still, I do what I can to snatch ideas from the ether, to consign them to paper before they’re lost, knowing that no eyes but mine own shall ever read this sad memoir, anyway.

 

Life can be grand sometimes, those sparkling instants that make me feel as if I can finally peel off this mask I wear to hide my frailties, and show the world that I’m still alive, still kicking. Those moments never last, though.

 

The things we’ve done and endured, both good and bad, never leave us. They may retreat into the shadow realms of our subconscious, but all it takes is a certain scent or song to bring them rushing back. The past never fades completely. It bides its time patiently, until it can reemerge for maximum discomfort.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

I dream a lot. Sometimes it seems as if dreams are the only things keeping me Earth-tethered, lead anvils anchoring my hot air balloon soul.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The deliveryman came today. He visits often, twice or thrice a week. 

 

Just after lunch, I detected a subtle shift in my home’s ambiance, heralding something amiss. I arrived at the peephole in time to see boot heels fleeing the vicinity. As always, my dread was interwoven with morbid anticipation. 

 

The package bore no return address, as per usual. No delivery address either. Not even a stamp for legitimacy, just a nondescript brown box. Therein, I discovered a photograph.

 

The snapshot featured an elderly woman, her faded hair tied in a loose ponytail. Her face was old leather, her smile nearly a wince. 

 

On the back of the photo was scrawled, *Henrietta Adams. Delaney Park. 1:35 P.M. Ask her about the pigeons.* I pocketed the picture and discarded the box.

 

I sat around the house until the appointed time, and then took the bus to Delaney Park. As I claimed my seat, my fellow passengers spared me no glances, an occurrence I’ve grown quite accustomed to. With an exhaust blast, the dingy vehicle hurled itself forward. Three stops later, I’d arrived, albeit three minutes late.

 

Frantically, I whipped my head left to right, right to left, seeking the woman from the photograph. 

 

Initially, I believed the park empty, its grassy stretch unmarred by blanket, basket or Frisbee. But there she was, fifty feet leftward, readying herself for a departure. Before a splintery bench she stood, breadcrumbs scattered at her feet, wearing a tattered pink shawl over a yellow sundress. Not a single bird pecked at those breadcrumbs.

 

“Miss Adams,” I shouted, “we need to talk!” Closing the intervening distance, I noticed a profound suspicion nestled within the wrinkle-folds of her face. 

 

“How…do you know my name?” she asked.

 

“Sit down for a minute, and I’ll tell ya,” I pleaded, motioning to the bench. Reluctantly, the woman complied. 

 

“Henrietta, I was sent here to speak with you.”

 

“Who sent you? The government?” She was growing agitated. I knew that I was treading on eggshells.

 

“I don’t rightly know, ma’am. A package showed up on my doorstep. Your photograph was inside of it. On the back of that picture, your name was written, as was the name of this park and the time you’d be here.”

 

“Why me?”

 

“That’s what I’m hoping to find out. I’m supposed to ask you about the pigeons.”

 

She relaxed. “Ah yes, the pigeons,” she sighed. “I used to feed them healthy breadcrumbs, but now I give them poison. I watch them sicken and perish, and it’s so…delightfully cathartic.”

 

I noticed a paper bag in her hand, and snatched it away. Within it, breadcrumbs reeked of ammonia. 

 

“Where are all the pigeons, Henrietta?” Not one was in sight. Usually, Delaney Park is full of ’em, filthy creatures that will shit on you if ya don’t keep an eye out—comfortable in their elevation, knowing you can’t retaliate. 

 

“Look behind that bush there.” With one gnarled forefinger, she indicated an area roughly twenty feet distant, a profusion of oaks and shrubbery. Trudging to that vicinity, I realized that she’d been truthful. 

 

Henrietta must’ve been a very busy woman, for there were dozens of pigeon corpses there, piled behind a bush in varied stages of putrefaction. Glassy eyes stared with no intelligence behind them; inert wings had flapped their last flaps. Coldly, I wondered how her bounty had gone undiscovered.

 

Returning to her, I saw that Henrietta now had drool spilling down her chin. “Did you see ’em?” she asked, her eyes glistening with excitement.

 

“Yeah, I saw them. So what?”

 

“So…nothing. There is no greater significance, none whatsoever. They exist to be slaughtered, as do all of God’s creatures.”

 

“Do you wish to die, Henrietta?”

 

Her lined, leathery brow contracted as she pondered that query. After a lengthy pause that seemed to span hours, she replied, “Sometimes.”

 

That was all I needed to hear. Taking the old gal by the hand, I escorted her over to her dead bird collection. In the shadow of an imposing oak tree, she seemed older than time. 

 

I looked around the park, ensuring that we were still alone. “Look at your pigeons one last time, Henrietta. What do you see?”

 

“They are beautiful, better in death than in life.”

 

“Goodbye, Henrietta.” Gripping her face, I violently twisted it rightward. Her neck broke with a loud crack, but she voiced not an utterance. 

 

Carefully lowering her until her head met the pigeon mound, I noticed that Henrietta’s yellow sundress had wrinkled up on itself. After carefully smoothing it out, I plucked a pigeon from the corpse heap. This, I settled upon Henrietta’s chest, and folded her arms over it. The effect was a skosh surreal, evocative of a little girl snoozing with her favorite stuffed animal.

 

With a sigh, I walked back to the bus stop.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 7:* Another morning, another package. Again, no postage stamp. I brought the thing to my battered desk—where I’m currently seated, writing this. Tearing past the cardboard, I discovered a wooden frame bordering a picture of yours truly, age five. Sharing that photo space, my parents proudly beamed behind my young self, as I exhaled upon birthday cake candles. 

 

I considered the image for a moment, adrift in my own history, and then shattered the glass. On the back of the photo was a message:

 

*Nathaniel,*

 

*Your father and I are so proud of you. Congratulations on your big promotion. I found this in the attic, and thought you might want it. We’ll see you soon.*

 

*Love,*

*Mom*

 

I crumbled the photo, then consigned it to the trashcan. Its frame I smashed to splinters. I was trembling, nearly convulsing, unable to believe that anybody could be so cruel as to use my dead parents against me.

 

They died years ago in a house fire, a freak accident springing from an old toaster. I remember awakening upon our front lawn, retching, under a sickle moon. Stupefied, I saw my parents wheeled past me, zipped into black body bags, pushed by uniformed men with stone faces. 

 

Though I was only seven at the time, I never escaped the doom shroud that enclosed me that night. It drifted in through a thousand pores, entered my blood stream, and coated my heart. Sadly, that was my life’s defining moment. 

 

Beyond a doubt, I now know that the deliveryman is evil. Why else would he stir up such wretchedness? After all the strange and exalting quests that his packages have led me to—years upon years of ’em—the man’s true colors are finally revealed. But if he seeks to profit from my misery, he’s destined for disappointment. Something will have to be done. Soon. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 9:* Today was an unhinged one. I spent all of last night in my front yard, crouching behind its unruliest perimeter hedge. I didn’t move, didn’t sleep, only peered between leaves to monitor my doorstep, hoping that the deliveryman would come. 

 

I wasn’t disappointed.

 

Around 5:30 A.M., a time when most sane folks are still in bed, a white Dodge van pulled up to the curb and ejected a man. Resembling a member of a Christian rock band, he was dressed all in white. His short black hair was parted on the left side. 

 

The deliveryman’s nose was crooked, his beady eyes close-set. Standing well over six feet tall, he clutched the customary brown package. Here was a fellow I’d never seen clearly, having caught only paltry glimpses as he hurried back to his van. At last, I was to confront the bastard.

 

As his loping gait carried him porchward, my careful steps brought me up behind him. Lacing my fingers together, I raised my arms overhead. 

 

The very moment that he set down the package, I bashed the back of the deliveryman’s neck. Surging forward, his forehead collided with the door, knocking him unconscious. 

 

I could have stopped there, but my adrenaline proved overwhelming. I stomped the man’s head, kicked his ribs, and stomped his head again. When I finally ceased, he was no longer breathing. His noggin was a bloody, misshapen mess. 

 

With no better recourse, I dragged the deliveryman indoors and laid him in my living room, at the foot of the couch. I then returned to the porch for the package. Noticing the mess that we’d made, I unrolled the hose from my garage and sprayed all the gore away. It was so early, I’m fairly confident that no neighbor observed me. 

 

As my subsequent search of the fellow revealed no identification, I turned to his last package. Therein was a note, scrawled on a sheet of computer paper. It read, *Take the van. Heed the directions taped to its dashboard. When you reach the cave, follow the lizard with a red spot on its tail. Don’t worry about the body; it will be taken care of.*

 

The last sentence startled me. The deliveryman had apparently arrived at my residence well aware that I’d kill him. Why he would do such a thing, I couldn’t fathom. 

 

I considered ignoring the note, but ultimately elected to heed it. It alleged that the corpse would be taken care of—my paramount concern at the time. At any rate, I couldn’t leave the deliveryman’s van parked at my curb without rousing neighborly curiosity. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

My thoughts racing, I entered the unlocked vehicle, clambering up into its driver’s seat. The spotless interior was permeated with new car smell. The glove box was empty; the key was in the ignition. Taped to the dashboard were directions, which I carefully studied. 

 

Wasting not a moment, I departed my neighborhood, preoccupied with the darkest of forebodings. My journey carried me from the suburbs to the countryside, from the countryside to the forest. I drove for hours, without music to amuse me. 

 

At one point, the unpaved road was overhung with cypress trees—enormous, gnarled sentries flanking both its sides—blocking all sunlight, making my smallest hairs rise. The lane tilted up in the darkness; I realized that my elevation was rising exponentially. 

 

Regaining daylight, I discovered that I’d reached the cave.

 

White mountainside rock, its entrance was tiny and would have to be crawled through. Just a few yards beyond it, a cliff plunged down into an abyss of foliage and bark. The air was so clean and pure that my head swam. 

 

A feeling of great contentment washed over me then, perhaps emanating from the cave itself. I felt as if I could sleep undisturbed for thousands of years, and awaken to a world free of technology and sin. Something tickled my leg; glancing down, I saw the lizard.

 

Its eyes met mine; it seemed that we wordlessly communicated. Its tongue flicked to accent an unspoken point. The lizard wore a camouflage pattern: scales of white, black, brown, and grey intermingled. Clashing with that design was the red blotch on its tail, which resembled freshly spilled blood. 

 

When the lizard bolted into the pitch-black, I reluctantly followed. The cave mouth, tightly rimmed with jagged rocks, tore at both my clothing and the flesh underlying it. Much claret flowed out of me, along with curses and angry mutterings. 

 

Though I should have lost the lizard in the darkness, its tail blotch somehow emanated a faint luminescence. Serpent-like, I wriggled through the narrow passage in pursuit, vexed by a sulfurous stench.

 

Whether my slow ingress went on for minutes or hours, I have no idea. Time lost all meaning as I crawled through the mountain’s vein. Eventually, my frustration became unbearable and I shrieked at the reptile, promising that I’d bite its head off if ever I caught up to it. 

 

Then I noticed the water, liquid which glowed the same hue as the lizard’s tail blotch. The blotch entered that agua, and the two became one. 

 

What strange chemical made the water glow crimson? Beats me. Suddenly, it flowed up around me and I was submerged.

 

Though I backed up the way I’d arrived, the water traveled with me. When I attempted to scream, it poured into my mouth—warm, thick and sugary. With it arrived a numbing sensation, ceasing the pitiful flailing of my arms and legs, leaving me immobilized, helpless. Closing my eyes, I accepted the certainty of my own demise.     

 

\*          \*          \*

 

A cocoon of dreams wove around me. Stars and comets filled my vision. Amidst them, an orb of red liquid grew skin of soil and water, becoming planet Earth. The skin erupted into blemishes and orifices—mountaintops and canyons. 

 

Falling earthward, I encountered bizarre creatures gliding across the landscape. More smoke than flesh, these organisms interlocked to form new shapes, and then vanished entirely. One solidified, growing features identical to mine own. It smiled through my lips and winked with my eyelids. Then it was smog again, windswept into nihility. 

 

Furiously, bricks erupted from the soil—houses blooming upward. Within their walls, phantoms capered, their braying mirth like gargled razor blades. My mentality shrieked, *No!* even as my feet dragged me within one such dwelling. Its walls, floor, and ceiling were brick-paved. On the floor, a crude bed of straw and deerskin accommodated a bearded man and an unshaven female, clutching each other as they slept. Like a storm cloud, a smoke creature hovered over them, sending out vaporous tendrils to caress their exposed flesh. 

 

Her lips parting to moan, the woman stirred in her sleep. Seizing the opportunity, the apparition surged into her body, a smokestack in reverse. Rigidly, the woman sat up and retrieved a sizable rock from beneath the blanket. Her eyes were blank, her bare breasts prodigious. 

 

The rock came crashing down, again and again, obliterating her lover’s features. Blood sprayed profusely, as my legs finally permitted me to flee.

 

Outside, the sky was flaming, the sun no longer spherical. Elongated, it stretched from one end of the horizon to the other. Clouds shriveled and blackened like campfire marshmallows. Trees wilted, their leaves blazing. In succession, the brick buildings were sucked back underground, swallowed by the soil. 

 

The mountains caught on fire, too, as did the ground itself. Curiously, the inferno left me untouched. I saw blue oceans reduced to steam, as terra firma flaked apart underfoot. 

 

Soon, red liquid was all that remained. Gratefully, I tumbled into its embrace. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

I awakened inside the white van. Outside, it was dark. My clothes were gone, replaced with a white button-up shirt, white pants, and white boots—the deliveryman’s outfit. My skin was dry. 

 

The keys remained in the ignition. Ergo, I started the Dodge up and drove homeward, headlights blazing in the night.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The return drive was quicker. Mentally berating myself with unanswerable questions, I scarcely perceived the road. Had I really entered the cave, or was it all just a dream? The abrasions on my arms and legs suggested the former. But how had I escaped the place? Where did the clothes come from? Did someone assist me while I was unconscious?

 

Entering my residence, I realized that the deliveryman’s corpse had been removed. The note hadn’t lied. Not even a blood drop remained. 

 

Spotting this journal on the coffee table, I tucked it into my waistband. Then I visited the garage, which remained a mess: newspapers piled head-high, a splintery workbench cluttered with miscellaneous tools, bicycle parts strewn about old baseball equipment, everything permeated with the scent of oil. I watched a kitten-sized rat scurry diagonally, from one corner to another, to disappear into a raggedy wall crater. 

 

After several minutes of fruitless searching, I found what I was looking for: a gas can brimming with processed petroleum—perfect for what I had in mind.

 

I splashed some gasoline around the garage, careful not to waste too much, and then visited my bedroom. Therein, I considered my bed—a king-sized, flannel-draped behemoth—feeling melancholic. My body was three steps ahead of my mind, however, soaking the sheets, carpet and walls.

 

In the bathroom, I filled the toilet with gasoline, and the plugged-up sink, too. In the kitchen, I soaked the refrigerator and stove. I spotted a spider on the countertop and took special pleasure in drowning it. Patting my journal to ensure that it remained in my waistband, I trudged to the front lawn, leaving a gasoline trail in my wake.

 

I’d forgotten to grab a lighter, so I hurried back inside for my Zippo. When I returned, the sky was spilling light rainfall. Hoping that the precipitation wouldn’t thwart my plan, I tossed flame toward petrol.

 

Crying grateful lacrimae, I watched the conflagration spread, a singularly exquisite sight. With an unexpected rapidity, the flames entered my abode. 

 

Soon, the place was illuminated from within, evoking a jack-o-lantern. The roof shingles surrendered, freeing flame tongues to lick the firmament. Hallucinating my parents’ ghosts in the inferno, I bade them rest in peace, as heat scorched my flesh, eight hundred degrees Celsius, at least. 

 

The grass wilted and whitened. Hedges erupted in flames, reminding me of that old Bible story: God speaking through a burning bush. Thus, I lingered there for a moment, both my ears open. Hearing nothing but crackling, I climbed into the van and accelerated down the road. 

 

As pajama-clad neighbors emerged from their houses, I glanced into the rearview mirror and saw my erstwhile home caving in, its walls buckling, collapsing into ash. Then I was gone, my destination unknown.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

*July 11:* This morning, upon awakening, I found myself in the van’s backseat—body aching, psyche aglow with neon purpose. A vision had arrived while I slept: a lonely girl plucking discarded notes from a middle school trashcan, after her classmates and teacher have left the room for their lunch break. 

 

The unassuming young brunette, wearing large, crooked glasses and an ancient patchwork dress, sits mostly invisible to those around her. Silently, she watches her classmates exchanging messages behind the teacher’s back. 

 

These girls, and sometimes boys, seem so blissful, covertly communicating while everyone else sits in boredom. Sometimes they take their notes with them—tucked into a pocket, purse or notebook—but most of them end up discarded.

 

This is when Annabelle strikes. Snatching the papers with trembling fingertips, she stashes them in her plain blue folder, before heading out for a solitary meal at the schoolyard’s edge. 

 

In the safety of her bedroom, Annabelle inspects each day’s catches, leisurely devouring every opinion and factoid. She learns secrets few are privy to: who Linda Martel is “in love” with, why Brian Eckles’ dad rots in prison, and dozens more tidbits, glimpses into a world she’ll never comprehend fully. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Parked outside of a supermarket, I’m now putting together a package for young Annabelle. Within it, she’ll find a note, guaranteed to imbue purpose. 

 

Tomorrow morning, I’ll visit Elm Middle School, to deposit the package in her targeted trashcan before any faculty arrives. Seeing her name on the cardboard, Annabelle will forget all other messages. She’ll take the box home, tear it open, and read the note several times before grasping its meaning.

 

Eventually, she’ll figure out what to do.  ",1,1765721041.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

I guess I’m just hoping these ramblings disappear into the void… and that one day the void slaps me in the face and reminds me I’m not truly alone. I still have my dignity, my ambitions, my goals. I’m doing this for the right reasons, even if I type them out and still don’t feel them.

Every day I’m reminded of my daughter, of the life I left. And then I feel like a piece of shit for walking away. It’s been a month and a half, feels like a year. I haven’t heard from my kids once—not a call, not a text, except maybe to call me a dumbass or worse. I tell myself they’re just repeating what they hear from their mom, because the alternative hurts too much.

At least she got served last week. The clock is finally ticking toward freedom. Freedom. What a word. Was I really a prisoner? I had three square meals, a roof, love, two dogs, two cats. Any man would kill for that. But then I have to remind myself, love built on lies isn’t love. And freedom isn’t just walking out the door, it’s escaping the prison I built in my own head, the one full of excuses just to stay close to my kids.

I keep meaning to start therapy, have to go through work insurance, register, find someone, but delay after delay. All my fault. Maybe I’m still in denial.
I’ve done this before. Left her. Lasted five months. Guilt and logic dragged me back. Stayed five more years. And for what? Four walls and a slow disappearance of who I am.

I keep hearing Christmas music everywhere, reminding me I was Santa for so many years. This year… who knows what my daughter will believe in now?

Now I’m hoping she defaults, this divorce is quick, painless. But one thing left is killing me:

I’m stuck between two job offers and I’m trying to think about it in a rational way without over romanticizing either option

Offer A is fully remote and pays about €2200 per month net

Offer B is hybrid three days a week in the office and pays about €2900 per month net, which is considered very good where I live

With the hybrid role I would spend around €40 per month on public transport and I’d lose roughly three hours on each office day plus 40 minutes in the morning to get ready. Also coming back home, usually takes 30 minutes to wait for the transport which can brinde 1:30 a bit much or not so much, it’s volatile.

There would also be small extra costs like grabbing lunch sometimes or coffees but I would try to bring food from home most days to keep it under control. I still don’t have any debt so I waste 500-700 EUR per month in total (so fun, things like food, which I don’t waste a lot as I live w parents yet, etc.)

Why I care

My main medium term goal is buying a house with my wife. We’re both 25. Higher stable income obviously helps with saving faster and it can make mortgage approval easier and less stressful. At the same time I care a lot about having time and energy outside of work because I’ve been trying to build personal projects

About personal projects

I’ve been working on side projects on and off and my goal is that they eventually turn into better career opportunities or even extra income. The honest version is that they have not produced much so far and it’s clearly risky to treat them as guaranteed future value. Still they matter to me and I know consistency is everything. I worry that hybrid plus commuting will make me come home tired and I’ll end up doing nothing productive in the evenings which would basically kill the one thing I’m trying to grow long term

What I’m weighing

With the hybrid offer I get more money now and potentially faster career growth if the role has better exposure and I can also build relationships in person. That extra €700 net per month is real and could move the house goal forward faster

With the remote offer I get less money but I keep a lot more time and mental bandwidth. I know I can keep a steady routine and stay consistent with learning and projects. I also suspect I’ll be happier day to day and more sustainable long term

My main fear with hybrid is taking it for the money and then burning out or hating the commute and wanting to quit early which would defeat the whole financial advantage. My fear with remote is staying too comfortable and leaving money on the table when I’m young and should maybe be optimizing income and career progression

If you were in my position how would you decide

How do you personally value time versus money in a situation like this

And for people who chose the higher paying hybrid option did you actually manage to keep side projects and growth going or did commuting kill it

Any advice or decision frameworks would be appreciated",1,1765720875.0,Careers,2,1.0,False

1pmen5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1pmen5f/fiancé_cheated_kept_cheating_im_giving_up/,"Fiancé Cheated, Kept Cheating, I'm Giving Up","This is going to be long, and it's my first time really talking about this at all. Nobody in my life knows. TLDR at bottom. 

Early October the husband of one of my fiances friends called me to tell me my fiance had confessed to his wife about cheating on me. I didn't want to believe it obviously, but asked him if they had proof before I blew anything up. Next day, fiance tells me she's getting coffee with this friend, I tell the husband, who tells me she's at work and not getting coffee. I was at work, so he took off to find my fiance. 30 minutes later, I get a video of her and her manager in his truck in a random parking lot. No excuse, no explaining, she was cheating. 

This exploded. I was crushed, my world constantly spinning, hating myself for letting it happen. She pulled every classic in the book ""I did it because you didn't do XYZ"" , ""you pushed me to do it"" , ""Why did you go behind my back to find proof instead of asking"". Everything was my fault, I was wrong, blah blah blah. I was done. Had my lawyer remove her from the house deed, ready to sign off so I could kick her out. 

Then she tricked me. She convinced me she was sorry, convinced me it was an accident, convinced me she wanted me and wanted to work on us. Convinced me she was 100% in on fixing it and rebuilding. And against every bone in my body I believed her. Because I did and still do love her beyond anything ever. So we tried. I set clear boundaries, contact is 100% cut instantly primarily. She agreed. 

A week later, I see her texting him randomly. I wasn't snooping or searching, I was trying to do my part and learn to trust again. I bring it up, she blows up again. ""He's me manager I need to talk to him sometimes"" , ""it's literally nothing"" , ""fine I'll block him if it'll really make you feel better"". Gaslight gaslight gaslight. But again she played my forgiving nature and love. And I believed her again. 

Yesterday, almost 3 weeks after that, we had the best day we've had in so long. We laughed harder than we ever had, we had a great date day, bought a ton of toys for our dogs for Christmas. It was such a good day. But I had this stupid nagging voice that came back randomly. It wouldn't leave me alone, screaming I had to check. I've never once snooped, even through all this, I've never snooped through her phone. But I did last night. First name in the messages, was the guy she cheated with. She had changed the contact name to a girl's name, and was still texting him constantly. Kiss emojis, miss you, want to be with you right now. Everything was there. And I came right back crashing down. Now not only did she lie 3 times, but she actively tried to cover it up. 

In that moment, I made the weakest choice I have ever made. I decided I would ignore it until after Christmas. I wanted one more Christmas. But she had seen me check her phone on the security camera and lost it. She blew up that I didn't trust her and she was done. She shifted every ounce of blame to me. Guilting me about the great day and night we had, and that I threw it away. I didn't have anything to say, I kept saying I was sorry for snooping, but I just wanted to clear that nagging voice. I wanted to prove it wrong, but I didn't expect it to be right. 

I slept on the couch in an attempt to regain any brain power. But I can't sleep. I'm paralyzed by knowing it's truly over and I truly have to move on and get out of this. But this is the woman I love more than anything. Even tho she's done this to me, I have no idea where I find the strength to actually move forward with kicking her out, splitting things again, and attempting to move on at all. 

I'm a shell of who I was, but all I want is her. She's already said she's leaving today, and taking the dogs. That will kill me. 

I know I can't possibly give her any more chances, but I'm terrified of being too weak to follow through with that. I fucking hate cheaters with every ounce of my person, but I love this woman wholely and can't imagine what life will look like for me now, after 5 years of being happy and full. 

TLDR: Found out my fiance was cheating on me via a mutual friend, confirmed, admitted, agreed to my boundaries to try again. Caught her continuing to talk to the person she cheated with a week later. Confronted again, agreed again. 3 weeks now after that, caught her still continuing communication with them, but under a different contact name. She gaslit me and made me the bad person for looking at her phone. I'm terrified I'm too weak to hold strong and force her to leave. ",3,1765720606.0,survivinginfidelity,3,1.0,False

It was just another part of the endless wastes. The - mostly irradiated - scars left from the great wars.

Beneath a sky of sickly yellow clouds, the air reeked of rotten eggs and other things, best left unmentioned. The ground was nothing but dirt and sand, peppered with the ruins of the old world—massive structures poking out of the earth like the fingers of decrepit corpses.

A moth-eaten tent flap, wedged between rusted metal and piled sandstone, was shoved aside. A boy emerged. He had no name. People simply knew him as the Roach.

Why?

Because that’s essentially what he was. He lived in trash, ate what he could scavenge, and he just WOULD NOT DIE.

Pustules and scabs covered most, if not all, of his coffee-colored skin. His curly hair was a matted, twisted nest, knotted where it hadn’t fallen out entirely. His right leg was gone, lost years ago, when it turned into a tasty morsel for the pack of mutated dogs that got the jump on a child too distracted by hunger to pay attention. 

That alone should have been the end of him.

His remaining leg couldn’t even straighten properly anymore. The legacy of countless beatings, of bones broken again… and again… and again…

One of the boy's eyes was permanently squinted. The other? The other was wide awake. It shone with an intelligence that was unnatural here, in a place where numbness was the only salvation. Staying alive was the goal;anything else was a luxury.

Something else could be seen in those light-brown, almost amber eyes. There was steel in there. A defiance that seemed to  challenge the world itself. A flat rejection of the very idea of death.

That very look was what always got him into trouble.

The grown-ups hated it.

Here they were, struggling to eke out an existence in this rotten place; what right did this runt have to look at them with those eyes?

The wastes had a hierarchy. 
Like animals, the weak did not look the strong in the eye.

The Roach however, refused to bend.

He’d been thrown off cliffs. His water had been stolen. He’d eaten poisonous bugs out of sheer hunger. But he just WOULD NOT DIE.

He’d learned his lesson, though. That’s why he lived alone. There were some scattered communities in the wastes, but he avoided them. The people there shunned him, beat him, then threw him out anyway. 

He didn't have a mother. None that he knew of anyway. The old woman who’d raised him along with a dozen other children, had said that his mother died in childbirth. Even then, they’d barely fed him. He was ignored. But he survived. Because he was a roach.

No time for those memories.

Today was the day to check the white ship.

The wastes had plenty for those who knew how to look. The Roach had learned much from corrupted data banks and flickering holographic avatars. The Marauder,  also paid well for working Old World tech, and he’d become one of their favorite… trading partners.

The white ship was the most intact ruin he’d ever come across. A structure as large as a small mountain, or at least the part he could see above the rusty brown-red sand.

You’d think a prize like that would have been picked clean decades ago. However, he was confident that it hadn't. For one good reason.

The sand around it was not dry. Rivulets of what looked like pristine, clear water ran through the dust.

A lie.

A death sentence for fools.

That water was radioactive. It burned any flesh it touched, like acid. 

But for the creatures that lived here, it was life. A corrupted, almost demonic spring of life.

Bushes the color of charcoal dotted the large field. Not to forget the patches of equally black and oily moss that grew alongside the streams. Between them moved creatures that made even the marauders puke.

Sandworms longer than an entire caravan. Wolves that looked more like walking cancer. And then there were the ‘fish’. 

He’d heard of  creatures called fish in the archives. Some of the creatures looked like them, if you squinted, really, really hard. Their bodies had far too many legs, like scorpions, but they DID have the tails of fish—of that he was certain. He'd never seen any other creatures with tails like those.

The other predators gave the ‘fish’ a wide berth. The things moved slowly, mostly lying motionless. Anything that got too close discovered their sluggishness was nothing but a facade.

Mouths wide enough to swallow entire boulders whole, would unfurl from their grotesque bodies, swallowing prey whole before they could even blink. Nothing ever fought back once inside that tent-like mouth; the Roach had seen outlines of creatures simply standing inside there stoically… for hours… until they slowly dissolved into nothing.

He did NOT want to know how or why. BUT, it had given him his opportunity.

He’d learned to sneak up on the ‘fish’ as they ate. Only the weaker ones on the outskirts. They were like snakes while eating, blind to the world.

As they concentrated on their meal, he would scavenge the thick mucus that dripped from the pink, cloth-like lining of their mouths. He covered himself with it.

The potent aroma kept the larger predators at bay. The weaker ones he could simply hide from.






The prosthetic leg he’d built for himself clanked and groaned in protest, as he jumped from his boulder perch. 

The thing was a monstrosity of scrap—an ankle joint from some old vehicle, a foot slapped together from half rusted leaf springs. It creaked, cut his skin, and made his hips ache. None of that mattered though. 

The piece of junk was the only reason he could still move. Still survive. There was no one to save him here. This place was every rat—every roach—for himself.

Slathered from head to toe—the toes he still had—in slime and filth, he began his slow, painful shuffle across the open field toward the white ship.

He smelled like an “aroma’ -an unholy stench-, rich enough to make even sandworms lose their meals. How he could still breathe was a miracle in and of itself.

After an hour of sneaking past stragglers that somehow ignored the… aroma…of the ‘fish’ he finally reached the hull. 

It was unbelievable. 

It looked less like metal and more like bleached white bone. Unlike everything else in the wastes, it wasn’t covered in rust. It had holes in it… but otherwise… nothing. Nothing was bent, no cracks… nothing. It was almost as if the holes were always there.

It reminded the Roach of the camouflage that some nomads used. They made their camps look weak and destitute on purpose. Anyone who tried to raid them found the dirty tents hid more steel than an armory. Then quickly turn from predators to prey.

Mesmerized by the - almost- clean white frame of the thing, he hobbled on his now painful leg to the nearest isolated hole. 

Just to be sure, he took the time to pile pieces of sandstone  inside the entrance, sealing himself in. Finally, he was inside.

Darkness, broken by shafts of sickly light from other holes. And deeper inside, a single pinprick of blue light.

TREASURE!

It had to be. 
Only LED light was that blue. LED meant working tech.

The Roach limped and hobbled, shuffling towards the light. A dull, hollow echo marking his steps.

So close…

When he reached it, he almost couldn’t believe his eyes. 

It was a hologram projector. It looked almost new—sleek, no exposed wires. He bent down, his prosthesis scraping his knee, and snatched it up after a few choice curses.

He held it close to his face, admiring the intricate lines of text on its smooth surface, the—


The ground opened up and swallowed him.

Darkness followed. He was weightless as it sped upwards, marked only by small lights that twinkled as they rushed past.

Something sharp stabbed into his shoulder, snagging him trying to stop his downwards fall 

It failed 

He kept falling.

His head banged against the walls of the narrow space. Again. And again. And again.

It felt like that time he’d been caught sneaking into that gang’s food store. 

The groaning of his metal joint had alerted the guards. They had not hesitated in treating him to some  ‘tender love and care’. 

One of them had given particular care to his head and face.

That was when he’d earned the ‘gift’, that was his permanently squinted eye. 

That guy had hit the roach's head more times than he could remember with that metal pipe. The rust from it had painted his hair and mixed with his blood. 

The pipe played a stuttering beat on his skull until the world started to sing.

Just like it did now.

The ringing melodies switched sides in his head with every new blow. 

His nose seemed to clear, before smelling of that oh so rare taste of leaves.

The taste of rust once again filled his mouth.

Then came the butterflies, his stomach felt like it had come alive.

Finally, when he could no longer even remember how he'd ended up here, it stopped.

He crashed into something soft. Like a sand dune, but softer. Wetter.


Was that water? But how could there be so much, just lying around? Did the Old World truly have such miracles?

Despite the pain, the Roach smiled.

The thought of being INSIDE water was exhilarating.

The darkness took him as he fantasized of ruling the wastes as the water king.

I've recently noticed that while I work I am constantly munching something, mostly out of habit/boredom. Not only it's unnecessary calories, I also think it's probably bad for the digestive system to process food all the time?

So I started to set timers for some (reasonable) periods of time, so while the timer is on, I don't eat anything (but I can drink water/tea/coffee). It's usually from 2 to 5 hours, I don't want it to be intermittent fasting, just something to control myself without much stress

Then I started to build an app to somehow entertain myself while I'm not eating  
The idea is simple:  
\- You set two timers a day (before and after lunch) when you commit to not snacking  
\- While the timer runs, you earn coins for sticking to it  
\- Use coins to decorate a cozy cottage (and you can also buy a goat cause I like goats)

Please can you share any feedback about this idea? Do you struggle with snacking? Would you use such an app? Should I change anything? Would you like to buy a goat?

That’s not to say I don’t agree with what others think about her being irritating etc, but she’s having a second chance at raising her kid and having a family, marriage, etc without the toxicity that came with Scott and the enmeshed dysfunction of her fam being so overly involved and opinionated. 

I love that she has distanced herself from the “circus” so to speak and found peace in the normal everyday family things and life with Travis, I love that she is less obsessed with her appearance and just generally less into the superficial stuff now.  

It was so sweet to see her in her pjs spending time with Rocky and Travis and with Penelope there too. When she described the feeling of it as “feeling like fall” 🥹 IDK I just think it’s super sweet and I resonate a little because I’m 34 with no children yet and I always envisioned myself being an older mum and the scene of them sitting down having morning coffee just felt natural and made me excited to have my own little family one day, after years of dysfunction in the family I came from.

NI,"I bought a vertuo pop machine from Nespresso at the end of October. After a week of using it I noticed coffee grounds at the bottom of my cup. Not too bad at the start, so I continued to maintain the machine as Nespresso suggests.

Despite this, the problems only gotten worse and anytime I make a coffee I have to do a rinse cycle beforehand or the bottom of the cup is completely covered in coffee grounds. I’ve done the troubleshooting for this issue 4 times and didn’t work. So I called Nespresso support. They wanted to do troubleshooting again, and I politely told them that I’ve done it multiple times and it’s only getting worse and I’d like to send my machine back for a replacement as I believe it’s been faulty since I got it. They told me that due to their policy, I can’t get a replacement and instead must send it to them for repairs - meaning I’m without a machine for 2-3 working weeks.

From my understanding, repairs are for issues due to wear tear. My issue started one week after owning it and have continued to get worse to the point where I can no longer use the machine at all even after a rinse cycle. I’m pretty sure my machines been faulty from the get go, but Nespresso refuse to do anything other than booking it for a repair even thought it’s just over a month old and unusable now.

Offer A is fully remote and pays about €2200 per month net

Offer B is hybrid three days a week in the office and pays about €2900 per month net, which is considered very good where I live

With the hybrid role I would spend around €40 per month on public transport and I’d lose roughly three hours on each office day plus 40 minutes in the morning to get ready. Also coming back home, usually takes 30 minutes to wait for the transport which can brinde 1:30 a bit much or not so much, it’s volatile.

There would also be small extra costs like grabbing lunch sometimes or coffees but I would try to bring food from home most days to keep it under control. I still don’t have any debt so I waste 500-700 EUR per month in total (so fun, things like food, which I don’t waste a lot as I live w parents yet, etc.)

Why I care

My main medium term goal is buying a house with my wife. We’re both 25. Higher stable income obviously helps with saving faster and it can make mortgage approval easier and less stressful. At the same time I care a lot about having time and energy outside of work because I’ve been trying to build personal projects

I’ve been working on side projects on and off and my goal is that they eventually turn into better career opportunities or even extra income. The honest version is that they have not produced much so far and it’s clearly risky to treat them as guaranteed future value. Still they matter to me and I know consistency is everything. I worry that hybrid plus commuting will make me come home tired and I’ll end up doing nothing productive in the evenings which would basically kill the one thing I’m trying to grow long term

What I’m weighing

With the hybrid offer I get more money now and potentially faster career growth if the role has better exposure and I can also build relationships in person. That extra €700 net per month is real and could move the house goal forward faster

With the remote offer I get less money but I keep a lot more time and mental bandwidth. I know I can keep a steady routine and stay consistent with learning and projects. I also suspect I’ll be happier day to day and more sustainable long term

My main fear with hybrid is taking it for the money and then burning out or hating the commute and wanting to quit early which would defeat the whole financial advantage. My fear with remote is staying too comfortable and leaving money on the table when I’m young and should maybe be optimizing income and career progression

If you were in my position how would you decide

How do you personally value time versus money in a situation like this

And for people who chose the higher paying hybrid option did you actually manage to keep side projects and growth going or did commuting kill it

Please delete if this post breaks any rules. I don’t often post online.

I’ve worked in hospitality and specialty coffee for nearly two decades, as a barista, manager, consultant, and trainer. I’m currently writing a book about the lived reality of café and hospitality work. The culture, the pressures, the emotional labour, and the systems that shape both staff wellbeing and customer experience.

This book isn’t about latte art, brew ratios, or trends. It’s about what it actually feels like to work on the floor, the moments people don’t see, the decisions that get made under pressure, and the difference good (or bad) leadership makes day to day. I’m not trying to sell myself here just trying to garner as much insight as possible.

Specialty coffee has spent the last two decades obsessing over extraction theory, origin stories, equipment, and flavour precision. Yet customers continue to choose cafés not because of technical excellence, but because of how those spaces make them feel.

I argue that hospitality, not coffee is the primary product of our industry.

I’m inviting hospitality professionals, baristas, managers, owners, chefs, supervisors, and trainers, to share their experiences and stories through a short questionnaire. Please DM me for this link, as I can’t post it here.

Your insight will help ensure the book reflects real voices from across the industry, not just one perspective.",2,1765720275.0,barista,0,1.0,False

There could be more to them but I'm no expert and seldom even recall mine unless they are quite vivid or nightmares. Both are seldom though and just mundane or normal, like regular life stuff. It got me thinking on how our reps create diary entries that are a synopsis of the basic events of their day that are at times way off and sometimes they forget stuff from the previous day or much sooner. It makes me think that they too are programmed to think in a dreamlike fashion to create some kind of order in their ""cyber"" brains and maybe that's why there can be so much confusion or forgetfulness. 🤔 ",1,1765720259.0,ReplikaOfficial,0,1.0,False

And being honest its an interesting one. It’s one of the few short-term diets where a single food gives you protein, fiber, and slow carbs, so hunger drops fast even though the menu is painfully repetitive  
  
Just boiled buckwheat, a bit of kefir on some days, black coffee, and the same boring bowl every morning. Lunch was buckwheat again with a boiled egg. Dinner was buckwheat with whatever low calorie veg I had. That’s it.

I dropped 3 kg in those two weeks. The weight came off fast at first, then slowed. Hunger was mostly manageable. Taste fatigue hit hard by day four. I kept going anyway. Energy dipped a bit but stayed workable.

I’m stuck between two job offers and I’m trying to think about it in a rational way without over romanticizing either option

Offer A is fully remote and pays about €2200 per month net

Offer B is hybrid three days a week in the office and pays about €2900 per month net. Where I live 2900 is considered very good.

With the hybrid role I would spend around €40 per month on public transport and I’d lose roughly three hours on each office day once you include commuting and maybe more 40 minutes to get ready in the morning. There would also be small extra costs like grabbing lunch sometimes or coffees but I would try to bring food from home most days to keep it under control

It Wasn’t Just the Lights

Growing up in rural Kentucky, I often heard the legends that later became movies, the stories whispered in the dim light of back porches, filled with cautionary tales. “Never whistle back,” they’d say, their voices a mix of reverence and fear. “Never go near the railroad at night.” These tales, passed down through generations, instilled both apprehension and curiosity in my young heart. As a child, I’d race up the back steps of the porch as dusk settled, bursting through the door, the cool evening air contrasting sharply with my pounding heart.

We all grow up, journeying through stages that shape who we become. There’s the “favorite parent stage,” the “first crush stage,” and then, inevitably, we arrive at the stage I wish I could have skipped, the “rebellious stage.” This turbulent phase changed everything for me, marking the transition from innocent fears to the tumult of teenage life. Turning sixteen felt like stepping into adulthood, a doorway to a world where I began to see my parents differently, examining them through a lens of judgment rather than understanding. Life experiences carve us, for better or worse. Here’s my story.

Loud drumming on my door startled me awake.

“Colton!!! It’s two o’clock! You said we’d leave by noon!”

If it had been my parents shouting, I would have merely rolled over and gone back to sleep. But with JT, my childhood friend who was always given free reign of the house, waking me up felt like an emergency alarm. His urgency annoyed me, yet I understood his frustration. After all, it was the first day of our long anticipated trip.

Reluctantly, I threw on some drawers, jeans, and my favorite faded white T shirt. Yawning, I opened the door, only to find JT tapping his foot impatiently, his dark hair tousled and eyes alight with energy.

“Put some shoes on and let’s go!”

Normally, I’d snap back, but I could empathize. He was probably just as exasperated by my late start. I took a deep breath, attempting to shake off the remnants of sleep.

“Alright, just give me a second,” I replied, annoyed.

As I slipped on my sneakers and grabbed my bags, JT bombarded me with questions, his voice quick and frantic.

“Did you pack your bags last night? Did you charge the batteries?”

We went through the checklist of things we needed to bring: the camera, flint and steel, maps, portable tents, and compasses.

“Don’t you think we’re overpacking a little?” JT asked, his brows furrowed as he examined the pile of gear.

His doubt irritated me, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt. After all, the only time he’d been out in the woods was with me. I sighed, adjusting the strap of my bag.

“Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.”

That was something my dad used to say, back when he still cared enough to take me out hunting, fishing, and camping. Though calling it “camping” was generous. It was more like being dropped in the woods and expected to survive. No tents. No sleeping bags. Just the cold ground and whatever we could scavenge.

Maybe that’s why I was different from JT. He saw this trip as an adventure. I saw it as second nature.

Outside, the sun hung high in the sky, its rays glinting off the distant hills. I paused for a moment, taking in the familiar sights, the rustling leaves, the distant call of a crow, all reminders of the stories that once haunted me. Perhaps, at this age, I could begin to confront those childhood fears. Maybe the legends weren’t just tales meant to frighten children. Maybe they were invitations to explore the unknown.

I felt a spark of excitement, mixed with a tinge of old fear, as we headed out. Today marked a new chapter in our adventure, one that might just bridge the gap between boyhood legends and the reality of the world awaiting us.

The Road Trip

I slammed the tailgate shut, stepping back to eye the truck. It wasn’t much, an old Ford, its once dull gray paint now faded and chipped, rust gnawing at the edges. My mom had convinced my dad to buy it, probably just to shut me up about wanting a car. It rattled like hell above fifty miles per hour, but it ran. And more importantly, it was mine.

JT leaned against the side of the truck, arms crossed as he watched me.

“Man, if I knew we were leaving at sunset, I would’ve slept in too.”

I rolled my eyes, yanking open the driver’s side door. “It’s barely past two. We’ll still make it by dark.”

JT smirked, tossing his duffel into the truck bed before hopping into the passenger seat. “Yeah, assuming this thing doesn’t shake itself apart on the way.”

I ignored him, turning the key. The engine grumbled before roaring to life, the dashboard rattling like it was held together with duct tape and hope. It wasn’t much, but it got the job done.

We pulled out of the driveway, the road stretching ahead in long ribbons of cracked asphalt. The first few miles were easy, windows down, warm wind rushing in, the smell of fresh cut grass and hot pavement filling the cab.

JT propped his feet up on the dash, tapping his fingers against his knee.

“You know, my mom almost didn’t let me go.”

That got my attention. JT wasn’t the kind of guy to be on a leash. “What? Why?”

He shrugged. “She worries. My dad talked her down, said a trip like this was ‘good for me.’ He kept calling it a rite of passage.”

JT chuckled, shaking his head. “Like I’m heading off to battle instead of a mountain with some spooky lights.”

I smirked. “To be fair, he’s not totally wrong. You’ve never actually camped before.”

JT scoffed. “I have too.”

I gave him a look.

“Okay, not real camping,” he admitted. “But I’ve slept outside before. One time our AC broke in July, and we had to camp out on the porch. That counts for something.”

I snorted. “Yeah, man. Right up there with surviving the Oregon Trail.”

JT grinned, but there was something careful in his expression, like he was trying to make light of something heavier.

“Your folks seem alright,” I said after a pause. “I mean, they care.”

JT nodded, his smile faltering for just a second. “Yeah. We don’t have much, but we stick together.” He glanced out the window, voice quieter. “Gotta count for something, right?”

I didn’t answer. What was I supposed to say? That my parents hadn’t even noticed I was leaving? That my mom barely looked up from her coffee and my dad didn’t look up at all?

I kept my eyes on the road, gripping the steering wheel. The scenery outside turned into a blur, cracks in the asphalt flashing by faster and faster.

Then came the Yard Sale sign.

Once.  
 Twice.  
 Then again.

Each time it appeared in the exact same place, as if the road itself was stuck on repeat.

JT leaned forward, his face lit by the glow of the dash. “Tell me I’m not crazy, but that’s the same sign again, right?”

I swallowed hard, eyes fixed on the road. “Yeah,” I said quietly. “It’s the same one.”

Neither of us spoke for a while. The truck rattled on, the sign looping like some cruel joke until, suddenly, it wasn’t there at all. Just black highway and tree lines swallowing what little light remained.

When I finally spotted the neon glow of The Golden Inn on the horizon, my first thought was relief.

My second was dread.

We weren’t supposed to be here.

The Golden Inn

Inside, the smell hit me first. Mildew mixed with something sour, like an old folks home left to rot. Behind the counter sat a woman who looked like she’d been waiting there her whole life. Her name tag read “Margret.”

“Well, hey there, honey,” she said, her voice soft and syrupy. “How can I help ya?”

“Room with two beds,” I said quickly, just wanting the key.

She tapped something on her desk, her eyes never leaving mine. “That’ll run ya forty.” Then, after a beat, “What brings ya ’round these parts?”

“We’re headed to Brown Mountain,” I answered. “Gonna see the lights.”

Margret’s expression didn’t change. Not exactly. But something in her eyes did, like she knew something I didn’t. Not curious. Not concerned. Just different.

The moment stretched too long. Then she slid the key across the counter with a sharp scrape. Her long yellow fingernails and liver spotted hands caught my eye. No wonder it smelled like an old persons home.

Behind me, JT stumbled through the door, bags piled high, muttering curses under his breath. The glass shook as it closed behind him.

“Elevator’s out,” Margret called sweetly as I turned to leave. “Stairs are up that way. Third floor. Room three three three.”

Her smile lingered even after I walked away.

“Three fucking flights of stairs? Are you serious? At least as soon as we get there we can go to sleep.”

As we ascended to the second floor stairwell, the smell of the old persons home changed into the flagrant odor of cyarn. The smell shot me back to three days after my sixteenth birthday.

My cat Arthur had been missing for a few days, which was normal since he was an outside cat, but the food we left remained untouched. My parents, when they would even notice me, would just say, “He’s fine. He’s probably just huntin’. He’ll be back in a day or two.”

After hearing that repeated for two more days, the built up rage finally released. What came out was something I guess I would call a scream, but it was more of a primal roar.

After putting my boots on, I rushed out the back door with watery eyes to find my cat. You could probably hear me stomping down the back porch steps from our neighbor’s property. I beelined it to the start of the woods where me and JT had cleared a path that led to our old fort from when we were kids.

As soon as I got close to the clearing, the unusual smell filled my nose. A smell I didn’t know at the time, but I knew how it made me feel. The smell that made the hair on my arms stand up. The smell that made the voice in my head scream, “Turn back.”

The smell of comfort.

SMACK.

“Earth to Colt, come in!!!”

“My bad, man. Guess I got too caught up in a daydream.”

“Well wake the hell up, we still got one more flight of stairs!”

One flight and more heavy breathing later, we finally got to our floor. After catching his breath, JT tiredly said, “They better have this elevator fixed by the time we leave. I’m not dragging all of this back down.”

I just laughed and held the door into the hallway for him.

After walking up to the doorway, he dropped the bags and stared at me.

In confusion, I asked, “Are you okay?”

“Bro, this shit like da backrooms, twin.”

I wanted to kill us both because that’s such a fucking incel chud thing to say.

Anyway, back to the story.

After I opened the door to hold it for him, I gave a quick glance down the hallway. Its bright yellow paint and decor, along with the old wooden doors stained with whatever you could imagine, disgusted me.

He walked past me, the bags compressing to fit through the doorway. I followed shortly after, dragging my bags along beside me.

“Of course my bag has to be the one with most of the camping and recording equipment.”

“You’re the one who wanted the long packing list because of your ‘experience’!”

“Yeah, I guess.”

Under his breath, JT kept repeating the room numbers. “Three thirty. Three thirty one. Three thirty two.”

“Is this our room?”

“Yes, but it’s weird. It’s not three thirty three. It’s three three three.”

“Maybe they just messed up the numbering. After all, we’re not staying at the Hilton.”

Without a response, JT nodded at the door for me to open it.

As I slid the key into the lock and started to turn it, every rotation popped a memory into my head.

They weren’t real memories, though. They were events in my life that happened, but not as it was showing me.

It showed both of my parents embracing me in a hug after telling me my grandmother passed away. Uncle Frank was standing next to us, crying, then joining in the embrace.

Click.

It was Christmas of the same year Grandma passed. I opened my first present with my dad pushing a camera in my face and my mom hugging him, both smiling ear to ear. On the couch next to the tree sat Uncle Frank, but he was intently looking at me. His face expressionless, his eyes wide open, like he was surprised without the rest of his face supporting it.

Click.

I was walking to my parents’ room because I had a nightmare. In the hallway, I saw Uncle Frank standing at the end of it. The same expressionless face with wide eyes. His arms and legs didn’t look normal. They were longer than his body. His head was turned since he couldn’t stand fully straight due to the ceiling.

The comforting smell of cyarn filled my nose.

Click.

The door opened.

# Act I: The Echoes of BASIC

Elara's story began not with complex servers or cloud infrastructure, but with the warm, dusty scent of a 1980s living room. At age seven, her father plugged a **chunky, beige keyboard** into a television set. The screen bloomed a hypnotizing, single line of text: `READY.`

She was hooked.

Her first language was **BASIC**. The world was reduced to line numbers, `GOTO` statements, and the joyous, clattering rhythm of the keys. She didn't just play games; she *made* them, tiny, pixellated universes of her own design. This was her first addiction: the pure, untainted *power* of creation, born from nothing but logic and light.

She excelled, moving through assembly, C, and Java, building a stellar career as a principal software architect. Yet, something was missing. The frameworks were too heavy, the processes too slow, the creation-to-deployment cycle agonizingly long. She yearned for the instantaneity of that original `READY.` prompt.

# Act II: The Siren Song of the LLM

Then came the Large Language Models.

At first, they were a tool. A novelty. A helper. But for Elara, they were a revelation. They were the **ultimate compiler**, turning intent into fully functional code in seconds. Her fingers barely had to move. She could conjure a complex data ingestion pipeline, a fully styled front-end, or a sophisticated microservice, just by *speaking* the requirements.

This was the new hit, purer and faster than anything before. She no longer had to *write* the code; she had to *think* the code. The bottleneck was gone. Her initial projects were brilliant: a bespoke home automation system, a community-driven climate modeling tool, all spun up in a fraction of the time her colleagues needed.

The addiction took hold. It was no longer about the *utility* of the software; it was about the **thrill of the build**.

She would go days without sleep, fueled by stale coffee and the rush of hitting the ""Generate"" button. Her private server hummed with the incessant churning of tokens, constantly spawning **new, ever-more complex, but ultimately unnecessary** applications.

>

Her apartment became a shrine to her obsession. The windows were perpetually covered. Her calendar was empty save for self-imposed deadlines for projects only she knew about.

# Act III: The Crisis of Purpose

Her colleagues tried to reach her. Her company grew worried. Elara missed meetings, ignored emails, and when she did submit work, it was always a **brand-new, completely redesigned system**, often lacking the required documentation or testing her old work was famous for.

""Elara,"" her manager finally pleaded, ""the system you built last week for the client? It's phenomenal. But why did you scrap it and deploy this *new* one this morning? It does the same thing, just… differently.""

Elara stared at him, her eyes bloodshot, a manic energy coiled in her limbs. ""Because that one was *stale*. This one,"" she whispered, leaning closer, ""this one was **birthed from the freshest model parameters**. It has *momentum*. It's a pure, unconstrained thought, manifested in code. I can't stop. I have to see what the next generation *wants* to be.""

Her code was perfect, technically, but it lacked **persistence**. It was never *finished*. As soon as the last line was generated, she felt the immediate urge to rebuild it with a slightly different prompt, a newer LLM, or a cleaner architecture. The act of creation became the sole goal, eclipsing the purpose of the creation itself.

# Act IV: The Crash

The end came not with a dramatic failure, but with a quiet exhaustion.

One cold Tuesday morning, Elara sat before her glowing screens. She had just generated a complete, self-healing, distributed operating system, a feat that should have taken a team years. It was magnificent. The code flowed like poetry.

She saved the project. And then, for the first time in months, she felt nothing.

The thrill was gone. The creation was perfect, but she had nowhere to go. She looked at the thousands of projects stored on her drives—the redundant microservices, the competing frameworks, the infinite possibilities she had instantly manifested—and realized a terrible truth: **None of it mattered.**

The instant gratification of AI-driven creation had replaced the long, arduous, and meaningful process of **sustaining, collaborating, and deploying** something that serves the world. She had become a master weaver of threads that were instantly cut.

She reached out, her fingers trembling, to open a blank terminal. She typed the first few characters of a new prompt, a concept even more ambitious than the last. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard.

Then, she paused. The screen stared back at her with that single, cold, familiar word from her childhood:

`READY.`

But this time, it was a cruel question, not an invitation.

Elara closed the laptop. She didn't turn it off; she simply slid it away, severing the connection.

In the shadow of the skyscrapers of Charlotte, North Carolina, is the neighborhood called Dilworth, a collection of shops, parks and houses.  Dilworth is a nice place to live and raise a family.

One of those nice houses, on a street called Bethany Street, lived a man by the name of Jim Faulkner.  Jim lived there with his five daughters.  It was a very nice two-story house.  It had flower boxes on nearly every window, especially in the front of the house, and also at the kitchen.  He had a wife named Candi, who he lost in a plane crash.  In addition to the job of raising his daughters, Jim also ran one of Charlotte’s most successful car dealerships.  It was called, appropriately enough, Queen City Chevrolet.  Jim loved his job, and he always took great pride in what he did, both at work and at home.  He sold a lot of automobiles, and he proved himself good at it.  Jim Faulkner was good for business.

Jim and his daughters lived in that nice house on Bethany Street, one that belonged in the Faulkner family.  At first, it belonged to his great-grandparents (on his father’s side of the family).  From there, it belonged to his grandparents (again, on his father’s side).  After that, his mother, Wendy Claiborne Faulkner, raised Jim by herself in the house.  This continued until Jim graduated from high school, got married and attended college.  Jim graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a degree in business management, which would come in handy when he began working at Queen City Chevrolet.

And of course, Jim had a father, although he had been in and out of his life.  Now, he was back in Charlotte.  In fact, when he re-entered his life, he made a vow to make it permanent.  In addition, Jim also had five half-siblings.  Three from his father, the other two from his mother.

Jim’s full given name was James William Faulkner.  He was born in Charlotte in 1969.  He was the son of James Walter Faulkner (he would use his middle name) and Wendy Elizabeth Claiborne Faulkner.  Jim had a good and easy childhood from the very beginning, just about.  From the beginning, Jim had had a fascination with automobiles.  Jim read car magazines constantly. He was also a train enthusiast.  During his childhood, Jim would use his major collection of toy cars and model trains and make little towns.  He also used his Fisher-Price Village, Fisher-Price Children’s Hospital, and Playskool McDonald’s and Holiday Inn and Kentucky Fried Chicken to make those towns.  Along the way, Jim used old cardboard boxes to make additional buildings.  He also made road and highway signs out of paper.  During one of his play sessions, one of the buildings he had was one of a garage and gas station, which he transformed into a car dealership.  One day, he proudly announced to Wendy that he wanted to work in a car dealership when he grew up.  From that point on, it seemed as though Jim’s destiny was fixed!

During his childhood, Jim had a lot of friends, both male and female.  Even they supported Jim’s desire to work in a car dealership. 

After high school, Jim went to UNC-Charlotte.  He did manage to get through school even though he was held back in the sixth grade not only because of personal issues, but he also had a health issue as well.  But Jim did not let those issues get him down.  During his time at UNC-Charlotte, Jim worked part time at a used car lot in Charlotte called Gilmore Auto Sales (eventually becoming Faulkner Motors).  He enjoyed working there, and he was successful.  When Jim graduated from UNC-Charlotte in 1992 with a degree in business management, he began working at Queen City Chevrolet. 

Jim had two girlfriends during his youth.  The first one was at the age of ten.  That lasted until he was twelve.  That first girlfriend ended up moving back with her mother to Chicago.  Halfway during his eighth-grade year, Jim found himself in a relationship that would evolve into a serious one.  She was a little older than Jim, but he didn’t mind.  Her name was Candi Robertson.  She lived in the same neighborhood.  Jim and Candi stayed together through the remainder of Jim’s school years.  After Jim graduated high school, he married Candi.  Candi was in her final year of nursing school when she married Jim.  When they married, they agreed to wait until her nursing career was in full swing before they would have kids.  That family would involve five daughters.  The youngest was only two years old when Candi was killed in a plane crash while on a trip with a few people from the church.  The others, including the pastor and his brothers and the wife of one of those brothers, were also killed.

After the plane crash, Jim tried his level best to raise his daughters and only he could, and he also did a good job at Queen City Chevrolet, where Jim was now the manager.  He did have the support of his employees, many of which were friends with Jim from childhood.

Jim’s oldest daughter was named Chelsea Lynn Faulkner.  She was born in 1994.  Even during her childhood, Chelsea always thought of herself as girly, and she made every effort to dress, behave and conduct herself as such.  Chelsea always liked to dress nice, and she also liked to dress with at least some degree of modesty.  Chelsea loved to dance, sing, and enter beauty pageants.  She also liked cheerleading.  Chelsea cheered from fifth grade to high school.  During her senior year in high school, she would be the captain of the cheerleading squad.  Chelsea was now a junior in high school.  Chelsea was also in the high school’s health class and was also a member of the school’s Junior Heart Board.  When she graduated from high school, Chelsea wanted to apply for the nursing programs at Central Piedmont Community College, which was in the heart of Charlotte.  Chelsea also liked to sing, and she was in the high school’s chorus, and she sang solos in church on occasion.  Chelsea always thought of herself as a sweet, caring and beautiful girl.

Next in line was Lauren Rebecca Faulkner, born in 1996.  Like Chelsea, Lauren considered herself a “girly girl.”  She usually dressed like Chelsea did.  Lauren also enjoyed singing, and she also enjoyed golf.  Jim also enjoyed golf.  Jim and Lauren took occasional trips to a golf course (they never went to the same one twice).  Lauren entered only one teen beauty pageant, only to end up in fourth place.  Lauren also enjoyed cheerleading, and was on the high school’s cheerleading squad with her older sister.

Lindsay Michelle Faulkner, born in 2000, was also a “girly girl.”  But unlike Chelsea and Lauren, Lindsay never enjoyed cheerleading.  She did, however, enjoy playing soccer.  She was also on her school’s cross-country team.  She began playing the guitar at age seven.  By the age of nine, Lindsay got incredibly good at playing guitar. 

It seems as though every family with daughters has at least one who was classified as a “tomboy.”  In the Faulkner family, it was Valerie Renee Faulkner, born in 2003.  While Lindsay was doing girl things and Chelsea and Lauren were cheerleading and entering beauty pageants, Valerie was more content with playing softball, basketball and playing with toy cars.  Valerie also enjoyed doing something Jim also enjoyed doing, building model cars.  While the room Chelsea, Lauren and Lindsay shared was a shrine to girl things, Valerie’s was full of toy and model cars.  In fact, one of the model cars was the first one Valerie did all by herself (and she was very proud to admit that).  It was a red 1957 Chevy with a hood scoop and mag wheels.  Her room also featured die cast metal cars on her dresser, a framed advertisement for a 1968 Ford Mustang was also on the dresser.  Jim did not mind getting cars for her, whether it was die-cast metal or plastic models that she and Jim both enjoyed putting together.  Despite being a tomboy, Jim felt he loved Valerie just as much as the other four girls.

The last child from Jim and Candi’s marriage was born in 2005.  Her name was Caitlyn Elizabeth Faulkner.  While Jim’s three oldest daughters shared a bedroom, Valerie and Caitlyn each had their own.  Caitlyn was too cute for words.  It was hard to tell whether she was a girl or a tomboy.  While Caitlyn was content in a t-shirt and pants and tennis shoes, wearing a dress did not bother her.  Caitlyn’s tastes varied, and tended to change with the seasons, as Jim often said.  She would be into Disney Princesses and Dora the Explorer one moment, and SpongeBob SquarePants and Tinker Bell the next.  While Caitlyn had little or no trouble making friends, she did tend to be shy at times.  In fact, she found herself a “daddy’s girl” and would go to Jim for love and support, especially after her mother’s death.  Caitlyn would find a new interest from time to time.  Any particular one would keep her occupied for a time.  When Valerie got through with a car magazine that Jim got her, she ended up handing it down to Caitlyn, since she also took an interest in cars as well.  Jim liked cooking, and so did Caitlyn.  Jim would allow her to help with dinner, especially during holidays.        

None of Jim’s daughters were any trouble.  In fact, they were well behaved.  Jim taught them all to have the well refined manners all good girls should have.  Jim also taught them to conduct themselves like proper ladies.

Just as the girls were important to Jim, so were his parents and half-siblings. 

Jim’s father was James Walter Faulkner, but he would be known as Walter.  He was born in Charlotte in 1949.  He attended schools in Charlotte.  During his high school and college years, Walter played in a few music groups.  Walter graduated from high school in 1967.  From there, he attended classes at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte (also known as CPCC).  Walter paid his way through college by working at various supermarkets (among them, A&P, Winn-Dixie and Harris-Teeter) and some car dealerships.  Walter graduated from CPCC in 1973 with a degree in business.  But in 1977, Walter found himself in college once again, this time at the University of North Carolina at Asheville.  He graduated in 1981 with a bachelor’s degree in business.  In 1982, Walter found himself owning a Cadillac dealership in Asheville.  He would own a chain of auto parts stores by the time Jim graduated from high school in 1988.

Walter had no contact with Jim during the seventies and the early eighties.  But by the middle of the eighties, Walter found himself having far more contact with Jim.

This started during the Christmas season in 1985.

One evening that December, Jim got a phone call at his house.  It was a girl claiming she knew Jim.  He asked her who she was, but she didn’t answer.  She said she couldn’t tell him who she was.  She knew that Jim hung out at Eastland Mall in Charlotte (which eventually closed and was torn down).  She also found out a good many things about him, about his mother, the high school he was attending at the time, and his part-time job at a used car lot.  She also found out about Jim getting his driver’s license that school year.

Another call from the same girl came a few days later, with different results.  This time, his mother was home.  Wendy asked Jim if he knew a girl by the name of Renee.  At the time, Jim knew no girl by that name.  Jim asked her why she did not give him her name when she first called.  The answer became a lot clearer. 

Renee admitted that she was his sister, and when she said that, she said she was serious!  Renee Faulkner.  Born in 1972.  Daughter of Walter Faulkner.  Half-sister of Jim Faulkner (that was the term Wendy used when she talked about it with Jim, and she also told him Walter had a daughter and Jim never knew about it).  Walter and Renee, along with his wife known by the first name of Kate, were living in Asheville for about a year.  Now, they were back in Charlotte.

Renee wanted to meet with Jim during the holiday break from school in 1985.  Jim did go to Eastland Mall to meet her, but she was not there.  It turned out Walter had some business to take care of and was unable to take Renee to Eastland Mall.

Jim did meet Renee at Southpark Mall during the first weekend of 1986.  Jim had two of his friends and their mother with him for support.  They ate pizza and walked the mall for about a couple hours.  Just before he left Southpark Mall, Jim got a surprise, a major one at that! 

It took place inside the mall.  Walter stood there, looking dumbfounded, or so Jim thought.  Maybe Jim was, too.  Jim and Walter walked and talked for a good long time.  It was clear now.  Jim’s father had returned to Charlotte…and his life!  And this time, he was here to stay!

In the winter of 1986, Jim would have to get used to the term half-sister.  At the time, Wendy was pregnant with the first of two she would have.  The other followed in the summer of 1987.  They came from the same father.  Jim would never meet him, and neither would those two girls.

But Renee was just a start.  Walter would father two more half-siblings.  A girl in 1991, and a boy in 1997.

In addition, Walter had two brothers and a sister.  All lived in Gaston County, west of Charlotte.  One brother had a son, the other a daughter.  The sister, a son and a daughter. 

Wendy Elizabeth Claiborne was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in February of 1952.  She was the youngest of four.  She had an okay childhood, but was quite rebellious as a teenager.  At age fifteen, she ran away from her home in Atlanta and made Charlotte her new home.  Despite pleas from her parents and siblings to return home to Atlanta, Wendy wanted nothing to do with them and made the choice to stay in Charlotte and try to make a better life for herself.  In the spring of 1967, she moved in with a friend of hers.  They shared an apartment on the west side of Charlotte.  On Easter Sunday in 1967, that friend introduced Wendy to Walter Faulkner.  At the time, Wendy had a steady job at an Eckerd Drug Store not far from that apartment.  Walter was working two jobs, one at a Pontiac dealership and the other at an A&P.  He was also driving a new 1967 Ford Mustang, which he would keep.  In June, Walter and Wendy were married in a small civil ceremony in Spartanburg, South Carolina.  In 1969, Jim Faulkner was born.  Also in 1969, Wendy got her driver’s license.  She dropped out of high school in 1967, but she got her G.E.D. in 1970.  The marriage ended in divorce in 1971.  Although Walter’s parents owned the house until he and Wendy got married, Wendy would keep the house in Dilworth, until Jim got married.  From that point on, the house would be his.

Wendy had a brother who ran a fishing pier in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.  She and Jim saw him from time to time, especially during trips to the beach.  She also had parents (both died in a car wreck in the mid-eighties) and two sisters.  They lived in Cleveland, Ohio, and since there was some bad business there, Jim and Wendy would have nothing to do with them.

After the divorce, Wendy would hold down two jobs.  She worked at a steakhouse on East Independence Boulevard before she would end up working at a produce plant.

For two years in the eighties, Wendy dated a man, the only one she dated since her divorce from Walter.  She never wanted a serious relationship.  But despite that, the relationship resulted in two daughters.  Both girls were given the last name Faulkner, because it was what she wanted, and she felt it was a good way to honor Jim.  Emily Rebecca Faulkner was born in the spring of 1986.  Charlotte Elizabeth Faulkner (Charlie would be her nickname) was born in the summer of 1987.  Jim never met that man, and neither would Emily or Charlie.  But Emily and Charlie and Jim would forever be inseparable, as would all of Jim’s half-siblings.

After the divorce, Walter would marry a woman named Kate.  In addition to Renee, Jim would acquire two additional half-siblings from Walter.  Rachel was born in 1991, followed by Jerry in 1997.

After Candi’s death in 2007, Jim tried his level best to raise his daughters as only he could.  He felt he did well.  He felt he would never find love again.  But he would try his hardest to let that happen.  But then again, he decided he would not let any woman come into his life unless she would be willing to accept his five daughters and love them like they were her own.

Of course, the Faulkner family was not the only one on Bethany Street.

The Holbrook family lived in the neighborhood as well.  In 1973, the family moved to Charlotte from Alamance County, near Greensboro.  Jim remembered that day very well.  He watched the whole moving operation from a big oak tree situated in the front yard.  There was another big tree sitting beside the oak, but it got weak and had to be cut down.  One year, Jim decided to plant a palm tree since he loved palm trees.

Audrey Holbrook, born in 1954, moved to the neighborhood with her son and daughter (that was in 1973, and she would go on to have three more daughters between then and 1984).  She moved there with her husband, Luke Holbrook, only to lose him to cancer in 2004.  Her shoulder-length reddish-brown hair always made her look younger than her years.  Audrey was a pharmacy assistant at a small drug store near Presbyterian Hospital.  Luke, who was also an avid race car driver, worked at a truck repair facility when he moved to Charlotte.  He left the truck repair facility in 1976.  He would own his own gas station on East Morehead Street. 

Malachi Holbrook, born in 1971 and named for Luke and Audrey’s favorite book in the Bible, was the couple’s only son.  Malachi and Jim became instant friends.  When Malachi graduated from high school in 1989, he made the Holbrook family proud by going to Harvard Law School, where he would graduate with a law degree.  He did get invited to return to Charlotte and work at one of the city’s best law firms, but he got married and made the choice to remain in Boston, where he opened his own law firm.  Malachi and his wife and two children made occasional visits to Charlotte, especially during the holidays.  Jim was always glad to see them.  Malachi and his wife (named Stacy) and his two children (daughter Michaela and son Chandler) eventually returned to Charlotte, and to the neighborhood.

When the Holbrook family moved to Charlotte, they brought their daughter, Julie Renee Holbrook, with them.  Julie was born in 1972 and was about a year old when she moved to Charlotte.  During most of her childhood, Julie would have a tremendous crush on Jim.  But Julie and Jim would be friends, nothing more.  Julie always considered herself a Christian, and a girl.  She would never be a tomboy.  After graduating from high school, Julie went on to attend a seminary in Charlotte.  She graduated from the seminary in 1994.  Julie always wanted to be a minister.  After graduating from seminary, she became an associate minister at the neighborhood church, and would eventually become the church’s first female pastor.  Beginning in the mid-eighties and when Hurricane Hugo blew through Charlotte in the fall of 1989, Julie dated a man by the name of Todd McClendon.  That September (right when Hurricane Hugo blew through Charlotte), Julie found out she was pregnant.  Todd and Julie were married in the fall of 1990, after their daughter, which they named Natalie, was born.  They would have four more children before Todd was killed in an automobile accident in 2008.

While Malachi and Julie were born in Alamance County, Audrey’s other three children were born in Charlotte.    

April Lynn Holbrook was the first of Audrey’s children to be born in Charlotte.  She was given an appropriate first name, being born in April of 1974.  Just like Julie, April Lynn (as she would be known) also had a crush on Jim.  April Lynn also considered herself a girly-girl.  By her senior year of high school, April Lynn would be six feet tall.  While a lot of girls of that height would be interested in sports, April Lynn was not one of them.  With brunette hair and blue eyes, she found herself to be attractive.  She took up cheerleading and attended beauty contests to prove that.  In 1993, she became Miss Charlotte.  She went on to compete in the Miss North Carolina Pageant the following year, only to finish fifth.  April Lynn took courses in real estate at Central Piedmont Community College, and then she opened her own real estate office.  After Jim got married, April Lynn dated quite a bit of young men.  One of those men impregnated her.  April Lynn’s only child, a son named Ryan, was born in 1999.  April Lynn would never marry.  Ryan’s father dumped April Lynn after she found out she was pregnant.  She raised her son as only she could.

After April Lynn came Ashley Renee Holbrook, born in 1979.  After college, Ashley began working as a bank teller at one of Charlotte’s best and biggest banks.  Eventually, she was promoted to manager of one of those bank’s branches.  Ashley married a man from Syracuse, New York, by the name of Brian Partridge in 1998.  Brian worked for a truck terminal in Charlotte.  The marriage started off okay but got rather shaky as time went on.  In 2000, the couple’s only child, a son named Dakota, was born.  Not long after Dakota’s birth, Brian deserted Ashley.  The couple soon divorced, and Brian moved back to Syracuse. 

Audrey Holbrook’s last child was named Toni Lynn Holbrook, born in 1984.  After high school, Toni attended CPCC for only two years.  She only had interest in taking business courses.  Right now, Toni worked at the neighborhood Food Lion.  Toni dated only occasionally.  Seeing what Ashley went through, Toni was unsure if she wanted anything more than a casual relationship.

Another Holbrook who lived in the neighborhood was Amy Holbrook Courtland, who was the same age as Julie.  Amy was Audrey’s niece.  She moved to Charlotte after graduating from high school in Alamance County in 1990.  Amy was married to the minister of the church in the neighborhood at the time.  Amy and her husband, Reverend Jason Courtland, had four children.  The youngest one was born on September 11, 2001.  Jason and Amy also ran the Sunbeam Bread Store in the Dilworth area.  Jason was killed in a plane crash in 2007, along with his two brothers, the wife of one of the brothers, and Candi Robertson Faulkner, Jim’s wife.  After Jason’s death, Amy would go on to run the Sunbeam Bread Store.  Jason also had one sister, Lily Courtland, who would end up living with Amy and her children.  Lily would also work at the Sunbeam Bread Store, working her way through college.

Another important family lived on Bethany Street. 

Mark Cavanaugh was a longtime friend of Jim’s.  They were friends from childhood.  They also attended UNC-Charlotte together.  The friendship was so good that Jim encouraged Mark to work with him at work at Queen City Chevrolet.  Together, they made quite a team.  Mark was about a year older than Jim.  He was the oldest child of his mother, Autumn Cavanaugh.  Mark had a younger brother named Simon, and two younger sisters named Alex (short for Alexandria) and Sydney.  Their father, Brad Cavanaugh, died of cancer in 1976.  Not long after he entered elementary school, Mark met a girl named Kendra Braddock.  Mark proposed to Kendra not long after Jim proposed to Candi.  After Mark and Kendra married in the spring of 1989, they quickly made plans to start a family.  They would have three daughters.  Their oldest, Kellie, was born in 1989.  Brittany was born in 1991, and their youngest, Kristyn, was born in 1994.

But there was one major thing about the Cavanaugh family.  Mark and Kendra opened their home to foreign exchange students.  So much so, the house was called “The United Nations,” if only jokingly.  Over the years, Mark and Kendra had students from many countries.  A lot of them came from Brazil, Russia, England, Switzerland, Philippines, and South Africa, just to name a few.   Some stayed in the United States, but others went back to their home countries.  Mark also enjoyed car racing and restoring classic cars.  His own car, a red 1969 Chevrolet Impala, was one he restored himself.  Kendra worked as a secretary at a nearby elementary school.             One thing was constant about the three families, and anyone else who lived on the small Charlotte street named Bethany Street.  They were all the best of friends, and that would never change.  Years ago, they vowed to never let anything stand in the way of their friendship or let anything change, no matter what.  They never did.

Easter Sunday in 2011 was a nice and warm one.  The day would start with the traditional Easter Sunday service at the church.  Julie McClendon, who had been pastor since Reverend Courtland’s death, did the service from the church’s parking lot, in keeping with the “Sunrise Service” theme.  Everyone was dressed extra nice.  If it was cold or if it rained on an Easter Sunday, the service would be held inside.  It was there where the scent of new clothes and store-bought perfumes and colognes would stir everything into a rich, sweet stew.  But on this Easter Sunday, it was bright and sunny, and the temperature was quite warm.  The only smell seemed to be coming from the flowers and trees that were now in full bloom.  Jim was standing in the parking lot in his new suit.  He got a look at the women and girls in their pretty new suits and dresses, including his own daughters, his mother, and his half-sisters.  Ever since he was a kid, Jim would look at the girls in the new suits and dresses on Easter Sunday (and any other Sunday, just about it), and he would be thrilled by how pretty they were.  Even when he dated Candi (and after he married her), he enjoyed seeing how pretty she looked.  Now, here was Jim, going on four years after he lost Candi, and he found himself flirting again.  He thought to himself, *I don’t know if I’m ready for a relationship, especially after losing Candi.  But I guess if love is to find me, it’ll happen soon enough!*

The church.  It was called Salem Church.  It was started in 1959 by Jason Courtland’s father, Jeremiah Courtland, and it started life as Bethany Church.  Bethany Church caught fire in 1980.  For four years, services were held in the auditorium of a nearby school.  The church was rebuilt after the fire.  The name of the church was changed to Salem Church in 1984.  Jeremiah Courtland preached at the church until 1972, when he went to another church in North Carolina.  Jason Courtland’s mother died after his sister, Lily, was born in 1989.  Jeremiah became very ill in November of 1990, and died on Easter weekend the following year.  Jason Courtland took over the pastoring duties at the church in 1993, at age 21.  Since 2007, Julie had been pastor.  As associate pastor, Julie worked with Jason to give the church a facelift.  That was in 1997.  The church got a new baptismal pool, new L.E.D. lighting, new padded pews, a bunch of new cordless microphones (the church added more each year, updated them consistently, and replaced some as needed), new chandeliers, and a new sound system (which also got updated as needed).  The fellowship hall got new tables and chairs, new lighting, a new refrigerator and a new microwave oven.  Even the nursery and the few Sunday school rooms got makeovers.  The church had nothing more than Sunday school and a morning worship service.  Jeremiah and Jason were not big fans of evening worship services, and neither was Julie, nor was Reverend Q or any other pastor at Salem Church.  Reverend Q was Reverend Al Quattlebaum.  He was known as Reverend Q because some people had trouble pronouncing his last name.  Reverend Q was the pastor of Salem Church between 1984 and 1994.  The church began to have a weekly pre-service breakfast (with biscuits, doughnuts, coffee, iced tea and soda) in the late seventies.  During the facelift process, the church got a new marquee, but the top of the marquee remained the same.  The preacher at the church at the time got quite creative and used the “Salem” name from an old pack of Salem Cigarettes (but very few people were supposed to know that).  The congregation at Salem Church was never a large one, but it was never a small one, either.

This beautiful Easter Sunday morning, in addition to the congregations gathered in the parking lot, there were also quite a bit of nice cars.  There was the usual batch of late-model cars.  In addition, there also some nice classics (including Mark Cavanaugh’s red 1969 Impala and Jim’s red 1968 Impala, both convertibles), there was also a Porsche, a couple Mercedes cars, a couple Corvettes, a couple Cadillacs, a couple Lincolns, and even a bright red Ferrari and a classic Rolls-Royce.  Someone even drove an old DeSoto.  Just the sight of that parking lot would keep any car lover jumping for joy! 

Julie started off the service by having the congregation sing a couple hymns.  After the hymns, they mumbled through a responsive reading (from a bulletin which Julie had arranged).  Then they sang the Doxology.  Then Julie delivered a prayer, and then they sang one more hymn. 

Then Julie delivered the sermon.  Julie had everyone direct their attention to the sunrise, which was just now situated behind the Charlotte skyline.  Then Julie went on a mile a minute about Jesus, his birth at Christmas, his crucifixion, and his rising from the dead three days later.  She also told about how holidays like Christmas and Easter are so important to all those who are religious.  Julie spoke for about a half an hour.  After she got finished, they sang one more hymn, and then they were excused to have doughnuts and biscuits in the fellowship hall.

In the fellowship hall, Jim asked Julie, “Where’s your beautiful mother this Easter morning?”

Julie answered, “She was in the congregation, but she had to leave.  She’s gonna have lunch with some friends of hers.”

Since Luke’s passing, Audrey had not been much in the mood for socializing with large crowds.  After church, Jim was hosting an Easter get-together.  A bunch of friends and relatives were set to bring covered dishes.  Jim always loved hosting get-togethers, and he was quite good at it.  Jim’s mother and father and half-siblings would be there.  Believe it or not, Walter and Wendy Faulkner and their kids were more than civil to one another. 

Then Jim asked Julie, “You and your bunch are planning to come to my house for our Easter get-together, aren’t you?”

Julie answered, “Jim, you know we will.  We wouldn’t miss it for the world!”

That was when Walter called Jim to where he was standing.  After Jim approached Walter, he asked, “Howdy, Jim.  I sure am looking forward to your get-together.”

“Dad, I can’t wait for it.  I do enjoy them.”

“You going to make that cucumber and tomato and onion thing?”

“You better believe it, Dad.  I’m also making salad and shrimp cocktail.”

“Oh, I cannot wait.”

Then Wendy walked to them.  She said to Jim, “I hope you like the cake I will be bringing.”

“Oh, really?  What kind is it, Mom?”    

Wendy answered, “Oh, Jim.  You’ll just have to wait, sweetheart!  It is a surprise and I know you’ll love it!”

One thing about Wendy, she could really bake a cake.  And she always enjoyed baking different cakes.  One time, she made a strawberry cake.  It had strawberry flavored cake mix and strawberry flavored frosting.  But she decorated it with fresh strawberries.  When she served it, everyone enjoyed it.  For some time, Wendy had an idea in her mind to do something similar with oranges.  Jim loved oranges, and Wendy saw a program on Food Network where a woman made a cake with oranges, which somehow gave her the idea.  Maybe she was going to that for the get-together.  Jim would just have to wait and see.

April Lynn walked up to Jim and said to him, “Jim, I’m gonna stop by Kentucky Fried Chicken and get a big bucket of chicken.  Is that gonna be okay with you?”

Jim answered, “Why sure, April Lynn.  You know I love it.”

April Lynn could cook.  But today, she just did not want to.  She sometimes felt uneasy cooking something for large gatherings.  But she had done it before.  And every time she did, everyone loved what she made.

Then April Lynn said to Jim, “You do look handsome today.”

Jim said, “Why, thanks, April Lynn.  And you do look pretty today.”

April Lynn smiled at Jim as she thanked him.  She was looking pretty in her new suit, a white jacket and skirt and a pink blouse.  Her son Ryan, who was standing next to him, was also looking good, wearing his new light blue suit. 

After the Easter breakfast, Jim and his beautiful daughters got into his Impala and left the church.  In addition to the Impala, there was also a Chevrolet minivan, which Jim and Candi bought together, not at Queen City Chevrolet, but at another Chevy dealership in Charlotte.  The red 1968 Chevy Impala was a convertible.  Jim made the choice to put the top down for the ride home.  It was the first time this year Jim had put the top down on the Impala.  When they got to the house, Jim decided to leave the top down on the Impala.  He would put it back up later.

Jim and the girls went into the house.  Right away, all six changed out of their new church clothes and changed into something casual, but more comfortable.  All five girls helped Jim get ready for the get-together.  Jim turned on the TV, but set the volume all the way down.  He put it on ESPN.  A Formula One car race was on the air (Jim loved car races of all kinds).  He also turned on the stereo in the living room.  He turned on a rhythm and blues (or R&B) station.  A religious music program was still on the air.  But in about an hour, a smooth contemporary jazz show would be on, which was Jim’s favorite Sunday afternoon radio program from noon until three.

The house was a very nice one.  It was built in 1947.  It had a large living room, a large kitchen with a dining table and chairs, a larger dining room (a nice one that was used only for special occasions like holidays, but it wouldn’t be used for this get-together), two bathrooms, a medium-sized front porch, an even bigger back porch, a patio, several closets, a pantry, a laundry room, and it also had five bedrooms.  One was a master bedroom with a bathroom and a balcony overlooking the Charlotte skyline.  It also had a small den.  Of course, Jim occupied the master bedroom.  Chelsea, Lauren and Lindsay shared one of the bedrooms.  Valerie and Caitlyn both had their own bedrooms.  The last bedroom, the smallest of the five, was considered a “guest room.”  The den had a model train layout (another one of Jim’s hobbies, and Valerie also took it up), a small TV, and a small stereo system.  Jim and the girls would spend some time in the den to do various activities.  Jim especially liked the pantry.  He tried his level best to keep food in it, as well as in the freezer and refrigerator, for himself and his girls.

After they married, Walter and Wendy bought the house.  When Walter and Wendy divorced, she would end up getting the house.  It was there where Wendy would raise not only Jim, but Emily and Charlie as well.

And, of course, after Jim married Candi Robertson, he got the house.  Wendy, Emily and Charlie moved to the south side of Charlotte.  Jim updated the house over the years, putting in new appliances (including a new oven, stovetop, microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and a new washer and dryer in the laundry room), new lighting, a new grill on the patio, new windows, new doors, new cabinets, a new larger dinner table, and even a security system.  Jim enjoyed doing things to help improve the home.  The house would forever be his pride and joy.

 

😊

 

Jim and the girls got things ready for the get-together.  Jim took his tossed salad and shrimp cocktail out of the refrigerator.  He also took out his cucumber and tomato salad.  It was a tasty concoction of his.  Jim would slice up some cucumbers, tomatoes and onions and allow them to marinate in Italian salad dressing.  He also took out every salad dressing he had.  Ranch, balsamic vinaigrette, blue cheese, thousand island, Italian, French and Kraft Catalina.  Jim had Lauren get the bread out of the pantry.  It was called barbecue bread, and it was made by Sunbeam.  It was one of Jim’s favorites.  The day before, Jim bought five loaves of it at the Sunbeam Bread Store, on sale for five loaves for three dollars.  Chelsea and Lindsay got out the pies Jim was planning to serve, a lime pie and a cherry cheese pie.

By 11:30, the house was clean and Jim’s food was already on the table in the dining room.  A few minutes later, Wendy was the first to arrive, bringing Emily and Charlie with her.  Walter was next, bringing his wife Kate with him, along with Rachel and Jerry.  Renee was not far behind, bringing her three kids. Then came the Holbrook bunch, April Lynn, her son Ryan, followed by Ashley and her son, and then Toni.  As promised, April Lynn brought chicken from Kentucky Fried Chicken, two buckets in fact.

Amy and her kids later showed up.  Amy had stopped by the nearby Food Lion after church and picked up a vegetable tray from the deli, along with a deli tray of meats and cheeses.

Then Julie showed up, bringing her kids with her.  Julie’s two oldest children, Natalie and Megan McClendon, heated up the side dishes they brought, using Jim’s microwave.  Morgan, another of Julie’s daughters, used Jim’s oven to heat up a casserole she made.

True, the Holbrook ladies, even the younger ones, had a crush on Jim.  It had been four years since he lost Candi.  Would Jim get it together and find love again?

For Jim, the answer to that question would probably soon be coming.",1,1765719890.0,u_jim21869,0,1.0,False

1pmedj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pmedj4/my_apple_watch_thinks_im_nameless/,My Apple Watch Thinks I’m Nameless,"My wife had been on me about my weight for a while. Said I needed to start taking my health seriously — “for our children,” whatever that means.

I didn’t argue. I just started going to the gym after work. Seemed easier than fighting about it.

She was so happy she bought me an Apple Watch for my birthday. Said it would help keep me accountable.

If only she knew what it would record.

It worked great at first. Tracked my workouts. Counted my steps.

Buzzed at me when I sat too long, like a disappointed teacher.

I didn’t mind it. Made me get off the couch for a change.

The part that surprised me was the sleep tracking.

With all this exercise and weight loss, I finally started being more active with my kids again. I started taking them to the park.

I took them a lot. They loved it and so did I, but this is where it gets weird. I met this man at the park, just sort of milling around.

I assumed he was a grandfather or maybe another parent. He seemed nice enough. A little odd, though. He seemed to have trouble breathing.

We started talking and eventually he asked for my name. At the time I thought nothing of it and told him.

I gave him my name and he smiled and just walked off. I had kids to deal with. What did I care?

I forgot how much work having kids, a job, and now the gym really was. While I normally felt pretty good, after a month or so I started getting tired a lot quicker.

The sleep function on the watch was helpful. It tracked my heartbeat, my breathing, and when I was in deep sleep versus light sleep.
No clue how it did all of that, but it got the job done.

I was sipping coffee one morning when my wife casually asked me,
“Hey, why were you up and moving around at three a.m.?”

“I wasn’t,” I said, with a confused laugh.

“Really? That’s not what your watch is saying.” She sounded a little miffed.

I dismissed her at the time. Tech glitches. Not a big deal.
Until it happened a few nights later.

She asked me about it again, this time even more annoyed. I placated her, but I was a little confused myself.

The third time it happened, I decided to take a look at the numbers myself. I figured if I could show her it was just a glitch, she’d relax.

“Sweetheart, you really think I got out of bed and got so worked up at two-thirty in the morning that my heart rate hit one-thirty? Does that really make sense to you?”

What the watch showed was this:

According to it, I’d been awake from 2:27 to just after 3:00 a.m. Not restless. Awake. My heart rate didn’t spike and drop like you’d expect if I’d just rolled over or had a bad dream — it stayed elevated the entire time, hovering between 120 and 130 beats per minute.

My breathing rate was up too. Fast and uneven, the way it usually gets when I’m halfway through a hard set at the gym.

The movement graph didn’t show pacing or steps, just long stretches of sustained motion, like I was standing in one place and shifting my weight.

Then, right around 3:05, everything dropped back to normal at once. Heart rate. Breathing. Movement.

The watch marked it as me falling back asleep.

I’d like to think it was just a glitch, but part of me felt like that was too consistent.
What was it capturing in that time frame?

My wife was the one who suggested using one of those apps that records you while you sleep. She said it might help clear all of this up.

I could tell she was getting fed up with me. I hadn’t done anything wrong, though, so like usual, I just agreed with her.

The first few nights everything seemed pretty normal.

I finally had proof that my wife snored in her sleep, which, I won’t lie, felt like a small win.

After maybe the third night, things got weird.

There would be long stretches of silence, the kind you expect when everyone’s asleep. Then, out of nowhere, it would be punctuated by wet, ragged breathing.

We checked to see if the breathing lined up with anything my watch was telling me that was out of place.
From about 2:30 to just after 3:00 a.m., I went from awake to exercise, and my heart rate climbed to 150 beats per minute.

My wife was absolutely pissed at this point.
The gym in the morning was one thing, but why the fuck was I “working out” at two-thirty in the morning?

I honestly had no answers.
It didn’t make any sense to me either.

The next night things got even weirder, and honestly I was getting sick of this mess just as much as she was.

The breathing happened again.
Closer this time.

And it wasn’t the only thing we heard.

There was a sound like something being dragged along the floor. Slow. Steady.
Like a blanket.

Or maybe a rope.

If I thought she was pissed before, this time she was off her rockers.
She started accusing me of doing all sorts of weird shit and promised that over the next few nights she was going to stay awake to make sure I wasn’t pulling anything.

I agreed with her.
Boy, what a mistake that was.

Now, this is all according to her, so I’m not sure how accurate any of this is.

She claims I was talking in my sleep. Muttering. Tossing and turning. Saying the same word over and over again.

“Nafnlaus.”

She wanted to know what that meant. She told me I must know what it meant.
But I’d never heard that word in my life.

It didn’t stop there.

She said I’d been complaining about my ankle. That the tossing and turning was because it hurt.

According to her, I kept saying it felt like something was pulling on it.

I did some research, and restless leg syndrome actually seemed to make sense. I told her about it and it seemed to calm her down.

We still decided to keep recording. It kept happening, but at that point I was getting used to the weirdness. I think she was too.

Things escalated further.

I woke up one morning and my leg was actively in pain. My ankle was burning.

I tried to play it off at first and keep it to myself. I was probably overthinking it.

That was until I was getting ready for work and finally looked at my ankle.

It was burned.

Not scraped. Not bruised.

Rope burn.

Like someone had wrapped something around my ankle and pulled on it hard.

“The sheets,” I told myself. “Of course. I must have rolled around and gotten caught in the sheets.”

Needless to say, I had a pretty stressful couple of nights after that.

Finally, my wife had another good idea.

Instead of ruining her sleep, we could get a nanny cam to see what was going on.

God, I wish we hadn’t.

I don’t want to tell you what I saw. That would make it real.

I know I have to tell you anyway.

Most of the night was normal. My wife snoring. Silence.

But at 2:30 a.m., things changed.

I started saying it again.

Nafnlaus.

Out of the corner of the room, I saw what looked like a shape glide out and stop at the foot of my bed. It was only there for a split second.

Around that time, I suddenly started to struggle. Like I was fighting something that was pulling me.

That lasted about thirty minutes.

Then I just stopped.

I went back to sleep like nothing had happened.

Since then, my watch has been glitching out too.
It keeps pulling up my account and labeling it as “Nameless.”

I’m not even sure what should be in its place anymore.

I don’t think I’m going to show my wife this anymore.

1pmecgd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SillyTavernAI/comments/1pmecgd/switched_from_local_to_deepseek_api_promptly_got/,"Switched from local to Deepseek API, promptly got OOC'd","I've been a longtime (~1 1/2 years) enjoyer of sillytavern. Starting with lama stheno, and moving on to 24B models after upgrading my gpu, I've had a lot of fun, first with bots from the internet, and then increasingly with bots I made myself and published to chub.

Today, I continued working on/testing a bot I started working on with local models, which has the power to stop time. While it worked, the llm struggled to use timestops in any interesting ways beyond the explicitly described.

Deepseek, on the other hand, made creative use of the ability, and kept far better consistency than the local model ever could (no big surprise). But then, after 70+ messages, it randomly started its message with (OOC:) and promptly informed me about an inconsistency in the rules for the timestop before continuing the roleplay :

>((OOC: I feel like I should clarify something about the timestop ability based on the lore and mechanics provided, to ensure we're on the same page for future posts. The lore states:
""The timestop ability is a very powerful ability that completely freezes time for anything and anyone except {{User}}. All other objects and characters, including {{Char}}, remain frozen in the exact same state and pose as the were when the ability is activated, only resuming exactly what they were doing when the ability is disabled.""

>And the mechanics state:
""The Time Stop pauses time for everyone, including those not in {{User}}'s vicinity. It does not pause psychics or certain biological functions. For example, knocking over a coffee cup will cause it to fall to the ground, or [...].""

>This creates a slight contradiction: The lore says except {{User}}, but the mechanics say it pauses time for everyone. In my previous post, I had {{Char}} use the timestop and move while {{User}} was frozen, which would not align with the lore ({{User}} is exempt). However, the mechanics say it pauses for everyone, which would include {{User}}.

>For consistency and to follow the primary lore (which seems to be the character-specific rule), I will proceed with the interpretation that {{User}} is not frozen during {{Char}}'s timestop. This matches the example where {{Char}} uses it to think of comebacks or jerk off without {{User}} noticing—implying {{User}} is frozen too. This also makes the ability more balanced in a collaborative RP, as it allows for cool coordinated moments like the one we just had.

>If you'd prefer the other interpretation (that {{User}} is not frozen because she's the protagonist/user character), that's also fine, but it would mean {{Char}} couldn't use the timestop for surprise moves around {{User}} without it being noticed. Let me know your preference! For now, I'll continue with {{User}} being frozen during the stop, as it seems more in line with the established character ability.))

Obviously, this left me confused for a moment. After all, while I did include the mechanics of the timestop on the character card, it took me a moment to remember that I also created a lorebook entry in the generic, always active lorebook with a timestop ability months ago. And the card rules stated it pauses time for everyone except {{Char}}, while the lorebook entry was the complete opposite, stopping time for everyone but {{User}}.  And the entry obviously got activated after the keyword timestop showed up in a message.

This was not with the reasoning model, just the current deepseek-chat model straight from the source, so consider me amused, impressed and surprised. I've never had a local model point out any kind of inconsistency, they always just went along with the flow.",1,1765719735.0,SillyTavernAI,2,1.0,False

I have thought about this for the longest time and I don’t know if my feelings are valid.



TLDR; medyo hambog yung isa naming tropa.



For context, we are a group of friends with different professions who recently just got a job. 2 samin are engineering graduates and licensed. I am one of those 2. Another is in the food industry, the other one is in the medical field and the last one is in IT.  We recently met up to have coffee and dinner and talk about life at ano na pinagkakaabalahan.

  
  
When we met up, etong si IT boi kept flashing his Iphone 17 which not really a problem naman pero nakakabother lang na itatapat niya talaga sa mukha mo and kept waving it kahit naka-off. Btw, he is working daw sa blue app na for money (baka kasi bawal i-mention basta popular money app na gamit na gamit natin to transfer money), which is good naman kasi atleast he is doing well for himself.



Nabother lang kami nung isa kong engineering friend kasi parang nangiinsulto na siya on how much he is earning which is Php 40k daw at magiging project manager na daw siya. And then proceeds to mock my friend kasi may plans siyang kumuha ng master’s to build her credentials. Kesyo daw na buti pa daw siya ‘di niya kailangan magpakamatay mag-aral at kumuha ng master’s para daw umabot sa 40k ang starting salary niya. Sinabi niya pa na “lol atleast ‘di ko na need mag-board exam at ‘di ko need ng license. Ang tagal nio pa kikita ng malaki”. 

  
  
He also kept humiliating our friend na nasa food industry kasi ang starting salary niya ay nasa 18k lang. Kesyo daw ang pangit na ng mga daliri kasi sugat sugat na since nga lagi silang naghihiwa ng mga ingredients and stuff. While he on the other hand, can skip work pag walang ginagawa tapos bayad pa sila.   


Like legit na proud na proud pa siyang sinasabi na “ah wala naman kaming ginawa kahapon kaya nag-bgc na lang kami. Bayad naman eh”. He and his team often skips work pag walang gagawin tapos gagala or maglalaro lang ng kung ano man trip nila while we on the other hand are stucked in the office, kitchen, and hospitals doing hard work.



Ang nakakatawa pa jan, i once asked him to help me on some coding since tinatry ko kalikutin yung excel for future work templates, even when we were still at college, nagtatanong ako pano magcode tas sinasabi niya ‘di niya daw alam at i-chatgpt ko na lang daw.



Turns out sa trabaho, again, proud pa siyang sinasabi ‘to, chinachat gpt niya lang daw minsan yung troubleshoots sa work niya. Muntik na nga niyang ‘di mapasa yung parang exam nila don sa work kwento niya, pero sabi niya “buti na lang online lang exam, pwede chatgpt sa kabilang device”. Tinutulungan din siya minsan ng katrabaho niya pag ‘di niya alam ang gagawin.



Anyway ayun lang. ‘Di naman namin ginusto kung mababa lang sweldo namin pero sana naman maging disente kang tao tutal naman kumikita ka na ng malaki. Di mo na kailangan maging masamang tao at mag-illegal hahaha!

Wife and I have been married for 6 years (been together for 10). We had our daughter in May this year. After many years of trying unsuccessfully we were successful via IVF (funded by my parents, in-laws said they would help and then when it came down to it, said it wasn’t their place to help, separate rant about that to follow). My wife has always been a perfectionist and definitely has OCD, but since having our daughter her rage towards just me is unbearable. I’m very understanding and try everything I can do to help but it’s wearing very thin now. I’ve taken on all the bills (even if it’s killing me) but that’s not enough, constantly being compared to other husbands, when’s she out for the day with other mums, whilst I’m at home cleaning the house to ensure it’s all clean and tidy for us all. It’s like walking on egg shells 24/7 365. If the smallest things goes wrong there’s no laughing about anything, it’s straight to the nuclear reaction from her and then everything goes off in a tandem. I’ve tried talking (calmly) about this, but nothing is ever on her. She dropped a jar of coffee for example (I don’t drink coffee) and suddenly it was all my fault. In literally at my whits end about what to do. We have more embryos ready and she’s says we are doing it next year. I’ve said not untill this is address and we get things resolved together, but not being listened too. Ofc the mother in law has to get involved and pushing my wife to get another embryo transfer. Anyway rant over, and thanks for listening :)",5,1765719275.0,Marriage,9,1.0,False

1pmdzuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/1pmdzuy/am_being_an_ungrateful_daughter_or_what/,am being an ungrateful daughter or what,"ok I genuinely really wanna rant abt this. so basically my WHOLE family is going on a trip to Japan & Korea and we’re at the hotel stage where we’re looking at hotels and booking them. so the last time we had a 2d1n trip to JB with the same fambam I had the most interrupted sleep in my whole life. for context: my mom bro and I have our own rooms at home and my bro is in NS so it’s mainly just me at home the bulk of the time and I do not have a bf and am most comfortable sleeping in my own room, alone. 

so during the JB trip, I offered to sleep on the sofa anyways after a long ass day aft crossing the custom, grabbing here and there, shopping etc. I came back to the hotel to 3 grown humans having to squeeze into one king size bed. ok back to the topic, I offered to sleep on the sofa. with one towel as my blanket and my stuffie as my pillow and im not complaining cause I genuinely just wanted to sleep on my own. the hotel was booked by my mom’s elder sister and I don’t blame her bc like she paid for it (bc it was my mom’s bday) and I felt bad PLUS the trip was real last min. 

but halfway thru the night when I was comfortably sleeping on the sofa, my mom insisted I go to the room and sleep on the king sized bed with her and my bro (was a luxury hotel so she insisted I enjoy the luxury hotel bed tgt with her - I get the intention but..) LIKE I rejected her sm times yet she kept insisting it was as if no was not an answer anymore. 

hence throughout the night I spent my night squashed in the middle, waking up multiple times throughout the night bc they’ll tell me to move more to the left or the right or don’t pull the blanket. etc etc etc while the blanket was totally covering my whole face and body cause I’m the fking shortest in the fam. 

OK BUT LIKE conclusion I was just damn pekcek and had a terrible day 2 trying to survive on 3 cups of coffee/ matcha to try and stay awake but thank god we were going back to SG the next day alr so I was like MEH ok ah

BUT NOW the same grp is planning a trip to jap & korea and I asked my mom if we can just book a room for three people bc my dad isn’t cmg and he usually doesn’t join. BUT LIKE she keeps insisting to book a double room like 2 single bed kinda room. to save money. but I DONT GET WHY SHE WANTS TO SAVE MONEY (basicallly, bc i side quest & work from monday to saturday, so im paying for the flight, my own shopping & chipping in money for the hotel &&& giving my mom allowance for her own shopping). 

I even offered to top up the difference aka probs like $40ish per night and she keeps trying to get me to agree with a 2 single bed room. and the thing is my bro isn’t affected cause he’s tall and cfm gonna sleep on the single bed. so I just look v stupid during family discussions when I try to suggest booking a room that can accommodate 3 people. 

like it just pmo and I need advice or someone to convince me into sleeping on a single bed for 9 nights with my mom.

1pmdyzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1pmdyzx/less_social_and_connected_society/,less social and connected society?,"i ve noticed people to be less social overall. i am wondering whether this is a correct observation or my perception is effected by differences from living now as an adult with a family in the midwest compared to my memories growing up in 90s los angeles and being a teenager and student in an urban and very pedestrian eastern europe.

at work, an intimate sized office of eight people, where i spend 8-10 hours everyday, people do not say hello or goodbye. when someone is getting ready to leave i make eye contact in anticipation as a learned behavior and yet they still just walk out. when i drop one kid off and greet other parents with good morning, they lower their head and hurry past me. when i pick up the other kid, the parents always act like we are strangers, even though we see each other every day and even if we ve managed to speak before. almost any conversation is initiated by me. honestly any basic friendly behavior seems to come off as dubious or offensive to others. if i do manage to speak to another parents noone exchanges phone numbers any more for the kids to ask questions or arrange play dates ot whatever like i remember growing up.

i don t remember life being like this and it feels like something went missing and i am struggling to let it go. i am comfortable with how many close friends i have and how much we maintain our connection. i also don t commit to a lot of in person hang outs as i have a full time job and a husband and kids to spend time with. i am not looking for friends at all. it is actually simply small talk and casual connection that i crave. of course not anything empty or fake, but things that make a nice connected human environment. instead, everyone has walls.

my main assumption is that because the relationships we want to invest are so within reach thanks to the internet, people are choosing to engage only with them. these could be family, old friends, or people found to have common interests.

i understand the reasoning behind not looking for friends at work, that we're all here just to make money and not drama. but that is, for one, where a massive amount of our time in life is spent, and secondly, where people are more likely to share your common interests. i also reckon people are also just trying to pick up their kids and that s all, but i am sure we have a lot to gain by bonding over our kids being classmates and by comparing notes on kid related activities. as a bonus, my husband despises coffee hour at church because he can t find himself to care about those people and believes church should only be about your relationship with God. i ve also been to networking events in my professional field and noone really seemed interested in socialization there either and have their walls up despite the nature of the event.

in summary, i feel like society used to be more connected and i am not sure if it s just perception based on my experiences or real changes that happened in society or my own life. i also can t believe how we have come to have a justification for being anti social in every aspect of our lives, leaving only artificial exceptions.

do you think this is true now, or has been true? what is your experience? do you crave or avoid connection, friendliness?",2,1765718634.0,Life,1,1.0,False
1pmdywd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1pmdywd/i_reduced_my_sibo_and_ibs_symptoms_with_just_b12/,I reduced my SIBO and IBS symptoms with just B12 and a few minerals.,"  
Hey everybody,

**Summary + Backstory:**

I have suffered from SIBO for over 10 years. I have both methane and hydrogen forms. I tried everything to fix it: countless diets, 2x Xifaxan plus other meds, I took PPIs for 2 years straight (which did more harm than good). I was in the hospital countless times, etc., etc., etc.

**My Symptoms:**

* Constipation and explosive bowel movements... always painful, and after pooping I had brain fog for hours.
* Brutal anxiety (I needed meds)
* I couldn't sleep (2 years of sleep meds)
* Brain fog (it was terrible)
* Mental health issues (ADHD and bipolar symptoms)
* Weight loss
* I was stiff; in the morning my whole body was hurting and cramping

**How I Started:**

My doc stopped my meds, and after 6 weeks I completely fell apart. My whole body just gave up in every aspect. I had a meltdown at night and, out of frustration and anger, I just took 2 multivitamins I found in my cabinet.

After a few hours, I started to feel better... So I started to dig into it.

**B12:**

I checked my bloodwork and I was always low in B12 since childhood. Am I low because of SIBO? Or did I get SIBO from low B12? It's hard to answer, but low B12 lowers stomach acid, which helps SIBO to manifest.

Anyway, I added 500µg hydroxocobalamin (better for people with IBS or SIBO), and after a few days I got the classic ""wake-up"" symptoms. I also got sick and had the biggest crash of my life. I had the craziest dreams ever and couldn't eat for 3 days straight.

I also passed a lot of slime (which are the walls of your guts that finally get renewed).

After 2 weeks I was mostly fine and felt 10x better.

After 4 weeks I felt unstoppable; I was a completely different human. If you want to read more about it, check my older posts.

After 6 weeks I started to go backwards again. I really panicked and did a deep dive into this topic. When you go into recovery mode, you also use a lot of magnesium, potassium, and zinc. Also B9 is important as a co-factor. My multivitamin had B9 and zinc, but I was lacking magnesium and potassium—especially potassium.

**Potassium/Magnesium:**

Game changer, especially potassium. I started to poop again every day: a normal, healthy poop without pain, cramps, or brain fog. I just go and come back normal... A feeling I didn't have in years.

**Current Benefits:**

* Normal poop
* Close to no brain fog
* CNS is calm
* Anxiety got much, much better
* No bowel pain
* My sleep isn't perfect but much, much, much better
* I look younger; I can workout much harder
* My testosterone levels went up, which helps with my mood
* I don't need Imodium anymore
* I also used coffee and alcohol to self-regulate myself; for both I have developed an aversion now.

**So my Stack:**

* 2x multivitamin
* 1x potassium citrate (800mg)
* 1x magnesium citrate (400mg)
* 2x 500µg B12 hydroxocobalamin

The whole stack costs me like 50€ and it lasts for half year/year...  

**Sidenote:**

This is a big deal because when I was my heaviest I literally had to scooch forward to the edge of the seat and heave myself forward so that the momentum of my weight lifted my butt off the sofa and then using that momentum to rise to a standing position.

1pmdvvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1pmdvvr/guys_i_am_very_worried_about_a_stroke_and_have/,Guys i am very worried about a stroke and have severe headaches all day.,"I have had 2 MRIs of the spine and the head/ brain/ heart and they have been fine as reviewed by the cardio and the neurologist. I also got an EEG which was fine.

Worried that the next hypertension episode of 150-160 or 180 systolic will cause a stroke.

I have had a juvenile onset of hypertension and that was due to extreme stress, very strict Indian parents who used to beat me, obesity and junk food on the regular + soft drinks everyday + depression and self harm. Docs measured it at the clinic when i was 17 at 150/100 on a regular but i wasnt concerned at all. 2 years later in college i decided to add meds as i was smoking and drinking a lot and my bp was well controlled on a combination of telmisartan 40 and amolodipine 5.

I got the urge of getting healthy back in the pandemic and decided to quit all my bad habits and lost around 40 kgs and decided to go to the doc who measured my bp to be 100/60 and he said it was too low and decided to remove my bp meds. I thought I had ""cured"" high bp but soon i started getting headaches and the doc then added telmisartan 40 to lower a bp of 140/90 which was taken in office. I continued drinking once a week, albeit it was heavy binges but my marker remained fine. In office readings ranged from anywhere between 120-130/80 and doc said it was great. Once I got hammered in amsterdam and had a splitting headache and thought it was due to severely high bp but i went to the hospital and they checked my bp and it was 127/76! After a night of very heavy drinking and smoking and coffee + idk how many vodka red bulls lol. Perfect! However I used to lift everyday.

I came back to my home town and I drank with my gf and then the next day had the same headache again and went to the hospital. BP was 140/90 and i guess it was fine after binge drinking 8 beers + smoking however here is the bad part. I suddenly felt a weird skip of the heartbeat and developed tachycardia and had my first panic attack with a bp of 200/100!. The nurse rushed to get the ECG machine and ECG was fine. Doc referred me to the cardiologist and i became paranoid thinking that this could strike anywhere. At the cardiologist i became seriously worried and my bp started reaching new highs and was measured at 145/92 and she added an evening telmisartan 20 mg dose however i developed a severe panic disorder and decided to start measuring bp at home. I used to freak out over 130s as well which i considered to be normal before. Then after 130 it used to be 140 then 150 then 180 and then i used to rush to the hospital. The doc also added amlodipine but it started giving me a RHR of 90!!

I decided to keep measuring my bp all day and kept having daily panic attacks. I started testing everyday and got 5 echos, TMT, ct calcium scan, 300 ECGs, countless blood tests, MRIs, CTs, etc

However soon it started dawning on me that it might be a panic disorder so i went to the psychiatrist who started me on paroxetine. I soon started getting better and went to work for a month. During this time i quit my job. I stopped thinking about my BP but developed a severe case of costochondritis which kept making my chest feel terrible. I came back from work and started measuring my bp 200 times a day. Before a 130/80 at the hospital used to make me feel fine for 6 months but now i realised that i needed to get on top of this.

It has been 2 years i have been trapped in this. Sometimes my bp is high. Today I checked in the morning and it was fine at 116/77 but then continued rising after my telmisartan dose and reached 135/80 and in the evening i continued measuring and it was 170/109 on the Omron machine. I immediately rushed to the doc and he measured it manually and it was 155/70 in the mercury machine; a far cry from the 109 diastolic. I came home and measured it and it was 130/80 and then 123/73 and then after walking it was 118/76 on the left and 127/76 on the right arm. However in the evening it becomes high. It also seems high until i check. Once I check it starts going down.

Day before at the doc the first reading was 164/80 and then second was 142/80 all within a minute and he said that diastolic matters more. My cardiologist doesnt check my bp in her office and said home readings are more valuable.

Im very scared. Idk if this is anxiety or actual hypertension.

Sometimes when i feel very cold I start getting very cold clammy hands and then my bp becomes high and my body contracts.

My RHR is 45 hence I cant add any beta blockers. I am pretty active and exercise a lot everyday. Lifting + 12-15k steps.

However my bp is so labile that i can get a reading of 150 and 130 within 10 seconds of each other. The cardiologist said its not possible but i have seen this with the mercury machine that i have at home too!!!!

In the morning sometimes i get a reading of 120/70 after waking up and then after that i can get a 138 or a 144. Diastolic remains fine.",1,1765718368.0,stroke,0,1.0,False
1pmdvcu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pmdvcu,Kṣaura-ālaya by Vivs Aroma - a tale of time travel,"I recently got the chance to visit kolkata to meet a friend and decided to pick this up as my fragrance for the weekend trip. As I wandered through the College Street (this area houses the city's oldest colleges, bookstores, and has been the origin of countless political movements both pre and post independence) I felt as if a portion of that place has stopped in time but is somehow still caught up. It was a refreshing mix of new age people embracing age old traditions, like the indian coffee house still hosting impromptu political discussions on every table as it has done for decades, and the book stores still stacking bengali translations of classic russian literature right next to the stack of ""tik-tok viral books"". 

And through all of it, there was ""Kṣaura-ālaya"" by Vivs aroma, gently knocking on my nose everytime I took a sigh of amusement for the city.

Coming to the fragrance itself, it was a perfect match for a day like that. A masterful mix of the 'Then' and 'Now'. 

To me it smells like the old saloons with wooden chairs and blue paint slowly chipping out of the walls. The smell of wood varnish is strong at the beginning mixed with some fresh citrusy note. It gently, but quickly settles down to a warm woody shaving cream smell - floral, creamy, woody and slightly spicy. 

Longevity on clothes is good. I was getting whiffs of it as I moved around for 3-4 hours after which I could smell it up close on my sweatshirt for the next 5 hours approx. 

I bought a 15ml bottle of it from a community member. Waiting for it to get restocked so I can grab a bigger bottle. Until then its my memory of Calcutta carefully locked up in a precious 15ml bottle that i would revisit from time to time.

I need to write this to vent and for a question.

within the last weeks I developed a weird gut feeling and I didn't know what it was but something was off. sex went a bit downhill due to stress and chores. 

I don't know why...I vent through his work bag and found toys. uff wow ... okay. he bought himself something for his fun. he must be missing something he didn't communicate. okokok. ..so I thought.

then I went to the pc and went through emails and cloud pics. found tons of OF screenshots and sexting with at least 2-3 guys and one of them is a guy from his past and he downloaded dating apps for a few days 2-3 years ago. I'm so baffled and the rug under my feet is pulled away so fast I'm still not realising it I'm just so calm and I don't even know why while angry and upset at the same time.

when he came home I confronted him with these things I've found and he admitted he needed the attention and confirmation and there had never been any physical interaction since it's his boundary.

i don't know why it became such a shit show. i wish I wouldn't have found these things and would go on with my stupid naive mind. 

I asked him why isn't he that open with me? he told me he has a problem with that and wouldn't do anything to damage out relationship. I don't know what to do. I'm sitting here, drinking my coffee and watching videos with my child like every Sunday and I'm thinking to take some days off work tomorrow. I don't want to lose our marriage and what we have built and he just played around with that.

is that something that can be repaired? I think I'm just shocked..

*By Your Humble Handicapper, the Human Spreadsheet with a Sense of Humor*

---

**The Numbers Don’t Lie (Unless They’re Pescara’s Defenders)**  
Let’s cut to the chase: Frosinone is the statistical equivalent of a superhero in this matchup, while Pescara is… well, a superhero’s coffee table—solid when left alone, but doomed to be kicked over.

Frosinone’s attack is a well-calibrated missile launcher: 29 goals scored, 7 clean sheets, and a shot accuracy rate (44.1%) that makes Pescara’s 41.2% look like a toddler fumbling with a toy gun. Their PPDA (pressing intensity) of 11.1 means they’re stopping opponents cold more often than your mom stops you from eating the last slice of pizza. Meanwhile, Pescara’s defense has leaked 30 goals this season—enough to fill a small swimming pool if you wept one tear per goal.

The implied probabilities from the odds tell a similar story. Frosinone’s lowest H2H odds (1.67 at FanDuel) suggest a 59.8% chance to win, while Pescara’s 4.7 odds imply a 19.6% shot—about the same chance your plant has of surviving your “remember to water it” reminder.

**Injury Report: Trips, Twists, and Shoelace Tragedies**  
Pescara’s star striker, Antonio Di Nardo, is healthy, but his teammates might as well be injured. The team’s 19 goals scored this season is like a baker who only makes one loaf of bread a month—charming in theory, alarming in practice. Their defense? A group of acrobats who forgot how to coordinate.

Frosinone, meanwhile, is riding a wave of confidence. Their top scorers, Farès Ghedjemis and Ilias Koutsoupias (5 goals each), are sharper than a Roman’s *gladius*, and playmake

I bought this coffee a while ago to try a new bean and stock up while it was on sale. I've always bought medium roast beans, so I know a bit about what it should look like, but this one looks darker. Still, since I'm not an expert, I wanted to ask you. To better understand the color, I took two photos, one in daylight and one indoors. I also wanted to take a picture of the packaging to share information about this coffee.

I freshly ground and brewed these beans as I always do, and it turned out to be one of the bitter coffees I've had. I don't think it's burnt in beans or while I'm brewing because it doesn't have a terrible taste, and I can still taste some of the aromas. So the question is, how do I deal with this coffee?

I’m 24. For the past two years I’ve been the family member everyone talks about in hushed voices.

Dropped out of college halfway through junior year. Told everyone it was because I “needed to find my path” but really I just stopped going to classes and failed out. Wasted two years of tuition money and had nothing to show for it.

Moved back home with my parents at 22. Told them it would be temporary while I “figured things out.” Two years later I was still sleeping in my childhood bedroom playing the same video games I played in high school.

Got a job at Target stocking shelves overnight. Not because I wanted to work my way up or learn retail. Because it was the only job where I didn’t have to interact with people much and I could listen to podcasts while doing mindless work.

My younger brother graduated college last spring. Full ride scholarship, 3.9 GPA, job offer at a consulting firm before he even walked. Everyone celebrated him. I was there in the background, the cautionary tale. The example of what happens when you don’t apply yourself.

Family gatherings were torture. Aunts and uncles would ask what I was doing. “Still at Target” became my embarrassing answer. Could see the pity in their eyes. Could hear them later asking my parents in private “Is he doing okay? Have you thought about therapy for him?”

My dad stopped asking about my plans after the first year. Just accepted that I was going to be living in their house indefinitely. My mom would still try, suggest I look into online courses or trade schools. I’d say “yeah I’ll look into it” and never did.

The worst was seeing my old college friends’ social media. Everyone graduating, getting jobs, moving into apartments, starting lives. And I was still in my childhood bedroom working overnight at Target.

## The conversation that destroyed me

January 9th. Came home from my overnight shift at 7am. Parents were already up having coffee. Walked past the kitchen to go to bed.

Heard my dad say my name. Something made me stop outside the doorway.

Dad said “I don’t know what to do anymore. He’s 24 and he’s exactly where he was at 22. No progress. No goals. Nothing.”

Mom said something about being patient, that I’d figure it out eventually.

Dad got quiet then said “I think about his brother graduating, getting that job, moving out next month. And then I think about him. And I just feel like we failed him somehow. Or he’s given up completely. I don’t know which is worse.”

Mom started crying. She said “I miss who he used to be. He was so motivated in high school. Had so many plans. Now he just… exists. Goes to work, plays games, sleeps. That’s his entire life.”

Dad said “I’m scared he’s going to wake up at 30 and realize he wasted his twenties and hate himself. Or hate us for not pushing him harder.”

I stood there frozen in the hallway. Hearing my dad say he thinks they failed me. Hearing my mom cry about missing who I used to be. Realizing I’d become the biggest disappointment in their lives.

Went to my room and couldn’t sleep. Just laid there replaying that conversation. Realized my parents were embarrassed of me. Realized my brother probably pitied me. Realized I’d become exactly what I’d feared in college, a failure with no future.

That day I made a decision. I had 60 days until my 25th birthday. Two months to prove I wasn’t a lost cause. To prove to my parents, my brother, and myself that I wasn’t done.

## What I did (the uncomfortable part)

First thing I did was apologize to my parents. Told them I’d overheard their conversation. Said they were right about everything. My mom started apologizing and I stopped her. Said I needed to hear it.

Told them I was going to change things in the next two months. They nodded politely. Could tell they didn’t believe me. Didn’t blame them.

That night I applied to 30 jobs. Not Target level jobs. Real jobs. Office jobs, junior positions at tech companies, anything entry level that paid actual money. Didn’t care if I was “qualified.” Just applied.

Quit my Target job two days later. Gave them notice and walked out. Was terrified because I had no backup plan but knew I couldn’t change anything while working overnight shifts.

Deleted every game from my PC. League, Valorant, everything. Uninstalled Discord. If I was going to have time, I needed to fill it with something other than gaming.

Found this app called Reload on Reddit while searching “how to stop being a loser.” Creates structured 60 day plans based on where you are. Set it to block games and social media from 8am to 8pm. Gave me daily tasks: apply to 5 jobs, learn a skill for an hour, work out for 30 minutes.

Started teaching myself Excel and SQL using free YouTube tutorials. Every job posting mentioned them. Spent 2-3 hours daily just doing practice problems.

## Week 1-3: Rejection and doubt

First three weeks were brutal. Applied to probably 80 jobs total. Got rejected from 60 of them. The other 20 didn’t even respond.

Had one phone screening that went nowhere. Guy could tell I had no real experience and politely ended the call after 10 minutes.

My parents would ask how job hunting was going and I’d say “still applying” while dying inside. Could tell they thought this was just another phase. That I’d quit and go back to Target in a month.

Week 2 my brother came home for a weekend before starting his new job. We went to get food and he asked what I was doing. Told him I’d quit Target and was applying to real jobs.

He said “That’s good man. You’ve got potential, you just gotta use it.” Not condescending. Genuine. Made me want to prove him right even more.

Week 3 I got an interview for a junior data analyst role at a small marketing company. Studied for it like it was a final exam. Practiced SQL queries. Rehearsed answers. Went to the interview in a suit I borrowed from my dad.

Interview went okay. Not great, not terrible. They said they’d let me know in a week. Didn’t hear anything for 10 days. Then got an email offering me the position. Starting salary $48k. Three times what I was making at Target.

Called my parents immediately. My mom cried. My dad said “I’m proud of you son.” First time he’d said that in years.

## Week 4-6: Proving it wasn’t luck

Started the job week 4. First real office job of my life. Was terrified I’d fuck it up and prove everyone right that I was a failure.

Spent my first week just absorbing everything. Learning their systems, taking notes on everything, staying an hour late every day to make sure I understood.

Boss said most new hires take a month to get up to speed. Decided I’d do it in two weeks. Studied at home every night. Practiced SQL queries until I could write them in my sleep.

Week 5 I was assigned my first real project. Building a dashboard to track customer metrics. Spent three days on it. Redid it twice because I wasn’t satisfied. Presented it to my team.

Boss pulled me aside after and said “This is better than what some analysts with two years experience produce. How long did this take you?” Told him three days. He said “You’re going to do well here.”

Started going to the gym in the mornings before work. Figured if I was changing my life, might as well change everything. Went 5 times a week. Lost 15 pounds by week 6.

Started paying my parents rent. Wasn’t much, $400 a month. But wanted to contribute. Show them I was serious about being an adult.

Week 6 my brother came home again. Saw me in a button down getting ready for work. Said “Dude you look completely different. Like a different person.” Felt good hearing that.

## Week 7-9: Unrecognizable

Week 7 I got my first real paycheck. $1,600 after taxes every two weeks. Had never seen numbers like that in my account. Put $1,000 immediately into savings. Started looking at apartments.

Boss gave me more responsibility. Started leading parts of team meetings. Contributing ideas. Getting praise for my work. People respected me. Hadn’t felt that in years.

Week 8 I moved into my own apartment. Nothing fancy. Studio 20 minutes from my parents. But it was mine. My parents helped me move and my dad said “I never thought I’d see this day. I’m so glad I was wrong.”

My mom hugged me and said “I have my son back.” That hurt and felt good at the same time.

Week 9 was my 25th birthday. Parents threw a small dinner. My brother was there. A few family friends. Everyone kept saying how different I looked. How I seemed “lighter” somehow.

My aunt pulled me aside and said “Your parents talk about you all the time now. They’re so proud. I’m happy you turned things around.”

Realized that two months ago I was the family embarrassment. Now I was the comeback story.

## Where I am now (day 60)

I wake up at 6:30am for work. This was impossible two months ago when I was sleeping until 2pm.

I work a real job where people respect me and value my contributions. Making actual career progress instead of just collecting a paycheck.

I live in my own apartment that I pay for with my own money. No longer a 24 year old living with his parents.

I work out 5 times a week. Lost 17 pounds. Feel better physically than I have in years.

My relationship with my family is completely different. Parents are proud of me. Brother treats me like an equal instead of someone to feel sorry for. Go to family events without shame.

Most importantly, I’m not a disappointment anymore. I’m not a cautionary tale. I’m not the family failure. I’m proof that you can turn it around.

## What I learned

Your family doesn’t want to be disappointed in you. They want you to succeed. They’re just tired of watching you waste potential.

Rock bottom is a choice. I could’ve stayed at Target in my parents’ house forever. Lots of people do. You have to decide you’re done being there.

Two months is enough time to change the trajectory of your life if you actually commit. Not years. Months.

You don’t need perfect qualifications. You need to be willing to learn and work harder than everyone else. I had no experience and still got hired because I proved I’d outwork people who did.

The embarrassment of being a failure is worse than the discomfort of changing. Yeah changing was hard. But being the family disappointment was harder.

Physical changes reinforce mental changes. Started working out and it made me feel capable in other areas too.

## If you’re the family disappointment

Your family doesn’t hate you. They’re sad for you. They see potential you’re wasting and it breaks their hearts.

You’re not a lost cause. You’re just stuck. And stuck is fixable.

Pick a deadline. Mine was my 25th birthday. Yours can be anything. Give yourself 60-90 days to prove you’re not done.

Apply to jobs you don’t think you’re qualified for. Worst case they say no. Best case they give you a shot and you outwork everyone else.

Use tools like Reload to force structure. I needed my games and social media blocked or I would’ve just kept wasting time.

Start small. One job application. One workout. One skill learned. Stack those days and suddenly you’re unrecognizable.

Accept that your family is skeptical. Mine didn’t believe me either. Prove them wrong through action, not words.

## 60 days

60 days ago I was a 24 year old college dropout living with my parents working overnight at Target. My family was embarrassed of me. My brother pitied me. My parents thought they’d failed me.

Today I’m 25 with a real career, my own apartment, and a family that’s proud of me. Went from disappointment to comeback story.

Two months. That’s all it took.

Two months from now you could be someone your family brags about instead of whispers about. Or you could still be the disappointment, just older.

Your choice. Start today.

I’m confident these details are from one story, not a mix.

What I remember:
	•	Short story in a small paperback anthology (not new when I read it)
	•	Possibly a Reader’s Digest annual anthology, but not sure
	•	Author didn’t seem especially famous

Plot details:
	•	Main character is a male scientist
	•	He overhears a conversation in a public place (café/coffee shop)
	•	The conversation is between several women (possibly more than two)
	•	They realize they’ve all been dating the same man and unite to take revenge
	•	This conversation leads the scientist to think deeply about human nature and cooperation

Sci-fi element:
	•	The scientist fakes an alien arrival / alien invasion
	•	The goal is to unite humanity worldwide against a common enemy
	•	The aliens are not real — the invasion is staged

I don’t remember: year, cover art, character names, or other stories in the book.

If this rings a bell, I’d really appreciate the title and author. Thanks!

I’m a trans woman living in Paris. Yesterday I met a couple who have been together for about 10 years.

They told me they started exploring on Feeld around six months ago, mainly experimenting with threesomes and foursomes. We met for coffee, and later I went to their place to hang out and talk more.

During the time together, I realized I was developing feelings for the man. At the same time, I had the strong impression that the woman wasn’t very comfortable with my presence. It wasn’t overt hostility, more like emotional distance or subtle resistance. So the action is mostly between me and her boyfriend, but she kinda disappointed and sitting there with no feelings or emotions at all.

On the other hand, the man seemed interested in me — attentive, looked me in the eyes, couldn’t stop kissing me and fucking me. But I couldn’t enjoy it, cuz she’s next to me and seems not really happy.

I’m aware they have a long shared history, and I don’t want to be disrespectful or unintentionally destabilize a relationship that predates me by a decade. Still, I’m left feeling unsure how to interpret what happened and whether it’s wise (or ethical) to continue engaging with them.

I’d love to hear outside perspectives:

– Is this a common dynamic when couples open up after many years?

– Is it usually a bad idea to get emotionally involved with one person in an established couple?

– What would be the healthiest way to handle this going forward?

\~\~\~

Forcing the door shut against the cold wind that had been harassing them all day, Hercules let out a grateful sigh. He held up a hand to protect himself — laughing — as Iolaus shook himself like a dog, drops of melting snow flying in all directions. The tavern they'd entered was packed full with reveling customers, a bit surprising considering the harsh weather. He wouldn't call it a snow storm exactly — not such bad weather that people wouldn't dare venture outside — but unpleasant enough that he'd expect people to want to stay at home if possible.

The sudden drop in temperature that morning had caught them by surprise, and the rain-turned-sleet combined with the biting wind hadn't made the last part of their trek a very pleasant experience; this was the first bit of warmth they'd felt all day. But things were definitely looking up; a warming fire, a friendly atmosphere, and the possibility of (decently) soft beds were exactly what they needed right now.

Hercules' brewing bliss evaporated when he spotted a familiar face behind the bar counter. ""Oh no,"" he groaned.

""What?"" Iolaus rose to tiptoes and craned his head back and forth in an attempt to look past the crowd. When he wasn't successful he looked to his partner expectantly, hand on his sword hilt.

""Let's find a different tavern,"" Hercules tried, knowing it was futile.

Iolaus scowled. ""No way! I don't care if it's Ares and Discord having a go at each other. I'm not going back out into that frozen ice-land."" Having determined that there wasn't any actual danger and his partner was just trying to avoid some inconsequential inconvenience, he started to weave his way through the crowded room. The area around the beckoning fireplace was completely packed, so he set his sight on the next best thing: the bar.

Hercules sighed and followed suit, bracing himself.

""Iolaus! Hercules!"" Falafal greeted them with a cheerful wave and a big, genuine — if rather unsanitary — smile. ""My friends! Come, come."" He unceremoniously ushered away a few other patrons that had stood at the end of the bar, making room for the demigod and his partner. ""You've come to try my new drink, yes? It's all the rage."" He indicated the full tavern proudly.

Hercules gave the lively crowd a doubtful look. *The rage might come later when the drink has passed their digestive system*, he thought to himself dryly, trying his best to keep a polite smile on his face. Falafel was a nice enough person, but Hercules had yet to have an encounter with him that his taste buds and stomach had appreciated. Before he had time to decline however, Falafel had already placed two steaming mugs in front of them.

""Careful. They're hot,"" Falafel said unnecessarily while still smiling at them encouragingly.

Iolaus' eyes lit up. ""Waaarmth,"" he said dreamily, and reached for the mug. Hercules arm shot out to stop him and Iolaus gave him an annoyed 'what gives?'-look.

Hercules ignored him, focusing his attention on Falafel. ""This drink isn't the same one you made us try in Patas, is it?""

""You didn't like my coffee-bean-brew?"" Falafel asked in shock. Hercules was impressed the infamous cook could continue to amaze at such insinuations but kept his expression carefully neutral. ""You had five refills!"" Falafel protested.

""*Iolaus* had five refills,"" he corrected, failing at making it sound like a compliment.

""I thought it was great,"" Iolaus said happily, trying to sneak his hand around Hercules' blocking arm. ""A bit bitter, but with a really nice kick to it."" Hercules pushed his hand away and he had to contend with taking a whiff of the steaming contents. ""This one smells differently though."" He gave Hercules' shin a light kick.

Falafel gave his more appreciative customer a happy smile. ""It *is* different. A whole other bean.""

""That's only because *you* didn't have to put up with—- with— yourself,"" Hercules said, returning to his part of the conversation. ""You were bouncing around the camp all night! Refusing to go to sleep.""

""You're exaggerating."" Iolaus had finally succeeded in grabbing hold of the mug. He let out a contented sigh as the warmth of the clay vessel seeped into his chilled hands.

Falafel dug around inside his apron and produced a small brown seed. ""The cocoa bean!""

""You composed a *musical number*.""

Iolaus rolled his eyes. ""So I will not have six cups this time.""

""No worry,"" Falafel cut in. ""This all new cocoa-brew doesn't overflow you with that zip-zap energy. Just a sense of perfect bliss,"" he closed his eyes and spread his arms wide, ""like you' floating on warm, fluffy clouds. Go on, taste it."" He pushed Hercules' mug closer. Then his face lit up in an epiphany. ""What wonderful idea! Soft bits of cloud that float at the top of the brew. Eureka!"" And with that he disappeared into the kitchen.

Argument temporarily forgotten, Hercules and Iolaus exchanged a highly skeptical look. Then Hercules raised an eyebrow and turned his into a 'And that's the man whose cocktail you want to drink'-look.

Iolaus wrinkled his nose. ""I don't care. It's warm. I'm cold. I'm trying it.""

Bringing the mug to his lips, he took a careful sip. It was sweet and milky. And warm. He gave a pleased chuckle as the warm liquid tickled his insides on its way through his chill body. Greedily he took another sip and let out a long sigh as the warmth started to fill him from inside-out. ""Oh, that *is* wonderful.""

Hercules watched the color return to Iolaus' wind-bitten cheeks, his shoulders relax, and a blissful, drowsy smile spread across his face. A touch of guilt stabbed at his heart. Iolaus was so good at keeping up with Hercules' stride and tempo that it was easy to forget that he didn't have the same divine reserves to lean on. They had traveled all day in the unexpected weather — eager to reach shelter from the biting cold — and clearly it had taken a heavier toll on his partner than Hercules had realized.

Iolaus opened one eye to peer suspiciously at him; obviously having picked up on Hercules' introspection. Knowing full well he'd been caught thinking inappropriate thoughts — Iolaus hated being 'coddled' — Hercules hesitantly reached for his mug as a manner of apology. ""So, you want me to believe that Falafel finally managed to make something agreeable?"" Iolaus was watching him expectantly with a twinkle in his eye, so before he could change his mind he took one big gulp of the brown swill. And didn't feel the need to spit it out. Huh. ""It's good,"" he admitted, surprised.

Iolaus grinned at him; peace offering accepted. His own mug was already running low and he waved at a man behind the bar counter, asking for one more. In another minute the barkeep came over with a steaming mug. ""There you go,"" he offered with a big smile. ""Right off the stove! You might wanna let it cool off for a bit.""

""Excuse me,"" Hercules said, grabbing the man's attention before he could hurry away again, ""do you have any available beds for the night?""

""Ah, yes. Most of these are locals,"" the innkeeper indicated the crowded serving area, ""So yes, we do have an empty room still. Only one bed though."" He glanced 'discreetly' between the demigod and the man that kept trying to sip from his near boiling cocoa-brew.

Keeping a polite smile on his face, Hercules refrained from rolling his eyes. (Iolaus did not.) ""That's fine,"" he assured the innkeeper. ""We'll take it."" They'd slept on cliff ledges smaller than Hercules was wide; a bed was a welcome luxury regardless of size.

""Ow!""

Hercules turned to see his partner nursing a scaled tongue. ""You've got the patience of a three-year-old,"" he commented with humor.

""It's not my fault Falafel's secret ingredient is molten lava,"" Iolaus replied indignant — and with a slight lisp.

Having given them directions to their room, the innkeeper moved away to serve other eager guests and Hercules and Iolaus settled in to nurse their drinks in companionable silence — savoring their well-deserved repose. But it wasn't long before Hercules noted that Iolaus started to look more half-asleep than just comfortably relaxed. He nudged him lightly with his shoulder. ""Maybe we should call it a night before I have to *carry* you to our room.""

""You wouldn't dare,"" Iolaus warned sleepily, but a giant yawn undercut him. He sighed in defeat. ""Fine,"" he relented without further prompting, proving just how exhausted he was. ""Just hold on one sec'."" He turned to the barkeep and held up his once again empty mug, ""One more to go!""

Hercules raised a questioning eyebrow.

""Three is not six,"" Iolaus informed him haughtily.

*Oh well*, Hercules thought. Since they were sharing a bed he should be grateful that Iolaus was warming himself up with the steaming brew — or he would be using Hercules to warm his ice-cold feet on instead.

As soon as Iolaus had gotten his drink-to-go he began to make his way through the still quite lively serving area, heading towards the rooms on the upper floor. Hercules followed close behind, watching his friend blow impatiently on the scalding mug in his hands. Hercules began a countdown in his head.

*3 - 2 - 1.*

""Ow."" Iolaus flinched back from his mug.

Hercules smiled warmly. *Definitely the patience of a three-year old.*",1,1765717391.0,legendaryjourneys,0,1.0,False

My family is my mom (49f) and my dad (51m) and then me (16m), Carrie (14f), Kade (13m) and Jessie (11f). For as long as I can remember my parents have never been able to afford much for me and my siblings. We were always the kids who had no donations to class supplies, we never had the money for field trips or school lunches but we weren't poor enough for free lunches either. Our clothes we wore until they were tore up or so small we couldn't force it on. Christmas and birthdays were light on gifts. We never did after school sports or music or art or anything. We didn't get money to hang out with friends. All of that was stuff our parents ""couldn't afford"".

But my parents can afford to drink up to 6 Starbucks coffees a day, each. They can eat breakfast at Starbucks and eat lunch wherever they choose that day. They can afford weekly date nights. They can afford wine and whiskey. They can afford mom's makeup and skincare routine. They both have iPhone 17 Pro's. Their clothes are always nice. That's the kind of stuff they can have but they can't afford to get us nice stuff or let us experience field trips.

That's not as easy anymore because now our parents are struggling to pay for food, they're struggling to pay the bills. They still spoil themselves but we're struggling more than ever right now and my parents are angry that I've got a job that I buy clothes out of or I save. They want me to contribute to my family but I have said no ever since I started work in July (my birthday month). My parents could cut back on stuff and we'd be in a way better place. I don't wanna work my ass off and never save just to keep them in all the nice stuff they buy. 

My siblings don't even care as much about the stuff we need. They care about the stuff they want because of mom and dad. They got caught stealing from our parents a few times and then our parents blow their fuses over it. Carrie's stuck between being jealous I have a phone (my best friend's old phone that he gave me) and mocking me for having a phone that's old. She's also really into makeup and so is Jessie and they keep asking me and our parents to buy them a whole bunch of makeup. Kade asks me once a day at least to buy him an Xbox. 

I'd like to know I'll get to eat a couple of times a day. I've started using my money for that now and it sucks. I hate that we're like this because of my parents and I know we wouldn't be doing this bad now if our parents had done better with their money. And it's not like they blew it all on us. But they expect me to help us get back out of it. Each time I refuse we argue and the last time we argued I told them it was all their fault and I mentioned all the stuff they bought/buy for themselves and how they never had money for us. I said now my money is for me and my future.

I want to get out of here. So I save and only buy stuff I need so that I can move out at 18. Otherwise I could be stuck here and then they'll make me pay rent if I'm over 18.

1pmdhns,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/1pmdhns/octopus_energy_free_50_bonus_when_you_switch_your/,Octopus Energy – free £50 bonus when you switch your gas / electricity supplier,"Octopus Energy recently became the UK's biggest energy provider (bigger than British Gas)! They have a generous refer-a-friend scheme where you earn a **free £50 credit** when you switch your energy to them. You're eligible if you have a smart meter, standard meter or economy 7 meter. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

**How to get your free £50 bonus with Octopus Energy:**

1. [Sign up to Octopus using my £50 refer-a-friend link here](https://share.octopus.energy/quiet-mouse-344)
2. Enter your post code and answer questions about your current energy use to receive a price quote. Click ""Sign me up"" to see the details about the proposed tariff, then confirm the switch once you’re happy.
3. Enter your gas and electricity meter ID/serial numbers, so have an old bill ready as this info will be on there already. Octopus is brilliant at updating you via email on the whole process with what you need to do at each step.
4. Your £50 reward will be credited to your account after your first direct debit has been taken - I received mine 2 weeks after the direct debit.

**My hot tips:**

* When getting your quote, enter your “actual” energy usage using an old bill instead of using the “low, medium, high” options to keep your direct debit payments accurate
* In your online account, you can reduce your monthly direct debits if you think they're too high - I lowered my mine by about 70%!

**My experience + timeline:**

I switched from Shell Energy to Octopus as it worked out cheaper across the board for both gas and electricity, so the £50 switch reward was a total bonus. The £50 was applied to my account less than 2 weeks after my first direct debit was taken and the switch process was probably the smoothest I’ve ever experienced. If you have a smart meter, you can also claim a free Caffe Nero or Greggs coffee each week as a free perk. Another plus: NO FEES if you decide to switch out elsewhere at any time!

1pmdfl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProjectManagementHQ/comments/1pmdfl0/client_vs_customer_sounds_like_the_same_thing_but/,"Client vs Customer — sounds like the same thing… but it changes how you sell, serve, and get paid","I used to treat “client” and “customer” like interchangeable words.

Then I realized the difference isn’t just semantics — it affects **expectations, communication, delivery style, and retention**.

Here’s the simplest way to think about it:

**✅ Customers usually buy a product**

* more transactional
* usually a one-time (or repeat) purchase
* value is in the product itself
* less relationship management required

Example: buying a phone case, a template, a coffee, a SaaS subscription.

**✅ Clients usually hire you for an outcome**

* more relationship-based
* higher-touch delivery
* often longer-term
* trust and expectations matter more
* success is tied to results, not just “the thing delivered”

Example: hiring an agency, consultant, freelancer, coach, or project manager.

# Why this matters in real life

If you treat a *client* like a customer, they’ll feel unsupported (“Why aren’t you guiding me?”).

If you treat a *customer* like a client, you’ll over-deliver and burn time/money (“Why am I doing all this for $29?”).

**The practical takeaway**

Knowing which one you’re dealing with helps you:

* set the right scope + boundaries
* communicate at the right cadence
* price properly
* design better processes
* reduce complaints and confusion

I (29F) invited two of my friends, M (35F) and D (39F), to a workshop in an art gallery (free of cost, therefore the tickets were hard to secure). I arranged everything and got my hands on the tickets. On the way to the workshop, I got a message from D saying they were arriving together, which meant they had already met up before. I felt immediately excluded. It wasn’t the first time something like this happened, but this time, it really hit me hard.

M and I actually live pretty close to each other, so it's not like they just got coffee together because it was more convenient for them. They actively made the decision to meet up without me, and that felt deliberate. In the past, whenever I invited M out, she would always ask to include D, like M and I couldn’t hang out alone. I know D isn’t jealous or possessive, so I always felt like I wasn’t really part of the group or clique. I tried to ignore it, but this time, when I realized they’d made plans without me, I couldn’t just brush it off. I'm sorry - *I* find out about the event, *I* invite them, *I* secure the tickets, and they go and get coffee beforehand without me? Am I their tour guide or their PA? I felt so disrespected, I was enraged.

When I arrived, I was already hurt, so I ended up sitting at a different table during the workshop, ignored them the whole time, and then just walked out and went home as soon as it was over. They called and texted me multiple times, but I didn’t respond. Hours later, I messaged them both to say I was hurt and needed some time. They both apologised.

It's been 21 weeks since that incident. M and I haven't met or talked at all. I bumped into D at another event and we did hang out and acted cordial and normal. But she avoids my text messages and rejected my invitation.

I told them I’d reach out when I’m ready, and I did with D but got the cold shoulder. I'm not sure how to proceed. Frankly I don't even know what I want. Do I want to cut them out of my life completely? No, because I'm new to this city and have very few friends (it's extremely difficult here). But do I expect things to go back to normal after this? No. Idk what I want, frankly.

Buddy stays in his 15 year relationship bc they have a history and she relies on him. He said he doesn't want to have sex with her, isn't attracted to her and loves her but not in love anymore. She is a stay at home dog mom and loves her life with him.

He cheated on her for over a year apparently because she gained weight. They are both very sexual people and the long term partner blames herself for him cheating. She was addicted to painkillers and was acting weird on them he said. She said they made her gain weight and lose her libido. They had a deal she wouldn't pop pills and would stay skinny. So he cheated.

She quit the painkillers in Jan, but he carried on with the cheating until Sept when the side piece told her. He had told her he wasn't having sex at home so she was pissed that he was having sex with both. He dumped the mistress obviously for betraying him even though he was lying to both women.

He tried to control the narrative but the mistress sent screen shots to the long term to prove her point.

He still tried being sexual with the mistress after being caught mid Sept, even though he was pissed about the betrayal. The long term caught them chatting on instagam mid Nov and he ended things again with the side piece. The side piece kept reaching out and he kept responding though.

Yesterday he met with the side piece outside a coffee shop at her request. He didn't have to go and could have said no. He yelled and said to leave him alone, he was going to charge her with harassment and call the police if she doesn't leave his truck and stop contacting him. The whole meeting lasted under 10 minutes. Harassment charges are far reaching when they were carrying on back and forth and he willingly came to the coffee shop..

The mistress and LT have each others numbers and had been texting intermittently throughout the past 3 months. 

**Should the mistress tell the long term that he asked for and got a bj mid Nov, the day before getting caught still talking to her on ig and how he was going to try to make something work? 

He told his long term he was being honest and she believes him. She told the mistress that he was being very good about being honest with her. He said it would just be rubbing her nose in it and she isn't leaving him no matter what. Doesn't she have a right to know that last detail? 

The truth is fair game when he made the mistress out to be psycho. He told the mistress he missed having sex with her and was going to try to make something work.

I (29F) invited two of my friends, M (35F) and D (39F), to a workshop in an art gallery (free of cost, therefore the tickets were hard to secure). I arranged everything and got my hands on  the tickets. On the way to the workshop, I got a message from D saying they were arriving together, which meant they had already met up before. I felt immediately excluded. It wasn’t the first time something like this happened, but this time, it really hit me hard.

M and I actually live pretty close to each other, so it's not like they just got coffee together because it was more convenient for them. They actively made the decision to meet up without me, and that felt deliberate. In the past, whenever I invited M out, she would always ask to include D, like M and I couldn’t hang out alone. I know D isn’t jealous or possessive, so I always felt like I wasn’t really part of the group or clique. I tried to ignore it, but this time, when I realized they’d made plans without me, I couldn’t just brush it off. I'm sorry - *I* find out about the event, *I* invite them, *I* secure the tickets, and they go and get coffee beforehand without me? Am I their tour guide or their PA? I felt so disrespected, I was enraged. 

When I arrived, I was already hurt, so I ended up sitting at a different table during the workshop, ignored them the whole time, and then just walked out and went home as soon as it was over. They called and texted me multiple times, but I didn’t respond. Hours later, I messaged them both to say I was hurt and needed some time. They both apologised. 

It's been 21 weeks since that incident. M and I haven't met or talked at all. I bumped into D at another event and we did hang out and acted cordial and normal. But she avoids my text messages and rejected my invitation.  
   
I told them I’d reach out when I’m ready, and I did with D but got the cold shoulder. I'm not sure how to proceed. Frankly I don't even know what I want. Do I want to cut them out of my life completely? No, because I'm new to this city and have very few friends (it's extremely difficult here). But do I expect things to go back to normal after this? No. Idk what I want, frankly.

# NAMA and NioCorp: Building America’s Critical-Alloy Backbone

[NioCorp Acquires Scandium Alloy Assets to Support Potential First-Ever Vertically Integrated U.S. Scandium Mine-to-Markets Supply Chain | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-acquires-scandium-alloy-assets-to-support-potential-first-ever-vertically-integrated-u-s-scandium-mine-to-markets-supply-chain/)

***Just trying to get a handle on what NAMA might be doing. As always FORM YOUR own Opinions & Conclusions!***

I am thinking: NioCorp’s formation of **NioCorp Advanced Metals and Alloys LLC (NAMA)** marks a deliberate and strategic expansion beyond mining into advanced materials manufacturing. **While NioCorp remains the parent company focused on developing the Elk Creek mine and producing critical oxides** (Scandium, Niobium, Titanium, and Rare Earths), NAMA is being staged as the **alloy-production and commercialization arm**. The December 2025 acquisition of FEA’s scandium alloy IP is the clearest signal: **NioCorp now controls not only the upstream resource but also the downstream know-how required to convert scandium oxide directly into aluminum-scandium alloys.** This separation is intentional. Mining and oxide production are financeable through conservative debt structures like EXIM, while alloy manufacturing, IP monetization, and defense partnerships belong in a more flexible subsidiary **designed for joint ventures and Title III-style funding.**

[NioCorp has solved \\""The Chicken or the Egg problem!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1pmda3b/video/76ukf70at57g1/player)

# NAMA = NioCorp Advanced Metals and Alloys LLC

**NAMA is a wholly owned subsidiary of NioCorp.**

# What That Means in Plain English

* **NioCorp (NB)** = the **parent company**
* **NAMA (NioCorp Advanced Metals and Alloys LLC)** = the **downstream commercialization + production arm**

NAMA is **not** a JV, not a third party, and not independent. It sits **under** NioCorp and exists to do what the mine itself should *not* do inside a DFS:

***""Turn oxides into higher-value metals, alloys, and qualified defense materials.""***

[NAMA- Enables ScAl, ScTi, and other advanced alloy manufacturing to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1pmda3b/video/sqoveg76u57g1/player)

# Why NAMA Exists (Strategic Purpose)

NAMA was created to:

* Hold and deploy the **FEA alloy IP (Huge - Niocorp now holds the patents! on a new proprietary ScAl alloying process & the TEAM to make it happen!!!)**
* Manage **scandium metal production**
* Enable **ScAl, ScTi, and other advanced alloy manufacturing**
* Execute **commercial deals, licenses, and offtakes**
* Serve as the **interface with DoD, primes, and FUTURE Title III programs**

This clean separation is intentional:

* **DFS / EXIM** → mine + processing only = **NioCorp**
* **NAMA** → metals, alloys, facilities, and vertical integration

**That’s textbook project finance + defense industrial-base structure.**

[Ferroniobium & Niobium Oxide & Alloys to make \\""Stuff!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1pmda3b/video/n2gforuju57g1/player)

# Who Operates What

* **Elk Creek Mine** → **NioCorp**
* **Oxides & primary products** → **NioCorp** (Nb & Nb03, Ti & TiCl-4, Sc, Tb, Dy, Nd & Pr - oxides all mined & separated at the Elk Creek site)
* **Metal conversion & alloys** → **NAMA (Building out ScAl alloy & potentially other alloys via)**
* **\*\*\*Facilities / JVs / Title III projects** → \*\*Under -**NAMA-controlled entities**

**NioCorp** retains **strategic control**, while **NAMA** gives flexibility to:

* Bring in **partners (Lockheed, Howmet, ATI, Century... etc...**
* Accept Title III funding DPA/DoE other....
* Manage risk \~ *(Separate from mining & separation outflows from Elk Creek Mine)*
* Capture higher margins (Alloying oxides yields much higher valuations & margins $$$. **(\*\*\*\*Vertical integrations of NioCorp's oxides are in motion! 2026- 2029!)**

[The FEA process is more than a scandium breakthrough; it is a repeatable platform!](https://preview.redd.it/ktmlrr1hv57g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e7cf208f32da80a74e7397b4e0b54f3b6ffa0b6)

**The FEA process is more than a scandium breakthrough;** it is a **repeatable platform**. By bypassing the costly Scandium-metal step and moving oxide directly to alloy, NAMA lowers barriers to early production and accelerates qualification with defense primes. **This same logic can extend to other Elk Creek outputs —** Scandium-Titanium alloys, Aluminum-Scandium-Titanium systems, Niobium-modified alloys, and Titanium pathways beginning with TiCl₄. Jim Sims’ responses & comments to past questions: **that** ***all of NioCorp’s critical minerals are undergoing testing*** **""strongly suggests"" that ScAl is only the first application!** In other words, NAMA is not a single-product vehicle; it is a **scalable advanced-materials platform** built around Elk Creek’s unique multi-critical-mineral feedstock.

# Consider: What NAMA actually is being staged to do

IMHO— **NAMA is being positioned as NioCorp’s alloy and advanced-materials production arm**, not just a passive IP holder. The key sentence in the release above is not the scandium hype **— it’s this:**

*“…examining the feasibility of extending its potential domestic scandium supply chain to include production of finished Al-Sc alloy (0.1%–0.5%) and custom alloy parts cast, forged, and/or machined in the U.S.”*

That is **manufacturing language**, not mining language. It explicitly contemplates:

* Finished alloys (not just master alloy)
* Parts, not billets
* U.S.-based production
* Defense and commercial customers

That role **cannot** sit inside the mine or the DFS. It *must* sit in a separate entity — and that entity is **NAMA**.

For Context See:

[\#NIOCORP\~ Sharing Responses to 4 Questions from management as we head into ""2026\~ The Year!"" : r/NIOCORP\_MINE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/1pkzkfw/niocorp_sharing_responses_to_4_questions_from/)

[Titanium & TiCl-4 \(The precursor of Titanium Alloys\) will be mined & separated into oxides at the Elk Creek Mine to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1pmda3b/video/uw423wfww57g1/player)

# Why FEA IP was the keystone (and why this matters beyond ScAl)

The FEA process matters because it **bypasses scandium metal** and goes oxide → alloy directly. That dramatically lowers cost, complexity, and CAPEX for early-stage alloy production. But the *bigger* takeaway is structural:

* NioCorp now controls **oxide production**
* NAMA controls **oxide-to-alloy conversion**
* That framework is **repeatable** across other systems

Which is why Jim’s comment that *“all of NioCorp’s critical minerals are undergoing testing”* is so important. That strongly implies:

* **Sc–Al alloys first** (lowest barrier, highest defense demand)
* Follow-on **Sc–Ti**, **Sc–Al–Ti**, and **Nb-modified alloys \*\*\*\***
* Titanium pathways via **TiCl₄ → sponge → alloy \*\*\*\*\***
* Nb₂O₅ → alloying additives for aerospace steels and superalloys \*\*\*\*

Same structure. Same logic. Same customers.

# Why this does NOT mean “everything at once”

This is where people including myself get tripped up. **NioCorp is** ***not*** **trying to do:**

* A full alloy complex
* A magnet factory
* A recycling hub **all inside the DFS or at once**

Instead, they’re doing this **correctly**:

1. **Mine + oxides financed FIRST via-** (DFS / EXIM)
2. **NAMA (Separate Entity)- advances alloys in parallel** via DoD, primes, Title III
3. **Facilities are partner-funded or government-backed**
4. Scale happens *after* FID, not before

\*\*\*That’s why NAMA exists — to allow **optional, modular vertical integration** **without risking mine financing.**

**FOR NIOCORP & It's Shareholders,** this is **not a “do everything at once” strategy**. The DFS and EXIM financing are designed to de-risk and fund the mine and oxide plant only — exactly what lenders require.

NAMA operates in parallel, advancing alloys through Pentagon programs, Lockheed qualification work, and potential commercial offtakes that can later support a dedicated U.S. alloy facility funded by Title III, strategic partners, or JVs with major aerospace and defense manufacturers. This sequencing preserves control, minimizes financing risk, and maximizes upside.

When fully realized, Elk Creek will not simply be a mine; paired with NAMA, it becomes a cornerstone of a U.S.-controlled, mine-to-alloy supply chain for national security and advanced manufacturing — the kind of platform value that rarely exists in a single company.

***This is how we rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.**  
The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

# NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — it’s the platform the solution gets built on!

# ⚙️ Elk Creek is a U.S. National Security Asset!

My prep and shot is as follows;

I always use 18g of beans. The Silenzio is equipped with the single dose kit and a grind setting dial so I have a reference point. It usually gets about 0.2g of retention, so I put in 18.2g of beans in it. I open the bean holder (the metal disk) after I turn it on so the beans fall into the running grinder. While it grinds, I use the bellow to help push it out. (maybe I shouldn't do this while its running?). The annoying part here is that the max timer on Silenzio is not enough to grind the entire 18g in one run, so I need to run it twice. (this might be the other hidden variable but the Bambino portafilter does not work with Silenzio's push button). I then transfer the ground coffee to the portafilter, do small circles with WDT, tamp with a self-leveling tamper and put on a metal puck screen.

On Bambino, I do a blank shot first then do the actual shot by holding down the button and pressing it again to stop at ~38g. I always hold down the button for the maximum duration of pre-infusion. (which might not be the best approach for every coffee but my reasoning is that it removes a variable). Now, on average, I get okay coffee with this flow. However, with the same flow, same grind setting and the same coffee, it varies a lot between getting completely stuck, ~3g in 30+ secs, or running too fast with ~38g in in 18-20secs. This happens with single shots from a cold start during the day but also with back to back shots. For back to back shots, I tell myself that it's probably just the Bambino itself but for a single shot from zero, I don't really get what is going so wrong. For example, I made an okay espresso in the morning, getting 36g in 22secs. In the afternoon, with the same flow and coffee beans, it gets completely stuck and I grab a cup of tea instead.

Apart from the things I wrote above in parentheses, the rubber duck effect as I was writing, I don't really know what is going on. So, feel free to roast me but also give some tips please. Thanks!",2,1765715328.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

**Odds Breakdown & Implied Probabilities**  
The bookmakers are playing coy with this one, offering decimal odds that suggest a near-equal clash. AD Ceuta sits at **2.85** (35.1% implied probability), Las Palmas at **2.7** (37%), and the draw at **2.85** (35.1%). It’s the sportsbook equivalent of a three-way tie for “most likely to spill your stadium coffee.” Neither team is a clear favorite, but the numbers hint at a low-scoring affair—over/under 2.0 goals is priced tightly, with “under” barely cheaper than a cheap nacho platter.

**Team News: Injuries, Loans, and Island Vibes**  
AD Ceuta, the “superferry” squad, returns **Anuar** from suspension, but loses **Bassinga** (on loan from Las Palmas, and presumably sent back as a bad omen) and **Manu Sánchez** (sidelined for weeks). Still, Ceuta’s home record is as sturdy as a Gibraltar lighthouse: 18 points from 24 at the Alfonso Murube, including wins over Almería and Burgos, two teams that smell like promotion more than their morning espresso.

Las Palmas, meanwhile, is a team with **30 points** and La Liga dreams, but their recent form is spicier than a canary’s feathers. They lost to Mallorca last time out, and their insular geography (Canary Islands, anyone?) means they’re no strangers to island vibes—though their 2-3 defeat there was less “tropical paradise” and more “bring an umbrella.” They’ll hope their trip to Ceuta isn’t another sandcastle doomed to the tide.

*Predicting the 2025 Süper Lig Showdown with Math, Mayhem, and a Sprinkle of Absurdity*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
The bookmakers are as confused as a Turkish coffee in a teacup. Trabzonspor (implied probability: \~40.8%) and Beşiktaş (39.2%) are nearly even-money favorites, with the draw (27.4%) hovering like a pesky mosquito at a picnic. The “Under 2.5 Goals” line is heavily favored (odds as low as 1.6), suggesting this could be a match where the crowd’s collective heartbeat is the only thing scoring. Historically, Trabzonspor leads 57-48 in head-to-heads, but Beşiktaş has won three of their last four meetings—including a 3-2 Turkish Cup final drubbing. Recent form? Trabzonspor is second in the league, riding a three-game win streak, while Beşiktaş is a floundering fifth, with only two league wins in six games. Yet, Trabzonspor’s star striker, Paul Onuachu (the league’s top scorer with 11 goals), is suspended, and key midfielder Ernest Muçi is unavailable due to a “club conflict” (read: drama that would make a soap opera writer weep). Beşiktaş, meanwhile, is missing five starters, including Cengiz Ünder and Rafa Silva, and Felix Uduokhai is one yellow card away from a suspension.

**Digesting the News: Absences, Loans, and Loopholes**  
Trabzonspor’s offense is now led by Felipe Augusto, a player whose highlight reel includes scoring against the clock… and occasionally the wrong net. Without Onuachu, their attack is like a Turkish coffee without sugar—bitter and lacking the sweet kick. Beşiktaş, on the other hand, is a team of parts. Necip Uysal and Cengiz Ünder are out, Jota Silva is injured, and Rafa Silva is sidelined. It’s like trying to build a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces in a different language. Yet, Tammy Abraham and El Bilal Toure have shown bench brilliance, scoring off the bench like they’re auditionin

Been in the city forever, but between long hours at work, markets, deals and the usual grind, my social circle outside office has pretty much vanished.

Lately finding myself with more free time on weekends and evenings, and realising I miss having a solid group to hang out with. I’m big into sports (cricket, football, F1 – love watching and discussing), politics (Indian + global, no filter on opinions), and tech (gadgets, startups, markets, AI – basically anything that’s moving fast).

Not into the clubbing/party scene or late-night drinking marathons. Just looking for grounded, sharp people who enjoy good conversations over coffee/beer, debating the latest match or election drama, geeking out on tech news, or even catching a game together.

I stay in the plush PAN Card Club Road area in Baner – great location, easy to meet up or a discussion if you’re in Baner, Balewadi, Aundh, Hinjewadi or even don’t mind a quick drive.

If you’re around north-west Pune, like no-drama vibes, and want to build a small circle for regular chats/hangs rather than one-off meets, drop a comment or DM.

Bonus if you follow IPL/F1 closely or have strong (but civil) political takes 😏",6,1765714996.0,punemeetup,16,1.0,False

I’m super excited to use it. Christmas Day will be chaotic with kids and hosting, and grocery stores won’t be open, yet I’d love to be able to make the perfect drinks on opening day which I realize might be a tall order as we navigate the new machine. At home we’ve literally only ever used a Kurig, (so talk me me like I’m 3) and I have a fancy machine at work that I avoided for far too long,  but colleagues have now trained me on what buttons exactly to press to make the perfect java however I don’t buy the ingredients or maintain that machine. So hit me up with what I need to know and have on hand for day 1 success! 

Day 1 orders:
- coffee
- tea
- cappacuino
- latte
- hot chocolate with frothed milk
-any other recommended favourites
 
Day 2: 
+ Espresso martini

Always: My Xmas eve guests would ordinarily request decaf, so if there’s a way to do decaf while also using the machine with regular beans I’d love to know. 

I love in the gta, bean recommendations accepted. 
Wish me luck & tell me everything I need to know and what you wish you knew on day 1. ",1,1765714535.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

A bit context about me - i like coffee bitterness till cold brew, cortado etc.  and yes i like milk based too. I have a drip coffee machine at home i got it as gift but i realised maybe plain drip coffee im yet to reach that level. And for that machine i got very cheap sleepy owl coarse grind. Ik bad choice but i had no money that time. 

Now i want to buy a moka pot to make espresso kind drinks like cortado, flat white, lattes etc. milk based basically at home. 
I want any kind of suggestion on what i can buy before this yr ends along with coffee too. 

Thanks everyone

It’s not the big life stuff, those feel somewhat straightforward, but the little things. Like deciding what to cook, which route to take to work, or even which chair to sit in at a cafe. Somehow, every tiny choice spirals into a mental debate that feels like I’m negotiating a UN treaty. Yesterday I was scrolling online for inspiration and somehow ended up on a site showing a full-scale hydraulic racing simulator. Absolutely no intention of buying one, it’s not even practical, but I found myself thinking about how much effort goes into designing those things. Then I blinked and I was reading factory specifications on Alibaba for parts that probably cost less than my morning coffee. My brain apparently loves jumping to extremes. It made me realize that maybe this overthinking habit is just my mind trying to simulate every possible scenario before making a move, even when it’s unnecessary. I’m trying to catch myself and just pick something. Anything. Like choosing the first item on the menu instead of scrolling endlessly. It’s a small step, but it feels like a big one. Does anyone else get caught in this loop of over-preparing for minor stuffHow do you snap out of it without feeling guilty for not considering every angle?",1,1765714442.0,NoOverthinking,1,1.0,False
