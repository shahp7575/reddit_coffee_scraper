I also will add that we only hugged for the first two dates, no flirty touching/kissing. Maybe it was my fault for not escalating...

I work as a barista in the morning and server in the afternoon. It‚Äôs primarily a restaurant with a ‚Äúcounter‚Äù I HATE that they call it the counter and not cafe. I‚Äôve been corrected a few times to say counter. 

But anyway, I have five years experience in cafe management, and I‚Äôm a damn good barista. Unfortunately the money is not there for being a barista so I applied to this restaurant saying I‚Äôd help the ‚Äúcounter‚Äù if I can have some serving shifts.

I was still getting used to the machine and new steam wands, and poured the worst latte art I‚Äôve poured in years. And the manager thought it was so good that I‚Äôd make everyone look bad. Specifically her. and if I wanted to do art I‚Äôd have to teach everyone.

I told her this isn‚Äôt even good, and that I was a little offended she said that. I also told her it takes years to reach my level I can‚Äôt teach this in one day. 

I saw one of her lattes today and it was baaaaaaadddddddd. this lady has NO CLUE what she‚Äôs doing, and was just sorted placed in this role and thinks it‚Äôs like pull the shot steam the milk, how hard can it be.

I‚Äôve finally figured out the wands and made a micro foam, and I really want to practice. It‚Äôs actually harder for me to not make art, since it comes to naturally to me now. Like now I can actually pour some real latte art, and I‚Äôm very proud of it. I want to be the best. And I am the best, and I‚Äôm just a little hurt I am being forced to hold back. like why can‚Äôt I thrive. 

Would you say to one of the servers ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be too good, because they people will want you to be their server‚Äù 

Also her reasoning if she doesn‚Äôt want to discourage guests from coming in because I‚Äôm not working. And it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm an actual  barista.

Idk I‚Äôm thinking about going above her and asking to be the cafe manager. Because this ain‚Äôt it. 

She‚Äôs super bad at explaining things, and being patience and training. At first I was trying to just let it go, but I‚Äôm starting to get irritated. ",2,1746240748.0,barista,0,1.0,False

I make around 60k a year. I work as much overtime as I possibly can, and my current school doesn‚Äôt allow me to get another job, strange I know, but it‚Äôs in the contract. It is a lot of work and I‚Äôd think I‚Äôd pass out trying to even squeeze in something else, but I do babysit under the table when I can.

Because I‚Äôve almost always worked in education, I‚Äôve come across this problem where every summer I can‚Äôt seem to save enough to make it through to August without my regular paychecks. 

Last year was the worst by far and my phone ended up getting cut off and I couldn‚Äôt even afford to get to a summer job I found. All of my debt had so many late fees and it took until December to finally catch up. Luckily, I live with my family, as many of them have health issues, so I pay no rent; only water, house dues, groceries etc. But the house needs maintenance often and living in a community-like setting with my family can sometimes make expenses that I can‚Äôt afford. Ex. Helping my dad with his car payments (he‚Äôs working three jobs himself, poor guy, recently had a heart attack)

Anyways, I say all this to say I‚Äôve been trying to save, not hanging out with friends, quitting the morning coffee, only getting food from restaurants when I have a coupon.. I take the bus and I haven‚Äôt bought new clothes and shoes in years. I‚Äôm ~30k in personal loan/credit card debt from not working at all some summers due to illnesses, various family emergencies, and getting laid off years ago which put me at a place where I had to live off all my credit cards/take out loans to survive.

With summer fast approaching, I just want any advice on what I should do as far as still being able to buy bare minimum groceries and pay around $1800/month with no income until late August. I have one summer job lined up, but they don‚Äôt pay until mid/late August, and I can‚Äôt find anyone else to hire me for just a month and a half. 

I thought about fully abandoning my debt right now and just saving what I‚Äôd usually give credit cards/loans and just saving it so I can survive. What are the risks of this besides debt collectors? How long would it take for my credit to recover? Should I do a debt collection program?

Ive always made payments on time and just paid of my two biggest loans, but it all just feels like a drop in the bucket. And I don‚Äôt want to take out more loans for the summer, which I don‚Äôt even think I could do at this point.

I feel trapped, most of my income goes to debt and I‚Äôm spiraling into depression. I‚Äôm well aware that I should‚Äôve/could‚Äôve done things differently but it just seemed like life kept creeping up on me.

I want each and everyone of you to get in contact with your MP, stat. If you want more information about how to meet your MP in person before the debate, DM me or comment below, I will walk you through the process. We can look together at your MPs stances and how they have changed.

Get anyone in your family that is willing to listen to meet with their MPs. Get every cis friend to make an appointment to back up you up.

Meetings with MPs are subject to reasonable adjustments, and you can normally bring someone with you. Most MPs can do video call or phone surgeries. We want as many meetings with trans people as possible with MPs before this debate. 

If your MP is transphobic? Hound them. Argue about every single hole in their logic. Sit there and waste their time. Go to their Offices toilets and do your business after the meeting, leave the taps open jussst slightly. Use a little more bog roll than is necessary. Ask them what are you supposed to do. Don't let an intern give you a cookie cutter response email that takes two clicks, actually waste real minutes of their day that they can never take back. 

If your MP is undecided tell them what's at stake, give them your personal stories about why you don't have a GRC, and what hoops you actually have to jump through just to live your life. Tell them what rights you lost last month. Tell them about your friend, your loved ones etc. Again, don't let them fob you off with an email.

If your MP is fake supportive, tell them to match their own words on LGBT issues before they got elected. Hound them on these. Show them pictures of themselves at pride, point to it and say ""did you learn nothing, or were you just there to take pictures"" don't let them claim to be for the queers if they clearly aren't. Let them know that you will be watching and you expect them to make the following points (a,b,c..)

If your MP can fight in your corner, tell them to kick up a fuss. Talk about human rights, let them know that you support them, and that you appreciate them supporting you back.

1kdiee4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kdiee4/only_the_silence_knew/,Only the Silence Knew,"Her name was Vivienne Hale, a woman of motion.

In her late twenties, Vivienne was the kind of person people whispered about in lecture halls and faculty meetings ‚Äî ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs brilliant,‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to change the field,‚Äù ‚ÄúShe has more citations than her professor.‚Äù

A research assistant with a gift for unearthing lost narratives, Vivienne began her career tucked between the brittle pages of the forgotten. She catalogued fragments, translated footnotes, and reconstructed voices long erased from history. But unlike most who moved slowly in the halls of academia, Vivienne moved fast. Too fast.

She published a breakthrough paper at 28. Was invited to conferences she had no time to attend. Slept four hours a night and lived off tea, adrenaline, and deadlines. She wanted the world to know her name before she turned thirty.

What no one saw was Vivienne curled in the corner of her apartment at 3:00 a.m., crying because she didn‚Äôt know how to stop. Because when she did, the silence felt unbearable.

One night, as she traced a final annotation under a flickering lamp, she whispered:

""If only I had more time.""

Her grandmother‚Äôs old brass clock, silent for years, ticked. Once. Loudly. Midnight.

And something shifted.

Vivienne woke the next morning with pages already written, her brain alert, her body light. She had only slept two hours, yet felt entirely whole. She had double the time, somehow. Each hour now carried the weight of two. Days bent. Nights folded. Everyone else still lived in 24. She lived in 48.

She soared. She finished her PhD in record time. She wrote a bestselling book. She appeared on panels, podcasts, radio interviews. By 33, she was a global name. A woman whose mind was quoted in universities from Boston to Buenos Aires.

She met Jonah at a conference in Edinburgh. A philosopher who believed in long walks and handwritten letters. He loved her energy, her curiosity. She loved the way he listened. For a time, they fit.

They would walk cobblestone streets debating Greek myths and the meaning of memory. He made her laugh in ways she hadn‚Äôt in years. He taught her how to cook. She gave him a first edition of one of his favorite books.

They tried. God, they tried.

But Vivienne couldn‚Äôt stop. She could never stop. Jonah begged her to take a weekend off. She said she would ‚Äî then drafted an article overnight. He waited. She missed birthdays, canceled dinner plans, forgot anniversaries. Her world was always moving too fast for him to hold on.

He left a note. ‚ÄúYou are brilliant, but you live in a world where time doesn‚Äôt bend for love. I can‚Äôt keep up.‚Äù

She stared at the note for hours. She didn‚Äôt chase him.

But she thought of him often ‚Äî in the long hours of twilight, in the pauses between pages, in the scent of rosemary from the meals they never finished together.

The years doubled again. Her success swelled. But her body began to wear down. Her eyes sunken. Her joints stiff. Her memory hazy.

At 36, she looked 55. At 38, she retired early from public life.

She stopped answering calls. Stopped publishing. Stopped existing in the world‚Äôs eye.

In her quiet apartment, Vivienne spent her final days writing a collection of letters, essays, and journal entries titled The Clock Beyond Midnight. In it, she detailed her gift ‚Äî or curse. Her wish. Her rise. Her loneliness. Her regret.

‚Äî
On the final page, she wrote:

I spent my life trying to be unforgettable. I became unrecognizable instead. If you find this, remember: more time means nothing without someone to share it with.

Among the last pages, tucked between loosely bound essays, was one final letter. It was not titled, just dated‚Äîtwo days before her death. It read:

They say dying alone is when no one is there to hold your hand. But that‚Äôs not what I fear. What I fear is dying in my mind‚Äîwhen the lights go out up here, and I have no one left inside to say goodbye.

I‚Äôve outlived every version of myself. The bright one. The relentless one. The one who still believed she could stop time if she tried hard enough.

But here‚Äôs the truth: I ran so fast through life that I never sat still long enough to let anyone stay.

I was loved, once. Truly. But I traded love for momentum. Stillness felt like failure, and I couldn‚Äôt bear to be still.

Now, in the silence, I understand what I never did then: being seen isn‚Äôt the same as being known. And success is not a companion.

If someone finds this... please don‚Äôt live like I did. Fill your hours with people, not achievements. Let someone into your mind before the silence comes.

‚Äî‚Äî
There was one more letter. Found in a folder titled ""Unsent.""

It was from Jonah.

Vivienne,

I think of you every time I forget what day it is, and every time I stop to breathe.

There are things I never said. I suppose I thought we‚Äôd have time. But you were always ahead of me ‚Äî ahead of everyone. You moved like lightning and burned just as briefly.

I loved you, Vivienne. Even when it hurt. Even when you missed birthdays, forgot dinners, vanished into your world of manuscripts and midnight light. I understood it, even when it made me feel like a shadow in your life.

You once asked me why I stayed so long. The truth is: I stayed because I believed in you ‚Äî not just the brilliant you, but the you underneath. The one who liked rosemary and rainy days and old books with crooked spines. The one who laughed in the kitchen and once cried over a baby photo in a stranger‚Äôs memoir.

But love can‚Äôt survive without time. And you had none to spare.

I needed presence, not flashes. I needed a partner, not a legend. And I knew that to stay with you meant to always be behind you, watching as you blurred into tomorrow.

I don‚Äôt blame you. I never did. I just missed you. Even when you were beside me.

I hope you found peace in those long hours. I hope you let yourself rest. I hope, near the end, you knew you were loved.

I never stopped reading your work. But what I miss most is your laugh. The one you gave freely when you forgot to be brilliant for a moment and just... were.

If this ever finds you, know this: I would have waited longer. I would have waited forever, if you had just asked me to.

You moved like lightning and burned just as briefly. I loved you, even when it hurt to. I hope you found peace in those long hours. I hope, somehow, you slowed down near the end.

I never stopped reading your work. But what I miss most is your laugh. The one you gave freely when you forgot to be brilliant for a moment and just... were.

If this ever finds you, know this: I would have waited longer. I would have waited forever, if you had just asked me to.

‚Äî
When she died, no one noticed at first. Her inbox auto-replied politely. Her old publisher assumed she was traveling. A neighbor thought she had gone abroad. Her name faded slowly, like ink in the rain.

She left no family. No partner. No children. Only books. Papers. Ideas. Manuscripts that may or may not survive time. A digital archive half-forgotten. A name that once echoed in academic halls, now barely whispered.

She wanted love. She wanted a child once, briefly, in a dream she never dared speak aloud. But life was always moving. Always sprinting.

And when the silence finally came, there was no one to hear her go.

She died in a quiet room, under a blanket she once knit during a rare slow weekend. A cup of tea gone cold on the desk. Her hands curled loosely over a pen.

It wasn‚Äôt until a young archivist at the university discovered the manuscript years later ‚Äî The Clock Beyond Midnight, tucked into a digital folder labeled ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù ‚Äî that Vivienne‚Äôs voice returned.

The archivist read it in one night. Wept at her desk. And in her notes, wrote:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rush to be remembered. Rush to be present.‚Äù

And just like that, for a brief, flickering moment ‚Äî Vivienne Hale lived again.

‚Äî‚Äî
But unlike Vivienne, whose final years were spent in isolation and fading relevance, Jonah lived slowly. Deliberately. While she was forgotten by the world she once dazzled, Jonah remembered. He remembered everything. He became the quiet keeper of her flame ‚Äî the witness to a life that ran too fast to leave footprints.

He became her foil ‚Äî the one who stayed behind while she sprinted ahead, and yet in doing so, kept her alive in ways she never managed for herself.

Far from the city, Jonah eventually settled in a quiet coastal town where time seemed to move slower, or at least more gently. He taught philosophy at a small college and tended a modest garden behind his home. Sometimes, he still set a second plate at dinner. Not out of habit ‚Äî but remembrance.

He kept one of her early essays in his desk drawer, dog-eared and underlined. He never married. Never tried. He said once, over coffee with an old friend, ""I already met the love of my life. She just lived too fast.""

Each year on her birthday, he lit a candle and read from her book. Her words still filled rooms she never walked through.

In his mind, she was always walking ahead ‚Äî just out of reach, but never out of sight.

And as Jonah aged, as his hair turned silver and his hands began to tremble, he found her in the quiet moments ‚Äî in the pause between heartbeats, in the long shadows of evening. She was there, behind his eyes. A presence that never faded.

He spoke to her sometimes, out loud, while making tea or walking through the garden. He imagined her responses ‚Äî not out of madness, but memory. In those last years, he was no longer alone.

When Jonah died, it was peacefully, with her name on his lips. He was smiling.

He had waited, in his own way. And somewhere beyond time, she was waiting too.",1,1746239062.0,stories,1,1.0,False

Lately, I‚Äôve been struggling with how it ended and whether I handled things the right way.

This friend (let‚Äôs call him Charles) and I met through my university library. We connected pretty quickly, and over time I opened up to him about some very personal things ‚Äî childhood trauma, family issues, and serious mental health struggles. I genuinely thought I could trust him.

He later brought me into his church group, which I was open to at first. But over time, the environment shifted ‚Äî a lot of political talk started coming up, mostly pro-Trump stuff. I told them I wasn‚Äôt comfortable discussing politics, but Charles and his brother kept pushing. At one point, Charles questioned if my beliefs were just ""inherited from my dad"" and wouldn‚Äôt drop it, even after I clearly asked him to stop.

Eventually, I told him his behavior was crossing a line and that I felt he owed me an apology. He refused to apologize over text and said we should talk in person ‚Äî but before we even met up, he told me the friendship was over. When we did meet, I even bought him coffee, hoping to talk things through, but instead of listening or taking accountability, he told me I had low self-esteem, that I was dragging him down, and that I was ‚Äútalking like the devil.‚Äù He also tried to pray with me, which I declined. I left the conversation feeling deeply disrespected and humiliated, so I walked away and cut contact.

Since then, I‚Äôve stepped back not only from him but from the church group and anyone close to him. I thought I‚Äôd feel free or lighter ‚Äî instead, I‚Äôve been anxious and on edge. His brother quietly removed me on LinkedIn. Charles, meanwhile, acts like nothing happened when we cross paths ‚Äî fist bumps, casual energy, like he didn‚Äôt say what he said. Some mutual friends have messaged me, but I haven‚Äôt engaged much. I just don‚Äôt know who I can trust now.

What‚Äôs really getting to me is this lingering fear: I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs saying behind my back. He knows some of the darkest parts of my life. I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôs sharing it or twisting it in ways that make me look unstable. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve lost control over my own narrative, and it‚Äôs gnawing at me.

To top it off, today I saw him in the library. I was sitting a few seats behind him. He got up, grabbed his stuff, and moved four rows down ‚Äî now directly facing me. It was so weird and unsettling. What does that even mean? Why act like that?

I guess I‚Äôm just lost. How do you process this kind of betrayal without letting it consume you? Should I try to talk to mutual friends and explain, or just keep moving forward in silence?",1,1746238372.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

2. If you aren't old enough to remember the ""smoking section"" of a restaurant, welcome to the new normal. But hey, they're skinny. 
3. Everyone very friendly and welcoming. Exeception was Serbia/Belgrade where I would straight up get ignored by some girls, but every other country very friendly. 
4. Had alot more success with approaches at bars, coffee shops, etc. tinder/bumble etc did not produce anything. I'm also an extrovert so I'm not afraid to approach anybody, if that doesn't work for you I understand.
5. Make the jump boys, you won't regret it. I forgot what it was like to be treated as a human, getting outside the US opened my eyes. Hopefully more of you can experience this.

Metatron Jeanne feels tired and praises how nice a kotatsu is. There is a voice speaking from the closet but Metatron Jeanne tells you to ignore it. Metatron Jeanne asks you what you plan to do. You obviously are going to fix this Singularity. She asks if you think you can win a fight, but says that they won‚Äôt know until they try.



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>Well‚Ä¶look.

>This is already a given and a shockingly unfortunate fact.

>This Singularity is different from what you've experienced up until now in one crucial way.

>Victory in combat is not enough to correct this Singularity. Do you understand that?



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>I do‚Ä¶



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>So, in light of that. Order is pivotal in this Singularity.

>To‚Ä¶win against **her**, the Judge, you need a clear argument and a strong will.

>Y‚Äôknow you‚Äôve come this far, it‚Äôd be very shocking for you to say ‚Äúactually I don‚Äôt have a strong will‚Äù.

>It gives off a ‚Äúwhat were you doing with your life‚Äù-type of feeling.

>Well, you may have not realized it. In any case, I‚Äôm not worried about your will.

>But there‚Äôs no argument. There is no clear argument that surpasses her argument.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>The Judge‚Äôs‚Ä¶argument.

**Metatron Jeanne:**

>Yes.

>‚Ä¶You‚Äôve overcome \[Sloth\], you should have realized that much.

>This is Metatron Jeanne‚Äôs argument.

>‚Äú---Humans have made a mistake. The result of said mistake is a blank slate. Thus, humans should go extinct.‚Äù

>‚ÄúAs for the new intelligent species‚Ä¶We wait for it to be born on this planet, for someone we can consider the next intelligent being.‚Äù

>‚ÄúIt does not matter how many billions of years it takes. It is our duty as old-Humanity, our atonement.‚Äù



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>(Speechless)



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>Yea, basically‚Ä¶she gave up.

>Instead of saving Humanity, the planet‚Äôs resources will be allocated to forming a new Humanity.

>It was concluded that this would be more meaningful.

>Will the next Humanity be dinosaurs, octopuses, or something beyond our own imagination?

>We don‚Äôt know for sure‚Ä¶

>She declares that until the day coincidences arise and living things are born, she will wait.

>And, at the same time, the ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù Humanity will be discarded.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>That‚Äôs‚Ä¶impossible, right?

**Metatron Jeanne:**

>Yes, yes. It‚Äôs a natural response for old Humanity. But **why**?

>The Earth Bleaching Phenomenon erased all of Humanity and its history in an instant.

>Let‚Äôs set aside the method and motives for now. Let‚Äôs understand the current situation.

>The way to fix this was to erase all the Lostbelts and head to the final location‚Ä¶right?



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Yes I know that.



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>I have knowledge of this as the ruler of this Singularity.

>What will be hurt, what will be lost, what will be the price?

>That is something I do not know.



Metatron Jeanne states that it is more efficient to start over rather than bring back Humanity. That is because Metatron thinks that the Earth Bleaching Phenomenon has taken its effect and cannot be undone. Metatron Jeanne has some reservations about this. Metatron Jeanne says that while Chaldea is guilty, **there is something more unforgivable than that**. Thus, as long as your crimes remain, the Judge will not grant Chaldea the right to save Humanity, and will focus on building a new Humanity. Metatron Jeanne thinks that you are not to blame.

**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>Hey, don‚Äôt tangle up my legs!



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>C‚Äômonnnnn! Let‚Äôs be lazyyyyy!

>Let‚Äôs do some kind of battle. No? How unfortunate.

**Metatron Jeanne:**

>I said all that and you still want to win? ‚Ä¶Can‚Äôt be helped I guess.

>Like I said, you need a clear argument.

>Something like ‚Äúkilling people is wrong‚Äù is weak and a no-go.

>And also‚Ä¶let me preface this. Taking other people‚Äôs suggestions is an absolute no-go.

>The Judge will immediately take notice, and deem it worthy to nullify your existence.

>Copying and pasting other people‚Äôs arguments has no value in this situation.

>It‚Äôs a bit too far, but it‚Äôs understandable.

>That is why it has to be you‚Ä¶to make that clear argument.

>Look, you said you were having nightmares, right?

>These nightmares are probably born out from the acts you‚Äôve committed and the guilt you feel from it.

>That is due to the fact that this Singularity puts a heavy emphasis on crime and punishment.

>That dream is necessary in order to confront it and recognize your own arguments.



**Fujimaru Ritsuka:**

>‚Ä¶I suppose so‚Ä¶



**Metatron Jeanne:**

>Right. I heard you overcame the nightmare.

>If that‚Äôs true, then I believe it shows your strong will and clear arguments.



She changes up the topic to get you to be in the kotatsu longer. Then offers up a bunch of snacks. Amakusa Shiro arrives to ask if Metatron Jeanne can speak to him for a bit.

Irene invites Mashu into M&D Law Firm‚Äôs office. Mashu asks how Irene can get in here and Irene responds that she made a spare key. Irene asks if Mashu wants tea or coffee, but Irene makes her coffee since there‚Äôs no tea.¬†



To begin a long conversation, Irene asks how Mashu felt about her month of laziness, and Mashu responds that she enjoyed it and hopes that she didn‚Äôt get corrupted. Irene gets straight to the point, and asks if Mashu remembers her homework. Mashu remembers and has been thinking about it during that same month. Irene is surprised that Metatron Jeanne‚Äôs powers was ineffective when it came to the homework.



**Irene:**

>Poor thing. ‚Ä¶Well, it‚Äôs whatever, let‚Äôs hear your answer.



**Mashu:**

>‚ÄîOkay. The emotion you harbor.



>Every time I see this person, there‚Äôs always pain in my heart.

>It felt like my thoughts were obstructed, my body grew hot, and my sweat felt strangely cold.

>I can‚Äôt look away from her, yet I want to. Her existence disturbs me to my very core.

>And so, after some thought, I was able to describe this emotion.

>About how Irene Alder feels towards me.



**Mashu:**

>You‚Äî

>‚Äîhate me.



Irene says that she‚Äôs more or less correct and that her homework is done. Irene rewards her by transforming into another form of hers.

**Irene:**

>My True Name is Lilith. Woman of the Storm in Mesopotamia, mother of the Lilins (demons)



Lilith tells her to never be nice to her because she hates Mashu Kyrielight. She begins to describe her hate. Whatever Mashu feels, Lilith feels the opposite. For example, if Mashu is happy, Lilith would be annoyed. If Mashu was hurt, unhappy or depressed, it‚Äôd make Lilith happy. Mashu asks if Lilith hates Humanity, but Lilith just hates Mashu. Mashu asks if they met before. Lilith replies that she hated her the moment they met. Mashu asks why.



**Lilith:**

>But, I know about your past. All of it.

>That you‚Äôre a Demi-Servant, and a designer baby that they created.

>You‚Äôre an autonomous being **just** pretending to play human.



**Mashu:**

>I know that I‚Äôm a Demi-Servant‚Ä¶

>But I‚Äôm not pretending‚Ä¶!



**Lilith:**

>Kyrielight, have you ever hated evil?



**Mashu:**

>Eh? Well‚Äî



**Lilith:**

>There are times where you feel like fighting them. Times where you wanted to correct them.

>But‚Äî Have you ever thought about **never forgiving this being**?



**Mashu:**

>To think about it‚Ä¶

**Lilith:**

>That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre not human, Kyrielight.

>Every human has a scale of their likes and dislikes. It helps distinguish what we like and dislike.

>If there are 100 people, there will be 100 scales, and it will swing unsteadily no matter what you put on there.

>If the person you love is evil, the scales will swing.

>If the person I hate is just, it‚Äôll swing the same way.

>No one can ever truly have balanced scales.

>But that is how humans are. Vague, irresponsible, ambiguous, inaccurate.

>That obscurity is what I love about humans.

>That goes for Fujimaru.

>His scales are definitely vague.

>He hates, pities, sympathizes, get angry, forgives, gets disappointed, disheartened, and each time‚Äî

>The balance of likes and dislikes gets swung.

>That‚Äôs why Kyrielight.

>I like Fujimaru.

>I‚Äôve normally lied, but this is no lie. ‚Ä¶Do you get that?



**Mashu:**

>‚Ä¶Yes, I get it.



**Lilith:**

>However, your scales are different.



**Mashu:**

>My‚Äîscales.



**Lilith:**

>Your scales are worthy of being despised and hated on. Because they don‚Äôt move.

>**No matter what you put on it, it won‚Äôt move**.

>No matter how evil someone was, the scales of likes and dislikes never swung, and you never truly hated anyone.

>It is‚Äîdisgusting. Disgusting and vexing.



**Mashu:**

>‚Ä¶Is that wrong?

**Tepeu:**

>Mashu. There are differences. It can happen. All lives are not the same.

>You can be more saddened by the misfortune of someone closest to you than someone you hardly know. That is why Humanity flourished.

>You all sought to connect yourselves and what made you shine.

>It‚Äôs cruel, but in an ‚Äúequal world‚Äù, you all would be just like us deinos.

>A world where you never recognize the special. Never noticing the uniqueness. Never being able to save your one friend.



**Lilith:**

>‚Ä¶Ahahaha.

>Yes. That‚Äôs why I hate you.

>Kyrielight.



**Mashu:**

>‚Ä¶

>‚Ä¶Why?



**Lilith:**

>People tend to impose their ideals on others.

>I want my child to be like this. I want my parents to be like this.

>I want to be a king or a hero like that.

>I want you to be active, I want you to be neat, I want you to be obedient, I want to be strong, I want you to be clear, I want you to be smart.

>I want you‚Äìto be forever innocent.



**Mashu:**

>‚Ä¶



**Lilith:**

>Most people are content to come to a reasonable compromise in their perception of others.

>I want them to be active, but I can‚Äôt help it if they‚Äôre not energetic. I want to be obedient, but I can‚Äôt help it if they have a purpose.

>‚ÄîPerhaps it‚Äôs Chaldea‚Äôs wish that you remain a sinless being.

>But why did you just accept it and remain innocent?

>On this long, long journey‚Äîthere were many chances for you to be reborn.



**Mashu:**

>I!

>I‚Ä¶never thought I was innocent.



**Lilith:**

>But you are.



**Mashu:**

>But there‚Äôs no way‚Ä¶that Lilith-san would get it‚Ä¶!



**Lilith:**

>I do. **It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre using that shield**.



**Mashu:**

>‚ÄîAh.



**Lilith:**

>No matter how dysfunctional you may be, using that shield is what keeps you innocent.

>That is why Kyrielight is the only one who doesn‚Äôt bear the guilt of erasing these Lostbelts.

>The problem isn‚Äôt erasing the Lostbelts, it is that you don‚Äôt bear its sin, that is your sin (innocence).

>‚ÄîYou can never leave. Out of this Singularity.

>Got it?



Lilith reassures Mashu that she just hates her. She doesn‚Äôt really care about Chaldea or Fujimaru, or even killing them. However, Lilith does provoke Mashu by saying that there are ways to get to her like killing her Master to make her angry, but pretending to be angry doesn‚Äôt suit her.

https://preview.redd.it/ac7k4h755hye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=454d76ac312a30037166d5599032c9682fcab4d6

**Lilith:**

>‚ÄúLilitu (Night Storm)‚Äù



This move blows a gust of wind causing Mashu to be blown back to the bookcase and injuring her. Lilith says that she‚Äôll forgive her as she‚Äôs tolerant of her. She declares that she will get in Mashu‚Äôs way even if that means doing something to her Master. Lilith is satisfied with her revenge.



**Lilith:**

>This is a **match between you and me**. We will not tolerate each other‚Äôs existence. A fight to the death with no negotiations.

>‚ÄîDo you accept?



**Mashu:**

>‚Ä¶Yes.



**Lilith:**

>Okay. Oh, I was joking earlier.

>Killing Master? I‚Äôm not that cruel.

>That‚Äôs if you swear to fight alone.



**Mashu:**

>Understood. Lilith‚Ä¶this is just how you are.



**Lilith:**

>Don‚Äôt glare at me, defective human. Get lost.

# Kadoc and King Ashoka Conversation

https://preview.redd.it/4pxpyzn65hye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ae2ab9348c66d239d15cd32aa7743aeba81a850

Kadoc offers some tea. Ashoka wants to make this conversation quick.



**King Ashoka:**

>You are carrying the sins. **Of those two**.



**Kadoc:**

>‚Ä¶

>‚Ä¶What are you going to do after hearing that?



**King Ashoka:**

>Nothing.



**Kadoc:**

>‚Ä¶

>‚Ä¶?



**King Ashoka:**

>It is just you. Sins possess meaning for he who declares it.



**Kadoc:**

>It has meaning‚Ä¶



**King Ashoka:**

>Even if I am called the Chakravartin, I was a former king of bloodshed. I remember some of my sins.



**Kadoc:**

>‚Ä¶Can you keep this a secret?



**King Ashoka:**

>Of course. No one will know even if I have a hole in my Spiritual Core.

https://preview.redd.it/wepb6nc75hye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bdebe037486aecc734378d19b56dccc452028c8

Kadoc remembers his days as a Crypter. A Crypter who was faced with a choice by a God. A Crypter who rose from the dead to summon a Servant and secure their Lostbelt. He thinks about how he only received direct instructions from the Alien God. He thinks about his Servant, Anastasia, and how that ended and what happened up until this point.



**King Ashoka:**

>‚Ä¶I see. Betrayal, huh.



**Kadoc:**

>Yea. I betrayed everyone and managed to survive.



**King Ashoka:**

>I see.

>**Then that is your sin**.



**Kadoc:**

>‚Ä¶I‚Äôm surprised. I thought you‚Äôd say that it‚Äôd be trivial.



**King Ashoka:**

>Haha.

>It is a big deal. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve taken many lives.



**Kadoc:**

>‚Ä¶

>‚Ä¶Yea.

>Well. Do you have any advice? I‚Äôm open to hearing anything.

https://preview.redd.it/5mk5je385hye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=535e16f9ee15fd52ec509239d58452723481108a

**King Ashoka:**

>I suppose not. I am no saint.

>However, there is one thing I know. You live your life carrying, agonizing and groaning with this sin.

>The destination just up ahead‚Ä¶**is for your own end**.

>I could be wrong.



**Kadoc:**

>‚ÄîNo, I think you‚Äôre not wrong there.



**King Ashoka:**

>Oh. Then let me give you one piece of advice.



**Kadoc:**

>Okay.



**King Ashoka:**

>‚ÄîYou will eventually make a choice.

>It is a tough choice. No one will be there to help you.

>You will be alone and confused, choosing‚Äî

>That loneliness will be your punishment.



Kadoc asks King Ashoka his reasoning for his choice ‚Äúat that time‚Äù meaning his time as a king, before and after. Ashoka responds that he will leave it to Kadoc to imagine it for himself. He states that he initially chose bloodshed, but soon found his fate and reached Dharma. He says that Buddhism isn‚Äôt something that mages like Kadoc would understand. But Ashoka finds this to be a good time to preach it to him.



**King Ashoka:**

>I am me. ‚ÄîAnd you and only yourself must choose.

>To simply put, I recommend choosing a path you **do not dislike**.

https://preview.redd.it/xhk7hax85hye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e5dbf32fe94928f4aaf7a8a1172494ffd35931b

Kadoc is confused by the ‚Äúdo not dislike‚Äù part. Ashoka says that it means what it means. Kadoc doesn‚Äôt get it but he will take King Ashoka‚Äôs words to heart. He states what a shame it is for Ashoka to not be on their side.



**Ashoka:**

>By the way‚Ä¶ Have you been collecting ‚ÄúHoly Grail Drops‚Äù?



**Kadoc:**

>Well before being a \[Sloth\], I‚Äôve managed to get three.

>Then before I knew it, a month passed.



**King Ashoka:**

>I see. Then I shall make a ‚Äúrequest‚Äù to you detectives.



**Kadoc:**

>Yea, if we‚Äôre capable enough to.

https://preview.redd.it/0fya09ya5hye1.png?width=1792&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4a6ebe93d0deb8b6e513562d2c984f65eb57aa

**Ashoka:**

>There are two people who tried to purify their sins in the Greed District of Purgatory, and have decided to go to Hell.

>I want you to escort those two to the Circle of Greed within Hell.

>The ‚Äúreward‚Äù is four ‚ÄúHoly Grail Drops‚Äù



Ashoka says that order within Hell is very bad. Wardens of Hell rule over their sinners through their own strength. Even if the order there is weak, sinners will still kill each other because they don‚Äôt fear death for they are in Hell. Kadoc can use these four Drops to strengthen their Holy Grail Dagger to ease their trip in Hell.



**Ashoka:**

>Seven Wardens likened to be ‚ÄúCelestial Maidens‚Äù within the ‚ÄúDivine Comedy‚Äù...

>No‚ÄìThree and four people.



**Kadoc:**

>Three and four people?

>Wait a second, I think‚Ä¶

>Three Celestial Maidens displayed love, hope and faith, and the other four displayed basic virtues?

>I think the four cardinal virtues were‚Ä¶justice, courage, prudence and temperance.



**King Ashoka:**

>‚ÄúLove‚Äù, ‚ÄúHope‚Äù, ‚ÄúFaith‚Äù, ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù, ‚ÄúCourage‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrudence‚Äù, and ‚ÄúTemperance‚Äù.

>All of these are Servants.



**Kadoc:**

>‚Ä¶So enemies.



**King Ashoka:**

>I wonder about that.

>‚ÄîThose who travel to Hell. May the light guide you all.

**THE RIDDLE¬¥S HOUSE**

https://preview.redd.it/p7ucwrf04hye1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edfefd6707520d6d80248be7fa32b0cdedf6ef3c

The Film begin with a series of newspapers narrated by voice. In these newspapers, it is said that in a old mansion in Little Hangleton, the family that lived in that house (the Riddles) were found dead in their nightclothes, without any injuries.

The Riddles' gardener, Frank Bryce, was arrested, accused of committing the murders, but when the authorities examined the bodies, they found no evidence, and so they released Frank.

50 years later, Frank, now old and with leg pain, continues to work as a gardener at the Riddle mansion, and lives in a simple house near the mansion. One night, while making coffee, Frank notices a light in the then preserved Riddle mansion, and decides to take his cane and investigate.

Entering the house, Frank notices a half-open door, with two men talking in the living room. The first, short, stocky and with rat-like features, is intimidated by the second man, whose face is turned away in a chair. They both talk about a conspiracy involving the Quidditch World Cup, Bertha Jorkins, ""the most faithful servant"" and a boy named Harry Potter.

Before Frank can react, a large greenish snake passes him and enters the room, where it begins to talk to the man in the chair, who invites Frank into the room. Upon arriving in the room, Frank warns that he will contact the police, and is insulted when the man in the chair calls him a ""Muggle"". When Frank challenges the man to face him, the short man turns the chair over in terror, Frank's scream is heard, and a green light appears.

Miles away, little did the two men know that Harry Potter witnessed the entire scene, in a dream that sounded more like a nightmare.



**THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP**

Harry wakes up from this dream on Privet Drive, in the house of his aunt and uncle Vernon and Petunia. Alarmed in his room by what he has just seen, Harry opens the cage where his owl Hedwig is, and hands her a letter that must be given to his godfather and fugitive, Sirius Black.

  
The next day,¬†Harry is ready to go to the Burrow by noon. Harry and the Dursleys sit for a half hour, but as Vernon snarls that the Weasleys are late, they hear loud noises coming from behind the boarded-up fireplace. It is explained that the Weasleys (Arthur, Ron, Fred and George) have decided to use Floo powder on the Dursleys' electric fireplace (which leaves Arthur delighted), but before Vernon and Petunia can react, the Weasleys blasts open the wall. The Dursleys shrikies as Arthur approaches them to shake hands, while Fred and George gets Harry¬¥s trunk.

Mr. Weasley lights a fire and tells Fred to go first. Before Fred steps into the fire, he drops Ton-Tongue Toffee to pick them up again. Harry bids the Dursleys goodbye as he steps towards the fire, but Mr. Weasley stops Harry and incredulously calls¬†Vernon¬†out for not saying goodbye to Harry, who sees¬†Dudley¬†kneeling, gagging on his tongue, which is now a foot long (caused by the Ton-Tongue Toffe that Fred droped earlier).

https://preview.redd.it/0ta5b7hp2hye1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ee48036e975cc02853b334777c8ca0cfa95fd3a

As soon as¬†Harry¬†tumbles out of the fireplace in the Burrow, the two oldest Weasley brothers introduce themselves.¬†Charlie¬†is stocky like the twins and a Dragon¬¥s keeper, while¬†Bill, who works at Gringotts, is tall and looks cool. As Molly and Arthur discusses with the Twins, Ginny and Hermione appears and reveals that the Twins have started a business called Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, while Percy is upstairs working on a report for the Ministry.

Harry¬†wakes before dawn when¬†Mrs. Weasley¬†shakes him, as they will walk to the Quidditch Cup. The group (leaded by Arthur), climbs a steep hill and then begins to look for the Portkey (a item that teletransport people). A man yells to Mr. Weasley that he has it; it's an old boot. Mr. Weasley introduces¬†Amos Diggory¬†and his son,¬†Cedric, a sixth-year Hufflepuff at Hogwarts. With a minute until the appointed time,¬†Mr. Weasley¬†explains that everyone needs to touch the Portkey. They all stand in a circle around the boot and apparates to a field, where tents have been set up for the crowds who will witness the matches.

https://preview.redd.it/qtdiabg33hye1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c7869204b3e63935baf063990c7d77a4d1b94ba

Mr. Weasley¬†leads his group towards the giant stadium, and here,¬†and in the box Harry sees a house-elf named¬†Winky, a friend of Dobby's. She says that freedom isn't suiting Dobby well, as he wants to be paid. She says that house-elves are meant to obey, just like she is currently doing--she hates heights, but she's in the box because her master sent her there. Ludo Bagman (former Qudditch player)¬†appears and happily invites Mr. Weasley to bet on the match.¬†The Twins bet their entire savings and a fake wand on the improbable chance that Ireland will win, but¬†Krum¬†will get the Snitch. As they bet, Barty Crouch (important member of the ministry) appears and tell Bagman about the disappearence of Bertha Jorkins, but Bagman ignores it.

Ludo Bagman¬†races into the box, magnifies his voice, and announces the beginning of the Quidditch World Cup. He announces the display from the Bulgarian team mascots: veela and the Irish mascots and a huge comet takes the field and turns into a rainbow.¬†Mr. Weasley¬†shouts that the rainbow is made up of leprechauns, who begin to throw gold down onto the crowds, but when Ron tries to took the coins, Mr. Weasley explains that leprechauns gold it is not usable, because it disappears. 

https://preview.redd.it/b1wpzl2o3hye1.jpg?width=1488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6550d52d0d79928bcd6e62978125e1869ac07f13

Through his Omnioculars, Harry watches the referee set the balls loose and start the match. The Irish team is exceptional and scores 30 points in the first ten minutes. Everyone gasps as the Seekers dive toward the ground, but¬†Krum¬†pulls out at the last minute. The Irish Seeker crashes. Harry consults his Omnioculars, which says that Krum's move is called the Wronski Feint. Once the Irish Seeker is cleared to fly, the Irish Chasers score ten more goals, the Irish Seeker dives again, Krum in pursuit, and once again the Irish player crashes. Krum pulls out of the dive with the Snitch, ending the game but letting Ireland win because they were so far ahead. Once¬†Bagman¬†returns his voice to its normal volume, he gives¬†Fred¬†and¬†George¬†the money they won from their bet.

https://preview.redd.it/m2wqyl8q3hye1.jpg?width=1488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=68b3961f971df68b0ea5db62c0044447348632d6

While in the tent, Harry is awaken by a scared Mr. Weasley, who took him and the others outside. There, Harry sees people fleeing from a group of Death Eaters elevating four people high above them. Two of the elevated people seem to be children. Mr. Weasley¬†tells¬†the trio, the Twins and Ginny to head for the woods while he,¬†Percy,¬†Bill, and¬†Charlie¬†help the Ministry. In the darkness, the trio hear someone in the bushes. The person shouts ""*Morsmordre*"" and a glittering green skull with a snake for a tongue flies into the sky. People start to scream as Hermione, panicked, explains that it's the Dark Mark. Before the three can run, a group of aurors appears and they duck in time to miss the wizards' curses,¬†Mr. Weasley¬†yells for the group to stop.

https://preview.redd.it/iyav2r1s3hye1.jpg?width=1488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad3db55ffae950cd2715e277feff2837f8b0e221

Mr. Crouch asks who conjured the Dark Mark, and when Hermione points towards where the conjuror stood, several others investigate the dark woods.¬†Mr. Diggory¬†emerges from the trees with¬†Winky and a wand, which¬†Harry¬†recognizes it as his. ¬†Hermione¬†tells Mr. Diggory that the voice she heard was far deeper than Winky's.

Winky¬†shares that she found the wand in the trees where she was cursed, but she trembles when asked if she saw anyone. She insists she didn't.¬†Mr. Crouch¬†asks to deal with Winky himself rather than turn her over to the Ministry and threatens her with clothes, which will free her.¬†Hermione¬†tries to defend Winky, but Mr. Crouch won't hear it.¬†Mr. Diggory¬†gives¬†Harry¬†his wand and Mr. Weasley herds the trio out of the woods.

  
**PROFESSOR MOODY**

The year at Hogwarts begins, and Dumbledore¬†stands and addresses the students. He says that the Quidditch Cup won't take place this year but before he can announce what will take its place, the doors open and a grizzled man with one wooden leg starts walking toward Dumbledore. He has one normal eye and one that's large, blue, and can swivel in every direction. The man shakes Dumbledore's hand and takes a seat at the staff table. Dumbledore introduces him as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher,¬†Professor Moody.

Dumbledore¬†resumes his speech and says that this year, Hogwarts will host the Triwizard Tournament. He explains that the Tournament was established 700 years ago as a competition between the Wizarding schools Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang. It hasn't happened for centuries as the death toll rose, but this time, there are safety measures in place, but before Dumbledore can continue, he is interrupted again by Filch, who tells him that ""they"" are coming.

https://preview.redd.it/9pm0cv7e4hye1.jpg?width=1488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15fd7f0ff59086dbb4373718439367590b0ffc16

https://preview.redd.it/x6q9dngh4hye1.jpg?width=1488&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a1ff93812c92fc1f8ba0747d9e37259d8ceb3bb

Students point to the sky as a massive horse-drawn carriage soars toward them. After the carriage lands, a elegant woman as large as¬†Hagrid¬†steps out. Dumbledore leads the Hogwarts students in applause and greets the woman, whom he calls¬†Madame Maxime. She leads her shivering students inside. Few moments later,¬†Lee Jordan¬†points to the lake. A huge ship rises up from the depths. All the students seem bulky because of their fur cloaks. The headmaster,¬†Karkaroff, greets¬†Dumbledore¬†and leads his student¬†Viktor¬†inside first, as he has a cold.¬†Ron¬†hisses that ""Viktor"" is Viktor Krum.

The Beauxbatons students sit at the Ravenclaw table, while the Durmstrang students sit with the Slytherins, then Dumbledore welcomes the guests and the feast begins. A girl from Beauxbatons approaches Ron and asks if she can take the bouillabaisse. Ron mouths wordlessly at her and lets her take it. He insists the girl is a veela, which makes both Harry and¬†Hermione¬†laugh. 

After the feast ends,¬†Dumbledore¬†introduces Ludo Bagman and Barty Crouch as two judges for the Tournament. Filch carries in a huge, jewel-encrusted chest. Dumbledore explains that one champion from each school will be chosen by the Goblet of Fire, and he pulls a large cup filled with blue flames out of the casket. He says that interested students can put in their names and to keep underage students from trying, he'll draw an Age Line around the goblet.

At the start of the Care of Magical Creatures class,¬†Hagrid¬†greets the class with their first creature: baby Blast-Ended Skrewts. They look like deformed lobsters that shoot sparks out of their rear ends. Harry, Ron, and Hermione defend them to¬†Malfoy, who thinks they're nasty. Hagrid¬†asks his class to see if the skrewts will hibernate by settling the six-foot creatures in boxes. The skrewts, however, break out and most of the students hide in Hagrid's hut.¬†Harry,¬†Ron, and¬†Hermione¬†help tie up the skrewts, while a beetle bothers Harry and Hagrid¬¥s heads.

Finally,¬†the Gryffindors and Slytherins have their first class with Moody, but as Moody enters the room, he tells the class to put their writing utensils away, as he's going to teach them about curses. Moody¬†says that the Ministry of Magic wants him to only teach countercurses, but¬†Dumbledore¬†wants the students exposed to illegal Dark curses now. He asks the students to name illegal curses.¬†Ron¬†names the Imperius Curse and at this, Moody pulls a large spider out of a jar. After muttering ""*Imperio*,"" he makes the spider perform cartwheels and dance. Everyone laughs until Moody growls that a victim can be made to do anything, including kill themselves. When he asks for another curse, both¬†Hermione¬†and¬†Neville¬†raise their hands. Neville offers the Cruciatus Curse and confirms that his last name is Longbottom.

Moody¬†makes the second spider bigger before performing the curse on it. When he does, the spider twitches, rocks, and jerks in pain.¬†Hermione¬†shrilly yells for Moody to stop. Moody returns the spider to its normal size and then asks for the final curse. Hermione gives it: Avada Kedavra. This is the Killing Curse and Moody uses it to kill the final spider in his jar. It dies in a rush of green light and Moody explains that there's no way to block this one. He says that the three curses are known as the Unforgivable Curses and using one lands a person in Azkaban for life.¬†

The class takes notes until the period is over and as the Gryffindors spill into the hallway, most of them discuss the lesson as though they'd seen something fantastic. Harry and¬†Hermione¬†don't agree, and Hermione leads¬†Ron¬†and Harry towards¬†Neville. Neville's voice is high and he seems strange and distant. Moody approaches the students and invites Neville to join him for tea, and gives him a Herbology book, which makes Neville happy.

Finally, at the feast, Dumbledore¬†gets to his feet and explains that when the goblet chooses, the champions should proceed to a small room off the hall. The goblet's flames turn red and a piece of parchment flutters into Dumbledore's hand. He announces that¬†Viktor Krum¬†is the Durmstrang champion. A moment later, he reads that¬†Fleur Delacour¬†will be the Beauxbatons champion. Finally, he says that¬†Cedric Diggory¬†will represent Hogwarts. Dumbledore starts to address the remaining students, but the goblet turns red again and spits out one more piece of parchment that reads, ""Harry Potter.""

**THE FIRST TASK**

Harry trips on his robes as he gets up and walks through the doors.¬†Fleur,¬†Krum, and¬†Cedric¬†stand by the fireplace, looking impressive and mature. Before anything can be said, Dumbledore,¬†Mr. Crouch,¬†Madame Maxime,¬†Karkaroff,¬†Snape,¬†McGonagall¬†and Bagman¬†as they enter the room. Madame Maxime and Karkaroff are furious, while Snape maliciously says that¬†Harry¬†has no respect for rules. Dumbledore silences Snape and asks Harry to confirm that he didn't put his name in the goblet. 

Karkaroff¬†asks¬†Mr. Crouch¬†for his opinion. Curtly, Mr. Crouch says that they must follow the rules;¬†Harry¬†must compete.¬†When Karkaroff threatens to leave,¬†Moody¬†enters and reminds him that the tournament is a binding magical contract and all the champions must compete. Moody insists that someone put Harry's name in, knowing he'd have to compete, and¬†suggests that whoever did it might want Harry dead. Karkaroff points out that Moody sees assassination plots everywhere. The two argue but¬†Dumbledore¬†stops them and says that Harry still has to compete.¬†Bagman¬†is the only one who looks excited, and he asks¬†Mr. Crouch¬†to give the champions their instructions and he says that their first task will test their courage, that the champions cannot accept help, and that they'll be excused from final testing.

During the next day lunch, everyone seems convinced that¬†Harry¬†put his own name in, especially Hufflepuff students, who are especially cold to all Gryffindors. Ginny then arrives to fetch Harry for¬†Bagman¬†and the¬†*Daily Prophet*. Ginny leads¬†Harry¬†to a classroom where there's an area set up for photos.¬†Bagman¬†leaps at the sight of Harry and explains that it's time to weigh the champions‚Äô wands to test that they're in good condition.

He introduces Harry to¬†Rita Skeeter, who's working on a piece for the¬†*Daily Prophet*. She asks if she can interview Harry and leads him to a broom cupboard. She asks to use a¬†Quick-Quotes Quill¬†and stands the acid green quill upright on a piece of parchment. When she tests it by giving it her name, it writes observations about her appearance and reputation. The quill writes of its own accord as Skeeter asks questions that seek to paint Harry as a rebel and a loveable underdog. She asks about his parents and he notices the quill writing that he's crying, though he isn‚Äôt. Fortunately,¬†Dumbledore¬†rescues Harry.

Dumbledore¬†introduces¬†Mr. Ollivander, a Diagon Alley wand maker. He checks¬†Fleur's wand first, who reveals be part veela, then¬†Krum's, Cedric's, and Harry's and then the four take photos. Harry then returns to the dormitory.¬†Ron points out an owl for Harry. The letter is from¬†Sirius¬†and asks Harry to be alone by the fireplace late one night. 

Harry¬†looks forward to seeing¬†Sirius, especially given how horrible life is once¬†Rita Skeeter's article runs. It's entirely about Harry and quotes him as saying things he never said. Though Skeeter mentions¬†Krum¬†and¬†Fleur, she misspells their names and doesn't mention¬†Cedric. She also ""reveals"" that¬†Hermione¬†is Harry's girlfriend. 

Ron and¬†Hermione¬†convinces¬†Harry¬†to accompany they to Hogsmeade, though he insists on wearing his Invisibility Cloak. Hermione¬†points out¬†Hagrid, who's leaning over and talking to¬†Moody. As the two get up to leave, they make their way to trio's table and Moody mutters that he can see through Invisibility Cloaks with his magical eye. Hagrid, meanwhile, quietly asks Harry to meet him at midnight and wear the Cloak.

Harry¬†sneaks out of the common room under his Invisibility Cloak at 11:30.¬†Hagrid¬†seems excited as he greets¬†Harry¬†and leads him to the Beauxbatons carriage.¬†Madame Maxime¬†steps out, takes Hagrid's arm, and speaks as though this is a surprise for her too. Harry follows Hagrid and Maxime until they reach a clearing filled with four massive and angry dragons. 30 wizards, including¬†Charlie, try to control the creatures and finally, they Stun them. Charlie greets Hagrid, names off the different dragon breeds, and says the dragons are nesting mothers. While Harry heads back to the castle, he sees Karkaroff, who appears to be sneaking out to see the dragons. 

https://preview.redd.it/y6y3f83v4hye1.jpg?width=2030&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98ac27315fbc3a88243103fbfff9d63fa13dd75a

He arrives in Gryffindor Tower five minutes before one. When he looks at the fire, he sees¬†Sirius's face in it. Sirius warns Harry about Karkaroff, who was a Death Eater and went to Azkaban around the same time that Sirius did. He made a deal with the Ministry and now teaches the Dark Arts to his students.¬†Sirius¬†mentions all the recent Death Eater activity and¬†Bertha Jorkins, who disappeared near where¬†Voldemort¬†was rumored to be. He suggests that whoever put Harry's name in the goblet likely wants to attack Harry and make it look like an accident. He begins to tell Harry a spell to use on the dragon, but Harry hears footsteps in the place Sirius is, and Sirius disappears.

As he finishes his breakfast, Harry sees¬†Cedric¬†and realizes that he's the only champion who doesn't know about the dragons. He chases after Cedric and then tells him that the first task is dragons. Cedric asks why Harry told him and Harry says that it's just fair. Moody¬†comes and calls¬†Harry¬†to follow him to his office. Harry looks around at the items in Moody's office. He recognizes a large Sneakoscope and sees a mirror that shows only shadowy figures. Moody assures Harry that cheating is part of the Tournament and asks Harry if he has a plan to get past the dragons. Gruffly, Moody tells Harry to play to his strengths and when Harry says that he's only good at Quidditch, Moody tells him to find a spell that will let him ‚Äúget what he needs.‚Äù Later, Harry asks Ron and¬†Hermione¬†to help him master the Summoning Charm.

At lunch the next day,¬†McGonagall¬†fetches¬†Harry¬†to take him down to the stadium, sending him into a tent with the other champions.¬†Bagman¬†calls the champions to attention when he sees Harry and explains that once the audience is seated, each champion will draw a small model of a dragon out of a bag, and their task is to get the golden egg. Soon, he offers the champions the bag in turn, and Harry draws a Hungarian Horntail. Bagman then asks Harry to follow him outside and offers to help. Harry refuses and Bagman races away when he hears a whistle. 

https://preview.redd.it/sqj7bia05hye1.jpg?width=1436&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d03d6b1fb87b82968059944b626a5c96365a7485

Finally, it's Harry's turn. He focuses his mind on his Firebolt and Summons it. He leads the Horntail in diversionary tactics but suffers one cut on his shoulder from the dragon's tail spikes. Harry encourages the dragon to take off and abandon her eggs and as soon as she does, he dives and grabs the egg. Bagman shouts that Harry was the fastest champion. 

The trio returns to the common room for Harry's party. When people ask Harry to open the golden egg, he does. It's empty but a nasty wailing fills the room until Harry closes it. As Hermione accepts food from¬†Fred, she innocently asks how to get into the kitchen. He tells her but before he can warn her to not annoy the elves, Neville turns into a canary. Fred uses the opportunity to advertise his Canary Creams.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

I'm in my late 20s, and I recently ended a friendship that had started out really meaningful but took a pretty hurtful turn. Now I‚Äôm second-guessing myself ‚Äî did I overreact, or was it the right call?

This friend (I'll call him Charles) and I met through my university‚Äôs library. We clicked quickly, and over time, I opened up to him about some heavy personal stuff ‚Äî childhood trauma, family conflict, and my mental health, including some dark thoughts I‚Äôd had in the past. I genuinely believed he was someone I could trust.

Eventually, he invited me to his church group. I didn‚Äôt mind at first, but the tone gradually shifted ‚Äî especially when political talk started dominating things. I made it clear I wasn‚Äôt comfortable getting into politics, but Charles and his brother kept pushing, mostly with pro-Trump stuff. It got personal when Charles questioned if my values were just ""inherited from my dad"" ‚Äî even after I told him I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. He wouldn't let it go.

I finally told him his behavior was upsetting and that I felt I was owed an apology. Instead of texting back reasonably, he insisted on meeting in person ‚Äî but not before announcing that our friendship was ‚Äúalready over.‚Äù I showed up anyway and even got him coffee, hoping we could talk like adults. But instead of owning up to anything, he said I had low self-esteem, accused me of dragging him down to my level, and at one point told me I was ‚Äútalking like the devil.‚Äù He even tried to initiate a prayer I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with. I left feeling humiliated and decided that was it ‚Äî I cut ties.

Since then, I‚Äôve distanced myself not only from him but also from his church group and mutual connections. I thought I‚Äôd feel relief, but instead, I feel unsettled. His brother removed me on LinkedIn out of the blue, and Charles acts overly casual when we run into each other ‚Äî like nothing happened, just giving fist bumps and acting upbeat. Some mutual friends have reached out to me, but I haven‚Äôt really engaged ‚Äî just said I was busy.

Now I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he might be telling others the things I confided in him ‚Äî the deeply personal stuff ‚Äî maybe even spinning it to make me look unstable or bitter. I feel like I‚Äôve lost control over my own story, and it‚Äôs been eating at me.

Today, I saw him sitting two seats in front of me at the library (his back was facing me). When. got up to go for a drink, he quickly grabbed his stuff and moved 4 rows down and sat facing towards me. what's that all about ? How do you even process that kind of betrayal without exploding?

I don‚Äôt think these two‚Äîletter and spirit‚Äîare meant to compete. They‚Äôre meant to complement each other. The letter gives us structure, clarity, and consistency. The spirit gives us flexibility, compassion, and discernment. And together, they help us make informed, Christ-centered decisions in an increasingly complicated world.

In my own life, I‚Äôve found that relying too much on the letter can make me feel rigid or judgmental. But swinging too far the other way‚Äîalways deferring to the spirit without regard for revealed standards‚Äîcan lead to rationalizing or spiritual shortcuts. The sweet spot, I think, is learning to hold both: honoring covenants and commandments while also seeking revelation, empathy, and context.

Christ exemplified this balance. He respected the law but never let it become more important than people. His healing on the Sabbath, His interaction with the woman taken in adultery, and His teachings in the Sermon on the Mount all point to a higher law‚Äîa law written in the heart.

I‚Äôd love to hear how others approach this balance in their lives. How do you personally navigate the tension between the structure of commandments and the nuance of individual circumstances?",10,1746237068.0,latterdaysaints,8,0.86,False

1kdhs02,https://www.reddit.com/r/biglaw/comments/1kdhs02/classic_big_law_bathroom_experience/,Classic Big Law Bathroom Experience‚Ä¶,"Friday morning.  All quiet in the office.  So there I was, mounted up on the porcelain throne, handicap stall, Lenovo X2 perched on my lap, pounding out the strongest deficiency letter of my life.  You know how it goes. 

I used to be like all the underachieving associates who don‚Äôt bill BMs.  Then my mentor caused me to see the light.  He was on the partner track until suddenly he was going in-house ‚Äúto spend more time with the kids.‚Äù  We all knew what really happened though.  Too much coffee to help focus, but then too much #2 time with no billables to show for it.  The vicious cycle.  A classic big law story. 

So I vowed to take a different path.  If I couldn‚Äôt outrun the rat race, at least I could outsmart it.  Now discovery was for deuces.  Doc review was dump review.  Dookie drafts were my best ones.  And my favorite redlines were the ones I left on the TP when I wiped too hard following an intense session turning changes to a defecation disclosure.  

Anyway, I was just shifting to my next project‚Äîputting together another poop pleading‚Äîwhen someone walks into the bathroom.  I glimpse Cole Haans under the stall on their way to the urinals.  A junior, then.  I maintain my fecal focus unabated, until i notice that the junior has stopped, and is just ‚Ä¶listening.  Is this creep judging me?  

He pauses for so long that I momentarily stop typing.  I shift uncomfortably, wiping the adderall dust off my nostril in disbelief.  Who is this guy and where does he get off?  I bet he didn‚Äôt even bill an hour on the toilet this month.  Pitiful.  

He stands there for what felt like an hour (but it was actually .2, rounding up of course).  Then he drops his Fiji, which seemingly snaps him out of it.  I see hands scramble to pick up the water bottle and then he shuffles quickly out of there.

What a waste of billable time for both of us, I think bitterly.  But with a poor work ethic like this guy‚Äôs, I‚Äôll bet he had nothing better to do than return to his desk and expense the water.  Or he was waiting outside to catch a glimpse of what real productivity looks like when I leave.

Either way, I felt sorry for him.  I really did.  What so many associates fail to realize is that sure, what they say is true‚Äîit‚Äôs a pie eating contest where the reward is more pie.  But pie eating contests are just easier when you‚Äôre already on a toilet.  ",55,1746237016.0,biglaw,3,0.88,False

There were specific circumstances for our first two breakups. The first was due to a lot of drama around our shared friend group that ended with the byproduct of us breaking up. The second was due to me having a lot of issues and feeling like I couldn't handle a relationship, I regretted it soon after. 

After our second breakup he and I would call over the summer, and at one point he asked me how to impress/ask out a girl. I asked about the girl, and he--allegedly--met her at a coffee shop and apparently she was blonde. To be honest, I don't believe she actually existed. 

The next year back at school, he was definitely still hurt about our breakup and was kind of rude to me--not in an intentional way, just didn't want to talk ever. Eventually, throughout the year I heard that he still had a crush on me, but in that moment in time I had moved on. 

This year, at a school run dance, I hang around him and his friends because my friends didn't want to dance on the dance floor/be near it. I was hanging out with a friend who was somewhat close to him, and I drifted closer to him--I wasn't exactly crushing on him at the time. He seemed like he was trying to impress me because he was fidgeting with his new watch and gold cross chain like he was trying to get me to look at them/compliment them. Later on, everything was fine until I asked what products he uses for his hair--I was honestly curious--but I think he took it as me making fun of him because the kids at our school often pick on him for being so obsessed with his hair. He walked away from me after that. I just left him alone for the rest of the night from there. 

Around a month later--way after I forgot about the dance--his friends were sitting outside as my friends and I walked by and called out to me, ""Hey, \_\_\_\_, do you have a crush on \_\_\_\_\_?"" I was far enough away that I could act like I didn't hear them without being suspicious. He was also sitting at the table with them. It felt odd to me that they asked so long after the party rather than the Monday after. 

In a group project I was in, a girl from my group asked him to edit the film for us, and I ended up giving him the $30 we had agreed to give him for the work and his responses were very clipped.

She tries talking to me all the time, I noted 15 times in 1 hour. These are things such as ""I made a milkshake last night"", ""What do you think of recycled clothing a yes or a no, I buy it"", even interrupting the manager to share with me, how we are similar because of something she has noticed I do. She narrates what I am doing, gives me praise, makes assumptions about me, my motives for anything, my likes and dislikes even after correcting her. She also keeps track of my work load and what I am doing, also makes assumptions about these, ""you only changed this up because HR made you"", when no it was my own decision and design.

She has been finding jobs to do directly outside my office door, and talks really loudly, I catch her reflection in the clock and she is often peering through. She told me last week that she notices I drink coffee during lunch, that I tap my fingers when thinking, chew on my pen, and about three other things. She finished with ""I notice things about you"". and will wait to I go to leave to tell me important issues, despite talking all day.

When we speak with her about what‚Äôs going on she expresses a fear or getting lost or stolen. She confirms she‚Äôs never been left alone and knows we always come back but it‚Äôs just how she feels.

Her mom my partner and I all spoke last week regarding it and her mother too is experiencing this. Her mom explained she was about 1 minute late for picking her up from her gymnastics class and she was sobbing. She shared literally all her teammates were there putting on shoes and stuff still, and she just sat there crying. She also had the same experience I did when she took her to kick boxing. We‚Äôre all unsure where this stems from (bad dream or just a phase). She does experience anxiety more than the average kid which doesn‚Äôt help her.

Just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? And how do/did you help your child cope? We‚Äôve spoken to her about taking deep breaths and to try to calm down, and we practice these exercises, but she still has a very hard time. Just feel so bad for her

1kdhkm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kdhkm2/having_an_invisible_illness_sucks/,having an invisible illness sucks,"ive just made a question post but i need to rant. 

today, after several days of being potentially constipated and dehydrated, I have had a bad flare up day. 

I struggle greatly with my mental health, but I do not think it makes me any less capable as a person. I have the Holy Trinity - Bipolar 2/BPD/PTSD - anxiety. Alongside this I have idiopathic hypersomnia, and thus experience excessive daytime sleepiness.  I am on a most wonderful cocktail of meds!!!! Seroquel/doxepin/buspar at night, and prozac during the day for my anxiety as well as Adderall (a stimulant) to assist with the EDS from the hypersomnia. also IBS-D. 

I‚Äôve been taking my adderall this week, and well!! I was forgetting to eat!!! I am a forgetful person I suspect in large part due to my divine medicinal cocktail. I forget to hydrate as well. But wouldn‚Äôt you know it - I did not experience any symptoms from my IBS. Yesterday, I experienced the negative effects of my choices to forget eating and also to hydrate. I was in so much pain throughout the day. I was getting false triggers, I had to run out of my classroom with my bathroom pouch and ask another teacher to watch my class from the hall. And yet I sat on the porcelain throne to no avail - nothing came out. 

But, lo and behold - today I did not take my Adderall. I was rushing this morning to get to work. And it is as though my body has finally recuperated and decided that today would be the day to go. I drink coffee everyday - it is a spiritual thing for me. Typically, coffee is one of my triggers but it is a trigger I have accepted & willing to work with because I simply cannot live without it. The amount of food I had today was minimal. Two packs of ritz crackers, the small stacks. A kind protein bar, because I cannot have the protein bars I previously enjoyed since they contain milk powder, and I am lactose intolerant. And yet in the span of the work day I‚Äôd used the bathroom 4 times. Each time I experienced severe discomfort afterwards. I wanted to go home. I had to hold this urge at one point during my third period, which is my planning period - and I thought I might shit myself. The pain was so severe, I wondered to myself if I might not have enough control over my bowels to get to the bathroom. 

And yet all of this feels so fucking embarrassing to me. My students know, or they suspect already something is amiss, always asking if I‚Äôm alright once I return from the bathroom because I look ill. I‚Äôm clutching my stomach. It‚Äôs a miracle I make it through the day. And each time I come to the teachers door across from me, I feel like such a burden. üò© I feel so embarrassed. 

AND YET!!! Today my mother told me‚Ä¶ that I do not have IBS. In fact, I need to go outside and simply get my anxiety under control, and get some sunlight. And I hate that we can suffer with this‚Ä¶ being so ill‚Ä¶. and nobody knows, nobody can see it. I sometimes envy my students for having stomachs that can tolerate hot cheetos. Honey buns. Candy. What I would not give to feel the hot cheeto dust burn my throat a bit and see the red tinge on my fingers. To go out to eat with my husband and not worry about the repercussions, or wonder about lactose products or the chemicals they used to make the food. I miss having a normal stomach. Feeling normal.

1kdhiiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1kdhiiz/my_experience_vv_does_95_right_and_one_thing/,My experience VV does 95% right and one thing frustratingly wrong that hurt my experience,"I recently sailed on the VV Valiant Lady on a 5 day Dominican Daze cruise out of Miami to DR and Bimini and this es my experience:

The Vibe: My partner and I booked a lock it in sea-view terrace room due to VV being one of the only adult only cruises that seemed our speed from culture to interests, and vibe. I have to say VV hits the nail on the head here. Every person we met onboard was fantastic. I saw one dude kind of being a ‚Äúlook at me‚Äù asshole during Scarlet Night shoving his face in a service animals space only to promptly drunkenly face-plant near the pool and get escorted by crew out to be checked out and not return. Everyone else was chill. We met 20 year olds to 70 year olds that all just wanted to have a great time in their own ways but not infringe on each other‚Äôs version of what that looked like. 

The Room: So we knew that the lock it in rate could be a crapshoot, but we got a central room on the 8th floor with a gorgeous view of the water. It was a little noisy at night with some of the bars and music right below us but nothing that was an issue. And that hammock! My goodness I legitimately spent an entire sea day reading in that thing and it was amazing!

The Drink package: We opted to buy the VIP Unlimited drink package they are testing for a couple of reasons. 1. I am always calculating costs in my head and while I am a very light drinker I wanted to not think about it at all and when I knew it didn‚Äôt change the price I didn‚Äôt keep a mental tab. And 2. My partner has a hard time treating herself and for the same reason was able to pick drinks at will without trying to worry about having a $15 coffee or $17 cocktail. Did we get our money‚Äôs worth? I suspect that we didn‚Äôt even come close. (Virgin does not give a review of what was ordered when you have this package) but there were at least two of the five days I didn‚Äôt have more than one drink and the other nights were pretty tame (5-6 drinks) but I would have loved a breakdown to help with planning for bar tab on future voyages. I met a few others that opted for this package as well and no one I met was trying to make it a value by drinking more than they paid. 

The food: everything was good. Some of it was great, but none of it was bad. Brunch at Razzle Dazzle was not my fav, but dinner there was one of my highlights. Gunbae on the first night was fun an a great way to meet people, the Galley filled a need but was on par with buffet food that was made to order. The Wake & Extra Virgin were good as well but not knock my socks off good. 

Squid Ink: The tattoo shop manager (Mike) and guest artists were amazing to deal with! I got a custom piece by Andrea an artist from Italy who absolutely killed it on my ink. I got so many compliments walking around the ship afterwards it was crazy. I even had a couple of people seek me out because they heard about my tattoo from other passengers. I got a space themed octopus on my shoulder blade that could only be seen when I was in a tank top but I had to unbutton my shirt a couple of times to show people who came up and asked me about it. It was expensive but I have no issue in overpaying a bit for the level of quality I received on my newest body art addition. 

Sailor Services: An absolute nightmare to deal with. I had the extreme displeasure of having to deal with them twice. The first was on a drink overcharge. I ordered a Vodka Redbull for my partner and a beer for myself and the bartender rung it in as a shot of vodka, a can of redbull, and a beer which showed as over the two drink per order limit for the drink package. It was a minor error that cost $11, I figured sailor services could easily help solve through chat (boy was I wrong) over an hour of trying to explain the issue only to be told it needed to be disputed with the bar staff made me feel so frustrated! I don‚Äôt care that much about the $11, but I do care that it shouldn‚Äôt have been so difficult to resolve, even if that resolution would have been that is how we ring that up next time you will have to keep that in mind. (BTW it wasn‚Äôt, because we had ordered the same drink at other bars without issue both before and after this incident) 

The second was around an excursion and my fresh tattoo. My second skin had started to leak and I was worried about being in the water with it leaking. Previously the staff at squid ink had assured me that as long as the derma-shield was in place I was good to go on my snorkeling adventure. The issue is that squid ink didn‚Äôt open on the port day until well after I needed to be at the boat. Sailor services had me running all over the ship (med-bay, Shore Things, and the on ship Services in person help) it wasn‚Äôt until I found a manager and explained my issue that I got help. He hopped on the phone called the tattoo shop manager, Mike who gladly came down and reapplied a new dermatologist-skin and told me to have fun. I didn‚Äôt care if they canceled my excursion or fixed it the way they did, but if I hadn‚Äôt been insistent on finding a manager on my own I would have paid for an excursion I couldn‚Äôt go on and they wouldn‚Äôt refund me. I had already asked the tattoo shop when I scheduled my ink about this so I could cancel ahead of the refund cutoff if needed and they assured me it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. In the end it wasn‚Äôt because Mike was happy to come fix the problem when they let him know I had a leak and asked me to come back that evening so he could check it again afterwards. 


TL:DR - An amazing vibe, unpopular opinion, I hope the drink package option stays, pray you don‚Äôt need to resolve an issue with the dumpster fire that is sailor services while onboard.

1kdhi9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1kdhi9w/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

I've been posting about it online to motivate myself and possibly others as I was motivated when I first started. 

I don't have many photos of myself to reference the old me because I hid from the camera. 

I have a former coworker that my wife dislikes because she feels she was disrespected by her because at a company part she asked to try food from my plate. 

Story: I struggle a lot with posting online because I still see the obese me in photos and videos. It takes a lot for me to post the old photos of my obese self and even now since I'm not at my goal weight.

 I posted a video with old photos of myself contrasting to me today, one of the photos had the former coworker in the photo. After having posted it my wife scolded me, told me she wouldn't speak with me if I didn't redo it and crop her out. 

I told her that she was being ridiculous and asked why she would focus on my past coworker in the photo rather than the pride I had in hitting one of my goals. 

She stood her stance that ""it's about how I feel, she disrespected me."" She was the only person who showed me negativity that day and it Tucked because she's the one person I care to receive praise from. 

Fast forward she ignores me for days. Meanwhile I'm still going to grab her coffee I know she likes, she mentioned she was tired so I grabbed her Dutch bros, she was gossiping with her sister and mentioned craving sweet bread so I went to go grab it. After all these gestures and several days she comes to give me a hug and I say ""are you ready to apologize?"" She immediately was taken aback and expected me to apologize. I shut that down.

I get overwhelmed by the sheer predictability of it all. Wake up. Shower. Eat. Brush your hair. Sing. Dance. Fight. Scream. Talk. Hug. Kiss. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. Everyone seems to do the same things. They even enjoy them. And I‚Äôm just here asking: what‚Äôs the point? Have a house. Clean the house. Drive the car. Go on a trip. Everyone finds this‚Ä¶ normal.

I‚Äôm painfully normal too ‚Äî just a teenager in high school, overthinking everything. But being myself also means I can‚Äôt shut it off. I can‚Äôt not see the absurdity of how everything in life is designed to trap us in some invisible system. The way we‚Äôre expected to walk through each day a certain way. The way we‚Äôre told how to feel, when to feel, what‚Äôs acceptable to feel. It‚Äôs exhausting.

Most people seem to understand the game. They play it well. They even have fun with it. But I? I feel like a glitch in the simulation. Logically, I know I‚Äôm part of it ‚Äî I eat, I sleep, I breathe ‚Äî but emotionally, spiritually, whatever-you-want-to-call-it, I don‚Äôt feel like I belong. I romanticize everything outside of me. Other people. Other places. Objects. Animals. A person drinking coffee becomes a cinematic moment ‚Äî until it‚Äôs me drinking coffee, and suddenly it‚Äôs hollow. Flat. Almost laughable.

I envy how others slip so easily into this life. I‚Äôm angry that I can‚Äôt. I want to be able to exist without constantly realizing that I exist. That awareness ‚Äî that constant damn awareness ‚Äî it‚Äôs torture.

People feel distant. Like silhouettes. I look at them and suddenly notice the invisible walls between us, the ones we never talk about. We are permanently stuck inside ourselves, aren‚Äôt we? No matter how close we get, no one will ever be more than themselves, trapped in their own skull.

And maybe that‚Äôs the cruelest part: you‚Äôre reading this, and you‚Äôll still just be you. And I‚Äôll still be me. Separate. Noticing.",1,1746235685.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

Context: My mom‚Äôs fam is from abroad, let‚Äôs say Argentina. She is not super close to them, especially because she lived in the US for many years. It‚Äôs a small family. My grandmother had siblings, who all had kids - my grandma loved them to death but they kind of all went and did their own thing, they really didn‚Äôt deserve her. Those kids (my mom‚Äôs cousins) and their kids are my only family - so super distant, really. I live in the US with mom.

I visited them for the first time in 14 years 2 years ago. Basically I wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the country as a kid, but mow I‚Äôm 20 so I can travel. My grandmother, my closest family, passed away 2 years ago as well.  


I really, really want to get closer with my remaining family. When we go to Argentina, which is like 1 a year, we meet with them for coffee for a couple of hours. But some of these aunts I really like. Idk, I feel super guilty that I didn‚Äôt make an effort to be close to my grandma, so I feel guilty wanting to be closer to these people. And also I have my own responsibilities to worry about. And I don't visit often rn. Also, I'm a shy little shit.

I guess this is mostly a mix of rant and anxiety panic.

I'm feeling kind of at a loss with my new grinder. I was able to snag a Breville Smart Grinder Pro today but when I got it all set up and ready to go, I feel like I'm at a loss regarding the ""grind¬†*amount""*¬†setting.

The standard was 17.2/2 shots/12 grind. The grind itself seemed proper (at least compared to my old faithful hand grinder I've been using up until now), but the grind amount is like INSANELY overdialed. I'm struggling to believe how anyone uses that much coffee for a double shot because my portafilter overflowed before the grind amount timer even got halfway through the countdown.

I know the obvious answer would be to only put enough coffee beans in the hopper that I'm needing for that shot, but that pretty much defeats the purpose of buying a grinder that has such a large basket up top.

Does anyone have any ideas on what to try out? Is it really just going to be me having to measure out the grams and then reprogram it or is there a setting I'm not aware of/missing?

1kdh4en,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/1kdh4en/does_this_sound_like_sexual_assault_to_you_what/,Does this sound like sexual assault to you? What do you think? TW: sexual assault,"A few years ago I met a cop after I called the police to help me get a very drunk girl home safely from the bar. I didn‚Äôt know her, and her friends left her, which is why I had no other option. 

Anyway I ended up looking him up on LinkedIn after he drove me home from the hospital (I went with him to drop her off at the hospital- she was very sick) because I thought he was cute.

I saw he was getting his masters degree in social work at a women‚Äôs college (men can do grad programs) so I thought, oh wow, an evolved cop. 

He messaged me and said ‚Äúyou could‚Äôve just asked for my number‚Äù 

And from there, we started texting/hanging out casually- while he was working, like just doing surveillance or whatever small town cops do, I‚Äôd bring him a coffee and we‚Äôd chat. 

At the time, I was trying to live a Christian life and I told him I was planning on waiting until marriage to have sex. (Even though I wasn‚Äôt a virgin I‚Äôd been celibate like 4 years at that point. I came to religion later in life) 
He thought that was so cool, where have women like me been his whole life, etc. I also, just wasn‚Äôt ready for sex in general because I‚Äôve been SA‚Äôd many times in my life and I think my new religion was a good excuse to take a long break and think about my real feelings toward sex.

Anyway fast forward to our first official date. We went out to eat and things seemed pretty normal. Keep in mind he was completely off duty. 

He asked me to go to his car with him after we ate, just to talk. 

In the car, he had a gun openly in the center console. He made no mention of it but it was in clear sight. This was his personal vehicle. 

We start kissing, and it seems like he‚Äôs trying to push it further. Being the way I am, (a trauma survivor whose instinct is to fawn or freeze) I keep trying to keep it light and just be smiley and jokey about not wanting to progress, but was still open to kissing. 

Eventually he got me to put my hand on him, if you know what I mean, and he was grabbing my head and saying to say ‚Äúyes to daddy‚Äù 

I had not given him any signal I was into this kind of thing. If I‚Äôm honest, I was torn. Part of me reacted (physically, if you know what I mean.) but mentally I knew I didn‚Äôt want this and kept saying no. I think maybe I was partially just activated by adrenaline and fear. 

It didn‚Äôt go further than a HJ. But even that I was very reluctant to do. I eventually got him to drive me back to my car. (He had driven us somewhere more private) I told him there were too many people around or made up some other excuse, because clearly my nos weren‚Äôt working and I can‚Äôt help but think maybe jts because they were not firm enough and came across as teasing or me wanting to be dominated? 

After he left and I got into my own car, I was shaking from head to toe. Physically shaking. And I felt very dizzy, like very dissociative. Feeling that way itself was super triggering to me. 

I told him he didn‚Äôt respect my celibacy (via text) after this incident, and he kept texting me. I blocked him. 

It never occurred to me until years later, that with the gun present, and his insistence, it could be assault ish? 

I read he was accused of excessive force on a little old lady a year later (while working as a cop)

I‚Äôm 17 years old, born female. A few months ago, we had the biggest fight yet. It was February 2025. My grandma had passed away unexpectedly in September 2024, so it was already a very difficult time for me. I had also just started switching antidepressants and was in the middle of a bad depressive episode. I was feeling extremely suicidal.

I had just gotten home from school. Literally, as I opened the front door, my dad told me to look after our dogs. I responded that I would in 30 minutes because I still had my house keys in my hand and hadn‚Äôt even set my things down yet. But 30 minutes later, I accidentally fell asleep. That‚Äôs when the yelling started.

My brother came into my room and said that Dad was calling me. I asked what was going on, and my brother told me to ""get the damn dogs."" I responded, ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù in a cranky tone because I had just woken up. My dad then said, ‚ÄúDo you want to repeat that?‚Äù‚Äîwhich is his way of warning me not to use a certain tone. So I responded sarcastically, ‚ÄúSure, Dad. Let the dogs up!‚Äù I admit I shouldn‚Äôt have done that, but the argument escalated quickly. I kept asking him to drop it and let me go back to sleep.

In frustration, I texted in our family group chat that he was a ‚Äúfucking asshole.‚Äù My brother, who hadn‚Äôt heard the full argument, replied, ‚ÄúShut up, you‚Äôre in the wrong.‚Äù I was overwhelmed and in the middle of an anger episode. I stormed into his room, yelling that he only heard two sentences and didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about.

My dad came upstairs and got in my face, chest-to-chest like he usually does. I shouted that he was a weak excuse for a father and had abused me. In response, he mocked me. ‚ÄúAww really? I did that? Poor you. You gonna cry? Yeah, go cry to mommy,‚Äù he said while smirking. I told him, ‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù and he laughed as he walked away.

I completely lost it. I tried calling my mom, but she didn‚Äôt answer. I put on my shoes, yelled that I wanted to die, and ran out the back door, saying my brother could look after the dogs. I walked by the dike near our house for over an hour in 3¬∞C weather, wearing just pajama pants and a tank top with no sweater.

Later, my mom texted me to come home and said my dad was in his room. I came back and locked myself in my room. That night, I relapsed after being eight months clean from self-harm. I was so ashamed.

The next day, I had therapy. Then on Monday, my dad sent me a message (attached image). That night we had a ‚Äúfamily meeting‚Äù to talk about everything. It went terribly. No one listened to me except for my mom. My dad twisted my words, saying I told him I wished he were dead‚Äîwhich I absolutely did not say. My brother backed him up, insisting I did. It only escalated. My dad kept rolling his eyes while I spoke, and eventually I told my mom I needed to leave because I couldn‚Äôt be around them anymore. My dad sneered, ‚ÄúYeah, run away like you always fucking do.‚Äù

I went to my room and texted my mom that I needed to be admitted to a mental health facility or I was going to end my life. The next day, we met with my therapist and began working on a safety plan.

Things are somewhat better now, but my dad never apologized. I‚Äôm still forced to get coffee with him every week, and it feels like torture. He constantly tries to start arguments, and while I‚Äôve been learning in therapy how to disengage, it‚Äôs exhausting. I‚Äôm doing so much hard emotional work in therapy to become a better person‚Äîbut he refuses to go to therapy because he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want someone telling him he‚Äôs wrong.‚Äù

That said Switch 1 has made it possible for me to more comfortably and conveniently play video games I‚Äôve thought of playing but didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not a hard core gamer. I‚Äôve got a series S and I‚Äôve played many hours of it on my TV; but while I play on my couch I can‚Äôt curl up. With the Switch I can. Also I can play in my favorite coffee shop, bar, park bench or waiting in a doctor‚Äôs office. 

With Switch 2 I‚Äôm hoping we see developers embrace the console even more so than they did the Switch. Sure I could have gotten one of the Steamdeck consoles or other windows based consoles but I prefer simplicity and those seem anything but. 

Now we have a bigger screen coming. A few big name AAA games that while not brand new aren‚Äôt old. The system while mobile seems to have the ability to play these games decently, with the obvious compromises but not so much as the game won‚Äôt be fun. The Witcher 3 showed me the Switch can be worthwhile console. 

By the way, I‚Äôve never played connected to a TV. I have an Xbox Series S for that. I play either with the joy cons connected or in tabletop mode. Which I think will be even better with the bigger screen. Currently own a Switch OLED and my Switch 2 is slated for a launch day delivery.

What i can say is i garuntee its not related to anything you are thinking lol. They are the colors of a coffee related organization in another country.

I pulled every pipe and fitting off of the machine. Inspected both boilers and removed the steam boiler for descaling. The brew boiler had very little scale as expected and i did a light descaling with it still in the frame but all the fittings removed and capped except a ball valve for draining. Steam boiler had heavy scale.

Still had a mechanical thermostat installed. And while it was the best looking shape mechanical thermostat ive seen. The part is no longer supported and made the decision to upgrade to a pid.

The wiring to the pump and plug was absolutely fried. The stranded copper was stiff and the insulationg surronding it crumbled when trying to bend or move the wiring. Same thing for all the terminal blocks and terminal connectors. So all of that got replaced. There was some discrepancies between the wiring diagram and how the machine was wired but that all got sorted out. No safety thermostat for the steam boiler, so i got one installed.

Heres a few pics. I wish i took more of the process but honestly i was just busy jumping in and getting it done.

This is my first post on Reddit, this might be long, but I'm gonna try to keep it short but include important details.
I believe my mom is dealing with a phrogging situation. Here's some backstory:
My parents separated in 2017 and my mom moved back to her home state until last year. She was dealing (and living) with a very toxic ex so me and my family helped her move back. She's now living at the original family home (my parents are better friends than partners so everything's gucci lol) to better her footing as of 2024. My dad works out of state so he's not home a lot. I purchased my first home, and moved out about 3 months before she came back. Therefore, the family house was empty of people for that long. I was also checking on it physically every other day to ensure it's security. It also had security cameras at that time too.

Okkaaaayyyy now to the phrogging. Over the course of time from her moving back to now, there's been very suspicious activity that mostly she and I have seen. Wires being rerouted in the attic (we have two entrances to the attic: garage and hallway), boards being moved around, the garage attic small square hatch being left wide open when it hasn't been moved in like 15yrs, random sheet rock paint splatters in random places, small trim being removed and restapled in place, bangs and shuffling coming from both sides of attics, I've also noticed I lost control of security cameras so we had to remove them, wifi being used so she canceled the wifi and her phone also being hacked. She recently noticed large shoeprints in the carpet of her bedroom leading to her closet. There's just so much..  

 As of the last few weeks, now things in the kitchen are messed with. Brand new milk and orange juice being opened over night and have a little missing, bread slices missing from loaf, dishes being moved, a lid from a coffee cup from a convenient store being left on the counter (my mom doesnt drink coffee) and so much more, I swear it's endless. The only thing we caught, was from 2 trail cameras we bolted in the attic. 1 caught a flash light glare and the other is missing the Sim card.We have before and after pictures of EVERYTHING from disposable cameras that has changed as well and random things we've found when they weren't there before.

We are at a loss. No wifi. No security cameras and my mom has a barely working phone. Cops will also not do anything unless we have video evidence of someone entering the house and will also not check the house and attic. We've searched ourselves even in places that can't fit a person.

My mom's mental health is stable, evaluation is clear so she's not suffering mentally to imagine these things. We also cannot afford a private investigator. Our next step are cameras that work off of cellular data (not with her phone, but mine). No one believes us.

I'm leaving A LOT out because it's a years worth of head scratching. If you have any questions, I will gladly answer. Any advice will help SO much. And if you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading and I apologize for the novel. This is my last resort :/

1kdgysw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Voicesofthevoid/comments/1kdgysw/electrical_plug_randomly_stopped_working/,Electrical plug randomly stopped working,"So yesterday (may 1st) I was in process of making a specific spot for kerfus. The electrical plug in the back corner by the lockers of the main work room is where I always put a coffee pot for the plug on the right, and a kerfus charging station for the plug on the left. After building kerfus his rage cage (to prevent him from just VANISHING on me during a certain event) with brick walls and a basketball hoop to contain his wheel, I plugged him in and had no issues. I was able to plug, unplug, charge, all that with ease. I left him plugged in when I got off for the night.

I loaded back in today, played for a while before a server needed fixing, went to unplug him, and saw he was already unplugged. weird, considering I know I left him plugged in last time I played. Whatever he was full charge, no biggie, send him off to do his thing, he's gotta go all the way to romeo or something, real far away, so he comes back with a good chunk of battery missing. Put him in his cage, go to plug him in... and it will not plug.

At first I thought it was maybe a bug with the wall I built. There's like a good couple inches between the wall and the plug, but who knows, I sure don't, so I broke down the side wall of his cage and attempted to plug him in again. Nothing. The plug just kept behaving as if there was no plug there, poofing back into it's retracted state.

So then I unplugged the coffee machine, and tried plugging THAT into the buggy outlet. Did not work. I could plug kerfus into the right side outlet where the coffee machine had been plugged in, but the left side plug was just borked.

this is a very odd bug, especially considering I had just installed the latest stable version a couple days ago, this is a brand new save (just with money cheated in) and I don't have any mods or anything going on that SHOULD break this specific plug. I have no idea if it's a known issue or something for this build.

All I do know is that kerfus and his rage cage are gonna have to be moved somewhere else. >:C

All my muscles were so relaxed, I was unable to hack up the phlegm. I felt like I was drowning.  I ended up making coffee and eating halls menthol drops to try to keep my airways dilated.  Only around 8 am is when the effects started subsiding.

I mean a genuine big budget Hollywood blockbuster with YEARS of pre-production in order to nail every single detail.

I say this because the story and narrative is very well written and layered so a faithful adaptation would be interesting given the creative elements of the world.

For instance stuff like:

* The different ethnicities of all the main characters being an early clue toward the fact that they were essentially an exiled race.
* The difference in language between Eldian and Marleyian.
* The lack of understanding from our main cast for certain things that pop up in the show (how they've never seen monkeys or primates before because they're not native to the island so they refer to Zeke's titan as a ""beast"")
* Or how they'd never seen coffee before investigating Zeke's camp on the wall (in Shiganshina, S3) because coffee beans don't grow on their island.

I think the main use of a live action adaptation would be to clear discrepancies english viewers had when engaging with the show. I say this because AOT is such a dense story I personally believe that non-japanese speakers are actually unable to completely 100% comprehend it (maybe the closest we'll get is like 97% or something cause things ALWAYS get lost in translation). Anyway, this is all wishful thinking but if it did ever get adapted - these are the main elements I would have liked for them to include.",2,1746234321.0,ShingekiNoKyojin,8,0.75,False

It seems to be an endless struggle without the whole world being involved. After all, life is boiling, even without your active presence in it.

I have my own burdens that are rooted deep in the past, in my childhood. It's as if a hole was dug for me, but I refused to be buried. And then comes a dilemma in the form of - obsessive daydreams of a good future. It's as if this lingering thought has lodged itself on my cerebral cortex, convincing me that everything will come in time. That I deserve happiness and love by the fact of existence, that I love the world and the people in it, love myself and my body, love my family, and the guys I gave every gram of myself to, even if I didn't have to do that shit.

But also, I see the world, I feel it, and there is no whole happiness in it, only sheer dysfunction. I could go on listing my resentments for a long time, but I think you yourself understand our human habitual vices that are not common to all and many.

What leaves me in this world are the little things. A fucking sweet coffee or a sunny morning accompanied by good music, but these little things are so non-global and quickly forgotten that they make me live only in this moment and not in the future.

I'm a coward who can't kill herself. I know I would be mourned, but I know many would forget because they have a whole life to live. Fuck...I don't even know what to add. I don't even know why I'm writing this, maybe I'm just venting my pity for myself and my inner unloved child that my folks didn't bother to apologize to?

I don't know, but what I do know is that I still live thanks to my inner optimism, which is like an endless supply, like fuel.

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.
