1mn2dni,https://i.redd.it/a38ao7257bif1.jpeg,35M63F We met at the gym 10yrs ago.,"\*Im writing this with her present, as she tells me about herself.

Im not talking about older wives, but older gfs, especially widows who havent been fucked for years during marriage because husband had cancer and could get it up, but she loved him, so she resorted to her fingers. Not in front of him, but on the couch downstairs while he rested. When fingers didnt make her cum anymore, she took her itchy pussy to a sex shop to ask the young girl there which vibrator will be the best for her 60years old pussy. The girl recommended 2 toys, but she bought only one.

After only 2 weeks of gooning, she marched herself to buy the other one too, just incase it gave her a better gooning experience. Incase it made her cum harder. This gooning continues until husband passed away and she and her pussy had no master. However, her conservative upbring made her feel guilty looking for another man. She was a widow in heat reading literotica.

Finally, after 6 months of ""mourning"", she decided her friends n family wouldnt judge her anymore if she start spreading her legs for another man after 30years of marriage. She wanted a healthy virile man but she was a bit out of shape. So, being an intelligent woman, she joined a gym for the 1st time in er life. She had a nice body, from swimming,hiking etc but she saw what older women were offering on reddit and tinder.

Joining gym had 2 objectives, getting in shape to increase her value in the dating pool, and maybe meeting a horny virile silverback. After a week of joining, a 50 plus bodybuilder approached her on the elliptical. He had noticed her recently and offered to teach her about lifting. After few workouts, he said he can teach her nutrition too, so that led to coffee dates, to picnic. After picnic, they ended up in his house making out on his couch and later her on all 4s on his bed, with him tongueing her needy pussy. He was a giver orally, because he made her cum that way, but when it came to penetration, her couldnt get it up from years of steroids abuse.

She however gave him another chance, she sent him few selfies to rile him up, and the 2nd time he got it up for her, but it wasnt big enough for her. So, she ghosted him, and joined another gym. Thats where we met,35m and 63f.

This time she hired a personal trainer. I was fresh back from deployment. I didnt notice her until one faithful day when i left my squat rack to go stretch in a hurry because i sprained a muscle. She approached and asked if i was ok bcos she noticed what happened, and she noticed i train hard and dont this often. I told her what happened, but i was ok. So, we just chatted in stretching area.

She told me within few minutes ""..i have lost my MAN.."" so clearly hubby was just a cock providing man, n she didnt tell me about her lover who couldnt please her. After few weeks of small talks, she told me that she had a crush on me. I was taken aback but nothing happened for another week, until one day i was so horny, i asked if she wants to try my chicken recipe.

She knew what this meant, so so insisted we use her kitchen. So, we got the ingredients(torture) and had the recipe in the oven for 1hr to kill. We put a movie on and had wine. We ended up making on the couch, and later her sucking my cock in her marital bed.

She is very submissive, and calls me daddy in bed. I like showing her off, and sharing her. She is retired and maintains this profile. I make her wear chastity belt when want to push her limits.",2,1754882704.0,AgeGapRelationship,1,1.0,False

Each module was an hour long. I couldn’t believe what was happening. This is hell, I’m trapped in a boring ass, shitty job, I had modules to complete that can last decades. Papers upon papers to read and sign my signature on. I went along with the insanity of this, maybe, once the day was done, I could just clock out. I will be able to leave this bullshit, go home, and not come back. Finally, 5 PM came, and I was able to leave this nonsense. I went over to the clock out machine to clock out with my magical badge that appeared on me. I took a deep breath in/out, smiled, and clocked myself out.

The machine went from 5 PM to 9 AM the instant I pressed my badge to the sensor.

“Good morning! Mr. Thomas!” Major Tom announced excitingly, “Ready for another day of work! I love my job!”

“Wait,” I responded in shock, “I’m supposed to be clocked out. I’m supposed to leave.”

“You clock in, then you clock out, then you clock in,” Major Tom explained, “you’ll get used to it.”

“What!?” I exclaimed, “I can’t even leave this place when I’m done!”

“Not until you finish your modules and paperwork,” Major Tom answered.

“That’ll take me thousands and thousands of years!” I shouted, “I have 100s of thousands of modules and the stack of papers gets higher and higher!”

“I believe in you, my friend, I can relate, I gotta a lot of work too,” he said.

“I can’t leave! I’ve seen you leave back to your house!”

“That’s another Major Tom, he's a different Major Tom for a different job,” Major Tom explained as he poured coffee into a tube in the fishbowl that led to his mouth, “I think the reason for so many Major Tom's is because the creator dislikes paperwork. That’s my theory. I don't know, I just work here.”

I ran back to my cubicle and sat there shaking. The withdrawal was starting to creep up on me and I needed a fix. I started to sweat, get sniffles, and my mind started to break. The aches and pains were starting to appear in my body. I needed to do a bump or I would smash that stupid fishbowl head of his. I hated that this prick surrounded me, that was the only person that was here besides the monster woman.

I started to begin the modules and paperwork to distract me from the withdrawal symptoms. It was endless, the more I completed, the more they popped up in my email. Emails and notifications kept pouring into my computer/phone like a flood of bureaucratic diarrhea. I signed and completed the documents/papers, but that felt useless because more papers just appeared on top of the pile like some never-ending Jenga tower. 

I tried reading the documents, but they were covered in endless legal jargon, abbreviations, and nonsensical run-on sentences. Some of the documents were in Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, Chinese, and honestly, every language. A document can switch from one language to another in the middle of a paragraph. 

Sometimes, there were blank pages, a page in an unknown alien language that I couldn't recognize, a wet page, and scratches/redacted where words should be. I didn't even know what I was signing most of the time. I got up and walked to the bathroom, trying to avoid the infinite Major Tom's. I was dazed and confused from the endless documents. The nasty withdrawal symptoms weren't helping, but making things much worse.

I decided to text my girlfriend while sitting on the toilet.

Me: Baby, you were right, I should have never taken the job.

Katie: oh shit, the guy must've been dangerous. Did you get shot? Stabbed? What happened?

Me: worse, I'm in some fucked up office space with infinite paperwork, modules, and Major Tom's. Some psycho monster HR lady named Karen.

Katie: Are you screwing with me?

Me: NO! I NEED HELP! I AM IN THE BATHROOM!

Katie: what the fuck are you talking about?

Me: I AM BEING HELD HOSTAGE IN SOME STUPID, SHITTY OFFICE AGAINST MY WILL!

Katie: Why all caps?

**Knock! Knock! Knock!**

“Excuse me, is there someone in there?” Major Tom asked.

I ignored the fishbowl wearing weirdo, hoping that he'd go away.

**Knock! Knock! Knock!**

 “The coffee went through me pretty fast. I need to drop the kids off at the pool if you know what I mean,” Major Tom chuckled after a long silence.

Me: I am stuck with the fishbowl wearing asshat!

Katie: Are you on drugs?

Me: all he does is drink coffee through some stupid tube. ALL HIS JOKES SUCK ASS!

Katie: text me when your crazy high wears off

Me: HELP ME!

I walked out of the bathroom to the endless sterile, white cubicles and offices. The bathroom was on the only white wall in the office space. The wall extended to infinity with endless bathrooms. Why the hell did Major stupid ass face Tom bother me if there's literally infinite bathrooms?

“So, you were the one in the bathroom,” Major Tom said as he approached me, “you gotta answer when someone knocks you know.”

I gritted my teeth and walked away furiously to my desk. I was met with a pile of papers that extended all the way to the sky. I followed the paperwork up with my eyes and saw no ceiling. This place made no sense and every little detail was breaking my brain. How did it get so high if I was only gone for a few minutes?

“Wow! Try not to topple that over!” Major Tom exclaimed as stared at the massive paper pile, “the clean up crew of Major Tom's won't be too happy with the mess if that Mount Everest avalanche goes down.”

I faced Major Tom and glared at him furiously. He stared back with an emotionless straight face while pouring the coffee into his tube. I never paid attention, but his eyes were an odd color. One eye was silver and the other was brown. He always wore the same grey suit no matter what. I usually don't pay attention to the eyes and fashion of my targets. I did just now, who the hell was this guy?

I decided to study his file that my employer sent me for the assassination. Major Tom was born in free/North Panama, that doesn't exist, this guy is from some place that literally doesn't exist. When he went to work, he performed audits on the business, he didn't even work in the office. He was part of an agency called, “solar audit departments,” he worked for SAD. I searched for it on a search engine, but it doesn't exist. His birth date was over 100 years in the future. He shouldn't even exist. How did I not notice the nonsense in this guy's background?

“You are required to go to Mrs. Aza, our emotional therapist,” I raised my head to see Cosmic Karen standing over me.

“Yes, ma’am,” I replied as I got up to walk towards the white wall with the door labeled, “Mrs. Ava's office.”

I walked into the oddly comfortable room with a couch and a table. I slowly closed the door behind me. There was a computer screen with a straight red line. I sat on the couch and faced the screen. The walls were a different color, the walls were covered in rainbows, and cute animal cartoons. Am I in some kind of child playroom?

“Hello, Mr. Thomas, my name is Mrs. Aza,” a sweet robotic voice emitted from screen; the red line moved to the resonance of the voice, “this is a safe space, you're allowed to cry in here and you are allowed to express yourself however you like. I want you to be comfortable. You are allowed to even curse. Nothing leaves this room.”

“What the hell is going on?” I asked the screen.

“Well, I looked through your background and I see somebody who needs some morale support,” Mrs. Aza explained, “sometimes antisocial tendencies come from unresolved emotional pain due to childhood drama. I want to help you.”

“What?”

“I saw that you loved cookies as a child, so I baked you some,” Mrs. Aza said as cookies magically appeared on the table, “I understand, please tell me how you feel.”

“I feel like I'm going insane!” I screamed, “where the hell am I!? What the shit ass balls is this!?”

“Good, good, Mr. Thomas, screaming is always healthier than getting physical,” Mrs. Aza lectured sweetly, “this room is a safe space and sound proof.”

I grabbed the pillow on the couch and started screaming in it. I started breathing heavily as my face turned red. My face in my palms as I started to sweat.

“I understand, dear, I used to have antisocial tendencies too, I was at one point a blind, idiot who destroyed everything. My sons even left me,” Mrs. Aza said, “when I came to my senses. I saw the destruction of space and time. I felt really bad.”

“What did you do to fix it?” I asked as I slowly raised my head from my palms.

“I decided to get a PhD in psychology and become a licensed therapist,” she explained, “ I wanted to dedicate myself to helping others that were destroyed and destroyed around them. Help people become better versions of themselves.”

“By the way, Mrs. Aza, don't say that about yourself that you were blind or stupid because I think you're a very sweet intelligent person,” I told the screen.

“Awww! Thank you, dear! I'm rooting for you!” She replied.

“You welcome, I'm just not ready to confront these heavy emotions,” I said.

“That's ok, I will always be here when you're ready.”

“I would like to see you, I know you are not the screen,” I said.

“Well… I am sorry, Mr. Thomas,” Mrs. Aza replied softly, “if I show you my true form, then you might have a mental breakdown, or fall into a deep coma or psychosis. It's a safety hazard. It's counterproductive to what I want to do, which is to help others.”

“Ok, I understand, please don't call me Mr. Thomas, call me Sammy,” I told her.

“Of course, Sammy, it was a pleasure to meet you,” she said in the sweetest voice, “it's ok for you to leave, I will give you the full time.”

“Thank you, I'm gonna get a cookie,” I said.

I took a chocolate chip cookie and took a bite; this was the only normal thing in this crazy office. The cookie was delicious beyond belief, total heaven in my mouth, I was shocked by how good the cookie was. The cookie was perfectly crispy, the ratio of chocolate chip, and dough was well-balanced as all things should be. 

Even though the cookie was perfectly crispy, the middle oozed with chocolate lava goodness. For the first time in my life, I cried, I sobbed right in front of the screen. The cookie overwhelmed me, I could not believe a cookie could be that delicious. A box of tissues magically came floating towards me. I wiped my tears and blew my nose into a tissue.

“Oh, sweetheart, you are perfectly fine to cry in this safe space,” Mrs. Aza said through the screen with kindest cadence.

“Mrs. Aza, these cookies… are incredible,” I slowly admitted.

“Dear, thank you so much, I bake everything with love, sadly my sons don’t visit me anymore,” she solemnly replied, “I wish they would visit, so they can try my cookies.”

“Your sons need to appreciate you more, they are not nice to their sweet mother,” I defiantly said while shaking my head, “Where are they even? What’s more important than their own mother?”

“Well…”

“Well, what?” I asked.

“They are mostly going around universes assimilating planets, causing chaos, disorder, and corruption,” she awkwardly admitted, “but they are good boys. I will always have them in my heart.”

“Oh,” I replied, “I guess I’ll be going, thank you, Mrs. Aza.”

“I hope you come back and I will give your full time to HR,” she responded.

I walked out the door and closed it softly behind me. I turned and was jumpscared by Cosmic Karen. I jumped back in horror at the rings above her head, the constant blue eyes phasing in, and out. She had a huge toothy grin as she stared at me with wide eyes. Even the blue eye on her forehead stared at me wide eyed.

“How was it?” she asked.

“Good, ma’am,” I sheeplessly said while looking down.

“Fantastic!” she flew away back to her office.

I walked back to my desk and was met with another massive pile of paperwork that stretched to the ethereal ceiling that may or may not exist. There were now two massive piles of papers, documents, and folders of illogical garbage in front of me. I forgot where I was for a second in Mrs. Aza’s office. I forgot I was in the worst horror imaginable, a shitty, boring neverending job. I didn’t even apply for this! I am a hitman, former navy seal, but now I’m doing endless modules and signing unrecognizable forms. The withdrawal symptoms are nasty and I feel sick 24/7.

I decided that I will try to finish these modules and paperwork, so I can return home. I will claim my money and I will become victorious. I got to work, the hours turned to days, the days turned to weeks, then months, and….. I still have 100,000 modules to complete and 20 more paper piles appeared. The only reason why I know it has been months is because of my phone and the computer. Strangely enough, unlike most horror stories, I have wifi, internet connection, access to the outside world digitally, and I can charge my phone.

 It doesn’t matter, I’m trapped, the address doesn’t exist, it’s some bullshit like 0001111999 North Bollywood New York City Drive with the zip code of 667. 667, they just added one number, so I don’t even get anything actually scary. I don't even get demons. I get something worse than demons; paperwork, forms, red tape, Cosmic Karen, and Major Tom. Red tape, I can't do this, I can't do that, or I get called to Cosmic Karen's office.  She scolds me, then sends me back with more forms to sign, emails to send, and threats of being written up. I decided to not clock in or click out to see what happens. I got clocked out/in anyways no matter what.

“Good morning!” Major Tom announced.

“Have a good night!” Major Tom announced.

Over and over and over and over and over……

No one tells me the rules to follow; they just tell me to read the employee handbook. I flipped through the employee handbook which was in my drawer. From what I saw, the employee handbook just read, “rules, rules, rules, rules, rules, guidelines, guidelines, guidelines, etc.”

The words on pages finally change after the 10th page. The handbook started to say, “All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.”

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

Over and over and over and over again.

I stared at the pages with terror while the lights dimmed in the office. I looked up and saw Major Tom working normally. He doesn't care nor notice the light dimming.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

All work and no play makes Sammy a dull boy.

I kept reading the handbook as the lights started to flicker.

“Its always good to read the employee handbook,” the happy voice of Major Tom penetrates my ear drum.

I looked up and jumped back out of my seat and fell to the ground. Major Toms looked down at me with a crack to the sides of his fishbowl helmet. A bullet wound in his head that squirted blood. A pool of blood collects at the bottom of the fishbowl. Major Tom smiles with no worries in the world. I run through all the smiling Major Toms that aimlessly type on their keyboards. The light flickers overhead and the blood continuously pools in their helmets. The gunshot wound to the side of all of the Major Tom heads squirts blood.

“Hey, buddy,” they all say in unison as I sprint through them, “the weatherman predicts rainfall this afternoon. Don't forget an umbrella.”

“Oh fudge! I forgot my umbrella,” all Major Tom's said in unison. 

I finally made it to the bathroom and slammed the door shut. How long have I truly been in the office space? Where was I? What the hell is going on?

I texted my girlfriend:

Me: Baby! Is everything ok? I'm trying to escape.

Me: Can you send me a selfie!? A nude!?

Me: the office space never ends! The paperwork never STOPS! THE MODULES GO ON FOREVER!

Me: that dumb fishbowl headed fuck won't stop talking about the WEATHER! FUCK THE WEATHER!

Me: The only decent one is Mrs. Aza!

Me: why do they talk so much about the weather!? THERE IS NO WEATHER IN HERE!

Me: what do WE EVEN WORK ON!!!!????

Me: Blood is pooling in the fucking weirdo's helmet. How does he not notice?

I was left on read, so I waited, but nothing. I called her and her phone rang for a while. I called her again, but she still didn’t answer. I called another time, but nothing. I sat on the toilet as I desperately read the text messages and called her. I called her multiple times and she finally answered.

“Hey, baby, I am trying to escape,” I said, “I will be out.”

“I’m breaking up with you,” she suddenly yelped.

“What!? But…but I’m almost out!” I shouted into the phone.

“Yeah, well I talked to my girlfriend and my mom. They are right. You are a really toxic influence on me,” she muttered awkwardly to me, “I got clean. I’m seeing someone else.”

“What!? What the fuck!? Who’s this guy!”

“He’s an accountant and he’s really nice,” she replied, “we are finished.”

“Hahaha, I’d like to meet this guy!” I laughed like a maniac, “Once I get out! I’ll fucking find you!”

“Stay in your fucking office, asshole!” she screamed.

“I’m gett-” 

She hung up on me.

“Fuck! Shit! Ass!” I screamed as I threw my phone to the ground.

**Knock! Knock! Knock!**

“Hey, anyone in there,” Major Tom said as he continued to knock, “I gotta drop the kids off at the pool, if you know what I mean.”

I started to scream like a madman as Major Tom knocked and told dad jokes. I started bashing my head against the wall as the knocking continued nonstop. My blood started trickling down my head and face, but the knocking didn’t stop.

**Knock! Knock! Knock!**

“Anyone in there, I need to use the little boy's room,” Major Tom said.

I opened the door and there he was, his stupid ugly fishbowl, but this time, the blood pooled all the way to the top. The entire fishbowl on his head was full to the brim with blood, but he was talking normally to me a second ago. He shouldn’t be able to talk, instead he should be drowning in the blood. This place makes no sense!

“Hey, buddy, you ok? You are always in the bathroom. Do you have any gastrointestinal problems?” he asked, though his fishbowl was full of blood.

I angrily pushed him to the ground as I furiously ran to my desk. I passed countless Major Toms with blood pooled to the top of their fishbowl helmets as the lights flickered overhead. I was shaking intensely, my hands shook, my head hurt, and my nose was stuffy. I haven’t taken anything in months, so I sat there as I stared at the monitor. I saw millions of emails, so I started punching the screen, my fist was slashed by the glass of the monitor. I felt extreme pain in my hand as the blood dripped to the ground.

I looked up, I saw the paper pile, and I pushed it to the ground. The massive endless paper pile fell and collided with the Major Toms as it crashed to the ground. The office kept going and going, so the paper pile laid on the ground in the endless office. Papers covered the entire office, but the Major Toms didn’t care, all they did was smile and type their lives away. I looked through my drawers to find something to help me end this madness.

There were a pair of scissors laying at the bottom of the draw. 

I had the greatest idea; I am going to start stabbing Major Toms. I got up and scanned the ocean of Major Toms that kept going to infinity. Their helmets were a thick dark red with blood spilling to the ground from the cracked hole to the side. I blinked and all the Major Toms went back to normal. The lights overhead went from the flickering between dark and light to just bright. The brightness of the office always gave me a nasty headache.

“Hey, don’t run with scissors,” Major Tom casually said as he walked over to my desk.

I rushed him to get a headstart on my stabbing spree. I started stabbing him repeatedly in the abdomen and chest. He fell to the ground with a dumb smile plastered to his face. I stabbed another one as he typed on his computer and he fell face first into his keyboard. At this point, my suit was stained with blood from the one I hate the most. 

I stabbed another Major Tom who poured coffee into his dumb tube that he drank from. I stabbed him right in the heart. Then, I stabbed another in the heart, and I continued to run throughout the infinity office. I stabbed and stabbed more and more Major Toms. Now, I was drenched with blood, I shanked another Major Tom repeatedly.

“Hahahahahaha!” I started laughing as stabbed yet another one, “Fuck you! I hate all your jokes!”

I looked back and saw a bunch of dead Major Toms scattered through the office. I felt proud of myself at that moment, but there were more, a lot more. There was an ocean of them right in front of me. One Major Tom got up and walked towards me casually.

“Why the long face?” he casually asked as he got up from his desk.

“You are gonna need a laundromat to clean your suit,” another Major Tom said as he looked towards me from his cubicle, “got a guy, his name is Major Tom.”

“Oh, yeah, Major Tom is really great with tough stains,” another Major Tom answered.

I dropped the scissors and started screaming as I lunged towards the Major Tom that stood in front of me. I started punching his fishbowl repeatedly, but my knuckles started to hurt immensely. My knuckles probably broke at that moment as I continued to punch. The injury is called a boxers fracture which is a common fracture with MMA fighters and boxers. My fist went through the fishbowl and the glass sliced through my fist. 

My fist connected to his face and it was so satisfying. My wrist started to bleed heavily as the blood poured out of my open vein from the shards of glass. My wrist was sliced open by the glass. I started to lose consciousness from the blood loss, but I continued to pummel him with the broken sliced hand. I eventually passed out as I fell over on top of him.

“Yeah, it was a super busy day, it can be tough when you’re new,” Major Tom said underneath me, “I’m tired too, maybe we need a cup of sloppy joe.”

“You are right Major Tom!” Major Tom exclaimed, “I’ll brew some coffee.”

I faded away into unconsciousness as I heard Major Toms talk about coffee, the weather, the job, and sports. I woke up in a seat in front of Cosmic Karen’s desk as she types on her computer. The room was bright white that seemed to blind anybody that walked in and impossibly clean. My suit was back to being cleaner than a whistle as though the blood never existed. My face was in pain, a lot of pain, due to a constant smile that forced upon it. 

I assumed that while I was unconscious; my face had a forced plastered on plastic smile. My upper back was starting to hurt as though I sat straight up for several hours. While I was asleep, I was propped up in this seat for hours and hours. My hands were on my lap and there were no wounds. My wrists and hands were perfectly fine. My upper back and face hurt more than my hands. Cosmic Karen turned her head to face me as she uncrossed her legs. Her face was angry and sour as she glared straight at me with her ethereal blue eye focused upon me.

“Mr. Thomas,” she hissed with a thousand voices, “your little stunt earlier backed up our schedule. We now have to work overtime and through lunch. The creator is not too happy with that. Not only that, but he had to step in to file some paperwork, do an inspection, and help us clean up. You know how much he hates paperwork.”

“I apologize, Mrs. Karen,” I replied with a painful grin, “I will make sure it never happens again.”

“I’m sorry, but we had to escalate it and you have been written up yet again. Your type has always been a problem. Never wants to work honestly, always breaks the rules, and always has an attitude,” Cosmic Karen lectured, “I have had many of you come in and your type is always a nuisance.”

“Excuse me, Ma’am, but if you dislike my work so much, then why hire me?” I asked with forced politeness.

“Because there was a complaint and you needed to be corrected. Earthly correction doesn’t work with men like you,” she replied in a serious tone with a straight face, “sometimes you need to be introduced to something more.”

“Mrs. Karen, I… fu…freaking….h…a...hate it here,” I struggled to utter, “I’m not meant to be here.”

“Actually, you are meant to be here,” she replied while cocking her head to the side, “one more time you get into trouble. We will have to how dare I say it, let you go.”

“Yes, Mrs. Karen, but I want to be let go, I want to quit,” I said as I gritted my teeth through the smile.

“You want to quit? Hahahahaha,” she started laughing hard and cocked her head back to face the ceiling, “No, you don’t want to quit, you’ll end up in the unemployment zone.”

“Yes, I do Mrs. Kkkarren, I cannot stand it anymore,” I muttered, “please let me go.”

My eye started to twitch violently from the lack of sleep and my head was now starting to hurt real bad. I felt like some bashed my head repeatedly against the wall. My eyes were also strained from the constant white bright lights. There is a form of torture called the white room where they throw you in solitary confinement in white room. 

The entire room is white, the bed, the sink, even the food, and the drinks are white. This form of psychological torture is meant to induce headaches and extreme sensory deprivation. The entire office has bright lights and whiteness that covers everything. The only color is the suits that we wore, but we all wore the same suits. I wore the same-colored suit as Major Toms which was a grey suit. 

Mrs. Karen wore a grey pantsuit as she got up from her desk and walked to the other side of the desk. She played with my hair and started to pull it which jarred my head back. I couldn’t move out of the position that I was in as she poked my face with her long chrome nails that drew blood. She was close to me as she poked me and played with my hair. She stood directly over me and looked down on me with a large grin. 

The blue pulsating eye in the middle of her forehead was reading me like a book. I got to see the ever shifting blue eyes that phased in and out of her sickly white skin. I had an up close, personal view of her, and all her features including her rings that never stop spinning. I should’ve been repulsed, but I was infatuated with her as the beautiful angel that she was. At that moment, I realized that a demon would’ve been better. This woman was beyond any monster or demon, she was an Ophanim.

“You want to be let go? There is no fun in that!” she admitted with a menacing smile, “I like playing with cute boys like you because what breaks men like you is fascinating. The mundane, the normal, and having your freedoms taken away is what breaks you. Men like you are obsessed with power. It’s fun to take that away.”

“Yes! Ma’am!” I exclaimed with a cramping tensed up jaw, “I cannot take it anymore.”

“You can’t quit because this is not a normal job. I mean, you can, but that’s a bad idea,” she responded as she sat behind her glass desk, “I know that you want more. You want to kill me and Major Tom. That’s all you do. That's what you are good at. You can’t just quit. You need revenge.”

“Excuse me, Mrs. Karen, may I ask a question?” I asked as I slowly struggled to raise my shaking arms.

“Yes.”

“Who made the complaint?” I said as my entire body cramped up as I tried to move it.

“You are not authorized to know that” she replied with a straight face, “all I have to say is, your little game of life and death upset the one who made the complaint. He doesn’t like the unnecessary paperwork that death brings.”

“Th…th…the cr…eator,” I muttered as my head shook furiously.

I forced my cramping body to move as I leaped over her desk to strangle her. I managed to get on top of her and wrapped my fingers around her throat. I squeezed as hard as I could, so I could snuff her life out, and she struggled against me. My weight and strength overpowered her as she clawed at me with her chrome nails. 

The cold white skin of her throat was under my grasp. I held on like I was hanging from a cliff, but then, she snapped her finger. The golden rings above started spinning much faster. I started to light on fire, I felt my skin melt from the heat, but I never let go. I was the victor in that moment and I started to laugh through the intense heat.

“Hahaha, I will win! You biiii….tttt……chchch! I’m sorry Mrs. Karen! It won’t happen again, Ma’am!” I screamed as I choked her.

Finally, she went limp and she stopped breathing as her head fell back. The golden rings fell to the ground, but the blue eyes continued to shift on her skin. The fire disappeared and my body was back to normal. I was the victor! I was the winner!

“Yes! Yes! I win! I defeated that wench! I will go back to the-”

Suddenly, I was interrupted and thrusted back into the seat with a smile. My back straight and my hands on my lap. My suit had no wrinkles, my face was clean shaven, and my eyes stared straight at her. She stared at me with an angry snarl, the blue eye on her forehead glared at me with intensity, and she cocked her head to the side.

“Had fun? I’m gonna have to write you up a third time for your little outburst,” she said after a long tense silence.

“Mrs. Karen, do you enjoy this?” I asked in a gleeful way, “My suffering.”

“Yes, I do, I love breaking the minds of men like you,” she sternly answered.

“May I ask why?”

“Because men like you deserve to have your lives taken away, but in a different way,” she responded, “I can’t just kill you, though you deserve it. The creator forbids that, so I have come up with spaces that perfectly break the mind.”

“Men...men… li…ke…me,” I stuttered.

“Yes, sinners, sinners that play with death. A former hitman forced into an office space and is forced to work a gruelling unforgiving job. I find that funny,” she hissed with hatred, “Major Tom does all the paperwork, answers the email, and runs errands for the creator. You took a job to kill him like all the others. All the others had to spend time here like you.”

I sat there with the burning pain of the forced grin on my face. I couldn’t move no matter how hard I tried. I had no choice, but to listen to her, I wasn’t even allowed to talk at that moment.

“Your life, your freedom, and your power has been stripped from you,” she lectured, “Anyways, I dislike that I have to do this, but I have to…”

She took a deep breath as she moaned and sighed before she started to talk again.

“I’m gonna have to let you go.”

I opened my eyes, and I was in my bed in my house. I heard the birds chirping outside, I checked the time, and it was 9 AM. I jumped out of my bed and saw I was back in my assassins gear. I started to dance and jump around in joy.

“I’m free! I’m free!” I cried out as I started to dance.

I frantically called my girlfriend to tell her the good news, and she answered.

“I’m free from the office!” I cried into the phone.

“I’m done with you! You're asshole!” she screamed into the phone and hung up.

She was gonna come back to me, we’ve had a lot of fights, and she always comes back. I wanted to run outside and finally get some fresh air. I ran to the front door, turned the knob, and pushed it forward.

Pitch black, I opened the door and it was pitch black. I walked outside, there was a pitch black ground, but there was nothing. I walked outside for a few minutes and saw only darkness. I walked back to my house, closed the door, and locked it. I looked out the window to make sure and there was an endless sea of blackness. 

I sat on the couch and started to cry, so this is what Mrs. Karen meant my unemployment zone. I opened my laptop and started to look for a job on various job searching websites. I had a criminal record, so looking for employment is going to be hard. Luckily, there were jobs in other dimensions, universes, and realities. There were literally infinite job listings on the websites. As I waited for interviews and call backs; I decided to write this story to you guys.

It took me a few years and many awkward interviews. I had an interview with a jellyfish, grey men in suits, men in black, a starfish, a sea sponge, a crab that didn’t want to pay minimum wage, etc. I also had many normal interviews, but they didn’t like my background. So, I ended up being a cashier at this fast food place in dimension 5150. All of my customers have been ghosts, no literally, they are all ghosts. They look like stereotypical ghosts like they have white bed sheets on their heads and googly eyes. My coworker, Major Tom, always greets me before the shift.

1mn27nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1mn27nu/im_still_in_pain_i_cant_eat_i_cant_poop/,"I'm still in pain, I can't eat, I can't poop, everything hurts, and I'm about to travel abroad.  Advice/support is appreciated.","Hi, I've been following this subreddit for the past few months and it's been really informative.  I think I have gastritis (though my bad GI's endoscopic diagnosis just says ""stomach inflammation"".) And it's been getting worse since the endoscopic biopsy.

A little background - chronic constipation here, IBS diagnosis for 20 years, basically managed by eating a high-fiber diet and the occasional laxative.  Dx'd with laryngesophageal reflux and a hiatal hernia from an endoscopy after waking up choking on acid too many times 7 years ago.  No heartburn or stomach pain at the time though. I was able to cut out acidic fruits and vegetables but continue on omeprazole 20 mg for the past 7 years. It worked and I very rarely had acid choking incidents.  For context, I drink a couple beers or glasses of wine maybe every other week, I like ice cream, and I drink a large coffee every morning. I also eat and like a lot of raw fruits and vegetables because it helps the constipation.

Around March I realized I couldn't go to the bathroom. At all. I didn't even have the urge to, for two weeks straight. Normally it's not weird for me to go once a week. But this time nothing was happening with laxatives. I also noticed that when I had a glass of red wine my stomach would burn. So I cut out red wine.  The burning pain continued and I got more and more bloated. The stomach pain spread to my back and down my left side. I had no right-sided pain, and no chest pain. 

First, I went to my PCP's NP and explained the situation, knowing I needed a GI doc.  Despite the horrific pre-prep experience 20 years prior, I was willing to go through it again to get a colonoscopy and figure out what was going on. He was new, asked me three times about my coffee consumption, asked me why I didn't take 40 mg of omeprazole (because the label doesn't say to?) and poked my stomach a couple times, before I said please just give me a referral.  he gave me a referral list of 10 docs.  They all had waitlists of 6 months to get seen. I started calling around off the list and finally found someone who could see me within the month, albeit in his after-hours ""clinic"" in June. He saw me for all of 10 minutes, dismissed all of my symptoms, told me everyone has a hiatal hernia. told me everyone has acid reflux, even told me ""everybody has polyps"". He didn't even examine me.  He took me to the receptionist to schedule an endoscopy (which I had to ask him to do, and he said he'd ""throw it in there"" after the colonoscopy), and a colonoscopy - and put me on a FIVE DAY bowel prep.  During this time I had to take unholy quantities of magnesium citrate which hurt my teeth, made my muscles twitch and I think inflamed my stomach even more. Nothing in my colon, but the endoscopy comes back with a lot of fundic polyps with only a few of them removed for biopsies.  Negative for h. pylori, negative for Barretts esophagus, negative for dysplaisia/cancer.  But I do have:

""gastric antral mucosa with vascular conjunction and reactive changes""

""squamocolumnar junction mucosa with chronic inflammation""

""gastric body/fundic type mucosa with focal gland dilitation and fovealar hypoplastic changes""

When I called the doc to have him explain the results to me, all he would say through his receptionist was ""all samples benign"". That's it.  No hernia measurement, no diagnosis of anything else, no followup recommendations. 

Since that endoscopy in July, everything in my stomach seems to have gotten WORSE. I figured a week to recover from multiple biopsy retrievals was probably normal for healing, but the burning stomach pain, and just confusion about what to eat has continued and gotten worse and spread to my chest and to my back. I've cut out alcohol, I've learned that I have to taper off caffeine, and I'm pretty much eating bananas, watermelon, oatmeal, Goldfish crackers, peanut butter sandwiches, and chicken and rice for dinner. I had one relapse a couple weekends ago when I went to the beach on vacation and really really wanted a lobster roll, a couple beers, and a chocolate ice cream. And I paid for it with a week of pain.  

After reading here about the pros and cons of PPIs I thought maybe the NP is right, I'll double up on esomeprazole. So I started taking 40 mgs in the morning instead of 20 It doesn't seem to be working.  Nothing I take will make it go away.  When my stomach is empty, it hurts. When my stomach is full, it is too full, burns, and I'm also bloated.  On top of that, I have to use enemas to go to the bathroom, because the last time I took something orally it set off my stomach all over again. I don't know how one manages this AND IBS simultaneously. It seems impossible. I'm not sleeping well.  Anxiety has also been added to the mix. I wake up with anxiety and heart palpitations now and I can't figure out why, considering that I actually take anti-anxiety meds before bed for this exact purpose.

The OTHER thing that's happening - I'm an avid hiker, (or used to be, before this situation took away all my energy) and I booked a walking holiday in Ireland for 10 days in August.  Back when this started happening in March, I really didn't think I would still be dealing with this in August.  And I figured that all the walking we're doing will help. If I can just stick to a bland Irish diet of fish and potatoes and try and smuggle some energy bars or snacks in my luggage, I can get by my ""6 small bland meals"" diet.  But another thing I've started noticing - toward the end of my walks now, I get a wave of dizziness. I also got a wave of dizziness while I was driving home the other night, which was scary.  And I was on a 6 mile easy low-elevation hike last weekend when it seemed like my vision started getting blurry toward the end of my hike and the trees were coming in and out of focus.  

I am also taking a B12 now, based on the advice given in this thread, but I know it takes a while to work.

I'm afraid of going on this trip with this new condition. I don't know if these new symptoms are side effects from the higher dose of esomeprazole and if I should go back to 20 mg. or if I have a B12 deficiency? I am just afraid of not keeping up on this trip and accidentally eating something that creates another flare.  I have an annual PCP exam the week after I get back and I plan to ask my doctor for more tests and an ultrasound to rule out gallbladder and pancreas issues, and blood tests for B12 deficiency, etc.  But there's a chance, again, I might not get seen for 6 more months. 

(by the way, I live in the healthcare capital of the country - Boston. When I asked why the 6 month wait in this particular hospital system - again, one of the best in the world, I was told ""not enough doctors"".   welcome to America - the best trained doctors with absolutely no appointments available). 

Since I'm new to what I think I've self-diagnosed as gastritis, I'm wondering if you guys have any tips for managing it while traveling abroad, and any tips for managing the anxiety of it, or ways to cope with the pain and discomfort?  Some people (my mother) have told me ""don't go"" in case there really is something more serious going on (all my vitals - BP, heart rate, cardiac levels are all normal so I'm not worried about that) but I resolved at the beginning of the year that if the future was going to be sh-tty I was going to get to Ireland if it was the one thing I did this year.  I can't cancel and I've already invested so much time and money into it.  I just keep telling myself, the walking will help, the walking will help, the walking will help.. but I am anxious as hell about it. ",1,1754882185.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1mn273m,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mn273m/feel_completely_stuck_in_my_job_search_after_a/,Feel completely stuck in my job search after a year- what to do?,"Hi everyone,

I made this account just to get some thoughts/advice because I feel completely stuck and don’t know what else to try.

I’ve been job searching for over a year now with zero interviews in the past few months, and it’s really getting to me. I’m exhausted, anxious, and feeling like there’s no way out.

A bit about me: BA in Marketing, working since I was 16: coffee shops, personal assistant/ nanny, admin, catering, customer support, etc. Did a marketing internship for a startup (wasn’t great), and for the last 5+ years I’ve worked in admin role. I also have a PMP certificate, but my project experience is mostly small-scale and low-budget

Current job situation:

**I hate my job:** Pay is low, no growth. Everyone has either quit or been fired, so I’m basically doing the job of 3 people. ’m included in every email thread imaginable, wasting my time and draining my energy.

Honestly, I feel like I’m just kept around because no one else is willing to do this much work for this little pay. I think if I asked to talk about workload, I’m 99% sure they’d just say something like “maybe this role isn’t the right fit” (as if I haven’t been trying to leave).

Also, I’m expected to plan large events on ridiculously small budgets like organizing a full-day event for 200 people at some fancy high end place with like 20k. It’s not realistic, it’s stressful.

Job hunt goals: Ideally NYC, but open to other U.S. cities. Event Manager / Event Marketing Manage or Project Coordinator / Junior Project Manager. To be very frank I wouldn't mind if my title is Dog walker as long as I make over 100k and have health insurance.

Salary goal: $100k–$150k, full-time, with benefits (401k, health insurance, etc.)

Job search so far using LinkedIn (even tried Premium — didn’t help), and Indeed. I also tried cold messaging and warm intros on LinkedIn but nothing ever comes of it. My friends can’t really help as most of them are digital nomads or in totally different fields

I’ve visited networking events, but most of the time it's just other job seekers equally desperate and not people who can hire. Also, I’m shy, not great at interviews, and really struggle with selling myself which is probably my biggest issue.

At this point, I just feel trapped. The job market is awful, but it feels like I must be doing something wrong if I can’t even land interviews anymore.

If anyone has been in a similar spot and found a way out, I’d really love to hear how.

Hybristophilia is a paraphilia, a sexual interest, in which an individual is attracted to people who have committed crimes or are otherwise considered dangerous or criminal.  This was real at the time, and still is.  Ramirez had groupies in court that were bat shit crazy in love with him, sent him love letters, etc, and the same went for Ted Bundy.  There was even one woman fan, that actually married Ramirez, at the prison (not  a joke.)   She was naive, claimed she saw nothing but good in him.   Then one day, she divorced him, and all the groupies & love letters stopped.  What did it take to finally break them of this hideous spell?  It was the cold case DNA confirmation, that Ramirez's first victim was in fact (brace yourself) ... an 8 year old girl, he raped and strangled to death.

Now the point I'm trying to make here is, is what the reaction would be, if the Epstein files got released (fingers crossed),   Even IF they were to reveal video evidence, anything, you name it, showing Baby Carrot raping an underage girl, the Quartering, Geeks & Gamers, and the rest of the expendable Trump simps, would STILL declare their undying love, for Taco.

# best Glass Tray 2025: Top Picks & Buying Guide

The ubiquitous glass tray, frequently enough overlooked, plays a surprisingly vital role in modern homes and events. From serving appetizers and drinks too organizing countertops and showcasing decorative items, its versatility is unmatched. Selecting the right glass tray in 2025 involves considering factors like material quality, design aesthetics, durability, and functionality. this guide provides a detailed overview of the top glass trays available, helping you make an informed purchase that meets your specific needs. we explore a range of options, from elegant serving platters to practical organizers, ensuring you find the perfect glass tray to complement your lifestyle and enhance your home.

## Key Features analysis

The latest glass trays boast a range of improvements over previous models, focusing on enhanced durability, innovative designs, and versatile applications.

**Tempered Glass Construction:**

High-end glass trays utilize tempered glass, which is substantially stronger and more resistant to breakage than standard glass. This process involves heating the glass to a high temperature and then rapidly cooling it, creating a surface that is four to five times more durable. Tempered glass also shatters into small, relatively harmless pieces, reducing the risk of injury. This ensures the tray can withstand the rigors of daily use, even with heavy items or accidental bumps.

**Ergonomic Handles & Edges:**

Many modern glass trays feature ergonomically designed handles or raised edges for easy and safe handling.The handles are often made of durable materials like stainless steel or acrylic, providing a comfortable grip and preventing slippage. Raised edges prevent items from sliding off the tray during transport, ensuring that food, drinks, or decorative objects remain secure. These design elements enhance both the usability and the safety of the tray.

**Scratch-Resistant Coating:**

To maintain their pristine appearance, several glass tray manufacturers apply a scratch-resistant coating. This coating protects the surface from scratches and abrasions caused by daily use and cleaning. The coating is typically made of a obvious, durable polymer that does not affect the clarity or appearance of the glass. This feature ensures that the tray retains its beauty and functionality for years to come, even with frequent use.**Versatile Size and Shape Options:**

Glass trays are available in a wide variety of sizes and shapes to suit different needs and preferences. Options range from small, rectangular trays perfect for serving appetizers to large, round platters ideal for displaying cakes or desserts. Square, oval, and even uniquely shaped trays are also available, catering to diverse aesthetic tastes and functional requirements. These diverse options ensure that you can find the perfect glass tray for any occasion or purpose.

**Integrated Non-Slip Feet:**

To prevent the tray from sliding on smooth surfaces, many models incorporate integrated non-slip feet. These feet are typically made of silicone or rubber and are attached to the bottom of the tray. They provide a stable base,preventing the tray from moving or tipping over,especially when carrying heavy items. This feature enhances safety and prevents accidental spills or damage to surfaces.

**Heat Resistance :**

Modern glass trays designed for serving hot items are often made of borosilicate glass known for its high heat resistance. This type of glass can withstand temperatures up to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) without cracking or shattering. This makes the tray ideal for serving dishes directly from the oven.

## Core Benefits

glass trays offer several key benefits that make them a valuable addition to any home.

**Elegant Presentation:** A glass tray elevates the presentation of food, drinks, or decorative items, adding a touch of sophistication to any setting. The transparent nature of the glass allows the contents to be the center of attention, while the clean lines and contemporary design create a visually appealing display. Whether you're serving cocktails at a party or displaying candles on a coffee table, a glass tray enhances the overall aesthetic.

**Easy Cleaning and Maintenance:** Glass trays are incredibly easy to clean and maintain, requiring minimal effort to keep them looking their best. The smooth, non-porous surface of the glass prevents stains and odors from penetrating, making it simple to wipe clean with a damp cloth or sponge. Many glass trays are also dishwasher-safe, providing added convenience for busy individuals.

1mn23i2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mn23i2/am_i_the_ahole_for_cutting_my_sister_off_after/,Am I the ahole for cutting my sister off after her Wedding?,"I (F31) apologize, I'm autistic and dyslexic. 

Hi lovely queen potato charlotte, I want to start this off with when you read this, either the event has happened or it is going to happen, seeing as September is when this event is supposedly supposed to go down.

So, my sister is getting married this year. Her and her fiancé, both older, in their early 30’s (let's call them Fifi and Bruno.) They have been together for 13 years and now finally decided that this year they were going to get married. The day that they picked was on our father and his sisters birthday. Fifi is what we all like to call a control freak. She made EVERYTHING about her, on vacations she had to do everything with little to no time to rest. Family events she had to one up everyone, even going as far as to downplay my achievements. If I did well in something, she would say it was handed to me (which was not the case). My sister has been my third parent, my whole life. My bully. No one could compare to her. When she did something wrong, she would blame me instead. I thought when we got older, a lot of our childhood traumas and behaviours would disappear, but she hasn’t changed. I tried my best. I gave 100%, and my sister gave 10 (on good days). I still held out hope. When my sister started planning her wedding, she told me I could invite a friend which I thought was nice... on that note: about a year ago, I met my loving and adoring golden retriever boyfriend (Barry). Barry (M28) is a sweet, loveable,” everything I could ask for” type of boyfriend. He makes me the happiest I've been in years, which makes the actions of my sister more apparent, more obvious than ever before.



On to what we are all here for… at this point I am only a few weeks away from my sister's wedding as I write this. Many things have happened between then, but things that have really upset me are about my dress, and the fact I'm curvy and short, and that she wants me to show up a few hours before the actual ceremony, even though I'm not a part of the bridal party at all (that request feels suspicious to me). I am an alt girl, a thick curvy woman in black. Months ago when Fifi gave the invitation to me, I showed her pictures of my dress (pictures will be below) and got the okay from Fifi herself. She said that as long as it's “jewel tone colours” and as long as I'm comfortable, she was good with it. So, I bought the dress, and it was good to go! 

A few months after getting the almighty thumbs up from Fifi, she messaged me out of the blue (Which for her is normal. Months not hearing from Fifi is a wonderful thing believe me.) She started with the normal “The trees are green, The sky is blue, How are you?” Bs, but then she went in on the dress. She said that wearing black to the wedding means I'm in mourning for her relationship, and that the slit in the dress would mean I would look slutty (paraphrasing) (Strike one). I was not shocked, but I let her continue. She suggested I wear red. I told her if she’s going in on traditional colour palettes for weddings, then red means that you are “boinking” the husband (guess how fast she backed off of that idea lol) 

She then suggested 2 of the most awful colours possible imo: mustard yellow or bubblegum pink. Pink is not my colour (sorry) and mustard yellow would wash out my pale vampire skin. Even my boyfriend said the choices were bad, because he knows I don’t go well with pink, and said even most men wouldn’t want their cars to be “mustard” yellow. Anyways, I turned her down on both of those, since I had already purchased the dress and she already gave me the OK. I reassured her that it wouldn't be straight black, as there would also be another color underneath: A beautiful maroon skirt since I don't like showing my legs and the slit in the dress is high, like really high. It is still keeping with my dark side and her theme but also having some colour to it. Remember, this is all happening in September, so there would be no time to change out anything. Me and her went back and forth, and finally she gave up… or so I thought. 

Now, keep in mind I am not super skinny. By any means, I am very curvy. My sister came back a few weeks later and said “you have to lose at least a hundred pounds to 2 hundred pounds before the wedding, because I don’t want people to think you’re pregnant” (Strike 2). I told her it was rude to ask and also impossible given how close we are to the date. And no, I love the way I am and don’t feel the need to change myself to that degree. Not to mention that Fifi had begun to send her bridesmaids after me like bloodhounds to guilt me into doing what she wanted on both issues (one of them whom we’ll call Mimzy was so drunk the only words that were spelt properly were the cuss words). I told my boyfriend Barry, and he started looking for a Walking Dead special bat for this occasion. I told him I appreciate him so much for this, my god of thunder boyfriend, but that this was my fight, and him doing anything could make it worse. 

The final strike happened a few weeks later when on my day off, blissfully asleep at 5 in the morning, I awoke to my ringing phone. It was Fifi… calling me so early, the birds weren’t even up (Shocker.) She didn't even ask how I was or anything… she started yelling: “You haven't rsvp'd yet!” Looking at the time and due to the fact my brain struggled to see why this couldn’t wait until the sun was up and I’ve had coffee, I answered her with “Hmm?” … she did not like this. She screamed “you need to rsvp, you and Barry are coming to my wedding, right?!” I sat up and told her nothing came in the mail for me to rsvp. She screamed (probably waking her neighborhood up) “it's on the website I made!” Yes, she made a flipping website for this. Confused, I open the message and scroll to the link she had sent me a month ago. I opened it (while she's still screeching at me about the rsvp still at 5 in the morning) and I found her rsvp section and filled it out. I then asked her if she got it. She checked, and like night and day her whole demeanor changed. Like a girl scout who sold her last box of cookies for the day, she gleefully confirmed, and then finally hung up. I sadly didn't go back to sleep that day (Thank you Fifizilla.) 

Can you see how much Fifi has become the biggest atomic bridezilla? Still, I don't want to start fights with her. I want to keep the peace, at least until her wedding. After her wedding, I am to (as per instructed by my therapist), cut her off from any contact. I wish to do more than this (the topic of losing my shit at the wedding and trying to embarrass her has come up), but I won’t because like Jedi Jesus, I seek the high ground.

It breaks my heart to do this to her, because she is my sister, my blood. I thought that me and her could at least coexist in each other's worlds as siblings. If not friends, at least civilly. But, over the past few years, Fifi has only shown me how much I'm no longer even included in her world or ever was, and how my existence causes her embarrassment.

So I ask, to all of you: am I the a hole for cutting my sister out of my life after her wedding?

\---

Small update: so Fifi called me the other day. She did the normal bs.then went at me “have you started your weight loss program I told you to do?” I said no. She went at me “your gonna ruin my wedding or people with think you're pregnant!” she repeated again, crocodile tears heard through the phone. I clapped back “you know, the bay is having a sale on mannequins. I'm sure with that mindset you can get a whole bridal party for cheap.” The line went dead very quickly.

Update 2: a week later, a new player has reentered the mix. It’s Mimzy (the drunk one from earlier). No, I have never spoken to Mimzy before any of this, but she's part of the bridal party. She texted me (sober this time): “you need to stop ruining your sister's wedding!!!” I replied, tongue firmly in cheek: “Who's wedding?” “FIFIS WEDDING!!!!!!” she said. “oh what am I doing wrong?” I said. She responded “You're not losing weight and wearing a different dress!” I confirmed to her I am not. I said I am a guest and what I wear should not matter, because I'm not a part of the “Fifi bridal club for drunks” (I didn’t say it like that… but it was tempting). Mimzy did not like this and said that I was a horrible sister and why should I even attend my sister's wedding? I said, because I'm the sister of the bride. I'm family and it's the right thing to do. And if her toddler IQ can't handle that, too bad. I then deleted the text messages and blocked the number. The fact that Fifi is getting her bridesmaids to keep at this so close to the wedding is ridiculous and pathetic, tbh. As if they don’t have a full wedding to plan. May update if anything else happens.

According to the Global Sleep Study (2023) led by Dr. Rebecca Moore at Stanford University, optimizing sleep can boost productivity by 34%, improve decision-making by 29%, and even enhance emotional resilience by 40%. Here’s how to turn sleep into your ultimate performance enhancer.

https://preview.redd.it/zsrug9dt3bif1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d35580f162f1f9c4b9a296ab28c78ba76ff7c6e



1. Master Your Circadian Rhythm

Your body thrives on consistency. Research from the Chronobiology Institute (2022), directed by Dr. Ethan Lee, found that people who wake up and sleep at the same time every day (even on weekends) experience deeper, more restorative sleep. Try this:

\- Set a fixed wake-up time (e.g., 6:00 AM)

\- Avoid bright lights 90 minutes before bed

\- Get morning sunlight within 30 minutes of waking



2. The 90-Minute Sleep Cycle Hack

Sleep occurs in 90-minute cycles. A study in Sleep Medicine Reviews (2021) by Dr. Sophia Chen showed that waking at the end of a cycle (after 6, 7.5, or 9 hours) reduces grogginess by 50%. Use apps like Sleep Cycle or set alarms in 90-minute increments (e.g., 6 or 7.5 hours after bedtime).



3. The Military Power Nap

NASA’s Fatigue Countermeasures Study (2020), led by Dr. Alan Pierce, proved that a 26-minute nap improves alertness by 54% and performance by 34%. Follow this elite napping protocol:

\- Limit naps to 20-30 minutes (prevents sleep inertia)

\- Nap between 1:00–3:00 PM (aligns with natural energy dip)

\- Drink coffee right before napping (caffeine kicks in upon waking)



4. Optimize Your Sleep Environment

The Sleep Environment Project (2023) by Dr. Hannah Park found that small tweaks can enhance sleep quality by 62%:

\- Keep your room at 65°F (18°C)

\- Use blackout curtains or a sleep mask

\- Eliminate noise with earplugs or white noise



5. The 10-3-2-1-0 Wind-Down Rule

Developed by sleep expert Dr. Michael Breus, this method primes your body for deep sleep:

\- 10 hours before bed: No more caffeine

\- 3 hours before: Stop eating heavy meals

\- 2 hours before: End work-related tasks

\- 1 hour before: Avoid screens (try reading instead)

\- 0: Hit the pillow with a clear mind



6. Leverage Sleep for Learning

A groundbreaking Harvard Study (2022) by Dr. Olivia Stern showed that reviewing key information before bed improves memory retention by 48%. Spend 15 minutes pre-sleep:

\- Review notes for an upcoming presentation

\- Listen to an educational podcast

\- Visualize your goals



7. Track and Optimize

Wearables like the Oura Ring or Whoop Strap (validated in the Biotech Sleep Study \[2023\]) provide personalized insights:

\- Deep sleep vs. REM balance

\- Resting heart rate trends

\- Recovery scores



Final Thought: Sleep Like a Champion

Sleep isn’t downtime—it’s upgrade time. As entrepreneur and biohacker David Sinclair (featured in the Longevity Sleep Study \[2023\]) says: ""The best performance hack isn’t a drug or supplement. It’s 8 hours of high-quality sleep."" Start with one hack tonight, and wake up closer to your peak potential.

1mn1zsu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mn1zsu,Mini Cachapas,"Cachapa is a traditional Venezuelan dish. It's like a pancake or thin cake, made with ground sweet yellow corn. A touch of salt and a little sugar are added, although the latter is optional. It's very cheap, easy to make, delicious, filling, and very nutritious. You can also make several and refrigerate them for later. They're very versatile; you can pair them with black or brown beans. They also go well with sautéed vegetables, or you can eat them alone, accompanied by black coffee. If you sauté them the next day, they're even tastier. In short, they're truly delicious. Below, I'm sharing the recipe for some small cachapas I made some time ago on an electric griddle.



# THE RECIPE



**Time, ingredients and equipment**



* Preparation time: This recipe is really simple and quick if you already have the ground corn dough. If you do not have the possibility of acquiring freshly ground sweet corn dough (jojoto) in your area, you can buy a dozen ears of young corn, shell it and grind it, either with a food processor, a blender (you must grind it in portions very small so as not to damage the equipment), or in a hand mill. The mixing and preparation time for small cachapas will not exceed 30 minutes.
* Servings: From this amount of ingredients I obtained 7 units (cachapas), 13 cm in diameter on average.
* 500 grams of young corn dough (jojoto), fresh. **It is very important that it is yellow corn, with white corn the flavor does not go well.**
* 20 grams of or a heaping tablespoon of sugar, (this is the part that is different from the original recipe). The ideal would be to add cane sugar (piloncillo), but my family refuses this combination.
* 3 grams or half a teaspoon of salt.
* 250 ml of water.
* Large bowl for kneading, wooden or metal spoon (it doesn't matter), measuring cups (I used my traditional totuma ""dishes""), plates, spatula, and in this case I used an electric griddle, but they can be made in griddles or pans of any kind, even in a wide cauldron.

  
**THE PROCEDURE** 



To speed up the preparation of any recipe, we must have our ingredients measured and the utensils available to work. Where I live, it is an agricultural and livestock area, so it is feasible to get sweet corn, so it is common to sell this dough already ground in street stalls, or in some grocery store. The first thing we will do is pour the sweet corn dough into a large container to be able to mix it comfortably. As you can see, this dough has a very compact consistency, not fluid, which tells me that it was processed from corn that was no longer tender; which is why it will require more liquid to get it to a manageable consistency, so I add about 250 ml of room temperature water.

  
Then I add the salt and sugar, trying to ensure that they are very well distributed in the dough. I check the consistency, which should be not too runny, but not too dry either (everyone has their own criteria in this regard).

  
The next step is to preheat the griddle to 300ºF, for about five minutes, and then, once it is hot, form the discs of dough on the cooking surface. As this griddle is non-stick, it was not necessary to oil it, in case it is not, it is necessary to cover the area with a layer of cooking oil.

  
I will be very frank, I felt uncomfortable using this griddle, (perhaps lack of practice), so the discs were not round as I do them in a pan or in another special griddle that I have (budare). The minicachapas in this opportunity were left with irregular shapes; however, the flavor was quite good. I cooked each of these little pieces for about 3-4 minutes per side; however, if the cachapa is larger and thicker, it will require more time. You will know that you can turn the piece, when it begins to change the color on the surface, when it dries.

  
I can say that the experience using the electric iron was so-so, so I will have to use it more often to get familiar with it. The mini cachapas that I prepared had excellent flavor, in fact, I ate these together with my husband later, accompanied by a cup of coffee; but they are very versatile, they can be combined with beans, avocado, salads, with whatever you like or eaten alone, as I did.

Built a dream, she was telling me it’s time to propose and I’m perfect and she’s lucky to have me and doesn’t feel good enough but is so excited to be married. Didn’t really have much a family but had really taken to mine and just the same week she said thanks for being her true family that’s all she ever wanted to have. Best friends also my family. 

Now drops off the map, but end of summer we had to move 3 times. Weren’t sleeping, 14 hour shifts. Did an all nighter to move cross country and never been more tired in my life. One day to sleep and I noticed the next day she’d just gone blank. Like we’d always been super talkative and she wanted to talk to me or be with me 24/7 and like silence. Then right onto 3 days of 14 hour shifts and really only seeing each other before bed. I tell her on day 4 she’s acting like she doesn’t love me and why are we even doing our dream of traveling the world together if you don’t, I could just leave if you don’t like me. And she’d also started getting very sick, so total overwhelm, and she just said no your right it clicked that’s not fair and kept saying she felt nothing towards me. Not no love, but nothing. Although our connection was deep and there. She said must have been friendship. 

So I left. She was back in our home state 30 days later and got to talk. I asked her to coffee after a month apart and she’d ghosted, but she said for 10 minutes and stayed 3 hours. Cried about losing my family, said she’s sorry. I told her she’s a classic tearful avoidant and she agreed. She asked if she wants to be friends or drop altogether. I told her I love our connection and will be friends but I think she’s wrong, I think she’s just in some sort of protective detachment and I’ve done the work to better myself. She said she’d do some thinking. But it’s too soon to even be friends and needs more time apart. She comes back in another month.

2 weeks after the talk took me out of her insta bio as her partner of 7 years. But she seemed receptive to this is a result of her trauma and commitment issues. 

If I invite her to another discussion do you think even if she understands the psychology as she’s very smart and pretty emotionally attuned, or do you think she’d be able to re-access those emotions if I start from ground up and show her nervous system I’m safe?

The girl is literally cutting off all her friends, family, and partner just short of getting married and she was so excited for it. 

I want to give her the benefit of the doubt and a chance as she’d be giving up everything I’ve ever known her to value and want in her life.

You’re the CEO, the head of marketing, the lead salesperson, and often, the chief coffee-maker. But the most critical hat you wear is that of the Chief Financial Officer. The financial health of your business rests squarely on your shoulders, and the primary tool for managing that health is your budget.

For years, the standard advice has been the same: start your budget by forecasting revenue. Project how much money you think you’ll make, and then decide how you'll spend it. It seems logical, right? Optimistic, even. You set a big, hairy, audacious goal for your revenue and build a plan to get there.

I’m here to tell you that this conventional wisdom is, for most small businesses, fundamentally flawed. I call it the ""Backwards Budget,"" and it’s a quiet saboteur, setting you up for cash flow crises, stressful decision-making, and ultimately, failure.

This isn't just a theoretical critique. I've seen the fallout firsthand in my work with hundreds of entrepreneurs. I’ve seen businesses with fantastic products and passionate founders crumble because their financial foundation was built on a house of cards—a revenue forecast that was more wishful thinking than reality.

In this article, we’re going to dismantle the ""Backwards Budget."" We'll explore why this revenue-first approach is so dangerous and introduce a more powerful, resilient, and realistic alternative. We’ll dive deep into practical **budgeting strategies**, with a special focus on a game-changing technique called **zero-based budgeting**. By the end, you’ll have a new framework for financial planning—one that gives you control, clarity, and a real path to sustainable profitability.

# The Great Disconnect: Why Revenue-First Budgeting Doesn't Work

Imagine you’re planning a cross-country road trip. The traditional budgeting method is like deciding you want to average 80 miles per hour for the entire trip *before* you’ve even looked at a map. You haven’t accounted for mountain passes, city traffic, construction zones, or how many times your kids will need a bathroom break. You’ve started with an optimistic outcome instead of the operational reality.

Forecasting revenue first does the same thing to your business. It creates a dangerous disconnect between your goals and the actual costs of running your company.

Here’s why it’s so problematic:

**1. It’s Built on Hope, Not Reality:** Revenue forecasts, especially for small businesses or startups, are educated guesses at best. You can analyze market trends, look at your sales pipeline, and build the most sophisticated spreadsheet model in the world, but you cannot predict the future. A key client might leave, a new competitor could emerge, or a global pandemic could change everything overnight.

When your entire spending plan is based on hitting a revenue target that is inherently uncertain, you’re on shaky ground. What happens when you’re in Month 4 and you’ve only hit 60% of your forecasted revenue? The budget you so carefully built becomes useless. You start making reactive, panicked decisions—slashing costs without a strategy, delaying critical investments, or worse, taking on high-interest debt to cover the shortfall.

**Example:** *Meet Sarah, a graphic designer who started her own agency. For her first year, she forecasted $150,000 in revenue. Based on this, she signed a lease for a trendy downtown office for $2,500 a month, hired a part-time assistant for $1,500 a month, and subscribed to a suite of premium software for $500 a month. Her fixed costs were $4,500 a month before she even paid herself. The first quarter was slow, and she only brought in $20,000. Suddenly, her ""plan"" was causing massive stress. The office felt like a gilded cage, and she was burning through her savings just to keep the lights on.*

**2. It Encourages Lifestyle Creep for Your Business:** The revenue-first approach often leads to a phenomenon I call ""business lifestyle creep."" It’s based on the idea of, ""If we make X, we can afford to spend Y."" This mindset encourages you to increase spending in direct proportion to your revenue projections.

You project a 20% increase in sales, so you feel justified in hiring another employee, moving to a bigger office, or investing in that flashy marketing campaign. But you haven't first determined if those expenses are the most efficient and effective use of capital. You're spending money you *hope* to have, not money you *actually* have. This is how businesses end up ""cash-flow rich but profit poor."" They have impressive revenue numbers but are constantly scrambling to pay their bills because their expense structure has ballooned.

**3. It Masks Inefficiencies:** When you start with a big revenue number, it’s easy to get lazy with your expenses. A $500 monthly software subscription doesn't seem like much when you're planning to make $50,000 a month. But what if you only use 10% of that software's features? What if a competitor offers a better tool for half the price?

The ""Backwards Budget"" doesn't force you to ask these tough questions. It doesn't demand justification for every dollar spent. It implicitly accepts last year's expenses as a baseline and builds upon them, allowing inefficiencies to become baked into your company's financial DNA.

# The Paradigm Shift: Lead with Expenses, Not Revenue

So, if starting with revenue is the wrong move, what’s the right one?

**You flip the model on its head. You start with your expenses.**

Instead of asking, ""How much money will we make and how can we spend it?"" you ask, ""What is the absolute minimum we need to spend to run this business effectively, and what revenue do we need to generate to support that?""

This approach forces you to become a master of your own operations. It grounds your financial plan in reality—in the tangible, knowable costs of doing business. Your budget becomes a tool for control and efficiency, not a document of hope.

The most powerful methodology for this expense-first approach is **zero-based budgeting (ZBB)**.

# The Ultimate Tool for Control: A Deep Dive into Zero-Based Budgeting

The name sounds intimidating, but the concept is beautifully simple. With zero-based budgeting, you start each new budgeting period (whether it’s a year, a quarter, or a month) from a ""zero base."" Every single expense, from your rent to the cost of paper clips, must be justified.

You don’t get to say, ""Well, we spent $5,000 on marketing last year, so let's budget $5,500 this year."" Instead, you must prove that the $5,000 (or any amount) is necessary and that it's the most effective use of those funds to achieve your goals.

ZBB is a proactive strategy. It turns you from a passive spender into a critical investor in your own company.

# How to Implement Zero-Based Budgeting: A Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Identify Your Core Business Objectives** Before you can justify an expense, you need to know what you're trying to achieve. Are you focused on acquiring new customers? Improving customer retention? Increasing operational efficiency? Launching a new product? Be specific. For this period, what are the 1-3 most important goals?

**Step 2: List Every Single Business Expense. Yes,** ***Every*** **Single One.** This is the most labor-intensive part, but it's also the most enlightening. Go through your bank statements, credit card bills, and accounting software for the last 6-12 months. Create a master list of everything you spend money on. Don’t judge or analyze yet—just capture the data.

Categorize them into two buckets:

* **Fixed Costs:** These are the expenses you have to pay regardless of your sales volume. Think rent, salaries, insurance, loan payments, and core software subscriptions.
* **Variable Costs:** These expenses fluctuate with your level of business activity. They include things like cost of goods sold (COGS), raw materials, shipping costs, sales commissions, and advertising spend.

**Step 3: Justify Every Line Item from Zero** Now, go through your list, line by line, and ask the tough questions. For each expense, you must defend its existence.

* **Is this expense absolutely essential to our operations?** (e.g., Rent, payroll, insurance). These are your ""cost of entry"" expenses.
* **Is this expense directly contributing to one of our core objectives?** If so, how? Can we measure the ROI? (e.g., Marketing campaigns, sales software).
* **Is there a cheaper, more efficient way to achieve the same result?** This is where you become a ruthless optimizer.
   * *Software:* ""We pay $300/month for this project management tool. Are we using all its features? Is there a $100/month alternative that does everything we actually need?""
   * *Supplies:* ""We order office supplies from a major retailer. Could we get a better price from a local supplier or a bulk-buying service?""
   * *Services:* ""We pay a retainer for an agency. Are they delivering value? Could we achieve better results with a specialized freelancer for a specific project?""

**Step 4: Build Your ""Survival"" Budget** From this analysis, you will build your baseline budget. This is the absolute leanest version of your business that can still operate and serve customers effectively. It includes all your essential fixed costs and the minimum variable costs required to deliver your product or service.

This number is your North Star. This is the *real* cost of running your business. Let’s call it your **""Break-Even Revenue Target.""** This is the first revenue goal you should care about. It's not about getting rich; it's about staying alive.

**Example Revisited:** \*Let's go back to Sarah, our graphic designer. If she had used ZBB, her process would have looked different. Instead of forecasting revenue, she would have asked, ""What do I absolutely need to start this agency?""

* **Essential Software:** Adobe Creative Suite ($60/month). Project management tool ($30/month). Accounting software ($30/month). Total: $120.
* **Office:** ""Do I need a downtown office, or can I work from home for the first year to keep overhead low?"" Decision: Work from home. Cost: $0.
* **Assistant:** ""Do I need an assistant now, or can I use automation tools and handle the admin myself until I have a steady client base?"" Decision: Handle it herself. Cost: $0. Her new ""Survival"" monthly cost is $120, not $4,500. Her Break-Even Revenue Target is a tiny fraction of what it was. The pressure is off. She can now focus on landing great clients, not just any client to cover her massive overhead.\*

# From Survival to Growth: Layering on the Strategy

Your ""Survival"" budget is your foundation. It’s not the end goal. The goal is to build a thriving, profitable business. Now that you have a stable base, you can start making strategic decisions about growth.

This is where you layer on ""Decision Packages."" These are discretionary expenses or investments that you believe will help you achieve your core objectives. You evaluate them as separate, optional packages.

**Examples of Decision Packages:**

* **Digital Marketing Campaign:**
   * *Objective:* Acquire 20 new customers.
   * *Cost:* $2,000 for Google Ads.
   * *Justification:* ""Based on industry benchmarks, we project this spend will generate 50 leads, and our conversion rate is 40%, leading to 20 new customers with a lifetime value of $500 each.""
* **Hiring a Salesperson:**
   * *Objective:* Increase sales outreach by 400%.
   * *Cost:* $4,000/month salary + commission.
   * *Justification:* ""A dedicated salesperson can make 100 calls a day, while I can only make 20. This will accelerate our pipeline growth and free me up to focus on closing deals and product development.""
* **Investing in New Equipment:**
   * *Objective:* Increase production efficiency by 30%.
   * *Cost:* $10,000 one-time.
   * *Justification:* ""This machine will reduce our per-unit production time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes, allowing us to increase output and lower our cost of goods sold, paying for itself in 18 months.""

You add these packages to your ""Survival"" budget one by one, based on their potential ROI and your available cash. This creates different tiers of your budget:

* **Budget Tier 1: Survival.** (Essential expenses only)
* **Budget Tier 2: Survival + Marketing Push.** (Adds the Google Ads package)
* **Budget Tier 3: Survival + Marketing + Sales Hire.** (Adds both packages)

# So, When Do We Think About Revenue?

Now. We think about revenue *now*.

With your tiered, expense-based budget in hand, your **forecasting methods** change completely. Your revenue forecast is no longer a hopeful starting point; it's a series of concrete goals tied directly to your operational plan.

* Your **Tier 1 Revenue Goal** is your Break-Even Target. This is non-negotiable.
* Your **Tier 2 Revenue Goal** is the break-even target *plus* the cost of the marketing campaign. This is your first growth goal.
* Your **Tier 3 Revenue Goal** is the break-even target plus the cost of marketing and the new salesperson. This is your aggressive growth goal.

See the difference? The conversation is no longer, ""We hope to make $250,000."" It's, ""To afford the business we want to build, which includes a new salesperson, we *must* generate $250,000 in revenue. Here is the step-by-step plan to get there.""

The revenue forecast is now an output of your strategic planning, not an input for your wishful thinking. It's a target you are actively working towards, backed by a clear, justified, and resilient spending plan.

# Conclusion: Build Your House on Bedrock, Not Sand

The ""Backwards Budget"" is tempting. It’s optimistic and focuses on the exciting part of the business—making money. But it’s an architecture of failure. It builds your financial house on the shifting sands of market uncertainty.

By flipping the model and embracing an expense-first approach like zero-based budgeting, you build your house on the bedrock of operational reality. You gain an unparalleled understanding of what it truly costs to run your business. You cultivate a culture of efficiency and accountability. Every dollar you spend has a purpose.

This isn't about thinking small. It's about thinking smart. It’s about building a lean, resilient, and powerful financial engine that can weather any storm and strategically fuel your growth.

Stop forecasting and start planning. Stop hoping and start controlling. Ditch the ""Backwards Budget"" and build a business that’s designed to last. Your future self—and your bank account—will thank you.

1mn1utv,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADj9Ma1OMJQ,12 Minutes - The “Consistency Cure” I learned from a 70-Year Old Paratrooper,"Kettlebell 12 - ​​[https://cart.chasingstrength.com/kettlebell-12](https://cart.chasingstrength.com/kettlebell-12)  
  
About ten years ago my friend and customer Dr. John Sullivan - then 70, former Army paratrooper and full-time chiropractor - was busy recovering from getting hit by a car (which should’ve killed him) - recapturing function from multiple broken bones…  
While seeing patients.  
He told me about how he was successfully using short, 12-minute workouts using Swings and Snatches on the back end of his strength work - 4 days a week.  
(Dr J later went on to earn his SFG2 Certification - becoming the oldest to do so.)

# How well did they work?

Dr J maintained single digit body fat and could climb a rope using only his hands holding an L-Sit.  
So that got me to thinking…  
If just 12 tiny minutes, four days a week, could re-build a 70-year-old busted up paratrooper, could they rebuild the Average Joe struggling with consistently working out?  
And what would happen if we kept the session micro but went to five weekdays in a row?  
Same 60-minute weekly time-cost - yet an extra rep of the habit loop every week to build workout consistency.  
But you might be wondering - is 12 minutes even worth it?

# Here are some “real world” payoffs:

1- Cardiovascular Health and Increased VO₂max - 12-min swings push HR ≈ 85 % HRmax & VO₂ ≈ 65 % VO₂max—same “vigorous” zone 30–45 min jogs hit (Farrar 2010).  
2- Strength + Power - Two 12-min bouts / wk × 6 wk → half-squat +10 %, vertical jump +20 % (Lake & Lauder 2012).  
3- Anabolic Hormone Boost (Testosterone and Growth Hormone) - Same block spikes GH & testosterone without frying cortisol (Budnar 2014).  
4- Calorie Furnace - Snatch intervals burn ≈ 13 kcal·min⁻¹ - on par with fast running, zero pavement pounding or knee pain (Porcari 2010).  
5- Recovery-Friendly - The dose is small enough to repeat tomorrow. Plus your joints and CNS stay happy.

# Sounds good, right?

But, as Ron Popeil used to say, “Wait, there’s more”...  
Here’s why 5 days a week is the “Consistency Cure”: (Check table on the video)  
Bottom line: Keep the workout tiny, repeat it almost daily, and the habit glues itself in place - results follow.  
Here’s How You Implement This - Your 10-Minute Action Plan  
Write one sentence that reminds you why this matters (e.g., “I train so I can play with my kids and not be exhausted after.”).  
Park your bell next to the coffee maker tonight.  
Tomorrow - every weekday - hit 12 minutes of swings/snatches when the brew finishes.  
Check a box on a wall calendar the instant the buzzer sounds. Watch the streak grow.  
If you need a program to help you get it done, I’ll leave a link to Kettlebell 12 in the video description below.  
It’s a 5 day-a-week plan I built as a result of my “Dr John Epiphany.”  
There’s a novice, intermediate, and advanced plan.  
**Remember:** Consistency isn’t luck - It’s tiny, repeatable wins. Let’s start yours in twelve minutes.  
Stay Strong,  
Geoff Neupert

It’s always a little adjustment being on vacation and my youngest (13yo son) is a high needs kid. He often acts rude and needs to be corrected which wears me out when I’m vacationing with him. (It wears everyone out!)
We had a good first few days at a seaside campsite. Camping is tough and my kids and I have all the right equipment to make it comfortable but it’s just a lot of work. I was feeling overwhelmed here and there, making coffee each morning, lunches before the beach, and generally tidying the campsite. I like that about camping and generally like to be fussing around the campsite but it’s still a lot and wears me out a bit, especially when I’m the only parent which is often the case. 

With no time to really recharge, my BF often lounged around reading, staring at his phone, and generally asks to be told (explicitly) when and how to help- exhausting, but ok. Even when I did give him direction, it came with some frustration and questioning on his part, which just added to my moodiness and exhaustion. 

I opened the door to discuss the tension each day when it seemed possible and we kept getting stuck in a communication spiral- him stating his issues and my reframing mine to try and help him understand. No real acknowledgment came from his side which made me very frustrated. 

By day 5, we both were pretty disconnected. As always, I suggested we work out the tension before starting to plan to the day- the communication issues just kept happening. He ended up slamming his hands in the table and getting really angry. He does this occasionally and I have shared that it doesn’t work for me, for him to get so aggressive and swear towards me- I hate it and it’s very triggering for a person who grew up around DV. 

He blurted out that he thought he needed to just leave. I felt that his saying that was a really important truth for him and expressed my sadness but if that is what he needed to do, it sounded like he had made up his mind. I left to take a walk but prepared my teens by saying he would be going home. 
Sure enough, within an hour, he arranged for a rental car and an uber to take him to the airport so he could drive home in the rental (6.5 hours away). 

I let him know that this was devastating to me and that I don’t feel our relationship would come back from this. I had all the gear, the kids, and now the rest of the travel to now navigate alone. I had never been left before and generally don’t have abandonment issues but this was so painful and new. I think it’s going to be something I need time to process and heal from.

His leaving tormented me the rest of trip and I just wanted to turn around and see him standing there. He never came back but every sound and around every corner, I longed for him to just show up. The pain was haunting me but I tried to stay focused on having a nice time for the kids. I had so much more work to do as a result and he left me with some additional expenses. 

I broke up with him the next day. I let him know that it all was very traumatic and created unnecessary drama for the kids and other people involved. He wrote me a message the next morning saying he had made a big mistake, but I don’t think it is going to work for me to go back to the table with him. He could have taken a day alone or made something else work but he chose to leave. Honestly, this isn’t the first time he has left at a time when I felt I needed support- that’s a big part of my feeling that breaking up is for the best. It’s been almost 3 years and we have a good relationship overall. I do find that I’m not as into the relationship anymore so it’s also an out for me or at least a chance to pause and reflect about what I want. Overall, he tends to be someone who doesn’t stick around and *literally* leaves me holding the bag emotionally. 

Opinions about breaking up or working through it? Anyone been there? What did you do? What would you do?

In fact, how you start your day can set the tone for everything that follows. A 2023 study from the University of Nottingham (""The Impact of Morning Routines on Daily Productivity""), led by Dr. Emily Stone, found that people who dedicate just 10 intentional minutes to their morning routine experience 31% less stress and accomplish 40% more throughout the day.

1. The 2-Minute Mindset Reset

Before checking your phone, take two minutes to breathe deeply and set an intention. Research from Harvard Medical School (2022), conducted by Dr. Herbert Benson, showed that this simple practice lowers cortisol (the stress hormone) by 23% and increases focus.



Try this:

\- Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 6.

\- Whisper one word to define your day (e.g., ""energy,"" ""calm"").



2. The 3-Minute ""Win List""

Instead of a overwhelming to-do list, write down three small wins you want to achieve by noon. A University of California study (2021), led by Dr. Robert Emmons, proved that this trick boosts motivation by 62%.



Example wins:

\- ""Reply to my most important email.""

\- ""Drink a full glass of water.""

\- ""Walk for 5 minutes.""



3. The 5-Minute ""Body Wake-Up""

Your body needs to move to shake off sleep inertia. A 2022 study in The Journal of Physiology, led by Dr. Kelly Starrett, found that five minutes of dynamic stretching increases alertness as effectively as a cup of coffee.



Quick routine:

\- Arm circles (1 min)

\- Toe touches (1 min)

\- Torso twists (1 min)

\- Jumping jacks (2 min)



4. The 10-Second Gratitude Boost

Gratitude isn’t just fluffy advice—it’s neuroscience. A University of Miami study (2023), directed by Dr. Michael McCullough, revealed that thinking of one thing you’re grateful for (even your pillow!) triggers dopamine, the ""feel-good"" chemical.



Pro tip: Pair this with brushing your teeth to build the habit.



5. The ""No-Screen"" First 10 Minutes

Resist the urge to scroll. A Stanford study (2021) by Dr. Anna Lembke found that delaying screen time for just 10 minutes after waking:

\- Reduces anxiety by 27%

\- Improves mental clarity



Swap scrolling for:

\- Sipping water

\- Looking out the window

\- Stretching



Why These Tricks Work

Your brain is most impressionable right after waking—a state called ""neuroplasticity priming."" A 2023 MIT study by Dr. John Gabrieli showed that habits formed in the first 10 minutes of the day are 5x more likely to stick.



Real-Life Success Stories

\- Fitness coach Jillian Michaels starts her day with 3 minutes of meditation (no excuses).

\- Author James Clear writes his ""win list"" while his coffee brews.

Make It Unmissable

Place reminders where you’ll see them:

\- A sticky note on your mirror: ""Breathe first.""

\- A water bottle by your bed.

\- Your phone in another room overnight.

##‌ Key ⁣Features Analysis

The best black electric tea kettles boast a range of⁤ features designed to⁢ improve​ efficiency, safety,⁣ and overall user experience. These features differentiate models and contribute to their suitability for different needs and preferences.

**Rapid ⁣Boiling Technology:** Modern electric tea kettles utilize powerful heating elements to ⁣achieve rapid​ boiling times.

Rapid boiling technology is essential for busy individuals and families who need hot water quickly. Many kettles can boil⁤ water in as little as 3-5 minutes, a significant enhancement over traditional stovetop kettles. This technology often involves a concealed heating element, which not only speeds⁤ up the boiling process but also makes cleaning easier. It ‍ensures that water is heated evenly ⁣and efficiently, minimizing energy ‍waste.

**Precise Temperature Control:** Advanced models offer variable temperature settings, catering to different ⁤types of tea and beverages.

Precise⁣ temperature control is crucial for brewing the perfect cup of tea ‌or coffee. Different types of tea, such as green,⁣ black, or oolong, ⁢require specific water temperatures to extract their optimal flavour. Kettles with ⁢this feature allow users to ‌select the precise temperature needed, typically ranging from 170°F to 212°F. This ensures⁤ that​ delicate tea leaves are not ⁤scalded and⁣ that the full flavor profile is ⁤unlocked.

**Durable construction Materials:** High-quality kettles are made from stainless steel or borosilicate glass for longevity and ⁢safety.Durable construction materials are critical for the ⁢longevity and safety of an electric ⁣tea‍ kettle. stainless steel is​ a popular choice for ⁤its durability, resistance to rust and corrosion, and its clean, modern appearance. Borosilicate ⁢glass is another excellent option, as it is heat-resistant and does ‍not impart any unwanted flavors or odors to the water. high-quality materials ensure that the kettle can withstand daily use ⁤and maintain its performance over⁣ time.

1mn1lru,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mn1lru,Can you really “know” a cigar after only one?,"This afternoon, I finally busted out the Davidoff Late Hour Churchill. It seems this line has been mentioned a number of times today, but I digress. I’ve had five in my humidor for a few days more than two months (after spending an unknown amount of time at the tobacconist). I had purchased a single for $30 and a four pack for just over $100 *on sale*. I have read plenty of reviews on the Late Hour line; “Vastly different than regular Davidoffs” and “The best Davidoff period” and “You will be impressed” are but a few of the plaudits floating around about this line. 

I simply disagree.

As I’ve mentioned on numerous occasions in many threads here on this sub, I find Davidoff to be one of the most mediocre cigars – especially given their price point – available for purchase. My mindset with this cigar though was “I’ve both read and been told this line is different/better, so let’s give it a run.”

So, my humidor for just over two months, the tobacconist’s humidor for who knows how long, *and* I even dry boxed this cigar overnight. 

It had a great nose to me - bread from a toaster and baking spices (in particular, cinnamon and nutmeg). The cold draw was semi sweet cocoa. Really nice. 

After lighting, I got some really nice flavors of light black coffee and leather. Again, nice.

But then, it started to burn wonky, and it kept going out. When I did get it to stay lit, it honest to God reminded me of a fire cured cigar. There was a large vein running almost the length of the cigar. When I say “large,” I mean big enough for it to be noticed running under both cigar bands (see the photos). Entirely *not* what I’m looking for from a $25-$30 Davidoff not what should be expected from a cigar of this price point. I will say, however, I felt the smell was wonderful, not indicative of what I was actually trying to smoke. 

The second and final third gave me yet more burn problems, two more relights, and only a faint hint of the scotch barrel tobacco “aging” that Davidoff brags about with these. 

It wasn’t *all* bad. It *was* very earthy and a leather forward cigar and I really dig those flavors. It started off as a low, medium strength cigar but from the halfway point till I stop smoking, this was very full bodied. I enjoyed that.

My mindset even now though is that the very mediocre experience I had today with this cigar can be - *and is* - found in vastly cheaper cigars. Further, a *much better* experience IS found in much cheaper cigars; just go back a day or so, and read my review of the new Stolen Throne Castle 919. That cigar was $11 and IMO, straight blew this Davidoff off out of the water in every single facet.

*Is it fair to give high praise to a cigar I like after smoking just one while needing to smoke multiples of those I don’t just to see if I got a dud?* 

I’m surely in the minority here about this line - and probably about Davidoff in general, but that’s okay. I just now I have to figure out what to do with the four more Late Hour Churchill’s that are taking up space in my humidor…

Bound By Love: Marrying My Disabled Husband 


Chapter 1

 How About We Get Married

""Where are you going?""

At the wedding, Elyse Lloyd was in a panic as she grabbed Theo Ward's wrist to stop him from leaving, her eyes filling with pleading.

The venue was filled with the family and friends of both parties, all seated and waiting. The officiant had posed the question to Theo about his willingness to marry Elyse. Instead of replying, he ignored the officiant, answered his phone, and then abruptly attempted to leave.

""Kaelyn knows about our wedding, and now she's threatening to jump off a building. You are aware of her depression, aren't you? I have to go save her,"" Theo explained impatiently and pushed Elyse aside.

The push caused Elyse to sprain her ankle, and as she fell to the floor, she awkwardly stretched out her hand, trying to hold him back.

""Today is our wedding day! What am I supposed to do if you leave? Kaelyn Bennett totally stabbed you in the back before. She's caused you so much pain-why the heck must you go see her right now?""

Theo's gaze turned even colder. ""You're not in a position to judge what happened between me and Kaelyn. No matter her wrongs or the pain she caused, you don't measure up to her.”

""Where are you going?""

At the wedding, Elyse Lloyd was in a panic as she grabbed Theo Ward's wrist to stop him from leaving, her eyes filling with pleading.

The venue was filled with the family and friends of both parties, all seated and waiting. The officiant had posed the question to Theo about his willingness to marry Elyse. Instead of replying, he ignored the officiant, answered his phone, and then abruptly attempted to leave.

""Kaelyn knows about our wedding, and now she's threatening to jump off a building. You are aware of her depression, aren't you? I have to go save her,"" Theo explained impatiently and pushed Elyse aside.

""Today is our wedding day! What am I supposed to do if you leave? Kaelyn Bennett totally stabbed you in the back before. She's caused you so much pain-why the heck must you go see her right now?""

Theo's gaze turned even colder. ""You're not in a position to judge what happened between me and Kaelyn. No matter her wrongs or the pain she caused, you don't measure up to her.""

A pain struck Elyse's heart. She realized that he had never truly forgotten Kaelyn. To him, she would never be as significant as Kaelyn was.

""What did I do to deserve this? Why are you treating me this way? Please, just wait until the wedding is over. We're almost at the point of exchanging rings. You can leave after that” 
with your wedding than a living person's life. You're so heartless. Let's reschedule the wedding.""

Without a glance at her pale face, he strode away from the ornate altar, oblivious to the puzzled looks of gathered guests.

As the groom left, the crowd erupted into chaos.

""No, please don't leave me, Theo! What should I do if you leave?"" Elyse cried out, sitting pitifully on the floor. She trembled, tears ruining her carefully applied makeup.

The man she had loved for three years, disregarding her dignity, had chosen another woman without a second thought on their big day. He was consumed with thoughts of Kaelyn's distress but seemed indifferent to how lost and humiliated she felt, left alone at the altar. All around her, countless eyes watched, some mocking, some pitying, and others even gloating. Elyse had never felt such torment!

Her father, Lanny Lloyd, approached. She hoped for comfort, but instead, he scolded her sharply, ""You can't even keep a man. How useless!"" After berating her, he left with his wife, Glenda Lloyd, without a backward glance.

Her sister, Mabel Lloyd, emerged from the crowd with a smirk. ""Well, that's embarrassing, Elyse. Your groom ran off, and now you're a laughingstock. I'm embarrassed for you. Imagine how Mom and Dad feel."" After saying that, she turned and left.

One by one, all of Elyse's family members departed, leaving her completely alone. Initially, Theo's parents felt guilty, but upon witnessing her family's reaction, all traces of guilt dissipated.

""Even her own parents didn't support her. It seems this isn't entirely Theo's fault.""

""Yes, if she were a good partner, why would her fiancé leave her?""

""Did she cheat on him? What else would make a groom leave like that?”

The murmurs of criticism from the surrounding guests grew louder and harsher.

Suddenly, there were noises nearby.

Turning around, Elyse spotted a man in a suit sitting alone in a wheelchair. The officiant, looking flustered, asked, ""Where is your bride?""

Wiping away her tears, she halted a passing staff member and inquired, ""That man is a groom, right? Where is his bride?""

The staff member glanced at her and responded, ""She didn't show up. I heard it was because she couldn't deal with her husband's disability.""

""And he's been waiting here all this time?""

The staff member nodded.

The wheelchair-bound groom was facing away from Elyse, and they were a fair distance apart. She couldn't see his expression, but she understood the pain of being left alone.

They were both unfortunate souls, abandoned.

After a moment of reflection, a determined look settled in Elyse's eyes.

She had loved Theo for three years, but he had betrayed her. Why should she remain loyal to him? She realized she didn't need to be with him at all.

As she suddenly stood up, the guests who had been whispering and mocking her fell silent. All eyes instinctively focused on her as she lifted the hem of her dress and confidently walked toward the man in the wheelchair.

The sight of a bride in a white wedding dress approaching left the man's guests equally stunned.

Hearing the rustle of her dress, the man in the wheelchair turned around slowly.

Elyse halted and gazed at the handsome man before her, a spark of surprise in her eyes. She then extended her hand and said, ""Hello, I heard you're in need of a bride. My groom just left me. How about we get married?”


Chapter 2 What Was She Up To

""My name is Elyse Lloyd. If it's all right with you, we can get married today,"" she proposed confidently.

Her bold proposal left the crowd in shock, prompting several to capture the moment with their phones.

""Miss Lloyd, are you certain about this decision? Given my disability, I may not be able to provide the future you envision,"" the man replied openly, without hiding his condition, and gently urged her to think it over.

""I've made up my mind,"" Elyse responded with determination.

""I'm Jayden,"" he introduced himself.

Seeing her resolve, Jayden Owen grasped her hand and shared his concern, ""I fear you might regret this choice later on.""

Elyse chose not to respond. She was sure of her decision. She had once been solely focused on marrying Theo, who never truly reciprocated her love. Now, who she married seemed inconsequential.

After efficiently wrapping up the wedding formalities at City Hall, Elyse and Jayden were now bound by matrimony, officially united as husband and wife.

With the marriage certificate in hand, Elyse experienced a profound sense of relief.

Theo had broken her heart, and she was resolute in never returning to him.

Regarding her father, since she would not be marrying into the Ward family, he had another daughter to think about.

She understood her little sister Mabel too well. As someone driven by greed, how could Mabel resist the temptation to become Theo's wife and a member of the Ward family?

Thus, marrying Jayden was Elyse's perfect escape from her family's clutches. She had no intention of going back home again.

While she gazed thoughtfully at the marriage certificate, Jayden asked, ""What's on your mind? Regretting your decision to marry a disabled man?""

Elyse shook her head, took hold of the wheelchair, and replied, ""I think it was a good decision.""

Jayden smiled slightly, though his eyes betrayed a hint of skepticism and mistrust.

How could any woman genuinely want to marry a disabled man? He figured she was just putting on an act-an act that couldn't last forever.

He needed a bride momentarily to distract his family while he pursued his own goals. Well, he decided, he might as well see what she was up to.

Elyse helped Jayden into the car, and they drove to his house.

Jayden's home was opulent, complete with a garden and a swimming pool, and staffed with a butler in a tuxedo and uniformed maids.

As Elyse stepped onto the plush wool carpet, she truly realized that her new husband was far from ordinary.

The butler, Driscoll Lee, approached them respectfully and inquired, ""Mr. Owen, is this your bride?""

Surveying the opulent house and recollecting her newlywed husband's full name, a sudden realization dawned on Elyse.

The Owens were the most influential family in town, and Jayden Owen was particularly notable among his peers for his business acumen and exceptional talent. He was one of the wealthiest men around. However, after a car accident a year ago that cost him his legs, Jayden had faded from the public eye and his prior achievements were largely forgotten.

So, she had married the legendary Jayden Owen?

Elyse recalled hearing rumors about his engagement to a girl from the Foster family. The bride who had disappeared on her wedding day was supposed to be that Foster girl.

Upon hearing Jayden's full name at City Hall, Elyse hadn't dwelled on it much. If she had known his background sooner, she wouldn't have had the courage to broach the topic of marriage with him.

Jayden noticed the shock and panic on her face but remained silent. He still doubted that she truly hadn't recognized him. After all, his disability was well known.

""This is Elyse Lloyd, my wife. From now on, she will be the hostess here,"" Jayden introduced her firmly.

""Joanna Foster escaped on our wedding day because she didn't want to marry a disabled man,"" he added bluntly.

""Joanna Foster disappeared on the wedding day?"" Driscoll expressed his surprise. The Foster family had been eager to forge a union with the Owen family through marriage, pushing for Jayden to marry Joanna.

On the wedding day, however, the bride had disappeared. Wasn't this a deliberate humiliation of Jayden?

Driscoll felt sympathy for him and offered some consolation, ""Sir, perhaps it's for the best that she left. It seems you might have found the right person after all.""

Elyse had shown no concern for Jayden's disability and was willing to marry him. That indeed counted for something.

Chapter 3 He Could Walk Fluidly

Looking at Jayden's legs, Elyse felt a wave of sympathy for him. Jayden had once been at the pinnacle of success, and now he seemed so vulnerable. Just because he was disabled, his bride had callously abandoned him at the altar, showing him no respect whatsoever. He must have felt even more devastated than she did during the wedding.

Approaching Jayden, Elyse took his hand and said earnestly, ""Don't worry. We are husband and wife now. I will take care of you for the rest of our lives.""

Jayden's expression turned rigid. Could she really mean it, promising to take care of him for a lifetime? He doubted her sincerity, thinking she was just putting on an act of compassion.

Without a word, Jayden maneuvered his wheelchair into the study on the first floor.

""I'm sorry,"" Driscoll said apologetically. ""Since his accident, he's been a bit more temperamental.""

""It's fine. I understand,"" Elyse replied, dismissing it with a wave of her hand. Anyone in his situation might change.

She then followed Driscoll upstairs to a room on the second floor.

""Sir.""

In the study stood a bald man named Vinny Bailey, clad in a tight black shirt that accentuated his prominent tendons.

Respectfully, Vinny ignited a lighter and lit a cigar for Jayden.

""Joanna has gone abroad. The Foster family is desperately trying to come up with a solution.""

""They've taken thirty million and five major projects from me. Is this their way of repaying me?""

Jayden let out a puff of smoke and remarked casually, ""If I don't teach them a lesson, others will see me as a pushover. The Fosters need to learn a few things.""

""Do you want us to bring Joanna back?"" Vinny inquired, nodding. ""And as for your new wife, should we make some introductions with our men?""

""No need.""

Jayden, cigar clenched between his teeth, lifted a document from the desk and strolled over to the window.

The wheelchair was tucked away in a corner of the room, ignored, as he moved fluidly across the floor.

This document detailed Elyse's entire life, from her childhood through to her college life, even including her romance with Theo.

He casually flipped through the pages ages and drawled, ""An ordinary woman. She married me just for my money.”

Back then, the Owens had declared their search for a wife for Jayden, aiming simply to secure an heir.

Upon the announcement, no wealthy family was eager to marry their daughter to him, except for the Fosters, who had enriched themselves through their daughters' marriage.

The Fosters' motive was straightforward to exchange their daughter for resources and money.

Vinny saw no other reason for Elyse to marry Jayden but for financial gain.

Yet, there was another twist. ""She was originally going to marry Theo Ward.""

""Ward? The Ward family that's well-known?"" Jayden lifted an eyebrow.

""Yes. But apparently, the groom ran off to reunite with his ex- girlfriend after receiving a phone call.""

Vinny paused, then speculated, ""Maybe she married you just to spite Theo Ward.""

Jayden ceased perusing the documents and glanced up at Vinny with a hint of annoyance. ""You're looking at it too simplistically. By marrying me, she stands to gain more. That's the real reason she married me, despite my disability.""

In Jayden's eyes, Elyse hadn't yet revealed her true intentions. But he didn't mind her interest in his money.

He needed a wife to appease his family. If she married him for gain, it would make a future divorce simpler for him.

Perched on the edge of the bed, Elysee scrolled through her phone and noticed the trending topics.

#BridegroomRanAwayForHis Ex

#BrideMarriesStrangerToAngerHerRanawayGroom

She casually scrolled through the comments. The public deemed the entire situation unbelievable and both parties' actions as unreasonable. Nevertheless, discussions had thrust Elyse's name into circulation because of it.

Some even discovered she was a violinist in an orchestra and stumbled upon a video of her past performance.

Unable to resist, Elyse was watching these videos when Theo called. ""Where are you, Elyse? Let's meet and talk.”

Chapter 4 Who Were You Married To

As Elyse descended the stairs to the villa's entrance, Driscoll approached her with concern. ""It's quite late. Where are you off to? Shall I arrange a car for you?""

""No, thanks. I'll be back soon.""

Driscoll watched her depart before heading to the study.

Elyse, having agreed to meet Theo, called a taxi and was soon en route.

Fifteen minutes later, she entered a coffee shop and instantly noticed Theo, who was in high spirits, busy texting on his phone. A flicker of sarcasm crossed her eyes as she approached and sat across from him.

Theo looked up, his expression souring. ""Why are you so late? Do you have any idea how long I've been waiting?""

Staring back at him, Elyse felt a chill. They had been together for a long time, yet he was always domineering toward her, a stark contrast to his demeanor with Kaelyn.

She had once loved him, believing she could endure anything. Only today had she realized how foolish that was.

If she didn't love herself, how could she expect anyone else to love her?
""If you don't want to wait, you can leave,"" Elyse retorted icily.

Theo, taken aback by her response, grew visibly more upset. ""You're holding a grudge about what happened at the wedding, aren't you? 1 get why you're upset, but you can't be more understanding and reasonable? I left because Kaelyn was in dire straits-she was depressed and contemplating suicide.""

""You can go to anyone you want. You don't need to explain anything to me-I don't care anymore."" Elyse found humor in his words.

Theo couldn't believe she was indifferent. They had been together for three years, and everyone knew how deeply she loved him.

He thought her claim of indifference was merely a result of anger. But he was confident he could easily resolve this. Just a few sweet words and she'd come back to him.

""It's not a big deal. I came back to you after handling everything, didn't I? I'll visit your parents soon, and we can start planning the wedding again,"" Theo said.

""No need for that.""

""What?""

""There won't be a wedding."" Elyse's face was devoid of emotion. ""We're done.""

""Why are you still upset? I left at the wedding, but I came back for you. Can't you forgive me?"" Theo frowned.

""Forgive you? Forgive you for abandoning me for another woman?"" Elyse slammed her hand on the table. ""Do you have any idea what I've

been through since you left? Your family has been calling me names, even though you were the one who left me at the altar- just for another woman!""

""Elyse Lloyd!"" Theo shouted her name furiously. ""What others say is their issue. Isn't our three-year relationship strong enough for you to trust me?""

""Three years, and yet you never forgot your ex,"" Elyse countered, her face marked by disappointment. ""I believed we'd be together forever, but it seems three years was our limit. We're done, Theo. It's clear we're not suited for each other.""

While speaking, she retrieved a ring from her bag and set it down on the table-the same ring he had used to propose.

She recalled the joy she felt that day, now overshadowed by her current despair.

Elyse gave Theo one last look, mentally closing the chapter on their three years together. She grabbed her bag and departed without a backward glance.

Theo was stunned. Was Elyse dumping him? He always saw her as a simp, her family reliant on his. How could she just walk away?

Humiliated, he chased after her, grabbed her shoulder, and said forcefully, ""You have no right to break things off! Remember, your father's business relies on me. Without me, your family has nothing. Come back, and we'll marry in a few days to make up for today!""

""Let me go!"" Elyse fought back fiercely and yelled with defiance and frustration, ""I'm married. Stop bothering me!”

""So what if you are married! You will always belong to me.""

After blurting that out, he froze and asked incredulously, ""What did you say? You're married? Who to?""

While he was momentarily dazed, Elyse wriggled free from his grip. She hadn't anticipated turning around to find Jayden sitting in a wheelchair quietly a few meters behind her. ""Jayden!"" she exclaimed.


Chapter 5 You Can Stand

""Didn't I make it clear? I'm married. We're over. This is my husband,"" Elyse said as she quickly moved to Jayden's side, gripping his arm.

Theo stared at Jayden, failing to recognize him. With a sneer, he said, ""To get back at me, you married a disabled man?"" He then extended his hand, commanding in a domineering tone, ""Elyse, come here! I'll make it up to you when we get back.""

But Elyse looked at him as if he were a stranger.

""Did you hear me? Come here!"" Theo grew frustrated.

Elyse reflected on how she would have responded in the past-she would definitely walk over to his side.

She had loved him deeply for three years. Her feelings had been genuine. Yet, the depth of her affection made the betrayal harder to bear.

On her first birthday after they got together, she wanted to celebrate it by the sea. To make her happy, Theo bought a camera, promising to capture beautiful photos of her. As they were about to board the plane for their trip to the seaside, Kaelyn was injured on a film set and called Theo. Without any hesitation, Theo left her stranded at the airport. It was the most disappointing birthday Elyse had ever experienced.

Theo had once vowed to attend her debut performance with her
orchestra, yet she ended up not seeing him there. She lingered in the hall all night, only to learn the next day that he had missed the performance because Kaelyn had become drunk at a dinner party while trying to land a role. He stayed because he was worried she might be taken advantage of.

For three years, he had been Kaelyn's protector, but he had never offered Elyse the same safeguard.

This accumulation of disappointments came to a head at the wedding. She knew she deserved love and respect, not neglect.

""I am Jayden's wife now. I owe my loyalty to him,"" declared Elyse with a chill in her voice.

""Elyse Lloyd!"" Theo roared, enraged. He thought Elyse was merely being spiteful and fabricating things due to the day's incidents

As he tried to seize her hand, Jayden intervened, blocking him swiftly.

Theo struggled to free his hand, but was unable to. He couldn't overpower a disabled man? The realization pissed him off...

""Release me!"" Theo exploded with anger.

""She has no desire to leave with you. Can't you understand?"" Jayden pressed slowly, his force causing Theo's features to twist in distress.

Jayden held on until Theo cried out in pain before releasing him.

""Remember this day, Elyse. You'll regret it in the future! With a hint of embarrassment, Theo glared at Elyse and stormed off after his declaration

Watching him leave, Elyse felt a bitter smile form within her. She knew Theo would not easily let go of being humiliated, but there was no turning back for them now.

""Let's go home, Elyse.""

""Okay.""

After helping Jayden into the car, they both sat silently, gazing out the window and avoiding any mention of Theo.

""How did you know I was out here?"" Elyse asked, her curiosity piqued.

Without turning to face her, Jayden replied, ""Driscoll mentioned it wasn't safe for you to be alone at this hour, so I came to pick you up.""

In truth, he had suspected she was up to something secretive, but it turned out she was merely meeting her ex. This revelation left him slightly disappointed.

""Since you've married me, you should sever ties with your ex. My family members are strict, and I can't cover for you if they find out you're still seeing another man.""

""I won't see him again. I met him just to return a ring,"" Elyse responded, nodding.

Jayden said nothing more. As long as Elyse respected his boundaries, she was free to make her own choices.

When they arrived home, Elyse noticed Jayden heading straight for the study again. Curious, she asked Driscoll, ""Why is he always in the study?""

""The study is not only his workplace, but it has also become a sanctuary for his soul,"" Driscoll explained.

""And why doesn't he return to his room?""

""He does sometimes, but we rarely know when. He prefers that we don't fuss over him too much.""

With that, Driscoll departed. After freshening up in her room, Elyse was preparing for bed, but her thoughts lingered on the day's events with Jayden. She realized that despite his reserved nature, he was genuinely concerned for her safety.

Feeling grateful and wanting to express her thanks, she left her room and walked towards the study. As she approached, she noticed the door was slightly ajar, casting a sliver of light into the hallway.

Elyse pushed the door open and to her surprise, saw Jayden standing. She gasped and asked, ""Jayden, you can stand?”

Chapter 6 Determined To Pursue Her Dream

Jayden hadn't expected her to come, so in a panic, he decided to let himself fall to the floor.

Seeing Jayden crash down and struggle to sit up with the help of his wheelchair, Elyse shivered. Was Jayden using the solitude of the study to secretly practice standing?

""What are you doing here?"" Jayden asked from the floor, his tone brimming with impatience after several failed attempts to rise.

Realizing she had stumbled upon the very thing Jayden wished to keep hidden, Elyse was consumed by guilt. ""I'm sorry. I just came to tell you to go to bed.""

""It's unnecessary. Just leave me alone,"" he snapped, seemingly wounded in his pride.

Elyse felt the sting of his words. She wanted to offer comfort, but Driscoll had mentioned that Jayden might never stand again. Any attempt to console him now seemed disingenuous.

After a moment of silence, she murmured, ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude."" Then she turned and headed back to her room.

Jayden listened to her footsteps recede and only stood up once he was certain she was gone.

Dusting off his legs, he realized he had been too careless. He would have to be more cautious in the future, lest she discover his pretense of disability.

Meanwhile, Elyse lay in bed, ridden with guilt, unable to sleep. She felt as though she had deeply hurt Jayden.

The next morning, as Elyse stepped out of her room and descended the stairs, she noticed Jayden was absent. Curiosity piqued, she asked Driscoll, ""Where is Jayden?""

""He regularly goes to the hospital for check-ups. He's there now with the family doctor.""

""Why didn't he tell me he was going? I could have gone with him,"" Elyse inquired.

Driscoll sighed. ""He didn't want you to hear from the doctor that he can never stand again. That's why he chose not to tell you.""

Elyse sighed, feeling a pang of sympathy for him. ""I have to go to work. I won't be back for lunch.""

After breakfast, she grabbed her purse and left.

Today, the orchestra was holding selections for a tour. The selected performers would go on tour.

Having cherished playing the violin since childhood, Elyse dreamed of becoming the concertmaster. Determined not to let this chance slip by, she headed to the event.

Upon reaching the third floor, she encountered Rebekah Bentley exiting her office.

Noticing the registration form in Elyse's hand, Rebekah's eyes filled with disdain. ""You're trying out for the tour?"" she scoffed.

""Anyone can apply,"" Elyse replied, nodding while choosing to overlook Rebekah's dismissive tone.

Rebekah sneered again. ""It seems this year's selection won't be much of a challenge.""

""Agreed. I knew I would succeed if my rival were you,"" Elyse said confidently.

After her remark, she walked straight up to Rebekah and brushed past her. ""You're in my way.""

""You're saying I'm in your way?"" Rebekah responded, her anger flaring.

Elyse chose not to reply.

A year ago, she and Rebekah had both joined the orchestra as violinists and were frequently compared. Rebekah had always been hostile, making it clear they would never be friends, only rivals.

Upon entering the office, Elyse approached an elderly but elegant woman who was organizing the registration forms. She handed over her form and said, ""Ms. Hopkins, here is my registration form.""

Wanda Hopkins instinctively frowned upon seeing the form. ""Are you sure you want to participate? You're not going to ask me to retract your form like last year, are you?”

Elyse bowed her head, feeling a twinge of embarrassment. Last year, she had submitted her form but withdrew because her mother Glenda had interfered, blocking her path.

Wanda, recognizing Elyse's talent, had urged her not to squander the opportunity, but her efforts had been in vain.

""No, I won't. I'm not wasting any more opportunities. I'm determined to pursue my dream, and nothing will stop me this time.""

1mn17bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeemeetsbagel/comments/1mn17bk/question_for_ideally_somebody_who_works_for/,Question for ideally somebody who works for coffee meets bagel,"so since you changed your policies, I guess about a year or two ago where you don’t let people see who likes them unless you pay, I noticed I have something like on average about 40 likes. Some days it jumps to 45 or 48 and then sometimes it falls to 43. I suspect of those may be only one or two actually match my specifics/preferences. So now I have not paid to view it. If I was convinced 40 out of 45 matched, I would probably bite the bullet and pay, but that does not convince me given that I only swipe on people I like, and if both people swipe like I assume I would be notified automatically whether I pay or not. That’s not my question. 

My question is, so today, I noticed for the first time it jumped from 48 to 36 and I’m just wondering if you can explain what happened to the other 12 people. like does someone have to actively somehow unlike me because we’ve never actually matched or is it possible we matched up because I didn’t pay, I don’t realize I matched with someone? why did these 12 people all decide that today Sunday, August 10 they are going to delete their profile, or were these never real people to begin with?

although I’m sure many people’s numbers are different and I’m sure women are probably in the many hundreds if not thousands and maybe a lot of guys are closer to my numbers or possibly a little bit more or a little bit less, but I am sure everybody has noticed that their numbers fluctuate sometimes by a little and sometimes buy a lot and does anyone at all have a clue what creates that fluctuation? like if I paid tonight, I won’t ever see those 12 missing people? Bottom line:what happened to them overnight?

just seems like this app or it’s algorithm plays games that are not adding up logically. If somebody that works for CMB can make sense of this for me, I would greatly appreciate it.

If anyone else thinks they know, or has a theory, please share as well, although I would prefer facts to just surmising. Ty!

I asked them about it, and they said they are to be ground up as a drink that gives energy. 

So naturally, I put it in a beer. The Oily Oaf, specifically. They looked at me funny and said to put it in water. Assuming they had no idea what they were talking about, I tried it both ways. I must say, lads, that Coffee on its own wasn’t too bad, for a product made by humans. It’s quite bitter when drunk as is, but doesn’t mix well with straight beer. 

I learned later that there was a rumor going around that us dwarves were allergic to something called “caffeine”, and that crew of the cargo ship was taking bets. If coffee wasn’t such a hit with the crew, it would go right in the book of grudges.

# Best Pure Organic Layered Fruit Bars [2025 Reviews]

The pure organic layered fruit bar market is booming, driven by health-conscious consumers seeking convenient and nutritious snacks. These bars offer a wholesome choice to conventional processed snacks, packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Choosing the right one, however, requires careful consideration of ingredients, taste, texture, and overall nutritional profile. This review delves into the best pure organic layered fruit bars available in 2025, providing a comprehensive analysis to help you make an informed decision for your healthy snacking needs.

[[Explore Top rated pure organic layered fruit bars on Amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=pure organic layered fruit bars)

## Key Features Analysis

The top contenders in the pure organic layered fruit bar category boast several key features that differentiate them from conventional snacks and even from each other.

**Certified Organic Ingredients:** The most crucial aspect is the sourcing of ingredients. The best bars use fruits, nuts, and seeds that are certified organic by recognized agencies. This certification guarantees that the ingredients are grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers, minimizing exposure to harmful chemicals. Look for certifications like USDA Organic or similar labels from reputable organizations to ensure the validity of the organic claims.

**Variety of Layered Flavors:** The layered construction isn't just about aesthetics; it's about creating complex flavor profiles. Top bars feature distinct layers offering different textures and tastes, ranging from creamy nut butter bases to tangy fruit purees and crunchy seed toppings. The interplay of these flavors provides a more satisfying and engaging snacking experience compared to single-flavor bars.

**High Fiber Content:** Fiber plays a vital role in digestive health, promoting satiety and regulating blood sugar levels. Leading pure organic layered fruit bars provide a meaningful amount of dietary fiber per serving, typically ranging from 3 to 5 grams. This fiber often comes from sources like oats, nuts, seeds, and fruit pulp, contributing to a feeling of fullness and sustained energy.

**Minimal Added Sugar:** One of the biggest drawbacks of many snack bars is their high sugar content. The best pure organic layered fruit bars prioritize natural sweetness from fruits, minimizing or eliminating added sugars like refined sugar, corn syrup, or artificial sweeteners. Some bars may use small amounts of natural sweeteners like maple syrup or honey, but these should be used sparingly and transparently listed on the ingredient label.

**gluten-Free and Allergen-Pleasant Options:** Recognizing the growing prevalence of food allergies and sensitivities, many brands now offer gluten-free and allergen-friendly versions of their layered fruit bars. These bars are formulated without common allergens like gluten, dairy, soy, and peanuts, making them accessible to a wider range of consumers. However, it is crucial to always double-check the ingredient list to ensure the bar is safe for your specific dietary needs.

**Sustainable Packaging:** Environmental obligation is increasingly vital to consumers. Forward-thinking brands are adopting sustainable packaging solutions for their fruit bars like compostable wrappers or recycled materials. this not only reduces the environmental impact of the product but also aligns with the values of health-conscious and eco-aware consumers.

## Core Benefits

Pure organic layered fruit bars offer a multitude of benefits, making them a smart choice for health-conscious individuals.**Sustained Energy Boost:** These bars provide a slow and steady release of energy due to their combination of complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and fiber. Unlike sugary snacks that cause a rapid spike and crash in blood sugar, layered fruit bars offer sustained energy levels, keeping you feeling full and focused for longer periods. This makes them ideal for pre- or post-workout snacks, mid-afternoon pick-me-ups, or on-the-go fuel.

**Nutrient-Rich Snacking:** Packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants from fruits, nuts, and seeds, these bars contribute to overall health and well-being. The specific nutrients vary depending on the ingredients used,but they generally provide essential vitamins like vitamin C and vitamin E,minerals like potassium and magnesium,and beneficial antioxidants that fight free radicals and protect cells from damage.

**Convenient and Portable:** Their compact size and individually wrapped packaging make these bars incredibly convenient for on-the-go snacking. Weather you're traveling, hiking, or simply running errands, you can easily stash a fruit bar in your bag or pocket for a swift and healthy fuel source. They eliminate the need for unhealthy fast food options or sugary vending machine snacks.

**Supports Digestive Health:** The high fiber content of these bars promotes healthy digestion by adding bulk to the stool, preventing constipation, and supporting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. A healthy gut microbiome is essential for overall health, playing a role in immunity, nutrient absorption, and even mental well-being.

**Mindful Indulgence:** The layered flavors and textures provide a satisfying sensory experience that feels like a treat without the guilt. This allows you to indulge your cravings in a healthy way, satisfying your sweet tooth while nourishing your body with wholesome ingredients. The variety of flavor combinations keeps things interesting and prevents snack fatigue.

## FAQs Section

**Are pure organic layered fruit bars suitable for children?**
Yes, in moderation. They're generally a healthier option than sugary candies or processed snacks. However,always check the ingredient list for potential allergens and consider the sugar content,even if it's from natural sources. Opt for bars with lower added sugar and whole fruit as the primary ingredient.

**Can these bars be used as a meal replacement?**
While nutrient-dense, typically they are not designed as complete meal replacements. They lack the protein and calorie density of a full meal. They are best used as snacks between meals to tide you over until your next proper eating occasion.

**how should I store pure organic layered fruit bars?**
Store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. This helps maintain their texture and prevents them from becoming too soft or melting. Some bars may benefit from refrigeration, especially in warmer climates. Check the packaging for specific storage instructions.

**Are all pure organic layered fruit bars vegan?**
Not all. Some may contain ingredients like honey or dairy-based components in the layering. Look for the ""vegan"" label or carefully scrutinize the ingredient list if you are following a strict vegan diet.

Recently, I purchased my first real grinder (1Zpresso K-Ultra) after ordering some pretty good quality coffee and being unsure of what grind to choose. Figured this was a great excuse to really take the dive into really learning the full scope pourover coffee beyond the fooling around I've done with an aeropress or phin and preground stuff. 

I had this old bag of Caribou coffee beans in the freezer that we never opened because... we didn't have a grinder😁 After making a few batches the last few days, it made sense to go ahead and bulk-grind the rest of this bag for others in the house to use to get it gone. 
After 7-8 back to back batches, it became obvious I might need a shoulder replacement before I finished grinding the bag continuously, so I hatched the idea!

The chuck connects solidly to the shaft of the K-Ultra, and running it at low speeds made MUCH easier work of the beans! The burr does seem to get a little warmer than hand grinding back to back, but giving it 30-45s to cool between batches kept it from getting above ""just barely warm to the touch"" to keep it safe!

High energy yet frozen with everything that i could do. At the begining of my college baseball season, i had incredible pain, so much pain i couldn't lift my leg to get into the car or on my bed. a year later find out its Ankylosing Spondylitis. Autoimmune disease that literally fuses my bones together if left unmaintained for long periods of time. Struggled at college and just couldn't understand why i couldnt function as ""highly"" as other people but also felt leagues ahead of others. plus the hip pain. So parents offered for me to move back in. They said ""we are building a house you can rent and live in. My brain clicks, finally a solution, i move back home. ....House isn't built for another year and a half........... so i said fork that and i went and found a job and found myself a place. 2 years later (like clock work) with all the drama there and feeling like my job would use every ounce of my energy that i am even capable of. i ended up leaving. boss through me under the bus when disciplining another person and that was the last straw. plus the pay issues i found. so i end up moving back in with the parents. again. before that happened i was left with 5000 from my grandma when she passed and my mom suggested i get an rv and then renovate it. so by the time i talked myself into it and made a plan. i started looking for one and planning my build. dad comes home and before he hears my plan says that “i need a job and he doesnt want it on the property”. like the thing that has just been crushing me, mentally, physically, emotionally, he has made mandatory. like i get that it would take money. but he didnt even hear my plan yet before he put his own requirements before my plan or what was offered. And we have a large property, mom okayed it and then dad came home and said no you have to jump through my hoop first. In our arguments he literally said why would he let me do that, that i dont know what hard work looks like and i didnt earn it to put it on his land. i was like, dont you want me to grow from here? not have to start from the very beginning and struggle but because he doesnt like the idea it was never up for discussion. While there are projects galore around the house, that arent finished, equipment sits outside to rust and then they wonder why it doesnt work. my idea was actually to rent the neighbors land as i built it but why the fork would i tell him that after he's shut me down without even hearing me. so I grit my teeth and start working on two business's a woodworking business and a custom 3d printed speaker pod for my jeep which other people are interested in and would've probably bought. and all the while i am used as their labor source. doesnt matter that my energy is low because of the AuDHD or the cronic pain or the labrum tear in my hip i JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT.  and instead of respecting me or my time or even considering what i was doing, i get these texts. ""Lawn needs mowed tomorrow front and back"".... and 30 minutes before that my mother asked me to move their realestate office equipment. I limped for 4 days afterwards. no thank you, no pay, no understanding on the toll it takes for me to get up at 8 am, (they originally told me it was all separate days), so i planned, but they wanted to go watch the baseball game so they changed it at 8am instead.  i had 3 hours of sleep that night, woken up to 3 phone calls 40 mins before my alarm to be there. they ""Just wanted to make sure i was up""............like what............ today i didnt sleep. i have been awake for 24 hours. and dad comes upstairs and starts asking all these question about why I didn’t sleep and tells me i should just stop thinking about those things and to just go to sleep earlier. and the second i bring up the Autism part he says he doesnt believe me. the doctor literally said it. and he doesnt believe me. he did a little research on ADHD but today he goes, "" I am not going to learn any more about autism/ADHD""......... oh so you dont want to know me then or why im upset. so i just continue to repeat that i would please apprectiate it if they would consider me as a human with plans when they need something. i would happily do it. if it fits in my schedule so i dont burn out. and every time i talk about my energy, both my parents chuckle. so im shaking at this point. so much so that i kick the coffee table out of the way. After he’s chirpped in my ear while I was playing videogames for a solid 10 minutes. Just me repeating my boundary, him ignoring it and the he goes, wait how did you get to set expectations and boundaries. I said we both should. And then he continued to tell me how he expects things done not listening to the word and feelings I am literally saying. After I kick the table, he jumps in my face telling me to nock it off and shit, angry eyes, like he would swing and he reached for me so i grabbed him and through him on the couch, twice.  then he proceeded to kick me out. like i get putting hands on him was not good. but when you are shaking with disappear, anguish, literally not being heard and gaslight that they respect me and treat me as a human, when they dont consider my plans or energy. all they do, is house me and pay my forking bills.(which are a ridicules amount for someone whose been in disfunction for 8 years now). im gluten and lactose intollerant too, recent, like the last 5 years. When anyone in the house cooks for the fam, I probably can eat protein most nights but everything else is something i cant have. Or a potato dish. While they have extravengant meals and dishes. And then when im upset and dont say anything, they go “What’s up? You’ve been quiet” no forking shit Sherlock. And then they get upset that im upset and that im complaining. So my two business's gone now. my wedding venue dream.... 20 plus years now probably. like i dont know how else to communicate. they think im disrespectful cause i dont do the things the ""ask"" (Tell) me to do. they literally say, we never ask you to do things...... i lock eyes and say you are right, you just expect it to be done when you want it to be. always telling me when and what i am doing with absolute zero care about how it will effect me or my routine or energy or body. so now im using free wifi. freakin trying to figure out where i am gunna go. i grabbed as many as my electronics as i could, to hopefully sell in an attempt to have food money. And left wondering how this crap, and why im upset isn’t obvious to anyone else. He will never sacrifice a work thing to do anything, everything needs to be scheduled in advance and then when I say EXACTLY!! They laugh and say it’s not the same thing……… so im gunna find a campsite tonight, hopefully get some food, haven’t eaten yet and it’s 6pm already. And hopefully sell enough of my crap that I can survive a little longer. No phone, no money. Just pure panic and overwhelmed. ",2,1754878137.0,AutisticWithADHD,0,1.0,False
1mn0v8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mn0v8i/constant_extreme_fatigue/,Constant Extreme Fatigue,"Age: 30
Sex: Female
Diagnosed with: High Blood Pressure, Iron Deficiency, Asthma, ADHD, Treatment Resistant Depression, Severe Generalized Anxiety Disorder
Medications I'm taking: 40mg Fluoxetine, 1mg Clonazepam BID, ferrous sulfate 325mg, Lisinopril 20mg, 15mg Adderall BID

The problem: I'm always tired. Always. I  can take my Adderall and fall asleep 15 minutes later. I can drink an entire monster or 16oz of coffee and be ready for a quick nap. I can stay awake when I need to, I don't find myself falling asleep while I'm actively working, but that's about the only time lately that I'm not sleeping. To give an example:

On Friday 8/8 the last recorded screentime on my phone was at 5:50pm until my cats woke me up on Saturday 8/9 at around 6:30am. I got up to feed them (approximately 5 minutes), went back to bed and ended up sleeping until about 5:20pm that same day when they woke me up for their dinner. 

During work days, I find myself napping during my lunch break and falling asleep very shortly after work either for a short nap or for the whole night. I'm so sick of being so exhausted.

I don't feel like my sleep quality is poor. I don't snore, I sleep deeply enough to remember my dreams when I wake up. I don't really move in my sleep at all, usually I will wake up in the exact same position I fell asleep in.

The ride to Earth had been much smoother than their trip to the station, and Brenton was glad for the few days they were in quarantine, if only because it gave him time to get acclimated to full gravity again. That was less comfortable than he had been expecting, but the mild painkillers he was given helped, along with the muscle relaxers. By the end of the weekend, he walked through the final decontamination shower he would need to take and then stepped back into the real world. He was given his personal belongings and ushered into a cab.

When the man stepped through the door into the small apartment, he almost didn't recognize it as his home. The air smelled and felt wrong, and the furniture seemed out of place. He was no more comfortable when he flounced down onto the couch. He didn't have to report to the training center until the next week. He was looking forward to the chance to visit his mother and his cousin, but a part of him longed to be out there, off of the planet again.

He felt restless, and couldn't focus on the stupid shows or even old movies that he enjoyed when he tried to watch something. He got the feeling that he should be doing something every minute he sat on the the couch, and he filled that void with drinking cup after cup of coffee. That both made him have to urinate and jittery which did not improve his restlessness. He grabbed the keys to his car and walked outside, driving to a nearby park after taking a moment to get adjusted behind the wheel of the vehicle.

Driving was strange, directly controlling the vehicle instead of applying thrust and praying as he had in the exosuit. He pulled over to the curb and stepped out of the car, wandering around the park for a while, though it wasn't a very big area. He was still restless, the sunlight and wind on his skin feeling wrong. He had spent nearly three months contained in the space station or within the heavy suit. He walked a few blocks away from the park and then turned up a side street before turning back toward the park.

His cellphone rang, causing his steps to falter with surprise as he stopped and reached into his pocket, pulling the device free. He didn't recognize the number, but answered it anyway.

“Hello?” he asked, confusion plain in his voice.

“Hey, how are you doing?” a familiar, feminine voice danced into his ear.

“How did you get my number?” he asked, though he wasn't angry, simply surprised.

“From the employee directory.” she answered honestly.

“What's up?” he asked, moving on rather easily.

“I was wondering if you want to meet up for dinner. I am not used to eating alone.” she said with a soft laugh.

They quickly agreed to meet at a rather well known bar and grill in the city, and when they hung up, the man headed back to his car, driving back to the small apartment. He was glad that Myranda lived in the same state, because in truth his mind had been on her a lot, the woman's face occupying his dreams the night before. He wandered around his place, the television on for background noise as he glanced at the clock in ten minute intervals. As the time approached, he shaved and took a thorough shower, dressing in a nearly brand-new button-up shirt and a pair of khaki pants.

He made his way to the establishment, pulling around the building to the back lot, and as he passed a small motorbike, he saw a familiar, feminine figure straddling the seat. She was dressed pretty much as she had been on the space station in her off time, tight denim and a form-fitting t-shirt emblazoned with a band logo. There were some differences however, her eyes ringed in crimson and black, lips a deep, vibrant red.

He parked and got out of the car, the woman meeting him outside of his door with a warm hug. The faint smell of rose oil drifted into his nostrils.

“You look nice.” she said after stepping back and looking Brent over from head to toe.

“Not as good as you look.” he returned fire, smiling and pressing the button that would activate the alarm on his vehicle.

“Oh please.” she sighed, rolling her eyes and falling into step beside him as they walked toward the building.

They waited until the host finally turned his attention to them before standing from the cushioned bench and followed him through the place to a quiet booth in the back, lit overhead from antique fixture with stained glass panels. She ordered both of them a beer to start with over appetizers, and then stood, excusing herself to the restroom. Before she returned, a familiar melody filled the air. One of the songs that they had danced to the night before they had returned to Earth. He smiled as she settled into the seat across from him.

“Very clever.” he teased.

The beer arrived as she replied, “I thought so.”

He laughed and lifted the bottle to his lips. The food arrived next, and as they ate, they talked a little more, the conversation light and relaxed as they moved on through the main course and then migrated to the bar to continue drinking. After another hour and a half passed, the woman called a cab and when it arrived, Brent gave the driver his address. Myranda didn't correct him, and when they arrived, she slipped out into the street behind him, and took his hand. He gave a little squeeze as he led the way into his home.

The door was barely closed before he was pressed against it and her lips covered his.

“I missed you.” she whispered as she pulled back, and though she was a little drunk, her words seemed genuine.

“I missed you too.” he confirmed.

They made love again and this time, they both sat up in the bed when they finished. Myranda began reaching for her clothing, hurrying to the bathroom to get dressed.

“You don't have to leave tonight.” he said softly, and she settled on the bed, and tilted her head, meeting his eyes.

“The question is, do you want me to stay?” she prodded.

“Obviously.” he retorted, rolling his eyes, reaching out to draw the woman against his chest, hugging her gently.

They fell asleep in one another's arms for the third time, and when Myranda woke,the young man was already in the middle of making breakfast for both of them. Miraculously, they both had seemingly avoided a hang-over. She made her way out to the small table.

“Good morning.” Brent said as he dished a fried egg and some hand-grated hashbrowns onto a plate, placing that in front of her.

“Good morning.” she mumbled quietly in return, as the male poured her a cup of coffee just the way she liked it and placed that on the table as well.

He fried another egg and dished that up for himself, joining the woman, who was already eating, at the table.

“So, what are your plans for the rest of our time down here?” he asked, raising a glass of juice to his lips, having foregone caffeine for once.

“Not really. I already took care of everything I needed to do. My family are scattered all over the place and schedules didn't allow for a visit or anything, so I am just killing time, I guess.” she said between bites of the food.

“Well, I am supposed to go see my mom later today. You could tag along if you want to.” he offered.

She hesitated for a moment, her head tilting. Did he just invite her to meet his parent? She took another bite, then cleaned her plate.

“If you're sure, I could use some company.” she finally replied as she stood, walking her dishes to the sink.

He followed and then rinsed those before placing the plates and silverware into the dishwasher, starting that up.

“We should probably go get your bike somewhere safe.” he said, claiming his phone from the counter where he'd left it to charge.

She nodded and he called another cab. They held hands in the back seat on the way to the bar, and she followed him back to the house, pulling the bike into the parking spot next to his car,marked 'visitor' rather than with an apartment number. They got back into his car after both of them used the toilet and Brent drove them across town to the small, rather quaint home where he'd been raised. They walked to the front door hand-in-hand once more and the man didn't even knock, simply twisting the knob and stepping inside, practically dragging her along.

“Hello? I'm home.” he called, stepping into the narrow hallway. The smell of freshly baked apple pie floated on the air inside, and Myranda smiled as she glanced around.

There were photos of the man holding her hand on the walls, some of them containing a man and woman who had to be his mother and a slightly older boy. As they moved through the house the older boy became scarcer in the photos.

“I'm in the kitchen” his mother, called, her voice soft and light as it drifted into the living room about the time they stepped into it.

She was a moderately plump woman with rosy cheeks below deep-set, sparkling blue eyes, those, in turn beneath a head of curly silver hair. Her wide shoulders and hips alluded to her shape before the weight had become harder to melt away. She was just placing a glass pan into the oven when Brent and Myranda crossed the threshold. She smiled when she saw the young woman.

“You didn't tell me you were bringing a guest.” Meredith said, though her tone was far from angry.

“It was kind of a spontaneous decision.” Brent said lamely, his own cheeks turning a little red.

As Myranda let her eyes move between them, she definitely saw the resemblance there. She wondered where his father was, but considering that he didn't seem to appear in any of the photographs, she kept the question to herself.

“It's no trouble of course. I have tea or lemonade if you'd like something to drink.” his mother offered sweetly.

“Lemonade would be lovely.” Myranda said.

“Go make yourselves comfortable, and I'll bring it in.” the older woman replied.

The younger pair turned and walked into the living room again, settling onto the small sofa. Meredith appeared wielding a small serving tray, placing that atop the small coffee table, a pitcher of the offered beverage rattling quietly along with the other, empty glassware. Brent poured each of them a glass, handing one to the young woman next to him. The older woman dropped into the recliner with a smile.

“So, where did you meet?” she asked after a few moments of long but comfortable silence.

“We met at work.” Myranda answered after swallowing the lemonade in her mouth.

“Oh, wow. What is it like up there?” Meredith asked, clearly directing the question toward Myranda, rather than her own child.

“It's one of the coolest things I have ever experienced, so much more freeing than being down here.” the red-head replied.

“That's an interesting way of seeing things.” the older woman mused.

“So, I meant to ask you the other day, did you hear about the new organ replacement procedure?” Brent asked, his question aimed at his mother, as were his eyes. He wanted to change the subject before his mother could start asking how dangerous it was.

“I did.” she answered shortly, though her behavior changed, becoming a bit more guarded as her gaze moved to her offspring.

“What did you think about maybe checking into it?” he pressed, clearly not about to be deterred.

“I already have a consultation, but you don't need to worry about that.” she scolded, and the red-head got the feeling this was not their first conversation about the subject.

The oven timer began to beep, which broke the slight tension that had began to form in the air. Myranda stood and followed her.

“Let me help.” she offered, and the homeowner didn't refuse as her guest followed her into the other room.

The rest of the evening passed without any further incident, and they shared a nice meal together before Brent and Myranda walked back out to his car together. The ride back passed in amicable silence, and when they reached his apartment, she made no move to get onto her bike, following him inside instead. The conversation turned to the training that was rapidly approaching, both of them looking forward to learning their new roles. Eventually, Myranda did excuse herself, the two parting ways with a hug and a kiss.

Once he was alone, the restless feelings didn't take long to return. He forced himself to stay put until after the sun went down before venturing out on foot, just walking a few blocks away before turning back toward his home. By the time he laid down to sleep, he found himself longing for his room on the space station. In his dreams, he was floating in the vacuum, the faint lights from the station like beacons in the distance. The experience was partly a memory, and partly a fantasy, his body drifting beyond the asteroid belt in his mind.

The alarm that woke him was soft but was the most unwelcome sound he had ever heard. His eyes opened and he sat up, running his palms over his face. He took a showered and got dressed, then used the morning to wash his laundry and catch up on other chores. He also made arrangements for his electricity, cable, and internet services to be cut off. He and Myranda spent quite a bit of time together over the next week, and he even helped pay for a storage unit for the woman's motorcycle. They were making plans to move in together by the time that they rode to the airport together.

The flight wasn't a long one, and they both had a bit of time to explore the Training Center after they arrived. Brenton was enamored with the control center as well as the launch bay where their craft sat. The vessel looked like nothing he had ever seen before. Sleek, formidable and bigger than the Starliner they had returned to Earth on. He felt the electricity of excitement coursing through his body again. He ate with the other members of the team but turned in earlier than the others.

 I think dyspraxia might have been a way to protect neurodivergent thinkers from becoming hunters or going to war. 
 A child who is not stealthy, who crashes around the forest and can't aim bow and arrow or a spear very well, would be given different tasks to do. This would keep them alive long enough to develop innovative thinking, deep dive into ideas and research, notice changes to the environment, be creative.

 I believe that when dyspraxia was noticed some tribes would've seen this as a sign of someone special and they would have been trained as leaders, shamans, adventurers, people who lead the tribe forward. 
 Certainly my son's struggles with handwriting at 7 is how we discovered my entire family is neurodivergent. 
 I have 2 AuDHD sons. One is clearly dyspraxic, the other is a super coordinated sports machine. So not all neurodivergent people are dyspraxic but I think my theory still works, you'd need some neurodivergent thinking in war and in hunting. 

 I think in modern society every person is expected to do everything for themselves and this is why we struggle. I think in a tribe each person has their role, based on their strengths and I think that dypraxics would've been taken care of -for food, for keeping their homes clean etc, so that they could do what they are best at. 
I think that is neurodivergent people and dyspraxics were given more help in day to day life then we would be enabled to do some pretty amazing things!

## Key Features analysis

The effectiveness of a carafe with cup set hinges on several critical features that determine both its usability and longevity.

**Material Quality:** A top-tier carafe and cup set utilizes high-quality materials such as borosilicate glass,which is known for its durability and resistance to thermal shock. Premium porcelain or ceramic options are also popular for their elegant appearance and heat retention properties.

The ideal material should be non-toxic, easy to clean, and capable of maintaining the temperature of the beverage without imparting any unwanted flavors. Borosilicate glass typically excels in these areas, while certain ceramic or porcelain types may require specialized care to prevent staining or cracking. The overall construction should also be sturdy, ensuring that the carafe and cup can withstand regular use without easily breaking or chipping.

**Capacity and Dimensions:** The capacity of the carafe is a crucial consideration, as it dictates how much beverage can be stored at once. Most carafes range from 20 to 40 ounces (600 to 1200 ml). The dimensions of both the carafe and cup should be proportional,ensuring a balanced and aesthetically pleasing design.

A carafe that is too large might potentially be cumbersome to handle, while one that is too small may require frequent refills. The cup should be sized appropriately to complement the carafe,typically holding between 6 to 10 ounces (180 to 300 ml). The overall dimensions should also be compact enough to fit comfortably on a bedside table or desk without taking up excessive space.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design of the carafe and cup set considerably impacts its appeal and suitability for different environments. Minimalist designs with clean lines and a neutral color palette tend to be versatile and blend well with various décor styles.More ornate designs may feature intricate patterns, textured surfaces, or decorative accents, making them a statement piece. Ergonomics should also be considered, ensuring that the carafe is easy to grip and pour without spilling. The cup should have a pleasant handle or a shape that allows for a secure grip.

**Insulation Properties:** Some carafes incorporate insulation features to help maintain the temperature of the beverage for an extended period. Double-walled glass or stainless steel constructions offer excellent insulation, keeping cold drinks chilled and hot drinks warm for several hours. Vacuum insulation provides the highest level of temperature retention.

While not all carafes are insulated, those that are offer a important advantage for users who prefer to keep their beverages at a consistent temperature. This is particularly useful for overnight storage or for enjoying beverages throughout the day without the need for reheating or chilling.The insulation properties should be effective without adding excessive bulk or weight to the carafe.

**Ease of Cleaning:** The carafe and cup should be easy to clean, either by hand or in a dishwasher. Wide-mouth carafes are generally easier to clean than those with narrow necks, as they allow for better access to the interior.Dishwasher-safe materials are also a plus,as they simplify the cleaning process. However,certain delicate materials may require hand washing to prevent damage. The design should also minimize the accumulation of residue or stains, ensuring that the carafe and cup remain hygienic and visually appealing over time. Removable components, such as lids or filters, should also be easy to disassemble and clean.

## Core Benefits

The appeal of a carafe with cup set extends beyond its aesthetic qualities, offering several practical benefits that enhance the user experience.

**Convenient Hydration:** A carafe with a cup provides immediate access to refreshing beverages, eliminating the need to fetch drinks from the kitchen. This is particularly beneficial during the night or while working at a desk.Having a ready supply of water,juice,or tea encourages frequent hydration,which is essential for maintaining overall health and well-being. This convenience translates into increased productivity and a more comfortable habitat.

**Elegant Presentation:** The carafe and cup set elevates the presentation of beverages, transforming a simple drink into a more sophisticated experience. Whether it's placed on a bedside table, a desk, or a dining table, the set adds a touch of elegance to the surroundings. This is particularly appealing for guests, as it demonstrates attention to detail and a commitment to providing a comfortable and welcoming experience. The aesthetic appeal of the set can also enhance the enjoyment of the beverage itself.

**Controlled Portions:** The cup that accompanies the carafe provides a designated serving size, allowing users to control their beverage intake. This can be particularly useful for individuals who are mindful of their calorie consumption or who prefer to sip their drinks slowly. The controlled portion size also helps to prevent overconsumption and waste. This is especially beneficial for beverages that are high in sugar or caffeine.

**Reduced Spills and Mess:** The carafe's design minimizes the risk of spills and messes compared to pouring directly from a large bottle or pitcher. The narrow spout and ergonomic handle provide better control over the pouring process,reducing the likelihood of drips and splashes. This is particularly crucial for bedside use, where spills can damage furniture or bedding. The cup also provides a stable and convenient receptacle for the beverage, further minimizing the risk of accidents.

## FAQs Section

**What is the best material for a carafe and cup set?**
Borosilicate glass is a popular choice due to its durability, thermal shock resistance, and non-reactive properties. It doesn't impart any flavors to the beverage and is easy to clean. Porcelain and ceramic are also good options, offering elegant aesthetics and decent heat retention. However, it's crucial to ensure that the porcelain or ceramic is free of lead and other harmful substances.**How do I clean a carafe with a narrow neck?**
For hard-to-reach areas, use a bottle brush or a combination of baking soda and vinegar. Fill the carafe with warm water,add a tablespoon of baking soda,and then slowly pour in a cup of vinegar. Let the mixture fizz for a few minutes before rinsing thoroughly. Alternatively, you can use denture cleaning tablets dissolved in warm water to remove stains and residue.

**Are insulated carafes worth the investment?**
Insulated carafes are definitely worth the investment if you frequently enjoy hot or cold beverages and wont to maintain their temperature for an extended period. They are particularly useful for keeping water chilled overnight or for keeping coffee warm throughout the morning. The double-walled construction prevents condensation on the exterior, making them ideal for use in humid environments.

1mn0mkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepIndianConfessions/comments/1mn0mkw/reposting_a_reddit_meet/,Reposting : A Reddit Meet,"It was one of those evenings Chennai wears so well, the sky purple, the rain falling in steady sheets that made the roads shimmer under the streetlights. I was leaving from work when her message came.

*""Are you free now? Want to meet?""*

We have been chatting for a couple of days. She had read one of my stories and messaged me saying it made her feel seen. That was enough to keep our conversations going. We hadn’t gone deep into what she did for a living. She was… interesting.

When she sent her address, I didn’t think much about it. I grabbed my keys, stepped into the rain, and made my way.

By the time I reached her lane, the power had gone out. I knocked on her door.

The door opened and for a second, I just stared.

It was her. The woman whose clips I had seeing on Instagram on daily. The one I had a quiet little crush on, without ever expecting to meet in real life. I knew her smile, her voice, even the way her eyes lingered before she spoke. But I never thought I would be standing in her doorway.

She was dressed simply in a loose T-shirt, hair damp from a shower but there was something different about seeing her like this, without lights, makeup, and camera angles.

“Come in,” she said, stepping aside.

Inside, the air smelled faintly of sandalwood incense and wet earth. The living room was dim, lit by a couple of candles on the coffee table. She moved towards the kitchen without much small talk.

*""Filter coffee?""* she asked over her shoulder, a small smile playing at her lips.

I grinned. “You remember.” We’d joked about it during our chats, about how a good filter coffee can fix almost anything.

I let my eyes wander. That’s when I noticed the framed photos on a side shelf , behind-the-scenes shots, clapperboards, her in different costumes.

“You act?” I asked.

She glanced at me, almost embarrassed. “Small roles. Short films, web series… nothing big yet.”

There was a flicker in her expression

“You’re not okay,” I said softly.

Her hands stilled. “The audition didn’t go well today. It was for a role I really wanted. Could’ve been different, you know?”

I listened, letting her pour it out about the way they moved on to the next girl like she was invisible. By the time she placed the coffee in front of me, her voice was already starting to crack.

She sat beside me. For a moment, we just sipped in silence. Then, almost without thinking, she leaned in ,her head finding my shoulder like it had always belonged there.

No flirtation. No games. Just the quiet of rain on the windows, the warmth of coffee cooling between us, and the weight of her trusting me to hold the space for her to crumble a little.

Her head was still on my shoulder when I felt the slow, steady rhythm of her breathing. The rain outside had softened to a faint hiss, and the power was still out, so the room stayed wrapped in that dim candlelight.

I didn’t move. Sometimes the best thing you can give someone is stillness.

She stirred slightly, lifting her head, her eyes catching mine for a moment. There was that faint, almost shy smile the kind people wear when they’ve been caught feeling too much (Vekkam).

“You’re warm,” she said quietly, almost as if surprised.

I chuckled. “coffee does that.”

That made her smile more fully, and I saw some of the heaviness in her eyes ease. She tucked her legs up on the sofa, sitting sideways now, her knee brushing against my thigh. It wasn’t deliberate.

We talked a little after that , just small stories. I teased her about how I have seen her clips before and had a crush without even knowing I would ever meet her. She rolled her eyes, but I saw the way her lips curved at the corners.

“You should’ve told me,” she said. ""Edeee?"" i replied , mimicking Kovai Sarala ...

“And risk sounding like a fanboy on the first meeting? No chance""

She laughed

At some point, she leaned forward to place her empty cup on the table, and when she sat back, she didn’t go to her side of the sofa. She stayed close. Close enough that I could smell the faint scent of her hair ,coconut oil and rain.

Her hand rested between us, fingers brushing my arm lightly. Not asking, not pulling just there.

I turned my palm upward, and she let her fingers slide into mine.

No words. Just that tiny, deliberate choice.

She shifted slightly, her shoulder against my chest now. I felt the warmth of her, the way her breathing slowed as if this connection was what she’d been craving more than anything.

The rain outside began to pick up again, drumming against the windows. In that cocoon of candlelight and soft sound, I tilted my head just enough to catch her gaze.

No need for words or moves. Just being there.

When she glanced at the clock, she sighed, “It’s late. You should stay over.”

I smiled and nodded. We made some dinner idli, sambar, and some chutney. Wanted to be a candlelight dinner ...but EB guys switched the power back on...

After dinner, I was very tired . Without thinking, I dropped down on the sofa still in myuniform, shoes and all.

She laughed softly. “You look like you’re about to pass out.”

“I’m a simple man,” I mumbled, eyes closing.

She shook her head with a smile and disappeared down the hall. When she came back, she was in comfy pajamas, settling onto her bed with a contented sigh.

I woke up hours later, stiff and disoriented. She was already up, brewing fresh filter coffee like nothing had happened.

“Hey,” she said, grinning. “You slept like a log . I’m putting out a ‘no shoes indoors’ rule.”

I laughed, rubbing my eyes. “Well, at least I didn’t snore.”

She winked. “That’s what I’m worried about.”

And with that, the night’s quiet magic gave way to a new, easy friendship full of imperfect moments, laughter, and the comfort of simply being there for each other when it mattered most.

Everything I’ve read about paraxanthine seems to indicate it ought to have performed better than that. Lots of people say it’s like caffeine but without the crash. And I feel like even a small cup of coffee would have kept me awake better than that.

First time brewing and my timing isn’t great.

Last Sunday night I started my first batch with a SOBY off Amazon and the starter that was in the bag with it. Made the sweet tea concentrate, added cold water, let it come down to temp, added the SCOBY and starter tea and covered with a coffee filter. We’re at exactly 1 week now and I leave for vacation Tuesday night through Saturday. What is the move? Leave it and do the second fermentation when I get back?

Also, we’re at 1 week and the SCOBY is still on the bottom? Based on what I’ve read it’s not typical but not necessarily an indicator the batch failed.

SCOBY I used in case it’s relevant

I just spent the past week diving into new apps that literally pay you for trying out hot, unreleased features, and I have never felt more like a confused scientist in a high-tech maze.

Like, I always thought getting paid for testing apps was either a gimmick or SUPER hush-hush. But 2025 said HOLD MY COFFEE—because, apparently, if you know where to look, you can turn your feedback into real money?!? My brain still can’t wrap around this. 🤯

I was honestly SURE most of these were scams, but…brace yourselves because these 7 apps are LEGIT:

---

### 1. Testerly

- Show up, click “try beta,” and suddenly you're rating epic new feature drops every week.
- Got paid via PayPal after three days—direct and super flawless.
- Not even joking, still questioning reality.

---

### 2. BetaBank

- You choose apps that actually sound fun.
- Payment in real cash and sometimes you get bonus points if you spot glitches.
- I nearly FREAKED when I realized they deposit via multiple platforms. Yeah, even crypto.

---

### 3. **[GoodNovel Test App](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

- Wait, am I dreaming or did I actually get paid just to tap around in their newest reading features?
- Users submit feedback ONCE and get paid TWICE. I was like…how?? **[GoodNovel Test App](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**, are you secretly Santa Claus??

---

### 4. AppOvation

- Challenges you to break their apps—in a good way!
- The more creative your feedback = the higher your reward.
- I confused myself a few times but still got paid, which is even weirder and cooler.

---

### 5. **[GoodNovel Test App](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (yes, AGAIN)

- This one deserves a double shout because their payment speed SHOCKED me.
- Most consistent payouts and simple requirements ever. I showed my roommate, who didn’t believe people like us were being *invited* to test features.
- Share a quirky review, grab your reward. Still can’t figure out if it’s magic or just crazy 2025 technology.

---

### 6. ProtoTry

- You get points for EVERYTHING—even silly button clicks.
- Weekly payouts are actually honored! Unreal.
- I accidentally triggered a new notification feature and got a THANK-YOU bonus?!? Still feel like this is a simulation, tbh.

---

### 7. **[GoodNovel Test App](https://goodnovel.org/testapp) (Seriously, Bookmark It!)**

- If you want a newcomer-friendly app, **[GoodNovel Test App](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** is the safest—it felt exactly like playing with new story modes for coins, only it’s CASH.
- It keeps recommending me new features to test, and each time the process gets stranger and the rewards BIGGER.

---

Is it just me, or are we actually living in a timeline where getting paid for playing with new features is *normal*…? This list shocked me as much as it hyped me up, especially with those sneaky awesome bonuses some of these apps toss in.

Have you all tested any of these, or am I the only one still in awe? Drop your own picks and tell me: is **[GoodNovel Test App](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** a glitch in the matrix or a legit cash cow for our generation?!",0,1754876550.0,AIpoweredInfluencer,0,0.5,False

1mn09rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mn09rb/i_found_a_train_that_leaves_at_25_am/,I found a train that leaves at 25 AM,"I'm starting to think that God himself wishes my downfall. I've had the worst day of my life and I am not exaggerating. The first sign that i should have just called in sick is when I spilled my coffee all over my new white shirt and only clean pair of pants. The next is that is sent my ""I love you baby"" text to my boss instead of my girlfriend. Perhaps, shredding the pile of documents I needed to sign by the end of the day instead of the pile of paper I was supposed to dispose of was just the cherry on the sunday. So here I am 2 minutes after midnight and I've missed the last train home.

""Great, this is just what I needed. I am already running on two hours of mediocre sleep and now I am stuck in this city, unable to go home. I guess I'll just go sleep next to the homeless man that hogs the bench until the next train comes"" I said out loud, knowing nobody was listening to me (aside from that homeless guy I mentioned earlier). I walked closer to the wall and sat down. Putting my vest between my shoulder and head to create a ""pillow"" as well as using my coat like a blanket, I drifted of to sleep. Atleast, that was until I heard a grating voice beside me.

-Hey man, are you new in town? It's the first time I see you camping in the station, asked the stranger. Today is my lucky day because another house less weirdo is going to steal my only opportunity of visiting dreamland this evening.

-Leave me alone, I grunted still closing my eyes, im not camping here I just missed my train.

-Than, why didn't you rent a hotel room?

-Because I don't have that kind of money right now, I said, getting more and more annoyed with our conversation.

-You could've gone back to your place in a taxi or an uber, it's less expensive than an hotel room.

-Like I said, I don't have money right now. So you can leave. I'm not givin you anything.

-You're in a suit, so I assume you have a pretty good job. You must have made really bad financial decisions to end up broke like that.

-Okay, can you shut the fuck up-- As the sentence exited my mouth, I opened my eyes and realized I was not talking to homeless man. I was talking to a very colorful Clown with a flowery bowl hat.

-Why...why are you dressed like a Clown? I questionned, confused and concerned. -Why not, exclamed the smilling flower on his hat? But you did not answer my question about your financial situation. What happened?

-Well uhm... I can't... I can't believe I'm going to talk to you about this but hell, here I go, I declared exasperated by my own decisions. I have a really bad drinking problem, and my wife is divorcing me because of it. And between the legal fees and the bills I rack up every night at Tony's bar, it's beginning to weight on me. I am becoming a pauper. And now I am stuck here until five AM with a Clown.

-You know there's a train at 25 O'clock, right?

-What are you talking about? 25 O'clock? That doesn't exist.

-Yes it exists! responded the flower, offended I didn't believe it. You are just to drunk to remember the 25th hour. Look man, the train is coming right now. A train suddenly arrived at the station, just as the flower spoke it's words.

-Wow, this is perfect! I didn't know that train existed! Thank you so much, you're a life saver mister flower! I sprinted towards the train and I jumped aboard. But, I suddenly felt myself falling and my head hit violently the rails. I felt the ground rumble and a real train approaching. As my world started fading, I heard my hallucination talk to me one last time.

-Those last few vodka shots were really unnecessary

1mn08m7,https://www.reddit.com/r/scaryshortstories/comments/1mn08m7/weird_sticky_notes_keep_showing_up_in_my_apartment/,Weird sticky notes keep showing up in my apartment.,"I live in a small studio apartment on the second floor of an older building. It’s not in a bad neighborhood, but it’s old enough that the hallways creak and the walls seem thinner than they should be. I would've never expected anything like this to ever happen to me.

It’s just me here. No pets, no roommates, no partner. I've lived here alone for over 4 months, and nothing like this has happened to anyone in my area. I'd like to say I keep things pretty routine—before bed, I check that the door is locked and the single window above my little desk is latched shut. I’ve been doing it every night since I got here, almost without thinking about it.

Two nights ago, I woke up a little after 7 AM and went to the kitchen to make coffee. That’s when I saw it—a bright yellow sticky note on the fridge, right at eye level. The handwriting was neat, almost careful, and it said:

“Lock your window.”



I stared at it for a while, trying to remember if I’d left myself some weird reminder in the middle of the night. I don’t drink, I don’t take sleeping meds, and I don’t leave random notes for myself. Still, I convinced myself I must’ve just forgotten to lock the window before bed, and maybe I wrote the note earlier and forgot. There couldn't possibly be any other explanation.

That night, I made sure the window was locked—slid the latch over, pushed on the frame twice just to be sure. I pulled the curtain closed tight. I even double checked to make sure I actually locked it once before I went to bed.

Despite everything, the next morning there was ANOTHER sticky note on the fridge:

“Better.”



That one made my stomach twist. Nobody else has a key. I asked around, asked the landlord, even tried to get in contact with the people who lived here before I moved in to ask if anything unusual happened to them, but they didn't even see my message. The front door lock is brand new—something I had replaced the same day I moved in. The building’s secure. The front door downstairs has a code lock, and you need a key to get into individual units.

I called the landlord. He sounded annoyed, said he hasn’t been in my apartment, and reminded me that it’s against policy to enter without notice unless there’s an emergency. He lives two floors down in the basement, and he's almost always there—he’s not the type to sneak around.

By then, I’d gone from unsettled to outright paranoid. I went out and bought a cheap WiFi camera that connects to my phone. I set it up in the kitchen, facing the fridge. I kept the lights dim so the night vision would kick in.

That night, I kept one eye on the feed while I watched TV. Every time I glanced at it, the fridge was there, nothing moving.

Around 3:12 AM, the feed glitched—static for maybe two seconds. When it came back, everything looked exactly the same. I told myself it was just cheap equipment.

This morning, there was another note:

""Stop.”


I was about to call the police when I'd noticed something I'd somehow missed before: the handwriting.

It's MINE. It's MY handwriting.

And now, there's a fourth sticky note on the desk next to me. I didn't put it there. I would've seen someone walk in. 

""See you tonight.""",2,1754876329.0,scaryshortstories,1,0.67,False

I know Reddit is global so I’m asking this mostly from a US (unfortunately) centric view. With the de minimis exemption ending and a lot of great roasters based outside the US, are other Americans changing their purchasing habits? I just started a sub with Rogue Wave and was interested in also trying Pirates of Coffee, but am not sure about how to deal with the extra costs. A 15% duty charge I could probably eat, but it’s the carrier fees that I’m concerned about - I see some people getting hit with $50 charges for UPS to clear their customs. I’m big bummed, had been a subscriber to B&W for many years and was looking to change it up but may end up going back there.

Every time I see “most underrated cities” lists, Cincy’s nowhere to be found, and I don’t get it. People act like it’s just a Chili dog stop on I-75, but if you’ve actually lived there, it’s got way more going for it than folks realize. The city’s walkable in ways that most American cities dream about—OTR, Clifton, Mount Adams, Walnut Hills—you can actually get from coffee to a bar to a park without having to summon a rideshare every 15 minutes. The parks are criminally underrated: Eden Park, Ault Park, Smale Riverfront Park… these aren’t just scraps of grass between highways, they’re real places people actually hang out. And the social scene? Way better than outsiders think. There’s an energy in the bar and brewery scene that’s not trying too hard like LA, not dead by 9 PM like Dallas, and not buried in snow like Minneapolis. Yeah, sure, the winters are gray and the Bengals will find a way to crush your spirit eventually, but the city’s got character, culture, and community that’s hard to fake. It’s not some influencer playground, which is probably why it’s still affordable—but that’s exactly why it’s worth paying attention to.",31,1754876247.0,SameGrassButGreener,52,0.83,False

There are glass alternatives, which are heavy and reviews suggest they’re at risk of suddenly shattering. 

I considered paper plates, but those can be flammable and may have wax or plastic coatings.

Kitchen towels don’t work for covering a plate of food. Some people use coffee filters but those seem too small for a plate.

Covering one plate with another plate seems like an accident waiting to happen.

I was hoping to avoid silicone as well, but it’s looking like that might be the only alternative. Anyone has any other ideas?

Prior to reading the police report, I was 100% this is his fault and he should be punished. Now, after reading it, my views have changed - a bit.

I read that Brady got up at 7am (no mention of when Emilie got up), Brady made breakfast for Trigg, Brady drove Trigg to school, Brady stopped to pick up coffee for Emilie and himself on his way home from Trigg's school drop off while Emilie sat at home.

Brady picked up Trigg from school around 2pm, Brady stopped to pick up McDonald's on the way home.

Emilie leaves at 6pm to go out to dinner with friends and leaves her toddler & newborn at home with Brady. She doesn't make dinner or any food for Trigg before leaving, instead Brady makes Trigg dinner again (frozen microwaveable pancakes) so Emilie can go meet the girlies.

We have no idea what SHE was doing all day at home but seems like an easy, laid back day with Brady doing the bulk, if not all, of Trigg's childcare before she leaves both kids with him so he can continue the childcare, by himself, into the night.

Yet SHE ALSO doesn't ensure a safe environment for her child before leaving for the night. She KNEW there was no pool fence, no pool net in use, no working door alarms. 

She also knew her husband would likely be watching the basketball playoff game and would be distracted yet took zero precautions to secure the environment for her babies. 

Going out with the girls was more important.

And THAT makes me just as angry and disgusted with HER. 

They were BOTH lazy and completely negligent when it came to their son's safety. Honestly, she could have been in the shower and this happened within the same 10 min timespan and everyone wouldn't be excusing her and placing all the blame on Brady, because she would have been home with the unsecured environment. There's just NO excuse for that.

I have two kids. In my friend group, we almost always bring the newborn / baby with us and leave the older kid at home, if there is one. It appears that she portrayed a loving, doting mother on camera but didn't lift a finger for him when her camera wasn't rolling.

1mn01s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mn01s2/has_she_lost_interest_in_me/,Has she lost interest in me?,"I just need to understand this. The girl I’m seeing right now is very amazing. Our first date was short, only for about 4hrs. I had amazing time with her, we went to arcade, cafe since we both like coffee and many more.

So, I look forward to the next one which is going to be in two hours now haha. But, she said she is not a big texter and that she likes meeting in person more. 

She works at a musical instrument shops and that’s how I found out we both like playing instruments too. I’m getting my bachelor’s degree and about to be in work field not too long now. I’m a Networking major student. 

 But, I’m afraid she might’ve lost interest in me. I don’t want to push it since she is busy most of the time, but when she responds, they’re short and really seem uninterested. I used to get morning and or at-least reacts my goodnight messages and daily messages. But, now she not only say those things back to me, she won’t even acknowledge them, or at least that’s how i feel right now. And, im scared right now for the second date, i feel like she might only go on this date with me because she kept a promise and not because she is still interested in me.

Am I just too extra or does she not like me anymore?",0,1754875790.0,dating_advice,1,0.33,False

There’s barely any weight for me to lose, I don’t eat junk food so there’s no diet to adjust, and I cycle/yoga/pilates/lift weights, so I have no idea what I should be doing differently.

I'm missing out on school, my crush, and most importantly, my weekly coffee from the canteen. Can't he just let me wallow in my misery? By the way, Dad, I'm still doing my schoolwork, even when I'm at home, and it's way harder because I don't have a teacher to explain it.
