1pw33px,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pw33px/the_lady_upstairs/,The lady upstairs,"After 36 years of living in an apartment complex, I can confidently attest that a night owl is the worst kind of neighbor. Being as lucky as I am, I had one of those moving into the apartment right above mine at the start of October.

It was a lady who seemed to have an endless supply of worldly goods that all needed to be put into place the moment she moved in. Every single evening, at 9 pm exactly, she would start either hammering away, drilling the walls, or pushing furniture across her floor, always managing to reach the noise level of an angry bull in heat.

I have always had quite sensitive ears, so I’m no stranger to being awake at night because of bothersome noises. There is always noise in the city, whether from drunkards singing at the top of their lungs or nocturnal critters running amok in the streets. Trust me, the sheer number of times I’ve been woken up by an opossum knocking over a trashcan outside my window is ridiculous. The thing is - these disturbances would always be occasional and brief; whenever they occurred, I could easily fall back asleep afterwards. But ever since the day that lady moved in, the night has been filled with constant sounds of her mayhem.

The cacophony upstairs would go on every evening for about 3-4 days in a row. Then, at some point, I would hear a large thudding sound, indicating that she had brought out yet another box full of stuff that needed to be set up. This routine sent me into a hellish cycle of exhaustion: I would fall asleep late and wake up exhausted in the morning. I would then have to drown myself in coffee and go to work, hoping that I could get some sleep later in the evening.

Don’t tell me that I just should’ve confronted her. I didn’t want her to think that I was just some cranky old man. Besides, I don’t like confronting people; I have always felt awful whenever I’ve had to reprimand someone. I also didn’t know her name, which I felt would have made the interaction even more unbearable. I just sat on my couch, waiting for the commotion to stop.

Suddenly, three weeks had passed, and she showed no signs of being finished unpacking.

The seeds of chaos were planted as the clock struck 9 pm on an unusually hot evening late into October. An evening so hot that I had to have my windows open to be comfortable. The lady upstairs started toiling away, following her usual schedule.

It was just as loud as all the other days. I twisted and turned in my bed, trying to cover my ears with my pillow, as I had done so many nights before. But this night was different. The heat, mixed with my drowsiness and the sounds from upstairs, all compiled into a thundering migraine. It felt as if my brain was swelling, trying to crack my head open and run away to escape the noise. I couldn’t take it any longer.

I sat up in my bed, inhaled all the air that could fit into my lungs, and yelled:

“QUUUIIIIIEEET!”

My yelling was followed by a large thud from upstairs. She had just started unpacking another box, I thought to myself. I couldn’t believe it. She had to have heard me. My yelling was so loud that they probably heard me all the way up on the 5th floor. I stared at the ceiling, awaiting the sounds of the troublemaker and her orchestra from hell.

I waited, and then I waited some more. More time passed, but there were no more sounds coming from upstairs. Maybe she did hear me. Maybe she was finally being respectful.

I felt my headache subside as I lay back down. I closed my eyes, letting my fatigue carry me towards slumber. I was completely unbothered for the first night in a long time. I rose with the sun several hours later, and I didn’t have to chug half a liter of coffee to stay awake. I went to work with a smile on my face and a good feeling in my body.

Everything was easier. I was happier. It was paradise compared to before.

I came home that evening, hoping that the night before wasn’t an exception. If only I had been that lucky.

After the sun had gone down, there was activity in the upstairs apartment again. This time, though, the sounds were a bit different. All I could hear was

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

Repeating over and over again.

I couldn’t place the sound. It didn’t come from any tool that I knew of; I was sure of that. There were irregular pauses between the sounds, ranging from about five seconds to ten seconds. It wasn’t just heavy footsteps, that was for sure; the spaces between them were too big. It wasn’t a hammer either; the sounds were much too quiet for that.

This thought process continued as I lay in my bed that night, my weary eyes fixated on the ceiling.

“Maybe she’s tapping her foot on the floor to a song… But the sounds are not rhythmical in the slightest … Maybe she’s dropping a ball repeatedly… But why would she even do that? Is she a juggler? No… that’d be ridiculous.”

These were but some of the thoughts rushing through my head as the sounds kept resonating in the background. It was beyond the midnight hours before I fell asleep that night.

When I woke up in the morning, the noises had stopped. I assumed that she had just started working on her apartment again. Throughout the whole day, at my work and when I went home, I silently prayed that I wouldn’t hear those sounds from her apartment again. Even though they were less noisy than normal, there was something about not being able to identify them that just made them much more annoying. To my dismay, however, the noises had begun anew by the rising of the moon.

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

Lying in my bed that night, I was gritting my teeth out of sheer annoyance. I covered my head with my pillow again, but it was no use; I could still hear the sounds no matter how much I tried to keep them out. They made me feel as if someone was constantly poking at my brain, molding it like a piece of clay.

Maybe it was revenge; maybe, just maybe, she was mad about my yelling and was doing this to get back at me. Maybe she just wanted to drive me nuts with her antics. I tried to fall asleep, but it wasn’t happening. The sounds from upstairs echoed in my head, much louder than any of the sounds that had been there in the weeks before. It was pure agony.

My heart skipped a beat as my phone started ringing. I cautiously picked it up, wondering who was calling in the middle of the night.

“H - Hello?” I mumbled.

“Peterson! Where the fuck are you, man? We’ve been waiting for you for 45 minutes!”

“Oh, hello, sir… I’m sorry, but my shift doesn’t start till…” I looked towards my window.

The rays of sunlight had already broken through and cast light onto my floor.

“SHIT! S - Sorry, sir… I’ll be there in fifteen minutes!” I said as I got out of bed and hung up the phone.

What followed was one of the worst days I’ve ever had in my life. I was a walking corpse with only one thing on my mind: what were those sounds?

I eventually got home, and I didn’t care about relaxing. Relaxation wasn’t even on my mind. All I wanted to do, and all I did, was await the sounds. I sat on my couch, staring at the ceiling, and like clockwork, the commotion started back up late into the evening.

Bump…

Bump…

Bump…

I couldn’t take it another night; it was torture. I didn’t care what she thought of me anymore. I didn’t care about having to scold her. I stormed out the door and up the stairs and pounded on the door.

“WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM?!”

The sound stopped, but I wasn’t satisfied; they were going to start again. I wasn’t fooled.

I turned the door handle and walked inside. Her apartment was cold like night and as silent as a library. I walked into the living room, and that’s where I found her.

She was lying on her back at the foot of a small stepladder. She lay beside the corner of a wooden table. The corner was covered in a mixture of dried brown blood and long black hairs. On the side of her head was a crater of blood, hair, skull fragments, and brain matter. Both of her arms were mangled to the bone. A swarm of flies was nesting on her body. The windows in the living room stood open, taking in the autumn breeze and wafting away any smell of rot there should have been. As I stood there, taking it all in, I heard some skittering. I stared in disbelief as a chubby little form crept out from one of the moving crates on the floor, where it had likely been hiding from all the noise I had made.

It was an opossum, currently unaware of my presence.

It crawled over to the body and started gnawing at her hand. Every time the opossum ripped off a piece of flesh, the hand was lifted into the air before subsequently dropping to the floor, producing a light bump.",1,1766751885.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1pw32xy,https://i.redd.it/y3miuw54kj9g1.jpeg,The 5 Zodiac Signs Most Likely to Meet Their Person in 2026,"*A practitioner’s perspective on the cosmic alignments bringing once-in-a-decade romantic opportunities*

I’ll never forget the woman who came to me last January, tears streaming down her face, asking if she’d ever find love. She was 34, had just ended another situationship that went nowhere, and was convinced something was fundamentally wrong with her.

“Everyone else seems to find their person,” she whispered. “Why not me?”

I looked at her chart. I saw what was coming. And I told her: **“Your story isn’t over. It hasn’t even really begun yet.”**

She met her fiancé that September.

After two decades of reading charts on [coto](https://app.coto.world/uv1xT3VEpZb), I can tell you this with certainty: [**Timing is everything. And 2026? This is the year many of you have been waiting for**](https://app.coto.world/uv1xT3VEpZb)**.**

# Why 2026 Is Different

We’re transitioning from the Year of the Snake (2025) into the Year of the Horse (2026) — and this shift is massive.

The Snake year asked you to shed old skins. To release relationships that weren’t right, patterns that kept you stuck, versions of yourself that blocked real love. It was painful. You might have felt like you were going backward while everyone else moved forward.

**But you weren’t going backward. You were preparing.**

The Horse year brings galloping momentum and magnetic connection. Horses don’t run alone — they seek their herd. Combined with rare planetary alignments I only see once a decade, 2026 is creating extraordinary opportunities for the right people to find each other.

And for five signs in particular, the cosmos is orchestrating something undeniable.

# 1. Cancer: You’re Finally Being Seen

Cancer, I know you’ve been the one holding space for everyone else. Nurturing friends through breakups, showing up for family, creating safety for people who rarely return the favor. You’ve wondered if anyone will ever take care of *you* the way you take care of them.

**2026 is answering that question.**

Your visibility is expanding in ways you haven’t experienced in twelve years. People suddenly *see* you differently — your depth, your tenderness, your capacity for love becomes magnetic.

I had a Cancer client who’d been single for six years. Last summer, she walked into a coffee shop and locked eyes with someone across the room. They talked for four hours.

“It felt like he was looking for me,” she told me. “Like he’d been searching for exactly who I am.”

**Your person isn’t scared of your emotions — they’re craving them.**

**Your window**: February through July. Trust those unexpected invitations, those chance encounters, those moments when someone appears out of nowhere.

# 2. Libra: Stop Performing, Start Being

Libra, you’re exhausted from making yourself easier to love. From smoothing over rough edges. From being the peacemaker who adjusts themselves to fit whatever the other person needs.

**2026 is asking you to stop.**

The cosmos is redirecting you toward *authentic* partnership — not the Instagram-perfect kind, but the messy, real, I-see-all-of-you-and-I’m-staying kind.

Here’s the beautiful paradox: **The moment you stop trying to be perfect is the moment your person appears.**

I watched a Libra client finally end a relationship that looked perfect on paper but felt hollow. Someone else showed up within weeks — someone who loved her sharp edges, her occasional mess, her moments of indecision.

“I thought I had to have it all together,” she cried. “But he loves me because I don’t.”

**Your window**: March through September. Pay attention during eclipse season (March 14, September 7) — people who enter during eclipses arrive to change everything.

Stop auditioning for love. Your person is already looking for exactly who you are.

# 3. Aquarius: You’re Not Too Much

Aquarius, you’ve convinced yourself you’re too weird, too intellectual, too independent for partnership. But what if everything you thought made you unlovable is exactly what your person is searching for?

**The Year of the Horse is calling you out of your head and into your heart.**

I had an Aquarius client — a quantum physicist — who’d resigned herself to interesting conversations and casual connections, nothing more. Then she met someone at a conference who not only understood her work, he challenged it. Who matched her 3am intensity and raised her two more.

“I didn’t know this existed,” she told me. “I thought I had to choose between my mind and my heart.”

**You don’t. Your person wants both.**

**Your window**: April through October. If you meet someone during this period who *gets* you in that distinctive way — trust it.

The right person won’t ask you to be less. They’ll give you permission to be more.

# 4. Taurus: The Stability You’ve Been Craving

Taurus, you’re tired. Since 2018, everything solid has felt temporary. Relationships ended. Plans fell apart. You’ve been in survival mode so long you forgot what it feels like to rest in love.

**It’s finally time to rest.**

The cosmic chaos that’s been shaking your foundation for seven years is ending. You’ll feel something you haven’t felt in years: ground beneath your feet. The ability to trust again.

But here’s the gift: You’re not the same Taurus who entered this cycle. You’ve learned to release control, to stay open even when it hurt. **The person you’re about to meet will love this version of you** — the one who’s done the work, who knows their own strength now.

I had a Taurus client who lost everything — her marriage, her home, her entire sense of self. She rebuilt slowly, painfully. Last year, she met someone who didn’t promise forever on the first date. He promised presence. One day at a time.

“I used to think I needed guarantees,” she said. “Now I know I just need someone who shows up.”

**Your window**: June through November. By then, you’re solid but open. Grounded but ready. That’s when love finds you.

# 5. Scorpio: Your Intensity Is Your Gift

Scorpio, you’ve been told you’re too intense. Too deep. Too much. That you need to lighten up, stop wanting connections that transform everything.

**What if everything you’ve been told is wrong?**

You’ve been doing shadow work while everyone else was surface-level dating. You’ve faced darkness most people avoid their whole lives. And you’re wondering if anyone can hold all of that.

**Yes. Someone will.**

The Year of the Horse brings fire to your water — passion, visibility, courage. Your intensity won’t scare the right person away. **It will draw them in like a magnet.**

I’ll never forget the Scorpio client convinced she’d die alone because she “felt too much.” Then she met someone who didn’t flinch at her depth. Who asked to see her shadows. Who looked at her intensity and said, “More. Show me more.”

She called me crying after their third date. Relief tears.

“I thought I had to hide,” she sobbed. “But he wants everything I’ve been afraid to show.”

**Your window**: January through August. When you feel that soul-deep, immediate recognition — don’t run from it. That’s your cosmic confirmation.

Your intensity isn’t a flaw. It’s been waiting for someone who can match it.

# The Truth About Hope

If you’re reading this and feeling that flutter in your chest — that dangerous, vulnerable thing called hope — **protect it.**

I know you’ve been disappointed before. I know you’ve started to believe maybe it won’t happen for you.

**You’re not the exception.**

The cosmic alignments of 2026 are real. The Year of the Horse’s momentum is real. But they’re not magic tricks — they’re *invitations*.

You still have to do the work. You still have to show up. You still have to believe you’re worthy, even on days when that feels impossible.

But here’s what I know after twenty years: **The universe doesn’t create these alignments for nothing.** When the cosmos orchestrates this level of opportunity, it’s because the right people are finally ready for each other.

Maybe you’ve been getting ready your whole life.

Maybe every heartbreak was teaching you what you actually need.

Maybe every night alone was preparing you to recognize home when it finally appears.

**And maybe 2026 is when your paths finally cross.**

# What Happens Next

The stars are aligned. The portal is open. The Year of the Horse is bringing momentum you haven’t felt in years.

If you’re one of these five signs, you’re being given a once-in-a-decade opportunity to meet someone who can match you, grow with you, transform alongside you.

**Don’t waste it hiding. Don’t waste it playing small.**

Your person is out there right now, being guided toward you by the same cosmic forces guiding you toward them.

All you have to do is trust the journey — and show up ready for the love you’ve been preparing to receive.

Day Life:

1. Brown Bee - a cute and quaint spot to get a coffee and relax with a book, though it gets super packed.

2. Coffee Exchange - a popular spot for brown students, this is one of my go to coffee places because of its library like atmosphere.

3. Dunkin Donuts - often overlooked, the one on gano st always has available seating, open parking lot, and is adjacent to the park, which makes it good for walks too.

Night Life:

1. Hot Club - hot club is my jam! great spot to meet and intermingle with people, as well as have a drink with friends.

2. Captain Seaweed's - this is a fun time, the place is welcoming and a hoot with its pool table, juke box, and nautical theme.

3. Desire - 18+ for obvious reasons.

In Between Life:

1. Rochambeu Library - great spot to get homework done and read a book, magazine, or anything else

2. Dexter Park - sometimes I go here to relax and look up at the sky, it's a great green area within the city.

3. Urban Greens - local co-op market with great produce and afforable prices on many foods and basic staples.

I’m new to Bangalore and have been feeling quite lonely lately. Being in a new city without a support system has been harder than I expected, so I’m trying to take a small step by reaching out here.

If anyone else is new to the city or also feeling alone and would like to talk or hang out casually (coffee, a walk, or just conversation), I’d really appreciate connecting.

No pressure at all — even hearing from people who’ve gone through something similar would help.

1pw2vy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/audemarspiguet/comments/1pw2vy3/a_trip_to_le_brassus/,A trip to Le Brassus,"Nestled between the mountains, above the fog, and through the winding roads you arrive at the heart of watchmaking in the Valle de Joux. Just a little over a hundred years ago, watchmakers from the region would take this journey, by foot, returning from Geneva after selling their wares and engaging in trade. Making this journey yourself, albeit a much-expedited version, I truly believe to be important for any connoisseur of horology. The village of Le Brassus is quiet hideaway above the clouds, the very forefront of horological innovation is juxtaposed against the livestock that share the valley. The ties to tradition are strong as watchmakers assembling Grand Complications overlook the same fields that Jules Audemars and Edward Piguet had over 150 years ago today.  

[Valley](https://i.imgur.com/vCASzFY.jpeg)

I had the pleasure of staying at the Hôtel des Horlogers whose history dates to 1857 as the Hotel de France until in 2003 Audemars Piguet took over ownership and radically transforming the hotel into an art piece in itself. When you arrive at your room you are greeted with a small gift basket containing a water bottle, a vial of salt with flavors of fir trees from the valley, a bit of garlic bread, and some tea. 

[Hotel Gift](https://i.imgur.com/6ZBNLq0.jpeg)


The room was beautiful with panoramic sweeping views of the valley for all rooms in the hotel. I highly recommend the restaurant Brasserie Le Gogant where Emmanual Renaut has put together a wonderful menu of local mountain flavors that capture the essence of the village.The hotel has so many charms and quirks. Pretty much everything in the hotel is for sale, on the floors to your room there’s a few items posted for sale such as clothing, jewelry, perfumes, random bits of art etc. It’s kind of like a mall… I had even asked the front desk if even the little bobbles that decorate the front desk were available for purchase and to my surprise they were. 

[It's kind of LIKE a mall...](https://i.imgur.com/0unsCVR.png)

For the day of the tour, you have two options of getting to the Musse Atelier. There’s the direct route that allows you to walk next-door directly to the museum, or the more interesting route involving a small detour behind the hotel. Along this path you will see art commissioned by AP contemporary including a triceratops skull cast in bronze and a white rabbit statue as well as really taking in the views of the valley. This route also allows you to get a good view of the glass framed building and its spiral design with grass covered roofs. 

[White Rabbit](https://i.imgur.com/07HGKKn.jpeg)

When you arrive for your tour, you are greeted in an intimate room where you sit and take in the atmosphere of where it all began. You are offered coffee and tea as well as small treats while your tour guide goes over the building and its history. What follows is a journey through time from the discovery of iron in the region to the families establishing themselves here and the journey AP took from creating highly complicated movements to becoming the leader of horological innovation in the modern era. 

[Sign](https://i.imgur.com/oPhZ8WL.jpeg)        

As part of the tour you get to try your hand at some watchmaking techniques including applying perlage to a brass royal oak shaped bezel as well as applying a brushed finish to the front leaving with you a nice little trinket for your trip. If you want to do more watchmaking they offer workshops; however, I unfortunately didn’t have a chance to go to any of the watchmaking workshops, but I heard they’re a great experience and have been recommended by many. 

[Perlage](https://i.imgur.com/KslL3Mv.jpeg)
[Bezel](https://i.imgur.com/eI9JuNX.jpeg)
The tour concludes with a special 150th anniversary room where you can see some interesting designs from the archives and watch some short vintage films from AP through the years describing their watchmaking, there’s also a photobooth where you can take pictures. Finally, there’s a wishing tree where you can write a wish and attach it to a tree. I of course wished for the RD #6 although I am still excited for the more standard complications to come out in the wake of the RD line finishing haha.

[Wishing Tree](https://i.imgur.com/bfx3TGa.jpeg)

There is a small gift shop at the end of the tour where you can buy a museum program and a selection of AP publications, a couple of which hard to find now as they’ve been out of print as far as I can tell. There’s also some notebooks and chocolate :)


[AP Chocolate!](https://i.imgur.com/znPs4On.jpeg)


After embarking on this journey my appreciation for AP has only grown. There's a deep personal connection with AP that most brands can't seem capture. When you wear an AP you feel a tie to the valley, the watchmakers, the families, the history, everything. As an AP customer you are a patron of the contemporary arts, and a supporter of traditional watchmaking that pushes the bounds of what is possible in the the field. 

I highly recommend anyone curious as to why AP is AP to take a visit to Le Brassus and check it out for themselves.",1,1766751096.0,audemarspiguet,0,1.0,False
1pw2tyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pw2tyx/what_would_you_read_from_this_text_from_an_ex/,What would you read from this text from an Ex?,"Hi all,

I’m just after a bit of insight into a text message from my ex and your thoughts on it.

My ex ‘41 F’ and me ‘35M’ broke up 5 years ago. We had been together for 4 years, had a good relationship but found we had to work on ourselves a bit and called a halt to it but I’d say we’ve stayed friendly, though we never meet for coffee or anything like that. We still message on each others birthdays to wish each other well and generally wish each other well at Christmas. Occasionally she’ll message at random to say hi if she’s been speaking to my sister or something as they were friends at school.

I’m not sure what her relationship status is these days and I would never ask but it crossed my mind to message her last night and say happy Christmas, but I didn’t get around to it. Anyway, I woke this morning and she’d messaged me a gif of a film scene from Love actually. It’s a film we’d have watched around Xmas when together. There was no message with it and it was at 7.30am.

I messaged back and said happy Xmas and we had a little back and forth. She asked where I’d be for Xmas and wished me a good time etc.

I’m wondering if maybe she has feelings at the back of her mind and was looking to open a convo or is it just her sending a joke she thinks I’ll find funny etc? I just felt sending something fairly nostalgic that early in the day seemed a little odd.

I’m not sure we could ever go back as it’s been so long now but I’m just curious as I’ll always love her on some level and I don’t want to be an AH for thinking she’d still be attracted to me and message her to find out.

2. **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
3. **Prepare The Night Before:** Lay out clothes, pack lunches/bags, set up the coffee maker, etc., the evening prior to reduce morning friction.
4. **Automate Routines:** Use smart home devices (lights, speakers) or phone routines (Google/Siri) to trigger sequences (e.g., wake up alarm + lights on + music/news playing).
5. **Start Routines Immediately:** Engage in key morning tasks (shower, brush teeth, get dressed) right after waking up to build momentum.
6. **Leverage External Accountability:** Use tools or situations where your inaction impacts others (shared calendars, coaches, friends expecting updates, inviting people over to force cleaning). Ask friends for ""kicks.""
7. **Gamify Tasks:** Turn chores or habit building into a game (timing tasks with a stopwatch, using apps like Finch, setting challenges, pretending to be a character, counting items cleaned).
8. **Use Novelty:** Introduce novelty into routines (multiple toothpaste flavors, cute sponges, new playlists) to maintain interest.
9. **Reward System (Sometimes Before):** Use rewards, occasionally giving the reward before the task to help initiate it (e.g., eat chocolate, then work).
10. **Consistent Placement:** Always put essential items (keys, wallet, phone) in the exact same place or pocket every time.
11. **Reduce Friction:** Identify and remove barriers or extra steps for tasks (e.g., keep cleaning supplies where needed, use pre-portioned snacks, don't fold clothes that don't need it)

1pw2t0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_notdesperatejustdumb/comments/1pw2t0v/dancing_on_porcelain_shards/,Dancing on Porcelain Shards,"I crashed onto the sofa, exhausted. The wool fibres, with their maternal attribute, caressed my cheeks and neck, perhaps stealing for themselves a scent of my perfume, notes of vetiver and bergamot. They do that every day, yet they still smell of sandalwood. The agarbattis are to blame.

""Ma'am, your coffee."" Savitri is turning into a ghost these days, suddenly materialising from the ether and vanishing back into it once her duty is over, only to appear again in the peripheries of my vision a moment later, like a glitch on National TV.

She still has a bandage on her foot. I don't like seeing bandages, especially those with Betadine perspiring through the fibres. She should have been more careful. Doesn't she know the terrifying limits of her Madam's anger? It's time. She should have known. I have told her never to walk barefoot inside the house. She still forgets. Yes, in a fury of rage I threw a cup at the wall. And yes, it shattered and spread its sharp debris everywhere. Even a child knows not to clean it up barefoot! Pathetic. I didn't apologise. I won't. I called my physician, had her foot bandaged, and he instructed her never to wet it. The blood lay there waiting to be cleaned. I don't know how long it took her; I had gone to my room. I had an online meeting to attend.

""Is it still paining?""
""No,Madamji. It's okay.""

The driver dada came in and handed my bag to Savitri. She went up to put it in my room. Dada glanced at me, I think, before he went outside.

I took the coffee to the courtyard and, with an exasperated sigh, lit a cigarette. It is cold. Really cold. Shiuli flowers here and there. A squirrel mucked about, munching on something.

""Savitri...""

""Yes,Madamji?"" I heard her voice limping towards me. Don't answer like that! Do you want me to scream 'Savitri!'? Do you want me to hurt my neck turning to answer you? I waited for her to get near. She came and stood beside me. I am glad she's not in a head-bowed posture. She is standing up straight, like a mannequin. She doesn't have to give me more than whatever I pay her for. I am glad she's asserting herself. She too had started smelling of sandalwood, but the scent of sesame oil creeps up, contaminating her otherwise sandalwood aura.

""Have you seen my ghungroos?""
""Are you okay, Madam?"" Just answer what I asked!
""Yes. Where are they?""
""They're in your cabinet,Madam. Near the jhumkas. Did you not see them this morning?"" Is she questioning me? Really? Would I ask if I had seen them? What is she hinting at? I may like her, but this is crossing a line.
""I didn't see. I'll check. First, just take this safety pin off."" I leaned toward her, and she quietly undid the safety pin on my shoulder. They kept the pallu in place. I have no use for them anymore. ""Thank you, Savitri.""

(Vilambit)

I sat on my bed and undid the pallu. The grey and silver fabric pooled in my lap, reflecting the skylight. Every fold of my sari sent another burst of Blue Madeline into the air. I tugged at my blouse; it was loose. In a half-conscious manoeuvre, I undid it. The flaps opened and stayed there like angel's wings on my back. I slowly took it off and threw it onto the chair. The Theyyam pendant lay motionless on my cleavage, supported by that padded bra. I took it off as well. The bra followed, its wires sighing as they released their oppressive hug.

I stood, let the petticoat along with the undone saree fell. I  stepped out of the circle of fabric as if a body, subjected to a violent murder, were stepping out of the chalk outline the police had drawn. Now, only the tattoos remained. The weeping girl on my hip. The Eliot quote across my ribs. The others. In the half-light, they looked like Bhatkhande's notations my music teacher had harangued me into remembering. I am half-glad I escaped her. Thank god for public exams. But I still remember Jog, Miyan ki Malhar, and Kafi like the names of my parents.

I walked to the cabinet and dragged the white Kathak dress out. It too smelled of sandalwood and citrus fabric softener. I touched it to my face, inhaling every bit of it, lint and scent alike. As I tied the drawstring at the waist, I felt the day's vertical authority begin to dissolve, the centre of gravity sinking lower, deeper into the pelvis.

The ghungroos were there, coiled in their red silken cloth, exactly where Savitri had said they would be. Heavy. A hundred tiny, brass mouths.

Sitting on the floor, I lifted my right foot. The air was cold on the sole. I fastened the first belt; the leather was stiff. The bells were silent, except for an occasional murmuration passed down from my shivering hand. I fastened the left. The weight was immediate; ancestral, a pull toward the memory of a time I chose not to inhabit anymore.

I stood. A first, faint sound.

In the silence of the room, still smelling of Blue Madeline and sandalwood, I raised my arms to hastak. I remember the mudras. Barely, at least. The teacher was kind. She always wore a bindi with vermillion on her forehead. I later came to know she never married. I couldn't keep up with the lessons. Perhaps I would go back to her again.

The memory of the vermillion-clad, unmarried woman pulled my awareness down from the buzzing hive of my bureaucratic skull, down through the scaffold of my ribs, down to two columns of bone, strapped with brass, planted on the earth.

I looked in the full-length mirror. A body in-between, white dress, strapped with bells, marked with cryptic bols, pale in the dusk. The face of the woman in the mirror was familiar. Like that of someone who passes you by in an airport. Or who nods at you in respect during some gala or meeting. Like someone you are fated not to meet anytime soon. Like those people who do not exist.

I walked to my record player, shuffled through the vinyl, and took one out. Hamsadwani filled the air. I am yet to smell the scent of Hamsadwani. I know Jog is blood orange. I know Malhar is petrichor. I know Bahaar smells of Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia. What is Hamsadwani?

I transferred my weight to the right foot. Slow. Not hurting the marble. The bells on the left foot lifted, just a centimetre, and sighed back to the floor.

Ta.

(Madhyama)

It was slow. I know I am not following the notes. I was just moving the way I wanted to. I wasn't letting the notes dictate my movements. My knee hurts.

Ta Thei Thei Tat.

They have grown stiff sitting in ergonomic chairs, shielded by the mahogany desk. They have gone lazy. They have forgotten the Aramandi. The vermillion-clad woman's soft instruction cracked through: ""Mori Painjaniya.""

“Sit down! Lower! You look like a stork, my dear! Sit!”

A burst of pain shot up. I cannot do this shit.

I closed my eyes. And suddenly, the marble floor wasn't marble. It felt like wood. A wet, cold, wooden floor. Somewhere, I could hear the ocean. It was raining there. It is always raining in my past. The bad London weather, the Kerala monsoons. Car windows always punctuated by droplets, roads looking darker, leaves greener.

The smell of Hamsadwani was of rain-soaked leaves in the middle of monsoon with a dose of ozone, the smell of the air split open by lightning. It was the smell of the wet earth that Savitri walks on barefoot. I don't know when she'll start obeying me. Had it not been for her amazing Shahi Paneer, I would have fired her ages ago. Given two months' salary as severance and asked driver dada to drop her at the airport. And I wouldn't even visit her when I go to Kolkata. That's for sure.

But I won't fire her. I don't know what I would do without her.

I think my biggest issue would be teaching a new one all my likes and dislikes. I hate to repeat myself.

Tat Tat Tat.

The smell of sweat. My sweat. It's sweet, but revolting. I stopped and ran to my cupboard, spraying a bit of Blue Madeline under my arms. But still, I could smell it. The salt. The iron. The meat. The dirty animal. And she has no business occupying my space.

Tat Tat Tat.

I stomped my feet harder. Thankfully there were no porcelain shards underneath. No one was angry. No oozing Betadine. No unwanted, old, shoeless feet. Just a tired woman. And beats on the tabla.

The rhythm accelerated. Kishori Amonkar began to sprint, shedding her melancholy for a frantic, geometric joy.

Sweat washed away the Blue Madeline.

My balance wavered. I tried to straighten my spine, tried to regain the dignity of the vertical. But the rhythm was an undertow. It pulled me down.

(Drut)

I abandoned the technique. I abandoned the grace. I let Hamsadwani and the ghungroos take over.

Takita Takita Takita Takita.

I spun. One chakkar.

Kishori Amonkar's voice climbed the octave, wailing. The vinyl is corrupted. How did the ringtone of my work phone get inside. Where did the 'Ding' of a new email come from? The 'clack-clack' of the keyboard? The rhythmic chanting of 'Yes Ma'am, Yes Ma'am, Yes Ma'am, matching the beat of the Tabla? I need to find another Vinyl. I should tell the driver dada to take me to Khan Market. What did my physician said to him by the way? I totally forgot about it.

The room smeared. The cabinet spun past. The bed looked inviting. A bit of saliva oozed from my chin. I bit my tongue to feel something. I coughed. My throat was raspy with nicotine stains. I felt Savitri ogling through the cracks in the door, the smell of Betadine spreading through them. I know she's there. Shouldn't she be cooking dinner?

Two chakkars. The bed was a white blur.
Three.Four. Five.

Centrifugal force is a law of physics, and it applies to the soul as well. If you spin fast enough, the heavy things are thrown outward. What a load of bullshit? Where did this lazy pop psychology got into my brain?

I felt as if a priest, in Kishori Amonkar's voice, were uttering a chant of exorcism. ""exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus""

I was panting like a dog. Dirty. Smelling. Saliva on my chin. Unappeasing. I should pass out, be flung into a corner, hit my head on something stiff. There would be a scar. I wouldn't be applying Betadine to it, that's for sure.

Sweat. The room was heating up. There was only steam and heat. Pure, friction-born heat.
I was sweating profusely now.My skin wept the chemicals out. I could taste salt on my lips. It tasted like the ocean in Kerala.

Dha Dhin Dhin Dha.

I looked at the mirror as I whipped past it.
Where is that elegant lady who looks at me with contempt? If only she could see these wide, feral, and awake eyes.

Yes! There she is.
I felt the burning in my calves.I felt the skin of my soles blistering against the hard marble.
Pain.Glorious, undeniable pain.

The music reached its crescendo. The tihai began. The countdown to the end.

Dha-kat-dha-dhin-dha.

I stomped the floor. I wanted to break the marble. I wanted to crack the foundation of this architectural marvel...

Dha-kat-dha-dhin-dha.

My breath was ragged. Sweat poured from my light brown eyes. The eyeliner is waterproof, thank god! My heart was flailing around as if someone held a pillow over it with malicious intent.

Dha-kat-dha-dhin-dha.

Dha.

I stopped.

The silence crashed into the walls like a porcelain cup. I should be careful not to step on its sharp shards.

I stood there, heaving, my chest rising and falling in violent spasms. The ghungroos gave one last, dying shiver and went still.

I looked down at my feet. They were red. Blue veins throbbed against pale, cleanly shaven legs. The pedicured toes looked like a prick from the Delhi winter would make them spill a river of blood laced with Betadine. Like an overfilled water balloon.

I looked in the mirror.

The woman staring back was dishevelled. Her hair was a mess. Her face was slick with sweat. The eyeliner had smudged.

She looked ugly.

I saw her chest moving up and down. She was breathing. That's how I knew she was alive.

I closed my eyes and breathed.

I changed the vinyl. Put on Ravi Shankar.

I went to the balcony. The chair hugged me. I took out a cigarette and lit it.

""Savitri... bring me some water.""

I’ve seen it happen in Pune more times than I can count: employees arriving stressed, guests stuck in long queues, organizers sweating bullets, and the HR team praying silently that no one loses their cool. And the sad part? Most of it is totally avoidable.

In this guide, I’ll break down everything you need to know about managing registrations for corporate events, with real Pune examples, tips that actually work, and how professional teams like [Four Entertainment](https://share.google/wgbA8057oBwVPLKLJ) make it all smooth.

# Why Corporate Event Registrations Are Stress Magnets

Think about it: your guests are excited about the event, maybe even looking forward to networking or enjoying an activity. But the first interaction they have? The registration desk.

If that’s chaotic, here’s what usually happens:

* Guests get frustrated by long queues
* Confusion about pre-registered vs on-site registration
* VIPs or senior executives waiting too long, which reflects poorly on your company
* Event staff running around trying to find badges, lanyards, or kits

I remember one tech company event in Hinjewadi. The morning registration line was so long that a group of employees joked:  
*""I signed up for a fun day, not a morning marathon!""*

This is exactly why registration planning is not just an admin task—it sets the tone for your entire corporate event.

# Step 1: Plan Before You Register

Everything begins before the guests even arrive.

* **Choose the Registration Type:** Online, on-site, or hybrid. In Pune, most IT and corporate offices prefer online pre-registration. It gives an idea of headcount and helps with logistics.
* **Decide What to Collect:** Keep it simple. Name, designation, company, email, dietary preferences, and special access needs. Avoid extra fields—every additional click increases drop-offs.
* **Set Deadlines and Communicate:** Clearly mention cut-off dates. Nothing stresses guests more than ambiguous registration deadlines.

**Real incident:** At a corporate event in Baner, the HR team sent registration emails without mentioning a cut-off date. Guests assumed they could register anytime. On the event day, the staff had to scramble to make extra badges for 30 late entries. Total chaos. Lesson: pre-plan and communicate.

# Step 2: Leverage Technology for Smooth Registrations

Technology can save hours of stress and hundreds of headaches.

# Online Registration Platforms

Platforms like Eventbrite, Zoho Events, or even Google Forms can simplify data collection and give real-time reports on registrations.

# QR Codes

Generate unique QR codes for each registrant. On the day of the event, scanning a QR code is faster than looking through a list.

# Event Apps

Some corporate events in Pune use mobile apps for registration, check-in, and even session scheduling. Apps allow attendees to see their itinerary and location without constantly asking staff.

**Real incident:** A company in Wakad used QR codes for check-in. The difference was night and day. Employees arrived, scanned their QR codes, and picked up their badges in less than 30 seconds. The HR team, who had previously spent hours checking names manually, literally took a coffee break during peak check-in time.

# Step 3: Pre-Event Communication

Communication is key. Your guests should know exactly what to expect before they step into your venue.

* **Confirmation Emails:** Include date, timing, location, dress code, and parking info.
* **Reminders:** Send 1-week and 1-day reminders. These drastically reduce no-shows.
* **Special Instructions:** Highlight IDs, badges, or any items attendees need to bring.

**Local tip:** In Pune, parking is always a challenge. Pre-communicate parking arrangements in areas like Aundh, Hinjewadi, or Baner to avoid last-minute chaos.

# Step 4: Set Up On-Site Registration Strategically

When guests arrive, first impressions matter. A well-organized registration desk can set the tone for the day.

* **Separate Counters:** Pre-registered, on-site registration, VIPs, media, and sponsors should all have separate counters.
* **Clear Signage:** Use large signs to direct attendees.
* **Trained Staff:** Staff should know tech, answer queries, and troubleshoot quickly.
* **Pre-prepared Materials:** Badges, lanyards, welcome kits, and agendas ready to go.

**Story from Pimple Saudagar:** A corporate event last year had only one counter for 200 attendees. People queued for 45 minutes. After feedback, the company hired a professional [eventplanner nearme in Pimple Saudagar,](https://share.google/wgbA8057oBwVPLKLJ) who introduced four counters and a QR code system. The next event ran flawlessly.

# Step 5: Streamline Check-In

Check-in is where everything can go right—or completely wrong.

* **QR Code Scanning:** Fast and efficient.
* **Manual Backup:** Always keep a printed list in case of tech failure.
* **Express Lanes:** Separate lanes for VIPs or pre-registered guests.
* **Real-Time Updates:** Track attendance to measure walk-ins and no-shows.

**Real incident:** A corporate family day in Hinjewadi went from chaos to calm after introducing a QR code lane. Guests were amazed at how fast the process was, and the staff reported much less stress and complaints.

# Step 6: Manage Walk-Ins and On-Site Registrations

Even with perfect pre-registration, there will always be walk-ins.

* Allocate dedicated staff and counters for walk-ins.
* Keep extra badges and welcome kits ready.
* Use clear instructions and polite communication to avoid crowding.

**Local example:** At a corporate event in Ravet, 15 unexpected guests arrived. Without a dedicated walk-in counter, the main queue nearly collapsed. On-site registration chaos was avoided next time after a[ professional planner ](https://www.eventcompanypune.com/)suggested a separate lane and prepared extra kits.

# Step 7: Data Management and Follow-Up

Registration doesn’t end once the badges are handed out.

* **Track Attendance:** Compare pre-registered vs actual attendees.
* **Collect Feedback:** Post-event surveys help plan better next time.
* **Use Data for Leads:** Segment attendee information for future corporate communications or events.

**Story:** A manufacturing company in PCMC used registration data to identify which departments never attended past events. After proper communication and better registration handling, attendance improved 35% the next year.

# Step 8: Extra Tips for Stress-Free Registration

1. **Test Everything:** Do a dry run of scanners, badges, and counters.
2. **Communicate Clearly:** Signage, staff instructions, and pre-event emails reduce confusion.
3. **Plan for Peak Times:** Morning rush or session changes need extra hands.
4. **Personalize:** Personalized name badges or welcome kits enhance attendee experience.
5. **Emergency Plan:** Have extra tech, paper, and backup staff for surprises.
6. **Local Awareness:** Understand Pune traffic patterns—avoid peak traffic hours for check-ins in Baner, Aundh, and Wakad.

# Real Stress-to-Relief Stories

* **Hinjewadi IT Firm:** Previously, attendees queued for 40 minutes in scorching heat. After hiring **Four Entertainment**, registrations were divided into three zones with QR scanning. Employees joked they had more time to grab chai than stand in line.
* **Baner Corporate Training Event:** Attendees got lost between parking lots and registration counters. With a **local eventplannerpune**, signage, and volunteer guides, confusion disappeared, and attendees actually enjoyed the arrival experience.
* **Pimple Saudagar Networking Event:** Walk-ins caused chaos last year. With proper pre-registration, on-site counters, and communication, attendees felt welcomed, not stressed. HR team described it as “the first event where registration felt like part of the fun, not a headache.”

# Why Professional Planning Makes a Difference

Managing registrations is just one aspect of corporate events. When done well, it makes the entire event feel smooth and professional. When done poorly, the entire mood collapses.

**Professional planners, like Four Entertainment, handle:**

* Pre-event registration strategy
* On-site staffing, QR code and badge management
* Walk-ins and VIP handling
* Crowd flow and communication
* Post-event data and feedback

They’ve handled events across Baner, Wakad, KP, Aundh, Ravet, PCMC, and Hinjewadi, understanding local nuances and avoiding common pitfalls.

# Final Thoughts: Registration Sets the Tone

Corporate events are stressful enough for attendees. The registration process doesn’t need to be another headache.

If you plan properly, leverage technology, communicate clearly, and manage on-site logistics, registration can become a seamless and even enjoyable part of the experience.

Hiring a [professional event planner in Pune ](https://www.eventcompanypune.com/)or [event planner nearme in Pimple Saudagar](https://share.google/wgbA8057oBwVPLKLJ) ensures that:

* Guests feel welcomed
* Staff can manage efficiently
* The event starts on a high note

At the end of the day, attendees remembe**r** how smooth the arrival felt, not just the keynote or the lunch spread.

This is why companies in Pune trust [Four Entertainment](https://share.google/wgbA8057oBwVPLKLJ)—they handle registrations, full-scale event planning, and execution with precision, making every corporate event stress-free and memorable.

Takeaway**:** Don’t let registrations ruin your corporate event. Plan, organize, and trust professionals to make it seamless. Your attendees will thank you—and your HR team might even get to relax for the first time in years.",1,1766750619.0,weddingtips14,0,1.0,False

1pw2o3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/RipeStories/comments/1pw2o3j/trucking_company_versus_illegal_hoa_parking_true/,Trucking Company versus ILLEGAL HOA parking (True Story),"The first frost arrived before anyone admitted there was a problem, though the signs had been there for months. The lot belonged to North Valley Freight (NAME CHANGED TO PROTECT COMPANY INFORMATION), a trucking company that had occupied the land long before the nearby subdivision existed. A weathered sign near the entrance read **PRIVATE PROPERTY — AUTHORIZED VEHICLES ONLY**, its letters faded but still legible to anyone who cared to look. People did look. They just didn’t care. Cars began appearing overnight, then during the day, then permanently. Sedans, SUVs, holiday guests’ vehicles. The Homeowners Association from Pine Hollow Estates slowly adopted the belief that the unused space next door was a convenience rather than a boundary.

At first, North Valley tried to be reasonable. Emails were sent. Notices were posted. Legal letters followed. Nothing changed. The tow company stopped returning calls after HOA complaints flooded their office. Someone posted pictures online accusing the company of bullying residents. Words like *shared space* and *community overflow* appeared in HOA newsletters. Meanwhile, drivers lost time, yard checks ran long, and operations were disrupted by cars parked where trailers were supposed to move.

Keith Reyes watched all of this quietly. He worked logistics, the kind of role that didn’t come with much authority but came with complete awareness. He understood how freight moved, how space mattered, and how systems failed when people ignored rules they didn’t like. December was supposed to slow everything down. Instead, it magnified the problem. One morning, he stood by the window and watched a woman in a red parka lock her car in the lot and jog back toward Pine Hollow without a glance at the building behind her. She moved with the confidence of someone who expected no consequences.

The issue came up again in meetings. Legal cautioned restraint. Management sighed. Everyone agreed it was frustrating. No one had a solution that didn’t involve a fight. Then Keith noticed the calendar. Christmas Eve fell midweek that year, and North Valley would shut down operations entirely from the 24th through the 26th. No drivers. No dispatch. Just minimal security. The yard would be still.

He began paying closer attention. Which cars parked where. Which belonged to HOA board members he recognized from social media. How the far edge of the lot—where empty trailers were staged—was usually left open. Empty trailers were harmless things most of the time, steel boxes waiting patiently for engines. They didn’t move themselves. They didn’t argue. They simply occupied space.

On December 23rd, the company ran a partial day. Everyone was eager to leave. Keith volunteered to stay late and coordinate yard positioning. No one questioned it. As dusk settled, unauthorized cars filled the lot as usual, their owners assuming operations were done for the week. They were right.

The change happened without drama. No announcements. No confrontation. Empty trailers were positioned where empty trailers were always positioned, just arranged with a different intention. Rows of forty-eight-foot trailers stood aligned with deliberate precision, forming corridors and walls where open lanes had been before. No engines. No trucks attached. Just locked steel, silent and immovable. From the road, the yard looked normal. From inside it, every parked car was boxed in completely.

Keith walked the perimeter once before leaving, breath visible in the cold air. He didn’t touch a single vehicle. He didn’t damage anything. He didn’t smile. Then he went home.

Christmas morning arrived quiet and pale. The first voicemail came just after eight. Then another. By nine, security’s inbox was full. Confusion spread as people arrived to retrieve their cars and found themselves staring at steel walls. Some tried to squeeze between trailers. Some called tow companies and were told there was no access. One person called the police, who arrived, looked around, and shrugged. It was private property. A civil matter.

Phones buzzed. Group chats exploded. Pine Hollow’s Facebook group caught fire with accusations, threats, and outrage. Words like *illegal* and *kidnapped* were used freely. No one mentioned the sign.

Inside North Valley’s dark office, security logged incidents and took photos. No one answered phones. On Christmas Eve, Keith sat at his sister’s table carving ham while his nephew excitedly explained a video game. His phone filled with notifications. He turned it face-down. On Christmas Day, the temperature dropped. Car batteries weakened. Wind rattled decorations loose across the subdivision.

The HOA convened an emergency meeting in someone’s living room. Lawyers were consulted. Emails were drafted. Every attempt to escalate ran into the same obstacle. There was no damage. No towing. No forced entry. Nothing had been done except the lawful placement of company property on company land. And nothing would move until operations resumed on the 27th.

By the second day, the tone shifted. Anger softened into bargaining. A handwritten note appeared on the fence asking for a call. No number was provided. Another offered to resolve things “amicably.” Security logged both and left them where they were. Online, a few HOA members began apologizing—not for parking, but for how things had “gone too far.” Others doubled down, promising lawsuits that never came.

When the company reopened on the 27th, engines returned, steel shifted, and the yard woke up. As trailers were repositioned for outbound loads, corridors opened. Cars were freed one by one. Some owners left immediately without a word. Others waited, arms crossed, faces tight. A few went inside to complain. The general manager listened calmly and repeated the same sentence each time: “We’ve asked for years. Nothing changed.”

After that, things settled. The city declined to get involved. The HOA’s lawyer advised against pursuing anything further. A new sign went up at the lot entrance—larger, brighter, impossible to ignore. Unauthorized parking didn’t disappear completely, but it slowed enough to matter.

Life returned to routine. Keith went back to yard checks and coffee by the window. Sometimes he noticed a car slow at the entrance, the driver reading the sign before turning away. Those moments were small, but they felt permanent.

Years later, the story would grow in the telling. People would say cars were trapped for weeks, that tempers exploded, that the trucking company was ruthless. Keith never corrected anyone. He knew the truth was quieter. No one was hurt. No one was touched. For a few winter days, steel stood still and reminded people that space, like respect, isn’t free just because it looks empty. And sometimes, the most effective response isn’t force at all—it’s patience, timing, and letting the system enforce itself.",2,1766750339.0,RipeStories,0,1.0,False

I feel almost nothing when I drink caffeinated soda, even if I drink large amounts. When I drank an energy drink, I felt kind of on edge, but not exactly a good energetic. However, when I have a good cup of Joe with 2-3 creams, I get all the effects, the ease in pooping, the frequent peeing, the boost in my energy focus and mood, the appetite suppressant, everything.

2. **The 2-Minute Rule:** If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately.
3. **Prepare The Night Before:** Lay out clothes, pack lunches/bags, set up the coffee maker, etc., the evening prior to reduce morning friction.
4. **Automate Routines:** Use smart home devices (lights, speakers) or phone routines (Google/Siri) to trigger sequences (e.g., wake up alarm + lights on + music/news playing).
5. **Start Routines Immediately:** Engage in key morning tasks (shower, brush teeth, get dressed) right after waking up to build momentum.
6. **Leverage External Accountability:** Use tools or situations where your inaction impacts others (shared calendars, coaches, friends expecting updates, inviting people over to force cleaning). Ask friends for ""kicks.""
7. **Gamify Tasks:** Turn chores or habit building into a game (timing tasks with a stopwatch, using apps like Finch, setting challenges, pretending to be a character, counting items cleaned).
8. **Use Novelty:** Introduce novelty into routines (multiple toothpaste flavors, cute sponges, new playlists) to maintain interest. 
9. **Reward System (Sometimes Before):** Use rewards, occasionally giving the reward before the task to help initiate it (e.g., eat chocolate, then work).
10. **Consistent Placement:** Always put essential items (keys, wallet, phone) in the exact same place or pocket every time.
11. **Reduce Friction:** Identify and remove barriers or extra steps for tasks (e.g., keep cleaning supplies where needed, use pre-portioned snacks, don't fold clothes that don't need it)

1pw2m9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1pw2m9a/the_glp1_boxing_day_reset_plan/,The GLP-1 Boxing Day Reset Plan,"Boxing Day in Northern Ireland is strange, half the country is wandering around in pyjamas, the other half is out in the Next queue at 6am, and everyone, absolutely everyone, is living on a dangerous combination of turkey sandwiches, Roses, and complete denial about how much cheese they ate yesterday.

If you’re on Wegovy or Mounjaro, Boxing Day is actually one of the easiest days to get back into your rhythm. No pressure, no big meals, no relatives forcing food on you. Just you, your stomach, and a house that smells faintly of stuffing and Lynx Africa gift sets.

Here’s your wee GLP-1-friendly guide to resetting without feeling like you’re punishing yourself.

First thing: hydration. Christmas Day dries you out more than you realise. Between the heating, the stress, the running about, and the festive drinks, most people wake up on Boxing Day feeling like they’ve been slow-roasted. A big glass of water first thing is genuinely the simplest way to feel human again. Before coffee, before leftover selection boxes, before anything.

Next up: a short walk. Nothing mad. No personal bests. No pretending you’re suddenly training for a marathon. Just a wee stroll around the street or the local park. It gets your digestion moving again, lifts the fog, and settles that slightly-off feeling GLP-1 users sometimes get after a big day of unusual eating. Even ten minutes does the job.

Food-wise, aim for one balanced, normal meal by lunchtime. Not a plate the size of Lough Neagh, not three sandwiches stacked like a tower, not dessert for breakfast (even though that’s technically legal on Boxing Day). Something simple: protein, veg, something light on the stomach. Your digestive system will thank you.

And here’s the big one: absolutely no guilt. Christmas is meant to be enjoyed. If you ate more than usual, or if your stomach felt weird halfway through dinner, or if you couldn’t finish anything at all, you did nothing wrong. GLP-1s change your appetite massively, and holidays are unpredictable. Resetting isn’t about shame; it’s about returning to your normal rhythm calmly.

If your injection falls on Boxing Day, keep it on schedule. Festive chaos shouldn’t knock your meds off their timing. A lot of Keltoi patients find that staying consistent helps smooth out the post-Christmas slump, especially with nausea or fullness.

The best mindset for Boxing Day is gentle structure. Not strict, not restrictive, just a wee bit of order after the Christmas whirlwind. A bit of water, a walk, a normal meal, and the knowledge that you’re back on track without needing to do anything extreme.

Then you can go right back to your turkey sandwiches like the legend you are.",2,1766750146.0,KeltoiWellness,0,1.0,False

After some time he finally found a friend. He was similar to him—just as frightened a little rascal—but the others liked him more. He fit in better among them than he did. During recess they played on the playground that smelled of fresh asphalt. The white lines were beautiful, whole, and precise. They led in all directions. They ran along them. They weren’t allowed to touch the black surface, so they jumped over the edge and turned into a little grove made up of a few evergreen trees planted close together.

“Have you ever?”  
He looked at the ground.  
“Yes. You?”  
“Yes. How many times a day do you do it?”

He didn’t want to be the first to say a number.  
“You first.”

He listened to every breath that might turn into a number from his lips. He prepared himself to hear any second an e-, d-, t-, sh-, p-, … And then:

“Six times!”  
“Yes, me too!”  
“Ha ha! I lied! You do it six times?!”

He looked at him in surprise and then started laughing. He laughed and ran off toward the others. The boy flew after him:

“No, no, I was just joking, I don’t do it six times!”

He really didn’t do it six times, but that didn’t matter.

He was too slow to catch the “friend.” The friend was already so far ahead that he was talking to the others. They all fixed their eyes on him as he approached. When he stopped, ten boys and twenty eyes were staring at him. A strict silence fell over the playground as they watched him, and he watched them with his head lowered, from under his brows. Then the first boy began to laugh, then the second, and then everyone, from start to finish. They were laughing at him. Again, again, again the same thing, again, … His stomach hurt, he felt sick, he was breathing faster and faster, summer heat washed over him, his palms grew sweaty. He turned to the “friend”:

“Why did you tell them?!”  
“Because you’re a freak who does it six times!”

From the others came laughter and mockery.  
“It’s not even true, I thought you did it six times and I didn’t want to look weird. That’s why I said the same!”  
“What’s said is done!”

He was left alone among ten boys. Then the teacher called them back into school. Recess was over, and life went on. On the way across the playground they jabbed him in the ribs; on the stairs in front of the school one tried to trip him, but at the last second he caught himself and shoved the other back so hard that he fell to the ground. He wasn’t hurt, but the teacher saw the second thing, not the first. Then she rushed over and grabbed him by the arm.

“What did you do?! Who do you think you are?!”

One of the boys signaled to the others with waving hands and started imitating crying. He shouted at the top of his lungs:

“It hurts! It hurts!”

Then the teacher grabbed him even more harshly and dragged him to the principal’s office. He sat on a chair in front of the office and strained his ear toward the door. The teacher was yelling and the principal was talking her down. The door opened and black light poured through it, flooding him like a wave. He clung to the chair and trembled. The teacher burst through and grabbed him by the arm again and threw him through the door, making the principal shift a little in her chair.

“What happened?”

The boy tried to explain that the boys had been hitting him and trying to trip him, but the teacher interrupted him every two words:

“That’s not true,”

Each time he had to pull himself together, and with every repetition the story sounded different; he no longer knew what to say.

“See? A liar! I saw him push the poor boy to the ground.”  
“I didn’t! I was just defending myself, he tried first!”  
“You’ll even make things up now?!”  
“I’ll call the parents and demand a reprimand!”  
“No, I’ll sweep the floor, wash the hallway, the toilet?! Please! Please! Please!”

The teacher picked up the phone in the office and dialed. His mother answered. The teacher spun lies; she added everything she could think of to make the boy look even worse—homework here and there, talking during class.

“In fifteen minutes she’ll come pick you up.”

The boy started to cry.  
“Sit down and be quiet.”

As the teacher was leaving he heard some muttering—he’ll see, he’ll see what happens—then he heard nothing more. The principal closed the door, and he was left alone in the silence of the school hallway.

**II**

His mother came quickly, rushing down the hallway. Her face was red and foam gathered on her lips.

“Again! Nothing but problems with you?!”  
“But I’ve never—”

She grabbed him under the arm, just short of breaking it, and dragged him down the stairs so fast that his little legs couldn’t keep up; he stumbled and fell. He hit his shin and started to whimper. His mother rushed down after him and struck him across the face with her palm—once, twice, three times—and then it became a machine gun. She beat him until he got up.

“You do nothing but bring me shame!!!”

He was red from the fall, all the blood rushed to his face, along with his mother’s blows, which hurt more than anything. He had disappointed his mother. Then they hurried to the car; he didn’t dare go slowly, didn’t even dare stop long enough to recover. His pants were hanging almost at his knees as he scrambled down the steps toward the car. His whole body stung; between steps he hurriedly looked to see if he was bleeding anywhere so he wouldn’t stain his pants and shirt. She grabbed him and threw him into the car. He hadn’t managed to climb fully onto the back seat when she slammed the door behind him and caught his little leg between the frame and the door; then she slammed it again, catching his leg again. He screamed as if he were being killed, and she kept slamming it, over and over into his little leg until he could barely feel it anymore.

She sat down in the car, put in the key, looked around herself and the car to see if anyone was watching, turned to him, and began flailing her hands at him; her nails dug into his skin. She didn’t stop until he defended himself with his arms and twisted her arm against the seat.

“Enough,” barely came out of his lips.  
“You’ll see when your father comes home from work. Then your ‘enough’ won’t help at all.”

Then she tried to pull away; the gearbox cracked and roared, the gear caught with loud banging. Out of fear she let off the clutch and the car shot backward and bumped into another one. She jumped out to look if anything showed on the bumper; there was only a small scratch. The boy laughed, his smile stretching from ear to ear, almost breaking into a cackle.

With a big grin he said:  
“HA! Who’ll see when dad comes home? Me or you?”

“Damned brat!”  
“If you tell him about school, I’ll tell him what you did with the car, how you drove it and why it’s always broken!”  
“Today you’ll do ‘homework’ until ten in the evening. If you get up from the table before then, I’ll tell him! Then you’ll see!”

He got under her skin. He continued:  
“Someone saw you before you drove off.”  
“Where?! Where?! Who?!”  
“Ha, ha! Nobody!”

They drove onto the driveway and she opened his door too and dragged him up the steps into the house. She threw him onto the couch so the springs squealed, then ran to the pantry and dragged out a switch and beat him with it like livestock. He writhed, defended himself with his arms, but they began to burn; he tried to stop her, begged, pleaded—nothing happened. In the end he had to turn his back and buttocks.

“Why are you wriggling! You’ll see!” she kept hitting.

He shoved his face as deep as he could into the gap between the backrest and the cushions and tried to drift away. She beat him for a while longer before noticing it was 3:10 p.m.

“Don’t you move!”

She hurried to put away the switch and change clothes. She undressed in the room, not looking at anything; he followed her, not knowing why she had stopped beating him, afraid. He watched her through the crack in the door, watched his mother in a bra and underwear. Then she quickly threw on house clothes and hurried toward the door behind which he was hiding. He couldn’t get away in time; he tried to run down the hallway back toward the living room and the couch. She saw him running:

“What are you doing?! Are you stupid?! Sick!”

He laughed, because now he too saw what time it was. He turned to his mother with a blank face, then stretched his lips into a smile with the fingers of one hand and pointed at the clock with the other.

**III**

Eyes were fixed on the clock. His mother hurried to the stove, threw two pans on it, and began browning onions. The boy retreated back into the living room. He pulled a few toys out of the cabinet and sat on the carpet. He kept shifting in place because everything hurt. He couldn’t find a good position. He lay on his stomach and played with toy cars. A jeep whistled onto the driveway.

“Clean up!”

He barely lifted himself from his stomach. All his limbs were sore and the switch still hurt. He sighed from the pain.

“What is it now? Don’t you make a sound! Clean up, I said!”

He heard the front door opening. He jumped up and forgot all the pain. He grabbed all the toys from the carpet and tried to carry them to the cabinet at once. At that moment he already heard another door. He quickly shoved everything into the cabinet and rushed for his schoolbag. He grabbed it and threw it onto the bench before hoisting himself up as well. He landed so hard it cracked; his mother rolled her eyes and made sure he saw it. From the schoolbag he took a pencil case and the first notebook his fingers touched; he threw both onto the table, but the notebook flew to the floor right under his father’s feet as he came through the kitchen door. He slammed it shut behind him so it rang in their ears. The boy rushed to pick up the notebook, but his father beat him to it. The boy threw himself to the floor to reach it before his father, but his father was faster. He was on the floor when his father struck him on the head with the notebook. His face was completely red.

“Look at yourself!”  
“What do you mean?!”

Before he could get up, it thundered against his head again.

“Are we going to do something, or just mess around? You’re just like your mother—soft and mushy. You’d do anything so you wouldn’t have to do anything.”

His mother hid her tears, but now and then one fell into the pot in which she was cooking dinner. She would be cooking for hours. Meanwhile his father went to the bathroom to wash his feet.

**IV**

Before his father returned from the bathroom, he wanted to prepare everything he needed for homework. He took everything out of his bag. After that he could no longer afford any noise; even the sound of unzipping the schoolbag was sometimes too much. He uncapped all the pens so he wouldn’t have to click them later. He unzipped the pencil case as well. From the cabinet he hurried to take a ceramic mug—his favorite. On it was a faded printed picture of Santa Claus on a sleigh. His mother was watching him. She saw which mug he took and wanted it back. She snatched it from his hands and said:

“I’ll drink coffee from this one!”

There was nothing he could do; he took another from the cabinet and poured himself tea, so sweet it burned his throat. His father never drank tea; he didn’t let his mother buy sweets, so she made tea with ten spoons of sugar. It didn’t quench thirst, but that wasn’t what the tea was for. He sat down at the table again and started on his homework. It was 3:30 p.m. He began copying the dictation and correcting the mistakes the teacher had scribbled in red pencil. He tried to hide the page with mistakes from his mother, who was cooking only a meter away, but he looked suspicious and she grabbed his arm and tried to pull it away. He held it firmly in place so she couldn’t move it, but she dug her nails into his elbow until he yelped and let go.",1,1766750123.0,cptsdcreatives,1,1.0,False

1pw2lhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapingPrisonPlanet/comments/1pw2lhr/prison_planet_theory_makes_perfect_sense_until/,Prison Planet Theory Makes Perfect Sense Until,"…you try explaining it to your own damn self without the memes and the echo chamber. Like, okay, hear me out: grab a coffee, or hell, a stiff drink, because this shit hits different when you strip it raw. I’m not here to drop some polished TED Talk on soul traps and archons. Nah, this is me, 2 AM staring at the ceiling, heart pounding like I just remembered something I wasn’t supposed to. And yeah, it’s terrifying, but fuck if it doesn’t feel true in that gut-punch way you can’t unfeel.


Let’s do a quick exercise first, yeah? Just you and me, no bullshit. Close your eyes for a sec (or don’t, if you’re scrolling in bed like me). For the next few minutes of this post: hell, for the rest of your day if you let it: pretend we’re rewriting the rules. Forget “true reality” as some big cosmic textbook. Instead, let’s zoom all the way in to your experience. Only yours. Like, everything you “know” about history? The moon landing, wars, your grandma’s stories: poof. That all happened “before your birth,” right? It’s hearsay from strangers, pixels on a screen, echoes in books. You weren’t there. You didn’t feel it. So, scrub it. Wipe the slate.


What’s left? You, dropped into this meat suit like a glitch in the matrix. No fanfare, no owner’s manual. One day, bam: you’re here, in this random-ass body, this random spot on a spinning rock. No say in the parents, the country, the era. It’s like waking up mid-dream, mid-sentence, with no clue what the plot was. Heart racing, surroundings blurry, and everyone’s acting like you’ve been here forever. “Welcome to Earth, kid: pay your taxes and die.” Your brain scrambles: “Wait, where’s the exit? Who wrote this script?”


That’s your baseline truth, isn’t it? Not the news, not Reddit threads, not even this post. Your senses. Your aches, laughs, that random joy from a sunset or the knife-twist of loss. You feel the weight of your coffee mug, the itch of your shirt, the hum of the fridge like it’s mocking you. And control? Zero. You didn’t pick the dreams that wake you sweating, or the “coincidences” that feel too scripted. You’re just… playing along. Thrust into a story where the stakes feel eternal, but the runtime? Laughable. Ten years? Eighty if you’re lucky? A blip. A fever dream’s intermission.


Now, lean into that. Really. Look around: right now. The walls of your room, the glow of your screen, the people (or pets, or plants) nearby. Notice how they’re there, but… are they? You feel your breath, your pulse thumping like a war drum only you hear. But them? Their smiles, their bullshit small talk: it’s all external. Projections? Echoes of your own mind folding in on itself? Try this: Imagine they’re not “real” in the way you are. Not souls like yours, trapped and forgetting. Just scenery. NPCs in your personal hell-heaven sim. Because here’s the raw gut-kick: only you exist. Solipsism 101, baby. Everyone else? They’re your story. The loving ones? Comfort props. The assholes? Plot twists to grind your edges sharp. The whole planet? A custom cage, tailored to make you forget you’re the prisoner and the warden.


And yeah, that makes Prison Planet click like a lock snapping shut. We’re not “born” here: we’re inserted. Memory-wiped, strapped into these fragile shells, fed the grand illusion: “This is normal. Grind, consume, repeat. Death’s the end credits.” But what if it’s the loading screen? What if those 10-80 years are the test: the boot camp for something vaster, crueler, or freer? The archons (or whatever you call the jailers) don’t need bars; they just dim the lights and crank the distractions. Wars, ads, dopamine hits: anything to keep you from squinting at the seams.


I felt this yesterday. Driving home, rain smacking the windshield like accusations. Suddenly, it hit: This isn’t home. This is exile. My kid in the backseat, giggling at nothing: god, that love rips me open. Is she “real”? Part of me screams yes, protect her at all costs. But the deeper whisper? She’s the dream teaching me ache, so I fight harder to wake up. And you? What’s your glitch right now? That nagging “something’s off” during quiet moments? The way time slips like sand, and no achievement fills the void?


Prison Planet isn’t just “sense”: it’s the only lens that fits the absurdity. Until… what? Until you decide it’s not. Until you hack the code: Meditate till the veil thins. Question every “given.” Love fiercely anyway, because even in the trap, that spark’s yours. Or rage at it: scream into the void. Either way, you’re stirring.

1pw2jxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/QueerWomenOfColor/comments/1pw2jxe/the_woman_im_dating_pushed_me/,The Woman I’m Dating Pushed Me.,"I’ve (33 W) been dating someone new for a couple of months(31 W) , she’s in town visiting me, overall it’s been great and we fell in love quickly. 


We’ve gotten into small arguments but nothing crazy. 
She’s been extra emotionally down over the past week, stressed about finding a new job, I’ve equally been stressed as I was laid off and my mom is very sick. 
I’ve been hinting at wanting to just have a good Xmas with her and just spend time together which she agreed to even tho she isn’t big on holidays.
Yesterday (Xmas morning came) I woke up excited to maybe have coffee, open gifts and watch a movie together. Just spend time together.

I asked her if she wanted to open the gifts together, she said not really maybe later. I asked her why/what she’s doing, she said applying for jobs. Which I responded saying “ew on Christmas? Can’t you take a break this morning?” This sparked a big argument of her telling me insensitive and wanting to debate if her problems are worse than mine which reallllllly pissed me off. Because she voluntarily quit her job with no plan lined up and didn’t care about the financial strain it would cause her, and now she’s stressed. I was actually laid off, with no desire in losing my job, with a sick parent. I told her I’m empathize and we both have it bad. But regardless she doubled down on her situation being worse, and wanting to just apply for jobs cause she didn’t care about holidays. 

Ultimately my feelings were very hurt, so I grabbed my keys and told her I’d be back. 
I went to a fave view spot of mine and just cried from being overwhelmed. 
Then my mom called, she was getting sicker and going to the hospital. After the call, I honestly just had a panic attack right there, it was Christmas I felt ultra alone, overwhelmed with my mom’s health, and just without anything. I have no siblings, no cousins no real friends. So I drove across town to a graveyard to sit with where my dad is buried and just sat there and cried. 

The girl I’m dating texted me 2 hours into me being gone saying she wants to talk and asking when I’ll be home. I told her I’d be back in about 2 hours. 

I’m driving home, she calls me, asking how I could do I this to her, I asked her what did I do to her, and she said it’s cool I’ll get exactly what I wanted and hung up on me. I text her saying my mom is in the hospital and rather than calling me up to  ask why I did something to her, she could have asked if I was ok or what I’ve been doing. She doesn’t respond to the texts. At this point y capacity meter is drained.

I get home at the time I said I would and she’s sitting on my bed. I asked her why just hung up on me? She stands up and starts walking towards me and begins screaming at me less than an inch from my face saying how dare I abandon her and leave and not check in and tell her where I was. I told her I was accessible and if she wanted to know where I was or if I was ok she could have asked, the same way she asked when I’d be home and I tell her I’ve had a really hard day. She gets more upset saying I sound ignorant and stupid and pathetic and I’m selfish. 

I kind of go numb cause it was already such a hard day for me. She’s so close to my face literally screaming in my face blocking me from walking away, pointing her finger in my face just repeating how awful I am. Then she grabs my arm and pulls me out of my bedroom and screams  “ u want space so bad, go!” And begins pushing me out my room and into the hallway screaming “GO!” at me. And pushes me again. I don’t fall but I do stumble a little with the second push.

I look at her and say “are you really pushing me right now? My mom is in the hospital, I’ve been sitting in a grave yard and now you’re physically pushing me?” 

 (To be honest it was less about me being scared and more so rage, I was ready to knock her lights out). 

She stops in shock, says she didn’t know my mom was in the hospital, she didn’t see the text. She immediately starts crying and apologizing. I’m emotionless to her crying, I had nothing to say. She kept apologizing, I asked her to pack up her things and leave. She starts crying more, goes to the bathroom and starts vomiting or gagging, idk. She begs if we could talk and try to fix it, cause that’s not who she really is, and she was just frustrated and she knows that was unacceptable. 

I go to my room and say we can talk tomorrow morning. She sleeps on the living room floor saying she’s worthless and doesn’t deserve the couch. 

Now it’s 2am and idk what to do. I love her but idk if this is too far and not repairable. I’m shocked that she was aggressive like that towards me, walking towards me in the manner she did, screaming at me, then pushing me when I wasn’t even doing anything.

1pw2jux,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw2jux,"After 10 years owing NS200, I bought a Hunter 350 finally!","I’ve been riding a Pulsar NS200 for about 10 years, and the Hunter 350 is my second bike. Switching from a high revving NS to a relaxed Royal Enfield has been very different, but honestly pretty fun.

Purchased the bike via Amazon and I had a very good experience from dealership end. (Recieved the bike in 11 days of booking)  - got a welcome kit (paid ₹40 to get the water bottle kit instead of the standard coffee mug kit)

In the 450 kms driven here are my personal thoughts

Pros:
1. Relaxed engine  (a big departure from my NS, it's more enjoyable in low end and mid end) likes to sit in lower rpms.
2.Pulls cleanly in 3rd/4th without constant downshifts. (Its a great advantage in city where constant downshits are not required)
3. Excellent engine breaking (for planned stops it is a joy to gracefully come done rather than fighting with the breaks)
4. Doesn’t feel as heavy as it is, surprisingly flickable in traffic.
5. My 46 km daily ride feels less tiring now.
6. Light clutch is a big boon
7. Good in corners whole not sporty, but predictable and composed for RE/heavy bikes standards
8. Excellent thump (I just love the small pops and grunt in the exhaust note in stock setup)
9. In love with the paint job (Especially the matte finish in Tokyo Black is a head turned indeed - not sure about long run maintenance hassles)

Cons:
1. Welding looks rough in a few spots (they should improve it a lot because during PDI when compared between a lot each had their unique flaw)
2. Slight “tick-tick” noise while riding
3. Shutter like sound when rolling off the throttle (kind of annoying)
4. 1st & 2nd gears can be hard (a bit of false neutrals since it's bit heavy to slot in)
5. Gearbox feels clunky overall (not the most smooth experience)
6. Suspension is on the stiffer side 
7. USB C port is away not convenient to plug in
8. Messy wiring area,  battery compartment could have been packed much better and there is no additional space in bike (not even under seat) - it's tightly packed
9. Brakes work but lack initial bite - don't get me wrong it has the stopping power but they are not the best
10. I feel a 6th gear would have been a good addition (but I beleive they did not want to mess with the characteristics of how it puts down the power to wheel considering what RE customers want)

Mileage - seems to be around 34kmph mark (city -50%, highway -50%) (I drive it very calm) need to reconfirm by doing tank to tank

Overall I really like this bike. I love how the engine feels relaxed, torquey, and it naturally makes you ride calmer.

The cons I mentioned aren’t deal breakers for me. I’m pretty sure most of them will get sorted (or at least get used too) after the first service.",9,1766749898.0,indianbikes,10,0.91,False

Now, have I done a few things wrong, yes. I accidentally set off the fire alarm when I was using the new gas stove and didn’t know I had to turn on the vents. I accidentally left a coffee pot on over night. And I tapped someone one time and got written up for touching them. I told my boss that I considered quitting after arguing with the couple while setting up for an event, which the idea of quitting concerned him more than root cause of the argument. Other than that, I haven’t done anything wrong.

But my boss is convinced that I’m a problem. I don’t get along with some of my coworkers. When I do or say something wrong, I’m immediately reprimanded, but if I point out something a coworker does, I’m told I’m being petty.

During my one on one with my boss, he hinted that he still has to make a decision about whether to keep me on after 90 days. I’m constantly bickering with one coworker. I’ve been applying to other jobs (salary based, higher pay) since the second week I started. I have one job that I’m pretty sure I’m going to get.

Now, have I done a few things wrong, yes. I accidentally set off the fire alarm when I was using the new gas stove and didn’t know I had to turn on the vents. I accidentally left a coffee pot on over night. And I tapped someone one time and got written up for touching them. I told my boss that I considered quitting after arguing with the couple while setting up for an event, which the idea of quitting concerned him more than root cause of the argument. Other than that, I haven’t done anything wrong. 

But my boss is convinced that I’m a problem. I don’t get along with some of my coworkers. When I do or say something wrong, I’m immediately reprimanded, but if I point out something a coworker does, I’m told I’m being petty.

During my one on one with my boss, he hinted that he still has to make a decision about whether to keep me on after 90 days. I’m constantly bickering with one coworker. I’ve been applying to other jobs (salary based, higher pay) since the second week I started. I have one job that I’m pretty sure I’m going to get. But also, I’m 99% sure I would be able to go back to full time at the hotel since I’ve been kept on the role this whole time. My current position pays $18 and my part time job pays $16, so that’s a two dollar decrease for maybe a year. Would I be crazy for turning in my two weeks notice ahead of my 90 days? I think it would look better in the long run if I had a voluntary separation and could explain that I just didn’t feel like I fit in vs an involuntary separation and had to explain that I was let go after 90 days ",1,1766749591.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

1pw2e8t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw2e8t,"After 10 years owing NS200, I bought a Hunter 350 finally!","I’ve been riding a Pulsar NS200 for about 10 years, and the Hunter 350 is my second bike. Switching from a high revving NS to a relaxed Royal Enfield has been very different, but honestly pretty fun.

Purchased the bike via Amazon and I had a very good experience from dealership end. (Recieved the bike in 11 days of booking)  - got a welcome kit (paid ₹40 to get the water bottle kit instead of the standard coffee mug kit)

In the 450 kms driven here are my personal thoughts

Pros:
1. Relaxed engine  (a big departure from my NS, it's more enjoyable in low end and mid end) likes to sit in lower rpms.
2.Pulls cleanly in 3rd/4th without constant downshifts. (Its a great advantage in city where constant downshits are not required)
3. Excellent engine breaking (for planned stops it is a joy to gracefully come done rather than fighting with the breaks)
4. Doesn’t feel as heavy as it is, surprisingly flickable in traffic.
5. My 46 km daily ride feels less tiring now.
6. Light clutch is a big boon
7. Good in corners whole not sporty, but predictable and composed for RE/heavy bikes standards
8. Excellent thump (I just love the small pops and grunt in the exhaust note in stock setup)
9. In love with the paint job (Especially the matte finish in Tokyo Black is a head turned indeed - not sure about long run maintenance hassles)

Cons:
1. Welding looks rough in a few spots (they should improve it a lot because during PDI when compared between a lot each had their unique flaw)
2. Slight “tick-tick” noise while riding
3. Shutter like sound when rolling off the throttle (kind of annoying)
4. 1st & 2nd gears can be hard (a bit of false neutrals since it's bit heavy to slot in)
5. Gearbox feels clunky overall (not the most smooth experience)
6. Suspension is on the stiffer side 
7. USB C port is away not convenient to plug in
8. Messy wiring area,  battery compartment could have been packed much better and there is no additional space in bike (not even under seat) - it's tightly packed
9. Brakes work but lack initial bite - don't get me wrong it has the stopping power but they are not the best
10. I feel a 6th gear would have been a good addition (but I beleive they did not want to mess with the characteristics of how it puts down the power to wheel considering what RE customers want)

Mileage - seems to be around 34kmph mark (city -50%, highway -50%) (I drive it very calm) need to reconfirm by doing tank to tank

Overall I really like this bike. I love how the engine feels relaxed, torquey, and it naturally makes you ride calmer.

The cons I mentioned aren’t deal breakers for me. I’m pretty sure most of them will get sorted (or at least get used too) after the first service.",12,1766749324.0,RoyalEnfieldHunter350,2,1.0,False

But its something I cant deny,"My brother had this really close friend who would always come over with some other friends when I was around 12-13 years old. They were always there and were nice so naturally I became friends with them too. Since they were older than me by about 4-5 years, I treated them like my older brothers and they treated me like their younger sister. This one specific friend I became really close to as well and really thought of him as my older brother for years. We were close enough that he would pick me up randomly to go to a McDonalds drive thru at 3-4am and my parents were fine with it because they trusted him too. Again, he was like an older brother. I trusted him a lot and I honestly preferred him over my own brothers because he was nice and friendlier than they were sometimes.

One day we went to go out to eat and grab coffee. I think I was around 16 or nearing 17 years old when this happened. We were packing up our laptops and I leaned on him while watching TikTok on my phone and he put his arms around me. For context, he's much taller than I am. At first his hands were on my stomach area and it was nothing much until he started rubbing his thumb at a much more delicate place right above my stomach area for quite awhile. It started feeling weird and wrong but I brushed it off thinking that it was just a mistake, a miscalculation. When I reached my limit, I just stood up and told him I wanted to go home. I still tried to think nothing of it since he was a close friend right.

We went down and we had to buy something at the place where we parked so while we were in line waiting for the order, I was standing beside him and he put his arm around my waist. A little too far up. His fingers again are not where they are supposed to be. I moved away.

It was only til we got to the car, I stayed silent. I was so confused. I felt wrong, sad, disgusted, weird. I allowed myself to feel safe and vulnerable with someone and they do weird things and what's worse is that my family doesn't seem to care much at all

I didn't receive any apology for any violation or discomfort. Just some words and pretend remorse.

My brother was angry at first but are now buddy buddy with him right infront of my face.

The guy literally just avoids looking at me. Why? Is it because he feels guilty? Did he really have that intention? What else was he gonna attempt if I didn't say anything? It's just so infuriating how I have to stay silent and just see them laugh and smile with someone who literally wronged your little sister and you don't care. My mom told me I have to forgive and forgive. I have forgiven but how could you smile at that person? Do my feelings mean nothing to my own family? If brother had a daughter and this happened to her, would he act the same way? Im so tired of being silent. My tears turn into rage but the rage has nowhere to go and its so exhausting and annoying.

1pw2aep,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw2aep,Thirty Seconds is all it takes to fall in love with this family-run café,"This is part 3 of our Coffika series where we talk to cafe owners and baristas about their stories and coffee culture. Thank you to Beans Depot for making this happen.

I came to meet the owner of Thirty Seconds, Aaron Phua. But what I got was a whole family affair instead. See, Aaron may be the recognisable face of the business (being a Malaysian Barista Champion can have that effect). But his family is the backbone behind the well-oiled machine which is Thirty Seconds. 

He said it best when explaining about what it takes to make a great cup of coffee. 

""It's like F1. People only see the driver, but he wouldn't be able to do any of that without his pit crew, mechanics, engineers and management team. Likewise a good cup of coffee isn't just about quality beans and a skilled barista. You need passionate farmers, roasters, suppliers, people who are committed to the art of coffee at every step of the process.""

His journey to becoming the Malaysian Barista Champion in 2019 was not easy, nor was it planned. He had always wanted to be a chef. As a child he would rather be helping mom in the kitchen, because it meant not having to do homework. When it came to uni, his father advised him to pursue a hospitality degree as a safer choice instead. 

But it all worked out in the end because that led to jobs and meeting the right people in the industry, eventually leading him to the coffee farm in Indonesia which supplies his beans. When Thirty Seconds opened in 2014, he was encouraged by his family and peers to compete in the Malaysian Barista Championship. 

He lost.

He competed again the following year. He lost again, and would continue to until 2019, when he finally unlocked the secret to the perfect cup of brew and brought home the prestigious title which is now proudly displayed at the entrance. 

Aaron has since opened a second business, a noodle shop named 50 Tales and plans to open a third one. While he's out trying to reinvigorate the Malaysian Chinese food scene, Thirty Seconds is being left in the loving care of his retired parents and brother. 

What started out as a hip new coffee place has now turned into a cozy and warm second home for the family (and stray cats judging by the bowls of cat food outside). Every aspect of the cafe feels lived in and shows us a glimpse of the family's personality. 

A piano sits at the corner when you walk in. If you're lucky you might catch a live performance by his brother or musician buddies. The menu offers keto friendly options, lovingly curated by mom who has attributed her weight loss to this diet. And at the end sits a large messy table, a gathering spot for the family to sit down after a long day while the grandkid plays. 

When asked what the secret was for Thirty Second's decade long success, the patriarch of the family Richard Phua had this to say,

""I don't think we're a success in the traditional sense, not monetarily. It's not really our goal at this point. As long as we have enough. All we ever wanted was for this place to be a welcoming space where friends can come and feel at home.""

After spending a whole morning with the Phua family, I'm inclined to say they did achieve their dream. And if anyone disagrees, I'll just quietly direct you to the many peaceful, napping cats outside. 

Next week we'll be visiting CREAM, the final cafe of December's Coffika series.

Chapter 1
Maverick Vasquez instilled fear in everyone within their elite circle. In the cutthroat world of business, he was ruthless and decisive—a man who crushed opponents without hesitation. Yet around Rosalie Harvey, he became strangely, profoundly gentle and caring.
Rosalie had grown up in the Vasquez's mansion, the daughter of their loyal household staff.
Ten years ago, her parents gave their lives to protect Maverick from a deadly threat. From that day forward, she became the one he cared for above all else.
He taught her piano, drove her to school, and over time, transformed the once-timid maid's daughter into the bold, radiant woman who would become his wife.
Three years earlier, Maverick's father had tried to marry him off to a wealthy heiress for business reasons, but Maverick rejected on the spot—simply because Rosalie had furrowed her brow in quiet unease. Shortly after, he married her in a lavish, city-stirring ceremony that silenced every doubter.
But no one could have foreseen that, in the third year of their marriage, he would force her to kneel in the pouring rain as punishment—all for the sake of a humble flower vendor, a woman who was also a single mother.
It was all because he believed the woman's son's persistent high fever was entirely Rosalie's doing.
The rain was icy and unforgiving. Instinctively, Rosalie cradled her lower abdomen.
Maverick didn't know she was two months pregnant.
When he saw the defiance in her eyes, Maverick's face hardened. With a curt lift of his hand, the bodyguards stepped forward, one on each side, ready to force her to her knees.
Rosalie twisted free, her voice trembling yet firm.
""Maverick, I conduct myself with absolute integrity. I would never, ever harm a child. I will not accept this punishment!""
She turned to leave, but his next words froze her in place.
""Rosie,"" he said, ""you have forgotten your place. You were nothing but a maid's daughter!""
Rosalie turned back in stunned disbelief.
Once, if anyone dared to sneer at her humble origins, Maverick would explode in fury and make them pay dearly.
Now, for the sake of another woman, he was dragging up her past just to break her.
At his signal, the bodyguards closed in again, gripping her arms with bruising force.
This time, Rosalie didn't fight.
She was forcefully brought down to her knees in the cold downpour.
***
It was three months ago when Rosalie first found out about Emmaline Aston.
A new photo had appeared in Maverick's private album: the graceful side profile of a woman arranging flowers.
There was a quiet serenity about her. Rosalie had always been fiery and outspoken, and the woman's softness was something Rosalie could never hope to possess.
At first, Rosalie brushed it off. But then she stumbled upon Maverick at the amusement park, laughing as he held a little boy on a carousel horse. Emmaline stood nearby, holding a bottle of water and a jacket, gazing at them with warm, tender eyes. It was the perfect picture of a happy family.
When Rosalie stormed over, Emmaline instinctively scooped the child into her arms and spoke in a soft, composed voice.
""Ms. Harvey, please don't misunderstand. My son just wanted to thank Rick for his help, so we asked him to join us.""
She even tugged gently at Maverick's sleeve, murmuring, ""Rick, Jas and I are heading home now. We don't want to upset Ms. Harvey."" 

Instead of shouting or showing off, Emmaline stepped back and acted thoughtfully. It made Rosalie look like the unreasonable shrew in comparison.
That night, Rosalie and Maverick's villa echoed with the crash of shattered glass and the tumble of overturned furniture.
When Rosalie confronted him, Maverick only offered a calm explanation.
""A few weeks ago, I collapsed in the street from a stomach flare-up. Emma found me and got me help. She's genuinely kind-hearted—she's not the kind of person you think. For years, she's raised her late sister's child as her own, enduring the stigma of being an unwed mother. I'm only repaying a debt. This has nothing to do with love.
""Rosie, she's no threat to you. Please, stop making a scene.""
Rosalie dropped the argument. She was ready to demand a divorce, but then came the unexpected discovery: she was pregnant.
Her constitution was delicate, making it extremely difficult for her to conceive. This child was, without a doubt, a miracle.
For the child's sake, she swallowed her pride and chose to endure, convincing herself that once Maverick settled his debt of gratitude, everything would return to the way it was.
But the situation spiraled beyond imagination. Maverick publicly claimed the boy as his own at the kindergarten. He canceled a ten-billion-dollar deal just to celebrate Emmaline's birthday.
Later, in an absurd display of devotion, he purchased a private island and staged a dramatic volcano eruption for Emmaline and her son.
After Rosalie caused a massive scene at the Vasquez Group headquarters, she ran straight into Emmaline's son outside. She did nothing, yet that very night, the child spiked a high fever and wouldn't stop crying.
To make matters worse, the surveillance cameras happened to malfunction, and there were no witnesses present, leaving her utterly unable to defend herself.
Maverick looked down at her, his gaze filled with nothing but bitter disappointment.
""I've told you time and again: Emma and Jas aren't a threat to you. Yet you still went after an innocent boy. Have I spoiled you so much over the years that you think you're above all consequences?""
Rosalie met his icy stare, opening her mouth to speak but suddenly losing all desire to explain.
Just then, his phone rang. He glanced at the screen and answered immediately, his voice shifting into the same urgent, tender tone she had once believed was meant for her alone.
""Emma, don't worry—I'm coming home right now.""
He ended the call and brushed past Rosalie without a pause. As he left, he tossed a final command over his shoulder.
""Leave her out in the rain for twelve hours. Not a minute less. You know what happens if you disobey.""
Rosalie watched him disappear into the storm, a sharp ache twisting deep in her chest.
Perhaps it was time for this beautiful dream, which had lasted for over a decade, to finally come to an end.
The rain poured through the night. As faint dawn light finally broke across the sky, Rosalie, her lips blue and fingers numb from the cold, dialed a number with shaking hands.
""Mr. Vasquez,"" she said quietly, ""I know you've always wanted Maverick to divorce me and marry that wealthy heiress. I agree.""
On the other end, Larson Vasquez—Maverick's father—let out a low, satisfied chuckle, as if he had been waiting for this call all along.
""Good girl. Tomorrow, someone will file the paperwork on your behalf. The process takes a month. After that, you'll receive generous compensation—enough to live comfortably for the rest of your life.
""But if Rick suspects anything, you won't get a penny, and you can forget about your parents resting in peace in my family's cemetery.""

Chapter 2
In the hospital corridor, Rosalie's face was ashen. She clung to the wall, slowly inching her way forward.

A series of sharp, wrenching spasms in her lower abdomen offered a silent, brutal reminder of the loss she had just endured.
The doctor's words echoed relentlessly in her mind.
""Ms. Harvey, given your delicate constitution, conception was always difficult. After this procedure, I'm afraid your chances in the future are...""
She squeezed her eyes shut and drew in a shaky breath.
The decision had torn her apart, but she didn't regret it.
From the moment Maverick punished her in the rain for Emmaline's sake, whatever they'd had was already shattered beyond repair.
Just as she was about to leave, a familiar sound drifted from around the corner.
Rosalie froze. Peering through the slightly ajar door of a nearby room, she saw Maverick down on one knee, pushing a toy car across the floor with a little boy.
Emmaline sat close by, carefully slicing an apple into neat little pieces and feeding them bites with a tender smile.
This was the exact scene Rosalie had dreamed of a thousand times.
However, when it came true, the woman in the picture wasn't her.
Outside the room, two nurses whispered as they passed.
""Mr. Vasquez is so devoted. Coming every day to keep them company... they really look like the perfect little family.""
""Yeah, Ms. Aston is so lucky to have such a handsome and devoted husband.""
Rosalie stood rooted to the spot, her nails digging crescents into her palms.
One of the nurses noticed her pallor and asked kindly, ""Ma'am, are you alright? Where is your family? Do you need me to contact them for you?""
Rosalie's gaze lingered on the warm, laughter-filled room for a moment longer before she answered in a flat, steady voice.
""No need. I don't have any family.""
She straightened her spine as best she could and forced herself toward the elevator.
Behind her, the nurses' murmurs faded.
""Doing that kind of surgery all alone... poor thing.""
Back at the villa, Rosalie began erasing every trace of Maverick from her life.
The jewelry he'd lavished on her over the years went straight into the trash.
Their old photos together were torn to shreds and reduced to ashes in the fireplace.
She ordered the staff to take down the massive wedding portrait that dominated the living room wall.
In the frame, beneath a breathtaking aurora borealis, she glowed in her white gown, beaming with pure joy while Maverick gazed at her with unmistakable tenderness.
Rosalie stared at it in silence for a long moment—then smashed the glass.
With a dagger, she scraped and slashed at his face in the photo until it was unrecognizable.
A maid hovered nearby, trying to protest.
""Mrs. Vasquez, that aurora shoot... You and Mr. Vasquez waited six whole months for the perfect night. It was a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle.""
Rosalie didn't pause. The blade screeched across the paper as she murmured, almost to herself, ""Even the most beautiful sights are fleeting.""
Just like the grand, city-shaking love they'd once paraded to the world, it also changed.
That evening, Maverick strode into the living room with Emmaline and her son in tow, his tone leaving no room for argument.
""Rosie, Emma's health isn't great, and raising a kid alone is wearing her down. There are plenty of staff here to help out. I've decided they'll stay for a while.""
Rosalie didn't even look up from what she was doing.
""Fine,"" she said simply.
Her quick, indifferent agreement caught him off guard.
He paused, a flicker of relief crossing his eyes.
Emmaline stepped forward gracefully, offering a soft, grateful smile.
""Ms. Harvey, thank you so much for letting us stay. I hope we're not too much of an inconvenience.""
She gently stroked her son's hair and coaxed him, ""Jas, sweetie, give the pretty lady your gift.""
The little boy—Jasper Aston—shyly held out a handmade cloth doll.
Rosalie hesitated, then reached to accept it.
The instant her fingers brushed the fabric, she gasped and yanked her hand back.
A thin line of blood welled up on her fingertip.
Looking closer, she saw a long needle deliberately hidden inside the doll's clothing.
Startled by her reaction, Jasper burst into loud, frightened sobs.
Emmaline's face drained of color. She pulled the boy protectively behind her, her voice trembling with tears.
""Ms. Harvey, I'm so sorry! He made it himself—the stitches must have been sloppy. He would never do it on purpose.""
Rosalie said nothing, reaching for a tissue to wipe the blood. But before she could, Maverick instinctively shielded Emmaline and the child, shoving Rosalie away with a harsh glare.
""What the hell do you think you're doing?
""It's just a tiny scratch. The kid didn't mean it. Why are you making such a big deal out of it?""
The force of his push sent her stumbling; her lower back slammed hard against the sharp corner of the coffee table.
A spike of pain made her vision swim. She gripped the edge to keep from collapsing.
She looked at the intense anxiety in Maverick's eyes and at Emmaline, who was clinging to her child with tears in her eyes. Suddenly, she felt an overwhelming sense of weariness.
Arguing, explaining, even raging at a man whose heart had already turned—it was all pointless.
She didn't want to become a pathetic joke.
Rosalie averted her gaze, slowly turned, and walked upstairs.
The next morning, while Rosalie was still half-asleep, a brutal grip yanked her from the bed.
Maverick's face was livid as he dragged her downstairs to the dining room.
The room was chaos: shattered dishes everywhere, Jasper covered in angry red hives, wailing hoarsely while Emmaline rocked him, tears soaking her cheeks as she tried to soothe him.
A young maid stood nearby, trembling violently.
Maverick fixed the girl with an icy stare that could freeze blood.
""Repeat what you just told me.""
The maid lifted her terrified eyes, glancing at Rosalie before stammering, ""It—it was Mrs. Vasquez. She was still upset about Jas accidentally pricking her yesterday. She... she made me put peanut butter in his milk. She knew that would trigger his allergy. She said... she said it would teach the boy a lesson...""


Chapter 3
Rosalie's heart slammed against her ribs, jolting her fully awake.
""What are you talking about? I had no idea he was allergic to peanuts...""
Maverick cut her off with a roar, his eyes blazing.
""We got the witnesses and evidence—everything's right here, and you still have the nerve to deny it?""
Emmaline wiped away her tears. She didn't raise her voice or argue; she simply looked at Rosalie with pleading, earnest eyes, her words soft but piercingly clear.
""Ms. Harvey, I truly apologize for intruding. Rick was only trying to be kind. But I understand—this is your home. We'll leave right now. We won't cause you any more trouble.""
She clutched the boy tightly, her voice breaking with emotion.
""I only beg you, if you're angry, take it out on me. He's just a child... a severe allergic reaction could kill him...""
With that, she scooped Jasper into her arms and turned to go, her gesture fragile yet resolute.
Maverick caught her wrist gently, his tone laced with tenderness and heartache.
""Emma, don't go. The one who should leave isn't you.""
He stepped protectively in front of her and the boy, then turned to Rosalie with a gaze sharp enough to cut glass.
""Rosalie, I thought you were just spoiled and hot-tempered. I never imagined you could be cruel enough to try to kill a child.""
Disappointment and raw pain flooded his eyes as he barked the order.
""Lock Mrs. Vasquez in the rear water cage. She won't be released until she admits her guilt!""
""It wasn't me!""
Rosalie wrenched free from the guards' grip, her stare locking onto the trembling maid with fierce intensity.
""You say I ordered you to do it. Fine—tell me exactly when and where. Did I say it to your face? Over the phone? Besides your word, what proof do you have?""
The maid stammered, unable to answer. A flicker of doubt crossed Maverick's face.
Just then, Emmaline drew a quiet, shaky breath and murmured, ""Rick, let it go. Jas is alright. Don't let us come between you two.""
The boy in her arms, however, began to cry even louder.
That fleeting hesitation in Maverick vanished, swallowed by fresh fury.
""Enough! What kind of act are you putting on now? Yesterday you seemed so docile—I actually thought you'd finally grown up. But you're still the same jealous, vicious woman. Who else could it possibly be? It must be you!""
He waved the bodyguards forward.
""Take her away. Without my direct order, no one releases her.""
As they dragged Rosalie out, she caught a final glimpse of Emmaline. She was leaning into Maverick's chest, and for a split second, as their eyes met, a glint of triumph flashed in Emmaline's.
The so-called water cage was a massive iron-barred enclosure sunk into a shallow pool, its floor writhing with hundreds of slick, coiling water snakes.
The guards shoved her inside without mercy and slammed the gate shut.
The moment the lock clicked, Rosalie's composure shattered. She screamed, scrambling to dodge the creatures, but the cramped space offered no escape.
Cold, sinuous bodies slithered over her ankles, up her calves; one even glided chillingly along her spine.
She let out a piercing scream, and yet, uncontrollably, her mind conjured a memory from three years ago.

In that moment, he had held her close, his voice filled with loving amusement.
""I love that fierce, fearless fire in you. With me spoiling you rotten, you can do anything you want.""
Now the very man who'd vowed to shield her from every storm was the one condemning her to this nightmare.
As Rosalie huddled, shivering in the corner, Emmaline and her son approached the cage.
Now, all pretense of her gentle, serene demeanor had vanished, replaced by a cold, mocking smirk.
The boy's innocent face twisted into something far too hateful for his age.
""Bad woman, why won't you just die? If you died, no one would take Daddy away from me.""
Emmaline stroked his hair soothingly.
""Patience, sweetheart. Look how tired she seems. Shall we help wake her up?""
She lifted a squirming cloth sack and tipped it over.
Dozens of frantic rats spilled into the enclosure, squealing as they scrambled over Rosalie's body.
The disturbance agitated the snakes; they struck and devoured the rodents right in front of her, jaws unhinging in a grotesque frenzy.
The thick stench of blood and filth hit Rosalie like a wave.
She retched violently, but after days without food or water, only bitter bile burned her throat.
Emmaline watched her heave with dark satisfaction, jealousy and hatred swirling in her eyes.
""Rosalie, you're just a servant's daughter. Why would you have had a chance to live in luxury all these years? If you could have it, why shouldn't I?""
Her voice cracked, almost tearful with resentment.
""Jasper and I have suffered more than you can imagine to survive this long. Rick is our only chance. I will not let you ruin it...""
Rosalie tried to speak, but weakness choked the words in her throat.
Emmaline's gaze was pure poison now, the victor savoring her prize.
""Enjoy your stay, Mrs. Vasquez.""
With that, she took Jasper's hand and walked away.
The cage fell deathly quiet again. Rosalie huddled smaller, the reek of blood and decay filling her lungs.
Her eyelids grew unbearably heavy, and darkness finally claimed her.
When consciousness returned, she was in a hospital bed.
Maverick stood beside her, brow furrowed. Seeing her open her eyes, his expression softened slightly.
""Rosie, Emma begged me repeatedly to let you out. She's too kind. From now on, if you behave and stop these tantrums, I won't punish you again.""
At the mention of Emmaline's name, the wicked image of her face, gleefully tipping rats into the cage, flashed vividly in Rosalie's mind.
She pulled her mouth into a sarcastic grimace, her voice a dry, rasping whisper.
""Begged for me? She wanted me dead in there.""
Maverick's patience snapped. He cut her off with a thunderous voice, anger replacing any trace of concern.
""Rosalie! Seven days in the water cage and you still haven't learned a thing. That jealousy of yours—it's carved into your bones!""
He straightened, looking down at her with undisguised disgust, his tone final and frigid.
""Since you feel no remorse, you'll move to the attic today. Without my permission, you are not to set foot in the main house again.""
He strode to the door, hand on the knob, then paused. Glancing back, he delivered one last chilling warning.
""Everything I've given you, Rosalie, I can take away just as easily. I won't tolerate another incident like this.""


Chapter 4
The door slammed shut with a resounding thud.
A delicate, brittle laugh escaped Rosalie's lips, yet tears streamed down her face, splattering onto the back of her hand.
When she was sixteen, she'd casually mentioned wanting to feel like a princess—just once.
Maverick had subsequently spent six months personally transforming that very attic into a castle.
She could still picture that birthday so vividly: he'd blindfolded her, led her up the stairs, and pushed open the door.
Gowns in every shade shimmered along the walls in the sunlight. A glittering crystal chandelier hung overhead, and delicate carved bed curtains fluttered around a four-poster fit for royalty. It was all so breathtakingly perfect, like stepping into a dream.
The teenage Maverick had leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, smiling as he extended a hand.
""Princess Rosie,"" he'd said, ""welcome home. This is your castle now—and I'm your knight, sworn to you forever.""
That same castle, once a monument to his love, had become her prison.
After moving into the attic, Rosalie rarely left. She stayed curled up inside, day after day, never venturing out.
She kept a calendar pinned in plain sight, crossing off each date with a deliberate stroke.
Often she sat by the window, gazing toward the main house.
The lights there burned bright and warm. Emmaline would chase Jasper through the gardens, their laughter floating across the grounds.

The rose bushes Rosalie had tended so lovingly—her absolute favorites—had all been ripped out and replaced with tulips.
The old wooden swing Maverick had built for her was now Emmaline and Jasper's favorite spot.
When he came home from work, he'd scoop the boy high into the air, their delighted voices carrying clearly to her window.
They looked perfectly happy, just like a perfect little family.
Three days later, there was a high-profile business gala.
For once, Maverick brought Rosalie along—though Emmaline attended too, listed as his ""assistant.""
Halfway through the evening, a drunken guest sidled up to Maverick with a sleazy smirk.
""I hear Mr. Vasquez has developed a new taste lately. He's completely smitten with the unwed mother, Ms. Aston, isn't he?""
The room fell deathly silent.
Every eye turned to Emmaline—some curious, many judgmental.
""Well, that explains the cozy vibes. So that assistant is actually Mr. Vasquez's mistress.""
""You haven't heard? Apparently, she had the kid right after turning eighteen. Who'd have guessed?""
""Bringing a child along and still climbing the ladder—now that takes some serious skill.""
Emmaline's face went chalk-white; her eyes filled instantly, and she looked helplessly at Maverick.
He slammed his glass to the floor, shards exploding across the marble.
In one swift motion, he seized the man by the collar and drove a brutal fist into his face, again and again, until the idiot crumpled.
Only then did Maverick release him. He swept the room with a lethal glare.
""Let me make this crystal clear: Emma is my woman, and her son is my son. If anyone dares to utter one more word of gossip, they will be considered as offending the whole Vasquez family!""
Rosalie stood frozen, a bitter laugh trapped in her throat.
Was Maverick going to call this ""repayment of gratitude"" too? Was he going to claim this had nothing to do with love?
The second the words left his mouth, every gaze in the room swiveled to Rosalie.
Where once those eyes had held envy and admiration, now they brimmed with pity and thinly veiled scorn.
The girl who had once been spoiled to the heavens was now, undeniably, the biggest joke in the room.
Rosalie said nothing. She simply tightened her grip on her wine glass until her knuckles whitened.
The gala ended in a strained, awkward dispersal.
On the drive back to the Vasquez's mansion, the car was filled with a chilling silence.
Maverick's face was stormy; Emmaline huddled against him, crying softly.
As the car finally stopped, Rosalie moved to step out, only to be violently yanked from the vehicle by Maverick.


She stumbled to regain her footing, and then a blistering slap connected sharply with her cheek.
Fury blazed in his eyes.
""Rosalie, I warned you—this kind of thing will not happen again!""
She clutched her burning cheek, staring at him in stunned disbelief.
""Maverick, have you lost your mind? What does any of this have to do with...""
He cut her off with a snarl.
""Who else but you?
""Did you think ruining their reputations would change anything? Let me tell you something—you're delusional!""
Without another glance at her, he turned to the butler.
""Notify the lawyers. Tomorrow, Jas is to be officially adopted under my name. From today forward, everything for Emma will be arranged to the exact standard of Mrs. Vasquez.""
He paused, his gaze landing on Rosalie like a blade.
""I told you before: anything I give, I can take away.""
He closed his eyes briefly, then spoke with iron resolve.
""Since you refuse to learn your place, you'll move to the servants' quarters tonight. It's time you learned some manners. From now on, you will personally attend to Emma and Jas's daily needs.""
Rosalie stared at the man she'd loved for an entire decade, a faint, sardonic curve touching her lips.
It was almost comical.
He wouldn't even bother to investigate—just slapped another baseless accusation on her without a second thought.
It seemed her ten years of devotion hadn't earned her even a shred of trust.
She looked at him one last time.
Her eyes were calm, eerily serene.
She didn't argue, didn't cry. She simply straightened her spine, picked up the few belongings she had, and walked step by step back to the place where she had grown up as a child.
Maverick moved quickly. By the next day, the lawyers had completed everything.
Jasper Aston was now officially a Vasquez—Maverick's sole, recognized son.
That same afternoon, Maverick flew overseas for an urgent acquisition deal and was gone for three days.
The very day he left, Emmaline dropped every pretense.
At dinner, she assumed the airs of the lady of the house, seating herself grandly at the head of the table.
That seat had once belonged exclusively to Rosalie.
Halfway through the meal, Emmaline let out a sudden, theatrical gasp.
Her soup mug ""slipped,"" shattering precisely at Rosalie's feet in a spray of hot liquid and jagged porcelain.
Servants moved to clean it, but she raised a hand to stop them.
She arched a brow, lips curving into a triumphant smirk as she looked at Rosalie standing quietly to the side.
""Rosalie,"" she said sweetly, ""you handle this.""


Chapter 5
""Rick specifically told you to take care of Jas and me personally,"" Emmaline said, her voice dripping with provocation. ""Surely you're not going to mess up something this small?""
Rosalie's fingertips trembled. She drew a deep, steadying breath, then silently took the rag and knelt to clean the mess.
But just as she reached for the jagged shards, Emmaline gave Jasper a subtle nudge. The boy understood instantly. He tiptoed behind Rosalie and shoved her hard.
""Ah!""
Rosalie was thrown forward, completely unprepared. Her palms and knees crashed painfully onto the broken porcelain.
A searing jolt of pain shot through her body, and blood instantly stained the marble floor.
She gasped sharply, fury surging to her head. Pushing herself up, she grabbed Jasper's wrist, ready to discipline him.
Emmaline screamed and rushed forward, pulling the boy behind her, her fingernails nearly scratching Rosalie's face.
""You bitch! What do you think you're doing?
""If anything happens to Jas, do you really think Rick will let you off? Haven't you had enough of the water cage yet?"" Emmaline hissed, venom lacing every word.
The mention of the water cage hit her like a physical blow.
Rosalie's arm froze mid-air.
She stared at Emmaline's smug, fearless expression and slowly lowered her hand.
Only five days remained until the deadline. She couldn't risk any more trouble.
Seeing Rosalie yield, a flash of triumph lit Emmaline's eyes.
She stroked Jasper's hair tenderly and cooed, ""Don't be scared, sweetheart. You're the only little heir to the Vasquez family now. No one would dare lay a finger on you.""
Then she glanced at Rosalie's bleeding hands and snapped, ""What are you waiting for? Clean this up properly, then go draw my bath.""
Jasper peeked out from behind her, making a face at Rosalie.
""Bad woman, when Daddy gets back, I'll make him lock you in the snake cage again.""
Rosalie gritted her teeth against the throbbing pain, wiping the stains inch by agonizing inch.
Anna Harris, the elderly maid who had watched Rosalie grow up, couldn't bear it any longer.
With tears in her eyes, she hurried forward and whispered, ""Mrs. Vasquez, your hands are hurt. Let me do it.""
That instinctive ""Mrs. Vasquez"" reached Emmaline's ears loud and clear.
Her face darkened instantly. She rushed forward and delivered several vicious slaps across Anna's face.
The sharp cracks echoed through the silent dining room.
""You old hag!"" Emmaline screeched.
""Who gave you permission to call her Mrs. Vasquez? Have you gone blind? Don't you know who runs this house now—who the future lady of the manor will be?""
With that, she raised her hand again.
""Enough!""
Rosalie shot to her feet, her blood-slick fingers clamping around Emmaline's wrist with surprising strength.
""Emmaline, Anna has served the Vasquez family for thirty years. Even Maverick shows her respect. Who the hell do you think you are to raise a hand against her?""
Rosalie stepped closer, her eyes radiating an intimidating authority that was startlingly similar to Maverick's own.
""If you push me too far, I won't hesitate to drag you down with me. Care to guess who Maverick would believe—you, the outsider, or the people who've stood by him for years?""
Emmaline was momentarily stunned into silence by Rosalie's sudden, powerful aura. She yanked her wrist free with an embarrassed glare but didn't dare strike again.
Instead, she redirected her wrath toward the rest of the staff.
""Get over here, all of you!""
The servants huddled together nervously. Emmaline gripped Jasper's hand and pointed at Rosalie and Anna.
""From now on, there is only one Mrs. Vasquez in this house—me. Anyone who forgets their place or whispers a word to Rick will vanish without a trace. I have plenty of ways to make that happen.""

With a final cold huff, she gave a cold snort, tugged Jasper, and swept out of the room.
The day before the divorce papers were finalized, Maverick returned from his trip.
As the head butler briefed him, he instinctively referred to Emmaline as ""Mrs. Vasquez.""
Maverick stopped dead, his sharp gaze slicing toward Emmaline.
""Mrs. Vasquez?""
Before Rosalie could speak, Emmaline pressed herself into his arms, voice trembling with perfectly timed grievance and fear.
""Rick, don't blame Ms. Harvey. It's probably my fault—I must have upset her somehow. She was furious a couple of days ago and threatened everyone that they must call me that. She even said... she said she was tired of being Mrs. Vasquez...""
Maverick's eyes snapped to Rosalie, the words grinding out through clenched teeth.
""Tired of it?""
Rosalie gazed out the window at the sinking sun.
Tonight, she would finally be free. Suddenly, arguing felt utterly pointless.
She met his furious stare calmly and even managed a soft, almost amused smile.
""Yes. Tired of it?""
Maverick pulled Emmaline closer.
""Fine! Just perfect!
""Looks like three days weren't enough to teach you a lesson. Instead, you've convinced yourself the title belongs to you forever.
""If you don't want it, then someone else can have it.""
That very evening, he threw a lavish banquet.
Maverick raised his glass before the assembled guests, his voice carrying through the grand hall.
""I'd like to take this opportunity to announce that, from this day forward, the future lady of the Vasquez family will be Emma—and Emma alone.""
Emmaline, adorned with the Vasquez family's ancestral emerald jewelry, accepted congratulations from the guests.
At the same time, countless mocking glances pinned Rosalie in her quiet corner.
""I heard the former one was a servant's daughter. Clearly, she just doesn't deserve that title.""
""No wonder Mr. Vasquez is moving on. That kind of background was never fit for the upper echelon.""
Guests who once fawned over her now ""accidentally"" jostled her tray.
Red wine soaked through her thin dress. Before she could react, someone shoved her hard from behind.
She stumbled forward and crashed into the towering champagne flute pyramid.
Crystal shattered in a deafening cascade; icy wine drenched her from head to toe.
Amid the ripple of cruel laughter, Maverick spared her a single indifferent glance—then tenderly slipped a diamond ring onto Emmaline's finger.
Emmaline threw herself into his arms, eyes shining with tears, but when she looked toward Rosalie, pure triumph gleamed there.
Just then, Larson's secretary appeared discreetly at Rosalie's side.
Rosalie slipped away unnoticed, following him into the shadowed side entrance.
Rosalie discreetly followed him away from the crowd. In the shadow of a side door, the secretary handed her a divorce certificate and a sealed check.
""The car's waiting at the back gate. Mr. Larson Vasquez insists you leave tonight.""
Rosalie wiped the wine from her face, took the documents without hesitation, and stepped resolutely into the cool embrace of the night.

1pw22im,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Potential-Tax7513/comments/1pw22im/what_makes_mbr_membranes_essential_for_wastewater/,What Makes MBR Membranes Essential for Wastewater Treatment?,"The global wastewater industry is undergoing a significant revolution, triggered by tighter environmental standards, water shortages, and increased demand for reuse-ready effluent. MBR membranes have become a key technology in modern wastewater treatment in this changing environment.

[Membrane Bioreactor](https://oxymotec.com/product/mabr-membrane-aerated-biofilm-reactor/) (MBR) systems provide biological treatment combined with high-tech membrane filtration, delivering effluent quality that is consistent and far superior to traditional methods.  MBR membranes are becoming the standard in both municipal and industrial applications due to their compact size, high efficiency, and ability to meet strict discharge requirements.

# What Are MBR Membranes?

# Definition and Working Principle

MBR membranes are ultrafiltration or microfiltration membranes integrated into a biological treatment process. They mechanically separate treated water from biomass, eliminating the need for secondary clarifiers.

# Key Components of an MBR System

An MBR system contains a biological treatment tank in which useful bacteria decompose waste and organic matter in the water. This action is a purification process of the water that takes place in a natural manner.

Subsequently, the water is taken through a membrane filtration unit which isolates clean water and solids and sludge. An aeration system supplies air to support bacterial activity and keep the membranes clean, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

# Types of MBR Membranes

**Hollow Fiber Membranes –** Hollow fiber membranes consist of numerous small and thin tubes. They have the ability to wash a huge amount of water at a small place, and tend to be less expensive.

**Flat sheet Membranes –** Flat sheet membranes consist of flat plates. They are powerful and simple to clean hence, easy to use.

**Tubular Membranes –**Tubular membranes are thicker tubes. They can treat heavily contaminated industrial wastewater without difficulty.

# How MBR Membranes Work in Wastewater Treatment

MBR technology combines biological degradation with membrane separation into a unified streamlined process. Microorganisms decompose organic pollutants and the membrane becomes a physical barrier that retains suspended solids and pathogens.

**Compared to conventional activated sludge systems, MBR membranes:**

* Do away with sludge settling problems.
* Hold increased mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS).
* Provide consistent performance at changing loads.

(Think of it like using a fine coffee filter—producing cleaner water without allowing the grounds to settle.)

# Key Features That Make MBR Membranes Essential

# Superior Effluent Quality

MBR membranes produce very clean treated water. They eliminate the small particles, dirt, and turbidity in wastewater, as well as decrease pathogenic bacteria. This assists in achieving the discharge regulations of the treated water and makes it reusable.

# Compact System Design

MBR systems are of small sizes as opposed to traditional treatment plants. They can treat the same volume of water with a very small area, and hence they are applicable in cities and places with little space.

# High Operational Efficiency

These systems are effective because they do not lose efficiency even with increased waste. They remain steady even when there is a sudden change in the water flow or the level of pollution.

# Water Reuse & Sustainability

The MBR membranes enable the reuse of treated water in factories, landscapes, or any other application. This aids in the conservation of freshwater and in the management of water in a friendly way to the environment.

# Reduced Sludge Production

MBR systems give less sludge as compared to traditional systems. This will reduce the wastage to deal with and the cost of sludge treatment and disposal.

# Advantages of MBR Membranes Over Conventional Technologies

The MBR membranes are more effective than the conventional wastewater systems. The system is more effective and simpler because it does not require additional settling tanks, producing very clean water.

The systems also become easier to manage since they employ automatic monitoring and management systems. This increases their dependability and consistency, hence they can continue to work adequately even when their water conditions vary.

# Applications of MBR Membranes in Wastewater Treatment

MBR membranes are widely used in:

* Municipal Wastewater treatment facilities.
* Industrial waste (pharmaceutical, textile, food & beverage, chemical)
* Packaged distributed treatment systems.
* Reuse of water, zero liquid discharge (ZLD).

Most of the facilities incorporate MBR membranes in combination with sophisticated systems like tertiary treatment units and reuse polishing solutions to achieve optimal effectiveness.

# Factors to Consider When Choosing MBR Membranes

When selecting MBR membranes, key factors include:

* Membrane material (PVDF, PES, etc.)
* Pore size and permeability
* Cleaning frequency and Fouling resistance.
* Projected life and overall cost of operation.

Selecting the appropriate membrane ensures long-term operation and reduced lifecycle costs.

# Challenges and Limitations of MBR Membranes

Despite their advantages, MBR membranes face certain challenges:

* MBR membranes may occasionally become clogged by dirt and waste that adheres to them. This may slow the system down, and thus it is required to be cleaned regularly.
* Another issue is the higher initial cost. Compared to the conventional systems, MBR systems are expensive to install due to the use of special components. In the long run, they can save money because they perform better and require less space.
* The MBR systems also consume a higher amount of electricity, which is primarily used to introduce air that cleans the water and the membranes. New designs are assisting to cut this power consumption.
* Despite these concerns, current advances are ensuring that MBR systems are more user-friendly, reliable, and can be used in the long term.

# Future Trends in MBR Membrane Technology

The future of MBR membrane technology aims to simplify processes and make wastewater treatment more reliable. The new anti-fouling membranes are designed to become clogged less, hence they require less cleaning, and they have longer durability. This implies that there will be fewer issues among operators, and maintenance will be reduced in the long run.

Moreover, energy-efficient aeration systems and intelligent monitoring devices are making plants consume less energy and operate more efficiently. Systems with AI and automated controls can detect problems early and resolve them before they escalate. These are making MBR systems easier to manage, cost-effective, and friendlier to the environment.

# Conclusion

The [MBR membranes](https://oxymotec.com) in the modern environment of regulation and sustainability are essential in the provision of quality treated water with minimal footprint and optimum efficiency. They will address wastewater treatment challenges, providing superior effluent quality and long-term operational cost savings.

With enhanced MBR solutions of Oxymo Tech., cities and industries are able to attain compliance, sustainability, and cost effectiveness, both in the present and over the decades.

# FAQs

(This is semi relevant to the story). So a few days ago me and (k) were getting ready for school and she pulled out about 5 dollars and asked me to get her gum and return her change (which I did) BUT SHE DID NOT tell me she wanted mint, so I got to the gum at the store and realized she did not tell me which one, so I grabbed the one I usually get (which is watermelon) which she asks me for mine ALL THE TIME so I know she likes it anyway I couldn't text her because she was in class otherwise that would have been my first thought. So I got back to school and walked to the band room where she was in choir to give her the gum because it was attached to my lunch room, I handed her the gum and she flipped out at me but realizing we were in public she stopped before raising her voice and began yelling at me when we got home. Here is how our conversation went (for the record it won't let me put curse words in this so it will just be the first letter)
K: WHY THE F WOULD YOU GET ME THIS
M: because you asked for gum and water your language 
K: BUT WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU GET THIS ONE
M: because you didn't tell me which one so I grabbed the one I knew you liked 
K: BUT I WANTED MINT
M: I'm srry but you did not ask for mint
Then we dropped it for like 2 weeks and then on Christmas eve she brought it up again when we were in the car on the way to my great grandparents as we do every Christmas eve and this was our conversation in the car we will use (d) for my aunt, (p) for my grandma (L) (w) and (n) for my cousins k and n were having a conversation in the back 
K: and she got watermelon 
M: what
K: my gum you got watermelon instead of mint
N: why would you do that 
M: because she didn't tell me which to get
L: I don't blame you I would perfer watermelon over mint
W: ya definitely 
D: well most people perfer mint
G: should this really be an argument 
So I guess I just need to know if I would be the bad apple for getting k watermelon instead if mint so aitba

1pw1ye6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1pw1ye6/which_vr_headset_is_best_for_small_spaces/,Which VR headset is best for small spaces?,"Finding the right VR headset for your small apartment or cramped room can be tricky. You don't want to punch your wall or knock over your coffee table while playing games. The good news is that some headsets work way better in tight spaces than others.

**Standalone Headsets Are Your Best Friend**

When you're dealing with limited room, standalone VR headsets are usually the smartest choice. These don't need external sensors or base stations that take up floor space. You just put on the headset and start playing. The Meta Quest series leads this category, with built-in tracking that works in spaces as small as 3 feet by 3 feet.

**Room-Scale vs Stationary VR**

Most modern VR headsets let you choose between room-scale and stationary modes. If your space is super tight, stationary VR might be perfect for you. You can sit in a chair or stand in one spot without moving around much. This works great for racing games, puzzle games, or virtual movie watching.

**What About Tracking Systems?**

Inside-out tracking is what you want for small spaces. This means the cameras are on the headset itself, not mounted on your walls. You won't need to set up lighthouse base stations or deal with external sensors that eat up precious room.

The best VR headsets for cramped quarters include the Meta Quest 2, Quest 3, and PICO 4. These all use inside-out tracking and work well in compact areas. [Check out these top-rated VR options](https://athomewave.com/vr-headset) to see which one fits your space and budget.

**Safety Features Matter**

Look for headsets with good guardian systems or play area boundaries. These virtual walls pop up when you get too close to real objects. Some headsets even have pass-through cameras that let you see your actual room while wearing the headset.

**Games That Work in Small Spaces**

Not all VR games need you to run around. Seated experiences, puzzle games, and simulation games work perfectly in tiny rooms. Beat Saber can work in a 6x6 foot space if you're careful with your arm movements.

**Quick Setup Tips**

Clear out breakable items before you start. Move chairs, lamps, and anything fragile to another room. A small rug can help you feel where the center of your play area is without looking.

The bottom line is that you don't need a huge room to enjoy virtual reality. With the right headset and some smart setup choices, even studio apartment dwellers can have amazing VR experiences.

English is not my main language so apologies for any mistake or wording inconsistency.


I've had the intention of seeking a proper diagnosis for a while, but my life has been spiraling into chaos for the past year and I finally have the resolve to do it.


So last year in September, I burned out. I was working an office job, quite successfully even, on a path to a decent career despite obvious flaws in my work. Basically, if I don't want to do something, I won't do it, very stubborn and I'm very inconsistent - but I always deliver outstanding work in stuff that really matter. People called me a weirdo, but in a good way. If a problem needed a fresh perspective, I was often called. My input was valued. As long as management was understanding towards me.


Until they weren't.


All it took was 2 months, to end a 9 years career in the same company. I now realize I stayed that long because I was afraid to find another company that wouldn't be as accepting of my flaws, but anyway. 


I had a massive breakdown. I mean ""one day you get into your car and loose your grip on rationality so hard you become convinced that crashing your car is your escape"" breakdown. I don't even want to think about where I'd be if I didn't have any passengers that day, because that's what stopped me. I felt I had no right to take them down with me, so I held. We arrived to the party 2 hours later (we were going to a weekend getaway with friends). I drank myself to oblivion. Been doing it a lot lately. Came down the next morning crying. My friends practically forced me to call my doctor.


After that I spent 3 months in sick leave, back to work for 3 months, another breakdown and back to sick leave again, until I was deemed unfit to go back to this company and ultimately fired. 


... Which I LOVE. I'm finally free. I can do whatever the hell I want with my life. Because it's a health issue, I have compensation money (it won't last though). One day I'll work again but something entirely different, that I can do and enjoy. I don't care anymore about money or career. I never really did, I just did what was expected of me.


Because also, I stopped masking and I love the ""new"" me. First because I didn't have any energy left to mask, and now I'm doing better but I don't want to go back. I've ended a few friendships but realized that I already wasn't masking with most of my friends. We've all gone through some shit in the past year and our sense of community is now stronger than ever (I suspect most of them are neurodivergent). We're all in our 30s, all struggling in life, none of us have kids.


And I don't drink alcohol anymore. Pre-burnout, I had developed a habit of quieting my inner voice by drinking a lot. Stopped me from thinking for a bit. Allowed me to sleep. I've stopped drinking entirely now. My only vice left is coffee.


That's the good part. 


The bad part is, with freedom comes chaos and I feel like work gave me structure. Now that's gone and everything I was already struggling with is unravelling. It was already there, but either I was forced to function to a degree, either I thought I was exhausted from work and that's why I wasn't functioning like a proper adult at home.


That's where I am now. One day, I woke up, the house was a mess, I was a mess, but I could not bring myself to do anything about it. I don't linger in bed because my dog wouldn't let me, but once I've gotten out of bed, fed the dog and let her in the garden, I crash down on the couch. Usually I need a few hours to muster the courage to clean up a bit. Or if I really can't, I at least switch to a hobby I enjoy. 


But this particular day I couldn't. I hated it. I hated the mess, I was triggered by the dirt. My skin was itchy, my teeth begged to be brushed, but I just couldn't. Instead I spent all day crying on the couch. Until I grabbed my phone, looked for a neuro-psychologist and booked an appointment. 


I went. That was back in November. The first appointment was good, good feeling and all that. We didn't mention ADHD or autism but I said not being able to function was my main issue. He gave me a few personality tests, to complete it and to use to understand me better for next session. 


But next session is in March. His rates are fairly cheap AND covered by Social Security, that's probably why he's overbooked. I'm still unemployed, so, this is still a good option. I know from his website that he's well equipped to treat patient with ADHD but also burnout, depression, and there's a link to an article about neurodivergent women specifically, so I'm quite confident I will make some progress.


(Even if I'm actually NOT AuDHD ? I'm a bit terrified there but oh well. I'll make progress either way. I originally wanted to include why I relate to being AuDHD but the post is already really long as it is)


Anyway, until March, I still have days where I cannot do anything besides crying on the couch, wanting to do stuff but cannot bring myself to. Today is one of them. I look at the coffee table, it's a mess as always, I don't want to get up because I'll see the mess in the kitchen. I want to be clean, I feel good when I'm fresh out of the shower, skincare done etc but I can't get up to go to the bathroom. I want my daily dose of coffee so badly. It's one of those days. Probably because I'm exhausted from Christmas.


Sorry for the long post, I wanted to be more concise. 


I come to you now for tips or advice. I've moved my skincare and teethcare products in the shower, which work wonders because it's now one task instead of several ones. I also put some music on, I only vibe with quick beat electronic repetitive music so I get up naturally when I hear it, and I can clean up a bit. 


But for the really low days, how do you cope ? What do you do ? I have an amazing partner who takes care of me, encourages me, praises me for doing the smallest stuff around the house, feeds me, brings me my coffee, but he's also got some shit to deal with and I don't want to overburden him. 


I feel like I've done some big progress on my own since burning out, with my partner and my community. I've also opened up to the rest of my family, I think by brother has ADHD and my sister and father are autistics and I think I'm both. No one is officially diagnosed. Talking openly about it helps, my mom is a real ally, but also unravels the issue of having been raised by a very rigid dad. And I mean rigid, not strict like strict parents typically are, but that's a whole other topic.

If you are searching **dietitian near me** because your weight is not reducing, your energy is low, and you feel bloated often, thyroid could be one reason. Many people also look for **best dietitian near me** and [**nutritionists near me**](https://aakarlife.com/) because they want a clear plan that works with thyroid, not against it.

In this Aakarlife blog, you will get a simple, easy-to-follow guide. You will learn what to eat, what to avoid, and a 28-day routine that supports **diet plans for weight loss** and a practical **weight loss diet**. The language is simple. Paragraphs are short. And the plan is realistic.

Let’s start.



# Why Thyroid Makes Weight Loss Slow

Thyroid issues can affect your metabolism. Because of this, many people feel:

* Slow weight loss
* Belly fat and bloating
* Tiredness even after rest
* Mood changes
* Hair fall
* Sugar cravings

So, even if you eat less, weight may not reduce quickly. That’s why a **dietitian near me** plan helps. It brings structure and balance.



# Dietitian Near Me: The Goal of a Thyroid Weight Loss Diet

A thyroid-friendly **weight loss diet** is not a crash diet. The goal is to:

* Improve energy
* Reduce bloating
* Control cravings
* Support metabolism with protein and fiber
* Create a routine you can follow daily

Therefore, fat loss becomes steady.



# Dietitian vs Nutritionist for Thyroid: Who Helps More?

Many people search [**nutritionists near me**](https://aakarlife.com/) and **dietitian near me** together. Both can guide you. However, for thyroid and weight management, a dietitian is often better because they provide more structured planning and tracking.

If you want the **best dietitian near me**, choose someone who listens, tracks weekly, and adjusts the plan.



# Dietitian Near Me Thyroid Plan: 5 Simple Food Rules

These are common rules dietitians use for thyroid-friendly fat loss.

# Rule 1: Protein in Every Main Meal

Protein keeps you full. It also helps reduce cravings.

**Easy protein options:**  
Dal, sprouts, paneer, curd, eggs, chicken, fish, tofu.

# Rule 2: Don’t Skip Breakfast

Skipping breakfast often increases cravings later. So start your day with a proper meal.

# Rule 3: Add Fiber Daily

Fiber helps digestion and reduces constipation, which many thyroid people face.

**Fiber sources:**  
Salad, vegetables, fruits, seeds, whole grains.

# Rule 4: Limit Sugar and Packaged Snacks

Packaged foods can increase cravings and water retention. Therefore, belly bloating increases.

# Rule 5: Keep Dinner Light and Early

Late, heavy dinners can slow digestion. Also, sleep becomes poor.



# The Aakarlife 28-Day Diet Plans for Weight Loss (Thyroid-Friendly)

This plan is divided into 4 simple weeks. Each week builds a habit. So it feels easy.

# Week 1 (Days 1–7): Reset Routine + Reduce Bloating

# Week 4 (Days 22–28): Build Consistency

Focus:

* Weekend control

She has scars on her legs and arms that she did. and she told me that she did one night stand 5 times or so JUST to clear her head which is absurd imo. days passed she came to my place again and this time she said she was raped 1.5 months ago i didnt know what to say, İ my self sexually abused by my brother when i was too young. Thats not the case she doesnt tell me who did it and other details . She said shes trying to heal from the past. İn conclusion i kinda didnt trust her about the things she told me because i am pretty paranoiac. i too suffer from depression so i was afraid. afraid that she might drag me down with herself i am always suicidal. and as for my paranoia i feel like she will get me into trouble as she has 2 stalkers. Last time we meet i told her that i really like her but i cannot continue doing this bcz i had to take care of myself. she said that i am a coward and paranoiac which both are true.

1pw1kzp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw1kzp,"STUB FROTH: DAILY DRIP // Volume 360 // December 26, 2025 — Santa Gets Audited","*The North Pole Meets Excel*

*By Stub Froth — December 26, 2025* 

December 26 is when Christmas sobers up.

The lights are still on, but nobody’s looking at them. The living room looks like a shipping depot after a small war. The cookies are gone. The batteries are dead. And every adult in the house is standing there with cold coffee thinking the same dangerous thought:

*What did all this actually cost?*

Congratulations. You’ve entered the post-holiday audit.

Which means it’s finally time to talk about Santa Claus — not the myth, the operation.

Because if Santa were real in 2025, he wouldn’t live at the North Pole. He’d be headquartered in a climate-controlled office park with a mission statement, a DEI committee, and a CFO who hasn’t smiled since Reagan.

*“Every miracle dies the moment someone opens Excel.” — Stub Froth*

Let’s start with production.

Millions of toys don’t just appear. That’s labor. Elf labor. And unless the North Pole is running the last unregulated fantasy sweatshop, those elves want salaries, benefits, time off, and probably ergonomic workstations for all that hammering.

You’re not running a workshop.  
You’re running a frozen megafactory with pointy ears.

Then there’s distribution.

One night. Every chimney. No routing errors. No missed addresses. No porch pirates. No delayed sleighs due to weather or FAA clearance.

Amazon needs a year, a fleet of jets, and half the global cloud to pull off Christmas.

Santa does it in five hours with flying deer and vibes.

*“If Santa were efficient, he’d already be Amazon — and nobody would sing about him.” — Stub Froth*

Speaking of deer.

You think jet fuel is expensive? Try feeding, housing, grooming, and insuring magical reindeer that only work one night a year and glow in the dark.

That’s not logistics.  
That’s a very festive financial mistake.

But the real budget killer? Surveillance.

Santa doesn’t just deliver. He monitors.

He sees you when you’re sleeping.  
He knows when you’re awake.

Which in adult language means: mass data collection, behavioral scoring, file storage, threat assessment, and some poor intern flagging “suspicious vibes” in suburban Michigan.

That’s not Christmas.  
That’s a holiday-themed intelligence agency.

*“Even Santa needs a warrant once you stop pretending he’s magic.” — Stub Froth*

Add it up — labor, factories, sleigh fleets, reindeer care, global logistics, chimney liability insurance, red suit dry cleaning — and you’re staring at a number so obscene it makes federal budgets look like stocking stuffers.

At which point the adult brain kicks in and says:  
This is impossible.  
This is ridiculous.  
This doesn’t scale.

Exactly.

That’s why it worked.

Because Santa was never built to make sense.  
He was built to make wonder.

No kid ever asked about elf payroll.  
No child worried about reindeer maintenance costs.  
No one lay awake thinking about North Pole zoning permits.

They just believed.

*“Magic doesn’t run on money. It runs on agreement.” — Stub Froth*

Agreement that for one night, generosity beats logic.  
That gifts appear without invoices.  
That joy doesn’t need a business model.

But here we are, December 26, stepping over cardboard and plastic ties, already dragging Santa into accounting software.

Because we do this to everything.

We optimize the holidays.  
We hack happiness.  
We quantify memories.  
We demand that even magic justify its ROI.

Sure, efficiency is great. Systems are useful. Spreadsheets have their place.

But Christmas never *worked*.  
It *happened*.

*“Nothing terrifies a spreadsheet more than joy it can’t explain.” — Stub Froth*

That’s why Santa survives every audit. Not because the numbers add up — they never will — but because we keep wanting him to be true.

Not for the toys.  
For the idea that someone gives without billing.  
That something good shows up just because it can.

So today, don’t fix it.  
Don’t total it.  
Don’t optimize it.

Throw away the receipts.  
Break down the boxes.  
Drink whatever coffee is left.

And let Santa keep running the most financially irresponsible operation in human history.

Because the day you make him profitable,  
he’s not Santa anymore.

*“The day Santa turns a profit is the day the magic files for bankruptcy.” — Stub Froth*

Welcome back to the real world.

Merry Christmas, 2025.

I sent this picture to my best friend who said it looked like a generic Secret Santa haul. 

These are the gifts from my 3 adult sons and 1 husband. I house them all. I am the sole provider. The sons have jobs. Husband doesn't. 

My eldest, got me all the bath and sleep kits (in large, i am a size small) from a drug store and a pink Bills shirt. Love the Bills, hate pink. Dont one one pink anything. My middle got me a mug warmer because I drink 1 cup of coffee a day. And my husband got me nothing. And empty stocking, and nothing under the tree.  

My youngest son got me a nice tea cup from a potter we see at the Farmers Market. But literally asked me if I wanted one when we were there, I stepped away so he could pick one, and he did. It is nice. And the only thing I like. But I basically hand delivered it to him for me. And my husband was jealous so I am just giving it to him. Its not worth it. 

I have been crying all morning. I went to bed at 6:30 last night because my husband was mad he didnt get sex yet. He had made me go out of Christmas Eve to buy a $100 prime rib. He decided not to cook. That, or our backup plan, or anything. He was having a panic attack. He got too many presents, didnt open 2 of mine, got mad because his 200 gift I bought him won't be here until Tuesday. Meanwhile he did nothing at all, all season. 

After he walked away from me for saying there was not much to put me in the mood yet and it was only 6pm and our sons were a right there. And we hadn't eaten anything. I just went to bed and cried. I took back the gifts he didnt open because I feel stupid for buying them. He criticized everything he was given by everyone. And they really tried for him, unlike me. 

I am so hurt. I have been so depressed and supposedly they were all so worried about me. Yet, none of them did anything that really thought of me. I give up. Do I just leave? Id this the end? 

And for the record, I made it so easy on them, I literally said out loud to all of them ""all I want is stuff for my new watercolor painting addiction"". Not one painting related anything. I feel stupid. They say I never ask for anything, i say they never listen. I know I was right this time. 

This is what i got them:

Everyone but me: Christmas pjs/Stocking stuffers 
Each son: a Seward chest with their first stuffed animal and a self portrait from elementary school. 
Oldest son: Bills boombox that he is loving and showing off all the cool things it does. 
Middle: Comfy pants made special for him with our dogs face and name on them. 
Youngest: a very expensive LL Bean cardigan he wanted. 
Husband: LL Bean Chamois shirt, Billy Strings swag, Allman Brothers album blanket, expensive walking pad because he has diabetes and we live in Buffalo and it is all he does for exercise. 
Myself: anxiety and tears.",138,1766746089.0,AmIOverreacting,330,0.83,False

· Zero pressure. We can start by talking about the best place for chai, our favorite Tamil movie, or why Chennai traffic is... an experience.
· If we click, maybe grab a coffee or something casual.

If any of this sounds cool, just send me a DM! Tell me what you're binge-watching right now or your go-to comfort food.

1pw1e9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1pw1e9f/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1pw1dn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Shop/comments/1pw1dn3/shared_thoughts_from_cafe_owners_coffee_pros_what/,Shared thoughts from cafe owners & coffee pros: what a “good menu” should do,"Last week, while doing some product research, I talked with several cafe owners and experienced coffee drinkers about one topic: **how menus are actually used in cafes**. Here are the key takeaways we seemed to agree on.

I’d call it:

A group of people who take coffee seriously—thinking together about menus.



**01 / Menu text shouldn’t be just a list, it should translate missing/pro-level info for customers**

In specialty coffee menus, I keep seeing two extremes:

**Too little information**: name + price only. Customers can’t tell what it is or how to choose.

**Too much structured information**: origin, process, altitude, variety, tasting notes… everything stacked. It’s complete, but it creates a comprehension burden and decision fatigue.

A clear shared consensus:

**(1) Information should be transparent and complete**

At minimum, customers should be able to see:

origin & processing

whether there’s any added flavoring or special treatment

awards / auction / rare-lot signals

So when a coffee is clearly more expensive, the customer understands *why* (BOP, auction lot, rarity, etc.).

  
**(2) Information should be layered**

Dumping everything at once overwhelms people. A better approach is:

start with **1–2 easy, decision-driving cues** (often flavor preference)

then reveal deeper details only when the customer shows interest

In short:

We need a bridge between **“professional fields”** and **“flavor-first, explanatory descriptions.”**

[all info listed VS flavor-first, explanatory info](https://preview.redd.it/cag0sz0syi9g1.jpg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31a103b7351fefbb6029d9cfc83e236adaece847)



**02 / A menu can also act as a recommendation engine**

When we discussed how cafes guide customers to order, most owners said they typically recommend based on **flavor preference**. So the question becomes: *What if the menu itself could support that recommendation flow?* Better experience for customers, and more efficient service.

Common agreement:

**(1) The recommendation path should be intuitive + reusable, while respecting individuality**

A widely accepted flow is:

**flavor preference → choose variety & process → add origin/farm context → finalize 1–2 beans**

**(2) Visual communication beats pure text**

Compared with long textual descriptions, visuals lower the barrier and invite participation:

product cards / flavor wheels / mouthfeel matrix / origin maps / lightweight click interactions (tap to expand explanations, compare similar profiles, etc.)

[“Feels like big data recommending” vs “Feels like it understands my taste”](https://preview.redd.it/947r1pna0j9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8999806acaba97345409df192aefbf1a06ff8ba7)



**03 / A menu is long-term content and business asset**

One perspective came up repeatedly and deserves emphasis:

**Flavor notes, variety, origin, processing — all of that is high-quality content.**

It doesn’t only help ordering. It can also be reused for:

new product / flavor development

social content (posts, reels, bean cards)

in-store visuals (menu, tasting cards)

From this view, a menu is not a one-time material. It becomes a **reusable operating asset**, and its core driver is often **flavor-first communication**.

[multiple layers of info in a menu](https://preview.redd.it/pz4q7rci0j9g1.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=480b02006d431993cc33d615fd92b1790805a03e)



Hope this helps reframe the value of menus.

Jace Miller was somewhere east of Memphis, fucking around with his mental health. He had sunken cheeks, dead eyes, and a jawline weaker than a politician’s convictions. Worse, his sweat reeked of ammonia.

That alone should’ve been a check-engine light. A flashing warning to slow down, to stop. But Jace’s personal motto was that he’d try anything once…except abstinence or sobriety.

And that’s how he ended up doubled over outside the Mission, palms on his knees, lungs on fire. He’d just sprinted sixteen blocks from a CVS. His face was flushed, his chest rattling with coughs that came in ragged, spastic bursts. His heart tried to punch its way out of his ribs. But he’d done it. He scored.

Three boxes of propylhexedrine. *Benzedrex*, if you prefer its Christian name. A humble nasal decongestant for the law-abiding. A dirty, volatile high for him.

He crouched on the curb, gulping air. Dug through his backpack until he found a pair of scissors and a 100mg THC gummy. The gummy went into his mouth. The scissors went to work, popping the caps off the inhalers. He ripped the lavender-scented cotton free and inhaled the chemical sweetness like it was a bouquet of cheap euphoria.

Jace had heard the horror stories about this stuff. Blocked intestines. Cardiotoxic shock. Sudden death. But hell, he’d just stolen to get his fix. The high was as dirty as his conscience. None of it mattered. 

He yanked a water bottle from his pack and took a steadying breath. The first cotton was bitter and oily, like chewing a wad of burned violets. He shoved it to the back of his throat, chased it with water, swallowed. Twice more.

He felt like Marlon Brando with a mouthful of cotton balls. Only this wasn’t method acting.

The edible and Benzedrex would take an hour to bloom inside him. So he waited, twitchy and restless, until a white 14-passenger bus rolled up, door hissing open. A line of ragged men shuffled aboard.

Framed by the bus window, he saw her.

Blond hair like a halo, skin pale as porcelain, eyes the deep green of something half-feral. She studied him, her lips curling into a slow, deliberate smile that climbed all the way to her eyes.

*II: BUS TO BROOKSIDE*

Jace turned to his side and nudged a bald man with a teardrop tattoo.

“Hey, buddy,” he muttered. “Where’s this bus headed?”

He looked at Jace, vacantly.



“Celebrate Recovery,” he said, thrusting his balled fists in the pocket of a rain jacket. “The one at Brookside.”



Jace considered it for a minute. 



“Is that the Christian one?” he asked. He was weighing the prospect. On one side of the scale? Sitting through an hour-long lecture on the degeneracy of man. On the other side? Getting laid by the cute blonde he saw in the bus.



The man shrugged. “Christian? I guess. It’s a drug recovery group. Like N.A. They got free coffee.”



Free coffee and a beautiful girl was enough to sell Jace. He fell in line behind the man. As the group of dirty men and women filed into the bus, Jace begged God to let him sit next to the girl he was crushing on. No such luck. When he shuffled down the aisle, a man with square-rimmed glasses and fish-lips had already plopped down next to her. 



*Damn it.*



Jace slung his backpack into an empty row two seats behind her and slumped down. With a jerk, the bus pulled out, and he let the soft vibratory pattern of the road and the wheels lull him into a cocoon of his own thoughts. 



It was too early for this to be the come-up. 



And yet? 



His mind turned cosmic. He immersed himself in the daydream, his thoughts waxing poetic on that girl in front of him. She was wild as roadside chicory, blooming where she shouldn’t, stretching defiantly toward the sun, stubborn and free. She wore white cowboy boots, pearl buttons, and a bolo tie that clung to her throat like a relic of some holy war. Manifest Destiny, maybe. The Wild West, perhaps. But her gods were different. Merle Haggard, Townes Van Zandt, Woody Guthrie. Her patron saint was Dolly, and she would kneel at that altar every night if it meant she could catch the corner of the country singer’s sequined hem. Then, she would finally be well. Then, she could be whole and holy.



Jace leaned toward the window and let his temple touch the cool pane of the glass. He felt like the protag in *White Nights* by Dostoevsky. A hopeless romantic. A poet, with two degrees and a penchant for maladaptive daydreaming. 



Images flitted past him outside the bus’ window. They wheeled past shuttered shops and payday loan offices hiding behind iron bars. A woman with raccoon eyes and a plastic grocery bag gave him a once-over and lit a cigarette with a flick that said she’d seen every kind of man, and he wasn’t the interesting kind.



*It’s a time honored tradition,* Jace mused, lost in thought again. *This penchant to renounce the physical world in favor of spheres of your own creation. Think philosophers and poets idling in promenades or opium dens, musing on their inventions. Or the painter in the brothels, looking to experience life and its most decadent and most degenerate. I’m the new-Decadent. An early adopter to the neo-Aesthetic movement.*



A hefty woman to Jace’s right hacked loudly, a cough that sounded wet and serious



The bus drifted past dilapidated buildings and over cracked sidewalks. A busted neon sign buzzed above a pawn shop, the letters flickering. The street looked like it hadn’t been cleaned since God gave up on the place. Gum spots and oil slicks fought for real estate on the concrete, cigarette butts lining the gutters. The perfect noir backdrop for a Neo-Aesthete, starving-artist turned homeless drug addict.

*Drug addict,* Jace thought. *Christ.*

He looked out on the urban blight that was his hometown.  A pack of kids hovered outside the liquor shop, waiting for some sucker to buy them a 40. Street lights flickered like they were debating whether to stay on or give up entirely. At a stoplight, a man held a cardboard sign and peered into a driver-side door. The car’s occupant ignored him, kept his eyes fixed on the red light. It turned green. When he hit the gas, the motor knocked, hollow and rhythmic under the hood. A warning. With a turn of the stereo knob, he drowned it out with some godawful mumble rap. 

His eyes fell on the woman to his right, no longer struggling with her handkerchief. She was dozing off now, her head titled back and her mouth lolling open every time the bus hit a pothole.

The truth was, Jace had learned to love his fate, in some respects. Art gave him a buffer between himself and the real world. Hell, it created some space between him and this phlegmy woman to his right. 

A dynamic recontextualizing to make life more palatable and infused with meaning. But to recognize this would be akin to watching how they make the sausage. So he tried to push such pointless metacognition aside and focus solely on his mental preoccupations.

He was an idler, a man on a bus to a recovery group, imagining himself in a gritty, pulpy detective novel. In the space it takes to drive from the mission to an urban church, he’d already fallen in love and lost the woman of his dreams.

*III: BASEMENT LITURGY*

A hiss tore the air. The bus door snapped open, an ugly, hydraulic jaw clanking wider than it should, and the gesture struck Jace as the most mechanical thing he’d seen all day. It jarred him out of his trance. He filed off with the others, down a corridor, through double-doors, into the stairs’ throat.

The basement walls were the color of sand. Formica tables. Stackable chairs encircling one of them. Jace slid into a seat. The place smelled of Donut Shop™ coffee. He rose, mechanically. Chose a K-Cup™, cradled a Styrofoam™ cup, the whole ritual embalmed in trademark symbols. God, how he despised the 21st century.

Back at the table, faces sagged across from him: wrinkled leather masks orbiting the Bunn coffee pot. Always a Bunn. Always the chuckle of water boiling up its neck. This was Recovery Group. VFW hall or church basement, it didn’t matter. The signage changed; the architecture of defeat remained.

Settled back into their chairs, the drunks and drug-addicts prepped for the meeting. A woman named Rhonda laid down the ground rules: No side-talk, say “pass” if you don’t want to share, and everything said stays ensconced in the dungeon of the church.

One by one, the men and women unraveled their horrors. A bandaged arm lifted: last week he’d punched through glass because voices demanded it. Schizophrenia, jagged and unstitched. Another spoke of watching his friend die mid-deal, bullets turning his body into an anatomy lesson: the neck wound spurting, the eye dangling by its cord like some grotesque pendulum.

Jace’s stomach turned. Was it the Benzedrex or the visceral description? 

He felt suddenly reduced, a goldfish dropped into an ocean. He’d always counted his pain like coins, bargaining with it, weighing its worth. Here, he was at a table of high rollers, and his currency looked counterfeit. He scraped across his memory: Was there some hidden trauma? Some buried crime? His ledger came up empty. His suffering, he realized, had been elective.

When his turn arrived, panic squeezed his chest. He blurted:

“I’m high on benzedrex and THC right now. Zero days clean. Guess I’ll have to post-date my recovery to tomorrow. Hopefully.”

Heads shook. One woman covered her face with her palms. Her rose tattoo peeked out above her ear. An impossibly small detail that glowed at Jace like a flare, as if it carried her entire biography in its petals. 

“Once you’ve tasted the Living Water, that shit don’t taste the same, brother,” she murmured. Her voice came from far back in her nose and had a bit of a rasp. Jace shifted in his chair and tugged at the neck of his hoodie.

“Okay,” he said, bobbing his head, trying to sound convincing. “I’m trying to make a plan now. I know the program doesn’t work unless you work it. I’m committing to all twelve steps.”

He paused, looked at his shoes. “And with that, I’ll pass.”

He didn’t believe a word. He barely knew what they meant. He just shifted his voice to mimic theirs, the sing-song of recovery clichés. He spoke fluent platitude.

The man beside him cleared his throat. His name was Pat.

Jace had never met a Pat who wasn’t a wreck. This one hunched forward, elbows planted, beard clumped like seaweed, bouncing as he talked. His breath carried Jäger fumes as he raved about Jesus. Things were getting cartoony. Pat’s facial features snapped into expression at just too low of a frame-per-second.

“I don’t even preach no more,” Pat said, his Air Force Veteran cap tilted like a bad halo. “I just ask: do you know Jesus? And dadgummit, that’s enough. Starts the conversation. Ephesians 3 says He’s able to give exceedingly, abundantly, beyond all we ask, think, or imagine. Now tell me. What’s the best thing you could ask, think, or imagine, young man?”

He swung to the kid beside him, a longhair twenty-something with a teardrop tattoo under his eye. The kid shrugged, tugging his hoodie’s drawstring to distract himself.

“Heaven,” Pat answered for him. “What’s better than heaven? Don’t know, but God promised it. With that, I’ll pass.”

A weary chorus: “Thanks, Pat.” Relief exhaled like a draft through the room.

Jace drifted. He saw the pattern: endless avatars of the same type. Street-beaten prophets, half-pickled, Bible-slinging with a strange authority. They cycled in and out of basements like this: nabbed on warrants, slipping back to baby mamas, vanishing into county lines and ether.

And then there was Jace.



His was the spiritual progeny of Ginsberg and *the best Minds of his Generation* and *angelheaded hipsters.* The living Manticore of the Hippie’s Dead dream. Its failure realized. Conjured up by TikTok and mimetic desire and reading too much theory and not enough praxis.



His mind unfurled like a fractal, into thoughts the same chandelier-shape of the hallucinatory prose of *Dharma Bums* beatnicks. He shikintaza’d his mind stream while the PPX and THC took hold. And just as soon, he was binge-watching his Manic Episodes. He knew for a moment that all religion was whatever you could convince yourself of.

His eyes darted over faces: sunken, pocked, collapsing back toward animal. The human body, embarrassingly at home among beasts. The women painted their brokenness in cheap makeup, plastering ruin with Revlon.

One man gestured wildly, arms jerking. Jace saw an ape in the fluorescent jungle, jabbering with simian fervor. And he knew he was no different…primate ranting about poets and hidden winks through the centuries. Neuroatypical, stimming, spinning his mania into scripture only he could read.

A bead of cold sweat tickled Jace’s hairline. He flicked it away, his eyes sweeping the room. 

And then? Nothing. 

He realized he hadn’t spoken at all. He’d been sitting still, listening in silence. The room had carried on without him. Jace’s body convulsed in an involuntary shudder. The hash hadn’t made him less anxious, it just made him panic in slow motion.

*IV: AVA, OUR LADY*



Soon it was his angel’s turn to speak. The gorgeous girl from the bus. She said her name was Ava. Strawberry-blonde, skin stained pink by the burn of starlight. 



*O Ava, Our Lady*. Jace prayed. *My Catherine Tekakwitha and the One Who Hears the Cries of the World.* 



According to Ava, she took the needle out of her arm a few months back. Jace took a moment to detach from the meaning of her words, and just allow her voice to wash over him. It was a lilting, sonorous tone. Like the sweet trill of birdsong or Elysian bells. He could see now that this was her Mythos, and everyone else was just a character living in it. 



He decided he ought to tune into her words, and when he did, she was mid-rant:



“I love astrology because it slakes my thirst for spirituality, without all the hierarchy and bureaucratic bullshit that goes along with other religions. And yes, if anything, it’s feminine. It’s not about rules or power; it’s a way to explore your life, to reflect. Is it literally true? Probably not. It’s imaginary. But honestly? The imaginary things are always the most real.”



Jace felt his head bob along, unsure what he was agreeing with. Her little speech wasn’t about sobriety, which he already considered a point in her favor. But waxing poetic about religion? That particular set of words, said in that exact order, awoke him like a sleeper agent.

There was something about Ava…something brooding and a little wild beneath the surface. Maybe he just wanted to shake things up, to toss a rock into the still waters of his carefully ordered life and see what sort of chaos rippled out.

Or maybe, just maybe, he recognized a kindred spirit. A woman in transition. On the run from whatever life she used to lead. That kind of thing resonated with him. People who’d gotten a little lost always did. So, in a moment of sheer impulse, he decided tonight’s goal was to befriend her.

Ava’s turn ended and she busied herself with crumbling up an empty sugar packet. As the next few folks spewed their life stories, Jace tuned out. He sipped his coffee, his mind riffing on some improbable theme. He thought about mugs, and the way their concave lips forced the drinker to approximate a smile when he drank. 

Jace recognized his thought patterns.THC turned his world inside-out. He needed to focus…to recognize that his internal monologue ought not to be given the same weight as the world around him. Already, he could feel himself retreating into the mind palace that all humans possess, whether they conceptualize such a place or not. These “abodes” are like Sukhvati, as real as literal, because they exist in the minds of people. In such a way, they are not metaphors.

And so, here in his pocket dimension of PPX-induced thought, Ava was Avaloketesvara, the One Who Hears the Cries of the World.

So, what would his cry to Ava be?

He thought, *I want to meet you, Ava. I believe. Help my unbelief.* 

His thoughts came fast and loose, bound to derail, like boxcars held by corroded pins and couplers. He squeezed his eyes ‘til he saw stars, the effects of his own homebrew take on the hippie speedball.

*I’m a “The-One-You’re-Seeking-Is-Seeking-You-head-ass,”* Jace thought. *I call myself a lay-philosopher. Which is good, I think. When you get to the highest echelons of the humanities, there are no masters. Religion? Philosophy? Only laymen exist on such topics. Anyone who claims differently is a conman or a charlatan. Probably both.*



Jace was carried through the meeting by the psychoactive haze in the same way a leaf is borne down a stream. The remainder of the meeting was a blur of sob stories and trite truisms. 



When he came to, he was outside, smoking a menthol. He tried to hone in on the unique scent. To ground himself in something earthy and the pungent. But then he craned his neck and peered upwards. The sky was dark and deep as the gaping maw of God, ready to swallow him whole. He fixed his eyes on the glittering stars, stuck between the teeth of a deity whose only real policy is a commitment to non-intervention.



*How long, O Lord?* Jace thought. 



Was he wishing on a star or praying, when he offered up that lament, the Christian version of groveling for a *coup de grâce*? 



“Are you getting a download?” a voice broke in. A voice like a Tibetan singing bowl in its clarity. Jace looked up. His eyes met the green eyes of Ava, which stood out like a bad idea.



“What do you mean, a download?”



*V: CROSSING THE RUBICON*



He was already disappointed in himself. In all of his internal pontificating, Jace had failed to come up with an action plan. He wasn’t exactly gifted in the art of seduction, but for *her* to approach *him?* He couldn’t help but kick himself.



“You were staring off into space,” Ava continued, smirking. “It’s like you were a robot getting your download from the Universe.”



Jace stifled a laugh, and he thought it made him look even crazier. He dropped his cigarette butt and extinguished it with a twist of his heel.



“My name’s Jace,” he said, extending his hand. “Jace Miller.”



“Mine’s Ava,” she said before adding: “You’re greening out.” 



He shrugged.



“It’s not so bad,” he told her, and he couldn’t stop thinking about where his tongue sat in his mouth. “But yes, I am.”



Ava ran her tongue along her top teeth and looked like she was considering something.



“Well, want to go for a stroll?” she asked, finally. “Pacing around downtown always keeps my panic attacks at bay.”



Jace agreed. It hadn’t been the ice-breaker he planned, but already, he’d stumbled backwards into an ad hoc first date. He wasn’t going to blow the chance. 



So, they walked.



At first, the two didn’t say much. They padded past CSL Plasma clinics. Same-day check-into-cashes. Women whirling like Dervishes under the lowlight of streetlamps. Spun out, they were. Magdalenes, bent double, in catatonic fenty-stupor, still pawing for the hem of Jesus.



Their boots crunched over broken 40s, the urban bastardization of sea-glass. Probably 63 degrees. Light wind and the leaves began to turn. A burgundy hoodie and jeans felt like heaven. Nothing was mission critical. 



Ava wanted to listen to a song. One AirPod each, they found the mono-version of some indie artist. It was a little bluesy, a little tinny, something from the middle of the chest. But to hunk of gray matter as primed as Jace’s was, it was perfect. The music swelled and crescendoed with all the conviction and majesty of a full orchestra.



*Serotonin, to this bass-line I bind you.* Jace prayed. *To the melody, Oxytocin, I bind you. In the name of Jesus, I bind you.*



“You know, I’m high, too,” Ava admitted. “Must be why I was drawn to you at the meeting.” 



She swayed a little and Jace felt like he was getting on her wavelength. Their signals were crossing and he was reading her mind a little. He saw, then, that she’d taken a low-dose of magic mushrooms. It occurred to him that doing mushrooms for Ava was like dialysis of the mind. She’d never feel better than immediate post-session. Her mood would continue to wane like a setting sun until the next controlled-burn of the brain.



He could see Ava, and she was an independent operator. She could strike sparks anywhere, meet anyone at any time. Jace saw she ought to go barefoot everywhere because any place she touched was holy ground. He felt he was getting pulled into her gravity, somehow. That this reality was more hers than his.



“Oh, hell, Ava, what are we going to do?” Jace asked.



And they plunged themselves into the heart of night, as dark as a raven’s breast. There were leering men, their words and breath alike all cloying, thick, and heady.  There were addicts collecting stamp bags like Pokemon, shooting stars inside their veins. They knew some emotions wouldn’t be bargained with. Best not to try. 



There were night walkers and jay walkers and sleep walkers. Ava led Jace to a stoop where a man sold Hydros. Old School Salesman, his hands were mitts looking for a shoulder to land on.  

They made their purchase and walked off. 



Down, down, downtown they walked. Jace’s socks were too loose and his shoes were too tight. His feet blistered and calloused with all the walking. 



Ava procured a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of water from her purse. She offered Jace the Lucky, and the two sparked up and sipped water and swallowed hard. Flicking open her cigarette box, she procured the Hydrocodone, which they tossed down their throats.But they smoked and the smoke coughed out in mouthfuls. A spasmodic, gray rejection. The only message they had to relay to the world: dark gray plumes pushed into an already darkening sky. 



The two stumped past a liquor shop and juked-out tweakers moving sharp and stilted like marionettes. They found an abandoned house, and unlatched the backyard’s gate. They padded in, sat in patio furniture, watching cats spill through missing slats in the fence like intrusive thoughts. 



There was some conversation.



She told him a story. She said:



“I knew a Russian who moved to America as a child. He struggled to learn English. By his teenage years, he was okay but clearly not fluent. The trouble was that he’d gone so long without speaking Russian that he’d forgotten it. He was not quite fluent in either language, a victim of himself. He gift-of-the-Magi’d his own brain into someone who can’t communicate. It made him unreachable. He suffered. And brother, I worry I’m doing the same thing to myself, but not through language, but worldview.”



She said some more things; she said:



“Some women want to feel brave. Some want to feel dangerous. I’ve got none of the former and a lot of the latter.” 



That's what she told Jace, in that gritty film noir, where she talked in a clipped Transatlantic accent with her collar turned up. Then Jace and Ava thought brave thoughts and talked brave sentences. They set forth a 5-year plan: she was to wear flower crowns. He said she was wilder than he was, though her life was more in order. They promised to talk shit about Gen Alpha on a porch swingset into their 80s. She was his Phillip Marlowe.



The two stood up and it was hard to stand up. And the blood ran quick and the seeing stars and then okay. The high took a jazzy turn and Jace’s thoughts were butter sliding on a simmering skillet.



*The Poets were built for such a time as this. Blue bottles of Feel Free, gas station highs, deplatformed divas and DRM. ASD Comorbidity. Hemp Farming Act of 2018. People-first language and Deconstruction.*



*God let’s a lot of shit slide,* Jace said. *We call that mercy*. 



And he was coming down when he found himself on the roof of an abandoned sporting good’s store, lying on his back, staring at the night sky. Ava was yapping about some astrology bullshit and Jace was wishing the stars could just be stars, no less beautiful than before the poets needled them into language and astrologers needled them into religion: post-mortem phenomena reduced to concept.



She was pointing out Cassieoepia when her voice in his head said:



*The red, broken blood vessels in my eyes are scarlet cords hung in the window of my soul. I am Rahab in rehab and you’re the scout who saved me. Holler through my window, where I’m the faulty human element in an otherwise immaculate defense system. Break my walls. Utterly ruin me.*



And he flinched with a start and she was talking about how humans are but vectors for loftier concepts such as courage and love. 



“Call them devas,” she explained. “They ride our kind like a Pegasus, our lives their struggle to be made manifest.”



Jace squeezed his eyes shut and then she was saying, “You’ll resign your post as heaven’s doorman and fling wide your stupified love. Greeting congregants at church doors, you’ll ask, *are you here on business or pleasure?”*



He was coming back in waves and catching snatches of conversation. Real conversation. Spoken in words.



“Want to see something cosmic?” she asked.



She didn’t wait for a yes, but nestled in close to him, pointing upward. “There’s a planetary alignment tonight. Rare one. Jupiter, Venus, Mars, and Mercury…lined up like they’re waiting in line to hand me a sign.”



Jace blinked. Didn’t respond how she wanted.



“I’m serious,” she crooned. “It only happens every few years.”

Jace sighed, the kind of long-suffering sound that meant he was already halfway to giving in.

“I still say the world is just a pale blue dot,” he said. “An asterisk on an otherwise indifferent universe.”



But above them, the stars spilled across the sky like someone had knocked over a jar of glitter. And there they were: planets aligned in a quiet parade. Pointing upwards, Ava traced invisible lines that danced from star to star.

“See that?” she asked, voice low and warm. “That’s Cassiopeia: the queen in chains. And over there, Aries: the ram who doesn’t stop to ask permission.”

Jace followed her finger with a small, curious smile, clearly amused but indulging her anyway.

“I’ll take your word for it.”

And the two came down. And they came down from the roof of the sporting good’s store. 



*And God Bless Dick’s*, Jace thought. *The planetarium par excellence for tonight’s festivities.*  



The two meandered through town, back in the general direction from where they came. Ava yawned.



“I think the effects are all but worn off, by now,” she said. “And honestly, I’m ready to call it a night. Walk me home?”



Jace snorted. *Home.* As in, the shelter. He stopped in his tracks, thrusting both hands into his hoodie pockets. 



“I’ve got somewhere I’ve gotta be,” Jace lied. “You got mace, don’t you?”



Ava expelled a short puff of air as her eyebrows drew together. 



“The fuck? You can’t spare 15 minutes to make sure I’m not mugged or raped?”



Jace opened his mouth to protest. He wanted to tell her that he only misspoke. The hydros made him groggy and bad with words. But Ava was shaking her head, turning away. What he should’ve done is to yell out her name. To change her mind. To chase her down. 



Instead, he slowly inflated his lungs and let out a long, steady breath. And then, he turned to walk in the opposite direction. Easy come, easy go. 



But *why,* once he’d found his twin flame, would he walk away so easily*?*



Because inside Jace, a roiling spiritual hunger licked at his ribs. The Vicodin he’d scored with Ava? It’d only whet his whistle. How long had it been since he’d sampled opioids? Must’ve been years. He’d steered clear since the dealers started lacing the smack with fentanyl. Heroin was all but extinct in this city. But now, he lusted after that buzz to end all buzzes–that slow motion in a syringe. 



He paused at a crosswalk. If he turned left and crossed the street, that was akin to crossing the Rubicon. If he sauntered that direction, he’d find the dope man. And if he did, he’d take it. He’d plunge himself into active polysubstance abuse disorder. He’d risk OD.



And yet.



He took a step to his left, and then one more. 



*I am quiet-quitting my life,* Jace thought as his shoes padded over the asphalt.



He passed through the neighborhood like a specter with unfinished business. Blinds were bent down as paranoid somnambulists peered out with bloodshot eyes. The moon hung low and shone bright, posing like the sun’s first understudy. A bony dog limped through a yard, slipping from shadow to shadow. And as ever, the shrill sound of police sirens cut through the smoggy air. 



It wasn’t long ‘til he found the place. 



Jace wandered up the walkway, his shoes bending in half stalks of overgrown weeds. The white paint was peeling off the wooden siding of the one-level, dilapidated traphouse. Some species of sedge was growing from the cracked shingles on the roof, and the picture window in the living room was boarded up. Up the stoop, Jace rapped his knuckles on the door and waited. Nothing. He knocked again. 



Finally, the door swung on rusty hinges and he saw the same Old School Salesman he’d met earlier in the night.



“‘Ey, a repeat customer,” the man said cheekily, and he grinned but it didn’t reach his eyes. The man was bald, early 50s, with deep-set eyes and a nose that stuck out like a bad idea. His eyes flitted across the street where, above the houses, an interstate stretched as far as the eye could see.



“Damn semis,” he muttered. “They’ll wake the dead, rattling all those windows and setting off car alarms. There oughta be zoning laws about putting those so close to neighborhoods.”

  
Jace shifted from one leg to another. The irony of a drug dealer at a crackhouse railing on about zoning laws wasn’t lost on him. He wasn’t sure how to respond, so he didn’t.



“You seen that Pixar movie, *Cars*? Route 66 town, then bam—new interstate, and we’re a ghost story. Highway right up the ass of the American Dream. Even Lightning McQueen couldn’t fix it. Jiminy Cripes.”



Jace cleared his throat, and the tweaker-looking junkslinger apprised him for a moment.



“Right, you didn’t come here to talk cartoons,” he said, jerking his head backwards, motioning Jace to follow him.



Inside, he was greeted by the smell of mildew and forgotten cleaning products. Carpet underfoot, gray, threadbare, fraying into spools. The room was dimly lit by a flickering, overhead bulb that buzzed like a fly stuck in a jar. On the mattress, a man was lying on his side, his head tucked into his chest and his eyes closed. Sitting next to him was a stick-thin woman with wiry hair and lesions on her face. In the corner, a man was slumped against the wall, syringe still in-hand. He was unconscious.



“So, what’ll it be?” the dealer who’d opened the door asked.



*I’ll have what the man on the floor is having,* he thought. Instead:



“What can you do for $20?” Jace said, pulling the crumpled bill from his hand.



“That’ll getcha a point,” he said, taking the money and disappearing momentarily into another room. He handed Jace a tiny, waxed envelope, no larger than a matchbox, sealed with the Ferrari logo. 



*A horse,* Jace thought. *I get it.* 



His hands shook as he took the bag. He slung his backpack off his shoulder and found a spot along the wall. Letting his back slide against it, he crumpled into a heap, sitting criss-cross. He tore into his backpack and procured his kit. He fell into the ritual without thinking. The spoon, the lighter, the little paper of powder. Jace’s hands moved with the same non-effort of automatic writing. Too familiar. Too easy.



The dope melted into something the color of old tea. Jace watched the syringe fill and tightened his tourniquet. His eye twitched in anticipation as the warmth he hadn’t earned called to him. Some last, bright instinct whispered *don’t*. But instinct was a dog he hadn’t fed in years.



It took him a couple tries to find a vein. When he did, he pressed the plunger and let the amber mercy flood him. Drawn blood bloomed into the barrel like a scarlet peony. A warm, metallic rush flooded his arm, his cheeks, his chest. He took in a jagged breath and exhaled, his vision dimming at the edges.



*Too fast.*



The tension in his shoulders slacked as he slumped forward. The world had been thrown off its axis. Then, he realized that was his head. He tried to swallow, but the swallow didn’t finish. With great effort, he lifted his head, only for it to loll forward again. A twinge of mortal fear flickered in the back of his brain but was consumed by the rising sun inside his skull. The shoelace slipped from his arm and landed in his lap. 



*Too much.*



Jace’s head was swimming. Every movement was gelatinous, the air ossified and gravity tripled. His head wouldn’t stay up. His eyelids were made of lead. Jace tried to suck in air, but his muscles rebelled. Something escaped his lips like a wet snore. A rattle. Jace could’ve sworn a barbell rested atop his chest. Each breath was a rep, labored and jagged.



Sounds muffled and colors blurred. Jace’s mouth hung agape and in the distance, a siren cut through the velvety night. He never heard the end of it. A gurgle. A thin line of condensation curled on Jace’s lip. 



And then, Jace was no more.

1pw19u4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pw19u4,1/100 churches visited. CCO Saint Patrick.,"*Forewords*
Greets brothers and sisters in Christ.
One of the things on my bucket list is to visit 100 Catholic churches across England. I’m a teenage male who was raised Catholic and i love my faith.
As the years go on, and as I attend Mass every Sunday, I’ve noticed that the number of people in church only goes downhill, especially among younger people. On top of that, I personally struggle with sins that have become normalised and even glorified in today’s culture.
Seeing these two things made me realise that something needs to change — mainly within myself. I need to put more effort into my faith, maybe prove something to myself, or at least find a better way out of the sins . I also know that, realistically, I can only do so much because of my age, financial situation, college, and everything else going on in life.
That’s what led me to this decision: to make the effort to visit different Catholic churches and share a bit about each one I’ve had the honour of visiting.


First Stop: 
Name : Catholic Chuch Of Saint Patrick 
https://maps.app.goo.gl/sYdRs4kQPdUz2Vbo6

D&T: 21 Dec 2025 (09:00 mass)

First impressions: 7 minute by foot out of Waterloo station,hidden within the residents a a tower stands.quite a funny entrance for a chuch, having to walk up stairs the size of an average house's. The chuch is quite small really, almost sized like a chapel, small but well equipped( with a very convenient confession) . 
 
Mass: welcoming polish Priest that runs the service alone, no altar servers / communion ministers at all. unfortunately no music was available for the 9 oclock mass due to a shortage of musicians. Priest homily is definitely not boring! No disrespect or offense but the communion tasted and feels very different from other churches )or at least all the churches ive been to).

Community: mostly travellers / non residents, and because of that, its really quiet(like less than 20 people). In a way its peaceful? Theres tea and coffee after 11:00 mass it seems.

Personal experience: went confession, met and spoke to a family of travellers, lovely people! London eye was nearby so i had to. ",6,1766745052.0,Christianity,2,0.88,False
