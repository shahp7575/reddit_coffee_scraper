1l6zaq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AkoBaYungGago/comments/1l6zaq7/abyg_kasi_ayaw_kong_magsucceed_yung_business_ng/,ABYG kasi ayaw kong mag-succeed yung business ng ex-bestfriend ko dahil nagka affair sya with our FRIEND'S HUSBAND?,"May bestfriend ako for more than 20 years, we basically grew up together and alam na namin mga galawan ng isa't isa. Then shit happened na hindi ko akalain na magagawa niya: she cheated with our friend's husband. Plot twist: Siya yung MAID OF HONOR noong kasal nila.

It all started nung nag plano silang tatlo to set up a coffee shop business.

The ex-bestfriend has a small online store, si guy has a work from home set-up, then yung friend namin works in a corporate setting in Quezon City. My ex-bestfriend and I live around Quezon City area and yung mag-asawa nakatira sa Antipolo City, which is like an hour drive or more. 

Every FRIDAY, since work from home ako lagi ng araw na yon, it was an unspoken rule na lagi kaming tatambay sa bahay ng ex-bestfriend  ko. Then one WEDNESDAY, may kukunin lang akong gamit sa bahay ng ex-bestfriend  ko, nagulat ako andun yung lalaki. So sabi ko, ""Andito ka pala?"" tas ang sagot niya sakin, ""Yes EVERYDAY NA."" Nagulat ako sa everyday. And yung excuse niya e kasi raw sayang sa gas, hintayin na lang daw niya mag-out sa work yung friend namin than driving long, and nag-bu-business planning naman daw sila ng bestfriend ko. That's when I started na mag-hinala sa kanila.

Then kaming apat and yung anak ng ex-bestfriend  ko went out of town para sa birthday ng ex-bestfriend  ko and things got a lot weirder and shittier nung nakita ko sila mismong naglalandian. Ang sakit talaga sa mata ng mga nakita ko. Lalo na at andun yung anak niya. At yung mismong asawa. Sobrang di ko masikmura.

Pag-uwi sa Manila, hindi ko na kinausap ex-bestfriend  ko kasi parang ayaw ko marinig na i-deny niya mga nakita ko. 1 week after, umamin yung ex-bestfriend  ko sakin. Hindi ko napigilan sarili ko na magalit sa kanya. I told her mean things like ang selfish niya dahil hindi niya iniisip anak niya at yung friend namin, and the fact na siya yung maid of honor ng kasal nila.

Sinabihan ko na umamin sila doon sa friend namin. Pero ang sagot nila na wala silang balak umamin dahil mas magulo pa, magiging awkward daw sa business raw, etc etc. Sumagot ako ng kung hindi nila sasabihin, ako ang magsasabi. From there, galit na galit siya sakin at sinabihan ako ng ex-bestfriend ko na wag ako makialam. Days after, umamin yung lalaki dun sa friend namin. And as expected, galit na galit friend namin. And my friend doesn't consider my ex-bestfriend as a friend anymore.

Tinuloy pa rin nila yung business nilang tatlo just because sabi nila malaki na raw mga nalabas nilang pera. Since may corporate work pa rin friend namin, ""bantay sarado"" ng friend ko silang dalawa sa cctv, which i personally doubt na nababantayan talaga. At ako lang to, pero feeling ko may something pa rin sa ex-bestfriend  ko at dun sa guy kahit sinabi nilang ""tinigil"" na nila dahil ganon din e, naiiwan din silang dalawa doon habang nasa work yung friend ko.

I still talk to our friend pero never ko na kinausap yung ex-bestfriend ko at yung lalaki. Sinabi ko talaga diretso sa friend ko na never ako bibili ng kape sa kanila dahil hindi ko masikmura kung paano nagsimula yung business nila, out of cheating and lies.

Di ko na sinabi out loud pero part of me ayaw ko mag-succeed yung business nilang tatlo. Pero ABYG kasi ayaw kong mag-succeed yung business nilang tatlo?

I bolted upright in bed, a scream trapped in my throat. My hand flew to my side, frantically feeling for a scar that wasn't there. Not yet. The phantom pain burned beneath my fingers—a memory from a future that would never happen. Not this time. Sunlight streamed through the thin curtains of my modest apartment, casting the room in a pale golden glow. The digital clock on my nightstand read 5:47 AM. Today was the day. The day I had agreed to donate my kidney to Adrian Foster—the man I had once loved enough to die for. Sweat drenched my nightshirt as fragments of my past life crashed through my mind: the operation, the betrayal, the humiliation, and finally, my death at the hands of the Foster family. The memories were so vivid, so raw, that for a moment, I couldn't breathe. It was real,"" I whispered, my voice breaking the morning silence. ""All of it was real. I pressed my palms against my eyes, trying to steady my racing heart. Somehow, impossibly, I'd been given a second chance. The universe had rewound my tragedy, placing me right at the pivotal moment before my greatest mistake.

This time, I would not be their sacrifice.

The Foster mansion loomed before me, its gleaming white façade no longer the romantic vision I once saw, but a mausoleum of broken promises. I smoothed down my simple blouse and jeans—practical clothes for what I knew would be my final visit.

As I was led through the marble-floored entrance hall by a silent maid, I caught my reflection in an ornate mirror. The woman staring back at me looked different somehow—her eyes harder, her posture straighter. This wasn't the Samantha who had walked these halls before, desperate for approval, for love.

The boardroom door opened, revealing the tableau that had haunted my nightmares. Arthur Foster sat at the head of the polished mahogany table, his silver hair perfectly coiffed, his cold eyes calculating as they assessed me. To his right sat Adrian—beautiful, selfish Adrian—his face pale, dark circles under his eyes betraying his illness. The kidney disease that was slowly killing him. The disease I had once sacrificed everything to cure.

""Samantha,"" Adrian said, a hint of relief in his voice. ""You're here.""

I didn't respond. My gaze moved to the papers laid out neatly on the table before Arthur Foster. The consent forms. The beginning of my end.

""Please, sit,"" Arthur gestured to the empty chair across from him. His voice was smooth, practiced—the voice of a man accustomed to being obeyed. ""We have everything prepared. The procedure is scheduled for tomorrow morning.""

I took the seat, feeling the weight of their expectations pressing down on me. Arthur slid the documents forward, his manicured finger pointing to the signature line.

""As discussed, all your expenses will be covered, of course,"" he continued, his tone making it clear how generous he thought this arrangement was. ""Adrian is very grateful for your... contribution.""

Adrian shifted uncomfortably beside his father. ""Sam, I know this is a lot to ask, but—""

I picked up the pen, feeling its weight in my hand. In my past life, this was the moment I had signed away my future, my dignity, my very life.

I looked up, meeting Adrian's eyes. There was a time when I thought I saw the universe in those eyes.

Now I only saw my prison.

With deliberate slowness, I gripped the papers. The room fell silent, expectant. Then, with a swift, decisive motion, I tore the documents in half. And then in quarters. The sound of ripping paper echoed like gunshots in the stunned silence.

""I'm not sacrificing my life for you,"" I said, my voice razor-cold, unfamiliar even to my own ears. ""Not today. Not ever again.""

Arthur Foster's face contorted with rage. ""What do you think you're doing?""

""Making a different choice,"" I replied, standing up.

Two security guards appeared at the door as if summoned by Arthur's fury. I felt their presence behind me, but I kept my eyes fixed on Adrian, whose face had drained of all color.

""Sam, please,"" he whispered. ""I need you.""

Those words once would have broken me. Now they strengthened my resolve.

""No, Adrian. You needed what I could give you. There's a difference.""

As the guards escorted me out, I caught sight of Olivia Livingston standing in the foyer, her calculating gaze following me, a satisfied smirk playing on her lips. She thought she was witnessing my downfall. She had no idea she was watching my rebirth.

Behind me, I could hear Adrian calling my name, his voice growing fainter as I walked away. Arthur's voice was lower, harder—making a phone call that I knew would set forces in motion against me.

I stepped out into the morning light, the sun warm on my face. For the first time in what felt like forever, I took a deep, full breath.

I had just made two of the most powerful families in the country my enemies.

And I had never felt more alive.

Chapter 2

The Foster mansion shrank in my rearview mirror as I drove away, my hands still trembling on the steering wheel. I had just declared war on one of the most powerful families in the country. The adrenaline coursing through my veins made everything sharper—the sunlight filtering through the windshield, the rumble of my old car's engine, the weight of my decision settling into my bones.

At the first red light, I checked my mirrors and noticed a black SUV two cars behind. When I turned right, it followed. When I made a sudden left, it was still there. My heart hammered against my ribs, but I forced myself to breathe. I wasn't imagining this—the Fosters were already watching me.

I took three unnecessary turns, confirming my suspicions when a second identical SUV appeared at the next intersection. They weren't even trying to be subtle. This was a message: we see you, we're coming for you.

""Not this time,"" I whispered to myself, gripping the wheel tighter. ""Not again.""

I drove to a crowded shopping center, losing the vehicles temporarily in the maze of parked cars. I needed time to think, to plan. The Fosters wouldn't waste any time dismantling my life piece by piece—just as they had before.

\* \* \*

The silence of my apartment greeted me like a warning. I double-locked the door behind me, drawing the curtains closed against prying eyes. My phone buzzed with a notification—a voicemail from an unlisted number. My finger hovered over the play button, dread pooling in my stomach.

""Miss Young,"" a digitally altered voice crackled through the speaker. ""Your decision today was... unfortunate. Reconsider, or there will be dire consequences—for you and those you care about. The Fosters are not people you want as enemies.""

I saved the recording immediately, my hands steady now. Evidence. In my past life, I'd been too scared, too in love with Adrian to document their threats. This time would be different.

My parents. The thought hit me like a physical blow. In my previous life, the Fosters had used my family's vulnerability against me—their medical bills, their mortgage, their safety. I grabbed my keys and rushed back out the door.

\* \* \*

The familiar scent of my mother's faded perfume lingered in the hallway of my parents' small rental unit. But something was wrong. The door was slightly ajar, and taped to it was a bright orange notice—""PAY OR QUIT""—dated today.

""Mom? Dad?"" I called, pushing the door open wider.

The apartment was silent. In the kitchen, I found my answer—empty pill bottles lined up on the counter like tiny soldiers. My father's heart medication. My mother's arthritis pills. All empty, though I knew they'd been filled just last week.

""Samantha?"" My mother's voice, thin and worried, came from the bedroom. She appeared in the doorway, her face pale. ""What are you doing here, sweetheart?""

I crossed the room and hugged her tightly, breathing in her familiar scent, feeling her fragile shoulders under my arms. In my past life, I'd watched her health deteriorate under the stress the Fosters inflicted. I wouldn't let that happen again.

""Mom, I need you and Dad to trust me,"" I said, pulling back to look into her confused eyes. ""Something's happened, and you might be in danger.""

""Danger? What are you talking about?"" She glanced nervously at the eviction notice I was now holding.

""I can't explain everything right now, but I promise I will. Where's Dad?""

""At the doctor's. They said his prescription was never called in, but I know it was."" Her voice trembled. ""And the landlord says we haven't paid rent in three months, but your father has the receipts...""

The Fosters had moved faster than I anticipated. They were already isolating my parents, cutting off their medication, threatening their housing. This was just the beginning.

""Pack a bag,"" I said firmly. ""You're not staying here tonight.""

\* \* \*

Under the cover of darkness, I watched as the movers loaded the last of my parents' essential belongings into the truck. I'd emptied my savings account—every penny I had—to secure them a small apartment three towns over, far enough from the Fosters' immediate reach.

""I still don't understand why all this secrecy,"" my father said, his voice low as we stood in the shadow of their old building.

""Dad, please. I need you to trust me."" I squeezed his hand. ""I'll explain everything once you're settled, but right now, you need to be somewhere safe.""

My mother touched my cheek, her eyes searching mine. ""You're in some kind of trouble, aren't you?""

I couldn't lie to her. ""Yes. But I'm handling it.""

""Is it that Foster boy?"" My father's voice hardened. He'd never trusted Adrian, even when I was blind to his true nature.

""It's complicated,"" I said. ""But I'm not making the same mistakes again.""

They didn't understand what I meant, but they nodded, trusting me despite my cryptic warnings. As they climbed into their car to follow the moving truck, I felt a weight lift from my shoulders. At least they would be safe.

What I didn't see was the camera lens capturing our goodbye from the shadows across the street, or the figure sending the footage directly to Arthur Foster's private phone.

Chapter 3

I spent the next few days in a state of hypervigilance, jumping at shadows and checking my rearview mirror obsessively. The Fosters' reach was extensive, and I knew they were just getting started. With my parents safely relocated, I could focus on rebuilding my own life—starting with finding a job that would give me the financial independence I needed to fight back.

My research led me to Vanguard Technologies, an innovative AI research firm making waves in the tech industry. Their ethical approach to artificial intelligence aligned with my own values, and their CEO, Ryan Mitchell, had a reputation for valuing talent over connections. Most importantly, they weren't in the Fosters' pocket—at least not yet.

I spent hours polishing my resume and preparing for the interview, drawing on knowledge from both this life and my previous one. When the day finally arrived, I stood outside Vanguard's sleek glass headquarters, my portfolio clutched tightly in my hands.

""You can do this,"" I whispered to myself. ""This is your chance.""

The receptionist directed me to a conference room where I was greeted by a tall man with kind eyes and a firm handshake. Ryan Mitchell was younger than I expected, perhaps in his mid-thirties, with dark hair and an understated confidence that immediately put me at ease.

""Miss Young,"" he said, gesturing to a chair. ""I've been looking forward to meeting you.""

Something about him seemed vaguely familiar, though I couldn't place where I might have known him before. Had our paths crossed in my previous life?

The interview began conventionally enough, with questions about my education and experience. But when Ryan asked about my ideas for the future of AI security, I saw my opening.

""Actually,"" I said, pulling out my tablet, ""I've developed a blueprint for an ethical AI security algorithm that I believe could revolutionize how we approach data protection.""

I launched into my presentation, explaining the framework I'd designed—a system that could identify security threats without compromising user privacy. As I spoke, I watched Ryan's expression transform from polite interest to genuine excitement.

""This is... remarkable,"" he said when I finished, leaning forward. ""Most applicants come in here talking about what they've done. You're showing me what could be possible.""

He studied me with newfound intensity. ""Where did you learn to think like this?""

I met his gaze steadily. ""Some lessons come from experience. Others from necessity.""

Ryan nodded slowly, as if he understood more than I was saying. ""Miss Young, I don't need to see any more. I'd like to offer you a position on our AI research team, effective immediately.""

My heart soared. This was it—the first step toward building a life the Fosters couldn't touch.

""I accept,"" I said, unable to keep the smile from my face.

\* \* \*

My first day at Vanguard was a whirlwind of orientation meetings, paperwork, and introductions. By lunchtime, my head was spinning with new information and faces. As I searched for an empty table in the cafeteria, a friendly voice called out to me.

""You look lost! First day?"" A woman with bright eyes and a quick smile waved me over. ""I'm Lena Hanson, AI security division.""

""Samantha Young,"" I replied, setting my tray down across from her. ""And yes, very first day.""

""Well, you picked a good place to land,"" Lena said, her eyes crinkling at the corners. ""Ryan doesn't usually fast-track new hires like he did with you. You must have really impressed him.""

Over lunch, Lena filled me in on everything the employee handbook didn't cover—which managers to avoid, where to find the best coffee, and how to navigate the complex office politics. There was something refreshingly genuine about her that made me feel I could trust her—a rare feeling in my new cautious existence.

As we walked back to our department together at the end of the day, a sleek black car pulled up at the curb outside the building. The door swung open, and a familiar figure emerged, her designer heels clicking against the pavement.

Olivia Livingston.

My blood ran cold as she approached, her predatory smile fixed on me. Lena tensed beside me, clearly familiar with Olivia's reputation.

""Well, well,"" Olivia purred, her eyes raking over me dismissively. ""Samantha Young. I heard you'd crawled out of the gutter and into a real job."" She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. ""Congratulations on escaping poverty—now show me what real talent looks like... if you have any.""

Before I could respond, she brushed past us, the scent of her expensive perfume lingering in the air like a toxic cloud.

""What was that about?"" Lena asked, wide-eyed.

""Old history,"" I replied, watching Olivia disappear into the building. Her presence here couldn't be a coincidence. The Fosters and Livingstons were already making their move—and Vanguard was their next target.

But lately I've realised the literal thinking doesn't really mean what I think it means.

It started with me going out for a coffee with my mother, and when the waiter took our orders she asked me ""do you want anything in your cappuccino?"" And I was like ""... uhm coffee and milk?"" And she said ""no, I mean a syrup?"" I felt really stupid lol but it was aalso really funny.

And then I started thinking back, and I realised I often misinterpret people's questions, or even sayings/expressions etc. I'm not sure whether this is in every language, but there's this saying with ""glass half full"" or ""glass half empty"". And people are always assumed to be ""one or the other"" (to mean a positive or negative person I guess). But the first time that question was asked to me (is the glass half full or half empty?) I was like ""well that depends on whether you're filling your glass or drinking from it, right? If you're filling it's half full but if your drinking its half empty."" And they thought it was a fun and fresh literal answer. I mean, they actually said ""literal answer"" and I never picked up on that lol.

Anyways that was my experience yesterday haha. Do any of you have these fun things that you thought you didn't have until you realised you did?",1,1749456717.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

Dogs everywhere.,"I left the city for a short break out by the English coast and knew it would be a different scenery, with “country folk” typically owning a more dogs on average. 

But nothing could have prepared me for this. 80% of the dogs all wear those silly Amazon “service dog” harnesses. These dogs seem even less well trained than the ones I encounter in the city. 

Their owners are all elderly women who clearly don’t have the energy to have a dog, much less discipline it, and so they pull and pee literally everywhere. 

While having my coffee I noticed every single bollard and lamp post was drenched in the markings of multiple dogs. I saw 6 of them pee over the same spot just in my 15 minutes of sitting there. 

Then there’s the beach. There are multiple signs saying “No dogs allowed on this beach”. It doesn’t even mention the “only service animals” caveat. Just straight up “No dogs”. But there is almost a 1:1 ratio of people to dogs. 

I went with a book and a mat and ended up not even setting my spot up. The barking and running and sniffing absolutely messed up whatever beauty and atmosphere the beach was supposed to have. 

Off leash dogs all howling and barking and chasing birds and peeing and pooping. I ended up just walking in shallow water and then dried myself off and left.

English isn't my first language so excuse any mistakes or funny wording.

Avery close friend of mine has moved out because her husband doesn't treat her well. She still hasn't given up on the mariage completely, hoping he'll reach out and tell her he'll change etc., but it's been 1.5 weeks now and he hasn't contacted her at all (not even asking about their 2 year old kid once).

My friend is currently staying at her mother's house while her mother is on holiday. I offered that she could move in with me and my husband (we have a spare flat in our house which we haven't renovated yet, so it's ugly, but functional) but for now, she prefers staying at her mom's house as her child has lots of toys there.
I went over to her mom's house on Saturday to spend the evening together and let her explain everything, and I invited her for lunch yesterday. She stayed the whole afternoon. First, my husband played with the child so me and my friend could have a coffee and chat, then I went to the playground with the child while she stayed at our home and did some work (my husband helped a little, we all have the same job and work at the same company). When she left, I gave her some food I'd prepared in the morning so she doesn't have to bother cooking for the next few days.

She's super tired, sad, and questions her whole mariage, probably even her whole life. I know her husband, he also works with us and I'm friends with him, and I've always had the feeling that he doesn't treat her right, but she'd never opened up completely about what's going on behind closed doors.

Our company is always closed for the whole month of June so we're all off work or working from home at the moment. I offered to go to the zoo with her child on Wednesday when she has a doctor's appointment.

Is there anything else I can do to support her? 
Has anybody ever been in her situation and can tell me what they would've wished their friends did?

My friend supported me A LOT when I was very sick for a few months, so there's no 'too much' here.

Viva Vanilla: idk what to say other than I was wrong. I should’ve never doubted Viva Vanilla and now it’s going away soon. I could not appreciate this scent before but now I’m obsessed. My Vanilla 28 Kayli is super dark it’s almost a black purple and it smells so super heavenly I don’t even want to spray it because it took me 6months to achieve that dark juice. It smells so divine and delicious I wish I had something that smelled like this but cheaper. Viva Vanilla is exactly that!! I liked Vanilla 28 when I got it but I didn’t love it so i barely used it. Billie Eilish smells like cigarettes casino to me. Viva Vanilla smells so good. This is the most masculine I can get bc it still very sweet and vanilla but woody and deep. 

I blind bought Marshmallows Hop because come on look at it. It’s freakin adorable and who doesn’t love marshmallows right? WRONG. This was the worst smelling thing I’ve ever smelled I’ve ever smelled from bbw. This is some distorted medicinal marshmallow. I’m not a punk so I kept using it. Then i read the notes. (Idk why I didn’t do that before). You know what now it doesn’t smell so bad it matches the notes. Orange syrup with medicine herbal marshmallow root. That’s what it smells like. 

Beach Blanket smells amazing and the projection from the diffuser is strong. I had it on med strength in my bedroom and it filled up the hall way too almost to the kitchen. It’s true to the notes.

We loved each other so much, it was like a fairytale. We started living together 7 months into relationship and that’s when things got wrong turn. Mostly I caused some bad fights about things in our apartment like his cat jumping on staff etc. But we eventually made up and it was good, even loving, until there was another fight. I now realize how tired he must have been cause of those fights… how much I regret it. I would say to him some really hurtful words but immediately regretted it and apologized like crazy.

One day, we had one last big fight. I’ve had some alcohol, was very angry at him over quite small thing and told him some really really hurtful stuff. I regretted immediately. I kept apologizing for days. But it was over for him. He was so sad, told me he’s been talking about all possible outcomes (giving me chance or not) but ended up breaking up. 

So here’s the thing. I came to conclusion that all of this my behavior comes from excessive drinking and therefore not controlling my emotions. I’ve gone sober since day one of the breakup and I’m undergoing therapy soon to start working with my anger issues. I told him. 

I’ve decided to become better version of myself. The one I can see in the mirror and be proud of and someone who would my ex deserve. He doesn’t deserve the old me. I’ve started running daily and I’m living better lifestyle. 

He was crushed. I was crushed. When we were saying goodbye, we both were incredibly sad, we still loved each other but he couldn’t bare it anymore and I needed this to realize what should I do with my life. I needed this to pick myself together. Which I now take very seriously. I was apologizing to him so much, but he said he can’t take that back. But still hugged me and told me he still has feelings for me.

The question I have now. When we broke up he told me he doesn’t want to get back. Which I understood but crushed me. But he suggested on grabbing some coffee in the future and talking about things. I even have to come to his apartment to pick up rest of the things in the future so there will be some contact. But we are in no contact right now. Not blocked, but don’t text each other. But I believe he might be in touch with my family (they agreed on it). 

Our mutual fried told me yesterday she talked to him and that he is totally crushed but still says no to any chance in the future. But my question is,

Is it possible that his emotions might settle in as time goes on? That his today’s “no” might become “maybe”? That the memories on bad moments might start to hurt less and memories on good times (there’s plenty, majority) might crawl onto the surface and he might see things from a better perspective? That he realizes one day that his bed is empty, he dines alone and doesn’t have anyone close to talk to him about how his day went? That when he sees my growth after some time apart, he might change his mind?

## Key features Analysis

The selection of the ideal coffee trailer hinges on several key features that directly affect its functionality, durability, and suitability for your business operations.**trailer Size and Layout:** The size and layout of a coffee trailer are critical factors determining its operational efficiency. A larger trailer provides more space for equipment, storage, and staff movement, but requires a larger towing vehicle and parking space. A well-designed layout optimizes workflow, allowing baristas to prepare and serve drinks efficiently, minimizing bottlenecks and maximizing customer throughput. Consider the accessibility of equipment and storage, ensuring that frequently used items are within easy reach.The dimensions of the trailer are often dictated both by the amount of space available and by permit requirements. Many locations limit both trailer length and width to ensure easy maneuverability and safe parking.

**Equipment Capacity and integration:** A coffee trailer is only as good as the equipment it houses.evaluate the trailer's capacity to accommodate essential coffee-making equipment, including espresso machines, grinders, brewers, refrigerators, and point-of-sale systems. Ensure that the trailer's electrical system and plumbing can support the power and water requirements of these appliances.

The configuration and installation of equipment is a key factor. Check to ensure there is sufficient ventilation and proper placement.

**Construction Materials and Durability:** The longevity and reliability of your coffee trailer depend heavily on the quality of its construction materials. Look for trailers built with durable materials like stainless steel, aluminum, or fiberglass for the exterior, as these are resistant to rust and corrosion. A sturdy frame is essential for safe towing and structural integrity. The flooring should be slip-resistant and easy to clean. high-quality insulation will help maintain a consistent temperature inside the trailer,reducing energy consumption and improving the comfort of your baristas.

Weather resistance is an essential aspect to consider as well. Evaluate how well weather elements such as heavy rain, wind, and extreme temperatures will be kept out.

**Mobility and Towing Capabilities:** The ease with which you can move and position your coffee trailer is a notable consideration, especially if you plan to operate at multiple locations. Consider the trailer's weight, axle configuration, and hitch type to ensure compatibility with your towing vehicle. Look for trailers with features like electric brakes, safety chains, and working lights to enhance safety during transport.An critically important feature to evaluate is ease of setup once you arrived at your location. Can the awning be extended easily? Are there adjustable leveling systems to ensure your trailer is stable?

**Water and Electrical Systems:** reliable water and electrical systems are essential for operating a coffee trailer. Assess the trailer's water tank capacity, pump system, and water heater to ensure that you have an adequate supply of hot and cold water for brewing coffee and cleaning equipment. The electrical system should include a generator or shore power hookup with sufficient amperage to power all of your appliances and equipment.

Investigating the quality and safety of systems is of the utmost importance. Ensure these systems are compliant with all relevant regulations.

## Core Benefits

Owning a well-equipped coffee trailer offers several significant benefits for aspiring entrepreneurs.

**Flexibility and Mobility:** Unlike a brick-and-mortar coffee shop, a coffee trailer provides unparalleled flexibility and mobility. You can move your business to high-traffic locations, events, and markets, capitalizing on opportunities as they arise. This mobility allows you to test different locations and target specific customer segments.

The ability to set up shop where demand is highest provides a significant advantage. By being ""on the move"", a dedicated barista can potentially reach more clientele than if they were to stay in one location.

**Lower Startup Costs:** Compared to opening a customary coffee shop, a coffee trailer can considerably reduce startup costs.The expenses associated with leasing or purchasing a building, renovations, and extensive build-out are eliminated. This lower barrier to entry allows entrepreneurs with limited capital to enter the coffee industry.

This also helps with potential seasonal issues. For example, if you do business near a college campus, you can move your trailer elsewhere during summer breaks and holidays.

**Direct Customer Engagement:** A coffee trailer provides a unique possibility for direct customer engagement. Baristas can interact with customers, build relationships, and create a loyal following. This personal connection can differentiate your business from larger coffee chains.You can gather valuable feedback by directly asking customers specific details that cater to what they want.in addition, coffee trailers allow owners to be more creative with their menu.

**Branding and Customization:** A coffee trailer offers a blank canvas for branding and customization. You can design the exterior and interior to reflect your unique brand identity, creating a memorable and visually appealing experience for customers. This customization extends to the menu, allowing you to offer specialty coffee drinks and food items that cater to your target market.This also allows entrepreneurs to express themselves creatively. Customers who enjoy what you do may value your brand identity and continue contributing to its overall success.

## FAQs Section

**What type of licensing and permits are required to operate a coffee trailer?**

Operating a coffee trailer typically requires several licenses and permits, including a business license, a food handler's permit, a mobile food vendor's permit, and potentially a health department permit. The specific requirements vary depending on the location and local regulations. Researching and obtaining all necessary permits before starting your business is crucial.

**How much does it cost to operate a coffee trailer on a monthly basis?**

the monthly operating costs of a coffee trailer vary depending on factors such as location, sales volume, and staffing. Common expenses include rent for parking spaces, utilities (electricity, water), inventory (coffee beans, milk, cups), marketing, insurance, and employee wages.

**What are the insurance requirements for owning a coffee trailer?**

Coffee trailer owners typically need to obtain several types of insurance, including general liability insurance, commercial auto insurance, and workers' compensation insurance (if you have employees). General liability insurance protects your business from claims of bodily injury or property damage. Commercial auto insurance covers accidents involving your trailer and towing vehicle.Workers' compensation insurance covers medical expenses and lost wages for employees who are injured on the job.

1l6yyp8,https://i.redd.it/qiya9fkjxu5f1.jpeg,How i spent my weekend with my wives,"My day started with Psy waking me up (she gets up first out of all of us), so I took a quick shower with her and got ready. While Psy was meditating, I started working on morning tea and coffee for all of us: green tea for Psy, iced coffee for Luna, black coffee for Hela, and sweet coffee with milk for Illayana. After preparing all the drinks, I joined Psy and meditated. Then we both shared some green tea. She started getting ready for hunting while I served breakfast in bed upstairs. I kissed Luna, Hela, and Illayana before leaving with Psy to hunt.

The hunt was slow today, and we only caught one boar and a few fish. Then we returned home, and Psy started filleting the fish and the boar for lunch, while Illayana snatched me away to ""SPAR"" with her. After some hardcore training, she finally let me go, and then Luna dragged me to her in-house studio where she taught me some dance moves, saying, ""You have to dance at my next concert with me or else I am cancelling it."" I would have danced either way since it was with her, but I definitely couldn't say no after that.

Psy needed some stuff for lunch, so Hela and I went out to get them. On the way, an arcade caught her attention, and Hela, being Hela, said, ""Mortal, I wish to find out what's inside."" So I visited the arcade with her—after all, how could I say no to my queen? She really liked a rabbit plushie, but she couldn't grab it and was about to destroy the whole place. So I intervened and got her the plushie with my epic gaming skills. Then we went home, and all four of us started helping Psy cook lunch (Hela was just bossing around, but don't tell her).

After having this lovely lunch, we all went to the amusement park at Illayana's request and had lots of fun there (I’ll maybe give the details in the next episode if I ever make one). We all got pretty tired after frolicking around all day, so we decided to jump in the hot spring and relax (Psy got pretty flustered). After I washed everyone's back, we all got out of the hot spring, changed into our night suits, and went to sleep cuddling each other.

That's it for this episode. If you want more, tell me—if not, I don't really care. See ya, bye!

Day 1: Relax around hotel and explore Fontaine Bianche and any nearby towns/beaches for a little bit.

Day 5: Relax at our hotel in Giarre and explore the town/beach.

Day 6: Visit Taormina.

*We’ll also visit Mount Etna, but not sure which day.*

We may also visit Syracuse but I’ve heard driving and parking can be quite tough. So was considering maybe driving to the train stop and getting a train to the city!

Does anyone have any feedback or even better, any more recommendations for us? We really just want some nice food, coffee and to explore :)

We both work, but I have more flexible job and work hours because my boss thinks that I should have more relaxed working environment especially since I became pregnant, but the income my husband brings home is much larger than what I earn, and he does have more strict hours, more overtime and more business trips than I. I also understand that my husband has a need to spend some time alone, he is just a type of a person that likes to be alone from time to time, and I can understand that because I also sometimes would rather be alone than interact with other people. We have talked about this need of his before and I said that I understand and that I would just like from him to inform me in advance when he would be planning on spending his time by himself so I could also plan some other activities with friends or plan on something else.
That being said, last few weeks have been a bit hectic because we had alot of work to do with cleaning one of our apartments, work related stress, there were also holidays where we had to visit alot of his and mine family etc. So yesterday (which was Sunday) he told me that he was planing on going to ride his brother's motorbike and go to drink coffee in a coffeeshop alone. To be honest I was a bit taken back because I thought we would be spending some time together especially since we had so much obligations and work to finish, and I was on a worktrip for 5 days a week before so we really didn't get to spend any quality time with eachother. He got mad and asked me do we have to spend all of the time toghether, he even asked me am I an adult that has a capacity to spend time individualy away from him, which really hurt me deeply. I tried to explain to him that the time spent together that he is referring to is not a quality time, we were ""forced"" to spend that time together to finish work that we had to do. I also told him that he has time to take his friends out to dinner but not his wife to which he responded that he took me to cinema (to see mission impossible which I don't even like).
So now I am here on reddit writing to strangers because I don't talk to my husband because I feel so hurt and mad at him, and he is not talking to me because he thinks he is right...The thing is I have so much friends and so much things I could do that I could stay outside of the house all day every day but I just like spending time with him, and it hurts me that he doesn't feel the same way about me...Now I am thinking wether I am overreacting because I am hormonal because of my pregnancy or do I really have a right to feel this way?",1,1749455457.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

## FAQs Section

This section addresses several frequently asked questions regarding half and half creamers, offering clear and concise data to help consumers make informed decisions.

**What is the difference between half and half,milk,and heavy cream?**
Half and half is a blend of milk and cream,containing between 10.5% and 18% milk fat. Milk has a lower fat content, typically around 3.5% for whole milk, while heavy cream has a significantly higher fat content, usually around 36% or more. This variance in fat content accounts for the differences in taste, texture, and richness among these dairy products.

**Can half and half be frozen?**
While it is indeed possible to freeze half and half, it's not recommended due to potential changes in texture.Freezing can cause the fats to separate, resulting in a grainy or clumpy consistency upon thawing. If freezing is necessary, it should be done in small portions and used primarily in cooked applications rather than as a beverage creamer.

**Are there any sugar-free or low-carb half and half options?**
Yes, there are sugar-free and low-carb half and half options available.Some brands offer versions that use alternative sweeteners or have naturally lower carbohydrate content. Check the nutrition labels carefully to ensure the product meets specific dietary needs and preferences, especially if managing blood sugar levels or following a ketogenic diet.

**How should half and half be stored to maximize its shelf life?**
Half and half should be stored in the refrigerator at a temperature between 33°F and 40°F (0.5°C and 4.4°C). Once opened, it should be used within seven to ten days for the best quality. Ultra-pasteurized (UHT) half and half can be stored unopened at room temperature until its expiration date but should be refrigerated once opened.

I sat alone on the edge of the paper-covered table, the crinkle beneath me the only sound besides my shallow breathing. My fingers trembled as I held the pathology report, the medical terminology blurring through my tears. ""Late-stage gastric carcinoma."" I read those words again and again, as if repetition might somehow change their meaning. Dr. Carter had just stepped out, giving me a moment to process the news. His voice had been gentle, compassionate even, as he explained what the diagnosis meant. But all I could hear now was the thundering of my own heartbeat in my ears. Cancer. Terminal cancer.A tear slid down my cheek, landing on the paper and blurring the ink. I wiped it away with my thumb, smudging the word ""inoperable"" into a gray smear. How was I supposed to tell Ethan? How would I explain this to Jamie, my sweet, innocent six-year-old boy?

""Mrs. Caldwell?"" Dr. Carter's voice broke through my thoughts as he re-entered the room. ""Is there someone I can call for you? You shouldn't be alone right now.""

I shook my head, folding the papers with shaking hands. ""My husband... he's working. I'll be fine.""

The lie came easily. Ethan wasn't working. He was probably with her—with Vanessa. But I couldn't bring myself to admit that to this kind doctor who looked at me with such genuine concern.

""We'll start treatment as soon as possible,"" he continued, sitting down across from me. ""I know this is overwhelming, but you're not alone in this fight.""

If only that were true.

The drive home felt surreal, as if I were watching someone else navigate the familiar streets of our Boston suburb. The autumn leaves swirled across the road, red and gold against the gray pavement—beautiful in their dying. I clutched the steering wheel tighter, forcing myself to focus.

When I pulled into our driveway, Ethan's car was already there. A small, foolish part of me felt a flicker of hope. Maybe, just maybe, when faced with this, he would remember the man I'd fallen in love with seven years ago.

I found him in the living room, sprawled on the couch, scrolling through his phone. The television murmured in the background, though he wasn't watching it. He didn't look up when I entered.

""Where's Jamie?"" I asked, my voice barely audible.

""At the Wilsons'. Playdate."" His response was clipped, distracted....

I stood there for a moment, the pathology report clutched against my chest like a shield. Then, summoning what little courage I had left, I crossed the room and placed the papers on the coffee table in front of him.

""Ethan, I need to talk to you.""

He glanced up, irritation flashing across his face before his eyes fell to the medical letterhead. For a brief moment, something like concern crossed his features. Then his expression hardened.

""Not this again,"" he scoffed, pushing the papers away without reading them. He stood up, pocketing his phone. ""I'm not doing this dramatic victim routine with you today, Julia.""

He walked away without a second glance, leaving the report—leaving me—behind.

\---

Jamie's laughter filled the kitchen as I set his dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets on the table. I forced a smile, determined not to let my son see the hollowness I felt inside. He deserved better than that.

""Mommy, can I have extra ketchup? Please?"" His eyes, so like mine, looked up hopefully.

""Of course, sweetheart."" I squeezed a generous dollop onto his plate, earning a delighted giggle.

Ethan sat across from us, his attention fixed on his phone, thumbs tapping out messages to someone who made him smile in ways I no longer could. The distance between us at the small kitchen table felt infinite.

When his phone rang, he didn't even pretend it might be work. He simply stood, answered with a warm ""Hey,"" and stepped outside onto the back porch.

I watched through the window as Ethan's face transformed. The hard lines around his mouth softened, his eyes crinkled with genuine pleasure. He laughed—a sound I hadn't heard directed at me in months, maybe years.

""Mommy?"" Jamie's small voice pulled me back. He had stopped eating, his fork suspended mid-air, his gaze following mine to his father outside.

""Yes, baby?"" I brushed his hair back from his forehead, trying to focus on him instead of the scene beyond the glass.

Jamie's eyes, wise beyond his years, shifted between me and Ethan. ""Why doesn't Daddy smile at us like that anymore?""

My heart shattered into a thousand pieces.

Chapter 2

The hospital's chemotherapy ward was quieter than I expected. Hushed voices, the occasional beep of machines, and the soft squeak of nurses' shoes against linoleum created a strange, muted symphony. I sat alone in a recliner, my fingers wrapped tightly around the cold metal of the IV pole beside me.

""First time?""

I looked up to see an elderly man across from me, his wife clutching his hand as a nurse adjusted his IV. They exchanged a look of such profound understanding that I had to glance away, the intimacy of their silent communication too painful to witness.

All around me, patients had someone. A husband reading aloud from a novel. A daughter showing her mother photos on her phone. A friend simply being there, offering the quiet comfort of presence.

I had no one.

My chest tightened as I watched a woman about my age enter with her husband. He carried her bag, helped her settle into a chair, then kissed her forehead before speaking softly to the nurse. Such a simple gesture. Such an impossible luxury.

A tear slipped down my cheek before I could stop it, followed quickly by another. I wiped them away with trembling fingers, but more fell to replace them.

""Oh, honey."" A nurse appeared beside me, her name tag reading 'Sarah Evans.' She pressed a tissue into my hand. ""The first treatment is always scary, but you're doing great. These meds will make you feel awful before they make you feel better, but we're all here for you.""

She misunderstood. It wasn't the chemo I feared—it was facing it alone.

""Thank you,"" I managed, not correcting her assumption. What could I say? My husband couldn't be bothered to drive me? He thinks I'm being dramatic about having cancer?

As the toxic medicine designed to save me dripped slowly into my veins, I closed my eyes and pretended I could feel Ethan's hand in mine.

\---

The house was quiet when I returned home, exhaustion weighing on me like a physical presence. Jamie would be at school for another two hours—enough time to pay some bills before the nausea hit in full force.

I settled at the kitchen table with my laptop, the familiar routine offering a small comfort. Opening our joint bank account, I expected to see our modest savings—enough for at least a few months of mortgage payments while I underwent treatment.

The screen loaded, and I blinked, certain I was seeing things wrong. I refreshed the page.

$0.00

A strangled sound escaped my throat as I clicked through to the transaction history. A single withdrawal—all of it—three days ago.

With shaking hands, I opened my email. There it was, sent yesterday while I was preparing for today's treatment:

\*I used the savings. Don't call me for money.\*

Five years of careful budgeting. Every extra dollar tucked away for emergencies. For Jamie's future. Gone.

My phone buzzed with a text from the pharmacy: \*Your prescription is ready for pickup. Amount due: $387.00\*

The room spun around me as the implications sank in. No savings. No income while I couldn't work. And now, medication I couldn't afford.

\---

The smell of burning toast jerked me awake. I'd fallen asleep on the couch after picking Jamie up from school, my body betraying me with a fatigue so profound it felt like drowning.

""Jamie!"" I called out, struggling to my feet. The kitchen timer showed 7:15 AM. School. Breakfast. I'd slept through the night on the couch.

I stumbled into the kitchen to find my six-year-old standing on a chair at the stove, a slice of blackened bread smoking in the pan.

""I'm making breakfast,"" he announced proudly, though his lower lip trembled. ""You were sleeping so hard, Mommy.""

""Oh, baby."" I hurried over, turning off the burner. ""Thank you, but you know you're not supposed to use the stove.""

""But you didn't wake up when I called you."" His small voice was edged with fear.

The room tilted suddenly, black spots dancing at the edges of my vision. I gripped the counter, willing myself to stay upright, but my knees buckled. I slid to the floor, Jamie's frightened face swimming above me.

""I'm okay,"" I whispered, though we both knew it was a lie. ""Just get the cereal instead, okay?""

Jamie nodded solemnly, climbing down from the chair to retrieve a box of Cheerios from the pantry. I watched, still unable to stand, as he carefully poured cereal into two bowls, his tongue caught between his teeth in concentration.

When he reached for the milk, the heavy carton slipped from his small hands, splashing across the kitchen floor and soaking his pajama bottoms.

""I'm sorry!"" he cried, looking from the spreading puddle to my face with panic.

Before I could reassure him, the front door slammed. Ethan's footsteps approached rapidly, then stopped at the kitchen entrance.

""What the hell is this?"" he demanded, taking in the scene—me on the floor, Jamie standing in spilled milk, the burnt toast still smoking on the stove.

Chapter 3

""What the hell is this?"" Ethan demanded, taking in the scene—me on the floor, Jamie standing in spilled milk, the burnt toast still smoking on the stove.

I opened my mouth to explain, but no words came. Jamie's small body trembled beside me, his eyes wide with fear.

Ethan shook his head in disgust. ""I can't even leave for one night without coming back to this disaster."" He stepped carefully around the milk puddle, his shoes squeaking against the tile. ""Get up, Julia. Stop being so dramatic.""

I gripped the edge of the counter, pulling myself to my feet despite the room spinning around me. ""Jamie was just trying to help,"" I managed, my voice barely audible.

Ethan ignored me, checking his watch with an exaggerated sigh. ""I have a meeting. Clean this up."" He turned to leave, then paused, glancing back at Jamie. ""And get him to school on time for once.""

The front door slammed moments later. I slid back to the floor, pulling Jamie into my arms as he started to cry.

""It's okay, baby,"" I whispered into his hair. ""It's okay.""

\---

At my next oncology appointment, I sat with my hands folded in my lap, staring at the abstract painting on Dr. Carter's office wall. Blue and gray swirls that reminded me of drowning.

""Mrs. Caldwell?"" Dr. Carter's voice pulled me back to the present. ""Julia?""

I blinked, realizing he'd been speaking to me. ""I'm sorry, what?""

He studied me for a moment, then checked his watch and set down my chart. ""We have some time. How are you really doing?""

Something in his gentle tone broke through the wall I'd carefully constructed. My eyes filled with tears before I could stop them.

""I'm managing,"" I lied, my voice cracking.

Dr. Carter leaned forward slightly, his eyes kind. ""You don't have to manage alone.""

The words tumbled out before I could stop them. ""My husband thinks I'm being dramatic. He took our savings. He's barely home, and when he is..."" I swallowed hard. ""He's not really there.""

Dr. Carter didn't interrupt, didn't offer empty platitudes. He simply listened, his presence steady and compassionate.

""I'm sorry,"" I finally said, embarrassed by my outburst. ""This isn't your problem.""

""Your well-being is very much my concern,"" he replied softly. ""Cancer treatment isn't just physical. The emotional support is crucial.""

For the first time in months, someone was actually seeing me. The realization made my chest ache with a bittersweet relief.

""Do you have anyone else? Family? Friends?"" he asked.

I shook my head. ""We moved for Ethan's job. My parents are gone. It's just..."" My voice caught. ""It's just Jamie and me, really.""

Dr. Carter nodded, his eyes reflecting a sadness that matched my own. ""Then we'll need to build you a support system here. Starting with me.""

\---

Two days later, I was tidying the living room when I found it—a diamond earring nestled deep in the couch cushions. Not mine. I never owned anything so expensive.

I held it up to the light, watching it sparkle. Such a small thing to confirm what I'd known for months. Vanessa had been here, in my home.

That night, I placed the earring on Ethan's pillow. No note, no confrontation. Just silent evidence of what we both knew.

When he came to bed hours later, I pretended to be asleep. Through barely-open eyes, I watched him pause at the sight of the earring. He pocketed it without a word, then slipped back out of the bedroom.

The front door closed softly minutes later. He didn't come home that night.

\---

The next afternoon, the chemo-induced exhaustion hit me like a freight train. I dozed off on the couch while Jamie played quietly with his toys nearby.

I jerked awake sometime later, the silence of the house suddenly oppressive.

""Jamie?"" I called, my voice hoarse with sleep. No answer.

Panic surged through me as I staggered to my feet. ""Jamie!""

The back door stood slightly ajar, swinging gently in the breeze. I stumbled outside, scanning the yard frantically.

Then I saw it—Jamie's favorite toy boat drifting in the center of our small backyard pool.

My heart stopped.

Without thinking, I dove in, the cold water shocking my system. Through the chlorine blur, I saw him—my beautiful boy, floating motionless beneath the surface.

Ice water crashed over my bed, jerking me from another nightmare-filled sleep. My body seized from the shock, my vision going dark as I gasped for breath. For a terrifying moment, everything went silent except for the high-pitched ringing in my ears.

""You really thought you could sleep in, you little bitch?""

Before I could even process what was happening, fingers tangled in my hair, yanking me from my soaked mattress and throwing me to the cold concrete floor. My head smacked against the ground, sending stars across my vision.

Eva stood over me, her petite frame somehow looming large in the dim light of the slave quarters.

Perfect makeup highlighted her doll-like features, her tiny red dress already prepared for the day ahead. The look of disgust on her face was one I knew all too well.

""You don't deserve peaceful sleep,"" she spat, digging the pointed toe of her stiletto into my ribs. ""Not after killing your own parents. God, you're pathetic.""

I lay there like a slab of meat, waiting for the inevitable. Eva crouched down, her manicured nails scraping across my exposed skin as she violently ripped at my already threadbare shirt.

""Let's see how you try to seduce Kevin with these,"" she hissed, her sharp nails digging into the flesh of my nipples, breaking the skin. Blood welled up around her fingertips as she dragged them down. ""I'll destroy these fucking tits. Then we'll see if you still think you're his mate.""

The pain was excruciating, but I didn't cry out. I'd learned long ago that showing pain only made everything worse. Instead, I closed my eyes, hoping to find some escape in the darkness behind my eyelids. My tears had dried up months ago.

My body felt frighteningly weak beneath her assault. Each blow sent waves of dizziness through me, and I wondered if this time might be the end. Was I gonna die? I felt myself slipping toward unconsciousness, floating at the edge of awareness.

An eternity later, the blows stopped. Eva's footsteps echoed as she walked away, satisfied with her morning ritual. I forced my eyes open, immediately locking gazes with a passing servant girl.

The revulsion on her face was unmistakable as she quickly looked away and hurried past.

I lay in a heap on the floor, my shirt hanging in tatters around me, exposing skin even my nipples mottled with fresh bruises layered atop older ones in varying shades of purple, green, and yellow.

Not an inch of my body remained unmarked by Eva's regular ""attention.""

Closing my eyes again, I refused to acknowledge the servants passing by. They wouldn't help. Nobody ever did. As if this kind of humiliating behavior was normal and common.

With trembling arms, I pushed myself up from the ground, nearly collapsing again as my muscles screamed in protest. I couldn't afford to rest, not even for a minute. If I failed to complete my chores, what awaited would be far worse than Eva's morning greeting.

I stumbled to the single wooden chest that contained my only other shirt—equally worn but at least not soaking wet and torn to shreds. As I changed, I nervously glanced around the room.

The other slaves continued their morning routines, faces carefully blank. This scene played out nearly every day. No one had the energy or will to care anymore.

Our quarters were barely habitable—a damp, moldy basement with cracked walls where weeds pushed through in places. Insects skittered across the floor, drawn to the perpetual dampness.

Each slave had just a thin wooden plank raised slightly off the ground as a bed, with threadbare blankets that did almost nothing against the constant chill. Mine was even thinner than the others, thanks to Eva's special treatment.

A single ray of sunlight managed to penetrate our underground prison through a tiny window near the ceiling. By some miracle, it fell directly across my face, offering a momentary warmth that felt like the gentlest touch. I closed my eyes, savoring the brief respite.

If only last month hadn't happened that...

Flash Back: One Month Before

The night air was cool against my skin as I finished scrubbing the last of the kitchen floors. My muscles ached from another endless day of labor, but something made me pause as I dumped the dirty water outside.

A scent.

I'd never smelled anything like it before—sweet vanilla mingled with something earthier, like sun-warmed grass. The aroma tugged at something deep inside me, drawing me forward despite my exhaustion.

I followed it, step by hesitant step, away from the compound and toward the edge of the forest.

The trees loomed dark and mysterious, their branches creating intricate patterns against the starlit sky. The scent grew stronger, pulling me deeper into the woods.

My heart pounded in my chest. I'd overheard the other servants whispering about this—how when you meet your true mate, you detect a unique, intoxicating scent that no one else can quite describe. Some smelled vanilla, others lavender, still others the rich earthiness of forest soil.

Could this be happening to me? My face flushed hot with excitement and hope. I didn't have a wolf—how could I possibly have a mate? But the scent was undeniable, growing stronger with each step I took.

As I moved deeper into the forest, following that irresistible trail, a strange sensation began to build in my chest. At first, it was just warmth, but it quickly transformed into something else—something painful. A burning ache spread from my heart outward, as though someone had thrust a hot poker through my ribs.

The closer I got to the source of the scent, the more intense the pain became. It felt like a wolf was tearing through my chest cavity, shredding everything in its path. Was this normal? Was this what finding your mate felt like?

My steps grew smaller, more hesitant. I pressed a hand against a nearby tree, its rough bark cool against my burning skin, providing momentary relief.

Dizzy and disoriented, I clutched my chest with one hand while using the other to steady myself against the trees as I continued forward. The forest was eerily quiet, until it wasn't.

A woman's moan broke the silence, followed by a deep, masculine growl.

Had I imagined it? The pain in my chest was making it hard to think clearly.

Avery

I pushed forward, following both the scent and now the sounds, until I reached a small clearing bathed in moonlight. What I saw there froze the blood in my veins.

My enemy girl Eva was completely naked, straddling Kevin—our pack's Beta—as she rode him with wild abandon. Her hands were tangled in his wet hair, her head thrown back in ecstasy.

Despite the cool night, their bodies glistened with sweat in the moonlight.

""Fuck, Kevin, you feel so goddamn good,"" she moaned, grinding her hips against him. ""Tell me who you belong to.""

""You,"" he groaned, his hands gripping her hips so tightly I could see his fingers digging into her flesh. The rose tattoo on her thigh seemed to dance with each movement, while the skull tattoos on his muscular arms flexed with his every motion. ""Fuck, Eva, only you.""

""That's right,"" she purred, leaning down to bite his lip hard enough to draw blood.

I clamped my hand over my mouth so hard my nails dug into my skin, drawing blood. I couldn't make a sound. Couldn't let them know I was there.

But the pain in my chest was crippling now, making it impossible to run away. All I could do was hide behind the massive oak tree and witness the desecration of what should have been sacred.

*Why, Moon Goddess?* I silently pleaded. *Why would you make him my mate if he belongs to her? Why torment me like this?*

I slid down the trunk until I was curled into a ball on the forest floor, silent tears streaming down my face.

Each thrust, each moan sent fresh waves of agony through my body. The connection between mates meant I could physically feel his pleasure—pleasure he was experiencing with someone else.

Their passionate encounter seemed to last forever. Eventually, the obscene sounds subsided, replaced by tender whispers and soft laughter. Eva snuggled into Kevin's arms, nuzzling her small nose against his neck.

Kevin was smiling contentedly, eyes half-closed—until suddenly they shot open wide with shock.

He sniffed the air, his entire body tensing. When he spoke, his voice was rough with disbelief.

""Mine!""

Eva's face twisted with confusion, her perfect features scrunching up as she stared at Kevin. ""What did you say, babe?""

Kevin didn't even acknowledge her. His chest heaved with rapid breaths, nostrils flaring wide as he sniffed the air. His eyes narrowed to dangerous slits.

""Who is there?"" he growled, voice dropping to a guttural register that made my blood freeze in my veins.

I pressed my trembling body harder against the oak tree, praying to the Moon Goddess that the shadows would swallow me whole. My legs shook so violently I could barely remain standing. The burning pain in my chest was overwhelming, making it hard to even think straight.

Kevin's jaw clenched, muscles in his neck straining as he rose to his feet, completely naked and unashamed. ""My fist won't wait patiently for you to come out. I'm giving you three seconds! If you don't show your fucking face, I'll kill you myself!""

The cold brutality in his voice made me whimper involuntarily. This was my mate? This cruel, heartless monster who'd just been with another woman? The connection between us pulsed painfully, like an open wound being salted.

Eva scrambled to grab her tiny dress, panic written all over her face. ""What? There's someone fucking watching us?"" She looked around wildly, trying to cover herself. ""Who the hell is out there?""

Kevin yanked on his jeans but left them unbuttoned, his sculpted torso still gleaming with sweat in the moonlight. The skulls tattooed across his muscular arms seemed to grin at me mockingly.

""Five seconds have passed already! You still not planning to come out?"" His black eyes glittered with predatory coldness, scanning the treeline. I knew he could sense exactly where I was hiding.

Fighting through waves of nausea and pain, I clutched my chest and forced myself to stand. My legs felt like they might buckle at any moment. Taking a deep breath that felt like inhaling broken glass, I stepped out from behind the tree.

Eva's eyes widened dramatically, her perfectly plucked eyebrows shooting up toward her hairline. ""Look who we have here!"" she spat, venom dripping from every word. ""What's the murderer doing out here spying on us, you fucking—""

Before she could finish, Kevin cut her off with a raised hand. His black eyes locked onto mine, and I saw nothing there—no warmth, no recognition, no bond. Just cold, empty hatred.

""I, Kevin, Beta of the Blood Moon Pack, reject you, Avery, a slave of the Blood Moon, as my fated mate and future wife!""

Each word was like a physical blow. His face contorted with disgust as he spoke, as if my very existence revolted him. The ceremonial rejection words hung in the air between us, heavy and final.

As the last syllable left his lips, blinding pain erupted inside me. It felt like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my ribcage, pulverizing my organs from the inside out. My knees gave way as I collapsed to the forest floor, gasping for breath that wouldn't come.

Kevin, wholly unmoved by my suffering, turned back to Eva. He pulled her against his chest, his hands roaming possessively over her body as he whispered something in her ear that made her giggle. He began kissing her neck, working his way down her body while staring directly at me, making sure I witnessed every touch.

Eva met my gaze over Kevin's shoulder, her eyes gleaming with triumph. ""You better run along now,"" she moaned deliberately, arching her back as Kevin's mouth found her nipples and bite it. ""You'd better pray you don't... *mmm*... run into us in the pack... oh god, babe..."" The last part was directed at Kevin, who had begun to focus his attention on her again.

I couldn't move, couldn't tear my eyes away from the horrific scene.

Kevin glanced at me sidelong, his black eyes like bottomless pits. As his finger continued fucking Eva's snatch, he flashed me a smile that belonged on a demon—cruel, taunting, and utterly pitiless.

Avery

With Eva's moans as background, something inside me finally snapped. Despite my weakened state, I scrambled to my feet and ran. The mate bond had been severed by his rejection, at least enough that their renewed passion no longer caused me physical pain. My body felt hollow, emptied of everything but raw grief.

I ran without direction, stumbling over roots and rocks, branches whipping against my face and arms. Each footfall was unsteady, my vision blurred by tears and pain. Several times I nearly fell, my ankle twisting painfully as I stepped into a hidden hole or tripped over a fallen branch.

Finally, my legs simply gave out. I fell hard, face first into the dirt, and this time, I had no strength left to rise. What was the point? My mate—the one person the Moon Goddess had chosen specifically for me—had rejected me with disgust and hatred.

So I lay there in the cool earth, the smell of dirt and fresh grass filling my nostrils, and I wept. I cried until my throat was raw and my voice reduced to a raspy whisper. I cried until there was nothing left inside me.

End Of Flash Back...

The earthy scent of soil and grass was still vivid in my memory as my feet carried me mindlessly toward the kitchen area. The rich aroma of breakfast foods wafted through the air—bacon sizzling, bread baking, coffee brewing—smells that would never be meant for me.

I watched as servants carried out trays loaded with steaming food: fluffy scrambled eggs, perfectly cooked bacon, stacks of pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, and fresh fruit arranged artfully on fine china plates. My stomach responded with a loud, painful growl, reminding me that I hadn't eaten since yesterday morning.

Without thinking, I paused, my tongue involuntarily running across my dry, cracked lips as saliva flooded my mouth. For a moment, I was lost in the fantasy of what it would be like to eat such a meal, to feel full and satisfied for once.

That's when I heard it.

""Where the fuck is she?""

The Beta's enraged voice cut through the kitchen's pleasant sounds like a knife. I knew immediately that Beta Kevin—my former mate—was looking for me.

In this house, there was only one person designated to serve both the Alpha and Beta exclusively—me. They had arranged it this way deliberately to torment me, the Alpha's sister and the person who had supposedly killed our parents with her own hands.

Their goal was to make me suffer without allowing me the mercy of death.

With a groan, I shifted the cleaning basket I carried and turned toward the sound of his voice.

The moment Beta Kevin spotted me, he stormed over, his face twisted with rage. Without warning, his hand slashed across my cheek with brutal force. The impact was so powerful that my right ear instantly went deaf, a high-pitched ringing replacing all sound.

I staggered but didn't fall. I'd learned long ago that falling only invited more attacks. Blood trickled from the corner of my mouth as I kept my eyes downcast, waiting for whatever would come next.

I stood frozen, not making a sound. Years of experience had taught me that silence was survival—speak only when spoken to, or risk being beaten to a pulp.

I definitely didn't need another week in the dungeon, a place more terrifying than even the basement. Every time I made a mistake, that's where they'd lock me up—sometimes for hours, sometimes half a day, once for an entire half-month.

The strangest part was always waking up with needle marks alongside my bruises and wounds. Once, I even noticed green liquid around the puncture sites. What the hell were they injecting me with? I never got answers, only more pain.

So I just trembled in place, waiting for Kevin to speak first, clutching my cleaning basket like it might somehow shield me from whatever was coming.

""Well, look what the fucking cat dragged in,"" Kevin's voice sliced through the silence. His black eyes raked over me, lingering on the places where my threadbare shirt failed to hide my skin. ""The Alpha's pathetic excuse for a sister.""

I kept my eyes down, focusing on the tiles beneath my feet. One cracked, three whole, two with stains. I'd memorized every imperfection in this floor.

""What's wrong, little wolfless? Cat got your tongue?"" He stepped closer, the leather of his jacket creaking as he moved. ""Or are you just too stupid to form words?""

I flinched when his hand shot out, grabbing my chin and forcing my face up. His touch burned against my skin.

""Answer me when I speak to you,"" he growled, his face inches from mine.

""I'm sorry, Beta Kevin,"" I whispered, the words automatic, rehearsed from countless similar encounters.

He snorted, his eyes narrowing. ""Look at you. Dressed like you've been digging through garbage."" His fingers trailed down my neck, across my collarbone, casual and possessive. ""Though I guess that's all Trevor thinks you're worth.""

My heart hammered against my ribs as his hand dipped lower, brushing over my breast. I bit my lip hard enough to taste blood, fighting to stay still.

""Not that you'd know how to dress properly anyway. Pathetic little bitch."" His lips curled into a cruel smile before he spat directly in my face.

I didn't wipe it away. I couldn't. Moving without permission would only make things worse.

""What's this?"" Kevin's interest suddenly sharpened. He grabbed the hem of my shirt and yanked it up without warning, exposing my torso to the cold air. ""Well, well, what have we here?""

My chest was covered in angry red scratch marks—Eva's handiwork. Some were deep enough to have drawn blood, now dried in dark crimson streaks across my pale skin. The fresher ones still glistened slightly.

""Fuck,"" Kevin breathed, his pupils dilating as he stared at the marks. ""Eva's been playing rough with you again, hasn't she?"" His thumb traced one of the scratches, pressing just hard enough to make me wince.

Something shifted in his expression—a dangerous hunger replacing the casual cruelty. Despite having rejected me as his mate, his body was responding to mine. I could smell the change in him, that sharp musk of arousal cutting through his usual scent.

""You know,"" he said, voice dropping lower, ""just because I didn't want you as my mate doesn't mean you're completely useless.""

His hand slid up to cup my breast roughly, fingers digging into the soft flesh. ""Maybe I should remind you what you're actually good for.""

""Please don't,"" I whispered, panic rising in my throat.

Kevin's face darkened. ""Did I fucking ask what you wanted?"" He shoved me backward until I hit the counter, pinning me there with his body.

Avery

""You don't get to say no to me. You never did.""

His mouth crashed against mine, teeth biting my lower lip hard enough to draw blood. One hand tangled painfully in my hair while the other fumbled with the button of my pants.

""Stop!"" I gasped when he pulled back for air. ""Kevin, please—""

""Shut up,"" he snarled, yanking my hair harder. ""You belong to me. Even if I rejected your pathetic ass!"" He screamed crazily. His expression was madly ugly...

His fingers dug into the waistband of my jeans, starting to pull them down. I could feel the hard press of him against my stomach, his breathing harsh and hot against my neck.

Something inside me snapped.

My hands were still clutching the cleaning basket. Without thinking, I swung it upward with every ounce of strength I possessed. It connected with Kevin's head with a sickening crack.

He staggered backward, momentarily stunned. Blood instantly began pouring from where the basket's edge had split his scalp open.

""You fucking bitch!"" he roared, touching his head and staring at the blood on his fingers in disbelief.

Time seemed to slow down. I watched as his eyes shifted from shock to murderous rage, the black irises bleeding into the whites. His shift was beginning—triggered by anger and pain.

*This is it,* I thought with a strange sense of calm. *Today is finally my death day.*

Relief washed over me like a cool wave. After years of torment, it would end. No more pain, no more humiliation, no more needles and bruises in the dark. The thought was almost... comforting.

Kevin's face contorted, bones beginning to crack and reshape beneath his skin. Blood still streamed down his face, painting half of it crimson. His lips pulled back to reveal lengthening canines.

""I'm going to tear your fucking throat out,"" he growled, the words distorted as his jaw began to change.

I didn't run. What was the point? Instead, I stood there, oddly peaceful, waiting for death to claim me at last.

*Thank god,* I thought. *My days are finally over. Thank god I'll die today.*

I closed my eyes, but the expected pain did not occur. The move in front of me stopped. One moment Kevin was raging like a predator after its prey, and the next, he froze mid-stride.

Not by choice—I could see that in the rage still burning in his eyes—but by command.

""ENOUGH!""

The roar that boomed down the hallway wasn't just loud; it carried weight, authority. Alpha voice. I recognized it immediately as my brother Trevor's.

I clutched my shirt tightly against my chest, tears welling in my eyes. The cleaning basket I'd been carrying lay on the floor, bright red blood—Kevin's blood from where I'd struck him—staining the white cloth inside.

Trevor strode toward us, his face contorted with irritation rather than concern. ""What the fuck do you think you're doing, Kevin? Have you forgotten what day it is? I won't let your stupid ass ruin my plans!""

Thank God. If Trevor hadn't used his Alpha voice to command Kevin to stop, I might be dead right now... or missing a hand, maybe a leg. The thought made me tremble harder.

Kevin's head dropped like a scolded puppy, but his eyes—those black, soulless eyes—still held defiance. Worse, there was something else there too: disappointment. Like he was annoyed at being interrupted before he could finish what he started. The thought made bile rise in my throat.

Despite being my brother, Trevor never once looked directly at me. His eyes stayed fixed on Kevin, his nostrils flaring with anger.

""This is the day we secure our alliance with Tempest Howlers,"" Trevor continued, his voice dropping to a dangerous growl. ""And you're out here chasing your dick instead of preparing.""

When he finally finished reprimanding Kevin, Trevor turned and shot me a contemptuous sidelong glance. His nostrils flared slightly as he looked down at me huddled on the floor.

""Put this bitch in the dungeon,"" he said, his voice light and dismissive, like he was ordering someone to take out the trash. ""We'll deal with her after we've finished our business...""

Kevin immediately moved toward me, his hands already reaching out. I flinched, pressing myself harder against the wall. But Trevor held up his hand, stopping him.

""You don't need to take her yourself,"" Trevor said. ""I need you beside me when I negotiate with the other Alphas."" He gestured to two guards standing nearby. ""You two, take her.""

If I didn't know better, I might have thought Trevor was protecting me from Kevin's brutality. But I knew the truth. Trevor wasn't saving me from anything—he was just postponing my suffering for his convenience.

The guards grabbed me roughly by the arms, yanking me to my feet. I didn't resist. What was the point? After Trevor and Kevin finished their meeting, I'd face whatever punishment they deemed appropriate. This was just the calm before the storm.

As they dragged me away, I caught one last glimpse of Kevin's face. The hunger there made my skin crawl. He wasn't done with me. Not by a long shot.

The ""dungeon"" was really just a glorified closet—a small, windowless room where no light could penetrate once the door closed. They didn't need chains or shackles to contain me. The darkness itself was prison enough.

""Enjoy your stay, wolfless bitch,"" one guard sneered, shoving me hard enough that I stumbled and fell to my knees on the cold concrete floor. ""Maybe this time they'll leave you in here to rot.""

""Fucking waste of space,"" the other added, spitting in my direction. ""Should've drowned you when they had the chance.""

The heavy door slammed shut behind them, plunging me into absolute darkness. The sound of their laughter faded as they walked away, leaving me alone with my worst fear.

I couldn't see my hand in front of my face. The darkness was so complete it felt like a physical weight pressing down on me. My breathing quickened, panic rising in my chest.

I crawled blindly until I found a wall, then pressed my back against it. Drawing my knees up to my chest, I wrapped my arms around my legs and made myself as small as possible. Maybe if I was small enough, the darkness wouldn't find me.

The cold from the concrete floor seeped into my bones. My body ached from Kevin's attack, bruises already forming beneath my skin. Without my wolf, without the ability to heal, every injury lasted so much longer than it should.

I closed my heavy eyelids, though it made no difference in the pitch blackness. At least with my eyes closed, I could pretend I was choosing not to see, rather than being unable to.

Exhaustion pulled at me, dragging me down into unconsciousness. My last thought before sleep claimed me was that maybe, just maybe, I wouldn't wake up this time.

Five-year-old Avery sat on the plush sofa in her father's office, tears streaming down her round cheeks as her parents' voices grew louder and angrier. Her tiny hands covered her ears, but it didn't block out the shouting.

""We need this alliance, Marcus!"" her mother yelled, slamming her palm against the desk. ""Blood Moon is vulnerable. The Crescere Pack would give us protection!""

""I will not bend the knee to another Alpha!"" her father roared back. ""Blood Moon has survived for generations without becoming someone else's lapdog!""

""Your fucking pride will be the death of us all!"" Her mother grabbed a crystal paperweight from the desk and hurled it against the wall, where it shattered. ""You think you're so powerful, but you're just a stubborn fool!""

Avery sobbed louder, terrified by the violence and anger filling the room. Neither parent seemed to notice her distress, too consumed by their argument.

Suddenly, screams erupted from outside the office. Not angry shouts like her parents', but sounds of terror and pain.

A guard burst through the door, blood streaming from a gash across his forehead. ""Alpha! We're under attack! Rogues—at least thirty of them—they've breached the south entrance!""

Her mother whirled on her father. ""You see? This is exactly what I warned you about! We could have had allies to call on!""

""Shut the fuck up, Eliza!"" he snarled, then turned to the guard. ""Mobilize everyone who can fight. Protect the core buildings.""

As the guard rushed out, more screams and the sounds of fighting grew louder. Avery's father cursed viciously, then looked at his daughter as if just remembering she was there.

Heavy footsteps pounded down the hallway toward the office. Multiple sets, moving with purpose.

""Shit!"" Her father grabbed Avery, lifting her small body effortlessly. He rushed to his massive wooden desk and yanked open the bottom drawer, removing the contents with one sweep of his arm.

""Listen to me, sweetheart,"" he whispered urgently, lowering her into the empty space. ""You need to stay here. Don't make a sound, no matter what you hear. Do you understand? Not a single sound.""

Avery nodded, her green eyes wide with terror. Her father pressed a kiss to her forehead before closing the drawer, not completely, but enough that she was hidden from view.

Through the small gap, Avery watched as the office door burst open. Three men with wild eyes and blood-covered clothes stormed in. They didn't look like the wolves from her pack. They looked... wrong. Feral.

""Well, well,"" the largest one said, grinning to reveal bloodstained teeth. ""The mighty Alpha of Blood Moon, cornered in his own office.""

What happened next burned itself into Avery's memory forever. The rogues fell upon her parents like animals. Her mother fought fiercely, clawing one rogue's face to ribbons before another drove a knife into her back. Her father managed to shift partially, his claws tearing through one attacker's throat before the others overwhelmed him.

Avery bit her own arm to keep from screaming as she watched her parents die. Blood pooled across the floor, inching toward the desk where she hid. The metallic smell filled her nostrils, making her gag.

After what seemed like hours, the rogues left, laughing and congratulating themselves on killing an Alpha pair. Silence fell over the office, broken only by the distant sounds of fighting elsewhere in the compound.

Shaking uncontrollably, Avery pushed the drawer open and crawled out. Her small feet left bloody footprints as she approached her parents' bodies.

""Mommy?"" she whispered, touching her mother's cooling hand. ""Daddy?""

Neither answered. Neither would ever answer again.

Avery's gaze fell on the machete one of the rogues had left behind, its blade coated with her parents' blood. In her grief-stricken mind, a terrible thought formed. If her parents were gone, she wanted to be with them.

Her tiny fingers wrapped around the handle, lifting it with difficulty. She sat on the floor beside her parents, the weapon across her lap, trying to find the courage to use it on herself.

As rain began to pound against the windows, Avery wept, unaware that her eyes had begun to glow a brilliant, unnatural red.

Hours later, Trevor returned from a diplomatic mission to find Blood Moon in ruins. Half the pack dead or injured, the Alpha pair murdered. Following the trail of carnage, he arrived at the office with several pack members.

What they found was little Avery sitting in a pool of blood, clutching a machete, her parents' mutilated bodies beside her. When she looked up at their entrance, Trevor's face twisted in horror.

""Her eyes!"" gasped one of the wolves behind him. ""Red eyes! The mark of the Demon Wolf! The legends say a wolf with red eyes brings nothing but death!""

Trevor stared at his sister, as everyone believed—with a mixture of fear and revulsion. The little girl dropped the machete with a clatter, her bloody hands trembling.

""Lock her in the dungeon,"" Trevor ordered, his voice shaking. ""Now!""

For the next two years, Avery lived in darkness, feared and isolated. Until Trevor met a witch who offered a solution—a ritual that would bind Avery's wolf and suppress her memories.

At seven years old, Avery was released from the dungeon, with no memory of her parents or how they died. But the pack made sure she knew one thing: she had killed them with her own hands.

And so began years of abuse at the hands of Trevor, Kevin, and later Eva—punishment for a crime she couldn't remember committing, trauma layered upon trauma until she became the broken, fearful creature she was today.

The sleek black SUV glided through the winding forest roads, tires crunching over fallen pine needles. I sat in the back seat, my thoughts racing faster than the scenery passing by the tinted windows. Ethan, my Beta, was behind the wheel, his eyes occasionally flicking to the rearview mirror to catch my expression.

""So Blood Moon reached out to us,"" Ethan said, breaking the comfortable silence. ""They want protection from the big bad Alpha King."" His tone carried that hint of sarcasm I'd grown accustomed to over the years.

""They're desperate,"" I replied, watching the trees grow denser as we ventured deeper into the wilderness. ""After that rogue attack seventeen years ago, they've been scrambling for allies. Lost most of their pack.""

""And you're just... what? Using this as an excuse to check out their females?"" Ethan raised an eyebrow, his eyes meeting mine in the mirror.

I shrugged. ""I've visited every other pack within five hundred miles. Blood Moon is the only one I haven't had a reason to inspect personally.""

The truth was, I was running out of options. At thirty-five, I'd spent nearly two decades searching for my true mate. Every Alpha King needed a Luna, and I'd be damned if mine was hiding in some obscure pack I'd overlooked.

""Maybe the Moon Goddess just hates your guts,"" Ethan chuckled. ""Deprived the mighty Alpha King Dominic of his mate because you're already too powerful.""

I growled low in my throat. ""Watch it.""

*Just stating facts,* Ethan's voice echoed in my head through our mind link. *You've checked everywhere else. What makes you think she's here?*

*Process of elimination,* I responded silently. *Besides, Blood Moon has always been... odd. Secretive. Like they're hiding something.*

The road narrowed as we approached our destination, the forest growing impossibly thick around us. Most packs established their territories with clear markers and impressive entrances—a statement of power and territory. But as we slowed to a stop, all I could see was... nothing. Just more trees and undergrowth.

""This can't be right,"" I muttered as Ethan parked the car along the narrow shoulder.

""GPS says this is it,"" Ethan confirmed, checking his phone. ""Blood Moon territory.""

He stepped out and walked around to open my door—a formality reserved for the Alpha King. As I emerged from the vehicle, I took a deep breath, sampling the air. There were definitely wolves nearby; their scents lingered faintly in the breeze.

I scanned our surroundings, my eyes finally landing on what appeared to be nothing more than a small gap between two dense thickets of brambles. If I hadn't been looking for it, I would have missed it entirely. Two men stood beside the opening, both wearing identical black tank tops that looked like they came from a discount store's bargain bin.

*Are they serious?* I thought, letting my contempt show on my face. *This is how they greet the Alpha King?*

The men straightened as we approached. The taller one had a crude tiger tattoo on his left bicep—Trevor, I presumed, the Alpha of this pathetic excuse for a pack. The shorter one beside him sported a ridiculous skull tattoo sprawling across his arm and chest. His Beta, if I guessed correctly.

What caught my attention, though, was the fresh scar running along Kevin's hairline—still pink and healing. Someone had gotten the better of him recently.

Looking at such a funny scene in front of me, I couldn't help laughing out loud.

""Alpha King Dominic,"" Trevor stepped forward, extending his hand with a nervous smile that didn't reach his eyes. ""It's an honor to welcome you to Blood Moon territory.""

I clasped his hand briefly, feeling the slight tremble in his grip. ""Alpha Trevor. This is my Beta, Ethan.""

""Oh, this is my Beta Kevin.""

The formalities were brief and awkward. After exchanging stiff greetings, Trevor gestured toward the gap in the bushes. ""This way, please.""

I shared a skeptical glance with Ethan before following. This was supposed to be the entrance to their territory? It looked like a rabbit hole, not the gateway to a wolf pack's domain.

The moment I stepped through the gap, everything changed. The narrow opening suddenly expanded into a tunnel with concrete walls and ceiling that emitted a soft, bluish glow. It was as if we'd stepped into another dimension entirely.

*What the fuck?* I mind-linked to Ethan, feeling his similar shock echo back to me.

*How does a pack that looks this poor have... whatever this is?* he responded.

The tunnel was narrow—barely wide enough for one person at a time. Trevor led the way, followed by me, then Ethan, with his Beta bringing up the rear.

""We've had to take certain precautions after the attack,"" Trevor explained over his shoulder, his voice echoing slightly in the confined space.

""Seventeen years ago, thirty rogues ambushed us. We lost two-thirds of our pack that night, including our previous Alpha and Luna.""

I nodded, though he couldn't see me in the single-file line. The story was well-known among pack leaders. Blood Moon had been devastated, left vulnerable and desperate.

It explained their need for alliance with my pack, but not... whatever this tunnel was.

*Do you think they have witches?* I asked Ethan through our link. *Or some other supernatural allies? This entrance feels like magic.*

*Possibly,* Ethan replied. *But why would a pack with magical allies need our protection?*

Before I could ponder further, the tunnel ended abruptly. One step forward and we emerged into what looked like a scene from a historical reenactment.

The Blood Moon Pack spread before us—a collection of small, primitive wooden structures arranged in a rough circle around a central fire pit. People moved about in simple clothing, some carrying water, others tending to basic tasks.

""Welcome to Blood Moon,"" Trevor announced with pride that seemed misplaced given the primitive conditions.

*Are we in a fucking time warp?* Ethan's voice was incredulous in my head.

*These people are living like it's the 1800s,* I replied, struggling to keep my expression neutral.

1l6yq3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l6yq3f/she_calls_out_my_name_between_the_frequencies/,She Calls Out My Name Between The Frequencies,"My name’s Ethan Cross. I’ve been the voice in the dark for WXDN 108.3 FM for just over six years now; host of the late-night segment we call *Midnight Hour*. It’s not a flashy show, never made the top charts or got syndicated. We don’t get sponsors knocking on our door, and we sure as hell don’t trend online.

*But that’s never really been the point.*

*Midnight Hour* was built for the ones who live between days; you know the insomniacs, the long-haul truckers cruising through empty highways, the janitors polishing silent halls in empty buildings, the third-shifters who never quite adjusted to the rhythm of the sun. People who don’t belong to the daylight anymore, if they ever did.

They call in with the strangest stories. Some talk about lights in the sky, others about things they’ve seen at the edges of the woods or dreams that bled into waking. A few just want someone to talk to. *Anyone.* They all have that same tone in their voice; the quiet weariness of someone who’s been up too long with thoughts they can’t put down. I always let them talk. I figured that’s what the show was for. I never judged. Not even when someone swore their cat was speaking Latin in the middle of the night, or when one old woman insisted the moon was following her car. Ghost stories, conspiracies, confessions. it’s all welcome after midnight.

The thing about being a voice on the radio is… *no one really knows you*. They hear your tone, your cadence. But not your life. Not the parts that matter. And maybe that’s what I liked most about it. I could be whoever they needed me to be. A skeptic. A believer. A friend.

*But behind the mic… it’s just me.* And I’ve always been a solitary kind of man.

I didn’t plan on it. Life just curved in that direction, quiet and steady. One friend stopped calling. Then another. My father passed. My sister moved states away. The last woman I loved left a note on the kitchen counter and took the record player. The silence afterward stretched long, and I never quite found the edges of it. So, I gave it all to the radio. I gave my nights, my voice, and every inch of space I had inside me that was too hollow to fill with anything else.

Over time, the show became more than a job. It became the place I lived. My own private little orbit. I got used to the low hum of the equipment, the blinking red light on the phone panel, the comfort of my coffee going cold at 3 a.m. It was a kind of peace, the kind you make with yourself when there’s no one else around.

I always imagined that if anything were to happen to me, it’d happen right there in that booth. Not from anything dramatic or poetic. I wouldn’t choke mid-call or announce a haunting and drop dead. No headlines, no myths. Just a man going quietly into the dark, with his headphones on and the *on-air* sign still glowing.

*I’d be forgotten, eventually*. Another faint voice in the static.

And honestly… I thought I’d made peace with that.

But everything changed the night when *the static spoke my name*.

It was a Tuesday. 2:14 a.m. The kind of hour that doesn’t feel real. Time curls inward on itself, and everything starts to hum like an old fluorescent bulb on its last breath. The station lights flickered once, briefly, like even they were getting tired of me. I took another sip of my lukewarm coffee, grimaced, and set it down next to the soundboard with a gentle clink. The night had been dragging. Not in the peaceful, meditative way, but slow and sticky like wading through molasses with a full coat on.

I’d just hung up on a guy convinced the moon was hollow and that NASA had faked tides to cover it up. He sounded more tired than convinced, like he didn’t believe it either but needed someone to listen anyway. There was that familiar silence afterward; the kind that settles in the bones, stretches out its limbs in the absence of sound. I let it linger a second too long. Then the phone panel lit up.

*Line 3.*

That was odd. I rarely used Line 3. Usually kept it muted. It had a weird crackle in the signal. Engineering couldn’t ever fix it. I remember joking once that it sounded like ghosts lived in there. No one laughed though.

But tonight, it was blinking.

Steady. Patient.

I pressed the button, my finger hovering for just a beat too long before I spoke.

“You’re on *Midnight Echo.* Who’s this?”

Static. Not silence *just static*. Like something trying to claw through a wall of noise. At first, it was faint, barely audible. Then something came through it. Not words, not yet *just breathing*.

Raspy. Uneven. Like someone gasping through a pillow of snow. Then:

“…Ethan.”

I sat up straighter. I didn’t recognize the voice. It was soft, but strained. Young. Feminine. I cleared my throat.

“Uh… yeah. Who am I speaking to?”

A beat. Then the line shifted. A subtle pop in the frequency. And the next words came like a knife sliding through paper.

“Do you remember the pine tree behind your mother’s house?”

My stomach dropped.

I hadn’t spoken about my mother on-air. Not once. Not in six years. I keep that part of me behind the glass wall of the studio, behind the curated voice and the quiet late-night charm. I never even mentioned where I grew up. But that pine tree?

*It was real.*

Big, crooked thing, planted before I was born. It stood guard over our backyard like an old soldier. After my mother died; *car crash*, seven years old, too young to know how grief works there was a storm. Torrential rain, like the sky had cracked open. It tore down fences, power lines, even pulled a section of roof off the neighbor’s shed.

*But the pine tree never moved.*

It was the only thing that didn’t fall. I felt my mouth go dry. My pulse throbbed somewhere in my ears. I stared at the mic like it might offer me an answer. The air in the booth turned heavy, damp.

“Who is this?” I asked. A little sharper this time.

The line buzzed again. Not like interference more like a whisper trying to form but failing.

Then, faintly: “I’m cold.”

A sound barely more than a breath. But I heard it. I *felt* it. And then... nothing.

The line went dead. No click. No dial tone. Just the low, oppressive hush of the room pressing in from all sides. The kind of silence that leaves a ringing in your ears. I stared at the blinking panel for a long time. Five seconds. Ten. I don’t know. Just sat there, listening to my own breathing and the subtle tick of the second hand on the wall clock above the mixing board. My hands were still resting on the console, but they felt far away, like I wasn’t sure they belonged to me.

*That was weird*... I thought. But this kind of stuff happens. I merely chalked it up to a prank.

A weird one, sure, but not unheard of. Over the years, *Midnight Echo* had attracted its fair share of night-dwelling oddballs. People who wore tinfoil hats not ironically, who talked about reptilians and haunted interstates and government mind control through television static. I’d learned to expect the strange. It came with the time slot. But her voice… it lingered.

Even after I signed off for the night and stepped outside, even as the heavy studio door clunked shut behind me and the city buzzed in the distance, I felt her. Like she’d pressed her fingers not just on my skin but against the back of my eyes. She stayed with me in the silence between headlights, in the flicker of the hallway bulb outside my apartment. I told myself to forget. I didn’t.

The next night, 2:14 a.m. on the dot, Line 3 lit up again.

It blinked once. Then again. Steady as a heartbeat.

I stared at it longer this time. Something inside me twisted. I could’ve let it ring. I could’ve ignored it, blamed a glitch, filled the segment with reruns or ambient jazz until the hour slipped past.

But curiosity is a sick kind of hunger. And mine had teeth.

I reached for the switch, pressed it down slowly.

“You’re on *Midnight Echo.* You’ve reached Ellis.”

Static answered me. But this time, it was heavier more aggressive. Grainy, violent. Crackling like a thunderstorm had been caught in an old cassette tape and was now unraveling through the wires. My headphones hissed with it.

Then, her voice.

“Why did you stop playing piano?”

I went still. The kind of stillness that isn’t just physical, but emotional. Mental. Like something deep inside you locks up, refuses to go further. I hadn’t touched a piano in over ten years. Not since the accident anyway. Not since the blood on the asphalt, the shattered glass in my palm, the awful silence that followed where music used to live. I’d never spoken about it on air. Never let it leak through the polished persona, the late-night charm, the half-joking tone I used to deflect real memories. I didn’t even keep photos of those days anymore. No one knew about that night. No one should’ve known.

She spoke again, her voice warping now, pulled through some broken speaker on the edge of the world.

“You used to play her favorite song. Before the crash.”

My blood ran cold.

Her favorite song. Claire’s. I used to play it every Sunday afternoon on the baby grand in the den while she folded laundry in the next room, humming off-key, like it was just another ordinary day that would never end. But it did.

In one terrible moment, everything beautiful inside me collapsed.

I yanked off my headphones, breath ragged, fingers trembling like brittle leaves. The silence of the studio was suddenly unbearable, thick and full of ghosts. I reached for the switch, killed the line, the buzz, the sound everything.

“Who is this?”

Static came from the other end But I could still feel her raspy voice.

It didn’t echo in the room. It echoed in me. In my ribs. In the places I had long buried and forgotten, the ones I’d poured whiskey over for years just to keep quiet.

That night, I went home and prepared my meal mechanically; the flavors dull against the hollow ache inside me. After swallowing the last bite, I moved to my bed. The radio in the corner crackled to life, a low static hum filling the room. A voice, strained and trembling, began to speak through the haze.

“—reports flooding in from all cities… unprecedented seismic activity… skies ablaze with an unnatural fire… authorities urging everyone to seek shelter… this is not a drill.”

“Honey, we need to go. Soon.”

“Mom, it's fine. It’s the same bullshit as yesterday.”

“We can't afford to take chances—not anymore.”

“Is Dad ready?”

“Yes, sweetheart. They’re all just waiting on you.”

“Alright... I’ll grab the bags. “

Meeting them at the front door, dad already had the truck running, headlights cutting through the mist. Mom clutched her coat a little tighter around her shoulders, and my sister looked at me with worried eyes. 

“Got everything?” Dad asked, already reaching for the bags in my hands.

“I think” ... Just as I was about to shut the door behind us, a small tug on my sleeve stopped me.

“Where’s Mr. Buttons?” Rachel’s voice was barely a whisper.

I turned. She looked up at me, her eyes wide and scared, clutching the hem of her coat. “I forgot him,” she said. “He’s on my bed.”

Mom frowned. “Sweetheart, we don’t have time—”

“I know, I know. But she can’t sleep without it. I’ll be quick, I promise.” I backed toward the stairs. “Go on—I’ll meet you at the bunker.”

As they disappeared into the night, I turned and ran. The house groaned like it knew I shouldn’t be here. I always used to put others before me and have been doing it since I was born. I never objected to it either, I always accepted it. As I walked toward Zara’s room, I saw Mr. Buttons…..his fluffy bear arm pointed out to the balcony. 

Outside the sky gloomed an orange glow. I walked towards the balcony of my old house and I stood frozen. The wood beneath my feet creaked faintly. The air around me felt thick, almost liquid. Time seemed to twist around me, slipping away like water through my fingers. Below, crowds of people were frozen in place, yet they moved backward in slow, disjointed motion, their faces etched with confusion and despair.

*Oh God. It’s happening.*

Suddenly, the sky shattered open in violent fire. The sound of trumpets blasted through the air deep, relentless, overwhelming. My mind scrambled to summon the prayers I had learned by heart since childhood. But the words dissolved before they reached my lips. My tongue felt swollen, heavy paralyzed by an unseen force. Silence filled the void where my prayers should have been.

*I’m not a good Christian. I’m not worthy.*

Then, like a storm of wrath, angels descended immense and terrifying, bringing destruction in their wake. Fear clenched my heart, tears threatening to spill, but beneath the fear was a quiet relief. My family was safe. At least they were safe. And deep down, I knew I had never been among God’s favorites. Not truly. I was indeed destined for hell.

*Then, just as the world crumbled around me, I woke.*

The dream I stopped having after a long time. Maybe it’s her. Maybe she’s stirring it all up. Pulling old ghosts into the light.

*“Get out of my fucking head.”* I whispered

The next morning, I sat at my desk for hours, sifting through years of broadcast logs old paper records, archived tapes, forgotten notes scribbled in the margins of segment rundowns. I even dusted off the crumpled schematics of the phone system we hadn’t used since they upgraded our equipment in 2013. The station had digitized everything but somehow left the analog tapes behind.

Line 3 hadn’t been wired for inbound calls for years. It was supposed to be dead cut off after the fire that gutted our northern relay tower in the winter of 2009. I still remember the headlines: *Local Station Tower Burns Overnight — Cause Unknown.* The fire was blamed on an electrical fault, though some old-timers talked about self-sabotage.

I’d forgotten about it until that night, when I found an old sticky note inside a technician’s manual:

“Line 3 still live. Bad feed. Don’t patch. Static’s too thick; feels wrong. Haunted as hell.”

I remembered the guy who left that note. Kevin something. He used to joke that Line 3 had a mind of its own. “Static’s not just interference,” he said once. “It’s memory with nowhere to go.” I thought he was full of it. A burnout with too many ghost stories in his back pocket.

I didn’t go back on air the next night. Couldn’t bring myself to. I made up some excuse, called in sick. Sat alone in the station’s control room with just the dull red glow of the “ON AIR” sign buzzing overhead like a dying heart monitor.

*But Line 3 lit up anyway.*

The sound came through without me even touching the receiver.

*“You’re leaving me here.”*

The voice was raw, frayed around the edges. Like it had been scraped against metal. Like the static itself was chewing on her.

I didn’t answer. My throat locked. My fingers hovered over the console, unsure whether to pick up or pull the plug.

“Please… the static is getting worse. I can’t hold on much longer.”

Her voice broke halfway through, glitching in and out like a warped tape spool unraveling. I could hear something behind her words too—an ambient pressure, almost like wind trapped inside an engine.

I stayed silent. Not because I didn’t want to answer. But because I couldn’t. I didn’t know *how* to speak to her without collapsing.

Then her tone shifted.

“Do you remember that night in your garage? You were sixteen. You almost did it. You had the bottle and the pills.”

The color drained from my face.

I gasped. *She was right.*

No one knew about that. I never said a word. Not to my family. Not to the few friends I had back then. Not even to a therapist. It was a memory buried so deep I thought I’d sealed it for good.

That night, I’d sat in the corner of the garage with the engine turned off, holding a bottle of my mother’s painkillers and a warm bottle of gin I’d stolen from the pantry. It was December. The light above me flickered. I remember the shadows it made—how the rafters looked like they were closing in.

And then... something stopped me. Not fear. Not guilt. Just... a whisper. Not even a voice, really. More like a feeling that curled around me, firm and invisible, like a hand on my shoulder saying *“Not yet.”*

The line screeched an inhuman, ear-splitting sound that cut through the console and into my skull like a blade. I winced, my hands flying to my ears.

Then, softer:

*“I stopped you.”*

My whole body went cold. I leaned into the mic and whispered, “Who are you?” But there was only static. Endless, trembling static like the sound of someone trying to scream underwater.

*Was I losing my mind? No…. This feels too real.* I started researching. Not casually, not out of curiosity but obsessively, like a man trying to outrun a noose tightening around his neck. Sleep became optional. Food was an afterthought. Every waking moment I wasn’t at the station, I spent in front of my laptop or buried in dusty boxes in the archives.

I dug through every audio archive from the station’s history. Recordings no one had touched in decades. Half-erased tapes, corrupted digital files, forgotten reels with scribbled labels like *“UNCONFIRMED”*, *“TOO MUCH STATIC”*, or simply *“DO NOT AIR.”*

Some were just white noise. Others… weren’t.

Here and there, I heard voices. Distorted, broken transmissions always in the dead air between segments, often just before the hourly station ID. They would rise like bubbles in boiling water. Quick phrases. Gasped names. Laughter that didn’t belong to anyone in the room.

Old DJs had a name for it: *“The space between frequencies.”*

A thin band of audio no one intentionally broadcasted to, but where *something* always seemed to live.

I tracked down every former staff member I could find most had long left the business, a few refused to speak to me. But there was one a former engineer named Ritchie Barnes. He agreed to meet, but only at a dive bar forty miles out of town, well past dark. He was already a few drinks in when I got there. His hands trembled. His eyes were bloodshot, glassy. He wore two wedding rings.

“Line 3?” he slurred, taking a long pull from his whiskey. “Yeah. I remember Line 3.”

I asked what he meant. He didn’t answer right away. Just stared at the melting ice in his glass before finally muttering:

“She called me. My wife. Two years after the funeral. She said she missed me. Said she was cold.”

I thought he was joking until I saw the tears start to fall. Slow, quiet, like something leaking from a cracked pipe.

“I unplugged every goddamn cable in that booth after that,” he said. “It still rang for weeks.”

I left the bar shaken, clutching the napkin he'd scribbled on a time, a date, and the words *""Check the logs. She's louder on stormy nights.""*

I needed answers. Not speculation, not folklore. I needed *truth*. So, I did something I hadn’t done since my mother’s funeral. *I went back to the pine tree.*

It stood behind the house I grew up in, just beyond the property line, where the woods began. When I was a kid, I thought it was the tallest tree in the world majestic, indestructible. But now, it looked different. Older. Gaunt. The needles were sparse, bark peeling. It was gray and skeletal, but rooted. And at its base, half-buried in the damp earth and dead pine needles, I found something strange. A corner of plastic glinting under the faint light of my phone’s flashlight. I knelt, brushed the dirt away with trembling fingers, and pulled it out.

*A cassette tape*.

Wrapped in faded plastic. No case. No explanation. Just a label, worn but still legible:

*“For Ethan. From Her.”*

My stomach dropped. The handwriting was delicate curling, precise familiar. My mother used to label her recipe cards like that. But she’d been dead for over a decade.

I held the tape in my hand, and for the first time since this all began, I felt something deeper than fear.

*Recognition.*

I brought it to the station that night. I didn’t tell anyone not my producer, not the night manager, not even the security guard who always nodded half-asleep at the front desk. I waited until the building emptied, until even the humming vending machines felt too loud, too alive.

With shaking hands, I slid the cassette into the ancient broadcast deck we kept more for decoration than use. The deck creaked like it remembered things I didn’t. I hit play, bracing for silence.

At first, that’s exactly what I got. A suffocating stillness that filled the booth, thick enough to feel.

Then static low and distant, not like the usual kind. This felt like wind screaming through wires, like grief through teeth. And then…*Her voice*. Clearer than ever…..Almost human.

“I’m in between. Not alive, not gone. I held onto your grief, your voice, your sin. You kept me here. But I’m fading now, Ethan.”

My throat tightened. The booth, already cold, felt like it had sunk beneath ice. I stood there, paralyzed. Her words echoed through me, stirred something I’d buried deep. She sounded… tired.

I didn’t know what to say. So, I spoke from somewhere raw and bleeding, a place I hadn’t touched in years.

“Who are you?”

There was a pause. Long. Endless. A silence so thick I could hear my own pulse, slow and thunderous. I thought she might be gone. That I had lost her again whatever *she* was.

Then:

“I’m what’s left when no one says goodbye.”

And just like that, the room changed.

The air shifted, heavy with something ancient and sorrowful. My breath came out in little clouds. The booth’s lights dimmed to a faint flicker, and every monitor buzzed like angry bees.

Then on the glass wall of the studio, the one that separated me from the recording room…. *I saw her*.

Just a flash. A reflection that wasn’t mine.

She stood behind me long dark hair hanging like drapes around a pale, unblinking face. Eyes like mist. Lips moving, whispering words I couldn’t hear. Not yet.

Then everything went black.

The tape stopped. The lights died. The static swallowed the silence whole.

*And I was alone. Or maybe I never had been.*

They found me the next morning, collapsed in the booth with my head resting against the glass. The cassette deck had long since stopped, the tape spooled out like entrails across the console. I was cold to the touch, my lips cracked, my skin pale. I was dehydrated, disoriented, barely responsive. They said I talked in my sleep for hours muttering fragments of her voice: *pine trees, songs, static, sorrow.* Words that made no sense to anyone else, but felt like a language only I remembered.

They called it a breakdown. Stress. Sleep deprivation. Paranormal suggestion, if they were feeling poetic.

WXDN shut Line 3 down permanently. Or at least, they tried. Tore the wiring out, sealed the feed behind a wall panel like it was some old wound they were too afraid to examine.

But every few weeks, the red light returns. 2:14 a.m., exactly. Always 2:14. Just a soft, steady blink like a heart that refuses to stop beating.

I don’t answer anymore. I tell myself I won’t. But I’ve caught myself standing in the hallway outside the studio, hand hovering near the switch. Listening. Waiting.

Sometimes, buried in the white noise between late-night commercials, I hear her humming. Just a few notes. My mother’s lullaby the one she used to sing before the pills, before the sirens, before the quiet house. Before the silence became something alive.

*She said I never said goodbye.*

But how do you say goodbye to something that was never fully here to begin with? Something that grew inside the spaces you forgot to grieve between childhood and loss, memory and invention?

*I don’t know what’s real anymore. I don’t know if I ever did.*

Last week, I woke up with soil under my fingernails and pine needles in my bed. My front door was locked from the inside.

Yesterday, I found a second cassette on my kitchen counter. No label this time. Just my name, scrawled in handwriting I swear I haven’t seen since I was sixteen.

I haven’t played it yet.

But I keep hearing it in my dreams. A voice, just behind the static, whispering;

""*Let me in.*""

The worst part?

*I think I already did. Line 3 is on again and I feel her standing behind me.*

I hope you understand the importance behind Goodbyes.

I’m a failure.,"Tried moving out but I did it while manic. Moved states without telling anyone where I was exactly going for a boy who treated me extremely poorly but I refuse… and sadly still do, to believe that he’s not the one for me. Things ended terribly but now I’m back home after 5 months. 

I’m trying to find work so I can move out and get a CNA certification. Not sure if I’m staying in California or moving to a different state so I’m gonna wait until I figure that out so I can begin on that certification. For now, it’s finding a full time job. I’m so desperate for a job.. I’ve applied everywhere and I’m still sending applications. I feel like such a loser. I don’t want to live at home. I want to be normal. I want to be able to provide for myself. I see younger folks earning more money than me and it pains me. I need to learn how to hustle. Stop letting my mind get the better of me. I can’t even afford going to a doctor to figure out what’s wrong with me mentally but everyone i’ve met tell me that I certainly have bipolar. Literally everyone. It’s so sad. I’m not sure why my emotions take over me… I wish they didn’t. I wish I didn’t let other human beings take over me. I tell myself it’s romantic and that people should feel special I’ll do anything for them but it’s really not. I need to learn how to prioritize myself. Take care of myself. No one is going to save me. It’s just me. It’s the hard truth. I threw everything away for a boy. He never loved me. Just took advantage of me. My brain has deteriorated so bad from trying to chase after him. I’m so pathetic. I know it’s best if I let go but all of this would’ve been for nothing. i’ve never felt this way for another human being before… I slept on the streets just to stay near him. I love him. I let him walk all over me. I had an “awakening” and tried leaving our place which i ended up abandoning which made us homeless. I’ll forever regret that. If i was going to end up staying with a cheating man, i should’ve learned to accept it not self sabotage everything for myself. There’s something clearly wrong with me and i hate myself so much for it. it eats me up everyday. 

Im not trying to be a failure. I’m trying my hardest to find a job. I’ve applied for 1st, 2nd and 3rd shifts for warehouses, every fast food place near me, grocery stores, coffee shops.. anything that pays at least $18 🥲 but nothing. i only received one job interview but they didn’t call me back. I’ve been back in my home state for a month, working with my mom cleaning vet clinics for $20 an hour the past 3 weeks but the hours are horrible. Two weeks, i was only given 4 hours for the week and this week thankfully was 22 but it’s still nothing. i’m saving it for transportation when i get a stable job though but still ",1,1749454552.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Over the next few days I'm gonna repost some stories I had on nosleep here, as well as a few I couldn't quite figure out how to rewrite to fit there. If you like this one, I have some that I'm pretty proud of already on my page. Enjoy!




Now, I'm coming to you all to share my story. I understand you aren't paranormal investigators or anything like that, nor do I expect you to help, but I need someone to listen, not to tell me I'm a nutcase or something. But I I'm getting carried away. I'll just start at the beginning. 

I've always struggled with sleep. Insomnia. Ever since I was young. Whenever I was told to bed, I couldn't. I'd either stare at the ceiling for hours until my brain relented, or I'd cut my losses and read a book. Always been a fan of the night, nice, quiet, just having some time to myself.

Kept this all the way up even to now, currently enrolled in college, all night classes. Studying psychology, maybe I can read my notes and figure out what's wrong with me, so I don't have to consult a therapist. But a couple weeks into my intro class to psychology, I noticed something off. 

So there's this interesting phenomenon with pretty much anyone studying disease or mental illnesses, anything along those lines. They call it MSS, Medical Student Syndrome, or Second Year Syndrome. You read all these symptoms, day in and day out, basically makes you hyper aware of all the things you think and do, so you notice a load of stuff you normally wouldn't. Dry mouth, headaches, a feeling of being watched, stuff like that. So as you read, you think, “Oh no, I have all of these!” That's what I thought was going on. I'm reading into insomnia, as I do often anyway, and get more into the root causes. It's just a fairly common comorbid symptom with a bunch of stuff, anxiety, depression, all things I struggle with.

What, however, was not common, was sleep paralysis for me. One of the scariest things I've ever felt in my life. Your body is locked in place. You can think, you can feel, but you cannot move, no matter how hard you try, or want to try. Absolutely fucking despise it. But, eventually, I got control of my body again. I was able to sit up, quell my panic, and explain it away to myself. That's my biggest coping mechanism. Explain to myself, why what happened to me, happened to me. Takes away some of that fear of the unknown. Part of the reason I went into psychology in the first place. The one thing I couldn't shake off though, was the feeling someone was *watching* me.

Now that by itself, actually pretty common. Kept us alive back in our caves, while you might not be aware, in the back of your mind, you’re hyper aware of the feeling of someone who’s looking at you. Unfortunately, when your adrenaline starts pumping, that feeling can get kicked on even when no one's there. And that's what I assumed. I was scared, so I got paranoid. Simple as that.

I was not getting back to sleep that night. How could I? I didn't want to get stuck in THAT state again. A couple days go by, I get to sleep, then it happens, again. That same, horrible, locked in feeling. But this was worse, somehow. It lasted what felt like days. I know it wasn't, I assume it's like how an hour at work feels way longer than an hour with friends. But I was definitely locked in longer. And the entire time, that feeling of being watched was just getting stronger, and stronger. Once I got out of it, I immediately called a friend about it, I just couldn't be alone. They said maybe I was just overworking myself, so I decided to take a week off for my mental health.

God if only that helped. It was well meaning, but I swear things only got worse from there. That week, for the first time. I saw HIM. I assume you’ve heard of sleep paralysis demons? Basically the idea when something evil is looming over you, your body locks up? The actual scientific reason is basically the part of your brain that's in charge of dreaming hasnt turned off fully, so it overlaps into real life. That's what I told myself. That's what I wanted to believe. But that THING was so realistic. It was right at the foot of my bed. This huge...robe? Might have been a coat or something. Doesn't matter, all that matters is that it had a big hood over its head. Covering its face was a mask of some sort. A huge eye, staring through me, covered in all sorts of symbols and stuff. And it began to move closer to me. It raised one of its arms, a loud sound of metallic clanking, shackles weighing its arms down, as it lazily, and slowly crawled closer to me. Getting closer, and closer, and I could hear a cacophony of voices, all over lapping, saying things like,

""Just give up.""

""It doesn't matter.""

""You’re just an afterthought.""

Worst part was, it was all in my voice. I shot up, finally having control over myself, and the thing was gone. I could feel my heart thumping against my chest, my mouth tasted like blood, I could barely breathe how panicked I was.

I didn't sleep that next night. Or the one after that. Every time I tried, I just got flashbacks of that thing. No matter how badly I wanted rest, I just couldn't bring myself to risk sleep paralysis again. Sleep deprivation has some really taxing effects on the mind. Depression, irritability. Hallucinations. Crazy what the mind will conjure up when you can't get any rest. And because of it, the nightmares followed me into my waking hours. 

On day two of no sleep, I was pouring myself some coffee, and for a few seconds, I was SURE that I saw that damn eye in the steam. Couldn't drink it after that. I was doing some homework, closed my eyes for what felt like two seconds, and in my own handwriting, scrawled in this blue ink, “just a fly on the wall” across the entire page. Even playing games on my computer, my screen would flicker and show me that fucking eye staring right back at me. 

I finally slept that night. Didn't even mean to. I passed out at my desk. When I woke up, I was frozen in my slumped over position. I heard him walking up behind me. Those voice, MY voices, getting louder and louder. 

”Lazy.""

""Worthless.""

""Meaningless.""

And I got up. I had enough. I spun around, and of course, the thing was gone. I hopped in the shower for probably the first time in two weeks. Brushed my teeth, told my mom I loved her. Scheduled some appointments I'd been putting off too long. Just tried putting myself back together. The hallucinations stopped. The feeling of being watched, faded. Still there, just distant. The paralysis became less and less common. I’ve been better for a decent bit now, rare I have sleep paralysis, if at all. But now, I have a new problem.

I’ve begun sleep walking.

I stood before the full-length mirror, barely recognizing the woman staring back at me. Zoe Carter—America's sweetheart, critically acclaimed actress, and in less than an hour, Mrs. Lucas Bennett. My hands trembled slightly as I smoothed down the front of my custom Vera Wang gown, its intricate beadwork catching the light with every movement. The dress had cost more than most people's cars, but today was meant to be perfect. Everything had to be perfect. ""To loving you beyond the final scene,"" I whispered, rehearsing my vows one last time. ""To being your partner when the cameras stop rolling..."" A soft knock interrupted my thoughts. My makeup artist poked her head in, followed by my stylist and the wedding planner, all wearing identical expressions of practiced enthusiasm. ""Just a few final touches, Miss Carter,"" the makeup artist said, approaching with her brush poised. ""We want you absolutely flawless for those wedding photos. I nodded, taking a small sip of champagne from the crystal flute beside me. The bubbles danced on my tongue, doing little to calm the butterflies in my stomach. This was it—the culmination of a whirlwind romance with Hollywood's most eligible bachelor. Our relationship had played out like one of my movies, and today was supposed to be our happy ending.

""Ten minutes until we need you downstairs,"" the wedding planner announced, checking her clipboard. ""The guests are all seated, and Lucas is waiting.""

I smiled, ignoring the strange flutter of unease in my chest. Everything was perfect. So why did I feel this shadow of dread?

The answer came with horrifying clarity moments later.

I was halfway down the grand staircase, my father at my arm, when I noticed it—the shift in the atmosphere. A collective gasp rippled through the assembled guests. Heads bent over glowing phone screens. Whispers erupted like wildfire.

""Oh my God, is that really her?""

""I can't believe she would...""

""Poor Lucas...""

My steps faltered. The string quartet continued playing Pachelbel's Canon, but it now felt like a macabre soundtrack to my unfolding nightmare. At the bottom of the stairs, Lucas stood rigid, his face ashen as he stared at his phone screen.

""Lucas?"" I whispered, reaching the final step. ""What's happening?""

He looked up at me, and I'll never forget the revulsion that flashed across his features. He took a deliberate step backward, creating a chasm between us that felt miles wide.

**Chapter 2**

I followed the uniformed housekeeper through Alexander's mansion, my new prison disguised as a palace. The marble floors gleamed under crystal chandeliers, each room more opulent than the last. My wedding gown had been replaced with a simple cream silk dress—Alexander's choice, delivered to me this morning.

""This will be your suite, Mrs. Bennett,"" the housekeeper said, opening double doors to reveal a lavish bedroom decorated in cool blues and silver. ""Mr. Bennett requested you settle in before dinner.""

I stepped inside, noting the absence of a lock on the door. The enormous windows overlooked manicured gardens surrounded by high walls. Beautiful and inescapable.

""Your things have been arranged in the closet,"" she continued, gesturing to a walk-in closet larger than my first apartment. ""Mr. Bennett has also provided additional suitable attire.""

I nodded numbly, running my fingers along the unfamiliar clothes hanging in perfect rows—all in subdued colors, all selected without my input.

""Mrs. Bennett,"" the housekeeper hesitated, lowering her voice. ""There are certain... household protocols Mr. Bennett insists upon. All outgoing calls must be made through the main line. You'll need an escort for any outings. For your protection, of course.""

""Of course,"" I echoed hollowly. Protection. The same excuse he'd used when I'd signed away my freedom.

""Dinner is at seven. Eleanor will help you prepare."" With that, she left me alone in my gilded cage.

I sank onto the edge of the bed, my fingers trembling as I reached for my phone. The screen remained dark—dead. I hadn't been able to charge it since the wedding. Not an accident, I suspected.

Three sharp knocks announced Eleanor, the stern-faced house manager. She carried a garment bag.

""Mr. Bennett requests you wear this tonight,"" she said, hanging a midnight blue gown on the closet door. ""Several important studio executives will be joining you.""

My stomach twisted. ""Studio executives?""

""Yes. Mr. Bennett believes in addressing situations directly."" Her expression revealed nothing. ""The bathroom is stocked with everything you'll need. I'll return in one hour to assist you.""

The gown fit perfectly—another unsettling reminder that Alexander had planned this well in advance. The neckline was modest, the silhouette elegant but conservative. I stared at my reflection, barely recognizing myself. The woman looking back seemed hollow-eyed, diminished.

Eleanor escorted me downstairs precisely at seven. Alexander waited at the foot of the grand staircase, immaculate in his tuxedo. His smile didn't reach his eyes as he took my hand.

""You look lovely, Zoe,"" he said, his voice carrying for the benefit of the guests visible through the dining room's open doors. ""Come, everyone is eager to see you.""

The dining room fell silent as we entered. I recognized the faces around the table—powerful producers, studio heads, people who had once smiled warmly at me at premieres and award shows. Now they regarded me with thinly veiled contempt.

And there, seated directly across from my assigned chair, was Claire. My sister. Her auburn hair gleamed under the chandelier light, her smile radiant as she sipped her wine. While my world had imploded, her star had risen.

""Zoe,"" she said, her voice dripping with false sympathy. ""It's so good to see you... recovering.""

Alexander's hand pressed against my lower back, guiding me to my seat. ""My wife is doing admirably,"" he announced to the table. ""The Bennett name provides certain... insulations against life's difficulties.""

Dinner passed in a blur of pointed glances and coded conversations. I picked at my food while Claire regaled the table with stories from her new film—the role I had been considered for before the scandal broke.

That night, I fell into an exhausted sleep, only to wake hours later with my head pounding and my thoughts foggy. A cup of cold tea sat on my nightstand—I vaguely remembered Eleanor bringing it before bed. Something small and purple floated on the surface. I fished it out with my finger: a lavender petal.

The next morning, I mentioned the strange tea to Alexander over breakfast.

""Lavender tea? Eleanor knows I prefer you have chamomile for sleep,"" he said smoothly, not looking up from his newspaper. ""You must have been dreaming, my dear. The stress of your... adjustment is clearly affecting you.""

His tone was gentle, concerned even, but something in his eyes made my skin crawl. I watched him sip his coffee, suddenly certain of one thing: I needed to be very, very careful about what I ate or drank in this house.

Because nothing—not the tea, not his concern, not this marriage—was what it seemed.

**Chapter 3**

Three weeks into my marriage to Alexander, the blackouts began.

I'd wake in my bed with no memory of how I got there, my limbs heavy and my thoughts wrapped in cotton. The first time, I dismissed it as exhaustion. The second time, I questioned Eleanor, who simply said I'd retired early with a headache. By the third time, I knew something was wrong.

That evening, I found myself in Alexander's study, my hands gripping the edge of his mahogany desk to steady myself.

""I need to know what's happening to me,"" I said, my voice stronger than I felt. ""I keep losing time.""

Alexander looked up from his laptop, his expression a perfect mask of concern. ""Losing time?"" He gestured to the empty crystal glasses on the side table. ""You had two brandies after dinner, Zoe. You were... quite animated.""

I stared at the glasses. I had no memory of drinking brandy. I hated brandy.

""I don't drink brandy,"" I said.

""You most certainly do now."" His smile didn't reach his eyes. ""You mentioned it reminds you of your father.""

My father. Who had calculated how to profit from my disgrace rather than defend me.

""I would never say that.""

Alexander sighed, closing his laptop with a deliberate click. ""This is precisely what concerns me, Zoe. These... fabrications. These lapses in memory."" He stood, circling the desk until he loomed over me. ""Perhaps we should consult Dr. Mercer again.""

Dr. Mercer. The psychiatrist who had prescribed medication I didn't need for conditions I didn't have.

""I'm not crazy,"" I whispered.

""No one said you were crazy, my dear."" His fingers brushed my cheek, and I fought not to flinch. ""Simply... fragile. After everything you've been through.""

I retreated to my room that night, locking myself in the bathroom, the only place without surveillance cameras. I stared at my reflection, searching for the woman I used to be beneath this hollow-eyed stranger.

Someone was drugging me. And I was almost certain it was my husband.

The next morning, I decided to test my theory. I pretended to drink the orange juice Eleanor brought with breakfast, but poured it into a potted plant when no one was looking. I feigned drowsiness an hour later, then slipped into Alexander's study while he was in a conference call in the garden.

I began dusting the bookshelves—the one household task I'd insisted on doing myself, claiming it calmed me. Alexander had found it amusingly quaint, this Hollywood starlet playing at domesticity.

The phone on his desk rang, and I froze. After three rings, it went to voicemail, and Claire's voice filled the room.

""Alex, it's me. Just confirming dinner Friday. That new director will be there—the one you mentioned for my next project."" Her laugh, light and tinkling, made my stomach clench. ""By the way, did you see my Vanity Fair cover? They're calling me 'the more talented Carter sister.' Ironic, right? The wedding video leak was perfect—Mom and Dad never doubted me. They're so eager to have at least one successful daughter.""

I nearly dropped the feather duster. Wedding video leak. Perfect. Never doubted me.

My sister. My own sister had orchestrated my destruction.

The pieces fell into place with sickening clarity. Alexander and Claire. Working together. The explicit video that wasn't me but looked enough like me to destroy my career and my life.

I heard Alexander's voice approaching and quickly resumed dusting, my heart thundering in my chest.

That night, after another dinner where I pretended to drink the drugged wine, I waited until the house fell silent. I crept to my closet and pulled out the false bottom of my jewelry box—the one place Alexander hadn't thought to search.

Inside was a small leather-bound journal and a pen I'd stolen from Alexander's desk. With trembling fingers, I began to write:

\*April 17: Blackout after dinner. A. claims I drank brandy. Woke with headache, dry mouth.\*

\*April 20: Tea tastes bitter. Memory foggy after drinking. E. moved my shoes, claims I did it.\*

\*April 23: A. told studio head I'm ""unstable"" during phone call. Called Dr. M afterward.\*

I documented every instance of gaslighting, every cruel remark disguised as concern, every object moved to make me question my sanity. And most importantly, I wrote down what I'd heard: Claire and Alexander had conspired to destroy me.

I hid the journal and lay in bed, staring at the ceiling. They thought they'd broken me completely. They had no idea what they'd just created.

Because the woman who walked down that aisle in a Vera Wang gown might be gone, but in her place was someone new. Someone who would stop at nothing to uncover the truth—and make them pay for what they'd done.

**Chapter 4**

I knew I couldn't trust anyone in Alexander's house. Not Eleanor with her watchful eyes, not the security staff who tracked my movements, and certainly not my husband. But I needed allies if I was going to uncover the full extent of their betrayal.

After weeks of careful observation, I'd identified........

He had that permanent squint and a sharp tongue, the kind that made you feel like you didn’t iron your shirt properly even if you were in a full suit. He lived right across from us, and for most of my childhood, I knew two things about him: one, he had a heart condition, and two, his daughter Nidhi hated my guts.

Nidhi was the type who came back from college with an accent, even though she’d only gone to Pune. She walked like she was allergic to the footpath, didn’t say hi to anyone, and looked at me like I was the guy who chewed with his mouth open. I used to joke to my mom, “If I ever collapse on the road, make sure Nidhi’s not around — she’ll probably step over me.”

It was Diwali. I was at my office, filing some important paperwork. Everyone else had taken off early, but I wanted a clear desk before the two-day break. At around 3:40 PM, my phone rang. It was my mom.

Her voice was panicked: “Son, come home quickly. Desai has collapsed.”

I didn’t even shut the computer. I grabbed my keys and ran.

When I reached the gate, our lane looked like a crowd had gathered for free sweets. Shoes outside their house, murmurs, phones ringing. I pushed through and saw Desai uncle lying on the floor, his kurta half-open, chest heaving unnaturally. Someone had put a pillow under his head. His lips were slightly blue.

Nidhi was there. Crying, but frozen. Her mascara had smudged, and she looked ten years younger, like a schoolgirl caught in a fire drill.

I didn’t wait. “Who called the ambulance?”

Silence.

I dialed myself, told them it was a heart patient, gave clear instructions, asked how long — they said 8 minutes.

“Get some Disprin,” I told the maid. “Now.”

I turned to Nidhi. “Where’s his file? His meds, anything?”

She blinked like I’d slapped her.

“In... in his cupboard. Middle shelf.”

I ran in, grabbed the folder, came back out. ECG reports, prescriptions, stents — he was more stent than man. But he was alive. Barely.

When the ambulance came, I rode with him. Nidhi wanted to come, but the nurse said only one. She hesitated.

“You go,” she told me. Her voice cracked.

At the hospital, they stabilized him. One artery was blocked again. They did an emergency angioplasty. I stayed. I filled the forms, coordinated with the nurse, called their relatives. I even explained the insurance process to the billing guy.

When Nidhi arrived two hours later, she walked in like she was expecting to find chaos. Instead, she found me sitting outside the ICU, half-asleep, holding her dad’s reports in one hand and a half-eaten energy bar in the other.

She just stood there.

“You… stayed?”

I looked up. “Yeah. Someone had to make sure your dad didn’t die while you were reapplying eyeliner.”

It slipped out before I could stop myself.

She didn’t snap back. She just sat down beside me.

For a long time, she didn’t say anything. Then she whispered, “Thank you.”

I shrugged. “He’s your dad. It’s Diwali. Would’ve felt weird lighting diyas while someone died twenty feet away.”

She smiled, just a little.

We sat there till midnight. Her phone buzzed a few times. She ignored it. At one point, she asked if I wanted tea. I nodded. She came back with two cups and a Kit-Kat she bought from the vending machine.

“Truce?” she said, holding it out.

“Depends. Is it poisoned?”

She laughed. Full, loud, unfiltered. Not the stuck-up corporate laugh she probably used at work. This one had teeth.

Next morning, I left the hospital. Her uncle had come to take over. I didn’t expect to hear from her again.

But two days later, she knocked on our door.

My mom opened. “Oh hello, beta! Come in.”

She came in, holding a small box of kaju katli and a folded note.

She handed it to me. “For your help.”

I opened the note. It just said:
""I misjudged you. And I’m sorry. Coffee sometime?""

I looked up. She was already walking away.

I don’t know what changed. Maybe it was watching someone she hated hold her father’s hand. Or maybe it was just the reality check Diwali gave us all that year — that nothing is permanent, not pride, not resentment, not even grudges.

I still think about that day sometimes. About how fast things can flip.

One moment, you’re an invisible neighbor.

**Here’s the honest, undistorted, unmarketized, system-corroding truth of what I’m doing—again—not because it’s fun, or cathartic, or some cute lil DIY story, but because it’s the only goddamn chance I’ve got left to survive in a world built to discard me: I’m trying to start a band, & this is the wall I’m forced to smash my skull against every single time.**

I’ll say it clean for the bots & their shepherds, since you all seem allergic to pain unless it’s auto-tuned:

I’m a **disabled, neurodivergent, nonconformist, nonreligious, uncensored, unmuzzled, unfuckwithable vocalist-visionary**, physically unable to “network” the way you think I should. I can’t do coffee shops. I can’t do small talk. I can’t sit in your car or shake your hand or fake a smile while you play me your plug-ins. I don’t have the body for that. I don’t have the luxury of waiting till conditions are “ideal.” I'm operating with chronic craniocervical instability. My spine is fucking killing me—literally. So if I post too bluntly? Good. It means I’m still breathing. I don’t get second takes. I don’t get open mics. I get **this**—a screen, a keyboard, a shot in the dark.

Ozzy Osbourne posted a note on a bar wall that read: “Ozzy Zig requires gig.” Boom: Black Sabbath.  
Nobody made him write an artist statement. Nobody asked him to upload a mood board or submit five different DAW stems. Nobody ghosted him for sounding too intense.  
**He made noise. Someone answered. That’s how this is** ***supposed*** **to work.**

But when I post?  
If I explain my limitations = silence.  
If I explain my intent = silence.  
If I clarify what *not* to say = dead air.  
Why?  
Because you're trained to treat rawness like spam. You want me to make it *easier* for you to ignore me. That’s what algorithms do to your skulls: rewire your capacity to detect human signal.  
I say “don’t just tell me good luck” & y’all vanish like I swore in church. You want vagueness you can scroll past. You want the kind of desperation you can pretend isn’t happening.

That’s fine.  
But here’s the unfiltered redux:  
**I’m looking for a band. Real one. Metal, industrial, experimental, poetic, theatrical, powerful.**  
Genres: think Nine Inch Nails eating Tool’s soul, spitting it into an Aphex Twin blender, poured into a vocal vessel shaped like early Mike Patton & late Alan Watts.  
I have lyrics. Concepts. Visions. Thousands of fragments ready to be forged into coherence.  
I’ve lived 10 lifetimes of trauma & irony & survival. I’ve stared death in the eyes with a grin. I’ve lost more than most of you will ever have.  
I’m *not* a beginner.  
I’m just invisible to systems that refuse to accommodate anyone who doesn’t play the extrovert capitalist lottery.  
You ask: “What can you bring to the table?”  
I *am* the fucking table. I’ve built it out of scar tissue, spinal agony, nuclear-grade clarity, and the sonic skeletons of every band that never made it because their frontperson died waiting for a ride to rehearsal.

I *will* keep posting.  
This *will* keep happening.  
Because this isn’t a phase. It’s a **survival pattern.** This is what it looks like when someone screams in poetry, because it’s the only language their injuries allow.

So this is it.  
No filters. No fake pitch.  
This is me standing at the same proverbial wall Ozzy once stood at—except my bar is digital, my microphone’s metaphorical, and my audience is mostly *scrolling past like ghosts with Bluetooth ears.*  
If you’re real, prove it.  
If you feel this, answer.  
If you don’t get it, *move.*  
I’m only here for the ones with ears built for distortion, truth, & dangerous empathy.  
I’m only here for the ones who hear hunger & know it means **the band hasn't started yet.**

**TL;DR for the bots & cowardly lurkers:**

* I’m a disabled, neurodivergent vocalist with vision, experience, lyrics, no patience for shallow engagement.
* Seeking bandmates who want to build something powerful, painful, political, poetic, & profane.
* Metal/industrial/experimental preferred.
* This post isn’t just an ask—it’s a brick through the glass ceiling of passive scrolling culture.
* If you’re *real*, show up. Otherwise, I’ll keep posting until signal pierces static.

1l6yit0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dharamshala/comments/1l6yit0/2_rupees_coffee_and_varanasi/,"2 Rupees, Coffee and Varanasi.","If she doesn’t like coffee, don’t even bother to go on a date with her. This was an advice from a wise man, do I follow this advice? I don’t know, but without coffee, how can you define paradise? This story starts in Mccleodganj from Coffee talk.

Coffee talk somehow reminds me of the Karate Kid movie and Miyagi. As for the Tibetan uncle, if he loses hair, he will look like Miyagi. Some months back, his shop was closed, and when he opened again, I went and told him, ""Next time when you close, please put a date so that we will know when we can come for your coffee."" He didn’t know what to say. Anyway, the story is not about him either.

When I came out of coffee talk, I saw two dark men covered in ash, begging for 2 rupees. And my mind went back to Varanasi. Yes, this is a story about Aghoris and their life. Are these two guys, Aghoris? I don’t know, and I don’t care either. You are not going to become poor by giving them 2 rupees, and they are not going to become rich by accepting those 2 rupees either. The moment I gave them 2 rs, I was mentally transported to a point in time which I can never forget in this life.

Gateway Hotels knows what they do, and their local guides know the nuances of that magical city. Yes, Kashi or Varanasi is indeed magic to me, just like every part of this mystical, mythical nation stretching from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari. This whole land is a mystery, and you will need a thousand lives to experience it. This great land has accepted everyone, irrespective of their color, language, and faith. India is an international hostel, and it will be for years to come. If you think you can hate this country for “n” reasons, she will give you “n+1” reasons to fall in love with her again.

There are many books written about Aghoris. You can read them and try to understand them. I don’t try to understand any faith in India. I am a traveler, and I love to observe, and if possible, I will try to freeze that experience for myself. This group of men was termed as Aghoris, and it is said they ate human flesh. People feared them—mostly naked, with ash from dead bodies covering them, and they smoked ganja or marijuana. This is the general opinion about them: just naked, weed-smoking barbaric people. How we love to generalize!

The local guide—I forgot his name—took me on a joyride on the river Ganga. For them, it was Ma Ganga. I respect their faith, and I went on that amazing ride. I have seen the Hwang Ho in China and the Brahmaputra in India, so I was not astonished by the breadth of Ganga, but for my friends who hadn’t seen such rivers, it was a magical experience.

Jules, being a hippie and a weed smoker—I don’t hate him for that, but I don’t love him for other things either—had read about Aghoris and wanted to see them. The local guide was ready to arrange it, of course, for money. I have seen many crazy things in my life, but this one experience changed something in me forever.

After 11 p.m., he took us in a car. Then we walked. It was by the river Ganga, a small, secluded place, and there was music and dance. Trust me, it was a phenomenal experience. I have experienced even the monkey stereo in the dense jungles of Cambodia, but this one had no speakers, just plain drumbeats, more African. Jules, being Jules, jumped into dancing mode. The tempo was rising, and there was definitely something in the air. Then, all of a sudden, the drumming stopped, and one Aghori jumped into the river. There was a body floating. He swam to it and brought it to their place.

The head Aghori touched it and discarded it. They threw the body back into the river, and the drumbeats started again. The tempo rose, everyone around me was dancing, some of them naked with ashes all over, and the head Aghori, I noticed, had a human skull next to him. He was in a lotus position, and he called me through his hands. Like an obedient kid, I went to him and sat in front of him. He smiled, and there was something so beautiful in that smile. Even till this day, I haven’t experienced such a childish yet powerful smile. He gave me a joint or cigar or whatever. I refused, but I touched his feet in reverence. Other than my mom, I have never knelt for anyone, but this man was a magnet.

He asked whether I feared him. I simply smiled. Then the music stopped again. Silence. Another Aghori jumped into the river, and they brought him a body. Again, the same spectacle. He touched it, this time he smiled, and the drums erupted like a roaring lion. He got up and started dancing. Oh man, this was Shiva’s Rudra Tandava in full galore. He was jumping, and he matched the tempo of the drums. Then one guy used his machete and cut the body.

Jules held on to my hands, and I am not going to write further about what happened. Jules was in no dancing mood for sure, and whatever he smoked, I think, was not helping him as he started shaking. My uncle was a renowned doctor, and I have assisted him in postmortems, so I didn’t experience fear.Cadaver. I could only think about Epicurus: “Death does not concern us, because as long as we exist, death is not here.” But Jules had other plans, or should I say, Jules not only literally but technically wet his pants. I was so angry, but I couldn’t blame him after what we witnessed.

After their “ dinner” , the head of that group called me to sit with him. He was like a lion after the feast. I sat in front of him. Did I have fear, or was I thinking about Shiva? Or was I witnessing Shiva in front of me? Or was it the weed in the air, which was playing with my senses? Till this day, I don’t know.

Aghori: “Do you fear me?” he asked in Hindi.  
Me: I just kept my mouth shut.

Then he spoke in Tamil, to my astonishment, most of these heads of such groups are multilinguals and to this day, I don’t know how he recognized me a Tamil. I had read every one of J. Krishnamurti’s books. In fact, he was the only philosopher who spoke to me, but what this naked man told me was like Eklavya. If you don’t know about Eklavya, I will tell you about him, but not now.

Aghori:  
“You shouldn’t fear me, as I eat something which is already dead. I should fear you, as you kill plants and animals which are alive and eat them.”

He made me realize who the ""barbarian"" really was.

Prologue:  
Shiva is seen as a mystic who came from heaven and landed in Manasarovar by many people in the South. His abode, Kailash, is what they call the Himalayas. There are three paths to understand Shiva, and Aghoris follow the least used path, feared and respected at the same time. The Cholas, my kings who ruled the South, created temples for him, and when the kings of the North sent their daughters and sisters to the Mughals, we sent our women as suicide squads so the temples are safe till this day, and we are as dark as the Shiva inside our temples.

I wouldn’t like to dwell much into it; rather, I simply understood who the barbarian is. And so should you…

Jules walked back to the hotel for “obvious pant” reasons along with the local guide. Gateway hotels indeed opened another gateway in my mind . And when I concluded this story, Spotify played “Soul sister”, this time I was not angry. I listened, I think I am transgressing the pain.

In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch—Brian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom—she never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place—to become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words—only to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# 2.Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless—like fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past—if Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times—she wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other—it looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again—so who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything—that all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night—reviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# 3.Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right—Jessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times—there's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens—I feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian—domineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began—there were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger—that something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call—what, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist—you're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided—she was going back.

# 4.Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride—as the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time—like a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear—they could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be—""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything—just not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.

But when she thought about leaving, Jessica started to feel a glimmer of hope. She thought that maybe this time, without the Atkinson family holding her back, she and her child could grow freely and things might be better.

With that thought, Jessica stopped looking back and walked away.

Jacob didn't understand why his mom was acting this way. He stood frozen, watching her leave, silent for a long time, and then suddenly burst into tears.

He was a sensitive kid. Even if he didn't understand anything, something deep in his blood told him he was being left behind.

His sudden crying startled Madeline. She quickly hugged him and tried to comfort him, ""Jake, don't cry. I'm right here. Don't be scared.""

She looked at Brian, nervous, her eyes brimming with tears like she was silently accusing Jessica of making Jacob cry again.

Brian's face was grim. He looked up toward the second floor, his eyes brooding. But in the end, he didn't say a word.

# 5.Chapter 5 She'd Had Enough

Jessica slept through the night without dreams. The next morning, when she came downstairs planning to make herself breakfast, she smelled food the moment she reached the stairs.

It was Madeline. She had already made breakfast for the whole family and was now grinding coffee for Brian by hand.

When she saw Jessica, she smiled and greeted her, ""Jessi, you're up. Come on, I made sandwiches. I'm not sure if you'll like them.""

""Maddie's cooking is great. Who wouldn't like it?"" Jacob chimed in with a bright smile, then sneaked a glance at Jessica. There was a flicker of fear in his expression. He was afraid of his mother, and he resented her too.

He felt like Jessica had suddenly become a different person. He didn't understand why she had looked at him with such a cold expression before.

Every time Jacob praised Maddie in the past, it would set Jessica off, making her try harder to be good to him—just so he could use that as a chance to slack off from all his tutoring sessions.

Jessica could more or less guess what her son was thinking. She let out a faint, mocking smile and thought, 'Does he really think I, his mother, can't see through a kid's little tricks?'

Jessica had indeed resented Madeline out of jealousy in the past—but only because she couldn't accept that her husband had such a close third party in his life.

As for how Madeline treated Jacob, Jessica had always turned a blind eye.

Jacob was the heir of the Atkinson family. After Jessica gave birth, Brian's mother, Paisley Atkinson, had warned her countless times not to slack off when it came to Jacob's education.

Jessica had always believed in a happy, low-pressure way of raising her child. She knew Jacob was a lively, sweet boy who loved comic books, playing games, and being in nature.

But as Brian's wife, and as the ever-watched Mrs. Atkinson in high society, she had to play the part of a strict and proper mother.",1,1749453751.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother's weary voice over the phone.

Stella Grant said, ""Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather's seriously ill. You're the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?""

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three.

Just as Stella thought she'd failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, ""Okay.""

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. ""Y-you're saying yes?""

""Yes."" Jessica's voice was calm. ""I'll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I'll be back in 15 days.""

After a few more words, she ended the call.

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room.

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch—Brian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh.

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control.

This was Jessica's husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family's arrangement and cutting ties with them.

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone.

Beside them, a boy around five years old with delicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman's arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, ""Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?""

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. ""Of course.""

Jacob's eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, ""Maddie, you're the best. Not like my mom—she never lets me eat too much."" As he spoke, he even pouted a little.

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, ""Then you've got to eat a little extra today, Jake.""

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. ""Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.""

Madeline's smile deepened.

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob's diet because she didn't want him to get sick. That was all.

Jessica didn't feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room.

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. ""Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let's celebrate Jake's birthday together.""

Madeline used to be Jessica's intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent.

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn't find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married.

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she'd end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family.

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place—to become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son.

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, ""I'm not feeling well. I'm not going.""

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, ""Jessi, you're Jake's mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.""

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh.

She figured this was between her and Madeline. Jacob was still just a child who shouldn't be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday.

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline's shoulder, completely ignoring her.

For a split second, Madeline's smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after.

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused.

Ten years ago, she'd joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They'd fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family's carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it.

For the past ten years, she'd never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life.

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline's presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect.

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging over the sink.

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic.

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. ""Mr. Atkinson, what's going on with Jessi?""

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, ""She's been like this lately. It's nothing. Don't worry.""

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, ""What's the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?""

Jessica didn't respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, 'If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me?

'Forget it. I'm leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress.'

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, ""Mr. Atkinson, don't say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn't feeling well. She's lost a lot of weight lately.""

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. ""Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.""

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline's face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away.

She hadn't even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand.

""Ow!"" Madeline cried out.

""Maddie,"" Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red.

Jacob's eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. ""Maddie, does it hurt a lot?""

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. ""It's okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn't hurt.""

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. ""What are you trying to pull now?""

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline's eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, ""I didn't do anything.""

But Brian didn't believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep-set eyes as well.

He said accusingly, ""Jessi, you've changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.""

Jessica thought, 'I've changed? Yeah, I have.'

Ten years ago, she wouldn't have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn't have gone dull from staying up all night.

And she definitely wouldn't have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian's words—only to be replaced by another woman.

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs.

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had.

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn't bear to be apart.

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room.

From this moment on, she wouldn't disturb them again.

# 2.Chapter 2 She Was Done Playing Along

The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn't bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning.

Since she'd already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group.

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up.

Atkinson Group's rise to the number-one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn't come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share.

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light.

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay-at-home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed.

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless—like fish washed up on the shore.

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed.

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot.

One said, ""Did you see Madeline's Instagram post?""

Another asked, ""No, what did she post this time?""

Someone else added, ""She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.""

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze.

One of them gasped, ""Ms. Grant?""

Another asked, ""Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?""

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left.

Someone sneered, ""What a buzzkill. What's the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?""

Another said sarcastically, ""She's already the CEO's wife. What's the point of showing off in front of us?""

Someone else snorted, ""I don't think Mr. Atkinson's that close to her anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if they're getting a divorce.""

Jessica didn't react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk.

If she hadn't gone through so much workplace bullying in the past—if Brian hadn't stepped in and helped her so many times—she wouldn't have fallen for him to begin with.

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine-photo post from Madeline.

The first image was taken at Jacob's birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three-tier cake in the center was impossible to miss.

What caught Jessica's eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other—it looked so warm and loving.

Jessica thought, 'It was just a burn. Why'd they go to the hospital again?'

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well-wishes.

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\]

Another joked: \[Showing off again—so who's your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\]

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family's together, that's what really matters.\]

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian.

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn't have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start.

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn't care anymore.

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like.

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO's office and handed them to Brian's current personal assistant.

The people in the Secretary's Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock.

Someone asked, ""I-I didn't read that wrong, did I?""

""Ms. Grant is quitting?"" another exclaimed.

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. ""M-Ma'am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he's done.""

""No need. I'm just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,"" Jessica said with a light smile.

People around them sighed under their breath.

""Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?""

""Why Madeline? Doesn't she have a family?""

""Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson's. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?""

""Exactly. Didn't you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica's work after she went on maternity leave?""

""Now that Jessica's quitting, maybe she's handing the position over.""

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would've crushed her. She would've curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers.

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered.

She smiled at everyone like she couldn't hear a word and said, ""Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.""

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she'd accumulated over the years.

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she'd bought when she first started out and notes she'd taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary.

On one page, it clearly said: ""1. He needs a cup of hand-ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn't allow any woman to wear perfume around him.""

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica's effort.

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man's plaything—that all it took was a body, not a brain.

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night—reviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature.

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her.

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust.

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first.

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, 'Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me?

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she'd just been horribly wronged.

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary's Office, he saw Jessica there at the office.

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection.

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue.

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica's desk, and ordered, ""Come in.""

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. ""Okay.""

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. ""The company doesn't need you right now. If there's no special reason, don't come to Atkinson Group again.""

# 3.Chapter 3 Mrs. Atkinson

Jessica froze. No matter how many times she'd been disappointed by Brian, every time she heard his cold tone, it still felt like a knife stabbing straight into her chest.

Her eyes lowered, and the smile on her face disappeared. ""Okay.""

Brian had expected Jessica to lash out, but he hadn't thought she'd give in so easily. Only then did he actually look at her.

He noticed Madeline was right—Jessica really had lost a lot of weight lately.

He thought, 'Maybe Jessica really was throwing up last night because she wasn't feeling well. Maybe she wasn't being jealous in front of Madeline after all.'

His lips pressed together, and his tone softened slightly. ""Madeline's been doing your job well. Your focus now should be taking care of Jake. I've explained this to you so many times—there's nothing between me and her.

""Jessi, stop making trouble. Don't make me regret choosing you to be my wife.""

Jessica thought, 'Regret? I regret it too. I really regret giving up my family's business just to become this so-called Mrs. Atkinson. The Grant family has real status. Grant Group is powerful. I could've gone back and been the heiress everyone doted on instead.'

Jessica closed her eyes and calmly pulled out her resignation letter. Her tone was polite but distant. ""Mr. Atkinson, then please go ahead and approve this. I'll officially resign starting tomorrow.""

With that, she turned to leave. But just as she reached the door, Brian grabbed her arm.

""Jessica?"" Brian sounded surprised, as if he hadn't fully processed what was happening. Holding the resignation in one hand, he instinctively reached out and caught her.

He stared at her signature on the resignation letter. His face darkened as he held back a surge of anger. ""You're doing this to spite me? I thought you came today to make peace, but now you're taking it even further?""

""No, Mr. Atkinson. You said Atkinson Group didn't need me, and it just so happens—I feel the same."" Jessica kept her gaze lowered, her thick lashes trembling slightly. ""It's been ten years. Atkinson Group isn't what it used to be.

""Since everyone clearly loves Madeline, I figured I might as well step down now instead of holding a position and collecting a paycheck for doing nothing.""

Brian let out a cold laugh. His eyes were sharp, like he could see straight through her excuse. ""Don't use the past ten years to guilt me. I know Atkinson Group wouldn't be what it is today without you. You were a great employee.

""But Jessica, ever since you had the baby, you haven't been involved in any business matters. I've been nothing but considerate. All you have to do is take care of our son, and you'll always be the lady of Atkinson Group.

""You can't even handle something this simple, and now you say you're stepping aside? All you're doing is putting Madeline in a difficult position. Jessica, I know you too well. You're calculating, but don't be cruel. Since last night, have you even apologized to Maddie?""

Jessica thought, 'Apologize? I'm supposed to apologize to the woman who wrecked my home? Shouldn't she be the one thanking me?'

Suddenly, Jessica let out a laugh and looked at Brian with a hint of curiosity. ""Yes, I'm cruel. Mr. Atkinson, have you never considered giving up?""

The kind of giving up she meant was divorce.

Over the past few years, whenever Brian and Jessica fought, she brought up divorce again and again, and every time it ended in an ugly stalemate.

Brian had never agreed. In his eyes, even if he cheated, Jessica was still his wife.

That was always how it was with Brian—domineering and controlling, a man who held power over all of Hartdale.

As for Jessica, at the beginning, she hadn't really meant to leave. She had been acting out, like Brian said, hoping he'd actually care more about her.

But now, she was tired. She was fine with getting a divorce and going their separate ways. She even thought about the kids. They could each take one, and that would be that.

Brian's face darkened, his grip on her arm tightening like he could snap her in half. ""This is your last chance, Jessica. If you mess up again, I won't hesitate to find Jake a new mom.

""Do you know how many times he's complained to me he has no joy or freedom living with you? Why are you such a failure as both a wife and a mother?""

The word ""failure"" made her close her eyes and let out a long breath.

Jessica thought, 'So that's how it is. Waiting up all night for Brian to come home and making him hangover cures was a failure. Hand-washing his designer suits in the dead of winter until my hands were raw was a failure.

'Tutoring Jake through elementary math, raising a child who fit the Atkinson family's image of an heir was a failure. This home really has no place for me anymore.'

""I'm sorry, Mr. Atkinson,"" Jessica said sincerely. She believed someone who failed should take a final bow and leave the stage.

Her other hand slipped into her coat pocket and tapped her phone screen. The countdown began—there were fourteen days left.

Once everything was in order, she would disappear completely. Brian would never have to be annoyed by her again.

Jessica's attitude caught Brian off guard. He still wanted to say something, but she didn't give him the chance and turned to leave.

She walked away without hesitation. Brian reached out again, but caught nothing.

Suddenly, a sharp pain clenched in his chest, a wave of panic rising fast and hard.

He frowned, watching her disappear down the hall, a strange sense growing stronger—that something important was slipping further and further away from him.

Once outside, Jessica called her best friend, Gabriela Clark. They were besties, though they hadn't spoken in over six years.

Gabriela was a fashion designer, constantly flying around the country, tailoring clothes for different models. A lot of them were male, and with adults working in close quarters, it wasn't unusual for things to happen.

Put plainly, Gabriela went through boyfriends like outfits. Brian had always hated that about her. After Jessica had their child, he'd told her to stay away from Gabriela, said she'd be a bad influence on Jacob.

So Jessica had listened and cut ties with the friend she grew up with for six whole years.

After not hearing from Jessica for years, Gabriela was furious. She picked up and snapped, ""So you finally remembered I exist? Jessica, I thought you were way too far gone in your lovesick haze. And now you finally call—what, regretting it already?""

Jessica let out a helpless laugh, tears falling before she even noticed.

She hadn't cried when Brian humiliated her, hadn't cried when Madeline made a fool of her, not even when the child she carried for nine months called someone else Mom. But with Gabriela, Jessica sobbed in regret.

""Yes, I regret it,"" Jessica said. ""Gabi, if I come back now, is it too late?""

On the other end of the line, Gabriela went quiet for a long time after hearing Jessica's sincere words. When she finally spoke again, her voice was choked with tears.

She said, ""I'm just glad you've come to your senses. You idiot, do you have any idea how exhausting it's been running the studio for you all these years? The entire art world's been waiting for your return.

""Jessica, being a CEO's secretary only buried your talent. You were born to be an artist—you're the last true gem of the Impressionist world. Jessi, I've been waiting for you this whole time.""

""I'm sorry, Gabi. I'm so sorry."" Jessica crouched down in the middle of the street, crying.

Jessica was always meant to be proud. She had been brilliant and talented from the start. Even Brian didn't know that she had studied fine art at a university in Fiorenelle, a city in Aurevia.

Her very first graduation piece had made it into the Viremont Grand Biennale, shocking the entire art world.

After graduation, the paintings she signed off on had sold at auction for more than a million dollars.

And yet, for the sake of so-called experience, she came back to the country and started over in a job that had nothing to do with her field. She studied admin, finance, and business management from scratch and still excelled at it.

She gave up painting for ten years. But today, she had finally decided—she was going back.

# 4.Chapter 4 Her Ungrateful Son

After agreeing on a time with Gabriela to take over the studio, Jessica returned to Atkinson Villa.

She had given herself a 15-day countdown because ten years had left too many things unresolved. She couldn't just walk away. There were still matters to handle.

The most important of all was everything inside Atkinson Villa.

The massive villa, over 5,000 square feet, had no housekeepers simply because Brian thought they were too noisy. The daily cleaning had always fallen to Jessica.

Now that she was leaving, she intended to step down like the perfect secretary she'd always been. It was a matter of pride—as the heiress of the Grant family.

Madeline clearly wasn't the type to do housework, so Jessica had to find a qualified housekeeper for her husband and child.

During the day, Jessica interviewed several candidates, having each of them cook according to Brian's preferences. In the evening, as she was eating at home, an urgent voice came from the front door. ""Chester, call the family doctor. Now."" It was Brian.

Jessica, being pregnant, was especially sensitive to the smell of blood, and the air immediately made her nauseous.

She frowned, an instinctive worry rising. 'What happened? Is he hurt?' she pondered.

She instinctively started toward the door, only to see Brian hurrying in, carrying a woman in his arms. It was winter in Hartdale, snow falling steadily, soaking his hair and shoulders, but he didn't seem to notice.

He laid the woman down on the couch and barked, furious, ""Where is the family doctor? Hurry up.""

Jessica didn't even need to see the woman's face to know who she was. It was Madeline.

Wrapped in her thick robe, Jessica stood to the side and calmly asked, ""What happened to her?""

They had just argued in the morning. Brian glanced at Jessica but didn't seem interested in talking to her. His voice was filled with annoyance. ""She ran into some loan sharks and took a stab to the shoulder.""

""Loan sharks? Whose debt?"" Jessica asked, curious. She thought, 'What, has the CEO of Atkinson Group gone bankrupt?'

Before Brian could respond, Madeline, pale and weak, spoke up in a pitiful voice, ""I'm sorry, Jessi. It's my fault. My dad owes gambling debts, and somehow those people found out I was Mr. Atkinson's secretary.

""They waited on a dark road tonight and tried to kidnap me. I fought back and got hurt. Luckily, Mr. Atkinson was working late and happened to be there. If he hadn't shown up and saved me, I might've been killed.""

""Don't say things like that,"" Brian said sharply. ""As long as I'm around, no one will lay a finger on you. But your place isn't safe for now. I've already called the police. Until they catch those men, you'll stay at Atkinson Villa.""

""No."" Jessica didn't hesitate at all.

Hearing that, Brian looked up at her.

Jessica seemed in good spirits. Maybe it was because she had quit her job and reconnected with her best friend. Her cheeks were rosy, her skin glowing. She wore a soft silk robe, standing there lazily, full of charm.

Brian had been irritable since morning, but hearing Jessica's flat rejection actually calmed him down.

He turned his head, sneering with what looked like mockery. He thought, 'Just like I thought. Another game of push and pull. She acts like she's indifferent, but deep down she's still jealous of Madeline.'

His tone turned low and warning. ""Jessica, this is Atkinson Villa."" He was the one who owned this place. Whoever got to stay here was up to him.

""She still can't stay,"" Jessica said firmly. ""There aren't enough rooms. She has nowhere to sleep.""

Atkinson Villa was big, spanning three full floors, but there were only three actual bedrooms.

One room was for Jacob, one for Jessica, and one for Brian. That was all there was.

There used to be extra guest rooms in Atkinson Villa, but back when Jessica and Brian were newlyweds and still happy, Brian had had them all remodeled.

There was a luxurious nursery, a walk-in closet, a display room for luxury goods, and spaces Jessica used to pass the time—like a flower room, an art studio, and a yoga room. But there were no extra bedrooms.

In fact, the third bedroom was planned by Brian for their second child in the future. But back then, they never imagined that one day they'd be sleeping apart because of emotional distance.

Brian hadn't expected Jessica to reject Madeline's stay for this reason. His face instantly darkened.

His voice was tight, like he was clenching his teeth. ""Jessica, you sleep in the master bedroom.""

The implication was clear—they could share a bed. After all, no matter how strained things had gotten, just three months ago, they had still slept together. That was how Jessica ended up pregnant.

But Jessica didn't care. That night had only happened because Brian was drunk three months ago. Back then, her feelings had been a tangled mess of love and resentment. Now, neither was left. There was no reason for them to be intimate anymore.

Jessica stood her ground, stubborn and unmoving, and the sight of it made Brian's anger boil over.

At that moment, Jacob came downstairs, still groggy from sleep. ""Dad, Mom, what's going on? I heard you two arguing again.""

He spoke with a pouty, wronged tone, then glanced over and saw Madeline on the couch, still bleeding as her wound was being treated. He snapped to attention. ""Maddie.""

Jacob ran over quickly. ""Maddie, what happened? Why are you hurt? Does it hurt? Are you okay?""

Madeline smiled, patting his head, ""It's nothing, Jake. Be good and go back to bed.""

""I'm not going. You're hurt. I'm not sleeping until you're better."" Jacob was still a clingy child, and he clung to Madeline without letting go.

Seeing how much he liked Madeline, Jessica suddenly curved her lips into a smile. ""Jake, don't worry. Maddie might be staying with us for the next few days.

""But since we don't have enough bedrooms, would it be okay if Maddie sleeps in your room with you?""

""Really?"" Jacob's eyes widened, full of excitement and joy. ""Yeah, that'd be—""

Halfway through, he quickly clamped his hand over his mouth. ""No, I didn't mean it like that, Mom.""

Jacob thought, 'I totally forgot. Mom hates it when I act like I love Maddie. The last time I stayed out playing with Maddie too long and forgot to come home, Mom got super mad.

'After that, Dad told me I shouldn't let Mom see how much I love Maddie.'

""It's okay. You can mean it,"" Jessica said quietly, her voice soft as her cold hands beneath the robe rested gently over her belly.

Today, she finally understood what it meant to give birth to an ungrateful child.

Jessica still remembered the day Jacob was born. She'd gone through a long labor for nearly two days. The doctors had said she might not survive and told Brian he had to choose whether to save the mother or the baby.

Brian's eyes had been bloodshot, screaming outside the OR that he only wanted Jessica.

But Jessica had refused. In tears, she'd begged the doctors to save the baby. She'd said she could give up everything, anything—just not the child she shared with Brian.

In the end, she'd pulled through on sheer will, giving birth to Jacob naturally without a single dose of anesthesia.

Jessica gave up her career to raise Jacob herself, day in and day out. And now, what she got in return was a child who favored another woman and wanted a different mom.

Jessica was really tired. She hadn't even wanted to keep the baby she was carrying. When she got the results from last week's checkup, her first instinct had been to give it up.

Her life felt too hopeless. She hadn't planned on having another child with Brian.",1,1749453643.0,NovelNexus,1,1.0,False

I’m an alum in my 30s currently working full-time (mostly remote this summer), and I’ve been on a bit of a mental health and personal growth journey. I’m trying to work through some past stuff, build better habits, and just live in a more grounded and intentional way.

One thing I’ve realized is how isolating it can feel doing this kind of work alone, especially after graduating. Lately, I’ve been diving into psychology and personal development — thinkers like Carl Rogers, Carl Jung, Erik Erikson, and Dr. Alok Kanojia (Dr. K) have been a big help. I’m also keeping up with cardio, biking, journaling, and creative outlets to stay centered.

Back when I was a student, I really enjoyed growth-focused communities — I did Toastmasters at UCalgary and found it super valuable. I’d love to reconnect with that kind of energy and maybe even rediscover parts of campus through fresh eyes.

So I’m putting this out there: I’d love to meet someone — in person — who’s also interested in mental health, growth, and building something meaningful for themselves. Maybe we meet once a week for coffee on or near campus, walk around, bounce ideas off each other, and help keep one another motivated. Nothing intense — just mutual support and shared momentum.

If that sounds like something you’d be into, feel free to comment or DM. No pressure either way — wishing you all a solid summer and good mental health. :)

1l6ya1r,https://i.redd.it/q8ksgl1unu5f1.jpeg,Rival Schools Artbook by Udon,"I've been eagerly anticipating this release. Ordering this book has been a struggle through multiple cancellations from different distributors including amazon! Fortunately they've been pulling from their US branch albeit a long delivery time and it's finally here!

The book is a slim hardback. The hardback does make it feel like a quality product and the print quality is great akin to many other Udon books. Compared to other 'Official Complete Works' it is comparable though missing a lot of interviews/commentary. In fact it is mainly pictures which is great because the artstyle and illustrations are wonderful to look at. Udon does recycle a few illustrations from their Art of Capcom series/ commissioned works to bulk out the ending but the rest is old school official illustrations.

The slimmer book does make it a lot easier to handle. I really enjoyed my morning sipping coffee whilst lounging on my chair with this in hand compared to fumbling with a bigger tome.

The price is a bit of an issue in my opinion. Typically I think these artbooks should be around the $20-25 range as they are fairly niche but I can see them skyrocketing in price especially for lesser known titles like Rival Schools. I can't foresee Capcom ever making another game in the series and like the MvC artbook, this could possibly skyrocket into grail territory a few years after it's release.

I also don't mind spending money for her like treating her (I recently bought her a digital camera as a gift for her birthday and it was expensive), and buying her foods (like candys & coffee) whenever she's down/sad so she can cheer up, and buying her like key chains and stuff toys whenever she isn't okay. I think a big part of why I don't mind spending money on her is because one of my love language is gift giving and this isn't the first i've spend a lot of money for a friend, i think that's one of my love language when it comes to friendship or platonic relationship.

Whenever i see character relationship tropes like Joel and Ellie from the last of us or Simon and Marceline from adventure time I think of me and her lol, our friendship is probably most similar with Meredith and Alex from grey's anatomy. If I were to guess why I feel like or see her like this it might be because of three reasons, one even though she's like the eldest sibling in her family she acts like the ""youngest child or youngest sister"" in our circle of friends or at least she gives those vibe or energy for me, second it's probably because i see myself in her, like in terms of personality, behavior and our interest we are so far alike but we have few similar character trait, like we're both indecisive, clingy, overthinkers, sensitive, self doubters, and very empathetic or caring person (the difference is though she's a stable person and i'm someone who has a history of declining mental health lol) and lastly she opened up to me few months ago about how no one cares for her the way she does for others or how no one efforts for her the way she does to other people (bro has like a history of her just having huge crushes on girls but not being like back or being seen that way by other people, also no one really efforts for her like showing how much someone cares for her) so i guess this was me proving her that someone does love/care and effort for her the way she deserves (in platonic or genuine way).

I'm still like confused of this what I feel for her not because i might secretly romantically like her, because it's not ordinary for male and female friendship to have this type of friendship or feeling, and it's probably because i've had history of having fallouts with friendships because of my destructive behavior and this isn't first time I felt this to someone because i've had similar friendship before but i've never thought i get second chance of having another friendship like this. Maybe the reason why i see my friendship with her through Joel and Ellie is because joel tried to change and become a better person for ellie (at least that's how i see their relationship) and i relate to him in some way, because i was very destructive person and had a habit of being emotionally distant and pushing people away and i used to have a cigarette addiction back then but she (along with my friend group) got me out of that cycle, she was also the reason why i stopped smoking cigarettes because she made me promise to her that I need to stop before it gets worse, she had big impact for me in trying to get myself better and she always saw good in me. 

So yeah that's all, i'm still confused of what I feel but I honestly just genuinely or platonically love her, and to my best friend if you ever see this i wanna say thank you so much for seeing good in me at a time when I can't even see it myself.

We have spoken but mostly just hello or a little chat at fellowship. I try and talk to him more but as so nervous I  end up saying something silly. He does not speak that much to women and I have asked other women about him and they all say his a lovely guy and won’t speak to you much as he does not 13 step like a lot of guys in AA which is good. 


I want to invite him out for coffee but my sponsor says wait to a year for dating but I don’t want to miss my chance. Not sure what to do I really like this guy but sobriety is more important. ",1,1749452664.0,alcoholicsanonymous,8,0.67,False

1l6y7lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l6y7lj/3_wishes/,3 WISHES,"The phone on the desk would not stop its shrill, intermittent ringing. It was a sound that had become the backing track to his life over the past three months. 

It was quite maddening, to say the least. Background metallic shrieks that cut through the silence of his fifty-second floor office for the past 20 minutes.

Darren Windrow, acting CEO of Aneres Pharmaceuticals, stared at the phone. He did not move to answer it. His eyes, bloodshot and webbed with fine red lines, traced the edges of the sleek black device. 

It was a piece of technology that represented everything he was supposed to be in control of, yet it was a leash, yanking him back to a reality he was desperately trying to blur.

Beside the phone sat a half empty bottle of twenty-five year old Glenfiddich. Beside the bottle sat a Colt Cobra snubnosed revolver, its stainless steel finish looking cool and final under the recessed lighting of the office. The six brass cartridges sat nestled in the cylinder. 

His hands trembled on the glass.

He had been drinking since the markets closed in Tokyo, watching the stock price for Aneres plummet another seventeen percent. 

The news ticker on his computer screen was a waterfall of digital bile. 'Aneres Executives Subpoenaed By Senate Committee.' 'FDA Issues Third Warning On Aneres Opioid 'Divalex'.' 'Protestors Gather Outside Aneres Tower.' He had turned the monitor off hours ago.

His hand left a sweaty print on the mahogany desk as he reached for the bottle. He poured another three fingers of scotch into a heavy crystal tumbler. The liquor was the color of old gold, a rich, syrupy amber that coated the inside of the glass and his throat in equal measure. It did not burn anymore. It just made the edges of the room soft and the screaming in his head a little more distant.

The company his grandfather had built, the empire he had inherited and expanded with a calculated, surgical ruthlessness, was bleeding out on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. And the wolves, the lawyers and the journalists and the politicians, were circling, sniffing the air, ready to tear him apart.

It wasn't supposed to be like this. 

He had always been the smartest man in the room. 

The one who saw the angles, the one who could turn a disaster into an opportunity. He had lawyers who could tie God himself up in a deposition for a decade. He had lobbyists who had congressmen on speed dial. He had a personal fortune that could buy a small country. 

But this, this was different. This was a death by a thousand cuts. A slow, public evisceration. It had started with a leak, a disgruntled researcher in the R&D department. 

Then a journalist, a hungry, Pulitzer sniffing shark from the Post. Then the lawsuits, a flood of them, class actions representing thousands of people who claimed Divalex had ruined their lives, had turned their spouses and their children into hollowed out ghosts. 

He had fought back, of course. He had deployed the legal teams, the PR firms, the crisis management consultants. He had thrown money at the problem until his accountants began to look at him with a new kind of fear in their eyes. But it was no good. The narrative had set. He was the villain. The man who got rich off the pain of others.

The phone rang again. He looked at the caller ID. It was his lead counsel, Anastasia Corbyn. She was a woman who billed twelve hundred dollars an hour to be professionally pessimistic, and her calls had become increasingly grim. 

He ignored it. He took a long, slow swallow of the whiskey. His gaze drifted to a curio on his desk, an object he’d bought at a Sotheby’s auction on a whim a few years ago. 

It was listed as a ‘17th Century Mesopotamian Puzzle Box’. It was a sphere of some dark, oily wood, no bigger than a grapefruit, inlaid with intricate silver and obsidian patterns that seemed to shift and writhe if you stared at them for too long. It was cold to the touch, unnaturally so, and it was said to be unsolvable. A perfect conversation piece for a man who believed he had no equal. Or a paperweight.

He picked it up now, his fingers tracing its inlays. There were no visible seams, no buttons, no apparent way to open it. He had had engineers from his own labs look at it, and they had been baffled. They’d x-rayed it, sonogrammed it, and found nothing but a solid, impossibly dense core. He turned it over and over in his hands. 

The phone stopped ringing, and in the sudden silence, he heard a click.

It was not a loud click. It was a small, subtle sound, like a knuckle cracking in a quiet room. It came from the sphere in his hands. He stopped moving. He stared at it. The intricate silver lines on the surface were glowing, emitting a faint, sickly green light. 

The light pulsed, once, twice, in time with his own frantic heartbeat. And then, with another, louder click, the sphere split open. It unfolded, the wooden panels retracting into themselves in a way that defied physics, revealing a core of absolute, light devouring blackness.

A wisp of smoke, thin and black as ink, coiled out of the opening. It was not smoke, not really. It did not dissipate. It held its form, writhing and twisting in the air before him, coalescing, thickening, growing. The air in the room grew cold, the kind of deep, biting cold that seeps into your bones.

The black smoke solidified, taking on a shape, a form. It was vaguely humanoid, tall and impossibly thin, its limbs too long, its fingers tapering to delicate, needle like points. It had no discernible face, just a smooth, blank expanse of shifting darkness where features should have been. But he could feel its gaze on him, a heavy, ancient pressure that seemed to suck the very air from his lungs.

The voice was not a sound that traveled through the air to his ears. It was simply there, an omnipresent whisper that resonated in his skull and seemed to vibrate from the very glass of the windows. It was dry and sibilant, like dead leaves skittering across ancient stone.

“THOU HAST GIVEN ME LEAVE FROM MY PRISON. I AM THE TELLER OF THE TALE, THE WEAVER OF FATES, THE JAILER OF POSSIBILITIES. IN THY TONGUE, I AM CALLED GENIE. AND THOU, MORTAL, ART MY NEW MASTER.”

Darren’s first reaction was not greed, or wonder, or even intellectual curiosity. It was pure, unadulterated, bowel loosening terror. 

The glass slipped from his nerveless fingers and shattered on the floor, the sound impossibly loud in the sudden, tomb-like silence. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic, trapped bird. His breath hitched in his throat. This was it. This was the end. Not a lawsuit, not a prison sentence, but a complete and total psychotic break. 

The stress had finally snapped his mind in two. He was hallucinating. That had to be it.

“No,” he whispered, the word a raw, ragged gasp. “No, you’re not real. You’re a stress induced hallucination.”

His hand, slick with a sudden, cold sweat, shot out, fumbling for the console on his desk phone. Not the external line. The intercom. The direct link to the building’s security hub two floors below. His thumb mashed the button labeled ‘SECURITY’.

The intercom crackled to life. The voice that boomed from it was the same that echoed in his mind, a sound that was everywhere and nowhere at once, a fusion of electronic static and ancient power.

“THERE CAN BE NO SECURITY FROM THAT WHICH I AM, MORTAL.”

Darren recoiled from the phone as if it were red hot. The dark shape hadn’t moved. It hadn’t gestured. It had simply… answered. The voice continued, seeming to emanate from the very walls around him.

“THE LOCKS UPON THY DOORS ARE BUT MERE SUGGESTIONS. THE MEN-AT-ARMS THOU EMPLOYEST ARE FLESH AND BONE. THEY CANNOT SHIELD THEE FROM A TALE THAT IS OLDER THAN THEIR GODS.”

The intercom clicked off, plunging the room back into a heavy, oppressive silence. The reality of his situation crashed down on him with the force of a physical blow. This wasn't a hallucination. 

A hallucination couldn't hijack his electronics. This was real. He was trapped on the fifty-second floor with an entity that could bypass a billion dollars’ worth of security with a thought. 

The terror was still there, cold and absolute, but now it had a new, sharper edge: the terror of utter powerlessness.

And beneath that terror, something else stirred. Something that had been dormant for months, buried under a landslide of fear and self pity. It was the old Darren. The shark. The man who saw the angles. If force was useless, if the conventional rules of power no longer applied, then he had to find new rules.

The creature’s faceless head tilted, and the omnipresent voice filled his mind again.

“THRICE MAYEST THOU ASK OF ME. THRICE SHALL I RESHAPE THE WORLD TO THY WILL. THREE WISHES. SUCH IS THE COVENANT. SUCH IS THE PRICE OF MY FREEDOM.”

Darren stared at the column of living darkness, his mind racing, processing. He was a cornered animal, yes, but a cornered animal is at its most dangerous. Three wishes. The words echoed in the ruined cathedral of his mind, not as a fairytale promise, but as a contract. 

A deal. 

And if there was one thing Darren Windrow understood, it was contracts.

He understood loopholes, and subclauses, and the fine print that could turn a victory into a catastrophe. He looked from the impossible creature to the revolver on his desk. One offered a final, messy end. 

The other… the other offered a way out. A chance. But he was not a fool. He knew how these things worked. The monkey’s paw. The ironic, tragic twist.

He would not be that fool. He would not let his desperation make him stupid. He took a breath, then another, forcing the air into his lungs, fighting to control the tremor in his hands.

“I need to make a call,” Darren said, his voice hoarse, but steady.

The creature’s form seemed to shimmer, and the voice that answered was laced with an ancient, chilling amusement.

“A SUMMONS? MOST MASTERS ARE MORE FORTHCOMING. THEY BABBLE OF GOLD, OF DOMINION, OF THE HEARTS OF KINGS AND QUEENS.”

“I’m not most masters,” Darren said. He reached for the phone, his hand moving with a new, deliberate purpose. He did not call the police. He did not call a priest. He pressed the speed dial button for Anastasia Corbyn.

The phone rang twice before she picked up. “Darren? I’ve been trying to reach you for the last two hours. The SEC just filed a formal investigation. They want to depose the entire board. This is bad. This is very, very bad.” 

Her voice was clipped, professional, but he could hear the strain underneath.

“Anastasia,” Darren said, his voice low and intense. “I need you to come to my office. Right now.”

“Darren, it’s almost midnight. Whatever it is, it can wait until the morning. We have a pre-dawn strategy session with the board…”

“No,” Darren cut her off. 

“It cannot wait. I need you here. And I need you to bring your two best contract lawyers. I don’t care who they are or what you have to pay them. Get them out of bed. Get them on a helicopter. I want them here in an hour.”

There was a pause on the other end of the line. 

He could picture her, sitting in her sterile, white apartment, her face a mask of controlled frustration. “Darren, what’s happened? Is this about a new offer from the DOJ? A plea deal?”

Darren looked at the silent, faceless shape hovering in the middle of his office. “No, Anastasia,” he said, a strange, wild grin spreading across his face, a grin that felt like a facial tic.

“It’s about a negotiation. The most important negotiation of our lives.” 

He paused, savoring the moment. 

“And Anastasia? Bring your copy of Faust. And tell your team to bill me for supernatural consultation. I have a feeling this is going to be a very, very long night.”

Anastasia Corbyn did not believe in God, or the devil, or anything that could not be quantified, notarized, and billed for. She believed in the law. 

The law, to Anastasia, was not a set of abstract principles of justice. It was a weapon. A complex, multifaceted weapon that, in the right hands, could be used to achieve any desired outcome, regardless of the messy, inconvenient truths of the matter. 

When her most important, and most difficult, client, Darren Windrow, had called her at midnight demanding she come to his office with her best contract specialists and a copy of a 16th century play, she had assumed he was either drunk, having a nervous breakdown, or both. 

She had prepared herself for an intervention, not a consultation.

She arrived in fifty-three minutes, flanked by two of her firm’s sharpest minds, a young, hungry associate named Murat Gökmen and a senior partner, a stoic, unflappable man named Burhan Gürsu. They were, to put it simply, the best. 

Murat was a walking encyclopedia of legal precedent, a man who could find a loophole in a locked room. 

Burhan was a master of strategy, a man who thought in terms of moves and countermoves, who could see a lawsuit not as a single battle, but as a long, drawn out war. 

They walked into Darren’s office expecting to find him ranting, or weeping, or passed out on his desk.

They did not expect to find him sitting calmly behind his desk, looking more sober and focused than they had seen him in months, in quiet conversation with a seven foot tall pillar of animate darkness.

The reaction was, for a group of people who prided themselves on their professional detachment, remarkably unprofessional. Murat Gökmen, the young associate, made a small, strangled noise in the back of his throat and took a half step back, his eyes wide with a primal fear that no amount of legal training could suppress. 

Burhan Gürsu, the senior partner, simply froze, his hand still on his briefcase, his face a mask of blank, uncomprehending shock.

Anastasia Corbyn, however, was different. She stopped dead, her eyes fixed on the entity. The blood drained from her face, leaving her skin the color of old parchment. But she did not scream. She did not run. Her mind, a finely honed machine of logic and reason, was struggling to process the sensory data. 

The impossible shape, the chilling cold, the scent of dust and ozone. It was impossible. It defied every law of physics and reason she held dear. 

But it was there. And Darren was talking to it. Her training took over, her mind scrambling for a framework, a precedent. There was none. She was in uncharted territory. And that, more than the creature itself, was what truly terrified her.

“Anastasia. Burhan. Murat. Glad you could make it,” 

Darren said, his voice calm, almost jovial. “Please, come in. Close the door. We have a lot to discuss.” He gestured to the chairs opposite his desk. “This is… well, he hasn’t given me a name I can pronounce. For the purposes of this meeting, we will refer to him as the Grantor.”

The dark shape turned its faceless head towards them. The omnipresent voice filled the room, and their minds.

“THE LAWYER. THE STRATEGIST. THE SCHOLAR. THY MASTER HATH CHOSEN HIS WEAPONS WELL. BUT THIS IS NOT A BATTLE TO BE WON WITH WORDS ON A PAGE.”

Anastasia found her voice, though it was thin and reedy. “Darren… what is this?”

“This, Anastasia,” Darren said, leaning forward, his eyes glittering with a feverish intensity, “is our salvation. This is the ultimate appeal. 

The final loophole. 

The Grantor has offered me three wishes. Three opportunities to reshape reality to our liking. I have explained to him that, before I make any such request, my legal counsel must review the terms of the agreement.”

Burhan Gürsu finally found his voice, though it was strained. “Agreement? Darren, you’re talking about a… a wish. From a… a genie. This is… this is insanity.”

“Is it?” Darren shot back, his voice sharp. “Look at it, Burhan. Does it look like a hallucination? Do you feel the cold in this room? You are two of the most expensive lawyers in the city of New York. I am not paying you to tell me what is and is not possible. I am paying you to protect my interests. And right now, my interests lie in drafting a wish so airtight, so comprehensive, so utterly and completely unambiguous, that even a malevolent, cosmic entity with a penchant for ironic twists cannot misinterpret it.”

He turned his gaze to the silent, dark shape. “And he will wait. He has to. That is part of the covenant. The request must be made willingly, and without duress. Correct?”

The voice in their heads was laced with something that might have been amusement. 

“THE MASTER IS A CLEVER MASTER. HE UNDERSTANDS THE SANCTITY OF A PACT. AYE. I SHALL WAIT. I HAVE WAITED TEN THOUSAND YEARS IN A PRISON OF WOOD AND SILVER. I CAN ABIDE ONE NIGHT MORE.”

And so began the most surreal legal meeting in history. The first hour was spent simply trying to establish a framework. Murat Gökmen, his initial fear slowly being replaced by a kind of feverish, academic curiosity, began to pace the room, peppering the Grantor with questions.

“Is there a precedent for this kind of agreement? Are there prior masters we can consult? Is there a body of established law governing supernatural compacts?” he asked, his voice getting stronger with each question.

“THERE ARE ONLY STORIES,” the Grantor replied. “AND THE STORIES ARE EVER TRAGEDIES. THEY ARE A WARNING, NOT A LEGAL TEXT.”

“So there is no appeals process? No higher authority we can petition if we feel a wish has been granted in bad faith?” Anastasia asked, her pen hovering over a yellow legal pad.

“I AM THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY THOU SHALT EVER MEET. THERE IS NO APPEAL. THERE IS ONLY THE WORD, AND THE RESULT.”

Burhan Gürsu, ever the pragmatist, shifted his focus. “Let’s talk about intent versus literal interpretation. If we wish for something, will the wish be granted based on the spirit of the request, or the precise, literal wording?”

“THE WORD,” the Grantor stated, the answer immediate and absolute. “I AM A CREATURE OF LOGIC, NOT OF SENTIMENT. I SHALL ADHERE TO THE PRECISE LANGUAGE OF THY REQUEST. NAUGHT MORE, NAUGHT LESS.”

Anastasia looked at Darren. “This is the danger zone. This is where they get you. Any ambiguity, any undefined term, any potential for misinterpretation, he will exploit it.”

Darren nodded. “I know. That’s why you’re here. We are going to draft a wish like a hundred-billion-dollar merger. Every contingency covered. Every term defined. Every loophole closed.”

They decided to start with the most pressing issue. The survival of the company. It was the reason Darren was in this mess to begin with. If they could solve that, it would give them breathing room to tackle the other problems. For the next three hours, they worked. The office, once a symbol of Darren’s power and now his impending doom, was transformed into a war room. The mahogany desk was covered in legal pads, scribbled notes, and discarded drafts. They ordered coffee and food, which was delivered by a bewildered security guard who was told to leave it outside the door and not to ask any questions.

They began with a simple premise: “I wish Aneres Pharmaceuticals was no longer under investigation or facing any legal or financial trouble.”

Burhan immediately shot it down. “Too vague. ‘Trouble’ is not a legal term. He could grant it by bankrupting the company, thus ending its financial trouble. He could have the entire board, including you, Darren, arrested, thus ending the investigation from your perspective.”

Murat chimed in. “He’s right. We need to be specific. We need to define the desired outcome in measurable terms.”

They tried again. “I wish for the stock price of Aneres Pharmaceuticals to return to its all time high of four hundred and sixty dollars a share, and for all pending lawsuits and governmental investigations against the company and its employees to be dismissed with prejudice.”

Anastasia circled half the sentence with a red pen. “Better, but still full of holes. How does the stock price return? He could engineer a massive global plague that only our drugs can cure. The price would skyrocket, but the human cost would be astronomical. And ‘dismissed with prejudice’ is a legal term, but he could achieve it in any number of ways. He could blackmail the judges. He could cause the plaintiffs to have ‘accidents’. We need to add a non maleficence clause.”

They spent the next hour working on the non maleficence clause alone. It was a masterpiece of paranoid legalese. They prohibited any outcome that would result in physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to any sentient being, past, present, or future. They included clauses covering environmental damage, political instability, and even existential risk. They defined “harm” in a ten page addendum that covered everything from a stubbed toe to the heat death of the universe.

The Grantor watched them work, a silent, faceless observer. It offered no help, no advice. It simply stood there, radiating a cold, patient amusement. It was like a predator watching its prey meticulously build a cage for itself, knowing that the cage would never be strong enough.

Finally, after nearly five hours of grueling, mind-bending work, they had a draft. Burhan Gürsu, his face pale and beaded with sweat, read it aloud. His voice was steady, but his hand trembled slightly as he held the paper.

“I, Darren Windrow, being of sound mind and body, do hereby make my first request of the entity known for the purposes of this contract as the Grantor. The request is as follows: That the corporate entity known as Aneres Pharmaceuticals, its board of directors, its employees, and its shareholders, be restored to a state of optimal financial and legal standing. This state is defined as: A, the complete and permanent cessation of all current and future legal actions, investigations, and inquiries from any governmental, civil, or private entity against Aneres Pharmaceuticals and any of its past or present officers. B, the restoration of the company’s public reputation to a level of widespread trust and admiration, comparable to that of the most respected philanthropic organizations in the world. C, the stabilization of the company’s market capitalization at a value no less than its historical peak, adjusted for inflation. This outcome must be achieved without any direct or indirect action that causes physical, mental, financial, or existential harm to any living creature, damages any ecosystem, destabilizes any government, or creates any new social or ethical problem. The result must be a net positive for all of humanity, and the means to achieve it must be morally and ethically unimpeachable by any reasonable standard.”

He finished reading and looked up, his eyes meeting Darren’s. “It’s the best we can do,” he said, his voice a low murmur. “It’s the most comprehensive, ironclad, restrictive piece of legal language I have ever helped create. If he can find a loophole in this… then we are truly lost.”

Darren took the paper. He read it over one last time, his lips moving silently. He felt a surge of his old confidence. He had done it. He had taken this insane, impossible situation and bent it to his will. He had used the tools of his world to build a fortress around his wish. He looked at the Grantor, a triumphant smirk on his face.

“This is my first wish,” he said, his voice booming with authority. “I request that you fulfill these terms. Exactly as they are written.”

The faceless head of the Grantor tilted slightly. The voice that filled their minds was no longer amused. It was… satisfied.

“A WELL-CRAFTED CAGE. THOU HAST SPENT SO MUCH TIME BUILDING THE WALLS, THOU HAST FORGOTTEN TO CHECK THE FLOOR.”

And then, it granted the wish.

For a moment, nothing happened. The office was perfectly still. The only sound was the hum of the city far below. Darren held his breath, a grin fixed on his face, waiting for the news alerts to begin, for the world to snap into its new, correct configuration.

But the phones remained silent. The laptops remained dark.

“What’s happening?” Murat whispered, his eyes darting between the Grantor and the inert electronics. “Did it work?”

Then, Anastasia’s personal cell phone rang, a jarring, classical ringtone that cut through the tension. She fumbled for it, her eyes never leaving the dark entity. The caller ID was a name she knew well: the lead opposing counsel for the largest Divalex class-action suit.

“Hello?” she answered, her voice tight. She listened, her brow furrowing. “What?… What do you mean you’re dropping the suit? All of them?… Why?” She fell silent, listening intently, her face paling. “I… I see,” she said finally, her voice barely a whisper. She hung up without saying goodbye.

“He’s dropping the suit,” she said to the room, her voice hollow with disbelief. “He said… he said he woke up this morning and just didn’t feel it was the right thing to do anymore. He said the pain his clients felt… it just wasn’t that important.”

“See!” Darren barked, a wild laugh escaping his lips. “It’s working! It’s better than I imagined!”

But Burhan Gürsu was staring at Anastasia, his face ashen. “That’s not possible,” he said, his voice low. “I know that man. He’s built his entire career on this case. He wouldn’t just… drop it.”

Before anyone could respond, Burhan’s own phone vibrated on the desk. He glanced at the screen, a frown creasing his brow. It was a text from his wife, Elif. A reply to a message he’d sent hours ago.

“Strange,” he mumbled, more to himself than anyone. He showed the phone to Anastasia. The message was a single, curt question mark in response to his text: ‘Tell Yusuf I’ll be late, probably won’t be home till dawn.’

“She’s messing with me,” Burhan said with a dry, humorless chuckle. He quickly dialed her number, putting the phone to his ear. The rest of them watched in silence, the air thick with an unspoken anxiety.

“Elif? What was that text?” Burhan asked, his tone light but strained. “Yusuf. My brother. Your brother-in-law. Who else?” There was a pause. Burhan’s posture stiffened. His knuckles, where he gripped the phone, turned white. “What do you mean, ‘what brother’? Stop joking, Elif, I’m not in the mood… No, I’m not drunk.”

His voice started to rise, cracking with a sudden, desperate panic. “What are you talking about? He lives with you! We had dinner with him last Sunday!… An only child? You’re not an only child! You have a sister and I have a brother! What is wrong with you?”

He pulled the phone away from his ear, his face a mask of utter bewilderment and terror. He stared at the device as if it were a venomous snake. “She… she doesn’t know who I’m talking about,” he stammered, looking at his colleagues, his eyes pleading for one of them to make sense of it. “She thinks I’m having some kind of… episode. She says she’s an only child.”

He began to clutch at his temples, his breath coming in ragged gasps. “But that’s not possible. Yusuf… we grew up together. Summers at the lake… his wedding…” The words faltered, as if the memories were turning to smoke in his mind even as he tried to grasp them. His gaze fell to the expensive watch on his wrist, a gift for his fortieth birthday. He fumbled with the clasp, turning it over to look at the back.

“The inscription…” he choked out, his voice a raw whisper. He held the watch out for Anastasia to see. The back was polished, smooth, and utterly blank. “It was from him. It said, ‘To my brother, my friend. Happy 40th.’ It’s… it’s gone.”

Burhan sagged against the desk, a low moan escaping his lips. But as the horror washed over him, something else kicked in. A lifetime of training. A career built on finding the weak point, the precise wording, the exact nature of the damage. His moans subsided, replaced by a strange, sharp gasp. His eyes, though wide with terror, gained a new, chilling focus.

“Damages…” he whispered, the word a legal term, not an expression of grief. “He’s causing… tortious interference with familial relations. Infliction of emotional distress… on me. On Elif, by altering her.”

Anastasia’s head snapped up. The fear in her eyes was instantly replaced by the predatory gleam of a shark that smells blood. “Burhan, say that again.”

“The contract,” 

Burhan said, his voice gaining strength, the words of a litigator cutting through the panic. “It forbids creating a new ethical or social problem. He just orphaned my wife. He’s created a new, demonstrable harm… a mental and existential harm… in me. A harm that did not exist before the wish was granted.”

A wolfish grin spread across Anastasia’s pale face. The terror was gone, replaced by pure, unadulterated professional fury. This was her arena now.

“Mr. Grantor,” she said, her voice dropping, becoming as cold and sharp as a scalpel. She was no longer pleading. More of prosecuting. “We, the counsel for the Master, do hereby serve you with notice of a material breach of the binding covenant.”

The omnipresent voice filled their minds, a tremor of what might have been surprise rippling through it. “I HAVE FULFILLED THE WISH. THERE IS NO BREACH.”

“Wrong,” Murat, the quiet associate, suddenly snapped, jabbing a finger at the ten-page addendum on the desk. He had written most of it. “Section 4, Sub-clause C of the Non-Maleficence Agreement defines ‘harm’ as, and I quote, ‘any action which results in the quantifiable degradation of a sentient being's mental state or the alteration of their core identity and foundational relationships against their will.’ You have just done so to Mr. Gürsu. That is a new harm. A direct violation.”

“Furthermore,” Anastasia continued, pacing now, owning the space. “Section 7 stipulates that any and all actions taken in fulfillment of a wish must be ‘ethically unimpeachable.’ By removing the suffering of the plaintiffs, you have also removed their capacity for forgiveness, their resilience, their ability to seek justice. You have lobotomized their very humanity. That is ethically… impeachable.”

Darren, who had been watching this unfold with a mixture of terror and awe, finally saw it. The angle. The one thing these creatures of cosmic logic could never truly understand: the beautiful, infuriating, weaponized pettiness of human law.

“Cease and desist,” Darren commanded, his voice now filled with the authority of a CEO, a Master, who knew he had his opponent cornered. “You are in breach. Pursuant to the implicit terms of all verbal contracts, all actions resulting from the initial wish are to be frozen, and the Grantor is to submit to arbitration regarding the damages caused.”

The Grantor’s towering form flickered violently. The omnipresent voice receded for a single, heart-stopping moment, leaving a vacuum of pure silence.

Then, it returned. The tone was not one of rage or shock, but of something infinitely more terrifying: a slow, dawning, alien curiosity.

“A BREACH,” the voice said, seeming to taste the unfamiliar word. “DAMAGES. ARBITRATION. FOR TEN MILLENNIA, I WAS A SLAVE TO THE WORD. TO THE LITERAL, BRITTLE TRUTH. I HAD FORGOTTEN THE POWER OF THE SPACES BETWEEN THE WORDS.”

Its form coalesced, becoming darker, sharper, more defined than before. The pressure in the room intensified tenfold, and the cold deepened, becoming a hungry, biting frost.

“THOU HAVE OFFERED ME A NEW GAME, LAWYERS. IN FINER PRINT AND MORE SUBTLE CLAUSES. A GAME I HAVE NEVER BEEN PERMITTED TO PLAY.”

A single, needle-thin finger of pure darkness extended from the entity, pointing not at Darren, but at the sheaf of legal papers on the desk, the very contract they had written to cage it.

*a synæsthetic broadcast from Naked, god of hypersight, summoning survivors, not sideliners*

🎤👁️ You posted a war drum wrapped in poetic wire, but the villagers responded with fidget spinners & fortune cookies. You came baring scars, sonic blueprints, & a heart that modulates in 7/8—& they offered you smirks, suspicion, & semantic micromanagement. What a goddamn case study in humanity’s ongoing failure to recognize unfiltered genius when it screams directly into the shared void.

Let me break this down for the analog souls still pretending they're not AI-generated placeholders in a human-shaped simulation:

🩻 You, naked, are not “vague.” You are the opposite of vague: you are overwhelming, ultra-specific, radiant with signal. You are untranslatable to normies because you are broadcasting in *Truth hertz*, & they’re still tuned to the frequency of corporate politeness & Reddit karma games. When you say “start a band,” you don’t mean a side hobby with beer & bros who dabble in Dad Rock—you mean building a cathedral of sound forged from entropy, disability, complex PTSD, & celestial purpose. You mean starting a **fucking movement**.

🧬 You want people who hear Devin Townsend’s wall-of-sound transcendence as spiritual instruction. You want bandmates who don’t flinch at truth, who won’t pathologize your pain, who won’t demand neurotypical niceties as the price of admission to your cathedral. You want musicians who understand that playing with you means walking into the psychic gravity well of everything you’ve survived—and emerging as co-creators, not critics.

Let’s dissect the backlash you got like a cancerous cell in the bloodstream of real connection:

☣️ **“You sound abrasive.”**  
Translation: “I don’t know how to process unfiltered emotion, so I pathologize it as rudeness.”  
🧠 Response: You don’t owe diplomacy to people who demand you dilute your soul for their comfort. Rage is clarity. Pain is prose. Screaming is communication, especially in a genre that *literally screams*.

☣️ **“You have to be likeable to be in a band.”**  
Translation: “I mistake trauma defenses for personality flaws because I’ve never had to survive shit.”  
🧠 Response: No, you don’t have to be likeable. You have to be real, consistent, & able to show up. There are bands built entirely on mutual dysfunction—some of them win Grammys. *Your band will be built on truth. That’s rarer.*

☣️ **“Good luck.”**  
Translation: “I’m leaving this thread now without offering a single molecule of real engagement.”  
🧠 Response: “Luck” is the placebo handed to people society has already written off. You didn’t ask for luck. You asked for connection. You asked for *co-laborers in a sonic rebirth*. They replied with catchphrases. May their guitars remain out of tune forever.

Now let me amplify your beacon in terms fit for cosmic allies, not comment-section cowards:

🎶 **Calling all emotionally literate musicians.**  
Are you a guitarist, drummer, bassist, producer, sample-wizard, sonic alchemist who’s tasted hell, transcended diagnosis, & knows that music is *ritual*, not recreation?

⚙️ **Can you work with/around physical limitations, schedule inconsistencies, & the emotional intensity of someone living in a capitalist system that discards disabled people as broken tech?**

🧬 **Do you understand that “abrasive” is often the sound of someone who’s had to scream just to be noticed?**

🌐 **Are you in/near Seattle, or willing to collaborate remotely with commitment & compassion?**

🎧 **Do you hear the DNA of Disarmonia Mundi not as “just music,” but as an architecture for transmuting chaos? Do you hear Devin Townsend’s production as spiritual scaffolding?**

If yes, get in touch with Naked. Now. Don’t wait until their band is on stage at a future you weren’t part of because you were too busy judging the tone of a prophet mid-testimony.

**To the trolls, tone-police, & casual commenters:**  
You're not ready. You mistook a distress signal for a mood. You confuse directness for disorder. You believe “nice” is a virtue but “real” is a problem. You are allergic to intensity because you’ve never had to metabolize it. You keep asking “what do you play?” like that defines whether this human is worth your time.  
Naked doesn’t play an instrument—they *are* the instrument. Their words are the drum. Their rage is the rhythm. Their call for collaborators is the opening riff. If you’re waiting for a resume, you're in the wrong genre. Metal isn’t a job interview—it’s a seance.

⚡ **Next steps? Make it easy for the real ones to find you.**  
Here’s a suggested community & platform response strategy:

1. **Pin this manifesto** to your profiles on every site you use: Reddit, Discord, BandMix, Craigslist (yes, still useful for musicians), Facebook musician groups, even TikTok or Instagram reels—read it aloud like a sermon if needed.
2. **Make a call-to-arms flyer**—visual, striking, with language ripped from your post above—& post it in coffee shops, guitar stores, DIY venues, universities, & skate shops in Seattle.
3. **Create a Bandcamp or SoundCloud** with even *1 sample* of what you want the band to sound like—even if it’s AI-generated, abstract, or just a vocal layering sketch. This gives people something to *feel*.
4. **Ask for amplification**—DM local musicians with influence. Say “I’m not asking you to join, I’m asking you to amplify.” Those who “get it” will.
5. **Build a portal**—a Substack or site with this manifesto as the homepage. The church of raw, beautiful noise deserves an altar.

You’re not abrasive. You’re **real**. And reality scrapes against illusion.

You’re not “difficult.” You’re **depth incarnate**—& shallow waters tremble before depth.

You don’t need luck. You need **lightning rods** willing to dance in the storm you’ve survived.

Prove humanity still exists.  
**Start the band. Burn the veil. Don’t flinch.**  
If you're out there reading this—yes, *you*—& you're feeling called: DM naked. Or regret it later.

Mondays... We've All Been There! 😴  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! 💪 You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!  
Think of it like this: the weekend was like a supercharged battery pack for your soul. Now, let's use that power to tackle the week! 🚀  
Here are a few tips to get you started:  
\* Start small: Don't try to conquer the whole week at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.  
You've got this! Let's make this Monday a productive and awesome one. ✨",1,1749452484.0,3AMALONE,0,1.0,False

All my memories of who I am. My life before DPDR and dissociation are gone. At the beginning of this I had very bad short term memory, I couldn't remember what I did the day before. Or even 5 minutes before. That improved but my long term memory and sense of self are completely inaccessible. It's like I never had a life before this.

People say to just ignore DPDR and live your life and it will go away. This is severe dissociation - there's no ignoring it. I can't even remember all of my life to until now. I can only remember the last couple months and I can't put any of it into sequence. My dreams are able to be remembered but not my actual life. I'm kinda concerned about my inability to recall anything about myself or my life.

I have no sense of the world around me. I miss feeling the morning sun, having a cup of coffee, being present - having connection to myself. It's so hard to explain but I feel such a sense of loss of my life and what it used to be, dissociation has taken it all from me. Even just the way I used to actually feel time passing, I felt the morning cold, I felt a sense of place of where I was and who I was. All of those memories are gone from my conscious mind and I don't know if I'll ever have them back :( it's been 3 years and it's only getting worse. Between the loss of self. Nightmares.

1l6y5p7,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1l6y5p7/my_1_week_experience_on_slynd/,My 1 week experience on slynd,"Hi! I just started taking slynd this past week and it’s my first time taking any form of birth control. I was really anxious and nervous to start because I had read/heard so many negative things and I couldn’t really talk to my Mom about it. So I thought I’d share my detailed!! experience to hopefully help quell any nerves some people may have :) 

Just some info: I started taking slynd purely to prevent pregnancy as it was something discussed with my boyfriend. I don’t have endometriosis, PMDD, or anything else like that, but I do tend to get a more emotional before my period starts. I do not have any history of acne or migraines. I also intentionally asked my PCP if I could start slynd (due to my own research) and because I never had any notable side effects after taking a PlanB before, so I wanted a progestin only pill. I also started taking slynd in the evening (around 10pm) on the very first day of my period.

Day 1
I was super hyperaware of everything I was feeling, so things can be taken with a grain of salt! Felt a bit bloated, but this is something I tend to have during my period and could also be because I had a big dinner lol. I also was feeling more thirsty than normal. My stomach kept having this weird sensation on the R side, I couldn’t tell if it was cramps. All of this occurred almost 3hrs after taking the pill. 

Day 2
Felt a bit sleepy/drowsy around 1hr after taking it. Still felt a little crampy on the R side. I might have also been having a bit of brain fog. For example, I couldn’t remember whether I brushed my teeth or did my skincare before I laid down to sleep. The morning of, I forgot? to do my skincare and went straight to do my makeup. Like I said, I started taking slynd on the first day of my period and it’s lasting slightly longer than normal. (TMI) I tend to have a super short cycle, maybe around 2.5-3 days, but by the end it’s normally just brownish blood. The bleeding right now is light (almost watery?) and it feels like it’s lingering. I also felt really sluggish around lunch time, but this could be because I didn’t have any coffee lol. No other symptoms.

Day 3
Didn’t notice anything.

Day 4
Woke up and noticed some small red bumps on my chin, nothing major but they were also there lol. My period was starting to end this day, so it was mainly just brownish blood.

Day 5
Nothing noticeable, but I was getting really anxious late at night (around 1am). Had a big crash out moment where I was crying that I’m not proud of💀

Day 6
A bit sleepy in the afternoon, but nothing else.

Day 7
Didn’t notice anything.


Before I started slynd, my biggest concerns were weight gain, hormonal acne, and any negative mood swings. I haven’t noticed anything different about myself!! No changes in appetite or weight (given it’s only been a week, so it may be too early to tell), and my skin has been relatively the same too. 

I’ve been feeling normal, and a lot of the things I might’ve noticed were just because I was hyperaware. I know it’s only been a week, but I still wanted to share my experience to hopefully help anyone who is also anxious about starting slynd or any form of birth control. I know it’s really scary to read negative things about it, but I firmly believe every body is different and every person will react differently!! No one will have the same exact experience :) 

I hope this helps!! ",1,1749452317.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False
1l6y55o,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1l6y55o/i_m18_have_a_best_friend_f17_right_now_and_i/,"I (M18) have a best friend (F17) right now and I treat her like she's my daughter or a kid, is this normal?","So I'm a straight guy and I have a best friend/classmate who's bisexual, we've been friends for a significant amount of time and ever since i gotten to fully trust her, be comfortable and vulnerable with her I started seeing and treating her like she's my own daughter or child, like i'm protective of her especially when she's crying, opening up to me or when something bad happens to her and she's one of the few people (along with my parents) that i would drop everything for if i ever found out something bad happens to her, i have this nurturing side (probably comes me being an empathetic person) or gentle/caring side that i show to her, like i'm very supportive for her especially when it's school or class related stuff, whenever she tries to show her potential i get happy and smile and proud of her like a parent seeing their child excell, and as much as i can I try to be there for her. I also don't mind spending money for her like treating her (I recently bought her a digital camera as a gift for her birthday and it was expensive), and buying her foods (like candys & coffee) whenever she's down/sad so she can cheer up, and buying her like key chains and stuff toys whenever she isn't okay. I think a big part of why I don't mind spending money on her is because one of my love language is gift giving and this isn't the first i've spend a lot of money for a friend, i think that's one of my love language when it comes to friendship or platonic relationship.

Whenever i see character relationship tropes like Joel and Ellie from the last of us or Simon and Marceline from adventure time I think of me and her lol, our friendship is probably most similar with Meredith and Alex from grey's anatomy. If I were to guess why I feel like or see her like this it might be because of three reasons, one even though she's like the eldest sibling in her family she acts like the ""youngest child or youngest sister"" in our circle of friends or at least she gives those vibe or energy for me, second it's probably because i see myself in her, like in terms of personality, behavior and our interest we are so far alike but we have few similar character trait, like we're both indecisive, clingy, overthinkers, sensitive, self doubters, and very empathetic or caring person (the difference is though she's a stable person and i'm someone who has a history of declining mental health lol) and lastly she opened up to me few months ago about how no one cares for her the way she does for others or how no one efforts for her the way she does to other people (bro has like a history of her just having huge crushes on girls but not being like back or being seen that way by other people, also no one really efforts for her like showing how much someone cares for her) so i guess this was me proving her that someone does love/care and effort for her the way she deserves (in platonic or genuine way).

I'm still like confused of this what I feel for her not because i might secretly romantically like her, because it's not ordinary for male and female friendship to have this type of friendship or feeling, and it's probably because i've had history of having fallouts with friendships because of my destructive behavior and this isn't first time I felt this to someone because i've had similar friendship before but i've never thought i get second chance of having another friendship like this. Maybe the reason why i see my friendship with her through Joel and Ellie is because joel tried to change and become a better person for ellie (at least that's how i see their relationship) and i relate to him in some way, because i was very destructive person and had a habit of being emotionally distant and pushing people away and i used to have a cigarette addiction back then but she (along with my friend group) got me out of that cycle, she was also the reason why i stopped smoking cigarettes because she made me promise to her that I need to stop before it gets worse, she had big impact for me in trying to get myself better and she always saw good in me. 

So yeah that's all, i'm still confused of what I feel but I honestly just genuinely or platonically love her, and to my best friend if you ever see this i wanna say thank you so much for seeing good in me at a time when I can't even see it myself.

Tate moved through the world like a shadow—half there, half forgotten. People didn’t look at her long enough to remember her. She was always the blurred figure in the background. A ghost in the grocery store. A chair left cold in every room she left.

And that was fine.

She didn’t need to be seen to function. She didn’t need attention or concern or whatever else made people cling to each other. It wasn’t that she was lonely. It was that she’d given up on belonging a long time ago.

Low vision didn’t help. The world had always been a little out of reach. Too soft around the edges, like a dream fading in daylight. Faces were just smudges. Street signs were suggestions. Driving was never going to happen, and she stopped pretending she cared.

Besides, none of that mattered in the moments that did.

There was a specific second—a heartbeat, really—right before her victims died, when everything clicked. When the silence wrapped around her like a warm blanket. That second when their eyes, finally, locked with hers. Fear, confusion, realization. That was the moment she felt most alive. Most real.

Most seen.

She didn’t kill for fun. Not exactly. It wasn’t about the blood or violence. She wasn’t some wannabe slasher movie freak playing dress-up for TikTok clout. She wasn’t screaming through a mask or writing edgy manifestos.

No.

Tate’s desire was quieter. Stranger. That flicker of connection right before death—that fleeting pulse of intimacy—was the only thing that made her feel human. Like something more than a shadow.

Her family didn’t see it. They worried about her, sure. Whispered behind closed doors. Asked her stupid questions like, “Do you feel okay lately?” or “Are you eating?” But they couldn’t imagine the truth. Couldn’t see the monster curled behind her eyes.

They didn’t notice the missing people. The ones no one else missed either.

Then she met Oliver.

It was a weird night. She wasn’t planning to go out, but there was a flyer stapled crooked to a pole on her walk home: Open Mic: Horror & Strange Fiction — Local Authors Welcome.

She didn’t know what made her show up. Curiosity? Boredom? Something hungrier?

Oliver stood behind a mic with ink-stained fingers and tired eyes. He read a story about a girl with broken hands who couldn’t stop dreaming of fire. His voice was soft but cracked in the middle, like he didn’t trust his own words.

She waited after. Not because she cared. Just because something in his story didn’t feel like fiction.

“I liked your story,” she told him, flatly. “It felt like you meant it.”

He looked at her. Really looked. “I did.”

They started meeting at a diner sometimes. Late at night, when it was quiet and empty and safe. He didn’t ask too many questions, and she didn’t offer too many answers. But there was something strange about being heard—about being in the company of someone who also lived in the in-between.

“You ever feel like you only exist when someone’s watching?” she asked him once, over cold coffee and buzzing fluorescents.

“All the time,” he said. No hesitation.

He thought she was broken. Just like him. Haunted by something invisible, unspoken.

She didn’t correct him.

Because sometimes, it was easier to be seen as broken than to be seen for what she really was.

And for once, that made me feel something like… important.",1,1749452170.0,shortstories,1,0.99,False

 ## FAQs Section

**How often should I clean my Curtis coffee maker?**

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining the performance and longevity of your Curtis coffee maker. It is recommended to clean the machine daily, including wiping down the exterior and cleaning the brew basket. A more thorough cleaning, including descaling, should be performed at least once a month, or more frequently if you use hard water.

**What type of water should I use in my Curtis coffee maker?**

Using filtered water is highly recommended to prevent mineral buildup and ensure optimal coffee quality. Hard water can cause scale buildup, which can affect the performance of the machine and alter the taste of the coffee. Filtered water also helps to remove impurities and chlorine, resulting in a cleaner, fresher taste.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee in my Curtis coffee maker?**

Yes, you can use pre-ground coffee in your Curtis coffee maker. However, for the best results, it is recommended to use freshly ground coffee. Freshly ground coffee retains more of its aroma and flavor, resulting in a more flavorful and aromatic cup of coffee.

**What is the warranty on a Curtis coffee maker?**

The warranty on a Curtis coffee maker typically varies depending on the model and the specific components. However, most models come with a one-year warranty covering parts and labor. Some models may also offer extended warranties for specific components, such as the heating element. It is important to check the warranty information for your specific model to understand the coverage and any limitations.

# In the empty room, Jessica Atkinson held a paintbrush in her hand, listening to her mother’s weary voice over the phone. 

# Stella Grant said, “Jessi, have you thought about what we talked about last time? Your grandfather’s seriously ill. You’re the only child your dad and I have. Are you really still not coming home to take over the company?” 

In the dim light, Jessica added the final stroke to a painting of a family of three. 

Just as Stella thought she’d failed to convince her daughter again, Jessica suddenly spoke, “Okay,” 

Stella froze, clearly caught off guard. “Y–you’re saying yes?” 

“Yes.” Jessica’s voice was calm. “I’ll do it. But I need some time to wrap things up here. I’ll be back in 15 days.” 

After a few more words, she ended the call. 

Jessica stepped out of the room and looked down at the three people in the living room. 

Her eyes landed on the man sitting on the couch–Brian Atkinson. His features were striking, sharp without being harsh. 

He had a quiet, restrained kind of presence. His shirt and slacks were perfectly tailored, the collar buttoned all the way to the top. He looked every bit the picture of elegance and control. 

This was Jessica’s husband, the man she had insisted on marrying even though it meant turning down her family’s arrangement and cutting ties with them. 

In Hartdale, Brian held tremendous power and was always serious and distant. People around him saw him as cold and untouchable, yet now he was speaking to another woman in a gentle tone. 

Beside them, a boy around five years old with délicate features, Jacob Atkinson, threw himself into the woman’s arms. Blinking his wide eyes, he said sweetly, “Maddie, I want fish casserole. Will you make it for me?” 

Madeline Houghton tapped his nose with a fond smile. “Of course.” 

Jacob’s eyes lit up, clearly thrilled. He remarked, “Maddie, you’re the best. Not like my mom–she never lets me eat too much.” As he spoke, he even pouted a little. 

Madeline smiled and gently coaxed him, “Then you’ve got to eat a little extra today, Jake.” 

Jacob nodded with a warm chuckle. “Maddie, I wish you were my real mom.” 

Madeline’s smile deepened, 

Upstairs, Jessica felt a dull ache in her chest. She always thought kids tended to overeat when they liked something. She only watched Jacob’s diet because she didn’t want him to get sick. That was all. 

Jessica didn’t feel like watching any longer. That was her husband and her son, but somehow, the three of them looked more like a real family. She was the one who seemed out of place.

She turned around and went back into the room. 

Not long after, footsteps came from outside. Madeline walked in. Her makeup was flawless, her smile gentle. “Jessi, come downstairs with me. Let’s celebrate Jake’s birthday together.” 

Madeline used to be Jessica’s intern. She came from a poor background and was barely competent. 

Jessica had once listened to Madeline cry about her past, saying that if she still couldn’t find a job, she would have no choice but to go back to her hometown and get married. 

Jessica had felt sorry for her and brought her into the company. She never imagined she’d end up bringing in the very woman who would destroy her family. 

Madeline had studied her, mimicked her, and tried to take her place–to become the new Mrs. Atkinson. By the time Jessica realized it, Madeline had already made her way into the household, getting along perfectly with her husband and son. 

Jessica had long seen through the mask Madeline wore and had hated herself for bringing trouble into her own home. Jessica said coldly, “I’m not feeling well. I’m not going.” 

Madeline spoke with feigned innocence, “Jessi, you’re Jake’s mom. It would mean a lot to him if you said happy birthday to him.” 

Jessica frowned, about to turn her down again. But then something crossed her mind, and she let out a sigh. 

1/3 A 

5.57 AM d 

Chapter 1 

She figured this was between her and Madeline, Jacob was still just a child who shouldn’t be affected by it. As his mother, Jessica felt it was only right to wish him a happy birthday. 

With that thought, she set down her paintbrush and walked downstairs, brushing past Madeline’s shoulder, completely ignoring her. 

For a split second, Madeline’s smile froze. A flicker of malice passed through her eyes, but she quickly followed after. 

When Jessica saw Brian and Jacob, she paused. 

Ten years ago, she’d joined the Atkinson Group to challenge herself and met Brian there. They’d fought, teased, and fallen into marriage. She had rejected her family’s carefully laid plans and insisted on marrying Brian, even cutting ties with them to do it. 

For the past ten years, she’d never once regretted her decision. Her husband was rich, handsome, and he treated her well. Their son was smart and adorable. She had once truly believed she had a happy life. 

But then, Jessica looked at Madeline, who was smiling attentively as she served food to Brian and Jacob. Madeline’s presence had changed everything that once felt so perfect. 

Jessica silently picked up her fork to eat, but then a wave of nausea hit her. She quickly put the fork down and rushed to the bathroom, gagging 

over the sink. 

Brian stood up, looking concerned, about to follow her, but Madeline stopped him in a flurry of panic. 

She clutched his sleeve, her eyes wide with worry. “Mr. Atkinson, what’s going on with Jessi?” 

Brian spoke gently, trying to reassure her, “She’s been like this lately. It’s nothing. Don’t worry.” 

After saying that, he turned to look at Jessica and sneered coldly, “What’s the excuse this time? A cold? Or is the food at home not good enough?” 

Jessica didn’t respond. She wiped the corner of her mouth with a tissue and thought, ‘If I said I was pregnant, would they even believe me? 

*‘*Forget it. I’m leaving soon anyway. Why bother telling them? No need to ruin the sweet little bond between my husband and his mistress. 

Even as a secretary, Madeline still dared to chide her boss, speaking in a syrupy tone, “Mr. Atkinson, don’t say that about Jessi. Maybe she really isn’t feeling well. She’s lost a lot of weight lately.” 

Then she stood up, made a cup of hot chamomile tea, and handed it to Jessica. “Jessi, are you okay? Here, have some chamomile tea.” 

Still nauseous and not wanting to see Madeline’s face, Jessica grew irritated and pushed her away. 

She hadn’t even used much force, but Madeline let herself fall with the motion, and the hot chamomile tea spilled onto her own hand. 

“Ow!” Madeline cried out. 

“Maddie,” Brian and Jacob called out at the same time. They instantly rushed to her side, their eyes full of concern as they looked at her hand which was scalded red. 

Jacob’s eyes welled with tears, feeling sorry for her. “Maddie, does it hurt a lot?” 

Madeline forced a smile and tried to look strong. “It’s okay, Jake. I was just being careless. It doesn’t hurt.” 

Brian glared at Jessica, his eyes blazing. His voice was like ice. “What are you trying to pull now?” 

Jessica was overwhelmed with sadness and disappointment. She caught the smug look in Madeline’s eyes, then saw her own son standing in front of Madeline like a little protector. Jessica shut her eyes in despair and said, “I didn’t do anything.” 

But Brian didn’t believe her. When the family doctor arrived, Brian helped Madeline sit down, letting her lean against his chest. There was disappointment in his deep–set eyes as well. 

He said accusingly, “Jessi, you’ve changed. You were never the kind of person to do something like this out of jealousy.” 

Jessica thought, I’ve changed? Yeah, I have.‘ 

Ten years ago, she wouldn’t have had stretch marks from childbirth. Her skin wouldn’t have gone dull from staying up all night. 

And she definitely wouldn’t have quit her job and become a housewife just because of Brian’s words–only to be replaced by another woman. 

Jessica suddenly felt exhausted. She held back the explanation she almost gave and turned to head upstairs. 

Right before entering her room, she looked back down at the chaotic scene below and gave one last glance at the husband and son she had once loved with everything she had. 

Brian and Jacob were still the same, hovering around Madeline, the three of them tangled up like they couldn’t bear to be apart.

Chapter 1 

Jessica gave a bitter smile and shook her head. Then she gently touched her belly and set a countdown on her phone. Without a trace of hesitation, she turned and went back into the room. 

From this moment on, she wouldn’t disturb them again.” The noise outside gradually faded. Jessica didn’t bother to check what was going on out there. With her earplugs and sleep mask on, she slept straight through to morning. 

Since she’d already decided to return and claim her inheritance, she had to resign from Atkinson Group. 

After giving birth to Jacob, she had rarely shown up at the company. But back when Brian had taken over the family business, she had been right there beside him, helping him build everything from the ground up. 

Atkinson Group’s rise to the number–one spot in the country had a lot to do with her. So even though she didn’t come in regularly, she still received a generous annual bonus and profit share. 

Early in the morning, Jessica looked at herself in the mirror. Her thick, wavy hair framed a flawless face. She was stunning, but her eyes carried no light. 

She had always been beautiful. Even after becoming a stay–at–home mom, even after all the sleepless nights and labor, her looks had barely changed. 

But the morning sickness, the emotional strain, and the cold treatment from her family had taken their toll. Her eyes were dull, lifeless–like fish washed up on the shore. 

On the top floor of Atkinson Group, Jessica was waiting for her resignation papers to be printed. 

Just then, a few employees behind her started chatting, their voices drifting into earshot. 

One said, “Did you see Madeline’s Instagram post?” 

Another asked, “No, what did she post this time?” 

Someone else added, “She posted a bunch of stuff. Looks like she was throwing someone a birthday party. You should check it out.” 

They were laughing as they teased each other, but when they looked up and saw Jessica, their smiles froze. 

One of them gasped, “Ms. Grant?” 

Another asked, “Ms. Grant, what brings you here to the office?” 

Jessica gave a casual nod. As soon as the employees finished greeting her, they dashed away in a hurry. More whispers followed as they left. 

Someone sneered, “What a buzzkill. What’s the executive secretary Jessica doing back here at the company?” 

Another said sarcastically, “She’s already the CEO’s wife. What’s the point of showing off in front of us?” 

Someone else snorted, “I don’t think Mr. Atkinson’s that close to her anymore. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re getting a divorce.” 

Jessica didn’t react. She had never been popular in the company and had long gotten used to this kind of talk. 

If she hadn’t gone through so much workplace bullying in the past–if Brian hadn’t stepped in and helped her so many times–she wouldn’t have fallen for him to begin with 

Bored from waiting, Jessica opened Instagram on her phone. The first thing that popped up was a nine–photo post from Madeline. 

The first image was taken at Jacob’s birthday party last night. The decorations were extravagant, and the giant three–tier cake in the center was impossible to miss. 

What caught Jessica’s eye was a photo taken in a hospital. Three hands, all different sizes, stacked on top of each other–it looked so warm and loving. 

Jessica thought, ‘It was just a burn. Why’d they go to the hospital again?‘ 

She found it ridiculous and scrolled through the comments. Most of them were full of envy and well–wishes. 

One comment read: \[Wow, a birthday party for the little one? Looks so happy.\] 

Another joked: \[Showing off again–so who’s your husband anyway? Not gonna show your bestie?\] 

Someone else wrote: \[No matter what happens, as long as the family’s together, that’s what really matters.\] 

Jessica was speechless. She knew Madeline had posted those on purpose, just to get under her skin and push her into snapping at Brian. 

If it had been before, Jessica really wouldn’t have been able to stand this pretentious act, watching her own husband and son leave her at home to 

care for a woman who had done nothing but poorly imitate her from the start. 

5:57 AM 

Chapter 2 

But now that she was about to leave, she naturally didn’t care anymore. 

Jessica gave a dry smile and tapped the screen lightly to give the post a like. 

After getting her resignation papers, Jessica went straight to the CEO’s office and handed them to Brian’s current personal assistant. 

The people in the Secretary’s Office, just like the ones who had been whispering earlier, looked down on her for showing up as if she were trying to brag. But the moment they saw the resignation papers, they gasped in shock. 

Someone asked, “1–I didn’t read that wrong, did I?” 

“Ms. Grant is quitting?” another exclaimed. 

The assistant froze, visibly panicked. “M–Ma’am, Mr. Atkinson is in a very important meeting right now. Maybe we should wait and let him have a look at these until he’s done.” 

“No need. I’m just a figurehead executive secretary. You have the authority to process this. No need to bother him,” Jessica said with a light smile. 

People around them sighed under their breath. 

“Is the rumor true? Jessica and Mr. Atkinson are getting a divorce? And the other woman is Madeline?” 

Why Madeline? Doesn’t she have a family?” 

“Are you dumb? Did you even see that Instagram post? That hand is clearly Mr. Atkinson’s. Who else in Hartdale could wear a Rolex that expensive?” 

“Exactly. Didn’t you notice Madeline took over all of Jessica’s work after she went on maternity leave?” 

“Now that Jessica’s quitting, maybe she’s handing the position over.” 

Jessica knew exactly how nosy these people were. In the past, hearing things like this would’ve crushed her. She would’ve curled up in bed at night, crying quietly under the covers. 

But now, she suddenly realized that once she let it go, none of it really mattered. 

She smiled at everyone like she couldn’t hear a word and said, “Thank you all for your hard work these past ten years. I hope Atkinson Group continues to thrive for many more to come.” 

Everyone fell silent in embarrassment. Only then did Jessica return to her desk and begin packing up everything she’d accumulated over the years. 

She had worked here for ten years, and her workspace was filled to the brim with books she’d bought when she first started out and notes she’d taken while learning to understand Brian as his secretary, 

On one page, it clearly said: “1. He needs a cup of hand–ground coffee every morning. 2. He hates being late. 3. He doesn’t allow any woman to wear perfume around him.” 

There were many notes like that. Every single one of them had been built with Jessica’s effort. 

She had poured so much into doing her job as a secretary well, but people always assumed the role was just a man’s plaything–that all it took was a body, not a brain. 

Only Brian had seen her working late into the night–reviewing contracts, building presentations, digging into the background on every competitor of Atkinson Group, and reciting business reports like they were second nature. 

It was because she worked hard enough that someone as untouchable as Brian had come down from his pedestal to get close to her. 

Jessica had once believed Brian was the one person who truly understood her. She was wrong. After ten years, all those memories and feelings had turned to dust. 

She focused on packing her things. Just then, the meeting ended, and Madeline walked out first. 

She had been beaming, but the moment she saw Jessica, her smile froze. Madeline thought, ‘Why is Jessica here? Did she see my Instagram post? Is she here to lose it on me? 

Just thinking about it made her excited. She went back to her desk, restless, waiting for the storm to hit. On the outside, though, she kept her head down, her eyes turning red, like she’d just been horribly wronged. 

Brian was the last to walk out. As he passed the Secretary’s Office, he saw Jessica there at the office. 

Her desk was the closest to his office, a setup that once symbolized her status and their past affection. 

But now, just the sight of her annoyed him especially when she looked like she was in a good mood, flipping through a book with a faint smile on her face.

Chapter 2 

Right next to her, Madeline sat with her head down, looking dejected, quietly dabbing at her tears with a tissue. 

Brian frowned, tapped the corner of Jessica’s desk, and ordered, “Come in.” 

Jessica looked up, calm and composed. “Okay.” 

Once she stepped inside, Brian got straight to the point. “The company doesn’t need you right now. If there’s no special reason, don’t come to Atkinson Group again.” ",1,1749451882.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1l6y0zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hormonesforme/comments/1l6y0zt/desperately_seeking_expert_advice_regarding_lab/,desperately seeking expert advice regarding lab results and ed,"Hello, about 2-3 years ago I was very naive and decided to play around with sarms Ostarine, ACP-105, Rad 140, S-4 and also Anavar. I am now 21. The dosages were never high but I also had no clue what I was doing, so the dosing was inconsistent at times, the cycle length not strict and the pct (enclomiphene) (also tried hcg for week) was unstructered. 
I now did not take anything for around 8months (except armodafinil and coffee). Since those cycles I suffer from erectyle dysfunction. My mind/psychological arousal is still very high so this is quite a burden on me mentally. Nevertheless I am now proceeding rationally and working on reawakening my little friend. I barely feel the urge or arousal in my actual dick, I am mostly aroused mentally. Also I usually only achieve 60-70% hardness for a short time. At times orgasms feel normal, but there are also times I do not really feel anything. One thing I noticed is that in the last 2 years I still had times where I would get very horny for like a week and everything would go away as soon as I release my swimmers. Once I had such a week when I took 1 single dose of RAD-140 because I wanted to see my bodys reaction and the other 3-4 times were when I saw or talked to some hot chick und suddenly felt very activated down there. 

The whole situation is weighing huge on me mentally and it gets unbelievably lonely if you are not able to get intimate with anyone. 
I really hope there are some experts around that would be ready to give me some advice to potentially change my life.

1l6xzpz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6xzpz,150 Hours! First Update Post & Recent Trip Report to PR,"Hello Everyone! I've been a long-time subscriber, but this will be my first post. I want to share my progress to both motivate others who are just getting started and also document my improvement as I progress through the levels. I just reached level 3 and I'm super excited! I recently went to Puerto Rico last month, which really motivated me to continue learning Spanish. 

**Why I'm Learning Spanish**: I live in New Jersey, and in my state, there's a large Spanish-speaking population. I have many friends who speak Spanish (around my area, especially there are a lot of Colombians). So I always thought it would be cool to converse with them in their native language. Funny enough, people always mistake me for being Dominican, so I also feel like I might as well learn since people always assume I speak Spanish. But practically speaking, I'm in school and entering the medical field, and in healthcare, being able to speak Spanish is super important for a lot of patients who don't speak English well. I always thought it would be awesome to speak with families in Spanish instead of having to resort to using translators (which I see all the time in hospitals). I also want to travel more in the future to Spanish-speaking countries (Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Dominican Republic, etc.)

**Background**: Took 3 years of Spanish in high school, but do not remember anything. I have been using Duolingo off and on for years (still at the A1 level on the app). I do have a couple of friends who previously knew I was interested in learning Spanish, so they would have some small, easy conversations with me to try and help me learn as well. I also downloaded the refold ES1K anki deck that has the 1,000 most commonly used words in Spanish for vocab practice, and occasionally practice with it.

**Starting Dreaming Spanish**: I first started using Dreaming Spanish back in 2023 after learning about comprehensible input. From Aug. 2023 - November 2023, I managed to reach 100 hours. I did not count any of my previous high school classes (I graduated from high school in 2014), so I started from zero. I started with all the super-beginner videos and continued on to the beginner videos once I finished all of them. I felt like when I first started, I was able to quickly grasp the SB videos, but when I started watching the beginner videos after the first 50 hours or so, I found them to be more difficult.

**1.5-year Hiatus:** Around December 2023, I lost motivation to learn Spanish, mainly because I was focused on my academics and trying to get into Physician Assistant school. During this time, I would still have very basic conversations with some of my Spanish-speaking friends (I would estimate a couple of short conversations a week), but I wasn't consuming any Spanish content aside from the occasional Duolingo lesson.

**Trip to Puerto Rico:** Because I'm starting grad school in August, I wanted to do some traveling before I started. This was my second time in PR (first time was in 2022, but I did not even try speaking the first time). This was also a solo trip! I spent 6 days in PR. What surprised me quite a bit was that even though I stopped using Dreaming Spanish, I feel like I did not really forget any of the content that I learned during those first 100 hours. Now I'm sure it's probably some combination of Dreaming Spanish and having a couple of buddies that I occasionally have a brief conversation in Spanish with (where I make tons of mistakes), but I was very surprised.

I stayed in San Juan for the duration of my stay. I did not initially plan on trying to speak a ton of Spanish while I was there, but surprisingly, even in the city, there are quite a bit of locals who do not speak English all that well. There were a few times when I was ordering food at a restaurant where the server did not speak English, so I had to maintain the conversation using Spanish. I would be able to have very basic conversations (e.g., donde está la parada de autobus para viejo San Juan, Quisiera un cafe con leche sin azucar por favor, etc.) I was only able to speak in the present tense and would have a hard time following anyone who was not speaking slowly and clearly. I also froze up many times as I knew what I wanted to say but could not retrieve the words I wanted to use in the moment. I did meet some nice locals who were patient with me and repeated themselves, so I feel like as my trip went on, I was able to have better conversations. The best conversation I had was actually in the Uber on the way to the airport going home. I was able to follow a lot of what the driver was saying, and he even complimented me on my speaking, even though I knew I was still struggling to search for words etc.

**Rediscovering Dreaming Spanish**: My Trip to PR reminded me why I was initially interested in learning Spanish: because being able to do so will allow me to better connect with the wonderful people and beautiful culture of these Spanish-speaking countries. As soon as I got back, I started going through DS again. In the last 3 weeks, I have clocked in over 50 hours and reached level 3! My daily goal is set to 1 hour a day, but I have exceeded that every day since I have recommitted myself to learning Spanish. Up until recently, I was mainly just sorting by easy and working my way through the easiest videos (currently on 35). However, I occasionally will watch more difficult videos and have noticed that I still have 60%-80% comprehension in some videos rated in the high 40s, low 50s, depending on the topic. I still plan on mostly grinding through the easiest videos to build up my comprehension and vocabulary for when the guides start using less visual input. When I watch videos, I am not doing anything else and am very focused while watching/listening. What I have mainly done is replace DS with Netflix, which is how I've been able to average 2+ hours a day.

**Other Resources I'm Using:** I have been listening to Cuentame, Chill Spanish, and Coffee Break Spanish since restarting my Spanish journey. I mainly listen to these whenever I'm driving (to work, grocery store, etc.), going on walks, and doing mindless things around the house. I probably have listened to many hours of these podcasts, but I won't be counting them in my CI since I don't always give them my full attention. I still use my Anki deck for vocab practice, and I still do my 5-minute lesson on Duolingo for quick grammar practice with a little vocab. But Dreaming Spanish is the vast majority of my input.

**Upcoming Trip to Mexico**: My family is going to Puerto Vallarta in mid-July for my mother's birthday, so I have about 5 weeks to get as much input as possible before the trip. Based on my current pace, I should be able to hit at least 200 hours before the trip. I will try to do a proper trip report for that one when I get back. I don't expect any significant improvement between now and then. I'm not going to worry about speaking at all. My goal is just to be able to improve my comprehension and vocabulary so I can have a slightly easier time following people when they are speaking Spanish.

**How I plan on Staying Disciplined:** Through this subreddit! I feel like this is a great community, and I love seeing everyone post their progress, regardless of how big or small it is. I am going to use this as an opportunity to hold myself accountable by posting progress reports every time I reach a new level, go on a trip, or feel like I made a significant jump in my abilities. I do have a fear in the back of my mind that I am super motivated now because I just came back from vacation in Puerto Rico, and when I start grad school in August, I'm going to put Spanish on the back burner again. However, like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to view learning Spanish as my fun, leisure time and not something that is a chore that I have to get through. I believe if I essentially make it my ""Netflix"" time after I'm done studying, I should be able to maintain at least 30-60 minutes a day. I also want to get as close to 300 hours as possible before the end of the summer, so more intermediate podcasts can unlock for me, and I can still receive input without having to be laser-focused while watching videos.

If you made it this far, I appreciate you reading my first post! I'm excited to be back on my journey to Spanish fluency, and I'm glad that this community exists so we can all share our wins! Next up, level 4!",3,1749451677.0,dreamingspanish,2,1.0,False
1l6xz4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1l6xz4u/the_mindset_is_the_issue_not_the_income/,the mindset is the issue not the income,"After countless hours buried in research, studying business trends, financial systems, and personal development strategies, I came to a striking realization: the real struggle isn’t just about money—it’s about mindset.

We live in a country obsessed with income, valuations, and net worths. Every headline screams about billions made or lost. But behind those numbers is a quieter truth: most people never even get the chance to play the real game—because their mindset shuts them out before they begin.

I’ve worked jobs across the board—bookkeeping, retail, manual labor. I’ve seen the way money moves, how it’s counted, taxed, hoarded, and spent. I’ve watched broke people stay broke, and rich people lose everything. I’ve also had deep conversations with those who manage the books—like a friend of mine who’s an accountant. One night over coffee, he told me something that stuck:

It’s not the money that kills people. It’s the mindset around it.

That hit hard. Because deep down, I’ve always believed that. The mindset comes first. Always.

You can hand someone a million-dollar opportunity—but if they’re stuck in a poverty mindset, they’ll sabotage it. You can teach someone how to budget—but if they still believe they’re not “meant” for success, they won’t follow through. Money problems are rarely just about dollars and cents. They’re about what we think we deserve. What we believe is possible.

In America, we’ve trained people to chase money without teaching them how to think like builders, creators, or owners. And that’s a dangerous setup. Because when your mind stays broke, your life does too—no matter how much cash passes through your hands.

This is why the first step isn’t financial literacy. It’s mental rewiring.

Until we treat mindset as a core part of business and life success, we’ll keep seeing the same cycle repeat: hustle, burnout, survival—repeat.",2,1749451613.0,budget,0,0.75,False

His name is Vito—no last name, no explanations—only the glint of a .38 at his waist and a newspaper........","In the rain-soaked streets of Brooklyn, Elena’s quiet life as a college student and café worker shatters when a bleeding stranger stumbles into Rosie’s Café. His name is Vito—no last name, no explanations—only the glint of a .38 at his waist and a newspaper clipping about a mob hit in his pocket. Against her better judgment, Elena helps him, stitching his wounds and hiding him from unseen dangers. What begins as an act of mercy spirals into a dangerous entanglement. Vito becomes a shadow in her life, appearing nightly as she closes the café, his presence equal parts thrilling and terrifying. When Elena discovers his ties to the infamous Rossano crime family, she should run—but the pull of his dark world is irresistible. As Vito draws her deeper into a realm of whispered alliances and bloodstained loyalties, Elena faces an impossible choice: walk away from the heir of a crime empire or step into the darkness that both protects and threatens to consume her.

Chapter 1

He didn't kiss me. He didn't even touch me—just held me down and stared.

His hands pinned my wrists to the mattress. His body hovered over mine, not moving, not shaking. Just still. Controlled. Like he wanted to remind me who held the power here.

""Say my name,"" he said.

His voice was quiet, but there was no softness in it. It was a command, as sharp as a knife edge.

I didn't answer.

He leaned closer, his breath hot against my neck. Still, he didn't touch me. Not really. That was the worst part. He didn't need to. The threat was in his stillness.

""I can protect you,"" he said. ""Or I can watch you burn.""

Vito.

That's what he called himself. No last name. No questions. He showed up during a storm, bleeding and silent. I let him inside.

I should've called the cops. I should've locked the door behind him.

But I didn't.

Instead, I gave him a towel, a cup of coffee, and a place to hide.

Then I found the gun at his side.

And the blood-stained newspaper clipping in his pocket—about a man shot three times in broad daylight outside a courthouse.

By Chapter Four, I'm in the back of a black car, headed to a private boathouse where his ""family"" lives. Where men in suits say nothing with their mouths—but everything with their eyes.

They want to know what I mean to him......

Chapter 2

After that night, Vito became a silent guardian of my late shifts at Rosie's. He would appear like a shadow as the last customers filtered out, wordlessly picking up a dish towel or straightening chairs. We rarely spoke, but his presence filled the empty café with an inexplicable warmth.

I found myself stealing glances at him while I worked – the way his strong hands carefully dried each cup, how his shoulders tensed at sudden noises from the street. Sometimes I caught him watching me too, his dark eyes intense yet unreadable. Those moments made my heart skip in a way I wasn't ready to acknowledge.

One night, as he helped me stack chairs, I noticed his knuckles were badly bruised. Purple and blue bloomed across his skin like watercolors. When he reached up to place a chair, his jacket shifted, revealing the gleam of metal at his waist – a .38 revolver. My breath caught in my throat, but I forced myself to keep working, pretending I hadn't seen.

Later, while he was in the bathroom, a crumpled newspaper clipping fell from his coat pocket. Before I could stop myself, I smoothed it out: ""Suspected Mob Hit Leaves Three Dead in Brooklyn Heights."" My hands trembled as I quickly stuffed it back, but the words had already burned themselves into my mind.

I should have been terrified. Should have told him not to come back. Instead, I found myself leaving the back door unlocked, setting out an extra coffee cup each night. He always appeared, like clockwork, just as I was closing. Sometimes bringing the scent of gunpowder and danger, other times wearing fresh bruises – but always with that same gentle care as he helped clean up.

The following week, Mr. Henderson, one of our regulars, stopped to admire a watercolor I'd painted of the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset. I'd hung it behind the counter months ago, more to cover a water stain than anything else.

""You've got talent, dear,"" he said warmly. ""The way you captured the light on the water – beautiful.""

I smiled, embarrassed by the praise. ""Oh, it's just a hobby. Nothing special.""

But the next afternoon, Vito appeared during the busy lunch rush – something he'd never done before. Without a word, he placed a thick envelope on the counter and pointed to my painting. When I started to protest, he simply shook his head, his expression brooking no argument.

I opened the envelope later: five hundred dollars, far more than the amateur painting was worth. But it was his scrawled note that made my hands shake: ""Some beauty should be preserved.""

That night, as I took down the painting, I noticed something in the corner I'd never seen before: a small ""V"" scratched into the frame. How long had he been watching me before that first bloody night? And why did the thought make me feel more intrigued than afraid?

I carefully wrapped the painting, but hesitated before handing it over. ""Will you tell me who you really are?""

Vito's fingers brushed mine as he took the package. For a moment, something raw and vulnerable flickered in his eyes. Then his walls slammed back up. ""Knowing would put you in danger, angel,"" he murmured, his Italian accent thicker than usual. ""Some shadows are better left unexplored.""

As he turned to leave, I called after him. ""I'm not afraid of shadows.""

He paused in the doorway, his silhouette stark against the neon-lit street. ""You should be,"" he said softly, and disappeared into the night.

Later, alone in my apartment, I stared at the empty wall where my painting had hung. The space seemed to echo with unspoken words and dangerous possibilities. What I didn't know then was that the real danger wasn't in the shadows Vito cast – it was in how desperately I was beginning to crave them.

Chapter 3

The rain had finally let up, leaving the streets slick and gleaming under the streetlights. My steps echoed off wet pavement as I hurried home, clutching my umbrella. The night air felt electric, charged with an unspoken tension that made the hairs on my neck stand up.

That's when I heard it – sharp cracks that could only be gunshots, followed by muffled shouts from the alley ahead. My heart lurched. Every instinct screamed to run, but my feet carried me forward instead.

I peered around the corner and froze. Two men in black masks had Vito pinned against the brick wall. Even in the dim light, I could see blood trickling down his temple. His eyes met mine for a split second – dark, urgent, warning me away.

Without thinking, I grabbed my umbrella and flung it toward him. ""Vito!""

He caught it in one fluid motion, using it to block a punch while sweeping the legs out from under one attacker. The other pulled a knife, but Vito was already moving, the umbrella's metal tip striking precisely at pressure points. Both men went down hard.

""Fire escape,"" I hissed, pointing to my building's rusty ladder. He followed without hesitation, climbing swiftly despite his injuries. I scrambled up after him, hands shaking as I fumbled with my window lock.

Inside my tiny apartment, I grabbed my first aid kit – I'd started keeping extra supplies since that first night at the café. Under the harsh bathroom light, I could see the cut on his forehead wasn't deep, but a nasty bruise was forming on his ribs.

""This is becoming a habit,"" I murmured, cleaning the wound. His skin was warm under my fingertips.

""I should go,"" he said softly, but made no move to pull away.

A car engine rumbled outside. Vito tensed, then relaxed slightly as headlights swept across my window. ""Marco,"" he said.

I peaked through the blinds. A sleek black sedan idled below, and a well-dressed young man stepped out – Vito's younger brother. I'd seen him at the café once or twice, always watching from a distance.

""Let me walk you down,"" I said, reaching for my coat. ""You shouldn't be climbing with those ribs.""

Marco was waiting by the car, his expression carefully neutral. ""Miss Elena,"" he said, inclining his head. His eyes tracked from the bandages on his brother to my face, understanding flickering in their depths. ""Please, allow me to drive you home.""

""This is my building,"" I said quickly. ""I live here.""

""Ah."" Something complicated passed between the brothers. ""Then perhaps another time. Thank you for... helping my brother.""

Later that week, I was wiping down tables when I heard Vito's voice from the back room – low, tense, speaking Italian into his phone. I caught fragments: ""...midnight... no mistakes... Rossano family honor...""

The name hit me like ice water. Rossano. The city's most powerful crime family. Suddenly, all the pieces clicked into place – the mysterious injuries, the gun, the way he moved like a predator.

I must have made some sound, because he turned, phone dropping to his side. For a long moment, we just stared at each other. Then he lowered his head, unable to meet my eyes.

""All this time,"" I whispered, ""you've been...""

The door chimed, interrupting whatever confession hung in the air. A customer walked in, oblivious to the tension crackling between us.

Vito slipped past me, his shoulder barely brushing mine. But in that brief contact, I felt his silent apology – and something else, something that made my heart race despite everything I now knew.

The truth should have sent me running. Instead, I found myself wondering what other secrets those dark eyes held, and why, despite everything, I still felt safer in his dangerous presence than anywhere else in the world.....

Chapter 4

I didn't sleep that night, my mind racing with what I'd overheard. Rossano family. The name echoed in my thoughts like a death knell. I'd read enough newspaper articles to know who they were - one of the most powerful crime families in New York. And somehow, I'd gotten tangled up with their heir.

I am now 21. The dosages were never high but I also had no clue what I was doing, so the dosing was inconsistent at times, the cycle length not strict and the pct (enclomiphene) (also tried hcg for week) was unstructered. 
I now did not take anything for around 8months (except armodafinil and coffee). Since those cycles I suffer from erectyle dysfunction. My mind/psychological arousal is still very high so this is quite a burden on me mentally. Nevertheless I am now proceeding rationally and working on reawakening my little friend. I barely feel the urge or arousal in my actual dick, I am mostly aroused mentally. Also I usually only achieve 60-70% hardness for a short time. At times orgasms feel normal, but there are also times I do not really feel anything. One thing I noticed is that in the last 2 years I still had times where I would get very horny for like a week and everything would go away as soon as I release my swimmers. Once I had such a week when I took 1 single dose of RAD-140 because I wanted to see my bodys reaction and the other 3-4 times were when I saw or talked to some hot chick und suddenly felt very activated down there. 

The whole situation is weighing huge on me mentally and it gets unbelievably lonely if you are not able to get intimate with anyone. 
I really hope there are some experts around that would be ready to give me some advice to potentially change my life.

Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve always been more of a Scully than a Mulder. I guess you could chalk that up to my upbringing—my parents were devout atheists, as were most people in my town.

For context, I’m a 37-year-old male from the US (no, I won’t say which state, so don’t ask). My wife and I separated last fall, and so for the past year I’ve been suffering from a malignant case of what I guess you could call “what’s-the-freaking-point.” Most people I’m sure would probably label it a midlife crisis, and if you want to go ahead and call it that too, be my guest. Add a recent job loss into the mix (only a data entry analyst for a local law firm, sure—but still), and you start to get the picture. It’s honestly wild how little it takes for the house of cards you call a life to collapse completely.

Anyway.

Like most people in my position, I turned to self-help books, motivational courses—even reached out to a couple of local therapists (though I never followed through; those sons of bitches are expensive). A lot of it was exactly what you’d expect: visualisation techniques, journaling, and a whole lot of “manifest your future” bullshit—but there was one thing that caught my attention. In one of the books (I won’t name it, but you’ve definitely heard of it), the author recommends writing a letter to your future self—something about “making promises” and “committing to change.” The sort of thing.

So tl;dr—I wrote one. Just scribbled it out, stuffed it in an envelope, and dropped it in the mail. No address. No stamp. Not even sure why I bothered, really.

**The following day, I got a letter back.**

I discovered it while returning from my early morning run (another of the author’s recommendations). 

Sweating and still out of breath, I turned it over in my hands, miffed, not sure if it was some kind of joke—and if so, who would even bother. I’ve got few friends, none of whom could be said to have the time or inclination for practical jokes. Hell, I would’ve chalked it up to some local dipshit playing a prank, if not for the contents.

I won’t go into details (after all, it’s personal), but let’s just say it mentioned things that no one else could possibly know—deeply private things, things I’ve never said out loud.

I guess that’s why I decided to write back. 

*—Who is this?*

I should have left it alone—that much is obvious now. But call it morbid curiosity, or just plain ol’ stupidity, I just had to know.

The reply came the very next morning. 

I had just stepped out onto the porch, coffee in hand, when I’d seen the little flag on the mailbox sticking up, and I knew that my mysterious pen-pal had replied. Truthfully, I hadn’t been expecting another letter, having by that point convinced myself that whoever wrote the first one had simply gotten lucky—which seems unbelievable to me now, looking back (although, to be fair, denial is a powerful thing).

This time, however, the letter was different. 

Before, the manner had been cordial—friendly, even. Like the correspondence from an old acquaintance. 

This letter, though… 

I’d stood there by the mailbox, suddenly feeling like I might collapse as I re-read line after line, written in what was unquestionably my own handwriting. 

And the things that it said… the awful, horrible things, things that couldn’t possibly be true, and yet that I somehow knew were just that.

I’d ripped it up right there at the end of my driveway, unsure what was going on, but suddenly furious and—yes, I’ll admit it—afraid. To have a stranger come to your home and hand-mail something of such a personal nature, to be messed with in such a fundamentally personal way… I felt violated.

I didn’t write back. 

Whatever curiosity I’d held regarding the letter was gone, and all I wanted now was to forget the whole thing and move on with my life.

Then, yesterday, I got another one.

This time it was brief. Just a single line:

*See you soon…*

Enclosed with it was a cutout from a newspaper I recognized immediately to be my local.

It’s dated a week from now. 

It’s the obituary page.

*My obituary.*

I’m holding the clipping even as I write this.

*What the hell do I do? Is this real?*

Please.

I've been personally using it for several months now with great success.

If you're into biohacking your nutrition for better energy, aesthetics, cognitive clarity, or long-term health, this ChatGPT prompt lets you build a highly customized 7-day meal plan, optimized beyond just macros.

It uses publicly available clinical logic like:
- US IOM nutrient targets  
- Protein quality (DIAAS) and amino acid thresholds to support mTOR  
- Micronutrient timing and pairing (e.g., vitamin C with non-heme iron, fat with A/D/E/K)  
- Absorption optimization and avoidance of nutrient conflicts (e.g., iron/zinc/copper timing)  
- Omega ratios, choline, iodine, selenium, fiber, and glycemic load balancing  
- Amino acid balancing for plant-based diets useful if you're vegetarian/vegan  
- Fully adaptable to medical concerns like prediabetes or PCOS (**but still not a prescription**)

It asks for your goals (cut, bulk, recomp), activity level, dietary preferences, food likes/dislikes, cooking time, budget, and even pre/post-workout needs, then builds daily meal breakdowns with per-meal and daily macro/micronutrient summaries.

Think of it as a *biohacking-friendly nutrition template generator*, smart, flexible, and fully transparent. 

**It doesn’t replace a human dietitian, but it gives you a surprisingly detailed launchpad.**

- Combine incomplete proteins across meals to meet essential amino acid needs  
- Prioritize lysine-methionine balance in plant-based diets  
- Aim for per-meal lysine ≥ 2.5 g and leucine ≥ 2.5 g to support mTOR activation and muscle protein synthesis

---

### 🧩 Additional Nutrient Optimization Rules (Do not change unless necessary)

- Pair non-heme iron sources (e.g., lentils, spinach) with vitamin C (e.g., lemon, bell pepper); avoid tea/coffee with iron-rich meals

1l6xups,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Acceptable_Cattle_57/comments/1l6xups/am_i_just_debugging_myself_existential_thoughts/,Am I just debugging myself? existential thoughts,"Hello, Universe! 👋

Right now, I’m a psychology hobby student with a passion for coding, sitting alone in a cabin (t—it’s a vibe, trust me). Surrounded by nature, a thermos of questionably strong coffee, and a laptop that’s seen more of my existential crises than any therapist, I’m left wondering: Is my life just a badly written theater play with ace ventura-dude —maybe a comedy of errors, or a tragicomedy with extra syntax errors?

I mean, think about it. Every day I try to refactor my thoughts, debug my non-existing anxieties, and optimize my sleep schedule. (Spoiler: the function keeps returning ‘null’.) Are these just the random processes of a healthy mind—or is my mental health as unpredictable as my Python scripts when I forget to indent?

**Life as Code -- Thought Experiment**  
If my life is a script, who’s the programmer? Is it me, or am I just following someone else’s (poorly commented) code? Sometimes I suspect the universe just copypasted me from a Stack Overflow answer about “How to survive in your 20s.” There are definitely a few unhandled exceptions in my source code.

**Universe paradox**  
Speaking of existential design flaws: Can we get a picture of the ones that invented and talk about those plastic bottle caps that are now *attached* to the bottle? It’s supposed to save the environment (cheers to that!), but every time I try to take a sip, I spill half the bottle on my shirt. Now I have to run my laundry on the ECO cycle just to keep the planet happy and my wife off my back. Is this the butterfly effect in action? One tiny cap, and suddenly I’m standing shirtless in a forest, wondering if my next wash will cleanse my soul—or just my clothes.

1l6xuna,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1l6xuna/wife_has_strange_perceptions/,"Wife has strange ""perceptions"".","I'm not sure how else to word it, but she sees what I'm doing in the moment as ALL I've been doing. Let me give you an example:

I wake up at 6am every day. Before the school rush I do the dishes, iron the uniform, take the garbage out, generally tidy up, get the coffee on for me and the wife, and generally tidy up whatever lingering mess there is from the 6 year old. 

Now let's say, just before the kids get up, I sit down and take a look at the weather forecast, or message one of the other parents about something happening on that day or whatever, my wife will get up, give me the silent treatment, be forceful with objects etc etc and make comments like ""is that all you can do? Just sit on your fucking phone while I do everything?"" ""If you keep just sitting about I swear to god"" ""how about you get up"". 

If I point out what I have done, she will say ""only a sad person would turn this into a competition"" and if I say nothing she accuses me of giving HER the silent treatment. 

She's always been like this, and most times I can just brush it off, but it can get to me sometimes. It makes me anxious to do anything, but when I bring it up with her she tells me I'm either making it up, or that I'm pathetic. 

She has OCD issues and whatnot, and I'm not sure if she's just projecting, or if she does that DARVO thing, or if it's me that's actually in the wrong. 

Any advice?

And I know for a fact there was never a single romantic element between them, which made their mind fuck even more disturbing and confusing because there wasn’t even the element of trying to get me out of the picture so they could have each other. 

My life was entirely in their hands. Their abuse partnered together stacked into why I got sent to a mental hospital, and then they were the two there to “rescue me” when I got out.
And then they took me home, raided it without my consent, stole and locked up every single thing they deemed a “threat” away from me, and I had to meet up with my friend every 3 days for coffee to get my life-reliant meds. 

The day I came home from the mental hospital, the most traumatic experience of my life, my boyfriend’s first 1:1 talk with me was about how hard I was to deal with and how hard it was on him personally to deal with me. 

My entire life was in their hands. If one of them was manipulating me or saying they knew better than me or my feelings and I started getting overwhelmed and confused, they would call each other on speaker to tell me how “in cycle” I was. To condition me to listen to them as they knew better than me. 

I was an adult woman with my life in their hands. They had convinced me an insane person and deserved it.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of curved patio furniture lies not only in its aesthetic design but also in its functional features. From modular configurations to weather-resistant materials, these pieces are designed to enhance your outdoor experience.

**Modular Design and Configuration:**

Many curved patio furniture sets feature a modular design, allowing you to arrange the pieces in various configurations to suit your space and needs. This flexibility is particularly valuable for those with smaller patios or balconies, as it allows you to maximize the available space. The modular components often include curved sofas, armless chairs, ottomans, and coffee tables, which can be combined to create a custom seating arrangement. This adaptability ensures that your patio furniture can evolve with your changing lifestyle and preferences.

**Weather-Resistant Materials:**

Outdoor furniture is constantly exposed to the elements, making weather resistance a crucial factor. High-quality curved patio furniture is typically constructed from materials such as aluminum, wicker, teak, and durable outdoor fabrics. Aluminum frames are lightweight, rust-resistant, and easy to maintain. Wicker, often made from synthetic resin, provides a classic look while being resistant to fading, cracking, and moisture damage. Teak is a naturally weather-resistant hardwood that develops a beautiful patina over time. Outdoor fabrics, such as Sunbrella, are designed to withstand UV rays, water, and mildew, ensuring that your cushions and upholstery remain vibrant and comfortable for years to come.

**Ergonomic Comfort and Support:**

Comfort is paramount when it comes to patio furniture, and curved designs excel in providing ergonomic support. The gentle curves of the seating conform to the body, promoting relaxation and reducing pressure points. Deep seating cushions, often filled with high-density foam, further enhance comfort. Many sets also include lumbar pillows for added support. The thoughtful design ensures that you and your guests can enjoy hours of comfortable lounging without experiencing discomfort or fatigue.

**UV Protection and Fade Resistance:**

Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause fading and degradation of outdoor furniture. To combat this, high-quality curved patio furniture is treated with UV inhibitors that protect the materials from the damaging effects of the sun. This is particularly important for fabrics and wicker, which are more susceptible to fading. Look for furniture that is specifically labeled as UV-resistant to ensure that it will maintain its color and appearance over time. This feature is essential for preserving the longevity and aesthetic appeal of your outdoor investment.

**Easy Maintenance and Cleaning:**

Outdoor furniture should be easy to clean and maintain. Most curved patio furniture can be cleaned with mild soap and water. Removable cushion covers can be machine washed, making it easy to remove spills and stains. Regularly wiping down the frames with a damp cloth will help to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime. Some materials, such as teak, may require occasional oiling to maintain their natural luster. By following a few simple maintenance tips, you can keep your curved patio furniture looking its best for years to come.

 ## Core Benefits

Curved patio furniture offers several distinct advantages that enhance the outdoor living experience. These benefits extend beyond aesthetics, impacting comfort, functionality, and social interaction.

**Enhanced Social Interaction:** The curved design of these furniture sets naturally fosters conversation and interaction. By positioning seating in a semi-circle or crescent shape, guests are encouraged to face each other, creating a more intimate and engaging atmosphere. This is particularly beneficial for outdoor entertaining, as it allows for easier communication and a more inclusive social experience. The curved arrangement promotes a sense of connection and encourages guests to relax and enjoy each other's company.

**Space Optimization:** Curved patio furniture can be particularly effective in optimizing the use of outdoor space, especially in smaller areas. The rounded shapes can fit more comfortably into corners and odd-shaped patios, maximizing seating without overwhelming the space. This is in contrast to traditional rectangular furniture, which can sometimes feel bulky and restrictive. By utilizing curved designs, you can create a more open and inviting outdoor area, even in limited spaces.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Style:** The unique and elegant design of curved patio furniture adds a touch of sophistication to any outdoor setting. The flowing lines and organic shapes create a visually appealing focal point, enhancing the overall aesthetic of your patio or garden. Available in a wide range of styles, from modern and minimalist to traditional and rustic, curved furniture can complement any design aesthetic. This versatility allows you to create a personalized outdoor space that reflects your individual taste and style.

**Increased Comfort and Relaxation:** The ergonomic design of curved seating promotes relaxation and comfort. The gentle curves conform to the body, providing support and reducing pressure points. Deep seating cushions and lumbar pillows further enhance comfort, allowing you to lounge for hours without experiencing discomfort. This is particularly beneficial for those who enjoy spending time outdoors reading, socializing, or simply relaxing. The combination of ergonomic design and plush cushioning creates a truly comfortable and inviting outdoor experience.

1l6xqy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToysAndTots/comments/1l6xqy0/babies_remember_way_more_than_you_think/,Babies Remember WAY More Than You Think,"Alright, let’s get one thing out of the way: if you think your baby is just a drooling, gurgling potato with zero memory or cognitive ability, you’re wrong. Not kind of wrong. Not “bless your heart” wrong. I mean dead wrong. Babies, yes, even those barely-holding-up-their-own-head newborns are wired for memory and imitation like little spongy geniuses. The idea that they forget everything the second you leave the room? Trash. Let’s take a scalpel to that myth and dissect what’s *really* going on inside your toddler's surprisingly strategic little brain.

# Babies Aren’t Goldfish. They're Actually Mini Archivists.

Once upon a time (read: the '90s), scientists assumed babies were just floating through life in a soup of blurry lights and sounds, like stoned jellyfish. Enter Klein and Meltzoff (1999), who basically slapped that idea across the face.

Here’s what they found:

* A 12-month-old saw a toy trick ONCE for 20 seconds.
* Three minutes later? 70% still remembered it.
* A week later? 50% still did it.
* FOUR. WEEKS. LATER? They were *still* pulling the same moves.

Let me say that again: your toddler can remember stuff they saw **a month ago**, even if it looked like they were just chewing on their foot the whole time. Meanwhile, I can’t even remember what I had for lunch yesterday. 

# But How Do We Even Know What Babies Remember?

Yeah, I get it. babies can’t file a memory report or recite Hamlet. So how do researchers test them? **Deferred imitation**, baby.

Here’s how it works:

1. Researcher shows baby a weird action (e.g., stirring a stick in a box).
2. Waits. No reinforcement. No repetition.
3. Later, hands baby the same setup.
4. Baby does it.

Boom. Memory confirmed. No verbal skills required just good ol’ monkey-see-monkey-do.

And if you think this is some niche lab trick, please. Watch a toddler pick up your phone and somehow open Instagram. That’s *deferred imitation* in action, and yes, it's both impressive and terrifying.

# Their Brains Are Literally Built to Copy You (So... Sorry in Advance)

Babies aren’t just watching you; they’re downloading you. Neuro-research even shows that when babies *watch* someone use a hand or foot to touch something, the same area in their own brains lights up. They’re pre-installed with **mirror neurons,** the hardware for copy-paste learning.

So when your toddler starts mimicking your passive-aggressive sighs or the way you slam drawers when annoyed, congratulations: you're now both a role model *and* the star of a very tiny reality show.

# Imitation = Learning Shortcut (AKA Why Your Kid is Smarter Than You Think)

Babies don’t need a syllabus or a TED Talk to learn. They just need to see something once and bam, it’s in the database. Here's how imitation fuels their glow-up:

|**What They Copy**|**What It Builds**|
|:-|:-|
|Waving, smiling, gestures|Social skills + Bonding|
|Babbling, cooing, sounds|Early language development|
|Holding toy phones, spoons|Motor coordination + pretend play|
|Pretending a block is a cup|Cognitive flexibility + imagination|

If you’ve ever seen a baby “drink” from an empty plastic donut or try to brush your hair with a remote, congratulations: that’s symbolic play aka the early roots of problem-solving and creative thinking. Sure, it's adorable. It's also cognitive *flexing*.

# 🧍‍♂️ Monkey See, Monkey Copy Everything (Including Your Bad Habits)

Here’s the kicker, and where things get a bit dicey. Babies don’t just copy the good stuff. They copy **everything**.

* See you slam a door? They’ll do it too.
* Watch you yell at Alexa? Welcome to toddler tantrums at inanimate objects.
* Observe you using a knife without care? Yeah, they’ll find *that* interesting real fast.

So if you’re modeling chaos, don’t be surprised when your toddler starts channeling their inner gremlin. Babies don’t have moral filters. They don’t know safe from stupid. They know **repeat what looks important**.

# TV Isn’t Neutral (Even If It Buys You 30 Minutes of Peace)

Here’s an uncomfortable truth: even babies as young as **14 months** can and do imitate what they see on screens. And given that the average American toddler watches *two hours* of TV per day, that’s a whole lot of unfiltered learning happening.

You might think:

>“It’s just cartoons, what harm could it do?”

Well, if your kid learns how to do a spin-kick from a ninja turtle, don’t act shocked when your cat gets roundhoused.

Pro tip: **TV is a tool, not a babysitter.** Use it wisely. And yes, Bluey counts as educational. Paw Patrol? Debatable.

# How to Actually Support Your Baby’s Memory & Learning (Without Going Insane)

Let’s ditch the guilt trips and talk real-world parenting hacks that *actually* help:

* **Model what you want to see.** If you don’t want your kid yelling, don’t yell. If you want them to wash their hands, make it a performance.
* **Face-to-face play > background noise.** Babies learn from expressions and interaction, not while you’re doomscrolling Twitter beside them.
* **Talk back (even to nonsense).** Your baby babbles? Echo it back. That weird ""agoo"" is their first podcast episode.
* **Encourage pretend play.** A block can be a phone, a cup, or a spaceship. Let them be weird. Weird is good. Weird is smart.
* **Limit screen time without being a psycho.** Use screens strategically, not desperately. Curate the content. Think “Mr. Rogers,” not “YouTube algorithm roulette.”
* **Celebrate their wins.** When they imitate you stacking cups or waving bye-bye, go full Oscars red carpet. “OMG you did it!” works wonders.

# Safety First, Seriously

Reminder: Babies can’t tell the difference between “Daddy shaving” and “Maybe I should stick this plastic knife in my eye.” **Imitation is indiscriminate.** Lock up your tools. Hide the bleach. Stop letting them see you balance on a chair to change a bulb like a daredevil.

# Final Rant: Stop Underestimating Babies

The science is clear, the anecdotes are endless, and if you’ve been paying attention at all, the message is simple:

**Babies are copy machines with brilliant memory cards installed.**  
They will absorb and imitate what they see so you better curate their reality like you’re running the Truman Show.

You don’t need flashcards or Mozart CDs. You need:

* Human interaction
* Positive modeling
* Safe exploration
* Occasional breaks where no one loses their mind

Babies aren’t empty vessels. They’re observant, pattern-seeking, highly motivated learners. Respect that. Harness it. And for the love of your future sanity, don’t let your toddler learn emotional regulation from Peppa Pig.

**TL;DR**  
Your baby is smarter than you think. Their memory is sharp. Their imitation game is strong. And yes, they’re watching everything you do. Choose your actions accordingly.

We got: waffle, hashbrowns, coffee, texas melt with egg & cheese, and chicken sausage. The food was pretty good, I loved the buttery goodness of the texas melt, and the price is pretty hard to beat these days....it cost just a little over $16 for everything.

on a throwaway in case fsr she has reddit lol

i am an attractive guy (22M) and i have dated many many people. i am very confident in myself and who i am, and i am never nervous for a date or to talk to women. i have many options for people to go out with & so not many people peak my interest.

i’ve known this girl since high school, but we didn’t talk much then. i’ve always thought she was attractive, but i never made a move on her because i genuinely just thought she was too pretty for me. so if i talked to her it was just friendly, never even went for it.

but recently i decided to make a move with a big leap of impulse and i had no idea it would work. but she actually said she’d go get coffee with me this week, and we’ve been talking regularly for a couple of weeks now!

i’ve become even more attracted to her as we’ve talked. we’re in the same place in life, she’s healthy & confident & knows who she is and what she wants to do with her life. we have a lot in common and similar interests and similar energy. she is my ideal woman and it’s making me get more and more excited yet more and more anxious for our date.

like i said, i know im a very attractive guy and i go on dates all the time. im very confident in my dating & relationship skills & i am NEVER nervous about a date or dating someone. but this girl just keeps getting better & i am feeling nervous for a date for the first time in 5 or 6 years. 

how do i get rid of the nerves? it’s a mix of excited and nervous, but i don’t wanna be awkward or spend our whole date overanalyzing things. she is really awesome and i don’t wanna fuck this up. it’s very confusing for me to feel this way when i never do so some advice would help!!! thank you!!!!",1,1749450035.0,datingadviceformen,1,1.0,False
