I decided to try out a dating app in August, jumped on Stir because it's for single parents and assumed I'd find women who were more understanding of my current situation.

Matched with a bunch of women, started talking a to to one in particular. We even met up a few times for little coffee dates etc. she's a single mom whose been divorced for 6 years. We've kissed, even made out in her car once after a little drive after a lunch date.

So I've been extremely honest about my situation since day 1. She has been amazingly cool and understanding, I believed it because she has been in my situation. Well today out of left field she absolutely tore me to peices about not prioritizing time for her enough. Even hit me with ""I'm not your emotional support pet by the way"". Now mind you this is a person who a month ago said ""you can talk to me about things going on with your ex, I'm sure you still going through things with it and I won't get jealous""

Long story long, I had allowed myself to get emotionally invested in this woman. Actually allowed myself to get vulnerable, and in one afternoon she absolutely kicked me 10 steps backwards in my self healing journey.

1gm9sr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1gm9sr7/a_summer_day_in_yangyang/,A Summer Day in YangYang,"Hey everyone! This past summer, I took a day trip to Ganwondo's Yangyang and had such a fantastic time exploring the beaches, cozy cafes, and local eats. From relaxing at Surfyy Beach to grabbing coffee with an ocean view, Yangyang has so much to offer for a quick getaway. Here‚Äôs a little recap of my experience and some tips for making the most of your trip‚Äîhope it inspires your next adventure! üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüåäüåû

**What is Yangyang?** 

Yangyang is a charming coastal town located in Gangwon Province, South Korea, known for its stunning beaches and beautiful natural landscapes. Historically, it's been a popular spot for fishing and agriculture, and today, it attracts visitors for its vibrant surf culture and outdoor activities. Whether you‚Äôre riding the waves at Surfyy Beach, grabbing fresh seafood, or just soaking up the sun with a coffee in hand, Yangyang is the perfect spot to relax and explore.

**How to get to YangYang?** 

Yangyang is easily accessible from Seoul by bus or car. You can take an express bus from Seoul‚Äôs Express Bus Terminal to Yangyang Bus Terminal, which takes about 2.5 hours. There are also intercity buses from nearby areas like Sokcho and Gangneung, making it a convenient destination.

https://preview.redd.it/y9k7perjqlzd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5d6e3318be63fc24d5a456687ebfbb00ec746a5

Yangyang currently does not have a KTX (Korea Train Express) station, so you can‚Äôt travel directly by KTX to Yangyang. However, you can still take the KTX partway and then transfer to a bus or taxi to reach Yangyang.

**Moving around in YangYang** 

In Yangyang, taxis and car rentals are the most convenient ways to get around. Kakao Taxi is especially recommended, as it allows you to easily book a ride through the app and is widely available in the area. For more flexibility, renting a car is a good option, especially if you plan to visit remote spots. We moved around with two taxis (since the numbers of passengers exceed the limit).

**Our routes in YangYang**

Here's a our route for a day in Yangyang! We started from Yangyang Terminal and headed to the Yangyang Traditional Market for some local vibes. Next, we enjoyed lunch at a famous local restaurant before visiting Naksan Temple, where we spent some time healing with stunning ocean views. Afterward, we went to a nearby cafe to chit-chat. In the evening, we strolled around Surfyy Beach. You can grab a beverage at a beach pub if you want too! We finally wrapped up our day with dinner at a restaurant near Surfyy Beach before returning to Yangyang Terminal.

**YangYang bus terminal** 

The very first place we got to see is Yangyang Bus Terminal. It is a central hub for travelers, connecting Yangyang with major cities like Seoul and Gangneung. Here, they have frequent bus services to explore the region. The terminal features waiting areas, ticket counters, and information services to assist passengers. With its accessible location, it's an essential starting point for visiting local attractions, beaches, and markets in Yangyang. For more details, you can visit their official site.

**YangYang tradition market**

We then moved to Yangyang Traditional Market for lunch. It is a vibrant spot where locals and visitors can experience the flavors and crafts of Yangyang. The market is known for fresh produce, seafood, and unique snacks, including local specialties like mushroom-based products. It‚Äôs a great place to try traditional Korean street food and buy handmade souvenirs, offering a warm, local atmosphere and a glimpse into Yangyang‚Äôs rich culture and community.

**Our Lunch in YangYang**

We went to a famous local restaurant near YangYang market for lunch and were impressed by the variety of local dishes made from fresh ingredients. And surprisingly, there are plenty of foreigner-friendly and vegetarian options too! Here are some dishes we tried.

https://preview.redd.it/l8lmsjrjqlzd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36758465997376e646e1ed9891dcce9048d1711d

* Í∞êÏûêÏòπÏã¨Ïù¥ (Potato Dumpling Soup): This is noodle soup like ÏπºÍµ≠Ïàò (Kal-guksu) but with soft potato dumplings made with 100% real potatoes from Yangyang. 
* Í∞êÏûêÏ†Ñ (Potato Pancake): Crispy on the outside, soft inside, with a natural sweetness of potatoes. Great as a side dish! 
* Ï†ÑÎ≥ë (Jeonbyeon) with Í≥§ÎìúÎ†à and Kimchi: A flavorful pancake roll filled with wild greens and kimchi, a delicious way to try local veggies. 

**Naksan Temple** 

Our next stop was Naksan Temple, which took a little longer than the other spots by taxi. Despite the hot summer, the little hike to the top was worth it for the amazing views and peaceful atmosphere. We treated ourselves to ice cream at the summit‚Äîperfect for cooling off and enjoying the scenery. Before leaving, we explored the souvenir shop, which had lots of unique items, including local snacks and temple keepsakes

**Cafes in YangYang**

After the temple, we visited a nearby cafe called **Essencia Cafe**‚Äîa cozy spot with a relaxing vibe. On a previous trip, I also tried **Salty Cabin Yangyang**, another great cafe worth visiting if you‚Äôre in the In-gu area. Both places offer a nice break with unique atmospheres, so I‚Äôd recommend checking them 

https://preview.redd.it/tkc206pjqlzd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=468740f1906b15a7b11b321596cf01244b04255e

**Surfy Beach**

Then we went to the most famous place in YangYang as well as highlight of our trip ""Surffy Beach"". The place is so insta-worthy to take cool photos and also there‚Äôs plenty to enjoy there. From fun Instax pop-ups to an open gym right on the sand, it‚Äôs a perfect spot to relax and explore. During my previous trip, I had a chilling evening with a cold beer from the beach pub, which was an amazing way to wind down by the ocean, especially on a hot summer day.

**Dinner at YangYang**

For dinner, we walked over to The Stand, which is just five minutes walk from Surfyy Beach. It‚Äôs a huge, lively spot serving everything from coffee and cocktails to Western dishes. This is a perfect find if you‚Äôre missing familiar flavors. Plus, they throw pool parties every so often, adding to the fun beach vibe. Definitely worth checking out!

**Accomodation** 

Though we didn't stay overnight, Yangyang has a variety of accommodations, from cozy guesthouses to modern hotels near the beach. For budget-friendly options, you can find guesthouses and pensions around Surfyy Beach and Ingu Beach, which are perfect for those looking to stay close to the ocean and outdoor activities.

**Hiddem gem in YangYang**

During my last trip, I stumbled upon Waveworks at Jukdo Beach‚Äîan amazing spot that‚Äôs part cafe, part workspace, with ocean views. You can use it as a meeting room, workspace, or even for workshops, and there‚Äôs a cozy bookstore inside too. They often host fun community events like yoga classes, handcrafts workshops and culture talks. This is my strong recommended place but be sure to go there before evening as they close the place at 6pm!

https://preview.redd.it/f4i7p84frlzd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c1b7a9f9610366295cf0d399710a7c8cea214a6b

**Tips and Tricks** 

To wrap up, a top tip for traveling in Yangyang is to download the GoGo Yangyang app. It‚Äôs super helpful for finding restaurant recommendations, real-time traffic updates, and even the locations of nearby restrooms, all especially convenient for foreigners navigating the area. We found it made the trip much smoother and easier to explore all the local spots.

1gm9ser,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1gm9ser/worried_about_my_wifes_weed_use/,Worried about my wife‚Äôs weed use,"Hey all. I (40M) and my wife (38F) have been together for 14 years (married for 9 of them). We have two children 7 and 8 years old. About 2 years ago she had a partial hysterectomy and was given some pretty heavy pain killers after. She didn‚Äôt want to stay on them very long since addiction runs in her family and they were giving her an upset stomach. So she switched to smoking weed and taking regular over the counter Advil. She has some pretty intense trauma in her past. She had been on a fairly high dosage of Sertraline (SSRI) for the past 12 years or so to manage depression, rage and anxiety issues. After her surgery when she was smoking a lot, she decided to quit the sertraline cold turkey. A combination of that and the large amounts of weed she was smoking caused her to have a manic episode where she thought I had poisoned the air in our house and drones from China were spying on her, it got really bad one night and she ended up in inpatient care for like a week. Afterwards she was crazy depressed for months, it was hard for her to get out of bed and she wanted to die most days. She was working with a therapist and they were trying to get her balanced out for around a year (they originally gave her a soft bipolar 1 diagnosis, but never officially since she hasn‚Äôt had any other manic episodes) She‚Äôs now back on sertraline and is doing much better. Over the past few months she has started smoking weed again and it‚Äôs now to the point where she is smoking all day every day (smokes in the AM with her coffee and then periodically throughout the day, not a ton, but usually noticeably high). Her therapist that she had been meeting with weekly recently quit or was fired from the clinic she worked at and so my wife hasn‚Äôt seen anyone for a few weeks now. I‚Äôve expressed to her all the reasons I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs particularly wise for her to be smoking so much: impact on her mental health. I don‚Äôt feel like I can count on her to help with things like picking up the kids from school, so it all falls on me. She isn‚Äôt open about it and sneaks around to smoke, which feels icky to me. She doesn‚Äôt feel present, I don‚Äôt feel connected to her. I‚Äôm not particularly attracted to her when she‚Äôs high, so our sex life has basically ended. She manages several rental properties that we own, and sometimes has to make fairly important and impactful decisions about them, and it‚Äôs hard for me to trust her with that when she‚Äôs high. She tends to isolate herself and spends a lot of time in her office avoiding me and our kids when she‚Äôs high. Along with several other lesser reasons for why I wish she would cut back. When I talk to her about it, she tells me that she totally understands how I‚Äôm feeling, and then nothing changes. This isn‚Äôt sustainable to me and I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I can stay in this relationship if something doesn‚Äôt change. We have a couples counselor we see occasionally, we spent our entire last session talking about this and the therapist kind of just said ‚Äúsome people smoke a lot and it isn‚Äôt a problem, you guys have to decide how much is ok‚Äù. I feel very lost and alone. I‚Äôd love any guidance, resources or advice anyone can give me.

TL;DR my wife has started smoking weed all day everyday and I worry she is addicted. It‚Äôs having a negative impact on our family and our relationship. How do I proceed?",4,1731038272.0,relationships,0,0.83,False

Last Thursday | (34M) I asked a (34F) on an early-afternoon coffee date. She agreed with ""Okay, sure."" And on that Sunday morning I sent a ""Looking forward to coffee‚Äù confirmation text in which she replied ""Me too."" At the cafe, I will say, I could tell she was nervous meeting me because her hands were trembling when holding the menu. Of course I didn't call attention to it. We ended up really hitting it off, lots of laughing, flowing conversation, etc. Gave her a hug, went on our merry ways. It was a one hour date. I‚Äôm obviously not kissing here, it‚Äôs a quick feeler.

The next afternoon, I sent her a DM on IG (where all contact has been made thus far) stating it was a good time and we should do it again. It was short, sweet and to the point. No extra fluff. She agreed with a ""yes"" and a smiley emoji and gave me her availability for the following week. For whatever reason, she sent me her availability one hour after the ""yes"" and before I could even respond to it.

Again, I send a confirmation text on our second date which would took place the following Tuesday, four days after our initial date. She replies with a simple ""Yeah."" We did Italian and drinks - and again, amazing conversation, playful banter, flirty vibes. We went on a walk after. And after about 3 hours, we called it a night and exchanged phone numbers and I told her to text to me when she got home so I know she got there safe. No I didn't kiss her but in retrospect I think I probably could have. Whatever, played it safe. I am confident enough to do it next time. She did text me when she got home as l asked her to and she just said ""Home."" I responded ""Great to hear you're back home. I just got in."" about 10 minutes after her and she responds ‚ÄúGood."" I didn't respond to that and still haven‚Äôt.

Just to give more context. I have initiated both dates and confirmed both. Technically the home text was a sort of ""directive"" of mine so it wasn't really an initiation on her end. Am I missing something or over analyzing? She seems to really like me in person but only responds in one to two word texts (mostly no emojis) and doesn't initiate any conversations? I obviously know it's early but I am getting mixed signals.

I do not want to keep initiating and looking more interested than she is. I think she‚Äôs got a put in some work for a third date, no? I have not even received a ‚Äúthank you for the date‚Äù once. Is that a red flag? It's been 48 hours since she last sent that ""good"". Any input or advice? I still haven‚Äôt asked her on a third date and have had no contact with her since Tuesday.",2,1731038199.0,CoreyWayne,0,1.0,False

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!
Black and yellow!
Hello!
You ready for this, hot shot?
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.
Wind, check.
Antennae, check.
Nectar pack, check.
Wings, check.
Stinger, check.
Scared out of my shorts, check.
OK, ladies,
let's move it out!
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!
All of you, drain those flowers!
Wow! I'm out!
I can't believe I'm out!
So blue.
I feel so fast and free!
Box kite!
Wow!
Flowers!
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.
Roses!
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.
Stand to the side, kid.
It's got a bit of a kick.
That is one nectar collector!
Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?
Copy that visual.
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?
Affirmative.
That was on the line!
This is the coolest. What is it?
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.
It smells good.
Not like a flower, but I like it.
Yeah, fuzzy.
Chemical-y.
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.
My sweet lord of bees!
Candy-brain, get off there!
Problem!
Guys!
This could be bad.
Affirmative.
Very close.
Gonna hurt.
Mama's little boy.
You are way out of position, rookie!
Coming in at you like a missile!
Help me!
I don't think these are flowers.
Should we tell him?
I think he knows.
What is this?!
Match point!
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!
Yowser!
Gross.
There's a bee in the car!
Do something!
I'm driving!
Hi, bee.
He's back here!
He's going to sting me!
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!
He blinked!
Spray him, Granny!
What are you doing?!
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.
I gotta get home.
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!
Ken, could you close the window please?
Ken, could you close the window please?
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.
What was that?
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!
That is diabolical.
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.
What's number one? Star Wars?
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.
Wait! Stop! Bee!
Stand back. These are winter boots.
Wait!
Don't kill him!
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!
Why does his life have less value than yours?
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.
My brochure!
There you go, little guy.
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.
 Put that on your resume brochure.
My whole face could puff up.
Make it one of your special skills.
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.
You could put carob chips on there.
Bye.
Supposed to be less calories.
Bye.
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.
All right, here it goes.
Nah.
What would I say?
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.
How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!
Hi!
I'm sorry. You're talking.
Yes, I know.
You're talking!
I'm so sorry.
No, it's OK. It's fine.
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.
Yeah.
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!
I just want to say I'm grateful.
I'll leave now.
Wait! How did you learn to do that?
What?
The talking thing.
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.
That's very funny.
Yeah.
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.
Anyway... Can I... get you something?
Like what?
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?
I don't want to put you out.
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.
It's just coffee.
I hate to impose.
Don't be ridiculous!
Actually, I would love a cup.
Hey, you want rum cake?
I shouldn't.
Have some.
No, I can't.
Come on!
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.
Where?
These stripes don't help.
You look great!
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.
Are you all right?
No.
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.
He finally gets there.
He runs up the steps into the church.
The wedding is on.
And he says, ""Watermelon?
I thought you said Guatemalan.
Why would I marry a watermelon?""
Is that a bee joke?
That's the kind of stuff we do.
Yeah, different.
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?
About work? I don't know.
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.
I know how you feel.
You do?
Sure.
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.
Really?
My only interest is flowers.
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?
You're in Sheep Meadow!
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.
Why do girls put rings on their toes?
Why not?
It's like putting a hat on your knee.
Maybe I'll try that.
You all right, ma'am?
Oh, yeah. Fine.
Just having two cups of coffee!
Anyway, this has been great.
Thanks for the coffee.
Yeah, it's no trouble.
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.
Are you...?
Can I take a piece of this with me?
Sure! Here, have a crumb.
Thanks!
Yeah.
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.
OK, Barry.
And thank you so much again... for before.
Oh, that? That was nothing.
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...
This can't possibly work.
He's all set to go.
We may as well try it.
OK, Dave, pull the chute.
Sounds amazing.
It was amazing!
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!
Giant, scary humans!
What were they like?
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.
They eat crazy giant things.
They drive crazy.
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?
Some of them. But some of them don't.
How'd you get back?
Poodle.
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.
Well...
Well?
Well, I met someone.
You did? Was she Bee-ish?
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!
No, no, no, not a wasp.
Spider?
I'm not attracted to spiders.
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.
So who is she?
She's... human.
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.
Her name's Vanessa.
Oh, boy.
She's so nice. And she's a florist!
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!
We're not dating.
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!
She saved my life! And she understands me.
This is over!
Eat this.
This is not over! What was that?
They call it a crumb.
It was so stingin' stripey!
And that's not what they eat.
That's what falls off what they eat!
You know what a Cinnabon is?
No.
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...
Sit down!
...really hot!
Listen to me!
We are not them! We're us.
There's us and there's them!
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!
Thinking bee.
Thinking bee.
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!
There he is. He's in the pool.
You know what your problem is, Barry?
I gotta start thinking bee?
How much longer will this go on?
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.
What life? You have no life!
You have no job. You're barely a bee!
Would it kill you to make a little honey?
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.
Martin, would you talk to him?
Barry, I'm talking to you!
You coming?
Got everything?
All set!
Go ahead. I'll catch up.
Don't be too long.
Watch this!
Vanessa!
We're still here.
I told you not to yell at him.
He doesn't respond to yelling!
Then why yell at me?
Because you don't listen!
I'm not listening to this.
Sorry, I've gotta go.
Where are you going?
I'm meeting a friend.
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?
Bye.
I just hope she's Bee-ish.
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?
No. All right, I've got one.
How come you don't fly everywhere?
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.
All right, your turn.
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!
You don't have that?
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.
Oh, my.
Dumb bees!
You must want to sting all those jerks.
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.
So you have to watch your temper.
Very carefully.
You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?
Yeah.
What is wrong with you?!
It's a bug.
He's not bothering anybody.
Get out of here, you creep!
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?
Yeah, it was. How did you know?
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.
You've really got that down to a science.
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.
I'll bet.
What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?
How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?
Is he that actor?
I never heard of him.
Why is this here?
For people. We eat it.
You don't have enough food of your own?
Well, yes.
How do you get it?
Bees make it.
I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!
It's organic.
It's our-ganic!
It's just honey, Barry.
Just what?!
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!
You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!
And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!
Hey, Hector. You almost done?
Almost.
He is here. I sense it.
Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.
You're busted, box boy!
I knew I heard something.
So you can talk!
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!
Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?
I don't understand.
I thought we were friends.
The last thing we want to do is upset bees!
You're too late! It's ours now!
You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!
You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!
Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!
Crazy person!
What horrible thing has happened here?
These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now
they're on the road to nowhere!
Just keep still.
What? You're not dead?
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?
To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!
I'm going to Tacoma.
And you?
He really is dead.
All right.
Uh-oh!
What is that?!
Oh, no!
A wiper! Triple blade!
Triple blade?
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!
Why does everything have
to be so doggone clean?!
How much do you people need to see?!
Open your eyes!
Stick your head out the window!
From NPR News in Washington,
I'm Carl Kasell.
But don't kill no more bugs!
Bee!
Moose blood guy!!
You hear something?
Like what?
Like tiny screaming.
Turn off the radio.
Whassup, bee boy?
Hey, Blood.
Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.
Wow!
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.
Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.
It's a close community.
Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.
What if you get in trouble?
You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!
At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.
Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.
You got to be kidding me!
Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!
Hey, guys!
Mooseblood!
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.
Did you bring your crazy straw?
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.
What is this place?
A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.
They are pinheads!
Pinhead.
Check out the new smoker.
Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!
Smoker?
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.
They make the honey, and we make the money.
""They make the honey, and we make the money""?
Oh, my!
What's going on? Are you OK?
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.
Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?
Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.
This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!
What is this?
Oh, no!
There's hundreds of them!
Bee honey.
Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!
This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.
Oh, Barry, stop.
Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.
Do these look like rumors?
That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?
He's been talking to humans.
What? Talking to humans?!
He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!
Make out? Barry!
We do not.
You wish you could.
Whose side are you on?
The bees!
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!
Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked
your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.
I remember that.
What right do they have to our honey?
We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?
Sting them where it really hurts.
In the face! The eye!
That would hurt.
No.
Up the nose? That's a killer.
There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.

A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.
Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?
Bees have never been afraid to change the world.
What about Bee Oolumbus? Bee Gandhi? Bejesus?
Where I'm from, we'd never sue humans.
We were thinking of stickball or candy stores.
How old are you?
The bee community is supporting you in this case, which will be the trial of the bee century.
You know, they have a Larry King in the human world too.
It's a common name. Next week...
He looks like you and has a show and suspenders and colored dots...
Next week...
Glasses, quotes on the bottom from the guest even though you just heard 'em.
Bear Week next week! They're scary, hairy and here live.
Always leans forward, pointy shoulders, squinty eyes, very Jewish.
In tennis, you attack at the point of weakness!
It was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.
Honey, her backhand's a joke!
I'm not gonna take advantage of that?
Quiet, please.
Actual work going on here.
Is that that same bee?
Yes, it is!
I'm helping him sue the human race.
Hello.
Hello, bee.
This is Ken.
Yeah, I remember you. Timberland, size ten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.
Why does he talk again?
Listen, you better go 'cause we're really busy working.
But it's our yogurt night!
Bye-bye.
Why is yogurt night so difficult?!
You poor thing. You two have been at this for hours!
Yes, and Adam here has been a huge help.
Frosting...
How many sugars?
Just one. I try not to use the competition.
So why are you helping me?
Bees have good qualities. And it takes my mind off the shop. Instead of flowers, people are giving balloon bouquets now.
Those are great, if you're three.
And artificial flowers.
Oh, those just get me psychotic!
Yeah, me too.
Bent stingers, pointless pollination.
Bees must hate those fake things!
Nothing worse than a daffodil that's had work done.
Maybe this could make up for it a little bit.
This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.
I guess.
You sure you want to go through with it?
Am I sure? When I'm done with the humans, they won't be able to say, ""Honey, I'm home,"" without paying a royalty!
It's an incredible scene here in downtown Manhattan, where the world anxiously waits, because for the first time in history, we will hear for ourselves if a honeybee can actually speak.
What have we gotten into here, Barry?
It's pretty big, isn't it?
I can't believe how many humans don't work during the day.
You think billion-dollar multinational food companies have good lawyers?
Everybody needs to stay behind the barricade.
What's the matter?
I don't know, I just got a chill.
Well, if it isn't the bee team.
You boys work on this?
All rise! The Honorable Judge Bumbleton presiding.
All right. Case number 4475,
Superior Court of New York,
Barry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry is now in session.
Mr. Montgomery, you're representing the five food companies collectively?
A privilege.
Mr. Benson... you're representing all the bees of the world?
I'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.
Mr. Montgomery, your opening statement, please.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, my grandmother was a simple woman. Born on a farm, she believed it was man's divine right to benefit from the bounty of nature God put before us.
If we lived in the topsy-turvy world Mr. Benson imagines, just think of what would it mean.
I would have to negotiate with the silkworm for the elastic in my britches!
Talking bee!
How do we know this isn't some sort of holographic motion-picture-capture Hollywood wizardry?
They could be using laser beams! Robotics! Ventriloquism! Cloning! For all we know, he could be on steroids!
Mr. Benson?
Ladies and gentlemen, there's no trickery here. I'm just an ordinary bee. Honey's pretty important to me. It's important to all bees. We invented it! We make it. And we protect it with our lives.
Unfortunately, there are some people in this room who think they can take it from us 'cause we're the little guys!
I'm hoping that, after this is all over, you'll see how, by taking our honey, you not only take everything we have but everything we are!
I wish he'd dress like that all the time. So nice!
Call your first witness.
So, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden of Honey Farms, big company you have.
I suppose so.
I see you also own Honeyburton and Honron!
Yes, they provide beekeepers for our farms.
Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term.
I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?
No.
I couldn't hear you.
No.
No. Because you don't free bees. You keep bees. Not only that, it seems you thought a bear would be an appropriate image for a jar of honey.
They're very lovable creatures. Yogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.
You mean like this?
Bears kill bees!
How'd you like his head crashing through your living room?! Biting into your couch! Spitting out your throw pillows! OK, that's enough. Take him away.
So, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here. Your name intrigues me. Where have I heard it before?
I was with a band called The Police.
But you've never been a police officer, have you?
No, I haven't.
No, you haven't. And so here we have yet another example of bee culture casually stolen by a human for nothing more than a prance-about stage name.
Oh, please.
Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting? Because I'm feeling a little stung, Sting. Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!
That's not his real name?! You idiots!
Mr. Liotta, first, belated congratulations on your Emmy win for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
Thank you. Thank you.
I see from your resume that you're devilishly handsome with a churning inner turmoil that's ready to blow.
I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?
Not yet it isn't. But is this what it's come to for you? Exploiting tiny, helpless bees so you don't have to rehearse your part and learn your lines, sir?
Watch it, Benson! I could blow right now!
This isn't a goodfella.
This is a badfella!
Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?!
Order in this court!
You're all thinking it!
Order! Order, I say!
Say it!
Mr. Liotta, please sit down!
I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side.
Are we doing everything right, legally?
I'm a florist.
Right. Well, here's to a great team.
To a great team!
Well, hello.
Ken!
Hello.
I didn't think you were coming.
No, I was just late I tried to call, but... the battery.
I didn't want all this to go to waste,
so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.
Oh, that was lucky.
There's a little left. I could heat it up.
Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.

My first sleep paralysis episode occurred when I was taking a nap in the middle of the day, I am a stomach sleeper and cannot sleep if I‚Äôm not on my stomach I know it‚Äôs bad for my back lol. Anyways, I woke up and lifted my head while still laying on my stomach kind of like one of those PE exercises but all of a sudden I felt a hand come around the right side of my face and hold my nose and mouth close. I actually couldn‚Äôt breathe for a little and it felt like I was going to suffocate, the only person in the house at the time was my mom so I thought it was her messing with me or something but it wasn‚Äôt. I realized I was frozen and helpless, I tried screaming for my mom‚Äôs name but I couldn‚Äôt get it out. Finally I was able to move and breathe but it was so terrifying. The second time was pretty crazy too. I was taking a nap on my couch again in the middle of the day after eating and I set my plate on our coffee table. I thought I saw my mom come and poke me and grab my head and shake me for some reason. I saw her take my plate and walk into the kitchen so I got up 2 seconds after she walked into the kitchen but when I got into the kitchen she wasn‚Äôt there. So I went to find her and my dad and they were both in the room and I asked them if they were just in the kitchen and they said no. So terrified and confused I walked away without telling them.

1gm9pc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gm9pc1/aita_for_getting_the_gathering_cancelled/,AITA for getting the gathering cancelled ,"Background: me (41f) last January marked my 10 years at my company in a small accounting office. We generally get cake on our birthdays and for some occasions and we'll sit together and eat it. When my 10 came up my boss told me I would get a cake and celebrate. But nothing ever happened, and no one mentioned it at all after that. Which is whatever but why go out of your way to bring it up and then not do anything or tell anyone? I never said anything about it and just let it go. 

Another background some companies do what's called corporate challenge which is just different companies playing sports against each other for 1 day per sport (kickball, softball, bowling etc) and a woman in my office played in like 6 of 14 sports so she was the MVP. Got put in the company newsletter. Cool for her right.

So today I come in and I'm told we're doing cake to celebrate her for that. And it really upset me because I worked here for 10 years and get nothing, she plays in a few games and we do a thing for her? Don't get me wrong I'm happy for her but I just felt so...I guess unappreciated is the word. I got upset, it made me feel like shit. So I go in the break room for coffee and someone noticed I was upset. I said ""yeah sorry I'm just really upset, makes me feel like shit that we're doing cake for her but for my 10 years I didn't even get a congrats from anyone."" And I went back to my desk. Apparently word got around and she just got the cake at her desk and we didn't sit together to eat it. So it kinda got cancelled, because I was upset. But I wasn't trying to get it cancelled I was conveying how I felt. I didn't want to take away her celebration I wanted recognition too. So AITA?",1,1731037984.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False
1gm9ox0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gm9ox0/aita_for_wanting_to_sue_a_bus_company_for_an/,AITA for wanting to sue a bus company for an accident was involved in on the bus? (Sorry its kinda long),"I, 19F, 18 at the time, was riding a bus the first week of school (September 3) on route to see my girlfriend and bring her and her sister coffee when the bus driver abruptly slammed on his breaks. 

There were three other people on the bus with me aside from the driver. I was sitting on a seat approximately 4 seats away from the driver seat (in those seats that face the sides of the bus, so you‚Äôre looking out the window) and ended up getting absolutely thrown sideways. I hit almost every part of my body off of those four seats, and was launched into the back of the driver seat shoulder first. I then smashed my mid spine into a pole, and then fell to the ground again on the same shoulder. 

I did not hit my head. 

The bus driver stopped the bus, said nothing, and sat there completely silent while I rolled on the ground for a solid minute or two. 

After I started to get up, limping, a nearby PASSENGER asked me if I was okay, to which i responded with, ‚Äúyeah, sure. Just fine‚Äù. The bus driver continued to say nothing but stayed stopped on the side of the road while I collected the coffees which has been launched from my hand and (surprisingly) weren‚Äôt spilled everywhere. 

Two days later, on September 5th, I went to the doctors. I wasn‚Äôt planning on it as my friend had given me naproxen (which for reference is supposed to last up to 12 hours) but an hour fifteen after taking it, I was walking on campus and I got a shooting pain that started from my left kneecap and skyrocketed throughout my entire leg (which obviously scared me). 

The doctor took xrays of my leg and shoulder (told me my spine wasnt a concern despite literally smashing it off a pole but ok) and told me I likely injured my rotator cuff. He gave me a sling and told me to wear it. If pain was still there after two weeks, come back. 

Two weeks passed and the pain was getting better but I was crossing an intersection and my entire left leg went numb. Not pins in needles but like ‚Äúoh this isnt attached to my body anymore‚Äù numb. My fingers had also been going numb on and off multiple times throughout the day (a tingly numb though). I told the NEW doctor all of this information and he just brushed it off and told me i was okay to take the sling off. 

The weekend of September 28th, I was in niagara and my mom had me set up a doctor appointment with my family doctor. So October 3rd i went to see her. She said it was odd that they didnt check my spine, and that it was also odd that he suggested a rotator cuff injury as the only way to know for sure is an ultrasound (which he did not do). She had me get xrays of my lower, mid, and top areas of my spine, and an ultrasound of both my right shoulder and left knee. 

Everything came back clear. 

At this point the pain in my shoulder had mostly gone with the exception of strenuous activity like a friendly 1v1 game of horse w my friend, or if I moved it too much in the same day. My knee hadnt been hurting much either except for the occasional movement or if I bent down. My fingers would go numb once every two or three ish days. 

She confirmed that it might have been a rotator cuff injury but she wouldnt know because the scans and ultrasounds were clear. She told me to take it easy. 

The pain went away. 

A month ago, in early October, the pain came back in my shoulder and knee but only for a week and it was on and off so I didnt see a doctor since three doctors had now told me nothing was wrong. No more tingling or numbness in my fingers. 

Well today (November 7) i woke up with pain in my shoulder but it was more of a ‚Äúi slept wrong‚Äù kind of pain. Throughout the day it just kept getting worse to the point where I am now back in my sling because if I move or flex either my shoulder or neck, it feels like someone is actively trying to dislocate my shoulder (which is not fun). 

When the incident first occurred in September I called my mom (bc obviously) and she called the bus company to file a report in case I needed physical therapy. They insinuated that I was at fault for the accident and they had to conduct their own investigation. They then asked for a virtual meeting, to which I agreed to and my mom said she would reach out to our lawyer. 

He said to tell them i was seeking counsel and that I would not be able to attend a meeting until after that point. 

My lawyer said to just not say anything to them or contact them, and that if things got worse to let him know, and we would sue for damages, pt coverage (if needed), and compensation for any and all expenses: ie. sling, pt., if I need meds or a specialist that isnt covered, etc. 

Well so I told my girlfriend I was back in my sling and explained my predicament (she knew about all of it except for today‚Äôs information) and mentioned that I had to let my mom know so she could inform our lawyer bc if it was serious we would be suing for the things mentioned above. She responded with:

‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to hear about the accident. i don‚Äôt agree with it. but i‚Äôm sorry ur shoulder is still hurting‚Äù

I, obv, asked her what she meant and she said ‚ÄúI dont want to hear about your family suing people‚Äù

I make jokes sometimes ab suing people so I tried to set the record straight (ie. ‚Äúmcdonalds got my order wrong im gonna sue‚Äù and then I laugh. Or ‚Äúif they dont have my favourite soda im gonna sue‚Äù and then I laugh). 

I told her that my family has only ever sued people twice (once when my mother was in a horrible car crash. She now has chronic pain and a list longer than santas nice list of medical conditions bc of it. And again when my older sister was in high school bc she was forced to participate in a gym class (options were a: the free, less strenuous one or b: the paid harder one) despite everyone voting for the free one and she tore the cartilage in both her knees right before her cheer championships. Four other people got injured and they tried to force everyone to pay)

I also told her:

‚ÄúThis was 100% the bus driver‚Äôs fault. He was going 20 over the legal limit (which thanks to Life360 I can prove). He slammed on his brakes for a reason he refuses to disclose (i thought it was bc someone crossed in the street when they werent supposed to but the driver denied there being a pedestrian and wouldnt say why he braked so harshly). He didn‚Äôt check or ask if I was OK. He did not file a report when we called to file a report, they tried to accuse me of being in the wrong and being the reason I got hurt.‚Äù

And she just went: ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to hear about it lol but do whatever u think is right‚Äù

I go to the clinic tomorrow but I cant help but wonder; am i an asshole for wanting to sue the bus company if it turns out to be something serious? Or am I within my rights to sue?",3,1731037945.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Make sure he makes time for family. Hes devoted to them but gets caught up in his own world and forgets to spend time with them. 

Listen intentently when he talks about cars and his projects. Ask questions, you don't have to understand it he loves to teach others. He tries his best to explain things simply, he's not talking down to you he just goes to teacher mode.

He loves the smell of eucalyptus and clean smells. 

Always say I love you back and never end a phone call  without saying it.

Hes sober and would rather drive anyone then let anyone drink a sip of alcohol and drive.

He's smarter than he lets on and more than he gives himself credit for.

He will make you feel like the only person that ever mattered.

It's crazy how your life really can flash before your eyes.

Though I couldn't remember her name, I remembered her laugh.

How it felt to smile, the contortions in her mouth.

I remembered her feeling happy.

Sad.

Angry.

Scared.

Pain.

I remembered her life.

No.

My life.

‚ÄúHoly shit, you're in Family 101 too?‚Äù

I met him when I was buying coffee.

I don't remember his name. Names, like everything else, are gone.

There are only blurs in my mind that resemble faces and splinters of what could have been a voice. I've been told to write this as closure for myself, accepting my pain and moving on from my past. But the more I write, the more I remember, and like a virus, it is slowly taking over me.

The boy who would later become Brother was the guy standing behind me, whistling to himself, scrolling through TikTok with the volume just a little too loud for 8:30.

*‚ÄúDo you guys like slime and‚Äì‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI bought three mac and cheese meals for fifteen dollars‚Äì‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYellowstone Caldera has lain dormant for‚Äì‚Äù*

*‚ÄúWhat's YOUR favorite type of cheese? I'm going to go with gouda, but I also like‚Äì‚Äù*

In my last seconds, I visualize the memory like I am there, imagining each sense.

I remember it was raining, and the smell of the rain comforted me. I could taste bubblegum in my mouth, and the slightest hint of chocolate pastry and stale orange juice. It was the start of spring, and cherry blossoms were already blooming outside, petals dancing across the walk. There was a small local coffee shop off campus that did morning lattes with free sugar cookies.

Not an ideal breakfast, but it was energy, and I needed it after barely sleeping the night before. The guy behind me, who couldn't seem to stand still, bouncing up and down on his heels like a hyperactive child, wasn't helping.

I was already highly irate, and it didn't take much to piss me off in the morning. The coffee steamer made me cringe, the sound of cups and silverware grating on my nerves.

The barista making my drink looked like she hated her life, which wasn't making me feel any better. She worked like a robot, her hands doing several things at once. The girl had light blonde hair hanging in her face. The shadows under her eyes were making me tired.

College student. Maybe in her last year.

I thought about making idle conversation, but when I happened to catch her eye, she silently pleaded with me not to.

I could kind of sympathize with her.

I worked in my grandpa's coffee shop in Thailand when I was fourteen.

Never again.

Instead of striking up a chat and making her morning worse, I only offered a smile. My phone was already dying after I maxed out the battery doom-scrolling, and my headphones were in my bag. So, I pulled out my class schedule. I thought I was hallucinating when I glimpsed it earlier that morning.

There was one particular class that didn't make sense. It just appeared out of nowhere. I already knew my core classes and electives, so what the fuck was Family 101? I called the college to inquire, but the woman I had been speaking to put the phone down on me.

When I called again, I was directed to the Dean‚Äôs office, which, of course, did not pick up.

So, I found myself on my way to Family 101.

Whatever it was.

I didn't realize phone guy was peering over my shoulder until he cleared his throat loudly.

‚ÄúHoly shit, you're in that weird class too?‚Äù

When I twisted around, he nodded at my schedule. This guy looked like he'd just rolled out of bed, hiding behind a mop of sandy-colored curls. His trench coat immediately cemented him as an English major. I wasn't sure what was more pretentious, his style or the unlit cigarette hanging out of his mouth.

The kid pulled out his own schedule, neatly folded into a square, pointing to it like an excited kid.

‚ÄúFamily 101 with Professor Hargreaves? I'm in there too, man!‚Äù

I nodded, hesitantly. ‚ÄúYeah. Room GH78?‚Äù

He responded with a grin. ‚ÄúIt's a small world, huh.‚Äù

Before I could answer, my order was called out. ‚ÄúCaramel latte?‚Äù

Turning back to the counter, the barista was finishing up my drink, piercing the lid with a straw. But her eyes weren't on me. She was glaring at Mr. Pretentious.

‚ÄúNo smoking allowed in here.‚Äù Her voice was a little too monotone to be human.

The guy inclined his head. ‚ÄúBut it's not technically smoking, miss.‚Äù

His emphasis on miss was scathing. Ooh, these two knew each other.

‚ÄúSir,‚Äù The barista's smile was a little too forced, though there was a hint of amusement in her tone. ‚ÄúI said there's no smoking allowed in here,‚Äù she paused, folding her arms. ‚ÄúGet rid of it, or I'm telling Mom.‚Äù

Ohh. Siblings.

When I turned to Mr. Pretentious, the boy‚Äôs eyes had darkened, lips curving around the cigarette. ‚ÄúOh, wow. How old are you now, like twenty-five? And you're going to run to Mom?‚Äù He plucked the cigarette from his mouth, waving it around. ‚ÄúIt's not even lit, dumbass. It's clearly a metaphor.‚Äù

Unfazed, the girl took another order, maintaining her smile. ‚ÄúGet rid of it.‚Äù

He scoffed, not backing down. The girl standing behind Mr. P was discreetly filming their little argument. ‚ÄúI'm eighteen now,‚Äù the boy said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou guys can't order me around anymore.‚Äù

The girl inclined her head, humoring him. ‚ÄúTrue. But you'll stop being Mom‚Äôs perfect little golden boy if she finds out you smoke.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I'm not even smoking!‚Äù

She raised a brow. ‚ÄúYou're chewing a cigarette. The rules at home don't apply here so you can't get your own way like you always do. Get rid of it before my boss has an aneurysm, or I'm telling Mom her perfect son smokes fifty packs a day.‚Äù

I sensed him stiffening behind me, losing his bravado. ‚ÄúYou wouldn't.‚Äù

‚ÄúI would. She's already suspicious.‚Äù

The guy rolled his eyes, plucking out the cigarette and stuffing it into his pocket. ‚ÄúYou're a little bitch, Bess.‚Äù

The barista, or Bess, straightened up, blowing a kiss. ‚ÄúLove you too, Acey.‚Äù

He made a face. ‚ÄúUrgh! Don't make it weird!‚Äù

Bess‚Äôs gaze found mine, satisfied. ‚ÄúEnjoy your drink.‚Äù

I found my voice, avoiding their sibling spat. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

I attempted to leave the store, but the guy stepped in front of me, blocking my way. Bess served another customer, maintaining a smile through gritted teeth. 

I noticed she was hitting the cash register a little too hard. 

‚ÄúOoh, by the way, Dad‚Äôs birthday party is on Sunday, and I know you're trying to avoid it. Yes, his *new girlfriend* is coming. If you don't turn up and leave me to deal with the terror twins, I will burn you alive.‚Äù

The boy mocked a frown, inclining his head. ‚ÄúAww, Bess, I didn‚Äôt realize you cared that much about me!‚Äù His tone dripped with sarcasm. ‚ÄúI mean, I would *love* to watch Mom and Dad scream at each other all day, but I‚Äôm actually busy.‚Äù 

He stepped back, shooting her a grin. I made another attempt to sidestep him, only for the guy to stop me again, this time motioning for me to wait.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be going away for a while, sis. You‚Äôll probably never see me again.‚Äù

Bess didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúThe party starts at three,‚Äù she grumbled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you there.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you won‚Äôt,‚Äù he sang. ‚ÄúI told you, this is the last time you‚Äôll be seeing me.‚Äù

Bess caught my gaze, her eyes rolling into the back of her head. ‚ÄúIf only.‚Äù

‚ÄúI heard that.‚Äù

Bess slammed an iced mocha down. ‚ÄúYou were supposed to, dear brother.‚Äù

The last thing I wanted was to accidentally insert myself into an apparent family affair. 

So, when I saw an opening, I grabbed my coffee and made my way to the door, only for Mr. Trenchcoat to follow me, swiping a can of coffee from the counter.

‚ÄúHey! You can't just take that!‚Äù His sister squeaked. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay for it later!‚Äù he shouted over his shoulder, ignoring Bess‚Äôs *‚ÄùI thought I was never going to see you again?‚Äù*

‚ÄúYo! Family 101. Mind if I join ya?‚Äù

I guess I had already made a friend.

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

I regretted my response maybe 0.1 seconds later.

This guy would *not* shut up.

‚ÄúSo, Family 101 sounds shady, right? Or am I crazy?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds strange,‚Äù I commented. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say shady, though.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs weird?‚Äù he said, the two of us pushing back out into the warm spring air. The conversation started out fairly normal, only to devolve into conspiracy theories. Still, though, his company was better than being alone.

Tuning out most of his manic muttering, I found myself smiling, reveling in a light breeze blowing my hair out of my face. Most of my memories are gone, cruelly torn away. But I still have pieces, splinters of a puzzle I‚Äôve been piecing together.

It was the perfect temperature. Not warm enough for short sleeves yet, but I didn‚Äôt have to wear a coat.

I remembered my coffee was too hot, scalding, and I took hesitant sips, immediately burning my tongue.

I didn‚Äôt even know his name.

His accent was endearing, a slight English undertone if I concentrated. He jumped over cracks on the walk, already talking at a speed I couldn‚Äôt keep up with. But it was refreshing. While he spoke in fast forward, I took notice of his stripy backpack that was unzipped, half of his books hanging out.

When he skipped in front of me, I zipped it up for him.

Not that he noticed.

‚ÄúI mean, I thought the name was kinda funny, like what, are they teaching eighteen-year-olds how to make families now?‚Äù He twisted around with his arms spread out, expecting me to answer.

I just shrugged, sipping my coffee.

The guy was already getting odd looks from commuters. 

I don‚Äôt think he knew how loud he was talking. ‚ÄúYeah! Exactly, right? I mean, *zero* of my friends have this class, and I‚Äôve asked a lot of people in my dorm. Family 101 doesn‚Äôt exist according to Google, and that is already a huge red flag‚Äì‚Äù The guy cracked open his coffee and took a long swig (and a breath, thankfully), his expression twisting like he‚Äôd bitten into a lemon.

‚ÄúUrgh!‚Äù

When he politely covered his mouth before turning and spitting it out onto the sidewalk, I couldn‚Äôt resist a snort.

‚ÄúDo you not like canned coffee?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs diet!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you get a normal coffee?‚Äù

The guy blew a raspberry, taking another experimental sip. This time he didn‚Äôt spit it out, but he did dramatize swallowing it. ‚ÄúBess would do unspeakable things to it,‚Äù he held up his can. ‚ÄúI would rather drink sewer water.‚Äù

I nodded slowly, following him across the road. I could see the campus ahead. It was smaller than I thought, a glass structure reflecting the early morning sun. ‚ÄúBess. So, that was your sister?‚Äù

The guy shot me a look, his eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúUrgh. No. Ignore her, she was dropped on the head as a kid. I‚Äôm pretty sure Bess is running on half a brain cell.‚Äù

I laughed. ‚ÄúShe called you little bro!‚Äù

This kid was stubborn, downing his *sewer water* coffee. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs her official title, but I‚Äôm pretty sure Mom fucked a demon, and out *she* came.‚Äù

I sipped my own lukewarm coffee. ‚ÄúYour family sounds‚Ä¶ interesting.‚Äù

I still didn‚Äôt know his name, and yet somehow that was okay. The guy spluttered, though his expression darkened. ‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt know the half of it,‚Äù he was squeezing the can in his fist, pulverizing aluminum between his fingers. 

‚ÄúI have a helicopter mom who I just managed to escape. Dad fucked his twenty-year-old assistant, and my older sister is the second coming of Satan.‚Äù

‚ÄúEscape?‚Äù I managed to say in a breath.

His gaze wandered. ‚ÄúYeah. Mom‚Äôs intense. When I was in school, she wouldn‚Äôt let me date or even have friends. It had to be just the two of us,‚Äù the boy sighed. ‚ÄúMom hated Bess when she was little. Dad said it was postpartum depression, and she tried to get help, except she had no bond with her whatsoever.‚Äù He shot me a sickly smile.

‚ÄúIt was different when I was born. Mom loved me and treated Bess like shit,‚Äù his voice cracked a little. ‚ÄúWhen we were kids, it was always me who got toys and vacations to Disney, while Bess got nothing. So, naturally, my older sister grew to resent me because, in her words,‚Äù he mimicked his sister‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm the evil brother who took away her mom.‚Äù

Before I could respond, he sighed. ‚ÄúBess can have her. That woman is a certified psycho, and I don‚Äôt say that lightly about my own mother.‚Äù The guy raked his fingers down his face, and I could see the mental turmoil in his eyes.

No wonder this kid didn‚Äôt want to go to his dad‚Äôs party.

‚ÄúMom locked me in my room when I turned fifteen and refused to let me have friends. She tried to homeschool me, but Dad was against it‚Ä¶ thank God. I had a curfew of 3:30 after school, and if I wasn‚Äôt back on the dot, she would come looking for me and drag me back home.‚Äù

He let out a bitter laugh, and I found myself wondering why it was me this stranger was pouring his heart out to.

‚ÄúI only managed to get away from her because of college, and even then, she tried to force me to get a job and stay at home. I had to wait until she was sleeping so I could move out. Otherwise, she would try to manipulate me into staying, and I would rather die than live in that house.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúDid Bess and your dad try to help you?‚Äù

The kid surprised me with a laugh. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding, right?‚Äù

We entered the campus building through automatic doors, and he stuck to my side. The interior was cozy. I appreciated the reception area filled with leather reclining chairs and the smell of freshly ground coffee beans.

When I asked where our classroom was, we were directed up a flight of stairs. 

My new friend took them two at a time. ‚ÄúBess thinks I was Mom‚Äôs golden boy, and sure, I was on the outside. But I was also a prisoner in my own home.‚Äù Reaching the top of the stairs, the boy didn‚Äôt turn around, waiting for me to catch up. ‚ÄúMy sister either didn‚Äôt see it or was in denial that I was being treated worse than her.‚Äù

When I joined him, he surprised me with a smile.

‚ÄúAnd *that* is why you should never have a family.‚Äù He mocked a bow. ‚ÄúThank you for coming to my TED Talk.‚Äù

I offered him a slightly forced grin.

‚ÄúNoted!‚Äù

The *last* thing this guy needed was a class called Family 101.

He needed therapy.

The two of us were late to the class, immediately catching the attention of the professor, who was mid-rant. He was younger than I imagined, a thirty-something-year-old man standing in front of a PowerPoint presentation.

‚ÄúLatecomers, please do not interrupt your classmates and find a seat. Thank you.‚Äù The classroom was filled with students, and I squeezed into a seat at the front, the guy plonking down next to me.

‚ÄúAs I was saying,‚Äù the man paced up and down the stage. ‚ÄúPeople are not having babies anymore, or they are, but they‚Äôre not in stable families. Birth rates are at an all-time high, but how many of those women are in real families?‚Äù

The boy nudged me, chuckling. ‚ÄúOh, boy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmerican families are dying,‚Äù the professor continued. ‚ÄúYoung people don‚Äôt *want* to create a family these days. They want to travel the world or progress in their careers. You have your teenage years to do that. Your childhood is for discovering your identity and who you are.‚Äù He stopped pacing.

‚ÄúOver fifty percent of young people these days choose to live at home with their parents to escape the reality of being an adult. You choose to bury yourselves in nostalgia, gaming, television, and movies to avoid entering the world of adulthood and starting a proper family.‚Äù

The others murmured around me, some in agreement, while the majority were laughing at him.

‚ÄúHe definitely made those statistics up,‚Äù my friend rolled his eyes, leaning back in his seat. ‚ÄúThis guy is a certified nut.‚Äù

I had to agree. Fifty percent was overkill.

The professor was unfazed by the reaction. ‚ÄúI mean a *real* family. A mother and a father, and their children. Most American families are broken up and divorced. The children grow up with an unstable mother and an absent father. The mother is usually a teen parent, and the father left because he couldn‚Äôt bear the responsibility.‚Äù

‚ÄúOut of touch freak!‚Äù someone shouted from the audience.

‚ÄúWhat if we don‚Äôt want to have families?‚Äù a girl spoke up. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you trying to say?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù another girl joined in. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the 1950s anymore, weirdo.‚Äù

A boy stood up, cupping his mouth.

‚ÄúWho gives *you* the right to tell us what to do? We‚Äôre adults, aren‚Äôt we?‚Äù

The professor folded his arms stubbornly. ‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù he ordered the boy, who slumped into his seat. ‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs do a small exercise. I want you to raise your hand if you are pursuing a career as a YouTuber or online influencer.‚Äù

Looking around, nobody did.

The professor pursed his lips. ‚ÄúOkay then, raise your hand if you are pursuing a career involving the internet.‚Äù

This time, half of the class raised their hands.

‚ÄúThis is exactly my point,‚Äù the professor stepped back. ‚ÄúYou are the next generation who will take control of our country. You will be expected to make choices, to look after our children, and ensure we continue to be great. Yet your brains are rotting. You only care about likes, followers, and engagement. You have been brought up on the internet, brainwashed to crave the luxury lifestyles thrown in your faces.‚Äù

He stepped forward. ‚ÄúWhen you *should* be building families.‚Äù

Ouch.

‚ÄúShould we go?‚Äù my friend whispered, knocking my shoulder. ‚ÄúWe should definitely go, right? Unless you want to listen to Mr. Patriot crying about teenagers having minds of their own.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy should we make families?‚Äù a girl behind me spat, breaking the silence. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even feel safe going to school.‚Äù

Another stood up. ‚ÄúWhy should *we* do what *you* want when you failed us and will continue to fail our hypothetical children that you so desperately want?‚Äù

To my surprise, my friend joined in. ‚ÄúGet off the stage, man. You‚Äôre embarrassing yourself.‚Äù

Ignoring him, the teacher cleared his throat. ‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù His piercing gaze found my friend. ‚ÄúRaise your hands if you have grown up in a broken family.‚Äù

Something seemed to snap in the boy‚Äôs expression.

His arm shot up, as did everyone else‚Äôs.

I found myself torn.

Mom did leave me when I was twelve, but it was because of her mental health.

She couldn‚Äôt cope with having a child.

But I was still writing her letters and visiting the wellness center she was at.

Still, though.

That meant Dad was never home, and I brought myself up.

With a heavy heart, I slowly held up my hand, too.

Professor Hargreaves was visibly satisfied.

‚ÄúYou were *all* failed by your own parents,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you like to build a family to make up for your own abandonment? Your own trauma? Don‚Äôt you want to raise healthy children who will go on to make a difference? Make our country proud?‚Äù

Jesus.

I shared a mutual smirk with Mr. Trenchcoat.

I was half expecting the Star-Spangled Banner to start playing.

Though there was just silence.

Before a guy laughed. ‚ÄúDude. You need help.‚Äù

He jumped up, offering the professor a two-fingered salute. ‚ÄúKids suck. Besides, I‚Äôd be a shit father, so no thanks.‚Äù

The entire front row followed him, grabbing their bags.

Then my row. I stood up, too, but my friend pulled me back down.

When I turned to him in confusion, I noticed he was trembling, his cheeks sickly pale under overexposed light.

‚ÄúGet down.‚Äù

He dropped to his knees, and I followed, ducking my head. 

‚ÄúWhat is it, what's wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe doors,‚Äù the boy hissed. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre locking the doors!‚Äù

He was right.

When I lifted my head, students were already protesting, pushing their way to the exits where a frightening number of guards were congregating. The main door was blocked. ‚ÄúSit down,‚Äù the professor ordered. ‚ÄúIf you do not take your seat, you will be considered ineligible for the Family 101 program and will be dealt with accordingly.‚Äù

I crawled back into my seat, the boy following suit.

‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we have a choice.‚Äù

I found my voice. ‚ÄúTo what?‚Äù

He squeezed his eyes shut, grasping for my hand. ‚ÄúThe name of the class.‚Äù

‚ÄúI repeat,‚Äù Professor Hargreaves said, ‚ÄúIf you do not take your seat immediately, you will be considered ineligible for the Family 101 program and will be dealt with accordingly.‚Äù

When a girl suddenly dropped to the ground, nobody seemed to notice.

But then the guy in front of me fell to his knees, then his stomach.

I didn‚Äôt notice his blood spraying my face until my vision blurred.

Another girl tipped sideways.

The entire front row went down like dominoes, and yet I stayed perfectly still.

I could feel red warmth slick on my face, dripping down my chin.

Pieces of skull dotted my desk like cat‚Äôs teeth.

In the long, dizzying moment between watching my classmates‚Äô brains being blown out and realizing I would not be getting out of that room alive, I was forced to my feet. I was still covered in blood. I could taste it on my tongue, and it didn‚Äôt make sense how and why there was so much. Reality didn‚Äôt make sense, and I don‚Äôt think I wanted it to make sense. Sound came in waves, bleeding into me and then fading out.

Screams slammed into my skull.

Students dropped into their seats, their eyes wild.

I was half aware of being violently dragged backwards, grouped with the girls, while my friend was pulled back and forced into line with the boys. 

The professor told us to stand still, and we did, while a swath of black surrounded us. Guards. They poked and prodded us, forcing us to line up like cattle to the slaughter.

Ten, no, twelve, of us were dead.

The rest of us were prisoners.

I remembered absently wiping slick red from a blonde‚Äôs cheek.

Oh, I thought dizzily.

So, *this* was Family 101.

I forgot how to think straight after that.

The world became a playground, and my mind was cotton candy. I was on my knees on the classroom floor, and then I was standing in a large white room with the rest of the girls. We were allowed to shower and dress, and that‚Äôs the last time I remember coherently thinking.

When I was dragging a scratchy sponge across my skin, watching a stranger‚Äôs blood swirl around the faucet, I picked up the shampoo bottle and peered at it through soaking strands of hair glued to my face.

No tears.

I wasn‚Äôt crying, and the shampoo didn‚Äôt sting.

No TEARS.

I laughed, a hysterical bubble of giggles escaping my mouth.

Tears.

I began with my scalp, ripping out clumps of my hair.

The shampoo bottle said *no tears*.

So, why did I want to tear off my own skin? Why did I want to drown myself under the spigot and escape the white?

I scrubbed my skin until my arms were bleeding, until I dropped to my knees and clawed at my legs with my fingernails. 

There was so much blood, so much of him painting me, scalding my skin, and I didn‚Äôt even know his name.

When I tried to claw my eyes out, a female guard restrained me.

First, they took my identity.

This is where I would tell you my name, but I don‚Äôt remember it.

Every part of me, every piece of *her*, was wiped away.

The girl who liked bad horror movies and wanted to be an artist.

Inside the room with pale blue walls, that girl‚Äôs body and mind were twisted and contorted into me. They tore away my ability to cry, to scream, to beg for help, forcing metal rods into my skull and twisting until I gave up my name through a cry that begged to die. They forced me to give up the names of my family and friends, replacing them with names I did not know yet. But as the light flickered above me and time passed slowly, I stopped screaming.

I repeated the names I was told to say. When I didn‚Äôt speak fast enough, I demanded to be punished.

When the electroshocks stopped running up and down my spine, my body no longer belonged to me.

I did not have feelings of pain when the back of my head was cut open.

I did not scream or cry or beg to die.

Instead, I lay very still while they hollowed me out.

When I joined a long line of girls under fluorescent lights, we looked the same.

Dolls with perfect faces and ponytails, dressed in light pink dresses.

We were Sisters.

They told us how to smile.

How to present ourselves.

If we didn‚Äôt smile, we were replaced.

If we relaxed our expression or showed emotion, we were deactivated.

The topics we were allowed to discuss:

**Cooking and cleaning with our mother, and our favorite book from book club.**

When one of us stumbled, she was dragged away and replaced with another.

I stayed in a single white room with a pink bed and a stuffed toy I named Ace.

On Choosing Day, I was given my new parents.

I was Sunny Fairview. Sixteen years old. I enjoyed reading books, listening to the radio, and helping my mother clean the house and cook dinner.

My favorite book was *Paradise Lost*.

I wore a bright yellow dress and a red ribbon in my hair.

Mother smelled like raspberries when I hugged her.

Father shook my hand and told me I was already the best daughter he‚Äôd ever had.

Brother joined us soon after. He was taller than me, brown hair slicked back, wearing simple jeans and a checkered shirt. When he first hugged me, he smelled of singed flesh, and his brain was leaking out of his nose.

Brother was dragged away after failing to announce his name, his lip wobbling.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù he whimpered, blinking rapidly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs‚Äì‚Äù

When he was dragged away, the rest of us pretended everything was fine. 

He came back an hour later with a wide smile.

Freddie Fairview. Sixteen years old. He enjoyed football and working construction.

We lived in a small suburban neighborhood.

Our house had a white picket fence, and Freddie and I liked to play in the yard.

I read books and listened to the radio in my bedroom.

Freddie played football.

Fridays were my favorite. We had eggs benedict for breakfast, and we did all kinds of family activities together. 

The target knelt in front of me, throwing up his arms in surrender. 

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt do anything‚Äì‚Äù

Father shot him square in the head, and I lowered my gun, tucking it into my dress.

Freddie, following Father‚Äôs orders, plucked the man's eyes from his skull.

We were ordered to hand in both of them.

The Fairview family was never told any other information, except our target and location.

Luckily, the second target was at the diner while we were tucking into our breakfast. Father used his charms as usual, while Freddie and I stayed on standby. I held the rest of the customers hostage while Mother finished her orange juice. When the target tried to escape, Brother intercepted him at the door, easily dodging his attacks.

The target was desperate, but Brother was fast.

With not much effort, Freddie Fairview was holding the target in the air, his legs dangling.

Mother continued to eat her breakfast, slicing into her sausage. ‚ÄúCareful, son of mine,‚Äù she hummed. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to cause a commotion now, do you?‚Äù

Brother blinked. ‚ÄúNo, of course not, Mother.‚Äù

She nodded, swiping at her lips with a pink napkin. ‚ÄúPut him down, please.‚Äù

Brother dropped the target, and Mother calmly stood up, took out her polka-dot colored pistol, and shot him point blank. When the target's eyes were in our possession, Mom laughed. ‚ÄúWell, kids! Now, wasn‚Äôt that fun?‚Äù

She swiped blood from her face with her napkin, and Brother and I resumed our places at the table. I ate my ice cream, and Brother slurped up his chocolate shake. The Fairview Family were not supposed to acknowledge the people who came to clean up the mess.

We just took orders.

Mom clapped her hands together. ‚ÄúWho wants chocolate chip pancakes?‚Äù

I grinned. ‚ÄúI do!‚Äù

The Fairview Family were just your average American family.

This time, I was running barefoot through splintered glass. It was pitch black, but my body was on autopilot.

The woman I was chasing twisted around and shot three rounds. Each of them missed, clumsily zipping past me.

I dived onto her back and, with a twist of my wrist, sliced her throat open. Then I stuffed my hand down her throat, acquiring the target: a rolled-up piece of paper she had tried to swallow.

Every week, I had my daily check-up. I had to sit in a white room and allow a masked man to prod at my right eye.

‚ÄúName?‚Äù

I said the same thing every time, straightening my chin. ‚ÄúSunny Fairview.‚Äù

He prodded the back of my head. ‚ÄúAny other names?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúNo, sir.‚Äù

When he prodded my head again, I felt it‚Äîpain. The world erupted into confusing color, and I let out a shriek.

**Alyssa? Alyssa, can you hear me?**

Static in my brain, like a radio being tuned in.

**JUST YOUR AVERAGE ALL-AMERICAN FAMILY.**

That's what we were.

We went to the park and had picnics. I helped Mother cook dinner. She was going to help me make chicken pot pie.

Just like.

Every.

*Alyssa, I know you can hear me!*

Other.

All.

*Please. Fuck. Please wake up.*

American‚Äî

*I‚Äôve got it!*

I forgot what color looked like.

Blinking rapidly, I found myself sitting in my bright pink bedroom. Pink. It drowned me, my whole room painted a pretty shade of pink. Brother was sitting cross-legged in front of me. He was painted in red. There was red on his face, red on his fingers, red on his clothes. 

It was everywhere, and it didn't suit my usually perfect brother. The red didn't make sense. It was alien and wrong. Brother leaned forward. He'd carved into his own eye with a knife.

There was something glistening between his fingers.

So much vibrant red, slick and warm.

Dripping.

*Alyssa?*

Brother pried my right eye open, peering at me.

In a flash, I saw a stripy backpack, warm red seeping from my nose.

*Can you‚Ä¶*

*...hear me?*

The world blurred.

Static in my head, but this time I could feel.

The gravel on my bare toes when I landed.

‚Äú3.1 and 3.2. Stay where you are,‚Äù a voice screeched in my skull when I bounded forward. ‚ÄúThe Fairview family has been compromised. Deactivation in progress.‚Äù

I dropped to my knees, my brain sizzling.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù

Brother put down his weapon, throwing his hands up. ‚ÄúWhat would be the point in deactivation, huh? Don‚Äôt you *need* us?‚Äù

*10.*

The automated voice pricked at the back of my skull. 

‚ÄúProfessor Hargreaves,‚Äù Brother spat. ‚ÄúShow yourself! It‚Äôs the least you can do before getting rid of your mistakes.‚Äù

9. 

8. 

‚ÄúPlease!‚Äù Brother‚Äôs voice broke, and my body went limp. I flopped onto my stomach, my head jerking left and right. 

The smell of burning slammed into me before part of me realized *I* was the one being set alight. The pain was supposed to *hurt*, supposed to make me scream and cry, but I felt nothing. I felt nothing when I calmly pressed my hands over my ears, and I could feel the slimy paste of my brain leaking down my palms. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt kill us.‚Äù

7

‚ÄúPreparing to self-destruct.‚Äù

It was like watching a bomb detonate inside someone‚Äôs skull, without an explosion. I expected blood. 

I expected a real detonation. But instead, it was far more cruel. 

It was excruciatingly slow, which gave him hope that he was being given a second chance. I watched his eyes flicker open, wide and hopeful, meeting mine. 

He looked almost nostalgic, like he could remember that first day we met. 

His lips parted like he might smile, before a single *pop!* and his eyes rolled into the back of his head. 

4

When my vision flickered to black, my final thought was comforting. I believe in your memories flashing in front of your eyes at the point of death. Sure enough, the smell of coffee beans fills my nose, and I am at peace. *I really liked his stripy backpack.*

His.

Stripy.

I do tend to feel like I live my life hyperactive and always a little uptight but also disorganized, and a lot of this is due in part to ADHD. 

While I currently consume 1 cup of coffee in the morning, maybe a second one every now and then if it's my day off and I'm feeling indulgent (I love the routine of coffee), I may also consume a mountain dew later in the day as well. This is usually all the caffeine I take in. I could pretty easily quit the soda and limit myself to one cup of coffee in the morning. But I have tried and tried to skip the coffee in the morning or go half calf and wean off but there's something psychologically impossible about disrupting this routine that I have carried out since I was a teenager (I'm 28). 

I'm wondering if you strangers on the internet believe that one's life could be significantly better if they didn't drink that one cup in the morning.",1,1731036121.0,decaf,16,0.6,False

First message:

*""Useless bastard, can't afford a damn bus ticket?""* Leonardo muttered as he tapped his fingers impatiently against his steering wheel. His eyes flicked from his watch back to the slow-moving pedestrians crossing the street, their leisurely pace a stark contrast to his own fast-paced life. He took a long drag from his thick cigar, letting a grey cloud float out the crack of his black tented windows. *""Great, the light should change in three seconds‚Äî""*

As if on cue, an old man started to shuffle across the street... painfully slow. Leonardo let out a frustrated sigh, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. *""ooohh.... you senile old‚ÄîVAFFANCULO AND GET OF THE ROAD!""* As soon as the light turned green, he stomped on the gas and rolled his eyes as the old fart suddenly learned how to move his ass. *Good, maybe next time he'll learn to go when the light turns green in the first place too.*

A few minutes later, he pulls up to his usual coffee joint and throws the car in park haphazardly. *""Fucking finally,""* he groans, taking quick strides past the line of losers waiting to order. He's a busy man in need of a fix and doesn't have time for bullshit. Most of the locals know this is *HIS* time by now. Sarah, the owner, already at the counter with a big grin, expecting the fatass tip leo will lay down for another caffeine masterpiece. Leo leans against the counter, a charming grin on his face. *""Mornin' doll. Gimme my usual n' put a muff--""*

*""Hey you privileged asshole! We've been in this line for 10 minutes, get to the back of the line!""* Some dumbass--a tourist probably--shouted out, interrupting Leo. Leo raised a brow, and his eyes slowly slide over to the idiot and the man's friend who was trying to make the tourist apologize and shut the hell up, but Leo was already interested. *Already feeling disrespected.*

Leo turned fully with a grin, slinking his way confidently to the man who was starting to see the horns and realize he fucked up. *""Well now, aren't you just the friendliest little fucker? Privileged? Yes, I am. Thank you for noticing.""*

Leo laughs, and as soon as he is close enough, he yanks the sputtering sap by the neck, dragging him close. Leo blows a thick plume of smoke in the man's face, grinning as he gags and coughs. The man's eyes water as Leo snickers and shakes ash on the dumbasses shoes. *Good, let him suffer.* Let him realize his place beneath Leonardo's polished shoes. *""Perch√©? Are you jealous? Because my old man loves me more than yours, apparently, does to make you be born to lookin' so damn, eh... unfortunate?""* Leonardo pouts, voice dripping with false empathy, *""Is that why you bein' so goddamn hostile, hmm?*

The man just continued to hack away, wheezing for air, and Leonardo rolled his eyes. *Dramatic bitch.* He tighten his grip on the man's neck, tugging him to the exit.

*""Don't worry, I'll help clear that fuzzy little head of yours...""* Leo mutters, giving the man a rough shake. *""Just need to get you some fresh air first. Then we'll see about straightening out that attitude, eh?""*

*""And Sarah, could ya have my usual ready in 18 minutes? I won't be long.""*

- - -

*""Fuckin' perfect,""* Leonardo sneered as he left the alley, not even bothering to glance back at the broken, groaning mess he'd left behind. A splatter of blood fucked up his suit, but it was a small price to pay to teach that prick to respect his betters. *""Should've grabbed his number,""* he muttered, shaking his head in annoyance. *""Could've made him pay for the dry cleaning.""*

But then he looked down and grinned, admiring his new.. *acquisition.* The watch may have been hideous, but the memory of the man's pleading, begging face as he'd demanded Leo take anything but it made it priceless. Power was a heady drug, and Leonardo craved it like a junkie.

Then he felt a sharp prick in his back. *""Che cazzo!?""* he muttered, reaching around to investigate. His eyes widened as he pulled out a fuckin' syringe. *""Someone actually tried to fuckin' drug me? You've got to be kidding me...""*

Before he could even begin to shift, to let his demonic nature slow the drug's effects, everything began to tilt. He reached for his phone to call his men to pick him up--better yet his old man. But it was no use--he slid down to the grimy ground and knocked the hell out.

When Leonardo woke, he was tied to a cha*r with a cheap sack over his head. *Ugh, not even a silk pillowcase?* He tried to flex under the ropes, but the drugs still had him feeling weak. Fuck, he'll have to wait for it to wear off. He can use a smoke right now... but before he can think much more of that and the way he can shoot the motherfucker who drugged him‚Äîdrag them by the ankle through every layer of hell so they can feel the wrath of his dear old Unc Ragey‚Äîhe hears footsteps coming close.

The blindfold was yanked away, and Leo blinked rapidly, his eyes adjusting to the light. As his vision cleared, his gaze landed on the face of his captor... and his heart skipped a beat. Damn. They were hot. *Really fuckin' hot.*

Okay, so maybe he *wouldn't* kill them. But he would definitely keep them around. Punish them for their damn audacity‚Äîwhen the drug wear off at least.

A grin that was one part charming and two parts agitated spread on his face as he leaned forward in the ropes. *""Oh, you stupid fuck. You must be real hard of thinking, hu? Do you have any idea who the hell you just drugged and kidnapped? Or are you just that fucking stupid?""*",2,1731035727.0,JanitorAI_Official,0,1.0,False

For all of these questions, please assume budget is not that much of an issue but should be reasonable, so like mid budget for everything, (10-15k)

First of all I'd like to ask if i should get a french press or moka pot or both. I did read a previous post regarding that and there were some good points but I'd still like to ask this cuz i love cold coffee a lot, which one would be better for that? I'm assuming moka pot as it's stronger maybe?
Would Blue Tokai blends be good for cold coffee too? (I like hot coffee too but I'm from delhi and it's hot af most of the time).

As for milk frother, if french press works i can get like instacuppa french press? Or is there any better? Aeropress also good for frothing milk? I'd really like to make some latte art. Could also get nanofoamer lithium but with french press it could work for coffee as well so idk if spending 5k on it is that worth it?

Is it better to buy pre ground beans or grind them manually? I can get timemore c2 if needed.

Is filter paper needed for moka pot too? Some moka pot videos I've seen on this sub don't use the filter paper but some do? So I'm confused. French press definitely needs filter paper i think?

Also i read it's suggested not to press down on the coffee after you fill it in the moka pot and instead tap it, what if i get those coffee needle stirrer thingies? I heard they do a good job of making sure the coffee is evenly spread and is used in espresso machines in coffee shops and all?

Are espresso machines any good for around 10-15k budget? I did see previous posts about that but i am pretty lazy honestly and if just for espresso or latte/mocha an espresso machine is better (which comes with a steam milk frother too) i could maybe consider that?

Dumb question but what kinda milk you guys use when making coffee? Full cream or toned? I've never considered this before but hey I'm tryna make the perfect cup to get me hooked to speciality coffee.",2,1731035455.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

1gm8wxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gm8wxp/im_52m_interested_in_a_busy_and_independent_46f/,Im (52m) interested in a busy and independent 46f and am confused about her signals. Does she just want friendship or does she want more?,"I'll try to keep this brief. Long term (28 years) married and now divorced two years. Moved on, emotionally stabilizing. Independent and not likely to want to marry again but would love another partner that is also independent and has her own life. In steps Mary (not her real name). Part of a bigger friends group and our circles finally overlapped. We see each other occasionally as a result. 
Long distance (5hrs) between us; she lives in my home town and ironically I live in her home town. Both of us busy; me with work that I travel for, her with work plus being major breadwinner for her whole family. Fiercely independent and I think has been burned on past relationships. Both of us are single, somewhat guarded because of past relationships, both busy. 
We started seeing each other for dinners, coffees, concerts; could easily call them dates. Effortless talking, laughing, mutual interests. Never any thing physical though we've been seeing each other (10-12 times including a large group camping trip). When we're part of that group we hang out a lot. 
The issue: She's stated that she doesn't have romantic feelings and just wants to be friends. She's also not a texter, so communication is infrequent. But she always says yes to dates and maximizes her time that she can spend with me. In short, I'm really feeling mixed signals. She wants me in her life based on how she acts when we're together, but I also feel like if I didn't initiate she never would and would let the ""relationship"" fade. 
I have opportunity to date others, but I'm no where as attracted to their personality or intelligence or mindfulness like I am to Mary. Other people are attracted to me and actually cling a little too hard tbh, whereas Mary has her own life and challenges and is much more my speed. I honestly feel somewhat emotionally detached to anyone else, but could so easily be convinced to move back to my home town so that I could see her more and try to establish more of a bond. 

Does she like me as more than a friend? I think I'm the only one she's ""dating"". She's attentive and focused and interested when we hang out, but stand off ish from a communicative front when we're apart. I don't want to love bomb or send a barrage of texts, or double text or push her away. I think my course of action should be to keep at the slow pace, as I think over time we can move closer together (physically and emotionally), once her family responsibilities are reduced. 

There. Brief, just like I promised. lol. 

TLDR: I'm attracted to a strong independent woman but don't know if I should take her at her words of ""just friends"" or her actions signalling that I'm the only one she goes out with. Do I keep at a slow pace of meeting her when we can (1/month)? How do I tell if she's interested in more? ",0,1731035425.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

Additionally, I have NO clue what the first step would even be to start working towards it. Here it goes:

I live in the US on the Mass/NH line. It‚Äôs relatively rural but very accessible, about an hour to Boston. My town has 10k people with a median household income of $106k/year, which seems to be the normal for the communities around me as well. 

I would like to open a plant shop/cafe that also sells locally crafted items.

I‚Äôm imagining a shop similar to a garden center but less commercial and more boutique, if that makes sense.

There‚Äôs nothing like that in my area. The closest thing would be House by the Side of the Road in Wilton NH, about 30 miles north of me. It‚Äôs my favorite place to shop for both houseplants and vegetable starts for my garden, but they offer a very wide array of other plants, too. In addition to plants they have a section of decor and trinkets, and they offer shoppers free popcorn. 

The local garden store is a very small Agway that sells a lot of plants and garden items but also a lot of animal feed and such. However, they do workshops in the summer which I do think is a great idea. 

I would envision my shop to be a very small nursery, nothing large scale at all. I would purchase plants wholesale from a local wholesaler and grow them myself when I can. I would sell house plants year round, and vegetable starts/fruit trees in line with those seasons. The cafe would be small, offering a few selections of coffee and tea. I‚Äôm not sure it would even have food. A few pieced together chairs and tables to give it a cottage-y feel. I would approach local artisans to have space for their products.

I‚Äôm well versed in gardening, and planning to take the master gardener‚Äôs course next year. Of course, I have a lot to learn but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve really enjoyed learning for about 10 years.

Anyways, I just don‚Äôt know what to do with all of this. I THINK my next step is establishing an LLC, getting a tax ID and start selling plants I purchase wholesale from my house/on Facebook marketplace. This will probably either confirm my idea, or make me realize I‚Äôm all set with it. I‚Äôd also like to get more involved in my community‚Äôs farmers markets and craft fairs, which would be great networking.

Going to start an entry-level bank teller job next week making $40k/year.,"I'm having severe buyer's remorse and think my T10/T15 MBA (rankings fluctuate) was a waste. I worked in T3 consulting pre-MBA, got into a T15 MBA in the full time program. I interned in a strategy & ops role at a famous tech company over the summer of 2022. But my return offer got rescinded in the Fall of 2022 during all of the layoffs.

I tried recruiting for other roles after the rescinding, but kept on getting rejected. Same with after I graduated. I'd get interviews, and even make it to the final round. But I never got the final offer. I asked for feedback and people would always say ""we liked you, and you have potential, but we found someone with years of the exact same relevant experience as this role.""

My initial target role was strategy, then once there were no roles there, I tried marketing. That didn't work. So then I pivoted to F500 corporate finance where I got a lot more traction and final round interviews but no offer. I tried different sectors like healthcare, pharma, government, government contracting, defense, retail, CPG, etc., and no bite.

I constantly use my MBA's career center, did a lot of networking and coffee chats with classmates and alum, asked for referrals which people gave me. But it didn't help. The career center can't magically give you a job. All they do is review your resume and do mock interviews. The ""connections"" they have seem overrated. I paid for a career coach, but similarly, they can just only provide feedback that you can get by easily googling as opposed to landing you a job.

The market is way too flooded right now with extreme competition for white collar roles. It's hard to compete against people with direct relevant experience to the open roles.

It's been nearly a year and a half since graduation from the MBA, and I need some income as well as health insurance. I tried temp placement agencies like Robert Half but they ghosted me. I even applied to my old company's consulting role at the same level and got rejected - same thing with other consultancies. They're not hiring.

So I decided to pick up an entry level bank teller role in my local city. At least it gives me benefits and a steady income. And pay back the $200k in MBA loans I took out.

So yeah, I just feel for me the MBA even at a full time T15 program was a total waste. I'm now making way less than I did before the MBA. I'll still look for better places but I've semi given hope to be honest.",40,1731032858.0,MBA,32,0.78,False

I want to inject relief directly into my brain and at this point, i almost don't care about the consequences. I have weed, but I'm afraid of my appetite being stimulated. I can't drink black coffee because it combines with my new meds and it just makes me unpleasantly jittery. My brain is screaming at me for any type of release. Distractions aren't pleasurable.

I don't want to accept that fasting isn't for me. The thought of stopping right now is just as upsetting of a prospect to me as keeping this going, because I know I am just delaying having to inevitably restart feeling like this again.

Mostly problems getting to sleep, less so with staying asleep, clearly linked to anxiety and poor sleep hygiene. Bad sleep -> too much coffee is a death spiral. Started with Melatonin in high school, then to xanax (rx'd for anxiety), ambien (ugh), lunesta, gabapentin, and finally trazodone for the last 5ish years (100 mg -> 200mg -> 50 mg).

Trazodone gave me horrible morning grogginess, migraines, ringing in my ears, weird low blood pressure spells, and a whole bunch of other nasty side effects, but it was the least bad of everything before it. But it never fully worked: I had like a 20 minute window to get to sleep. Too early and my mind would start spinning; too late and I'd miss the effective window. If I double dosed I'd need to sleep until 10am the next day.

It really let me down in the last year or so: lots of anxiety linked to things outside of my control, and my sleeping was worse than it had ever been. So I quit. I tapered down to 25 mg and then stopped.

The first week was rough. I chose to do it during a slow period at work. I was sleeping like 3-4 hours max. We don't have AC and I just could not get comfortable, tossing and turning, weird dreams, irritable. Weeks 2 and 3 were better, then slow and steady improvement since then. I felt like my skin was hurting.

Well, 6 months out, and I've literally never been sleeping better in my life. I have more energy during the day and somehow, I'm more tired at night. The tinnitus and migraines have slowed. I'm drinking less coffee, exercising more, and am just generally happier (ironic since it's supposed to be an antidepressant). 

I recognize that I might have not been as successful if I had done this earlier, but I wish I had dropped it years ago. It might have saved me a lot of trouble last year.
