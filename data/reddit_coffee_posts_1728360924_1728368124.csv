So, let me just start by saying, FUCK THESE RAT-TAILED, BUSHY-EARED, NUT-LOVING SQUIRRELS, MAN! I swear to the almighty Weapon X program that created my adamantium-laced bones and regenerative capabilities, if I see one more of these furry little shits pirouetting on my bird feeders like they're auditioning for Swan Lake, I'm gonna go full berserker mode and tear their fucking heads off like they owe me money!

Every goddamn morning, I wake up to the sound of their chittering, like a bunch of crack addicts fighting over a dropped quarter. They scurry around like they own the place, knocking over feeders, scaring the shit out of the birds, and basically throwing a rave in my fucking backyard. And let's not even talk about the mess they leave behind! It's like a fucking Jackson Pollock painting of birdseed and squirrel droppings.

I've tried so many goddamn methods to keep these tree-dwelling ninjas out. Squirrel-proof feeders? Pah! They laugh in the face of human engineering, climb up, and dismantle that shit like it's a toddler's Lego set. Greased poles? They slide down that shit with more grace than a figure skater on meth. And the fucking birdseed mazes? Oh, those are a real treat. They just sit there with their beady little eyes, twitching their tails, solving the puzzle like they're Einstein reborn in fur.

But here's what really grinds my gears: these squirrels have the audacity to look at me, like, ""Oh, what's up, Wolverine? You gonna do something about it?"" And I'm all, ""You bet your fuzzy ass I am!"" But what can I do? If I go full-on claw-popping, neighborhood watch is gonna think I'm auditioning for the next Saw movie. And let's not forget the damn animal rights activists who'd probably throw me a surprise party with a piñata filled with vegan meat substitutes and glitter glue.

I've tried talking to them, too. You know, man-to-squirrel. ""Look here, buddy, these birds are my friends. They don't deserve to be out-competed by a critter with more greed than a Wall Street banker."" But all they do is throw a nut at my head and scamper off like it's the funniest shit they've ever seen. It's like they're mocking me, the guy who can slice through a tank like it's a hot knife through butter.

And the birds, oh, the poor birds. They just sit there, looking at me with those sad, puppy dog eyes like, ""Yo, Wolverine, you're supposed to be the tough guy here. Why can't you protect us from these furry fuckwits?"" And I just wanna scream back, ""I'M TRYING, YOU FEATHERED IDIOTS! THESE SQUIRRELS ARE THE HANNIBAL LECTERS OF THE BACKYARD!""

But here's the kicker: I can't even catch the little fuckers. They're quicker than a greased-up Road Runner on a caffeine binge. The moment I lunge, they're gone, disappearing into the trees like ninjas in a smoke bomb explosion. And if I do manage to grab one, it's like wrestling a greased pig at the county fair. They're slippery, they're fast, and they've got teeth that could make a piranha jealous.

So, I'm left here, a man with unlimited rage and unbreakable bones, unable to do what I do best: fuck shit up. These squirrels are the bane of my existence, and I'd give anything to have a good old-fashioned claw-to-claw showdown. But alas, society frowns upon superheroes tearing apart small woodland creatures, no matter how much they deserve it.

So, if any of you Redditors out there have a foolproof plan to keep these furry thieves out of my bird feeders without breaking any laws or losing my tenant rights, I'm all fucking ears. Until then, I'll just keep watching from the sidelines, sipping my coffee, and fantasizing about turning my backyard into a squirrel-free kill zone. And maybe, just maybe, I'll catch one off guard and give it a little nip. Just enough to make it think twice before it tries to steal from the birds again.

6:50pm   
Monday, 7 October 2024

I have been sitting in the car in the same seat for a couple of hours. From what I remember I sat here at 3 or maybe 4, according to my parents maybe we will reach home at 12 but most probably we will reach much later.

Well I just created a reddit account 10mins ago. It was a rash decision (if that's the correct word used in this scenario). I don't have a clear idea why I created it, maybe I just wanted to write my current thoughts, maybe writing will somehow give me a better understanding on how to deal with my situation. What I do know is that I just want another point of view, I want to know how another person would react to this situation, what will be their solution, how will they deal with it.

I want to know what will you do if you are in my shoes



# Who am I

7:48pm   
Monday,7 October 2024

I plugged my phone for charging roamed around reddit for a bit kind of learned how it works, added a few things to my profile. I am still on the road in the same car though I've changed my seat.

After drinking some water and making a few decisions I have decided what to do with this account of mine. I will write about my situations, my opinions and you will give me your views That's how reddit works.. Right?

But before anything i guess you should know about me or at least what I think I am I am...

It has been 15mins but I can't answer that question I thought I would give you an introduction, say a few adjectives that describe me but for some reason I can't. The harder I try the blanker my mind gets.



# A false character

8:12pm   
Monday, 7october 2024

It is complete dark outside the stars are barley visible, I am reminded again that I will be reaching home soon. The stars shone brightly in the mountains unlike my home I could actually see them. Twinkling though the earth's atmosphere. Well at least the moon is here, though I guess it will disappear tomorrow though I am sure I will see it again soon

When I look outside the window I see vast farms so vast that I don't think it can be measured. I think these are wheat farms but due to the darkness and the nonstop moving of the car I can't really figure it out. At a distance though I see some lights maybe a small village

The GPS shows we will reach home around 1am but I am think we will reach much latter, I am hoping we will reach latter. Why you ask, because I don't want to go school tomorrow. I know I have missed a week of school already but I really don't want to I feel like the moment I enter the class they will look at me, question me, ask me if I am okay, or maybe they won't do anything..

I just can't get rid of this anxiousness this disgusting feeling that is eating me alive. Maybe it's due to this feeling or these rusty roads I feel like vomiting

I don't know when it started but at a point in my life I began lying not simple day to day lies but something more. I started to lie about myself I created somethings like a character. ""x"" is what I call it. X is quite different from my own self. It is quite good, always motivated, hardworking, quite disciplined, has friends and has quite a social life. Most importantly x has good grades

Around 4th grade I remember looking at my graded answer sheet I don't exactly remember with subject it was but I had passed I got 70-75 percent I guess. I didn't really think much of it until I talked to my friends they all had gotten more than 80 percent a few of them we even sad that they didn't reach 90 percent. Then they looked at me and asked ""you seem quite happy how much did you get?"" I don't know why but I the moment I said 95 percent That's how it all began.

Since then a lot has changed my friends are now different. My teachers are different not one thing remains the same except of my character x



# A false reality

2:08am   
Tuesday,8october 2024

The farms converted to outskirts and more and more lights we visible we took a break to have dinner, well I had a cold coffee and some fries so I don't think that's a proper dinner but for some reason I really didn't want to eat. We took takeout and sat again in the car. Now that we had dropped my uncle and aunt the car wasn't so cramped anymore the whole backseat was mine my legs could finally stretch. I was listening to some music and before I knew it I was asleep. I wake up to my mom calling me we reached home... We unloaded the luggage and got inside. My body hurts my legs feel like falling out and my whole body is cramped after making my bed I decided to take a bath. I don't know if it helped or not but at least I feel clean now. I am tired but I can sleep I guess really want to tire my body so that I don't have to got to school tomorrow or maybe it's the unanswered questions that keep me awake

Character x has become a part of me for the past few years it worked good my friends who are not friends anymore liked me. X is made of nothing but lies, x speaks nothing but lies. I really liked the sense of security it gave me I could just lie about anything through x. After lock down x started playing a bigger role in my life. I never had good grades Bs and Cs always an occasional D too but to my classmates I was a grade A student and they liked that about me. For the past two year this went on until a week ago...

I am now in 11th grade and the subjects are a lot more harder but if I want to pursue my dream I have to study them. We at the starting of the year I decided to become a straight A student for real but somewhere I stopped doing that I indulged back to my old habits. I know my teachers know about my situation, I know my parents know about it as well but my peers didn't and they always complimented me ""you are so smart"", ""dude you have to tell me how you study"". I surround myself with this, I created a false reality for myself....

A week ago my midterms got over my family had a trip planned the next week my aunts family was visiting so we decided to go to the hillside a road trip. I knew how I had done in my midterms, only one word to describe it terrible.

I didn't go to school on Monday cause we were supposed to get our answer sheets. I was trying to avoid it, maybe if I don't go to school today I won't see my answer sheets, after the trip I will and lie to everyone I will do better next time a line I always tell myself but never follow.

Well around 4 my friend texted me hey call me it's urgent. I called and he said ""dude are you okay we got our answer sheet the teachers announced all the marks you have failed in all your main subjects, you've got the lowest in class"" He tried to comfort me and say you will do better next time and he believed in me. He is the only friend I have right now or at least I think so. After hearing his words I cried I failed my midterm what if I fail my whole grade I would be required to repeat a year. My brain spiraled out of control. Before I knew it it was 6 my parents were about to reach home, my eyes were swollen, my face was red, I cleaned myself up and went downstairs after an hour of pondering and wandering my face was now normal I went back home didn't tell my parents anything. at night i couldn't sleep I was thinking what would everyone think of me and that's when it snapped to me

More than my grades more than anything else I was worried what would others think of me I had adjusted so well in my false reality that now that it's broken I don't understand anything I don't know what to do.....

On Tuesday I didn't go to school told mom nothing important was happening today and decided to pack for the trip. The day passed in a blink of an eye I don't remember what I did when my parents returned home I decided to tell my mom. She did not show it but I could tell she was crushed, worried about me and my future. We decided not to tell dad and went on the trip

character x showed up on the trip too. Not a spec of worry was shown on my face I was enjoy to the fullest but deep inside I felt like dying....

Now it's 2:55 I am laying in my bed writing this post I should be sleeping but I can't. I don't know what will happen tomorrow   
  
Good night

usually, the company only keeps the worker one month after he resigns but since I am one of the few who do any real work they might keep me longer

I'm a 28-year-old software engineer, based in Bengaluru, hoping to meet someone who values love, connection, and the beauty of shared moments.

While I spend a lot of time working in tech, it's what I do outside the office that really defines me. Fitness and nutrition have become more than just hobbies—they're passions. I love the science behind how the body works and I enjoy putting that into practice, whether I’m lifting weights or whipping up something healthy and delicious in the kitchen (I’ve been told I’m a pretty decent cook).

Music is another huge part of my life. Though I’m not a performer, I find a certain peace in singing slow, soulful music, especially rock and semi-classical. It’s not for an audience, just for me. It’s a way to unwind and reflect, something I cherish.

I’m endlessly curious about the world. Whether it’s tech, science, art, or just understanding the small wonders of everyday life, I’m always asking questions and seeking to learn more. I’m the kind of person who finds joy in discovery, and I’m looking for someone who shares that same excitement about life.

As for dating, I’m not here for games. I believe in love and the simple pleasures of spending quality time together. Whether it’s deep conversations over coffee or spontaneous adventures around the city, I’m looking for someone who’s equally ready to explore what dating and connection truly feel like.

We know it's spiritual warfare, but we also know it's based in reality too. Why do we separate the spiritual in the earthly because we do not understand either. We have all been lied to. We are all currently being lied to. Why do we believe anything we don't come to a conclusion with inside of ourselves external is false. Period period. Period.

We were given a first class ticket and no matter what we do the ticket is ours And nobody can take it away from us no matter how hard we try to give it away that's what makes us so special.

Next time you see one of those gang stalkers ask them if you can give them a hug buy them a cup of coffee. Their road is so much harder than ours and they'll have to walk it for eternity.

We are in our mid 20s f/m relationship.

We have been together for 6 years. Throughout the relationship I have grown into my own person finishing college, getting a good job the whole shabang. He on the other hand… has not even scratched the surface of being able to sustain himself. 

Here’s a few problems and a few situations:

1. I’ve been rethinking the relationship because of my family. I know they want what’s best for me so I understand where they are coming from. Their advice is to find someone who can help and support me financially. Someone that is near or on equal footing with myself. The more I pay for our lunches/ dinners/ excursions the more I start to feel a type of way. Like why should I pay for all of this for us? (Before I had no issue cause I did like to spoil him a bit, now it’s getting kinda old and I too would like to be spoiled) 

2. We are raised basically totally opposite. I know if I’m going to an event or somewhere nice that I also need to “look the part”. I know how to dress up for the occasion. He on the other hand does not. He doesn’t put effort in his looks. And it’s not like he doesn’t have the clothes because he’s been supplied with them for literally the past 6 years by me and my family (I have to convince him to let me do his hair so it looks kept) I feel like I have to beg for him to dress decently.

3. Again with the no effort…he doesn’t try to plan dates whatsoever. I’ve showed him free to cheap and affordable date plans and yet, there’s no effort to plan and take me out. EVER. I would be happy with something as simple as little picnic or making dinner together. But no, nothing. Then when I express this want his go to is “it’s too expensive, I don’t have money” even AFTER showing him free things to do. (Theres free entry to parks and museums that we can go to)  

Adding to this, he has been wanting to purpose. The problem is not only did he have me pick out my own ring but he also asked how he should do the 
proposal.  Once again I gave him cheap and doable ideas such as getting some flowers and making a wooden sign at the beach or something. (You can get the material at Walmart and homedepot) or in a park. (Just need the ring). Afterwards he looked at some of the inspo pics I have sent him and saw some random price of $100- $250 dollar for some particular setup fee at the beach. Then told me, “what you want and how you want it done is too expensive”. For some reason he refused to ask my best friend for help in planning. Tbh I don’t think he’s even given it any thought since the last time we spoke about it. 

4. The kicker of all of this, he likes to buy sell and trade vehicles and he does work (on his own time). It’s not like he has no money just not what I make.

5. I feel lots of frustration and jealousy towards my coworkers and friends. We are all at a point in life where a bunch of people are getting married. I work in a male dominated environment so most of my coworkers are dudes. Im excited to be apart of their conversations especially when it they express how much the love and appreciate their partners. I always envisioned that how my boyfriend will talk about me. (I’m pretty sure this isn’t the case though) I get jealous when I hear them and their excitement of how they are designing rings and explaining how their going to purpose. One guy purposed and really made it magical for her. He knows she loves Disney so why not give her a whimsical proposal. He even went ahead and paid for a local photographer to capture the moment as well. (Btw the pics and everything was amazing). Why can’t I have that?

6. In my boyfriend’s previous relationship he’s paid ungodly amounts of money for stage tickets for his last girlfriend and his best friend and then some. Spending 1000s. For me it’s seems as though the most he can do is sometimes pay for my coffee and sometimes a meal or 2. 

7. I’ve been feeling used. Like I’m someone to keep the bed warm and someone dumb enough to pay for all his shit. We’ve had now 3 or so conversations within the past year about our relationship and how I’m feeling about it. Even brought up about taking a break from each other (which he rejected). After each talk he does put in more effort but after about 2 months it’s back to the same shit. 

Some extra context:
Yes he is depressed but I am as well. Yes people handle things differently. His love language is physical touch. (I don’t like being touched but for his sake I let him). Mine? I have no clue. I haven’t left because dare I say we are trauma bonded. He’s also going through a difficult time in life with his family. I never want to see him in pain and struggle when I have the means to help. But we are getting to a point when I am started to feel used and it feels like things are going in one ear and out the other for him. 


I love him very much. And I know he seems like he loves me to others. But when the actions ^ above are on display it definitely feels like he doesn’t. No the bad doesn’t put weight good entirely. He helps my family grandparents parents and brothers in many ways. He helps out my family friends and close friends. He can be very selfless to others that are not his family. 

I don’t know, maybe I’m thinking too negatively on this. 

Should I stay? Should I leave? Another talk? Like what do I do?

TLDR; I feel like I’m being used and that even though hey may love me. We are in two places of life. Should I stay? ",1,1728364369.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1fysakl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1fysakl/365_days/,365 days,"This hour marks exactly one year since I decided to quit drinking. 

When I started the clock, I didn’t know how long I’d make it or how tough it would be, but I knew how miserable and depressed my life had become. I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.

A year ago today, I woke up on the floor of my apartment, with the front door wide open, all the lights on, piss in my pants and a cracked phone screen in my pocket. There was an empty pack of cigarettes on my coffee table that I didn’t remember buying. There were about 14 hours of my life I couldn’t account for. I felt lucky to be safe at home in my apartment, not asleep on the street or having injured myself or anyone else. I still think about this moment, and countless others where getting too drunk that could’ve ended much worse for me if my friends weren’t looking out for me, or just out of sheer luck. I feel like I’ve been pressing my luck, and have drank enough for several lifetimes, not just my own. 

In the past year, I’ve changed careers and ended toxic friendships. I’ve built new friendships and strengthened my relationships with family and close friends who have always been in my corner. I attended weddings, major social events, bachelor parties, poker nights, golf outings and countless other events I used to associated with alcohol. I figured out how to be myself without the crippling need to soak my social anxiety in booze until I didn’t feel ugly or uncomfortable in my own skin anymore. 

I played guitar and sang a two hour set at a  friend’s wedding in front of a majority of my high school classmates, some whom I hadn’t seen in 15 years. I participated in an outpatient program for adults with depression, and attended AA meetings as well as other group counseling sessions. I dealt with suicidal thinking, and crippling depression, both which were pretty new to me having never faced them head on. I talked to my family members, who saved my life. I saw a therapist regularly and took antidepressants for the first time. I met incredible people, and connected with old friends who I’d lost contact with out of shame.  I started to love myself again. 

I try not to get stuck in the vanity of telling people I’m sober, because frankly it was embarrassing at times to explain to people who didn’t understand why I needed to change. Often I like to joke and say I “hung up the jersey” and “I was so good at it, I had to retire”. Some get it, others don’t and that’s ok.  It’s something that’s so uniquely personal for everyone, I find I can’t often explain it in a way that makes sense to them, because I didn’t do it for them. I did it for me. 

I struggle with the idea of being sober forever. It makes me feel like such a broken person. Like I can’t enjoy that part of life because I fucked something up. 
On the outside, I wasn’t defined as a problem drinker, but on the inside I knew that my drinking was a problem. I was slowly killing myself, and I wanted my life back. I wanted to like who I saw in the mirror again - today I’m a lot closer to that. There’s still lots of improvements to my life I can make. But today, I love myself, something I couldn’t say a year ago, and for that I am truly grateful. 

Thank you to the many stories I’ve read in this amazing community, and all of the incredible, anonymous support this group provides - I know that my journey would’ve looked a lot different without it. And that Journey is just beginning!

So I randomly added this girl on Snapchat that I thought was cute because we went to the same high school and had mutual friends.

I asked her and she said I don’t even know your name, who you are, or what you look like. I gave her my name, said we went to the same school, had some mutual friends and that I thought she was cute. I snapped her a picture of myself and asked if she was free that Thursday, which she said yes. We scheduled a date at a local sushi place and we talked a bit over snap before the date.

Date comes and she ghosts me when I ask if we’re still on morning of. About a week later my friend has a fire and I ended up drinking a little bit and send her a snap mogging her over the fire with the caption “sushi tomorrow? 🧏🏼‍♂️🧏🏼‍♂️” which actually does get a response for some reason.

She said no and that she was sorry for ghosting me and she was just getting over a break up and she thought she was ready for another relationship, but she wasn’t.

I said I understood and thanked her for responding because I had never spoken to someone in a romantic context before and had been overthinking every interaction we had trying to figure out what I did wrong. She responded asking “never?” And thanking me for understanding.

I was a little fucked up and trauma dumped saying some shit along the lines of “nah never. I have awful self esteem and my parents drilled into my head that I was a worthless failure and a disappointment and I never really recovered, I find it hard to see myself as somebody who somebody could be in a relationship with so I’ve never talked to someone in a romantic context before.” Then I apologized for trauma dumping because I didn’t realize how much I had typed lol. I cringed a little bit writing that out.

She responded sympathizing with me and I thanked her and that concluded our last interaction, 2 weeks ago.

Honestly, I don’t know her at all outside of these interactions and kinda want to ask if she’d be down to get sushi/coffee with me (for the third time, lol) but idk if enough time has passed? I don’t have anything to lose and she hasn’t unfriended me or anything. Is it too soon?

TLDR I got ghosted, snapped her later asking her out again, she apologized and said no she wasn’t ready to get into a relationship because she had just gotten out of a relationship, how long should I wait before asking her a third time?

We got introduced during a coffee break of a conference to which I was invited by a unit leader in the department who previously interviewed me for a role I eventually didn't get selected for. She wanted to encourage me to apply again for another role, a better one for that matter. It was the first time I networked with people I completely didn't know, and I was really surprised to talk with her boss. So, I started rumbling about where I studied and that I applied unsuccessfully to a role with them and I was all over the place. It was kind of awkward and he seemed confused. Then we had to go back to the conference. I tried talking to him again on another chance during another coffee break where he was with his colleague and I apologized for the awkward inteoduction because I didn't know what to say. To make things worse, I interrupted their conversation and didn't ask them about anything we could talk about without all this weirdness.

I gotta say I'm really disappointed in my performance at this opportunity because it was really awkward and I don't think I left a good impression. I'm 24 (M) and I struggle with leaving an impression of respect with people 'in power'. I think I give off too honest, chaotic and too young vibes.

I want to apply to another role in another department now. I really hope I didn't hinder my chances with the organization.

In late 1979 - mid 1980 I needed to make some money after graduating from university.  I took a job driving a taxi for Surdell cabs for about 6 months.  I drove 12 hour shifts, from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. the next morning, often 7 days per week, which is what one to do in order to earn a half-decent paycheque.  In those days, I believe The Roundup was open 24hrs. per day.  I’d often stop in there for coffee and a meal about 04:00 a.m., once the ‘bar-rush-home’ ended. 
   My friend, Chris Weigel, a Ryerson-Educated professional photographer, set up his tripod on the sidewalk across from
The Roundup and did a timed-exposure of me standing in front of my taxi, a 1973 Chrevrolet Caprice hardtop, which was and still is one of the best, smoothest riding and powerful cabs ever painted yellow. 
   I had to stand absolutely still for about a minute and a half which Chris moved across the full panorama of the street scene with his flash-unit. 
    It was cool to be a participant in his project and it’s still cool to look at this picture now, some 44 years on.

1fys0fg,https://i.redd.it/ksc26242rgtd1.jpeg,One Among Many: The Despicable Deskbound Perpetrator Maurice Papon,"In the murky depths of history, figures lurk whose names are virtually unknown to the public, yet their actions have left an indelible mark of destruction. One such monstrous man is Maurice Papon. Not as a frontline actor in a brutal battle or as a cold-blooded assassin, but as the type of person who committed his crimes in a suit and tie, with pen and stamp - a deskbound perpetrator. That sounds so innocent, doesn't it? Almost as if he just spilled too much coffee. The reality is, of course, much darker, more sinister, and downright evil.

Who was Maurice Papon?

Maurice Papon, born in 1910, was a French politician and senior official whose career, at first glance, is typical of France's elite. He climbed the ranks of the administration, proved himself a cunning puppet master, and wormed his way into high positions. He was a prime example of the successful bureaucrat. However, there is that one tiny, grotesque catch: He played a pivotal role in the deportation of thousands of Jewish men, women, and children during World War II. Yes, we are talking about deportations to extermination camps, places of unimaginable horror and suffering.

The Desk and Deportation

Papon was General Secretary of the Prefecture of Bordeaux during the Nazi occupation of France - a position that gave him significant power over the fate of the local population. So, what did he do with this power? Well, he helped diligently in issuing deportation orders, acting as a willing cog in the Nazi machinery of death. Between 1942 and 1944, about 1,600 Jews were deported from his region to Auschwitz, a place synonymous with the depths of human depravity. Many of them were never seen again, their lives snuffed out in the most brutal and dehumanizing manner. And all this because Papon sat at his desk, filled out forms, and stamped papers, playing his part in this genocidal endeavor with bureaucratic precision.

Career after the War - Just Carry On

You might be thinking now: ""Well, that's it for Papon, right?"" Wrong. After the war, he lived a largely undisturbed life. Not only was he successful, but he also held high offices, including that of Police Prefect of Paris in the 1960s. He was involved again during the bloody confrontations with Algerian demonstrators in 1961, in which many people died. One could say that Papon had a knack for the darker, more ruthless aspects of the apparatus of power.

That his past as a collaborator and person responsible for deportations remained undiscovered for decades is almost a sickening testament to how well the cloaks of bureaucracy work. It was not until 1981 that he was charged with his actions during the war, and even then it took until 1998 before he was finally convicted of his crimes. But here's the kicker: He spent only three years in prison before being released due to alleged poor health. One could cynically say that this was another deskbound error, a testament to the failures of the justice system in addressing the horrors of the Holocaust.

Why Should We Remember Papon?

Maurice Papon is not an isolated case. He symbolizes the many people in positions of power who hide behind piles of documents while their decisions destroy lives. It is convenient to attribute such actions to the anonymous ""system,"" but ultimately it is always people who serve this system. People like Papon, who deny their responsibility for the fate of others in the engine rooms of bureaucracy, are a stark reminder of the banality of evil.

While Papon may not be the loudest name in history books, his story represents an important chapter: that deskbound perpetrators can be just as dangerous, if not more so, as those who actually carry the weapons. It shows that the true criminals are often those who operate in the shadow of power, with a friendly smile and a signature here and there, their actions leading to untold suffering and loss of life.",1,1728363165.0,Megasnailz_AI,0,1.0,False
1fyrzit,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMyers/comments/1fyrzit/prepthings_to_do_before_the_hurricane_hits/,Prep-Things to do before the hurricane hits,"Lots of us are staying. We went thru Ian and ate using that as a decision basis.  So here are some tips for those who are going thru this for the first time.  Feel free to add additional tips in the comments!  Most of my prep is based on what we went thru with Ian

Electric- is going to go out. For how long is the issue.  We were out for a little over a week, so we've got a generator and 5 cans. We'll drive east to get more when we run low but this will get us thru till then.  Also, AEP had already sent lineman to staging locations, so they're ready to help. Have enough extention cord and surg protectors for what your plugging in.  No generator,  you can go to shelters
 Hertz arena should be available as well and you can charge things there and get a meal.  Also charge everything tomorrow.  Headphones,  ear buds, battery banks, toothbrush,  what ever you can. 



Propane- have a few tanks so you can grill.  That's a game change after the storm!

Pool- if you have one,  make sure you have the chemicals you need and a good net or sweeper so you can get it cleaned up and enjoy it after the storm

Tarps- have a few.  You can use them for your roof ,or a broken windows,  or to drag debris. Lots of uses. 

Tools- make sure all batteries are charged. Have some extra plywood, screws,  2x4s.

Wash- wash everything tomorrow. Bedding,  towels,  clothes, dishes.   Also, paper plates and solo cups should be ready!

Windows- if you haven't already covered them,  head to home depot.  Usually by now the rush is over.  They can even help you cut them the size you need, so measure your windows and head that way.  Back to lights,  it'll be dark in your house so have battery lighting.  One for each person or in each room. 

Air- its gonna be hot.  We got a few more fans and a tiny window a/c.  Any breeze is going to help. 

Food- we got a small counter microwave.  So we set it up by the coffee maker.   We get about 4 pizza so we have quick food.  Throw  it in baggies in the fridge.    Get a cooler with some drinks and lunch meat to make a quick sandwich so you don't need to open the fridge when the power goes out but the storms still going on
 Remember,  you can't get out to get the generator going till it's safe.  GET A RAINCOAT.  Boots are really good too. 

Tv- we lost internet for 2 weeks with Ian.   Will be getting a starlink. But for now,  we have an old Blu-ray and lots of movies.   Stocked up on puzzles, board games,  cards,  you get it. 

Water- don't freak out but be ready.  We never lost water, we're on city.  Yes you had to boil.  So you can shower.  A couple cases and a few gallons was plenty. Have a couple bottles by each sink.  We got a cheap counter ice maker,  because once it hits you can't use the fridge ice till the boil is over and it's cleaned. 

Yard- get it cleared!  Everything that can go in, need to go in, or it's gonna be gone!  Have trash bags,  work gloves, rakes,  leaf blower, chainsaw if you have one.  You'll want these for clean up. 

Bleach- yep a jug goes a long way.  It's old school, but does great to make sure the mold and bacteria stays away.  

Animals- just make sure they have enough food for a few weeks.  We cut a pice of turf to fit our walk in shower floor.  During Ian, we took them in every few hours to potty then just rinsed  it down.  Worked great.  Added cbd treats for dogs for this year.  

Lots more but these are a great start.  Stay safe!

Vivian greeted them with a cup of coffee and engaged them in a discussion about how dogs are better than donkeys. Shrutika also joined the discussion slowing down the space time continuum and by the time Vivian's monologue ended the peta guys were tired and decided to spend the night in BB house 😐

Late at night they woke up to Dallu staring at them in a creepy horrifying way 🤦‍♂️

In the morning Shehzad prepare coffee for them and when one of the peta guys refused the drink, Shehzad said ""ohh tumhare yaha tea plantations hain. Tum log to bas chai peete hoge 🤡""

Then the peta guys started rescuing the donkey but got stuck in the donkey cage. Nyra came to their rescue and she used water as a lubricant to detach them 😐

Finally they took the donkey outside the house.

An hour later housemates noticed that the dhenchu sound was still coming from the garden. To their surprise they found out that the peta had mistaken Shehzad for Gadharaj. The housemates agreed it was a close call and Chum fed Gadhraj Shehzads share of the food. 😎

I'm wondering if anybody else has had similar experiences, where they lost any cravings at all?

I sure didn't expect that.  In fact, I'm also trying to avoid eating fast food, as their main beverage choices are pretty much soda pop, juice, smoothies, or shakes, unless you want to drink coffee or tea.  I make homemade iced coffee with way less sugar in it.  Even less than half that goes in Kool-Aid.

# Project “Scarecrow”. True Ongoing Story

*This is not my usual type of post, but I decided to publish this one, remembering a time when I received a call from someone I know from that building, feeling lost and confused, forced to spend the night outside as a form of “punishment.” And this happened now, our time in Europe, Netherlands. That incident resonated with me this time. So I publish it, free of charge.*

There is a story unfolding in Deventer, at Munsterstraat 3, 7418EV, Netherlands.

It’s not on the news, and it’s something you may not be aware of, even if you live close to that building. It’s local, it is personal, but its impact could stretch far.

This small post offers a glimpse into just how vulnerable Ukrainian refugees are in this country.

One of these refugees has faced prolonged injustice and harassment from the location manager, Nadia Smythe (name changed for now, also referred to as “the scarecrow” by those who know her).

What started as small issues soon escalated into an unbearable situation. Nadia Smythe torments the refugees, pitting them against one another, and seems to take pleasure in their suffering. She feeds off their anxiety and tears. There’s no support for integration, only constant obstacles placed in their way.

>Smythe demanded cash payments from the refugees to cover cleaning services, even though the city authorities already provided for this. In the location where 80 people live, each refugee was forced to contribute euros in cash. At neighboring locations housing 300 people, the same demands were made. Smythe refuses to accept bank transfers, raising suspicions of money laundering.

If a refugee refused to pay in cash, they risked being evicted onto the street. Some were left homeless for a week. In one case, a refugee was accused of smoking cannabis, but a medical test confirmed no drug use. Smythe ignored the results.

>Smythe also engaged in questionable practices, such as reselling bicycles at inflated prices (of the the themes). The money was supposedly for improving living conditions, like buying coffee machines or washing machines, but the refugees never saw any of these items.

In another case, Smythe took a refugee’s dog and kept it for three days without feeding it. Then, she forced the dog’s owner to move into a room with other refugees, one of whom has asthma and couldn’t breathe around animals. Smythe does not care.

Smythe imposes a curfew on some refuges, forbidding them from leaving the room after 10:00 PM, even for essential needs.

For six months, refugees have endured these conditions. By now, conversations have been recorded, videos have been taken, and evidence has been gathered, building a case against her. However, the refugees don’t know who to turn to or where to go. The police don’t seem to be the authority in this situation.

>The system in Deventer seemed to protect Smythe. Even the police couldn’t bring justice. Some suspect Smythe has connections with local authorities, shielding her actions and possibly tying her to corruption schemes.

,some refugees report that, who can not bear this situation, anymore.

The atmosphere in this place has become reminiscent of a dark period in history, where human rights violations were ignored until they escalated out of control. If these issues continue to go unchecked, the situation will only worsen, refugees in that location believe.

From some stories, that could be combined to the negative that could go way beyond this post:

>Refugees are constantly monitored by security, who track their every move. One day, when a girl went to move some belongings, a security guard followed her down the street to see where she was going and which car she got into.

Or:

>Recently, a family arrived — a mother, two sons, a cat, and a tomcat. Smythe split them up, placing the mother in one room and the sons in another. Now, the cats howl, while the boys share a room with two strangers.

Another one reported:

>Four people crammed into one room. It’s absurd how families are torn apart and shuffled around like objects at Smythe’s whim. It feels inhumane.

>At one point, a security guard even peered into the refugees’ cups as they sat on the terrace, adding to the ridiculous surveillance.

>Smythe shows no concern for keeping families together.

>It's clear something is wrong with her—she needs psychiatric treatment. She is clearly unfit to deal with people and seems unstoppable in her quest to build her distorted empire.

The list of quotes goes on and on.

It is not easy. Most refugees are afraid, not knowing how to act. They pay those bribes, not to be thrown outside. They do not know many are involved in these schemes.

Now, it seems like a local journalist has stepped forward, ready to share these stories across the Netherlands. The refugees have provided video recordings, where several of them speak about their suffering and how Nadia Smythe torments them. Every has a story. This could be the turning point in their fight for justice. There is a hope.

While searching for a lawyer may seem like a good idea, it would cost at least 300 euros per hour, and they simply don’t have that kind of money. They’re also unsure if they even have any legal rights in this situation. This plan feels more like a distant hope. For now, they continue gathering evidence, hoping that media attention will help expose Smythe’s actions and remove her from her position.

However, the issue is far more severe than it might seem. When corruption spreads among the police and local authorities, it reaches a point where corruption becomes the norm, and these cases are swept under the rug.

In this video, a Ukrainian refugee who refused to pay a bribe in cash was forcibly removed by local authorities. Using Google Translate, she explained the situation in detail, but they literally pushed her out:

In such an environment, the abuses not only go unchecked but are quietly accepted, creating a vicious cycle where justice seems unattainable, and the system itself protects those who manipulate it for personal gain.

[The office buildings have been converted into shelters.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TYoYmsjeCR9f4Npd9)

As I learn about this story and its details, it reminds me of that fiction book *The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo*. Just like in the novel, where corruption, abuse of power, and hidden agendas are intricately woven into the fabric of society. Here, too, it feels like that refugee and the other refugees are caught in a web of deceit and manipulation. The figure of Nadia Smythe — or as they privately call her, *the scarecrow* — looms large, symbolizing not just one individual’s cruelty, but a much larger, more sinister system that allows such abuses to flourish unchecked.

That refugee’s situation seems strikingly similar: vulnerable individuals fighting against a seemingly impenetrable wall of corruption and intimidation. The difference is, the Ukrainian refugee doesn’t have a hacker heroine to unravel the lies for her — she and her companions must rely on each other, their persistence, and the hope that shedding light on these injustices will make a difference.

If you are in Deventer and have the ability to help, if you want to save your country and bring those who deserve to justice, now is the time to act. Are you a lawyer? A reporter? You have the address, and you know the situation. Consider opening a case titled “The Scarecrow.”

1fyrljg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/1fyrljg/some_finance_advice_i_shared_with_a_freshman_that/,Some finance advice I shared with a freshman that I wish I had known and think others could benefit from,"For finance, it's highly competitive, so the sooner you start the less stressful and the greater your odds are. I would start doing some career exploration from now to figure out what you want to do. By the time you get to your junior year, options will slim down due to competitiveness. 

(1) Go talk to your career counselor. They can be hit or miss, but from my understanding McCombs has the best resources. 

(2) JOIN ORGS. I cannot stress this enough. Orgs are the best way to learn hands on what you're good at and are super helpful for your resume. You'll find that it's much easier to prepare for interviews when you have actual experience. 

(3) Go to coffee chats with a curious mind. Don't look at them as just a way to get in at a company or org, but genuinely try to get to know the person in front of you. Do you like what they’re presenting? Do their values align with your own? Could you see yourself being friends or acquaintances with them? Questions like these will help guide you to a career that’s right for you. I've learned so much from these coffee chats and gained a lot of different perspectives. Also, you'll leave a much better impression this way--people love to talk about themselves. 

(4) Go to on campus recruiting events, even as a freshman. Get comfortable with them from now so that when it comes time to recruit you'll be good to go. 

(5) If you're a minority, diversity summits, diversity summits, diversity summits. Take advantage of it now because it seems with recent DEI changes, this is something companies might start phasing out. 

(6) Try to land an internship for next summer, but if you can't it's ok. Do keep your summer busy. There are many online programs for people in finance that are helpful such as the headstart program. Extern is also a great site for mini internships that are remote (some also give you a little stipend). SEO is a great one. If you’re a girl look at Forte and Girls who Invest.

(7) I know I threw A LOT of information at you, but do remember to take care of yourself. Your career is important but college is the best time to find out more about who you are as a person. Do get a head start and look around, but also don't get too wrapped up in the finance bubble. Find what you truly like. Do not choose a career in finance just because others are telling you to. IB is a great career starter, HOWEVER, it will suck the life out of you--you've gotta like it for more than just the money. Money is important, but it's not everything. 

(8) Ok continuing, if you are looking at IB, you need to start from now. You go to a good school, but you're not at an IVY. There's a post somewhere in this sub that gives advice on this. I'm not in IB so I won't be much help. 

(9) Leverage your network. Get comfortable with cold emailing/messaging on linkedin. Referrals will help you greatly.

(10) McCombs students are very competitive, so you won’t get much assistance from people in your grade level. Talk to upperclassmen and alumni in the field who don’t see you as competition lol. They’ll be more willing to help you out. The information will not come to you, you have to seek it out.

(11) Don’t underestimate yourself. This is where I went wrong. I didn’t think I was good enough so I didn’t try altogether my first two years. Comparison is the thief of joy. You will go on linkedin and see that some of your peers managed to land an internship at their infantile age, or you’ll see all the outlandish accomplishments that you can’t comprehend how they managed to do. Be careful. It is easy to fall into a trap of jealousy and self loathing. Don’t do that, celebrate your peers, but also celebrate yourself. Be prepared to face rejection but do not stay down. Ask for feedback. If you were rejected, ask why, find out what you can do to be a stronger candidate the next time around. This is good for life in general. You’re gonna start having to put yourself out there and you’ll find that you aren’t the best at everything and you don’t know a lot of things. Welcome the struggle with open arms, it’s the best way to grow as a person.

I do want to reiterate--high finance isn't your only option. Do lots of career exploration :)

I know I need to paint  the walls. Want to get a new sofa and love seat with a table/coffee table. I have two dogs so white is not an option. Those are the only two sources of natural light so it’s a bit darker than I’d like. 

Need help with couch/rug/table/wall colors and designs thanks!",6,1728361438.0,interiordecorating,9,1.0,False
