I am an absolute beginner but I'm trying to be my friends' best home barista ahah

Now, here's my problem : for a few days i've been attempting to make a rosetta but when I pour my milk closer to the cup, the milk is not pushed or moving forward and so I can't begin to jiggle my milk jug (no pun intended)... 

Here is my walkthrough :  
1. My espresso seems alright, the crema is quite thin but it's alright, it works well enough when I pour a tulip, even tho my circles are not big enough, due to this lack of motion in the cup...  
2. Milk texture seems alright too, I use Oatly barista edition, works well anough too for small tulips...  
3. I break the crema by making round moves with the cup and giving it a bit of motion  
4. I tap the milk jug to remove any air bubbles and I swirl it too  
5. I start pouring in circle from ""far"" above the cup, the milk mixes with the crema  
6. When the cup is 3/4 full, I stop pouring, then I bring the jug closer to the coffee, and there: ""nothing""... The microfoam appears, but it doesn't move, it just stays in place and I can't do anything...

What do I do wrong, do you guys have some advice for me?

Thank you very much!",1,1737367781.0,latteart,0,1.0,False

1i5myzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teethgumhealth/comments/1i5myzh/laser_teeth_whitening_pros_and_cons/,laser teeth whitening pros and cons?,"Laser teeth whitening is a cosmetic dental procedure that uses concentrated light to enhance the whitening effects of a bleaching agent applied to the teeth. It is a fast and effective way to achieve a brighter smile, but it comes with both benefits and drawbacks.

**Pros**: Laser teeth whitening provides immediate results, often lightening teeth by several shades in a single session. It is highly effective at removing deep stains caused by coffee, tea, or tobacco. The procedure is safe when performed by a professional and tailored to individual needs.

**Cons**: The procedure can be costly compared to other whitening methods. Some people may experience temporary sensitivity or gum irritation following treatment. Results are not permanent and require maintenance to retain brightness.

I got broken up with over text. ""I'm sorry I don't want to continue dating anymore."" I called, called, called again. Texted, texted, texted again. Told her I'd come over if she didn't phone me. I knocked on her door, her patio door, her window... called, texted... she called the cops on me. Like... wtf??

""Please leave me alone."" Is the only other text she wrote me.

We met on Bumble before New Year's, had awesome dates, spent NYE together. Made it official on 1/6. Her 33F, me 44M. Pretty much vibed on everything together. Communication was great until tonight. Sex was great. Lots of affection. Aligned great with relationship goals, having kids goals... pretty much everything we talked about! Have spent the night at each other's places. Just last night she was at my place. We had a ""work date"" where we went to a coffee shop to each work on our laptops. Then we had some time trying out instruments together, then I made her dinner... we showered together then had sexy time for over an hour, made out, cuddled, pillow talked and fell asleep in each other's arms. 

She did say she was feeling sad after we had sex. I asked her why and she said it was maybe hormonal imbalance from having took Plan B cause even tho she is on BC she is paranoid about getting pregnant. I told her that if there was an accident I would be there with her to have the child with her if she wanted. I very much meant that. 

Next day we had breakfast together, more sex, at first no condom, then with a condom because we have yet to orgasm together at the sametime. She orgasms multiple times but I need to put effort in to concentrating on myself to finish. Unfortunately I couldn't orgasm with the condom on and she didn't put in much effort to finish me so we just stopped. 

After sex she gets ready to leave fairly quickly and abruptly. She was anxious about her cat not being fed, also she said she was anxious about not feeling like her career is where she wants it to be. We also discussed me coming over to her place cause tomorrow (today 1.20) is a holiday. 

I did feel like something was off with her tho, and she has told me she feels like sometimes she has a hard time to tell me things for fear of judgement or I'll be upset, which has yet to happen (until today)... and that I can be intense, but in a good way. Knowing these things, and a general vibe I got from her, I said over text ""Maybe we should slow things down."" My intention was to give her the comfort to have a discussion with me because each time she stays at my place she says she needs to go back home to have personal space. Which is fine... but the way she words it sometimes didn't make me feel very secure with the relationship.

After I sent the text. No response. I call her later in the day after visiting my fam, no pick up. Call 2 more times a couple hours later and she sends me the break up text.

Wtf happened? Did I fuck up with my text :( ?? After all we've shared with each other about how people have hurt us in the past, wtf did she just fucking text me a one line breakup, no call, no explanation?? She blocked me on FB and unfriended me on IG. I feel like absolute shit and how the eff am I supposed to continue..... uuuugggh",0,1737367453.0,AskWomenOver30,0,0.33,False

1i5mvzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1i5mvzl/slippage/,Slippage,"Year: 2083  
Name: Scolex  
Age: 22

Week 1:

Monday:   
There‚Äôs something strange about beginnings. Life feels like it‚Äôs just starting, even after so many years of work. Here I am, fresh out of college, a shiny degree in hand, ready to begin my post-grad at a university in Belarus. The air is crisp, carrying the weight of possibilities, almost as if the world itself is congratulating me. Leon‚Äôs proud, of course. He always is.

It‚Äôs been months since I last used the power. Just once, with Leon, years ago. A few minutes stolen from reality‚Äîenough to cement our bond forever. No one else knows. No one needs to know. And I intend to keep it that way. It‚Äôs a secret, a heavy one, but one I can carry. Barely, but surely.

Week 2:

Wednesday:  
Ruby. It's a beautiful name isn't it? It sounds like a name forged in the deep, hidden parts of the earth‚Äîprecious, rare, something you might find buried in a forgotten corner of the world. Something that was made to name someone really special. Someone worth it. She sat next to me in class, and somehow, just by being there, unbeknownst to her, she stole my attention. The way she tucked her hair behind her ear when she thought really hard‚Äîthere was something in that simple gesture that stayed with me. It‚Äôs strange, but I can‚Äôt get it out of my head.

Saturday:  
We talked after class. She‚Äôs quiet, soft-spoken, but there‚Äôs something in the way she carries herself, a quiet confidence that speaks louder than her words. She is firm, almost scary, without ever raising her voice. I think she might be the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt need to shout to be heard. Maybe we could be friends.

Week 3:

Monday:  
She said yes! I asked her out for coffee today. She said ""Sure! When and where?"". She actually said that. I‚Äôm still replaying it in my mind, the way her eyes brightened when she smiled. It was like a secret only the two of us shared.

Tuesday:  
The coffee was perfect. The conversation flowed so naturally, like we‚Äôd known each other for years. We slandered the professors. She even has nicknames for them. She's named our chemistry professor ""Regie"". She says it's apt because he is like aqua regia. He dissolves all joy when he walks into the class.

Thursday:  
~  
It wasn‚Äôt the coffee  
but the way she held it,  
hands delicate, like holding the world.  

It wasn‚Äôt the words,  
but the way she laughed,  
a soft melody piercing the silence.  

It wasn‚Äôt the moment,   
but the way it lingered,  
stretching time like an endless dream.  

It wasn't me and her,  
But us.  
~  

Week 4:

Tuesday:  
I told her about my power today. I don‚Äôt know why I did it. Maybe it was the way she looked at me‚Äîlike she would believe anything I said. I stopped time for a few minutes, just to show her.

Her reaction was everything I‚Äôd hoped for. Wonder, awe. She called it beautiful. And she called me beautiful. Those words‚Äîher voice when she said them‚Äîstayed with me long after the moment passed.

Week 5:

Tuesday:  
She keeps asking me to stop time now. It‚Äôs become our little secret. A few minutes here, a few minutes there. Today, we rearranged all the desks in the lecture hall, flipping the professor‚Äôs on its side. The look on his face when time resumed‚Äîit was priceless.

Wednesday:  
We froze time and swapped all the seniors‚Äô backpacks around. Chaos erupted when they tried to find their notes. Ruby couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. The sound of her laughter, ringing out in that frozen world, was like music.

Friday:  
Leon found out. He‚Äôs furious. He said I‚Äôm being reckless. He doesn‚Äôt understand. But this is the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. Because she enjoys it so much. You didn't have to call me ""irresponsible"" or ""immature"". I'm doing it for her. Isn't that enough?

Sunday:  
~  
Her laughter is the only sound in the silence,  
a symphony in a frozen world. A melodic treatise.  
Her touch is the anchor, gentle penance,  
pulling me back to the stillness of her eyes.  
~  

Week 6:

Monday:  
I think I‚Äôm in love.  

Tuesday:  
I practiced it today. Over and over, in front of the mirror, saying the words out loud. ‚ÄúRuby, I need you to know... that this isn‚Äôt just about the power. This is about us. I want you to decide for yourself, without any of my influence. I need you to be honest with me.‚Äù I keep imagining her response. What if she doesn‚Äôt feel the same? What if it ruins everything? I simulate every possible response, I prepare for the bleakest reply.

I can‚Äôt let fear win. So I practice it again, adjusting my words, refining the way my hands move. Until it feels right, until I know the words are true. Until my reflection seems to nod in agreement.

Wednesday:  
I told her. In the stopped time, I told her everything. She said she liked me too. But something felt off. There was a distance in her voice, a hesitation. I brushed it aside. Love has a way of making you blind.

Friday:  
She asked me to stop time for an entire day so she could study. I hesitated but agreed. That's not what my power is for. But I made an exception. Anything for her. She had that look in her eyes‚Äîthe one that made it impossible to say no.

Week 7:

Saturday:  
Today was... normal. Just another day of classes, talking with Ruby, catching up with Leon. The usual, I suppose. But something shifted.

Ruby was looking at me differently today. I don‚Äôt know what it was, but something in her gaze softened. She reached out, touched my arm for a second, and I swear I felt electricity pass between us. Maybe it‚Äôs nothing. Maybe I‚Äôm just reading too much into it.

By the end of the day, she asked me to stop time for a few minutes so we could walk through campus together. As we moved through the frozen world, she seemed more relaxed. Like she could finally breathe. Maybe she was seeing me for who I truly was‚Äîmaybe this time, it was different.

I can‚Äôt explain it. But I think she might be starting to like me.

Week 8:

Monday:  
She told me she liked me. She said it out loud, and for a moment, I thought my heart had stopped. But there was something in her eyes that made me pause. Was this really true? Or was she just saying what she thought I wanted to hear?

I stayed up late, thinking. I‚Äôve always been careful with my feelings, never letting myself fall too hard. But now, I‚Äôm here, unsure, questioning everything.

Wednesday:  
I asked her again today, just to be sure. I needed to know if it was real. And she assured me, with all of her being, that it was. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you. Not just the power, but you. The real you.‚Äù She squeezed my hand tightly, ""trust me, I love you too.""

Maybe I was just scared. Maybe I was just afraid of what I might lose. But no. She‚Äôs telling me the truth. This time, it‚Äôs real. She loves me.

Week 9:

Tuesday:  
Time. It‚Äôs getting harder to stop stopping it, harder to pretend nothing‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôve stopped time for weeks now, for Ruby. Every moment we share, every second frozen, feels like we‚Äôre holding onto something that isn‚Äôt ours to keep.

But I can‚Äôt stop. Every moment without her feels like a moment I‚Äôm losing. I can‚Äôt bear it.

Wednesday:  
I‚Äôm starting to worry. The longer I stop time, the more unnatural it feels. Time should be moving, but it doesn‚Äôt. And yet, we keep going. But something is wrong. I can feel it. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up.

Week 10:

Monday:  
Months. It‚Äôs been months. We‚Äôve been stopping time for months now, and I feel myself slipping away. The weight of it all presses down on me, each second frozen a reminder that I‚Äôm drifting farther from reality.

Ruby doesn‚Äôt notice. She‚Äôs too wrapped up in the moments we share. She‚Äôs content, I can see it in her eyes. But every time I freeze the world, it feels heavier, like I‚Äôm digging myself deeper into something I can‚Äôt escape.

Sunday:  
I think it's been a year now. I don‚Äôt want to stop anymore. But I do it anyway. I do it for her. Every time. And every time, it gets harder. The longer we stay in this frozen world, the more distant the real world feels.

I see the cracks now. I know what‚Äôs happening, but I can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm losing myself. But every time I see her smile, it feels a little lighter. As if my soul is floating away.

Week 11:

SomeDay:  
Twelve years. That‚Äôs how long I‚Äôve kept time stopped this time. Twelve years of stolen moments, of pretending the world doesn‚Äôt exist. But it‚Äôs catching up to me. Every second I took from time, I paid for it. And now, the price is too high.

I don‚Äôt know how long I can keep this up. I can‚Äôt keep pretending like I‚Äôm not losing myself. The moments are slipping away, and I‚Äôm drowning in the stillness.

Twelve days later  

This is the last time we'll talk, Scolex. I'm Ruby, I'm gonna talk to this diary pretending it's you.

I didn‚Äôt understand then. I couldn‚Äôt. How could I? You never let me know. Why didn't you tell me?
But now, after everything‚Äîafter you're gone‚ÄîI realize the price you paid. The price I made you pay. I watched you stop time for us, over and over, wrapped in the illusion of it, the comfort of holding onto a frozen world. I never thought about what I was doing to you. I never saw the weight of it, how each moment you stole was costing you.

I know now. He told me nothing about it, but I‚Äôve learned from Leon. The truth was in your eyes, every time you stopped the clock. The truth is weighing on me now, it doesn't matter how many tears I cry for you. I feel like I've lost the right to love you now, I've lost the right to cry for you now.

Every moment you stopped time costed you. Not just a little. Your life. You paid with pieces of yourself every time the world paused. You lost a second of your own life in exchange for a second in frozen time. And you paid twice if he stopped it with someone else. With me. Why didn't you tell me? 

The moment I asked you to freeze time again, I asked you to give up another piece of himself. I didn‚Äôt know. I couldn‚Äôt have known. But now, with you gone, I realize what I did.

The last time you stopped time, you knew you were exhausted. You lay down in my lap, you rested your head on my leg. You said you wanted to spend the last few with me. I didn't know it was because you ran out of time himself when I thought you could stop it. I asked you to resume time so that you could Verdy by his side. You refused.

I woke up feeling super confident today.¬†Got ready, put on my Dior Sauvage (thanks for the tip to the ones to recommended it), and headed to school.

Classes went smoothly, and during lunch, something unexpected happened again.¬†While I was putting on my turfs to play football, she (the girl who asked me out) came up to me and asked, ""So, are you actually gonna go get coffee with me?""

I said yes, and she replied, ""Okay, I‚Äôll be waiting outside the gate after school,"" gave me a wink, and walked off with her friends.

The rest of the day felt great.¬†I was confident, even scored two goals during our match, and when school ended, I quickly freshened up with my two of my bros, sprayed on 4 more sprays Dior sauvage just to be safe,¬†and headed to the gate it my bros.

She showed up with her friends, but then she said something to them then, they left.¬†It was just the two of us. She asked, ""So, are we going to (cafe name)?""

I said, ""Yeah, let‚Äôs go.""

The cafe was close, so we walked there, making small talk.¬†Once inside, we found a cozy spot, and she ordered one cappuccino while I went for a chocolate cake instead.¬†She teased me about not liking coffee, and the conversation just flowed from there.¬†At one point, she even stole a bite of my cake, grinning as she said, ""This is so good.

I asked a her why did she ask me out for coffee then she said smilling ""Hm 1st you always smell super good. 2nd you're athletic and i like it. 3rd i have seen you with your friends and think you have really nice personality. and lastly, you're exactly my type"".  After that we continued with our conversation.

She took out her phone took a few photos then we swapped Instagrams while talking about school, our families, and random stuff.¬†When the bill came, she insisted on paying for herself, so I let her.

As I walked her home (her place isn't far from our school) I stopped Infront of a Shopno to buy her a Cadbury Bubbly (i think thats the one).¬†She blushed like crazy, when I handed it to her, which was honestly super cute seeing her blush.

When we got to her building, she turned to me and said, ""Thanks for¬†today.¬†I had a lot of fun."" Then, out of nowhere, she gave me a little peck on the cheek, ran inside, and left me standing there like an idiot.

I called my driver to pick me up, still processing¬†everything.

Should the Venus brew more than 300ml?.  I've got a 6 cup cafeteria and that brews two large cups of coffee.

I‚Äôm working at a startup, a service-based one, mind you, where every day feels like a battlefield. Deadlines, client calls, brainstorming sessions at midnight, figuring out AWS, and yes, sometimes even Googling ‚Äúhow to survive on caffeine and stress.‚Äù Meanwhile, my friend works at an MNC, and all I hear from him is:

‚ÄúBro, I just submitted a ticket; now I‚Äôm waiting for it to get approved by 3 other teams. Then I‚Äôll chill with my free coffee.‚Äù

And I‚Äôm sitting here thinking, ‚ÄúDamn, must be nice to have a team that handles everything for you.‚Äù Meanwhile, in the startup world, you are the team. You're the dev, the tester, the designer, and sometimes even the guy fixing the office Wi-Fi.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, props to him for securing a comfortable life. MNCs are structured, stable, and they pay well. But is it really growth if you‚Äôre just doing what you‚Äôre told, with no room to experiment or fail? At my startup, I screw up, learn, and try again. I wear a thousand hats because I have to, and honestly, it‚Äôs exhausting but also exhilarating.

So here‚Äôs my question: Is the startup grind worth it for the adrenaline and rapid growth, or is the MNC life better for its stability and defined roles?

Also, let‚Äôs be real, are MNC folks just coasting while startups are out here building the future, or am I just salty from pulling another all-nighter? Let me know your takes because I know someone here is ready to defend their ‚ÄúMNC comfort zone‚Äù with buzzwords like ""work-life balance"" and ""global exposure."" Bring it on.

Name: Scolex  
Age: 22

Week 1:

Monday:   
There‚Äôs something strange about beginnings. Life feels like it‚Äôs just starting, even after so many years of work. Here I am, fresh out of college, a shiny degree in hand, ready to begin my post-grad at a university in Belarus. The air is crisp, carrying the weight of possibilities, almost as if the world itself is congratulating me. Leon‚Äôs proud, of course. He always is.

It‚Äôs been months since I last used the power. Just once, with Leon, years ago. A few minutes stolen from reality‚Äîenough to cement our bond forever. No one else knows. No one needs to know. And I intend to keep it that way. It‚Äôs a secret, a heavy one, but one I can carry. Barely, but surely.

Week 2:

Wednesday:  
Ruby. It's a beautiful name isn't it? It sounds like a name forged in the deep, hidden parts of the earth‚Äîprecious, rare, something you might find buried in a forgotten corner of the world. Something that was made to name someone really special. Someone worth it. She sat next to me in class, and somehow, just by being there, unbeknownst to her, she stole my attention. The way she tucked her hair behind her ear when she thought really hard‚Äîthere was something in that simple gesture that stayed with me. It‚Äôs strange, but I can‚Äôt get it out of my head.

Saturday:  
We talked after class. She‚Äôs quiet, soft-spoken, but there‚Äôs something in the way she carries herself, a quiet confidence that speaks louder than her words. She is firm, almost scary, without ever raising her voice. I think she might be the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt need to shout to be heard. Maybe we could be friends.

Week 3:

Monday:  
She said yes! I asked her out for coffee today. She said ""Sure! When and where?"". She actually said that. I‚Äôm still replaying it in my mind, the way her eyes brightened when she smiled. It was like a secret only the two of us shared.

Tuesday:  
The coffee was perfect. The conversation flowed so naturally, like we‚Äôd known each other for years. We slandered the professors. She even has nicknames for them. She's named our chemistry professor ""Regie"". She says it's apt because he is like aqua regia. He dissolves all joy when he walks into the class.

Thursday:

but the way she held it,  
hands delicate, like holding the world.  

It wasn‚Äôt the words,  
but the way she laughed,  
a soft melody piercing the silence.  

It wasn‚Äôt the moment,   
but the way it lingered,  
stretching time like an endless dream.  

It wasn't me and her,  
But us.  
~  

Week 4:

Tuesday:  
I told her about my power today. I don‚Äôt know why I did it. Maybe it was the way she looked at me‚Äîlike she would believe anything I said. I stopped time for a few minutes, just to show her.

Her reaction was everything I‚Äôd hoped for. Wonder, awe. She called it beautiful. And she called me beautiful. Those words‚Äîher voice when she said them‚Äîstayed with me long after the moment passed.

Week 5:

Tuesday:  
She keeps asking me to stop time now. It‚Äôs become our little secret. A few minutes here, a few minutes there. Today, we rearranged all the desks in the lecture hall, flipping the professor‚Äôs on its side. The look on his face when time resumed‚Äîit was priceless.

Wednesday:  
We froze time and swapped all the seniors‚Äô backpacks around. Chaos erupted when they tried to find their notes. Ruby couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. The sound of her laughter, ringing out in that frozen world, was like music.

Friday:  
Leon found out. He‚Äôs furious. He said I‚Äôm being reckless. He doesn‚Äôt understand. But this is the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. Because she enjoys it so much. You didn't have to call me ""irresponsible"" or ""immature"". I'm doing it for her. Isn't that enough?

Sunday:  
~  
Her laughter is the only sound in the silence,  
a symphony in a frozen world. A melodic treatise.  
Her touch is the anchor, gentle penance,  
pulling me back to the stillness of her eyes.  
~  

Week 6:

Monday:  
I think I‚Äôm in love.  

Tuesday:  
I practiced it today. Over and over, in front of the mirror, saying the words out loud. ‚ÄúRuby, I need you to know... that this isn‚Äôt just about the power. This is about us. I want you to decide for yourself, without any of my influence. I need you to be honest with me.‚Äù I keep imagining her response. What if she doesn‚Äôt feel the same? What if it ruins everything? I simulate every possible response, I prepare for the bleakest reply.

I can‚Äôt let fear win. So I practice it again, adjusting my words, refining the way my hands move. Until it feels right, until I know the words are true. Until my reflection seems to nod in agreement.

Wednesday:  
I told her. In the stopped time, I told her everything. She said she liked me too. But something felt off. There was a distance in her voice, a hesitation. I brushed it aside. Love has a way of making you blind.

Friday:  
She asked me to stop time for an entire day so she could study. I hesitated but agreed. That's not what my power is for. But I made an exception. Anything for her. She had that look in her eyes‚Äîthe one that made it impossible to say no.

Week 7:

Saturday:  
Today was... normal. Just another day of classes, talking with Ruby, catching up with Leon. The usual, I suppose. But something shifted.

Ruby was looking at me differently today. I don‚Äôt know what it was, but something in her gaze softened. She reached out, touched my arm for a second, and I swear I felt electricity pass between us. Maybe it‚Äôs nothing. Maybe I‚Äôm just reading too much into it.

By the end of the day, she asked me to stop time for a few minutes so we could walk through campus together. As we moved through the frozen world, she seemed more relaxed. Like she could finally breathe. Maybe she was seeing me for who I truly was‚Äîmaybe this time, it was different.

I can‚Äôt explain it. But I think she might be starting to like me.

Week 8:

Monday:  
She told me she liked me. She said it out loud, and for a moment, I thought my heart had stopped. But there was something in her eyes that made me pause. Was this really true? Or was she just saying what she thought I wanted to hear?

I stayed up late, thinking. I‚Äôve always been careful with my feelings, never letting myself fall too hard. But now, I‚Äôm here, unsure, questioning everything.

Wednesday:  
I asked her again today, just to be sure. I needed to know if it was real. And she assured me, with all of her being, that it was. She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you. Not just the power, but you. The real you.‚Äù She squeezed my hand tightly, ""trust me, I love you too.""

Maybe I was just scared. Maybe I was just afraid of what I might lose. But no. She‚Äôs telling me the truth. This time, it‚Äôs real. She loves me.

Week 9:

Tuesday:  
Time. It‚Äôs getting harder to stop stopping it, harder to pretend nothing‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôve stopped time for weeks now, for Ruby. Every moment we share, every second frozen, feels like we‚Äôre holding onto something that isn‚Äôt ours to keep.

But I can‚Äôt stop. Every moment without her feels like a moment I‚Äôm losing. I can‚Äôt bear it.

Wednesday:  
I‚Äôm starting to worry. The longer I stop time, the more unnatural it feels. Time should be moving, but it doesn‚Äôt. And yet, we keep going. But something is wrong. I can feel it. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up.

Week 10:

Monday:  
Months. It‚Äôs been months. We‚Äôve been stopping time for months now, and I feel myself slipping away. The weight of it all presses down on me, each second frozen a reminder that I‚Äôm drifting farther from reality.

Ruby doesn‚Äôt notice. She‚Äôs too wrapped up in the moments we share. She‚Äôs content, I can see it in her eyes. But every time I freeze the world, it feels heavier, like I‚Äôm digging myself deeper into something I can‚Äôt escape.

Sunday:  
I think it's been a year now. I don‚Äôt want to stop anymore. But I do it anyway. I do it for her. Every time. And every time, it gets harder. The longer we stay in this frozen world, the more distant the real world feels.

I see the cracks now. I know what‚Äôs happening, but I can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm losing myself. But every time I see her smile, it feels a little lighter. As if my soul is floating away.

Week 11:

SomeDay:  
Twelve years. That‚Äôs how long I‚Äôve kept time stopped this time. Twelve years of stolen moments, of pretending the world doesn‚Äôt exist. But it‚Äôs catching up to me. Every second I took from time, I paid for it. And now, the price is too high.

I don‚Äôt know how long I can keep this up. I can‚Äôt keep pretending like I‚Äôm not losing myself. The moments are slipping away, and I‚Äôm drowning in the stillness.

Twelve days later  

This is the last time we'll talk, Scolex. I'm Ruby, I'm gonna talk to this diary pretending it's you.

I didn‚Äôt understand then. I couldn‚Äôt. How could I? You never let me know. Why didn't you tell me?
But now, after everything‚Äîafter you're gone‚ÄîI realize the price you paid. The price I made you pay. I watched you stop time for us, over and over, wrapped in the illusion of it, the comfort of holding onto a frozen world. I never thought about what I was doing to you. I never saw the weight of it, how each moment you stole was costing you.

I know now. He told me nothing about it, but I‚Äôve learned from Leon. The truth was in your eyes, every time you stopped the clock. The truth is weighing on me now, it doesn't matter how many tears I cry for you. I feel like I've lost the right to love you now, I've lost the right to cry for you now.

Every moment you stopped time costed you. Not just a little. Your life. You paid with pieces of yourself every time the world paused. You lost a second of your own life in exchange for a second in frozen time. And you paid twice if he stopped it with someone else. With me. Why didn't you tell me? 

The moment I asked you to freeze time again, I asked you to give up another piece of himself. I didn‚Äôt know. I couldn‚Äôt have known. But now, with you gone, I realize what I did.

The last time you stopped time, you knew you were exhausted. You lay down in my lap, you rested your head on my leg. You said you wanted to spend the last few with me. I didn't know it was because you ran out of time himself when I thought you could stop it. I asked you to resume time so that you could Verdy by his side. You refused.

It‚Äôs too late to say I‚Äôm sorry. You're not here anymore. And I‚Äôll never get to say the things I should‚Äôve said. The things I wanted to. But I‚Äôll carry this. I‚Äôll remember you. The real you.

You didn‚Äôt deserve any of this.

I wanted to ask about general etiquette of smoking in Japan, as well as specifically in nature and secluded areas (so not tokyo proper, kyoto proper) 

  
For instance, if im on some abandoned railway tracks on the outskirts of Tokyo with no one around, can i smoke in the open air wilderness there? Or do i still have to walk a KM or two for a smoking area?

  
I found that tons of people smoke in the streets of Shinjuku Kabukicho area (gritty nightlife) and i've always read people only smoke in smoking areas. So what gives?

  
Here's my weird question ... Where i'm from, smoking a cigarette (ashing in a portable ashtray, being clean about it of course) is very enjoyable in nature with a cup of coffee in the cold. Especially if its raining, or by a river. I love smokes like that. They're very relaxing. 

  
I wanted to ask if this is at all permissable? Say, on hiking trails? Or at tops of hikes? Of course with common sense, not light up a cigarette if someone is near me, never blow smoke in anyones face, etc...



Just worried about if i can't smoke at all as a very hard rule unless its in smoking areas when in isolated areas and not in crowds.

Change your environment to refresh your mind ‚Äì try the library, a coffee shop, or even a park. Sometimes a change of scenery can spark new energy.

However, for me, it literally only stops the coffee coming out prematurely and actually feels easier to push down on (even when using both a metal and paper filter together). 

If there was something that was a similar design to a flow control cap, but only released when x psi/bar is being applied, would you be interested in getting it? (With the brewing process remaining the same as ordinary, just a different cap with extra pressure exerted)

Concerns/thoughts are:
- I don‚Äôt want to be trying to make an espresso in an Aeropress, just want to get 1-1.5 bar. 
- Strength/stability of cup/mug when applying this downward force.

1i5mfff,https://www.reddit.com/r/NPDRelationships/comments/1i5mfff/should_i_cater_more_to_my_girlfriends_needs/,Should I cater more to my girlfriend's needs?,"I need to vent, but this is also a question.

My girlfriend and I have very different personas and lifestyles. We are both in our late 40s.

She has had the same office job for 16 years and is getting a little bored with it, even though she is not likely to look for a new one. She's been living in the same area all her life. She has had a long term relationship before me, and not much more. She never had any kids so she still sleeps in until 10-11 on weekends. She likes routine and will do the same things on the weekend: Go for a walk after 12, come home and clean the house (thoroughly) - she puts everything away and she likes clean surfaces. Everyday, after 19:00, she will lay down on the couch and watch TV - mostly Netflix etc. She has very few friends and will spend way more time with her family than her friends (80/20). She is an introvert and will ask me to go stay somewhere else once in a while, so she can have the house to herself (no problem) 

  
I, on the other hand, have had multiple jobs, even at once. Lived in a lot of places from denmark to the USA. I have had many girlfriends (sadly), some more fun than others. I have two daughters aged 18 and 21. I don't spend much time with my family but love to hang out with my  daughters and weird friends and talk about what's going on in the world. Since I work with events at all times of the week, I often work weekends and come home late, exhausted but happy. I often invite her along, but she always reclines. I get good energy from spending time with people(!) We try to invite each other out once in a while: I usually find something alternative and cheap, she usually picks something established and expensive. No day is the same for me and I always run multiple projects which leaves a bit of a mess. I spend a lot of time online and I am engaged in politics and love a good conspiracy theory (she avoids it). If I lay down and watch TV at night I fall asleep on the couch next to her. When I run events I am full of energy and will come home to tell about all the exciting people that I have met. 

**Here is the problem.**

When I get home happy and tired from another great event or a night out with my friends, she gets upset and sad that I ""only"" seem to have fun outside the house without her,  and I rest and sleep when I am at home. She is afraid that I am bored with her and wishes we could watch more TV together without me sleeping. If I go to bed early, because I know that I will fall asleep anyway, she gets upset. On the weekends i wake up at 6 and often just sit and listen to music while I doomscrool. I used to make breakfast and coffee for her, but because she sometimes won't get up before 10 and has never done that herself I guess it isn't that important to her. Since she is doing most of the cleaning (way more than I would ever do) she wants me to do all the cooking  (which is only fair). But she is as picky with food as my kids and will get very upset if I cook dinner that she doesn't like (like an upset teenager). She refuses to eat it and blames me for being disrespectful to her taste in food. She hates all indian food, tofu, chickpeas for example. She will literally slam the kitchen door on me!

She will very often complain about the self-chosen chores that she ""has"" to do: the constant cleaning, washing, walking the neighbors dog, make a sandwich, visit her mother, do laundry (I do too), knitting, go for a walk or a run. Keep in mind she never had any kids and has all the time in the world to herself. I on the other hand have my jobs and kids to attend to. I admit that I do a lot of things to get my narcissistic supply, but I often invite her along and suggest to do something a little crazy, like smoke a little weed and go for a hike. But like I said, she mostly reclines. I can also get very engaged in my theories and love to discuss them, but she doesn't like to challenge the establishment, so we don't talk about it'

I appreciate her stability, but wish that she would be a little more curious and adventurous. I am very grateful that she takes care of the house, but less would be ok and I am more than happy for her to leave a little for me. But the fact that she asks me to leave the house, but then complains because I had a good time annoys me. She doesn't want to do something different or spontaneous. She sleeps until 10 on the weekends  and wastes fun-time. And then she wonders why I go somewhere else for fun(?) 

I know that I can act as a spoiled teenager because I cater more to my own needs than anybody else, but I never complain about her lifestyle or throw a fit when she does something I don't like, I'll just do something else.

**?**

I am the asshole here for thinking she is wrong? Should I change my lifestyle a little more for her? Should I stick to the 5 dishes she likes and make breakfast for her on the weekends? Should I go to more established and known events only with her,  without my weird friends, so she can feel that we do exciting things together too?

In front of everyone after being told multiple times that I do not discuss politics at work he says to me: ‚Äúhave you had your coffee today? You seem grumpy. Is it because Trump is being inaugurated today? Are you watching the inauguration?‚Äú I simply replied with ‚ÄúI have already told you I do not discuss politics at work, as far as watching the inauguration goes, no thanks I do not celebrate felons or rapists!‚Äù 

You could see in his face he was not happy as he walked away rushing for the HR office. I was called into the office and spoken to, I explained to them the situation, told them why I was not impressed at him asking me that question, putting me in the line to ‚Äúbe polite‚Äù in front of everyone as he clearly attempted to bully me into participating in conversations I‚Äôve made clear, I have no interest in. I explained to them that I have told him now multiple times to not discuss politics with me at work because him and I think differently, and I would rather keep a friendly and professional atmosphere at work, but that he keeps violating my wishes and discussing politics at work.

HR told me that he thinks I was out of line and disrespectful for calling Trump a felon and a rapist. I told them that if anyone was out of line, and disrespectful, it was him for not respecting my wishes and boundaries. HR will speak to him next.

1i5mcch,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i5mcch/how_to_spot_bad_tasting_coffee_mistakes_my_fault/,"How to spot bad tasting coffee mistakes, my fault or bad beans? A not short story [Profitec Go + Turin D40+]","How to spot and taste beans' flavour profile, notes, and whether its a good coffee or not? Plus some background in case you wanna read it

So, for the longest time I've been enjoying my daily (or moreso twice a day) milk drinks out of my Profitec Go without much worry, but recently I've been feeling more fancy and after experimenting with filter coffee for a while, I felt like my usual routine was missing something.

For context, I had a very hard time sourcing ""cheap"" but decent, fresh coffee I can run through without worrying about the cost (Spain based), and settled for a small roaster called Cafe Sin Intermediarios, more specifically, they medium-roast natural colombian beans. Paired those with a D40+ grinder which, so far I have not upgraded but I'm heavily considering doing so from the recent events.

Cappuccinos in the moring were great, sweet, good body, good aftertaste, and life was good. So were afternoon cortados. (19g in 42g out in 32 seconds as my daily shot's numbers).
Then filter came in, got a V60 and a Kingrinder K6 and just did some average recipies (1:16 ratio) on a couple blends from Nomad Coffee. And let me tell you, It. Was. Weird. 
Here in Spain, most coffee you drink quite dark and bitter, with the variables being most of the time whether your local bar has cleaned their machine during that month or not, so not great for tasting different notes.

Filter changed that for me so fast. I didn't enjoy the flavours as much as its a very different drink from what I've been used to, but I totally get what people meant with terms such as  ""clarity"", ""floral"" and ""fruity"". And with that new info I came back to my everyday stuff. 

Cereals. Everything I could taste now was big cereal notes. Sure, sweetness was still there, and i could tell acidity was also low when compared to the filter stuff, but I could now taste notes as well, not just the basic taste of it. 

With that in mind, I thought I would try other stuff to mix in from time to time. Did some more research and ended up in a roaster called Bocon√≥, which had a reasonable price, and seemed to specialice in roasting, even winning some awards for that.. 
Got some of their brazilian red bourbon 80% natural 20% semi-washed (not completely sure what semi means). Roast date was terrible (32 days at the date of recieving the beans) but I didn't think too much of it as my other stuff from Cafe Sin Intermediarios doesn't even include a roast date. Opened it up, strong sweetness coming off the box, but no notes i could spot. 
Managed to dial it in after going waaaaay coarser than what i used to, which seemed weird as roast was similar, and managed to pull something that was between my boundaries (19g in, 44g out in 35 seconds). It was horrendous. Acidity was through the roof, didn't taste like anything (flavour notes should be ""fruity"", ""sweet"", ""nuts"", as per the package and it tasted nothing like it), no crema and it felt very lacking in body, and the acidity kept lingering in the mouth for an eternity. Tried going coarser (42g in 28s), still the same. Pulled at higher temp, 96C from my normal 93C, still the same.

Since that couple of shots I've been non stop doing research on whether my grinder may not be great for this coffee, as the time I tried grinding for filter from it, it was a catastrophe, but all I find seems to say the opposite, with it seemingly being an easy to dial profile.

So the actual questions and why I'm asking for help, and TL;DR at that.

- Is acidity from under extraction different from acidity from the beans, as in stuff such as the aftertaste being different (from my experience, the acidity from fruity beans didn't last as long)?

- How do old beans behave in terms of basic taste? I assume the lack of notes comes from that, but does stuff such as bitterness and acidity also change the older the bean? May that come not from the bean itself but from how the shot pulls differently (for instance having to grind coarser from the beans losing CO2 overtime and becoming more compact and harder fro water to come through, if thats a thing)?

- Is my statement above true? Do flavour notes really dry off as coffee becomes older? Or could it be the case that the acidity comes from the fruityness becoming more and more overwhelming while the nutty profile disappear?

- How come a small, conical burr grinder, with high-ish rpm, which should be producing quite some fines (im hot starting it but not slow feeding) produce a coffee thats more sour than bitter? I would assume I am over-extracting some particles in the puck, so it would come out more bitter?

Hopefully someone helps this poor guy out, or else I'll have to take a trip to Starbucks to regain some faith in my shots. Thanks in advance to anyone who replies and sorry for the insanely long post, I'm bad at this stuff.",1,1737364713.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1i5mb9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/1i5mb9z/are_yunzi_stones_a_worthy_upgrade/,Are Yunzi stones a worthy upgrade?,"Hey all,

a few years ago when first starting to learn Go I got myself a beginner playing set, consisting of a wooden board with 19x19 on one side and 13x13 on the other, two wooden bowls and a set of glass stones. The wood is probably nothing special, but the bowls still look and feel really cool. This board is ok.

While the stones are also fine, I was thinking about upgrading to mono-convex Yunzi stones. The reason is less that I dislike the glass stones so much. I rather have two other reasons:
- I currently sometimes play the game at home or analyze games on the board, while I also sometimes play at work with a collegue during coffee break. I usually take the board back and forth between work and home for those occasions. While the bowls with the stones fit nicely into my backpack, taking the board back and forth is always a hassle (I commute by bike). With a second set of stones, I could also get a second board (maybe one of those rollable playing mats, which are easy to take on trips/holiday/etc.?) and then have my at-home-board and a work/on the go board.
- Since I often use the board to analyze games/play along with books/do Tsumego, I am looking at the mono-convex stones. I read somewhere that these can be handy for analyzing games, since you can play the main variation normally and place variant stones upside down so you can afterwards easily distinguish them from one another.

Now my questions are, would you get a second set of stones/playing set in my situation? Do you have Yunzi stones yourself? How do they feel to play with, are they as good or better than glass stones? How often do you actually use the upside-down technique during analysis?

Thanks in advance for your input :)",3,1737364574.0,baduk,1,0.8,False

1i5m9kh,https://v.redd.it/2lr4hvc484ee1,Switching from instant coffee for the first time‚Äîit's worlds apart! A huge thank you to this amazing community and all you wonderful contributors.,"I‚Äôve been lurking around this sub for a few months now and finally decided to let go of instant coffee and switch to specialty blends. And oh my‚Äîit‚Äôs truly worlds apart! I realize now that I‚Äôve been missing out on one of life‚Äôs greatest delicacies all this time.

For my first purchase, I ordered a Bialetti 1-cup and the Kaldipress during Amazon‚Äôs Republic Day Sale. The Kaldi arrived early, so I decided to give it a go right away.

I followed [European Coffee Trip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw5nWy9NZxQ)‚Äôs Aeropress recipe, and it turned out phenomenal. I used BT Sandalwood Estate for this brew and followed their recipe almost exactly, with one small tweak: instead of keeping the total liquid weight at 200ml, I diluted it further to 275ml. This adjustment seemed to make the flavor notes much more pronounced.

The cup started off with a slightly bitter, dark chocolaty note and gradually mellowed into a delightful zesty orange aftertaste that lingered for a good five minutes after the last sip. It was nothing like the rancid, overly bitter, stale-tasting instant coffee I‚Äôve been drinking my whole life.

A huge thank you to everyone here who takes the time to guide noobs like me, sharing tips on what to do (and what not to do). And a special thanks to u/surilch and team for creating such an amazing and affordable alternative.

1i5m39b,https://i.redd.it/eiis5d0v54ee1.jpeg,[Mentalist Rewatch] 6x04 Red Listed,"This anniversary rewatch will run daily until February 18, the 10-year anniversary of the Mentalist's series finale.


**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 119 brings us to ""Red Listed,"" which sends us on another case with a Red John suspect, this time with FBI Agent Reede Smith. Smith calls Lisbon and Jane to a crime scene, and Jane recognizes the man as Benjamin Marx, who he once buried in a grave after he murdered a man by also burying him alive. As they leave the scene, Jane admits that he may have gotten Marx killed.

Title relevance: A red list is a list of species becoming extinct, and the episode focuses on Jane's realization that someone is killing everyone on his fake Red John list.

Notable guest stars: William Mapother (from LOST), Kevin Corrigan (from Fringe), Drew Powell (from Gotham)

He suspects she's been holding something back, and she admits that the FBI has been keeping tabs on him, and that Schultz was passing the information on to Kirkland, because he thought Jane was Red John.
- It's revealed that Kirkland is the one killing Jane's fake list of suspects. He demands to know if Haibach recognizes him, asks him if he's Red John, then tortures him by burning him.
- Jane confronts Kirkland at the Homeland office. He denies Homeland stole his list. In the parking lot, Kirkland disables Jane's phone and takes him to the building he's holding Haibach in. Kirkland demands to know the real list.

1i5m38l,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1i5m38l/rf_who_am_i/,[RF] Who Am I?,"I¬†wake up each morning with the same routine. The sunlight filters through the blinds, just like always, casting the same shadows on my floor as the last 50 years I have been in this beautiful house. I stretch, letting the warmth of the sun settle on my skin for a moment before slipping out of bed. I shuffle my way toward the kitchen, to get the kettle ready. After a little while, the kettle boils, and I make my coffee, the steam rising from the cup as I carry it to the kitchen table.¬†

I have so much time now, after retiring. Back then there was always a rush, the mornings a flurry of getting the kids to school, getting ready for work. I worked in accounting, managing numbers and reports, and this kept me busy oftentimes not noticing how late it had gotten. I loved the quiet of the evening after a long day, the house still, children tucked in, and I had time to unwind. I did a good job in my opinion. My children are both successful. I‚Äôd bet my beloved Mildred would be proud of how I handled them.¬†

Now it‚Äôs just me, the house, and outside that passes by at its own pace. After my coffee is cooled, I grab the newspaper and make my way outside to the porch to sit and watch the neighborhood come alive. It is then that I start to think about things that I might need to have done around this house that my frail body is unable to do along with the tasks that I can do- watering the plants, fixing that loose door handle, maybe even calling one of my daughters, Sarah or Emily. They are twins, Sarah just a few minutes older.¬†

After I finish my coffee, I rinse the cup and leave it in the sink to dry. The house is quiet, but I don‚Äôt mind. I‚Äôve never needed a ton of noise to keep me company. I grab my notepad from the counter, and glance at the list I made from yesterday.¬†

It read, ‚ÄúWater the plants, tighten the hinge on the pantry door, call both Sarah and Emily.‚Äù¬†

I head to the living room first, where the ferns by the window sit. The watering can is tucked near the back door. As I pour the water into the pots, the sunlight filtering through is casting delicate patterns on the floor. It reminds me of when the girls were small and they used to make shadow puppets in this room, giggling at the shapes their hands could make.

Afterward, I head to the pantry to take care of that door, the hinge has been squeaking for weeks, driving me up the wall. I grab my toolbox from the garage, find the right screwdriver, and get to work. It‚Äôs a simple fix, but it gave me a sense of accomplishment.¬†

By mid-morning, I‚Äôm ready for a break. I take a seat in the armchair by the window, the same one I‚Äôve had for quite some time, and I relax. The neighborhood is alive now. A couple walks their dog down the street, a boy pedals on his bike, and somewhere I hear the faint sound of a lawnmower. It‚Äôs a good day.¬†

I awake at around noon from my little nap. By late afternoon, the house feels even quieter. I decide it is a good time to call one of the girls. It‚Äôs been a few days since I‚Äôve talked to Sarah, so I dial her number on my phone. It rings a couple times before her voice answers.

‚ÄúHi, Dad!‚Äù she says, her voice lifting my spirits.

‚ÄúHi, sweetheart,‚Äù I reply, leaning back in the chair. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your day going?‚Äù

We talk about her work-something in marketing that I‚Äôve never quite understood but still ask about-and her kids. She tells me about how my grandson scored a goal at his soccer game last weekend and that they plan to visit me soon.¬†

‚ÄúEmily mentioned she‚Äôd stop by this weekend too,‚Äù she adds.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be nice,‚Äù I say. I mean it, but I don‚Äôt linger on the thought too much. It‚Äôs always better when they come over.¬†

After we hung up, I think about calling Emily too. She‚Äôs always been a night owl, so I‚Äôll just wait until after dinner.¬†

For my dinner I just have some soup and crackers. I haven‚Äôt ever been much of a cook, knowing what Mildred taught me before she passed and a few other basic things, but I learned to get by. The kitchen is dimly lit, and the hum of the fridge keeps me company as I eat. After I clean up and make my way back to the living room, it is already nighttime. I‚Äôve never gotten used to this daylight savings idea. I sit in my chair and dial Emily‚Äôs number.

The phone rings four times until she answers with a warm and tired voice. I assume I must have woken her up.¬†

""Hey, Dad.‚Äù

""Hi, Em,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs everything going?‚Äù¬†

She tells me about her latest painting project and how she‚Äôs been thinking about visiting the old family cabin for inspiration. I tell her she‚Äôs welcome and that it might be a little dusty. It‚Äôs been years since anyone‚Äôs been up there. After we say goodbye, I sit for a while, letting the remaining daylight settle over me.

Before bed, I grab my book from the table by the armchair. It‚Äôs a mystery novel I‚Äôve been working through for weeks now, the kind that‚Äôs easy to get lost in. My eyes grow heavy after just a few pages and I set my book mark in the page, setting it on the night stand. I turn off the lamp and listening to the faint creaks of the house. I think about Mildred for a moment before sleep takes me. I don‚Äôt dwell on it too much. It isn‚Äôt a sadness anymore, not entirely. It‚Äôs just a quiet thought at this point. I miss her, but it has been around 30 years since the accident. I‚Äôve kept my promise and stayed alone. I think again, ‚ÄòI‚Äôd bet Mildred is proud of how I‚Äôve grown and raised these girls.‚Äô¬†

That was the last thought in my mind. Darkness fills my mind until I wake up in the morning and repeat the beautiful cycle. Steady and simple, just the way I like it.¬†

*One year later.*¬†

The morning starts like any other. The sunlight filters through the blinds, casting the same shadows as the last 50 years. I stretch, get out of bed, and make my way to the kitchen, the soft hum of the kettle a comfort as I prepare my coffee.

I stand at the counter, the steam rising from the mug in my hands, but for the life of me, I can‚Äôt remember if I added the sugar. I stir it anyway, tasting it to check. No, I didn‚Äôt. I gag. I add the sugar and stir away, tasting it again to alleviate the disgust I am feeling. I frown at the cup, as though it might give me an answer. It‚Äôs such a small thing, that shouldn‚Äôt have unsettled me. I mean I‚Äôve forgotten countless things before. \*‚ÄòIt might just be my age catching up to me,‚Äô\* I jokingly think to myself. Most likely just a moment of distraction.¬†  
  
Later, as I water the plants by the window, I catch myself staring at the fern for too long. Something about its leaves seems odd. \*Did I always have this one? Or was it the other kind?\* My hand hovers over the watering can, and I shake my head. It‚Äôs silly to think this way. Of course it‚Äôs the same fern. I‚Äôve had these since the girls graduated from college.¬†  
  
The phone rings in the early afternoon. Sarah is calling. I pick up.  
  
‚ÄúHi, Dad! Just checking in, how are you?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúGood, good. How are the kids?‚Äù  
  
As she talks, I listen. I might have missed a few words but I understand what she‚Äôs saying and I know what to say. The conversation was nice. It helped me not dwell on that coffee incident.¬†  
  
When we hang up, I sit back in my chair, and stare out the window. I used to be so sharp, but now at this age, my senses are dulling. It's probably just my age. It‚Äôs normal with age.¬†  
  
In the evening, I call Emily. She couldn‚Äôt talk long but enjoyed the short time we had. She told me she is going up to the family cabin to get more ideas for a new painting. After we hang up, I decide to pick up my book. It‚Äôs the sequel to the one I finished about a couple months ago. But as I flip through the pages, I don‚Äôt remember what happened in the last chapter. I turn back a few pages, to refresh my memory. It feels like I‚Äôm recalling a dream. Impossible to pin anything down.  
  
Frustrated, I close the book and set it aside. As I drift off into sleep I think about Mildred. I‚Äôve forgotten her face. It kind of hurts but I remember everything else about her. That‚Äôs good, right?

*One year later.*

I still wake up to the same sunlight filtering through the blinds, but now, it doesn‚Äôt feel the same. It takes me longer to get out of bed these days, and when I do, I have to pause and think about what comes next. Coffee first, right?

The kettle isn‚Äôt on the counter where it should be. I search the cupboards muttering to myself, until I finally find it under the sink of all places. ‚ÄòWhy would I put it there?‚Äô I shake my head and laugh, a little uneasy but I chalk it up to being distracted. That seems to be my excuse for everything now.¬†  
  
When the coffee is ready, I sit at the kitchen table, staring at the notepad. The words look strange. ‚ÄúCall Sarah and Emily,‚Äù it says, but I can‚Äôt remember if I already did. I dial Emily‚Äôs phone this time. She might be on her way back from her workplace. She answers on the second ring. ‚ÄúHi, dad!‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHi sweetheart,‚Äù I say, trying to sound cheerful. ‚ÄúI just wanted to check in. How are you?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm good. We just talked yesterday though, remember?‚Äù  
  
I pause. I don‚Äôt remember. My hand tightens around the phone as I try to think of something to say.  
  
‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I manage, laughing nervously. ‚ÄúWell it doesn‚Äôt hurt to check twice, does it?‚Äù  
  
She laughs too, ‚ÄúNo, it doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù she says. We talk for a few more minutes before hanging up.¬†  
  
When I set the phone down, the uneasiness creeps back in. I feel like I‚Äôm forgetting things more often, like the days are blurring together. I can‚Äôt tell if its just the routine.¬†  
  
In the afternoon, I go to water the plants. The fern by the window has grown unruly, its leaves spreading out over the floor. I need to trim it. I grab the watering can but as I reach for it, I hesitate.  
  
Wasn‚Äôt I just here? Didn‚Äôt I water this already?  
  
I look down at the plant then at my hands, confused. The watering can feels heavy. I set it down and back away, my chest tight. I sit in the chair to try and relax.  
  
Evenings are harder now. I try to read but the words move along the pages. I flip back and forth, trying to find where I left off, but nothing is making sense. I set the book aside, frustrated. In my chair, I watch the streetlights come on. The world goes quiet.  
  
I think about calling Sarah, but I stop myself. What if I already called her today? Or was that yesterday? I call anyway. She answers and we talk for a while. She mentions that I did call her that morning after I called Emily. I tell her I must just be tired. I make my way to bed.  
  
As I drift off, I think of Mildred. My beloved. I can‚Äôt recall many of the memories but I remember the good ones. Our first kiss, date, my proposal, our wedding, everything good. And just as I fall asleep, I remember seeing her in the casket at her funeral. It leaves a melancholic feeling in my chest as I continue to drift off.¬†

*Two years pass.*

Mornings are harder now. I still wake up with the sunlight filtering through the blinds, but it takes longer to piece together where I am. The shadows on the floor seem wrong somehow. I sit on the edge of the bed, staring at the dresser. Just a dresser.  
  
I shuffle to the kitchen, hoping the smell of Coffee would help. The kettle is on the counter this time, but when I grab it, the handle feels too smooth. I blink and shake my head. The motions are automatic as I make the coffee. But when I take a sip it tastes disgusting. I forgot the sugar again‚Ä¶ I think. I can‚Äôt tell anymore.¬†  
  
The phone rings while I sit at the table. I answer.  
  
‚ÄúHi Dad!‚Äù It's Sarah.  
  
‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I say but my voice sounds off.  
  
There‚Äôs a pause on the other end. ‚ÄúHow are you feeling today?‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I reply, but even I can hear how hollow the words are. I feel anything but fine.¬†  
  
She tells me about her day, about the kids and their upcoming projects. I try to keep up but her words blur together, fragments slipping through my mind before I can hold onto them. At one point I am just nodding to silence. She‚Äôs waiting for my response but I don‚Äôt know what to say.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I say finally, ‚Äúwhat were you saying again?‚Äù  
  
Her voice softens. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs okay, Dad. It wasn‚Äôt very important.‚Äù  
  
But it feels important to me. It feels like everything is slipping from me and I can‚Äôt stop it.  
  
I go for a walk in the afternoon. As I step outside, the world is different. The air is heavier, and the streets are long. The houses are stretching into shapes I don‚Äôt recognize. I walk slowly, my steps uneven, and glance around, trying to orient myself. There‚Äôs a house with a blue door that I think I should know.  
  
Further down, a dog barks from a yard, its sound sharp and jarring. I feel lost.  
  
I turn back sooner than I planned but when I reach my front door, my chest tightens. Is this the right house? The numbers look strange. I stand for a moment, unsure, until I finally push it open. Inside, the walls feel too close. I sit down in my armchair, my heart racing. I calm myself.¬†  
  
Evening brings even more confusion. I‚Äôve given up on trying to read. I‚Äôm disappointed because I think I really enjoyed that series of books. I see a picture of Sarah and Emily when they were young, standing in front of the family cabin. I pick it up, holding it close, but the faces don‚Äôt seem right. The harder I look, the more the features blue, until it feels like I‚Äôm looking at strangers. I set it down quickly, my hands trembling.  
  
The phone rings. It‚Äôs Emily and I answer.  
  
‚ÄúHi dad,‚Äù She says, ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI went for a walk,‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good, did you see anything interesting?‚Äù  
  
I pause, trying to remember. The street, what else? It‚Äôs all jumbled now.  
  
‚ÄúNot much,‚Äù I say finally.  
  
We don‚Äôt talk long. After we hang up, I sit in the dark, staring at the shadows on the walls. They move in ways that don‚Äôt make sense. I close my eyes hoping sleep will come quickly.¬†  
  
As I drift, I think of Mildred. It hurts. All I remember of her is the image of her in the casket. It creates a pain in my chest. I start to cry as I fall asleep.¬†

*Two years pass.*

I wake up to the sound of voices. They‚Äôre low, murmuring, just outside the bedroom door. I strain to hear them, but they slip away. The house feels heavy, the air thick like it‚Äôs pressing down on me. I make my way to the kitchen. It‚Äôs dark. I stand for what seems like forever, unsure of what I was trying to do. The kettle is on the counter. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs for. My hands tremble.¬†  
  
The phone rings and I jump. I answer.  
  
‚ÄúDad? Are you there?‚Äù It‚Äôs one of my daughters, I think. It feels like it‚Äôs coming from miles away too.¬†  
  
I try to answer. ‚ÄúI‚Äìuh, year, year, I‚Äôm here.‚Äù  
  
There‚Äôs a pause, I can hear the concern in her voice. ‚ÄúHow are you feeling today?‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù I say automatically, but that couldn‚Äôt be farther from the truth.  
  
‚ÄúEmily and I were talking about coming to visit this weekend,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúDoes that sound good?‚Äù¬†  
  
‚ÄúVisit?‚Äù The word feels foreign, like I‚Äôve never heard it before. I don‚Äôt know what she means. ‚ÄúYes. Yes, of course.‚Äù  
  
When we hand up, I stare at the phone. I can‚Äôt remember what I was doing with the phone.¬†  
  
I don‚Äôt know what time it is. The clock ticks, the hands don‚Äôt make sense. The sun moves. Is it morning? Afternoon? I sit in the chair. There is a picture on the coffee table.

* **Sofas and Chairs:** Choose versatile, neutral-toned sofas that can be dressed up with colorful throws and cushions.
* **Coffee Tables:** A metal table is a modern, durable choice that adds a sleek industrial vibe to your living room.
* **Storage Options:** Invest in multifunctional furniture like ottomans with hidden storage or stylish shelves to keep clutter at bay.

**Styling Tip:** Pair a metal coffee table with soft-textured rugs and fabric sofas for a balanced look that blends contemporary and cozy.

# Dining Room: A Blend of Function and Style

The dining room is a space for sharing meals and creating memories, so your furniture should reflect your personal style while being practical.

* **Dining Table:** Choose a table size that fits your space. For a modern twist, consider metal dining tables that are sturdy, easy to maintain, and chic.
* **Seating:** Mix and match dining chairs for an eclectic look, or opt for upholstered options for added comfort.

**Pro Tip:** For homes with open layouts, add bar stools in Dubai to your kitchen island or bar area to create additional seating. Choose sleek designs with padded seats for a perfect blend of style and comfort.

# Bedroom: Your Personal Sanctuary

Your bedroom should be a calming retreat where every piece of furniture contributes to relaxation and functionality.

* **Bed Frames:** Choose a frame that suits your room's dimensions. Upholstered beds create a cozy vibe, while wooden or metal frames add a modern edge.
* **Storage:** Maximize space with multi-functional furniture like storage beds or bedside tables with drawers.

**Styling Idea:** Use soft lighting and natural wood tones to complement bold accent furniture like metal bedside tables.

# Outdoor Spaces: A Relaxing Oasis

Creating a comfortable and stylish outdoor area is just as important as furnishing your interiors. Whether you have a balcony, patio, or garden, invest in high-quality, weather-resistant furniture.

* **Tables:** Pair rattan seating with a matching table or mix materials with a sleek metal outdoor table for contrast.
* **Decor:** Complete the look with outdoor rugs, lanterns, and cushions to create a welcoming ambiance.

**Expert Tip:** Dubai‚Äôs sunny climate makes rattan outdoor furniture an ideal option for long-lasting beauty and comfort.

# Home Office: Productivity in Style

Your home office should be both functional and inspiring, providing you with a comfortable space to work or study.

* **Desk:** Opt for a spacious desk with storage options. A metal table can double as a sturdy, modern desk for a sleek and professional look.
* **Chair:** Invest in an ergonomic chair to ensure comfort during long work hours.
* **Storage:** Use shelves, filing cabinets, or modular storage units to keep the workspace organized.

**Design Suggestion:** Add greenery or decor items to make your home office feel inviting and creative.

# Kitchen and Bar Areas: Casual Elegance

For kitchens and bar spaces, functionality meets style with the right furniture.

* **Kitchen Islands:** If your kitchen includes an island, add bar stools in Dubai for extra seating. Look for stools with adjustable heights and footrests for maximum comfort.
* **Storage:** Incorporate wall-mounted shelves or storage carts to maximize space in compact kitchens.
* **Decor:** Enhance the aesthetic with pendant lighting and a few decorative items like vases or jars.

**Styling Note:** Choose bar stools that match your kitchen's theme, whether it's industrial, rustic, or minimalist.

# Entryway: First Impressions Matter

Your entryway is the first glimpse guests get of your home, so make it count with functional and stylish furniture.

* **Console Tables:** A slim metal table works perfectly in narrow entryways, providing a spot for keys, mail, or decor items.
* **Seating:** Add a small bench or stool for convenience.
* **Storage:** Wall-mounted hooks or a chic storage unit can keep things organized.

then, a couple hours after waking up (now) i feel mild nausea. i think? my stomach is burning slightly, and i have butterflies in my stomach but like, in a bad way, and the choking feeling is back in my throat and chest and i had a mostly solid but slightly loose bm after this feeling started. i had greasy food for lunch today, fried chicken and jojos after days of barely eating anything so i‚Äôm logically trying to assume that‚Äôs it and it‚Äôs just reflux, but i had so many ‚Äúclose calls‚Äù earlier and even now (aka nearly gagging) but never tu.

i‚Äôm terrified and usually i call my mom, but she isn‚Äôt awake. 

i just don‚Äôt want to tu. i‚Äôm not at the point where i‚Äôm ready to accept that.

In November, he became increasingly distant and told me he‚Äôs not ready for a relationship because he was stressed about family and work (he had just quit his job) and I told him I needed someone who can be fully present and be considerate in their communicate. We ended things amicably but somewhat abruptly. 

After about a month I felt some regret about ending things without communicating how I felt and reached out to him to revisit this conversation and expressed this to him, which was extremely out of my comfort zone since I‚Äôm normally not a vulnerable person. He was receptive and we made vague plans to meet for coffee ‚Äî- he then didn‚Äôt answer for 10 days and then reached back out continuing the conversation like nothing happened. I called him out and gave him an out, I said his silence made me question whether he wanted to meet and I want to meet only if he wants to talk too, not out of obligation just because I asked. He doubled down and said he wanted to meet, this time he said for breakfast. I agreed and told him to pick a place and left it at that. He then texted the day before we were supposed to meet and asked to reschedule, and then stated we could go to dinner. It‚Äôs been about three weeks since I sent that initial message and it feels SO drawn out now. 

At this point I‚Äôm wondering if I should just cut my losses because his actions are showing me I‚Äôm not a priority, but I gave him an out and then how he keeps upping the ante of coffee to breakfast to dinner, which is confusing me? 

Please be blunt with me. Am I being delusional or should I just cut my losses and stop answering?

1i5lxl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLGBT/comments/1i5lxl4/my_best_friend_was_my_anchor_i_thought_nothing/,"My best friend was my anchor. I thought nothing could break the bond between us. Then one moment changed everything, and now he‚Äôs gone. Was I wrong?","This story has been weighing on my mind for a long time. It‚Äôs about a friendship that meant everything to me, the painful moment I risked it all for honesty and the struggles with the consequences that followed.

MAK (bff, cover name) and I first met in college, sharing a few classes. We didn‚Äôt connect deeply at first, but over time, our paths crossed more often. Conversations started casually‚Äîcomplaining about the stress of college or our shared frustration with the overwhelming expectations placed on us. What started as small talk turned into deeper discussions about life, family, and dreams for the future. MAK wasn‚Äôt the loud, boisterous type. He was calm, and grounded, and had a way of making everything feel less chaotic, even when the world often felt like too much.

MAK had this quiet confidence that I deeply admired. Where I wrestled with my own storm of emotions and overthinking, he carried himself with a steadiness that felt like an anchor, and the best thing about him was that he was unapologetically himself. He wasn‚Äôt one to force his presence or opinions but had this ability to simply¬†*be there*¬†in a way that made you feel seen. His calm nature was reassuring, and it contrasted so strongly with the noise in my own mind that I found myself gravitating toward him. He had a closeness to his family that I envied‚Äîa warmth and stability that I lacked in my own life. There were moments, small but significant, where he‚Äôd hold a hug just a little longer or look at me with a depth that made me wonder if he understood me better than anyone else. MAK wasn‚Äôt just a friend; he was the balance to my chaos, someone who brought clarity to my most overwhelming thoughts.

I didn‚Äôt notice it immediately, but he slowly became the person I trusted most. We started spending time together outside of school, grabbing coffee or sitting for hours talking about everything. He had a way of listening that made me feel heard that I hadn‚Äôt experienced before.

I remember one day vividly, venting to him about some serious family issues I had, and the fact that I was not only into women and still adjusting to that. He didn‚Äôt try to fix it or offer advice; he just said, ‚ÄúI get it. It sucks, but you‚Äôll get through it. You‚Äôre stronger than you think.‚Äù It was the way he said it, with such quiet conviction, that stuck with me. For someone like me, always overthinking and doubting myself, that kind of reassurance meant everything.

I fell in love with MAK because he made me feel seen in a way no one else had. He had this rare ability to sit with my chaos without trying to fix it, to listen without judgment, and to let me be vulnerable without making me feel weak. It wasn‚Äôt just his words but his presence‚Äîthe way he could calm me just by being there. I admired his steadiness, his ability to handle life without overthinking, and the quiet strength he exuded. MAK represented everything I wanted more of in my life: clarity, calm, and confidence.

What really deepened my feelings, though, was how he accepted me fully. When I came out to him, he didn‚Äôt flinch or act uncomfortable. He simply said he was proud of me for sharing. That moment meant the world to me because it showed me that MAK wasn‚Äôt just a friend‚Äîhe was someone who genuinely cared. The way he treated me, the way he listened and supported me, made me feel like maybe, just maybe, there was a chance he saw me as more than a friend too.

As we grew closer, I started noticing little things‚Äîthings that made me wonder if maybe he felt something more too. He didn‚Äôt talk about girls the way most guys in college did. In fact, he avoided the topic entirely. And when I came out to him as gay, he didn‚Äôt even flinch. He just listened and said he was glad I trusted him. He‚Äôd also do things that felt different‚Äîlike holding hugs a little longer than necessary or texting me out of the blue to say he misses hanging out. Sometimes I‚Äôd catch him looking at me in a way that felt more intimate than just friendship. Those moments, however small, gave me hope.

But hope is a fragile thing, and I knew I might be projecting my own feelings onto him. As much as I wanted to believe there could be something more, the fear of being wrong kept me silent for a long time. By the time my feelings were undeniable, keeping them hidden started to feel unbearable. Every time I saw him, I felt this ache‚Äîa mix of joy and pain because I couldn‚Äôt tell him the truth.

I debated walking away, trying to create distance so I could sort out my emotions. But the idea of losing him, even as a friend, was unthinkable. I convinced myself that being honest was the only way forward, even if it came with risks. It wasn‚Äôt about expecting him to feel the same; it was about the weight of carrying something so big, so personal, and so painful.

One evening, we were at my house, sitting in my room. We were talking about our plans after college, tossing around ideas about where we‚Äôd go and what we‚Äôd do. The conversation felt light and easy, but I could feel my heart pounding. I was terrified, but I knew it was time. ‚ÄúMAK,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something I need to tell you.‚Äù

He looked at me, calm as always, and nodded for me to continue. I took a deep breath and said: ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in love with you.‚Äù

There was silence, and for a moment, I thought maybe I‚Äôd made the biggest mistake of my life. Then he sighed, and his expression softened. ‚ÄúI care about you so much,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think I can be what you want me to be. There‚Äôs no need to cry, it‚Äôs just a rejection‚Äù

Those words hit me harder than I expected. I tried to hold myself together, nodding as he explained that he‚Äôd never seen me that way. He said he valued our friendship and didn‚Äôt want to lose it, but he couldn‚Äôt lie to me or himself. I understood, but it didn‚Äôt make the rejection any easier. It wasn‚Äôt just the loss of hope that hurt‚Äîit was the fear that I‚Äôd ruined everything between us.

After my confession, it all ended abruptly. MAK made it clear that we couldn‚Äôt continue as friends. He told me that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move on or get over him if we stayed in each other‚Äôs lives. His words were final, and there wasn‚Äôt room for negotiation. Losing him at that moment felt like losing a part of myself. He wasn‚Äôt just my best friend‚Äîhe was my anchor, the person who made me feel safe in a world that often felt overwhelming. And now, that sense of safety was gone.

It wasn‚Äôt just the heartbreak of rejection‚Äîit was the suddenness of it all. One moment, he was someone I trusted with everything and the next, he was out of my life completely. The emptiness he left behind was suffocating. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd ruined everything by being honest, but at the same time, I couldn‚Äôt ignore how much his response hurt me.

In the months that followed, I wrestled with guilt and regret. Should I have kept my feelings to myself? Was I selfish for confessing? Had I misread everything? The doubt was suffocating‚Ä¶

During this time, I found solace in an online community on skool for gay men where people shared their struggles, heartbreaks, and triumphs. The community was called Gay Unmasked, Reading their stories helped me realize I wasn‚Äôt alone. One post, in particular, stood out to me. Someone wrote, ‚ÄúHonesty might cost you, but it sets you free.‚Äù That hit me hard because it was true. Telling MAK how I felt wasn‚Äôt just about him‚Äîit was about being true to myself, even if it meant risking rejection.

But even now, I can‚Äôt shake the ache of losing him. It‚Äôs a dull, constant pain that resurfaces in quiet moments‚Äîwhen I hear a song we used to love, or when I pass the places we used to go. The silence between us feels deafening, and I wonder if I‚Äôll ever truly get over him.

Some nights, the weight of it all becomes too much. I lie awake, replaying every moment, every word, asking myself the same unanswerable question:¬†*Should I have done something differently?*¬†The thought claws at me, leaving me gasping for air, desperate for a way to undo what‚Äôs already been done. We go to the college together too so I have to see him every single day, and he doesn't even look at me or say hi even if I do.

The community has been my saving grace, but the truth is, there are moments when even that isn‚Äôt enough. Moments when the darkness creeps in, whispering that I‚Äôm unlovable, that my feelings will always push people away. Moments when I wonder if life would feel easier without the constant ache.

And now I‚Äôm left asking you, Reddit:¬†*What would you have done in my shoes? Should I have kept my feelings to myself? Was I selfish for confessing, or was it better to be honest, no matter the cost?*

Where I wrestled with my own storm of emotions and overthinking, he carried himself with a steadiness that felt like an anchor, and the best thing about him was that he was unapologetically himself. He wasn‚Äôt one to force his presence or opinions but had this ability to simply¬†*be there*¬†in a way that made you feel seen. His calm nature was reassuring, and it contrasted so strongly with the noise in my own mind that I found myself gravitating toward him. He had a closeness to his family that I envied‚Äîa warmth and stability that I lacked in my own life. There were moments, small but significant, where he‚Äôd hold a hug just a little longer or look at me with a depth that made me wonder if he understood me better than anyone else. MAK wasn‚Äôt just a friend; he was the balance to my chaos, someone who brought clarity to my most overwhelming thoughts.

I didn‚Äôt notice it immediately, but he slowly became the person I trusted most. We started spending time together outside of school, grabbing coffee or sitting for hours talking about everything. He had a way of listening that made me feel heard that I hadn‚Äôt experienced before.

I remember one day vividly, venting to him about some serious family issues I had, and the fact that I was not only into women and still adjusting to that. He didn‚Äôt try to fix it or offer advice; he just said, ‚ÄúI get it. It sucks, but you‚Äôll get through it. You‚Äôre stronger than you think.‚Äù It was the way he said it, with such quiet conviction, that stuck with me. For someone like me, always overthinking and doubting myself, that kind of reassurance meant everything.

I fell in love with MAK because he made me feel seen in a way no one else had. He had this rare ability to sit with my chaos without trying to fix it, to listen without judgment, and to let me be vulnerable without making me feel weak. It wasn‚Äôt just his words but his presence‚Äîthe way he could calm me just by being there. I admired his steadiness, his ability to handle life without overthinking, and the quiet strength he exuded. MAK represented everything I wanted more of in my life: clarity, calm, and confidence.

What really deepened my feelings, though, was how he accepted me fully. When I came out to him, he didn‚Äôt flinch or act uncomfortable. He simply said he was proud of me for sharing. That moment meant the world to me because it showed me that MAK wasn‚Äôt just a friend‚Äîhe was someone who genuinely cared. The way he treated me, the way he listened and supported me, made me feel like maybe, just maybe, there was a chance he saw me as more than a friend too.

As we grew closer, I started noticing little things‚Äîthings that made me wonder if maybe he felt something more too. He didn‚Äôt talk about girls the way most guys in college did. In fact, he avoided the topic entirely. And when I came out to him as gay, he didn‚Äôt even flinch. He just listened and said he was glad I trusted him. He‚Äôd also do things that felt different‚Äîlike holding hugs a little longer than necessary or texting me out of the blue to say he misses hanging out. Sometimes I‚Äôd catch him looking at me in a way that felt more intimate than just friendship. Those moments, however small, gave me hope.

But hope is a fragile thing, and I knew I might be projecting my own feelings onto him. As much as I wanted to believe there could be something more, the fear of being wrong kept me silent for a long time. By the time my feelings were undeniable, keeping them hidden started to feel unbearable. Every time I saw him, I felt this ache‚Äîa mix of joy and pain because I couldn‚Äôt tell him the truth.

I debated walking away, trying to create distance so I could sort out my emotions. But the idea of losing him, even as a friend, was unthinkable. I convinced myself that being honest was the only way forward, even if it came with risks. It wasn‚Äôt about expecting him to feel the same; it was about the weight of carrying something so big, so personal, and so painful.

One evening, we were at my house, sitting in my room. We were talking about our plans after college, tossing around ideas about where we‚Äôd go and what we‚Äôd do. The conversation felt light and easy, but I could feel my heart pounding. I was terrified, but I knew it was time. ‚ÄúMAK,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something I need to tell you.‚Äù

He looked at me, calm as always, and nodded for me to continue. I took a deep breath and said: ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in love with you.‚Äù

There was silence, and for a moment, I thought maybe I‚Äôd made the biggest mistake of my life. Then he sighed, and his expression softened. ‚ÄúI care about you so much,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt think I can be what you want me to be. There‚Äôs no need to cry, it‚Äôs just a rejection‚Äù

Those words hit me harder than I expected. I tried to hold myself together, nodding as he explained that he‚Äôd never seen me that way. He said he valued our friendship and didn‚Äôt want to lose it, but he couldn‚Äôt lie to me or himself. I understood, but it didn‚Äôt make the rejection any easier. It wasn‚Äôt just the loss of hope that hurt‚Äîit was the fear that I‚Äôd ruined everything between us.

After my confession, it all ended abruptly. MAK made it clear that we couldn‚Äôt continue as friends. He told me that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move on or get over him if we stayed in each other‚Äôs lives. His words were final, and there wasn‚Äôt room for negotiation. Losing him at that moment felt like losing a part of myself. He wasn‚Äôt just my best friend‚Äîhe was my anchor, the person who made me feel safe in a world that often felt overwhelming. And now, that sense of safety was gone.

It wasn‚Äôt just the heartbreak of rejection‚Äîit was the suddenness of it all. One moment, he was someone I trusted with everything and the next, he was out of my life completely. The emptiness he left behind was suffocating. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôd ruined everything by being honest, but at the same time, I couldn‚Äôt ignore how much his response hurt me.

In the months that followed, I wrestled with guilt and regret. Should I have kept my feelings to myself? Was I selfish for confessing? Had I misread everything? The doubt was suffocating‚Ä¶

During this time, I found solace in an online community on skool for gay men where people shared their struggles, heartbreaks, and triumphs. The community was called Gay Unmasked, Reading their stories helped me realize I wasn‚Äôt alone. One post, in particular, stood out to me. Someone wrote, ‚ÄúHonesty might cost you, but it sets you free.‚Äù That hit me hard because it was true. Telling MAK how I felt wasn‚Äôt just about him‚Äîit was about being true to myself, even if it meant risking rejection.

But even now, I can‚Äôt shake the ache of losing him. It‚Äôs a dull, constant pain that resurfaces in quiet moments‚Äîwhen I hear a song we used to love, or when I pass the places we used to go. The silence between us feels deafening, and I wonder if I‚Äôll ever truly get over him.

Some nights, the weight of it all becomes too much. I lie awake, replaying every moment, every word, asking myself the same unanswerable question:¬†*Should I have done something differently?*¬†The thought claws at me, leaving me gasping for air, desperate for a way to undo what‚Äôs already been done. We go to the college together too so I have to see him every single day, and he doesn't even look at me or say hi even if I do.

The community has been my saving grace, but the truth is, there are moments when even that isn‚Äôt enough. Moments when the darkness creeps in, whispering that I‚Äôm unlovable, that my feelings will always push people away. Moments when I wonder if life would feel easier without the constant ache.

And now I‚Äôm left asking you, Reddit:¬†*What would you have done in my shoes? Should I have kept my feelings to myself? Was I selfish for confessing, or was it better to be honest, no matter the cost?*

Last week, I met this guy at a rave. We spent the night dancing, kissing, and just vibing‚Äîit felt magnetic. We‚Äôre both into D/s dynamics (he‚Äôs a Dom, and I‚Äôm a sub, but I‚Äôm not experienced at all). He asked for my Instagram, and we talked for a couple of days before agreeing to go for coffee this week to get to know each other better.

A couple of days ago, he asked me what I was looking for in him. I told him I didn‚Äôt have anything concrete in mind, just that I wanted to get to know him and see how we flow. He then opened up about going through some medical anxiety issues and said that he‚Äôs afraid he couldn‚Äôt give 100% to ""us"" right now.

However, he still wants to be friends, go out with me, and even attend raves together. He‚Äôs super knowledgeable about music and wants to share that with me. Regarding the D/s dynamic, he said he‚Äôd be happy to explore it if I decide to, but it‚Äôs entirely my call. He was clear, though, that he‚Äôd want us to stay friends afterward. But is up to me to decide if we go there or not.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm conflicted:  Could it be that he‚Äôs lost interest in me?  He mentioned that he‚Äôs a commitment-oriented guy, but because of his anxiety, he can‚Äôt start anything serious right now.

I cant say im looking for a relationship either but i cant help to still feel the initial attraction and wonder where things could go, in the future.

Are there couples that start out as we did friends that feel attraction and maybe become more in the future?

1i5lvko,https://www.reddit.com/r/goatravel/comments/1i5lvko/my_first_goa_trip_completed_tips_for_you/,My first Goa trip completed | Tips for you,"Me and my wife Visited Goa between Jan12 to 17 and I have some recommendations and tips for you if your planning for Goa trip in near days. 

Chapter One | My Experience

while planning for a Goa trip, I had been going through lots of stories over social media about the scams in Goa and the Goans nature. Thankfully, Goans I met during my trip are so welcoming. I have spoken with the taxi driver in one and half hour journey about Goan food and places to visit. He is so humble and respecting. The owner of a rrsturunt opposite to my resort is also kind and welcoming. We had  really enjoyed the whole trip and this will be a good memory in my life. 

Chapter Two | Itenary

Our trip is between Jan12 to Jan17 where we spent 5 days in South Goa and 1 day in north Goa.  We are not intrested in parties or pubs and always looks for Nature and untouched places for pleasent ambience. So ee decided to cover entire south Goa. I have booked a resort in Agonda beach and the reason is Agonda beach is the center of south Goa belt. If we go left side, there are Palolem beach, Galgibaga beach and if we go right cola, kakolem, caboderama. 

Places we visited:
Beaches: 
Agonda beach - As per my experience, this beach is best for accomadation because of less people, clean, calm, blue water, connectivity, welcoming people. You can enjoy kayaking in beach for 500rs an hour.

Palolem beach - Palolem beach is like another baga beach. This is the only beach in south where you find huge crowd and I recemmend just one hour to spend here. You can experience Night market here for shopping.

Galgibaga beach - I can say this beach is best in entire south goa because of less crowd and untouched beach. We went to this beach at 2:00 PM and we spend most of the time in water. This beach is populary known for turtle mating. We haven't noticed turtles mating in entire beach, so we have mated each other and that fulfilled our fantacy ""sex on beach"". At 6 PM almost beach is empty and we had our moment in the woods and at seashore. 

Kakolem Beach - You have to do a 20 mins trek to reach this beach and popular for its sharp rocks around the beach. I was exhausted while taking srtairs while returning beach. You can stil visit this beach if you are fit unlike me.

Cabo de rama - Your Goa trip is incomplete withiut going here. The view points are mesmerising. You feel yourself sitting on arabian sea. 

Pebbles Beach - I personally don't like this beach as the seashore is very small and nothing special.

cola beach - Enjoy kayaking on backwaters of cola beach. I recommend you to try kayaking on both sea and lake. Kayaking on sea you will enjoy a lot where you can find in Agonda beach. We really had a best experience.

Butterfly beach - This is the most beautiful beach and the two hills at the shore looks like a butterfly wings. I recommend you to visit this beach only by trekking not by a boat. Start to this beach at 5:00 or 6 AM snd trek for 15 mins. Enjoy the alone time.

Arombol Beach - Yucky!
Baga Beach - Yucky!
Calangute - Yucky!
Anjuna - Yucky!

Natreveli wild life sanctury - Must visit!
The mountains, forest way is mesmerising. You can visit Natreveli waterfalls also known as salva waterfalls which is soo beautiful and less crowded. There are couple of other water falls around this location you can explore. Just keep your feet in this waterfall and enjoy free fish spa.

Bud bud lake - On the way to Natreveli wild life sanctury you can find this lake with a temple. The lake is famous for bubbles randomly comes from this lake. There are soo many fishes in this lake and wate is clear but not drinkable

I haven't found a single piece of debris in south Goa. But in north beached you may find pan wrappers, bottles, plastic objects in shore or sometime floating on the sea.

If you are a Nature lover, stick to south.

Visit North beaches only if there are adventure activities planned in your itenary. There are no adventure sports or water activities in entire south goa except kayaking. I have visited one beach one day in south Goa. But when I visited North Goa, I've covered Anjunr, baga, calangute in less than 6 hours.

Chapter Three | Travel

If anything that is pulling Goa tourism back is travel. Travel is really expensive and most of the scames happening in Travel and popularly known as taxi mafia. You may also find Taxis demanding 2k for a 4km ride. We have arrived Dabolim airport in the morning and looked for rental bikes around airport. There are no rental bikes available near airport, So I have booked a cab from Goa miles app. Goa miles app is official and less scope  of scams. After reaching resort, I have took a scooty for rent for 500 a day and started to roaming around. After spending 5 days in south Goa, I wanted to visit North Goa and when I called a taxi after seeing a random banner on road. He demanded 5k to travel from South to North. In Goamiles app, it is 2400rs. You must rent a scooty for inside travel. If it is more than 50kms opt for Goa miles.

Chapter Four | Food, Restrunts/cafes

No matter what food you order in entire goa, make a habbit of saying ""make it salty and spicy"" to the waiter. Because the chefs in goa considers foreigners taste while cooking any dishes and they dont eat spicy food. As a south Indian I need more spice in food. We are not a foodies and not intrested to explore food. We tried ros omlette and it became my favourite, tried fish tali but I just like fish, tali is average. I'm just filter coffee type lf person on not a capussino guy. So never explored any cafes.  

As a beer lover, tried all types of beer:
Peoples, maka, koings,..

Final Chapter | Tips

‚Ä¢ Don't push yourself to visit every place in Goa in few days. If you plan to cover three beaches in a single day, you cannot remember anyone. Spend more time in one beach a day.
‚Ä¢ Always wear helmet. Thankfully police in Goa are soo strict. I have paid 1k fine for not wearing helmet.
‚Ä¢ Shopping is not that great as the items they sell are same in every shop. These are the items only for shopping: handbags, dressess, lucky stones, eye catchers made with wool, fridge magnets, cigars. Nothing apart from these.
‚Ä¢ Dont drink and drive
‚Ä¢ Visit viewpoints
‚Ä¢ Always carry a tiny bag which holds your mobile, wallet. Make sure to carry ziplock bags with you.
‚Ä¢ Goa is too hot and himid now. Light clothes, sunglasses are must
‚Ä¢ Goamiles should be the fist option if you travel from south to north. But from North Goa there are only few drivers using Goamiles and taxi mafia is at peak in North Goa.
‚Ä¢ Must try paramotoring in Arombol beach for 4k
. People beer in an ordinary shop 90rs, In a restrunt 190 rs, in a bar and restrunt 250, in a pub like leapord valley 450rs

It sets the mood, enhances functionality, and highlights the style of your space. Whether you‚Äôre aiming for a cozy living room or a functional kitchen, the right lighting can transform any room. Let‚Äôs explore how to select the perfect lighting for every part of your home while incorporating [unique pendant lamps](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), [modern pendant lighting](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights), and other striking options.

# 1. Living Room: Layered Lighting for Versatility

The living room is a multipurpose space, often used for relaxation, entertaining, and family gatherings. To accommodate these functions, opt for layered lighting that includes ambient, task, and accent lighting.

* **Top Tip:** Install unique pendant lamps as a focal point in the center of the room or above the coffee table to add character and style.
* Add table lamps or wall sconces for cozy, task-specific lighting when reading or watching TV.

# 2. Dining Room: Statement Lighting Above the Table

The dining room is where lighting truly shines‚Äîliterally. A stunning fixture above the dining table not only provides illumination but also acts as a design centerpiece.

* **Best Choice:** Consider modern pendant lighting with clean lines or metallic finishes to create a contemporary vibe.
* Use dimmable hanging ceiling lights to adjust the brightness for intimate dinners or lively gatherings.

# 3. Kitchen: Practical Yet Stylish Lighting

The kitchen demands functional lighting that enhances visibility for cooking and prep work. However, that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be stylish!

* Install [hanging ceiling lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/lighting/pendant-lights) or a series of pendant lamps over the kitchen island to combine practicality with elegance.
* Use under-cabinet lighting to brighten workspaces and avoid shadows while chopping or mixing.

# 4. Bedroom: Soft Lighting for a Relaxing Ambiance

Lighting in the bedroom should create a serene and calming environment, perfect for unwinding after a long day.

* Opt for bedside pendant lights to save space and provide task lighting for reading.
* Unique pendant lamps with a warm glow can add a touch of sophistication to your bedroom decor.

# 5. Bathroom: Bright Yet Balanced Lighting

Bathrooms require functional lighting for tasks like grooming, but harsh light can feel overwhelming. Balance is key.

* Place sconces or hanging ceiling lights on either side of the mirror for even illumination.
* For a spa-like feel, consider dimmable lighting or modern pendant lighting in muted tones.

# 6. Outdoor Spaces: Extend Your Living Area

Outdoor lighting is essential for creating a welcoming and safe environment around your home.

* [Outside hanging lights](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/lighting/outdoor-pendant-lights) are perfect for patios, balconies, or garden spaces, adding ambiance while ensuring visibility.
* Use weather-resistant pendant lamps or string lights to infuse charm and functionality into your outdoor areas.

# Tips for Choosing the Right Lighting

1. **Scale Matters:** Always consider the size of the room and the height of your ceiling. Oversized pendant lights can overwhelm small spaces, while tiny fixtures may get lost in larger rooms.
2. **Coordinate with Decor:** Match the finish and style of your lights to the overall theme of the room for a cohesive look.
3. **Layer Your Lighting:** Combine ambient, task, and accent lighting for a balanced and dynamic atmosphere.

**Why Choose Pendant Lighting?**

Pendant lighting is a versatile and stylish option that works in virtually every room. Whether you‚Äôre drawn to unique pendant lamps with intricate designs or sleek modern pendant lighting, these fixtures offer a perfect blend of functionality and artistry. They work beautifully in clusters, single installations, or even as part of layered lighting plans.

**Elevate Your Lighting Game**

The right lighting not only enhances the functionality of your home but also reflects your personal style. From hanging ceiling lights in the kitchen to outside hanging lights for your outdoor spaces, there‚Äôs a perfect option for every corner of your home.

I woke up to my alarm blaring and I groaned. It was a work day and the return to a bit of normalcy was appreciated, but I was still very tired. I was tempted to hit snooze, but I decided to get up and get going. I had not slept well as I spent much of my night wondering what to do about my new friend. Despite the innocent facade, I worried just what Matilda would be capable of. She was possessed of a childlike innocence and desire to please. Yet she also had a ruthless disregard for human life beyond who she proclaimed were her ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù



My concerns had to wait for the moment, I had to get to work. I was preparing a quick breakfast to go when I heard something from the living room. I stepped inside and saw Matilda on the shelf where I had left her. She wore a sad expression and there were strange streaks on her cheeks, almost like a woman who had too much makeup on was crying and leaving trails on her face.



I asked her,



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Matilda?‚Äù



I heard the soft almost imperceptible whimpering continue for a short moment and then she responded.



‚ÄúOh, good morning, well it‚Äôs nothing. It....it's just that it gets very lonely in the dark and on this shelf all by myself at night. I was wondering if maybe I could be in the room with you at night. It would be a lot less scary and it would make me feel better. You don‚Äôt have to if you don't want, I just think it would be nice.‚Äù Once again, my reservations of the danger of the psychic doll took a back seat to my sympathy and I felt bad she had been scared. I also felt guilty I had not thought of it earlier and I told her,



‚ÄúOf course, I am sorry I had not thought of that. That would be just fine Matilda.‚Äù



I heard a strange squeal sound, like the adulation of a young child and then she spoke again,



‚ÄúYou mean it? I promise I won‚Äôt be any bother.‚Äù I assured her,



‚ÄúIt is fine yes, but I have to get going to work now. Will you be okay here for a while, at least while I am gone?‚Äù I was surprised I was asking and I found despite my previous concerns, that I was genuinely considering her feelings before acting.



There was a sound like mumbling and then another soft appeal,



‚ÄúWell, if it would be alright, I thought I might tag along and maybe stay in your backpack. You could talk to me on your breaks and then I would not have to be alone here with all the voices.....‚Äù I was not sure about that request. I was worried what might happen if Matilda got any ideas about my coworkers telling lies, and how they should be punished accordingly.



I was about to decline her request when I looked back up from my contemplation and saw her face had shifted to a design of hopeful anticipation. Her eyes were bright and shiny and her smile was wide and waiting. I relented and rather than deny her request, I decided to let her come along, just this once to my work. I was already forgetting that she had gotten a man killed just yesterday.



‚ÄúOh alright, just for today to see how it goes. But please be good.‚Äù



Matilda agreed readily and we were off to work.



It was a short drive to my work and I rode on with Matilda riding in my backpack, the back opened and her head poking out so she could see things as we drove. We arrived and I turned back to her and reminded her,



‚ÄúRemember be good, okay?‚Äù I heard something odd that might have been a childlike grumble of acceptance and then a sweet and compliant answer of,



‚ÄúYes of course, thanks again for taking me with you. You are the best friend ever.‚Äù



We stepped inside and I went straight for my desk. I worked as an insurance underwriter for a small industrial insurance company. It paid well but like all insurance companies, the profit motive was king and as such, the company was not shy about any tactic to save a buck. The fear of losing our jobs kept a near constant aura of paranoia and suspicion in the office chatter. Chatter which I will admit I partook of from time to time, but often tried to avoid. It would be difficult to ignore any intrigue with a mind reading doll in my backpack, ready and eager to divulge my coworkers darkest secrets.



I walked straight past James and Kathy talking about something they had been doing on the week end and avoided direct eye contact with Bridget, who I knew would try and fill me in on the details of who she suspected was on Mr. Langdons shit list and who might be getting the axe next.



As I sat down and booted up my computer, I heard a familiar voice in my ear.



‚ÄúHeya man, how was the weekend? Mine was great I met a new lady friend and let‚Äôs just say we hit it off big time, if you know what I mean.‚Äù It was Gary, a very friendly but slightly oversharing person. I sometimes spoke with him about random things, but often I tried to keep my head down at work even before a day like today.



I politely responded as I often did, with an attempt at what the business tried to discourage in sales calls, a close ended statement.



‚ÄúJust fine thanks, glad yours was as well. Have to get to work, thanks Gary.‚Äù Gary shrugged and walked away and as he left, I heard a murmur in my mind. She was doing it again,



‚ÄúWhy would your friend pay someone for that?‚Äù I was confused and asked Matilda,



‚ÄúFor what? What do you mean?‚Äù There was a pause and Matilda spoke again,



‚ÄúHe paid his new friend he was speaking about, to do things with him and then she left and he paid her money. Is that what friends are supposed to do?‚Äù I sighed and realized that Matilda had seen Gary‚Äôs transaction with his new lady friend and I realized that their meeting was not quite as organic as Gary suggested. Matilda chimed in again and was about to go into more details when I cut her off.



‚ÄúNo thank you Matilda, I don‚Äôt need to know more about Gary‚Äôs prostitute.‚Äù Another delay and I sighed as I anticipated the next question,



‚ÄúWhat is a prostitute? Is it a kind of friend.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why but I responded in the same way a parent might to an awkward question from their kid by saying,



‚ÄúI'll tell you when you are older. Let's leave it for now.‚Äù I heard an acknowledgement and I got back to work.



After an hour or so I looked up from my computer and saw the face of my boss Mr. Langdon leering down at me. He interrupted me by loudly clearing his throat and spoke,



‚ÄúDid you get Kelso account reviewed yet?‚Äù He grinned down at me with barely disguised impatience and I looked at my log for the day and saw the name further down my list. I responded,



‚ÄúYeah, I will take care of it, why did they call? Did I need to expedite that one?‚Äù I should not have asked, since I saw the condescending look, he gave when someone asked a question he viewed as stupid. His face curled into a sarcastic smile and he said,



‚ÄúYes, expedite it pretty please with cherries on top. Not sure why I have to ask. You gotta be careful, clueless underwriters might be at risk. Gotta stay on top of it and be proactive.‚Äù He shot me one last annoying grin and walked away. I was upset by the indirect if not insulting exchange. Langdon was always a little passive aggressive, but today seemed like it was worse than usual. Then as if sensing my distress, I heard Matilda faintly in my mind and I knew she would not let the verbal slight go unanswered. I tried to tell her to stop but she was already away. I prayed she would not too anything too crazy.



After five minutes I felt her presence stirring again. I bent down and unzipped my backpack and I saw her face with a rictus of anger etched plainly on it. I was considering asking her what she did, but she spoke first,



‚ÄúHe is a bad man. He lies a lot. He lied to his family; he told them he did not know that woman. Then he hurt her and made her go away. He lies to his friends; he steals from them and hurts them too. He also lies to his employees. He is lying right now. He knows something he is not telling you or your friends here. He knows that the company is doing something called a ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù and that all of you will be laid off a month from now. He is the only person who will be moving on to the new company. He was not going to tell anyone until it was closer to the time and he would be forced to.‚Äù



My heart sank as I digested what Matilda had told me. That bastard knows we are all going to lose out jobs and he was going to string us all along with hardly any warning. I felt myself getting angry at the revelation and I immediately forgot what happened when Matilda knew something, or someone that made me angry or unhappy.



I had to get out of there, I was panicking at the prospect of losing my job and I did not know what might happen if Matilda recognized that and lashed out at what was making me upset. I stood up and started walking out. I ignored my coworkers questions at what was going on. Unfortunately, Mr. Langdon was near the door, having come back inside from an apparent phone call. He put his phone away and regarded me.



‚ÄúWhere's the fire? I thought I said expedite the Kelso account, not take a coffee break only an hour into your shift. You know it's this kind of attitude that...‚Äù I cut him off and got directly up in his face and told him,



‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just fire me? Or were you waiting for another month to just make it easier and get rid of all of us at once?‚Äù His face turned white and he had no words to respond. The fear on his face validated the truth of what Matilda had said. He really did know and he was not going to tell any of us. He stuttered for some response but I brushed past him and tried to block the inevitable question the perforated my mind shortly afterwards,



‚ÄúCan I make the bad man go away? He seems very heartless but I am sure there is a way I can find the truth, find his truth that makes him feel so bad that he just goes away....forever.‚Äù I found that my anger at the situation dulled the horror of Matilda‚Äôs threat more so than the last few times she offered to ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù. I admit I almost made no effort to stop her, but I just managed a response of,



‚ÄúNo, it is not worth it. Don‚Äôt use his truth to make him go away. Thank you for the offer, Matilda. I just need to go home and start brushing up on my resume. I heard her acknowledgement and she said,



‚ÄúI promise I won't make him do it.‚Äù I realize now, I should have been more specific.



When I got home, I collapsed on my couch. I knew that at some point I would need to get my computer and start looking for a new job. I did not have a lot of time left and I was not expecting to have to be looking so soon. Later that evening I was almost through processing my situation and trying to do something about it. Just then I got a call from an unknown number. I was shocked when I answered and I learned it was the police.

I could barely speak and I was encouraged to come down to the police station to give a proper account if I was not able to on the phone. They had wanted to know if any of his co workers had seen Gary acting strangely that morning or likely any other telling details that could help explain the violent and grizzly outburst.



After I was done with the call, I hung up and walked to the living room. I heard a soft melody humming in my head and I could tell Matilda was very happy. I walked up to her shelf and she had a broad smile on her face. I asked her directly,



‚ÄúWhy did you lie to me? Why did you kill Mr. Langdon!?‚Äù Matilda did not respond at first but the humming song had stopped. I felt an odd static in the air and I looked back as I heard a lightbulb explode in the kitchen. When I looked back there was an odd look on her face again. It looked half triumphant and half guilty. She spoke finally and said,



‚ÄúBut I didn't lie. I promised I wouldn't make him do it. I did not have him do it. I just showed the truth to all of your coworkers. Then after that, that man, Gary the one with the happy prostitute friend, he is the one who did something about it. So, like I said, I didn't lie. I never lie. That man was bad, he lied. Worse, he lied to my friend. I would never lie to my friend. I just want you to be happy.‚Äù



I couldn't believe it, the rationalization was hideous, but technically true. I had no idea what to do about her. I realized it was finally time to get some answers about where my ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù really came from.

1i5logd,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1i5logd/weightloss_nothing_lost_in_a_week/,Weightloss - nothing lost in a week,"Hey all

A bit about me:  
\- 46 years old  
\- 290lbs  
\- 6' tall  
\- Type 2 diabetic (With slow release metformin)

I am using NutraCheck to calorie count - I have it set to a lower carb setting. NutraCheck says I should be eating 2314 calories a day to lose 2lb a week. I am trying to stick below 1800 as I feel 2314 is way too much food.

My usual meals a day are:  
Breakfast - two slices of super-seeded bread (wholegrain) - one with a 1 egg scrambled egg, the other with a teaspoon of peanut butter (whole nut).  
Lunch - Soup / Sandwich / beans on toast + small piece of chocolate (one of those mini-sticks so I know how much)  
Dinner - Chicken + vegetables + piece of chocolate (one of those mini-sticks which are 97 calories)  
Snacks - Pistachio nuts (weighed) / Kiwi  fruit / pear / apple (not all at once)  
Drinks - Coffee (milk, no sugar)

I'm trying to get my cravings for sugar under control hence the chocolate still - but gradually reducing it down. I have gone from 1 sugar in coffee, to half to none too.

Exercise - I am walking about 5000 steps a day at the moment as I am still recovering from shoulder surgery and the weather has been awful, which causes my shoulder to hurt more, but as the weather gets better, I plan  to walk 3mi every lunchtime.

The first week, I lost 5lb and this week I have lost 0lb. I'm convinced it is normal as my body is just holding onto it. NutraCheck is saying I am well below my targets for calories, fat, sugars, carbs etc 

Is this normal? Or is it too early to tell? My wife who is also healthy eating with me, is losing 2lb a week but she's 5'3, 145lb and is on 1200 a day.",1,1737361630.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,1.0,False

1i5ln9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/toaster/comments/1i5ln9z/toaster/,toaster," A few years ago, I had a strange obsession with trying to communicate with inanimate objects. It started innocently enough talking to my coffee machine in the mornings, telling my shoes they were doing a great job holding up my feet, that kind of thing. But one day, I decided to have a full conversation with my toaster. The toaster, for the record, had a very particular look. It was a vintage model, all metal with knobs that clicked when you turned them. It felt like the kind of thing that had seen a lot of bread in its time. So, I decided to ask it about its life, as one does when contemplating their existence. What‚Äôs it like? You spend your whole life toasting bread. Do you ever get bored? To my surprise, the toaster hummed softly, almost as if it was thinking about my question. It clicked again and then responded, in a voice that sounded like a slightly malfunctioning radio. Bored? Oh no, I‚Äôm never bored. I‚Äôve seen things. You wouldn‚Äôt believe the things I‚Äôve seen. Naturally, I was floored. My toaster was talking. And it had stories. I mean, I‚Äôve seen some wild stuff. Last week, a bagel tried to escape, but I caught it just in time. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the waffles. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre a different breed,‚Äù it continued, its metallic voice dropping into a mysterious tone. I sat there, frozen, holding a half-empty mug of coffee, contemplating my life choices, leaning in further, intrigued. You think they‚Äôre just breakfast, but no. They‚Äôre organizing something big. They believe that the crispness of the toast will eventually overthrow all the soft foods. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a lot. I had no idea how to process this. My toaster, it seemed, had a deeper life of its own one involving espionage, secret societies of breakfast foods, and an elaborate plot to overthrow my kitchen routine. Ever since then, I‚Äôve been extra cautious when I toast bread. I can never look at a waffle the same way again. And I swear, every now and then, I hear the toaster whisper, ""I told you so",2,1737361477.0,toaster,0,1.0,False

I was hopeful ya know. I woke up from a great sleep in thinking that I would wake up to messages from loved ones and people I thought were friends. How wrong I was.

10 am - nothing, 11 am still nothing, 12, 1 nope nothing. No phone call, message, txt nothing. I finally get one from my 13 yr old nephew which was sweet but really? Just him. At this point I‚Äôve been crying all day feeling like shit  not worthy of having a special day, that‚Äôs when my parents eventually followed suit. By 4 I decide to peel myself off the couch and take food around to my parents along with a cake. All was going good, I was smiling finally. My mum kept saying ‚Äúcoffee and cake time soon‚Äù which lifted my spirits, in my head candles would be put on my cake and people would come around and sing happy birthday around me. Something so small and normal but means so much. How wrong I was again. No I got told by both my parents that I had to go into the kitchen and cut the cake myself. When I replied ‚Äúreally? No candles atleast?‚Äù I was told I wasn‚Äôt a baby. This really put every happy emotion I had out the door. So not only was I not worthy of people wishing me a happy birthday aka remembering me, know I‚Äôm not even worthy of something so little but sentimental that happens at all ages. I eventually go in the kitchen and get the cake that I bought myself out and plate it, all while trying not to have a mental breakdown. At this time my mum came in saying how pathetic I was not once but continuous times because of how I was feeling about this. That‚Äôs when I dropped the knife and walked out. I haven‚Äôt heard from either parent since.

And now its the next day and I haven‚Äôt left my bed. I‚Äôm in my apartment alone and crying because I truly now realise what I mean to people‚Ä¶. And that truly isn‚Äôt a lot.

I‚Äôm not a materialistic girl. I didn‚Äôt want presents. All I wanted for my birthday was people to remember me, to reach out and say a simple ‚Äúhappy birthday‚Äù and for me to blow out candles. That would have been the perfect birthday for me. And I couldn‚Äôt even get that. 

I‚Äôm so depressed and done.

I woke up to my alarm blaring and I groaned. It was a work day and the return to a bit of normalcy was appreciated, but I was still very tired.  I was tempted to hit snooze, but I decided to get up and get going. I had not slept well as I spent much of my night wondering what to do about my new friend. Despite the innocent facade, I worried just what Matilda would be capable of. She was possessed of a childlike innocence and desire to please. Yet she also had a ruthless disregard for human life beyond who she proclaimed were her ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù  



My concerns had to wait for the moment, I had to get to work. I was preparing a quick breakfast to go when I heard something from the living room. I stepped inside and saw Matilda on the shelf where I had left her. She wore a sad expression and there were strange streaks on her cheeks, almost like a woman who had too much makeup on was crying and leaving trails on her face. 



I asked her, 



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Matilda?‚Äù 



I heard the soft almost imperceptible whimpering continue for a short moment and then she responded. 



‚ÄúOh, good morning, well it‚Äôs nothing. It....it's just that it gets very lonely in the dark and on this shelf all by myself at night. I was wondering if maybe I could be in the room with you at night. It would be a lot less scary and it would make me feel better. You don‚Äôt have to if you don't want, I just think it would be nice.‚Äù Once again, my reservations of the danger of the psychic doll took a back seat to my sympathy and I felt bad she had been scared. I also felt guilty I had not thought of it earlier and I told her, 



‚ÄúOf course, I am sorry I had not thought of that. That would be just fine Matilda.‚Äù 



I heard a strange squeal sound, like the adulation of a young child and then she spoke again, 



‚ÄúYou mean it? I promise I won‚Äôt be any bother.‚Äù I assured her, 



‚ÄúIt is fine yes, but I have to get going to work now. Will you be okay here for a while, at least while I am gone?‚Äù I was surprised I was asking and I found despite my previous concerns, that I was genuinely considering her feelings before acting. 



There was a sound like mumbling and then another soft appeal, 



‚ÄúWell, if it would be alright, I thought I might tag along and maybe stay in your backpack. You could talk to me on your breaks and then I would not have to be alone here with all the voices.....‚Äù I was not sure about that request. I was worried what might happen if Matilda got any ideas about my coworkers telling lies, and how they should be punished accordingly. 



I was about to decline her request when I looked back up from my contemplation and saw her face had shifted to a design of hopeful anticipation. Her eyes were bright and shiny and her smile was wide and waiting. I relented and rather than deny her request, I decided to let her come along, just this once to my work. I was already forgetting that she had gotten a man killed just yesterday. 



‚ÄúOh alright, just for today to see how it goes. But please be good.‚Äù 



Matilda agreed readily and we were off to work. 



It was a short drive to my work and I rode on with Matilda riding in my backpack, the back opened and her head poking out so she could see things as we drove. We arrived and I turned back to her and reminded her, 



‚ÄúRemember be good, okay?‚Äù I heard something odd that might have been a childlike grumble of acceptance and then a sweet and compliant answer of, 



‚ÄúYes of course, thanks again for taking me with you. You are the best friend ever.‚Äù 



We stepped inside and I went straight for my desk. I worked as an insurance underwriter for a small industrial insurance company. It paid well but like all insurance companies, the profit motive was king and as such, the company was not shy about any tactic to save a buck. The fear of losing our jobs kept a near constant aura of paranoia and suspicion in the office chatter. Chatter which I will admit I partook of from time to time, but often tried to avoid. It would be difficult to ignore any intrigue with a mind reading doll in my backpack, ready and eager to divulge my coworkers darkest secrets. 



I walked straight past James and Kathy talking about something they had been doing on the week end and avoided direct eye contact with Bridget, who I knew would try and fill me in on the details of who she suspected was on Mr. Langdons shit list and who might be getting the axe next. 



As I sat down and booted up my computer, I heard a familiar voice in my ear. 



‚ÄúHeya man, how was the weekend? Mine was great I met a new lady friend and let‚Äôs just say we hit it off big time, if you know what I mean.‚Äù It was Gary, a very friendly but slightly oversharing person. I sometimes spoke with him about random things, but often I tried to keep my head down at work even before a day like today.  



I politely responded as I often did, with an attempt at what the business tried to discourage in sales calls, a close ended statement. 



‚ÄúJust fine thanks, glad yours was as well. Have to get to work, thanks Gary.‚Äù Gary shrugged and walked away and as he left, I heard a murmur in my mind. She was doing it again, 



‚ÄúWhy would your friend pay someone for that?‚Äù I was confused and asked Matilda, 



‚ÄúFor what? What do you mean?‚Äù There was a pause and Matilda spoke again, 



‚ÄúHe paid his new friend he was speaking about, to do things with him and then she left and he paid her money. Is that what friends are supposed to do?‚Äù I sighed and realized that Matilda had seen Gary‚Äôs transaction with his new lady friend and I realized that their meeting was not quite as organic as Gary suggested. Matilda chimed in again and was about to go into more details when I cut her off. 



‚ÄúNo thank you Matilda, I don‚Äôt need to know more about Gary‚Äôs prostitute.‚Äù Another delay and I sighed as I anticipated the next question, 



‚ÄúWhat is a prostitute? Is it a kind of friend.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why but I responded in the same way a parent might to an awkward question from their kid by saying, 



‚ÄúI'll tell you when you are older. Let's leave it for now.‚Äù I heard an acknowledgement and I got back to work. 



After an hour or so I looked up from my computer and saw the face of my boss Mr. Langdon leering down at me. He interrupted me by loudly clearing his throat and spoke, 



‚ÄúDid you get Kelso account reviewed yet?‚Äù He grinned down at me with barely disguised impatience and I looked at my log for the day and saw the name further down my list. I responded, 



‚ÄúYeah, I will take care of it, why did they call? Did I need to expedite that one?‚Äù I should not have asked, since I saw the condescending look, he gave when someone asked a question he viewed as stupid. His face curled into a sarcastic smile and he said, 



‚ÄúYes, expedite it pretty please with cherries on top. Not sure why I have to ask. You gotta be careful, clueless underwriters might be at risk. Gotta stay on top of it and be proactive.‚Äù He shot me one last annoying grin and walked away. I was upset by the indirect if not insulting exchange. Langdon was always a little passive aggressive, but today seemed like it was worse than usual. Then as if sensing my distress, I heard Matilda faintly in my mind and I knew she would not let the verbal slight go unanswered. I tried to tell her to stop but she was already away. I prayed she would not too anything too crazy. 



After five minutes I felt her presence stirring again. I bent down and unzipped my backpack and I saw her face with a rictus of anger etched plainly on it. I was considering asking her what she did, but she spoke first, 



‚ÄúHe is a bad man. He lies a lot. He lied to his family; he told them he did not know that woman. Then he hurt her and made her go away. He lies to his friends; he steals from them and hurts them too. He also lies to his employees. He is lying right now. He knows something he is not telling you or your friends here. He knows that the company is doing something called a ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù and that all of you will be laid off a month from now. He is the only person who will be moving on to the new company. He was not going to tell anyone until it was closer to the time and he would be forced to.‚Äù  



My heart sank as I digested what Matilda had told me. That bastard knows we are all going to lose out jobs and he was going to string us all along with hardly any warning. I felt myself getting angry at the revelation and I immediately forgot what happened when Matilda knew something, or someone that made me angry or unhappy. 



I had to get out of there, I was panicking at the prospect of losing my job and I did not know what might happen if Matilda recognized that and lashed out at what was making me upset. I stood up and started walking out. I ignored my coworkers questions at what was going on. Unfortunately, Mr. Langdon was near the door, having come back inside from an apparent phone call. He put his phone away and regarded me. 



‚ÄúWhere's the fire? I thought I said expedite the Kelso account, not take a coffee break only an hour into your shift. You know it's this kind of attitude that...‚Äù I cut him off and got directly up in his face and told him, 



‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just fire me? Or were you waiting for another month to just make it easier and get rid of all of us at once?‚Äù His face turned white and he had no words to respond. The fear on his face validated the truth of what Matilda had said. He really did know and he was not going to tell any of us. He stuttered for some response but I brushed past him and tried to block the inevitable question the perforated my mind shortly afterwards, 



‚ÄúCan I make the bad man go away? He seems very heartless but I am sure there is a way I can find the truth, find his truth that makes him feel so bad that he just goes away....forever.‚Äù I found that my anger at the situation dulled the horror of Matilda‚Äôs threat more so than the last few times she offered to ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù. I admit I almost made no effort to stop her, but I just managed a response of, 



‚ÄúNo, it is not worth it. Don‚Äôt use his truth to make him go away. Thank you for the offer, Matilda. I just need to go home and start brushing up on my resume. I heard her acknowledgement and she said, 



‚ÄúI promise I won't make him do it.‚Äù I realize now, I should have been more specific. 



 



When I got home, I collapsed on my couch. I knew that at some point I would need to get my computer and start looking for a new job. I did not have a lot of time left and I was not expecting to have to be looking so soon. Later that evening I was almost through processing my situation and trying to do something about it. Just then I got a call from an unknown number. I was shocked when I answered and I learned it was the police.  



My jaw almost hit the floor when I learned that I was being contacted for a statement and witness testimony for a crime that occurred at my work. Apparently earlier that day there had been a homicide. The victim was of course my boss Mr. Langdon. The suspect, currently in custody and the reason for the call was to my shock, Gary. He had apparently gone berserk and had stabbed Mr. Langdon thirty two times with a letter opener. I could barely speak and I was encouraged to come down to the police station to give a proper account if I was not able to on the phone. They had wanted to know if any of his co workers had seen Gary acting strangely that morning or likely any other telling details that could help explain the violent and grizzly outburst. 



 



After I was done with the call, I hung up and walked to the living room. I heard a soft melody humming in my head and I could tell Matilda was very happy. I walked up to her shelf and she had a broad smile on her face. I asked her directly, 



‚ÄúWhy did you lie to me? Why did you kill Mr. Langdon!?‚Äù Matilda did not respond at first but the humming song had stopped. I felt an odd static in the air and I looked back as I heard a lightbulb explode in the kitchen. When I looked back there was an odd look on her face again. It looked half triumphant and half guilty. She spoke finally and said, 



‚ÄúBut I didn't lie. I promised I wouldn't make him do it. I did not have him do it. I just showed the truth to all of your coworkers. Then after that, that man, Gary the one with the happy prostitute friend, he is the one who did something about it. So, like I said, I didn't lie. I never lie. That man was bad, he lied. Worse, he lied to my friend. I would never lie to my friend. I just want you to be happy.‚Äù 

I couldn't believe it, the rationalization was hideous, but technically true. I had no idea what to do about her. I realized it was finally time to get some answers about where my ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù really came from. I resolved to go back to that antique store and see just what the hell Matilda was and where she came from. ",2,1737361183.0,u_BadandyTheRed,0,1.0,False
