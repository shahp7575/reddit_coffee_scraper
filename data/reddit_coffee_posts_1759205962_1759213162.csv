1nu5p3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/olfactivechemistry/comments/1nu5p3m/the_global_superpowers_of_the_18th_century_were/,"The global superpowers of the 18th century were literally hunting for whale vomit and deer gland secretions. The ""Age of Discovery"" was partly driven by the quest for perfumes.","
TL;DR: The map of the world was partly drawn by the demand for whale vomit, deer gland secretions, and cat butt goop. The history of exploration has a hidden, deeply funky scent trail.


We think of the Age of Exploration as a quest for gold, spices, and silk. But we're missing a huge, smelly part of the story: the desperate, often brutal hunt for raw materials for perfume.

Before we could synthesize smells in a lab, if you wanted a scent to last, you needed ""fixatives."" And the best ones came from the most disgusting places. We went to the ends of the earth—and nearly drove species to extinction—for these olfactory goldmines.

Exhibit A: Ambergris - ""Floating Gold""

· What it is: A waxy, rock-like substance formed in the intestines of a sperm whale (it's basically a gallstone for squid beaks). It's found floating in the sea or washed up on beaches.
· Why it was wanted: In its aged form, it doesn't smell like poop; it develops a sublime, marine, animalic scent that makes perfume notes ""stick"" to the skin for much longer. It was worth its weight in actual gold. Kings and nobles would pay fortunes for it.
· The Impact: Whaling ships, sponsored by European powers, weren't just hunting whales for oil. They were also on the lookout for this precious intestinal treasure. A single lump of ambergris could make an entire voyage profitable, fueling the expansion of the global whaling industry from the Arctic to the South Pacific.

Exhibit B: Musk - The Scent of Death

· What it is: A reddish, paste-like secretion from a gland in the abdomen of the male Musk Deer, a small deer native to Asia.
· Why it was wanted: Its scent is intensely animalic, sensual, and tenacious. It was the ultimate base note, giving perfumes a warm, skin-like quality. It was also used in medicines.
· The Impact: To get just one pound of musk, you had to kill 30-50 deer. This created a massive, bloody trade network stretching from the Himalayas, through the Silk Road, and into the Middle East and Europe. The Musk Deer was hunted so relentlessly it was nearly wiped out and remains endangered today. The demand for musk literally shaped overland trade for centuries.

Exhibit C: Civet - The Cat Coffee Bean

· What it is: A paste scraped from the anal glands of the Civet Cat.
· Why it was wanted: Like musk, it's intensely fecal in its pure form but becomes floral and alluring when diluted. It was a crucial ingredient for adding depth and animalic warmth.
· The Impact: Sourced primarily from Ethiopia, the civet trade became a key part of East African commerce with the Arab world and later, European colonial powers.

So, what's the big picture?

The desire for a long-lasting perfume directly led to:

· Expanded Whaling: Pushing fleets into uncharted oceans.
· The Exploitation of the ""New World"": Colonial powers were constantly looking for new sources of aromatic materials.
· The Near-Extinction of Species: The Musk Deer is the classic example.
· The Rise of Synthetic Chemistry: The scarcity and brutality of the animal trade directly motivated chemists in the 19th century to create synthetic alternatives, which completely revolutionized perfumery.

It’s totally casual and it’s always been fun and a nice time together. On Friday we went to a concert and did mushrooms and he completely changed, got so weird. At the end when we were trying to leave, he started speaking to me extremely harshly and then when I wanted to walk a different direction, he completely grabbed me and dragged me the way he wanted to go. He did this in front of a ton of people and cops too, and nobody stepped in, which was honestly so much more awful and humiliating on top of the act itself. So I’m pasting the transcription of his voice memo he sent me and I’m wondering if I should reply or if I should just not or if there’s something super snarky and awesome. I can say to tell him to go fuck himself.. He’s rewriting history here he was the one that was completely fucked up and he was the one that completely grabbed me several times to the point that I finally shook myself away from him and said do not touch me ever again like that. It was definitely aggressive and bad. Here’s the text:

I hope you get some help because you need it. Honestly, I do too, but I think you needed a little more. I'm just worried about you. I I just saw some things. I've been seeing some a lot of things in you lately, but like I saw some things that night that I've never seen before we kind of seem to like slip out of reality so I don't know what. If you're taking something else that I don't know, I didn't really feel those mushrooms that much so I don't know but I'm always gonna be here for you, but you know word like it in terms of like partying together and stuff that that's like over. I can't do that anymore cause it's for multiple reasons for my well-being for your well-being and just because I don't want to encourage that behavior anymore but if this is last time we talk I'm really sorry that things end this way.

One is my dad rennovation comany, the other one is a publicy listed aesthetic company in singapore.  This is what i learn  
  
**1. Bite more than you can chew**   
Our space is already filled with rats who bought the Iman Gadzhi course, overpromised, and underdelivered. A lot of our potential clients have already been victims of this — you don’t want to be the next one. My agency went from 5 clients to a team of 80. We couldn’t keep up with the demand for the first 1 and a half months and it was hella stressful. Was it worth it? Fk yes. When I finally figured something out, the feeling was the best.

**2. Results are everything, loyalty is bullshit, end of the day it’s all money**  
  
Business owners stick with you not because they like you (I mean, they must have already liked you to trust you with their money), but because you make them money. They’re not going to stay with you forever just because you guys had a nice coffee or a 50-minute chat. They stick with you because you make them money. Period. Once you can’t, they’re gone.

**3. Partner up with the right people**   
  
Ask yourself: what’s your skill, what do you enjoy doing? Do you like thinking of campaigns, doing marketing research? Or do you like talking to people, selling, and building relationships? There are two parts when it comes to marketing agencies — I call it the chest and the ass. Chest = sales, backside = service delivery. You can’t be good at both. Choose one, keep improving, and find one (or a few) people who are good at the other.

**4. No amount of clients is enough**   
  
When I closed my very first deal, I thought I was on top of the world… until I met people making way more money than me. One of them told me: no matter if you’re making $100k per month or $500 per month, once you stop selling, you’re on your death roll. I couldn’t get more clients in the real estate space because we signed an exclusivity contract with the team.

**5. Hit a bottleneck? Expand/change into other niches**   
  
I couldn’t sign any more clients in the same industry because of the exclusivity contract. Once our backend was stabilized, shit was comfortable as fk. I didn’t have to sell, I didn’t have to worry about money coming in — and that’s when I realized I got too comfortable. That meant it was time to take on another challenge. I helped my dad with lead generation for his home renovation business, and we implemented a few more services for his business.

**6. My goal right now**   
  
A client of my dad recently reached out to me — he runs an aesthetic company that’s publicly listed. I won’t say who because it’s confidential.I want to help my dad with his renovation company and also tap into marketing for the aesthetic industry.

While everything in our campaign is created I did draw some inspiration from the way the town looks and some of its landmarks and local government system.  

The campaign is centered around the Jonah Mangnus Library, a central pillar of the community.  This building is comprised of a central tower (3 floors open to the public) and 2 wings (2 floors), the bottom floor of each wing is comprized of a covered paddio.  
it was built in the 1940's and has burned down twice but somehow always manages to ""spring back up"" its open from 9am- 8pm M-F and Saturday 9:30 am-2pm, and houses approximately 20 staff, run by a very bright an bubbly librarian  by the name or Rosalie Crane.  not including security as for some reason due to its historic location it is often the target of B&E's, fires, and vandalization.

This is the largest public library in the southern half of the state,  and has a cafe, 2 covered outdoor patios, one specifically for children, and a public container garden, the other reserved for quiet.  The library  also houses a state of the art computer lab/lounge complete with a few console set ups and a VR set up.  A huge literary collection complete with approximately 45,000 different volumes (fiction-all types- philosophy, religion, social science, language, history, science- including a specific section for manuscripts and thesis- technical books, young adult novels- including those that might be needed for school curricula- classical literature, financial, arts, references, computer science, cook books/ cuisine and a HUGE kids section) in several languages including braille, about 50 years worth of magazines and periodicals, and thousands of movies, books on tape and music collections including records, cassettes, and CDs- there is a sound room on the third floor, for people to listen to books or music.   Patrons can also rent equipment (record, cassette & CD players, VCR and CD players.  and laptops). Community members most often go at least once a week, grab a coffee/tea/snack at the cafe, socialize or grab a book and sit either in the patio or inside.  There's often tons of children (toddler-teenager) reading/playing/socializing) many people also tend to and teach about the community container garden. Artists can set up and sell/display work on saturdays in wing 1 padio area.  

We have a wonderful cast of player characters:  
Sera Lenore Schnitter- a caring occultist who learns quickly
Eva Moon-a smart occultist who fights dirty
Jack Fleming-a ruthless protector who leads 
Vivian Park- a likeable elocutionist whobworks the back alleys
And Jason Walts- a quick investigator who explores dark places.  

In session 1: Vivian started a new job at the library  and was introduced Eva- the owner of moons, myths and magic occult shop and her employee Sera, who were visiting the library  to retrieve a special order book.  Jason, who was lurking upstairs  distraught when his cort docket was borrowed by Rosalie (this is still a continually running joke).  And Jack, head of security.  Jack qas quickly off to other tasks as he 'kept an eye' on a set of triplets who ""gave him wierd vibes"" (it's also another running joke that Jack doesn't believe in triplets.)

Session 2: Eva and Sera were offered a sale of an odd collection of ancient medical tools from a repeat customer (Macy.)  They found her too suspicious and refused the sale, after a veiled threat and loose threads of information  the pair decided to break into the library  later that evening.  Viv in her primary  role of computer room supervisor, stumbled across a startling collection of internet searches, including ""how to quit a job"" "" can you feel someone looking at you"" ""dont look away she hates that"" amongst others.  Jason, continuing his investigation on a car crash attempts to interigate viv about her potenial invol.  Jack, on the lookout for suspicious people helped a lost child, a old man waiting for a slow elevator,  and helped handle a suspicious bag.  He then stumbled across static filled video footage of the triplets from the day before.  Chasing them back into the elevator, they introduced themselves and begged Jack not to tell Rosalie about them 'coming out too early' Jack overwhelmed with claustrophobia and panic clawed his way out of the elevator  about 4 hours after he originally entered.  The group, by some happenstance needed up in the lobby all together, met by Rosalie and her partner Cassity. An out burst of questions from the group was postponed by Rosalie and Cassity until the next morning.  

Session 3: the group started on the porch of the library, with Jason questioning Vivian.  Eva guided them back to her shop to continue  talking a little more civilized.  Tea was made, a mothman statue was provided for comfort and hypothesis about current events began flying.  The next morning the group met with a almost dismissive Rosalie.  Most of the group got frustrated and stormed off, Sera stuck around and had just more than a heart to heart with Rosalie.  Eva and Vivian stumbled across Cassidy who promised that ""all their questions could be answered"" if they went to a address provided on a ratty, curled portion of a business card.  Jack and Jason went to the security room to review footage from the night before, joined later by a shaken Sera.  The group planned to meet that evening after Jack and Vivians shift.  The session ended with Jack ditching work to go on a side quest with Eva, and Sera before the meeting that evening.   

Here's to many more sessions! Hopefully  I'll get to update soon!

In December 2024, I arrived at a car dealership and came to a complete stop in a cattle chute of cars. I thought I’d be nice to clean trash off the floor while I waited. My foot released from the brake upon bending over ever so slightly, so slow that the collision alert sensor didn’t go off. 

My car taps a bumper in front of me, the car sways and bangs the shins of two workers. 

No car damages to either. 

In May 2025, one worker claims injury. Gets $7,500 for a collision that was under 1 mph and akin to banging your shin on a coffee table. 

I tried to explain to my insurance a video exists and there is no way in hell anyone walked away that day injured. I even provided video of the guy working and talking to the police after the incident. I begged them to subpoena the video and call out the guy’s attorney for trying to rinse them. Instead they just settled and paid out $7,500. Never tried to get the video from the dealership, never listened. 

Yes I should have put my car in park. I’m not saying I’m not in the wrong. But I know that video shows how insignificant it is and how things went down do not add up to injuries. I have stubbed my toe harder. Is there anything here to file a claim with attorney against my insurance?

My friend gave me his old PC to diagnose and salvage anything of value from it - it was given to me in non-working condition,and it died after pouring some kind of liquid onto it. 
SPECS :
I5 8400
2*8gb crucial 2666mhz ddr4
Gigabyte b360m d3h
Gigabyte gtx1060 6gb
240gb sata ssd
450w thermaltake power supply 

I tried to turn it on,and it behaved the same each and every time i tried - led strip? (Some kind of decorative led built into MOBO pcb) lights up for a second,turns off and the whole process repeats itself until i disconnect said pc from the power. I have done this things since :
Tested PSU and GPU separately - they work,
Cleared CMOS - changed nothing
Removed BIOS battery - changed nothing
I have also tried to run CPU+RAM+MOBO in all possible combinations - cpu+mobo+both ram sticks, cpu+mobo+ one ram stick,cpu+mobo, mobo + 1/2 ram sticks, mobo on its own - and the pc behavior has not changed.
I dont have any working coffee lake or ddr4 supporting motherboard, so i cant test the ram or the cpu, but its unlikely they are the problem i suppose,as the mobo behavior does not change without them. Is there anything I can try to get it running or its over for this poor gigabyte board ? It just doesn't make any sense to me, theres not a single visibly damaged/shorted component on the board. 
I would appreciate any insight

1nu52pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/katebush/comments/1nu52pb/my_bush_history/,My Bush History,"Hello people.

I’d like to share my Bush experience since I’m seeing all these people who’ve discovered her in the last four years.

I’m a pretty young person, I’d say. Even though I’m old enough to remember when people had to listen to their music using CDs, most of my life was me having the choice to listen to what I wanted with no limits (i.e. YouTube). But Kate Bush was one of those people who I would had gladly gave my heart and ears to whenever I could. People might not remember but the Whole Story was the big deal when it came to her music. She had her best and greatest hits on it: no matter how plain it seemed, it was the true gateway to her music. It was my mum’s favourite album from time to time—not only that, but it was mine as well. I could still feel the shouting from my voice box as we flaunted Babooshka during our rides thru the serence English countryside any time of the day.

Speaking of countrysides—I was taken by complete surprise by the communities animosity towards her 1978 album Lionheart… yet that album is a perfect snapshot of my youth. The idea of Mrs. Bush having a deep connection to England that didn’t stem from nationalism but from environment and history in her song Oh England, My Lionheart… the eclectic silliness of Coffee Homeground reminding me of British traditions when they woke up in the morning, and Wow’s… just… wowing wonder. It convinced me that it is a greater album then even the Dreaming (and definitely better than Hounds of Love). Even the cover art was nostalgic, an attic that I would often visit like a fantasy world.

And I can’t stand this hatred for Wuthering Heights. Only a master like her can achieve a sweet buildup like that, and the combination of melody and repetition completes that song. It’s like the countryside wind is blasting in my face from the car window every time the chorus is played. 

Kate Bush really was the great unifier of my childhood. People call her experimental; they call her talented; but it doesn’t give credit to her beauty and deep meaningful soul. She’s a genius, but she’s also incredibly humble, and she is extraordinary in the most magical way. 

Sorry, back to what I was saying about her and my childhood… I used to be a semi-religious child because of my parents. I believed in God and angels, but I only felt an angels prescience once. If I had the opportunity to get ahold of my mum’s The Whole Story CD, I could skip the first track and settle in a private area of our home. It would have been dark and cold, but the light of her singing those words… ooh, he’s here again. The man with the child in his eyes. I didn’t have to know what it actually meant to understand what he meant to her, and thus me. So if that room had old carpet, vintage wallpaper, and large windows overlooking the beautiful chapel on the other side of the road’s bend, it wouldn’ have mattered that where I was could be a frigid and depressing place to myself or others, because it could mean as much to me as The Man with The Child in His Eyes meant to Kate because her voice was that angel standing next to me.

Idk, I’m bored and need to work on my memory so I just wrote this to feel better.

1nu4ykd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nu4ykd/what_instant_pot_size_fits_a_small_kitchen_setup/,What instant pot size fits a small kitchen setup?,"Hey everyone! I've been living in a tiny apartment for the past couple of years, and let me tell you, finding the right kitchen appliances that don't eat up all your counter space can be tricky. Today, I want to share my experience with choosing the perfect instant pot size for a small kitchen.

When I first started looking for an instant pot, I was overwhelmed by all the different sizes available. After lots of research and actually using one, I can confidently say that the 3-quart mini instant pot is ideal for small kitchens. It's compact enough to fit on limited counter space but still big enough to cook meals for 1-2 people.

I initially considered getting the 6-quart model (which seems to be everyone's go-to size), but I'm so glad I didn't. The mini version takes up about as much space as a regular coffee maker and does everything its bigger siblings can do. You can check out different instant pot sizes and their features here: https://athometouch.com/instant-pot

Here's what I love about the 3-quart model:
- Perfect for cooking rice, soups, and stews
- Great for meal prepping 2-3 portions
- Easy to store in small cabinets
- Doesn't monopolize counter space
- Uses less electricity than larger models
- Heats up faster due to smaller volume

The only downside I've found is that some recipes need to be scaled down, but that's actually been perfect for my needs. If you're cooking for more than two people regularly, you might want to consider the 6-quart model instead.

One thing I've learned is that multi-functional appliances are essential in small kitchens. My instant pot has replaced my rice cooker, slow cooker, and even my steamer. It's like having several appliances in one compact package!

Speaking of functionality, I found some great deals on various instant pot models here: https://athometouch.com/instant-pot. I particularly love how they come with different cooking programs that make it super easy to prepare various dishes.

For anyone wondering about storage, I keep mine in a corner on my counter, but it's light enough to move into a cabinet when I need extra space. The cord wraps neatly around the base, and the lid can be flipped upside down for storage.

Quick tip: Consider getting some accessories for your instant pot, but be selective. In a small kitchen, you don't want to end up with a bunch of extras that you'll rarely use. I personally just have an extra sealing ring and a steamer basket, which both fit inside the pot when stored.

I hope this helps anyone who's trying to decide on an instant pot size for their small kitchen! Feel free to ask any questions about my experience using it in a compact space.",1,1759210443.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False
1nu4yc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nu4yc3/aitah_for_telling_my_mom_36f_that_i_16f_dont_want/,AITAH for telling my Mom (36f) that I (16f) don’t want her to bring me to therapy appointments?,"Hi Reddit, this is a throwaway because I think it’d be embarrassing if this was available on my main, and I want some anomnymity, and don’t want to expose my Mom either. 
This was about 2 months ago, and it’s been weighing on me lately. I (16f) and my Mom (36f) got into an argument about my therapy appointments.
My Mom texted me late at night almost two months go on the 5th. She stated she’d take me to my therapy appointment the next day. 

-
Here is the issue. For background information, my Mom and I do not have the best relationship. It’s complicated, messy, and overall NOT normal. 
This realization came from my transition to moving to my grandparents house and my year of therapy, where I actually began to observe and evaluate how she treated me.
I always thought that our relationship was like every other mother and daughters, just we had a close relationship that I had always cherished.

When I moved to my grandparents house I began to realize that our relationship wasn’t normal. 

It was common, when I lived at my Moms, for me and my Mom to fight often. Now, you might figure teenagers and their rebellious nature or some stupid stuff like that, but it was anything but. 

Every move I made was criticized, I was called names, belittled, sometimes physically abused, and sent into panic attacks quite often at my Mom’s house. It had never been surprising to me that when I had made a mistake my Mom would get fired up enough to storm into wherever I was and yell at me loud enough neighbors could hear. Or a fight leading me into crouching on the floor and not being able to breathe. Or feeling incentivized to engage in bad tendencies against myself.

The difference of behavior of my grandparents and my Mom really shocked me, and I began to raise a flag to me that this didn’t seem right.
I told my therapist a lot of the behaviors I noticed from my Mom and she agreed that my Mom’s behavior was not normal.
-

I told her that I cancelled it and she asked me when and why I did so. 

(Realistically I knew that my Grandma or my Dad would not be able to take me, and I didn’t want to sit in the car with my Mom after a therapy appointment of talking about her and being frustrated with her and having to rie home- we go to a doctor’s out of town- but I know how well telling my Mom something like that will go over.)

I avoided her ‘why’ and simply replied when I cancelled it, but she asked me once again, “Why?” 
This is where it started to go downhill. I said, and I quote, “Why does it matter, lol”

Now I knew, even at the time, this would not go over well. It was disrespectful. I could have lied, and I don’t know why I didn’t. 

She responded, “Don’t do that without talking to me or your Dad about it first.” 
I could have stopped there, because I knew I was already poking the bear. This sentence was my warning looking back on it.
This is where I might be TA. 

Some more background information to clarify, My Mom hasn’t been taking me to appointments in months, we had just started talking again after a previous fight (we stopped talking to eachother for two weeks) I disagreed with her a lot, especially when she tried to defend how she has treated me, which we never go in huge arguments over but I could tell that it was starting to create tension.. 

So I said, “I’m 16 years old, not saying I’m an adult but I am definitely not a young child 
I will talk to my Dad because he lives far away and asking him to take me to an appointment and then canceling it would be wasting his time I didn’t ask you to take me. Respectfully.”

If a parent is already in a parental position than her comment would make sense, but she’s been anything but my parent these past few years.

I’ve had to burden and carry my own problems, that she doesn’t provide support with, and her problems on top of that. I have to care for her like I do a child, I wish I could put it differently.

While I deal with how she treats me I also have to deal with her problems as well as my own.
Personal stuff, like financial issues, work issues,  men/boyfriend issues, issues with my father (not together, just personal issues with him.), work issues, issues with our family (my grandma, grandpa, uncles), etc.

We’re on the same level, and everything is fun and good, till I make a mistake or say the wrong thing, or she has a bad day or if just she wants to assert dominance and become my parent all of a sudden. 
I provide all of my own necessities and food.

She doesn’t even rarely take me to appointments, she hasn’t for a couple of months anyhow. She provides a bit of my childsupport, and keeps the rest, she witholds her government stamps when she is mad at me, and I’m holding down a job scraping at my money an having to buy all the stuff a parent should provide instead of being like normal teenagers my age and saving up for a car or getting that expensive coffee I don’t need. Sorry, I went into a tangent, but I hope you get my point.

I understand that parents are people, I know they have their own problems and I wouldn’t mind but I feel like thats all I’m there for sometimes. 
Maybe she feels used by me, but the only things she provides are material and not maternal.
Even if it is maternal or kind it’s usually just to get something she wants or to manipulate my image of her. 

She responded,
“I didn’t need an explanation, I am telling you, next time don’t do that without talking to your dad or me about it. and your dad asked me to take you because i reminded him about it.” 

I said, 
“I don’t want you to take me to my therapy appointments. Please stop checking on them in the future.”

She said, 
“No. 
respectfully.”

So I said,
“It’s none of your business, I’m asking you to respect this because it is a boundary I’m setting.”

Then she responded totally out of left field, 
“Also, I understand that you don’t like me and you don’t have to pretend to, i am sick of doing the back and forth thing. but respectfully, do not talk about me to (sister’s name)- I understand that you possibly don’t, but you do to other people. You are entitled to however you feel, but you  will not talk about me to (sister) or (younger sister’s) and that’s a boundary i am setting.”

So I asked what she was talking about because it had nothing to do with our conversation NOW. 
Then I said, “I really don’t understand the point of bringing this up other than to try to make me upset and I’m not going to let you do that. Goodnight.”

And she responded, 
“I am not explaining myself and no it’s not about anything you are talking about but since we are having a conversation at the moment- you can say whatever you want to whoever, but you will not to (sister)
Goodnight.” 
She then proceeded to BLOCK ME.

It felt good for a second but then I realized I lost most of my bare minimum necessities she occasionally provides (on her own terms of course.) 

I don’t know who she believes that I talk to, because I don’t air out our business because it makes me uncomfortable an ashamed that I even put up with some of the stuff I put up with. (reminder that after this all happened my Mom told multiple people about this argument at OUR workplace where she is my manager.)

I have not said anything mean about my Mom to my sister, because my Mom usually talks bad about my Dad to me, and I know the toll thats taken on me, so I don’t want to turn around and do it to my sister.

I found out she informed my Dad of this fight and then proceeded to say, in text messages, that she “won’t be my Mom anymore until I respect her” and that she will have to try to let me go from our workplace to keep the peace there. 

I’m conflicted, because mostly I don’t feel like TA. But My Grandma, her Mom, thinks that she’s my Mom (family love trumps all? Idk) and that I’m treating her badly and was being disrespectful. My Grandpa, who has really strong family values, also said that I wasn’t TA but was being disrespectful by not listening to my Mom because you must respect your Mom, and that he feels bad because she was coming over and crying about me to him. 



After our fight I have avoided talking to her more than my job absolutely requires me to at work, don’t message her or talk to her, and we barely interact. When we do she either acts like nothing is wrong, she’s passive aggressive, or doesn’t acknowledge me at all. That was the first month.
We had a short conversation, because it had been the longest we had gone talking to each other, and I wanted to extend an olive branch, if not, at the least, just to see my siblings. 
I asked about my medication refill, (OCD, which was one of the main reasons I moved to my grandparents, because I had really bad flare ups at my Mom’s and the stress of living there worsened it quite a bit.) 
Due to the fact that my Mom was the primary number they texted due to the fact that my phone number was not one yet.
She responded with a thumbs up, and a couple hours later said, 
“ Am I allowed to check in on your medication? I figured it was none of my business. “
So I figured, well, that was that, and stopped responding, and she didn’t text me after that.

This month she’s been reaching out to me a lot more and trying to reconnect, providing transportation, paying for my dinner once, bringing over food, being more cordial and nice to me at work, and asking me out to eat and go to parks with my sisters and her.
I have declined to spend more time with her than I have to, but not being able to see my siblings quite as much really does kill me, and I feel like it’s straining my sister and mine’s relationship, especially since we’re close. 
Honestly, it’s hard to be around someone, especially when you don’t know their motives.


I personally think that not being able to tell if my Mom does the stuff she’s doing because she loves me or because she wants to take advantage of me in some way. I don’t think my Mom is some master manipulator but how else am I supposed to feel when I’m made to feel crazy for how I feel constantly????

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking advice for the pup show at radio/east. i know how much of a headache parking can be in austin so hopefully this helps someone out.  
  
honestly the easiest way to deal with it is using an app called Prked. you can rent someones private driveway or garage right next to RADIO/EAST. it's usually way cheaper than lots and you get to park in a reserved spot super close to the venue. you can just walk over in a couple minutes and completely skip the traffic mess trying to get into the main lot.  
  
if you dont do that, RADIO/EAST does have its own parking lot which is pretty big. but for a show like this, it's gonna fill up really fast. if you want a spot in the official lot you need to get there early, probably way before doors open.  
  
once that lot is full, your only other option is pretty much street parking. you can find spots in the neighborhood around the venue, but be prepared to walk a bit. please be cool and dont block anyone's driveway or park where you shouldnt. the neighbors have to live there after we all leave. getting towed would be a terrible end to the night.  
  
the venue is on montopolis so expect traffic to get a little backed up closer to the show. getting there early is the best advice i can give, no matter where you plan on parking. you can grab a coffee or a taco from one of the food trucks they have there while you wait.  
  
have a blast at the show, it's gonna be an awesome one. hope this helps",1,1759210049.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

1nu4tg3,https://v.redd.it/0u7n3dlvl8sf1,Panda eating pizza,"Prompt:

Hyper-realistic, cinematic medium shot in a cozy living room at night. A panda sits like a human on a deep, overstuffed charcoal-gray sofa, reclined slightly, belly soft against a heather blanket. The panda holds an open delivery pizza box across its lap with the left paw (paw pads visible, gripping the cardboard edge like fingers). With the right paw, it lifts a gooey slice of pepperoni pizza toward its mouth. Cheese stretches in long elastic strands, glistening, a single bead of orange oil quivering at the triangle tip before it drops in slow motion back into the box. Tiny crumbs dot the panda’s black arm fur; a smudge of tomato sauce shines faintly near the corner of its mouth. Left paw is holding a napkin.

Lighting is two-tone cinematic: a cool, flickering TV glow (soft blue) from camera-left washes across the panda’s face, while a warm tungsten floor lamp behind the sofa frames the ears with a golden rim light. The contrast carves out the panda’s fur texture—individual guard hairs sharp in the highlights, dense plush undercoat in the shadows. Whiskers catch specular points; the nose is wet and matte, tiny condensation visible in the cold light.

Foreground on the coffee table (shallow depth of field): a sweating soda can with condensation beads sliding down; a remote control facedown; two crumpled napkins; a plastic dipping cup with its lid peeled back, garlic oil reflecting the TV. On the pizza box lid, realistic grease circles, a printed red “Hot!” triangle, and handwritten marker (“Large • 8 slices”). Inside the box, the remaining slices are slightly askew; one edge shows a bite mark from an earlier sample.

Action (loopable, subtle, humanlike):  
The panda leans in, eyes half-lidded with pleasure, takes a big bite; cheese strings snap one by one.  
A tiny sauce drip lands on the box; the panda glances down and flicks it off with a neat, humanlike gesture.  
Chews slowly, jaw working, then gives a small nod of approval, almost a foodie gesture.  
Blink cycle: slow contented blink, ears twitch once at a loud TV sound cue.  
The sofa cushion compresses and rebounds subtly with each shift; the blanket wrinkles under the box.  
The panda dabs the mouth with a crumpled napkin (held between paw pads), sets it back, and goes in for another bite—reset to loop.

Camera & style:

35mm lens, slight dolly-in (very slow), f/2.8 shallow DOF; focus planes track from pizza slice → panda eyes → box text, then back to the slice.  
Naturalistic foley cues suggested: soft TV chatter (muffled), faint cardboard rustle, a sticky cheese stretch string snapping, distant fridge hum.

Color grade: warm amber highlights vs. cool cyan shadows for polished, premium look.

Mood: playful mockumentary of human ritual, intimate and indulgent—a panda having the perfect pizza night, rendered with luxurious, tactile realism.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at 7 years old, and my parents decided not to do anything about it, and then again finally diagnosed at 27 years old. I was prompted to take atomoxetine and I opted not to because I figured it wasn't too bad.   
Boy oh boy was I wrong lmao   
For the longest time, I've been in and out of therapy, doctors offices, hospitals trying to figure out what was wrong with me, because honestly despite having ADHD I never fully looked into the severity of it and I guess what you'd call the ""Dark Side"" of ADHD and it was... SHOCKING. So many things lined up. 

At this point in time, I'm 30 years old, I have severe ADHD with executive disfunction, no emotional regulation and basically everything rules my life. And losing my partner has been the final push to actually treat my ADHD. 

So questions, what are you on? If you don't mind me asking, how did it feel when you started it?   
What should I expect from this process?

I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

1nu4r8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Austin_Native_2/comments/1nu4r8t/options_expired_teen_license_tx_1825yo_driver/,Options: expired teen license (TX 18-25yo & Driver Education),"If you're 18-25yo in Texas and needing to renew your expired teen license, then you have two (2) options.

**ATTENTION:** The permit/license you received as a teen expired the day you turned 18yo. You cannot legally drive at all since that day without a new license; restricted 'adult permit' or unrestricted.

To get the renewed license, you must complete all requirements for *either* the teen *or* adult driver education course. But, you need to make a decision (now) on which you're going to do before you go into DPS.

**Option 1** -- Complete *all* requirements of whatever teen education you started. That includes coursework and driving hours -- both with an instructor ($, certificate upon completion) and a parent/guardian; these are detailed on the [Provisional License](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/texas-provisional-license-teen) page. Make sure you have the appropriate certificates from the driving school/course (e.g. DE-964/DEE-964) as applicable. You really should only need to show these to DPS once. So you may have already done that in the past. You do *not* need to complete everything before going to DPS. You can complete them in due time at your own pace.

**Option 2** -- Abandon the teen education and just take a six (6) hour adult course (~$40-100). As needed, you can search/confirm for [approved/certified course providers](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/driver/education/providers/search/). There are no driving hours required. If you choose this path, then you must complete the course *before* you go to DPS.

When you're ready to get a DPS appt via the [Scheduler](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/driver-license-services-appointments), you'll sign in with your (expired) license number. Almost all of the appt options will get you in the door (waiting room). There should be an employee there to help you check in and make sure you know what form(s) to fill out (as applicable). I believe the top option for 'APPLY FOR FIRST TIME TEXAS DL/PERMIT' should be grayed out and not available to you. You just need the next option for 'CHANGE, REPLACE OR RENEW TEXAS DL/PERMIT.' And if that's not available, then go with the option near the bottom titled 'SERVICE NOT LISTED OR MY LICENSE IS NOT ELIGIBLE.' If for some crazy reason none of those are available (which I doubt), then log in without using your license number (as it's optional).

Do not schedule a road test appt unless that's the *only* thing you need to do. Those appts will be treated separately from the 'desk/paperwork' appts. You should not expect to have a desk appt and road test during the same visit. This licensing ordeal is almost exclusively a two (2) appt process.

At your first DPS appt, make sure to tell the DPS CSR that your old license expired so they can pull up your profile (DL#). And *specifically* tell them you want to apply for a *B-Restricted* Class C driver's license. It's an 'adult permit' in that it'll require that you have a 21yo+ licenced passenger in the front seat whenever you drive. The restricted license should be valid for eight (8) years so there's no rush to take the road test ... except to gain that pure freedom of solo driving. Once you're ready, pass the road skills driving test to have the restriction removed. 

**NOTE:** Don't let them have you apply for an unrestricted license because then you'll be on the clock to get the road test passed within 90 days. And getting a road test appt in time may be an issue. There's just no benefit to the 90 day scenario.

It can't hurt to print out the [DL-14A](https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-14A.pdf) application ahead of time and fill in what you can. Just leave *anything* blank that you're not absolutely sure of. The DPS CSR will help and make sure everything is filled out properly.

I'll assume that you already provided your Real ID supporting documents when you got your first license/permit, but I suggest you take those documents with you again just in case. You also took the written/knowledge test to get your permit so that's already checked off as complete in their database. You will not have to take it again unless your license has been expired for two (2) years or more.

This (paragraph) likely won't be relevant for your particular needs, but I'm going to leave it here in case it's somehow useful to anyone. One thing specific to [Real ID documents](https://www.dps.texas.gov/apps/DriverLicense/RealID/) (or this easier [What To Bring](https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-15.pdf) PDF) that some folks have trouble with are the residency requirements. You may already have your own qualifying residency documents. But if you don't (and you live with someone), then you may be able to meet the [residency requirements](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/texas-residency-requirement-driver-licenses-and-id-cards) by filling out a [Texas Residency Affidavit Form DL-5 (PDF)](https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-5.pdf) with whomever you live. They'll likely need to go with you to DPS and provide the required residency documents (with their name & address as if they were the one getting a DL). Basically, they vouch for you. Again, this is only needed if you don't have your own residency documents.

Before you road test, you'll need to watch the appropriate free [Impact Texas Driver (ITD)](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/impact-texas-drivers-itd-program) video no more than 90 days beforehand. The certificate is only good for 90 days. If you completed the teen education course (Option 1) then you need the 2-hr teen ITTD video regardless of your current age. If you're going with the adult course (Option 2), then you'll need to watch the 1-hr adult ITAD video. Passing the road test will then remove the B restriction.

https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/apply-texas-driver-license

And finally, here's a bit of extra advice:
* Create a [Texas x Texas (TxT)](https://txt.texas.gov/) portal login and link your DL and any vehicle you own accordingly. Make sure to turn on notifications for renewals and expirations.
* Keep your DL info safe somewhere. If you ever need the DD audit number from it, the card is the *only* place you can get it. And that'll be required if you ever need to get a replacement online etc. So take a picture of it or write down the info; picture is by far preferred. Keep it in a secure folder on your phone, in a drawer, hide it in a coffee can in the freezer, email it to yourself... whatever. But keep it available by whatever means with which you're comfortable.

The [""Apply for a Texas Driver License""](https://www.dps.texas.gov/section/driver-license/how-apply-texas-driver-license) page is your info starting and overall reference point.

The first thing you need to do is complete a six (6) hour adult driver education course. As needed, you can search/confirm for [approved/certified course providers](https://www.tdlr.texas.gov/driver/education/providers/search/). The course along with studying the [Texas Driver’s Handbook](https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/Forms/DL-7.pdf) will get you ready for the written/knowledge test. Many courses include the knowledge test within their program. That's certainly preferred as it'll take off some of the stress. With a passing certificate in hand, that's one less thing you'll need to deal with at your DPS appt.

Once the course is completed, you can then go to DPS (by appt) to apply for a B-Restricted Class C driver's license ([Form DL-14A](https://www.dps.texas.gov/internetforms/forms/dl-14a.pdf)). You should specifically ask for this restricted license as it'll give you all the time needed to practice and subsequently take the road test at your leisure. This restricted license is often referred to as an 'adult permit' for anyone 18+ and requires that you drive with a 21yo+ licensed passenger in the front seat. During the appt, you'll take a vision test, a knowledge test (as applicable), and provide your Real ID supporting documents.

**NOTE:** Don't let them have you apply for an unrestricted license because then you'll be on the clock to get the road test passed within 90 days. And getting a road test appt in time may be an issue. There's just no benefit to the 90 day scenario.

I've never made beer before.  Lots of mead,  but no beer.  I want to try making a porter. Had a long chat with Grok and now understand the process and rationale for different ingredients.

I want to make a thick,  dark,  chocolate coffee,  slightly sweet porter. This is the recipe it gave me based on grains i asked about from northern brewer.

I'm not interested in any anti-AI posts. It's just a tool. If you really can't control yourself,  I can't stop you posting.  But don't expect any response. But like any tool, it should be checked.  I have no frame of reference, so want to check with you guys.  

Is there anything glaringly obviously wrong with this recipe? 

Is 1.2kg grain appropriate for 5L brew? 

Are the percentages suitable?

I'll be ordering from northernbrewer, so if there's any addions/alternatives, it would be useful if they are sold there.

He even stood near our table just blasting his loud music and that’s when we decided to just leave. Just playing loud music while sitting on a coffee shop without ordering anything. He does this too on other shops. 

Just wondering if anyone has seen this guy or knows him? Kinda bothers me and lots of other people too lol",9,1759209601.0,casualbataan,5,1.0,False

i work a 17-hour shift, from 6 AM to 11 PM. wala na akong time for myself usually. minsan 3 days akong walang maayos na meal. pa-coffee coffee and century tuna straight out of the can lang. may days na wala talaga. kape at tubig lang.

i have BPD and MDD, not an excuse, but i find na lately grabe yung trigger niya. especially if nagiging routine na yung daily life ko. sobra akong na-ddown. 

anyway, this morning after crying, i shaved off my eyebrows. to feel something siguro. BUT i ended up liking it 😭

ang lala but tbh shaving it off gave me a bit of relief, i don't know why. para bang nagkaron ng break sa routine ko!! 

hintayin ko na lang tumubo 😭😭 people keep asking me ""ano yan di ka na lalabas ng bahay??"" and 1.) wala naman talaga akong time lumabas 2.) if meron lang akong time oo lalabas ako because i love this new look, mukha akong alien 😭

1nu4fun,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nu4fun/returned_breville_ready_for_an_end_game_setup_4000/,"Returned Breville, ready for an end game setup [$4000+]","A few months ago, I bought the Breville Oracle Touch. This was my first espresso machine. I was doing drip coffee for years, the latest with the Fellow Aiden. My wife and I loved having home espresso, and I got into operating it and experimenting with shots. However, as we tried fancier beans, we hit a design flaw in the Oracle. With harder, lighter beans, the built-in grinder would seize up and overheat. I needed to unplug and plug it in to clear the error, but it would immediately happen again. This was very frustrating in the morning when I am trying to get coffee made and leave for work.

This is a known issue with the Oracle, and the solution seems to be ‘don’t use light roasts’. This was unacceptable to me for a $2000 machine. Even though we were out of the 30-day return window, I got Breville to accept it back for a refund.

So now I need to find a new machine and grinder. Since I now feel more comfortable with espresso technique, I am ready for an end-game machine and grinder. A typical day is to make my wife and myself a quad shot (that is 2 double shots each) plus steamed milk. On weekends, I’ll make espresso for myself later in the day to experiment with different beans or techniques.

For grinder: I was going to get a Niche, but not with a 35% tariff. So I’ve decided to get a Zerno. I will use my Fellow Opus while I wait for the Zerno. I’m leaning towards getting the Z1 since I will only use it for espresso.

For machine: This is where I need help. I was considering the Lelit Blanca v3. But this is manual dosing only. I would need to use a scale and couldn’t do other things like steam milk while pulling a shot. This is different than the more semiautomatic workflow from the Breville. I don’t mind using a scale and watching shots when experimenting, but when I am trying to pull 4 doubles and milk in the morning and get to work, I worry about doing this fast every day. I thought I needed a system with volumetric dosing, like a Bezzera Due DE or an ECM Elektronika II Profi, so I could push a button (after dialing in) for shots. But I also am not sure how accurate these systems really are. I can get weight-based dosing with the La Marzocco’s Linea Mini and scale. This is a tier more expensive (but I would consider it) but also has WiFi and apps, yuck.

If volumetric dosing is not that great and I should just adapt to using a scale for every shot, I could also consider the ECM Synchronika II, which seems to be better constructed and has a fast warm-up time compared to the Lelit.

What should I consider for a machine? Is volumetric or weight dosing any good, or should I just get used to a manual workflow? Help me hurry, I am getting sick of drip coffee again :)

1nu4e3l,https://www.reddit.com/r/JAKnight/comments/1nu4e3l/wildfire/,Wildfire,"Soul woke to the smell of smoke. Thick wood smoke. She sat up in a panic. The air was clear, her little studio safe. It was the wind that brought the smoke to her. She breathed deep of the scent.

She got up and dressed. An old pair of jeans, faded joggers, a lumpy jumper that made her skin itch. Old clothes for a dirty, dangerous task. She yawned, clicking on the kettle to make herself a coffee.

No dreams of golden eyed elves, no whispers of dark things moving unseen. She had slept deeply for the first time in a very long time. But she still felt her exhaustion bone-deep. A few more good night’s sleep and a dozen coffees would probably help that.

“Hey Mrs Rawley,” She waved to the old woman she rented the studio from. “Is there a bushfire around somewhere?”

Mrs Rawley gave her hand a gentle pat. “Yes, dear. It’s… where did the newsman say… North, you know which way is North? It’s North and looks to be heading East. No danger for us, dear. But that depends on the wind, they said.”

“Thanks, Mrs Rawley.”

Soul waved as she headed off, sipping her coffee. The weakness in the scent put the fire about an hour’s walk away. But she wasn’t going to walk. Only peasants walked, and Soul was a goddamn goddess. Or at least she told herself that. Her feet remained firmly on the ground.

A walk would do her good. Five minutes later Soul was ready to end her life. A walk would do her good? A walk would drive her mental! People did this for fun? She felt as though she was going to melt into a puddle and seep under the concrete. A fitting end.

Even with her playful winds darting around her to keep her cool, it was so sunny. And not a cloud in the sky to call over for shade. If there had been a cloud, Soul could have beefed it up with more water and sent the rain over to put the fire out instead of going herself.

She still hadn’t gotten the hang of creating her own rain clouds. It kept coming out as hail, and that was the last thing the firefighters needed. Getting conked on the head while trying to hose a fire down.

North heading east. Soul mused. Her winds must have been thinking for themselves, to be directing the fire around her. She squinted at the sky suspiciously. Or that was just the way the greater winds had prevailed. 

Cheeky bastards.

An hour was far too long to walk, Soul decided, as she hit the edge of town. She struck off the road, slipping down into the trees. It was cool under them, cool and muddy. Soul slipped and landed on her rear. 

Mud squished into the fabric, leaving her feeling damp and dirty. She scrambled to her feet, but the damage was already done. It had soaked into her underwear as well. Wet fabric rubbed against her skin.

“You know what, it’s fine,” Soul muttered to herself. 

She drew the water from the fabric, and dug the earth from the weave of her pants. But even though she was now clean and dry, she had still felt the wetness. Soul let out a long breath, putting aside her discomfort.

Bringing her winds to task, Soul pushed at her back. Stronger and stronger she pushed until she was leaning back against the push of the wind. She pushed again and her feet left the ground.

Her feet skipped across the ground, not quite flying, but not running either. Her concentration had to stay sharp, not only on keeping the winds at her back, but also on the little breeze that dipped to her from the road, warning her of cars approaching.

Several times she had to stop and wait for cars to go past, but the hour walk was reduced to maybe fifteen minutes. And she was incredibly glad for that. The road was blocked off, and fire fighters scurried like ants. 

Soul was careful to stay out of sight, the air was thick with smoke. Without her winds, there was no way she’d be breathing properly. The firefighters must have been decked out with masks and everything.

Pushing deeper into the brush, Soul followed the growing heat. She was sweating, her shirt sticking to her back. Her hair was going to smell like smoke for days. Soul shedded her jumper, tying it around her waist. 

It wasn’t long before even her winds were struggling to keep fresh air flowing to her. The edge of the fire wasn’t far, she could feel it scorching her skin. Soul waved an impatient hand and stepped through the last trees that shielded her.

“I think that’s quite enough,” She said sternly to the flames.

They leapt bright and orange, stretching to reach her with hunger fingers. She gave it a disappointed look. It roared higher, burning the trees faster in its effort to reach her.

“I said. That’s enough.” 

She held out her hand, letting the flames lick against her fingers. It was warm and gentle, like a scolded puppy. Soul sighed and patted through the flames. She didn’t want to kill the fire, but so much damage had been done already.

“I’m sorry.”

The air dashed away from her, taking with it the oxygen the fire was using for fuel. More sweat prickled at Soul’s skin at the power she poured into the control. Great patches of the fire went out, leaving smoking patches of blackened bush.

But the hard part was easing the air back into the vacuums Soul had created, filling the voids of air slowly so that they didn’t collapse with explosions of sound and pressure. Her vision dimmed at the edges.

I've been on quite a journey trying to find the perfect espresso machine that won't break the bank. After months of research and testing different options, I thought I'd share my experience to help others who might be in the same boat.

I remember when I first started looking for an espresso machine, I was overwhelmed by the prices. Some of these machines cost more than my monthly rent! But here's the thing - you don't actually need to spend a fortune to make great espresso at home.

Through my search, I discovered some really solid affordable espresso machines that can make cafe-quality drinks. The key is knowing what features you actually need versus what's just nice to have. For example, while a built-in grinder is convenient, you can save hundreds by getting a separate grinder and a simpler machine.

One of the best resources I found was this collection of budget-friendly espresso machines: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They have detailed comparisons and honest reviews that really helped me understand what I was looking for.

Here's what I learned to look for in an affordable espresso machine:
- 15-bar pressure pump (minimum)
- Sturdy build quality (avoid too much plastic)
- Good steam wand for milk frothing
- Easy-to-clean design
- Consistent temperature control

Pro tip: Look for machines that use standard 58mm portafilters. This means you can easily find replacement parts and accessories without being locked into expensive proprietary components.

I've found that manual machines often provide better value than super-automatic ones. They might take a bit more practice to master, but the coffee quality can be just as good as machines costing three times as much.

For anyone serious about getting into home espresso without spending a fortune, I'd highly recommend checking out https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine. They frequently update their listings with new deals and seasonal discounts.

Remember, making great espresso is more about technique than having the most expensive equipment. I've seen people make amazing shots on entry-level machines because they took the time to learn proper extraction principles and milk steaming techniques.

Don't forget to factor in accessories when budgeting. You'll need a decent grinder, tamper, and cleaning supplies. But even with these extras, you can set up a complete home espresso station for less than what you'd spend on three months of daily cafe visits.

I hope this helps others who are looking to start their home barista journey without emptying their savings account. Feel free to ask any questions - I love geeking out about coffee gear!",1,1759208280.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

My belly was still buzzing from all the cheesecake I’d eaten, and sure enough… the dream world opened its doors again.

This time, I found myself standing in front of a giant glowing café sign that said “Coffee Day Festival.” The doors opened by themselves, and out stepped Zoe, looking just like in the video—sharp tuxedo jacket, bowtie, and her confident smile. She bowed like a performer and said, “Welcome, Amy! Tonight, you’re our guest of honor.”

I waddled inside, my belly bouncing like a drum. The café had transformed into a carnival—coffee fountains spilling creamy lattes, rivers of hot chocolate flowing under bridges made of cookies, and giant cheesecakes twirling on spinning stands like merry-go-rounds.

“Wowww!” I gasped, my eyes sparkling. “This is… heaven for my belly!”

Zoe laughed and handed me a golden coffee cup. “Here, taste this—it’s a magical brew.” I sipped, and my belly rumbled so loudly that the whole café echoed. Instead of being embarrassed, the crowd of dream-customers cheered!

Then, as if things couldn’t get crazier, my sisters appeared too. Jennifer walked in holding her office bag, shaking her head. “Amy, even in dreams, you find food festivals.” But then Zoe handed her a cup, and even Jennifer smiled, saying, “Okay, I admit—this is delicious.”

Suddenly the music started—jazzy coffeehouse beats—and Zoe raised her cup like a microphone. “Ladies and gentlemen, the belly star of Coffee Day Festival—Amy!”

Spotlights hit me, and my belly gave a loud boooong! sound like a drum. The whole dream-crowd clapped in rhythm. I danced awkwardly, my belly wobbling to the beat, while Zoe spun behind the counter like a DJ, pouring coffee and tossing cookies into the air. Jennifer sighed but then joined in too, laughing while holding a tray.

We ended up in a funny line dance—me, Zoe, Jennifer, and my sisters—all stomping our feet, clinking coffee mugs, and letting our bellies bounce along to the music.

1nu48ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_VerdantVoidling/comments/1nu48ve/captain_yorkes_fishing_voyage/,Captain Yorke's Fishing Voyage,"""Welcome aboard, Terrence, me lad!"" The Captain's voice thundered out, drawing a dark look from the woman sitting in the booth behind him. His outburst had shattered the quiet atmosphere of Linda's Roadside Diner, and when she dropped her coffee cup it had shattered in much the same way. As she fussed over her scrambled eggs, I poked at my own and thought adding some coffee might be an improvement. 


I had spent my last two dollars on the plate of runny eggs. They tasted faintly of salmon, and I quietly cursed the cook for making my eggs in the same pan as the Captain's fish. He had noticed me from across the diner and come to sit in my booth. He said he saw hunger in me, and laughed heartily when I dryly pointed out where we were. 


""You'll fit right in, me boy."" The Captain's smile carried a sense of implicit brotherhood. 


He had been right, of course. I was hungry, and I was very broke. When I left home to travel the world as a vagabond, I had underestimated the amount of desperation I would face. I remember worrying that I had come across as overeager when I accepted the job offer. I would be joining his crew for a three day commercial fishing voyage, with halibut as our quarry. 


I finished my meal without saying another word as the Captain gushed about his boat, his crew, and the open ocean. 


We drove together for three hours to a dock somewhere in the northern half of Massachusetts. There were many times I found myself fearing that the Captain's ancient Pontiac might break down and leave us stranded somewhere along I-95. I was so thankful to have arrived without incident that I had completely forgotten there were others who would be joining us. Hauling my heavy luggage, I let my eyes wander over the area. The sand here looked dull, as if the color had been muted somehow from the usual beige sands into a depressing, greyish facsimile of the color sand is meant to be. The dock, well, ramshackle would have been too kind a word. The small staircase sat askew, with handrails held together by nails plainly visible in the overcast gloom of the afternoon. The rails had been pulled away from their posts by gravity as the rest of the dock drifted out to sea. 


As we made our way up the ragged stairs, I found myself thinking that the Captain looked every bit as creaky and dilapidated as the dock. His gait was dramatically marred by a limp of the left leg, as if it were slightly shorter than his right. His right arm swung freely as he moved, while the left dangled stiffly at his side. I wondered if the Captain, like the dock, had been stretched and distorted by the force which, like the shifting tides, pulled him out to the sea. 


""Ain't she a beauty, me lad?"" The Captain breathed out the question with awe and admiration laced into his voice. 


The ship was in much better shape than the dock. It was right around 40 feet long, with clean sleek siding. The absence of any marring of the hull told me that either the Captain was incredibly vigilant in the removal of barnacles, or the barnacles had never chosen to attach themselves to the ship to begin with. The cabin was relatively spacious, painted stark white contrasting beautifully against the ocean’s surface and the grey clouds above. Cursive letters, painted in red, told me the name of the ship. ""The Minnow."" 


""I'll say."" I muttered half-heartedly. It was a beautiful ship, but I was not a man with an eye for such things. ""Your boat is certainly much nicer than your car."" 


The sound of the Captain's laughter told me my risky remark had been worth it. He left me to settle in, claiming that he had to make sure everything was ready to go. I was putting my bags away in what meager storage the ship could afford me when I heard something that made me jump. 


It was a voice, low, and slow. Deeper and more cracked than any human voice I've heard before or since. It rasped out to me from the darkest corner of the room. 


""Hi! Oh, sorry. Frog in my throat! Haha."" He cleared his throat and spoke again. This time, his voice was perfectly ordinary. ""I'm Jared. Nice to meet you."" 


Jared got up and stepped into the negligible light which seeped down into the crew's quarters. He was Asian, possibly Chinese, with jeans that looked too big for him, and a jacket to match. 


""Nice to meet you too, I'm Terrence. Terrence Howard. Not that one, though, obviously."" I kicked myself for unnecessarily clarifying that I am not Hollywood star Terrence Howard. If I was going to be spending a week at sea with these guys, I couldn't afford to make myself out to be a weirdo. 


""Pleased to make your acquaintance, Terrence Howard. I loved you in Iron Man. So, where did the Captain find you? He picked me up from outside a Home Depot."" I don't know if people know this about being homeless, but you don't get too many folks interested in your life story. I seized on the opportunity with more gusto than I probably should have, and by the end of the night, Jared and I were on track to becoming fast friends. 


Besides Jared and I, there were three others on the vessel, not including the Captain. There was John Laramie, an elderly man with a peg leg and the face of a bulldog, who would be serving as the Captain's first mate. Then there were Jimmy and Timmy Brakovich, Russian twins who had fled their homeland to evade service in the war against Ukraine. These two would be working with Jared and I as deckhands. We had all made our introductions, and we were tickled to find that every one of us had been vagrants before crossing paths with Captain Yorke. I joined several others in ribbing the Captain about his crew of runaways and vagabonds, and as we laughed I caught sight of the last member of the crew. 


He had stood in abject silence, never uttering a word. Instead of joining in any conversations he simply flicked his shallow, verdant eyes from person to person, as if observing us. Hoping to garner as much information about others while sharing none about himself. I made my way over to break the ice. 


""Hello, I'm Terrance Howard."" His only response to this was to raise his eyebrows, so I pushed on. ""Where are you from?"" 


He didn't reply, he simply kept his eyes locked on mine and gave an insincere smile. Something in the way he was looking at me, saying nothing, made my skin crawl. The longer we stood together in silence, the more frightened of him I became. We were adrift in the endless expanse of the Earth's oceans, surrounded on all sides by the darkness of the early morning, and yet the most terrifying part of it all was this man. This implacable statue, standing tall and silently staring accusation into my soul. 

""Ah, that's Jeff! He's a friendly enough fella, but completely incapable of speech, I fear. He's what they call a mute."" The Captain had appeared, as if out of thin air, directly behind me. 


The tension I had felt melted away. I kicked myself for leaping to thoughts of paranormal stowaways before considering a simple disability. I reached out to shake Jeff's hand, and was pleased when he reciprocated the gesture. His hand was rough like sandpaper against my own, and wonderfully warm against the brisk morning winds. 


The Captain excused himself from my company and made his way forward to address the crew. 


""Alright, lads. We've got a long week of hard fishing ahead."" The Captain droned out, with the last word of the sentence trailing off. ""We set out nets at first light, go get some grub and be ready when the time comes."" There was elation in the Captain's voice. I could tell that he lived for these voyages. 


Jared and I sat together at breakfast, without much of anything to talk about. We had been discussing the most recent season of ""The Masked Singer"" when the Captain flung open the door and called us all to our tasks. 


The day's work passed by in such a blur that I could hardly believe it when I first saw the moon. There was something therapeutic in the mindless labor. We had been laughing and joking amongst ourselves so much that the work had stopped feeling like work at all. That mood, unfortunately, wouldn't last. 


The Captain stood before us in the dining area that night, noticeably shorter than when we had departed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what was giving me the impression that the Captain was profoundly sorrowful, but I figured it out about halfway through his speech. Something in his face had shifted, giving way for his eyeballs to become ever so slightly larger than they had been. 


""Is the Captain sick or something? He looked kinda off today."" I mused to Jared as we lay down for the night. 


""Dunno, I didn't notice anything. Why?"" He replied. 


""I'm not sure. It's probably nothing."" I said, deciding to drop the subject. I told myself I couldn't lie awake all night thinking about things I had probably just imagined. 


The next morning, I found myself working closely with the first mate, Mr. Laramie. We had been assigned to the gutting and freezing of the previous day's catch. 


""So Mr. Laramie,"" I picked up a halibut with a particularly sad look in its dead eyes and sliced it from tip to tail, ""Where are you from?"" 


""S'best not to talk, boy. Ye'll get the guts in yer mouth."" He spat the sentence out at me, and I took the cue to shut up. 


We worked together in silence, processing the hundred or so fish which felt like thousands at the time. 


""Okay, but you can at least tell me where you're fr-"" my sentence died in my throat. A particularly full stomach had fallen from the halibut Mr. Laramie had just gutted, landing with a crash and sending a ribbon of fish intestine soaring into my mouth. The scrap of viscera landed on my tongue, leaving behind an oily, bitter film. Mr. Laramie laughed hysterically as I retched over a barrel. 



After ten minutes of scraping my tongue and gargling seawater, I was ready to return to work. 


""Y'alright now, boy?"" Mr. Laramie had softened significantly after laughing at my misfortune. 


""Yeah, I'm fine. Pass me that stomach I want to see what the hell this thing ate."" He handed me the stomach, and I sliced it open. I had expected a workboot and another round of laughs. I had not expected a small, humanoid being with large, bulbous eyes which hung suspended from stalks protruding from where the eye socket would typically be found on a human. 


""Go fetch the cap'n."" Mr. Laramie whispered, with his face stark white in the fluorescent light of the ship's processing station. 


The Captain followed me back to the station while I tried, and failed, to explain what we'd found. When he entered the cramped room full of death and viscera, his eyes instantly locked on the tiny corpse. 


""WHAT IN THE BLUE BLAZES HAVE YE DONE? I OUGHT TO THROW THE BOTH OF YE OUT INTO THE BLOODY SEA AND LET HER HAVE HER WAY WITH YE."" The Captain had flown into a rage, with tears in his eyes and a face as red as an apple's ass. 


""Now hol' on Cap'n, it weren't the boy's fault we were ju-"" I appreciated Mr. Laramie defending me, but Captain Yorke clearly did not. He cut Laramie off mid-sentence. 


""So yer saying it was you then, are ye Mr. Laramie? Ye and ye alone killed that poor child? Twas ye who may doom us all then, aye, Mr. Laramie?"" His accent shifted in strange ways as the anger waxed and waned. 


""No! No Captain, it were the fish what did it. The boy and I found the poor thing dead in the belly of a halibut."" Mr. Laramie seemed like he might cry. I hoped he wouldn't, as I've never been able to handle the sight of an old man crying. 


The Captain's rage had died immediately once he understood what had happened. He solemnly crossed the room, and discard the body into the sea. 


""Neither of ye are to speak of this."" The Captain muttered, turning on his heel to storm out of the room. 


""What the fuck was that?"" I asked Mr. Laramie, who was clearly just as perplexed. He just stared back at me, stunned, with his jaw hanging open. 


When Jared asked me how working with the first mate had been,  I thought about telling him the truth. In the end, I decided to obey the Captain and keep it to myself. 


""It was...fine."" I said. Better to lie by omission. 


""Well you really missed out today. You know those Russian fellas? Well, they were doing this bit where they got on either end of a fish and pretended they were fu-"" Listening to the stories of the day's hijinks brought me peace enough that I fell asleep while he spoke. 


I was the first to wake the next morning, and I made my way onto the deck to enjoy the sea breeze air. I decided to walk laps around the deck, and it wasn't until the third or fourth lap that my foot brushed against him. Mr. Laramie was lying flat on the deck, barely concealed between two fishing nets. I pulled the nets away, and revealed his pale, bloated face. His wrinkled skin had allowed the bloating to reach an unimaginable degree. A thin trail of water trickled from his mouth, and in desperation I turned him onto his side. If he had drowned, then there was a chance he could be resuscitated, or at least thats what I had thought at the time. 


When I turned him, gallons of water began to pour rapidly from his now open mouth, carrying out hundreds of tiny orbs. His skin began to visibly sag, progressing further and further until Mr. Laramie was left as nothing more than a sack of crumpled skin lying on the deck. 


The thing they don't tell you about being out at sea, is that the winds steal away the sound of your screams. I'm not sure how long I sat there in the dark, pawing at the crumpled remIns of Mr. Laramie and screaming for help which could not hear me. 


 I shuffled myself to the Captain's quarters in a daze. When he finally answered my pounding at his door, I could only point towards the area where I had found the body. I followed him over, stopping just short of where the body would be visible. I heard the Captain shout in horror, and he rushed off to rouse the crew. 


We all coped with the incredibly bizarre death of the first mate in different ways. Jimmy and Timmy had brought along large combat knives, and they were using them to put on what they called a ""show of force against our unseen attacker."" Jared and I sunk ourselves as far into the work, the routine, as humanly possible. I just wanted to get the trip done and move on. You can imagine the despair I felt when the ship unexpectedly lurched before coming to a complete stop. 


The engine had been clearly and brutally sabotaged, with fuel lines which looked more like they'd been ripped than cut. 


I stared at the decimated engine in disbelief. The Captain reached out and put his hand on my shoulder. It was cold, and my shirt was left wet when he pulled back. 


""S'alright, lad. Jimmy and Timmy here'll have us fixed up in no time. Just think of how many fish we'll catch while we wait, me boy!"" His eyes did something strange then. They seemed to move and stretch, as if trying to separate from one another. 


""Captain... are you feeling well?"" I asked, genuinely concerned. 


""Never better, me boy!"" Once again his eyeballs seemed to try and flee from each other. ""Now let's get to work!"" 


Jared and I tried to make small talk while we worked through the day, but mostly we just stood around in a daze. Our situation had grown incredibly dire, incredibly quickly. 



He was the first one who found Timmy that night. We were awoken by a massive clatter. Timmy and his brother, Jimmy,  had been working through the night to get us back up and running. Something had slashed Timmy viciously down his torso, spilling his guts out into his lap where he sat slumped against the engine. His mouth was moving in an attempt to speak last words, but none would come. He reminded me of one of the fish we had caught. Uselessly bumping his gums against each other in some vain attempt at one last act. We spread out and searched through the ship, but Jimmy was nowhere to be found. 


Jared and I called an emergency meeting of the remaining crew. Together, we accused the Captain, whose eyes had grown more tubular in their shape and at least twice their usual size, of being some sort of demon.


""A demon? Listen to yerself, lad. What kind of demon would I be? What kind of demon would take a boatload of fuckheads like you on a fishing voyage, let alone pay you? Far as I'm concerned, Jeff here is the only one a ya that's worth a damned dime.""


Jeff, the mute, had apparently taken the Captain's side. The last time I ever saw him, he was glaring back at me over his shoulder in anger. We divided the ship into two sections, fore and aft. The food and water would be kept in the middle to provide access to both parties. 


By this point, there were only the three of us left. Jared and I slept in shifts, and so far neither one of us had seen anything. The standoff lasted a few days, before we walked out onto the deck to find the Captain with our food and water teetering on the ship's edge. 


""You can't hide from me forever, lads,"" he gently nudged our bottled water out into the waves, ""it's just us out here."" And he followed it up with the food. 


I shut the door. There was no more sense in going out if there was no supplies out there. We planned to escape via life raft, but a storm had blown in. It stayed for two days. On the second night of the storm, during my turn to take the watch, I succumbed to my exhaustion and fell asleep. 


I woke up two hours later in a panic. The storm had passed, and the sun was high in the sky. Jared was gone. I rushed out onto the deck, finding the Captain squatting over his lifeless, bloated form. I fell to my knees, buckling under the weight of sheer hopelessness. Captain Yorke turned to face me, and I saw his eyes had ballooned to ridiculous proportions, each as large as a soccer ball. They drooped down by his cheeks as the eyestalks they were mounted on failed to support the weight. The stalks themselves were grotesque, like sea sponges comprised of taut human skin. The Captain had visibly shrunken in terms of height, with his limbs growing thicker and less flexible but more powerful in a way which was horribly apparent. 


I wanted to pick myself up and flee back to the perceived safety of the room, but there was no point. I was going to have to sleep at some point. Even if he didn't come for me, I'd die to dehydration or starvation within days. My mouth had become so dry that my tongue felt like a wad of sandpaper prodding desperately for any trace of saliva. I resigned myself to death as the Captain leaped across the deck and landed on my chest. 


He held me firmly in place, distending his jaw and placing my entire head in his mouth. His icy lips locked around my neck, forming a seal. The afternoon sun bled red through the skin of his cheeks, providing just enough light to see water trickling in to the Captain's mouth. I struggled to free myself from him for five minutes which each felt like an hour. As the water level rose, I was able to smell the fact that it was not sea water. It was fresh. Drinkable. I was so desperate that I might have done it, if it hadn't been for the tiny orbs I'd felt bumping against every inch of submerged skin. My mouth was eventually covered, and the fluid had risen to just below my nose when I finally managed to break a hand free from the grasp of Captain Yorke. I flailed wildly, grabbed the first thing my hand found and pulled. 


A splash echoed across the deck as the Captain released me and began to howl in pain. I had grabbed his eyestalk, and pulled the whole thing clean off. I didn't waste my moment. I grabbed the other eye and yanked until it separated with a sickening squelch. The Captain stumbled blindly, slashing at the air with fingernails elongated into vicious claws. When he wandered too close to the edge, I delivered a kick which sent him plunging into the briny deep. I collapsed on the spot. 


I'm not sure how long I lay there drifting aimlessly through the sea. I'm pretty sure the dehydration affected my memory, as it's mostly just a blank. I do remember one night though. I'd say, maybe two days after I had killed Captain Yorke, I saw Jared's body suddenly shift, turning his head to lay against the deck. I heard water rushing out of his mouth and out toward the sea, and then, a few minutes later, I heard a tiny splash from the side of the ship. Like something very small had fallen, or jumped, down into the churning waves of the Atlantic. Then another. And another. Then ten more, and another ten after that until I had become completely convinced that there were thousands of *somethings* in the water all around. 


I was found a couple days later by a friendly fisherman who fed me and gave me water.  He even let me use his phone to get messages out to what few friends and family I have left. He said he's going to take me to his hometown to rest up before he drives me down to West Virginia. I'm going home to see my family again. I think of Jared and the others. I only just met them, and now they're dead and gone. I need to be somewhere that I'm known, no matter how bad it might be. Just a few days of rest in Innsmouth and then I'll be on my way.

The factory default is 93. I think my extractions taste way better and a lot more balanced at 90. I only adjust temperature after I dial the coffee and have a balanced shot; to fine tune and based on roasting level.

I found my shots to be a lot more balanced using these parameters as the starting point:
 - 2:1 (20g/40g)
 - 30-35 seconds. I’ll adjust grinding to go finer if I am at 25 seconds. 
 - 90 degrees
  - I adjust yield to get a balanced shot in 5g increments/decrements; fine tune from there (add/remove 2 or 3 grams)

95% of the extractions with these parameters are excellent.  I find I get more from resting the beans if they were roasted in approx a week that than adjusting temperature or profiling. Once I get what I deem a perfect extraction, then I play with temperature in 3 degree increments/decrements and or flow profiling.

*Where injuries, break points, and a dash of drama collide.*

---

### Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Let’s start with the cold, hard stats. McCartney Kessler, the “Tennis Surgeon,” enters this match with a 34–20 record in 2025, two titles (Hobart, Nottingham), and a career-high ranking within reach. She’s already stunned top-10 star Elena Rybakina this week, converting seven of 20 break points—a surgical strike rate that would make Dr. House proud. Her head-to-head against Eva Lys is 2–0, with wins dating back to Osaka 2023 and the US Open in 2022.

Eva Lys, meanwhile, is the “Tennis Bull,” charging into her first WTA 1000 semifinal with a 29–21 record and a breakthrough year that included an Australian Open run as a lucky loser. But here’s the rub: Lys has been broken nine times in her last three matches, and her first-serve win rate (60%) is about as reliable as a smartphone battery during a TikTok marathon.

The odds? Most books have Kessler as a slight favorite, with decimal lines hovering around **1.87–1.95** (implied probability: \~51–54%). On Bovada, though, the spread gets spicy: Lys is -1.5 games at **1.77**, while Kessler is +1.5 at **2.1**. The total games line sits at **21.5**, with Over priced at **1.83** and Under at **1.91**. If you’re feeling spicy, this parlay has legs.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Ambitions, and a Dash of Drama

Barbora Krejcikova’s Beijing exit—thanks to a knee injury that had her hobbling like a penguin on a trampoline—shifts the spotlight to Kessler. The American has been so dominant lately, she’s basically the tennis version of a “get out of jail free” card for fans of underdog stories. Her recent win over Rybakina? A masterclass in patience, with 20 break chances (and seven converted).

Eva Lys, though, isn’t here to make friends. Her aggressive baseline style has earned her a WTA 1000 quarterfinal berth, but her serve? Well, let’s just say it’s not the most reliable espresso machine in the tournament. With a 60% first-serve win rate, she’s like a coffee sho

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Daniil Medvedev vs. Learner Tien: A Tale of Two Serves (and Why Medvedev’s Is Better)**

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Medvedev’s Dominance**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard numbers. Daniil Medvedev, the 18th-ranked ATP titan, is a near-lock at **-128 to -135** (decimal 1.28–1.35) to defeat 52nd-ranked Learner Tien, a 19-year-old phenom with the audacity to beat Medvedev in the Australian Open earlier this year. Converting those odds to implied probabilities, Medvedev’s chances of victory range from **74% to 77%**—which is basically the statistical equivalent of a “layup” in basketball, but for tennis.

The totals line is **21.5–22 games**, with the Under priced slightly lower (1.83–2.05) than the Over. Medvedev’s recent performance against Alexander Zverev was a clinic in efficiency: a 6-3, 6-3 victory in just 1 hour and 22 minutes, with zero aces but *only three double faults*. If this match mirrors that one, we’re looking at a low-scoring, high-efficiency affair—perfect for the **Under**.

**Digesting the News: Tien’s “David vs. Goliath” Plot Twist**  
Learner Tien, the American upstart, has one notable triumph over Medvedev: a 2025 Australian Open second-round upset. But context is key. Back then, Medvedev was nursing a nagging wrist injury and later admitted he “played like a robot on a coffee break.” Now? He’s fresh off a five-set redemption tour against Zverev, having ended a five-match losing streak to the German.

Tien, meanwhile, is a prodigy with the resume of a Netflix documentary subject. But let’s not forget: he’s 52nd in the world for a reason. His ATP 500 Beijing campaign has been a rollercoaster, and facing Medvedev—fresh off dismantling two top-20 players—feels like a rookie NBA guard trying to guard LeBron

My family has been in Oman for more than 400 years, and one of the few things that has remained constant through the generations is our little foodstuff shop in Muttrah Souq. Today, we are among the last of such shops still running there.

With time, I know people have moved on to supermarkets and malls, but for us, this shop is more than just a business — it’s a piece of history, culture, and family heritage. Every sack of rice, every packet of spices, and every batch of coffee beans on our shelves carries a story of the generations before me who worked hard to keep this going.

I’m just trying to keep that legacy alive. If you’d like to support us — even in a small way — you can DM me here or WhatsApp me at 24712805.

Your support means keeping a part of Muttrah’s history breathing a little longer. Thank you from the bottom of my heart 🙏

Listen up, my fellow content creators! Are you tired of the same old grind, spending hours crafting content, only to feel like you're running on a treadmill? 🤯 Well, let me tell you—there's a silver lining out there, and it’s all about *working smarter*, not *harder*.

I’ve been diving headfirst into faceless growth strategies lately, and wow, where has this been all my life? It’s like finding a cheat code for life! Here’s the scoop: You *can* grow your audience and your brand without showing your face or burning the midnight oil. Sounds too good to be true? Let me break it down for you:

### Why Go Faceless? 🤔
- **Anonymity = Freedom:** You can explore different niches without being tied to your personal brand. Want to talk about underwater basket weaving? Go for it! 
- **Less Pressure:** No more worrying about how you look or what to wear for that next video. Just pure content creativity. 
- **More Focus on Content:** You can spend time polishing content instead of worrying about lighting or camera angles. 

### Faceless Content Strategies You Need to Try! 💡
1. **Curated Content:** Find awesome content in your niche and curate it. Share what you love without needing to create everything from scratch. 
2. **Anonymous Blogs/Vlogs:** Express your thoughts without ever showing who you are! Think of it as fighting the good fight under a superhero mask. 🦸‍♂️ 
3. **Automated Social Media Tools:** Use tools to schedule and post content while you chill or create other stuff. For example, check out this helpful guide I stumbled upon that really made my life easier: [Maximize Your Efficiency](https://www.checkout-ds24.com/redir/540531/maximizeme/). Seriously, this program is a game changer!

### Pro Tips for Faceless Success! 🚀
- **Leverage Automation:** Set it, forget it! Who doesn’t love a little automation fairy magic? ✨
- **Get Your Voice Out There:** Use text-to-speech or voiceover tools for videos. Hello, digital freedom!
- **Engage Authentically:** Even faceless, you can still build genuine relationships. Comment back, share our struggles, and connect!

And let’s just take a second to appreciate how liberating this is. 😌 Imagine waking up, sipping your coffee, and realizing you’ve got fresh content rolling out without lifting a finger. Who else is into this idea? 

So, next time you think you need to bust out the fancy camera and perfectly curated outfits to make an impact, remember this: **Faceless doesn’t mean nameless.** You can leave your mark invisibly and creatively.

I took the peppers, trimmed the stems, and arranged them on the grill. Set the temperature to the lowest setting (“smoke” in my case… about 160F). I let them smoke for about 8 hours, chopping them in half at the 4 hour mark when I saw they were taking longer to dry out than I’d like. Then, I just pulsed them on the most coarse setting on the coffee grinder would do. It’s important to not overload the grinder or pulse for too long. 

I was left with some smoky and ridiculously spicy pepper flakes!

You could do this in an oven at ~160F or a dehydrator if you don’t have a smoker, I imagine. Goes without saying, but wear gloves!",23,1759206222.0,hotsauce,4,1.0,False

I've used dating apps before. I've gone on and dated before. Lately, I've found that I do really well with finding people online more than in the wild. Maybe because I find it easier to be myself, maybe I enjoy a little mystery. *Maybe* it's just more fitting into my life over meeting in person right away. Who knows? I like keeping both options open. 

I'm a pretty self-sufficient, independent person. Sometimes I get a little sad about it when it's been a long day, I'm starving, have a dog that still needs to be walked, and I'm so desperate to wash my day away. Those are moments I sometimes wish I didn't have to do everything all by myself. Other times, I take a photo of my waffles, find it so incredibly picture esque, and wish I had someone to think of that I'd share the picture or even my waffles with. 

I think overall I have my shit together, I'm looking for same. I'm looking for someone who wants to see me, know me, and see me fitting into what's already working for them and vise versa. I'm a big fan of ""I'll work on me for you, and you work on you for me."" 

Things I love: food, cooking, reading, self-improvement, anything hands-on/artsy (I've been working on sewing lately!). Walking around outside, going to an art show, or comedy show can be up my alley when I'm feeling more outgoing. Thrifting, the occasional matinee and some coffee can do me wonders more frequently. 

I'm half Mexican, half Italian. I've been really trying to find my place and love for my cultures on my own. Being mixed and 2nd Gen often has me feeling out of place most of the time and bit fraudulent when I try. I'm trying to shake off  the latter, however. 


If you appreciate the things I enjoy, have your own things you love, can respect some self depreciation and sarcasm and food pic or two. Then, write me. You might be just what I'm looking for.

1nu3omm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WEB3DEV_/comments/1nu3omm/building_products_at_hackathons_5_critical/,Building Products at Hackathons: 5 Critical Mistakes to Avoid,"Over the past four years working in Web3 and participating in countless hackathons as a mentor, organizer, and hacker, I've seen the same mistakes repeated over and over. The good news? They're all avoidable. Here are the five most common errors teams make when building products at hackathons, and more importantly, how to fix them.

# ❌ Mistake #1: Not Knowing Who Your Product Is For

This is the most dangerous mistake of all. It's like cooking without knowing if your guest is vegetarian, allergic, or simply hates the food.

At hackathons, I see this constantly: teams building technically sophisticated and beautiful solutions, but when I ask ""who is this for?"", they look at me like I've asked them the meaning of life.

**The solution:** Once you know what problem you want to solve, explore every possible way to solve it—not just your super cool blockchain and AI approach. This helps you discover who actually has this problem and how much it hurts them.

And when you identify your users, don't assume you already know them. Create a quick form using Google Forms or TypeForm. Set up ways to talk with them through Discord, Telegram, or even WhatsApp. During the hackathon, adjust your solution based on feedback from potential users. This is real agile development, not just a buzzword to impress investors.

This information is pure gold for the future. Save it like it's Coca-Cola's secret recipe. With proper analysis, you can use this data later for marketing, improvements, pitch decks, or finding new niches you didn't even know existed.

# 🤐 Mistake #2: Not Telling Anyone About Your Project

This mistake kills more startups than competition. It's like having a great joke and never telling it.

I encourage you to talk about your project not only with potential customers but also with other teams at the hackathon, with mentors, even with teams building something similar.

Don't wait for it to be perfect before you start sharing. If you wait for perfection, you'll be waiting until your grandchildren have grandchildren.

**What happens when you talk about your project?** Two critical things: first, you improve your pitch every time you tell it—it's like practicing stand-up comedy. Second, you lose the fear and inertia that keeps you paralyzed.

Every product has a cycle we call PDCA: plan, develop, check, act—and repeat continuously. It's an infinite loop. To test, you must take risks and leave your comfort zone. Entrepreneurship is about taking calculated risks, even if it's just your reputation, your time, or someone critiquing your idea.

If you don't feel uncomfortable presenting your idea, you're not innovating enough. Innovation lives in the discomfort zone.

At hackathons, you have the perfect opportunity to practice this. Talk to everyone, receive feedback, iterate quickly. It's like speed dating, but for products.

# 💬 Mistake #3: Poor Team Communication

Let's talk about something critical: team management at hackathons, or how not to want to eliminate your teammate in 48 hours.

You'll be working intensely for days, probably with little sleep, lots of caffeine, and that feeling that time is flying. Communication is what will determine whether your team functions brilliantly or explodes spectacularly.

Communication is everything in relationships, but especially in development teams under pressure. We need to know when communication isn't working. At hackathons, too little information confuses, but too much information also kills productivity.

**The solution:** Use good communication tools, but more importantly, know how to use them without going crazy. WhatsApp for quick things and motivational memes, Slack or Discord for organization, Google Meet for important meetings where you need to see each other's tired faces.

But watch out for infinite message threads. If something needs more than three back-and-forth messages, have a five-minute video call. You'll resolve in five minutes what would take an hour and 47 misunderstandings via chat.

Attention is our most valuable resource, especially at hackathons where you're already operating with half a brain. Protect meeting time so you also have time to code, design, and actually build things.

And something super important: don't go to sleep with an unresolved communication problem. At hackathons, there's no time for drama. One problem today can become two tomorrow, and tomorrow you're already presenting with tears in your eyes.

# 🧠 Mistake #4: Relying on Your Memory

This mistake is deadly at hackathons. It's like trying to remember all your passwords without using a password manager.

Yesterday's brilliant ideas will be blurrier than your eyes after 15 hours of coding.

**The solution:** Use any system to organize tasks—Notion if you want to feel productive, Trello if you like moving cards around, a simple list in Google Docs if you're a minimalist, Kanban in GitHub Projects if you're a hardcore developer. The important thing is that everyone uses the same system, not that each person has their own ""personal and unique"" method.

When you make an agreement—and you'll make many during these days—always make it clear: who's doing it and by when. ""Maria will finish the login frontend by tomorrow at 10am,"" not ""later"" or ""when she can.""

Be specific, measurable, with no room for creative interpretations.

Even if it's an estimate, this helps measure actual time and avoid existential panic on Sunday afternoon. You can also see what phase each team member is in—whether they're in ""thinking brilliant ideas,"" ""prototyping like crazy,"" ""coding until it works,"" or ""almost done but actually everything is left"" mode.

# 🎯 Mistake #5: Not Leveraging the Hackathon to Launch

The last mistake, and perhaps the saddest, is missing the opportunity to launch something real at a hackathon. It's like going to an all-you-can-eat buffet and only eating bread.

Many teams focus so much on advanced technology that they forget about the launch. But launching at a hackathon, with this community, with these mentors, with the ecosystem support, is a unique opportunity. Don't waste it on perfectionism.

And everyone there—organizers, mentors, other teams—is committed to helping you, no matter what. Even those competing against you will help if you need it. Use that, don't be shy.

# ✅ Your Practical Survival Checklist

Here's your practical list to survive and triumph:

**Form a winning team.** Look for people who have the skills you lack. If everyone is a developer, you need someone from design or business. If everyone is ""idea people,"" you need someone who actually executes.

**Find a real problem.** Not a super cool technical solution looking for a problem to justify its existence. The world doesn't need another delivery app for dogs unless it's truly revolutionary.

**Explain your solution clearly.** If you can't explain it in 30 seconds to your grandmother who doesn't know about technology, you don't understand it either.

**Distribute tasks in your team.** Doing is what separates ideas from products. Everyone has ideas in the shower, but execution is everything.

Remember: at hackathons you have everything: technology, mentors, community, ecosystem, free wifi, and infinite coffee to make your idea a reality.

The question isn't whether you can. The question is: will you do it, or will you go home with a nice t-shirt and a story of ""what could have been""?

procrastination legit almost tanked my phd. i’d sit down to “work” and somehow end up deep-cleaning my apartment, replying to texts from three months ago, or going down youtube rabbit holes. the actual task? untouched.

the wild part is i ended up turning this exact mess into my research. i ran a study with over 1,000 people (and published a paper on it) testing if breaking tasks into ridiculously tiny subtasks + giving yourself a little reward after each one would actually help.

spoiler: it does.

and yeah, at first i thought it was the dumbest thing. like i’m a grown adult with rent and taxes and somehow the only way i can function is by giving myself micro-rewards for “adulting.” open the doc = gold star. write the title = gold star. one sentence = gold star. each time i let myself do something small:- sip coffee, check one notif, whatever.

the crazy part is it works. tasks stop feeling like huge monsters when you shrink them down into baby steps. add a tiny reward and suddenly your brain’s like “ok fine, we can do this.” in the study, people reported less dread and more willingness to start. i feel the same - it’s the only thing that consistently breaks me out of the spiral.

still procrastinate sometimes, but it doesn’t own me the way it used to. gold stars > guilt spirals.

anyone else have to trick themselves like this? do you do the five-minute rule, bribe yourself, or something else?",32,1759206035.0,selfimprovement,11,0.95,False

They now want to include a sandwich station & bakery/cake display. There is no pastry chef in the picture, nor a bakery background. How would you explain this is a bad idea?","Other than screening the Amy's Baking Company episode with them? 

The original pitch was for a Starbucks model i.e. coffee counter with food, but prepared off site & heat to serve.  This works, if the food product can be sourced.  

Some context - 

The location is in one of the highest cost of living cities in the US.

The space is *TIGHT*.  There is barely room for a 3 basin sink, a 24"" sandwich prep, & a double hammer espresso machine.  There is ZERO room for an oven or even a 3 door fridge.  

The budget is for a coffee shop.  

It is a ""destination only"" footprint, so there is little room to improve foot traffic.  

A commissary kitchen is necessary to prepare any food products.  

The clientele to sustain a coffee shop is present, but the demographic will scoff at the $10+ dessert prices demanded by the location.

I really want to cheer on success, but they seem adamant to bite off too much at the start.  Any constructive input from all y'all is more than welcome!",74,1759205991.0,KitchenConfidential,25,0.94,False
