1in52z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1in52z7/modified_work_schedules_and_ada/,Modified Work Schedules and ADA,"Hi! I wanted to ask if anyone has experience with requesting accommodations, specifically with a modified work schedule. For context, I work as a server in a small local cafe. We do everything up front, taking orders, bringing out food, making coffee, etc. all in one shift and position. I'm autistic (dx'd with Level 2, needing substantial support, for both the social communication and restricted and repetitive behavior categories), and I struggle to work more than 10 hours a week, or two 5-hour shifts. My struggles with work and school are listed in my diagnosis report. I live in a rural area, so access to employment is very limited, and my job has caused me multiple meltdowns, but the only other places I could go would be fast food, which I feel would be increasingly more demanding since we get beach traffic very often. My job is already part-time, and usually I am allowed to only work one or two days a week since I explained my disability to my manager. However, recently they have been messing with my schedule a bit by making me come in to open, which I don't mind, it's just difficult for me to open since I would be in the store by myself up front (we only have 2-3 people up front at all times) and I have difficulty navigating through interacting with customers sometimes, so it's best if I have someone nearby who I can ask to take over for me in case I get confused. They have also been requesting that I work more hours solely because the classes I have for school are online or hybrid-flex (you can attend in person, online, or watch a lecture later), so in their eyes I am free during the week, even if it is more beneficial for me to attend class. When I try to explain that two days a week, three occasionally but not multiple weeks in a row, is my limit, they kind of act like I'm just not trying hard enough, not outright saying it, but... you know. The owner has also made comments like saying I'm slow when I'm on the register, which like, yeah, I'm autistic and that's one of the things I have difficulty with. But like also the POS system is not great and is confusing to use (it runs on Windows 98 no joke; as well as the fact that I am nearsighted and have a convergence insufficiency, so my vision isn't all too great so I struggle to read sometimes). I was wondering if it would be possible to get it set in stone that I can't work too many hours a week. Before I started working there I had requested to not work more than 2 days a week and was told that it was fine (our establishment is only open 7 hours a day, 8 in summer, Monday-Saturday, and we already have shifts that start 2 hours in, making the shift around 5 hours). It's been a couple of years and now they're sorta switching up, and I don't know if there's anything I can do since this is my first and only job I've ever had. The owner doesn't know about my autism, but my manager does. I am afraid to leave because it's probably the least taxing job I can get in the area and I'm worried that if I leave I won't find anything else. I've been told that I could request to only work 2 days a week, but I don't know if I'd have support under ADA. I've also been told that I could try and file for disability, but I feel like since I can speak and communicate, even if I struggle to, people either ignore or don't see my struggles, so I feel like I'd get denied. I also do want to work, but I just can't work a lot.

  
I know this was a long and probably confusing ramble, but if anyone's had any similar experiences or advice, I'd appreciate it!",1,1739297417.0,disability,0,1.0,False

We went to college together, saw each other years later and went for coffee at the beginning of January. Everything was really great. We've been seeing each other for a month and a few days. We kissed last week. I want to take it slow.

But he told me that he likes to be dominant. And that he likes Shibari. And If I want to try it and take some photoshoot.

I suddenly don't know what to think about this and whether to continue seeing him. Because when I hear the word ""dominant"", I think of my abusive relationship. And it's all like.....I don't know. I mean, yea, I went to college with him, but we never really talked. This is all new and and don't know, fishy?

I don't know how to navigate it.

I work a pretty menial job, make decent money, but I can truly do it with my eyes closed. There isn‚Äôt any room for upward mobility. My job is also fully remote which I do mostly like, but has some security requirements that don‚Äôt allow me to leave my house to work. So I can‚Äôt get out to a coffee shop or anything like that to have a change of scenery or meet up with people. I am just at home all day with my pets doing very easy work. I am EXTREMELY grateful to have a job, a remote job at that, but I do feel under stimulated. 

That all being said, I‚Äôm looking for any ideas on where I could turn my attention to to either develop a skill or maybe even change jobs? Or just a hobby? I just need something. 

Things I am not:
- creative lol 
- artsy 

But I‚Äôm great with numbers, memory and recall is pretty high (not math, but for example I still remember every code we used for 50+ items at a job from almost 10 years ago). Organized, detail oriented. I like understanding why things work the way they do. If things make sense to me I‚Äôm more inclined to enjoy them.

1in4zip,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in4zip,30F looking for godly man,"Living in Austin, TX for almost 9 years! No children, never married. Although I do want them and perhaps adopt one as well.

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô0‚Äù, brunette, curly hair, Latina

Area of study/work: I have my own business and I enjoy what I do. I went to Texas State and graduated with a bachelors in Public Relations, although have not used it yet according to Gods plan.

About Me/Hobbies: I have a bunch of random interests. I like reading, writing, I used to do more of it but now I just journal and I enjoy reading other peoples writings on faith, life, biographies, experiences, etc. I love the outdoors, I‚Äôm a beach girl but I definitely want to see some mountains. I‚Äôm the type of person who can vacation by themselves but I would love to have a partner to do that with. I don‚Äôt watch a lot of tv, I‚Äôm very selective with what I consume, music as well. I don‚Äôt go clubbing, every once in a while I will enjoy some wine with friends, I don‚Äôt drink at home though. I like tennis (I used to play), board games, coffee shops, plant collecting, traveling. I try to eat healthy most of the time although I do love my sweet treats. I don‚Äôt smoke anything, I‚Äôm not on any prescribed meds, I don‚Äôt have any mental illnesses (I believe that‚Äôs demonic oppression but the world makes you believe it‚Äôs just you). I do enjoy living a life of material UNDERconsumption and plastic free, it‚Äôs hard but we are getting there.

Christian Journey: I did not grow up in church yet I always said I was Christian. I went with my mom to church maybe a few times but didn‚Äôt understand any of it as it was all in Spanish. I lived a life of sin until I was 28 and found Jesus in my bedroom one night after some seeking and was amazed, shocked, mesmerized at how real, alive and worthy He is. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe my whole life I called myself a Christian and didn‚Äôt even know God. But he radically saved me from a life of death, pain and darkness and I‚Äôm obsessed with Him because of who he is. I go to a gospel preaching/disciple making church, I love the Word of God, I don‚Äôt just read it, I study and listen and discern the Word. I love praying for others. I love evangelizing to who I come across. Ask me more.

What sort of person are you looking for? I‚Äôm looking for a man who truly loves Jesus and has a desire to grow in faith, never being complacent. You don‚Äôt have to know everything or be a perfect Christian as long as you desire God and HIS will. I‚Äôd like a man who is physically healthy, has great oral hygiene, emotional stability, and communicates well. Bad communication will destroy a marriage. No unhealed trauma, no family drama and please only be attracted to adult women. I love romance and would enjoy having a partner who is romantic, joyful, has flirty sarcasm, kind and cares about others and can be vulnerable and honest with his thoughts and emotions. A man who also understands what a ‚Äúhelpmate‚Äù role is biblically. I want to support you and be supported, it‚Äôs a loving partnership that displays Christ‚Äôs love, not a worldly one.

Dealbreakers: pornography, dishonesty, cheating. (What‚Äôs in the past stays there, we all made stupid choices, do not bring it into a covenant marriage)

Age range: 30-39

That‚Äôs when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I‚Äôd tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who‚Äôd been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years‚Äîand stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I‚Äôd always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn‚Äôt feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn‚Äôt just what I saw in the mirror‚Äîit was how I felt inside. There‚Äôs a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you‚Äôre living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn‚Äôt some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I‚Äôd been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised‚Äîand more.

Now, I‚Äôm not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it‚Äôs hard not to share it.

That‚Äôs when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I‚Äôd tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who‚Äôd been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed‚Äîsomething I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years‚Äîand stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I‚Äôd always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn‚Äôt feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn‚Äôt just what I saw in the mirror‚Äîit was how I felt inside. There‚Äôs a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you‚Äôre living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn‚Äôt some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I‚Äôd been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised‚Äîand more.

Seeing that sign in our front yard is causing big feelings and I need help keeping confidence that I will not regret this. 

 We have always wanted to move to Europe someday, but planned to do so after my father in law passed (cancer, he will pass sometime this year I think but there‚Äôs no telling). 

After the election, we started to process the idea of moving sooner than that - or at least securing our visa and spending time in both places (within guidelines). 

Then a role opened up on my team at work that would allow me to move to Europe and work with the folks there. So now there is a genuinely great job opportunity for me there. 

We visited Manchester in January, found an apartment complex we are happy with, started the expedited visa process last week with my work, and are listing our house this week. I have been excited mostly and sad some, but now I am feeling so worried and fearful. I‚Äôm seeing everything we loved about our home here. I‚Äôm worried I will miss it and regret it. This is me processing these feelings and hoping someone was once in my shoes too and can help encourage me. 

More thoughts:
- we haven‚Äôt told our entire family yet. Just my mom. I am terrified to tell his parents due to his dad‚Äôs illness. I plan to tell everyone it‚Äôs for my job opportunity which is definitely true, but we are also strongly influenced by the political climate. We would have waited it out if it weren‚Äôt for the brittle state of our democracy. And because we have this opportunity, we want to take it. So many people wish they had this opportunity to get out now. 

- I feel very guilty about doing this at this time with his dad. And my great grandma will probably not be with us much longer either. We are planning to spend a lot of time in the US this year even with our visas so that we can spend time with him (ensuring no more than 180 days per requirements). 

- I‚Äôm probably going to feel so stupid and lonely 6 months from now. And our apartment there is so much smaller than our current house. 

- I am excited to travel and all the experiences that come with living in a foreign country. This is a life dream of mine. It just does not feel like it in this moment. 

- what do I do about our play station and my sewing machine and my coffee maker and our Dyson vacuum ? Is there anything we can do to bring these expensive electronics with us?

But I‚Äôm also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it‚Äôs exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they‚Äôre decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I‚Äôm a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

As someone who grinds coffee daily, I was eager to see how this compact grinder would fit into my workflow. Its brushed stainless steel finish immediately caught my eye, giving off an aesthetic that‚Äôs both modern and simple. The small size makes it perfect for tight kitchen spaces, yet it looks stylish enough to leave on the counter.

The design feels sturdy for its size, which is always a plus when dealing with kitchen gadgets. At just over two pounds, it‚Äôs light yet doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. The materials‚Äîstainless steel, plastic, and rubber‚Äîseem durable, though the plastic lid might make you question its long-term resilience. The grinder‚Äôs cord storage at the base is a thoughtful touch, and the transparent lid is not just functional but adds to the stylish look.

[See Bodum Bistro 11160-57US-4PL deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/bodum-bistro-11160-57us-4pl-review-b07qm339db/)

**Grinding Performance and Mechanism**

This grinder uses a stainless steel blade that spins at a precise RPM, and while it‚Äôs not a burr grinder, it does its job well for the price range. The grind consistency isn‚Äôt perfect, as is typical for blade grinders, but it was good enough for my French press and drip coffee needs. If you‚Äôre someone who enjoys espresso, you might find the lack of uniformity in the grind a bit frustrating. I tested it for coarser grinds, and it performed decently, though achieving ultra-fine grinds for espresso is a bit of a challenge.

The simple push-button control for pulse or continuous grinding offers flexibility. I found that pulsing gave me better control over the grind size, while holding the button down for longer resulted in a finer grind. The transparent lid made it easy to monitor the grind, which is helpful if you‚Äôre aiming for a specific coarseness.

**Ease of Use and Capacity**

Using this grinder is straightforward, with no unnecessary complications. The button‚Äôs sensitivity was just right, and the pulse feature felt intuitive. With a capacity of 56.6 grams (around 2.1 ounces), it‚Äôs perfect for small batches. It‚Äôs particularly handy for single servings or preparing coffee for two people. However, if you‚Äôre brewing for a crowd, you‚Äôll need to grind in multiple batches, which could be a bit tedious.

One thing I noticed is that cleaning the grinder can be tricky since the bowl isn‚Äôt removable. Coffee grounds tend to stick to the edges, and while a quick wipe with a paper towel works, it‚Äôs not as convenient as having a detachable bowl. Including a cleaning brush would have been a thoughtful addition.

**Pros**

* Compact and stylish brushed stainless steel design.
* Simple and intuitive controls with a transparent lid.
* Decent grind consistency for French press and drip coffee.
* Lightweight and easy to store with cord management.
* Affordable, offering good value for its price.

**Cons**

* Non-removable bowl makes cleaning less convenient.
* Grind consistency isn‚Äôt ideal for espresso enthusiasts.
* Plastic lid may not feel as durable over time.
* Limited capacity for larger coffee batches.
* Slightly noisy during operation.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other blade grinders like the Krups F203 or Mr. Coffee Electric Grinder, the Bodum Bistro stands out for its design and slightly heavier build, which gives it a sturdier feel. I‚Äôve used the Krups model before, and while it offers similar grinding performance, the Bodum‚Äôs deeper bowl and stylish design give it an edge. On the downside, some competitors include cleaning brushes or removable bowls, which make maintenance easier. If you prioritize aesthetics and compactness, the Bodum shines. However, for those who value ease of cleaning, models with detachable bowls might be worth considering.

In terms of grinding precision, burr grinders like the Baratza Encore outclass the Bodum, but they‚Äôre significantly more expensive and bulkier. The Bodum is a solid option for casual coffee drinkers who don‚Äôt require the precision of a burr grinder but still want freshly ground beans.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This coffee grinder is positioned as an affordable option for beginners or casual coffee drinkers, and it delivers on that promise. While it doesn‚Äôt offer the precision or features of higher-end grinders, it‚Äôs hard to beat at its price point. Its simplicity, compact design, and decent performance make it a great starter grinder or a backup for travel. If you‚Äôre not grinding coffee for espresso machines or looking to make large quantities at once, this grinder offers good value for money.

**Features in Daily Use**

Using the Bodum Bistro daily, I appreciated its ability to grind beans quickly and efficiently. The pulse control allowed me to experiment with different grind sizes, and while it wasn‚Äôt perfect, it was consistent enough for my French press and pour-over brewing methods. I also used it to grind spices a couple of times, and it worked surprisingly well for that too. The cord storage at the base was particularly helpful when traveling, as it kept the grinder compact and easy to pack.

While I personally don‚Äôt mind the small capacity, I can see it being a limitation for those who brew larger quantities. Its noise level is standard for a blade grinder, but it might bother you if you‚Äôre grinding coffee early in the morning while others are sleeping.

1in4qhd,https://i.redd.it/0sfs1mgrtjie1.jpeg,At what point did you actually consider your collection a collection?,"I realize this is pretty open-ended, but that's actually the point. I'm curious when something you collect (or collected in the past) became a collection and not simply ""a few things I own""? Was it based off of the number of items you have? Was it intentional from the beginning that you knew you wanted to collect this item? Where are you at in your colkecting of this item? 

For reference, I (American) collect adult popup books. Not ""adult"" as in XXX-themed (although I unintentionally ended up with a few sex-themed ones along the way), but simply popup books that aren't the typical little kid type.

I started this collection in a very unintentional way. I bought my first at a used bookstore in Tokyo in 2012. It was The Pop-Up Book of Phobias and is amazing. It's a huge coffee table sized book and I lugged it around in my backpack for 2 weeks before bringing it home. A couple years later my husband discovered its companion book, ""The Pop-up Book of Nightmares,"" which he bought for me as a gift. But even then, it was just two random, cool out-of-print books in a large book collection. 

It wasn't until 2023 (over a decade after my first popup book purchase) that I intentionally started seeking out more of them. When I got to five, I started thinking of it as a hobby/collection. (I include it as a hobby because I love perusing used bookstores in person, and online searches to find unique popup books for my collection.)

Currently I have 10 popup books, and a list a mile long of wishlisted ones that I want. It's still  pretty small collection, but I am proud of it and have some much fun hunting down new ones! 

I'd love to hear the history/story of your collection. I think it's fascinating! ",1,1739296596.0,Collections,0,1.0,False

So I‚Äôm a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I‚Äôm married, have a fantastic job, travel a lot, and living a life most would be envious of. I guess it depends on what makes you envious. I don‚Äôt brag but I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs desirable, but it mostly just tears me apart.

But I‚Äôm also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it‚Äôs exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they‚Äôre decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I‚Äôm a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don‚Äôt have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

I really need someone to hear me out",". This might be a long one. But I really need some spiritual guidance and advice and other peoples perspective on this. But I'll keep it short and sweet and to the point. 

Back in 2017 I moved into my first new bachelor apartment and I had issues with my neighbor downstairs. I ended up calling the cops on him one night cause he inappropriately touched me. So the cop came he was very charming and good looking he was exactly my type. Long story short he arrests the guy and the guy was put in jail. I wanted to give him a rose than I had but he couldn't accept my gifts.  Later on months go by and I got into some activity that I shouldn't have. I won't get into it but I ended up getting a text message from a number and they said they couldn't tell me who it was that I had to figure it out. But they were upset with what I was doing. But they told me I had met him not too long ago and thought he was very hot so I figured out it was the cop messaging me and I asked specific questions to see if it was him that no one else would know and he answered them. So I'm thinking it was him and we are talking. Long story short he was telling me he's schizophrenic has hepatitis b and other stuff that I won't mention. I was trying to him help him that night we spoke if it was him. Than he said he was going to destroy everything I ever owned but the next day apologized and said he was drunk. So I left it alone. Months go by and I move into my new apartment. This is where it gets creepy. I saw him in my building parking lot and he had a very evil smile on him but didn't look human. Than my landlord came up to me and said a cop came into my apartment and was searching through all my stuff crying on my couch saying he's very worried about me and I go into my apartment and yes everything was tossed around. I also forgot to mention before I moved into my new place I had arguments with my previous landlord and called the cop station. The cop I met answered the phone. Than we spoke a bit and he suddenly three ways my old social worker on the phone and we are having a three way and I'm like how do you guys even know eachother ? But I do remember telling him that I was in love with my social worker and I only give the cop his name not where he lived. And the cop was telling him things about me. And I was embarrassed on the phone. And the cop asked me. Are you going to tell anyone what I spoke to you about ? And I said no. But accidentally told the social worker on the other line that he has schizophrenia and the cop was like do you find it funny ? What if it happened to you ? 

Well after I move into my new place I'm getting stalked by the cop. Months go by as I'm living there and strange things were happening. Someone trying to open my door in the middle of the night. Anyway. I'm trying to get on medication for my anxiety. They ended up putting me on lyrica and I ended up having a psychosis. I ran out of my apartment thinking people were coming in there to kill me. I went into the homeless shelter and woke up to a demonic voice that took a form of my sister and I heard her voice and me and my sister are not on good terms. I seen a big full moon. Than someone in my room with the lights off was laughing very evil and hysterically and suddenly took a form of a man and was waving it me it was very creepy. Than I saw black eyes on someone and someone eyes were rolling at the back of their head and it didn't seem human. Than I also saw someone with red eyes speaking in a demonic voice to me. Also someone took a form of my sister telling me how strong I am. I saw alot more stuff too but trying to get to the point. During my psychosis I had an image of my sister talking to me telling me I'm going through a psychosis but in a very annoying voice but that's how I figured I was going through a psychosis my first time going through all of this and that's where it ended and I went to the hospital. I was going through a psychosis for three months straight and lost everything. 



Afterwards I move into my dad's house and covid  began. Stayed at my dad's for three years. Stopped taking my pills cause I figured nothing was wrong with me. Than in 2022 a friend of mine passed away it was really sad and I was really depressed. So one day I was not doing good and called the cops on myself cause I was really depressed about his death wishing god would take my life instead of his. Than one day I ended up hearing my friend who passed away, his voice in my ear. And it happened twice. than at night time it was very late at night I asked God to show me a sign if he's real. Than the church bells rang at close to 12 am at night. And the church bells never ring at that time usually on Sunday during the day. Than I went outside looked at the moon and said "" do you find it funny what I'm going through "" and the moon suddenly disappeared. So I figured they didn't find it funny. But my hallucinations started again and this is where I thought I was god. Long story short I started hallucinating, one night I even felt like I should poke my eye out. But the next day I was begging for help and the sun appeared next to me really big and bright and I felt like I was healed. Than I figured I was going through another psychosis so I went to the hospital. It was a very eerie feeling too. And I saw people with black eyes that looked demonic. The psychiatrist that came to see me said in her exact words "" we were good business partners at one point "" I don't even know who she is. I just saw alot of crazy stuff than moved out of my dad's and lived somewhere else and got help. Forgot to mention when I was at the hospital I seen the cop again and it looked like him but in a different form and he just kept staring at me with black eyes. Than I had an image in my head that I was talking to myself and I said "" she's tricking you "" than later on I was sleeping and heard a man's voice saying "" I just like to scare her "" 


Later on I move into a new place.  Than months go by and I ended up moving and becoming homeless again. Forgot to take my meds too. So went through another psychosis. And one night I was really upset and I was sitting infront of a coffee shop when there was no one there and it was closed. I was yelling at karma at the time really upset and I was also facing a hotel where the windows were facing me. And once I was yelling at karma I saw three tall black figures at the hotel windows facing me and they were all men waving at me very scary and for a good few minutes. Wasn't like a human. 


I just wanna know is something out there trying to ruin my life ? Or give me a sign ? The first time it happened I wasn't in a good state and planning on moving anyway. This only happens when I plan to leave. And I have asked whatever out there to give me a sign. The last time it happened to me I did ask for a sign that this is all real. 

How would you interpret this experience. Is this a good experience or a bad one ? I think what I'm seeing and hearing is all real. It's more than just a psychosis

Leaning towards buying the BDB or the Profitec pro 600. Located in the US. [$2500],"Hello fellow addicts. We did some math recently, as I'm sure many of you have, to see if it makes financial sense to make espresso drinks at home. It's safe to say we'd break even in less than a year.

We make a lot of milk drinks, but would likely do some single shots here and there as well.

Currently doing pour-overs and aero-press at home occasionally, but we want to step it up to a real espresso machine since our local coffee shop quality has tanked (lots of turn-over). **We have a Baratza Encore grinder that seems to do well enough**. We've been doing our homework, and **the features of the BDB are very nice but we're worried about longevity as one should with any appliance**.

**We'd love a classic stainless cafe style machine like the profitec pro 600, but the higher price, longer heat-up time, less features, and more analog functionality make the BDB look more attractive (unless the analogness is a desirable feature).**

I have an engineering background and have no problem making repairs, but ideally I wouldn't have to upgrade/fix the machine for at least a few years. It looks like there are parts available for the BDB, so not concerned about repairs too much for that one.

What seems ideal to me:

* Dual boiler
* PID temp control
* Good high pressure dry steam with good wand.
* Able to make 2 milk drinks in a row without waiting.
* Pressure gauge to see if it's at 9bar.
* Good aesthetics.
* Good warranty.

Not sure if it matters:

* Flow control
* e61 group head for quality of shot (does it actually get to 9 bar and not go over?)
* hot water wand

This is a buy once, cry once, purchase for us and something that we will likely try to keep going for as many years as possible.

**Questions for you:**

Breville Dual Boiler or the Profitec Pro 600 (or similar looking and spec'd machine), and why?

Is the day to day use of the e61 group head nice to use? Does it feel like you're using a cafe quality machine everyday rather than an appliance?

Am I missing anything?

Thanks!

The apartment is about 430ish sqft and consists of a bedroom and a connected living room and kitchen. My gf is a self-described non-morning-person and does not like to communicate much for a while after she wakes. Previously, and now more recently after recovering from an injury, she has done yoga after getting out of bed during which she doesn‚Äôt like to be bothered. About a week ago we got into a big fight after I had reached down to give her a back-hug after I thought she was done and she pushed me off expressing that she would like to be left alone until she is actually done. I got a little pissy which caused an argument although this ultimately led to me agreeing that she was right and that I would leave her alone while she yogas. 

Today, she went off to do her yoga. I stayed in bed for a while after she got up before realizing I should start the laundry before work. After brushing my teeth I grabbed the laundry and was looking for my slippers so I could take the elevator to the laundry room. I realized they were in the corner of the living room where my gf was doing yoga. Mind you the living room has a coffee table which she moved and has only enough remaining room for a person and a yoga mat. She was laying on her back with her eyes closed and headphones on, so I thought it would be ok to step over her arm to reach my shoes.  I grabbed them and quietly left to go start the load, but to my dismay, when I returned she appeared in a really bad mood. I asked her what was up to which she responded that she felt incredibly disrespected and that I had crossed boundaries she had set during our last fight.

So to you I ask, AITAH for feeling that since we chose to live in this tiny space together and because I neither talked to her nor touched her that it seems unreasonable to feel disrespected by me entering one of the three tiny spaces we have? To be as fair as I can writing this, she said I could have gotten another pair of shoes which is true, albeit I only have one pair of slippers. And that she only asks to have 25 minutes a day where I can‚Äôt go in the living room.

Thanks anyone and u/darthluiggi for any insights to guide me before the next bootcamp! 

Background: 

Stats:  41y, FTM guy, 5'2, 135lb,  I take testosterone.  BF% (tape measured) by 'F' calculations = 23% (lean body weight 103) 'M' cals = 13.6% (lean body weight 115). I do have excess skin from too many prior weigh loss/gains cycles that a surgeon has said is skin/not fat but since its not muscle, i'm guessing it just counts as fat (?) 

Strength Training:  3-6 days a week I do 1-1.5hours of truly vigorous Ashtanga yoga, with a lot of focus on active isometric holds and a focus on strength more than flexibility (thats a solid bonus tho!) I can't do anything HIIT b/c I have a cardiac defibrillator (S-ICD) & even with a beta-blocker can't allow my HR to go over 140. Sadly most KB manuevers gets me there too quickly- even during some of the yoga sequence I have to slow down.  Trying to get into lifting basics enough to hit the ground running for next bootcamp. 

Ketosis/Carb Intake: Back into ketosis now for 2 months & I can easily stay in Ketosis at 35 net carbs a day.  Experimenting has shown me if I have 50 net carbs, it takes 14-16hrs to get back into nutritional ketosis (but two 50carb days in a row took 2 days to get back into keto on 20net carbs). Also, last week when I did a very non-Ketogains manuever/ experiment & tracked my 150carb-up day (105g protein, fat to satiety/in caloric maintenance range)- it took 20hrs and was back in nutritional ketosis. (testing with ketomojo). Last night ended up going off plan for impromptu date night (I know I know, I wont do it during bootcamp, lol!) I didn't track macros but had a lot of protein AND also had carbs in the form of a cocktail/a desert/and whatever they shove in a meatball. It's of note because I finished eating at 7pm yesterday and at noon today I am back to 1.1 ketones. Currently preferring the 35carb to 20carb lifestyle b/c it lets me have a lot of wholefoods/nutrient dense salads and an occasional mezcalah bar that satisfies something texturally for me (#harmreduction?)

M/F Protein Targets & Pre-Ketogains: I have slightly elevated creatinine levles (nephrologist examined w/additional tests & ""not worried but monitoring but don't go crazy on the protein."" Now that I've been keto for 2 months, I plan to get labwork end of this week to see where things are- but lets say we're still in a-o-k-landia... If we go by 'F' my 0.8-1.2g per lean lb is 85-125g protein. If we go by 'M' its  90-130g. Reviewing my last 2 months in Cronometer, I've gone between 85-110g. 

Questions: 

1. What do you think about my taking the PWO before I do my 1-1.5hr ashtanga? I think how quickly I can bounce back to 0.8-1.1 circulating ketones after isolated (1 week apart) higher carb days might say something about the quality of this as strength training even if its not traditionally thought of as such? 

2. BF Calc is headscratching since I'm trans. I'm trying to remember the caloric difference is just 165cal daily, but I really don't want to gain weight that isn't muscle as it will likely feminize my apperance. If I go to with 'F' calculations Kegogains calculator says I should aim for 103g base and 125 including PWO- this is on par with where I am now calorically most days & I could shift macros so I'm doing less fat and more protein. This caloric range intuitively feels right, BUT the 'M' 115 base protein isn't that far off from what I hit often now . Plus, my cronometer is synced to my apple watch and activity set to sedentary see what is added to cronometer should just be what I DO not project & there are many days where I am very active and cronometer suggests I burned 2000-2200 calories.  (Given I want to recomp- I dont ever eat to meet the caloric # it says I burned) Factoring in creatinine awareness, I wonder if I should be aiming for 110 as baseline and 125-130 as PWO- nice middle ground for an in-betweener-like-myself? haha. Then I'd calculate 35 carbs & fat to satiety (but not like, less than 90g)? Thoughts? 

3. I tried to scan lots of posts before asking anything and read the entire wiki but are there thoughts/benefits to going for 20 net carbs for recomp if I'm in consistently at ketosis at 35 and bounce back quickly from carb ups? 

4. Whey Protein Isolate has been messing my gut up badly unfortunately; and GI malarchy is what sent me to keto on my knees in the first place. I'm willing to try titrating up if there's some whey adaptation process (is there?) but I've been doing hemp seeds blended into mushroom coffee with MCT oil powder instead. I'm trying to find the research to understand why whey is preferable to seed protein like hemp- not trying to avoid the work, but I can't find it in the wiki- would love the guidance so I can find the right combo for this body & any concerns with subbing hemp or ""Naked Seed"" (chia/pumpkin/sunflower/watermelon seed only) for the whey?

After all these countless years when high and precise temps have been a necessity. Ummm..

I have so many questions, here's some:

Why since this day light roasts extracted with a high end dual boiler commercial machine has always tasted simply much better than with cheaper end home/prosumer machines, often producing nearly undrinkable salty acidity.

Why after all the years of doing this I still haven't been able to pull shots out of ultra light coffees that wouldn't taste deadly sour with my Simonelli Oscar Hx machine (it has a declining temp profile and hardly high enough starting temperature for ultra light roasts). That machine seems to excel only for darker more traditional roasts as per the general consensus (and my tastebuds) say. With as minimal as possible hx flush I still can't get hot enough water out of that thing, it seems.

Suddenly a cheap Delonghi is just as good or even better than say Linea Mini, because with Mini you can't get a declining temp profile without modifications. Even group head water distribution, precise starting temp, gentle pressure build up with pre infusions yada yada is not important anymore. You'll get the great shot with just a Delonghi. Weaknesses are suddenly turning to strengths and vice versa.

Don't get me wrong I like Lances videos mostly, but man I'm confused about this one.

Is the guy just developed such nerdy tastebuds and next level understanding of flavors we regular people can't understand?

We will be visiting USD. We have been to SD before and stayed at Manchester Grand Hyatt. We enjoyed Seaport Village but I think we would like to stay somewhere else this time. We will have a rental car. Priorities for a hotel include: not a huge skyscraper, safe area that we can walk places for good food, coffee, local shops etc. ocean/water view would be great but since it will March beach/pool aren‚Äôt super important. Would also love a place that we wouldn‚Äôt need to us an elevator (we got stuck in an elevator on a trip before and while it‚Äôs not a dealbreaker we definitely prefer places where we could book a room and not need an elevator). Not looking for a party vibe, someplace quiet and peaceful. We have visited La Jolla for a day before and really enjoyed that area. Hotels around there the piqued our interest: Estancia La Jolla, La Jolla Shores, and Valencia. Also considering hotels on Coronado and The Pearl Hotel at Point Loma. Other than visiting USD, we don‚Äôt have big plans other than eating, relaxing and exploring the area. We have been to most of the tourist locations on our past trip (although we don‚Äôt make it to Balboa Park or Old Town last time so we may try to visit those).

1in4gud,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1in4gud/whats_the_point/,Whats the point?,"

So Background: I was a pretty average kid all throughout my life. My parents almost never scolded me, let me fail, let me fall, let me get up, they were there if I ever needed them. I became a pretty extroverted teen as well. My schooling was all boy, college went during the morning so that was all boys as well, did CA most of it (tuitions) online/else very close to home. I also had a very turbullent relationship mith my father during my early teens, I never really figured out why I acted the way I behaved with him during that phase of my life, I guess every boy goes through that phase where he just can't stand his father. Then I landed in my first articleship firm, was a pretty decent experience. But I quit why father was diagnosed with end stage CKD (kidney disease/failure), he had to get dialysis. My sibling had just switched jobs and exhausted all his leaves within the first month because of this event. I quit my articleship after having a fight with my Principal who said something off about my father's hospitalisation and the whole situation. Then I got my articleship at another place where they allowed me to take wed off and work on Sat/sun to compensate for that so that I could take my father for dialysis.

During this phase, I cared for him as a son would, my behaviour changed for him. 2 years passed like this. During this time, since it was in between COVID and whatnot I became kinda isolated from my usual crowd of people as well. He became my wall, who I would rant out to.

Then he got a Kidney Transplant, I also appeared for my CA exams and got through. I even got a job pretty quick. My joining though was late and I decided I would pursue MBA soon. His health was great after the transplant. Up untill I cleared my CA and got the job. His health was bad since that very day. We were in and out of hospitals every 5-6 days, this went on for 7 months. During these hospitalisatons, every part pf his body was pierced, so much blood tested, so much pain, so many medicines, so many side effects. This was after ne and my brother being literal germ freaks, killing off any outside air inti his room, without being air purified, his utensils washed and sterilised, his clothes sterlised, his washroom cleaned 3 times a day with chemicals used in ICUs, no stranger being allowed even in our living room without a mask and sanitisers.

Ultimately, we found out he had acquired a rare disease. The medication was no magic bullet, survival was rare. He got a cardiac arrest, brain stroke and what not when he was undergoing the treatment. Ultimately, the day came when his organs started to fail, the hospital people kept CPR cycles on to keep his heart pumping. I had to literally wrestle and shout at my elder brother to let my father go. I signed his DNR. I signed for his death certificate. I signed for his body. I accompanied him in the last ride from the hospital to our home.

I didn't cry, I held on so that my family could cry. A few months after, I joined that job. I met a great set of people. They didn't probe much into why head was bald or why it looked like I was a racoon. I had not slept properly ever since my father started getting hospitalised. When the first salary hit, I had no one to share that joy with. Yes my Mother was happy, but I could see it in her eyes.

I have become so introverted that I am always in ""speak only when spoken to"" mode. I did my job decently, the line managers never came back with a complaint for my work. Why that all boys up-bringing was mentioned. I had minimal female interaction all throughout my teens, but I wasn't scared of girls or afraid to talk to them. At work, a girl started being extra friendly with me. But I was just not in the right state of mind. If she used to sit at one seat, I used to keep a seats gap and sit. But I would always text her back, help where I could, but I just was always in the speak when spoken to mode. Its not that I didn't like her, of course I did. This has happened to me only once before in my life during my articleship days, and back then I was just so full of myself, a total asshole that I just never thought of the person on the otherside having any feelings. I left that job for another job, the pay was good, I got a very great hike say 60-70%. I hadn't even applied, it was one of my remaining friends who had shared my CV. After I left that job, one of the guys called me one day. He has no parents, I guess that why he didn't care for my numb behaviour. He told me X really liked you, but you were always ""rude"" to her. You always are ""rude"" to people, while my friends back there were of course happy for me, this was something that bothered me. I started noticing things, I could not hold eye contact with anybody anymore. I faked my happiness at home in front of my family, but when alone in my room, the question always comes back to haunt me - ""What's the point?""

What's the point of me toiling so hard? What's the point of me getting a new job, with great pay? What's the point of me? I then started to think, maybe I lost my confidence my will because of the way I have started to look, I never looked handsome, neither average, but was pretty decently put together (something I inherited from my father). I have started balding visibly, look older than people my age. I started exercising, started getting treatment for my hair/skin. Got some benefir as well. But at the end, I just come back to that one question always- What's the point of me looking good?

At my new job today, since the culture is pretty flattish, a manager got me to have a coffee chat with him. Mid of the conversation, they ask me why are you so stressed? I had no answer. I met somebody I knew from before there, I tried avoiding them as much as I could, but ultimately got paired with them. They asked-don't you remember me? I just said no, wasn't sure it was you. I can't hold eye contact anymore.

Even as the day moved ahead, since I was new and was not alloted any work yet- as I looked outside that building-the same question came haunting- What's the point?

My father had become my only friend for me, for me he was the end of my world, I lost that battle. My ambition found strength in him, with him gone, I don't want anything. My spark's gone. The road ahead I see is dark, I hold on only because my mother is alive. Wihen she goes, I have no duty left, I have no will left. 

I can't cry even today, I have gone numb. Brief moments of physical pain might be the only thing I have felt in the last few months. All happiness, sadness, fear taste the same-bland.

I keep coming back in my head to What's the fkin point? Even if I stop existing tomorrow my mother will be taken care of by my sibling. I can just abandon my duty. When I sleep that day comes back as vivid as possible, me signing those papers, me taking him home. 

I think I will never find closure, I will always be at the brink of crying, I will always find that question coming back to me- What's the point?

How do I make sure I don't abandon my duty? After that I feel my mind and body are ready for the gallows.

**Chapter 5: Walls Closing In**

That night, after David walked out of our apartment, leaving behind the shattered remains of my trust. I kept telling myself I was being irrational, that he wasn‚Äôt lurking in the shadows waiting to strike. But every time I closed my eyes, I could feel his presence, like a parasite burrowing into my skull.

The paranoia was all-consuming. I triple-checked the locks from that night on, I moved my bed against the door, and kept a baseball bat within arm‚Äôs reach. Every notification on my phone made my heart skip a beat. Every unknown number calling felt like a knife pressed against my throat. The feeling of being watched was relentless, sometimes so strong that I would whip around, fists clenched, expecting to find him standing right there, grinning like he had all the time in the world.

Katie and Clark tried to comfort me, but their words felt thin, like a weak net trying to catch a hurricane.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be okay, Zander,‚Äù Katie whispered one night, brushing her fingers through my hair. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre figuring this out. We‚Äôre fighting back.‚Äù

I wanted to believe her. I really did. But David wasn‚Äôt just some asshole sending death threats over Twitter. He was meticulous, patient, and he had spent years digging into my life like a worm in rotting wood. He knew my patterns, my fears, my limits. And now that his mask was off, I had no idea what he would do next.

Clark, ever the optimist, took a more direct approach.

‚ÄúWe need to hit him where it hurts,‚Äù he said, pacing around the living room like a general planning a war.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs committed multiple felonies, Z. If we get the right evidence, he‚Äôs done.‚Äù

Identity theft. Credit card fraud. Property damage. Maybe even attempted murder.

There was enough to bury him, but the problem was proving it beyond a doubt. David was smart. He never left breadcrumbs unless he wanted you to follow them. And the thought of playing into one of his games made my stomach churn.

Isaac and Ivan offered to help, their tech knowledge proving invaluable. They started combing through the mess David had made: fake accounts, digital paper trails, anything that could link back to him. But I had a growing, gnawing feeling in my gut that something was off about those two. I ignored it at first. Paranoia was eating me alive, and the last thing I needed was to start suspecting my own friends.

Then David escalated.

My car tires were slashed in the middle of the night. A brick with the words ‚ÄúYou Lose‚Äù in jagged black marker was thrown through our apartment window, nearly hitting Katie. Police reports were filed, but without proof of who did it, there was nothing they could do.

Then the emails started.

Photos of me sleeping in my room. Of Katie walking alone at night. Of Clark at his job, completely unaware that someone was watching him from the shadows. Each email came with a short, mocking message.

*Almost got her tonight. Maybe tomorrow.*

*Clark‚Äôs routine is so predictable. Should I test it?*

*Sleep tight, Zander. Oh wait, you don‚Äôt sleep anymore, do you?*

While I saved each and every one of those emails, I knew deep down that burner accounts wouldn't be much help to my case, but Katie told me we needed the evidence for whenever we uncover David's relation with those emails.

The walls of our apartment felt like they were closing in, suffocating me. I stopped leaving the house. Every time someone knocked on the door, my body tensed, ready for a fight. I was losing my grip, and David knew it.

But my friends weren‚Äôt about to let me crumble.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre taking the fight to him,‚Äù Katie said, her voice steel. ‚ÄúHe thinks he‚Äôs untouchable? Let‚Äôs prove him wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can tie the identity theft to his IP,‚Äù Ivan said, typing furiously on his laptop. ‚ÄúIf we can get access to-‚Äù

But he stopped. Isaac and Ivan shared a look. A tense, fleeting moment of hesitation.

A pit formed in my stomach.

‚ÄúWhy do you two look like you just saw a ghost?‚Äù I asked slowly.

Isaac swallowed. ‚ÄúZander, there‚Äôs something we should probably tell you.‚Äù

The world slowed as they explained.

They had met David at the boot camp back in summer before me and David's Senior Year.

He wasn‚Äôt just another student, he was brilliant. The kind of person who could rewrite code with his eyes closed, who could break into systems without breaking a sweat. Beyond the intimidating frame of a muscular jock, the brains he had were almost too much to believe he was a real person and not a talking, walking computer. And he had friends. People who owed him favors. People who wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to tear apart my life if he asked.

Isaac and Ivan told me they had helped him, unknowingly at first. They thought they were assisting with harmless pranks, but by the time they realized what was really happening, it was too late. We were kids back then, they didn't fully understand how catfishing and creating false tweets could¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me,‚Äù I said, voice shaking, ‚Äúthat this entire time, you‚Äôve been working with the guy who‚Äôs been trying to ruin my life?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know it was you,‚Äù Ivan said quickly. ‚ÄúBy the time we figured it out, David already had too much control over everything.‚Äù

I saw red. My hands balled into fists. Everything inside me screamed to hit something, to lash out, to break anything in reach. But I didn‚Äôt. I forced myself to breathe.

‚ÄúWe can fix this,‚Äù Isaac said. ‚ÄúWe want to fix this.‚Äù

I wanted to believe them. I needed to believe them. They apologized for hours that felt like days unending. I found it in myself to forgive them, mainly because I needed their skills and intelligence. They even offered to teach me the roads, I agreed.

Even if it was hard for me to understand the complicated language of technology, I decided it would be a skill I better learn soon enough for my own survival. David had been studying computers for longer than me, but if I know anything about David is that he's stubborn, maybe rightly so, but almost always refuses to learn new stuff. That's the weakness I was going to exploit.

A couple months passed, I got better and even started helping Ivan and Isaac crack down David's online activities. But then, everything came crashing down, and I believe the reason is that we got too close to get him.

Katie and Clark were supposed to meet me at a coffee shop to go over our next steps. They never showed up.

I called. No answer.

I texted. No response.

I went to their jobs. Nothing.

I looked in our apartment. No sign of them.

Then, a final email came through. It was, of course, from David Fucking King.

*Two down. Ready to play for real?*

A video file was attached. My fingers trembled as I tapped it open.

The footage was grainy, dark, but I could make out the shapes of two figures, tied to chairs. Katie and Clark. They were unconscious, or worse. A shadow moved in the background. David‚Äôs voice came through, altered to the point of unrecognizability. But I knew it was him.

‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve stopped when you had the chance, Zander.‚Äù

The video cut out.

The room spun. My breath came in short gasps. This wasn‚Äôt a game anymore. It had never been a game.

David wasn‚Äôt just trying to ruin my life, he was now trying to get rid of everyone I cared about.

And I had no idea how to stop him.",2,1739295932.0,creepcast,0,0.75,False

We just went in a trip alone, our first in a very long time with just us. There have been many times on the trip where he has accused me in a nasty way of being controlling. In my mind I‚Äôm giving an opinion or being helpful. I think this is the best example: he injured his feet by stepping on sea urchins and to help he had to soak them in vinegar. We went to the market to get the vinegar and look for something to put it in. We went to the aisle with the vinegar and he doesn‚Äôt look at price and grabs one. I see one on sale and say let‚Äôs get this instead. Next to the foil containers isle. He chose a very large one. I suggested two loaf size instead and he instantly went down the controlling hole. I stayed calm and said can I explain why and said each foot would fit in one and require less vinegar to submerge it as much as possible. He said fine, in huff. I said I‚Äôm just making a suggestion and that sometimes he makes suggestions that are better and sometimes I do. That it‚Äôs a partnership. 

Today we‚Äôre driving to the airport and stop for coffee. The car is close but out of sure and all our stuff is in it. I don‚Äôt hear him lock the car so I ask if he did and he flies off about for we‚Äôre only going around the corner. Well I care about my stuff and not dealing with losing it so I insisted he lock it.  I‚Äôm from a city and never leave a car unlocked.

Saturday afternoon I tweaked my back a bit at work and that quickly escalated to me needing a cane to get around even in the house. I was on alternating ice and heat and OTC pain meds (even nicked some prescription stuff from a roommate which helped a little but not enough) for two days with no improvement, and the pain got so bad last night I went to the ER, where they diagnosed me with severe sciatica and a 6mm kidney stone, gave me a stack of prescriptions and a work excuse for two days to recover.

I called work early this morning (since naturally I fell asleep when I got home they'd given me a ton of pain medication) to let my boss know I'd be out for two days (I was scheduled for overnight audit shift) she told me to call the other guy who works night shift and see if he could cover. I left him a Voicemail. He didn't call me back but called the hotel directly to say he couldn't work. So there's ostensibly no one to cover this shift (my boss can, she just likely doesn't want to).

This is where I might be TA. I told my boss I was sorry to hear that, and as a compromise I would see if the pain meds and anti inflammatory meds would work and get me to where I could work the shift I have tomorrow and just not come in today, so they'd only have the one day they needed to cover,as long as someone else could brew coffee cause the urns are too heavy for me to lift (I'm still walking with the cane). She got really passive aggressive and told me to bring in my Dr's note (they've never asked for one before and I already said in the conversation I'd bring one). I'm really frustrated with all this because this is the same job where I had to work day shift two days having tested positive for the flu (and being an achy useless zombie thusly), and because when I got hired on she said everyone is trained for every shift so that this kind of thing doesn't happen.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, and older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. As much as I feel bad to say this, I'm not comfortable writing with someone new to this hobby. I'm sorry!
7. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! While I don't expect a college-grade essay by any means, I do like when someone's opening message gives me a good idea of who am I talking to. What I do want to know is how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete in terms of ideas, so don't worry, I am not asking that of you, either! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway.

At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race!

1in42i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/1in42i5/whats_the_point/,Whats the point?,"So Background: I was a pretty average kid all throughout my life. My parents almost never scolded me, let me fail, let me fall, let me get up, they were there if I ever needed them. I became a pretty extroverted teen as well. My schooling was all boy, college went during the morning so that was all boys as well, did CA most of it (tuitions) online/else very close to home. I also had a very turbullent relationship mith my father during my early teens, I never really figured out why I acted the way I behaved with him during that phase of my life, I guess every boy goes through that phase where he just can't stand his father. Then I landed in my first articleship firm, was a pretty decent experience. But I quit why father was diagnosed with end stage CKD (kidney disease/failure), he had to get dialysis. My sibling had just switched jobs and exhausted all his leaves within the first month because of this event. I quit my articleship after having a fight with my Principal who said something off about my father's hospitalisation and the whole situation. Then I got my articleship at another place where they allowed me to take wed off and work on Sat/sun to compensate for that so that I could take my father for dialysis.

During this phase, I cared for him as a son would, my behaviour changed for him. 2 years passed like this. During this time, since it was in between COVID and whatnot I became kinda isolated from my usual crowd of people as well. He became my wall, who I would rant out to.

Then he got a Kidney Transplant, I also appeared for my CA exams and got through. I even got a job pretty quick. My joining though was late and I decided I would pursue MBA soon. His health was great after the transplant. Up untill I cleared my CA and got the job. His health was bad since that very day. We were in and out of hospitals every 5-6 days, this went on for 7 months. During these hospitalisatons, every part pf his body was pierced, so much blood tested, so much pain, so many medicines, so many side effects. This was after ne and my brother being literal germ freaks, killing off any outside air inti his room, without being air purified, his utensils washed and sterilised, his clothes sterlised, his washroom cleaned 3 times a day with chemicals used in ICUs, no stranger being allowed even in our living room without a mask and sanitisers.

Ultimately, we found out he had acquired a rare disease. The medication was no magic bullet, survival was rare. He got a cardiac arrest, brain stroke and what not when he was undergoing the treatment. Ultimately, the day came when his organs started to fail, the hospital people kept CPR cycles on to keep his heart pumping. I had to literally wrestle and shout at my elder brother to let my father go. I signed his DNR. I signed for his death certificate. I signed for his body. I accompanied him in the last ride from the hospital to our home.

I didn't cry, I held on so that my family could cry. A few months after, I joined that job. I met a great set of people. They didn't probe much into why head was bald or why it looked like I was a racoon. I had not slept properly ever since my father started getting hospitalised. When the first salary hit, I had no one to share that joy with. Yes my Mother was happy, but I could see it in her eyes.

I have become so introverted that I am always in ""speak only when spoken to"" mode. I did my job decently, the line managers never came back with a complaint for my work. Why that all boys up-bringing was mentioned. I had minimal female interaction all throughout my teens, but I wasn't scared of girls or afraid to talk to them. At work, a girl started being extra friendly with me. But I was just not in the right state of mind. If she used to sit at one seat, I used to keep a seats gap and sit. But I would always text her back, help where I could, but I just was always in the speak when spoken to mode. Its not that I didn't like her, of course I did. This has happened to me only once before in my life during my articleship days, and back then I was just so full of myself, a total asshole that I just never thought of the person on the otherside having any feelings. I left that job for another job, the pay was good, I got a very great hike say 60-70%. I hadn't even applied, it was one of my remaining friends who had shared my CV. After I left that job, one of the guys called me one day. He has no parents, I guess that why he didn't care for my numb behaviour. He told me X really liked you, but you were always ""rude"" to her. You always are ""rude"" to people, while my friends back there were of course happy for me, this was something that bothered me. I started noticing things, I could not hold eye contact with anybody anymore. I faked my happiness at home in front of my family, but when alone in my room, the question always comes back to haunt me - ""What's the point?""

What's the point of me toiling so hard? What's the point of me getting a new job, with great pay? What's the point of me? I then started to think, maybe I lost my confidence my will because of the way I have started to look, I never looked handsome, neither average, but was pretty decently put together (something I inherited from my father). I have started balding visibly, look older than people my age. I started exercising, started getting treatment for my hair/skin. Got some benefir as well. But at the end, I just come back to that one question always- What's the point of me looking good?

At my new job today, since the culture is pretty flattish, a manager got me to have a coffee chat with him. Mid of the conversation, they ask me why are you so stressed? I had no answer. I met somebody I knew from before there, I tried avoiding them as much as I could, but ultimately got paired with them. They asked-don't you remember me? I just said no, wasn't sure it was you. I can't hold eye contact anymore.

Even as the day moved ahead, since I was new and was not alloted any work yet- as I looked outside that building-the same question came haunting- What's the point?

My father had become my only friend for me, for me he was the end of my world, I lost that battle. My ambition found strength in him, with him gone, I don't want anything. My spark's gone. The road ahead I see is dark, I hold on only because my mother is alive. Wihen she goes, I have no duty left, I have no will left. 

I can't cry even today, I have gone numb. Brief moments of physical pain might be the only thing I have felt in the last few months. All happiness, sadness, fear taste the same-bland.

I keep coming back in my head to What's the fkin point? Even if I stop existing tomorrow my mother will be taken care of by my sibling. I can just abandon my duty. When I sleep that day comes back as vivid as possible, me signing those papers, me taking him home. 

I think I will never find closure, I will always be at the brink of crying, I will always find that question coming back to me- What's the point?

How do I make sure I don't abandon my duty? After that I feel my mind and body are ready for the gallows.

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 21 years old of age, and older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. At the moment of writing this advert, I will absolutely **not** write with cisgender men.
6. As much as I feel bad to say this, I'm not comfortable writing with someone new to this hobby. I'm sorry!
7. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded.

So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Me and this guy I'll call tom had started dating in 2022 or 2021. (I'm a bit foggy on the dates) I had moved to wear I currently live due to family complications in 2019 and started going to my uncle's church and thats when I met Tom.  

Tom and I talked but we weren't very close. I had a crush on him at that time but due to the craziness in my life I didn't make any moves on him or hint that I liked him. Fast forward to about 2021 or 2022 by now my life had calmed down but I was still emotionally healing I still went to the same church as him. I was talking to this guy from my collage. We were texting and chatting but he started to get dry and gousted me. So after a few weeks or so I decided it was time to move on. So I decided maybe I would try and date Tom since I still liked him. 

So long story short we went on a few dates. On one of these dates we went on a walking bridge and I was carrying my purse. He offered to carry my purse but being the stubborn independent person I was back then I said no, but he was a persistent gentleman and carried my bag anyway and said ""no let me do it its what a good boyfriend would do"". Now here is where I regret my actions. After the date I got really upset that he assumed he was my boyfriend and on Sunday the next week he found out that i was upset about it but we had already scedualed a date for after church so its safe to say it was awkward. On the ride home he apologized and I said I forgave him (with a bad tone so that didn't help) and by the next week we were broken up. After we broke up we were kinda snarky with eachother but other the years we've learn to co exist and get along. In fact on a missions trip he forgot his wallet and I payed for his coffee, thats what really kickstarted the relationship again.

 So now that we made up I found myself crushing on him a again and there were a few times I thought that he might've been intrested. I obviously told my gal pals about this one of those gal pals being a girl we'll call Eve. Then a few months later Tom confided in me that he likes Eve ans obviously I was crushed but also suprised since their such opposite personalities. 

But I decided to play cupid like I do for all of my friends and I set them up. Eve asked me if it was ok and I gave a half hearted yes, but what else was I supposed to say? Asking your friend if you can date their ex is an awkward position to put someone in. Now it's super awkward between me and her and I have to see them talking and laughing every Sunday.

1in3rxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1in3rxo/theralite_review_a_reliable_therapy_lamp_for/,Theralite review: A reliable therapy lamp for gloomy days,"Testing the Theralite light therapy lamp for a few weeks was an illuminating experience‚Äîliterally. As someone who often battles low energy during the winter months, having a lamp promising 10,000 lux of bright, UV-free light was intriguing. I used it daily, typically during my morning coffee ritual, and I found it blended seamlessly into my routine. However, while it offers remarkable benefits, this therapy lamp isn‚Äôt without its quirks.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The minimalist white finish and the lightweight plastic material make the lamp aesthetically pleasing, but it feels a tad fragile in hand. Weighing 4.7 pounds, it‚Äôs sturdy enough to stay in place on a flat surface but doesn't exude a premium feel. Assembly was straightforward, although the screws felt a bit short, making me wonder about long-term durability.

[Find the best price for Theralite FGP83000 0000 on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product/theralite-fgp83000-0000-review-b07hm7q6cp/)

**Light Intensity & Settings**  
The lamp delivers an impressive 10,000 lux brightness, which is ideal for combating seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Its four brightness levels allow users to adjust the light intensity based on their comfort. I usually kept it on the highest setting for a morning energy boost, and it genuinely made a difference in my alertness. However, the highest brightness might be too intense for those sensitive to light, so the adjustability is a welcome feature.

**Color Temperature & Spectrum**  
This lamp emits a soft, daylight-like white light that feels natural. While it doesn‚Äôt have a blue light option, its warm yet bright tone is effective for light therapy. I didn‚Äôt experience any harsh glare, and the light spread evenly across my workspace.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating the lamp is simple due to the touch-sensitive power button. However, this button is overly sensitive, which led to a few accidental activations. One night, I brushed the base while reaching for my phone, and it startled both me and my partner with its sudden brightness. A more tactile or recessed button design would be a huge improvement.

**Portability & Size**  
The lamp is compact and fits well on my desk. At 22 inches in height, it towers over my workspace, providing light from above, which is ideal for therapy. However, the base could be a little more weighted to counterbalance the lamp‚Äôs top-heavy design.

**Safety & Eye Comfort**  
Being UV-free, the lamp is safe for prolonged use, and I didn‚Äôt notice any flickering, which is a relief for sensitive eyes. It‚Äôs also clinically tested, offering reassurance about its effectiveness for light therapy.

**Pros**

* Adjustable brightness levels to suit different preferences.
* Compact and space-saving design.
* Emits 10,000 lux of consistent, UV-free light.
* Clinically tested for light therapy benefits.
* Easy to assemble and use.

**Cons**

* Touch-sensitive power button can activate unintentionally.
* Top-heavy design may lead to instability on uneven surfaces.
* Plastic construction feels less durable.
* Adjustment knob can be stiff and tricky.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to similar products like the Verilux HappyLight, the Theralite FGP83000 0000 is slightly bulkier but offers better adjustability with its height and angle settings. The HappyLight, in contrast, is more compact and portable but requires close proximity for the same brightness effect. Another competitor, the Circadian Optics Lumos, boasts a sleeker design and more customizable light temperature options, but it comes at a higher price point. Theralite strikes a balance between functionality and affordability, though its touch sensor design could use refinement.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Priced competitively, the Theralite FGP83000 0000 offers great value for its features, especially the 10,000 lux brightness and clinical testing. While its build quality might not scream luxury, it provides effective light therapy at a fraction of the cost of high-end models. If you‚Äôre seeking a functional and budget-friendly option, this lamp is worth considering.

This lamp has undeniably improved my mornings, especially during overcast days when the lack of sunlight can sap my energy. My wife even started borrowing it for her early morning yoga sessions, claiming it‚Äôs the perfect wake-up companion.

However ive always been an athlete and a footballer at state level and never went into AF. 

However, started lifting heavy and intermittent fasting last year jan onwards. And used pre workout only half with 100mg caffeine and morning normal coffee and one day in October i had a feeling of severe fatigue at night after a day of gym+ sports. Thought its normal. Next morning flu like symptoms so rested. 5 days later went to the gym and 2-3 days later had my first ever crash. 

As a doctor myself i showed to the best doctors out there and got every test you can name but no diagnosis. Till i took things in my own hand and found out it could be AF. 

SYMPTOMS- no energy, bed ridden, anxiety, eventually depression, brain dog, blurred vision and most depressing was loss of muscle mass especially from my arms. 

Took a month of rest and supplementation with vit c, ashwagandha, low sugary fruits and even a pomegranate gave me jitters idk lol to get back to normal routine. Then i modified my workouts and I remember i was back to normal pretty much in over a month. 

However, couple days back ive had those evening after workout after dinner crashes again where suddenly im depleted. Even video games seem taxing or big room lights. 

Scared if its AF again cos i have ptsd from last time. Ive had covid thrice, dengue and what not but AF effed me the hardest. 

Still haven‚Äôt gained the muscle in my forearms, neck is fat oddly and belly fat is always there despite eating good, regular exercise and good habits. Also i dont smoke or drink since years.

Currently, it's miter box, and the top is an epoxy resin river. I don not want it to overhang, it fits into the miter, making it look like it is all one piece, sort of. I am going to take the router around the edges and hide the lid even more, like a secret compartment. If I install a lift hinge to bring the table top up, there will be nowhere to grab since there is no overhang.

My idea is to create a mechanism that pops it up from beneath the coffee table with a button. I somehow need to get this button to unlock and lift. I would want it to pop up and inch maybe, just enough to get your fingers under there so you can lift it up to it's full height. This is the part that I need help with, not sure how to go about getting a button to handle this since it's not electrical and has no motors.

**Grendale IV, Mining Outpost Operations Center**

The air in the operations center was thick with the smell of burnt circuitry and scorched metal. The battle had ended hours ago, but the echoes of combat still lingered‚Äîdamaged vehicles being hauled in, wounded troopers being patched up, and scavenged wreckage being cataloged.

Captain Elias Cole sat at the head of a battered metal table, nursing a steaming cup of coffee. Around him, his officers were gathered‚ÄîLieutenant Darryn Holt, Sergeant Celia Wei, Senior Technician Rolf Grigori, and DropShip Captain Lenora Bryce, who had come down from *In The Mood* after the fight. A large holomap of the outpost and surrounding region flickered with static on the table.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Cole began, rubbing his eyes. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go over the fight. Holt, start us off.‚Äù

Holt leaned back in his chair, his boots propped up on a nearby crate. ‚ÄúTanks did their job. The Hunters softened up the Vedettes, and the J. Edgars played the bait-and-switch just like we planned. Lost one hover tank, but the crew made it out.‚Äù He exhaled through his nose. ‚ÄúThat Commando was a nasty surprise, though. Took out one of my boys before we dropped it.‚Äù

Cole nodded. ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôll have to factor in unexpected ‚ÄòMechs more often. Wei?‚Äù

Wei grinned. ‚ÄúThey never saw us coming. Our ATVs ran circles around them. Those grunts barely had time to dismount before we cut them down. Took a few hits, but nothing serious.‚Äù She tapped the table. ‚ÄúIf we had some recoilless rifles or maybe even some light missile launchers on the ATVs, we could‚Äôve done even more damage.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted,‚Äù Cole said, glancing at Grigori. ‚ÄúThink we can work something up?‚Äù

Grigori, arms crossed and expression as gruff as ever, nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see what we can cobble together. Could strip some parts from the APCs we took.‚Äù He thumbed toward the window, where scavenged enemy vehicles were being stripped down. ‚ÄúBigger priority, though, is that Commando.‚Äù

Cole raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the damage?‚Äù

‚ÄúMain structure‚Äôs intact. Left leg‚Äôs shot to hell, gyro‚Äôs busted, but it‚Äôs fixable. If we had a full workshop, I‚Äôd have it walking in a week. Out here? Gonna take some jury-rigging.‚Äù Grigori smirked slightly. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs doable.‚Äù

Cole tapped his fingers on the table. A working ‚ÄòMech, even a light one, would be a big asset. ‚ÄúGet started on it. Even if we don‚Äôt keep it, we can sell it.‚Äù

Bryce, who had been sipping from a flask, leaned forward. ‚ÄúSpeaking of selling‚Äîwhat‚Äôs next? We got paid for this job, right?‚Äù

Cole nodded. ‚ÄúGrendale Mining‚Äôs wiring the funds to our account as we speak. It‚Äôs enough to cover repairs, resupply, and a little extra.‚Äù He looked at Bryce. ‚ÄúYou check in on the job boards?‚Äù

Bryce grinned. ‚ÄúAlways. Got a couple options. One‚Äôs a corporate escort gig‚Äîmoving a VIP from one planet to another. Low risk, decent pay.‚Äù She took another sip. ‚ÄúOther‚Äôs from a planetary governor. Wants mercs to help put down a rebellion.‚Äù

Wei snorted. ‚ÄúRebels, huh? We getting paid to crush workers like the ones we just defended?‚Äù

Bryce shrugged. ‚ÄúPolitics. Someone always wants someone else dead.‚Äù

Cole looked at Holt. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your take?‚Äù

Holt frowned, rubbing his chin. ‚ÄúThe escort job‚Äôs safe money, but it‚Äôs boring. The rebellion job could get messy, but the pay‚Äôs probably better.‚Äù He smirked slightly. ‚ÄúAnd I know you get twitchy when we sit still too long.‚Äù

Cole chuckled. ‚ÄúTrue enough.‚Äù He leaned back, considering.

The Howling Brass had options. They could take the safer contract, keep their people rested, and stack some funds. Or they could take the fight to the rebellion, get their hands dirty, and maybe make a name for themselves.

He looked around the table. ‚ÄúAlright. Let‚Äôs talk pros and cons.‚Äù",3,1739293563.0,battletech,0,1.0,False

For this little album, I recorded a track of just the guitar, then ran that through a moderately-complicated SunVox project that adds drums and some other nonsense according to audio input and some randomized patterns. Did finishing stuff in Reaper and Audacity.

The ""feedback"" sound is a sine wave control tone that works in conjunction with a pair of side chain compressors to trigger drums alongside the guitar. I ended up sending it to the output because I feel like it adds a little juice.

1in3hh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1in3hh6/furinno_jaya_oval_coffee_table_review_affordable/,Furinno Jaya Oval Coffee Table review: Affordable simplicity with style and storage,"I‚Äôve been using the Furinno Jaya Oval Coffee Table, model 15079GYWBKBK, for a couple of months now, and it‚Äôs been an interesting addition to my living room. It‚Äôs a budget-friendly piece of furniture that combines simplicity with functionality, but it does come with its quirks. Let me walk you through my experience.

The design of this table leans toward a modern minimalist aesthetic. The French Oak Grey finish on the top paired with black PVC legs adds a subtle charm to the room. While the materials‚Äîengineered wood and PVC‚Äîdon‚Äôt scream luxury, they hold their own for the price range. The craftsmanship is decent, though the lightweight nature of the table gives away its budget build. I wouldn‚Äôt expect this table to last for decades, but it‚Äôs a good fit for short-term use or for spaces where you don‚Äôt need heavy-duty furniture.

In terms of size, the dimensions (35.4"" W x 19.7"" D x 16.4"" H) make it compact, which is great for small apartments or cozy living rooms. I initially placed it in the middle of my rather spacious living room, but its petite stature seemed a bit out of place. It works much better in a corner or as an auxiliary table next to a couch. If you have a larger area, you might find it visually underwhelming.

The storage options were one of the selling points for me. The built-in shelves are handy for stacking magazines, books, or even board games. There‚Äôs also a non-woven fabric bin included, which is great for stashing loose items like remotes or chargers. However, the weight capacity of 22.7 kilograms means you need to be mindful of what you place on it‚Äîthis is not the table for heavy decor items or stacks of hardcover books.

[Check Furinno Jaya Oval Coffee Table price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/furinno-15079gywbkbk-coffee-table-review-b08fwz541x/)

Maintenance has been straightforward. The surface isn‚Äôt stain-resistant, so I‚Äôve been careful with coffee mugs and snack bowls. A quick wipe with a damp cloth is usually enough to keep it clean. Scratches haven‚Äôt been an issue so far, but I wouldn‚Äôt risk dragging heavy objects across it regularly.

Assembly was an adventure, to say the least. The instructions were clear, but it still took me about 45 minutes to set it up by myself. A hammer and screwdriver are all you need, but you‚Äôll need some patience to ensure everything aligns correctly. Some reviewers mentioned parts breaking during assembly; fortunately, I didn‚Äôt face that issue, but I did notice the materials felt fragile while tightening screws.

**Pros**

* Compact and perfect for small spaces.
* Built-in shelves and a fabric bin offer practical storage.
* Modern, minimalist design that integrates well with most decor.
* Lightweight and easy to move around.
* Affordable price for a functional coffee table.

**Cons**

* Feels flimsy and wobbles slightly if not assembled tightly.
* Not ideal for larger spaces due to its smaller size.
* Surface is not stain- or scratch-resistant.
* Assembly can be tedious, with some risk of parts breaking.
* Limited weight capacity, making it unsuitable for heavy items.

When comparing it to competitors like the IKEA Lack coffee table, Furinno‚Äôs offering comes out ahead in terms of storage versatility. The added shelves and bin make it more practical than the plain, open-space design of IKEA‚Äôs budget tables. However, IKEA‚Äôs tables often feel sturdier and are easier to assemble. On the flip side, Wayfair offers similar compact tables with higher durability, but those are priced significantly higher, so you‚Äôd be paying extra for longevity.

Speaking of value, the Furinno Jaya Oval Coffee Table is priced attractively. It‚Äôs hard to beat for those on a tight budget, especially if you‚Äôre furnishing a dorm room, first apartment, or even a rental property. While it‚Äôs not a premium piece, it offers enough functionality to justify its cost. Just don‚Äôt expect it to hold up to rigorous use or last through multiple moves.

As for features, the table‚Äôs oval shape is a nice touch, breaking away from the more common rectangular designs. The straight-leg structure gives it a clean silhouette, though it‚Äôs not the most stable base. I‚Äôve tested it as a dining surface for occasional meals, and it worked fine, but I wouldn‚Äôt risk leaning too much weight on the edges. The non-woven bin is a thoughtful addition, though its aesthetic doesn‚Äôt quite match the table‚Äôs finish.

This table has become a conversation piece with friends. My coworker, for instance, laughed at how small it looked in my living room initially but admitted it was surprisingly functional after I pointed out the storage. My niece even used the bottom shelf to stack her coloring books during a family visit‚Äîit‚Äôs versatile if nothing else!

1in3ham,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1in3ham/finally_figured_an_eating_plan_that_works_out_for/,Finally Figured An Eating Plan That Works Out For Me!!!,"I am so happy that I found a way to make food work for myself. I have a hard time with my diet, as I am an emotional binge eater with PCOS and ADHD. After months of trial and error I have not only lost 20 LBS so far but am under 300LBS which I thought would never happen.

So far every morning I will wake up drink a glass of water then have for breakfast:

\-1Packet of Oatmeal (it's already portioned out for me and makes it simple to make)  with Chia Seeds, a sprinkle of brown sugar(sugar replacement kind), and a handful of frozen blueberries

\-If on the go I will make a blueberry smoothie with frozen blueberries, spinach, protein powder, banana and a little bit of water in it. I try to use a collagen peptide protein powder

For Lunch:

Before eating I will drink 1 glass of water before my meal

I buy these Taylor Farms prepackaged salads they are cheap and come with everything in the bag except the protein, I will put a packet of the canned chicken in it and sprinkle everything bagel seasoning on it.

Then I will have a fruit like grapes or cuties.

Dinner:

Once again drink a glass of water

I give myself three options for protein and the same veggies that I like

Protein Options:

\-Pulled Pork, made in Crockpot saves me so much time and effort also lasts me days. I use Ilmee Mintz pulled pork recipe (she's great)

\-I will make the veggies in a pot but buy a rotisserie chicken. It for low low effort days or I will make a whole chicken in the oven with the veggies underneath.

\-I will just make a beef stew with the veggies in the crockpot.

I will make a mixture of veggies that rotate between these options like brussel sprouts (trader joes has this tiny frozen brussels. Not only are they cute but they are a life saver), tiny carrots, tiny potatoes (saves time on cutting), or frozen broccoli.

Or if my partner got frozen dumplings from Chinatown we will make a broth with just water and miso with green onions sometimes spinach and then have dumpling soup.

I try to put a lil sauerkraut on the side for gut health.

For Snacks I give myself like two options but sometimes I will crack and buy a cheap treat from the bodega.

I love having a couple of squares of dark chocolate (I LOVE the orange peel dark chocolate from Chocolove if I can't find it or it's too pricey I buy dark chocolate Kit Kats)  with slice of white cheddar cheese (I buy the block of it)

or I make an Orange Loaf cake that I will use protein dense yogurt and sugar replacement with. I will sometimes mess around with the recipe and use Lemon instead or oranges, add protein dark chocolate chips if they are on sale or add blueberries. It's fun to switch up.

Sometimes I will be tired of having water so I will buy a Kombucha. Trying to incorporate Mint Tea but I am indifferent on it. I will also drink a cup of coffee every morning. I prefer this coffee with mushroom in it, it's supposed to help with brain fog. 

It's bad but I do use the coldfoam from the can...I gotta confess...

I just wanted to share because it's possible y'all! I have been having fun and not so much fun figuring it out but boy once I did it's made grocery shopping and living easier.

Hope this is helpful to someone and I will be willing to share my loaf recipe if anyone wants it!",10,1739293513.0,PCOS,4,1.0,False

A few weeks pass and she texts me making small talk about seeing me in public or whatever. We text for a little and I decide to ask her out on the spot for coffee again. She says she couldn‚Äôt right that second because she just left school (and she leaves on weekends, cuz she lives close by, while I live in campus) but then she says ‚Äúwe definitely can next week if you're up for it!‚Äù And she also offered to send me her schedule.

My job is so stressful.  The job I accepted is not the job I'm doing, but it pays well, and I'm a millennial hoping to one day buy a house and hopefully raise my possible future children in a stable financial environment, unlike the one I grew up in.

My husband is lovely and amazing, but sometimes I still feel like he expects me to drop what I'm doing if he needs something.  It's so annoying, if I'm being honest.  He made a personal commitment that he wanted to make out with me more (I feel like we're really physical), so I asked if there was a problem or he felt like we weren't being physical enough.  He said he didn't feel that way, but since we've been married a year now he wants to make sure we don't just become like roommates.  I'm a divorcee, and honestly that scared the SHIT out of me.  Like fuck, have I not been paying attention? Have I not seen the signs?  Is THIS marriage about to fall apart too?  

He says none of that is true and he just loves me and wants to kiss me more...but all I hear is an extra  thing on my plate I need to be aware of.  Make sure he's getting enough kisses. Make sure work is getting enough output.  Make sure the dog is getting enough exercise.  

This morning I was putting laundry in with a cup of coffee in my hand that was hot, and he tried to kiss me so I gave him a peck and he said ""can you kiss me properly please?""  I wanted to throw my coffee at him.  All I heard in that moment was what I was doing wasn't good enough.

We talked about it a bit, and he apologized and said he should've realized, but now I feel guilty because it feels like it's ALWAYS me.  It's always me brining up issues or my feelings and it's always revolving around how I feel.  He really is great, and my first marriage was so horrible and abusive I feel like I don't have the right to bitch about this one.  Like you have a husband who wants to make out with you, and there was a time in my life I was begging for affection from others.  So I feel ungrateful or like there is something wrong with me that I'm just not ALWAYS in the mood to make out.  

I just want to run away, not have everything on my shoulders.  I'm so spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and physically drained. ",63,1739293119.0,WitchesVsPatriarchy,24,0.97,False

1in3724,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoeRogan/comments/1in3724/a_long_time_ago_in_a_galaxy_far_far_away/,"A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away....","Specifically in the year 2014 (back when people still took ‚Äúwearable tech‚Äù far too seriously), a beleaguered government initiative known as the Department of Digital Government Enterprise, or DODGE, wobbled onto the scene. It was meant to be the digital savior of public services, flung together in a frenzy of subcommittee meetings, half-read memos, and strongly worded coffee orders. However, DODGE quickly discovered that launching an innovative government project with zero actual direction was only slightly easier than teaching quantum physics to a hamster. In short, it floundered.

Between 2014 and 2024, DODGE tried‚Äîand mostly failed‚Äîto manage all manner of federal digital chaos. Meetings were held, budgets were blown, and countless ‚ÄúLessons Learned‚Äù documents were typed up and subsequently ignored.

Then came the year 2024, and with it arrived a figure so mysterious and visionary that no one dared question his single-name moniker: MLon. While most people assumed he was some eccentric tech guru who had accidentally wandered into a congressional hearing and started scribbling flowcharts on the nearest whiteboard, MLon quickly seized the reins of DODGE, determined to transform the once-faltering agency into the crown jewel of government oversight.

To accomplish this, MLon handpicked a crack team of specialists who seemed, at first glance, like they‚Äôd walked off the set of the strangest reality show never aired:

Satan the Lawyer: An ironically named legal mastermind who could quote entire volumes of U.S. Code between sips of overpriced matcha lattes. Reputedly unstoppable in any legal standoff, Satan‚Äôs greatest strength was conjuring obscure statutes that left even the most stoic senator reaching for smelling salts.
Rhea the Researcher: Endlessly surrounded by swirling orbs of data, Rhea possessed the uncanny ability to cross-reference annual budgets with obscure shipping manifests from three decades prior‚Äîall while reciting Greek mythology for fun.
Nutsack the Techie: Cheerfully oblivious to social nuance, Nutsack believed the solution to any cosmic problem (federal or otherwise) lay in either toggling a device‚Äôs power switch or installing a comically long list of security patches. If the latter failed, he‚Äôd usually blame quantum fluctuations.
Karen the HR Whiz: A pleasant but ever-so-slightly terrifying presence in every federal office. Karen had a knack for coaxing out confessions‚Äîfinancial or otherwise‚Äîmerely by inquiring about everyone‚Äôs ‚Äújob satisfaction‚Äù in her quietly insistent tone. People spilled their secrets just to escape her unstoppable follow-up questions.
Together, under MLon‚Äôs eccentric but determined leadership, this newly revitalized DODGE struck fear and awe into every government department it touched. Gone were the days of misplacing important emails (or entire budgets) in the black hole of bureaucratic confusion. Suddenly, DODGE had the authority to rummage through every server, open every dusty filing cabinet, and prod suspicious line items with a metaphoric magnifying glass.

At first, certain politicians tried to quash the rising influence of DODGE with scathing editorials and ominous calls for defunding. But Satan the Lawyer, with a twitch of an eyebrow and a mild clearing of the throat, produced reams of arcane legal cross-references protecting DODGE‚Äôs mission‚Äîitems so terrifyingly thorough that even the most hardened cynics decided that maybe oversight wasn‚Äôt such a bad thing after all.

By mid-2025, DODGE had done what no one believed possible: it reconciled once-disastrously mismanaged programs, exposed a few cringe-worthy shady deals, and heroically saved the national budget from spending patterns that rivaled a confused teenager‚Äôs credit card spree. Perhaps most impressively, it restored a modicum of public confidence in the possibility that a government IT project could be something other than a cosmic punchline.

In the end, the reborn DODGE sailed forth into the future of governance, guided by MLon‚Äôs unorthodox brilliance and staffed by a team whose skill sets ranged from borderline demonic legal wizardry to unstoppable HR courtesy calls. And so it was that a once-failing initiative from 2014 turned into a story of near-miraculous redemption‚Äîunless, of course, you were one of the clueless co-conspirators discovered by Karen over a fateful ‚Äúemployee satisfaction‚Äù coffee chat. But that‚Äôs another tale for another time, presumably one with even more acronyms and better pastries.",0,1739292834.0,JoeRogan,5,0.33,False

So I'm kinda freaking out rn cuz this is my first date ever and we scheduled it on Valentine's day.

(Note that we've been getting along very well online and haven't met in person yet). 

I also saw some threads mentioning just bringing a single flower. This sounds a lot more convenient since it's a coffee date and we'll be walking around the city after. But I'm worried it'll seem kinda like an empty gesture just being one small flower. 

I like the thought of bouquets but I don't want her to have to uncomfortably carry it around wherever we go. 

We haven't really touched on the subject of flowers so I don't even know if she likes em or not and which specific ones she does like. Should I say fuck it and ask her outright? Or maybe even take her to go get her favorite flowers so she can pick them out?

Also, where do I get flowers? A florist or grocery store?

For as validating as the predator‚Äôs lecture on their species‚Äôs most horrific conflict (so far) was. The subject matter of their animated propaganda had been terribly underwhelming and in the case of the German one, infuriating.

WIth our lecture pivoting back to the United States we would at the very least see an improvement in production values. Maybe we‚Äôd even see some wings animated correctly if we‚Äôre lucky.

My attention returned to the projector as a new slide featuring a poster, or was it a cover, titled [CAPTAIN AMERICA](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615TbWmdenL._UF1000,1000_QL80_.jpg). This was more like what I had in mind, but not quite. Sure the blue, white, and red-clad predator was attacking Hitler, but it only used a closed claw and what looked like a small shield, barely deflecting bullets off of it.¬†

‚ÄúAgain, while the United States didn‚Äôt get into WWII until Pearl Harbor there were those who opposed Hitler‚Äôs expansionist war across Europe. Two Jewish American comic artists, Joe Simon, and Jack Kirby, took particular issue with him given their heritage. They created it as a political rallying cry, and it was well received‚Ä¶‚Äù The predator held up a single claw. ‚Äú... for the most part.‚Äù It coyly remarked, turning expectantly to the class. ‚ÄúCan anyone guess what they were called?‚Äù

The Harchen raised his claw. ‚ÄúWas it called United States First?‚Äù He joked.

‚ÄúClose, but not quite.‚Äù The Predator replied.‚ÄùThe movement went by the name America First. It was a wide coalition of those who didn‚Äôt want the U.S. in another war either out of apathy or sympathy to the Nazis.‚Äù He said with the same pointed venom from earlier in the lecture. ‚ÄúFortunately there were those who would mock such sentiments. Few more famous than Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as Dr.Seuss!‚Äù

The Predator swung his pointed claw towards the screen, revealing a [new image](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_35FdfU6stMfSIeGeXetrbUk8dE=/media/img/posts/2017/01/seuss/original.jpg). It featured a female predator labeled ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô reading a book titled Adolf the Wolf to her fledglings. She said ‚Äò ‚Ä¶And the wolf chewed up the children and spit out their bones‚Ä¶ but those were foreign children and it really didn‚Äôt matter.‚Äô I presumed a wolf was yet another horrific predatory creature from Earth given how it was drawn in the book.

‚ÄúThough it may not seem like much to you all here, but most are surprised when they see the author and illustrator of several classic children‚Äôs picture books doing WWII political cartoons. Crazier still when he got drafted and served in the signal corps with Comic author and Illustrator Stan Lee!‚Äù Its voice reached a fever pitch. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt begin to emphasize how famous these two were! Though I bet you‚Äôre wondering: Professor Caiazzo, what does any of that have to do with animation?‚Äù He asked rhetorically. ‚ÄúTurns out he wound up writing for the Private Snafu Instructional shorts they‚Äôd send to the military. Which we won‚Äôt be seeing because the Dean found them too raunchy, and we really only have time for one more section before I take your questions.‚Äù

Thank Inatala we were spared from that prospect. The slide changed to a new one titled ‚ÄúTroubles in the House of Mouse.‚Äù Accompanied with an illustration of DIsney‚Äôs ‚Äòmascot‚Äô¬† [Mickey Mouse holding a sign](https://i.insider.com/5085a190ecad047b7a000003?width=800&format=jpeg&auto=webp) reading ‚ÄúDisney Unfair.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow who remembers the last couple of films Disney put out?‚Äù

The Zurulian raised his paw first. ‚ÄúPinocchio and Fantasia.‚Äù He confidently answered.

‚ÄúYes, and neither performed very well on account of the War. Especially Fantasia which also flopped domestically. To recuperate they would work on a cheaper and safer film called Dumbo, but not all was well among the staff. Aside from the mass layoffs the studio suffered, there were huge inconsistent pay disparities between workers.‚Äù Another [picture ](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI1MDA0OTEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQwMTMxOTE@._V1_.jpg)came up, this time one of the animators at its desk.

‚ÄúTo quote one animator, Willis Pyle: ‚ÄòThere was no rhyme or reason as to the way the guys were paid. You might be sitting next to a guy doing the same thing as you and you might be getting $20 a week more or less than him.‚Äô Keep in mind, that was a lot of money back then. On top of that, the studio forced them to not report overtime, and in quite a few cases artists were not being credited.‚Äú

Karsai‚Äôs claw went up. ‚ÄúHow were conditions that bad? Didn‚Äôt they have any guilds yet? For that matter, do humans have guilds at all?‚Äù He asked incredulously.

The predator bobbed its head, growling a faint chuckle. ‚ÄúWe do have labor unions. Part of the problem was that every major studio except Disney was part of the Screen Cartoonist‚Äôs Guild, now simply called the Animation Guild.‚Äù Yet another [portrait](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/5/5a/Art_babbit.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070215173920) came up on the screen. ‚ÄúTechnically Disney did have a company union, but much to the dismay of its head Art Babbit, it had no leverage. Things came to a head when Babbit and the Guild‚Äôs president, Herbert Sorrel approached Walt to properly unionize the studio. Walt not only refused, but he gathered up all 1,200 employees into an audience, and gave this speech:‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the 20 years I've spent in this business I've weathered many storms. It's been far from easy sailing. It required a great deal of work, struggle, determination, competence, faith, and above all unselfishness. Some people think we have a class distinction in the place. They wonder why some people get better seats in the theatre than others. They wonder why some men get spaces in the parking lot and others don't. I have always felt, and always will feel that the men that contribute most to the organization should, out of respect alone, enjoy some privileges. My first recommendation to the lot of you is this; put your own house in order, you can't accomplish a damn thing by sitting around and waiting to be told everything. If you're not progressing as you should, instead of grumbling and growling, do something about it.‚Äù

In essence, he told them to work even harder and hope that maybe they‚Äôd get better treatment. In practice, it probably resembled how some of the less reputable exterminators' offices promoted out-of-office politics and favoritism rather than actual job performance. Social predators indeed.

‚ÄúSo long story short. Over 200 employees went on strike for (a herd and seven paws) with the support of union members from other studios. It ended when the National Labor Relations Board stepped in and asked Disney to sign the contract. After the fiasco was settled the studio was left with just under seven hundred employees. The rest left for other studios or started their own, some were even blacklisted by Disney himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúHold on!‚Äù Karsai interjected. ‚ÄúYou had unions, but no retaliation laws?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey probably weren‚Äôt implemented in California at the time. Honestly, worker and union protections were kind of an on-and-off thing until the mid-21st century, and do not get me started on that mess!‚Äù¬†

The Predator hastily changed the slide to a poster of our final screening. ‚Äú[Der Fuehrer‚Äôs Face](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6d/Der_Fuehrer%27s_Face_poster.jpg).‚Äù

‚ÄúAs luck would have it, the navy practically moved into Walt Disney Studios during WWII and the studio, along with a few others, was commissioned to produce propaganda for the war effort. Of all of them, Der Fuehrer‚Äôs Face was the most well-received short, even winning the Academy Award for best animated short.‚Äù He raised a single claw again. ‚ÄúBut before we begin I should warn you‚Ä¶‚Äù

*Of course, what will it be this time?*¬†

‚ÄúThis is a Donald Duck short.‚Äù Its head snapped towards me. ‚ÄúVekla, I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going to see this on top of Armer Hansi. Hopefully, the voice isn‚Äôt too harsh on your translators.‚Äù

Wonderful, more mockeries of the avian form. I could already feel my feathers start to ruffle as the [video began to play](https://youtu.be/I7vb89c6pQY). My suspicions were confirmed by the utterly bizarre creature‚Äôs head displayed before the short started. Its beak looked like a mazic sat on it!

The film proper started with a marching tune, played by what I assumed were Nazi soldiers given the angular spiral symbols decorating their false pelts. The leading member of the troops sang out:

‚ÄúWhen Der F√ºhrer says, ""We ist der master race.""

We Heil! Heil! Right in Der Fuehrer's face.

Not to love Der Fuehrer is a great disgrace.

So we Heil! Heil! Right in Der Fuehrer's face!‚Äù

The camera cut out to the group marching along a road, the background filled with more of their signature spirals. Even the clouds were shaped like them!

‚ÄúWhen Herr Goebbels says, ‚ÄòWe own der world und space.‚Äô

We Heil! Heil! Right in Herr Goebbels' face.

When Herr Goring says they'll never bomb this place.

We Heil! Heil! Right in Herr Goring's face.‚Äù

The lanky one in front turned around towards the others.

‚ÄúIst we not the supermen?‚Äù‚ÄúAryan pure supermen!‚Äù Said the pallid one with spectacles and buck teeth.

The others barked in after another.

‚ÄúJa we ist der supermen.

Super-duper supermen!‚Äù

‚ÄúIst this Nutzi land so good? Would you leave it if you could?‚Äù The slender one asked into the oversized hornlike instrument.

‚ÄúJa this Nutzi land is good!‚Äù Shouted the others, their heads popping out of the instrument.

Then suddenly Mussolini popped out from behind one of the percussion instruments to complete the stanza. ‚ÄúVee wouldn't leave it if we could.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe bring the world to order!‚Äù The fat one with the small pipe instrument cut in.

‚ÄúHeil Hitler's world New Order!‚Äù Shouted the bespectacled one, waving what I guessed was the Japanese flag. Since he seemed the odd one out.

‚ÄúEveryone of foreign race will love Der Fuehrer's face

When we bring to der world disorder.‚Äù Sang the group.

The camera panned and then pushed into the house of the ‚ÄòDuck‚Äô creature. Still asleep despite the loud band. Two different alarm clocks tried to wake it but were both met with violence. In a final bid to muffle the band, it shut the curtain. Only for a gun-mounted blade to slice it open and poke it in the tail feathers. The creature, now awoken, saluted portraits of the three ‚ÄúAxis‚Äù leaders.‚ÄúHaaail Heiiithlah! Haaail Hewoheetoh! Haaail Musholeenee!‚Äù The harsh barks of the human tongue were bad enough, but hearing the barely comprehensible squawks coming from its misshapen beak were nigh torture. My translator could barely make out what it was saying.

It then proceeded to have the most meager first meal imaginable by dunking a ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù seed into a cup of water, spraying ‚ÄúAroma of Bacon and Eggs‚Äù (Of course the damn thing was a cannibal) in its mouth, and finally rounded things out with an oddly shaped sawed off chunk of wood.

Then suddenly a book titled {My Struggle} was shoved in his face before the band came in to escort him to the galaxy‚Äôs smoggiest factory. The ‚ÄúDuck‚Äù walked into the factory in its uniform with the bladed guns at its back. The Song Continued.

‚ÄúWhen Der Fuehrer says, ""We never will be slaves!""

We Heil! Heil! but still, we work like slaves!

While der Fuehrer brags, and lies and rants and raves,

We Heil! Heil! And work into our graves!‚Äù

They placed the white avian behind a conveyor belt where it assembled an endless array of artillery shells while also having to say Heil Hitler‚ÄúWhen der Fuehrer yells, 'I gotta have more shells!'

We Heil! Heil! For him we make more shells!

If one little shell should blow him right to-‚Äù The last word was cut off by a massive shell bumping into the duck.

He continued working. The announcer constantly worked him to the point of breaking. Then he could take no more. The camera pitched and spiraled. An absurd bevy of mixed visuals passed across the screen faster than I could keep track of until it reached a fever pitch. Then suddenly two immense shells crowding the duck exploded, sending a hundred copies of it falling into the void. Then it woke up, realizing it was in the United States it immediately went up to a statue. It looked familiar to one of the videos I saw of Earth.

‚ÄúOkay, that was our last screening for the day.‚Äù Said the predator. ‚ÄúWe do have a little bit of time for questions today. So if you have any questions about animation during WWII, now is the time!‚Äù

Is the Comandante C40 Overkill?,"I‚Äôm in the market for a good travel hand grinder and could use some advice. I already own a¬†Fellow Ode 2¬†for my daily pour-over setup, and I‚Äôm very happy with the coffee it produces. However, I‚Äôm planning some extended travel and shorter camping trips this year and need a portable grinder that can deliver similar (or better) grind quality for pour-over.

I‚Äôve been eyeing the¬†Comandante C40 and a Kinu M47¬†because, but I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs overkill for my needs. I‚Äôd ideally like something:

* Compact and portable for travel and camping.
* Capable of producing grind quality on par with (or better than) the Fellow Ode 2.
* Durable enough to handle occasional outdoor use.

Budget-wise, I‚Äôm flexible but don‚Äôt want to overspend for marginal gains. I‚Äôve also considered more budget-friendly options like the¬†1Zpresso Q2¬†or¬†Timemore Chestnut X, but I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôll match the Ode 2‚Äôs performance.

For those who‚Äôve used both the Comandante C40 and the Fellow Ode 2 (or similar grinders):

1. Is the C40 worth the investment for travel, or would it be overkill since I‚Äôm already happy with the Ode 2?
2. Are there other hand grinders in the¬†100‚Äì300 range that can compete with the Ode 2 for pour-over?
3. Any recommendations for a durable, travel-friendly grinder that won‚Äôt break the bank?",2,1739292735.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

My opinion on Lingo count after one week is that it‚Äôs somewhat BS. Have found it unreliable and unreasonable but I‚Äôm hoping maybe a few more weeks of calibration might render it useful?

I 24F have been struggling with 5-7 UTIs for 7 years now. Both of my half-sisters also have rUTIs with no diagnosis but our shared mom never had this issue. I got my UTIs without any sexual activity and I maintain a lot of recommended steps to avoid them listed below. Antibiotics and Azo always solved them but it wasn‚Äôt always the same bacteria. My urologist suspected bladder endometriosis and prescribed longterm Macrobid to take as wanted and I haven‚Äôt had one in almost a full year. But my gynecologist didn‚Äôt find any obvious endometriosis lesions.

Current:
Dec 14th I woke up with the usual UTI pain, cloudy urine, and that bacteria smell. Went to the urgent care and they said I had blood and cloudiness in my urine and I got Bactrim but it didn‚Äôt work. I went back and got Cephalexin and it didn‚Äôt work. Went a third time and the doctor told me I have absolutely no infection. Looking at previous results, I never tested positive for an infection since my Dec 14th visit. I saw my urologist Jan 23rd and he confirmed I have no infection and prescribed me Oxybutynin for overactive bladder and Pyridium to help with the pain. I scheduled the earliest cystoscopy but it is in another month and a half and I just can‚Äôt do this anymore. Its been two months of permanent UTI pain now. The Pyridium and Azo do not help the pain even a little bit. I have been on Oxybutynin (Ditropan) for 3 weeks and I feel like I‚Äôm getting worse. I overdose on cranberry extract and D-Mannose every day and still pain.

Everyday I get cramps and burning. 4-5 days of the week it impacts my ability to live because I feel stuck to the toilet or laying in bed. Yesterday, I tried going to the ER because the pain was intolerable at a 7 or 8. It took me 3 hours to even get up and out the door. They ran blood work and urine culture. Perfect bloodwork, no infection, no STDs, so they just refilled my Pyridium and Oxybutynin even though I told her that both drugs weren‚Äôt helping at all. Im just so sad and tired that no one will help me.

The pain is both internal and external. It burns where it exits and sometimes feels like salt in an open wound or burns so much it feels cold. Inside the tract it often feels sharp like open cuts or like two rug burns rubbing against each other. I get cramps all the time and it‚Äôs very tender by my bladder but I haven‚Äôt ever had kidney pain. I always feel like I need to pee badly but only small amounts dribble out. I have never had any incontinence and I have pretty strong pelvic floor muscles. I have a lot of fatigue and barely get through the day with less than 10 hours of sleep. I often sleep 12 or more. No chance of pregnancy or STIs. No unusual discharge. An ultrasound showed kidneys and bladder look normal size and functioning properly. Peeing doesn‚Äôt help it feel better.

Full list of things I always do/tried:
 Wipe front to back,
 Pee after sex,
 Drink lots of water,
 Drink cranberry juice no sugar,
 Have swapped my IUD,
 Pelvic floor strengthening,
 Urinate frequently unless infected,
 Hygiene,
 Loose and soft underwear - changed twice a day,
 Only showers, no baths,
 D-Mannose,
 Cranberry extract,
 100% Alcohol-free,
 No coffee but some tea


TLDR;
Used to get frequent UTIs. Now I have UTI symptoms every day with no bacteria, STI, or any other obvious cause. Next urology appointment is months away and Azo and Pyridium don‚Äôt help the pain.

The fading memories of us

It wasn‚Äôt raining the last time. There are a lot of things different, but the rain really makes it feel different. That and that we‚Äôre no longer by each other‚Äôs sides. To be honest, I secretly thought (hoped probably even? I‚Äôm not sure) that we‚Äôd cross paths again and for one brief moment I could remember what it‚Äôs like to just exist in the glow that is you. Just to see your eyes and feel that rush of emotion that reminds us both of how alive we made each other feel. I still feel that sometimes when you pop into my mind because some obscure memory of us, it‚Äôs just so fleeting and sad knowing I can‚Äôt share that remembering with anyone in the world, not even you.

But now we‚Äôre at the end. Not the part where the decision was made, or the part where we talked about it. Not the part with all the tears or the bargaining or the hope. Those all ran out a while ago. No, we‚Äôre at the end of the end, like the last ripples from a rock tossed in a still lake, fading away, becoming almost smaller and imperceptible. But of course, not gone entirely. We used to talk about how we‚Äôd always remember ‚Äòus stuff‚Äô, those parts that were just for each other, some songs or jokes, the way you smiled, that look on your face, that cute video you took with the old person filter where you bobbed your head and smiled in a way that convinced me you were the cutest person in the world. My heart melted whenever I saw that.

We had so much of us preserved and saved in the ether of the internet. Recipes, music and movie recs, poetry, pictures, thoughts, memories‚Ä¶ So much of what we shared only lived in that space. Mostly out of necessity, because it couldn‚Äôt live anywhere else. We had that, we had our phone calls, a few intense and passionate trysts, and then the memories. Now all that remains are those memories, but they‚Äôre fading. When I think about it now, I wish I would have printed a picture of you and used it to replace the staged photo that comes in a new frame. Then you could stay there posing as the model, and only I would know that there was one the greatest loves of my life.

And so, it was in this state I find myself. Back in LA for the first time since we last met there, roaming the streets letting the memories of you wash over me. The bookstore where we first me still smells the same. That old scent of older books will forever be associated with you. I wandered the aisles remembering where we exchanged glances as if 5 years ago was just yesterday. Around every corner I hoped to find you. Would you be drawn back to the same places; do you still feel the pull of us? All if found though was a short George Saunders book that I had never seen before. You opened my eyes to his prose and now the world just feels a little different. Is that because of you, us, or his way with words, I‚Äôm not sure. I figured you‚Äôd be in town for the big meeting, so I went back to Grand Central Market and laughed at ‚Äúpupusas‚Äù again. I walked to the park where we sat and chatted. I could almost feel the gentle touches that neither of us actually believed were accidental.

I even took a picture of the coffee shop window that briefly held our secret reflections, just like the picture we took that first day together. One of the only pictures we ever took of us together. What a funny thing an affair is. It‚Äôs so very much alive but so adamantly relegated to the shadows, forced to hide there. But our love burned bright enough to generate its own little light. And in that space, it was perfect, at least until it wasn‚Äôt. It was so vibrant and full of life and then we lost it. Maybe we didn‚Äôt need it as much as we once did. Maybe the struggle that was living through a pandemic with little ones had finally subsided and in the return to normalcy we ran out of time to keep that fragile spark alive. I hope you know it wasn‚Äôt you, I never stopped loving you and I‚Äôm probably still in love with you.

I had to look up your profile pic on linkedin, one of maybe 3 places where we have public pics of ourselves. And that when I saw it. You weren‚Äôt with the company anymore. Adding insult to injury, I looked up the company and saw they weren‚Äôt at the meeting this year. And like that, my hopes of bumping into you again dissolved. I stood there alone on the sidewalk as the drizzle turned to rain and the residual ripples of us became even harder to see.",4,1739292289.0,adultery,0,0.75,False

1in2y0u,https://i.redd.it/zkw58a2qgjie1.jpeg,Not Tim's last day on his contract.,"Not the last day. 

This lore post highlights the mental toll 3 years in isolation In the artic and it‚Äôs Tim‚Äôs last day of his 3 year contract or is it? or is it Pls read any other lore about him in profile before you read this, Thank you.


 It started like any other the last 3 years of Tim‚Äôs contract, with the typical snow chicken screaming at his window at 3 am Tim responded like any other day with a

 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 3 in the morning you dumbnut‚Äù 

Tim would get ready like anyday putting on his red pullover and red workwear pants with his artic work boots. He would glance at his protective vest that he normally wore due to the dangerous wildlife. The vest had obvious claw marks from an ice bear and Wolfe on it and dried blood stains, the letters ‚ÄúRescue‚Äù which were on the vest were almost not readable. This Vest has saved his life not once but multiply times, he would talk to a vest like a person ‚ÄúJust one day left buddy‚Äù 

After getting ready he would go down into the kitchen to make his typical sandwich and coffee, he took an seat on the counter and glanced up to look at the barricaded window which was broke in a wolf attack and chuckled ‚ÄúMore happened in three years on this island then I thought would come‚Äù 

After finishing his breakfast he would go to the first floor of his lighthouse, putting on his protective vest and grab his AA-12, inspecting the automatic shotgun, he would remove the drum magazine and inspect it ‚ÄúA shame I was forced to fire this beauty 5 times‚Äù there were still other 15 shells of 12 gauge buckshot left in the drum mag but for safety reason he decided to load another 5 and 1 more in the barrel

Suddenly he caught a glimpse in the corner of his eye of an tall dark figure in a Trenchcoat standing in the kitchen, he would load the mag and aim the AA-12 at what he thought he saw, he shouted ‚ÄúWHO TF ARE YOU‚Äù he would rush to approach the man with his gun aimed at it, as soon as he got in a 2 feet radius of the man, it just disappered. He lowered his gun and just said out of confusion ‚ÄúThis is my last day on this hell hole anyway‚Äù 

He decided to ignore the situation and went on with his daily plan of turning the generator off and going outside to remove the snow from the solar panels, he brought his gun this time to not make the same mistake like last time. He was still paranoid about wolfs and constantly looked at the nearby tree line for them but he didn‚Äôt see any which he was relief about but he didn‚Äôt let his paranoia down, after finishing the cleaning he would catch a glimpse of an tall dark figure‚Ä¶ He looked up and saw it was the same figure next a tree in the tree line he didn‚Äôt even say anything but he thought ‚ÄúWho TF is this2 and without hesitation he would aim his gun and fire a pot shot at them but the figure just waved, he kinda just ignored and carried on with his day. (Do people read these completely? Comment with a duck emoji if you did) 

Well it was now 12 and Tim was just outside on the dock just looking around, suddenly his moment of piece got interrupted with the sound of a loud horn from a ship, He would get startled at the loud sound and look into the fog infant of him. The red and white Bow of an giant Icebreaker would pierce through the fog, it was almost frighting but he knew it was coast guard but he didn‚Äôt expect a full blown icebreaker to pick him up, that thing could not even dock at the island as it was like double in length, he watched in awe as the icebreaker drove through the ice likes it‚Äôs nothing and just stopped next to the island, on the side of the hull would a giant bridge fall down connecting the island, out come three people who looked like coast guard officials and not the typical coast guard servicemen behind them followed two MP‚Äôs but they just looked aroun and the first officer approached him ‚ÄúHello son, we sadly need to inform you that your contract has been extended due to some small border conflict but no worries, your island will get upgraded2 

Tim would look at the man with a wide stare before he just said ‚ÄúYOU ARE WHAT? I AM STAYING ?! ON WHOS CHOICE AND WTF ARE YOU GONE UPGRADE MY ISLAND WITH? HUH?‚Ä¶..‚Äù Tim would contiue to shout at the officer till one of the MPs kinda just nudged him back 

The Officers would ignore the shoutout and wait for time to calm down and then proceeded. ‚ÄúYour pay will be increased by the 3 time it is now and the food will probably get better.‚Äù 
The officers would just leave him standing there in awe as they went back into the ship, two house container were placed here and there to house stuff, suddenly they started to mount an big naval ship artillery onto his island, it was like one of those rotating battle gun on a battleship but it had only one cabin and loading was almost completely automatic, he only would need to aim it from a terminal and tip on a map to fire it at a location, he was baffled with the firepower he received‚Ä¶. It was a very confusing for Tim and he went around to ask all kinds of workers but they ignored him mostly, till a rookie let it slip that they were ordered not to interact with him. 

Tim would just give up trying to find more out and just went to the shoreline of the ocean, he just sat on one of rooks and steared at the ocean for a couple minutes, till a man sat next to him, Tim didn‚Äôt look the man in face he only saw that he was wearing blue formal coast guard uniform and then a deep but strong voice asked him : ‚ÄúWell good luck on the next three years‚Ä¶ keep your mental health in check‚Äù
Tim answered 2I have gone too fare to return back into society‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt function there, this is all I know‚Äù Tim would let his gaze drift from the man shoes to his shoulder and when he raised his head to look the man in the face, there was no head.. He would reach out to touch the mans torso but his hand just went straight though them‚Ä¶ Tim panicked ‚ÄúWTF IS HAPPING‚Äù 

He rushed to get off the chair and distance himself and watched as the headless figure waved and just disappeared.  Tim just went with it to ignore this and continued to watch as the contribution went on for the next three days‚Ä¶ The human company was enjoyable for Tim but it didn‚Äôt last long as they abruptly left in the night only leaving a letter attached to his front door. The next morning Tim rushed down his lighthouse to check on the construction and he saw that they were done, it was just empty. The ship gone, no worker, just a letter at his door. He ripped the letter from the door to read it 

‚ÄúDear Tim. Unfortunately me and the rest of the crew were forced to leave early due to an snow storm approaching your little island. We finished the constrution of the naval artillery gun and a couple container house to keep the shells and supply, we installed another container house to house any coast guard or guest if needed, that container willl be the home of an PB-PCM to help protect this site as it is now an official military base and coast guard defence and SAR station with a lighthouse, the site‚Äôs name will be ‚ÄúThe artic guard S12. The PB-PCM will arrive in 4 weeks. How to operate the naval gun, there are clear instruction in a book in the controller container house. We willl also teach you from a video conference and thx for staying the other 3 months, pay will be double as normal and if you choose to stay any longer, just tell the supply officer in a coupe weeks, the pay would increase again OFC.  Dear regards Logist officer Kennedy James‚Äù 

Tim would drop his arms to his side and stare at the finished site, it was an awe sigh, ‚ÄúYet I am still alone but not for long2 

There are still many adventures to come for this guy  ",8,1739292211.0,RobloxAvatars,4,1.0,False

I would love to know if there are:
- nice food/coffee places
- specialty stores worth checking
- fun activities or even hike spots (when the weather allows it)

... that you would recommend and/or personally have been to. 

Little background about me: in my 30's, a massive foodie and quite a decent amateur home cook, love museums, love being in nature. 

Thanks in advance! :)

1in2vzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Asthma/comments/1in2vzb/how_much_pain_is_normal_at_work/,How much pain is normal at work?,"Last year I was diagnosed with asthma and have been job hopping since then. My asthma is not controlled very well. I end up using my inhaler and ibuprofen every day sometimes multiple times and I experience chest pain, back pain, nausea, and dizziness that gets worse with activity and standing.

I typically tap out when I start wheezing and my voice starts to slur, but this has made it hard to hold a job. The only jobs I'm trained for is outdoor, physical labor jobs.

For context, I'm on a twice daily 500mg Wixela treatment with monolucast at night, Claritin D and Flonase in the morning, and an anti acid twice a day. I am also overweight and am trying to work on it. To be fair however, for my entire work life (about 10 years) I have been working physical labor jobs.

On days I work I take one or more doses of my emergency inhaler, 600 mg of ibuprofen, and two to three large cups of coffee to keep me awake and moving without choking. I'm not currently on this cocktail because I lost my job, again, and symptoms are minimized with minimal movement.

And just to be preemptive, I'm in the USA without healthcare or a job at current time. I don't have access to a doctor.

Is this normal? Is there anything more I can do to control the symptoms? Am I just being a pussy?

Sorry it's a bit jumbled and thank you for reading.

1in2shq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1in2shq,Late to the Party - Christmas 2024 Cocktail Menu,"Little bit of background: every year my family does a Christmas Eve dinner with a different theme/ethnicity of cooking, done as authentically as possible. In the past we have done Ethiopian, Indian, Mexican, Spanish tapas, Japanese, and more. This year‚Äôs theme was Italian. My wife and I took up the mantle of bar duty a few years ago to avoid food prep  and suffice to say, it‚Äôs really gotten out of hand‚Ä¶ this year‚Äôs recipe is mostly originals, with Dominick‚Äôs delight being a modification of a Liber & Co recipe (that vastly improves it imo). Gotta give credit where it‚Äôs due!!  


Normally I put together this post on Christmas Eve‚Ä¶ but considering I was still straining out the olive oil fat wash from the rum about 30 minutes before the party started I completely ran out of time and was flat out the whole night. So this has sat on the back burner until recently. Enlisted the help of a friend with a DSLR and a photography hobby to get some better shots for y‚Äôall this year :)  
 

Required Recipe (for post - others will be in the comments):  
Olive Want for Christmas  
- 2oz Olive Oil Fat Washed Neutral White Rum  
- 3/4oz Cardamom Simple Syrup  
- 3/4oz Fresh Lemon Juice  
- 2 Dashes Orange Bitters  
Shake, double strain into a Nick+Nora  


Intent for this one was to mimic the flavors of an Italian Olive Oil cake. I think it worked out great - and it was by far and away the biggest hit of the night. Spices and citrus are very prominent but not overbearing and the olive oil fat wash added a slight creaminess to the texture as well as the olive oil taste coming in on the back end.

1in2r43,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToVermont/comments/1in2r43/winter_advice/,Winter advice,"This is my first Vermont winter (as a lifelong southerner). I‚Äôm in love with the beauty of the snow, so far avoiding the seasonal depression slump, and faring just fine driving in the occasionally unfavorable conditions. I‚Äôve really enjoyed embracing the ‚Äúcozy‚Äù vibe and spending some time by the wood stove exploring my indoor hobbies like cooking and crocheting. Here‚Äôs the few things I‚Äôm struggling with adjusting to, hoping some Vermonters or fellow transplants can offer advice (or just some reassurance)- 

1. What are people doing to keep their high energy dogs exercised? My heeler is definitely getting a little stir crazy. 
2. I‚Äôm finding winter sports kind of‚Ä¶ inaccessible. We‚Äôve found plenty of awesome local options for occasional free lessons or equipment rentals (been doing CC skiing) but I want to branch into doing it on my own and ski equipment is just so expensive. I know buying secondhand is an option but am too much of a beginner to know what is a good deal. And I‚Äôd love to try my hand at downhill but I‚Äôve been warned that some places aren‚Äôt the most beginner friendly? and lift ticket prices are a lot. Do I need to just bite the bullet and buy some good gear? Take some lessons?
3. The desire to just BE outside without all the fuss, if that makes sense? I‚Äôm the kind of person who likes to have coffee on the porch or read a book or just relax in a hammock and it‚Äôs kind of a bummer sometimes that I can‚Äôt just take a walk outside without all my layers and gear and such. I know there‚Äôs not really any solution to this, just hoping for some reassurance that I‚Äôm not a complete failure of a Vermonter, Lol!

***

For those of you who are unfamiliar with this series, Complete History of CFB is a project run by /u/TotalEconomist and /u/bakonydraco that aims to give a complete, detailed rundown of a selected season in college football.

The 2008 season was a year that exposed the cracks in the Bowl Championship Series. Seven P5 teams ended the season with one loss (in addition to undefeated Utah), re-igniting the debate over an expanded playoff. Once again it was left to the BCS formula of human polls and computer rankings to decide which losses mattered and which didn't. Some of the major narratives that defined the season:

* The year 2008 was [all about Tim Tebow](https://i.imgur.com/vqQgE1t.jpeg). College football's 'bigger-than-Jesus' star [made a heartfelt promise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kI44yk9TSdI) after the Gators' loss to Ole Miss, then backed it up with a second national title in three years alongside the dazzling play of Percy Harvin and a stalwart defense.

* [What about the Utes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrXeoiAJCkc) Kyle Willingham's 2008 Utah squad was one of just two undefeated FBS teams, but never got a chance to play for the national title and had to settle for a Sugar Bowl victory over Nick Saban's resurgent Crimson Tide.

* [The tiebreak system in the Big 12 South](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEmLbsl5VPY). One of the division's strongest seasons began with Texas' upset of top-ranked Oklahoma in Dallas, peaked with Michael Crabtree stunning top-ranked Texas with a last-second touchdown in Lubbock, and ended with the Longhorns watching two teams they beat by double digits play for the Big 12 title after a controversial tiebreaker.

* [The return of the Crimson Tide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9X_ujq8WB8). Six years of futility against Auburn finally came to an end thanks to Nick Saban, who led Alabama to a 12-game winning streak behind a stingy defense, a pair of strong tailbacks in Glen Coffee and Mark Ingram, and an emerging star in freshman sensation Julio Jones.

* [What did Seattle do to deserve 2008?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuVx2syXa54) The misery of the Mariners and Supersonics' last-place seasons was surpassed by that of the Huskies, who went 0-12 for the first time in program history and set a standard for awfulness that may never be surpassed in college football.

* While the year wasn't quite as chaotic as 2007, upstarts like Oregon State, Iowa and Ole Miss got their chance to shine on the big stage by knocking off established powers.

* The year of the quarterback? Perhaps. With the spread offense catching fire in CFB, 2008 saw a host of star QBs putting up gaudy stats in the South, including Sam Bradford, Colt McCoy, Graham Harrell, Tim Tebow, Chase Daniel and Case Keenum.

* D√©j√† vu in the ACC. Despite losing a significant chunk of talent to the draft, opening the year with a shocking stumble against ECU, and losing to both Miami and FSU, Frank Beamer's Hokies did just enough to win a second straight ACC crown.

* While the venerable Joe Paterno led Penn State to a Big Ten title in his 43rd season, many of his peers weren't so lucky. Phil Fulmer, Tommy Tuberville, Tommy Bowden, Joe Tiller, and several other veteran coaches saw their tenures come to an end in 2008.

* An Appalachian State four-peat? No chance. The upstate Richmond Spiders stunned the Mountaineers in the FCS playoff quarterfinals, and went on to win the first national title in program history.

Enjoy reading! And don't hesitate to point out any errors or major omissions. Note: I highly recommend using Old Reddit to read the article, not New Reddit.

Of course, I wouldn't know anything about that because roleplaying is silly and also lame and for nerds and did i mention silly.

For the coffee pot portion, The little piece that goes inside the tubing broke. I think it‚Äôs some sort of float valve, but I‚Äôm no expert. It‚Äôs a black hollow plastic cylinder with a white ball in the center. Can it be ordered online somewhere? Could I just replace the tubing without that piece inside of it and get away with it? It is the tube that goes from the reservoir to the heating element. 

I will also need a piece of tubing but I have no idea how to figure out what size it is. 

I know the machine is probably more than 30 years old, but it has sentimental value. I would rather repair it and just purchase a new machine.

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1in2m8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1in2m8j/naviva_the_perfect_resort_for_relaxation/,"ÔªøNaviva - The perfect resort for relaxation, rejuvenation, and reflection.","We just got back from our second trip to Naviva and thought I would do a review. I will go into more details below. If you are looking for paradise that is a short plane ride away, you have found it here. I don‚Äôt even know if you should read more, just go‚Ä¶..

Background: This was our second trip to Naviva. Our first trip was exactly a year ago as we were in the beginning stages of navigating a new cancer diagnosis for my wife. That trip was absolutely amazing and special. So now a year later, she has battled through multiple surgeries, completed chemotherapy and is cancer-free! It was time to celebrate and turn towards healing. For us, there was going to be no more perfect place for that celebration than to return to Naviva.¬†

Booking: We booked with u/Alex\_travels on Sarah‚Äôs team after she had posted about a group trip on here. I would highly recommend using them if you are booking. First off, it costs you nothing. Second, having someone who understands your travel goals and needs makes everything just a little bit better. And third, their relationship with hotels makes for such a seamless trip. As an example, our room was festively decorated with balloons, streamers, flowers, and chocolates when we arrived. Multiple notes were left welcoming us back and congratulating my wife on the next stage of her health journey. It really made arrival feel extra special.¬†

Getting There: To get to Punta Mita, most people fly into PVR. I personally love that this part of Mexico is only a 2.5-hour plane flight from Texas and about the same to Southern California. Making this a very easy trip with an extended weekend. From PVR, it is only a \~45-minute car ride (in a private SUV arranged by the resort).¬†

Arrival: It has been said several times, but I will say it again: the staff at Naviva has designed it to feel like you are going to someone‚Äôs home. But this someone is so kind and nice that once you arrive, you are never going to want for anything while you are there. The moment you get out of the car, the staff is there to welcome you with a welcome drink and invite you to conversation. This is not the normal check-in conversation; as a matter of fact, there is no check-in. This is the first chance to get to know the team and for them to get to know you. ‚ÄúIt is so good to see you again. How was your trip? What are you looking forward to? How can we help?‚Äù ¬†Once you are ready, it is a golf cart tour of the resort. Try not to gawk at the beauty, and then off to the room.¬†

Rooms: The rooms are described as tents, but they are more like the perfect master suite. From the screened-in porch to the large deck with a plunge pool, comfy hammock, and outdoor shower, you might want to never leave your room. Both tents we have stayed in have had gorgeous views of the ocean and felt very quiet. You feel like you are in the middle of the forest all by yourself. The rooms are still very new and have amenities like mini fridges stocked with drinks, coffee, tea, and even margarita ingredients ready to go. There are Bluetooth speakers for you to connect to, a telescope, and binoculars to use to spot wildlife.¬†¬†

Nature: Part of the magic of Naviva is how it is built into the environment. The tents and paths have been carefully designed to make the natural environment flow through them. There is beautiful wildlife all around you. We saw whales playing right off the beach the whole time we were there. Mamma and baby jumping and waving in the water. At one point, fellow guests were out kayaking, and we could see the whales jumping no further than 50 feet from them! Absolutely amazing. On land this weekend, we saw coati‚Äôs, iguanas, and javelinas. In the air, my bird app counted 30+ varieties of birds around our room from peacocks to chachalacas climbing the giant fig tree out back. You absolutely cannot help but feel connected to nature.¬†

Activities: First of all, I am pretty sure any activity you can imagine, Naviva will help you pull off given notice. I do have a couple to highlight. The spa pods are gorgeous open-air tents, where you can get a massage (one is included in your trip!) listening to all the sounds in the trees, with the ocean waves in the background. Talk about a relaxing setting. I also love the sound meditation on the Terrace, a spot overlooking a rocky portion of the beach, in a beautiful sunset setting. A local guide will walk you through the journey listening to a sound bath and a beautiful meditation.¬†

Food: While there is no set menu, every day there will be specials for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But if you would like something else, ask, and they will most likely be able to make it. One night at dinner, the special was Italian-themed that my wife ordered. I felt like having tacos. Looking around, I noticed a guest with a steak, another had a hamburger, and a 3rd was eating sashimi. Sophia is the head chef and absolutely magical. Ask to do a cooking demonstration with her! Her enthusiasm for the craft is infectious, and you might even learn to make something new at home. There is a beautiful chef garden she might even let you go see.¬†

People: Saving the best for last, the staff at Naviva are wonderful, but not because they will help you get the most out of your vacation, and they will go above and beyond to meet any request you have. But because they take the time to get to know you, asking the 2nd and 3rd question beyond ‚Äúhow was your day?‚Äù and pretty soon you are having meaningful people connections, and you feel even more connected to this special place.¬†

In summary after two trips, the people here feel like old friends; the place feels special. We will be back soon.¬†

1in2m04,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1in2m04/dead_front_teeth_in_desperate_need_of_implant/,Dead front teeth in desperate need of implant,"So my top front tooth has been the bane of my existence for over 20 years now. I knocked out the adult in an accident at 6. My dentist decided it was worth doing an experimental procedure to try and get it reattached, and it did reatrach but it died. Lucked out for many years, it was snaggly but didn't turn brown or black.

Then as a teenager I needed braces. Before the Ortho was willing to put braces on me, they had me get another experimental procedure done. They were worried about it's stability and I got a root canal done on it in hopes it would better keep my tooth from fracturing or falling out during the orthodonture work.

And then I was dealing with pretty severe depression and PTSD while I had the braces and struggled with dental hygiene while also being a coffee addict, hence the decay on either side of where the bracket would have been.

I have been brushing every single day for over four years at this point, and the decay has gotten worse still. Nothing can stop it. And I get chronic infections in the root. There's a perpetual salty-sour taste in my mouth, and I can suck the infection fluid out from the decay. It's bad enough that I have prescription antibiotic mouthwash that I'm encouraged to get filled regularly, but I can't perpetually be on antibiotics.

I work selling high end custom furniture and am the assistant to our in house designer, and am going to school for architecture. These are fields that I would guarantee be a failure in if I didn't have a front tooth, and unfortunately having the decaying tooth that has a fairly high potential of killing me one day from the infection spreading to my brain in marginally better than having no top front tooth, because clients will judge my professionalisn and abilities based off of it.

I have state insurance, which doesn't cover implants, and the dental insurance available through my work doesn't cover implants either. I looked into Spirit Dental but even if I waited another 3 years they would only cover half, and quite frankly I couldn't even afford the 3k cost left over from that and the total spendature of the insurance by that point would be higher than the amount they'd cover anyways. My credit score is in the low 500s so I wouldn't qualify for even in house financing for the implant.

So basically, what I'm wondering is if any dental surgeon on here is willing to take a pro bono case in exchange for complete permission to utilize the case however you want. You wanna put my before and after pictures on a billboard? Go for it. You wanna show off my X-rays to potential patients? Do it. You want me to sit down for a whole interview about it? I'm down. You wanna use my case in an educational form for dental students? Heck, I may even join the lecture in case they want to ask me questions, too, if possible. I'm Wisconsin based but willing to travel since it would still cost less than out of pocket.

Link to pictures of said tooth: https://imgur.com/a/NupWgQA

I am working on getting copies of the last X-ray done on it two years ago but I will say that the tooth is in worse condition than it had been then. It's basically hollow and I have to take a toothpick and scrape plaque and food out of the cavities on each side several times a day.

Removal without replacement is not optional. I'd rather let the infection spread to my brain and die than deal with losing an entire top front tooth.",1,1739291370.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1in2kka,https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/comments/1in2kka/experience_with_antisemitism/,Experience with antisemitism,"I think what a lot of people just don‚Äôt understand is how common antisemitism is. Growing up my older brothers got spit on and jumped for being Jewish. This was in a very diverse liberal area of Michigan. 

I ended up moving to a very conservative mostly white area where I was the only Jew in the town when I was 13. My older brother again got spit on and harassed, forcing him to switch schools. I didn‚Äôt stand up for myself as much as he did, but was constantly bullied. So many hitler jokes, gas chamber jokes, and just viewed as an alien for being Jewish. Which continued into adulthood. 

On top of this I have family in Israel and have visited a few times. When I went for my bar mitzvah there were rocket attacks the day I landed. Constantly having to hear about busses exploding near my cousins, or coffee shops exploding down the street. None of this justifies what Israel is doing, but it‚Äôs important context that is completely ignored by one side. 

That being said I‚Äôm incredibly privileged and it could‚Äôve been so much worse. I‚Äôve always had Muslim and Arab friends. Always empathized with them because I know their experience has been much worse. I just feel like we have so much more in common as individuals and we‚Äôre all getting swept up in a propaganda war and it makes me sad. Some of my best friends won‚Äôt talk to me anymore. 

I imagine Ethan has a very similar view point and experience as I do. To be Jewish, and hyper aware of this conflict for your entire life. Experience anti semitism for your entire life. And then have people who learned about it a year ago from TikTok try to explain it to you, and call you a genocidal freak for even having a slightly different opinion is so demoralizing.

I feel, for instance, like my worst symptoms are my inability to focus and that comes less from a million things in my head at once and more about the way my mind will wander from non-linear item to non-linear item. 

Even when talking about medication, I felt sort of guilty and avoided telling my psych that the meds actually helped me feel more awake and alert - since what I had read over and over again was that if you had ADHD they should make you sleepy. No, they wake me up in a way that I used to need 3 cups of coffee to accomplish and allow me to actually concentrate on one task at a time. As I think about it now, I realized that I was probably reading about how hyperactive people react to the meds rather than inattentive.

If you print this, please share some photos! Id love your feedback as this is a v1.0. I expect it may need some modifications/revisions in the future.

Hello

My wife loves to have her daily dose of caffeine even if she continuously says she needs to get rid of it.

She used to have a cup of tea but lately she's not been getting the kick out of it.

She doesn't like the taste of the sacheted quick mix coffees that you'd usually get at hotels or the Nescaf√© coffee powder.

She wants her coffee to taste like that from a proper cafe, with milk, no sugar.

I know she normally orders cappuccino at cafes, or the latte sometimes.

I have zero coffee knowledge.

I am thinking of gifting her a coffee machine that can make her a coffee like ""that from a proper cafe"" but something that doesn't need a lot of prepping etc.

What coffee machine would you suggest I could gift her please?",2,1739291091.0,IndiaCoffee,16,1.0,False

# üß†¬†[AI and the Death of Critical Thinking: Microsoft Research:](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2025/01/lee_2025_ai_critical_thinking_survey.pdf)

A new study from Microsoft Research explores how increasing reliance on AI tools may be eroding critical thinking skills, particularly in education and professional settings.

* The paper explored the results of surveys with more than 300 people across nearly a thousand first-hand examples of generative AI use in the workplace.¬†
* **The researchers found**¬†that GenAI tools ‚Äúappear to¬†reduce the perceived effort required for critical thinking tasks¬†among knowledge workers,¬†*especially*¬†when they have higher confidence in AI capabilities.‚Äù¬†

Conversely, workers who are more confident in their own skills tend to think harder when it comes to evaluating and applying generated output. But either way,¬†**the data shows ‚Äúa shift in cognitive effort**¬†as knowledge workers increasingly move from task execution to oversight.‚Äù

Though the study has a number of limitations, the researchers determined that the regular use of¬†**generative AI is causing a shift**¬†from information gathering to verification, from problem-solving to AI response integration and from task-doing to ‚Äútask stewardship.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhile GenAI can improve worker efficiency, it can inhibit critical engagement with work and can potentially lead to long-term overreliance on the tool and diminished skill for independent problem-solving,‚Äù the researchers wrote, adding that such systems ought to be designed to support critical thinking in people, not to diminish it.¬†

**What this means:**¬†While AI enhances productivity, the research highlights concerns about over-dependence on AI-driven decision-making, potentially reducing independent analytical abilities. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/11](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

Elon Musk and a consortium of investors have reportedly made a staggering $97.4 billion offer to take control of OpenAI, signaling a major power shift in the AI industry.

* The bid was submitted by Musk's attorney to OpenAI's board, with backers including xAI, Valor Equity Partners, Baron Capital, and other investment firms.
* The offer comes as OpenAI attempts to transition from nonprofit to for-profit status, with a pending $40B investment from SoftBank at a $260B valuation.
* Musk said he aims to return OpenAI to its open-source roots and promised to match or exceed any competing bids for control of the organization.
* Altman responded dismissively on X, offering to ""buy Twitter for $9.74B"" instead, leading Musk to call the CEO a ‚Äòswindler.‚Äô

**What this means:** The drama never ceases between two of the biggest figures in the tech world, but it's no surprise to see Altman rebuff the offer after Musk‚Äôs lawsuits and prodding. With both heavily involved in the U.S. government‚Äôs tech push, this likely isn‚Äôt the last we‚Äôll see of Musk‚Äôs vendetta against the company he helped create. If successful, the bid could reshape the future of AI development, governance, and ethical oversight, potentially altering OpenAI‚Äôs trajectory. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/11](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

# ü©∫¬†[Report: Generative AI Boosts Physician Performance:](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03456-y)

A new study finds that generative AI significantly enhances physician efficiency, improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing administrative burdens in clinical settings.

* The team conducted a large, randomized trial of 92 physicians across three groups. One group was just a chatbot on its own; one group of 46 physicians had access to the chatbot and the other group of physicians ahd access to conventional means and methods.¬†
* The team presented each participant with a set of five real patient cases, then enlisted a panel of doctors to score the resulting written responses that detailed how each doctor (or chatbot) would handle the situation.¬†

**The findings**: The paper‚Äôs big finding was that physicians using the language model¬†**scored ‚Äúsignificantly higher‚Äù**¬†compared to those using conventional methods. The difference between the LLM on its own and the LLM-assisted physician group was negligible.¬†

It‚Äôs not clear what caused the difference, if the LLMs induced more thoughtful responses from the doctors they were paired with, or if the LLMs were producing chains of thought that the doctors hadn‚Äôt considered.¬†

‚Äú**This doesn‚Äôt mean patients**¬†should skip the doctor and go straight to chatbots. Don‚Äôt do that,‚Äù Chen said in a¬†[statement](https://link.mail.beehiiv.com/ss/c/u001.929jZiiRht9qZPYC5Z_-tZ6szAcMrTKc4i-LA1DFDhSJQqTE9qvJzr-4jTk5ZxEyVntOfyn-a-T4YExmqhs1m02RYnJD0yGuUUYRXqYNJhMjBw9a4unSwjXVma8ZIKFF3n5uf95HcWC7_zrcVTu2yrU6byWYpFTXKVJkZC6PqPf0HxWEyXoJPqnGMpiLeA7zi4tq-sOSrVo2MkzMnaqwLg3yVkeKVNfUaKA3GQbpUvGjiGoGjwpBCzOigM-OPUrxvlUbH8e-Ac6gIXj-ZRX9u5d8AXCGFZCCFKG-nL0894gn0ZHnEO4ZH3zHSy3WVtHYA9VAkuJvp9eyDypAL6jk_GjZjzIjt4vDnt9Pisx4g_Y/4dx/5wCgPftqRZ29JhuggkkE5A/h29/h001.zdxT9rHkbulbJV7zdwTKJMVfEE-nPXdd8O2-5B-vGAc). ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of good information out there, but there‚Äôs also bad information. The skill we all have to develop is discerning what‚Äôs credible and what‚Äôs not right. That‚Äôs more important now than ever.‚Äù

**The challenge (& the ethics)**: Still, there‚Äôs a reason LLM use isn‚Äôt yet widespread in the medical field.

* There are also issues here of data privacy ‚Äî in order for these models to do what‚Äôs being described here, they need access to a trove of personal patient data, a critically risky maneuver.¬†

Still, those same doctors were pretty excited about the potential for AI to aid hospitals and improve patient outcomes, and many expect to adopt the tech within the next few years.¬†

Anthropic's new Economic Index provides an in-depth analysis of AI interactions across various industries, linking AI usage to specific tasks and occupations while revealing key insights into how Claude is being utilized.

37% of queries were from people working in software and mathematics, partly reflecting that Claude has been the model favored by many developers.

The next biggest category was editing and writing, together with software accounting for almost half of usage (47%).

57% of usage involved ‚Äúaugmentation,‚Äù including back and forth brainstorming, refining ideas, and checking for accuracy. 43% of tasks were effectively automating tasks. If we take all AI usage including powering corporate tools there might be a different division.

The paper suggests that AI is supporting tasks, not replacing jobs, but it is being widely used: 4% of roles use AI for at least 75% of tasks, 36% of roles show usage in at least 25% of their tasks.

Usage peaks in the top quartile of wages, but very high as well as very low wage brackets have low AI usage.

Among the skills demonstrated most in AI tasks are critical thinking, problem solving, and troubleshooting.The paper

**What this means:** Tech companies are racing to bring robots into our homes, and while many have featured the typical humanoid builds, Apple's research suggests that success may depend on both advanced capabilities¬†*and*¬†creating devices that can interact in ways that feel more natural and emotionally resonant to users.This innovation could redefine household AI, making digital assistants more intuitive, engaging, and lifelike. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/10](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

A new AI tool, ""C the Signs"", shows promise in early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection. Based on a retrospective study of 894,275 patient records, the AI achieved high sensitivity (93.8%) in identifying CRC risk, even up to five years before a physician's diagnosis in 29.4% of cases. This tool could significantly improve early detection, particularly important given the rising incidence of CRC in younger individuals who are often not routinely screened. The model's speed and ability to identify at-risk patients warrant further investigation for improved CRC outcomes. The research was presented at the **ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium and reported in the** ***American Journal of Managed Care***\*\*.\*\*

**What this means:**¬†This advancement could lead to significantly improved survival rates, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and allowing for more proactive interventions. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/10](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

OpenAI is set to complete its first custom AI chip in 2025 to reduce dependence on Nvidia's hardware, signaling a major shift in the AI computing landscape.

* OpenAI is finalizing the design of its first custom AI chip and plans to send it to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) for production, aiming for mass production by 2026.
* This strategic move intends to reduce OpenAI's reliance on Nvidia and enhance its bargaining power with other chip suppliers, with plans for more advanced processors in the future.
* The chip will utilize TSMC's 3-nanometer process, featuring a systolic array architecture and high-bandwidth memory, and is expected to initially support OpenAI's internal AI model operations.

**What this means:**¬†This move could help OpenAI scale its operations more efficiently while intensifying competition in the AI chip industry. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/10](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged concerns that AI‚Äôs economic gains could be concentrated among a few entities rather than benefiting society at large.

* Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, acknowledged that AI's advantages might not be evenly distributed and suggested concepts like a ""compute budget"" to ensure widespread access to AI technology.
* Altman expressed concerns about AI's impact on the labor market, noting that mass unemployment could occur without appropriate governmental policies and reskilling programs in place.
* He also mentioned that while AGI could solve complex problems across various fields, its development would require significant financial investment, though user access to advanced AI systems is expected to become more affordable over time.

**What this means:**¬†This raises important discussions about policy interventions, wealth distribution, and ethical AI deployment. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/02/10](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

1in2exm,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1in2exm/the_power_of_contextbased_language_learning_a/,The power of context-based language learning: a scientific exploration,"Alright, buckle up‚Äîthis is going to be a dense ride. But hey, sometimes the best journeys are the ones where you learn the most, right? Think of this as a comprehensive review of why context-based learning is such a game-changer for language acquisition. We‚Äôre going to place all the evidence into perspective, from how the brain naturally processes language to why traditional methods often flop.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I‚Äôve been developing a tool for language learning that leverages these very principles, gathering a wealth of research in the process‚Äîresearch I‚Äôm now eager to share with the community. Also, yes, I used AI to help organize these insights , because if technology can draft coherent prose in multiple languages, why not harness it to improve our own language skills?

So, settle in, maybe grab a cup of coffee, and let‚Äôs explore the science together.

# 1. The Cognitive Foundations of Context-Based Learning

# 1.1. Language as a Pattern Recognition System

The human brain doesn‚Äôt learn languages by memorizing isolated vocabulary and grammar rules‚Äîit assimilates patterns from large amounts of meaningful input. This principle is supported by **connectionist models of language acquisition** (Elman, 1990; Tomasello, 2003), which illustrate how our cognitive systems detect, store, and reproduce linguistic structures.

* **Implicit Grammar Acquisition (Ellis, 2002):** Research suggests that learners internalize grammar rules implicitly when they encounter frequent, natural sentence patterns. This process is less about consciously ‚Äústudying‚Äù grammar and more about gradually recognizing recurring structures in real communication.
* **Statistical Learning (Saffran et al., 1996):** Our brains are wired to pick up on frequency distributions, patterns, and contextual cues‚Äîmuch like how infants discern word boundaries from continuous speech. When exposed to vast examples of a language, we subconsciously track how often certain words appear together, how they‚Äôre ordered, and in what contexts they‚Äôre used.

**Why This Matters:**  
Because your brain is essentially a pattern-spotting machine, it thrives on rich, contextual language. Grammar drills and memorized rules often fail to ‚Äústick‚Äù because they don‚Äôt leverage this natural pattern detection mechanism.

# 1.2. The Role of Memory in Language Learning

From a cognitive psychology standpoint, memory can be divided into two main systems:

* **Explicit Memory (Baddeley, 1997):** This involves the conscious recall of facts and information‚Äîthink of it as your mental ‚Äústudy guide.‚Äù Using flashcards or memorizing grammar rules are explicit memory tasks, which can be slow, taxing, and often temporary.
* **Implicit Memory:** This system allows us to learn and retain skills, habits, and patterns without conscious effort. It‚Äôs how you can ride a bike or type on a keyboard without thinking about each movement. In language learning, implicit memory helps us internalize vocabulary, collocations, and grammatical structures naturally.

**Why Context-Based Learning Activates Implicit Memory:**  
When you read or listen to a story in your target language, you aren‚Äôt just memorizing words; you‚Äôre ‚Äúliving‚Äù them in context‚Äîabsorbing syntax, vocabulary, and meaning simultaneously. Over time, these repeated exposures solidify into linguistic intuition, much like how a child picks up their first language without flashcards or verb conjugation tables.

# 2. The Neuroscience of Contextual Language Learning

# 2.1. How the Brain Learns Languages Naturally

Brain-imaging studies highlight that second-language acquisition involves many of the same neural pathways as first-language acquisition. Key regions include:

* **Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (Broca‚Äôs Area):** Responsible for processing grammar and syntax, this region becomes more active when learners process sentence structure. Meaningful, natural language input engages Broca‚Äôs area more efficiently than artificial drills.
* **Superior Temporal Gyrus (Wernicke‚Äôs Area):** Crucial for auditory comprehension, Wernicke‚Äôs area helps decode the sounds and meanings in speech. Providing context-rich auditory input‚Äîlike listening to stories or conversations‚Äîstimulates this area effectively.
* **Hippocampus:** Central to consolidating new vocabulary into long-term memory, the hippocampus benefits from repeated, meaningful exposures to new words. Think of it as your personal ‚Äúlibrarian,‚Äù cataloging every word and phrase you meaningfully encounter.

**Why Context Matters (Kuhl, 2010; Hulstijn, 2001; Schmidt, 1990):**

* **Enhanced Retention:** Words and structures encountered in real, dynamic contexts trigger stronger emotional and sensory associations, leading to deeper encoding in memory.
* **Reduced ‚ÄúCognitive Load‚Äù:** When context supplies clues about meaning, the brain can focus on overall comprehension rather than frantically translating each word.

# 3. The Linguistic Advantage of Extensive Reading

# 3.1. The Input Hypothesis and Extensive Reading

**Stephen Krashen‚Äôs Input Hypothesis (1985)** posits that:

1. **Comprehensible Input (i+1)**‚Äîslightly above your current level‚Äîis the engine of language acquisition.
2. Learners pick up language most effectively when they understand the overall message, not by fixating on discrete rules.

**Extensive Reading** is a prime example of providing this kind of input. You immerse yourself in large volumes of text that are just challenging enough to introduce new vocabulary and structures without overwhelming you.

* **Implicit Grammar Development (Horst, 2005):** Frequent exposure to natural sentence patterns through reading can sharpen your intuitive sense of grammar. You start ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù what sounds correct, rather than relying solely on memorized rules.
* **Increased Vocabulary Range (Cobb, 2007):** Reading even short texts offers exposure to more words per hour than memorizing vocabulary lists. Over time, you build a robust, context-rich lexicon.

**Takeaway:**  
Extensive reading aligns beautifully with the brain‚Äôs preference for pattern recognition. By consistently encountering words and structures in context, you not only expand your vocabulary but also internalize grammar rules effortlessly.

# 3.2. Vocabulary Retention Through Context

Studies show that repeated encounters with words in various contexts is the **most effective** way to learn them (Nation, 2001).

* **Context Builds Mental Associations:** Each sentence or paragraph you read positions new vocabulary in a specific semantic and syntactic environment. These repeated contexts act like multiple ‚Äúhooks,‚Äù anchoring each word to different facets of meaning and usage.
* **Repetition Deepens Understanding:** Seeing a word used in multiple tenses, with different collocations, and in varying emotional or factual settings teaches you far more than a single dictionary definition.

**Concrete Example:**

* Learning *perro* (Spanish for ‚Äúdog‚Äù) through a flashcard might make you remember ‚Äúdog‚Äù as a single translation.
* Encountering *perro* in multiple, meaningful sentences‚Äî‚ÄúEl perro corre‚Äù (The dog runs), ‚ÄúTu perro es muy cari√±oso‚Äù (Your dog is very affectionate), ‚ÄúAquel perro ladra mucho‚Äù (That dog barks a lot)‚Äîreinforces multiple angles of the word: actions, traits, contexts, and syntax.

# 4. The Role of Motivation and Enjoyment in Learning

# 4.1. The Affective Filter Hypothesis

Krashen‚Äôs **Affective Filter Hypothesis (1985)** argues that emotions‚Äîlike anxiety, boredom, and frustration‚Äîcan create a mental barrier that hinders language acquisition.

* **Traditional Methods:** Rote memorization, dull grammar exercises, and constant ‚Äútesting‚Äù can be stressful, causing your affective filter to rise. This state of tension can impede learning because the brain is too focused on performance and anxiety, rather than acquiring language naturally.
* **Context-Based Learning:** Engaging, dynamic content that resonates with your interests lowers this affective filter. When you‚Äôre genuinely curious or entertained, you immerse yourself for longer periods, creating more opportunities for your brain to absorb linguistic patterns.

# 4.2. Why Enjoyment Turbocharges Learning

Enjoyment isn‚Äôt just a nice perk; it‚Äôs a key driver of motivation and sustained effort. When you actually like what you‚Äôre reading or listening to, you‚Äôll do more of it‚Äîoften without conscious effort.

* **Longer Engagement:** If you‚Äôre engrossed in a novel or a captivating documentary, you‚Äôll push through challenging words to grasp the storyline.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** Each successful understanding or ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment reinforces the pleasure of learning, making it likelier you‚Äôll continue.

# 5. Practical Implications and How to Apply Context-Based Learning

# 5.1. How to Learn a Language Effectively

To harness the full power of context-based learning, consider these strategies:

1. **Read in Context (Novels, Articles, Subtitles):** Choose material at a level just above your comfort zone. If you‚Äôre bored, go higher; if you‚Äôre overwhelmed, scale back a bit. The sweet spot is where you can understand the main ideas but still encounter fresh words and structures.
2. **Use Mixed-Language Material (Strategically):** Initially, mixing your native language with the target language in small doses can keep you from getting lost. Gradually, you can shift the ratio to include more of the target language as your comprehension grows.
3. **Build Gradual Exposure:** Begin with settings or topics you‚Äôre already familiar with‚Äîthis ensures you have enough contextual clues to decipher new words. As you get comfortable, branch out to new areas or genres.
4. **Prioritize Enjoyment:** Select content you genuinely find interesting. If you‚Äôre into science fiction, read sci-fi short stories or watch sci-fi shows in your target language. Enjoyment keeps the momentum going and lowers the affective filter.
5. **Trust Implicit Learning:** It‚Äôs tempting to look up every new word or obsess over grammar. Instead, focus on the flow. Let repeated encounters solidify your knowledge. If something truly puzzles you, look it up‚Äîbut remember that over-reliance on explicit memorization undermines your brain‚Äôs natural pattern-detection abilities.

# 5.2. Why Context-Based Learning Is the Future

* **AI-Driven Personalization:** Modern platforms can tailor reading materials to your exact level, ensuring you consistently get ‚Äúi+1‚Äù input without ever feeling bored or overwhelmed. This kind of adaptive approach mirrors how a good teacher instinctively adjusts content to a learner‚Äôs needs.
* **Massive, Accessible Exposure:** With the internet, accessing extensive reading materials in nearly any language is easier than ever. Audiobooks, eBooks, online newspapers, and streaming media provide the enormous variety that fosters robust language acquisition.
* **Seamless Integration into Daily Life:** Instead of carving out ‚Äústudy hours,‚Äù future language tools can slip into your daily routine‚Äîpodcasts during your commute, bilingual subtitles on your favorite TV shows, or social media feeds in your target language.

# Conclusion

The consensus across cognitive psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience is clear: **Context-based language learning** taps into how our brains naturally operate‚Äîthrough pattern recognition, emotional engagement, and implicit memory formation. It‚Äôs a stark contrast to conventional methods that often focus on isolated drills and forced memorization.

If you‚Äôre weary of flashcards and rote exercises, consider immersing yourself in rich, meaningful content. Read that novel you‚Äôve been eyeing, watch compelling series in your target language, and listen to podcasts that pique your curiosity. Over time, your brain will do what it does best‚Äîabsorb patterns, make connections, and grow your language abilities naturally.

So, ditch the monotony. Embrace context. Your brain will thank you‚Äîand so will your conversational skills.

Without going into too much detail, my thoughts are that at the minute Huddersfield town centre is generally shit and depressing, but there are a few pockets of generally good independent businesses and places etc etc. Bars like Vox, coffee shops, other cultural bits etc.

My main gripe is, that the town is overrun by what I like to call copycat businesses. These are businesses that generally offer nothing to the character of the town or make it a desirable place and don't make people come here and may actively keep people away. Vape shops, betting shops, endless greasy takeaways, every variety of different pound shop, slot machine shops, etc etc. 

Given that the council gets rates from these buildings and want people to occupy them, what can be done to move these copycat businesses out of the centre? Do the council want this? Is part of the regeneration plan to somehow stop any more of these places to pollute the high street? Should they be converted to housing?
