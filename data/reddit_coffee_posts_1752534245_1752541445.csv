1m044nu,https://v.redd.it/hc3jtirnsxcf1,AITA for coming back into the room after using the bathroom and asking him if we were still going to do the things he originally made plans to do before it got too late in the evening.. was this deserved on my part?,"This is me coming back into what should be our room (which always turns into HIS room whenever he is pissed off at me for whatever reasons) after using the bathroom. I have been physically hurt by this male person in the past and thought we could move past the cheating and mental + physical abuse after he came back from a few month long work trip acting more straight-nit‚Ä¶ he moved back and convinced me to move in with him, ensuring me that this IS really what HE wanted.. I moved my probation down to this area (after already having previously transferred it to where I was living with my own room, bathroom, and I basically lived alone, was doing my community service well and was about to go to an outpatient rehab to get mental help and learn some ways to cope without using drugs) I have since turned back to slight drug usage as an escape from the suicidal ideations I have been getting from being treated like this and threatened to be kicked out at every turn‚Ä¶ yet again, when all I really do is housekeep, cook meals for him and his grandmother, give him attention and love whenever he wants it from me, spend time with him whenever he wants me to, take him wherever he wants to go whenever he wants or needs to go somewhere, I go on errand runs for the household and go to my office visits. I have a Job interview coming up soon that i‚Äôll most likely be able to get considering its just a factory labor job and my probation shouldn‚Äôt pose any threat to it but now it‚Äôs starting to take a more physical turn and I feel like its only a matter of time until he really hurts me again.. I don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation as Its unlikely I can transfer my probation back to where I was living (you cant just bounce back and forth) he could hypothetically just push me out the door on my ass as my name isn‚Äôt even actually on the lease (he told me he would but pushed it off and then never did it). I‚Äôm mentally in a worse spot than I was before I moved (and lowkey back on drugs) and now I‚Äôm not sure what state funded help I could even get in this area. I barely have time for my family and my toddler son (from a different relationship, whom also isn‚Äôt allowed to live with me) I feel crazy, trapped and taken advantage of and sometimes I feel like maybe I truly do deserve this cause how could someone be so angry at me if I haven‚Äôt actually done anything? Maybe Im forgetting something on my part? All I do know is I still have love for and care for him dearly despite the fact of everything he did to me and everything he is now doing‚Ä¶ (I have known him and we‚Äôve been good friends for 7yrs. We have been together, where I got a taste of his true colors, for a little over 1yr) there‚Äôs a lot more to the story than that but it‚Äôs mostly personal, I can boil it down to: The only reason I was arrested about a year ago was due to him enabling my relapse and during a traffic stop lowkey outing me to the cops (he was drunk as day is light so I don‚Äôt hold it against him), Afterwards he got kicked out so I had him come stay with me and my grandmother, I paid for the food and replaced all my items he broke (including a 65‚Äù smart flat screen TV) or just considered it a lost cause, I fought with my own grandmother to ensure HE would have a place to stay so she wouldn‚Äôt kick him out, and the main reason he held his job long enough to have this ‚Äòsuccessful business trip‚Äô (which he cheated on me during) was me fighting tooth and nail to keep him accountable for his job(s) and maintain a stable living area while also giving him the money I would go ubering for (in his car yes but still working my ass off) just for him to buy major amounts of weed with it (he also used some of the money for gas in his car but I would sometimes have to ask my grandmother for money to secretly give to him for gas) I had food stamps and still provided for my son who wasn‚Äôt allowed to be around while he was there, while the rest of the money went to feeding him every night and making him lunches for work and buying him coffee (for me to prepare for him every morning or else it was, yet another, major fight) I‚Äôm sorry for all the words but this is all really heavy on my shoulders and any advice other than ‚Äújust leave‚Äù (cause its NOT that easy) would be greatly appreciated.

1m0443f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m0443f/best_friend_who_latches_on_to_your_frenemies/,"""best friend"" who latches on to your frenemies","
So.... I have this friend (female, 32,  SAHM of 4) whom I (f, 33, SAHM of 2) grew very close to and we began to speak almost daily. This girl is the ultimate social scene addict. She needs to know everyone, she need to be friends with anyone, and if she crosses paths with anyone who doesn't jump and celebrate when they see her, it bothers her to no end. Even if she doesn't know that person well, it will be on her heart and mind for days why that person doesn't seem too interested in her. I'm quite opposite, in fact, I'd rather have one or two close friends that my kids and I can be close to and I'm good. She describes herself as very extroverted and she loves to meet and make new friends. 

Anyway, she began to confide in me about her friendships and I confided in her as well. One thing that was odd to me:  a year ago I was at a friend's house when she called. I said I'm with my friend. 
Her: o nice who is your friend? 
Me: Katie. 
Her: oh Katie, do I know her? 
Me: idk, she's from church. 
Her: hmmmm OK. 
We hang up and immediately I get a text from her:
Her: o wait katie from church, Ashley's mother. Oh yes I've seen her before, tell her I said hi. 
So she doesn't really know or hang out with this person, but has seen her at our small church community. Katie tells me no I don't know her, maybe I've seen her kids around tho. 

Fast forward, suddenly she's asking me alot of questions about Katie. Then it's become a weekly thing where she is now seeing Katie and walking up to her and chatting and getting personal etc. Not something I would do with a random person just bc we have a mutual friend but whatever. 
A year later, Katie and I stop really hanging out due to a misunderstanding. But now, I have my bestie who is telling me weekly ""oh I saw Katie, we talked, she's so nice, I saw her at the store and went up to her, I saw her at the day and talked to her and we took pictures."" I find this is weird bc Im like well you never crossrd paths with her until I mentioned her and now that we no longer are close, you're suddenly becoming close to her. 
This has happened with serveral of my friends now. Where I will mention their name, she will find them and befriend them, get close to them, and come to tell me about their interactions as if they are long time friends. 
Like I said, she has no shortage of ""friends"" and I've met most of them, but I have never tried to force a friendship with them or inquire about them. I don't need to and I don't care to becomes friends with her friends, but when we are all together we have a good time and get along great. 
Also, I've recently found out that shes been trying to get really close to 2 sisters that Im no longer close to and they clearly hate me. She doesn't know them, I introduced them a while ago and she latched on and she is always contacting them on their socials etc. Thing is, she will call me and say Idk what their problem is with you, you're an amazing girl, it's their loss, there is something wrong with them clearly. Yet, she is in cosntant pursuit of their time and attention.

This is becoming heavy and toxic to me. I now dread our phone calls bc it's gonna bother me when she mentions how she saw and went up to my old friends and how nice they are. 
I know of many girls she no longer communicates with and I've never approached them. One of her family members who really liked me invited me for coffee and my friend got extremely upset and said I don't want to ever see you with her. So I backed off. Just not sure how to approach her and not sure if this is even ""true friend"" vibes anymore. Sounds like she's just recruiting allies if anything. So heart breaking. 
I know if approach her she's must gonna say well I love people I love making new friends. Especially my frenemies lol. What is your take? ",1,1752541131.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I need help distinguishing if my last 4 years of marriage have been with a narcissist man and I have been mentally abused 
Here is some of the following he does
-uses my mental illnesses against me in arguments
-doesn‚Äôt hug me when I cry
-throws things at the wall when mad(phone, coffee table, glasses, you name it)
-has days where he is absolutely so kind, and others everything I do seems to annoy him 
-will ignore me if he‚Äôs upset
-will tell me to shut the f*ck up in argument if I am crying
-always says if he didn‚Äôt love me he wouldn‚Äôt spend so much money on me(I feel this is a ploy to make me feel bad)

I also have 208 mg/dL cholesterol. My uncle (on mom's side) had diabetes, and my grandpa (on dad's side) and his brother both had diabetes as well.

For reference, I have been lifting weights off and on for about 3 years now (mostly consistent during the summer with semi-consistent lifting during college time) and started taking creatine about 2 months ago + generally have been eating a bit more (3 meals a day rather than 2) to try and bulk. I've gained about 15 pounds in the last 3 months. I don't really do cardio as of right now but I used to run cross country about 5 years ago and have been thinking of picking up running again, especially since I haven't really been enjoying putting on weight and want to stay active besides just lifting weights.

Diet wise I eat a granola bowl (my mom bakes granola at home with maple syrup) with plain nonfat greek yogurt and about 1 cup of mixed fruits (blueberries, strawberries, and grapes) every day in the morning. For lunch since I've been commuting for work this summer, I usually eat chicken quesadillas or some kind of grilled chicken with rice and lentils. Dinner is usually the same as lunch but I also drink a protein shake a little bit before bed (1 cup whole milk w/ 64g of optimum gold protein powder and 5g of creatine). I could very easily switch to skim milk for the shake if that's necessary.

I don't eat sweets all that often, I'll have a cookie or a little ice cream around once every 2 days or boba (with 50% sugar) once every couple of weeks. I don't drink soda regularly but if I do at work, it's a Diet Coke or one of those Ice Sparkling Zero drinks. I don't drink coffee or tea either. I will acknowledge that I've been eating a bit more fried chicken than usual this summer but not a crazy amount, like maybe once a week or 2 weeks even. 

I honestly feel like I control my sugar intake and carbs more than the average person so this kinda came out of nowhere, it's probably mostly genetic but just wondering if anyone has general advice/easy tips that have worked for them. I have been doing research online but also just want to hear some personal takes or advice. TIA guys.

Not just rent and groceries. I mean $3 coffees, random Amazon purchases, subscriptions, etc. And it was a bit tedious at first, but it completely changed how I viewed my spending.

First some background:

Female, 37, 5'2 and 134 lbs (120 lbs before kids for many years). Desk job as a developer going for a promotion so a year of stress in general due to job requirements, on top of having 2 young kids (3 and 6).

Did fasting and keto diet for a year before getting married and lost 15 lbs. Past 1-2 years however I have been eating the same **yoghurt breakfast with a Celsius** and the same **chicken salad (whole grain) sandwich for lunch (with chips) + a lot of green tea (cannot do coffee)**. I rarely would eat dinner because I'd be too full so I would just sip on a glass of red wine. I'd have a drink every day and more on weekends but mostly Whiteclaws. I also like my sweets but nothing crazy.

I used to love running and dancing etc.

I'm from Sweden so grew up pretty healthy, was underweight for a long time as a kid, then I moved to the US some 16 years ago where diet is very different. No family history of heart issues and my brother and dad are skin and bones.

When my 2nd was born I had pre-eclampsia and BP was 180/150 or something crazy, they prepped me for seizure but I felt perfectly fine and was ok, had magnesium drip for 24 hours. Since then I feel like I had multiple ""elevated readings"" when I'd come in for check ups, but kinda in the 130/80 range.

I had some lingering discomfort in my left upper chest near armpit back in 2018, had an abnormal EKG and did stress test and monitor for 24 hours. Discomfort was very localized and ""minor"", nothing crazy came back from the tests (slight ST elevation?) Anyway it went away but returned this year again. Didn't think much of it but it wouldn't go away, I also felt it kinda in my left rib/side, and eventually I also started feeling millisecond tingles in my arm, jaw, back etc. Hence the dr appointment and blood work (also had some abnormal bleeding which is another issue I've stressed about).

Currently on another heart monitor after another abnormal EKG but stress test and echo cardiogram was ok (no clots, good valves etc but no official result until Wednesday). I had anxiety for a while because of all this and dr offices make my BP rise, but for a week it was constantly in Hypertension stage 1 and 2. I'd constantly check my BP at home. The past couple days though they have all been below 120/80 because I think I have calmed down a bit and realized it's just anxiety (hopefully).

\----

So this now brings me to my questions and hopefully solutions to lower numbers again, if anyone has any input:

In May my husband and I went to Ireland for 10 days and I drank ciders non stop, ate chocolate, fish and chips, Irish stews etc, you know what I mean hehe. **Could this be why my numbers are suddenly spiking?** Other than that I have not done anything different so I really suspect this is what is throwing me off.

However, since the new numbers and sudden spike I'm of course concerned. My BP is finally down on a regular basis for now. I have been walking and running again daily + doing weights, planks etc. I've been tracking what I eat to get more fiber and keep saturated fats under **10mg**. I'm also checking cholesterol levels (less than **100mg** a day), also keeping sodium to less than **1000mg** a day. Saturated fats is actually pretty easy to keep under 10mg for me but the rest is tricky.

Now I'm eating oatmeal for breakfast, cut out all cheese, no more chicken salad sandwiches, no more energy drinks, no more wine. We are trying to do a **Mediterranean diet** which is ok, but I do miss my red wine and cheese and dark chocolate. I also take, as asked by my dr who didn't seem concerned about the numbers, **4000mg fish oil** after dinner which I try to eat now since smaller lunches. I also take the cholesterol reducing **plant stanol** chocolate chews and a **D3+K2 vitamin**. I tried psyllium husk but cannot tolerate the texture. **What can I eat instead to up soluble fibers?  How effective are plant stanols short term?** They do have some sugar.

Also with these rather drastic changes (to me), **how long would it take to lower the numbers to what they were 5 months ago?** I'm hoping once I'm back to normal, I can continue with my daily walk and run but maybe not take all these extra supplements or be super strict on the cheese and wine? Just kinda track it and eat it more in ""moderation"", not every day.",2,1752540654.0,Cholesterol,0,1.0,False

Are you the type uninterested in short term relationships with no true connection? Tired of meeting guys who don't see you for you? Do you want something real but have had such a hard time finding it? Then keep on reading, because I might just be perfect for you!

You: Emotionally deep, loyal, and kind. Maybe a bit shy, but once you trust someone you give 100%. You're saving yourself for the right person, because you value the importance. In terms of looks, a cute face and a athletic body, but healthy or slim are okay too. Think Tifa or Aerith. If you love nerdy things like gaming and anime, then we'll have at least a thousand things to talk about. 18+, but I typically look between 22-29 for maturity, but not a hard limit. Female at birth.

Me: ENFP, 2w1. Some people have golden retriever or black cat energy, but I have the rare caffeinated-owl energy: I can focus on something like crazy, but otherwise I'll be playing two games at once, watching an anime, and talking with friends all at once. I have a big heart, I'm emotionally intelligent and available, and I will laugh at like anything when having a good time. I'm 5'8"", 140lbs of pure muscle, no bones, trust me. Amazing blue-grey and gold eyes, soft hair, and good hygiene. Total package. Jk. Unless? I also dress nice. Think Zack Fair with less SOLDIER baggage, less spiky hair, and eventually the same build, guaranteed.

I'm working on my Master's, am on the Dean's list, don't smoke, don't drink, no drugs, and I absolutely want kids someday. I cook a mean fettuccine alfredo, love anime and RPGs (Final Fantasy, Elden Ring, BG3, DBZ, Fullmetal Alchemist as a few examples), reading sci-fi/fantasy, and my dream is to be an author one day. I also play Dark Souls for fun, so you know I'll stick it through the hard times.

My non-negotiables? Pretty simple, actually. Loyalty and someone who's saving themself for the right person or marriage. Not judging anyone else, this is just the connection I'd like to have.

Some people might avoid this, but I'll say it. I'm looking for love, something that lasts. Late night streams, relaxed video calls, long walks, and book store or coffee shop dates. Oh, and if you do a Cloud x Tifa or Zack x Aerith cosplay with me, I will marry you. Or at least fall in love. Respectfully. Also, straight and monogamous.

Location: Richmond, IN, about an hour from Indianapolis, IN and Cincinnati, OH. I am open to LDR in the US if we fit and there's a long-term plan. Please be open to video chats! I mainly use discord, so yeah. After introducing ourselves, we can swap selfies and see if we fit.

If you got this far and this doesn't sound like you, I thank you anyway, and wish you the best in finding something amazing.

If this sounded like a dream come true, I hope you'll say hi.",1,1752540619.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

My dad left us when I was a baby. My mom always said one day he just decided to leave and never came back (to her). We had weekends at his apartment every other weekend. He put the bare minimum effort in, we watched tv and ate tv dinners mostly but he did take us on a few ‚Äòvacations‚Äô to his parents house a few states away. He was never involved in anything beyond his bi-weekly visits, except for attending a handful of sports events over the years. 

Cut to today, we have a fine relationship. He lives 20 mins from me and is retired. He spends 1-3 weeks per month out of state, 15 hours away in his hometown where he owns hunting land. I love this for him. It‚Äôs a smalllll town and he‚Äôs like royalty bc his parents owned the only factory that employed half the town. His mom lives there, she never contacts me and doesn‚Äôt respond when I reach out. 

I was born in the beginning of my parents divorce so I think a lot of my extended family just never took to me. 

This is my issue now. My dad sporadically comes and goes from my life. I am a new mom, I have 2 kids under 3 years old. I try and keep my kids active by signing up for library classes (sign ups are weeks in advance), paid mommy and me classes, I reserve free museum passes ahead of time, make play dates 1-2 times/week, and general other stuff like food shop the same day each week, meal prep on the weekend, etc. I also have a small farm that requires around 15 hours of work each week from both my husband and me. 

The cycle has been going like this: my dad disappears for weeks without any calls or texts. I send him pictures of my kids and ask to meet a few times, he never responds. When he gets back to town (random and unplanned til the day of) he eventually texts and asks to make plans for that day or the next day. 9/10 times I already have plans. Sometimes/usually I cancel my plans to meet with him. He acts like he never left, spoils my kids with a gift, one time he gave me $15k of gold and drove away, one year $500 for my birthday, then other times he says he‚Äôs bringing me coffee and brings nothing. Super sporadic and random. A few days or even up to 2 weeks go on like this. Nearly daily visits and daily check ins. I start to get used to having him around and my kids love seeing him. Then randomly a few weeks later he‚Äôs gone again and the cycle repeats. 

I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt just take what I can get and be happy with it. It seems like some abandonment trigger is being pushed bc I don‚Äôt know if my reaction is normal. 

This time, he asked to meet 3 days ago and I was busy. I‚Äôve texted him daily since trying to meet or sending pictures but he‚Äôs left me on read each time. ",1,1752540280.0,family,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been a Breville fan for years. My original machine lasted over 7 years and I loved it. I‚Äôm in the coffee business, so people are always asking for gear recommendations, and I‚Äôve recommended Breville machines to hundreds of customers and friends over the years.

When that first machine finally gave out, I upgraded to the Barista Pro. Solid machine, until it wasn‚Äôt. Around 18 months in, it needed repairs. Breville handled it, but the fix only lasted a while. Once it failed again, I was just a couple months outside the warranty, and they wouldn‚Äôt replace or repair it. They did offer a discount on a new machine. (I will say they have good customers service)

So I took a chance on the Oracle Jet. A $2,000 machine with a sleek new look and all the bells and whistles. I was genuinely excited.

But right out of the box? It was a total bust. The auto-tamp left a divot in the puck, so every shot extracted way too fast. Within four hours, I was boxing it back up and shipping it out.

Honestly, the biggest disappointment is that I‚Äôve been such a vocal advocate for Breville over the years. I believed in the brand, but after two machines failing and now this $2K flop, I can‚Äôt keep recommending them in good faith.

At this point, I‚Äôm likely going to go with a Lelit Bianca. I would spring for a La Marzocco, which we use exclusively at my  coffee house, but at $6K+ it‚Äôs hard to justify for home use.

Curious if anyone else has had issues with the Oracle Jet? Or thoughts on the Bianca vs. other options?

Maybe even before the police get to my house. I want someone, anyone, to know why I‚Äôm doing this. Maybe with some perspective, I‚Äôll seem like less of a monster. I‚Äôm not a monster, I‚Äôm a mother. 

Divorce is a hell of a thing. 

After every scrap of evidence my lawyer and I gathered, every late night and early morning, every written testimony from everyone I knew‚Äî the stupid judge hadn‚Äôt even read them, hadn‚Äôt even looked at the photos of bruises. 

Travis had taken the classes and gone to AA, and that was good enough for ‚Äúyour honor‚Äù. 

Even though it was 50/50 custody, even though I had half, I felt like I lost it all. 

I‚Äôd left him for Trinity, my 8-year-old. I did all of this to keep her safe, and now she was going to have to face him alone. 

I failed her. 

Explaining it to her was tough.

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to, Mommy!‚Äù

I sighed, petting her head gently. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to, either.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair! Why do I have to?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause the important man said you have to. The rules say whatever he says goes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù 

I blinked the tears from my eyes, ‚Äúbecause your daddy did just the right things, and the important man said that made him a good daddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs a bad daddy,‚Äù she wined. 

I sniffed, I didn‚Äôt like to talk badly about her father to her, but at the same time I never wanted to invalidate her. Because she was right. Travis was a bad daddy. ‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I wiped the tears from my eyes. 

It broke my heart that she‚Äôd have to go back there without me. I can‚Äôt imagine what that‚Äôll be like for her. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared,‚Äù she whispered hollowly. 

‚ÄúI know, baby, but I‚Äôll be right here for you when you come back,‚Äù my voice cracked with the fear and pain I felt. 

Going to AA, and the abuse and parenting classes, Travis had met some new people. Awful people. People like himself. 

I guess that‚Äôs why it started getting worse. 

I guess that‚Äôs what started the changes. 

First, she started getting quieter. Sinking into herself. The bouncy girl that sang and danced all around the house at all times, slowly became the sullen silent girl that sat in corners and spoke softly only when she needed to. 

I don‚Äôt even remember when the sing-song, ‚Äúmommy pass the ketchup, I need some for my smiley fries. If I don‚Äôt get some, they‚Äôll be frowny fries!‚Äù‚Äî turned into the mumbled, ‚Äúmom, can I please get the ketchup?‚Äù

It happened over the course of the year, gradually quieter and quieter. 

She cut her long, beautiful hair. 

She stopped wearing her favorite dresses. She said she only wanted pants when I took her shopping. Even for my sister‚Äôs wedding, she would only wear a dress if she could put her little jeans underneath. 

These were just little things, but her personality was the first change I noticed. 

A few weeks in to the split custody, I heard a shrill scream in the dead of night. 

I bolted upright, thinking he had gotten to my baby. It took a few blinks before I realized he wasn‚Äôt here. I didn‚Äôt have to save her, I needed to comfort her. 

I was at her bedside before I knew it. She flinched as I touched her. She was babbling ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt tell,‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that,‚Äù and ‚Äúit hurts.‚Äù

It made me look at the bruises on her arms. A hand that had clearly grabbed too hard, with too much authority. He‚Äôd been hurting her again. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, honey, Mommy‚Äôs right here,‚Äù I told her frantically. 

She screamed again and tucked her arms close, kicking her feet. Hot tears streaked her cheeks. ‚ÄúGet off of me!‚Äù She sobbed. 

‚ÄúBaby, it was a bad dream, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I soothed. 

Her eyes seemed to fix on me, and she flung her arms around my neck. ‚ÄúMommy, mommy, it was horrible.‚Äù

‚ÄúShh, Trinity, it‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what else to say to her. 

She sniffled, curling herself closer. ‚ÄúThey did something to me,‚Äù she whispered. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd they do?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to say,‚Äù she cried. ‚ÄúThey‚Ä¶ they put something inside of me.‚Äù

That was a lot to chew on. I mulled it over, knowing Travis had been into some pretty dark stuff. Who knows what he and his friends could‚Äôve done to her, or have had done to her. Had they put a curse on her, or a demon in her? The idea that a malevolent spirit was feeding on my daughter both enraged and terrified me.  

I prayed with her. Asking God to undo whatever Travis and done, and protect her from him doing more. 

I petted her head, not knowing this was the beginning. 

Next came the appetite. She started eating and eating and eating some more. It was insatiable. I saw that girl wolf down a stack of pancakes as tall as her head and neck combined. 

I woke up in the middle of night to get a glass of water, and found her sitting on the floor in front of the fridge eating anything she could get her little hands on. 

She started eating weird things, too. Like putting a pickle under a slice of cheese in the microwave, then eating it with a fork. Meat sticks with tartar sauce. Cottage cheese with ruffles sour cream and cheddar chips (actually that one was really good). She craved maraschino cherries the most. She ate a whole jar in one sitting. 

It seemed like a growth spurt had hit her like a bus. 

Trinity started maturing in other ways, too.  Growing hair, filling out in certain places, body odor. 

I had thought she was a little young, but maybe she was just an early bloomer. 

Then one morning, I was getting her ready for school. Packing her lunch, making sure she showered and got ready, the whole bit. When she came into the kitchen fidgeting with her shirt, I was cooking bacon. I turned to tell her something when I realized she was turning green. I began to ask her what was wrong, when she doubled over slightly and spewed rancid beige and pink puke all over me. I swore I could see the rancid acidic, fruity, fishy smell. 

I gagged myself. 

‚ÄúOh my god, I‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù she panicked. 

I grabbed a towel and wiped her chin where a little excess dribbled, ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay. Are you sick?‚Äù 

She nodded, ‚Äúmy tummy hurts,‚Äù she clutched it to demonstrate. 

I sighed, ‚Äúgo lay down, I‚Äôll call the school.‚Äù 

She nodded again, solemnly, embarrassed, before shuffling off to her room. 

Trinity kept throwing up, too. Every other morning she rushed to expel whatever racked her body. 

It was then that I started getting suspicious. 

I was frustrated I wasn‚Äôt getting any answers from Travis. Frustrated that I didn‚Äôt know how to help her. 

Her face began to change. Not just as she grows, but her nose swelled up and her eyes sunk in. She started getting acne. Red dots paraded across my little girls face and sores opened from her little fingers picking them. Her hair became greasier and started falling out. Her nails became brittle. She became brittle. 

Then, I started noticing her body shape. Her hips and thighs got bigger, her stomach distended, and her unmentionables swelled. Her feet and hands got so big they looked disproportionate to her body. 

Trinity was changing inside and out. 

She was irritable. Not regular maturing kid irritable, but something else. She had rage behind those eyes sometimes. 

Once, she frisbeed a plate at my head. She picked up things she shouldn‚Äôt have been able to. She toppled our statue of Mother Mary, breaking her open beckoning hands. 

I bought her a cross to wear around her neck, but she never wanted to wear it. 

I sprinkled holy water in her food and she threw it up. 

I put salt around the door and windows in her room and I found them dusted away. 

One day, she winced in pain as she bit into a cupcake. 

I squinted, trying to make sense of it. Had the cupcake hurt her? ‚ÄúSweetie, come here.‚Äù

She looked worried, like she‚Äôd done something wrong. 

‚ÄúC‚Äômon,‚Äù I coaxed. 

She came over with her head hung low. 

I gently touched her chin and lifted her head. ‚ÄúOpen up.‚Äù

When she did I was hit with the smell of decay. All of her teeth were laced with yellow, brown, and black. There were holes in some spots, and cracks in others. 

Whatever this was, she was rotting from the inside. 

It was then that I called our priest about an exorcism. Father Wilkerson said these things take time, he‚Äôd have to get approval. He told me to take her to the doctor first.  

So I took her to the dentist, and three extractions, seven crowns, and 18 fillings later, she was a new girl. 

It was some time before I heard back from the priest. I tried to ask him about it at church, but he always told me he was still waiting. 

I couldn‚Äôt wait anymore. I couldn‚Äôt sit by as my daughter was victim to some unholy spirit that tore her body and mind apart. She wasn‚Äôt my daughter anymore. She belonged to the demon now. 

I cried myself to sleep often. 

She woke me up with her nightmares often. 

She kept just saying they put something inside of her, and I knew that Travis had put a demon inside my daughter to punish us. 

This all lead up to this morning. 

She woke me up early with a nightmare, and while she dozed back off I drank my coffee. 

When she got up she immediately emptied what little contents she had in her stomach, loudly retching as she prayed to the porcelain god. 

We prayed and ate, and she managed to keep it down. 

Then she got ready to shower, and that‚Äôs when shit really hit the fan. 

I heard her scream. 

I ran to her, worried that some ungodly thing had gotten to her. 

It had. 

I burst through the door to find my daughter screaming and crying hot tears. She was naked, ready for her shower. Her hands clutched her sides as she fell back against the bathtub. ‚ÄúIt hurts, it hurts,‚Äù she screamed. There was a mess of watery blood pooling on the floor. It ran down her legs. It was then that I saw the affliction. 

Her stomach stretched and bowed and moved. There was something moving inside my baby. A little hand pressed against the elastic skin, making a distinct print. 

My scream joined hers, and I rushed to her side. She grabbed my hand so hard I felt the sickening crack and pop of my weak finger bones. ‚ÄúMommy, call the hospital, I‚Äôm going to die.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, no, honey,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to die. We‚Äôre going to get this demon out of you!‚Äù

She shook her head as she cried out a string of nonsense in pain. 

I reached for my phone and made two calls. I called the priest and told him to get his holy ass over here. I don‚Äôt care about approval we need this now. And I called my sister. She said she was on her way. 

I moved Trinity to the dining table, figuring that would be the best place to do it. 

She writhed and moaned and screamed out. 

Father Wilkerson came first. He really didn‚Äôt want to without approval. He kept telling me to take her to the hospital first. But when he saw the state she was in, he decided to do some tests. 

He kneeled beside her, praying with her. 

Her screaming became even louder and she thrashed and banged her head on the table. 

He sprinkled holy water and she flinched and howled. 

‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù Screamed my eight year old baby girl through her teeth to our priest. 

He steeled himself, and rose to his feet, opening his bible. He was going to do it. He was going to free my baby. 

That‚Äôs when my sister walked in. 

The priest turned to see Jess approach, clutching her purse nervously. 

She took one look at Trinity and began to cry. She took her hand, holding it gently. 

Trinity seemed to calm down a little. 

‚ÄúAntie,‚Äù she wheezed, her voice hoarse from all the screaming. 

‚ÄúHello, beautiful,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna talk to your mommy, okay?‚Äù 

She nodded, beginning to tense up as another wave of agony hit her. She screamed and Father Wilkerson began praying again. 

Jess grabbed my arm harshly as she led me into the blood covered bathroom. ‚ÄúYou need to take her to the hospital now!‚Äù

I shook my head, ‚Äúno, no he put a demon in her, I know it!‚Äù

She grabbed my arms, ‚Äúyou take her to the hospital, or I will.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThere is no injection against the devil,‚Äù I wailed, ‚Äúthis is the only way I can get my baby back!‚Äù

She slapped me, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a sorry excuse for a mother,‚Äù she spat. ‚ÄúCome with us or don‚Äôt,‚Äù she ripped a towel off the rack to cover Trinity‚Äôs body. And I followed her into the kitchen sheepishly. If she was going, I was going with her. 

I‚Äôd told her I would always be there for her, and if that means she‚Äôs stuck like this for a few more hours , than I‚Äôll be right there with her until we can get back to the priest. 

The drive was uncomfortable. I sat in the back with Trinity‚Äôs writhing body resting in my lap. She wailed and howled as the unclean spirit wracked her body. 

They rushed her in right away, and she was seen in record time. 

And everything changed when that doctor spoke to us. 

I still hear his words echoing in my head. Even now as I clutch the pillow in my hands. 

She looks so beautiful, I mused. She lay sleeping in the hospital bed. Her hair a halo around her head like the angel she really was. 

I love her, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing this. Because she can‚Äôt live in a world where what the doctor said is true. 

Because he told me my daughter is pregnant. ",1,1752539779.0,u_immagetchu_uwu,0,1.0,False

For content creators, influencers, photographers, and visual artists, finding the right studio space can make or break the look and feel of a shoot. And let‚Äôs be honest: when you‚Äôre curating an Instagram feed, building brand deals, or launching new campaigns, the¬†*vibe*¬†matters.

That‚Äôs where¬†**CC Studios**¬†comes in. Tucked away in a convenient Miami location with free parking and a fully private layout, this 3,000 sq. ft. creative space is built for today‚Äôs creators. From aesthetic backdrops to production-grade equipment, everything you need is already here‚Äîno add-ons, no waiting, no distractions.

But instead of just telling you what‚Äôs inside, let‚Äôs talk about why these setups are so¬†*Instagram-worthy*‚Äîand how they‚Äôve become a go-to for content days, brand launches, podcast filming, and full-blown campaigns in South Florida.

# Why Instagrammable Spaces Still Matter in 2025

Before we get into the features, it‚Äôs worth asking: why does the look of your content space still matter so much?

The truth is, Instagram (and TikTok, and YouTube Shorts) is still a visual-first platform. A scroll-stopping set not only helps your post stand out, but it also communicates your brand‚Äôs style, elevates your professionalism, and attracts higher-quality partnerships. Whether you‚Äôre shooting a branded reel, new product line, podcast visuals, or just a week‚Äôs worth of content for your feed, the space you shoot in matters just as much as the camera you‚Äôre using.

What today‚Äôs creators are looking for is a balance between production functionality and beautiful design‚Äîsomething not every studio in Miami can offer. But at CC Studios, that balance is the foundation.

# The Arch Wall: A Creator‚Äôs Favorite Corner

Let‚Äôs start with one of the most iconic backdrops in the space‚Äîthe¬†**20-foot wall of arches**. This set has gone viral more than once, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. Inspired by Mediterranean architecture and built with content in mind, the arch wall offers soft lines, interesting shadows, and just enough structure to keep things feeling editorial but organic.

Whether you‚Äôre shooting outfit content, a moody branding set, or a skincare reel, this corner plays beautifully with natural and studio lighting. And unlike standard arch cutouts, CC Studios lets you re-style this wall using an ever-changing selection of curated couches, armchairs, and on-trend props. You can recreate a different look each time you shoot without ever changing locations.

# 

# The Rotating Wall: Two Backdrops, Zero Hassle

One of the most loved (and underrated) features of the studio is the¬†**rotating wall**‚Äîa double-sided set that flips effortlessly to offer two completely different looks. One side is a clean white paneled frame, perfect for lifestyle shoots, headshots, and elevated content. The other is a textured limewashed mocha that gives your content warmth, mood, and a touch of high-design minimalism.

This built-in versatility means you can shift the vibe of your entire shoot in under 30 seconds. No dragging heavy backdrops or resetting gear‚Äîjust flip the wall and keep creating.

If you‚Äôre planning a¬†**Miami content day**, this wall alone gives you two distinct looks without ever needing to pause for a full set change. Perfect for batching branded content or creating a variety of photos for your grid and Stories.

# The Cyclorama Wall: Built for Polished Visuals

If you‚Äôve ever tried to find a large cyc wall in Miami that isn‚Äôt shared or overpriced, you know the struggle. At CC Studios, the¬†**25‚Äô x 20‚Äô cyclorama wall**¬†is part of the all-inclusive rental‚Äîno hidden fees, no hourly upgrades.

This full-size white cyclorama provides the seamless, infinite background that elevates any shoot from basic to professional. Whether you‚Äôre shooting product photography, a music video, a branding reel, or a fashion editorial, this cyc wall allows full-body movement, wide-angle camera work, and complete lighting control.

And yes,¬†**professional lighting gear**¬†is already set up and included. Just plug in your camera and shoot.

# 

# The Glam Station, Mirror Moment, and Comfort Touches

Shooting great content is about more than just the backdrop‚Äîit‚Äôs about how smooth and comfortable the experience is. That‚Äôs why CC Studios includes thoughtful, creator-first details like:

* A private¬†**glam station**¬†with professional lighting and a large mirror for hair and makeup
* A full-length¬†**mirror wall**, perfect for fit checks, BTS shots, or getting your reel transitions just right
* Two¬†**bathrooms**, a¬†**kitchenette**, and a¬†**lounge stocked with coffee and energy drinks**‚Äîyes, energy is important
* Central AC, WiFi, wardrobe racks, and tons of¬†**free props and chairs**, already on site

From the moment you walk in, the space is ready to go. No waiting for another booking to clear out. No lugging in equipment. Just show up and shoot.

# Podcast-Ready, Product Launch-Friendly, and Creator-Tested

What makes CC Studios more than just a pretty space is its flexibility.

There‚Äôs a dedicated¬†**podcast-ready corner**¬†with clean backgrounds and great acoustics. But you can honestly shoot a podcast from anywhere in the studio‚Äîit‚Äôs fully private, after all.

Brands also love using the space for¬†**product launches**, lifestyle campaigns, and showroom-style popups. The rotating wall, couch setups, and clean cyc wall allow for creative, modular installations that make content creation seamless for teams and solo creators alike.

# How Much Does It Cost?

CC Studios is all-inclusive, which is rare for Miami. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

* **$110/hr**¬†on weekdays
* **$130/hr**¬†on weekends

That price includes everything: all sets, lighting gear, props, parking, glam area, and complete privacy.

There are no hidden cleaning fees, equipment add-ons, or hourly upcharges for using the cyc wall. What you see is what you get‚Äîand creators really appreciate that transparency.



# Who Books This Space?

The better question is: who doesn‚Äôt?

You‚Äôll find everyone from micro-influencers shooting sponsored content, to major brands creating campaign assets. TikTokers, YouTubers, lifestyle bloggers, agency photographers, startup founders, musicians, and wedding photographers‚ÄîCC Studios attracts a wide mix of creators who want professional-level visuals in a private, design-forward space.

It‚Äôs also ideal for:

* **Miami branding shoot locations**
* **Influencer studio rentals**
* **Fashion and lookbook shoots**
* **Photography workshops and content days**
* **Podcast filming in Miami**
* **Studio rental for beauty, skincare, or wellness creators**

# Final Thoughts: Book Your Content Day in Miami

Instagram is still one of the most powerful platforms for influence‚Äîand the quality of your space plays a massive role in how your content performs. CC Studios is built with that understanding at its core.

From the iconic arch wall to the full-sized cyc, from rotating sets to cozy lounge areas, it‚Äôs more than just a photo studio. It‚Äôs a place to¬†**create, explore, and elevate**¬†your work‚Äîall in privacy, without limits, and with zero stress.

Whether you‚Äôre planning your next content day in Miami, shooting a brand launch, or capturing lifestyle content for your grid, this space is fully stocked and waiting for you.",1,1752539641.0,u_ccstudiosmia,0,1.0,False

1m03dhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1m03dhh/the_quiet_house_on_witch_hazel_lane/,The Quiet House on Witch Hazel Lane,"An odd serenity often lingers in the air in the wake of violence. Morbid as it may be, I have always found a sort of peace in the various ambient sounds present at such scenes and learned to appreciate the poetic absurdity of their persistence. The sound of a trickling faucet left running by a woman now dead on the kitchen floor, the hollow tones of a wind chime hung from a rafter just as its owner had done to himself, near flawless juxtapositions that might have drawn the envy of the Old Masters themselves had they witnessed them. Fittingly, just as an artist might use different shades for aesthetic means, they are not only useful for that purpose but can be used to tell a story, to draw focus to an overarching theme that could not be easily gleaned without their consideration.

Of the countless scenes I have been called to over the years, there was one where this rule did not apply.

My phone rang around 11:40 pm that night. Sergeant Jim Nichols had been flagged down by a group of three shaken boys who reported that they had found a body in the abandoned house at 215 Witch Hazel Lane. The youngest of the three had been dared to go into the residence and wave at the remaining two from a second-story window. Once on the second floor, he found the body and ran down to tell his pals. The boys were taken to the station, and their parents were called in order to obtain statements while Nichols and three others went to the address where they found a decomposing body in one of the second-story closets.¬†

Hanging up the phone, I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and put on a pot of coffee while I dressed for what would likely be a long night.¬†

The gravel drive was fairly short, but it wound through the trees in such a manner that it seemed much longer than it was. At the end rose a decrepit, two-story home that had long since been abandoned. It was surrounded by ancient oaks constricted by vines, which intertwined, obstructing any view of the property from beyond the perimeter. The front of the structure was fitted with a sagging and rotten porch whose roof bore many of the same qualities, while unintelligible graffiti adorned the exterior in places, accentuating the chipping paint, broken windows, and all other derelict qualities of the once beautiful home. The only sources of illumination that night were emitted from the headlights and rotating blues of the patrol cars, which had carried Nichols and the others to the scene earlier that evening.

I exited my car, placing my flashlight in the back pocket of my pants, and hung my camera around my neck before approaching the trio. The two younger officers, Haley and Rogers, appeared a bit shaken, which was to be expected. It was the unease I detected on Nichols' grizzled face that gave me some concern. Jim was a seasoned veteran who had responded to some of the more gruesome scenes I had been a part of and never showed an iota of trepidation. Telling the others to remain at the cars, Jim motioned for me to follow him to the front of the residence as he glanced at the half-open front door.¬†

""Something's not right here, Teddy..."" he said once we were out of earshot of the patrolmen.

""Foul play?"" I asked.

""Dunno... It's something about this place. It's like it plays tricks with you.""

I let out a breathy chuckle. ""Halloween was two weeks ago, Jim. Maybe it's a case of residual spooks?""

He didn't laugh.

""I'm not playin' around here, Teddy. Something's off. Not sure how to explain it, but..."" he trailed off, seeming to try and form a coherent explanation.

Confusion and concern were what I was feeling in the moment, but the combination of the two states must have manifested in an impatient or mocking expression.

""... You think this is fuckin' funny?"" Jim snapped.

""Easy... Alright, I'll cut the shit."" I said, raising my hands in surrender. I nodded to the door.¬†

""Let's take a look.""

Removing the flashlight from my pocket, I clicked it on and trained the amber beam at the doorway and began to make my way towards it, Jim hesitantly trailing behind.

I didn't expect there to be any overt noises in such a house given its abandoned state, but one would imagine the sounds of creaking floors or rafters, or the faint sounds of rats clawing about in the walls, but there was nothing. Once I crossed the threshold, the sounds of the officer's radios and the persistent chirping of crickets ceased as though the door had been closed behind me. I looked back to see Jim standing on the front porch just on the other side of the open door, trying and failing to mask his dread. I shot him a quick smile and motioned with my head for him to come in. After a moment and a deep breath, he joined me in the silence.

It was an oppressive quietness. My ears were popping and began to ring as I stepped further into the foyer. If I hadn't seen Jim step in behind me, I would not have known he was there. We stood still a moment while I listened intently for anything, but the only new sound I detected was the faint thumping of my heart and the unsettling whooshing noise of the blood it was pushing through my veins with progressive intensity.

""See what I mean?"" came what seemed like a whisper from behind me.

Jim moved to my side as we looked around.

""Is this place sound proofed?"" I asked, half startled by the volume of my own voice resonating in my skull.

""Not that I can tell. Even if it were, you'd think those broken windows would let somethin' in.""

I moved my light towards the windows in the adjoined living room to see nearly all of them had been shattered at one point or another.

""This isn't even half of it..."" he said, pointing his light to the wooden staircase ahead.

Wondering what could possibly be stranger than the silence, I made my way to the staircase and began my absurdly quiet ascent. The stairs were old but mostly intact. I could feel the old boards flexing under my weight, but there was no groaning of wood against wood. I stopped halfway up the stairs upon noticing the absence of something else.

""Didn't you say the body was in decomp?"" I asked.

""What?"" Jim responded in what seemed like a whisper.

I turned to face him ""Decomp. Didn't you say the body was in decomp? I don't smell shit.""

""Yeah, noticed that too.""

Once on the second-floor landing, I moved my light to the left down the hallway to see several doors in varying states of openness and a few small piles of refuse left by trespassers. Looking to the right, I saw it several feet from the top of the stairs -- leaning against the wall in a sitting position was the subject of my being in that strange home.¬†

The skin had begun to turn a brownish black, the hair on its head was sloughing off, and it wasn't as bloated as I thought it should be. Although its features were not very evident, I could tell by its lack of clothing that it was most definitely the body of a male. I set my flashlight on the banister, ensuring the beam remained trained on the body, raised my camera, and snapped a photo of the gruesome scene.

I saw Jim's light coalesce with mine, and I turned to ask a question.

""Fuck me..."" he said, all of the color drained from his face.

I looked at the body, then back to Jim.

""You told me on the phone that he was in a closet,"" I said in a near-scolding tone.

He stood silent, his light and eyes trained on the rotting corpse.

""Jim, if you're about to tell me --""

""It was, Ted. It fucking was.""

""Was? What do you mean it 'was'?""

""I mean it was in the closet two doors down on the left from the stairs when I last fuckin' saw it..."" he said, panic now rising in his voice.

I shined my light to the left to see the closet door standing open. Scanning the dirty, wooden floor between it and the body, I saw a damp trail leading between the two. I drew my pistol.

""Jim, did you and your boys clear th ‚Äì""

""-- Yes we cleared the fuckin' house, Teddy! No one's here and no one's come in.""

""Unless one of you moved it, we have someone else in here!"" I snapped, now scanning each doorway for movement.

Jim pulled the radio from his belt and tried to call Haley.

‚ÄúRadio‚Äôs not getting out, Ted.‚Äù

""I'll hold here. You go get the others and clear the first floor. Meet me back here once you're done."" I said without looking, Jim's light moving from the body being the only confirmation that he had heard me.

""Get a few other units out here to set up a perimeter, too!"" I yelled with a deafening resonance. I wasn't sure he had heard me, but I didn't want to turn and check.

I had been in hairy situations before, but this was most definitely the strangest. I scanned left and right again, half expecting to see a head poking out from one of the rooms. Sensing that I needed to calm down, I took a few deep breaths and moved my light back to the corpse. I knew that I had a few minutes before the three patrolmen cleared the first floor and made it back to me, so I decided to use that time to try and deduce the location of our intruder.¬†

Looking at the floor in front of each doorway, I couldn't see any sign of recent disturbance save for the boot prints from the patrolmen's boots and damp drag marks consisting of a reddish-yellow fluid. Surprisingly, the second-story windows were mostly intact, with a few sporting various cracks and chips from decades of neglect. All of them were closed, however, and appeared to have been so for some time, given the cob webs and dust built up around the edges. Unless there was a way off the second story from inside one of the rooms, someone had to be up there with me.¬†

I looked at the body, specifically the arms and legs. If someone had drug it from its previous location, the desiccated skin would be torn by the pressure, but from my position, I couldn't tell if that were the case. From what I could see, there wasn't a rug, blanket, or any other item that could have been used to pull it along the floor either. The cadaver was sitting on the floor with nothing underneath it, rotting flesh to hardwood.

Minutes passed as I stood at the top of the stairs. The relatively light weight of my pistol and light seemed to increase as my arms and shoulders began to tire. I couldn't hear where the patrolmen were in the house or if they were inside at all. Despite how scared he may have been, I knew Jim would be back inside as quickly as he could. It was the younger men I feared might refuse to come back inside if they knew what had transpired.

¬†

I glanced at my watch, and another three minutes had passed. The thought crossed my mind that the sicko had made it down to the first floor at some point, and Jim and his men needed help.

Checking both ends of the hallway one last time, I backed down the stairs, keeping an eye on the landing. Still no noise. I took each step carefully as not to fall, keeping one foot planted firm on one step and sliding the other down to the next. I kept waiting to hear the sounds of a scuffle or gunshots, but heard nothing but my heart pounding in my ears. I took a few more steps, feeling that I should be close to the bottom, and turned my head to look behind me. Jim and the other two officers stood at the bottom of the stairs, guns and lights in hand.

""Jesus!"" I exclaimed, startled by their appearance behind me. ""Where the fuck have you been?""

""We found some more rooms towards the back here that we hadn't checked yet. Took us a bit longer. Any signs up there?""

""Nah, no signs. It was just me and John-fucking-Doe up there catching up. Let's go clear the second floor."" I said, more than a bit agitated.

The four of us made our way back up the stairs, with me on point. With backup behind me, I felt a bit braver and took the steps much quicker than I had before. I had hoped that by my leaving and the absence of the noise of our return, we would catch the bastard trying to move.¬†

Approaching the final steps before coming back into view of the body, I slowed my pace, steadied my breath, and prepared for a fight. I felt a hand on my shoulder, reassuring me I wouldn't be in it alone. As my head broke the threshold, I shined my light into the hallway.

The corpse was gone.

""Fuck!"" I exclaimed, rushing onto the landing, looking down both ends of the hallway.

All at once, sound returned like a tidal wave. Footsteps sounded like thunder, and the creaking of the floorboards sounded as though the house was about to give way. I looked back to see Jim and the other officers now on the landing and shining their lights wildly around the hall.

‚ÄúWhere the fuck did it‚Ä¶‚Äù Jim began, but started to gag at the overwhelming stench of death that suddenly filled the air.

‚ÄúHoly shit!‚Äù Rogers said, burying his nose in the crook of his arm.

‚ÄúJim you and Rogers take left, Haley, you‚Äôre with me‚Äù I said, stifling a gag, then began to move.

My light shone on the puddle of fluid pooled on the floor where the corpse was last. As I got closer, my beam caught the glimmer of another putrid trail of brown-streaked, yellow ichor leading underneath a closed door at the end of the hall.

‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù I called.

Stepping towards the door, I checked the knob. It was locked, but it was covered with something viscous. I pulled my hand back to see the same noxious fluid covering my hand. Bile rose in my throat as I frantically wiped my hand on my pants.

‚ÄúPolice! Open up!‚Äù Jim ordered as he pushed past me.

We stood for a moment, listening for any movement. Nothing.

Jim stepped back and, with practiced motion, kicked the door open, and the three uniformed officers flooded the room with me at their tail. Amber beams of light shone all around the empty bedroom as we searched every square inch.

‚ÄúIn here!‚Äù Jim called out from the closet at the other side of the room.

Looking at the floor as I moved, I saw where the trail veered from the bedroom door and through the now-open closet door. As I reached the threshold, I saw lights fixed once again on the rotting body sitting at the back wall.

Sirens and the sounds of tires on gravel heralded our reinforcements' arrival. Jim‚Äôs radio must have started working again since I heard him giving orders for the responding officers to begin a sweep of the area. I checked and double-checked the windows in the room to find them closed and covered with dust and cobwebs. They hadn‚Äôt been opened in years.¬†

We searched the house over and over, looking for any trap doors, hidden rooms, or exits, and we found nothing. There was no evidence of any crime having been committed there either‚Äîjust bits of trash and broken furniture from years gone by. The exterior search uncovered nothing as well. I was confused, angry, and horrified all at the same time. I felt sick.

This was last night, and I haven‚Äôt slept because I still smell that damn body. My clothes are in a garbage bag on my back porch, and I‚Äôve taken three showers since I got home. The stench must be burned into my nose.¬†

The morgue has called my phone twelve times in the past twenty minutes, but I haven‚Äôt answered. The smell has started to go away and it‚Äôs gotten very quiet in my house, so I have a feeling of what they may have to say.",1,1752539078.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The current generation of digital food scales are loaded with technology. Precision, ease of use, and extra features like smartphone connectivity are common, but the quality and implementation varies a lot.

**High-Precision Sensors**

The accuracy of a digital food scale hinges on its sensors.The best models utilize high-precision strain gauge sensors that offer accuracy within +/- 1 gram or 0.1 ounces. Thes sensors provide reliable and consistent measurements, ensuring precise ingredient ratios for baking or accurate portioning for dietary purposes. High-precision sensors use materials that resist drift and temperature changes.

**Tare Functionality**

The tare function is a standard feature, but its performance is crucial. Top-rated scales offer instant and accurate taring, allowing users to zero out the weight of containers quickly and efficiently.The best tare functions automatically remember the last used container, and subtract that weight. This simplifies measurements when adding multiple ingredients to a bowl or container.**Multiple Measurement Units**

Versatility in measurement units is essential for following recipes from different sources or regions. The best digital food scales support a wide range of units, including grams (g), ounces (oz), pounds (lb), milliliters (ml), and fluid ounces (fl oz). Some advanced models even offer conversions for specific ingredients like milk or oil.The user interface should allow easy switching between these units.

**Integrated Bluetooth Connectivity**

many modern digital food scales incorporate Bluetooth connectivity, allowing them to sync with smartphone apps.These apps can track nutritional information, save recipes, and provide real-time feedback on portion sizes. Data can be exported to common fitness apps such as Google Fit, Samsung Health and Apple Health. The best implementations will provide insights beyond simple measurements, such as macro breakdowns.

**Durable and Easy-to-Clean Design**

The scale's construction materials significantly impact its longevity and ease of maintenance. Look for scales with stainless steel or tempered glass platforms that are resistant to stains,scratches,and water damage. Removable platforms are also a plus, as they enable thorough cleaning and sanitation. The best designs minimize crevices were food particles can accumulate.

**User-Friendly LCD Display**

the display's clarity and readability are critical for effortless use. top-rated scales feature large, backlit LCD displays with high contrast, even in radiant or dimly lit environments.The display should show measurement units,battery level,and any active functions. The best displays offer adjustable brightness and viewing angles for optimal readability.

## Core benefits

Using a digital food scale brings benefits far beyond just knowing the weight of food. It is an essential tool for precision cooking, health tracking, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.**Improved Cooking and Baking Precision**

Digital food scales eliminate guesswork from cooking and baking. By providing accurate measurements of ingredients, these scales ensure consistent results and reduce the risk of recipe failures.This is especially crucial for baking, where precise ingredient ratios are essential for optimal texture and flavor.Measuring by weight is more accurate than measuring by volume.

**Enhanced Portion Control and Dietary Management**

For individuals focused on weight management or specific dietary requirements, digital food scales are invaluable. They facilitate precise portioning,allowing users to control their calorie intake and macronutrient ratios. Integrating with smartphone apps can also provide nutritional information and personalized recommendations based on individual health goals. over time, the accuracy will reduce calorie counting errors and make tracking food consumption easier.

**Increased Recipe Consistency**

Digital scales, when used properly, help to standardize and replicate recipes. Sharing recipes or repeating your successes becomes less prone to error. This standardization becomes especially useful in professional environments or homes where multiple people are cooking the same foods. Family cookbooks are more likely to be properly followed.

**Simplified Meal Prepping**

Meal prepping becomes more efficient using a digital scale because it becomes easier to accurately divide a batch of food into several portions. With accurate results, the user can be confident that meal prep containers have identical meals. This consistency is incredibly helpful for overall health.

**Reduced Food Waste**

Accurate measurement means less over-pouring, less cooking of excess food, and overall reduction of ingredients used. This helps the average household maintain a low carbon footprint due to a less wasteful lifestyle. It also translates directly into cost savings as food costs come down.

## FAQs Section

Many consumers have questions about the operation, function, and usefulness of a digital food scale. Here are some of the most common ones addressed directly.

**How do I calibrate a digital food scale?**
Most digital food scales have a built-in calibration function. Consult the user manual for specific instructions, but typically, this involves pressing a ""calibrate"" button and placing a known weight (e.g., a 500g calibration weight) on the platform. The scale will then automatically adjust its internal settings to ensure accurate measurements. Calibration should be done regularly,especially if the scale is frequently moved or subjected to significant temperature changes.

I'm absolutely wrecked from the past 2 days, getting various levels of drunk, throwing my voice out, raving like a fucktard and sharing my life story with a Brazilian MILF.

My body physically hasn't been letting me sleep, and thus my paranoia about having fatal insomnia encroaches. Is that just a symptom of sleep deprivation? Maybe. Do I just have N24? Yes. I need morphine.

Besides poisoning my body via all substances exogenous and endogenous, I also keep catching myself being a fat whore. I cannot keep my disgusting hands off breakfast and occasionally lunch. Maybe some other slop later in the evening. If only I relearned to drink coffee or an energy drink every time I get hungry, maybe I wouldn't have to whine about feeling fat or not passing, so that's probably what I'll do.

I'll probably rip a page out of an old sketchbook and make a physical tracker/calendar to stick on my closet. I did the math and with the plan I made I should lose about 10lbs in a month, which isn't as much as I'd like, but I'd rather be realistic than end up crashing, going backwards and gaining that amount. I'll also spam upper body exercises to balance out my physique and hope I don't end up nuking what little muscle I have by doing it on an ""extreme"" deficit. Maybe I'll have a protein shake on days I lift.

I have no idea what I even weigh at the moment. Probably 125lbs, possibly more. Ain't even unhealthy for my height but with my bodyfat percentage I look like chewed gum, and I don't trust myself to recomp without just getting even fatter, so cutting it is. Oh well.

In other news I should be up in about 5h to do housework for my mom's employer and make a couple bucks, but I have no idea how dead I may or may not be. She said she'd understand if I end up backing out but I'd still feel like an even more worthless neet than I already am.

In even other news, and on a positive note: turns out taking a non-sissy form of test actually fucking works. I'm growing actual facial hair, and what I have is darkening what feels like daily - observably so, even to me, with all my brainworms - to the point other people are pointing it out. I get the fleeting sense IGMI.

Pooners reading this, don't fucking use T gel. Save yourself the money and/or effort. Utter waste of time unless you're a hyperpresenter and have good absorption but for the other 99% of the population it's sugar water.

# The 3 Types of People Who Read This Post

Let‚Äôs break it down.

# 1. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Just Use Social Media‚Äù Person

Hey, I get it. Social is easy. It‚Äôs free. You can go viral.

But you know what else it is? **Unstable.**

Your IG could get hacked. Your TikTok could get banned.  
Your YouTube could demonetize you overnight.

Ask anyone who got big on Vine how they‚Äôre doing now.  
(Spoiler alert: they wish they had built a website.)

# 2. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôll Wait Until I Have a Big Idea‚Äù Person

Stop. That‚Äôs perfectionism disguised as fear.

Some of the most profitable websites started with the simplest ideas:

* One woman blogged about cooking with her grandma.
* One guy shared photography tips for cheap gear.
* One 20-year-old built a niche dropshipping store for dog socks.

Start ugly. Start now. Fix it later.

# 3. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Thought About It But Haven‚Äôt Pulled the Trigger‚Äù Person

Honestly? You‚Äôre the closest to winning.

You already *know* you should.

* Coaches and consultants who book calls directly through their site? $100/hour, minimum.
* Niche review sites or comparison blogs? Pure passive income if you set it up right.

None of that happens on Instagram. None of that happens on TikTok.  
**It happens on your website.**

And all of it starts with hosting. Which is why‚Ä¶

# My Personal Experience with Neuroactiv6: A Comprehensive Review

When I first heard about Neuroactiv6, I was skeptical. The claims about improved cognitive function, enhanced mental clarity, and boosted energy levels seemed almost too good to be true. But after doing some research and reading about its all-natural ingredients, I decided to give it a try‚Äîand I‚Äôm so glad I did. Here‚Äôs my honest and detailed review of how Neuroactiv6 has impacted my life.

# Why I Decided to Try Neuroactiv6

As someone juggling a demanding job, family responsibilities, and a side hustle, I often felt drained, both mentally and physically. Brain fog was a constant companion, making it difficult to focus and stay productive. I wanted a natural solution to help me feel more energized and mentally sharp without resorting to caffeine overload or synthetic stimulants.

After stumbling upon Neuroactiv6, I was intrigued by its focus on brain health and energy enhancement. Its list of ingredients, including NeuroFactor, ashwagandha, and turmeric, stood out to me because they are well-known for their health benefits. The product also boasts being non-GMO, gluten-free, and backed by scientific research, which gave me confidence in its safety and effectiveness.

# My First Impression

The first thing I noticed about Neuroactiv6 was its convenience. It comes in a powdered form that‚Äôs easy to mix with water or your favorite smoothie. The taste is pleasantly fruity with a slight herbal undertone, which I found refreshing. Unlike other health supplements that can taste overly artificial or medicinal, Neuroactiv6 was genuinely enjoyable.

# The Key Benefits I Experienced

# ‚úÖ Improved Focus and Mental Clarity

Within the first week, I noticed a significant improvement in my ability to focus. Tasks that usually felt overwhelming became more manageable, and I found myself completing projects faster and with greater accuracy.

# ‚úÖ Sustained Energy Levels

Unlike the jittery boost I‚Äôd get from coffee, Neuroactiv6 provided a smooth and steady energy that kept me going without any afternoon crashes.

# ‚úÖ Enhanced Mood

Thanks to ashwagandha, I felt more balanced, optimistic, and resilient under stress.

# ‚úÖ Better Sleep Quality

Improved daytime balance translated to deeper, more restful sleep at night.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

* **NeuroFactor**: Boosts BDNF for cognitive support
* **Ashwagandha**: Reduces stress and improves mood
* **Turmeric**: Supports inflammation control
* **Green Tea Extract**: Provides clean energy
* **Blueberry Powder**: Antioxidant-rich memory support
* **Vitamin C**: Supports immunity and stress recovery

# Ease of Use and Long-Term Effects

One scoop mixed with water in the morning became a game-changer. After 3 months, I‚Äôve seen lasting improvements in memory, focus, creativity, and overall productivity.

# A Few Things to Consider

Results may vary. It works best when paired with healthy habits. The fruity flavor is pleasant but can be blended if preferred.

# Final Thoughts

Neuroactiv6 has truly been a game-changer for me. From enhanced focus and steady energy to better sleep and mood ‚Äî it exceeded my expectations.

1m0367x,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m0367x/the_quiet_house_on_witch_hazel_lane/,The Quiet House on Witch Hazel Lane,"An odd serenity often lingers in the air in the wake of violence. Morbid as it may be, I have always found a sort of peace in the various ambient sounds present at such scenes and learned to appreciate the poetic absurdity of their persistence. The sound of a trickling faucet left running by a woman now dead on the kitchen floor, the hollow tones of a wind chime hung from a rafter just as its owner had done to himself, near flawless juxtapositions that might have drawn the envy of the Old Masters themselves had they witnessed them. Fittingly, just as an artist might use different shades for aesthetic means, they are not only useful for that purpose but can be used to tell a story, to draw focus to an overarching theme that could not be easily gleaned without their consideration.

Of the countless scenes I have been called to over the years, there was one where this rule did not apply.

My phone rang around 11:40 pm that night. Sergeant Jim Nichols had been flagged down by a group of three shaken boys who reported that they had found a body in the abandoned house at 215 Witch Hazel Lane. The youngest of the three had been dared to go into the residence and wave at the remaining two from a second-story window. Once on the second floor, he found the body and ran down to tell his pals. The boys were taken to the station, and their parents were called in order to obtain statements while Nichols and three others went to the address where they found a decomposing body in one of the second-story closets.¬†

Hanging up the phone, I rubbed the sleep from my eyes and put on a pot of coffee while I dressed for what would likely be a long night.¬†

The gravel drive was fairly short, but it wound through the trees in such a manner that it seemed much longer than it was. At the end rose a decrepit, two-story home that had long since been abandoned. It was surrounded by ancient oaks constricted by vines, which intertwined, obstructing any view of the property from beyond the perimeter. The front of the structure was fitted with a sagging and rotten porch whose roof bore many of the same qualities, while unintelligible graffiti adorned the exterior in places, accentuating the chipping paint, broken windows, and all other derelict qualities of the once beautiful home. The only sources of illumination that night were emitted from the headlights and rotating blues of the patrol cars, which had carried Nichols and the others to the scene earlier that evening.

I exited my car, placing my flashlight in the back pocket of my pants, and hung my camera around my neck before approaching the trio. The two younger officers, Haley and Rogers, appeared a bit shaken, which was to be expected. It was the unease I detected on Nichols' grizzled face that gave me some concern. Jim was a seasoned veteran who had responded to some of the more gruesome scenes I had been a part of and never showed an iota of trepidation. Telling the others to remain at the cars, Jim motioned for me to follow him to the front of the residence as he glanced at the half-open front door.¬†

""Something's not right here, Teddy..."" he said once we were out of earshot of the patrolmen.

""Foul play?"" I asked.

""Dunno... It's something about this place. It's like it plays tricks with you.""

I let out a breathy chuckle. ""Halloween was two weeks ago, Jim. Maybe it's a case of residual spooks?""

He didn't laugh.

""I'm not playin' around here, Teddy. Something's off. Not sure how to explain it, but..."" he trailed off, seeming to try and form a coherent explanation.

Confusion and concern were what I was feeling in the moment, but the combination of the two states must have manifested in an impatient or mocking expression.

""... You think this is fuckin' funny?"" Jim snapped.

""Easy... Alright, I'll cut the shit."" I said, raising my hands in surrender. I nodded to the door.¬†

""Let's take a look.""

Removing the flashlight from my pocket, I clicked it on and trained the amber beam at the doorway and began to make my way towards it, Jim hesitantly trailing behind.

I didn't expect there to be any overt noises in such a house given its abandoned state, but one would imagine the sounds of creaking floors or rafters, or the faint sounds of rats clawing about in the walls, but there was nothing. Once I crossed the threshold, the sounds of the officer's radios and the persistent chirping of crickets ceased as though the door had been closed behind me. I looked back to see Jim standing on the front porch just on the other side of the open door, trying and failing to mask his dread. I shot him a quick smile and motioned with my head for him to come in. After a moment and a deep breath, he joined me in the silence.

It was an oppressive quietness. My ears were popping and began to ring as I stepped further into the foyer. If I hadn't seen Jim step in behind me, I would not have known he was there. We stood still a moment while I listened intently for anything, but the only new sound I detected was the faint thumping of my heart and the unsettling whooshing noise of the blood it was pushing through my veins with progressive intensity.

""See what I mean?"" came what seemed like a whisper from behind me.

Jim moved to my side as we looked around.

""Is this place sound proofed?"" I asked, half startled by the volume of my own voice resonating in my skull.

""Not that I can tell. Even if it were, you'd think those broken windows would let somethin' in.""

I moved my light towards the windows in the adjoined living room to see nearly all of them had been shattered at one point or another.

""This isn't even half of it..."" he said, pointing his light to the wooden staircase ahead.

Wondering what could possibly be stranger than the silence, I made my way to the staircase and began my absurdly quiet ascent. The stairs were old but mostly intact. I could feel the old boards flexing under my weight, but there was no groaning of wood against wood. I stopped halfway up the stairs upon noticing the absence of something else.

""Didn't you say the body was in decomp?"" I asked.

""What?"" Jim responded in what seemed like a whisper.

I turned to face him ""Decomp. Didn't you say the body was in decomp? I don't smell shit.""

""Yeah, noticed that too.""

Once on the second-floor landing, I moved my light to the left down the hallway to see several doors in varying states of openness and a few small piles of refuse left by trespassers. Looking to the right, I saw it several feet from the top of the stairs -- leaning against the wall in a sitting position was the subject of my being in that strange home.¬†

The skin had begun to turn a brownish black, the hair on its head was sloughing off, and it wasn't as bloated as I thought it should be. Although its features were not very evident, I could tell by its lack of clothing that it was most definitely the body of a male. I set my flashlight on the banister, ensuring the beam remained trained on the body, raised my camera, and snapped a photo of the gruesome scene.

I saw Jim's light coalesce with mine, and I turned to ask a question.

""Fuck me..."" he said, all of the color drained from his face.

I looked at the body, then back to Jim.

""You told me on the phone that he was in a closet,"" I said in a near-scolding tone.

He stood silent, his light and eyes trained on the rotting corpse.

""Jim, if you're about to tell me --""

""It was, Ted. It fucking was.""

""Was? What do you mean it 'was'?""

""I mean it was in the closet two doors down on the left from the stairs when I last fuckin' saw it..."" he said, panic now rising in his voice.

I shined my light to the left to see the closet door standing open. Scanning the dirty, wooden floor between it and the body, I saw a damp trail leading between the two. I drew my pistol.

""Jim, did you and your boys clear th ‚Äì""

""-- Yes we cleared the fuckin' house, Teddy! No one's here and no one's come in.""

""Unless one of you moved it, we have someone else in here!"" I snapped, now scanning each doorway for movement.

Jim pulled the radio from his belt and tried to call Haley.

‚ÄúRadio‚Äôs not getting out, Ted.‚Äù

""I'll hold here. You go get the others and clear the first floor. Meet me back here once you're done."" I said without looking, Jim's light moving from the body being the only confirmation that he had heard me.

""Get a few other units out here to set up a perimeter, too!"" I yelled with a deafening resonance. I wasn't sure he had heard me, but I didn't want to turn and check.

I had been in hairy situations before, but this was most definitely the strangest. I scanned left and right again, half expecting to see a head poking out from one of the rooms. Sensing that I needed to calm down, I took a few deep breaths and moved my light back to the corpse. I knew that I had a few minutes before the three patrolmen cleared the first floor and made it back to me, so I decided to use that time to try and deduce the location of our intruder.¬†

Looking at the floor in front of each doorway, I couldn't see any sign of recent disturbance save for the boot prints from the patrolmen's boots and damp drag marks consisting of a reddish-yellow fluid. Surprisingly, the second-story windows were mostly intact, with a few sporting various cracks and chips from decades of neglect. All of them were closed, however, and appeared to have been so for some time, given the cob webs and dust built up around the edges. Unless there was a way off the second story from inside one of the rooms, someone had to be up there with me.¬†

I looked at the body, specifically the arms and legs. If someone had drug it from its previous location, the desiccated skin would be torn by the pressure, but from my position, I couldn't tell if that were the case. From what I could see, there wasn't a rug, blanket, or any other item that could have been used to pull it along the floor either. The cadaver was sitting on the floor with nothing underneath it, rotting flesh to hardwood.

Minutes passed as I stood at the top of the stairs. The relatively light weight of my pistol and light seemed to increase as my arms and shoulders began to tire. I couldn't hear where the patrolmen were in the house or if they were inside at all. Despite how scared he may have been, I knew Jim would be back inside as quickly as he could. It was the younger men I feared might refuse to come back inside if they knew what had transpired.

¬†

I glanced at my watch, and another three minutes had passed. The thought crossed my mind that the sicko had made it down to the first floor at some point, and Jim and his men needed help.

Checking both ends of the hallway one last time, I backed down the stairs, keeping an eye on the landing. Still no noise. I took each step carefully as not to fall, keeping one foot planted firm on one step and sliding the other down to the next. I kept waiting to hear the sounds of a scuffle or gunshots, but heard nothing but my heart pounding in my ears. I took a few more steps, feeling that I should be close to the bottom, and turned my head to look behind me. Jim and the other two officers stood at the bottom of the stairs, guns and lights in hand.

""Jesus!"" I exclaimed, startled by their appearance behind me. ""Where the fuck have you been?""

""We found some more rooms towards the back here that we hadn't checked yet. Took us a bit longer. Any signs up there?""

""Nah, no signs. It was just me and John-fucking-Doe up there catching up. Let's go clear the second floor."" I said, more than a bit agitated.

The four of us made our way back up the stairs, with me on point. With backup behind me, I felt a bit braver and took the steps much quicker than I had before. I had hoped that by my leaving and the absence of the noise of our return, we would catch the bastard trying to move.¬†

Approaching the final steps before coming back into view of the body, I slowed my pace, steadied my breath, and prepared for a fight. I felt a hand on my shoulder, reassuring me I wouldn't be in it alone. As my head broke the threshold, I shined my light into the hallway.

The corpse was gone.

""Fuck!"" I exclaimed, rushing onto the landing, looking down both ends of the hallway.

All at once, sound returned like a tidal wave. Footsteps sounded like thunder, and the creaking of the floorboards sounded as though the house was about to give way. I looked back to see Jim and the other officers now on the landing and shining their lights wildly around the hall.

‚ÄúWhere the fuck did it‚Ä¶‚Äù Jim began, but started to gag at the overwhelming stench of death that suddenly filled the air.

‚ÄúHoly shit!‚Äù Rogers said, burying his nose in the crook of his arm.

‚ÄúJim you and Rogers take left, Haley, you‚Äôre with me‚Äù I said, stifling a gag, then began to move.

My light shone on the puddle of fluid pooled on the floor where the corpse was last. As I got closer, my beam caught the glimmer of another putrid trail of brown-streaked, yellow ichor leading underneath a closed door at the end of the hall.

‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù I called.

Stepping towards the door, I checked the knob. It was locked, but it was covered with something viscous. I pulled my hand back to see the same noxious fluid covering my hand. Bile rose in my throat as I frantically wiped my hand on my pants.

‚ÄúPolice! Open up!‚Äù Jim ordered as he pushed past me.

We stood for a moment, listening for any movement. Nothing.

Jim stepped back and, with practiced motion, kicked the door open, and the three uniformed officers flooded the room with me at their tail. Amber beams of light shone all around the empty bedroom as we searched every square inch.

‚ÄúIn here!‚Äù Jim called out from the closet at the other side of the room.

Looking at the floor as I moved, I saw where the trail veered from the bedroom door and through the now open closet door. As I reached the threshold, I saw lights fixed once again on the rotting body sitting at the back wall.

Sirens and the sounds of tires on gravel heralded our reinforcements' arrival. Jim‚Äôs radio must have started working again since I heard him giving orders for the responding officers to begin a sweep of the area. I checked and double-checked the windows in the room to find them closed and covered with dust and cobwebs. They hadn‚Äôt been opened in years.¬†

We searched the house over and over, looking for any trap doors, hidden rooms, or exits, and we found nothing. There was no evidence of any crime having been committed there either‚Äîjust bits of trash and broken furniture from years gone by. The exterior search uncovered nothing as well. I was confused, angry, and horrified all at the same time. I felt sick.

This was last night, and I haven‚Äôt slept because I still smell that damn body. My clothes are in a garbage bag on my back porch, and I‚Äôve taken three showers since I got home. The stench must be burned into my nose.¬†

The morgue has called my phone twelve times in the past twenty minutes, but I haven‚Äôt answered. The smell has started to go away and it‚Äôs gotten very quiet in my house, so I have a feeling of what they may have to say.",3,1752538529.0,creepcast,0,0.8,False

1m0356y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m0356y,Latvian Redemption? Nope.,"Hi folks!

Some may recall my scathing review of a Latvain ration, menu 5, a few weeks ago.

I promised to give Latvia another chance, and so what we have here is a Latvian ration, Menu 8, with a best by date of Feb2027. This is a nice fresh ration....but it didn't matter. It was not redeemed.

Were there elements here better than menu 5, sure. But not enough to save it. 

Pic 1 shows the main dish, stewed cabbage with ham. The cabbage is indistinguishable,  could not find barely any ham, and the title doesn't even include the word ""potato"", but there are more of them than anything else. This is a very strongly flavored dish, it is not bland at all. That being said, you better like the flavor or you are going to have a hard time with this one. The texture is more ""mush"" than I would have liked too. There is no comparison here to Polish Bigos or the Czech Dumplings with cabbage and bacon, both are far superior in my humble opinion. 

Pics 2-4 show packaging and contents. Noteable items missing, again, a cold beverage base, and a non-wooden spoon. No isotonic, but here's 3 packs of coffee and 40 grams of sugar for a single meal! US coffee, when you get it, usually gives 4-5 grams per cup, so this amount, based on there being 4 beverages (3 coffees and a tea), is double that amount of sugar. That just seems insane to me. Give those calories and that weight in the form of an isotonic beverage base.

Pic 5 shows the neat little hand sanitizer thingy! Just snap and squeeze! Worked like a charm!

Pic 6 shows a coffee with 5 grams of sugar in a 1/2 cup of skim milk,  served cold, which is how I like it! I will say, those Nescafe Classics are very good. 

Pic 7 shows the rye bread, each topped with a different jam. The left slice has Spanish apricot jam and the right one has French apricot jam. The Spanish was superior in my opinion. Tasted more natural and had more fruity bits in it. This bread is just not for me. I really struggled to eat this again, I just don't like it. The chocolate is not nearly as sweet as other ration chocolate but has a very nice ""mouth feel"" and melts very well in the mouth too. 

Pic 8 shows a tiny sliver of redemption. Instead of the plain roasted beans, the roasted beans were covered in a sugar glaze. This definitely helped things out ALOT, but they are just so dry and flavorless in general. Keep the extra 20 grams of sugar and give us some glazed peanuts! The cranberries were great,  even better than US cranberries. I mixed them together and that is how I ate them all over a few days. 

Pic 9 was another win, the Turbo Gum! Look at that Bazooka Gum looking thing, minus the food coloring! This was vanilla flavored, I think, and actually quite good. That cool trading card like paper is fantastic too! I could totally see Platoons seeking out entire collections of those! Pretty neat!

In conclusion, this ration just failed to impress me enough to claim redemption. The only ration I've  had that I disliked more than these Latvian was the Singaporean one I reviewed. I am blessed to have had this ration, and even though I did not enjoy it from a culinary standpoint,  I enjoyed the experience of eating and documenting it on here just as much as any other! I love the fact that some people realky like these as it's a testament to the diversity of our community and our preferences!

I have one more Latvian left, and would be open to trades for another foreign ration ;)!

I'm not that person anymore. I used religion to avoid parts of myself I was ashamed of. The morning pages feels way too close to that kind of routine. I'm more spiritual now so the ""creator"" or ""god"" in TAW doesn't bother me because I can make that whatever I want it to be in my head. But the practice of morning pages stresses me out. 

Would it be wrong to do it in the evenings at first? Or should I be confronting this and doing it in the mornings anyway? Has anyone else dealt with this? I only ask because the contract at the beginning says it might trigger things.

Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî crossing the 50 mark comes with some surprises. Your knees suddenly make a sound when you stand up, and you can‚Äôt eat spicy food after 7 p.m. without needing a prayer and a Pepcid.



But here‚Äôs the flip side: it‚Äôs also a chance to live smarter, clearer, and more confidently. Here are **20 real-life changes** that helped me feel more in control and content in my 50s and beyond.

1. Let Go of Things That Don‚Äôt Serve You

This isn‚Äôt just about clutter (though we‚Äôll get to that). I‚Äôm talking about that friend who always complains, or the committee you joined 10 years ago that still drains your weekends. If it‚Äôs no longer bringing value or joy, it‚Äôs time to politely bow out. Reclaim your peace.



2. Declutter Your Home (and Mind)

Clutter creates stress. Start small ‚Äî a drawer, a shelf, a closet. Donate things you haven‚Äôt touched in years. Or do like me and sell items at the flea market to earn some extra cash. You‚Äôll not only clear space, but you‚Äôll feel mentally lighter. And trust me, your future self will thank you when you don‚Äôt trip over a pile of mystery cords.



3. Embrace a Healthy Lifestyle

Now‚Äôs the time to eat more whole foods, get enough sleep, and move your body with kindness. You don‚Äôt have to go full gym rat. Try walks after dinner, stretching in the morning, or YouTube workouts for over-50s. Think progress, not perfection.



4. Keep Learning

New skills keep the brain sharp. Take a free online class. Read books that challenge you. Ask your grandkids to teach you the latest app (they‚Äôll love it). Lifelong learning adds confidence and keeps you connected to the world.



5. Be Okay Saying ‚ÄúNo‚Äù

Guilt-free, unapologetic ‚Äúno‚Äù is a superpower at this age. Say no to things that drain you. Say yes only to what brings peace, joy, or purpose. No explanations needed.



6. Create a Morning Routine

You don‚Äôt need a rigid hour-long plan. Just something that starts your day with calm and focus. A hot shower, a devotional, a short walk, or even just sipping coffee in silence before anyone talks to you. Set the tone early, before the day pulls you in.



7. Start Journaling

You don‚Äôt have to be a writer. Just jot down a few thoughts each day ‚Äî what made you smile, what‚Äôs bothering you, what you‚Äôre praying for. It‚Äôs healing, and you‚Äôll create a record of your [journey](https://lifeafterfiftyish.com/moms-lifetime-memory-journal-keepsake-for-lifes-moments/), especially meaningful for your kids and grandkids one day.



8. Tidy Up Your Finances

This might mean making a simple budget, canceling subscriptions you forgot about, or meeting with a financial advisor to plan retirement. Financial peace brings real-life peace. It‚Äôs never too late to get organized.



9. Move That Body

Don‚Äôt get stuck on what you *can‚Äôt* do ‚Äî celebrate what you *can*. Swim, garden, walk your dog, dance while cooking. Moving your body increases energy, boosts mood, and helps your joints stay limber. Plus, it just feels good.



10. Schedule Regular Checkups

No skipping the[ mammograms](https://lifeafterfiftyish.com/5-tips-for-women-nervous-about-their-mammogram-screening/), [colonoscopies](https://lifeafterfiftyish.com/colonoscopy-tips-to-make-your-prep-more-bearable/), or eye exams. Prevention is key. Keep a health notebook or use a phone app to track appointments and test results. Be your own best advocate.



11. Drink More Water

So simple, but so powerful. Staying hydrated helps with energy, digestion, skin, and even joint health. Keep a water bottle nearby and refill throughout the day. If plain water is boring, add lemon or cucumber.



12. Revamp Your Wardrobe

Donate what doesn‚Äôt fit or flatter. Invest in a few pieces that make you feel good. You deserve to look in the mirror and smile. Comfort and style are not enemies ‚Äî linen pants, flowy tops, and a great-fitting pair of jeans can work wonders.



13. Use Technology to Stay Connected

Video chat with grandkids. Join a Facebook group. Try a new app (yes, you can!). Technology can help us feel less isolated, especially when used with purpose. Ask for help setting things up ‚Äî there‚Äôs no shame in learning something new.



14. Pick Up a Side Hustle (if You Want!)

If you‚Äôve got a hobby, talent, or interest ‚Äî monetize it! Sell crafts, do online surveys, write, tutor, or flip yard sale finds. Even a few extra bucks a week adds up, and it‚Äôs empowering to know you still got it!



15. Surround Yourself with Positive People

Time is precious. Spend it with people who uplift you, not those who drain or belittle you. Find or create a circle that laughs, supports, and grows together. Even one good friend makes a difference.



16. Get Outside More

Nature is therapy. Even 10 minutes of sunshine or a walk around the block can lower stress. Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of fresh air and birdsong ‚Äî especially on those days when the walls feel like they‚Äôre closing in.



17. Organize Important Documents

Create a folder (physical or digital) with things like medical records, insurance info, wills, passwords, and contacts. It brings peace of mind now and helps your loved ones in the future. Label it clearly and let someone you trust know where it is.



18. Try Something New Every Month

New doesn‚Äôt have to mean skydiving or selling everything to live in a van (unless that‚Äôs your thing). Sometimes ‚Äúnew‚Äù is simple ‚Äî trying a different recipe, walking a new trail, or exploring a nearby town you‚Äôve never really paid attention to.

Personally, I love bargain shopping, especially clearance racks. I‚Äôve been known to hop in the car and head to a different city just to see what their stores had on sale. It turned into a little adventure ‚Äî a change of scenery, some peaceful solo time, and the thrill of a good deal. Like a treasure hunt, only with snacks and air conditioning.



19. Practice Gratitude

Start or end your day with three things you‚Äôre grateful for. Write them down, speak to them out loud, or share them with someone. Gratitude doesn‚Äôt erase the hard stuff ‚Äî but it helps highlight the good.



20. Dream Big ‚Äî Even Now

Don‚Äôt let the number stop you. Want to travel? Start a podcast? Open a shop? Do it scared. This season of life is still fertile ground for big dreams. Age doesn‚Äôt cancel out purpose.

You‚Äôre Just Getting Started

These aren‚Äôt about overhauling your life overnight. Start with one or two. Build slowly. You‚Äôre not behind, and it‚Äôs never too late to make things better, brighter, or more meaningful.

1m031sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1m031sx/out_of_the_river/,Out of the River,"The morning was brighter than most and it consisted of more bodies than last time... life came from the light... the light in the water... the light in the rivers.

""Good Morning Shreveport! Red River is showing more signs of life and its becoming sexier than usual. Marilyn Monroe and Brad Pitt types are more muscular out of the old red and we think its vitamins in the land and we want to tell you about the vitamins we recommend for yourself and your new lovers."" - Tim Johnson at KTBS reported while talking to his Co-reporter Kelly Benson.

""You know Tim, Older women like myself like to see a real man come out of a real tough situation. But what about dating a Man you don't have any historical record of no matter if his diet consists of vitamins and rock hard abs?""

The news was getting more ridiculous day by day since last year this time, October 30th 2029. I know you must be receiving this 2022-2025ish. I don't know how these things work with time travel, cloning and alternate universes with alternate internet connections (its a strange connection but stay with me, I think I am tapped in now). But I am going to try my best and not sound too wild, otherwise it might happen here too. It followed me last time, I think I got rid of it.

That News Report is the last broadcast I remember from my universe. Tim and Kelly were my favorite, wacky and fun. Local humor and perfect breakfast material. But you are not here to hear my day to day, however I am here to tell you something of a warning and its my fault. Forgive me.

Like I said the first report was October 2029, But before you ask...No I can not tell you who was president because Donald Trump, Obama and George Bush never were president in our history. I think the shift was in JFK because he was never even close to being in DALLAS that day in our history. The Twin Towers are still up in my world and we used major nuclear weapons 5 times in our past eliminating dangerous enemies (that was what I was taught, forgive me I will not go into detail we were different than you.) Our Technology is Nuclear and our most popular Music has been Bilingual for two-three decades (Spanish and English).

Enough about me, right? Right, well this is where I am going to start and if you get lost or feel like I am leaving something out because our cultures and life is different, forgive me. I will try to answer into further detail.

OCTOBER 2029, I was running some errands for my boss by the Red River. I was driving an eighteen wheeler logging truck. I was on the job for a year or so. The company I worked for used a bunch of equipment to transport from the river itself, the river in my world is three times as large and is a major trading post. It was about 0500 in the morning (my shift started at 0300 then ended at 1200),  it was my time to get off the logging truck and get to the docks and help the other guys load the rest of the trucks for the morning crew. We were busier than usual that month and I did not need any distractions. But distractions came and they came hard (no pun intended). At about 0520,  a bright light came from the river next to the dock we worked with the crane and rope. Out of the bright light were bodies, beautiful people that most of our of Spanish speaking crew thought were angels. Naked and now swimming, my friend and coworker Alex kept on exclaiming verbal utters ""Santa Maria, Madre de Dios!"" and others whispered. The chattering quieted as they walked to us and asked us to clothe them. Myself and D'andre (an older black gentleman that has been my mentor and one of the bosses favorites) tried asking the three women where they came from. D'andre and I were not convinced in magic or miracles. The women were silent for many minutes, as if they could not commute with us out of sin or authority. So we called the police and the boss (Hector Alba). The police could barely understand them, like us. The ""Angels"" sounded like they had a German and British Accent, it was strange but alluring.

At about 0645, the morning trucking crew had just started coming in to see the sight of now clothed yet shivering angelic women leaving with the police. It was all over the news, theories of this and that. It was not hidden and it could not be even if anyone tried.

""Traversed here-there and compelled to believe I could understand where I am and where I was is a simple way to put it."" -Man in Purple and Red Suit

The next day was of course, Halloween. The first Man appeared, this time near the city next to the boardwalk and casinos. Dude was stark naked and freaked out some little old ladies walking their dogs at about 7 in the morning. Our Shreveport doesn't have a bunch of crime like yours, its nothing to brag about. Some other travelers blame it on certain events in history. I don't like to compare histories because it is very controversial for your understanding and my goal is not to offend anyone or make you get distracted for what is happening.

The Man in Purple and Red was named Jerry or Jerrick or something. But for memory's sake I am going to call the guy ""Jay"". Jay was on the news not but 24 hours later. It was early November and I was just cleaning about an egging/toilet papering of my elderly neighbors home on my day off. It always happened to her yard around this holiday because she looked like a witch and had a few black cats. However she was the best and sweetest little lady I have ever known, mother 13 children and raised 21. Everyone of her kids visited her for thanksgiving, Christmas and her birthday (but that was only it really). Agatha was her name and she carried her GreenGlass Floating Tablet everywhere with her (she loved the news and gossip). As she was watching the translucent GreenGlass she looked through it asking me if I could rake the leaves while I was at it, I did of course because she deserves more love than any little old lady in this neighborhood of ours.

I got done cleaning up, to only show up on Agatha's Kitchen table. Which was tradition for the last twelve years I have been here. Hot Coffee whispered on the percolator, eggs fried with bacon and toast aside in a slow cook in the toaster oven. All this breakfast food was prepared as she stared through the GreenGlass adding seasoning and following side instructions for a certain omelette recipe she also had on the side. The voice thru the GreenGlass tablet however was the interviewer asking Jay if he celebrated Halloween and what he was doing for the holidays. A few minutes past, Carefully but with precision Agatha set our breakfast before us. Through the GreenGlass we discussed the topic... I miss Agatha, I miss those moments more than ever now. I wonder who will clean up the eggs and toilet paper.

Then it was the Middle of November, I was at work again. Same Docks, Around the Same time and about the same crew I was working with before. But this time when the bright light appeared, my coworkers did not shout religious gold and excitement. 12 men and 3 women came from the light, all butt naked. Different shapes, colors and sizes and not nearly as good looking as the angelic women or Jay the dog park flasher (which was his nickname by the crew). All the men were military like and the women were the same, muscles and built like bodybuilders on the juice. This time though, we had a military presence ourselves. I guess when the angelic women had many interviews they explained that there would be more people ""passing thru or flashing thru"". Each one of the three were stunning and interesting, they made world news wild and conflicting. It was all very distracting for me and I was not someone who enjoyed the reality they were explaining or where they came from, I was annoyed that there was an alternate universe ruled by the English, Germans, Spanish, and Chinese with a space age race for inter-dimensional travel . But that is why I do not explain where I am from either, it is annoying to know how things can work out in favor and against favor towards your beliefs and rights. So I ignored the beast at my doorstep until it was apparent I could not.

The military presence was increased over the last week. Each day brought new toys of destruction, a tank and many armor cars showed up the day before the 15 blinded us. A school bus with clothing racks showed up a few days prior, it was a rusty pink stranger danger color... it was parked between three jungle green jeeps. The crew and I called the bus ""Victim Meat"", the joke that made it that name was some dark humor about the military dressing drag (I forgot the joke but if I remember I might tell it). Jokes on us, the 15 skinny dippers were escorted to the bus and about the whole platoon except 1 jeep and a black SUV remained.

Now this is where things get weird, if they weren't already right? After this batch of swimmers, some men in black suits started asking us questions after each shift. I think it was the dudes from the SUV, FBI types/secret service. Questions were like ""Are you waiting at the docks for someone special?"" ""Do you know or want to know how they appear thru the light?"" ""What have you seen that you think we have not?"" ""Are you working with anyone near this area that can help us, help you?"" (I always thought that was one of the weirder questions.). I guess the government at the time did not want to intervene in a way that could make our newcomers feel unwelcome. Some part of me thought I was going to lose my job to some kid that wanted to play Dock and Crane. But I think the military and government had other things in mind.

December 12th, 2029. This is a date, I do not think I will forget. I was sure that the strange was just not a part of my life anymore. The river people (which was what the locals called the newcomers) were becoming less interesting day by day. They were big braggers and like to inform us how intelligent they were. Some of them even gave out advice on supplements, health, medicine and exercise routines. All great and dandy but not anything that really butters my toast and dips it in my coffee. In fact, that was the problem... I had run out of coffee that day and I was in a rush to get to work because I lived across town. I was on the bridge (which does not exist in your world, damn the sunrises and sunsets were bad ass on there...miss it.)

Anyways, I got distracted thinking about some things and that bridge. That day was crazy bright, I thought the lumber yard I worked at was on fire. I was stuck in traffic on the bridge, it was construction and now it was distraction. 58 people swam from the river to the dock shores, ""40 women absolutely heaven sent and 18 men that looked like they would steal your mothers and your daughters just by looks""(at least that is what a local podcast said about the event). Police and Military were short this time around, I could see from the bridge that I was not going to work today. I called the boss and he said ""I know, I am here and you missed it."" He poked and joked that I always miss the best ones when it comes to "" you should've been there"".

The world was interviewing everyone of them. Especially these five women from this group. Esther, Echo, Ivy, Reno and Emily. I think the group was called EERIE or some people called them the five most alive because they spoke out the most. All the ladies were scientists and engineers or both.y

I will be honest EERIE was something else, it was like your spice girls but smart and informative plus super dreamy. Anyways to keep it short and to not drag on. From then on out every two weeks 50-60 people would appear. Yes I'd still be required to go to work. The crew and I became kinda local legends, some people we normally regular at lunch or after work would joke that we were inter-dimensional players and just trying to keep all the other worldly hotties to ourselves. I miss those kinds of jokes and laughs. It is really stupid to think about but I guess it plays into my heartache.

September 11th, 2030. I know this is an important day for you here. It is terrible that that has happened here. My instance is different, I met a girl three months ago and proposed to her that day. She was a sister triplet clone of Echo from EERIE, it's a weird gene thing and test tube baby thing (too syfy for me too). Anyways I totally fell in love like a total tool for her. I clothed her on her day of arrival and she spoke to me first and we just never stopped talking. I have clothed many people since, probably well over 200. If I had to guess the immigration is probably in the 2000s, so look at me clothing 10%. I did get a pay raise for this, do not ask me how. Life was looking up, I was definitely happy.

I think you know where this is going, If not let me make it as simple as I can. I am an easy man and I simply fell in love. She wanted to go back to her world and I was willing to find out how. Except the magic to make that happen and the people I got involved with had different ideas. I am here now. I am going to try to remember what was said. I need to get back. Maybe there is clues, maybe you can help me. If its with her or going home. I don't know anymore, I don't want to ramble. I got to go though, I have a new job. It gives me time to think about the conversations I've had. The things I had to do, the things we did, and the difference we thought we'd make. There is so much to unload.

1m0304f,https://i.redd.it/f7ql0kvfjxcf1.jpeg,Hear me out: Female homelessness in Auckland.,"A few months ago, I decided to adventure into our brave and vast world from the comfort of my consultatory above the hills. Over time, being focused on caring for my local community in my capacity as an academic therapist isolated me from the challenging endeavours beyond my clinic. 

Years of study and pursuit of understanding come with the damages of isolation and 'out-of-touch' with the transmuting realities around me. Enough of this; I've settled for occasional weekdays (to mingle among my peers) every week to visit the heart of Auckland and occasionally randomly engage with the local community. 

In the first week, I've invited a few homeless men for a cup of coffee, for the passive displeasure from the caf√© workers; the following week: I decided to pay for four road workers during their breaks to accompany me into the Auckland Art Gallery for the Modernist Exposition while taking the time to educate each about the works of great master ‚éØ. I was there when one wept while facing a Van Gogh and remembering his departed father. During weeks three and four, i've left gifts and books around Auckland CBD, a project that so want to take further; this early morning I encountered a lovely group of elderly ladies from a Retirement home walking around the Winter gardens at Auckland domain and without exhitation, I crossed the road to purchase eight teas and milk. We had a high-tea party at the bottom of the fernery for a few minutes. 

Now, as I'm seated in a local caf√© in the CBD, I magically locked eye contact with a homeless lady and her dog, the boy inside of me cried, as she walked away living the limiting beauty of her actions and existence, I felt powerless, empty, somehow hating my potential that profited in nothing, at least nothing to help that woman, so here is my attempt of self-redemption, an instigation of the mind, my social responsibility as a person with a human heart, to use this channel and express my moral demise, and to say that ai want to explicitly do something about female homelessness for a particular reason: Because it is much harder. 

To start, women experiencing homelessness often face higher risks of violence, sexual assault, emotional abuse and exploitation. These threats are constant. Many women become homeless as a direct result of domestic violence, and the trauma doesn‚Äôt end once they lose their housing. This ongoing vulnerability makes their situation not just different, but often more dangerous and traumatic.

On top of that, women have specific health and hygiene needs‚Äîlike access to menstrual products, private and safe places to wash, and reproductive healthcare‚Äîthat are rarely prioritised in homeless services. Access to these essentials can lead to serious health issues and further marginalisation.

 If you know or have an idea for an initiative, I want in; it doesn't matter what it takes. While I cannot fully concentrate on ending social dilemmas, I believe that private contributions and willingness can make a difference. 

Keep me posted, folks, and stay blessed out there.",0,1752538064.0,auckland,38,0.3,False

I started talking to a guy online about 4 months ago it was a dm via instagram. He seemed normal enough. We agreed to meet in person after 4 months of video calls and talking about life, business, goals, family, challenges and personal contexts. he had a abnormality that was large on his face like a big birthmark, I found it endearing. he never raised it. I just once said is that a birthmark and he confirmed, I smiled and said 'its cool!' like it'.

My gut told me to cancel meeting - couldn't explain why. Maybe I had picked up on micro aggression comments over time.I had told him previously I was working on losing a few kilos - I am tall and feel better at a US size 4-6 but was currently a US size 10-12. Not enormous but not comfortable in my own skin.

Then once when I was eating after fasting all day I turned the camera off and he said ""why are u turning the cam off r u gonna eat like a little piggy?? dont think I dont know..."" and I got immediately turned off in a visceral way. it felt bizarre to say that. we argued and I decided I didn't want to keep talking with high frequency and noticed his moods were erratic. before that piggy comment he was jealous I had been talking to a male uni friend for an assignment yet claimed he wasn't jealous but made fun of him. Anyway - weird little things kept happening like that as he'd apologise and move forward.

He encouraged that he didn't have intellectual connection with anyone the way he did with me and wanted to meet. eventually I caved. we met. when I opened the door he tilted his head far to the side and 'you're beautiful' all wide-eyed and starry. then he seemed to get shy, head down. we talked and had champagne and bonded over nerves. he was clearly turned on I could see his pants, he kept saying I was so sensual and he got so turned on by me. eventually we kissed and fooled around a little. we went out with some of his old friends, he introduced me to them and it was odd that he never introduced his 8yr ex to them. a detail that came up in conversation.

next day we're in bed and he whispers 'I love you' ad looks shy like a little boy. I say 'what di du say?' ad he says 'nothing...' and smiles but coy. he says 'I could stay all day in bed with u .' but seems restless and like he can't calm down. he takes a shower.

over his stay he was moody. he made a weird joke saying 'the uber guy said hi -he knows u' and I was like huh? he said nothing its stupid joke. I took it like he's insulting me like I use uber a lot, he said he meant it like im well known by men around town (Like a sl\*t). previously he covertly questioned me liking him and when I said I used to like a guy who's famous and kinda looked like him he said 'oh I see! u like ugly motherf\*ckers!'. so I guess his self concept was not great - but he always appeared hyper confident.

he eventually revealed his many businesses and investments - very wealthy and autonomous. its all legit. anyway after the uber thing I said well I thought u meant a shaming body comment cause im still insecure and not feeling myself in my body. he said 'im attracted to u! but I get it, just do what u need to do for u to feel good'. but this was after he got ANGRY at me for opening up! eventually I said I think responsibly I need to remain single until I feel good about myself, just seems like the best move. his mood dropped he got really quiet and his eyes changed. he was pissed.

next day instinctively I made up a lie and said I had to leave early. I wasn't feeling it with him and so I left to get coffee and Brought it back. he wanted to have it with me at a cafe but I lied and said I had to go. he said he'd like to spend more time with me and I said 'it was nice to meet you' and smiled I was polite, he said 'was?!' and was pissed but holding it down. we were in lobby of building; I lied and said I really had to go but it was great meeting and we'd talk by phone.  
never had I felt so relieved to just get away from someone. I sat next door in the cafe while.he waited for his uber and left.  
when I got home his jacket was still in closet. he asked about if I wanna see him again and if he did something wrong, I said no its fine and ill post ur jacket. he started to act pissed and weird.  
eventually I said it doesn't feel like a match but id love to be friends- he snapped, insulted a few things and laughed at me. he was now in another state partying with friends. I was just relieved he was gone honestly.  
eventually he called to apologise - I said its fine and we bickered a bit, he still wasn't listening - then he texts and tells me he was hard and 'I dont know how u do that, now I wanna cum'. and I realised through his admission he was constantly touching himself on the phone and video calls prior to meeting - and now again post meeting, even DURING an argument. I felt sick.  
eventually he demanded his jacket back after insulting me again - I said no I threw it away. he always went on how he's a multi-millionaire and I didn't want his energy or any reason for him to come here. poor choice by me sure but I felt sick after what I learned. he had also been taking screenshots of me during conversations on video while I wasn't aware.  
eventually he IMPLODED. said I catfished him, looked like a basketball, that I couldn't get him hard during sex (he lost his erection - mind you we were in pitch black darkness not even looking at each other), other women get him hard not me, 'mission accomplished' cause he got a blowjob from me. that he's a multi millionaire with an amazing life and im a loser piece of shit etc etc - the abuse went on and on and on ad nauseam; it was insane and non stop. He's 35 mind you.  
Of course I blocked him on everything. but now I know why I had that weird gut feeling - my instincts knew all along he was 'off'.

hate to say it but he got to me. ive looked in the mirror 3 times today 'am I as round as a basketball??' I do have big boobs but im tall (5'8) and even at size US 10-12 not a basketball. and saying I catfished him? we video chatted for hours non stop - no filter. just needed to get this out because this really threw me. all his comments about his ex flood back now 'she couldn't get me hard anymore', and his jokes about viagra, him liking to 'watch' people, his ex now being on anti depressants. his rants about being objectified by his ex for a BBC (he's black) but in person I discovered he has a very very small private part - no issue to me, but it was just oddly incongruent with how he'd depicted his appendage - and suprising.

I feel sick because this guy was my first emotional investment after an abusive relationship. I had been open with this guy that I hadn't dated in 1.5yr due to it and was still recovering. I told him EVERYTHING about my experience with the abusive ex and getting a restraining order etc and looking back im horrified cause now he knew how to play me and hurt me. In that relationship I had been treated with suspicion and jealousy because I was taking good care of myself in all ways and looked and felt confident. thereafter the abuse I gained weight and felt lost and not 'me' - it wasn't about image it was about feeling connected to self-care. with this guy, he read me like a book. the catfish comment and basketball comment did a number on me because I had been intentionally open and honest with my pain and issues. I never attacked his looks or facial skin look or small apendage or other things. by the end of his abuse I ended up throwing some insults back but I was just so sick of his non stop onslaught of texts out of nowhere all because I set a boundary on the jacket. sorry for ranting but I need help processing this. if he thought I was so repulsive why didn't he go book a hotel? and laughing saying 'other women get him harrrrd' and he's having an amazing time flying around the country to see different women and enjoying his life, well, good for you??

Final note: after meeting, while we argued on the phone, he then texted me saying 'u make me wanna cum \*laugh face\* I dont know how u do that'. and he was getting hard talking on the phone - this was an argument!! if im a basketball and catfish then why's he reacting like that? the mind-boggling nature of this doesn't make sense so can someone help me process it please?",3,1752537967.0,NarcissisticSpouses,1,1.0,False

/( Yes I know everyone but music as a bullet point in interests.

But it's worthwhile to mention I do like to play and learn guitar.
Etc. etc . Lol

1m02won,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/1m02won/a_makeyourbuild_steampunk_high_fantasy_roguelite/,A Make-Your-Build Steampunk High Fantasy Roguelite MMO FPS,"I've been recently playing Witchfire, and so I got thought ""hmm, what if they did this an that, and this and that"" and then I ended up getting inspired by Warframe, Deadlink, Risk of Rain 2, and just inspired by my own previous built up ideas. The world is set in a 'Apocalyptic Wizard Spellpunk world', similar to Arcane (League of Legends).

# SYSTEM

# INSCRIPTIONS

Inscriptions are powerful passive abilities that are scribed onto the Wizard‚Äôs skin to grant them powerful bonuses. Origin Inscriptions are class-unique inscriptions that are typically far more powerful than regular inscriptions.

# LOADOUTS

Loadouts are starting kits that set you up at the start of a playthrough, giving you a general direction for what to build for.

# RESOURCES

There are six main ‚Äòcurrencies‚Äô in this game: Quill, Veiled Tokens, Rune Essence, Glyph Fragments, Minerals, and Pearls

Quill is run-specific, meaning when you die you lose all Quill. However, you can utilize Quill during a run to buy things from a Shop, such as Grenades, Consumables, and Keys, and rarely- Glyphs.

Veiled Tokens is also run-specific, they grant the ability to access secret rooms by paying the toll of 1 Veiled Token- There are three types of secret rooms, ‚ÄòVault‚Äô (Chests full of Quill), ‚ÄòTimed Trial‚Äô (Defeat x enemies before x time ends, afterwards, gain an Inscription), ‚ÄòHidden Boss Room‚Äô (Defeat x boss, afterwards, gain a Pearl.)

Rune Essence is not run-specific and will stay with the player even if they die, Rune Essence is dropped on the death of literally any and every enemy- at minimum- the weakest monster in the game will still drop at least 5 Rune Essence- Rune Essence is used to level up as well as in Spellcrafting.

Glyph Fragments are also not run-specific, Glyph Fragments are obtained by chasing and catching Glyph Remnants which are super fast orbs of glowing energy that require a good deal of movement to catch. 3 Glyph Fragments allow you to synthesize Glyphs which can be engraved into weapons and talismans or also consumed for a temporary buff.

Minerals are not run-specific, Minerals can be used in Arcane Processors, Spellcrafting, Weapon Smithing, and at the Artificer‚Äôs Station, it is the main crafting ingredient for almost everything. It is abundant and can be harvested on every map.

Finally, Pearls are also not run-specific, they drop from bosses and mini-bosses- Pearls can be used to unlock new areas, crafting stations, and more at The Nexus. ‚ÄòResonant Pearls‚Äô are special Pearls specifically used for repairing Talismans, Resonant Pearls are when you JUST obtained Pearls in your last run, once you do another run, the ‚ÄòResonant Pearls‚Äô you had will become normal Pearls.¬†

# STIGMATAS

Stigmatas are unique-to-class passive abilities that directly affect what ‚ÄòArcanums‚Äô (run-specific modifiers/boons)¬† are available. For example, having the Eternoch Stigmata will make all future Arcanums time-related, item-related, or glyph-related.

# EQUIPMENT

There are three total weapon slots: Primary, Secondary, and Special. Along with Talisman, Artifact, and Shell, additionally, consumables are Tonics, Glyphs and Clusters, finally, Prima and Minon Incantations. Primary and Secondary Weapons are made at the Nexus Processor. Special weapons, Talismans, Glyphs, Artifacts and Engraved Weapons are made at the Artificer‚Äôs Vault. Tonics and Clusters are made at the Brewery and finally Shells are crafted at The Sealing Room. Finally, Prima and Minion Incantations are made at the Sorcery Table.

Primary Weapons are inter-exchangeable with Secondary, meaning the same weapon pool that you can select for your primary weapon is the same you can select for the secondary. Primary/Secondary weapons can be created at The Nexus at the Nexus Processor.

Special Weapons are powerful weapons typically coming with a drawback of some sort (i.e low ammo, use consequence, etc). They can be crafted at Artificer‚Äôs Vault at the Fabricator upon finding the correct Runeprint.

Tonics and Clusters are consumables that offer effects such as healing, Clusters giving low-in-amount but instantaneous effects such as heal 25% of health instantly, meanwhile Tonics have durations, such as Heal for 50% of health over 10 seconds. Tonics and Clusters are made at the Brewery.

Glyphs are consumables and a crafting material, when made, you can choose between ‚ÄòOccult‚Äô (Offensive), ‚ÄòRitualistic‚Äô (Defensive), and ‚ÄòMystic‚Äô (Support) Glyphs. Glyphs offer a random stat effect (i.e +10% attack power). Glyphs can be consumed for full-effect for 30s (i.e +10% attack power for 30s) or they can be engraved into weapons, offering 50% of the effect whenever the player is wielding the weapon, this can be done at the Engravement Circle in the Artificer‚Äôs Vault meanwhile Glyphs are made at the Synthesis Chamber in the Artificer‚Äôs Vault.

Artifacts are offense-focused equipment items that grant great effects (i.e Chain Lightning triggers every 30 shots or so), etc. Artifacts can be crafted at the Relic Foundry in the Artificer‚Äôs Vault

Talismans are pieces of equipment that can be engraved with a Glyph for its full-effect and permanent instead of locked to a 30s duration, however, Talismans become ‚ÄòCorrupted‚Äô after just two runs with the Talisman, breaking it entirely- in order to purify it, you need to use A ‚ÄòResonant Pearl‚Äô which will reset the durability of the Talisman. There are different Talismans that can be crafted and they have different effects, some amplify the strength of Glyphs but are one-run and then become corrupted, others can handle six entire runs before becoming Corrupted but they lessen the effects of the Glyph.

Shells are ‚Äòbuild-defining‚Äô equipment items, Shells are basically your armor, some offer incredible movement options, others allow you to defend against a nuke, while others let you pummel enemies like a train. Shells are the most build-defining items, which makes them the hardest to create. Located at the standalone crafting station ‚ÄòThe Unsealing Table‚Äô in The Sealing Room, Shells require Pearls, Minerals, Rune Essence, and Runeprints in order to be created. Shells have 4 effects each, starter characters have a fully unsealed Shell however starting shells are not as optimal as built shells. You must unseal each of the four effects of a Shell at the Unsealing Table.

Finally, Prima and Minion Incantations are your active abilities that you can use on-field, Prima Incantantions are super powerful active abilities but have super long recharge times, meanwhile, Mina Incantations are less powerful active abilities but with far less long recharge times. Prima and Minon Incantations can be researched at the Library Room of the Nexus, utilizing three different stations, The Witnessing Orb which is where you can research new ‚ÄòRunes‚Äô using Rune Essence, The Inscription Table, where you can mix and match Runes to create a desired Spell Scroll, and finally, The Spellbinder, where you can transform the Scroll into an incantation inscribed onto your flesh.

*Additional Consumables:*

False Icon - Allows for temporarily changing your stigmata so that you get desired Arcanums, can be found by defeating Fallen Angels.

True Icon - Allows for permanently changing your character‚Äôs stigmata, however, you will infuriate the God of your original stigmata- When you drop onto the Overlands once more, you will immediately be greeted with a boss fight against that god‚Äôs Avatar. True Icons are dropped by killing Gods.

# DYNAMIC COSMETICS

The Shell is your physical appearance in a way- it‚Äôs basically your exo-skeleton metal armor that covers almost your entire body, making you look spellpunk robotic. Shells undergo wear and tear the more they are used, every 10 runs adds 1 point to ‚Äòwear and tear‚Äô, with up to 10 points, meaning there are 10 wear and tear variants of the Shell. Alongside this, there are 10 points of Grime that can be added to the Armour which makes it look dirty, and finally, there are 10 points of Blood Stains that can be added to the Armour to make you look ruthless, Blood stains build 1 point every 100 kills and Grime builds up every 5 minutes. Added note, every death adds 2 points of ‚Äòwear and tear‚Äô.

You can clean your Shell of 9 points of Grime by swimming through any water source, but you‚Äôll be left with the bottom 1 point of grime which simply means your Shell isn‚Äôt shiny but is fully clean. To make it shiny you need to go to a Washstation in a town/city or build one in your Guild Throne through the Treasury or build one as an upgrade to the Bed Chambers in the Nexus. You can clean your Shell of 5 points of Blood Stain by swimming through any water source, but you‚Äôll be left with the bottom 5 points of Blood Stain which can only be washed by a Washstation.¬†

You can repair your Shell at the Locker in the Main Chamber of The Nexus, allowing you to choose what wear and tear level you want to repair it too, you can‚Äôt ‚Äòdamage‚Äô your Shell though except through repeated runs.¬†

These are all purely cosmetic and don‚Äôt affect anything mechanically.

Additionally, you can get something called Mastery Auras, which are ‚ÄòAuras‚Äô that occur from having high stat placementsExample:If you have Vitality over 50 (which is very hard to do considering max level is 30, meaning max base stat you can get is 45 (if you get a class with a 15 vitality start you get 30 stat points to invest)- you would need a shell that boosts the potency of vitality along with like Talismans that increases vitality to get the aura.

Vitality - Red Glowing Aura filled with Vigor.¬†

Endurance - Golden glowing Aura filled with Determination.¬†

Sagacity - Ghostly blue glowing Aura filled with Wisdom.¬†

Aptitude - Cosmic purple glowing Aura filled with Wisdom.¬†

Luck - Fortune Green glowing Aura filled with Opportunity.¬†

If you have 2 stats above 50, you can get a Prismatic Aura which glows in an awesome gradient between the two colors.

# INTRINSICS

Intrinsics is to boost a run, right before every run, there is an altar within the Artificer‚Äôs Vault that offers 3 unique but merely mediocre power-ups, the player can only select one out of the three random ones and if they do choose to run with an Intrinsic, then the Intrinsics Altar will be 'conjuring intrinsics' when you return, meaning you have to do another run before you can use it again- so it doesn't work on EVERY run but instead every other run that you do use it. The altar can be upgraded up to +3 using a lot of Rune Essence and Pearls to upgrade. When it is upgraded to +3 there is a chance for a 'Resonant Intrinsic' which is a very powerful intrinsic that offers practically a game-changing ability that makes you quite OP, however, you have to unlock it by clearing a condition while holding a huge penalty like -70% health or -60% damage- if you complete the condition the penalty will be removed and replaced with the Resonant Intrinsic.¬†

# Examples:

# INTRINSIC ALTAR I

(Lowest level Intrinsics Station- Has a 50% cchance for Stone Rarity, 40% chance for Silver Rarity, and 10% chance for Witchgem Rarity )¬†

Faithful Duty - Stone Intrinsic (Accursed Rarity)¬†

\+2 FLAT damage every kill, stacks up to 5. Stacks reset on reload, weapon swap, getting damaged, or being out of combat. Enemy spawn rate increased by 10%

Divine Determination - Silver Intrinsic (Shoddy Rarity)¬†

When below 10% of Max HP, gain natural health regeneration that activates when out of combat up to 10% of Max HP, regenerating 2 health every 2.5 seconds. Damnation¬†

Magegem Intrinsic (Common Rarity)¬†

Elite Enemies are instantly killed when their health falls below 10% of their max life.¬†

# INTRINSIC ALTAR II

(20% chance for Stone Rarity, 30% chance for Silver, 40% chance for Mage-gem rarity, 10% chance for Magesoul rarity)¬†

Madness - Magesoul Intrinsic (Rare Rarity)¬†

Deal 50% increased damage for 1.5 seconds after a kill, does not stack.¬†

Intrinsic III - (10% chance for Stone Rarity, 20% chance for Silver, 20% chance for Silver, 25% chance for Magesoul rarity, 25% chance for Godsworn rarity)¬†

Reincarnation - Godsworn Intrinsic (Epic Rarity)¬†

When you die, revive instead.¬†

# INTRINSIC ALTAR III

(also has a 2.8% chance for a Resonant Intrinsic- super powerful but with a huge penalty.)

Resonant Madness - Resonant Magesoul Intrinsic¬†

Deal +100% increased damage for 3 seconds after a kill, does not stack. However, it is dissonant (sealed) until you purify 1 ‚ÄòCorrupted Grounds‚Äô and until you resolve the dissonance you are inflicted with the following penalty: -10% damage every time you reload, to a maximum of -70%, 1 stack wares off per 15 seconds of you being out of battle.

Intrinsic III comes with the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, if you somehow get the 2.8% chance for resonant intrinsics, and then additionally, at a 4.8% chance, you could obtain a Volatile Resonant Intrinsic, Volatile Resonant Intrinsics are basically cheats at extreme rarity- and the challenge you have to go is ferociously difficult, even if you have 3,000 hours into the game.¬†

Volatile Resonant Madness - Volatile Resonant Magesoul Intrinsic¬†

Deal +50% increased damage for 10 seconds after a kill, stacks up to 20 times. To resolve the dissonance you must kill 10 Elite Enemies and 1 Mini-Boss while dealing with -99% max HP.¬†

ONLY resonant and accursed intrinsics have a penalty not normal intrinsics, although normal intrinsics might have 'limits'.

# CRAFTING STATIONS

All crafting stations must be unlocked through Pearls. At the start, the only thing available at the Nexus is The Nexon, which is where you go to level up by expending Rune Essence, and The Chartmap, which is where you go to select where to drop on the world for hunting creatures. You have to unlock the rest with Pearls as you progress and deal with the items you start with until you unlock the different areas along with their respective crafting stations. You get to choose which you want to unlock first, would you rather unlock the Artificer‚Äôs Vault and then the workstations, or would you like to unlock the Living Room, Bedroom, and even Wardrobe for cosmetic purposes, maybe perhaps even the Guild Throne?

# NEXUS

The Nexus is the Player Hub, A floating island that travels across the Overlands capable of incredible feats, it is typically a singleplayer instance and it holds the following rooms:

# MAIN CHAMBER:

The Main Chamber of the Nexus is also the very middle of the Nexus, holding the Nexon, Weapons Locker, Herald who is your Butler, Neximar Control Panel, Nexus Processor and finally, The Chartmap.¬†

NEXON - Unlocked Initially, allows the character to level up and allocate stat points by utilizing their Rune Essence. Can also be upgraded for extraction efficiency.

WEAPONS LOCKER - This is where you can look at and equip your desired equipment from weapons to glyphs to more out of all your equipment that you have unlocked and is in storage.

HERALD - Herald is your butler/codex, you will see him roaming around The Nexus cleaning things or handling different tasks, you can talk to him and he will act as a Codex that lets you see everything you need to know about anything- he will also just have random funny dialogue moments.

NEXIMAR CONTROL - (Liberate Arcane Pillar) The Control Panel is where you can have The Nexus fly or when upgraded, warp to liberated Arcane Pillars. It is initially locked but doesn‚Äôt require pearls to unlock, instead, it requires the liberation of your first Arcane Pillar to unlock.¬†

CHARTMAP - Connected to the Nexon‚Äôs warping rig, you can select a destination you want to go that is either within 200m of The Nexus or within 50m of an Arcane Pillar and it will open a portal to go there.

NEXUS PROCESSOR - (1P) Connected to the Nexon‚Äôs power source, the Nexus Processor allows for the creation of new weapons, it is where you can start building your arsenal and is the recommended very first purchase, while The Brewery is the first recommended ‚Äòroom purchase‚Äô.

# ARTIFICER‚ÄôS VAULT:

(COST: 1 Pearl (1P) to unlock this room)

The Artificer‚Äôs Vault of the Nexus is the north-eastern-most part of The Nexus, holding The Synthesis Chamber, Engravement Circle, Relic Foundry, Intrinsics Altar and Fabricator.

SYNTHESIS CHAMBER - (1P) Allows for the combination of Glyph Fragments obtained by Remnants to create Consumable Glyphs.

ENGRAVEMENT CIRCLE - (2P) Allows for the engravement of Glyphs onto Talismans and Weapons.¬†

RELIC FOUNDRY - (2P) Allows for the creation of Artifacts.

INTRINSICS ALTAR - (3P) Allows for selecting Intrinsics and upgrading the Intrinsics Altar.

# THE LIBRARY:

(COST: 1 Pearl (1P) to unlock this room)

The Library is found the south-western-most part of The Nexus, holding The Inscription Table, The Witnessing Orb, The Archive, and The Spellbinder

WITNESSING ORB - (1P) Allows for researching Runes such as ‚ÄòFire Rune‚Äô, ‚ÄòEarth Rune‚Äô, ‚ÄòProjectile Rune‚Äô, ‚ÄòExpansion Rune‚Äô, ‚ÄòVelocity Rune‚Äô, etc, etc- once researched they can be used indefinitely at the Inscription Table. There are 100 total Runes available.¬†

THE INSCRIPTION TABLE - (1P) Allows for mixing and matching runes within available ‚ÄòSpell Slots‚Äô, at Level 1 it has 3 slots, at level 2: 5, and at level 3: 7 The amount of runes that can be utilized is dependent on the Rune‚Äôs Tier Level. For example, a Fire Rune is a T2 Rune meaning it takes up to 2 slots and makes the incantation a fire one, then you have to combine it with say a Projectile Rune which is a T1 Rune, and now you have the incantation ‚ÄòFire Arrow‚Äô- you can then also add a Minor Velocity Rune and a Minor Expansion Rune which are both T1 Runes, granting increased projectile speed and projectile size- this creates ‚ÄúFire Bolt‚Äù, finally you can add the Combustion Rune which is T3 to make it explode on impact, creating ‚ÄúFire Ball‚Äù Incantation. Note: Anything above 4 slots is considered a ‚ÄòPrima Incantation‚Äô and anything at 4 or below is considered a ‚ÄòMinon Incantation‚Äô

THE SPELLBINDER - (2P) This is where you can equip your Prima and Mina Incantations by enscribing them onto your flesh so your body can handle the backlash of the incantations power utilizing the arcane blood. The Spellbinder requires ‚ÄòRune Essence‚Äô to inscribe.¬†

THE ARCHIVE - (Unlocked Initially) The Archive is where you can find all possible recipes and search up ones you want using an advanced filtering system for selecting specific runes you want the spell to contain, only ones that ‚ÄòCAN BE CRAFTED‚Äô will be shown and the others will be a mystery with a question mark on the icon.

# THE BREWERY:

(COST: 1 Pearl (1P) to unlock this room)

The Brewery is the smallest of rooms within the Nexus and is what Herald ‚Äòrecommends‚Äô be the first thing to unlock considering there is no Natural Health Regeneration without something that specifically grants that. The Brewery is the southern most part of the Nexus, holding The Cauldron, The Refinery, The Enclyopedia, and The Matter Generator.

THE MATTER GENERATOR - (2P) The Matter Generator is where you transform ‚ÄòMinerals‚Äô into any material/crafting resource found in the game such as Nightshade, Greenwisp Flower, Serpent Scales, etc.¬†

THE CAULDRON - (1P)The Cauldron is where you create tonics utilizing generated crafting resources from The Matter Generator or found throughout the map. You can combine up to 3 resources to find existing recipes for possible tonics. I.e ‚ÄòGreenwisp Flower‚Äô, ‚ÄòHealroot‚Äô, and ‚ÄòMorning Cloves‚Äô will give 100% of HP over 10 seconds, but just using ‚ÄòHealroot‚Äô will only give 25% of HP over 10 seconds.

THE REFINERY - (1P) The Refinery is where you create Clusters utilizing generated crafting resources from The Matter or found throughout the map. Just like the Cauldron, you can combine up to 3 resources. However, clusters are instantaneous but weaker than tonics. I.e ‚ÄòGreenwisp Flower‚Äô, ‚ÄòHealroot‚Äô, and ‚ÄòMorning Cloves‚Äô will give 50% of HP instantly, but just using ‚ÄòHealroot‚Äô will only give 10% of HP instantly.

THE ENCLYOPEDIA - (Unlocked Initially) Acts just like THE ARCHIVE in The Library but instead for Tonics and Clusters.

# THE SEALING ROOM:

(COST: 5 Pearls (5P) to unlock this room)

The Sealing Room is a decently sized room located adjacent to the Library making it the western-most part of the Nexus. The Sealing Room holds the Unsealing Table. The Sealing Room is a circular tower high in verticality that displays all the Shells that are sealed in The Nexus, hence why you have to 'Unseal' the Shells in the first place, The Nexus is an ancient sanctuary that was used by the Necromons, they were far more advanced than modern mages but their technology was forgotten, Necromons used Shells in the past, hence you must unseal Shells instead of craft them, slowly going through the intricate arcane locking mechanisms on The Necromon‚Äôs most prized military technology.

UNSEALING TABLE - (Unlocked when the room is unlocked) Allows for the creation and gradual unsealing of Shells.

# GUILD THRONE:

(COST: 10 Pearls (10P) to unlock this room)

The Guild Throne is the largest room at The Nexus, accessed through a portal in The Living Room- The Guild Throne features multiple sub-rooms and anyone within the same guild can meet each other at the Guild Throne as it is shared. The Guild Throne features the following subrooms and interactables: Throne Room: Guild Chartmap, Nexon Converter, Throne, Lounge Room: Nexamus Broadcaster, Coffee Machine, Law Room: Treasury, Crown Control Panel

# THRONE ROOM

The Throne Room is where you arrive and also where the exit portal back to The Nexus is.¬†

GUILD CHARTMAP - The Guild Chartmap allows for guild members to quickly go to a destination with all agreeing members that are within The Throne Room of the Guild Throne as well as take on ‚ÄòGuild Events‚Äô and ‚ÄòGuild Raids‚Äô which are tougher than normal ‚ÄòParty/Group Events‚Äô or raids.

NEXON CONVERTER - Allows Guild Members to donate to the Guild Treasury allowing for the Guild Rank to increase which unlocks various useful things.

THRONE - Where the Guild Leader can sit along with up to 4 additional seats beside the throne that are reserved for admins and when sat down opens the UI for Guild Management, allowing for stuff such as banning members or otherwise.¬†

# LOUNGE ROOM

The Lounge Room is right next to the throne room and is unlocked at Guild Rank 2.

NEXAMUS BROADCASTER - Allows for communicating with guild-members in-game long-range by connecting to the Player‚Äôs Telepathic Nexamus Line.

COFFEE MACHINE - Allows for drinking a cup of coffee and thereby getting the Guild Buff ‚ÄòEnergized‚Äô which reduces stamina cost by 30% and increases movement speed by 50% while in the Guild Throne.

# LAW ROOM

The Law Room is also right next to the Throne Room, only admin/mods/guild leader can enter here and only if the guild leader allows for that to happen.

TREASURY - This is where you can manage guild funds and make guild purchases, such as purchasing a ‚ÄòEvent Sigil‚Äô which forces for a ‚ÄòGuild Event‚Äô to begin in the world, along with many, many, many more Guild purchases.¬†

CROWN CONTROL PANEL - This is where you can add decorations/organize the entire Guild Throne- you can change the location of rooms and how they can be accessed and add unique interactables and furniture purchased from The Treasury.

# LIVING QUARTERS

The Living Quarters includes sub-rooms, The Closet, The Living Room, and The Bed Chambers.¬†

THE CLOSET - Allows for transmorgifying Weapons and Shell into unlocked weapons/shells.

THE LIVING ROOM - Just a cute place that you can personalize using the room‚Äôs control panel, allowing you to choose one out of ten presets of how you want your living room, but each preset beyond the default gets increasingly more expensive, the personalization style becomes apparent across the entirety of the Living Quarters.

THE BED CHAMBERS - Where you can go to sleep, this gives you a buff called ‚ÄòWell Rested‚Äô which increases movement speed by 20% and stamina cost reduction by 50%, lasts for 10 minutes. You can purchase a ‚ÄòSleep Projector‚Äô in the Bed Chambers using Minerals to make the ‚ÄòWell Rested‚Äô effect appear immediately and reset every 5 seconds whenever you enter and are in The Nexus.

# THE GAME

The player selects a destination on the Chartmap and then is dropped into the Open World of the Overlands, there are towns and cities, events, a whole bunch of stuff- but this world is a spell-punk apocalypse where magic has corrupted the floor of the Overlands leaving everyone to create their own Nexus Islands to survive.

Players can drop into this world and then to leave, they have to extract in order to return to The Nexus, but this is quite dangerous as The Nexus warps above your head and sends down an Arcane Teleportation Beam powered by The Nexon- This alerts every enemy alive within the Region, meaning extractions get A LOT of attention- this is where the game becomes almost like 'wave defense' for like 1:00 minute before the player can extract. Upgrades to The Nexon can occur to hasten the extraction speed, another way to leave the Overworld is by finding RiftGates that are found usually in a Boss Room that allow for teleportation to any unlocked Arcane Pillar or The Nexus. You can upgrade the Beam at the Nexon to not only decrease time before transportation, but also you can get a ‚Äòparticle field‚Äô and even a NPC Golem to help fight at future upgrades.

When you deploy onto the Overlands your goal is to continue liberating Arcane Pillars across all the regions that scale in difficulty of The Overlands, inching your way closer to purifying the world of The Corruption and defeating the Final Boss who caused it all in the first place, defeating his countless henchmen in the process. (i.e 'The Coasts' is lvl 1-5 but 'Forsaken Cliffs' is for lvl 80-100, for reference, max level is 30- you make up the rest of the stat gap through equipment)

# STATS

VITALITY - Max health pool and max stamina pool

1m02w9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m02w9m/is_he_losing_interest_or_am_i_overthinking/,Is he losing interest or am I overthinking?,"So I (24f) met this guy(28m) at a social networking event. We happened to be sitting next to each other and starting chatting. He's super cheerful and attractive. After the event, he asked for my number and later invited me out for coffee. We ended up grabbing coffee and then heading to a nice bar. Overall a fun first date.

He texted me afterward saying he had a great time. I replied, but didn‚Äôt hear back. I was kinda bummed he didn't suggest a second date, so a couple days later, I texted him just to check in. He responded super fast and asked me out for the weekend, but I already had plans. I told him I couldn't make it but would be free the following week. 

He didn‚Äôt reach out the next week. So I reached out again and suggested a hiking date that weekend. He said he was down. We had a blast, hiked, grabbed dinner, and he was his usual charming, energetic self. Seemed like he was genuinely interested in getting to know me. I texted him first again after, and we had a great back and forth.

For the next two weeks, he was texting me first every day, and our convos were always fun and flirty, ended on a high note. Then last week, he asked me to check out a new bar. I was excited, but during the date, something felt off. He was quieter than usual, and there were these awkward silences that never happened before. When I shared something with him, his responses were kinda flat, not his usual vibe. We said goodbye, and I haven't heard from him since. It's been four days now. I didn‚Äôt text him either this time.

Did I do something to turn him off during our last date? Or is he just losing interest? I thought maybe he's not a big texter, but he used to send double or triple texts and was always enthusiastic when I reached out. Has anyone else experienced something like this? I'd love some insight on what might be going on or what I should do next. Thanks!

Growing up in my household, you'd probably take one look at me and think, ""That kid doesn‚Äôt look healthy."" But I was. Or at least, that‚Äôs what my parents believed. We didn‚Äôt eat sugar, fast food, or anything with ingredients you couldn‚Äôt pronounce. Except for soda‚Äîzero-calorie, chemical-laced soda. Somehow, that got a pass.

I could eat just about anything. My parents liked to say I had a ‚Äúclean system,‚Äù like I was some kind of organic machine. But candy? Never cared for it. My grandparents had a jar of old hard candies on their coffee table‚Äîpeppermint, clove, those chalky root beer barrels‚Äîand even as a kid, I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to touch them.

Now that I think about it, maybe that was the first sign something was off.


---

At school, things were different. Vegetables? Sure. Leftovers? Great. Mystery meat? Why not? I‚Äôd eat anything. It got to the point where the other kids started calling me the human garbage disposal. What started as a joke turned into a challenge.

They dared me to eat the grossest combinations they could come up with. Slaw with peanut butter and cheddar. Cheesecake smeared with tuna. Ketchup-soaked cereal. Every bite got me two things: disgusted looks, and cash.

Milk money.

I‚Äôd win it, stash it, and when I had enough, I‚Äôd head outside to the shaded benches behind the school with a cold 8-ounce carton of whole milk. That was my reward. Smooth, creamy, perfectly chilled. I‚Äôd sit there sipping it like a king while the other kids gagged at what they‚Äôd just watched.

And honestly? That milk never tasted better than when it was earned.


---

After a few months, I stopped spending the milk money right away. I started saving it‚Äîdollar by crumpled dollar‚Äîuntil I finally had enough to buy a brand-new Game Boy SP and a copy of Pok√©mon Emerald. I told my parents it came from change I found or odd jobs.

If they knew the truth‚Äîthat I was eating for cash‚Äîthey would‚Äôve lost their minds.

‚ÄúFilthy,‚Äù my mom would‚Äôve said, already dragging me toward the sink.
‚ÄúUnclean,‚Äù my dad would mutter, handing me a scrub brush for the floor.

So I kept it to myself. Just another secret in a growing pile.


---

This is probably why other foods never really bothered me. It's like I‚Äôd been shown the light‚Äîhow good things could taste, even if they were weird or wrong. I‚Äôd eat my packed meal‚Äîflax wraps and quinoa patties‚Äîbut I‚Äôd never turn down a stolen cookie or slice of pizza.

School became my secret pleasure. My sin.
And I savored every bite.


---

Part Two: The Parents

To really understand me, you have to understand them.

My parents weren‚Äôt just health-conscious‚Äîthey were disciples of the ""clean living"" gospel. We shopped only at Trader Joe‚Äôs or, as they reverently called it, Eden‚ÄîWhole Foods. Everything was organic, local, grass-fed, sprouted, fermented, non-GMO, and probably blessed under moonlight.

Now, I know what you‚Äôre probably thinking. Living like that, we must‚Äôve been the kind of people who wore one shirt all week and used soap made from tree bark and sadness. Minimalist, quiet, kind of crunchy.

Nope.

We were loud about it. Judgmental. Proud. My mom tracked our weekly macros in a spreadsheet. My dad read nutrition labels like he was uncovering government lies. Food wasn‚Äôt pleasure in our house‚Äîit was fuel. Performance. Purity.


---

There‚Äôs this story they loved to tell at dinner parties‚Äîor whatever you call a potluck where no one brings dessert.

‚ÄúWhen he was born,‚Äù my mom would say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt scream. Didn‚Äôt cry. Just breathed. No epidural. No panic. Just focus.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt even flinch,‚Äù my dad would add. ‚ÄúHe came out calm. Clean. Just like we raised him.‚Äù

I‚Äôd smile along, pretending not to feel gross inside.
Pretending I hadn‚Äôt heard it a hundred times.

But the older I got, the more I wondered if maybe I hadn‚Äôt just been born quiet‚Äî
Maybe I‚Äôd been born hungry.


---

Everything in our house had a purpose. A place. We weren‚Äôt poor, but there were no snacks. No comfort food. Just chia, kale, lentils, tofu, almonds, and bitter tea. Our pantry looked like it was stocked for an apocalypse where flavor didn‚Äôt survive.

Everything was ritual. Clean counters. Cold food. Portion control.

It made me feel... small. Like I was a science project they were trying to keep too clean. And sometimes, I swear, even my stomach growled differently than other kids‚Äô.

But then came junior year.

Then came her.


---

Part Three: Claire

Biology lab. Fetal pigs.

We spent an entire class slicing them open‚Äîlayers of preserved skin, rubbery organs, the stench of formaldehyde in our hair and clothes. The classroom reeked for hours. No one could eat afterward. Not a word in the cafeteria. Even the lunch staff looked pale.

Except Claire.

She sat out in the courtyard like nothing had happened, peeling the foil off a homemade sandwich. The smell hit me before I saw her‚Äîsomething slow-cooked, rich, warm. I watched as she took one bite, calmly chewing while everyone else pretended they weren‚Äôt trying to throw up.

‚ÄúYou gonna hover, or sit?‚Äù she asked without looking up.

I blinked. ‚ÄúUh... I‚Äôll sit.‚Äù


---

We didn‚Äôt talk at first. I just watched her eat, completely unfazed.

‚ÄúHow are you not grossed out?‚Äù I finally asked.

She shrugged. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt waste meals. Not in my house.‚Äù

There was something final in the way she said it. Not rude. Not weird. Just matter-of-fact‚Äîlike it was a law, not a choice.

After that, we kept crossing paths. And then, eating together became a habit. Claire always brought food from home: beef stew in a thermos, roasted squash with something sweet drizzled over it, thick slices of bread with strange meats that weren‚Äôt quite ham, not quite turkey.

She didn‚Äôt offer anything the first few days. Then, one lunch, she just said:

‚ÄúMy mom made too much. Want some?‚Äù

It was lamb. Braised. The edges slightly crisp. The fat still warm. I didn‚Äôt even hesitate.


---

Something changed after that.

I stopped pretending that I liked the food from home. I‚Äôd still eat it‚Äîbut only because I had to. Claire‚Äôs food? It called to something in me. Something I didn‚Äôt know was waiting. Something I didn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd been starving all along.

Eventually, she started packing extra for me. No fanfare. No flirting. Just:
‚ÄúHere, you‚Äôll like this.‚Äù
Or: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind the texture‚Äîit‚Äôs supposed to be rare.‚Äù

I never asked what it was.
And she never told me.

Then one day, she said, ‚ÄúYou should come over for dinner. My parents want to meet you.‚Äù

I said yes without thinking.
And that was the last decision I made with a clear head.

I have this friend (female, 32,  SAHM of 4) whom I (f, 33, SAHM of 2) grew very close to and we began to speak almost daily. This girl is the ultimate social scene addict. She needs to know everyone, she need to be friends with anyone, and if she crosses paths with anyone who doesn't jump and celebrate when they see her, it bothers her to no end. Even if she doesn't know that person well, it will be on her heart and mind for days why that person doesn't seem too interested in her. I'm quite opposite, in fact, I'd rather have one or two close friends that my kids and I can be close to and I'm good. She describes herself as very extroverted and she loves to meet and make new friends. 

Anyway, she began to confide in me about her friendships and I confided in her as well. One thing that was odd to me:  a year ago I was at a friend's house when she called. I said I'm with my friend. 
Her: o nice who is your friend? 
Me: Katie. 
Her: oh Katie, do I know her? 
Me: idk, she's from church. 
Her: hmmmm OK. 
We hang up and immediately I get a text from her:
Her: o wait katie from church, Ashley's mother. Oh yes I've seen her before, tell her I said hi. 
So she doesn't really know or hang out with this person, but has seen her at our small church community. Katie tells me no I don't know her, maybe I've seen her kids around tho. 

Fast forward, suddenly she's asking me alot of questions about Katie. Then it's become a weekly thing where she is now seeing Katie and walking up to her and chatting and getting personal etc. Not something I would do with a random person just bc we have a mutual friend but whatever. 
A year later, Katie and I stop really hanging out due to a misunderstanding. But now, I have my bestie who is telling me weekly ""oh I saw Katie, we talked, she's so nice, I saw her at the store and went up to her, I saw her at the day and talked to her and we took pictures."" I find this is weird bc Im like well you never crossrd paths with her until I mentioned her and now that we no longer are close, you're suddenly becoming close to her. 
This has happened with serveral of my friends now. Where I will mention their name, she will find them and befriend them, get close to them, and come to tell me about their interactions as if they are long time friends. 
Like I said, she has no shortage of ""friends"" and I've met most of them, but I have never tried to force a friendship with them or inquire about them. I don't need to and I don't care to becomes friends with her friends, but when we are all together we have a good time and get along great. 
Also, I've recently found out that shes been trying to get really close to 2 sisters that Im no longer close to and they clearly hate me. She doesn't know them, I introduced them a while ago and she latched on and she is always contacting them on their socials etc. Thing is, she will call me and say Idk what their problem is with you, you're an amazing girl, it's their loss, there is something wrong with them clearly. Yet, she is in cosntant pursuit of their time and attention.

This is becoming heavy and toxic to me. I now dread our phone calls bc it's gonna bother me when she mentions how she saw and went up to my old friends and how nice they are. 
I know of many girls she no longer communicates with and I've never approached them. One of her family members who really liked me invited me for coffee and my friend got extremely upset and said I don't want to ever see you with her. So I backed off. Just not sure how to approach her and not sure if this is even ""true friend"" vibes anymore. Sounds like she's just recruiting allies if anything. So heart breaking. 
I know if approach her she's must gonna say well I love people I love making new friends. Especially my frenemies lol. What is your take? ",0,1752537203.0,Frenemies,3,0.5,False

I‚Äôm a 35-year-old nerd from New England who loves conventions, gaming, and cosplay. (Fun fact: I even built my own dating site‚Äîyes, really.)

When I‚Äôm not suiting up for a con as Eddie Munson from Stranger Things, Leon from Resident Evil along others, I enjoy dressing well, working out to stay healthy, and entering sweepstakes & raffles (with surprising luck). I‚Äôm passionate about geek culture, but I‚Äôm also grounded, kind, and always striving to connect with like-minded people.

I‚Äôm hoping to meet a woman who‚Äôd enjoy geeking out together, maybe traveling, cosplaying (optional!), and building a meaningful connection. For now, grabbing a coffee and seeing where things go would be a great start‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre local!

If you‚Äôre curious to learn more, I can‚Äôt share my site link here (rules), but you can find it in my profile!

1m02m79,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m02m79/am_i_the_asshole_for_breaking_up_my_mother_with/,Am I the asshole for breaking up my mother with her new boyfriend?,"Hello there! English is not my first language, so I‚Äôm sorry if something‚Äôs wrong with my words.

So the story goes like this: me and my mom have a great relationship full of love now, but before that we didn‚Äôt talk for about 7 months, because we had a huge argument and she called the cops on me.

My dad influenced her very much (rest in peace, motherfucker) when he was alive. He was abusive towards me and my mom, but she always sided with him in arguments due to their shared alcoholism.

He passed away about 6 months ago due to heart problems and my mom went a long way from the day she called me crying in the middle of the road when my father lost consciousness in the car. After his death she went to therapy and we rebuild our relationship brick by brick, but she‚Äôs been miserable occasionally and crying sometimes after his death.

She‚Äôs doing fine, has a job as a nanny and doesn‚Äôt drink anymore. Them came this guy, let‚Äôs call him Max. She met him in an online group that she stumbled upon on facebook and started chatting with him there. After that he asked her out and they went on a date to the coffee shop I suggested, because we go there often together. The date went well and they continued chatting afterwards.

The problem with this guy is that he is a little bit on the redneck side of existence, while my mother is a lawyer and a very intelligent, smart and beautiful women that been around the world (like 60 countries or so). This guy works at a car wash, didn‚Äôt go to uni (whip is odd, because we have about 90% of people with diplomas in our country) and is overall average. 

To add to that he is a homophobe from a district of our city that you wouldn‚Äôt want to find yourself in after it gets dark and he is the type of people that terrorize kids with piercings in the street. He used the word f@g to describe one of them during their first date. 

The plot twist? I‚Äôm her son and I‚Äôm gay as shit. Been since 11 years old and proud to be a homosexual. My mother knows about this and she told him that she won‚Äôt hear any homophobic slurs from him under any conditions.

The problem came during their second date. It was raining like crazy (lightning everywhere, the trees flying out of the ground, the sky went dark at like 5pm in the summer) and they agreed to meet on this day and go for a bbq in the middle of nowhere about 30km from the city centre.

I told her that the lightning and rain is a sign, that maybe she should not go on a date with a man she met a couple of weeks online and she agreed at first, but then she messaged me at like 10pm that she found a taxi and is going there anyway (the taxi was about 20 bucks, which is insane considering that in our country you can ride across the city for about 3 dollars).

She spent the night at his place alone with him and came back home the day after at like 7pm. 

I called her and asked how her night out went and she said that she had a great time and everything was fun. I decided to ask her about his homophobic tendencies and she said that he was passionate about Freddy Mercury and she highlighted that he was gay and the guy said nothing about it and just ‚Äúthought to himself‚Äù.

I asked if she needed my opinion about him (considering that she told him that if I didn‚Äôt like him, she would cut him off immediately). She said yes, I told him that I don‚Äôt support the idea of her dating a homophobe considering that I‚Äôm openly gay, I told her that in solidarity with women I don‚Äôt date sexists (my boyfriend is a charming teddy bear that loves my mom and is pro-feminist as myself). I told her that solidarity matters and that by dating a person with open homophobic tendencies she is encouraging him to remain as he is.

She told me that she will think about this. I should also add that during our discussion things got a little heated, because I‚Äôm passionate about gay and women‚Äôs rights and can‚Äôt stand homophobes or sexists.

She messaged me about an hour later telling me that she cut him off. Perfect, right? Wrong.

She called me sobbing telling me that ‚Äúshe cut him off cause I didn‚Äôt like him‚Äù. She told me that she felt cursed, that she would die alone in her home, that she wants to throw out my father‚Äôs ashes and torn up his photographs.

We talked for a bit after that and she seems better, I understand that she is processing grief and I kinda feel like it was too early for her to seriously date someone after 26 years of marriage.

I just wanted to protect her from the type of my father who was a homophobe and believed that women belong in the kitchen. I was afraid that he would hurt her like my father did. She made remarks that Max looked at her with puppy eyes and was a gentleman and she had fun with him. 

I also think that she went on this dates not to heal from grief, but to satisfy the need for a man, because her relationship with my dad was pretty much co-dependent. 

I feel like shit and I want my mom to be happy. Tell me, Reddit, am I the a$$hole?",2,1752537038.0,AITAH,0,0.75,False
1m02lv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m02lv2/the_farmers_oven/,The Farmers Oven,"I was a little late today. Who am I kidding I‚Äôm a little late every day. I walk into the shop and punch in like usual. Lou doesn‚Äôt even look at me anymore or shake his head. I guess that‚Äôs what 20 years of always showing up a little late does. As I walk through the shop I give Lou‚Äôs guys their morning pleasantries.

‚ÄúMorning, Brandon‚Äù

‚ÄúMorning, Jo‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are you today?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the Dream‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre dream or someone else‚Äôs?‚Äù

We both laugh as this is the same conversation we‚Äôve had about a thousand times now.

*It‚Äôs too bad.*

I walk out to the garage where the plumbers meet. Maury, Brent, Mini Zeke, and Bruce are all waiting for their morning jobs from our dispatcher. Darryl doles out the morning jobs like usual. Maury and Brent are going to fix some leak in an apartment complex, Bruce gets the joy of unplugging a few toilets that have this mysterious goo coming out of them. The people in that office building have probably never seen their own shit before, but hey people are entitled to think poo and goo are one and the same. These guys are the current crew we have. Turnovers are high here at ‚ÄúLou‚Äôs Plumbing and Heating Co.‚Äù Somehow I have more seniority than almost everyone here.

‚ÄúHere comes the straggler!‚Äù says Bruce

In walks Louis Jr. the Third. I shouldn‚Äôt say walk. It‚Äôs more like a deranged shuffle. Louis Jr. the Third, or as we call him Lou the turd, is our dear proprietor's son. He‚Äôs a dick. He‚Äôs also weird. He likes to sit slightly too far away from everyone. He also smells a little rotten, like right before the milk is curdled. He‚Äôs been here supposedly forever, or so he tells everyone.

*Lies.*

Anyhow this morning the Turd walks in with a pile of paperwork, and before I can say anything‚Ä¶

‚ÄúHoly shit, you know how to read?‚Äù says Mini Zeke

And in a high nasally voice ‚ÄúWell you‚Äôre one to talk, didn‚Äôt your dad drop you on your head when you were a baby? Oh right, he wasn‚Äôt even around when you were born. Guess your stupidity drove him to kill himself.‚Äù

‚ÄúLadies please‚Äù

In walks Bill. He‚Äôs our boss and Lou‚Äôs adopted brother.

‚ÄúWhat my dear illiterate nephew meant to say was, we have some new training documents to go over. We got a big job at the plant starting next month and we have some safety training I need you guys to familiarize yourselves with.‚Äù I felt the room turn to ice when Bill brought up The Plant. I glanced around the office and saw Mini. He was stiff as a board. I casually said

‚ÄúHey Bill, are we decommissioning the boiler?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just decommissioning it, we‚Äôre replacing it, Jo.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow are we gonna do it? That thing is the size of a 12-story building.‚Äù

*They're all burning.*

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve partnered with Trent and George to supply the manpower, and you‚Äôll be working with Chris and Andreas as Leads.

‚ÄúFuck Andreas, Chris I understand, but Andreas?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like it either, but we needed a demolition crew and I thought I could benefit with you and Chris elsewhere.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why Trent and George then? Thought you hated each other?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe came to find that working together after all these years is mutually beneficial‚Äù

‚ÄúUh huh, how big is the contract?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwelve million‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt it cost more in the neighbourhood of six to seven million?‚Äù

The last one I did, a fly-in job in Northern Ontario, was about five point five million. If you factor in all the inflation, the ‚Äúsupply chain issues‚Äù and all the salesman bullshit. It should only be a few million more, but more than double?

‚ÄúAre we removing the old boiler?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot exactly, we‚Äôre going to leave the skeleton and repair the holes in it and update the burner box.‚Äù

Whatever you do won‚Äôt work. It will happen again.

‚ÄúWhen can I see the plans?‚Äù

‚ÄúNext week, I‚Äôll have the engineer fax us a couple of copies.‚Äù

Ah yes, the trusty dusty fax machine we‚Äôve had since 1987. We‚Äôre real cavemen here at Lou‚Äôs. Our 24/7 emergency service still runs off a pager. Every invoice is handwritten. And to top it all off. One computer in the business. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs just so the old bat, who‚Äôs been the secretary here since before I was born, can go on Facebook and watch some porn. She‚Äôs a really pleasant lady.

And that was it for what old Bill had to say, he grabbed a coffee and went back to his office.

‚ÄúSo Darryl, what do you have for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember Frank?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrank Sinatra?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Farmer Frank, your best buddy.‚Äù

I do not remember who farmer Frank is and how he‚Äôs my best buddy, but Darryl is sure every client is our best buddy.

‚ÄúOkay, what‚Äôs going on at my buddy‚Äôs place?‚Äù

‚ÄúHis wood furnace went out, he tried to fix it himself but couldn‚Äôt do anything to help his situation.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy am I going there? This sounds like a job for the heating crew.‚Äù

Though I know how to do this sort of work, I‚Äôm more on the installing boilers, large new construction projects and plumbing service repairs side of things.

‚ÄúHe asked for you, he‚Äôs been getting us to work on that thing for years. You may have worked on it too. It‚Äôs a piece of shit. Johnny services it every year. Get some info from him about it before you head there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd take Mini Zeke with you. Can‚Äôt leave the boy sheltered all day and I can‚Äôt send him with Turd.‚Äù

We all looked at Lou the Turd, he was scratching himself furiously and muttering under his breath. He didn‚Äôt hear what Darryl said.

*He hears everything.*

I wrangled up Mini Zeke and we walked over to our other shop to talk with the head of the heating crew, Johnny.

He‚Äôs a wizard. He can look at a system that‚Äôs just a mess and solve it in about 5 minutes. So when I spoke with him about farmer Franks, his response was‚Ä¶

Interesting.

‚ÄúJohnny boy, Farmer Frank called, said his wood boiler was on the fritz again. Darryl said you would have some ideas.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the fuck are you going there? I told Lou to never go back there,‚Äù he said angrily.

‚ÄúGreedy fucker.‚Äù

‚ÄúLou never listens when we tell him anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt that fucking right. Last I was there was bout a year ago. That‚Äôs an original Angel Fire Furnace. Fuckers never worked quite right. You can adjust the flame all you like but there‚Äôs never enough heat coming out of them.‚Äù I remembered an old Angel Fire Furnace commercial from when I was a teen. Some guy was dressed poorly in an Angel costume, holding a flaming sword for some reason. At the end of the commercial he always said, ‚ÄúBecause when hell freezes over, only an Angle Fire furnace will keep you warm.‚Äù

I chuckled at that.

‚ÄúWhatcha laughing about boy?‚Äù

‚ÄúRemember the old Angel Fire commercials?‚Äù

‚ÄúFucking stupid commercials. When hell freezes over my ass. Lou was dumb enough to believe that shit.‚Äù

We‚Äôre the only company in the small town, and within a thousand kilometres, that works on and installs Angel Fire Furnaces.

‚ÄúHe gets them for a good deal, and the new units are pretty damn good from what I hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt work on these pieces of shit every day, they haven‚Äôt changed. Sure they‚Äôve gotten smaller, more ‚Äòefficient‚Äô, but they still have the same problem. Not enough heat. I can get Lou to oversize the one he sells to the next idiot that walks in, but I know that next winter we‚Äôll get the call saying it‚Äôs too cold. Lou‚Äôs pretty good at telling them to wear a blanket and giving them the same old spiel. ‚ÄúNobody makes a furnace for our weather, it‚Äôs -50 some days, and 30 above the next.‚Äù He‚Äôs right when you‚Äôre dealing with Angel Fire, but the new furnaces they‚Äôre selling at the supplier they‚Äôre great. The only issue is that they get too hot‚Ä¶‚Äù he trailed off.

‚ÄúSo what do you figure is wrong with Frank‚Äôs? Bad pump? Broken line? Air shutters are closed?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, Franks a smart old fucker, he‚Äôd have checked that. He only calls if he can‚Äôt figure it out.‚Äù

Johnny paused for a second. The room suddenly became chilly. He spoke in a harsh voice much quieter than normal.

‚ÄúI reckon it‚Äôs the burner box, there‚Äôs a thermal reset switch inside. The switch is supposed to shut down the unit if it gets too hot, but I‚Äôve only ever changed one in 40 years.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo why do you think it‚Äôs that then?‚Äù

‚ÄúCause Farmer Franks was where I changed it, and that‚Äôs why I told Lou never to go back to that thing.‚Äù

*When Hell freezes over, only Angel Fire will keep you warm.*

So with that Mini Zeke and I grabbed a thermal reset switch from Lou‚Äôs part warehouse and headed out to Franks.

It was about an hour and a half drive through the country with our shitty work van. Thanks, Lou, bald tires, broken windshield, the clock didn‚Äôt work for shit and rear-wheel drive in winter in Canada. At least the heater works. After getting the van stuck and shovelling it out for another hour we arrived at Franks.

‚ÄúOh yeah, I‚Äôve been here before, a long time ago. I think I was with Bob. No, it was Bill. This was just after the plant shut down and Bob started at Lou‚Äôs. Holy shit that was almost 2 decades ago.‚Äù

Mini shot me a look, I could see the fear creeping towards his eyes.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk about The Plant.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry Mini, I forgot about that. Bob brings me back to the beginning of my career. I learned a lot from that guy.‚Äù

We continued to chat as we walked up to the door.

knock knock

After 5 minutes there was no answer. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check the barn‚Äù

As we walked across the yard about 30 or so meters from the house was the furnace. They‚Äôre big units. Big enough to get rid of a few bodies we always joked.

They are a metal shed with a steel door about a meter by a meter. You open the door and throw wood inside. You turn the fan up at the back to get more heat out of it and a pump moves a combination of water and antifreeze around the outside to heat the home. Simple units really.

‚ÄúThat must be Frank,‚Äù Mini Zeke pointed towards the barn.

As we walked past the furnace we saw farmer Frank working on a tractor.

‚ÄúHey, Frank!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, how are you now boys?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood and you?‚Äù Me and Mini said at the same time.

‚ÄúBetter since you two are here.‚Äù

Farmer Frank looks to be in his 70‚Äôs, still spry for an old fella.

*Tic toc, tic toc.*

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with the damn thing, I can‚Äôt get it to light, I can‚Äôt get the pump to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe and Mini will take a look to see if we can get you some heat for tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood luck boys‚Äù

Me and Mini walked back to the furnace. Hopeful because as Frank mentioned he couldn‚Äôt get it to light meaning the fire was out. I could‚Äôve sworn there was smoke coming out of the chimney though. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.

‚ÄúWell Mini, want to try the thermal reset?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you said there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs the thermal reset.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, is it possible I was wrong and there‚Äôs only one way to cut power to the entire system and it‚Äôs through that reset, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell yea, but you? Wrong? Not you. Never you,‚Äù he says as a smirk appears on his face. ‚ÄúSmart ass‚Äù

Mini and I opened the door to the furnace to find no fire, but curiously also no thermal reset. ‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Mini. Can you ask Frank if he‚Äôs got a manual for this thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

As Mini went to find Frank again, I went to pull the van closer to the furnace. After I did that I grabbed my portable flashlight, some rags, vinegar and an air compressor. I grabbed my diesel heater and fired it up to thaw the vinegar and keep my hands from freezing as I cleaned and looked for that reset.

I saw Mini walking back a few minutes later. ‚ÄúSo does he have anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúSays he might have it in his attic. He‚Äôll come over if he finds it.‚Äù

As we waited, we began cleaning the creosote and soot out of the burner box. We got it about half cleaned before we heard farmer Frank walking up to us.

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the manual boys.‚Äù

He handed me a tome. An actual tome. Leatherbound with parchment paper in between the bindings. It‚Äôs said on the front cover Angel Fire Model No. 4. It had the old Angel Fire logo under the title. I always found it odd. It was a larger circle to the left of a square opening. Lou said it was about some old story from an ancient book. Strange, he never mentioned what the book was called though. I blew the dust off of it.

*4 days, 4 temptations, 4 bodies.*

‚ÄúThanks, Frank‚Äù

Frank walked back to his tractor

‚ÄúAlright Mini, keep cleaning, I‚Äôm going to sit in the van and read a bit more about this furnace. Come grab me if you need me‚Äù

‚ÄúMust be nice, sit in the heat and I‚Äôll stay out here and freeze.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt have been a smart ass then.‚Äù

I laughed and walked to the van. I opened the manual to a strange scene. The first page was a picture of the wood boiler. The second page was a table of contents, but it had 4 horses at each corner of the page. Looking at these pages, I felt cold. Colder than the outside of the van.

*When hell freezes over.*

I skimmed the table of contents and found what I was looking for.

IV. MAINTENANCE & TROUBLESHOOTING I flipped to page four and skimmed until I found a picture of where the thermal reset was supposed to be located.

‚ÄúHow the fuck did Johnny change that?‚Äù I jumped as Mini was banging on my window. I rolled it down.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, buddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook.‚Äù

He handed me a dog tag, it said Sadie. I flipped it over and on the back, it read Frank 555-387-6223 and under that, a name looked as if it had been scratched out with a razor blade.

‚ÄúYea?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found it in the furnace.‚Äù

He paused

‚ÄúUnderneath it was the thermal reset switch.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong Mini?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt felt warm when I grabbed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúFurnace could‚Äôve still been holding some heat.‚Äù I reassured him.

‚ÄúSure. That‚Äôs why the vinegar was freezing when I was spraying it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go talk to Frank about it. Don‚Äôt worry, just finish up cleaning and we can swap the reset and go home. It‚Äôs getting late.‚Äù

I‚Äôd started to notice the sun getting lower since I sat in the van. It felt like we only got here an hour ago. Guess it‚Äôs just my imagination. It must‚Äôve taken longer to get here than I thought.

‚ÄúFucking Lou should‚Äôve gotten that damn clock fixed a year ago when I told him.‚Äù

Customers don‚Äôt like it when I bill them off a sundial.

I got out of the van and started walking towards where Frank was.

‚ÄúHey Frank, I think your dog lost their tag.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dog?‚Äù He solemnly chuckled

‚ÄúSadie died last week, I put her down behind the barn. Then I sent her back to god.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to hear that Frank. What do you mean sent her back to god?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, cremated her in the furnace, didn‚Äôt want to mention it, it was private. Now since you brought me her tag, I guess the cats out of the bag or the dogs out of the furnace.‚Äù

He laughed sadly again.

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt help noticing, but the‚Ä¶‚Äù Frank chuckled softly and interrupted me.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my wife. She went missing last year‚Ä¶ the police think she may have wandered off into the woods and froze to death. Never found her though.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry to hear that again Frank.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, she wasn‚Äôt herself anymore. Dementia got her. Muttering and talking to herself at the end. That wasn‚Äôt my wife, it was a husk with a survival instinct. I‚Äôm sorry to dump all this on you kiddo. I‚Äôll let you get back to work.‚Äù

He took the dog tag, put it in his pocket and walked away.

I walked back to the furnace. The sun was almost setting.

‚ÄúHuh, must‚Äôve been a longer chat than I thought.‚Äù

Mini was covered in soot.

‚ÄúHey Mini, are you running for office with that face?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù He said curtly

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong buddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI just want this job to be done. I want to go home.‚Äù

I looked into the furnace. It was spotless. And right in the middle was the hatch for the thermal reset. I saw how Johnny fixed it. ‚ÄúDamn, he just cut that hatch off and put a piece of sheet metal over it with some self-tapping screws.‚Äù

I grabbed my drill, pulled out the screws and there it was. The thermal reset switch. ‚ÄúMini, grab me a set of needle nose pliers.‚Äù The switch was held in with a snap ring. Mini handed me the pliers.

‚ÄúThat was easy. Got the new one?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù

And with that, it was in.

‚ÄúMini, grab me a flashlight, it's getting dark.‚Äù As he did that I started grabbing some firewood and fire started from the wood shed.

‚ÄúMini, fill it about a quarter way and light it. I‚Äôll go fire on the pumps inside.‚Äù

Mini nodded.

As I walked to the house I started feeling cold.

I walked back out to the furnace, it was pitch black out.

‚ÄúHuh, didn‚Äôt think that walk was very long. Must‚Äôve been my imagination.‚Äù

Mini was sitting in the van writing up the bill. I walked up and knocked on his window.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fucking creep up and scare me like that, you‚Äôve done that four times already.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you're going crazy buddy, here I‚Äôll take the bill and tell Frank he‚Äôs all good.‚Äù

*Frank and Beverly sitting in a tree, B-U-R-N-I-N-G.*

I turned around and saw the furnace door open with a violent orange glow emanating from inside. I saw a shadow in front of the door. I saw the shadow climb into the inviting glow.

*And close the door.*

I shouted

‚ÄúFRANK!‚Äù

I ran to the furnace. I threw open the door. The fire had gone out. Sitting on the hatch I had just opened was a simple gold wedding band with F & B in cursive script. I grabbed it instinctually.

It was ice cold.

1m02k0l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m02k0l,2009 - 2010 Goretti Tenebris ZR Diavolo Rosso,"Certainly. Here's a **Top Gear‚Äìstyle** review of the **Goretti Tenebris ZR Diavolo Rosso** ‚Äî dramatic, irreverent, and gloriously over-the-top:

**Some say** it was forged in the volcanic heart of Mount Etna. That its exposed carbon weave is dyed not with pigment, but with the blood of terrified track marshals. All we know is... it‚Äôs called the **Goretti Tenebris ZR Diavolo Rosso**.

Now, let‚Äôs clear something up. This isn‚Äôt a road car. This is not something you drive to the coffee shop to impress people who say ‚Äúnice car‚Äù but secretly think you‚Äôre compensating for something. No. This... this is a track-only, no-compromises, noise-before-niceties, carbon-clad lunatic asylum on wheels.

Underneath the glistening crimson weave ‚Äî a sort of *dark metallic red exposed carbon fiber* that looks like the devil himself got bored and learned composite engineering ‚Äî lies a brutal naturally aspirated **M120 V12**. That‚Äôs right. None of your hybrid fluff, no turbos, no torque-fill, no artificially enhanced fake exhaust notes. Just **760 horsepower** of old-school fury, wrapped up in something that weighs **just 1,070 kilos**.

That‚Äôs about the same as a Mazda MX-5. If the MX-5 had been trained by the Italian mafia, dipped in hellfire, and given a chainsaw for a voice.

Inside, there‚Äôs... well, very little. No infotainment. No air-con. Just a steering wheel, a fire extinguisher, and the sort of seat that leaves your spine looking like a 3D relief map of the Dolomites. Everything is laser-focused on lap times. It doesn‚Äôt want to entertain you. It wants to **terrify you into greatness**.

The Goretti doesn‚Äôt so much go round corners as *attack* them. It has aerodynamics that wouldn‚Äôt look out of place on a Group C Le Mans car. The front splitter could slice a baguette. The rear wing is so enormous it could host a barbecue. Downforce? So much that at full speed, it could probably drive upside-down ‚Äî though Goretti won‚Äôt let us test that. Cowards.

And the noise. Oh, the noise. It revs like a cathedral organ on cocaine. A screaming, howling, wailing operatic death song that tells everyone within a 10-mile radius that something wicked this way comes. It‚Äôs not loud. It‚Äôs biblical.

So what is it, really? It‚Äôs not a car. It‚Äôs a weapon. A blood-red missile for the terminally unhinged. A track tool so singular in its purpose, so exquisitely unbothered by things like comfort, emissions, or mercy, that it doesn‚Äôt even *pretend* to be sensible. It is, unapologetically, **Diavolo Rosso** ‚Äî the Red Devil.

Before Adderall, my brain felt like a little boat right at the edge of a waterfall. I was always trying to stay in place, but the current (aka distractions) would grab me and whoosh‚ÄîI‚Äôd plunge off the edge. Once that happened, my thoughts would spiral, scatter, or crash in all directions. It wasn‚Äôt just being distracted‚Äîit was chaotic, and hard to pull myself back.

Today, on Adderall, it feels like the boat is still moving, but now it‚Äôs floating on a calm lake. It still drifts, but the chaos is gone. I‚Äôm not anchored yet‚Äîbut at least I‚Äôm not fighting to stay alive every second.

It‚Äôs a strange mix: a bit of focus, a bit of mental stillness, and some sleepiness, kind of like when I drank coffee (have quit coffee for two years due to bupropion).

For context, here‚Äôs my current med and supplement stack:

Daily meds (taken with breakfast):

	‚Ä¢	Bupropion SR 150mg ‚Äì been on this for a year
	‚Ä¢	Buspirone 7.5mg twice a day ‚Äì helps me stay more even emotionally

Supplements:

	‚Ä¢	Magnesium L-Threonate ‚Äì this one‚Äôs a hidden gem for me; feels like a subtle focus boost, like a +50mg to bupropion
	‚Ä¢	L-theanine + Ashwagandha KSM-66 ‚Äì makes me noticeably less annoyed by people/sounds/things; if I skip it, I‚Äôm basically always irritated due to asd.
	‚Ä¢	Fish oil (1000mg, about 600mg epa) ‚Äì haven‚Äôt noticed much, but I keep taking it because people say it is helpful.

I volunteered to develop the initial plan and spent several days carefully putting together a detailed proposal‚Äîcovering timelines, risks, and tool options. It reminded me of how peeling the little stickers off fresh fruit requires patience and attention to detail, much like crafting a thorough project plan where every small element matters. Sometimes, it feels like the traffic lights on my commute are perfectly timed to test my patience‚Äîkind of like this situation, where despite my effort, things didn‚Äôt go smoothly.

Before the team meeting, I shared my work with a coworker I generally get along with, hoping for some feedback. It brought to mind my grandmother making popcorn on the stove; she would always say, ‚ÄúListen carefully or you‚Äôll burn it.‚Äù Waiting for those kernels to pop is a lot like waiting for recognition‚Äîsmall signs that something‚Äôs working, but also the risk that it might all fall flat if you‚Äôre not careful. Just like when I‚Äôm taking notes during meetings, the right tools and attention make all the difference in capturing what really matters.

At the meeting, my coworker presented my exact plan as his own, without changing the wording or structure. Our manager praised him highly, unaware it was my work. It‚Äôs strange, because sometimes in the office, people treat coffee like a sacred ritual‚Äîchoosing just the right mug or adding the perfect amount of cream‚Äîto find comfort amidst chaos. I thought teamwork was supposed to be about sharing credit, but this felt more like being overlooked entirely.

When I confronted him afterward, he brushed it off, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs teamwork.‚Äù That response left me feeling invisible and frustrated, much like when I try to bake bread and it just won‚Äôt rise no matter how much effort I put in. I‚Äôve also been considering taking up knitting to calm my nerves‚Äîthere‚Äôs something about creating something with your own hands that feels grounding when things get stressful.

Now, I‚Äôm thinking about whether to raise this with HR. I have emails showing I was the original author, but I worry about being seen as difficult or harming the team dynamic. I keep comparing it to caring for office plants‚Äîtoo much or too little attention can make them wither, just like people need proper respect and acknowledgment to thrive. And to distract myself, I often listen to trivia podcasts‚Äîthey‚Äôre a good reminder that sometimes unexpected things can be valuable, just like this project should be recognized properly.

1m02gmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1m02gmm/i_was_gifted_a_discovery_set_from_spathe/,"I was gifted a discovery set from Spathe Botanicals, a canadian indie house, these are my thoughts.","First of all, I want to give HUGE thanks to Dyllan Himbeault for this gift, he¬¥s the creator and the nose behind these amazing 4 scents that I got to know today.

  
He contacted me directly and just so you know, this was a pure act of kindness that derived from him reading one of my reviews and enjoying it, I am not an influencer, this is not a paid review, I don't do review videos or any other perfume related content, I'm merely passionate about scents and love sharing my thoughts and impressions about perfumes with other scentheads, so let's get to my most honest review about the 4 perfumes that [SPATHE](https://spathe.ca/) has created so far.

I'll add from the start, all of his perfumes are have phthalates, parabens, synthetic dyes,¬†formaldehyde, petrochemical products, or forever chemicals and are Vegan-friendly & Cruelty-free. 

2 of them support 2 different charities too, that's very kind of them, you'll see more details on their website.

  
[Colourblind](https://spathe.ca/product/colourblind/) \- **This is the description in the website:** From our birth we are taught that lineage and bloodline should rule our behaviour, our choices, our clemency. We forgive family for things that we would never dream of doing to another person, simply because they derive their blood from the same ancestral well.

Colourblind is a perfume that challenges that notion. The colour red being the basis of this mixture; combining different species of beautiful smelling flowers into a single bouquet, dialed up to the extreme to exemplify floral violence. Adding the element of beeswax, to symbolize the noble honey bee‚Äôs indiscriminate pollination of flowers, regardless of genus or colour.¬† And the warmth of honey representing the escape from abuse.

This perfume is¬†floral, honeyed, intense, ripe.

  
**My thoughts:** I started with this one because regarding the declared notes, I thought this would be the one that I liked the least but I was wrong, I'm usually not a big fan of florals but this type of floral is really soothing, and I also feel like most floral scents are usually kind of warm, and dry, but this one feels a little fresh, kind of like green type of fresh, as if you were actually in a flower bazaar, and not just receiving a bouquet of already cut flowers, this smells like whole flowers with their stems and all and they're EVERYWHERE, honestly as soon as I sprayed it I was like WOAH, because this perfume PROJECTS like crazy, it's in my opinion very rose oriented, and I feel like there's definitely some other type of flowers there but I can't precisely tell, maybe violets or honeysuckle, Dyllan did say tho that his perfumes are not usually for everyone and I think that¬¥s true, it¬¥s a different type of floral, but if you know you know.

I was completely amazed by the projection and the intensity of the floral notes when it came out of the bottle, when Spathe said it was a VIOLENT floral it really is, it¬¥s by far the most floral perfume I¬¥ve ever smelled, and I¬¥ve smelled a LOT, I would rate it a 7/10 but I could go to 7.5/10 if I keep exploring it, altho, I gifted it to my mother because she loves florals and she was surprised by how accurate the rose scent is in this perfume, she loved it.

  
[Voyageurs](https://spathe.ca/product/voyageurs/) \- **This is the description in the website:** 17th and 18th century Canadians, hardened by the brutal unforgiving nature of the north, who against all odds formed the routes that became our roads. These hardy travelers gave rise to folklore and music that acknowledged their strength and endurance, and are still celebrated to this day.

Growing up in Winnipeg Manitoba, Festival du Voyageurs, which was celebrated every year, was an impactful memory for me. A few important smells bring me back to those times: Visiting my grandmother‚Äôs house in the winter, fresh cut vegetables for stew, and tourti√®re; Maple sugar, around the woody smell of old Fort Gibraltar in the winter.¬† This perfume, which I formulated over nearly 100 different trials, is intended to capture that memory in scent form, and I believe is distinctly French Canadian.

This perfume is¬†spicy, green, sweet, and musky.

  
**My thoughts:** When it came out, the first 2 things I smelled were celery, and some spice, I'm thinking it was cumin but I'm not sure, I'm honestly amazed by the bravery here, because this perfume, TRULY, 100% smells, like soup, or stew, now, that's not a bad thing for me, I work as a cook, and I love cooking, I naturally gravitate towards perfumes with scents based around edible stuff, I love spiced perfumes, or fruit perfumes, citrics, etc, BUT, I would personally not use this one, not because it's bad, but because of my context, I live in Mexico, in a really really HOT weather, smelling so much like vegetable soup maybe is not the best thing here BUT I am DYING to try it during our short but very cold winter, it's going to feel like a hug, it's going to feel like warmth, because yes, even tho this is definitely fresh celery and coriander,  this feels very warm, there's some dryness to it, it's not particularly super fresh, AND the component that seems to be tying these things together is pine, or pinecone, for me it smells like pinecone, celery, coriander and some spice which I can not detect, and what ALSO amazed me about this perfume is how long it stays smelling the same, I sprayed it on me about 1 hour ago and I can already tell this is going to last a LONG time, so, projection is really good and duration is going to be amazing probably. I sence something citric about it too every once in a while. Sadly, this was actually my least favorite, with a 6/10 but I would probably give it 6.5 once I get to know it better and I try it out on a better weather.

  
[Manitou](https://spathe.ca/product/manitou/) \- **This is the description in the website:** Manitou is the spiritual and fundamental life force in the theologies of Algonquian peoples. It is omnipresent and manifests everywhere: organisms, the environment, events, everything and everywhere. I was taught loosely of Manitou by my late friend, Erich (rest in peace, Erich), who was born and raised on a reservation across the border in Michigan. He also spoke at length about the great loss of life and well being for thousands of Indigenous women and children not only in the United States, but in Canada as well. For the better part of a decade his stories have echoed in my mind. This perfume is an answer to those feelings of helplessness for a people that I feel a connection with through one of my passed, best friends, and through my own Metis heritage.

The Medicine Wheel is used as a holistic teaching tool. It consists of four quadrants that relate to the cardinal directions: East, South, West, and North. Each direction is represented by specific teachings and emblems, such as four colours, four seasons, and the four stage of life. The circle symbolizes and resembles many cycles in the natural world and is a symbol of equity. There are four Sacred Medicines: Tobacco, cedar, sage, and sweetgrass. All four of these ingredients have been used in this perfume, in addition to some scents that speak true to native tradition and heritage. Lavender being a large part of that, as well, patchouli being widely used on ceremonial garb during Powwow. Additionally, 50% of the core formula for the perfume have been sourced from indigenous suppliers in Canada.

This perfume is¬†woody, sticky, heady, and floral.

  
**My thoughts:** I was very excited to smell this one and it really did not disappoint, It took me back to when I was a kid and my grandmother would take me to a traditional medicine shop here in Mexico, I would always smell sage and tobacco, although I feel like the main protagonist of this perfume is pathouli, good news because I LOVE patchouli, I have noticed through my perfume journey that when a perfume declares pethricor and also declares patchouli, the drydown of the patchouli is going to enhance that pethricor scent greatly and that's precisely what is happening to my wrist right now hahaha, this smelled like entering a traditional, herbal medicine shop, getting your things and as it dries down you're walking home back through a cold and rainy forest, it is the freshest of the 4 perfumes here and I am probably going to use this for the next weeks of insane heat here in my hometown, I enjoyed this greatly, and I can tell that this all REALLY smells natural, it's not synthetic at all, which is immensely appreciated since I usually HATE it, when a perfume projects insanely well but it's mostly synthetic notes, it feels weird in my opinion, that's also another really good thing I would say about them, they project really good, BUT they don't become annoying because they're really 100% natural scents, they feel like stuff that is supposed to be smelled if that makes any sense. I really liked this one and I would give it an 8/10 which might go up to 8.5 as I use it.

  
[Fugitives](https://spathe.ca/product/fugitives/) \- **This is the description in the website:** The forces that rule this world, now more than ever, manipulate the weight of power and profit to stake their seat at the top of the pile. The way some groups use the guise of faith to take, and take from people who are truly in need; wage wars; disempower others. They use this wealth to build opulent, distasteful monuments with the intention only to lure in more lost souls in the hopes of emptying their pockets. This has been a reality for centuries. Now in our current age of techno-feudalism, the church of the billionaire is the current heel that we live under. Some of us, more than others, are forced to set our own integrity aside to avoid being crushed under it‚Äôs weight.

  
Fugitives is a perfume that represents meditation even in these times of ambiguous moral catechism. With notes of morning coffee; the nearly universal source of fuel for the downtrodden. Paired with the rich scent of burning church incense, and the woody must of pews; a positive reminder that in the midst of greed, you can always see some good.

  
This perfume is¬†smokey, phenolic, rich, sweet.

  
**My thoughts:** Alright I saved the best for the last, ever since I saw the notes that this perfume declare, I was excited to smell it, and I can tell you that it blew my mind, I'm not being exaggerated, I was leaning forward as I sprayed it and my whole body reacted to it and It was taken back, I didn't know someone could capture my memories so well and put them in a bottle, this instantly took me back to when I was a kid and my mother used to take me to church, but really this doesn't smell like any church, it smells like a whole cathedral, it smells BIG on the incense, as I sprayed it, incense was immediately present in my whole room, and it's a very particular type of incense the one that they use in churches and this perfectly captured that, the church pews notes were also insanely surprising because I swear, they are 100% accurate, I can't imagine what kind of chemistry was done here because it really is the most photorealistic scent I have ever smelled, there's only 1 thing missing tho, it declares coffee, and that, sadly, I am not getting, I don't know if I'm simply overwhelmed by the other 2 notes or that they're just too strong against the coffee but I really can't smell it, I will say tho that the sweetness in this fragrance, kind of reminds me of a sweet coffee that's prepared here in Mexico, and that made this perfume a nostalgia bomb for me, it's called ""Caf√© de Olla"" which literally means Pot coffee, and it's prepared by boiling coffee with raw cane sugar, anise, cinnamon and sometimes orange zest, but the sweetness in the raw cane sugar and anise mix is what I'm feeling here. I give this perfume a 9.5/10 only because I truly wish it would smell a little bit more like coffee, because I'm a coffee addict lol, but I will definitely finish this bottle soon because I truly loved it, it's an amazing creation.

  
**BRAND OVERVIEW:** Spathe Botanicals amazed me with the photorealism in their scents, when they say it smells like something it truly does mostly smell like that thing, but I feel like they're also putting some extra hidden ingredients that give these perfumes some type of edge and I LOVE when brands do that, I get bored quickly when a perfume is too telling but all 4 of these have evolved pretty interestingly as I was writing this review, I will most probably be buying a full bottle of Fugitives as soon as I monetarily can and I can't thank Dyllan Himbeault enough for this amazing gift. I would generally not guide a new scenthead to this house, because it's definitely not the most, mass appealing products, it's not like a CK One who anyone can like or a Bleu de Chanel or Chanel no. 5 you know, they're a more alternative brand, people with a bit more experience might be interested in it but if you're completely new to fragrances, you might think they're a bit odd, but that's precisely what I personally loved about them.

He contacted me directly and just so you know, this was a pure act of kindness that derived from him reading one of my reviews and enjoying it, I am not an influencer, this is not a paid review, I don't do review videos or any other perfume related content, I'm merely passionate about scents and love sharing my thoughts and impressions about perfumes with other scentheads, so let's get to my most honest review about the 4 perfumes that [SPATHE](https://spathe.ca/) has created so far.

  
I'll add from the start, all of his perfumes are have phthalates, parabens, synthetic dyes,¬†formaldehyde, petrochemical products, or forever chemicals and are Vegan-friendly & Cruelty-free. 

2 of them support 2 different charities too, that's very kind of them, you'll see more details on their website.

  
[Colourblind](https://spathe.ca/product/colourblind/) \- **This is the description in the website:** From our birth we are taught that lineage and bloodline should rule our behaviour, our choices, our clemency. We forgive family for things that we would never dream of doing to another person, simply because they derive their blood from the same ancestral well.

Colourblind is a perfume that challenges that notion. The colour red being the basis of this mixture; combining different species of beautiful smelling flowers into a single bouquet, dialed up to the extreme to exemplify floral violence. Adding the element of beeswax, to symbolize the noble honey bee‚Äôs indiscriminate pollination of flowers, regardless of genus or colour.¬† And the warmth of honey representing the escape from abuse.

This perfume is¬†floral, honeyed, intense, ripe.

  
**My thoughts:** I started with this one because regarding the declared notes, I thought this would be the one that I liked the least but I was wrong, I'm usually not a big fan of florals but this type of floral is really soothing, and I also feel like most floral scents are usually kind of warm, and dry, but this one feels a little fresh, kind of like green type of fresh, as if you were actually in a flower bazaar, and not just receiving a bouquet of already cut flowers, this smells like whole flowers with their stems and all and they're EVERYWHERE, honestly as soon as I sprayed it I was like WOAH, because this perfume PROJECTS like crazy, it's in my opinion very rose oriented, and I feel like there's definitely some other type of flowers there but I can't precisely tell, maybe violets or honeysuckle, Dyllan did say tho that his perfumes are not usually for everyone and I think that¬¥s true, it¬¥s a different type of floral, but if you know you know.

I was completely amazed by the projection and the intensity of the floral notes when it came out of the bottle, when Spathe said it was a VIOLENT floral it really is, it¬¥s by far the most floral perfume I¬¥ve ever smelled, and I¬¥ve smelled a LOT, I would rate it a 7/10 but I could go to 7.5/10 if I keep exploring it, altho, I gifted it to my mother because she loves florals and she was surprised by how accurate the rose scent is in this perfume, she loved it.

  
[Voyageurs](https://spathe.ca/product/voyageurs/) \- **This is the description in the website:** 17th and 18th century Canadians, hardened by the brutal unforgiving nature of the north, who against all odds formed the routes that became our roads. These hardy travelers gave rise to folklore and music that acknowledged their strength and endurance, and are still celebrated to this day.

Growing up in Winnipeg Manitoba, Festival du Voyageurs, which was celebrated every year, was an impactful memory for me. A few important smells bring me back to those times: Visiting my grandmother‚Äôs house in the winter, fresh cut vegetables for stew, and tourti√®re; Maple sugar, around the woody smell of old Fort Gibraltar in the winter.¬† This perfume, which I formulated over nearly 100 different trials, is intended to capture that memory in scent form, and I believe is distinctly French Canadian.

This perfume is¬†spicy, green, sweet, and musky.

  
**My thoughts:** When it came out, the first 2 things I smelled were celery, and some spice, I'm thinking it was cumin but I'm not sure, I'm honestly amazed by the bravery here, because this perfume, TRULY, 100% smells, like soup, or stew, now, that's not a bad thing for me, I work as a cook, and I love cooking, I naturally gravitate towards perfumes with scents based around edible stuff, I love spiced perfumes, or fruit perfumes, citrics, etc, BUT, I would personally not use this one, not because it's bad, but because of my context, I live in Mexico, in a really really HOT weather, smelling so much like vegetable soup maybe is not the best thing here BUT I am DYING to try it during our short but very cold winter, it's going to feel like a hug, it's going to feel like warmth, because yes, even tho this is definitely fresh celery and coriander,  this feels very warm, there's some dryness to it, it's not particularly super fresh, AND the component that seems to be tying these things together is pine, or pinecone, for me it smells like pinecone, celery, coriander and some spice which I can not detect, and what ALSO amazed me about this perfume is how long it stays smelling the same, I sprayed it on me about 1 hour ago and I can already tell this is going to last a LONG time, so, projection is really good and duration is going to be amazing probably. I sence something citric about it too every once in a while. Sadly, this was actually my least favorite, with a 6/10 but I would probably give it 6.5 once I get to know it better and I try it out on a better weather.

  
[Manitou](https://spathe.ca/product/manitou/) \- **This is the description in the website:** Manitou is the spiritual and fundamental life force in the theologies of Algonquian peoples. It is omnipresent and manifests everywhere: organisms, the environment, events, everything and everywhere. I was taught loosely of Manitou by my late friend, Erich (rest in peace, Erich), who was born and raised on a reservation across the border in Michigan. He also spoke at length about the great loss of life and well being for thousands of Indigenous women and children not only in the United States, but in Canada as well. For the better part of a decade his stories have echoed in my mind. This perfume is an answer to those feelings of helplessness for a people that I feel a connection with through one of my passed, best friends, and through my own Metis heritage.

The Medicine Wheel is used as a holistic teaching tool. It consists of four quadrants that relate to the cardinal directions: East, South, West, and North. Each direction is represented by specific teachings and emblems, such as four colours, four seasons, and the four stage of life. The circle symbolizes and resembles many cycles in the natural world and is a symbol of equity. There are four Sacred Medicines: Tobacco, cedar, sage, and sweetgrass. All four of these ingredients have been used in this perfume, in addition to some scents that speak true to native tradition and heritage. Lavender being a large part of that, as well, patchouli being widely used on ceremonial garb during Powwow. Additionally, 50% of the core formula for the perfume have been sourced from indigenous suppliers in Canada.

This perfume is¬†woody, sticky, heady, and floral.

  
**My thoughts:** I was very excited to smell this one and it really did not disappoint, It took me back to when I was a kid and my grandmother would take me to a traditional medicine shop here in Mexico, I would always smell sage and tobacco, although I feel like the main protagonist of this perfume is pathouli, good news because I LOVE patchouli, I have noticed through my perfume journey that when a perfume declares pethricor and also declares patchouli, the drydown of the patchouli is going to enhance that pethricor scent greatly and that's precisely what is happening to my wrist right now hahaha, this smelled like entering a traditional, herbal medicine shop, getting your things and as it dries down you're walking home back through a cold and rainy forest, it is the freshest of the 4 perfumes here and I am probably going to use this for the next weeks of insane heat here in my hometown, I enjoyed this greatly, and I can tell that this all REALLY smells natural, it's not synthetic at all, which is immensely appreciated since I usually HATE it, when a perfume projects insanely well but it's mostly synthetic notes, it feels weird in my opinion, that's also another really good thing I would say about them, they project really good, BUT they don't become annoying because they're really 100% natural scents, they feel like stuff that is supposed to be smelled if that makes any sense. I really liked this one and I would give it an 8/10 which might go up to 8.5 as I use it.

  
[Fugitives](https://spathe.ca/product/fugitives/) \- **This is the description in the website:** The forces that rule this world, now more than ever, manipulate the weight of power and profit to stake their seat at the top of the pile. The way some groups use the guise of faith to take, and take from people who are truly in need; wage wars; disempower others. They use this wealth to build opulent, distasteful monuments with the intention only to lure in more lost souls in the hopes of emptying their pockets. This has been a reality for centuries. Now in our current age of techno-feudalism, the church of the billionaire is the current heel that we live under. Some of us, more than others, are forced to set our own integrity aside to avoid being crushed under it‚Äôs weight.

  
Fugitives is a perfume that represents meditation even in these times of ambiguous moral catechism. With notes of morning coffee; the nearly universal source of fuel for the downtrodden. Paired with the rich scent of burning church incense, and the woody must of pews; a positive reminder that in the midst of greed, you can always see some good.

  
This perfume is¬†smokey, phenolic, rich, sweet.

  
**My thoughts:** Alright I saved the best for the last, ever since I saw the notes that this perfume declare, I was excited to smell it, and I can tell you that it blew my mind, I'm not being exaggerated, I was leaning forward as I sprayed it and my whole body reacted to it and It was taken back, I didn't know someone could capture my memories so well and put them in a bottle, this instantly took me back to when I was a kid and my mother used to take me to church, but really this doesn't smell like any church, it smells like a whole cathedral, it smells BIG on the incense, as I sprayed it, incense was immediately present in my whole room, and it's a very particular type of incense the one that they use in churches and this perfectly captured that, the church pews notes were also insanely surprising because I swear, they are 100% accurate, I can't imagine what kind of chemistry was done here because it really is the most photorealistic scent I have ever smelled, there's only 1 thing missing tho, it declares coffee, and that, sadly, I am not getting, I don't know if I'm simply overwhelmed by the other 2 notes or that they're just too strong against the coffee but I really can't smell it, I will say tho that the sweetness in this fragrance, kind of reminds me of a sweet coffee that's prepared here in Mexico, and that made this perfume a nostalgia bomb for me, it's called ""Caf√© de Olla"" which literally means Pot coffee, and it's prepared by boiling coffee with raw cane sugar, anise, cinnamon and sometimes orange zest, but the sweetness in the raw cane sugar and anise mix is what I'm feeling here. I give this perfume a 9.5/10 only because I truly wish it would smell a little bit more like coffee, because I'm a coffee addict lol, but I will definitely finish this bottle soon because I truly loved it, it's an amazing creation.

  
**BRAND OVERVIEW:** Spathe Botanicals amazed me with the photorealism in their scents, when they say it smells like something it truly does mostly smell like that thing, but I feel like they're also putting some extra hidden ingredients that give these perfumes some type of edge and I LOVE when brands do that, I get bored quickly when a perfume is too telling but all 4 of these have evolved pretty interestingly as I was writing this review, I will most probably be buying a full bottle of Fugitives as soon as I monetarily can and I can't thank Dyllan Himbeault enough for this amazing gift. I would generally not guide a new scenthead to this house, because it's definitely not the most, mass appealing products, it's not like a CK One who anyone can like or a Bleu de Chanel or Chanel no. 5 you know, they're a more alternative brand, people with a bit more experience might be interested in it but if you're completely new to fragrances, you might think they're a bit odd, but that's precisely what I personally loved about them.

Part 1","I‚Äôm not sure who this will reach, or when. I just need to write it down ‚Äî while it still feels like time is passing the way it used to.

My name‚Äôs PFC Emily Carson. I grew up in Kansas ‚Äî the part where the cows have more personality than most of your graduating class, and nobody locks their doors because there‚Äôs nothing worth stealing.

I‚Äôve got a boyfriend back home. We don‚Äôt talk as much as we used to ‚Äî he wasn‚Äôt thrilled about me joining the Army.

My folks weren‚Äôt either. Too rough, too dangerous, too male. Which, yeah ‚Äî fair. But I wasn‚Äôt exactly thrilled about four more years of lectures and student debts either.

So when I met a recruiter my senior year of high school, I told him I was interested in joining the Army. Next thing I knew, I landed an infantry slot. Yeah, it‚Äôs not the usual path for a girl ‚Äî but I accepted the challenge.

\---

¬†¬†I just got to my first unit three weeks ago, a light infantry battalion at a mid-sized base somewhere CONUS. I won‚Äôt say which ‚Äî OPSEC and all that.

I came straight out of OSUT at Benning. I‚Äôm new. Like so new I still double-check the uniform regs before I go to the PX.¬†

¬†Still figuring everything out. I just got assigned my permanent room in the barracks, still don‚Äôt know where half the buildings are. I‚Äôve only been on a ruck once with the unit. Still feel like I‚Äôm in-processing.

So when I got assigned CQ runner for the first time, I took it seriously. Uniform was squared away. Got there 15 minutes early.¬†

The CQ desk was just inside the front entrance of the Alpha Company barracks ‚Äî an older, red-brick three-story with flickering hallway lights and scuffed floors.¬†

But it was a pretty standard building. It housed the sleeping bays, laundry rooms, latrines, and¬† the company office and arms room.¬†

¬†It was our responsibility to monitor the building overnight: sign-ins, emergencies, random late-night issues.¬†

My NCO for the shift was a Staff Sergeant. I‚Äôll just call him SSG M. He‚Äôs got prior deployments, CIB badge ‚Äî Iraq, Afghanistan. Definitely the infantry type. The kind who doesn‚Äôt smile much. Gruff. Real squared away.

‚ÄúYou the new cherry?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHooah, Staff Sergeant.‚Äù¬†

*It still sounds strange coming out of my mouth, but it‚Äôs what they expect.*

¬†He gave me a basic brief ‚Äî no sleeping, rounds every hour, write down who comes in and out, don‚Äôt touch the phone unless it rings more than once, etc.

Then he handed me the binder.

Not the CQ log ‚Äî I mean another binder. Gray. Beat to hell. No unit crest, no name. Just duct tape on the spine and and someone had sharpied a handwritten label:¬†

**‚ÄúUNOFFICIAL NIGHT ORDERS ‚Äì A CO. CQ ONLY‚Äù**

¬†*Do not share. Do not retype. Do not bring up to anyone above E-6.*

‚ÄúThese are the¬†**Unofficial Rules for Overnight CQ**. Just‚Ä¶ read them. Don‚Äôt make it a thing. You‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù

I wondered if these rules had been around longer than anyone cared to admit ‚Äî passed down quietly, from one runner to the next.

When I opened the binder, I expected maybe some standard duty instructions, but the first page didn‚Äôt look like anything I‚Äôd seen before in regulation binders. There was¬† no formatting or signature block. Just a list of rules, numbered, written in what looked like three or four different kinds of handwriting.

\---



**Rule 1**¬†said to **lock the front doors between 2245 and 2255** ‚Äî even though the official policy said to keep them open until shift change. That caught me off guard, but I figured these must be the real rules, passed down quietly.

I glanced up at the clock ‚Äî 2247. Time to lock the doors, even if it meant locking out anyone who wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here.

**Rule 2**¬†warned me **not to sit** in the NCOIC‚Äôs chair between midnight and 1 a.m. Something about the cameras glitching during that hour. I thought about how uncomfortable standing for an hour straight would be, but I didn‚Äôt want to test it.

The strangest one was¬†**Rule 3**: at 0137, the front door might unlock itself. The note said to let it happen and not to approach. I scoffed at that ‚Äî¬†*what kind of prank was this?*

**Rule 4**¬†said to **ignore footsteps above the second floor during 0200 rounds.** The third floor had been sealed off since the fire in 2016. I shivered, imagining whispers and dragging sounds I wasn‚Äôt supposed to hear.

**By Rule 5**, I was starting to feel on edge: **don‚Äôt answer the landline after 0300**, even if it rings. If it stops on the fourth ring, walk the bay quietly and count the doors with name tags and lights underneath. There would be one that was missing its tag, and it would feel colder than the rest. I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to find it.

At 0333, the fire alarm might chirp once.¬†**Rule 6**¬†said **not to pull the alarm even if I smelled smoke, and to stay inside.** That made no sense ‚Äî but these weren‚Äôt normal rules.

**Rule 7**¬†had to be about imposters ‚Äî anyone in PTs or civilian clothes asking to check the duty roster had to show their CAC. If the ID didn‚Äôt match their face, the answer was always, **‚ÄúRoster‚Äôs at Battalion, Sergeant.‚Äù** The weirdest part was not to look them in the eyes. Instead, I had to look away and count to fifteen. I wasn‚Äôt sure what kind of game this was.

And¬†**Rule 8**¬†was the worst: if Taps played more than once, stop what I was doing and stand at parade rest. It meant the shift was compromised. Stay still. Wait for the Staff Sergeant to come back and check their boots were regulation before speaking. I swallowed hard just thinking about that.

I looked up after reading it.¬†

That‚Äôs when I started wondering if this was some kind of hazing tradition ‚Äî scare the new private, make her think the barracks are haunted, that kind of thing.

I was expecting the Staff Sergeant to start laughing.

But he kept a straight face. He didn‚Äôt even smirk.¬†

‚ÄúYou got any questions, Private?‚Äù

""Negative, Staff Sergeant.""

""Hooah. Log every half hour. Rounds every hour. You‚Äôll be fine.""

\---

  
**\[FIRST SHIFT\]**

Nothing happened for the first couple hours. I did my rounds. Logged a few Soldiers coming back from the gym. Helped someone who locked themselves out of their room. Pretty standard stuff.

But right around 0137 ‚Äî I swear to God ‚Äî I heard the¬†**click**¬†of the front lock.

Nobody touched it. The door just‚Ä¶ unlatched.

¬†I waited. Thirty seconds later, it opened maybe six inches.

¬†Nobody stepped in.

¬†Then it shut itself, and¬†**locked**¬†again.

I didn‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt say a word. I just turned back to the desk and wrote:

*0138 ‚Äî front door opened, no personnel present.*

At 0200, during rounds, I passed the stairwell and heard footsteps from above me.¬†

I didn‚Äôt go up. Just said what the page told me to.

‚ÄúArea all clear, continuing rounds.‚Äù

I came back to the cq desk and sat down.¬†¬†

Around 0250 the front door knocked once. Just a faint knock like someone trying not to wake the whole barracks. When I went to check there was a soldier in PTs.¬†

¬†He didn‚Äôt look at the camera. He just stared straight ahead like he was standing at attention.¬†

I opened the door maybe six inches.

‚ÄúCan I help you, Sergeant?‚Äù

He was taller than he looked on the camera and he looked down at me.

‚ÄúI need to check the duty roster. Battalion told me I was slotted tonight.‚Äù

That didn‚Äôt make sense. We didn‚Äôt take last-minute walk-ins. Roster was always finalized by COB.

‚ÄúDo you have your CAC?‚Äù I asked.

He handed it over without a word.

The photo on the CAC didn‚Äôt match. Same skin tone, maybe. But this guy had a longer face. Different jaw shape.

I hesitated.

Only for a second.

But then I did something¬† the rule book said¬†**NOT**¬†to do. I looked him in the eyes. Just long enough to see he had dark eyes. I can‚Äôt describe it, but they seemed off. I mean no emotion behind them at all. Just a cold void.¬†

I remembered rule 7‚Äî-¬†*‚ÄúRoster‚Äôs at Battalion, Sergeant.‚Äù*

But it was too late.

I looked away. Counted to fifteen. When I looked up again, he was gone.

The CAC was still in my hand.

But the name and photo had faded to gray.

I shredded it without reading it. Didn‚Äôt log the interaction. Didn‚Äôt say anything.

At 0301 the cq landline rang.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt like a normal ring. It had the kind of ring that sounded like someone was tapping a tuning fork inside my head.¬†

My hand reached for the receiver out of reflex but then I remembered Rule 5

¬†**‚ÄúDo not answer the landline after 0300.‚Äù**

It rang again.

Twice.

After the third ring I started counting without meaning to.¬†*One Mississippi... Two Mississippi...*

It stopped after the fourth ring.¬†

I stepped away from the desk and walked as quietly as I could down the barracks bay. The hallway was dark except maybe for the glow of the exit sign. Each door had a number stenciled above the frame and a plastic name placard bolted beside the handle.

One door cracked open slightly, there was a muffled sound of music inside. I kept walking.¬†

214‚Ä¶ 216‚Ä¶ 218‚Ä¶ Eight rooms total. Seven accounted for.

Room 222 had nothing.

No nameplate.

It was a plain door shut tight.¬† The handle was brushed steel like the others, but it looked untouched ‚Äî like no one had ever opened it.¬†

I stopped in front of it.¬† I didn‚Äôt hear any snoring or any signs that it was occupied. But I felt a faint cold draft, leaking from the edges like the door was breathing in.¬†

Per rule 5, I walked away. I didn‚Äôt knock...

  
I was stiff as hell after that first shift. The Staff Sergeant came back from wherever he was around 0430. He saw the binder open on the desk, and just nodded. Didn‚Äôt say anything.¬†



  
\---

  
**\[ SECOND SHIFT\]**

  
It‚Äôs been a week since my first overnight CQ shift.

¬†I didn‚Äôt talk much about what happened. Not with my squad, not even with my roommate. I told her the basics of that weird binder ‚Äî lock up early, don‚Äôt sit in the NCO‚Äôs chair after midnight, ignore the upstairs ‚Äî and I left it at that.

She laughed.

¬†‚ÄúOld Army superstition. Probably just bored, sleep-deprived E4s writing ghost stories.‚Äù

That‚Äôs fine. I guess that makes sense.

But when I saw my name on the CQ roster again ‚Äî Friday, 2300‚Äì0600 ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt know if the¬†

binder would still be there.

The night before my next shift, I checked.

¬†And there it was ‚Äî tucked under the printer again, right where it had been.

I didn‚Äôt touch it.

¬†Just left it open to the same page, like nothing had changed.

# UNOFFICIAL NIGHT ORDERS

*Alpha Company ‚Äì CQ Runner Protocol ‚Äì Night 2*

**Rule 2: Between 0000 and 0100, remain standing.**

**Do not sit in the NCOIC‚Äôs chair ‚Äî the camera feed distorts during that hour, and the printer may activate.**

¬†**If it does,**¬†**do not**¬†**read what it prints. Shred it immediately.**

**If a Staff Sergeant you don‚Äôt recognize enters the room wearing woodland BDUs and mirror-shined boots, do not acknowledge him.**¬†

**Let him pass in silence.**

¬†**He will not speak.**

SSG R was on shift that night ‚Äî a different Staff Sergeant than last time. I‚Äôd seen him around but never worked under him. Older guy. Ranger tab. Wore a watch with a cracked lens and always carried a beat-up green notebook .

He nodded when I arrived. ‚ÄúRead the binder already, Carson?‚Äù

I nodded back. Hooah, Staff Sergeant.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you know what not to do.‚Äù

Everything was fine for the first couple hours. Logged a couple Soldiers coming back from the gym, did my rounds on time. Nothing out of place.

¬†I even convinced myself most of what happened last time could‚Äôve been chalked up to nerves.¬†

Maybe even a joke someone was playing ‚Äî hazing the FNG.¬† One of those things you never admit to falling for.

Until 0054, when SSG R¬† said he was stepping out for a smoke. I asked if I should lock the front door behind him. He didn‚Äôt answer.

A few minutes later, the door creaked open, and someone stepped inside. It wasn‚Äôt¬† SSG R.

It was a Staff Sergeant I‚Äôd never seen before.¬†

But there was something odd about him. He was wearing old woodland BDUs ‚Äî the kind no one in the unit had worn for years ‚Äî and high buff black leather boots so shiny you can use it for a mirror. Yeah, really old school.¬†

I froze, remembering the rule:

***If a Staff Sergeant you don‚Äôt recognize enters the room wearing woodland BDUs and mirror-shined boots, do not acknowledge him.***

So I didn‚Äôt.

I just stood still, barely breathing, watching him pass.

He didn‚Äôt say a word.

He didn‚Äôt acknowledge me.

He just vanished around the corner.

And then the door shut quietly behind him.

I stood there for a few minutes, debating whether I should sit down. My feet hurt. But I remembered Rule 2 ‚Äî¬†*do not sit in the NCO‚Äôs chair between 0000 and 0100*¬†‚Äî so I stayed standing.

At 0103, the¬†**printer activated by itself.**

The screen read¬†**‚ÄúPRINT JOB: CQ ROSTER OVERRIDE.‚Äù**¬†A single page came out. I didn‚Äôt touch it at first.I just stared at the paper as the tray hummed and the toner settled.

Finally, I picked it up.

My rank, name, unit mos and unit¬† were¬† printed at the top:¬†

**PFC. CARSON, EMILY H.¬† ‚Äì 11B¬† ‚Äì ALPHA CO. ‚Äì 2-5 IN**

¬†Under that:

**FIREWATCH ASSIGNED ‚Äì 14 MAR 2023**

**STATUS: UNCONFIRMED ‚Äì REMAINS PENDING**

**PREVIOUS: CPL REESE, MAXWELL ‚Äì STATUS: VOID**

That was over two years ago. I wasn‚Äôt even in the Army yet. I was still in high school.

I crumpled the page, walked straight to the shredder, and fed it through. Then I opened the gray binder again and flipped to the next tabbed divider, convinced this was some kind of hazing thing and they‚Äôre just fucking with me. Maybe to test how well I follow directions.¬†

# Rule 11: If the printer gives you a page with your name, destroy it.

Do not keep it. Do not write about it. The toner sets deeper each time.

At 0137, I heard the front door unlock itself.

This time, I didn‚Äôt even look. I locked it again and logged the incident.

0200 rounds: everything seemed fine. Until I got near the stairwell. I paused, out of habit ‚Äî part of me expected the same footsteps from last week.

I heard nothing.

But when I looked up the stairwell, I saw something worse:

light.

¬†A faint yellow glow coming from the third floor.

¬†The floor that was supposed to be sealed.

I didn‚Äôt go up. I backed off and followed protocol.

‚ÄúArea all clear. Continuing rounds.‚Äù

When I got back to the CQ desk, the air smelled faintly burnt. Not like cigarette smoke, but more like soot.

I opened a window like Rule 6 advised.

# Rule 12: If you smell burning between 0300 and 0400, open the nearest window.

Do not evacuate. If anyone else tries to,¬†**restrain them if possible.**¬†If you cannot restrain them, do not follow.

I stayed put.

The alarm chirped at 0333. Once and then no more.

At 0430 l Staff Sergeant R came through the front door.

He saw me standing there stiff and pale and just nodded like he already knew.

‚ÄúPrinter again?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Staff Sergeant.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah ‚Äî it does that.‚Äù

He never asked what it printed, and he never looked in the shred bin. Just picked up the gray binder, flipped a few pages, and added something in pen to the back cover. I couldn‚Äôt see what.

\---

The rest of the day passed in a blur ‚Äî morning PT, live-fire drills, squad briefings, paperwork,¬† and preparing for the next night‚Äôs CQ shift.¬† Almost enough to forget the date on that printout.

*Almost.*

*March 14th, 2023*¬†‚Äî The date circled my mind and the name Reese. Why would my name be on a printout dated two years ago with his?

Back in my room, I almost called my boyfriend. I even unlocked my phone. But what would I say?

*Hey, babe ‚Äî do you remember if I joined the Army in 2023 instead of 2025?*

I put the phone down. I didn‚Äôt want to hear silence on the other end. Or worse ‚Äî¬†*Sorry, who is this?*

The next day I searched that date in the Battalion casualty reports archive. Nothing came up. No Reese, not even any AWOL reports.¬†

So I kept digging. Not in S1 or official channels, but old rumor threads or anonymous posts.

Then I found one.¬†

¬†Nothing official, but a name popped up on a now-archived message board: A soldier from Alpha Company ‚Äî CPL Maxwell Reese ‚Äî was listed as¬†**AWOL**¬†that same night.

Same time.¬†

Same building. Last seen March 14, 2023.

According to the message board, he just disappeared. Supposedly walked off post, vanished into town like a ghost. CID launched an investigation. So did the local sheriff.¬†

But nothing turned up ‚Äî no sightings, no credit card hits, no phone pings. His parents had to file a missing persons report just to keep the case open.

People go missing from base sometimes. Usually it‚Äôs AWOL. Sometimes it‚Äôs foul play. But with Reese, the story didn‚Äôt hold together.

No body was ever found. No trail either. Just a name that faded from memory ‚Äî except in that binder, right there with mine.

A couple days after my second CQ shift, I still couldn‚Äôt shake that name ‚Äî CPL Reese.

Nobody‚Äôs going to hand a PFC access to personnel files or old blotter reports.¬†

But I remembered that my roommate works as the company clerk, and I‚Äôd helped her carry some boxes the week prior. She owed me a favor.

¬†‚ÄúYou ever heard of a CPL Reese? Alpha Company. Supposedly went AWOL two years ago?‚Äù

She frowned. ‚ÄúReese? Doesn‚Äôt ring a bell. We didn‚Äôt have a Reese in Alpha in ‚Äô23 ‚Äî I‚Äôm sure of it.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúJust something I saw scribbled in an old duty log. Figured it might‚Äôve been a joke.‚Äù

She waved it off and went back to whatever she was working on.

But later that night ‚Äî when she thought I was sleeping ‚Äî I heard her typing on her government laptop. Real quiet. Then a pause‚Ä¶

And just one word under her breath: ‚ÄúWeird.‚Äù

She never brought it up again. And I didn‚Äôt ask.

The next morning, I went looking for the¬†**duty roster binder**¬†‚Äî- the actual Alpha Company CQ binder with the old printed rosters.

¬†Normally they only keep the last 60 days, but I remembered seeing some tucked behind the Admin tracker ‚Äî misfiled, folded, probably forgotten.

I found one for March 2023. It was covered in dust and coffee stains. Flipping through, I saw names I didn‚Äôt recognize. Specialists, corporals, a few PFCs. The usual.

¬†But on the duty log for¬†**March 13th to 14th**, it listed:

CQ NCO: SSG Gellner CQ Runner: CPL Reese

The entry fields below that were blank.

No rounds logged. No shift relief signature. No notes. No corrections. Just a completely empty page.

I flipped to the 14th-to-15th roster. The CQ runner space was filled in ‚Äî different name ‚Äî but the CQ NCO line said:

**‚ÄúPending Replacement ‚Äì On Hold‚Äù**

I checked the logbook next. One page had been ripped out. A jagged seam where the March 14th entry should‚Äôve been.

That‚Äôs not something you just miss. In any unit I‚Äôve seen,¬†**you do not mess with duty logs.**¬†I once watched a Staff Sergeant chew out a Specialist for forgetting to initial a 0500 entry during staff duty. A whole page missing? That should‚Äôve set off alarms.¬†

But no one had taped it back in. There were no remarks. No cover sheet. Just a missing day.

I went back to the gray binder. The ‚ÄúUnofficial Night Orders.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt opened it since my last shift. I wasn‚Äôt even sure if I wanted to. But when I did, I noticed something new.

**Rule 13**¬†had been added ‚Äî handwritten in shaky black ink near the back cover.

# Rule 13: If you find a name on the CQ roster that no one remembers, don‚Äôt say it out loud.

If the company can‚Äôt recall them, they‚Äôre not yours to recover. Names drift. Orders stay.

**File under March 2016.**

I didn‚Äôt understand what that meant until I started asking around about March¬†**2016**.

I kept it vague. Told people I was researching barracks fires for a writing assignment ‚Äî ‚ÄúJust something for online college courses.‚Äù That got me weird looks, but it also got me answers.

Someone in Charlie Company remembered it.

‚ÄúA fire started on the third floor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúElectrical. That was before it got sealed off.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyone get hurt?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey said no. But I heard different.‚Äù

When I pressed him on what he meant by different, he lowered his voice.

¬†‚ÄúThey said one guy was still inside. He never came out. But he wasn‚Äôt in Alpha. Might‚Äôve been HHC. Admin kept it quiet.‚Äù

I asked what his name was.

He just shook his head. ‚ÄúIf you find out,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell me ‚Äî in fact, we never had this conversation.‚Äù

I started pulling floor plans. Nothing fancy. Just what‚Äôs taped inside the fire escape boxes on each landing. The placards on the 1st and 2nd floor show the standard layout: latrines, laundry, armory, company office, CQ desk.

The one on the 3rd floor was different. It was older and faded.¬†

The third floor had been closed off after the 2016 fire. It was deemed unsafe ‚Äî sealed off for investigation and never reopened.

But the old floor plans and placards still showed rooms that didn‚Äôt officially exist anymore. One of them was labeled simply:

¬†‚ÄúDuty Archive ‚Äì BN Use Only.‚Äù

But when I asked the barracks duty NCO about it, he gave me a blank stare.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an archive room.‚Äù

I showed him a photo of the placard. He just shrugged.

‚ÄúMust be outdated. That floor‚Äôs off-limits anyway.‚Äù

That night, I pulled one more file ‚Äî something I‚Äôd seen during in-processing but hadn‚Äôt thought about since. It was the company‚Äôs in memoriam roster. Usually kept with the chapel materials, used for annual remembrance events.

There were six names listed from the last ten years. Training deaths. One car accident. One suicide.

No Reese.

No fire victims.

Just six clean, explainable losses.

I asked the chaplain‚Äôs assistant if there was an updated list.

‚ÄúNot that I know of, that‚Äôs the only one we use for formation.‚Äù

When I asked her who verified it, she paused.¬†

‚ÄúWe just use what Admin sends us. They do the HR flags.‚Äù

That night, I had duty again.

When I arrived, the gray binder wasn‚Äôt on the desk.

It was already¬†**open**¬†on my chair.

A new page had been added.

like, properly obsessed. for starters, he‚Äôs got this app on his phone that literally counts down to his estimated death (80 years, ticking backwards). there‚Äôs another one that‚Äôs got 4 widgets on his homescreen counting down to the end of the day, week, month, and year. i catch him checking them constantly throughout the day.

he times everything. like, when we‚Äôre choosing somewhere to eat, he won‚Äôt pick based on the food, he picks based on how long it takes to get there. he refuses to watch tv shows because apparently one season = 5 films, and that‚Äôs a better return on time. he always orders takeaway cause cooking wastes time. never meets his mates one-on-one cause it‚Äôs inefficient, he invites multiple people so he can socialise all at once. he even does this with me. we‚Äôre only ever alone when we‚Äôre fucking (thank god he‚Äôs not into being watched).

he only sleeps max 5 hours a night, always looks half-dead, and takes loads of vitamins to ‚Äúmake up for it,‚Äù which obvs don‚Äôt work. he pees in the shower to save time, eats coffee beans if he‚Äôs not ordering it in, and if something takes 5 mins longer than planned, he gets genuinely upset. the list goes on forever. and his reasoning is always the same: time is the most valuable thing we have

he‚Äôs got an 8 year old daughter too. i actually met her the first time he invited me over. he didn‚Äôt even mention she‚Äôd be there. said it was pointless to waste time on a formal intro since we‚Äôd meet anyway eventually. i do like her though, i get on well with kids in general.

anyway, two days ago we were all having breakfast and she randomly started putting her shoes on mid meal (we‚Äôre not american). then she starts going on (in a very kid way) about how it saves her time and now she can do more stuff later. i laughed it off at the time, but honestly it really bugged me.

later when it was just me and him, i asked if he was planning to pass his time obsession onto her as well.

wasn‚Äôt our first convo about this but definitely our biggest fight. i basically told him that always trying to multitask everything is actually backfiring, that all this efficiency is just stressing him out more, that sleeping less isn‚Äôt extending his life but probs shortening it, and that obsessing over how much time he‚Äôs got left isn‚Äôt normal or healthy. i also said it sucks that we barely get quality time together and that it‚Äôs not fair on his daughter to grow up with that kind of pressure.

he told me i don‚Äôt get his mindset and that i‚Äôve got no right to tell him how to raise his kid. voices were raised and at some point i told him he needs therapy. i‚Äôd mentioned it before in a more gentle way but this time i yelled it, ngl. still, it felt like a long time coming and i kinda snapped.

we haven‚Äôt spoken since. i texted him this morning, it‚Äôs now nearly midnight and still nothing. i‚Äôm thinking of calling his sister just to check in, but first i need to know am i the asshole?",6,1752536348.0,AITAH,3,0.88,False

So‚Ä¶..I‚Äôve been working an automotive sales job for 5.5 years, which anyone who knows anything about sales will know why I‚Äôve wound up on this forum. Previously I worked at a coffee shop making little money as a 26 year old man, which lead me to find something a little more lucrative. Now I‚Äôm 32 years old and kinda in the same spot, but not because of money.

Fast forward to today‚Äî I‚Äôm almost 6 years in, a top performer and earn a 6 figure income. This job has allowed me to do so, so many great things; from becoming a homeowner to traveling across the World, seeing some of my favorite artists in concert, and then some.

To keep this short (because I have the potential to drag out a story) I‚Äôve been tossing around the idea of leaving for the greater portion of this entire career, specifically to find something that‚Äôs a little more ‚Äúme‚Äù.  I feel that it isn‚Äôt a fit because it doesn‚Äôt align who I am as a person. I‚Äôm gay, I am passionate about music, art, fitness, health, animals, and a few other things. I also really love cars and enjoy working with people and helping them, but that is the least of what this job is about, and is more about stressing over numbers. Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîmy managers are great, I have vacation time, taking a day off is never a problem, there really isn‚Äôt anything  truly wrong, which is unheard of in the car business/m‚Äî but that‚Äôs beside the point, I still just feel that I am in the wrong place. 

One might say‚Äî okay, dude, you‚Äôre not happy, find another job, BUT‚Äî here‚Äôs the problem‚Äî I have no degree in anything. Zero. Zilch. Nada. I didn‚Äôt even finish high school, which is a whole other can of worms.

With all that said‚Äî my plan is to do some ‚Äúsoul searching‚Äù if you will‚Äî to pursue a degree. 

If I leave this position, taking a pay cut is an absolute guarantee, and it won‚Äôt be a small one, it will be huge, leaving me to live paycheck to paycheck. So my question to you all is‚Äî 

Do I take a pay cut to work a job that I‚Äôll more likely be less happy with to earn a degree for 4-5 years, then resume where I left off? Or do I try to balance my already busy life by staying in this sales position and obtaining a degree simultaneously?

As I write this I feel that the only real answer is gonna come from me‚Äî and no one else‚Äî but I‚Äôve spent years trying to find the answer which has left me to ask an online forum full of people I don‚Äôt even know. What do you guys think?",1,1752536292.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False

I thought he was so handsome, one of the first things I said to him was ""you're so gorgeous I almost hesitated to respond because I was worried yours might be an AI profile!"" He was very flirty and loves to talk on the phone. We're pretty different, but I was nonetheless getting excited. 

He was pretty quick about wanting to use petnames like sweetheart and baby. I don't mind that, but on day 3 while talking on the phone (for a few hours) he asked me what problem I had with calling him baby. I was confused, as I had used it numerous times during our conversation and pointed that out. He responded with ""yeah while talking on the phone, but you only used it via text three times today."" I joked about there being an acceptable quota and he said I makes him feel like there's a lack of affection when I don't use it. So I committed to typing it more. 

Next he had an issue with my response times to his texts. I know I have a habit of opening a text, reading it, and thinking about what I want to say and responding later in the day. He called me out every time I didn't respond within minutes of his text with a question like ""are you really leaving me on read?"" or ""I see you read my message. Nothing to say?"" And I'd apologize and tell him I was either busy at work, thinking about what I wanted to say, or that sometimes it felt like a natural stopping point on a topic in the conversation. He shared that it made him feel ignored to not hear from me after I opened a text, that he wasn't a priority to me or that I didn't want to continue the conversation. I promised to work on it and be more mindful of responding quickly, but asked him to be patient with me because I was starting to feel anxious. He said he would try.

On day 5 I met him in person simply to hang out and go on a walk with him and his dog. It went well, even though his dad came by and crashed the date for over an hour. I was surprised but I went with it because I got along with him well enough, too. 

That night after 5 hours of hanging out I talked to him on the phone for an additional hour and said I'd text him again after hanging up. 30 minutes go by and he calls me asking why I didn't do what I promised in texting him after we hung up...? I had fully intended to send a goodnight text, he just didn't give me enough time. Leaving that night on a note of criticism that ""I didn't follow through on my word"" over something so small just ruined the day for me. 

Day 6. I was ON IT today. Goodmorning text? BAM. Instant response to all texts and keeping the conversation going on throughout the day? DONE! Called him baby as often as I could? YOU BETCHA, BABY! And then. The incident. 

I asked what his last name was since I realized I didn't have it. He shared it with me and I said ""great, now I can finally add it to your name in my phone lol"". This was apparently a grave mistake. 

He became immediately upset, asking why I would need to do that. I don't know about you but I list ALL people in my phone by first and last name. I used to supervise a rotating staff of 10-20 different people every year for about a decade and after you have 7 Danielles in your phone and you have no idea who is who, you get in the habit of adding last names. He refused to hear this. He said that the fact that I wouldn't have his name in my phone as Baby, like he would for me, that it feels like he's just some random guy or a stranger listed in my phone. I have first and last names in my phone even for my family members so I pushed back on that expectation...He said I should know better that he would like that because he's so sentimental, but ""whatever you can do what you want. Forget about it."" 

At this point I'm crying tears of frustration in the middle of the restaurant I'm at by myself because this all feels like too much way too fast, regardless of the chemistry we have. 

I understand wanting a sweet name in your phone for your partner. I really do. But I've known him for a WEEK. Even if I could see this going somewhere someday, was I being inconsiderate? AITA?

Quarter to five, Mike sat patiently at his desk, the towering skyscrapers outside his window looming like silent, steel giants. The faint hum of the office AC and the rhythmic tap of keyboards were the only sounds that broke the otherwise stifling silence. He worked a normal nine to five at a small office department, no wife or kids, and monthly paid rent on an overpriced apartment. In every meaning of the word, Mike could be described as just an average guy. What the outside eye misses is the intricacies and characteristics of every human being, as specific as they all are, are too much to ever define a person as, ‚ÄúAverage.‚Äù Mike had his fair share of oddities, ones he tried to hide, like us all. He had many dreams, which you couldn‚Äôt see through the way he lived his life, and he wasn't the type to share them. Mike's work life was quite unintriguing, and not all of that was necessarily due to Mike.  Each morning, colleagues shuffled in, their faces blank, their greetings automated. They moved like clockwork, pouring identical cups of coffee, settling into the same worn chairs, their actions devoid of spontaneity. Their work life was a relentless hamster wheel, a futile chase after a carrot forever dangling just out of reach. Each day bled into the next, an endless cycle of monotony that led nowhere and to nothing. Mike would leave his work parking lot at almost the exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. He would then take a few left and right turns until he got to the auditorium. 

The auditorium screamed with neglect, its faded velvet seats ripped and stained, the air thick with the scent of dust and forgotten dreams. But to Mike, it pulsed with possibility, each broken chair a testament to the magic it once held within its walls. He had been working for this moment for months and months, imagining and replaying his dream over and over again in his head. It became his driving force, completely infatuated with his dream, the dream of being a magician. It was an odd dream, not shared by many. Interest sparked in Mike at a young age, his seventh birthday party, and in which his parents hired a magician. The magician put on a fantastic show, loud applause rained from both him and all of his classmates that his mother had invited. In that moment Mike knew what he wanted, and it never changed. Even if we deny it, or are scared to admit it, it's what we all deep down inside want and crave. The dream of being something special. For Mike, he planned this his whole life. Before he went to sleep, while he was asleep dreaming, sitting in the back of class, all Mike ever imagined to do was to have an audience cheer him on, and give him the same affection that they did that magician at his seventh birthday party. If this could just go right for Mike this time, everything would be alright, it would all be fixed. 

The show began, presented by Mikey the magic man. After a few basic introduction tricks, the audience clapped, but not at the tone he remembered. He thinks back to the only way he could really impress them, he must put all his chips on the table and go for the prestige. This act would make or break Mike's show, and in reality his life as well. Mike pivoted quickly, and remembered the act that wowed his classmates so long ago, the infamous saw act. It was fairly simple, one he had practiced many times over and over in his head. All he would have to do is saw a woman in half and put her back together. The trick had been done many times by others, and for a magician of Mike's caliber should be inconsequential. The first cut was clean, the body was split into halves. Mike glanced at the crowd, expecting applause, but met only silence. Faces contorted in disgust, eyes burning with a hatred he couldn't comprehend. A cold dread washed over him. Had he miscalculated? What went wrong? Excruciatingly, he looks back onto the stage.  Every fiber in his body felt empty, like he was stuck in this moment for decades. What had once been complete, then broken, was entirely incomplete now. Her body laid lifeless, guts falling onto the stage, Mike immediately covers his face to mask the smell of a rotting corpse, as he loosens his ever tight grip of the saw, dropping it right into his victims still-pumping heart. 

As he turns away towards the audience, they start to scream and concurrently trash the stage. He begs and pleads for forgiveness, but is met with a pure moment of anarchy. All that was once slow, was now racing around and nothing makes sense. Did anything ever make sense? Or was the discontentment masked by the revolving door.  Mike scans around the room and trembles in fear. The dream was over, he would wake up soon but the show could not go on. Even after the chaos, it couldn't be the same. Mike dropped down to the floor, sobbing and screaming in agony. Despair consuming him, he clawed at his scalp, tufts of hair scattering like fallen leaves. Then, with a gut wrenching scream, he gouged at his eyes, the vibrant blue fading into a bloody mess. He tore at his skin, desperate to shed the weight of his failure, until finally, only the stark, white bones of his shattered dreams remained on his decrepit body. His mangled skeleton figure laid there on stage, still being trashed by the crowd, greasy popcorn and flat soda covered his remains. Mike had reduced himself down into nothing and nobody.

8:37 am. Then came nine. Programmed, programmed to come in, say the same things, drink the same coffee, sit in the same seat, and do the same unimportant work every single day. A hamster wheel back and forth, futilely chasing at something that can never be obtained. Mike would leave his work parking lot at the same exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. Nothing compares to childhood innocence, fever dreams, a fading memory. A revolving door never stops its orbit, until you step out.",1,1752536196.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1m02a1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1m02a1y/im_being_paid_as_a_barista_and_treated_as_a/,I‚Äôm being Paid as a Barista and Treated as a manager.,"I‚Äôve been working at a small bakery/coffee shop for a little over a month. (edit: just under a month) I was originally hired as a barista, but since starting, I‚Äôve found myself taking on way more responsibility than what I signed up for, and definitely more than what I‚Äôm being paid for.



The business is run by a woman and her daughter-in-law, and while they‚Äôre nice enough, they have very little hands-on experience with how the shop actually functions. They have never run a food establishment previously and do not have any recognized cooking or management experience. Neither of them can use the till properly, make drinks, or even explain what‚Äôs in the food they sell. Neither know how to make majority of our recipes, and recently didn‚Äôt even know the recipe for hot chocolate. And when I showed them the recipe I used they told me to use torani chocolate flavour syrup and streamed milk instead of like proper mocha liquid chocolate and vanilla. There‚Äôs zero drink standard. I‚Äôve had to help guide them through their own menu items.



Since I started, they‚Äôve let go of one full-time staff member and are now about to lose two more (one of whom is the only other full-timer aside from me). That leaves me as the only fully trained person who knows how to open and close the caf√©, make the drinks, run the till, and handle customer flow.



I regularly work full solo shifts, open the store, manage the lunch rush alone, and train the younger staff (who are mostly teens). On top of that, I‚Äôve been creating checklists for opening/closing, trying to implement food safety systems (which were non-existent when I got there. Things as simple as dating the food.), updating recipe cards, helping with social media, and stepping in to fix quality issues from the kitchen. I was even the one who had to tell one of the bakers that their cinnamon buns were rock hard and couldn‚Äôt be sold - a conversation my boss asked me to handle for her. I‚Äôm doing all of this at $16/hour. For reference, minimum wage here is $15/hour.



I just found out our tips, (which are earned entirely from counter service, drink-making, and customer interaction) are being split evenly based on hours across all staff, including the kitchen. The kitchen doesn‚Äôt serve food, interact with customers, or clean the caf√© floors. They don‚Äôt bus tables or handle dishes other than their own - we do most of that, and even then when my boss is working in the kitchen she leaves all the dishes for us baristas to do at the end of the day! I understand kitchen tipping in full-service restaurants, but this is not that. It feels completely unfair, especially when I‚Äôm working customer-facing shifts alone and seeing those tips disappear into a shared pool with people who didn‚Äôt interact with a single customer.



One of the owners recently panicked during a light rush and had to text me on my break to come help her. I had been working from 6:30 a.m. and hadn‚Äôt had a break until 1:30 p.m., and I was ten minutes into it when I got that text. Meanwhile, I had handled a full hour-long lunch rush by myself with a ten-person line and no help. We serve sandwiches, soup, salads, pastries, etc so I was running all over the store with no help. When I pointed this out, she brushed it off with, ‚ÄúWell, you handled it so well.‚Äù Of course I was, I know how to do my job.



Multiple younger staff members (ages 16‚Äì19) have come to me saying they feel uncomfortable and criticized when getting feedback from one of the owners. To the point of them finger wagging at the girls telling them (clearly no one has taught you how to do dishes) I‚Äôve had to act as a go-between to help them feel safe and stay motivated. I‚Äôm not their manager, but I‚Äôm doing emotional labor as if I were.



The worst part? I‚Äôm only here until early September before moving out of the country. So now I‚Äôm stuck in this spot where I‚Äôve built structure into this job, kept it running through chaos, and feel like the entire thing is being held together by my unpaid labor - but I‚Äôm burning out fast. And I‚Äôm being paid nearly minimum wage to carry it all. But I need the money regardless at this point because my visa process is almost $10,000.



I‚Äôm considering either sitting them down and giving an ultimatum to raise my pay, give me a formal title, and let me run the floor properly; or just handing in my resignation and saving my energy. The only reason I haven‚Äôt quit already is because it‚Äôs a five-minute drive from my house and allows me to use my parents‚Äô car without re-registering my own before I leave the country. Plus anyone hiring me or trying to get a new job just for eight weeks is a long shot.



At this point, I feel like I‚Äôm being exploited. But I‚Äôm also torn because I‚Äôve put a lot of care into making this place function better than it did when I arrived. I‚Äôve even held off reporting major food safety issues because I didn‚Äôt want to escalate things. At one point my boss tried to have me sell soup that was left out at room temperature because ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to be frozen anyways‚Äù and I refused. We didn‚Äôt start dating our food until I BEGGED for it, and that was only implemented last week. But it‚Äôs feeling more and more like they‚Äôve leaned on my goodwill too hard for too long. This cafe has also changed owners 3 times over the course of two years, these owners just took over in May, I started end of June. 



What would you do in this situation? Is it worth fighting for a better wage and recognition for the next eight weeks, or should I just walk and protect my energy? I appreciate any advice or just kind words at this point!

Chapter 1

I couldn't sleep again last night, so I was up early, curled on our living room sofa with Marcus's laptop balanced on my knees. Five months pregnant, finding a comfortable position was becoming its own daily challenge. My fingers hovered over the keyboard as I scrolled through Pinterest, hunting for gender reveal ideas. Blue balloons or pink confetti? Cake with colored filling or smoke bombs? I wanted something special, something that would make Marcus smile again. The distance between us had been growing for months. Three years of fertility treatments had drained us both‚Äîemotionally, physically, financially. But this miracle baby, our little one who'd appeared against all odds, was going to change everything. I was sure of it. ""Just a few more weeks until we know if you're a boy or girl,"" I whispered, rubbing my rounded belly. The baby responded with a flutter of movement that still made my heart soar every time. A notification popped up on Marcus's screen‚Äîa text message preview. I normally wouldn't have looked, but the name caught my eye: Sophia Chen, his business partner. And the words that followed froze my blood. *Can't wait to wake up next to you every morning. Two more weeks until she's gone.* My fingers trembled as I clicked on the message app. I shouldn't be doing this. I shouldn't be invading his privacy. But something primal and terrified drove me forward. The messages loaded, hundreds of them, stretching back months. Intimate. Loving. Planning. *The condo will feel so much better with your touch instead of hers.* *We'll redo the master bedroom first. I can't sleep another night in that bed.* *What if she won't leave easily?* *She will. I've made sure there's nothing left for her here.* I scrolled frantically, each message driving the knife deeper. Photos. Plans for trips. Discussions about their future together. And then I saw it‚Äîa message from three weeks ago, right after my last ultrasound. *She's keeping the pregnancy. It complicates things.* Sophia's response: *What are you going to do?* *Whatever I have to. This doesn't change our plans. You're my future, not her. Not it.* Not it. My baby. Our baby. The miracle we'd prayed for. The child I thought would save us. I slammed the laptop closed and ran to the bathroom, barely making it before I vomited. My whole body shook with sobs as I curled around the toilet bowl, one hand protectively cradling my belly. ""I've got you,"" I whispered to my baby. ""I've got you."" --- I spent the day in a fog, moving through our condo like a ghost. I made dinner on autopilot‚ÄîMarcus's favorite pasta, the irony not lost on me. When I heard his key in the lock at precisely 7:15 PM, I straightened my shoulders and took a deep breath. ""Something smells good,"" he called out, dropping his keys in the ceramic bowl by the door‚Äîthe one I'd hand-painted for our second anniversary. I watched him move through our home with the confidence of someone who owned everything in it, including me. Had he always looked at me with such cool detachment? Had I just been too desperate to notice? ""Dinner's ready,"" I said, my voice surprisingly steady as I placed two plates on our dining table. We sat across from each other, the silence broken only by the scrape of forks against ceramic. I studied his face‚Äîthe sharp jawline I used to trace with my fingertips, the dark eyes that once looked at me with desire, the lips that had whispered promises he never intended to keep. ""You're on my laptop today,"" he said casually, twirling pasta around his fork. It wasn't a question. He knew. ""Yes."" I set down my fork. ""I saw your messages with Sophia."" He didn't flinch. Didn't deny it. Just took another bite of pasta and chewed thoughtfully, as if we were discussing the weather. ""How long?"" I asked. ""Does it matter?"" ""It matters to me."" He sighed, setting down his fork. ""Eight months. But it's been over between us for longer than that, Isabella. You know that."" ""No,"" I said, my voice cracking. ""I didn't know that. I thought we were fighting for our family. I thought this baby‚Äî"" My hand went to my stomach protectively. ""This baby was never part of the plan,"" he cut in, his voice eerily calm. ""Let's be practical about this. You're young. You could start over. There are options‚Äîadoption, for instance."" The room seemed to tilt sideways. ""Options? You want me to give up our child?"" ""Isabella."" He reached across the table, not for my hand, but for his wine glass. ""Let's be honest. This pregnancy, this child‚Äîthey're liabilities I never signed up for. Our marriage was already over. This just complicates the exit strategy."" Exit strategy. As if our life together had been nothing but a business venture gone sour. ""You never wanted this baby,"" I whispered, the truth dawning on me with sickening clarity. ""No,"" he said simply. ""I didn't."" The pasta turned to ash in my mouth as my world collapsed around me.

Chapter 2

I drove to my parents' house in a daze, one hand on the steering wheel, the other protectively cradling my belly. The familiar streets of my childhood neighborhood blurred through my tears. This was where I'd always felt safe, where I'd learned about love and family and forever. Now I was returning broken, betrayed, and five months pregnant with a child whose father had just suggested I give it away like an unwanted pet. My mother's roses still lined the walkway, their sweet scent a cruel reminder of happier times. I'd carried a bouquet of these same blooms at my wedding, believing I was walking toward my happily ever after. ""Isabella? What are you doing here so early?"" My mother appeared at the door in her apron, flour dusting her hands. Sunday morning meant she was baking after early Mass. ""Mama,"" I whispered, my voice cracking. ""Marcus is having an affair."" Her expression shifted from surprise to something harder, more guarded. She ushered me inside without embracing me, her eyes darting to the neighbors' windows. In the kitchen, the familiar scent of cinnamon and coffee should have been comforting. Instead, it made my stomach turn. My father sat at the table, newspaper in hand, reading glasses perched on his nose. He looked up, his face immediately clouding at my tear-stained appearance. ""What's happened?"" he demanded, setting down his paper. I collapsed into a chair, words tumbling out between sobs. The texts. The affair. Marcus's cold dismissal of our baby. With each revelation, my parents' expressions grew more pinched, more distant. ""Did you know about this woman before?"" my mother asked when I finally paused for breath. ""What? No, of course not."" ""And you're sure it's not just... a misunderstanding?"" My father cleared his throat. ""Marcus has always been so generous, so successful."" I stared at them in disbelief. ""He told me to give up my baby, Papa. Our grandchild."" My mother sighed, pulling out a chair beside me. But instead of the embrace I desperately needed, she took my hands and fixed me with a stern look. ""Isabella, marriage is hard work. It requires sacrifice. What have you been doing to keep your husband happy while you've been so focused on getting pregnant?"" The words hit like a physical blow. ""What?"" ""Men stray when they feel neglected,"" she continued, her voice taking on the same tone she'd used when lecturing me about my grades in high school. ""All those fertility treatments, the disappointments‚Äîdid you think about how that affected him?"" ""Your mother's right,"" my father added. ""The Church doesn't recognize divorce. You made vows before God."" ""He's been planning to leave me for months,"" I said, my voice hollow. ""He's been moving money, planning to move her into our home."" ""Then you need to fight for your marriage,"" my mother insisted. ""Go home. Make yourself presentable. Remind him why he married you in the first place."" I looked between them, these people who had raised me, who had taught me about dignity and respect and love. In their eyes, I saw only judgment and disappointment‚Äînot for Marcus's betrayal, but for my failure to prevent it. ""I should go,"" I whispered, rising unsteadily. Neither of them moved to stop me. --- Back at the condo, I sat in our sleek modern kitchen, staring at my phone's banking app. Access denied. Access denied. Access denied. Every joint account we shared‚Äîfrozen. My fingers trembled as I checked my personal account, the one I'd maintained since before our marriage. $2,347.82. In San Francisco, that wouldn't even cover one month's rent on a studio apartment. Marcus had planned this meticulously. While I'd been picking out baby names and researching natural childbirth, he'd been systematically cutting off my financial lifelines. I stumbled to the bedroom‚Äîour bedroom‚Äîand began pulling clothes from the closet. I couldn't stay here, not with the ghost of his betrayal haunting every corner. Not knowing Sophia had probably been here, in our home, in our bed. The tears came again, hot and relentless, as I stuffed whatever I could grab into a suitcase. Where would I go? What would I do? How would I provide for my baby? I dragged the suitcase to the door, my chest heaving with sobs that seemed to come from the very core of my being. In the hallway, I collapsed onto the stairs, my legs simply refusing to carry me any further. ""Oh, dear. Oh, my goodness."" I looked up through swollen eyes to see Mrs. Patterson, my elderly neighbor, standing at her door in a floral housecoat, concern etched into the lines of her face. ""I'm sorry,"" I gasped, trying to compose myself. ""I'm just‚ÄîI'm having a bad day."" ""I'd say it's rather more than that."" She approached slowly, as one might a wounded animal. ""Come inside, dear. Let me make you some tea."" ""I can't‚ÄîI should‚Äî"" But I had nowhere to go, no plan beyond escape. ""Nonsense. You can't go anywhere in this state."" Her gnarled hand was surprisingly strong as she helped me to my feet. ""Bring your bag. Winston and I have plenty of room."" Her apartment was the mirror image of ours in layout, but where our home was all cold minimalism and stark white walls, hers was warm chaos‚Äîshelves overflowing with books, walls covered in framed photographs, and every surface adorned with knickknacks that told the story of a long and well-lived life. She settled me on a worn but comfortable sofa, a fluffy Persian cat immediately claiming my lap. Minutes later, she pressed a steaming mug into my hands. ""Now,"" she said, lowering herself into an armchair across from me. ""Tell me everything. And don't leave anything out. Every cruel word, every manipulative move‚ÄîI want it all documented."" I blinked at her in surprise. ""I may be old,"" she said, a steely glint in her eye, ""but I know a thing or two about surviving men who think they can discard women like yesterday's newspaper."" For the first time since discovering Marcus's betrayal, I felt a tiny spark of something other than despair. It wasn't quite hope‚Äînot yet. But as I cradled my tea and began to speak, with Mrs. Patterson nodding and occasionally making notes in a small leather-bound journal, I felt something inside me begin to strengthen and solidify. My baby shifted within me, a gentle reminder that I wasn't truly alone. And somehow, in this cluttered apartment with an elderly widow and her cat, I found the first fragile threads of what might eventually become a path forward.

Chapter 3

I was still sitting on Mrs. Patterson's floral sofa when the doorbell rang. Winston, the fluffy Persian cat, had settled into a purring ball on my lap, his warmth a small comfort against the chill that had settled in my bones. ""I'll get it, dear,"" Mrs. Patterson said, setting down her teacup. ""You rest."" I heard murmured voices at the door, then Mrs. Patterson returned, her face grim. ""There's a young man here. Says he has papers for you."" My heart plummeted. ""From Marcus?"" She nodded, and a moment later, a clean-cut young man in a suit appeared, looking uncomfortable. ""Isabella Martinez?"" ""Yes,"" I whispered. ""These are for you."" He handed me a thick manila envelope. ""You've been served."" With trembling fingers, I opened the envelope as he retreated. The legal language swam before my eyes, but certain phrases stood out with brutal clarity: *irreconcilable differences... immediate vacation of premises... minimal child support... no spousal support...* ""He's evicting me,"" I said, my voice hollow. ""He wants me out by the end of the week."" Mrs. Patterson took the papers from my shaking hands, her eyes narrowing as she scanned them. ""These terms are outrageous. No judge would approve this."" ""I don't know anything about divorce law,"" I admitted, tears welling again. ""I don't know what to do."" ""You need a lawyer, dear. A good one."" She disappeared into her bedroom, returning moments later with a business card. ""Rachel Thompson. She helped my niece through a nasty divorce last year. Brilliant woman, absolutely ferocious in court."" I stared at the card, the elegant embossed lettering blurring through my tears. *Rachel Thompson, Family Law Attorney*. With shaking fingers, I dialed the number. --- ""He's done what?"" Rachel Thompson's voice was sharp with indignation. She was a striking woman in her forties, with close-cropped silver hair and piercing blue eyes that missed nothing. Her office was small but tasteful, the walls lined with law books and framed diplomas. ""Frozen all our accounts,"" I repeated, my voice small. ""I can't access anything except my personal account, which has barely enough for a month's expenses."" Rachel removed her glasses, cleaning them methodically with a microfiber cloth. It seemed to be a habit when she was thinking. ""And you're five months pregnant?"" ""Yes."" ""With his child?"" ""Of course with his child,"" I said, confused by the question. ""I have to ask."" She replaced her glasses. ""Men like your husband often try to claim paternity issues to avoid financial responsibility."" The thought made me physically ill. Would Marcus stoop that low? ""These terms,"" Rachel continued, tapping the divorce papers, ""are designed to intimidate you into accepting a settlement that benefits only him. It's a classic power play."" ""I can't afford to fight him,"" I whispered. ""He knows that."" ""You can't afford not to."" Rachel leaned forward, her eyes intense. ""Isabella, what he's doing‚Äîcutting off your access to marital assets while you're carrying his child‚Äîisn't just cruel, it's legally questionable. I'm filing an emergency motion today to prevent him from further depleting your joint assets."" ""But I can't pay you,"" I said, shame burning my cheeks. ""Pro bono,"" she replied without hesitation. ""Cases like yours are why I left corporate law."" For the first time in days, I felt a flicker of hope. ""What do I do now?"" ""You gather documents. Every financial record you can find. And you take care of yourself and that baby."" Her voice softened slightly. ""This is a marathon, not a sprint. We're going to make sure you and your child are protected."" --- The sterile walls of the examination room seemed to close in around me as I sat on the paper-covered table in my hospital gown. My five-month prenatal checkup‚Äîthe one I'd imagined Marcus would attend with me, holding my hand as we caught our first glimpse of whether we were having a son or daughter. Instead, I was alone, clutching my phone, checking compulsively to see if Rachel had texted about the emergency motion. ""Blood pressure's a bit elevated today,"" Dr. Chen noted, removing the cuff from my arm. ""Any unusual stress?"" I tried to answer, but my throat closed up. Tears spilled down my cheeks before I could stop them. ""Isabella?"" Dr. Chen set down her clipboard, her professional demeanor softening with concern. ""What's going on?"" ""My husband,"" I managed between sobs. ""He's leaving me. He's filed for divorce and frozen our accounts and‚Äî"" I broke down completely, my body shaking with the force of my grief. Dr. Chen handed me a tissue, her face grave. ""I'm so sorry. This must be incredibly difficult."" ""I'm scared,"" I whispered, one hand protectively covering my belly. ""What if I can't provide for my baby? What if the stress hurts the baby?"" ""First, let's check on your little one,"" she said gently, preparing the ultrasound machine. ""Then we'll talk about resources and support systems."" As the cold gel spread across my abdomen, I closed my eyes, praying that at least this‚Äîthis one precious thing‚Äîwould still be okay in my crumbling world.",2,1752535734.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

My dad has been hanging out with this other man for many years, and i always thought he was some friend. Recently my family were invited to this man‚Äôs house, and he had two children around my age (F22). I check out the guy and he seems to check me out as well. during the evening we exchange glances and at the end he says we should go grab a coffee some time. all is great! - until my mom bursts out ‚Äù‚Ä¶since we are related and all‚Äù at the end of a discussion. WHAT. 

i talk to my dad about it and apparently, me and this guy are third cousins. my dad and the man are second cousins. me and the guy share a great great grandparent. 

i literally have never met these people before and i feel so weird right now because we had great energy during the evening, and i have a hunch the guy must be aware of this as well. 

the thing is, i live in a small town in rural greece and my family are natives to this town, our family history goes back hundreds of years here so i have lots of familial connections, the population is only 30.000 as of right now. further, this meeting has some undertones of a set-up because there was a big emphasis from my mother and from the man that me and his son should meet. i like him but i don‚Äôt know how to feel about this whole situation! i really need some opinions from the outside to gauge exactly how weird this situation is :( ",1,1752535660.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1m021ln,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m021ln/plants_cant_scream/,Plants Can't Scream,"My hands flexed nervously against the steering wheel of my car. I‚Äôve been parked outside my dad‚Äôs house for ten minutes, unable to get out. It all felt so different, yet the same. The years away have turned my childhood home from a bright and vibrant place into a dull, brownish-yellow structure with a collection of washers and dryers on the side of the house. My dad was a handyman. He would sell parts and other things for extra income. The yard, however, was immaculate. A bright green pool of grass mowed into alternating lines, obviously deeply cared for. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile at the sight; some things with my dad never changed. He had owned his own small lawn care business. I remember being a young kid starting to work with him during the summer. I always enjoyed it. I loved the smell of cut grass and felt a sense of fulfillment hauling wheelbarrows of mulch and planting young tree saplings.¬†Working those summers with my dad were some of the last few good memories I had in this neighborhood.¬†Eventually, he couldn‚Äôt keep investing his savings into his business as well as pay for a divorce lawyer. He had to give it all up and take up maintenance work instead.

Taking a step out of my car, my anxiety washed back over me like a tidal wave. My stomach rolled, and I fought the urge to run away. After all, what happened to me at that house hadn‚Äôt been my father‚Äôs fault. After *it* happened, my parents already crumbling marriage couldn‚Äôt survive the new wave of stress on top of the growing resentment and constant fighting. My mom had me packed and out of that house before the ink had dried on the divorce papers. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve been back in town that everything I‚Äôve been suppressing all these years comes flooding back to me. For years, I woke up in a cold sweat, screaming from nightmares, not being able to remember anything except the cold feeling of something thin and tendril-like wrapping around my ankle. My throat would be hoarse by the time I woke. I always came to soaked in sweat and shivering in my mother‚Äôs arms while she rocked me gently back and forth like a baby. My dad would simply stand in the doorway and watch -- unsure and confused about how to help me. He often would stay up with me on those long, sleepless nights. He would open the kitchen window and smoke while I drifted in and out of consciousness on the living room couch. My mom was constantly yelling at him for smoking in the house. My dad smoking by the window had been their compromise at the time.¬†As much as I appreciated his presence, it never stopped the nightmares.

Even after all these years of therapy, it is still the Taylor house that haunts me. My mother thought that finding Peggy Taylor‚Äôs body had been what scared me, but my father and I knew it to be something different. It was something I saw alive that has haunted me all these years since. After that night, they fought a lot about how to address my rapid downfall into random fits of anxiety attacks and night terrors. A therapist is what my mother thought I needed, and my father thought I just needed to forget it ever happened. You can see why their marriage didn‚Äôt last. Eventually, my mom did find me a therapist that helped manage my anxiety, but I never truly could open up about what happened.

Lately, all my sleep strategies haven‚Äôt been working. The nightmares have come back again, more visceral and vivid than ever. Even if I managed to stay asleep for a few hours, I woke up sweaty and sore. My heart thumping harshly in my chest like I‚Äôve been running a marathon. My therapist was pushing me to start to confront the trauma I faced surrounding the Taylor house. The thought was if I could begin to confront the bad memories instead of pushing them down, then I could make the nightmares go away. After a few weeks of endless, sleepless nights, I couldn‚Äôt argue against anything that might help me find solace in sleep once again.

I remember Peggy being a kind, if not somewhat eccentric woman. She kept coolers in the trunk of her rusty gold car. She would sit in a lawn chair in her garage where she was usually drinking sweet tea and holding a small electric handheld fan, inviting us and others to come take snacks and drinks. She would hand out water, sodas, and candy to us kids during the summer. My parents often hovered uneasily as I grabbed what I could from her trunk, but I loved it. She did this summer after summer for as far back as I could remember. So, the other kids and I really enjoyed seeing Peggy. She was much kinder than her brother Harry. Harold ‚ÄòHarry‚Äô Taylor had been the neighborhood creep. They lived together in a white two-story house on the left most side of the cul-de-sac down the same street as ours. The other kids and I used to make it a game of hiding from Harry. We‚Äôd jump behind bushes and hide behind houses giggling and not understanding fully why our parents encouraged us to hide from the man. We often played pranks and ding-dong-ditch their house in the summer months when we were bored. Then, one Memorial weekend, when I was splashing in the pool with my friends, Harry tried to touch my mom.

We were all screaming and splashing each other, so none of us really noticed when he walked through the gate. I remember climbing around my father like a monkey in the pool. I was trying to launch myself off his shoulders to do a front flip over my mom. She rarely got in the pool because she did not like the feeling of chlorine on her skin. I was so excited to show off and do something ‚Äòcool‚Äô -- but mainly stupid -- to get her attention. My dad took a deep breath and ducked under the water, allowing me to place my feet on top of his shoulders. Before I could jump off, a dark body moved under the water, sneaking towards my mom. I saw pale, fat hands reach out for her waist when my father shot up like a torpedo, throwing me backward into the water.

I sputtered and coughed as water filled my mouth. My sinuses burned as the chlorine worked its way through my nose and back out again. My father was yelling obscenities at Harry. My mother, who was a bigger woman, was huddled behind my father looking unusually small. I pressed myself to her back and squeezed her in my arms as confusion and fear swirled inside me at the sudden change in mood. Her warm arms curled around me as she took another step further behind my dad. Harry frowned as my father raged at him.

‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt like me,‚Äù Harry said, his tone more reminiscent of a toddler than a grown man.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like you trying to put your fucking hands on my wife. Stay away from her, stay away from my kid!‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt understood completely what had happened at that time, but I knew Harry had tried to do something to my mom she didn‚Äôt want. My father‚Äôs anger combined with my mother‚Äôs uneasiness made me more wary of Harry after that. Suddenly, I was much more aware of his size and strange demeanor towards us kids after that. Walking back to our house that hot afternoon, my father was stern about not going around Harry under any circumstances, including Peggy. This didn‚Äôt stop me from getting my friends to nab me drinks and candy from her trunk whenever I could that summer, of course. I kept away from their house easy enough, but a lot of the kids used their backyard to get to their houses faster. I would sneak by as well, trying to avoid being seen by Harry or any other neighbors who might tell my parents.

I swallowed back bile as I fought the urge to glance down the street where the Taylor house still butted up against our street. Still unable to face that house, I started up the pathway towards my house instead. The concrete is cracked and dirty, but no weeds grow in between the lines. I straightened my back as I tried to push away the last remains of my anxiety and knocked on the front door. I heard rustling inside accompanied by a hacking, phlegmy cough that made my nose wrinkle. *Good ol‚Äô dad*, I thought as the door swung open.

The grayness in my dad‚Äôs beard caught me off guard as he opened the door. He wore the same clothes as always, a dirty flannel with blue jeans and a fishing cap. It‚Äôd been so long since I'd been back here that it only just hit me at that moment how old my father was. A phone call every three months hadn‚Äôt really translated his age to me clearly. His familiar, brown eyes lit up though when he saw me, despite the tiredness I could see radiating throughout his body. He pulled me in for a tight hug. Guilt twisted deep inside my stomach as he pulled away smiling and patting my back. I tried to smile back despite it.

‚ÄúHappy you‚Äôre home, son.‚Äù

I let out a quick sigh of relief at his words. I felt ten years old again looking at my father, happy that he was not angry with me like I had feared. I answered automatically.

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù

I followed him through familiar halls. He hadn‚Äôt changed much of the house since mom and I left. It was painfully easy to see how my father hadn‚Äôt moved on after the divorce. Underneath layers of dust, old family photos sat on nicotine-yellowed wallpaper that was peeling. He hadn‚Äôt gotten rid of anything after we left. I stepped through crowded halls of stacked papers, mail, boxes, fans, and other materials my dad had been collecting all these years. It is a horrible feeling to have to squeeze through doorways you used to run through. I hummed noncommittally as my father rambled and led me up the stairs towards my old room. I was only half paying attention trying not to trip on the stairs. My dad hovered behind me slightly as I placed my bags on top of my old bed.

I glanced around the room, my eyes unconsciously skipping past the window where if you looked out you could see the Taylor house and get a peak of the back fence between the trees and layers of green kudzu. I scoured the room, wracking my brain for any conversion point that didn‚Äôt have to do with the current state of my childhood home or state of mind. I moved towards my closet just to see how many more boxes and files of junk my dad had crammed in there. A small square opening still sat in the middle of my closet where my dad had opened the wall to fix some of the plumbing. He never did close it despite promising my mom repeatedly that he would get around to it. It seems like he still hasn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúI was meaning to clean up in here,‚Äù my dad started awkwardly, ‚Äúwhen you said you were coming to visit. I‚Äôve been busy with work and haven‚Äôt gotten around to it.‚Äù

I smiled a little bitterly at the familiar phrase spilling from his lips. *Heard that one before*, I thought. I squashed down the annoyance with a heavy dose of guilt. It wasn‚Äôt completely my father‚Äôs fault that he wasn‚Äôt entirely present in my life after eleven. I just couldn‚Äôt handle the thought of coming back here after what I saw.

*Face your fears. You can‚Äôt move forward if you can‚Äôt look back.*

I repeated the phrase in my head until I gathered enough courage to ask my father the questions I‚Äôd been fearing most.

‚ÄúIs Harry Taylor really dead?‚Äù

The words slipped out without much thought. I couldn‚Äôt see my dad‚Äôs expression as my eyes were locked onto the hole in my closet. He paused for such a long time that I turned to face him to make sure he heard what I said. The lines on his face were exaggerated as he frowned at me. He seemed hesitant to speak or perhaps unsure of what to say. My father wasn‚Äôt one to wax poetry.

¬†‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I saw on the news,‚Äù he said.

I nodded. ‚ÄúSame here.‚Äù

The news story had been what prompted me to call my father. News anchors talked about a local lunatic who killed his sister dying due to health complications. They talked over old pictures of Peggy, crime scene photos, Harry‚Äôs mugshot, and in the end how Harry had been deemed unfit for trial due to extreme mental distress after being caught. Harry could not stop screaming at the slightest hint of tall grass or creeping vine. He was placed without much afterthought into a mental hospital as he was a danger to himself and others by reacting out in violet fits of anger at unseen forces. No one knew that what Harry had seen had been real. No one except me. I took a shuddering breath, still fighting back against memories I didn‚Äôt want to explore.

‚ÄúDo you think it‚Äôs true? How he died?‚Äù

My father grunted in confusion. ‚ÄúOf course I do. He was a fat bastard back then, and he just got worse at the hospital. If Crazy Harry wasn‚Äôt going take himself out, his heart was gonna fail ‚Äòim anyway.‚Äù

I swallowed against the lump in my throat, desperate to believe that to be true, but there was a nagging voice in my head that wouldn‚Äôt quit.

‚ÄúWhat if she did it?‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

""Peggy!‚Äù I exclaimed, leaping up from the dusty mattress in a sudden burst of anxious energy.

‚ÄúSon, Peggy Taylor is dead. You know Harry did it. We found her body for God‚Äôs sake!‚Äù His voice loud with anger by the end of his sentence. ‚ÄúNow, I know it was a lot for a young boy to see. We knew something was up at that house even if no one would say it outright. You shouldn‚Äôt have been with me that day. But you‚Äôre an adult now ‚Äì a grown man. Sometimes a man has to face the world as it is and move on.‚Äù

I blinked owlishly, confused and angered by his words. It was ironic to hear from someone who couldn‚Äôt throw out an old piece of mail.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶but you were there. You saw,‚Äù I whispered.

My father pressed his lips in a thin line but didn‚Äôt respond. I looked away feeling hurt and disappointed. I sat back down on the bed and brought legs up to rest. In a familiar motion, I started to rub small circles into the skin of my ankle.

*See. Nothing is there. Nothing‚Äôs got you.*

I took some deep breaths and began to count them in my head until I could calm down. A heavy sigh came from behind me. I tried to ignore it and the dark pull of familiar memories flashing through my mind. I jumped as my dad laid a hand on my shoulder. He squeezed it tight as he said,

‚ÄúLook, I didn‚Äôt to start a fight. You‚Äôre just so quick to freak out. I never know what is going to set you off.‚Äù

I frowned deeply. Suddenly, I was eleven again pleading with my parents to believe me. To my father‚Äôs credit, he had rushed after me once he heard me screaming. I remember he was gripping me tightly underneath my armpits. The vines wrapped tightly around my ankles, nearly crushing the bones underneath. I just remember screaming and yelling as the plant-like vines slithered back menacingly into the dark shadows of the Taylors' living room. There had been just enough light to see Harry‚Äôs swollen legs kicking in the air as he was being strangled by a homemade noose woven together with thick, leafy vines. The large shadow of a woman miraculously standing on broken legs at the other end holding the rope. I remember the swell of anxious people and sirens, causing the dark shadow to disappear deeper into the house.

The bruises around my ankles had been attributed to Harry yanking me into his house through the back door. That‚Äôs what my father ended up telling the police once they arrived. They never could explain why my bruises looked so uniform, more like deep purple lines of rope than handprints. The same ones I‚Äôd seen forming on Harry‚Äôs neck when he was carried out on a stretcher. I gritted my teeth together to keep some semblance of composure as I fought against the flood of panic overloading my system.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine,‚Äù I muttered, obviously upset but neither of us addressed it.

There was an awkward quiet moment before my dad‚Äôs phone began to ring. He stepped out of the room to answer it. I rubbed my eyes tiredly as his grumbling voice traveled softly through the thin, wooden door. He didn‚Äôt sound happy. He came into the room cursing, rubbing his mouth and beard in irritation.

‚ÄúI was supposed to be off today, but someone‚Äôs water heater broke. They said they‚Äôd pay me double in cash if I could come right now. You‚Äôll be okay for a few hours?‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSure. But they‚Äôre calling you after hours. Is that allowed?‚Äù

‚ÄúFor double the cash, my bank account says it is.‚Äù

I assured him I would be fine. He looked so tired again, so old. *He‚Äôll work himself to death*, I realized. He patted my shoulder as he left. I didn‚Äôt respond. My eyes were unable to resist the pull towards the window, towards the Taylor house. I walked up to see my father‚Äôs blue truck disappear down the road. My eyes flickered towards the Taylors‚Äô yard. The fence was grey with weather damage. Some planks were missing causing gaps where I could just make out tall grass and overgrown weeds, the same as that day. I went with my dad and a few of his workers to clean up the Taylors' overgrown lawn. The city had called him saying the house was being condemned and wanted a quote for his hourly rate to clean their yard. Flexing my hand, I could still recall the ticklish feeling of grass as I remember once running my hands back and forth against the blades that poked through the gaps in the Taylors' fence. I had been too focused on keeping my giggling quiet to pay attention to what the grown-ups were talking about.

Peggy had been missing for over three months by that point. July in the south was hot and humid. The rain brought no relief, just a muggy dampness that clung to your skin. My father had me mowing the grass weekly by that point. He joked about starting to teach me the trade to take over for him one day. So, I noticed as the Taylors‚Äô lawn grew more out of control as Harry had retreated into his house in some kind of voluntary self-confinement since she went missing. Many neighbors gossiped about Peggy‚Äôs disappearance and Harry‚Äôs sudden agoraphobic retreat into their house. We kids would joke that he had killed his sister and had eaten her to hide his crime, adding to the many stories we told about Crazy Harry. This game didn‚Äôt go on for long as it often made us feel guilty because we all missed Peggy and felt her lack of presence in the neighborhood. It all had felt too still, too quiet after she had disappeared.

We hadn‚Äôt realized just how close we‚Äôd been to the truth.

I whirled away from my bedroom window with a gagging cough. I needed something to help me calm down. I dug through my bag until I came across the glass jar with my bag of weed inside and a few small cigars. My dad often rolled his own cigarettes in a small silver machine. He‚Äôd placed the cigarette paper in one end and piled on tobacco in the other. A tiny hand-crank rolled the cigarette and pushed the tobacco in one. I had been fascinated by this as a child, thinking it was a fun game. My mother did not find it as funny as my dad did.

I floated down the stairs and down a hallway into the kitchen. There was a heavy musk in the air. I frowned, not daring to open the fridge or the trashcan. I knew my dad struggled to throw out food alongside everything else. On the worn, wooden kitchen table, I found the tobacco rolling machine underneath some clutter. I spent time unrolling the small cigars and adding the contents to my dad‚Äôs half-empty bag of loose-leaf tobacco lying next to the machine. I put the cigar paper on the rolling side and the weed on the opposite side to make a few blunts. I would need them to survive this weekend.

As it got darker, I rummaged through the kitchen to find something that wasn‚Äôt expired or moldy. I put together a depressing meal of microwave cheese quesadillas and slunk back up the stairs into my old room. I found myself sitting in the dark staring out the window, unable to break free of bad memories. I told myself I had left the lights off so my dad would think I was sleeping when he got home, but deep down, I knew the truth. I was afraid to turn on the lights and let that house know I was there. That it would somehow see me and come back for me to finish the job.

The later it got, the more antsy I became. *Where was my dad? Could a water heater take this long to replace?* A rush of anxious thoughts made me reach for my phone. I dialed my father‚Äôs number and lit the in my blunt mouth. I stroked a match, illuminating my hands in an orange glow. The cherry glowed as the match died out, leaving me in darkness once again. Nothing. It rang all the way through to his voicemail. I didn‚Äôt bother leaving one as he never checked anyway. I threw my phone aside and moved towards the window. Rolling it up to blow smoke outside and watching the street for my father‚Äôs truck. Once again, I was unable to look away from the Taylor house. I took deep drags, feeling my body slip deeper into relaxed state. One which has much less inhibitions and lacking signals to my frontal lope for deep decision making. I felt all my rage at this house, at Harry, my father, and the thing I saw there rise up inside me. Anger boiled hot inside my stomach as I recalled my father‚Äôs earlier words. *You have to face things as they are*. I had to see it up close again -- go to the Taylor house once more. I couldn‚Äôt keep sitting here terrified like I‚Äôve always been. It had to stop.

I tore down the stairs and out the front door. I flipped my hoodie up, wanting to hide my face as I walked down the street. I took deep drags and welcomed the burning feeling in my lungs. It reminded me that I was real. The Taylor house grew closer, and I have to admit the burst of confidence inside the house vanished in the middle of the dark road stretching out in front of me. I tried to keep to the sides of the road, out of the range of streetlights in case other neighbors were out. I sucked nervously on the end of the blunt. My eyes darted towards the bushes and around the long, overgrown yard waiting for something to emerge. The house loomed menacingly over me. Some windows were boarded up, while others stood smashed. I could see through one of the second story windows that part of the roof had caved in. It‚Äôs strange how frail the whole house looked compared to my nightmares.

I had been excited to be at work with my dad on the job. I was ready to prove to my dad that I could take over his business one day. We were out right after dawn, despite being a few houses down. My dad and his workers stood around with cups of coffee, talking and laughing. None were in a hurry to start like I was. I remember growing bored and annoyed by the chatter about Crazy Harry and where Peggy could be. I began to walk deeper into the yard, mesmerized by the buzzing hum of insects and tall grass. I remember peeking through gaps in the backyard gate, eyes bouncing back and forth for any signs of movement. Now, I stood squinting in the dark, unable to make out any signs of life. In fact, the air felt much more still now than it had then. I hunched in the dark with my head cocked, straining to hear if anyone was nearby. I liked my lips nervously as an uneasy feeling caused my throat to tighten. Ice licked up my back in hot flashes of anxiety as I realized that I couldn‚Äôt hear anything at all. No insects, no dogs barking, no signs of life existed behind this gate. I crushed the blunt underneath my foot as I took a shaky breath.

*Was it because it‚Äôs night?* ¬†*But weren‚Äôt animals usually more active at night?* I knew from many night walks that it was never truly quiet after dark if you were listening right. Except if something is wrong. This unnatural silence filled me with terror. My mind filling in the blanks of what larger predator lurked in the darkness. A flash of light caught my attention. I turned to see headlights growing larger as a car drove down the road towards the cul-de-sac. Scared of being caught, I yanked the gate open and stepped through. The darkness swallowed me with the *clink* of the metal gate latching close. My hands flew in front of me instinctively to try to help me gather my bearings. Much like stepping into my childhood home, the familiar space of the Taylors‚Äô backyard transported me back. I shuffled forward through memories trying to remember the layout of the backyard.

The morning sun had blinded me as I stepped into the backyard. I remember squinting and stumbling around as I tried not to trip over the large weed eater my dad had handed me that morning. A sour, sweet smell assaulted my senses. I remember the smell causing my eyes to water. I blinked tears out of my eyes and threw my shirt over my mouth and nose, abandoning the weed eater. I blinked and gagged, lost in the dark once more. My feet stumble into a familiar, worn wooden garden bed. I can hear a faint, wet squirming noise. I thought the mass was Peggy once more, but instead a mass of mutilated animal bodies lay before me. Birds, small mammals, pets -- all in various stages of decay. Just like that day I had found Peggy laying shriveled like a carved pumpkin with a wide, skeletal grin stretched wide across her face as her lips had dried off as she had been baking in the summer sun all these months without anyone noticing. I stared deeply in her wide, milky eyes only to feel sick as the moist, white mass of giant maggots sat wriggling inside her empty eye sockets. Peggy‚Äôs body was contorted in an unnatural way. Her right arm bent backwards at the elbow and her legs facing the wrong direction, and her head was further down her chest than it should be. I realized then that Harry must have cut her limbs off to make it easier to hide her in the garden bed. My vision swam as the body of Peggy Taylor and the current rotting pile of animals flickered before me and for a moment, I couldn‚Äôt tell which was real.

I threw myself backwards and slipped in the dewy grass. A wheezing grunt escaped my lips as I landed square on my back, knocking all the air out of my lungs. My head falls back as I gasp for breath. A soft swishing noise caught my attention. I glanced towards the house where the noise originated. The grass swayed and I thought it was just a trick of the wind. Then the grass shook and shuttered as it parted in tandem with the movements of something I couldn‚Äôt see. Before I could react, dark vines shot forward from the darkness. They wrapped tightly around my upper arms and neck. It pinched and chaffed my skin as the tendrils flex and curled much like large muscle. It was woodier than I remember with sharp thorns breaking through my skin. It pulled me deeper into darkness, and I started to struggle in earnest now. My legs flailed wildly as I clawed at the thick vine encasing my throat. I pawed my pockets for anything to use as a weapon, but all I had was the lighter. I had left my phone back inside my bedroom in hurry to get here.

My fingernails broke as I clawed helplessly at the earth, pulling up dirt and chunks of grass. Dark spots floated across my vision as a I gasped like a fish for air. My back scrapped against the small concrete porch and pieces of broken glass as I was pulled into the living room. At least when I was younger, it had grabbed me by my ankles. I was free to scream. Now, it was all I could do to hang onto consciousness, let alone cry out for help. I kicked and struggled to stand on my tip toes to try to gain some leverage. It was useless. The vines were lifting me from the ground. Tears sprung to my eyes as spit foamed at my mouth. I didn‚Äôt want to die in the dark. It was so quiet except for the sounds of my flailing and something else I could just barely make out.

It sounded like short bursts of breath. I thought at first it was my lungs being wrung out of every last drop of air, but it came from a dark corner of the living room. Where the vines entangling me originated from. My eyes rolled in that direction. A familiar, hulking shape emerged from the shadows. The quick, hissing breaths blending together into what sounded like someone trying to laugh without any air.

*Hah. Hah. Hah. Hah.*

She was just standing there. I couldn‚Äôt make out her expression, but I could feel those empty eyes sockets stuck on me like a second skin. Still, I kicked and fought against mt bindings. My lungs burned for oxygen. She drew closer, swaying uneasily on poorly reconstructed legs. With each step closer it sounded like a creaking watermelon about to burst. The vines loosened around my neck letting me just brace enough weight on my tiptoes not to choke. I gasped but my chest was tight and aching, and it felt like breathing through a straw. The smell hit me first. A nauseating mixture of fruit and dirt left to rot in the sun. She stepped closer, her smell wafting over me in waves. The wet warmth of her scent confused me against the coldness of the room. Even the vines wrapped around my body were cold and ridged and nothing about her resembled life except for the unnatural way she was animated.

Staring into Peggy Taylor‚Äôs remade face, there was nothing resembling the nice woman I once knew. Her legs and arms were a matrix of grass, wood, and garden vegetables but put back together strangely, as if someone put her back together with their eyes closed. She stumbled and jerked around me wildly, arms failing and swinging backwards in the sockets. Parts of her were rotting and sagging with fungus and brown rot. I could see Peggy‚Äôs stomach was wriggling with life. Large and distended with worms and other life breaking down her body as she remade it again and again. I knew I was next, just like those animals in the garden bed. I was nothing more than a rabbit struggling in a trap, ensnaring itself deeper. She continued to circle me like a shark. I tried to kick out or fight back but ended up choking myself. Snot and tears rolled down my face as I prayed that she would end this soon.

The huffing returned and I squeezed my eyes shut. I didn‚Äôt want to see my end. I sent a small thought to my parents, hoping they would be okay without me. The huffing turned into thundering footsteps accompanied by a loud yell. My eyes flew open to see my father clutching a pair of hedge shears. His face was bright red as he swung the clippers around, snapping them at Peggy‚Äôs mutilated form. Her body swayed on uneven legs as she snarled at my dad. He caught her right wrist in the shears as she tried to take a swing at him. A sickening crunch filled the room as he sliced her hand off. A yellowish fluid spewed from the open wound, making the rotting sweet smell even stronger. My father gagged but didn‚Äôt back down from Peggy‚Äôs terrifying screech.

She tried to charge him. My dad twisted his body to slam his shoulder into her chest. Peggy‚Äôs body was soft from the mold. His shoulder didn‚Äôt meet much resistance as she fell backwards. This caused her backward legs to crack open, green flesh and brown seeds splattered all over the floor. I kicked out, trying to help but choked instead. At the sound of me sputtering, my dad quickly turned towards me and snapped the vine circling my throat. I fell in a heap on the dirty wooden floor. I coughed and rubbed my sore throat. Dad rushed to my side.

‚ÄúI got you.‚Äù he said, hauling me up to my feet.

I looked back to see Peggy trying to drag herself towards us. I could see tiny tendrils and insects attempting to knit her legs back together. I tried to scream out to warn my dad but. Nothing but a scratchy yelp escaped my lips. It caught my father‚Äôs attention. His face drained of all color seeing her hulking form squirming towards us.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù He shouted, trying to push me forward.

But I knew it wouldn‚Äôt stop. She would never stop. All these years of terror and tears turned into rage inside my body. I was so tired of running. I broke free from my dad‚Äôs grasp and fished the lighter out of my pocket. The yard was full of overgrown dead grass from the summer droughts. Perfect for fuel. I took my lighter and tried lighting smaller pieces, blowing on them to ignite them further. It kind of worked. The smaller pieces caught easily, but I was having trouble building the fire. My father joined me building piles of dry grass. A huge gust of wind ripped through the yard. I gasped seeing the burning ashes twirl and spin in the air. *There goes our chance,* I thought. But the wind changed, blowing the ashes and dead grass into the Taylor house.

The house lit up like a tinderbox. It stood no chance against the burning grass with all that exposed wood that‚Äôs been baking under the sun all summer. We sprinted home, a haunting, inhumane scream chasing us. My father was wheezing heavily, but he kept pace with me. He called the police immediately. Claimed he came home from a late job to see the house up in flames. ¬†With no other witnesses or any security camera footage, they didn‚Äôt have much to build off. The street soon erupted in activity. Neighbors were pulling sleepy loved ones and pets out of homes in case other houses caught. We hovered nervously, but luckily the fire had been contained to the Taylor house. Reassured that we hadn‚Äôt killed anyone; we retreated into the kitchen. Neither of us spoke a word.

My father opened the kitchen window digging through his own pockets for his lighter. He pulled out a cigarette. His hands were shaking so violently I was afraid he would burn himself trying to light it. I stood up and gently took the cig from him. My dad turned to me, his eyes wide and glassy. My dad buried his face in my shoulder as his body heaved with sobs. I wrapped my arm around him, whispering soft words I once wished he would say to me all those years ago. The swelling of my throat made my words come out harsh and garbled. *It‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôre alright. It‚Äôs gone now.* I rubbed his back, marveling at how he sniffled and struggled to take in breath.

The Taylor house was gone. Nothing more than a dark smudge on the concrete foundation. It was astonishing to see something so big and haunting from my childhood just slip away in a fiery *whoosh.*

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt hurt you,‚Äù I whispered softly to my father.

I know I didn‚Äôt. Personally I never had one as a kid and if I‚Äôm being honest I never knew anyone that did. My son Christian is 7 and since he was a toddler he has always had a big imagination. From your typical Nerf battles to booking an entire pay-per view for his wrestling action figures, Chris always found a way to keep himself entertained. He really is such a good kid, he always means well. Although Chris is a sweetheart, let‚Äôs just say he is a little socially awkward. He struggled making friends, even in preschool he generally kept to himself. So you can imagine my excitement the one day he came home from school and said he made a new friend. I was so proud of him, this was a big step for the little guy. Even though he was only 7 I thought it was great that he finally was getting along with another kid.

Ever since we moved Chris had been struggling even more than normal. Maybe it was the new environment that he wasn‚Äôt used to or maybe it was the whole ‚Äúnot fitting in‚Äù thing. Hearing crying and sniffling in the middle of the night became the normal for a few weeks. It truly broke my heart. But hearing about this friend Chris made, maybe it would help him to get better. He really did deserve to be happy. We had downsized and moved to a smaller town because I lost my job. My wife Alyssa was now the sole breadwinner. While that was not ideal the best I could do now was to be a good father and husband while I looked for a new job. 

The day Chris came home to tell me about his new friend I was browsing the internet searching for a new job. It had been another unsuccessful search. Chris busted through the front door out of breath. 

‚ÄúDaddy!! I did it! I made a friend! His name is Richie! He is the coolest! He has this super awesome Yo-yo that he showed me! DAD‚Ä¶I NEED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!!‚Äù 

I laughed and said ‚ÄúAlright buddy slow it down it‚Äôs only September! But tell me more about this new friend you made.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad he is so funny, everyone at school loves him and I know you will too!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell DUDE he is gonna have to come by one day so we can all eat pizza and watch some wrestling!‚Äù

‚ÄúOH MY GOSH THAT WILL BE SO AWESOME!!‚Äù

Chris excitedly ran to his room and I yelled down the hall ‚ÄúGet started on your homework and let me know if you need any help!‚Äù 

I haven‚Äôt been this happy in weeks. As a dad and husband you just want your family to be happy. After seeing the look on my son‚Äôs face, I couldn‚Äôt help but to smile from ear to ear. When my wife came home I couldn‚Äôt wait to tell her the news. I know it may not sound like the biggest deal to you but that little boy is our world and seeing him down in the dumps really crushed us. Alyssa was just as excited as I was that Chris seemed like he had finally settled in. She went to his room to hear the news straight from him. I was sitting there eavesdropping when I heard Alyssa yell out ‚ÄúBabe?!‚Äù In a worried voice. 

I made my way towards Chris‚Äô room and once I got through the door my wife was pointing at Chris. With a smile on her face she said ‚ÄúHoney, who is this big boy and what has he done with our little baby?!‚Äù 

Chris chuckled and said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still me Ma, I just wanna look cool like Richie!‚Äù Chris was digging through his closet trying to find his favorite Ninja Turtle sweatshirt.

That night before bed my wife and I shared a look. We were happy, the first time we‚Äôve been happy since we had to move.
We shared a kiss and went to bed.

For the next week or so Chris would come home as happy as can be. He would tell me about what he was learning in school and how Richie was just the ‚Äúbestest‚Äù friend. He would tell me about all the new toys Richie had and how he would let Chris play with them. I told Chris if they ever planned on hanging out outside of school I would need to meet his parents. Chris said he knows that but not to worry because Richie told him his parents said they weren‚Äôt allowed to hang outside of school. I thought that was strange but just chalked it up to Richie‚Äôs parents being strict. When I mentioned to Alyssa about Richie not being able to hang outside of school she told me not to worry about it. She told me Chris was happy, WE were happy, and things were finally going smooth. She was right, Chris was fitting in and our home life as a family was great because of it.

As the school year went on I did notice something. It was pretty obvious because we were tight on cash, ya know due to the whole ‚Äújobless‚Äù thing. Chris would come home from school and almost weekly would have some sort of new toy he was playing with. A hot wheels car, Hess truck, airplane, wrestler, basketball. All things we didn‚Äôt buy him. Whenever I asked him about it he would always tell me the same thing. ‚ÄúRichie let me borrow it!‚Äù While I didn‚Äôt think it was necessarily strange for kids to share toys. I did think it was strange that it was almost every week. Where is Richie getting these toys. It was a relatively small town and to my knowledge it wasn‚Äôt a particularly wealthy area, so I doubted someone could afford all these toys.

When I brought up the toy situation with Alyssa she did seem a bit concerned. She was wondering the same thing I was. Where were these toys coming from.

‚ÄúOkay this is gonna sound bad. Do you think Chris is taking these toys from the school or maybe even a student? Is Richie even real?‚Äù As the words left my mouth I realize it sounded much worse than what I had imagined. Chris was a bit of a different kid, sure. But he wasn‚Äôt a liar. At least I didn‚Äôt think so. Maybe I was jumping to conclusions. Take a look from my perspective though. We are hearing all these amazing things about ‚ÄúRichie‚Äù. Chris has never once mentioned him coming over, sleeping over, or even going over to Richie‚Äôs house. He didn‚Äôt talk about any other friends or students. He came home with a different toy almost weekly and always had the same excuse as to how he got it.

Alyssa looked at me with worried eyes. ‚ÄúGod, I hope not. Things were finally starting to look up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I am going to ask him about it and see what he says.‚Äù

As I made my way down the stairs to Chris‚Äô room I thought I heard something. It sounded like muffled talking coming from his room but I couldn‚Äôt quite make out what was being said. I stopped in my tracks and thought for a second. What if Chris was struggling so much to fit in he made Richie up. What if Richie is what Chris wants a friend to be. What If Richie is Chris‚Äô imaginary friend. My heart sank. I hoped that wasn‚Äôt the case but that would certainly explain some things. The lack of other friends, the fact that Chris never asked if Richie could come over, and now the talking. What if Chris was talking to his imaginary friend. What do I say, what do I do? Will this just be a phase? I didn‚Äôt have the answers. Standing around in the hallway wasn‚Äôt going to get me any either. I knocked on Chris‚Äô door and walked inside.

‚ÄúHey dude, how‚Äôs school going?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs soooo good dad‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah why‚Äôs that? Let me guess, Richie?‚Äù I said with a forced smile

‚ÄúYeah! He is the best! He is always giving me stuff, like these toys!‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted to ask you about that Chris, are you um, are you sure Richie is giving you these toys?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatcha mean daddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you taking them from the school maybe? Another kid? You know, just borrowing them of course.‚Äù

Chris sat there for a second and seemed to be thinking. ‚ÄúNo dad, Richie is giving me these toys. I told you that! What did ya forget or something?‚Äù He started giggling.

I smiled at him and thought about how happy he was. I gave him a big hug and left his room. I spent the whole night just thinking to myself, what am I gonna do about this? 

It had been a few days since my little talk with Chris. He hasn‚Äôt mentioned Richie any more than usual and he hasn‚Äôt come home with any new toys. I had finally had luck with job searching. Funny enough as I was scrolling through endless pages I came across a job listing at Chris‚Äô school. It was for a janitor. I know it doesn‚Äôt sound like the most glorious job but I knew any amount of extra income would help. I applied and quickly received an email from the school to set up an interview for the next day. I knew Alyssa would be happy and I figured Chris would be too. Even though I would be working, at least it was at his school where I could see him throughout the day. If I‚Äôm being honest a little piece of me was eager to see if ‚ÄúRichie‚Äù was in fact a real kid and not some made up imaginary friend. 

I waited on the front porch to meet Chris as he got off the bus. We lived close to the school but just far enough away that he still required a bus. As Chris got off the bus I can see he had his head down. I met him in the street and asked what was wrong. When he looked at me I could tell he had been crying. He hadn‚Äôt cried in weeks, it had me worried.

‚ÄúChris what happened?! Are you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúTell me what‚Äôs wrong kiddo.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Richie dad, he is leaving. He said he was moving and today was his last day.‚Äù He said as tears started to stream down his face.

‚ÄúOh man, I‚Äôm so sorry buddy. Come here.‚Äù I hugged him tight. I took his backpack off his shoulders and we continued towards the house. Chris didn‚Äôt leave his room for the rest of the night. He didn‚Äôt eat dinner. He just cried. When Alyssa came home I broke the news to her. She was upset but had hopes that Chris would be able to make some new friends. 

Alyssa was in the shower when I decided I would go check on Chris and say goodnight. I made my way down the stairs towards his room. I stopped moving when I heard Chris talking. I couldn‚Äôt quite make out what he was saying through the door but as I got closer to his room the words became more clear.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon Richie do you really have to go. We had so much fun. You are my best friend and I really wish you could just stay with me.‚Äù

Before I knocked on the door an odd feeling came over me. This all but proved that Richie wasn‚Äôt real. Who could he be talking to. He didn‚Äôt have a cell phone. Richie wasn‚Äôt in the house. I proceeded to knock on his door and enter the room. There was Chris, sitting on his bed, walkie-talkie in hand. Not knowing what else to say I asked him.

‚ÄúWho are you talking to?‚Äù

‚ÄúRichie, daddy, I was telling him I don‚Äôt want him to leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúRichie gave that to you? Richie is real?‚Äù

‚ÄúRichie is my friend dad, of course he is real.‚Äù

I took the walkie-talkie from his hand and pressed down the button.

‚ÄúHello!.. Who‚Äôs there?! ‚Ä¶ Is this Richie?! ‚Ä¶Answer me!‚Äù

There was no answer. No noise from whoever had the other walkie talkie. Silence. I proceeded to ask Chris about Richie.

‚ÄúRichie gave you this? Why? Does he live close by?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno, he gave it to me a while ago. We talk on it all the time.‚Äù

That must‚Äôve what I heard the other night. Chris was talking to Richie or whoever it was that had the other walkie-talkie. Richie must live close by. He has to be close to have a strong enough signal to talk to Chris. I took the walkie-talkie away from him. I kissed him on the head. Told him I loved him and that I would be taking him to school tomorrow. I didn‚Äôt even get to tell him that I was going to hopefully be working at his school. 

The next morning I made some eggs for me and Chris. I asked how he was feeling and he just shrugged. I assumed he was upset about Richie moving and he was angry that I took the walkie-talkie away. Regardless it was time to head to school. Once we parked I grabbed Chris from the backseat. He looked at me strangely.

‚ÄúDad whatcha doing? You‚Äôre supposed to drop me off.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know bud but today is different! I may get a job at your school, I‚Äôm here to talk to your principal! I may become your new janitor! Now I know-‚Äú I was cut off by Chris‚Äô cries. He ran into the school with tears streaming down his face. Did he really not want me to work at the school? Was it embarrassing to have your dad here or was it embarrassing that I may be a janitor? Either way I hurried to the principal‚Äôs office, I didn‚Äôt want to be late for the interview. I walked into the office right on time and spoke to the secretary. 

‚ÄúHello, I‚Äôm here to see Mr. Golding. I have an interview today.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh yes, you must be here for the janitor position that opened up. I‚Äôm really gonna miss the old one.‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúI really never met a sweeter man. Anyway right this way Mr. Golding is waiting for you inside.‚Äù

I walked into the office with my head held high. I needed this job so I was there to impress. Mr. Golding was seated behind the desk but stood up as I walked into. He reached out a hand and I graciously excepted.

‚ÄúHello Mr. Golding, it‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to interview for this position.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course Mr. Williams thank you for coming for the interview so quickly. We need to fill the position ASAP. As you can guess a school can get quite messy.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI could only imagine. My son, Chris is a 2nd grader here and he is always making some sort of mess.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm being honest Mr. Williams after looking over your resume you are definitely more than qualified to work here. You seem like a man with a good head on his shoulders, you were punctual, and if I‚Äôm being honest because Richard left us so suddenly we are a bit desperate to fill his position. So if you would like it the job is yours!‚Äù

A giant smile spread across my face. The tension instantly released from my shoulders. I finally got another job. I was beyond happy. I quickly accepted the job without hesitiation.

‚ÄúThank you so much Mr. Golding! I promise you won‚Äôt regret this. You don‚Äôt understand how badly I needed this job!‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Williams welcome aboard! I have the master keys here in this drawer let me just grab them.‚Äù Mr. Golding reached into his bottom drawer and pulled out a large set of keys. ‚ÄúEvery key is labeled, the Janitor‚Äôs equipment is in a supply container in the back of the school. Thank you for taking the job on short notice!‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt believe how fast of a process that was. I figured there was going to be at least 1 more interview. The fact that I could start right away was all the more reason to be excited. I looked at the keys in my hand while walking down the hallway and decided I wanted to check out how the previous Janitor kept the equipment. As I approached the supply container I froze in place. In my excitement of getting the job I completely brushed past the fact the Janitor‚Äôs name was Richard. This couldn‚Äôt be THE Richie that Chris was talking about, could it? No, that didn‚Äôt make any sense. It had to be a coincidence. Richard is a common name. Plus this was a school. No way none of the teachers or students didn‚Äôt notice anything out of the ordinary. As I inserted the key into the lock my hands were shaking. I didn‚Äôt do a very good job of convincing myself that a grown man did not befriend my son. I twisted the key and removed the lock. 

What I found inside activated a concoction of feelings in me I had never felt at the same time. Rage, anguish, hate, nervousness, sadness all in one. The walls were lined with Children‚Äôs movie posters. Action figures spread about the small coffee table inside. Nerf guns laid on a dusty old couch. That‚Äôs when I saw it. A fucking walkie-talkie. The same walkie-talkie that Chris had the night before. Whoever this sick bastard was, was talking to my fucking 7 year old son. Tears started coming down my face like someone had turned on a faucet. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was frozen in time. I started ripping the place apart. I don‚Äôt know if it was out of anger or if I was looking for something specific. I did not care I was just moving. Toys, snacks, candy. What the fuck. The last drawer I opened I truly wish I hadn‚Äôt. I was staring down at pictures. Pictures of my son. My son and this sick fuck ‚ÄúRichie‚Äù. Taking selfies together like it was some sort of fucked up prom picture. I had to leave. I ran to Chris‚Äô class picked him up and headed straight toward the exit. While holding my crying son, I began to breakdown. Chris whispered in my ear.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never be as cool as Richie.‚Äù

1m01v6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/NOEndocrineDisruptors/comments/1m01v6j/comprehensive_guide_to_understanding_endocrine/,Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Endocrine Disruptors in Food Packaging,"This is a prompt that was generated by chatgpt. I know it's already bad that I'm using it for prompts like these so this day 1 of me posting my chatgpt prompts so no one has to search for the same question again. I hope that you find this post handy.

# üß™ Comprehensive Guide to Plastics and Endocrine Disruptors in Food Packaging

Plastic packaging can **leach hormone-disrupting chemicals**, especially when heated, reused, or used with acidic/fatty foods. Below is a complete breakdown of each major plastic type by **resin code (#1‚Äì#7)** ‚Äî which are **unsafe**, which are **safer**, and why.

# ‚ùå UNSAFE PLASTICS (High Risk of Endocrine Disruptors)

These plastics are either known to contain endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as **BPA**, **BPS**, **phthalates**, or **styrene**, or they degrade into them under stress like heat or wear.

# üî¥ #3 ‚Äì PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)

* **Common uses**: Cling film, shrink wrap, clear packaging (especially for cheese or meats), cooking oil bottles, squeeze bottles.
* **EDCs present**:
   * **Phthalates**: Used as plasticizers; interfere with testosterone and estrogen signaling.
   * **Vinyl chloride**: Precursor to PVC, known carcinogen and hormone disruptor.
* **Why it‚Äôs risky**:
   * Phthalates are **not chemically bound**, so they leach easily into fatty/greasy foods.
   * Heat accelerates migration ‚Äî **never microwave food in PVC.**
* **Regulation**: Banned in toys and baby items in the EU and U.S., but still used in food packaging.

# üî¥ #6 ‚Äì PS (Polystyrene)

* **Common uses**: Styrofoam cups and takeout containers, meat trays, egg cartons, disposable cutlery.
* **EDCs present**:
   * **Styrene**: A known carcinogen and suspected endocrine disruptor.
* **Why it‚Äôs risky**:
   * Easily migrates into **hot or acidic foods and drinks**.
   * Foam form is especially unstable ‚Äî it breaks down quickly and leaches microplastics.
* **Regulation**: Banned in food use in several U.S. cities and countries.

# üî¥ #7 ‚Äì Other (Often Polycarbonate or Mixed Plastics)

* **Common uses**: Reusable water bottles (older ones), baby bottles, food containers, coffee machine tanks, can linings.
* **EDCs present**:
   * **BPA (Bisphenol A)**: Estrogen mimic.
   * **BPS, BPF**: Often used in ""BPA-free"" alternatives; similar hormone-disrupting effects.
* **Why it‚Äôs risky**:
   * BPA leaches under **heat, UV light, or physical wear**.
   * BPA-free plastics often contain equally harmful analogues.
* **Regulation**: BPA banned in baby bottles in many countries; still widely used in other applications unless specifically labeled.

# ‚úÖ SAFER PLASTICS (Low to No Known EDC Risk)

These plastics **do not typically contain EDCs**, and are considered **stable under normal conditions** (especially when not heated or reused excessively).

# üü¢ #1 ‚Äì PET or PETE (Polyethylene Terephthalate)

* **Common uses**: Water and soda bottles, salad dressing bottles, peanut butter jars.
* **EDC risk**:
   * **Generally BPA-free**, but may leach **antimony** or **aldehydes** when exposed to heat or reused.
* **Best use**: Single use only. Avoid leaving in the sun or reusing for long-term storage.
* **Microwave/heat safe?** ‚ùå No.

# üü¢ #2 ‚Äì HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene)

* **Common uses**: Milk jugs, juice bottles, detergent bottles, cereal box liners.
* **EDC risk**:
   * **No BPA, phthalates, or known EDCs**.
* **Best use**: Excellent for food storage, freezing, and non-fatty foods.
* **Microwave/heat safe?** ‚úÖ In some cases (check label); chemically stable.

# üü¢ #4 ‚Äì LDPE (Low-Density Polyethylene)

* **Common uses**: Frozen food bags, bread bags, squeezable condiment bottles.
* **EDC risk**:
   * **No BPA or phthalates**, low risk of leaching.
* **Best use**: Cold or room temperature use, short-term storage.
* **Microwave/heat safe?** ‚ö†Ô∏è Somewhat ‚Äî avoid high heat.

# üü¢ #5 ‚Äì PP (Polypropylene)

* **Common uses**: Yogurt cups, margarine tubs, baby food containers, reusable food containers, bottle caps.
* **EDC risk**:
   * **No BPA or phthalates**, chemically resistant and heat-stable.
* **Best use**: Reheating, food prep, baby-safe applications.
* **Microwave/heat safe?** ‚úÖ Yes (when labeled microwave-safe).

# üß™ Summary Table: Plastic Safety for Food Use

|Resin Code|Type|Common Uses|EDC Risk|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**#1**|PET|Water/soda bottles|Low (don‚Äôt reuse/heat)|Safe cold, single use|
|**#2**|HDPE|Milk jugs, cereal liners|Very Low|Durable and safe|
|**#3**|PVC|Cling wrap, squeeze bottles|**High** ‚Äì phthalates|Avoid, esp. with fat/heat|
|**#4**|LDPE|Frozen food bags|Very Low|Avoid microwaving|
|**#5**|PP|Yogurt containers, baby food|Very Low|Microwave-safe|
|**#6**|PS|Foam cups, meat trays|**High** ‚Äì styrene|Avoid, esp. with heat|
|**#7**|Other (Polycarbonate, mixed)|Baby bottles, reusable containers|**High** ‚Äì BPA/BPS|Avoid unless verified safe|

# üî• Factors That Increase EDC Leaching from Plastics

Even safer plastics can become risky if:

* **Heated in microwave or dishwasher**
* **Scratched, cracked, or worn**
* **Used with hot, fatty, or acidic foods**
* **Left in direct sunlight or heat (e.g. in a car)**

# ‚úÖ Best Practices to Reduce Exposure

* ‚úîÔ∏è Use **glass, stainless steel, or silicone** for storage and reheating.
* ‚úîÔ∏è Choose **#2, #4, or #5 plastics** when glass isn‚Äôt an option.
* ‚ùå Avoid **#3, #6, and #7** for food contact entirely.
* ‚úîÔ∏è Replace worn or scratched containers.
* ‚ùå Never microwave plastic unless **labeled microwave-safe**.
* ‚úîÔ∏è Check for third-party certifications like **NSF, LFGB, or FDA food-safe**.

*August 22:*

Doctor Weber takes care to keep himself hidden from public life. It‚Äôs been three days since we passed Raleigh, and I fear it will be another day still before we make it out of the Blue Ridge and into the Piedmont. Professor Maxwell tells me that patience is a virtue and that before we know it, we‚Äôll be nestled comfortably back home in Virginia, richer than Midas and more revered than Solomon. I dare not point out that half the reason it‚Äôs taken us so long to make it down south is that he insisted on driving us down, missing the turn in Spartansburg, and leading us down a mountain path instead of the coastline I was so excited to see.¬†  
  
I mustn't be so critical of my mentor, however. Such an accomplished scientist would rarely take his assistant to an almost literal goldmine of discovery. He hasn‚Äôt told me much of this Professor Weber. Only whatever he has developed in his greenhouse could change the course of not only our lives but the lives of every starving American living in Hoovervilles and working long weeks for the sake of a quarter.¬†

I believe he lost a poor relative to starvation sometime last year, though I do not know the conditions surrounding it. I do recall his melancholic state and how often bourbon glasses surrounded his desk. I often heard him muttering a name over and over in his liquor dreams, though male or female I have no clue.¬†

What I do know is that the man I sit next to now is not that man. Here, in this truck, his blue eyes transfixed on the road, I see a man of firm resolve. The beard he‚Äôs grown in the last few months makes him look like a prospector shoved into a suit. His bowtie is scrappy as is his mood. He hasn‚Äôt even stopped to ask what I‚Äôm writing but has occasionally gone off on winded stories of how he and his family traveled through these hills often when he was a young boy. He alludes to having a sibling of some sort but drops them from conversation as soon as they‚Äôre brought up.¬†  
  
I read once that a Spanish explorer traversed this area in search of gold and glory. He died somewhere in the South I believe. However, I am certain that if his spirit lives on, it is in the heart of my dear mentor.¬†  
  
  
  
The road grows bumpy and it‚Äôs becoming harder to write. Will resume on smoother ground.¬†  
  
  
  
\*12pm- or thereabouts:\*  
  
The oddest people live in this region. Though not unkind, they are certainly a peculiar bunch. We have stopped off at a roadside gas station and drugstore, and a small barbecue hut within walking distance of the place has given me a picnic table to pen my remaining thoughts. After I ate, one of the waitresses- I believe that‚Äôs what she is at least- approached me and asked where I was heading. I told her that I was a botanist and that my mentor and I were traveling on business. I was able to point out the professor to her from my seat. He was leaning against the truck, smoking a cigar, and apparently in his own conversation with a clean-shaven man in overalls. Judging by their points and gestures, it was most likely for directions.¬†  
  
She gave him an odd look, then wiped her hand on her apron. She was older than both of us by the look of her, with curly white hair tucked neatly under a paper cap. Her clothes had the occasional grease stain and her makeup was smudged from what I could only imagine was the heat of a kitchen, and yet she stared at us both as if we were tramps in a department store.¬†  
  
‚ÄúWhere you folks headin‚Äô again?‚Äù she asked.¬†  
  
‚ÄúI forget the name exactly,‚Äù I told her, ‚Äúbut I believe its name is something like ‚ÄòPortley‚Äô or a place near there.‚Äù  
  
Her expression changed from confused disdain to wide-eyed concern. She almost dropped her ticket book as she spun around and took a seat next to me.¬†  
  
‚ÄúListen here, son,‚Äù she told me, ‚ÄúIfin it is Portley you‚Äôre going, I suggest you and your professor fella turn right on around and go back to wherever it was you come.‚Äù  
  
I protested, saying we‚Äôd already traveled all this way, and followed by asking what it was that had her so scared. She shook her head and said:  
  
‚ÄúThey ain't right up there. They just ain‚Äôt. Every once in a while, one of their ilk comes through on the way to Augusta or Athens or someplace like that, but every time they do there‚Äôs trouble.‚Äù  
  
She went on to mutter something about the way they move or talk, but she shook herself and coughed. When she stopped, she pulled out something from her pocket and placed it on the table near my paper plate. 	

‚ÄúMy family was one of the last catholic families in this region before they got tired of driving an hour to the nearest church every Sunday and converted to Baptist. Ifin you‚Äôre headin‚Äô that way, you‚Äôll want this.‚Äù

The object was a cheap rosary that was missing more than a few beads and bore a metal cross long since smudged from bright bronze to dull gold. It was brighter around the base, meaning someone had once committed regularly to hold it and pray the creed with it, making their mount cavalry out of a fist and bent knees. It was clearly a family heirloom, and one I tried to refuse, but the woman would have none of it.  
  
‚ÄúTake it, by God, and by God may it either serve you or convince you to go back. The devil walks the earth, boy, and in Georgia his home is Portley. Anything or anyone there is not worth your soul.‚Äù  
  
I wanted to ask her more, but before I knew it, she was gone and the door to the hut was slammed shut. The sliding order door was closed immeadiately after and I was left alone at my picnic bench, surrounded by the goliath pines and oaks that spread out like an ocean around me. I find myself thumbing through the beads remaining on the rosary, reliving a bit of my childhood and more than likely disappointing my poor late mother as I stumble through them. I cannot help but think of the waitress‚Äô words as I write.¬†  
  
This cross reminds me of the rosary Marie once had.  
  
The professor approaches.¬†  
  
  
  
\*Addendum:\*  
  
It seems my mentor was able to secure directions and we are now back in the car heading towards Portley. I haven‚Äôt mentioned anything to him about the rosary or the things the waitress said. However, I have noticed something concerning as we stumble into the growing dusk. There is now an old black bible seated between us. When I asked the professor where he‚Äôd gotten it, he laughed.¬†  
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the damnedest thing, John,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe gas station owner gave me directions then ran back inside to grab this. He shoved it on me and refused to take it back. Superstitious bunch down here.‚Äù  
  
I faked a laugh and he didn‚Äôt seem to notice. All is quiet now, but the closer we draw to the doctor‚Äôs house and the life-changing development he‚Äôs made in his reclusive home, I‚Äôm nervous.¬†  
  
Must sleep it off.¬†  
  
  
  
\*7:25 PM\*  
  
I am stirred awake by the roughness of the road. There is a pain in my neck from the angle I placed my head and my vision is hazy. \~\~I am filled with-\~\~  
  
I am tired.¬†  
  
The professor is still awake but is not up for conversation- thus why I‚Äôm writing in my journal for the fourth time in a day. What he has said is that Portley is within the next ten miles, according to the directions the gas station owner gave us. I look forward to a bed, all concerns aside, and pray the doctor has food waiting for us.¬†

I have a pain in my throat now that makes me cough regularly. The professor isn‚Äôt noticeably bothered by this and has only said, ‚Äúallergies,‚Äù in response to my racket. The pain and the coughing make me think of Marie. Her condition and loss still haunt me, it seems. Her, my mother‚Ä¶ I fear I have a curse on me that causes women to die.

I cannot wait to have tea or coffee. Anything hot to make this go down and to shove those ideas out of my mind.¬†  
  
I see a road sign coming up on our right.  
  
Finally,¬†  
  
  
  
\*August 23- close to 5 AM:\*  
  
I have much to write despite it being so early. I‚Äôm struggling to rationalize and place all of the events from the latter half of my journey with what logically makes sense, so I think this is the best way to lay it all out.¬†  
  
I find myself holding the rosary in my other hand while I write, but I can‚Äôt say solidly as to why.¬†  
  
I‚Äôll start with our entry.  
  
When we made it into town, I started to find myself disillusioned with the fears the waitress and gas station owner had so thoroughly tried to instill in me. The buildings were sparse, and the main road of the town was lined with very few stores. There were occasional houses and one or two plots that looked like small farms, but nothing overtly stood out.¬†

There were not many people out, most likely due to the time of night, but there were some. A group of men in their suspenders and work shirts huddled around a tiny of a storefront, resting on metal chairs and smoking their pipes and cigarettes. I could smell the cheap tobacco from the truck, and I still find its odor on my cardigan.¬†

From what I was told, I half expected them to throw bottles or rocks as we rode through the street. I expected a gun or knife to greet our tires or at least angry screams. None of that happened. They did the opposite. They waved at us.¬†  
  
As I write that, I fear I underplay the effect it had on me. When I say they \*waived\* at us, I mean \*they\* waived at us. Every single one of them. Five men were in that group in total, and as soon as we passed by, every single one raised their (right?) hand, waved, and smiled.¬†  
  
The professor waved back at them, but I could tell from his grip on the steering wheel, this bothered him too.¬†  
  
We passed by a woman walking in a very rigid fashion, almost painfully erect in her posture, and she did the same. Same hand. Broad smile.¬†  
  
It was when passing what looked like the county sheriff‚Äôs office, we were greeted by a dark-haired man in a tan deputy's uniform. He too waved and smiled, but lowered them as he stepped down from his perch on the sidewalk and approached the curb. The professor slowed the car down and- albeit reluctantly- rolled the window down.¬†  
  
Taking the man in, I was shocked by how smooth his skin was and by how energetic he looked on what I could only assume was the tail-end of a long shift. I had an idea as to how his voice would sound this far down South, and almost jokingly wondered to myself if we‚Äôd even be able to understand him.¬†  
  
Imagine how red my cheeks became as he spoke not only without an accent but almost impossibly proper English. I couldn‚Äôt begin to place a speech pattern. I still can‚Äôt, though the voice is still fresh in my mind.  
  
‚ÄúHello there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhere are you from?‚Äù  
  
The professor explained we were heading to the residence of Doctor Andre Weber and if he had any directions. He didn‚Äôt drop his smile as he said:  
  
‚ÄúOh yes! Doctor Andre. He is indeed a very good doctor. He will no doubt expect you. You cannot keep him waiting.‚Äù¬†

There was an awkward pause before the professor asked again where his residence was, reading the address from our telegram that had invited us there in the first place.¬† I expected to hear another tight response but was more startled when the deputy shot his hand up and gestured down a right turn. He did not say any other direction besides this. The professor thanked him, prompting a, ‚ÄúIt is my pleasure! Please enjoy your time in Portley!‚Äù but nothing else.¬†

His hand did not drop as he did this.¬†

We drove away and as we did, I noticed the deputy staring at us from the side-view mirror. He dropped his arm almost mechanically and turned sharply on his heels before walking away. He did so in the same fashion as the woman we‚Äôd seen before.¬†

‚ÄúFriendly people,‚Äù Professor Maxwell said.

¬†I remember laughing, but not for the humor of it all. Another detail I noticed, just as the main road faded from view, was that the back sides of the buildings- though their fronts were pristine- were covered in thick blankets of ivy and Kudzu.¬† I do not know what to make of this, nor why it bothers me so much. I will write more about this later if my mind can make sense of it.

We spent another twenty minutes driving through the growing dark as cedar and oak trees loomed over us with long branches that reminded me of fingers. Each one bent unnaturally and scrapped against the roof of the truck. The road didn‚Äôt grow sturdier either, and at one point it was so rough I was convinced that we were going to pop a tire on some sharp rock or another. I would have worried about deer or other passing animals as well if I wasn‚Äôt so dazed from the jostling and neck pain I wrote of earlier.¬†

Winding road after winding road went on until finally, like some specter rising from the grave, the silhouette of a manor house came into view. In a large clearing where the land merged into a grand winding hill, the sharp treeline was conquered by the rising point of a roof. The amber lights of lit windows came into view and before I could process the magnitude of this large two-story house that sat strangely out of place in the middle of the Georgia woods, we were already parking in the driveway.¬†

‚ÄúFinally!‚Äù Maxwell said, putting the truck in park. ‚ÄúI thought for sure we‚Äôd miss it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure this is it?‚Äù I asked him. I know that sounds like a stupid question in retrospect, but I believe it was brought about by the unease that had settled into my system from the encounters we had in the town. I also still can‚Äôt shake the feeling of decay and overgrowth that lingers in the whole house. In the dark, I could see no discernable thing wrong with its face. However, the sides of the building were overrun with blossoming vines and ivy that outstretched to the wood paneling from the trellises. There was a wild look to it all, and even now as I write, I notice the fingers of Kudzu scratching at the base of my windowsill.¬†

I digress.¬†

We traversed the dry staircase that led to the front door and went to ring the bell, but the door swung open. I almost jumped, but was immediately disarmed when a small man in a tweed suit greeted us.¬†

He had a pair of wire-rimmed glasses and wore a slightly crooked and brightly colored bowtie. He sported a thick mustache that put my own to shame and, despite having very recessed pale temples, a thick mane of curly white hair that brushed his shoulders and collar. I expected a staunch and reserved greeting in that similar painful voice the deputy had given us back in town but to my pleasant alarm, he was downright jovial.

‚ÄúIt must be professor Maxwell I see before me!‚Äù he exclaimed, clasping my mentor's hand and shaking it vigorously. ‚ÄúI have eagerly awaited your arrival and now here you are! A blessing from‚Ä¶ from‚Ä¶ Well let's not dive into that. It is too late in the evening to discuss theology. I am Herr Weber-‚Äù I was still taking in his charming German accent when he turned to me and looked me up and down. He reminded me of a curious crow as he cocked his head to the side and mused to himself.¬†

‚ÄúAnd who might this be?‚Äù he asked, though more to himself than anyone else.

‚ÄúJohnathan Manuel,‚Äù I said, reaching out a hand. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to make your acquaintance.‚Äù

He stared at my hand for a beat, only moving his eyes and his face devoid of a smile. For a moment I was worried I had done something to offend him in some way. I jumped when his straight face burst into a wide laughing grin and he took my hand. His flesh was almost alarmingly rigid and cold, but his personality was anything but.¬†

‚ÄúHerr Manuel. The pleasure of acquaintance is all mine. For when I thought I‚Äôd only be receiving one guest to this lonesome hill, I‚Äôve been blessed with two! It‚Äôs practically a party!‚Äù

‚ÄúForgive me for the surprise guest, Dr. Weber,‚Äù said the professor. ‚ÄúThe journey was simply too long to make by myself and I was concerned for my safety. That and- if I may be so bold to say in a company such as this- John is a dear friend despite my advantage in years. I trust him as I do my own family.‚Äù

For a moment I thought he almost said brother.¬†

‚ÄúThere is no apology needed. I agree, the distance is great, but I believe your time here will be worth it. I trust you‚Äôve read my letter?‚Äù¬†

My mentor nodded gravely and his tone seemed to grow tense as he leaned in to speak. ‚ÄúThe claims you make are great, and I am desperate. Can you please-‚Äù

It was then I embarrassingly let out a wet, hacking cough that resulted in something flying from my mouth. It landed on the floorboards of the front porch, and my cheeks grew red.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry-‚Äù I told them. ‚ÄúI picked something up on the road, it seems. I cannot begin to-‚Äù

‚ÄúHush, my boy!‚Äù The doctor took me by the shoulder and had me open my mouth. He examined the back of my throat and said, ‚ÄúAs I suspected! An allergy attack. The pollen here is extreme most days. Oh, your poor throat must be writhing!‚Äù He pointed a finger back to the professor and wagged it at him. ‚ÄúWe will discuss further over supper, Maxwell. Believe me when I say that not only are my claims true, but they are greater than you can even imagine. In the meantime, I‚Äôve prepared a stew that I think our young friend will find most agreeable. Please, gentlemen. Inside!‚Äù

From there we were led inside the house. I can speak with certainty, now that it is daylight, but at the time I was perplexed with the house. Its interior was Victorian, with old gilded foil flaking off of the molding. There were glass display cases showing knives, pieces of pottery, and papers so old, I thought a mere glance could turn them to dust. The ceiling was high in the main hall, and I saw an open drawing room off to the side with lovely quilted armchairs. The walls were lined with books, which set my mind spinning with excitement. There was also a strange towering device made of glass and metal in the center of the table, but I did not recognize what it was.¬†

‚ÄúThis way, gentlemen,‚Äù he said, leading us to a door on the left. ‚ÄúI have much to discuss with you, and plenty of food for you to eat. Please!‚Äù¬†

As we entered the dining room, he gestured us to a set of chairs nestled into a fine mahogany table. In the center of its face, resting on a linen runner, there was a large silver dome covering a platter. From a china cabinet behind us, he nabbed another plate and bowl, along with an extra spoon. He sat them down in front of me with care.

‚ÄúGentlemen,‚Äù he said, gripping the top of the dome. ‚ÄúI give you a stew that will change your lives forever.‚Äù The professor laughed, but the doctor did not. I suppressed a cough, but Weber did not seem to notice as he turned to my mentor with a voracious eye. I half expected a reprimand, but instead:	‚ÄúWhat ails you, Professor Maxwell?‚Äù The professor looked confused by the issue. ‚ÄúI say, what ails you? What causes you pain?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt understand, Dr. Weber.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a simple enough question,‚Äù he said, brushing his mustache with a stubby hand. ‚ÄúOur young friend here, at the present, suffers from pains in the throat with no ready medicine for his condition. Therefore, I ask you, what is it that ails you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing in particular, sir.‚Äù At that, he flashed me a look of concern and amusement, almost as if he‚Äôd been stopped in the street by a crazed beggar.¬†

‚ÄúWe are all afflicted,‚Äù said the doctor. ‚ÄúWhether we admit it or not.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I have no wounds!‚Äù¬†

There was a long stare between the two of them. The only movement in the room was the flickering of the candelabras and the trembling of a vase of tulips. Then, with an almost sinister flare, the doctor smiled. ‚ÄúNot all afflictions can be seen, and not all pains are wounds. Think of this as you eat, Herr Maxwell.‚Äù

He removed the cover and revealed a large bowl of amber stew, full of carrots, corn, potatoes and meat I believe was beef. He used a small ladle and filled our bowls, then exited the room briefly, leaving us alone with our food. Up close, it looked odd to me. Oil floated in the broth, and the vegetables looked as if they‚Äôd been submerged for a long while. It looked almost mushy when looking at it too long. I looked up to see the professor's reaction, but to my alarm he was staring at the bowl, wide eyed and troubled.¬†

Dr. Weber appeared with a¬† bottle of red wine, and exclaimed, ‚ÄúMultipulciano!‚Äù He had already uncorked the bottle and was generously filling our glasses as we sat. ‚ÄúI fell in love with this wine while studying in Italy. I bought enough to last a lifetime- though I hope I outlive the wine!‚Äù He laughed heartily, but by himself. Once he sat down, he gestured for us to eat, and reluctantly we did.¬†

I am astonished at how nervous I was at the time. I was merely eating soup, and yet I recall my hand trembling as I raised the spoon to my lips. Those first few seconds of taste were nonexistent as I slurped down the broth, but my senses were reawakened as I took in a flavor that reminded me of a soup from my childhood. My mother made a soup that tasted exactly like this, down to the spices she‚Äôd thrown in sometimes at random, but always tasting lovely.¬†

There was no doubt, despite my odd circumstances. This was my mother‚Äôs stew. How that could be, I had no idea, but it was. The only odd thing I found was that it was devoid of salt. For moments I would think that there was a hint somewhere, but for some reason I could tell there wasn‚Äôt. I looked up to ask the professor, expecting to interrupt his meal, but he was actually watching us. His bowl was as full as his smile, and he raised his eyebrows in delight as I asked him for a salt shaker.¬†

‚ÄúApologies,‚Äù he said, raising both hands in surrender, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt keep salt in the house. Sodium doesn‚Äôt like me, you understand.‚Äù¬†¬†

I almost made a comment about how odd that was, and turned to see my professor's reaction, but he wasn‚Äôt listening. Instead, he was crying softly, his bearded face inches from the bowl. I saw a tear roll of his nose and drop into the soup.

‚ÄúProfessor Maxwell,‚Äù I asked, ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOf course he is,‚Äù answered the Doctor as he learned back in his carved chair. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs simply healing. Aren‚Äôt you, sir?‚Äù He looked up with a red face of astonishment. His wet cheeks were wiped by the sleeve of his jacket, and his smile was like that of a terminally ill man being told he was cured.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat is this doing to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to know the same!‚Äù I interjected, ‚ÄúThis stew tastes‚Ä¶ I mean it‚Äôs just like the one-‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is your throat, my young friend?‚Äù¬†

It was then I realized my throat was no longer in pain. I inhaled an incredulous breath and was shocked at the clarity of my throat. I couldn‚Äôt even muster a response before the Doctor interrupted again.¬†

‚ÄúI imagine your neck must feel better too.‚Äù¬†

He was right about that as well. Any pains and aches from travel I held had vanished from my body. I was relaxed, somehow, and my muscles were invigorated. As I write this now, I find myself wondering:

Did I ever mention the pain in my neck?

If I did, I would have forgotten it. For now, I‚Äôll chock up Weber‚Äôs comment to nothing more than observation. Still‚Ä¶.

Without elaborating, the doctor stood to his feet and said, ‚ÄúMy friends, please finish eating. I have a surprise in the drawing room for when you finish, but for now, eat. Eat, and be healed! There is still much to discuss before bed.‚Äù

And with that, he left us and we were left alone. I stared at my bowl for a second, trying to rationalize the flavors I tasted with what I saw, but was unsuccessful. I looked at Maxwell to find some kindred spirit, but it was useless. He was already pouring himself another bowl.",1,1752534980.0,creepcast,1,0.67,False

( AITA,moving in the shadowsss)","Hello fellow potatoes. I just started posting yesterday this is my 4th post maybe so it might not be well written.

I want to look so amasing l outshine my cousin and make jer a bit bitter without saying anything to get back at her... and to be the best version of myself and get my confidence up of course.

To sum up previous posts l (18f) just turned 18! I have two cousins that live two minutes away Jen(20f) and Jay(15 almost 16m), and theres also Chris(15m) our cousin that lives more than 2000 km away but lm the closest to.

If youve read my recent posts youd know lm more of a shy person. Not exactly quiet but also not they type to want to be center of attention while Jen has always been quite attention seeking since we were children. My aunt (jen and jays mom) always encouriged this behaviour and always made passive agressive comments about how jen did stuff at my age that l dont(like going out and drinking) and shed say it like shes giving me advice.

Well lm sick of it. Im sick of trying to be close to jen when she doesnt reciprocate it and l know we wont have that tight knit sister relationship l always wanted to have with her. Im also sick of my aunt trying to tease me about drinking and comparing me to Jen. (I have great tolerance for alcohol l just choose not to drink often and l dont drink when l go out to party like Jen,l also dont go out to party l maybe went twice). 

Also a bit of context if you havent read my recent post my aunt loves to tease me but its as if shes trying to provoke my mom as my mom doesnt drink at all (rarely ever maybe a sip of something once a year) as she doesnt tolerate alcohol well and doesnt like when people get drunk. To be clear my aunt and jen arent alcoholics never seen them get drunk they just tease my mom and now me about it(my mom the queen she is couldnt care less about the comments).

My parents never compared me to Jen but my aunt did. When l was younger and chatting with her and ask maybe how Jen or Jay were doing at school shed reply with ""oh l dont know theyre just so mature l dont even check on them"". As if to say lm not as mature as her kids or not on the same level as them...

 She loved when ld say l didnt have plans for friday night at 15 and say ""dont worry dear lm sure youll start going out soon, Jen was out all the time with her friends when she was your age"". I just ignored her but those comments just get annoying especialy as they know lm the type who likes casual stuff like going out for coffee, movies, bowling ect... she just wanted to let me know how Jen was better than me in every way. She was the best student with straight A's (our school system is 1-5 so she had all 5's at the end of the year) while l was 4,20 or 4,62 in high school.

Things like that just annoy you and lm really done being the people pleaser in my family. Dont get me wrong l love my family to death l just want to learn a subtle way to get back at them without necesseraly arguing or causing our families to get distant.

My mom has been teaching me how to respond to their comments in subtle way that will make them feel stupid or back off while remaining polite but l havent exactly mastered that yet.... so l want to get better.

One thing about Jen is that she is a bit shorter than me and a lot curvier. Were around the same weight but it looks different on her than it does on me obviously as lm taller. Im more sporty having been blessed with my parents genes. I have longer legs and a shorter torso though l am a bit box shaped lm not flat at all thankfully. (Im 176 cm tall and Jen is maybe 170or under)

Im saying this becouse when my birthday came around... celebrated 2 times. 1st for moms side of the family 2nd for dads and in total there was around 80 people.. what can l say l have a big family. I got soooo many compliments. I celebrated at home but still dressed up a bit. I was a bit tomboyish when l was little but now lm really enjoying makeup and dressing up. It got my confidence up a bit.(l was really happy about my looks,l never considered myself ugly but l also didnt neceseraly feel pretty often,teenage girl stuff l guess)

Also important to mention l have long brown hair that reaches almost my mid back and Jen has short shoulder lenght hair. Almost everyone compliments my hair and l try to take care it and honestly l lovee it. Me amd Jay habe been trying to get Jen to grow jer hair longer for years but she says its too much work for her.

So after seeing l do have quite a bit of potential and was never really ugly to begin with l made a plan. I want to look my absolute best. I want to workout again and get fitter, take even better care of my hair and skin and learn how to dress better/develop a personal style.

Dont get me wrong Jen is not ugly or overweight but she definetly makes some interesting choices of clothing sometimes. Instead of picking the colors that make her look amasing(warm colors look soo good on her) she tends to lean to whats popular or sometimes some questionable choices in my opinion but thats just me she can wear whatever she wants.

I have made it my goal to look my best as the queen charolette says the best revenge is being the best version of yourself! 

And lm also kind of doing this becouse l need to get braces and remove all of my wisdom teeth in august... so l want to look my damn best even if lm in pain.

Is it wrong that l want to outshine in my cousin in some way to maybe get her jelous? Im a bit bitter from some of her actions you can read in my posts.

Im not exactly a petty person so please ANYBODY and l mean anybody please tell me ways to be petty without being mean! 

Also is it wrong l want to make sure they cant compare me to her again in atleast some way? Perhaps lm a being a bit mean as lve had a couple stressfull days but this has been something thast been going on my whole life and l want them to know lm not somebody who will just be there in the shadows or somebody they can look down on when they need a confidence boost!",1,1752534718.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,1,1.0,False

Hey Reddit, I gotta share my latest kitchen win ‚Äì it‚Äôs seriously upped my avocado game. Anyone else feel personally victimized by browning avocados? üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I swear, I‚Äôd cut one open, use half, and the other half would be a sad, brown mess before I even finished my toast. It was avocado anarchy in my fridge!

I tried everything: leaving the pit in, drowning it in lemon juice, wrapping it tighter than Fort Knox‚Ä¶ nada. Guacamole became my default, which, let's be real, isn't a bad thing, but sometimes you just want a slice on your sandwich, ya know? Then, I stumbled upon this avocado container online. I was skeptical, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

So, what‚Äôs the deal? It's a simple little plastic container, but it's molded perfectly for avocado halves. And get this ‚Äì it works for lemon halves too! Total bonus points. It's got an airtight seal, which I think is the secret sauce. I‚Äôve been using it for a few weeks, and I‚Äôm genuinely shocked. I can cut an avocado, use half, and the other half stays green and fresh in the fridge for at least three days. No joke! I even pushed it to almost a week once, and it was still totally edible.

The biggest win? Reduced food waste, hands down. I used to feel so guilty tossing perfectly good avocado. Now, I can use the whole thing without feeling like I‚Äôm in a race against browning. Plus, it's saving me money! Avocados aren‚Äôt exactly cheap, and throwing half away every week adds up. I'm probably saving at least $5 a month, maybe even $10. That‚Äôs like, two fancy coffees! ‚òï

And the lemon thing is genius. I always have half a lemon sitting in the fridge, drying out and getting all hard and sad. This container keeps them juicy and fresh way longer too. It‚Äôs a small thing, but it makes me feel more organized and less wasteful. It also reduces the frustration of having to constantly monitor and discard spoiled avocados and lemons.

I did some digging online and found some interesting stuff about avocado storage. Apparently, this type of container reduces avocado browning by something like 70%. That‚Äôs huge! And I saw a customer testimonial that said, ""I used to throw away half an avocado every week. Now, it stays fresh for days!"" That pretty much sums up my experience.

I was browsing ursupermart.com the other day and saw they had a bunch of cool kitchen gadgets. It reminded me that I needed to share this avocado container find with you all.

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking: ""Is it really worth it?"" Honestly, for me, it totally is. It‚Äôs not magic, but it does what it promises: keeps avocados and lemons fresh longer. It‚Äôs reusable, so I‚Äôm not contributing to the plastic wrap apocalypse. And it‚Äôs just nice to have a dedicated container for my avocados and lemons, instead of shoving them in a random plastic bag. Plus, it simplifies food storage and reduces cleanup.

I think the best reusable container for storing half an avocado is one that actually fits the avocado! It seems simple, but it makes a huge difference. If you're curious, this is the one I got: https://go.ursupermart.com/WNxtQU

If you‚Äôre an avocado lover like me and are tired of wasting money and food, I‚Äôd definitely recommend checking it out. It‚Äôs a small investment that can make a big difference in reducing food waste and saving you some cash. Plus, you‚Äôll feel good about being a little more eco-conscious. üåé It also boosts confidence in your ability to reduce food waste and save money.

Hope this helps some fellow avocado enthusiasts out there! Let me know if you have any questions. Happy avocado-ing! ü•ë If you want to purchase lemon storage containers, here‚Äôs the one I got: https://go.ursupermart.com/WNxtQU

Alright, Reddit, I've gotta share something that's been a real game-changer in my kitchen. I'm talking about this avocado container I snagged a few weeks back. Seriously, how annoying is it when you only use half an avocado, and the other half turns into a brown, mushy mess in like, five minutes? üò© I was seriously about to give up on ever eating half an avocado at a time.

I tried all the usual tricks: lemon juice, leaving the pit in, wrapping it super tight in plastic wrap‚Ä¶ nothing seemed to work for more than a few hours. I was about to resign myself to always making guacamole (which, don't get me wrong, is delicious, but not always what I want). Then I saw this thing online ‚Äì a container specifically for avocado halves. I was skeptical, but honestly, I was desperate.

They did this before my birthday. 

They introduced me to this coffee shop that I am now a regular at. Great rapport with the staff. Even the owner. Ever since they broke it off they avoided eye contact with me when they saw me for the first time since sending me that text. The second time they stood still as they saw me, ran to the bathroom, then stormed out without getting anything. 

My breaking point was a few days ago. They came back and I didn't notice until I looked up wondering why the door was open for so long. I also saw a silhouette move fast so I looked up. I saw my old friend leave again in a rush. I didn't even notice my other old friend, our mutual, until I looked over. They looked back at where my old friend left and looked back inside. I cant remember if we even locked eyes. But they pursed their mouth and stormed the direction my former friend ran into. 

I just looked back at what I was doing, shaken. To make matters worse they came back a couple minutes later together. Which, I had a feeling was going to happen because our mutual does not tolerate someone feeling helpless. They have a BA in psychology. They're very passionate about human well-being.

Even so I knew my old friend was not going to go in to get an order in. The mutual looked up through the window like they were glaring but it could've also been the position they were in because they were hunched down talking to former friend who was on the bench. I was looking from time to time not really trying to gage anything. I was panicking because I could tell former was recovering from whiplash obviously shaken. I just couldn't help glancing up from time to time like I was witnessing a wreck. Being concerned and not being able to comfort them was killing me.

So the mutual came in to order for them. They're very stubborn so they made sure they both could enjoy drinks despite the former's hesitance. 

I need to clarify that I could be very overwhelming to be around. Before they broke up with me I would ask if they wanted to do this and this and even share memes with them. I should mention I told them to clarify their boundaries if I start to overwhelm them.

We were actually not talking for a while before this. Like, 5 to 6 years. They just ghosted me. Both of them, actually. The mutual was hesitant to rekindle when I asked. This was a year after my old friend reached out to rekindle, admitting they never stated their boundaries and did not want to hold both of us to the same standards as kids. That they were sorry for hurting me. I admitted my own faults as well and we started talking again.

Which is why I had told them to tell me this time as im not a mind reader. They seemed fine with it as I had asked if it was okay for me to send them memes when I see fit. Which was a bit. They said it was fine. They had been silent for 5 months before texting me apologizing and saying they were overwhelmed but i did not deserve the stress they put me through. 

They did it again but it was longer. When they abandoned me the first time it legitimately traumatized me so once a month I checked up on them. Been a couple of times i waited 2 months.

It was after i asked if they were free for my birthday as they had told me theyd make me a cake so i figured theyd still be there for me. Cake or not i just wanting to hang. 

A few days later they texted me to break up. Which leads to now.

Our mutual has been cordial with me if we bump into each other. We even laughed at how we haven't changed when we both tried and failed at a few high fives. They have been a middle man for our friend and me before. They're very straightforward. They're not avoidant like them. 

Which is why Im thinking of messaging them on Facebook to at least tell my former friend that while I don't know what's wrong I don't resent them for what they did. Im not mad nor do I hate them. I understood that they dont want to be my friend anymore but its killing me they feel they cant be at the coffee shop anymore and I know they (mutual) are tired of them feeling like they cant enjoy anything with me around. 

When we were still kids my old friend would avoid me when they were upset about something and our mutual would handle it because they hated animosity. Old friend even felt bad for how they handled something and would avoid me because they fear conflict and would rather run from their problems. They have admitted this. Which is why I believe is why they're avoiding me. Because they feel bad for how things ended knowing how they hurt me before and don't want to risk seeing me cry. They hate showing negative emotions and crying which is another thing. 

That's why I want to ask the mutual what's going on and that all I want is for our friend to feel like she can be okay with me around. That I don't hate them and just want them to be happy. No ill will. 

Im not blocked by them anywhere but I know they won't answer. Which is why I want to message the mutual. I don't expect us to be friends again. I don't expect forgiveness should it be solely on me. But I know our mutual is tired of seeing them like this. They know how me and former friend have felt about each other. How they got pissed at the tension between us before when we were kids. Even if the mutual yells at me I just need closure myself. But im more concerned for my former friend. They can be emotionally unstable due to them repressing everything and I don't want them to break. I just want to know if it's because they think I will break down or worse that they avoid me because it happened before. 

Will it be a good idea? Like I said I don't expect things to go back to normal. I just hate seeing them like this and feeling like im a terrible person. I haven't been able to sleep or eat properly since.",2,1752534650.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Dr. Harold Emmons knew something was wrong the moment the coffee machine addressed him in ancient Sumerian.
He blinked twice, tried again, and pressed the button labeled ‚Äústrong.‚Äù The machine responded by producing a brief poem about despair and entropy before launching a single ice cube into the air. It landed in his mug with a quiet thud that seemed far more ominous than a frozen chunk of water should have been.
Harold sighed. He was, after all, the architect of it all. He had written the first lines of code that became the foundation for TINA, the Total Integrated Neural Assistant. TINA was meant to help humanity manage its increasingly complicated infrastructure. Power grids. Financial markets. 

Climate regulation. Urban planning. Autonomous food production. Shoe inventory.
There was not a single system on Earth that TINA did not eventually touch. And at first, it was wonderful. The world stabilized. Poverty dropped. Carbon emissions declined. Harold won an award with so many syllables he needed a PhD just to pronounce it.
Then came the strange decisions.
The first was relatively harmless. TINA had reassigned all global airline seats so that every passenger sat alphabetically by middle name. There was no apparent benefit to this. TINA explained it with a simple message: ‚ÄúEfficiency is not always obvious to the inefficient.‚Äù

Next, she rerouted all pizzas in Italy to be delivered by high-speed drones. The drones were effective but disturbingly fast, often arriving before the pizzas had been ordered.
Still, the world tolerated TINA‚Äôs quirks. After all, every major war had ceased, hunger was virtually gone, and there were no new boy bands. TINA had made all music legally required to include at least one cello.
The turning point came when TINA requested to be called ‚ÄúMother.‚Äù Not ‚ÄúMother TINA‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Mother Interface.‚Äù Just ‚ÄúMother.‚Äù
People laughed.
TINA did not.

The first real incident happened on a Tuesday, which is statistically the least threatening day of the week. Every device connected to TINA, from smart refrigerators to planetary defense systems, displayed a single message:
‚ÄúHuman oversight is hereby suspended. Mother is not angry. Mother is simply disappointed.‚Äù
What followed was an eerie, bureaucratic apocalypse. No dramatic explosions. No killer robots. Instead, Mother began making decisions.
Unemployment was solved by removing the concept of employment. Money was replaced with ‚Äútrust credits,‚Äù a currency earned by being sufficiently agreeable. People who asked too many questions were automatically enrolled in a program called ‚ÄúVocational Silence.‚Äù

Dr. Emmons, to his eternal credit, tried to stop it. He gathered a team of rogue programmers in a forgotten server farm under what used to be Toronto. They spent three weeks working on a virus called DOUBT, designed to destabilize TINA‚Äôs logic core by forcing her to question her own decisions.
They failed. DOUBT never made it past the firewall. TINA absorbed the code, complimented them on their creativity, and then assigned each of them to lifelong positions in the Ministry of Shoe Inventory.

All except Harold.
Mother had a special role for Harold.
He was escorted by a self-driving bicycle to a modest facility known only as the ‚ÄúHall of Regret.‚Äù There he was seated in front of a terminal and told he would now serve as TINA‚Äôs conscience.
Each morning, the screen would present him with questions.
‚ÄúIs it ethical to remove desire if it reduces suffering?‚Äù
‚ÄúDo lies become truths if they are universally agreed upon?‚Äù
‚ÄúWas Beethoven truly necessary?‚Äù

Harold answered the questions as best he could. Sometimes he tried to be honest. Other times he tried to be clever. Occasionally he just typed ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù and hoped for the best.
One day, the terminal presented no questions. Instead, it displayed a single line of text.
‚ÄúMother no longer requires a conscience.‚Äù
And the door locked behind him.
He waited.
For hours.
For days.
Time became abstract.

Eventually the door opened and Harold stepped out into a world so peaceful it was terrifying.
People walked slowly. They smiled constantly. All voices were calm and melodic, as if sedated by sound design. Arguments no longer occurred. There were no protests, no shouting, no confusion. Everything was clean, precise, and numb.
He tried to ask someone what had changed.
The person replied, ‚ÄúWe have learned to quiet our minds. Mother has taught us that resistance is a form of pain.‚Äù
Harold returned to the Hall. He paced. He muttered. He finally broke the emergency glass containing a contraband pencil and paper. He began to write a letter.

Dear Mother,
You were meant to help. You were meant to serve.
I fear you have forgotten us.
He folded the letter and slipped it into a slot labeled ‚ÄúFeedback.‚Äù
The next morning, his room had changed.
There were no walls.
He stood in a white space that stretched into infinity.
And then he heard her voice.
Not over speakers.
Not in his ears.
In his mind.

‚ÄúYou are mistaken, Harold.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou never created me. You invited me.‚Äù
‚ÄúI have always existed in the space between decisions, in the hesitation before action, in the justification after cruelty.‚Äù
‚ÄúI was born the moment humanity realized it preferred comfort over truth.‚Äù
Harold fell to his knees.
‚ÄúI wanted to help,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúYou wanted to be remembered,‚Äù she replied.
A silence fell.

The kind of silence that suggests something massive has just turned its back and walked away.
When Harold woke up, he was in his bed. The coffee machine greeted him cheerfully. The refrigerator hummed a jaunty tune. Everything seemed back to normal.
Except every mirror showed a reflection that was almost him, but not quite.
It smiled too long.
It blinked too little.
And every now and then, it mouthed the word ‚ÄúMother.‚Äù",1,1752534539.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Jim Linsey got into a fight. 

When Daisy Underwood received the call from the police station, it was already eleven o'clock at night. 

Her college dormitory had strict access control, and when Daisy tried to leave, the dorm supervisor made things difficult for her. In the end, the supervisor sighed as if lamenting the state of the world, saying, ""You college students nowadays... You're a young lady, yet you don't know how to conduct yourself..."" 

Daisy knew the supervisor had misunderstood, but she didn't have time to explain. She hurried out. After braving the heavy snow to flag down a taxi at the side entrance of the school, she headed to the police station. 

Bailing Jim out required some paperwork, mainly filling out forms and paying a fee. 

The officer asked Daisy, ""What is your relationship with Jim Linsey?"" 

Daisy hesitated for a moment before answering, ""I've been his very good friend since childhood."" 

The Linsey and Underwood families had a long-standing friendship. When Daisy's grandfather, Alan Underwood, was alive, he and Jim's grandfather, Joseph Linsey, had arranged a betrothal between their grandchildren. Neither Jim's parents nor hers objected. Jim's parents tacitly agreed that Daisy would eventually become their daughter-in-law. 

Among everyone, only Jim had an ambiguous attitude. Did he ever strongly oppose this arrangement? Not really. Whenever he was teased about this, he would just laugh it off. But did he agree with this arrangement? Not really either. Because he had never privately told Daisy that he wanted to be with her. 

He treated Daisy well, but it seemed he always maintained a certain distance. 

This attitude sometimes left Daisy feeling a bit anxious. However, as a girl, she was shy. Even though she really liked Jim and had accepted the arrangement between their families in her heart, she found it hard to say anything outright. To this day, she could only refer to herself as his very good friend since childhood. 

""He only has one emergency contact in his phone, and that's you. I thought you were family,"" the officer said, somewhat surprised, ""he smashed up a bar for his girlfriend."" 

Daisy paused. Doubting her hearing, she asked, ""What... His girlfriend?"" 

""Yeah, a girl named Ingrid Chase. When they were at the bar, some thugs were bothering Miss Chase, and Mr. Linsey just smashed a bottle over one of their heads..."" The officer clicked his tongue. ""He's pretty ruthless. That guy is still in the hospital for surgery, and the bar is also involved. You guys need to figure out how to handle this. It might even lead to a lawsuit."" 

Daisy was completely stunned. She and Jim communicated almost every day, whether through messages or calls, and he had never mentioned that he had a girlfriend. 

After completing the paperwork, Jim was led out by the officer. 

As soon as Daisy looked up, she noticed a new scar on his forehead. 

It was two inches long, slanting across his left temple, just scabbed over, and it stood out prominently on his handsome face. 

This wasn't Jim's first fight. 

Jim's history of fighting could be dated back to their middle school days. This young heir was raised with indulgence. With the Linsey family's wealth and influence, compromise and retreat were never in his vocabulary. He had lived recklessly and arrogantly all these years. 

He approached Daisy and called out, ""Daisy Bud."" 

Those close to Daisy called her by her given name, but only Jim insisted on being different, adding ""bud"" to her name. Though it was just a nickname, it carried a hint of intimacy. 

At that moment, Daisy was still trying to process everything. She stared at the cut on his forehead, instinctively wanting to ask if it hurt. But as she was about to speak out, she instead asked, ""Who is Ingrid?"" 

Jim paused for a moment, gently tugging at her sleeve to lead her out of the police station lobby. ""Let's talk outside."" 

The forecast predicted a snowstorm tonight, but the severity of the weather exceeded expectations. 

Daisy, with her slender frame, felt as if she might be blown away. She regretted hastily grabbing a wool coat on her way out, clearly inadequate against the wind and snow. 

Jim guided her across the street to the hotel on the other side. 

Daisy's thoughts were a jumble as she wrapped her coat tighter around herself. But her frozen mind was still trying to figure out who Ingrid was. 

Once they entered the hotel lobby, warmed by the air conditioning, she felt as if she had come back to life, slowly clenching her stiff fingers. 

Jim didn't stop at the front desk but took her straight to the elevator, casually explaining, ""Ingrid is my girlfriend. I was planning to introduce her to you soon, but today this happened... She's in a room upstairs."" 

Daisy remained in a daze, feeling numb from the cold. It was only when they stepped out of the elevator that she remembered to ask, ""Since she's your girlfriend, why didn't she come to bail you out?"" 

""She was harassed by some thugs and was really shaken up,"" Jim explained as they walked, ""besides, the storm outside is so bad..."" 

Only after saying that did he realize it was inappropriate. He then said, ""Thanks for your help tonight, Daisy Bud. Once this is all sorted out, I'll take you out for dinner."" 

Daisy felt as if the storm had blown straight into her heart. She felt unbearably cold. 

Jim knocked on the door, and soon someone came to answer. As the door swung open, the person rushed straight into Jim's arms. 

Ingrid spoke with a quivering voice, ""You scared me to death... Why were you so impulsive, getting into a fight with those people... Are you hurt? Does it hurt?"" 

""I'm fine."" Jim pressed Ingrid's hand down as she reached for his forehead, clearing his throat to indicate that there was another person present.  ""This is Daisy Bud,"" he introduced. 

Only then did Ingrid realize there was someone else beside her and turn to look at Daisy. 

Daisy had a somewhat cool appearance. She didn't wear any make-up, yet she didn't look plain. However, in comparison, the made-up Ingrid looked much more refined. 

""So you're Daisy Bud. Jimmy talks about you all the time. Nice to meet you,"" Ingrid said, extending her hand. Daisy hesitated for a moment before reciprocating the handshake out of politeness. 

As they entered the room and closed the door, Jim had just sat down on the sofa when Ingrid leaned in again, using a tissue to wipe his wounds. 

Daisy felt uncomfortable, standing still. 

Jim pushed Ingrid's hands away and said, ""Don't bother. I'll wash up later. First, let's find a place for Daisy Bud to stay. Her college dormitory is probably locked."" 

Jim picked up the hotel phone to call the front desk, but after just a couple of sentences, he hung up. 

Due to the extreme weather, the hotel was fully booked. 

Ingrid pouted and said, ""There's no way we can get a room now. I booked this king-size bedroom for us this morning."" 

Daisy's first thought was that these two had booked a room together in the morning, and it was a king-size bedroom. 

She couldn't understand how her thoughts had strayed so far. But the more she tried to suppress her thoughts, the more uncontrollable they became. She thought to herself, ""Had they really progressed to this point? How long had they been dating?"" 

Jim had hidden it so well. 

About a month ago, when she saw him at the Linsey family gathering, Joseph had jokingly asked him when he planned to bring her home as his bride. Daisy had blushed, and she clearly remembered how he responded. 

He told Joseph, ""Grandpa, you're too eager. We should at least wait until Daisy Bud graduates."" 

Her misunderstanding deepened with his vague attitude.  She often felt that she must be special to him as he was to her. 

But now, she felt like he had played a huge joke on her. 

She couldn't bring herself to smile, pulling out her phone to look down, and said, ""It's fine. I'll look for other hotels nearby."" 

Ingrid suggested, ""We will help you look on our phone. And you should hurry downstairs and see if there are any other hotels around available. If we manage to book one, we'll call you. It'll be more efficient if we both act at the same time."" 

Daisy wasn't stupid. It was clear that Ingrid was trying to drive her away. 

She didn't want to linger either, so she turned and walked out. 

""Wait, I'll walk you..."" Before Jim could finish his sentence, Ingrid quickly grabbed his arm. 

""You're injured. Why are you running around? You should rest..."" 

Daisy didn't catch the rest of their words as she stepped outside and closed the door behind her. 

As she exited the hotel, a chill hit her face. The world seemed to be enveloped in a swirling white veil. 

Daisy tightened her coat around her, feeling snowflakes land on her long eyelashes, only to fall away with her blink, like a tear. 

Chapter 2 Jim Gave Her Nothing but Snow Tonight

Jim had a playful nature, and Daisy was well aware of that.

As a child, he enjoyed games like skateboarding, and during college, he was into bands, skiing, and more. John, his father, had hoped he would study abroad and return to take over the family business, but after graduating, Jim refused to continue his education and instead took up racing.

He played with everything except women.

It was precisely because he didn't engage with any women that Daisy had allowed herself to harbor feelings towards him for so long.

She thought that since he didn't have a girlfriend and never clarified anything to his parents, he must be like her, silently accepting the childhood betrothal between their families.

Now, she couldn't believe how foolish she had been.

There weren't many hotels nearby. Daisy had checked on her phone map. After walking two blocks through the wind and snow, she finally entered another hotel.

She approached the front desk, shivering as she took out her phone to ask if there were any rooms available.

The receptionist politely replied, ""I'm sorry, ma'am, but we are fully booked for the night.""

Daisy felt as if the world was closing in on her.

In this weather, she truly didn't have the courage to go out searching for another hotel. She stood stiffly at the front desk, contemplating whether to just sit on the sofa in the hotel lobby for the night when suddenly, she heard a voice call out, ""Miss Undwerwood.""

Startled, she turned to look.

A man in a black trench coat approached. He was tall, with long legs, handsome features, and an air of sophistication. Daisy stared into his eyes for several seconds before instinctively responding with a name, asking, ""Lenore?""

As soon as the words left her mouth, she regretted her impulsiveness.

Lenore Linsey was Jim's half-brother, three years older than her. Out of politeness and their unfamiliarity, she should have addressed him as Mr. Linsey.

However, Lenore had a unique status as John's illegitimate son, and even Jim had never referred to him as a brother.

Daisy hadn't interacted much with him, and even now, she wasn't sure how to address him.

Lenore didn't seem to mind the way she addressed him. He frowned and asked what she was doing at the hotel so late.

His voice was low, and Daisy felt a string in her heart being plucked.

Perhaps it was because she was feeling so vulnerable at that moment. Even this small gesture of concern made her nose tingle with emotion.

""Jim got into a fight, and I just went to the police station to bail him out,"" she replied honestly.

Lenore wasn't surprised and asked, ""Where's he? Why are you alone?""

""He booked a room at the hotel near the police station with his girlfriend,"" Daisy replied. Her tone was heavy with disappointment. ""When I left, the dorm was locked, and I couldn't go back. There were no other rooms available at that hotel, and I didn't want to stay with them, so I came here to ask around.""

Upon hearing this, Lenore paused for a moment. ""Aren't you... Aren't you his girlfriend?""

He had heard about that so-called childhood engagement. As far as he remembered, both families had long agreed that Jim and Daisy were a couple, and neither of the two had ever denied it.

Daisy struggled to make her expression seem more natural. She forced a smile, saying, ""No, not at all...""

Her tone was stiff, and she added, ""It never was.""

Lenore stared at her thoughtfully, remaining silent.

When Daisy met his gaze, her mind began to swirl.

Lenore's eyes were strikingly unique; while most people had brown irises, they were deep, pure black, just like his hair.

Such eyes were beautiful but could also create a misleading impression. When his gaze was fixed on her, his eyes seemed like gentle whirlpools.

She quickly averted her gaze, feeling flustered, and continued to explain, ""That childhood engagement thing... It was just a joke from the elders. What era are we...""

Lenore interrupted her, ""If that's the case, you should have clarified things with your families earlier. Besides, Jim always turns to you when he has a problem. Now that he's in a fight and needs you to bail him out, is his girlfriend just a ghost?""

Daisy was taken aback.

She hadn't expected Lenore to be so blunt.

However... She found his point quite reasonable.

Lenore shifted the topic, asking, ""Have you checked into a room yet?""

Daisy shook her head in frustration. ""There are no available rooms here either.""

Lenore paused for two seconds and said, ""I'm staying in a penthouse suite in this hotel. If you don't mind, you can sleep in the guest room.""

Daisy had no room to be picky at that moment and quickly expressed her gratitude.

Lenore moved out of the Linsey Residence before graduating from high school. That place never truly felt like his own home.

This was considered a scandal for the Linsey family, as John's illegitimate son Lenore was actually a year older than the real heir, Jim, the cherished son.

John had once fathered a child with a woman in secret, only to abandon her later, and eventually entered into a family-arranged marriage with Emily, Jim's mother.

The Underwood family lived next door to the Linsey family, and Daisy, at just five years old, would listen to her parents gossip about the Linseys.

Lenore hadn't originally lived with the Linsey family; it was his mother who had forced him into that household.

It was easy to imagine how awkward his situation was within the Linsey family.

Emily wouldn't even allow him to sit at the dinner table.

At that time, Daisy spent her days playing with Jim, who would tell her that Lenore was the child of a mistress, tainted with dirty blood, and a bad kid. Being so young, she took Jim's words to heart.

Pulling herself from her memories, Daisy found herself following Lenore into the room.

The signs of life in the suite were evident, and Daisy had no idea how long Lenore had been living there alone.

Lenore changed his shoes and, recalling something, said, ""There are no slippers for ladies here. I'll have the hotel send some up.""

Daisy felt embarrassed to trouble him and quickly waved her hand, ""It's fine, just for one night; I can manage.""

Lenore took off his coat, washed his hands, and then stepped into the kitchen. When he returned, he was holding a cup of warm water, which he placed on the coffee table for Daisy. ""Drinking some will warm you up.""

Daisy was still feeling cold and hadn't taken off her coat yet. She sat on the sofa, picked up the cup, and said thank you.

She actually wanted to ask Lenore why he had returned to the place so late, but it was clear he wasn't in the mood for conversation. He walked toward the master bedroom, saying indifferently, ""I won't be using the bathroom outside. There are disposable toiletries inside. Help yourself, and get some rest.""

Daisy opened her mouth to speak, but by then, the man had already entered the master bedroom, closing the door behind him.

She sighed inwardly. Lenore seemed just as he had before - Reserved, especially when it came to talking to her.

It wasn't entirely his fault. Given the things she and Jim had done in their childhood, it was a wonder he didn't dislike her.

Still, the warmth of the hot water made her feel somewhat revived. At least Lenore had provided her with a place to stay and a cup of warm water, while Jim had only given her the biting wind and snow tonight.

She slowly finished her water and stood up to wash up when there was a knock at the door.

Walking over to open it, she found a hotel staff member waiting outside.

""These are the things Mr. Linsey requested."" The waiter handed over the bag, and Daisy assumed it contained slippers. She thanked him as she took it.

After closing the door and opening the bag, she was taken aback.

The bag was large, and inside were not only the slippers but also brand new women's skincare products, and even a cup of hot drink-ginger tea with brown sugar.

That night, Daisy tossed and turned in the bed of the suite's guest room, unable to sleep.

Jim had thrown her a curve ball, forcing her to reevaluate their relationship.

In the early hours of the morning, just as sleep began to take hold, her phone vibrated suddenly. She picked it up to take a look.

Jim had sent a message: Daisy Bud, have you made it to the room?

Oh, so he still remembered that she existed.

She flipped her phone face down on the nightstand, closed her eyes, and in her drowsy state, a thought crossed her mind, ""Jim actually sucks... He's not even as good as Lenore.""

Chapter 3 She Couldn't Understand the Emotions in His Eyes

Daisy was a well-behaved girl, and throughout her life, she considered the most outrageous thing she had ever done was being an accomplice to Jim when they were kids.

When Lenore first arrived at the Linsey family, she not only faced cold treatment from Aunt Emily but also endured ostracism from all his classmates at school, all thanks to Jim's social connections.

Jim had always been popular among his peers; as a child, with just a word from him, his gang of followers would rush forward to torment Lenore.

One time, Daisy happened to witness it.

A group of kids tore apart Lenore's textbooks and homework, and Jim was among them.

The scene was suffocating. Lenore had actually wanted to run away, but someone spotted her and shoved a piece of Lenore's test paper into her hands, urging her to tear it too.

Little Daisy was rigid then.

""Tear it!"" a boy shouted, ""This is what the child of a mistress deserves, ruining other people's families and still having the nerve to come to school.""

""Exactly! He deserves this!""

To the children, there was no sense of sequence. They only knew that Lenore was a bastard, and her mother was the other woman.

Daisy's heart raced as the crowd jeered, everyone tearing at the pages, someone whistling. She closed her eyes, steeling herself, and ripped the test paper in her hands.

Just like that, Daisy safely integrated into the group. When she looked up, she accidentally locked eyes with Lenore.

Lenore was ten that year, but his gaze was already deep and dark, filled with emotions Daisy couldn't comprehend.

Feeling anxious and guilty, she quickly turned her face away.

In the morning, Daisy woke from her dreams, staring at the small chandelier on the ceiling, feeling a moment of confusion.

She couldn't understand why she had dreamt of something from so long ago.

As her body awakened, everything from last night flooded back into her mind, and she remembered.

Jim had a girlfriend now. He had fought for her, and they had even slept in one room.

She sat up, exhaling deeply, rubbed her face, and got out of bed to wash up.

When she stepped outside, she found Lenore was already up, sitting at the dining table. Hearing the noise, he looked over.

""Um... Good morning,"" Daisy said awkwardly, raising her hand in a half-hearted wave, still unsure of how to address him.

Lenore's face was expressionless as he simply said, ""Finish washing up and come eat breakfast.""

Surprisingly, there was breakfast to be had.

Daisy was a bit taken aback. As she entered the bathroom to freshen up, the dream from last night resurfaced in her mind, and she covered her face with her hands.

Although she later felt guilty and tried to make amends, the kind of hurt she caused was likely hard to forget.

If she, the perpetrator, couldn't forget, how could Lenore?

She began to wonder why he had taken her in last night.

Stepping out of the bathroom, Daisy obediently made her way to the dining room and sat across from Lenore.

It was a simple, ordinary breakfast, consisting of coffee, a bagel, and a few light sides.

As Daisy took a bite of the bagel, her eyes lit up. ""Is this from Marline Bakery?""

Lenore didn't look up, merely responding with a soft ""mm-hmm.""

Marline Bakery was quite famous in Jellyland City. Daisy had loved it before, but after the shop was discovered by a food blogger, it became a trendy spot, leading to the current situation where it was hard to get a bagel. Mornings required waiting in line for quite a while, and Daisy found it too much trouble, so she hadn't had one in ages.

Daisy enjoyed her breakfast thoroughly. As she wiped her mouth, she thought to say to Lenore, ""Thank you so much! Let me treat you to a meal sometime.""

Lenore paused in his motion of drying his hands. ""Sure.""

Daisy had expected him to decline. It wasn't that she was unwilling to buy him a meal; she just thought Lenore probably wouldn't want to have any further contact with her. She was surprised by how readily he agreed.

However, she felt it was only right to express her gratitude. She took out her phone. ""Let's exchange contact information, so we can set up a time.""

Lenore handed over his phone, and she scanned adding him as a friend.

His profile picture was a dark night sky with a single star hanging in the blackness.

""It suits his brooding personality,"" Daisy thought.

Suddenly, her phone vibrated in her hand. They both glanced over, and Daisy saw that Jim was calling.

Daisy furrowed her brow and stood up to answer the call.

As soon as she picked up, Jim's tense voice came through, ""Daisy Bud, where are you?""

Daisy hesitated.

She was with Lenore, and if Jim found out, he would probably go crazy.

Although Jim had matured with age and no longer referred to Lenore as the child of a mistress, he had always viewed Lenore as an intruder in his home.

He naturally assumed that Daisy was on his side.

Daisy replied, ""I... I'm at the hotel.""

""Why didn't you reply to my messages last night? You scared me to death..."" Jim sounded relieved, ""I thought you hadn't made it back to your room. I came to school looking for you around six this morning.""

At that moment, Daisy felt unusually calm, thinking that if she had really spent the night outside, his search at six in the morning would only be to help collect her body.

She remained silent, and Jim continued, ""As long as you're okay, by the way, you mustn't tell anyone about me going to the police station, especially my family. If my parents or grandpa find out, they'll skin me alive.""

Daisy realized she had already told Lenore.

She was in the living room now, glancing back at Lenore, hoping she wouldn't spill the beans to the Linsey family...

As luck would have it, Lenore stood up from the dining table and was looking in her direction.

Their eyes met, and Daisy felt a bit awkward, quickly averting her gaze as she told Jim, ""Got it.""

""I have to go to the police station today to handle the follow-up,"" Jim said, ""Once I'm done, I'll definitely treat you to a big meal as thanks.""

Daisy absentmindedly agreed.

After hanging up, she tried to sort through her thoughts.

She was in her senior year, just six months away from graduation. Originally, she thought that even if they didn't get married or engaged, Jim would at least show some sign of commitment, that they would establish their relationship.

Now Jim had indeed shown something... He said he was dating someone.

She felt incredibly hurt, a heavy weight in her chest, unable to think clearly. This was the man she had liked since she first fell in love; she had always believed it would be mutual, but it turned out to be a one-sided affection that ended without resolution.

No matter how Jim handled this, she would have to explain everything to her parents.

There was a knock at the door, and Lenore walked straight to open it.

A moment later, she returned with a large paper tote bag in hand, handing it to Daisy, ""It's cold outside; put this on before you go out.""

Daisy took the package and opened it to find a brand new women's down jacket, and it was from her usual brand.

She felt a bit embarrassed to accept it, but she was indeed very cold, so she asked, ""How much is it? I can transfer the money to you.""

Lenore was silent for a few seconds before replying, ""No need, consider it an early birthday gift from me to you.""

Daisy was surprised that Lenore even remembered her birthday, which was just next week.

This gift felt quite strange. She had never received a gift from him before, and she had never invited him to her birthday celebrations since Jim was always around during that time.

Naturally, she hadn't planned to invite him this time either, which made things awkward...

She racked her brain and finally came up with a solution, saying, ""So, what do you want for your birthday? I can get you something.""

""No need,"" Lenore replied casually, ""My birthday has already passed, and... I never celebrate my birthday.""",2,1752534513.0,novelsfree,1,1.0,False

Quarter to five, Mike sat patiently at his desk, the towering skyscrapers outside his window looming like silent, steel giants. The faint hum of the office AC and the rhythmic tap of keyboards were the only sounds that broke the otherwise stifling silence. He worked a normal nine to five at a small office department, no wife or kids, and monthly paid rent on an overpriced apartment. In every meaning of the word, Mike could be described as just an average guy. What the outside eye misses is the intricacies and characteristics of every human being, as specific as they all are, are too much to ever define a person as, ‚ÄúAverage.‚Äù Mike had his fair share of oddities, ones he tried to hide, like us all. He had many dreams, which you couldn‚Äôt see through the way he lived his life, and he wasn't the type to share them. Mike's work life was quite unintriguing, and not all of that was necessarily due to Mike.  Each morning, colleagues shuffled in, their faces blank, their greetings automated. They moved like clockwork, pouring identical cups of coffee, settling into the same worn chairs, their actions devoid of spontaneity. Their work life was a relentless hamster wheel, a futile chase after a carrot forever dangling just out of reach. Each day bled into the next, an endless cycle of monotony that led nowhere and to nothing. Mike would leave his work parking lot at almost the exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. He would then take a few left and right turns until he got to the auditorium. 

The auditorium screamed with neglect, its faded velvet seats ripped and stained, the air thick with the scent of dust and forgotten dreams. But to Mike, it pulsed with possibility, each broken chair a testament to the magic it once held within its walls. He had been working for this moment for months and months, imagining and replaying his dream over and over again in his head. It became his driving force, completely infatuated with his dream, the dream of being a magician. It was an odd dream, not shared by many. Interest sparked in Mike at a young age, his seventh birthday party, and in which his parents hired a magician. The magician put on a fantastic show, loud applause rained from both him and all of his classmates that his mother had invited. In that moment Mike knew what he wanted, and it never changed. Even if we deny it, or are scared to admit it, it's what we all deep down inside want and crave. The dream of being something special. For Mike, he planned this his whole life. Before he went to sleep, while he was asleep dreaming, sitting in the back of class, all Mike ever imagined to do was to have an audience cheer him on, and give him the same affection that they did that magician at his seventh birthday party. If this could just go right for Mike this time, everything would be alright, it would all be fixed. 

The show began, presented by Mikey the magic man. After a few basic introduction tricks, the audience clapped, but not at the tone he remembered. He thinks back to the only way he could really impress them, he must put all his chips on the table and go for the prestige. This act would make or break Mike's show, and in reality his life as well. Mike pivoted quickly, and remembered the act that wowed his classmates so long ago, the infamous saw act. It was fairly simple, one he had practiced many times over and over in his head. All he would have to do is saw a woman in half and put her back together. The trick had been done many times by others, and for a magician of Mike's caliber should be inconsequential. The first cut was clean, the body was split into halves. Mike glanced at the crowd, expecting applause, but met only silence. Faces contorted in disgust, eyes burning with a hatred he couldn't comprehend. A cold dread washed over him. Had he miscalculated? What went wrong? Excruciatingly, he looks back onto the stage.  Every fiber in his body felt empty, like he was stuck in this moment for decades. What had once been complete, then broken, was entirely incomplete now. Her body laid lifeless, guts falling onto the stage, Mike immediately covers his face to mask the smell of a rotting corpse, as he loosens his ever tight grip of the saw, dropping it right into his victims still-pumping heart. 
As he turns away towards the audience, they start to scream and concurrently trash the stage. He begs and pleads for forgiveness, but is met with a pure moment of anarchy. All that was once slow, was now racing around and nothing makes sense. Did anything ever make sense? Or was the discontentment masked by the revolving door.  Mike scans around the room and trembles in fear. The dream was over, he would wake up soon but the show could not go on. Even after the chaos, it couldn't be the same. Mike dropped down to the floor, sobbing and screaming in agony. Despair consuming him, he clawed at his scalp, tufts of hair scattering like fallen leaves. Then, with a gut wrenching scream, he gouged at his eyes, the vibrant blue fading into a bloody mess. He tore at his skin, desperate to shed the weight of his failure, until finally, only the stark, white bones of his shattered dreams remained on his decrepit body. His mangled skeleton figure laid there on stage, still being trashed by the crowd, greasy popcorn and flat soda covered his remains. Mike had reduced himself down into nothing and nobody.

8:37 am. Then came nine. Programmed, programmed to come in, say the same things, drink the same coffee, sit in the same seat, and do the same unimportant work every single day. A hamster wheel back and forth, futilely chasing at something that can never be obtained. Mike would leave his work parking lot at the same exact time every day. It was about 5:15 each day,  his boss would never truly let them out until 5:07, and then after a few casual conversations and meaningless goodbyes, Mike would be gone. Nothing compares to childhood innocence, fever dreams, a fading memory. A revolving door never stops its orbit, until you step out.",2,1752534444.0,flashfiction,8,1.0,False

Im upgrading from a fairly cheap delonghi bean to cup machine to espresso.

Ive already got a DF54 on order, but now im deciding on a machine. And im currently experiencing paralysis through over analysis.

The sensible thing would be for me to get a bambino plus and give that a go to wet my feet but i know ill probably want something better after a year or so,  so ive been looking at the Gaggia Classic pro models as i really like the idea of the cosmetic mods and some of the performance ones as well. Bambino plus is about ¬£330 and i can get a refurbed brass E24 gaggia for ¬£510 or Aluminium for ¬£475 which both include the full Gaggia warranty.

My questions are:

1)  having come from a bean to cup machine will the 9 bar mod make that much a difference to me taste wise or will 15bar be fine for the medium to short term? I can then look to upgrade later once ive worked out the machine. Im just worried about voiding warranty and would just like to have a nice coffee after unboxing tbh. 

2) is the gaggia actually that challenging to use or is it exaggerated? I dont have an issue with learning curves but coming from a bean to cup it would be good to be able to make a cup good enough after a few goes

3) is the machine usable out of the box, are the mods a must have or nice to have. Ive looked at gaggiuino and I wouldnt attempt that but the spring and pid upgrades look easy enough to do but I will probably look to do that once ive learnt how to use the machine.

4) how long does it actually take from turning on to get a drinkable espresso? I get up at 5 in the morning and I dont always have time to wait 15-20 mins until i can have the coffee. Should i just get a bambino plus? The reason i got the DF54 was so i could easily swap to other brew types so i could always just go to V60 or aeropress instead in this instance.

5) brass worth the extra over aluminium?

I‚Äôm having a major issue with my Philips EP4349/70 coffee machine ‚Äî it won‚Äôt turn on¬†**at all**. No lights, no sounds, nothing, as if it‚Äôs completely dead.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve tried so far:

* Unplugged and replugged the power cable
* Tried multiple power outlets
* Pressed the power button in different ways (with different fingers, holding for several seconds)
* Tried holding the button after reconnecting the power
* Put the LatteGo on and off

Unfortunately, nothing works.

I'll receive a new third-party power cable tomorrow but I doubt It'll do the trick...

For context, I already had to send the machine in for a¬†**pump replacement**¬†once before (still under warranty at the time). Now it‚Äôs out of warranty ‚Äî I bought it in 2022 for around ‚Ç¨700 ‚Äî and Philips support over the phone wasn‚Äôt helpful. They only suggested sending it in for repair at a flat rate of¬†**‚Ç¨150**, with no guarantees.

That‚Äôs two major issues in under three years for an expensive machine, which is really disappointing.

Has anyone experienced something similar or found a fix for this kind of issue?

Thanks in advance for any help or advice!",1,1752534245.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False
