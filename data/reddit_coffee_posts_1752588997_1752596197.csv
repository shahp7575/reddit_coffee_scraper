1m0m0s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianwriters/comments/1m0m0s3/my_girlfriend_just_finished_writing_her_very/,"My girlfriend just finished writing her very first story. She’s been nervous. It would mean a lot to both of us if you could take a few minutes to read it and share your thoughts. Please be genuine and kind she’s just starting out, and I want her to stay motivated and keep writing.","""Mumma, mathri khaogi?"" I asked, the steam from the chai curling in slow spirals as I poured it into the dented steel cups, worn but familiar, like everything in this house.  

Mumma and Papa were sitting outside in the baramda, our little home-turned-café, wrapped in shawls and gentle bickering. She was pushing for white LED strips to go above the entrance. “It should glow,” she said, brushing stray hair from her cheek with the back of her hand. “People should see it from the road and wonder what’s brewing.” 

Papa took the cup from my hand without looking, already locked in his own quiet logic. “Hang them in the trees,” he said. “Not everything has to shout. Some things should whisper.” 

Their voices folded into the background sounds of a slow morning. The soft clink of cups, the wind sighing through the deodar trees, a motorbike in the distance that came and went like a thought. I stood still for a moment, watching them through the curtain. Nothing dramatic. Just two people who built something together and kept building it, one decision at a time. 

Winter always brought something with it. A kind of electricity in the air, a rhythm that made everything feel more alive. It wasn’t just the cold or the glitter of frost on rooftops. It was the season of laughter, of crowded tables and extra pots of chai, of mufflers pulled up to noses and cheeks pink from the mountain wind. 

And of course, money. 

Our small café came alive during this time. It sat at a gentle curve along the main road, the one that led up to the highest point of the hill. Tourists passed by almost every hour, especially in December, when they came for the main event that put our sleepy town on the map - the Winter Season Fireworks. 

They came to see the sky catch fire with color. 

From the café windows, the early bursts of fireworks looked like stars splitting open above the dark ridgelines. The glow would dance on the glass, flicker across half-empty cups and quiet conversations. Some visitors came long before the rush, just to claim the tables by the window;  not for food, but for the view. By the time the real show began, the café would be shut, lights off, warmth sealed behind glass. The rest of it; the noise, the wonder, the sky; belonged to the outside world. 

The café had charm. It wasn’t fancy, but it had stories in every corner. Wooden walls with uneven planks, old travel photos pinned behind glass, chairs that didn’t match but somehow belonged together. The smell of cinnamon drifted out through the open door, and a soft playlist always played in the background, the kind you didn’t notice until it stopped. 

This place had grown into something more than a business. It was part of me now. A place I could read people’s faces like familiar pages. A place that held my quiet, my routines, my memories. 

I wiped the counter slowly, eyes on the passing crowd outside. It felt like just another day. A good one. Busy, cold, happy. 

""Yes beta, bring some biscuits for Juli too,"" Mumma said softly, tucking her cold fingers deeper into the folds of her shawl. 

She was sitting on the wicker chair in the baramda, her slippers slightly crooked at her feet, soaking in the winter sun like it was medicine. Her hair was loosely tied, with tiny wisps dancing near her ears whenever the wind brushed past. That shawl - the faded maroon one with a hole near the edge - was draped around her like armor, even though she kept complaining about how useless it was. 

Juli barked once in approval, her tail thumping against the wooden floor like a drumroll. 

""Mumma, Juli eats better than me,"" I said, picking up the biscuit tin from the shelf near the counter. 

""That’s because she doesn’t answer back,"" Papa muttered from behind his newspaper, lowering it just enough to show the amused flicker in his eyes. Papa sat by the railing with his newspaper, legs crossed, eyes scanning like he was still on patrol. The army never really left his face. It stayed in the way he sat straight, the discipline in his silence, the sharpness in his gaze. 

But retirement had softened him. These days, he spent his mornings sipping chai, teasing Mumma about her café plans, and acting like he hadn’t trained an entire unit in another life. 

""That’s because she doesn’t understand you,"" I replied. 

""Exactly. That’s why we get along."" 

Mumma snorted and shook her head. ""You two should start your own comedy show. Call it Dog, Daughter, and the Grumpy Man."" 

""Coming soon to YouTube,"" I added, tossing a biscuit to Juli who caught it mid-air like the drama queen she was. 

Papa set the newspaper aside and stretched his legs with a groan that was mostly for attention. ""So who’s going to remind the gas guy today?"" 

""Not me,"" I said. ""I’m too busy living my twenties. You should try it sometime."" 

""At this point I don’t even remember my twenties,"" he replied. ""I think I skipped straight to paying bills and emotional blackmail."" 

We all laughed, even Juli, in her own tail-wagging way. The kind of laughter that didn’t need to be loud to feel full. The kind that warmed you better than the sun. 

 

… 

 

It was four in the evening, and already the town felt like it was bursting at the seams. 

Today was the final day of the Winter Fireworks Festival. The last show. The grand finale. Tourists had arrived in full force, knowing this was their last chance to catch the magic. Every corner of the street buzzed with movement - camera clicks, food stalls, muffled announcements, and kids dragging parents toward ice cream carts. 

Papa sat outside with his tea, quietly scanning the crowd like he was still on duty. Mumma kept chatting with a group of women from Delhi, already giving them suggestions for tomorrow's breakfast, even though they’d be gone by then. Juli, curled up beside the counter, only moved when someone opened a packet of chips. 

There was something soft about witnessing other people’s joy. It didn’t make me lonely. It made me feel part of something bigger. Like I was holding space for happiness, even if it wasn’t mine. 

I cleared a table near the window where an old couple had just left, the scent of their filter coffee still lingering. At the far corner, two friends were laughing over a terrible selfie. A young boy sat with his father, pointing out birds on the hills like they were fireworks already. 

“Didi, ketchup please?” one of the waiters called out from the back. 

“Coming,” I replied, grabbing the bottle from the shelf and weaving through the crowd with practiced ease. 

Juli followed me lazily, tail swaying, half asleep from the sun. Papa gave me a nod as I passed, as if to say, Good soldier. Mumma didn’t even look up - she was deep in conversation, already convincing someone to try her special masala chai before sunset.I set the ketchup down at the table, smiled at the kids, then stepped back and took a small breath. 

There was warmth in the room. Not just from the heaters or the chai, but from the people. This kind of warmth that didn’t ask for anything, just stayed long enough to be felt. 

I looked out the window. I caught a glimpse of myself in the reflection of the glass - black t-shirt, wide-legged jeans sweeping over my sneakers, the hem catching on a chair leg as I moved past. My bun had half fallen apart, but it was too late to care. 

""One chocolate lava cake, please,"" came a firm voice from table number three. 

""On its way,"" I called back, already halfway there with the tray in my hands. The apron strings tugged at my waist, and I adjusted them quickly, brushing a few loose strands of hair out of my face with my wrist. 

There was a small boy at the table, maybe in class three. His legs barely reached the edge of the chair, and his eyes lit up the moment soon he saw the cake. As I approached, he started clapping with pure excitement. His parents joined in, singing a quiet, off-key happy birthday song that still somehow filled the whole room with warmth. 

His smile was so bright it could’ve melted any bad day, the kind that made you forget the cold, the crowd, and the rush. The kind that reminded you why sweetness mattered. 

I set the cake down gently on the table, then reached into my apron and pulled out a small deer-shaped candle. I always kept a few with me during festival season - just in case. The silver pendant around my neck bumped softly against my chest as I leaned forward to place the cake down, lit the little deer-shaped candle I always carried in my apron. It sparkled for a second before catching flame. 

The boy stared, wide-eyed, hands still resting on the table like he was scared to move and lose the moment. 

Before I turned away, I handed him a little reindeer-shaped candy I had tucked in my pocket. His smile widened as he looked up at me. 

""Thank you, Didi,"" he said softly. 

I smiled back, and just like that, I melted a little too.  

I pushed the tray back onto my hip and turned to go, catching a flash of my ring as I reached to steady a wobbly cup. The old ring on my index finger shimmered for a second before fading back into movement. 

Then I turned toward the kitchen to help Mumma. More orders were coming in. Tables needed cleaning, plates needed serving, and somewhere in the back, the water was boiling again for chai. 

Tring. 

The bell above the door rang softly as another couple stepped into the café, cheeks pink from the cold, fingers laced together like they couldn’t bear to let go. They slid into table seven, still laughing at something only they knew. Probably in high school; they had that wide-eyed energy, like the world hadn’t hit them too hard yet. Both of them wore matching hoodies. Navy blue, with tiny embroidered moons stitched onto the left side of the chest. His was a size too big, hanging loose over his jeans. Hers was tucked into her waistband, the sleeves rolled back neatly, like she wanted to look effortless but knew she looked adorable. Their hair was a bit windblown, and their eyes held that kind of joy you can’t fake. 

As I passed by their table, I caught a glimpse of them in conversation. She was speaking fast, hands moving as she explained something only she found funny. He just sat there, quietly smiling, watching her like every word she said mattered. 

And for a moment, I thought of us. 

Me and Akshay. 

Akshay. The boy I’d somehow ended up loving with every version of myself. 

It still felt strange sometimes — not because it wasn’t real, but because it had started to feel distant.   
Like a photograph tucked inside a drawer. Still mine. Still warm. Just… waiting to be touched again. But I remembered the way he used to listen to me. Just like that boy was listening to her. Fully. As if he had nowhere else to be. 

It happened in second year. 

Winter had wrapped the campus in fog. The hostel corridors always smelled like Maggie and wet socks, and the benches near the back gate were too cold to sit on without a scarf. 

We were walking after dinner, one hand stuffed in our pocket and paper cups of chai in the other hand, talking about absolutely nothing. 

Neither of us was talking. Not in a bad way. Just… silence. A quiet so comfortable, it felt like speaking would ruin it. He nudged my shoulder gently. “You’ve been weird all day.” 

I sipped the chai. “I’m always weird.” 

“No. Like… extra weird. Avoiding-eye-contact weird.” 

I stared at my cup for a long second. 

“Because I know if I look at you, I’ll say something I shouldn’t,” I whispered. 

Akshay was still for a second, then leaned slightly toward me. “Say it.” 

I shook my head. 

“Harshita.” 

I finally looked at him. My voice broke before it even fully formed. 

“I like you. And I’ve been trying really hard to pretend I don’t. But today... I’m tired of pretending.” 

He didn’t answer right away. He just smiled. Soft. It was one of those soft, tucked-away smiles. He let out a breath. Not a sigh. Just the kind that sounds like something finally loosening. 

“I wanted to tell you a hundred times,” he said. “But every time I looked at you, I got scared I'd ruin everything. Because once I say this, it doesn't go back.” 

He finally met my eyes. 

“I don’t like you casually, Harshita. I like you in that terrifying, all-the-way, change-my-whole-life kind of way…. And I like you in that annoying, can’t-look-at-anyone-else kind of way.” 

I held my breath. “And?” 

He looked at me then. Really looked. Not like a friend. Not like someone being careful. Just… him. 

“I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to mess it up,” he said. “But every time you walked into a room, I forgot whatever I was thinking.” 

My heart stilled. 

“I didn’t plan on feeling this way. But now I don’t know how to feel anything else.” I looked at him, smiled like an idiot, and thought- God, I’m never getting over this boy. 

After the end of fourth year, he moved to Bangalore for an internship. And ever since, everything's been through screens - video calls, voice notes, texts that sometimes came too late but never felt too far. 

We even planned a virtual movie date on his birthday. I wore a dress just to feel like it mattered, and he showed up in his hoodie, grinning at the screen like we weren’t hundreds of kilometers apart. The movie lagged. The timing was off. But somehow, it still felt like us.  

I didn’t say it out loud. But I kept wondering. Would he come this winter? Would I finally get to see him? Not through a screen. Not in a call. Just him. Real. Right in front of me. 

As the day went on, the café slowly dipped into golden light. The sun was setting behind the hills, turning the windows warm and soft. I was at the counter, stacking glasses one over another, their rims clinking gently as I worked. 

Then, the bell rang again. 

A group of boys stepped inside, laughing loud, their voices filling the space like wind. I heard someone say something about a football match. Chhetri had scored at the last minute, apparently. They were buzzing with that kind of energy only sports fans had. 

And then I heard it. 

That voice. 

Familiar in a way that hit me like a wave. My heart jumped so fast I actually stopped moving for a second. My eyes widened. A smile pulled across my face before I could even stop it. 

My back was still turned, but I knew. 

Someone had come up behind me. Close. Not speaking. Just there. 

And I knew exactly who it was. 

How could I forget that smell? The faint citrus warmth of his cologne, the one with a trace of cedar and something almost like cardamom. Terre d’Hermès. It always made him feel like winter and memories. 

His presence wasn’t loud. But it shifted everything. The kind that fills a room without trying. The kind that finds you. 

I didn’t even need to look. My ears were already burning. My chest felt like it was about to betray me. 

When I finally turned, he was right there. 

Smiling. 

That soft little smile that curled just slightly, tugging his dimple into place. His cheeks were pink from the cold. His curls were messy, damp from melted snow. A few flakes still clung to the tips. 

He was wearing a warm brown puffer jacket over a faded green sweatshirt, hands stuffed in his pockets like he was trying to stay casual about it. But his eyes were all warmth.  

I finally saw him. In real. After eighteen months and twenty-three days. That long.  

He was standing right in front of me. And for a second, I felt everything all at once. Joy. Nerves. That quiet ache that had been sitting under my skin since the day he left.  

He looked at me with a strange expression. As if he read something in my face that unsettled him. Something he didn’t expect to see. 

“Eighteen months,” he said slowly, his voice almost careful. “Twenty-three days. Fifteen hours…” 

He paused, glanced down at his watch. 

“…and twenty-four minutes.” 

I laughed. Of course he knew. 

He laughed too. That same old laugh. A little crooked, a little shy. And for a second, I wanted to wrap my arms around him. Hold him so tight he’d feel every second I spent missing him. 

But I didn’t. 

I just smiled, trying not to look too shaken. 

“When did you come?” I asked. “And why didn’t you tell me?” 

He shrugged. “I wanted to surprise you.” 

“Well,” I said, unable to stop smiling, “you already did” ; looking at him 

And in that second, nothing else mattered. The glasses, the café, the winter - everything melted. 

“Hey, Harshita,” a bold voice came from behind Akshay, along with an arm thrown casually over his shoulder. 

It was Rohan - Akshay’s brother-like best friend. Loud, warm, always carrying some kind of plan in his grin. 

“So?” he said, smirking at me. “How’s the surprise?” 

I narrowed my eyes at both of them. “So it was your idea, wasn’t it?” 

They chuckled, looking at each other like I’d just caught them red-handed. 

We’d bumped into each other recently, Rohan and I - at D-Mart, of all places, while I was out with Mumma. And in the middle of picking snacks and talking about toothpaste brands, I had slipped. Said something about missing Akshay. Said I didn’t know when he’d be back. 

I guess that’s when Rohan decided to make something happen. 

“He’s only here for a day,” Rohan said, casually. 

“Flight’s at 3 a.m.” 

I blinked. “Wait. What?” 

Akshay rubbed the back of his neck, like he knew how that would land. 

“Yeah, I came home yesterday,” he said. “We’re in the final stages of our launch. Company gave us a two-day break. That’s the only way I could come.” I nodded slowly, pretending to focus on the floor, pretending my throat wasn’t suddenly dry. 

I wanted to ask why he hadn’t messaged. Why I didn’t get even a single text saying he was in the same city as me. But I didn’t. I just tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and forced a smile, the kind you give when you don’t trust your voice. 

Akshay watched me for a second - really watched. Like he’d seen that flicker pass across my face, the one I tried to hide. 

When he spoke again, his voice had changed. Lower. Gentler. Like the words were only meant for me. 

“I could’ve called,” he said, eyes steady on mine. “But I didn’t want to hear your voice. I wanted to see your face.” I could feel my cheeks heating up. My breath caught. My fingers curled a little tighter around the tray I was holding. I wasn’t expecting that. Not from him. Not like that. 

There was a tiny pause — one of those still moments where you don't know what to do with the way your heart just flipped. 

And then Rohan grinned. 

He smacked Akshay’s arm lightly and said, “Bro, save some smoothness for the rest of us. We single people still trying out here.” I bursts out laugh without warning. Akshay chuckled too, rubbing the back of his neck, clearly a little embarrassed now. The tension dissolved just enough to breathe again. But the feeling? That stayed. Just as the air between us began to settle, Mumma’s voice called from the kitchen. 

“Harshita beta, zara yeh trays andar le jaa na.” 

“Coming!” I called back, stealing one last glance at Akshay. He gave a tiny nod. That familiar, boyish one, says go, I’ll be here. 

I turned and walked back behind the counter, hands suddenly too aware of themselves. As I moved trays and refilled cups, I heard Rohan tease, “So... romantic airport entry, café surprise, and emotional eye contact? Bro, you’re basically the male lead now.” 

Akshay groaned. “Rohan, stop.” 

“What? Next thing I know, you’ll be writing shayari on the plane back.” 

Their laughter drifted in. I smiled to myself as I wiped a table.  

From where I stood, I could still see them sitting near the window. The light outside had turned golden. Rohan kept talking with full-body gestures, probably telling one of his weird gaminf stories again. Akshay listened with half a smile. 

And then - he looked at me. 

Our eyes met. 

It wasn’t intense. It wasn’t dramatic. Just… gentle. Familiar. A smile shared in the middle of everything and nothing. He raised his cup slightly, as if to say cheers. I raised an eyebrow, mouthing show-off. He grinned. And just like that, the moment passed. 

Later, when I turned to grab another order, their table was empty. But just as I stepped out from behind the counter, I caught sight of them by the door. Rohan was already halfway out, talking to someone on the phone. Akshay lingered for half a second. 

Our eyes met again. 

He smiled - that soft, slow one that still made something in my chest go quiet - and lifted his hand in a small wave. I didn’t say anything. Just smiled back and nodded, like we both understood that this was enough. 

And then he turned and walked out into the cold. No goodbyes .Just that wave. And honestly… it was more than enough. 

I finished up the last of the chores, smiling to myself like an idiot. His face, his voice, that wave - it all played on loop in my head, softer than any music. 

Outside, the sky had already started turning silver with sparks. The crowd buzzed with excitement, but inside the café, it was calm. Warm. I looked around at the space I knew like the back of my hand - half-lit now, soft clatter in the background, and the smell of cinnamon still lingering. 

“It’s time to close,” I said, turning to the staff. “You all can go. Go enjoy the fireworks - the rest can wait till tomorrow.” 

They smiled, said their goodnights, and shuffled out with excited chatter. 

Mumma and Papa were still inside, adjusting the chairs, stacking a few things back in place. 

“You two go too,” I told them. “Go catch the show, I’ll lock up.” 

Mumma gave me a tired look, then a knowing smile. Papa hesitated for a second but nodded. “Don’t take too long.” 

“I won’t,” I promised. 

Once they were gone, the café felt quieter - like it exhaled with me. I wiped down the last counter, tucked in the loose chairs one by one, the scrape of wood and the hum of the fridge the only sounds left. My fingers were a little cold, but it felt nice — the kind of quiet that settles in after a long, full day.I was just slipping the key into the café’s shutter, one hand still brushing snow off the step, when I heard it- 

Phussshhh.  

A sharp hiss, followed by a burst. I looked up. The sky cracked open in green and silver, the color spilling through the fog like spilled paint on canvas. 

“Shuru ho gaya,” I whispered to myself, smiling. 

Fireworks. 

Right on time. The café had quieted down. I stood behind the counter for a second longer, fingers resting on the edge. One deep breath in. 

Then I reached behind my neck and untied the apron, folding it neatly and setting it on the stool. My hair, slightly messy from the long shift, was still pinned in that loose bun. I tugged it free. The strands fell just past my shoulders, still carrying a faint scent of coffee and cinnamon. I slipped on my sweater, then my jacket. Wrapped the muffler Mumma had knitted last winter around my neck - warm, soft, still smelling like home. 

Outside, the sky cracked again - another firework. 

I was still a little far from the main square. But it didn’t matter. 

The lights had started. 

And so had the night. 

I stepped out of the café and into the cold. The roads were quiet here - not empty, but hushed. A thin layer of snow covered the ground, crunching softly under my boots with every step. 

Far ahead, I could see the heart of the crowd gathered near the main square, where the night’s final fireworks would soon begin. Music played in the distance sounds faint, like it was coming from another world. 

I was still a little far from it all. But I didn’t mind. 

The walk felt good. Like I needed these few minutes of in-between. The space between the café and the crowd, between what just happened and what might happen next. 

Yellow lights spilled from windows. Strings of fairy lights blinked lazily along the rooftops. Somewhere behind me, a group of kids giggled and threw snowballs at each other, their joy bouncing off the walls like echoes. 

My breath curled in the air, soft and white. 

The muffler around my shoulders slipped a little, and I tugged it closer. I’d just stepped onto the snowy road when- 

Boom. 

The sky burst open again, this time in gold and crimson. 

I tilted my head up, hands tucked into my jacket, eyes full of stars. 

Another firework bloomed above me. 

The ground felt alive - footsteps, laughter, the hum of the crowd, the beat of dhols from the distance. Stalls were lined up along the road, selling everything from hot jalebis to steaming kulhad chai. 

I passed a small stall where a kid pointed at a balloon and said, “Papa! Blue wala chahiye!”   
I smiled. That kind of excitement only lives in winter festivals. 

As I walked through the crowd, someone brushed past me — not harsh, just enough to make me pause. 

“Sorry, didi,” a teenager muttered, hurrying to catch up with his friends. I took a deep breath, looking up. 

And then-   
boom. 

The sky cracked open in gold 

 

a softer sound came from behind. 

“Harshita…” 

I turned. 

There he was - standing a few steps behind, hands in his pockets, curls dusted with snow, that same smile tugging at his lips. 

“You’re still here?” I asked, surprised. “I thought you left with Rohan?” 

“I did,” he said, walking closer. “Spent time with them. Did my part. Ab baaki time tumhara hai.” 

I blinked. “You were waiting for me?” 

He huffed, dramatic. “Haan! Khud sab ka kaam khatam kar liya, aur madam fir counter ke glass saaf karne chali gyi.” 

I laughed. “Excuse me? Glass saaf karna bhi art hota hai.” 

“Oh sure,” he teased. “Aur mujhe laga tum mujhe miss kar rahi hogi. But no, you chose-table wiping romance.” 

I nudged him with my elbow. “Shut up.” 

He grinned, stepping beside me. “Finally. Took you long enough.” 

He grinned. “Next time I’ll bring a jhaadu. At least I’ll get five minutes of your attention.” 

“You’re such a drama queen,” I laughed, swatting at him lightly. 

“And yet,” he said, eyes soft, “you missed me.” I opened my mouth to toss something back - something sassy and smug - 

But boom. 

The sky exploded above us again, this time in a wild spread of gold and red. The last round. We both looked up instinctively. The lights reflected on his face. On his lashes. On the tiny snowflakes tangled in his curls. For a moment, neither of us said anything. We weren’t at the main event. We hadn’t made it to the crowd. 

But right there, in the quiet street dusted with snow, it felt like this was ours. 

He glanced sideways, his voice lower now. 

“Perfect spot, na?” 

I nodded, heart too full to say much. 

“Perfect.” 

We stood there as the final firework faded, the last flicker of gold disappearing into the night. 

Neither of us moved. 

Until Akshay quietly reached out, tugged his jacket open slightly, and slipped my hand inside with his. 

No words. Just warmth. 

We started walking. 

Slow. Unhurried. Like the world could wait a little longer. 

I didn’t even realize when my head found its way to his shoulder. He didn’t flinch. Just leaned a little closer, matching his steps with mine. 

The roads were nearly empty now. Festival lights blinked softly above. A leftover song played faintly from somewhere far. 

And then- the snow began to fall again. Tiny, quiet flakes swirling through the streetlamps. One landed on his curl, another on the back of my hand. He looked down at me, smiled without saying anything. 

I smiled back. 

Some things don’t need fireworks. Sometimes, they just need to stay.

On paper I’m fine. I smile. I get things done. I even make pancakes that could probably start a cult. But lately, something feels hollow. 

I’ve been a single for a while. Not dramatically. More like a plant left on a windowsill. I’m still here, just a little thirstier than I want to admit.

It’s not just about sex. That too but its the quiet stuff I miss. The shared laugh over burnt toast. The brush of someone’s hand on your back while you're making eggs. That familiar weight next to you that doesn’t ask for anything except presence.

Yesterday after a long shower, I stood by the window, applying moisturizer, my skin warm and smelling faintly of sandalwood. I put on a crisp linen shirt and felt this wave of longing hit me. Not just for touch, but for someone who would understand exactly how that moment felt. Not because I said anything. Just because she would know. And that someone is getting harder and harder to find and meet.

I write stories about connection. Once a woman messaged me that something I wrote made her cry alone at a gas station in Vermont. That stuck with me. I think part of me wants to be that for someone. Not the tears, but the softness. The kind that makes loneliness feel less sharp.

I’ve solo-traveled through cities I still dream about. I’ve had moments of joy so unexpected I laughed out loud in the middle of a crowd. I know how to be alone. But lately even my best writing can’t reach the part of me that just wants to hold someone’s ankle while she reads on the couch. Or hear a key in the door and feel peace instead of quiet.

Most conversations these days feel like scenes. Everyone playing a part. I want something unrehearsed. Messy. Honest. Real.

If you’ve ever whispered into the dark too, drop a DM please. I think a lot of us are quieter versions of each other.

We spent 3 months here in Burlington and have been shocked by just how terrible it is here. 

Thieves are extremely commonplace, every single day and night they are riddling the streets trying every avenue to exploit the public. Every night we see Ring camera videos of our neighbors cars being broken into or someone dragging their trash all over the yard looking for whatever they can get. 

You can’t go anywhere without some drugged out homeless person yelling at you or hunched over motionless in the middle of CVS, covered in lesions. 

This is way worse than any place in Boston, no small towns in New England are like this at all. There is a higher rate of per capita gun violence than NYC I believe (correct me if I’m wrong).   

Yes I know, there a lot of struggling people here, yes I know it’s due to idiots running the government are responsible. 

But it sucks not being able to walk into Battery Park at sunset because there’s like a mentally unstable person shooting up every 3 feet or an open air drug market next to church street when I just want to get a coffee and go shopping for some groceries. 

Everyone said I’d have so much fun in Burlington for the summer, it’s so nice by the lake, but damn. The thieves and drugs ruined this place.

I started a new Discord server called **Minnesota Nice** — a chill space for folks **30 and up** who live in Minnesota Metro and are looking to make new friends, hang out, and maybe get out and do things together once in a while. We're nearing 400 people!

Whether you're into coffee meetups, hiking, game nights, brewery crawls, or just good conversation online — this is meant to be a judgment-free, laid-back community for people who are past the college party scene but still want connection, fun, and shared experiences.

If you're tired of feeling like the oldest one in the group chats or just want to find like-minded people in the area, come join us!

If you’ve never used Discord before, it’s actually pretty easy to get the hang of. You can also customize your notifications—either turn them off entirely or set them to only alert you when someone mentions you, so you don’t get overwhelmed by every message. If you run into any issues or need help with this, feel free to reach out! I’m a mod in the server under the name Mark.

Here is the Discord link and I hope to see you there! [https://discord.gg/CPtfcTg3TM](https://discord.gg/CPtfcTg3TM)

He was readily available and seemed keen to continue. However, around the 6th date over a 3-4 week period, I found myself looking forward to going home. For a start it was too long. I felt my social battery dwindling after around 3 hours (walk, food, then coffee shop) and yet he proceeded to insist we go to the beach on the way home. So (lacking assertiveness) agreed. All was okay in general, and he's cute, but I just didn't want to talk about the usual subjects anymore- some local history (not that interested), who owns what business (he's an entrepreneur, I work in medicine), the details of the family living down the road in the village. On the whole , I also noticed that if I tell him my own stuff and stories, he listens and nods, doesn't really know what to say let alone offer me anything interesting,then it is back to him and his interests. Summed up, I am being faced with intellectual dissatisfaction. My ex partner pretended he had depth and intellect for a long time, and I soon discovered that he didn't. My experience with the ex was that conversation was simple, lacked intimacy and I had a whole range of topics that were banned. So I've come to value (more than ever before) someone who is receptive to me. Someone who genuinely reciprocates interest. Just because I'm a good listener and receptive to what you have to say, doesn't mean I want to be talking to the wall about my own thoughts and experiences. With this context, I didn't feel like meeting him again as tbh I felt it wasn't the best use of my time, I'm busy. But now I'm struggling to be honest. I've asked for time away to work on some of the stressful things going on in my life (my mum recently out of hospital for MH problems), two teen sons, new kittens and a leaking roof. I have a great job but healthcare is 'overstimulating'. I asked him not to wait around for me. Genuinely I realised I needed longer between the last relationship and dating and that I was at fault for not realising before I went on some dates. However last night (after about two weeks of not being in touch with him as I asked for this break and gave the reasons and he said he understood) he came at me over text for the 'silent treatment' and that it's 'not nice' and wants to talk daily again. He then went on to say his friends are asking 'where is your girlfriend?' (!!) (yes after a handful of dates and no such discussion) and that he has to tell them she's not talking to me. Furthermore, that he will wait for me until he knows where he stands. I know I have to be brave (and fair) and tell him the extras and that it's not just about stress. Aside from my own flaws here, any words of encouragement or even analysis of the situation would help. Part of me thought, yes I need the break to focus on a few things and felt my judgement was clouded which was why I said I need time away (hinting we could rekindle in the future to see if I feel differently). And I did think that I could see him more but just have that time out for a while so my judgement is better. The other part of me is saying not to compromise and go with the feelings I felt on the dates. I wondered if on the basis of what I've explained, how others would feel and act? 
One last thing (a red flag) I text my sister once and he said 'you're getting distracted' (giggling). That really put me off, thinking what the hell is that about. ",0,1752595386.0,datingoverforty,3,0.5,False

I have what I think is a ridiculous question, but hoping someone might be able to help...and I'll risk the flaming: my husband is a coffee drinker, and I prefer espresso - we both drink it black, though I put my shots over ice. We are absolutely not elite-level aficionados, not even close, but we're over the Nespresso/pods and are willing to splurge (somewhat) on a superauto. Ease of use is critical, and we're trying to stay in the $1500 range. 

I narrowed down our options, in large part with the help of the reviews on the sub, but my husband's concerned that an ""espresso machine"" won't give him the coffee he likes. He had a bad experience once at a friend's house brewing coffee with beans roasted for espresso, and was overly-wired for hours. He's worried that he'll get the short end of the stick if we buy a machine that makes better espresso than coffee. 

So: is there a bean recommendation for a superautomatic that would satisfy both of us? Or should we just limit our options to a dual-hopper superauto? (Was hoping to avoid this, as our options seem more limited or - in the case of the Jura J8 Twin - way out of our price range.)

Honest Review Inside!,"Testing the Ninja PB051 Single-Serve Coffee Maker, I found myself deep in the world of morning brews, frothy milk, and endless customization. As someone who enjoys the ritual of coffee, I was genuinely excited to try this compact yet feature-packed coffee maker. Offering compatibility with both coffee pods and your favorite ground coffee, it promised flexibility I hadn’t come across in many other single-serve brewers. My home typically gets busy in the mornings, and this gadget seemed perfect for that chaos. Its tagline may advertise convenience, but did it deliver on quality and tech-savvy design?

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker’s sleek black design adds a touch of sophistication without taking up too much countertop space. It’s compact enough to fit snugly into my small kitchen, sharing space with a messy corner of spice jars. One thing I appreciated was the integrated storage drawer for the brew basket or permanent filter when not in use—finally, a solution to my drawer clutter! Despite being lightweight at 8.6 pounds, it feels sturdy and is easy to move around. The interface consists of simple buttons, making it user-friendly, even for someone who occasionally forgets how gadgets work pre-coffee.

**Features I Loved**  
The versatility truly impressed me. With the ability to brew using both grounds and pods, it’s like having two coffee machines in one. I tested all the brew options: Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty. Classic brought me a clean morning pick-me-up, while Rich had fuller flavors that reminded me of what I’d expect from a café. Over Ice made a surprisingly smooth cold brew without tasting watered down. The Specialty brew is where I had the most fun; mixing it with steamed milk from the built-in frother, I whipped up cappuccinos and macchiatos that left my friends in awe.  

[Check Ninja PB051 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c25y15tl/)

**Performance: Does It Live up to the Hype?**  
This machine is not just about options; it feels like it really tries to perfect the brewing process. Using Thermal Flavor Extraction DUO, the coffee grounds or pods are evenly saturated, and the temperature is controlled precisely. This led to consistent flavor whether I brewed a six-ounce cup for myself or a larger 24-ounce mug for my caffeine-loving partner. We’re both picky about coffee, and somehow it worked for both of us—something I can’t say about many machines. The removable 56-ounce water reservoir was another win, letting me brew multiple cups before worrying about a refill.  

**Who Should Buy It**  
If you’re someone who likes customizing your coffee to suit your mood, this model feels like a perfect fit. It’s especially beneficial if you share the household with people who have different coffee preferences. Working professionals, college students, or even parents looking to make coffee on the go will appreciate how fast and versatile this machine is. The device even accommodates travel mugs up to 8 inches tall, a small but worthwhile detail for commuters.

**Positives**  
- Brew versatility: Compatible with both pods and grounds.  
- Multiple brew sizes: Allows cups ranging from 6 ounces to a travel-friendly 24 ounces.  
- Built-in frother: Great for enhancing drinks with hot or cold milk froth.  
- Compact design: Fits into most kitchens without crowding the space.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Some users reported difficulty with cleaning the removable frother after extensive use.  
- The machine can be a bit noisy during operation.  
- The lightweight build, while convenient, doesn’t feel as premium as some higher-end models.  

**Direct Competitors**  
Taking a look at comparable single-serve machines, the Keurig K-Elite and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew both come to mind. While the Keurig offers a similar range of brew sizes, it lacks the built-in frother. The Hamilton Beach FlexBrew shares the compatibility with grounds and pods but feels bulkier and less sleek in design. What sets the Ninja model apart is how it brings versatility and compactness together, marrying functionality with style.

**Value for Money**  
Given all the features, it’s hard not to see the value this machine provides. You’re essentially getting a dual-purpose brewer with a quasi-barista element at a mid-range price. Products offering similar features tend to cost significantly more, especially when specialty drink options enter the equation. If you’re on the hunt for quality coffee without breaking the bank, this machine provides excellent bang for the buck.

Then she informed me she'd be late, and I ended up being late too. We had agreed on 16:00, but I arrived at 16:30. She was waiting outside the café.

We sat outside, and she started with, ""How are you doing?"" I shared a bit about my recent short trip to how things had been there and what I experienced. We chatted for a bit, and then I mentioned that I was supposed to go to Country for a presentation. I told her how sad I felt about losing that opportunity.

I think I then asked her about her project. She talked about it and mentioned she was going to another town to show the prototype. She also asked about my studies and when I’m graduating. I asked her the same, and she said she has one year left. She shared some stories from her high school days too.

After some time, we moved inside. I took a while to finish my muffin, and then I asked if she’d like to go for a stroll. The idea was to check out some stores to get a sense of her taste, but the shops were closed. She said maybe a short walk would be nice, so we roamed around and talked a bit about the summer festival. I hadn’t asked her if she was staying for the festival, but she said I should check out other places too and shared her plans to visit there.

Later, I asked her about the objects and surroundings and the trip that she had mentioned earlier. She told me a bit about it, including the sweets. She was generally curious about things around us objects, surroundings, and we used those as conversation starters.

The short stroll turned into a 25-minute walk back home. I complimented her hair and asked what her original hair color was. As we got close to home, I said, “It feels great to talk in person rather than texting. You can actually feel what the other person is thinking.”

The Coffee went well. I got to know more about her. We didn’t laugh a lot just occasionally but it was a nice time.

During the stroll, I didn’t maintain much eye contact. Occasionally, I looked away while talking, though I did look at her when she was speaking and sometimes while I was speaking too. I felt good talking with her, but I’m not sure I’m getting what I’m looking for emotionally.

At one point, I wanted to touch her hair, but it didn’t feel right to do that in the middle of the walk. If we had been sitting on a bench, maybe I would have. When we parted ways, I didn’t extend my hand for a hug either.

I’m planning to ask her to come to my graduation day. I wonder if that sounds like too much to ask or maybe not thoughtful enough. Somewhere during the walk, when she mentioned her photography freelancing, I said, “You have to be at my graduation then,” and she replied, “Of course.” So I’ll wait a week before texting her again. My graduation is in two weeks.

I’m thinking of inviting her to meet on the day and go out afterward maybe to a restaurant. But before I do that, I feel hesitant to bring up the idea again. It feels like the connection is just beginning, and I don’t want to come across as too invested too soon.

What I’m really wondering is: how can I make this feel mutual? How can we naturally grow closer and let the romantic side develop without forcing it?",1,1752595311.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False
1m0lmtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m0lmtm/step_by_step_guide_on_ending_things_with_bf/,Step by step guide on ending things with *bf*,"I want to be mature and actually end things instead of ghosting ( we have 2 mutual friends). This is the first time I'll be ending things with someone who genuinely feels the 'relationship' is working. My one other relationship the guy and I were on the same page so it was pretty simple. Please give me a step by step guide.

I'm 21F and he's 27M and we've known each other since February, started talking seriously in April. He hasn't taken me out on a real date and eventually I brought that up and always says he wishes he could be he's broke. I'm a student so I thought I understood but I go out with friends all the time on a tight budget doing activities like hiking and cafe hopping ( coffee and a sweet treat), and art galleries and museums (which are really cheap). 

Over the months my perception of him has changed and that's why I want to end things. I feel like he puts zero effort into anything. 

He's always asking me to come over to his and the 3 times I went over he did not make sure there's food for me. I snacked on some crips and the only thing he offered was wine. I told him I don't drink ( I drink socially with my girls but I didn't feel like drinking with him). Last time I went. He asked why I don't like coming over and told him I'm more comfortable at mine as I feel hungry at his.
 
I invited him over to my place once and offered him food (takeout) and  juice which in itself is weird. My past interactions with men is that they usually order food for both of us when we're just hanging out at home. I bought baking ingredients and baked with him and he took a lot of photos of the cake slices and tried to make it aesthetic to post. Not photos of us baking or anything sentimental just my bowls, table and cake.  

I started working on my goals a few months ago and I noticed how much free time he has (which is weird because he's been saying he's looking for a job). He wants to be texting throughout the day and I prefer a longer call in the evenings. I lost 10kg as I started gym in March and I want to do better in uni (failed a class last year). He said ""oh you'll leave me when you're all successful"". I laughed that off but it's been bugging me. 

He's supposedly Christian and has a thing about traditional roles and talks about ""providing"". In reality this makes it hard for me to offer to pay for certain things. I wanted to watch Sinners in theatre when it came out and I was happy to split that bill and on the day of the 'date' he cancelled. Again because of ""finances"" on his end. I still went to watch the movie, got dressed up and he asked me ""who did you go with"" and said I was stubborn.

I'm 21 and I've decided I want to go on dates if I'm dating someone. I want to be outside experiencing life. In a way I am doing that just without him.

My friends are going for out this weekend and I invited him and he said ""we'll see"". I want to travel at the end of this year even if just for a week and got a part time waitressing job to try and save up. I just don't see him coming along. 

He likes talking about marriage and children and I'm okay with not getting married. A lot of women in my life would have had better lives not being married. 

He's a nice guy and we have interesting conversations but me and him have different views on dating and life and I don't see what value we add to each other's lives. My sexual attraction to him has also dwindled over the months and whilst I won't mention that to him it's a big deal to me. And I want to end things with no confusion.

P.S we have 2 mutual friends and officially ending things gives me anxiety about social settings with our mutual friends.",0,1752595207.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

Just winding down with some coffee after working all night and readjusting to a normal schedule Might do some chores like cleaning, grad school work, a little yard maintenance. I’m a nurse, so my schedule’s a bit upside-down sometimes, but I like making time to connect.

Some things that make me happy:

* Travel! I love getting out to explore new places—whether it’s the US or Europe, hoping to get to Asia/Australia. Got any unforgettable travel stories or dream destinations? I’m all ears.
* My garden. I spend a lot of time outside with my plants—veggies, flowers, bushes—and it’s been a surprisingly grounding hobby.
* My dog’s my best bud. We go on long walks and he always manages to remind me to slow down.
* Cooking experiments! I’m not perfect in the kitchen, but I really enjoy trying new recipes. It’s all about the process (and occasionally setting off the smoke alarm).
* Staying active—mostly weight training now, but soccer’s still a favorite when I get the chance. I used to work as a personal trainer, so fitness has always been part of my life.

The café hummed with subdued chatter and the gentle clinking of ceramic cups. Outside, the horizon darkened, the wind gathered momentum, and before long, sheets of rain descended—symphonic and relentless—drumming against the windows like nature’s percussion.

Sarun sat alone, awaiting his coffee, adrift in thought. A faint vibration jolted him back—the phone trembled on the wooden table. As he answered, the fragile voice on the other end broke through the static; she was crying. The signal faltered, her words fragmented, yet the anguish in her tone pierced through the noise with harrowing clarity.

He stepped outside, desperate for a stronger connection. But as her message finally reached him in full, the ground beneath him seemed to vanish. His knees buckled against the drenched pavement, and tears welled in his eyes. A flood of memories surged, unforgiving and raw, each one steeped in regret. He cursed the choices, the silences, the missteps that had brought him to this moment.

\---

\### \*\*Five Years Earlier\*\*

It had all begun here—this café, a sanctuary of quiet corners, open books, and warm brews.

Back then, Sarun was a postgraduate law student in Ludhiana, sharing a modest apartment with his roommate, Arush. He’d carved out a personal ritual—Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays were café days, sacred moments of solitude or companionship, depending on Arush’s mood.

Books were his refuge. Within their pages, he escaped reality’s weight and wandered into lives that felt eerily familiar. Each protagonist whispered reflections of his own struggles, each plot untangled threads of his inner conflict. Reading wasn’t mere pastime—it was catharsis, a means of survival in a turbulent world.

On lonely days, literature kept him company. The characters, vivid and flawed, offered comfort in ways that even friends couldn’t. Sarun thrived on discussing narratives, dissecting themes, and seeing the world through the lens of fiction.

One evening, Arush returned home beaming—he’d earned $1,200 trading stocks. Elated, he proposed a celebration. Ever pragmatic, Sarun suggested saving the windfall. But Arush’s joy was infectious. “Just this once,” he insisted.

And so, their destination was not a pub nor a party, but the familiar warmth of their favorite café. Amid laughter, cheesy pasta, crispy nachos, and steaming coffee, the evening shimmered with simplicity—a memory etched in casual joy.

Then, \*\*she\*\* walked in.

Sarun noticed her instantly—not because she demanded attention, but because something about her simply drew it. She wore fitted jeans and a black tee beneath a white puffer jacket. Her long hair framed her delicate face, silver jhumkas danced lightly beneath her ears, and a small black bindi rested gently on her forehead. A black leather handbag sat beside her, stuffed with paperwork and purpose.

She settled at the table across from his, deep in conversation with her friends, oblivious to the way his gaze lingered.

Something about her stirred something long dormant. She reminded him of Tessa Young—a character he once adored—innocent, untainted by heartbreak or betrayal.

In that quiet instant, a shift occurred within him. Something new, something irrevocable.",1,1752595061.0,TeenIndia,0,1.0,False

(And I’m writing it all down.),"I am in the middle of the most exciting simulation project of my life. It is a 16 team, 1 universe FM save, where every club or country has deep personal ties to me and my heritage.

I’m writing everything down. I dream of one day building these squads up to take over Europe and beyond.

This save, 10 months in, has hit so many challenges and funny bones that every fm player can relate to. And I am dying to share this story to others as surprise my Fort Wayne, Indiana circle doesn’t quite find it  exhilarating coffee shop banter.

FIRST POINT.

I am currently finishing up the prologue/season intro of the story. I’m waiting to start writing volume 1 until I’ve finished the first fall to spring cycle of the save.

This is because I want all of the arcs to line up cleanly. The scaffolding built should always have a resolution or a redemption. I plan on this reading like a NARRATIVE, not a diary.

This is such a difficult save. Everything is taking longer than I thought it would. In every sense, this is a good thing. I’m nailing the actual managerial process. I could name you EVERY starting XI of all 16 sides right now. But I have to stay patient in the writing process to make this vision work the way I want it to.

SECOND POINT. I got a lot of feedback last time. Some people were really excited about the scale and creativity of the story, but others absolutely hated that I used ChatGPT to help draft and edit parts of it. I’ve taken a lot of time to think this through.

At first, I leaned on AI to save time and help keep the momentum going. But the more I played and the more I wrote, the more I realized that this project is too important to me to take any shortcuts.

From now on, I’m writing everything in my own words. My writing voice is strong enough and this story deserves my full effort and heart. It just feels right to do it this way.

FINAL POINT. I’ve been working on a really detailed prologue and season preview. It sets the stage for everything to come and lets me tell the story of football the long way. It is meant to feel like a true narrative foundation, not just a quick setup.

From here, I’m wondering how you all would want to read it. Would you prefer that I release it in smaller episodic drops as I go? Or would you rather wait for one big volume at once? I would really love to hear your opinions.

This community means a lot to me and I want to build this in a way that feels fun and engaging for everyone following along.

CLOSING POINT.

I want to take a chance to thank this community. Even for the criticism. It genuinely helps. And for the support, I appreciate you all as well.

This project means a ton to me and I want to water it together and see where it goes.

And the drama has just begun. One of these teams has made me lose 3 total nights of sleep these last couple months.

For now, it’s

1m0liw5,https://i.redd.it/7ibf70dm82df1.jpeg,"Yesterday was my 55th birthday, and I walked outside expecting maybe a card on the patio table. Instead, I found this. A full outdoor bar that my son and his three buddies built from scratch, complete with those swivel stools I have been eyeing forever.","I stood there staring at it for probably ten minutes before I could even speak. The craftsmanship is incredible. Every board perfectly aligned, the roof angled just right to catch the evening shade. They even added hooks underneath for towels and a little shelf I had not noticed at first.
Last summer, I was scrolling looking at outdoor furniture ideas for our pool area. I found this crafter who makes these gorgeous poolside bars, and I must have stared at her photos for an hour. I saved the post, shared it with my sister, even measured our deck to see if something like that would fit. But between my husband's medical bills and everything else, it was just a dream I tucked away.
Turns out my son saw me looking at those photos more than once. He remembered. For the past three months, while I thought he was just hanging out with his friends after school, they were actually meeting in our garage, planning this whole project. His buddy Jake's dad helped them source the lumber, and another friend's older brother taught them how to use the circular saw safely.
When I finally managed to say something, all I could get out was thank you before I started crying. My son just hugged me and said he wanted me to have a place to sit with my coffee every morning and watch the sunrise over the pool.
I have been making my morning coffee there every day since. The wood still smells fresh, and the whole thing feels sturdy enough to last decades.

My name is Matías — I’m originally from Uruguay but currently living in Santiago, Chile.



I recently bought my flight tickets to Toronto for January (yes, I know it’ll be freezing! ❄️😅 — but it’s the only time of the year I can travel). I usually go back to Uruguay during the summer months to visit family and friends, since I work remotely. But this time, I’ve decided to do something different.



Over the past few months, I’ve been studying English and felt it was a good opportunity to visit Canada — a country I’ve always admired but never had the chance to see in person.



Uruguay and Canada actually have some things in common: both relatively quites countries, politically progressive (historically), with big “cultural brothers” (the US and Argentina 😂), legal cannabis, and intense sports rivalries (our football is probably as emotional as your hockey 🏒).



I’ll be staying in Toronto for about 4 weeks and taking English classes (still deciding which school to choose). While I’m there, I’d love to meet people, hang out, or even have a coffee or a chat over Google Meet beforehand!



I’m 35, into photography (I have an Instagram account about travel photography), travel, local food, and getting to know different cultures. I used to write movie reviews, I currently work as a teaching assistant for journalism classes at a Chilean university, and I also work in marketing.



If anyone’s up for connecting, sharing tips, or just chatting, feel free to reach out! Would love to get to know some locals or fellow travelers before I arrive. 🙌

1m0lhos,https://www.reddit.com/r/fanedits/comments/1m0lhos/its_always_sunny_in_abbott_elementary_a_fanmade/,It's Always Sunny In Abbott Elementary — A Fanmade (Roughly) Chronological Cut,"I took a stab at piecing the non-talking head scenes of Abbott Elementary S4E9 (Volunteers) and IASIP S17E1 (The Gang F\*\*\*ks Up Abbott Elementary) into one (roughly) chronological flow of events.

Spoilers are marked throughout the post as the IASIP portion aired recently.

My DMs are closed. Email me at `raydeeux (at) protonmail (dot) com` for the fan edit.

## Statistics

- Original combined runtime (including talking heads, end credits, and studio logos) = 21:38 (Abbott) + 22:12 (IASIP) = 43:50 (total)

- Final runtime (after methodology and changes applied) = 35:45

- Time cut = 8:05

- Total size: 965.2 MB

As this fan edit merges contents from a pair of crossover episodes, the changelist gets somewhat lengthy (along with my justificiations for each change). Buckle up!

## Methodology:

- Since clocks are barely visible in both the Abbott and IASIP episodes, I had to get a little creative by using characters' outfits across both episodes to group each scene into the days it would've taken place.

- I ended up with five groups of scenes (six if you count scenes from IASIP's portion that take place after >!Mac gets his form signed!<), which *might(?)* conflict with >!Ava's ""four days of free labor"" line in IASIP's cold open!<.

  - The conflict isn't too problematic, however, as the fifth group of scenes consists only of >!Charlie's ""Move Up Day!""!< scene from Abbott's episode, and >!the Abbott Elementors recieving a new coffee machine at Paddy's Pub!<. Neither scene would qualify as >!The Gang performing ""free labor"", per se!<.

- Cuts to black that last for roughly 1 second (the video runs at 23.98 FPS, and math isn't my strong suit) indicate that a new day has begun.

  - This was done to give room for groups of scenes to breathe, as opposed to Abbott's format of cramming together scenes from different days into one long sequence (minus commercial breaks).

## General changelist (not including removals):

- There is *one* other cut to black that lasts for roughly 0.5 seconds to transition from IASIP's scene where >!The Gang has their argument about 9/11 in the cafeteria!< to the Abbott scene where >!Dee is using one of Jeanine's students to make a valentine that Dee can give to Gregory!<.

  - Dee's shared outfit in both scenes indicates that both scenes take place on the same day, but the cut to black serves to give room to breathe from a sudden shift in tone/humor between the scenes, as opposed to a direct cut.

- There are some instances where the audio levels reach 0 dB, even though the screen is not solid black.

  - This usually happens at the tail end of scenes taken from IASIP's episode, as >!some Abbott characters start speaking before the camera cuts to their talking head shot!<. I wanted to include as many frames of some scenes from IASIP's episode as possible, but never got around to adding believable filler background noise. Sue me, I guess.

- To make things a bit easier to juggle, the Abbott scenes for >!Charlie's ""learning to read"" storyline!< are now closer to each other across the entirety of this cut (compared to their placements in the original Abbott episode). This means reordering a number of Abbott scenes, as outlined in the following bullet points.

- Reordered the following Abbott scenes:

  - [JMC]: >!Jacob and Melissa fully confirm that Charlie is illiterate!<

  - [JGF]: >!Mr. Johnson and Gregory wondering why the garden is messier than it was the previous day, while Frank insists on using pelts doused in urine!<

  - [A\*M]: >!Ava gives her car keys to Mac!<

  - The original order in Abbott was [JMC], then [JGF], then [A\*M]. The new order is [A\*M], then [JGF], then [JMC].

  - Even though [JGF] and [A\*M] are still next to each other in the original Abbott episode, this pair of scenes follow the first cut to black in this cut. Putting [A\*M] as the first scene following this cut to black was meant to more easily communicate that a new day has begun.

  - [JMC] is now immediately followed by the Abbott scene where >!Jacob and Melissa taking some students to the school library and meeting up with Barbara!<.

- Swapped the order of the following Abbott scenes:

  - [MBC]: >!Melissa and Barbara teach Charlie how to read!<

  - [JDG]: >!Jeanine confronts Dee about Dee's plans to seduce Gregory!<

  - The original order in Abbott was [MBC], then [JDG]. The new order is [JDG], then [MBC].

  - [MBC] is now immediately followed by the Abbott scene where >!Jacob, Barbara, Charlie, and Melissa at the library as Charlie (tries to) read a book about birds to a group of students!<.

## Removals changelist:

=== FROM BOTH EPISODES ===

- Removed intro themes.

- Removed studio logos.

- Removed end credits.

- Removed talking heads.

  - This was done to keep the events flowing without interruptions.

  - There's two exceptions to to the ""no talking heads"" change (one from each episode, both from Ava).

  - From Abbott's episode, the exception was >!Ava commenting on how useful Mac has made himself as the week progresses!<.
  
    - This ""talking head"" never actually finishes, as >!Ava was interrupted by Mr. Johnson installing a racoon trap for the garden!< (which is important for later scenes in the cut).

  - There wasn't an immediate practical solution for cutting out the ""talking head"" portion of this scene without tampering with the integrity of the opening shots and/or dialouge. Can't win 'em all, I suppose.

  - From IASIP's episode, the exception was >!Ava revealing that the copper pipes were torn out of the bathroom!<.

    - Even though this qualifies as a talking head, I felt that including it was necessary to tie back to >!Frank's copper pipes idea!< from the post-intro scene in IASIP.

==== FROM ABBOTT ELEM ====

- Removed a shot of >!Mr. Johnson standing at the door of the teacher's lounge, looking disapprovingly towards The Gang and the Abbott Elementors!<.

  - This was done to include IASIP's pre-intro and post-intro scenes, where >!The Gang excuses themselves to the same teacher's lounge shortly after meeting the Abbott Elementors (and no one is standing at the door to the teacher's lounge in the IASIP episode)!<.

- Removed a shot of >!Jeanine smiling in response to Dee's ""genius"" compliment!<.

  - This was done to include IASIP's continuation of the scene, where >!Jeanine immediately responds back with another ""genius"" compliment for Dee, followed by Dee pulling the camera operator out of the classroom and revealing her true feelings about Jeanine!<.

- Removed the scene where >!Jeanine confronts Ava about The Gang!<.

  - This was done to use IASIP's version of this scene instead, where >!both Jeanine and Ava have slightly more exaggarated expressions in some shots!<.

  - Chronologically, it still takes place after the scene where >!Dee reveals her plans to seduce Gregory!<.

  - Aside from visual differences (see previous points), the dialouge is 1:1 the same, >!including Mac's appearance!<.

======= FROM IASIP =======

- Removed the second half of >!The Gang's argument about 9/11!<.

  - This was done to keep consistent pacing and avoid jarring cuts; see next bullet point for details.

1m0lgza,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualconlang/comments/1m0lgza/speed_lang_1_challenge/,Speed lang 1 challenge.,"So my speedlang is gotlandic. It’s an isolate spoken in Gotland but with heavy influence from Swedish, particularly in vocabulary. Let’s start with a lexicon.                                      
I- et
Kape- Coffee. 
Want- Pado
A- E
With- Ipe
Brownie-Kaddaka
Please- Tak
Can- Pana 
Now the word order is quite free but I’m going to go with SVO, we use cases to figure it out and the grammar so nominative and accusative and endings to the word while indirect objects can be emphesised using the particle ik after it in informal but polite speech. 
The case affix is -ti which is for the object is suffix and for the subject a prefix so the word is pana tiet e kapeti ipe e kaddaka ik tak. My speedlang has some history too it which makes it feel unique. Lots of basic terms like I and can and an are native whilst more technical terms, brownie, coffee and thanks to some extent have been borrowed/influenced by Swedish.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal 8 oz cup isn't just about volume; it's about a combination of materials, design, and functionality that elevates your beverage consumption.

**Material:** The composition of the cup profoundly impacts its durability, heat retention, and taste neutrality.Ceramic, renowned for its excellent heat retention and elegant aesthetic, has long been a favorite. Though,variations in ceramic quality exist,with porcelain and bone china offering superior durability and a refined finish. Double-walled glass cups, often made of borosilicate glass, provide insulation while allowing you to admire your drink. Stainless steel, a robust option, is ideal for outdoor adventures and prolonged use due to its exceptional durability and resistance to breakage. disposable options, such as paper or PLA (polylactic acid), are favored for their convenience and eco-friendly properties.

**Insulation:** Proper insulation is essential for maintaining the desired temperature of your beverage, particularly for hot drinks.

double-walled construction,available in both glass and stainless steel,creates an air gap that minimizes heat transfer,keeping your drink hotter for longer and preventing condensation on the outer surface. Vacuum insulation, commonly found in stainless steel cups, provides even greater insulation by removing air from the space between the walls, virtually eliminating heat loss or gain. Single-walled cups, while lacking insulation, are often preferred for their simplicity and lower cost, especially for beverages consumed quickly.

**Design and Ergonomics:** A well-designed cup should be agreeable to hold and aesthetically pleasing.

The handle design plays a vital role in comfort and stability. Wide, ergonomic handles provide a secure grip, while smaller, minimalist handles contribute to a sleek appearance. Textured surfaces can also improve grip, especially for insulated cups that might be slippery. The shape of the cup affects heat distribution and the way you sip your beverage. Conical shapes often enhance aroma and allow for easier stirring, while cylindrical shapes provide a more uniform drinking experience.

**Durability:** The lifespan and resilience of a cup are critical, especially for daily use.

Ceramic cups, while elegant, can be susceptible to chipping or cracking if mishandled. Porcelain and bone china offer enhanced strength and resistance to breakage compared to standard ceramic. Stainless steel cups are renowned for their exceptional durability and resistance to impact, making them ideal for outdoor activities and travel. Glass cups, especially those made of borosilicate glass, are remarkably resistant to thermal shock and shattering, providing long-lasting performance.

Key features of the best 8 oz cups in 2025 include:

* Superior material options ranging from ceramic to stainless steel.
* Advanced insulation technologies to maintain beverage temperature.* Ergonomic designs for enhanced comfort and grip.
* Robust construction for long-lasting durability.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 8 oz cup provides several practical advantages beyond simply holding your drink.**Enhanced Drinking Experience:** The right cup can significantly elevate your daily routine by improving the flavor and enjoyment of your beverages. A well-designed ceramic mug can bring warmth and comfort to your morning coffee, while a sleek glass cup can showcase the vibrant colors of a refreshing iced tea.

**Improved Temperature Control:** Insulated cups maintain the ideal temperature of your drinks for longer. This not only enhances the taste of the beverage but also reduces the need for frequent reheating or adding ice. For example, a double-walled stainless steel cup can keep your coffee hot for up to several hours, allowing you to savor every sip without worrying about it getting cold.

**Increased convenience and Portability:** Durable and lightweight 8 oz cups are perfect for on-the-go lifestyles. Stainless steel options are virtually unbreakable, making them ideal for camping, hiking, and commuting. Reusable coffee cups with lids prevent spills and allow you to enjoy your favorite beverage anywhere, reducing reliance on disposable cups and promoting sustainability.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** Opting for reusable 8 oz cups over disposable alternatives contributes to a more sustainable lifestyle. By reducing waste and minimizing the need for single-use plastics, you can play a part in protecting the environment. Switching to a reusable coffee cup, as an example, can significantly reduce your carbon footprint over time.

## FAQs Section

Addressing some common questions regarding 8 oz cups helps clarify considerations for potential buyers.

Reusable cups offer numerous advantages, foremost among them being their contribution to environmental sustainability by reducing waste.They're also often more durable,provide better insulation,and enhance the overall drinking experience. furthermore, many coffee shops offer discounts to customers who bring their own reusable cups, making them a cost-effective choice in the long run.

1m0lg1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/1m0lg1k/im_managing_16_teams_in_one_fm_save_and_writing/,I’m managing 16 teams in one FM save: And writing it all down. (An update 2 months later),"I am in the middle of the most exciting simulation project of my life. It is a 16 team, 1 universe FM save, where every club or country has deep personal ties to me and my heritage. 

I’m writing everything down. I dream of one day building these squads up to take over Europe and beyond. 

This save, 10 months in, has hit so many challenges and funny bones that every fm player can relate to. And I am dying to share this story to others as *surprise* my Fort Wayne, Indiana circle doesn’t quite find it  exhilarating coffee shop banter. 

FIRST POINT. 

I am currently finishing up the prologue/season intro of the story. I’m waiting to start writing volume 1 until I’ve finished the first fall to spring cycle of the save. 

This is because I want all of the arcs to line up cleanly. The scaffolding built should always have a resolution or a redemption. I plan on this reading like a NARRATIVE, not a diary. 

This is such a difficult save. Everything is taking longer than I thought it would. In every sense, this is a good thing. I’m nailing the actual managerial process. I could name you EVERY starting XI of all 16 sides right now. But I have to stay patient in the writing process to make this vision work the way I want it to.

SECOND POINT.
I got a lot of feedback last time. Some people were really excited about the scale and creativity of the story, but others absolutely hated that I used ChatGPT to help draft and edit parts of it.
I’ve taken a lot of time to think this through. 

At first, I leaned on AI to save time and help keep the momentum going. But the more I played and the more I wrote, the more I realized that this project is too important to me to take any shortcuts.

From now on, I’m writing everything in my own words. My writing voice is strong enough and this story deserves my full effort and heart. It just feels right to do it this way.

FINAL POINT.
I’ve been working on a really detailed prologue and season preview. It sets the stage for everything to come and lets me tell the story of football the long way. It is meant to feel like a true narrative foundation, not just a quick setup.

From here, I’m wondering how you all would want to read it. Would you prefer that I release it in smaller episodic drops as I go? Or would you rather wait for one big volume at once?
I would really love to hear your opinions. 

This community means a lot to me and I want to build this in a way that feels fun and engaging for everyone following along.

CLOSING POINT. 

I want to take a chance to thank this community. Even for the criticism. It genuinely helps. And for the support, I appreciate you all as well. 

This project means a ton to me and I want to water it together and see where it goes. 

And the drama has just begun. One of these teams has made me lose 3 total nights of sleep these last couple months. 

For now, it’s 

Nur Der HSV!
Up the Lions!
¡Vamos Los Azucereos!
Up the Shels
Forza Citadella!

1m0lfzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1m0lfzk/decafing_might_be_one_of_the_best_choices_i_took/,Decafing might be one of the best choices I took in my life,"First of all, if I make any typos here, I apologize, as English ain't my native language.

Also, I began taking coffee when I was 11, as coffee is tremedously common in Brazil, almost like a tradition. I spent 14 years of my life taking coffee almost everyday.

So, I began to decaf after my coffee intake got, kind of, out of control due to an intensive study routine. I was used to drink around 100ml per day, but then it quickly escalated to, maybe, 250 to 300ml per day. I've noticed I began to have problems to communicate, such as stuttered speech. I also notice an increase in anxiety (note that I was already taking anxiety medication for, maybe, 1 year and a half), and I felt more impulsive.

Things came to a breaking point, so I decided to try staying away from caffeine in general. Before I withdrew completely, I still took coffee for a few days, but halving the intake until 50ml/day. I kept taking 50ml for maybe a week, and then I finally cut coffee.

I went, maybe, 66 days without coffee. Those were incredible days, here is why:
- Stuttering gone;
- I felt I was having better, longer breathing patterns;
- Fewer sleep problems;
- WAY LESS impulsivity;
- Felt more calm;
- My days felt less chaotic, more organized/orderly;
- Maybe the most important element here, my anxiety levels fell to the point I decided to try not taking my anxiety medication. Believe it or not, it went well, better than I expected. I think I was able to abstain from it for around 28-35 days.

After that streak, in order to compare, I took coffee for around 14 days, 50ml/day. All the symptoms I had in the past came back. The lesson I was clear, no more coffee. I am simply a better person without it.

Never again.

Just drop a comment and I’ll send the link in 10 minutes.,"On the other end of the line, Victor Powell's father, Albert Powell, asked, ""Seri, are you sure you want to terminate the agreement and divorce Victor?""

Serena Powell held her phone calmly. ""I'm sure.""

""Even if Leon's custody goes to the Powell family, you're still leaving?""

""Yes. I believe Leon would rather stay with his dad. The Powell family can give him the best education. He doesn't need me anymore.""

Albert's voice was low. ""Alright. As for the divorce agreement, you can talk to Victor yourself.""

""Okay,"" Serena replied.

Albert didn't hang up right away. ""To be honest, I've been satisfied with how Victor's been these past few years with you around.

""So, as a reward, I'll arrange for you to join the design team in Glonia you've always wanted. In a week at most, you'll be out of the Powell family.""

Serena thought, 'A reward? Rich people really do live in a different universe. In their world, even feelings come with a price tag.'

She agreed. After she hung up, her phone screen was still frozen on a recent Instagram post from her husband, Victor.

Victor had been posting bits and pieces of his daily life for over a month now, but this was the first time Serena had seen them. He had never accepted her friend request on his private account—until now.

In the newest video, their son Leon Powell was playing happily with another kid around his age. The ironic part was, everyone in the comments thought Serena was the one who filmed it.

Someone commented: \[Your wife's really good with the camera. Your son looks so happy.\]

Victor's reply stood out like a slap: \[Yeah.\]

Serena thought, 'Yeah? Is he praising Eliza Stone, his childhood sweetheart, for her camera work, or is he just letting people assume she's his wife now?'

\*\*\*\*\*

Serena grew up in an orphanage. Seven years ago, when she was still in college, Albert suddenly approached her and offered her three million dollars—to buy seven years of her life.

To pay for surgery for the orphanage director who had been kind to her, Serena reluctantly agreed.

Back then, she had already heard the story of Victor and Eliza. Both of them came from powerful families, grew up together as childhood sweethearts, and were deeply in love. But the year they graduated college, Eliza suddenly vanished without a trace.

When Victor found out Eliza had gone abroad for an arranged marriage, he completely lost it. He started drinking, smoking, and pushing himself to the edge, spiraling into serious psychological issues.

The psychiatrist once said only emotional healing could cure a wounded heart.

To save his nearly deranged son, Albert found Serena, who looked strikingly similar to Eliza, and had her care for Victor to heal his emotional wounds.

From then on, Serena began to get close to Victor on purpose, relentlessly pursuing him. She had that rare mix of innocence and allure. And with a face that looked just enough like Eliza's, she made sure to stay in Victor's sight every single day.

When he was down, she would cheer him up. When he got sick, she stayed up all night to look after him. And when his depression hit, she was the only one who ever reached into the darkness and pulled him back.

With time, Victor gradually got used to having Serena around.

Until one day, Serena caught him in the middle of a breakdown, about to slit his wrists. She grabbed the sharp blade with her bare hand and forced it out of his grip.

Her hand was sliced open, the cut deep and long, bleeding uncontrollably. The doctor said if it'd gone any deeper, she would've lost the use of her hand. Because the wound was so severe, even after it healed, a jagged scar remained across her palm.

That was the first time Victor hugged her. ""Seri, let's get married. Okay? Let's go to city hall tomorrow,"" he said.

Serena stood frozen, thinking it was her sincerity that had moved him. But later, when she found Eliza's wedding invitation tucked in a drawer, she realized it had all happened on Eliza's wedding day.

Less than two years after they got married, Serena gave birth to Leon. During those two years, Victor wasn't particularly affectionate, but he treated her with respect. Also, Leon was very close to her—he clung to her more than he did to Victor.

Serena had feelings, after all. She had already come to see this place as her home. She loved both Victor and Leon deeply. It wasn't about the black-and-white contract anymore. She truly wanted to be with them for the rest of her life.

So for the sake of her family, Serena gave up her dream of being an accomplished designer and became a full-time housewife.

During the day, she cleaned the house. At noon, she brought lunch to Victor. In the evening, after picking Leon up, she cooked dinner for him. At night, she still had to meet Victor's needs in bed.

She was like a machine that never stopped working year-round, quietly and tirelessly taking care of her husband and son for five straight years.

Serena used to think things would just continue like that. But a month ago, Eliza came back. She was divorced and brought her son with her.

When Victor found out, he rushed to the airport without an umbrella, ignoring the heavy rain. He could even forgive everything Eliza had done in the past, as if none of it mattered anymore.

He thought Serena didn't know. But she knew everything. Over the past week, Victor had grown more and more impatient with her. He started treating her like a servant, barking orders at her. Even Leon had become cold and harsh toward her.

Serena had argued with them and fought back, but they called her ungrateful and narrow-minded. Then, in the next moment, they gave all their tenderness to Eliza.

Serena only found out about this through Instagram. Ironically, Victor never posted on Instagram. Even back when they got married, he refused to let her announce it on the app, saying it was their private life and he didn't want outsiders to know.

But ever since Eliza came back, Victor's Instagram had been full of pictures of the four of them—him, Leon, Eliza, and her son. They all looked so warm and loving, as if they were the real family.

That was how Serena learned that when she was sick, Victor and Leon were out shopping with Eliza. When she was heartbroken, Victor and Leon were celebrating Eliza's birthday.

Even yesterday, on their wedding anniversary, Victor and Leon ignored the dinner Serena had spent the whole day preparing and walked out the door—just to be with Eliza. When Serena tried to stop them, they told her she was being dramatic.

Serena thought, 'I should've realized it a long time ago. There's no place for me in this family anymore. I actually believed I could move beyond that contract and stay with them forever—I was being delusional. It's time to wake up and leave.'

She took a deep breath and wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes with a cold hand.

Just then, the sound of the front door opening came from outside. Victor and Leon were back, the chill of the wind and rain still clinging to them as they came in.

""Seri, Leon fell and got hurt. Take care of his wound,"" Victor said, his voice low and steady, calm as always, automatically slipping into that usual commanding tone.

""I don't want her to do it. She never shuts up and nags the whole time."" Leon's brows were furrowed tightly, his face full of annoyance. ""I want Eliza to do it. I want to call Eliza.""

""The weather's too bad. Eliza can't make it,"" Victor answered, stepping inside indifferently, his voice flat. ""Be good. Let your mom handle it.""

""Okay, fine."" Leon looked disappointed and reluctant, his head drooping as he slumped onto the couch.

When he looked up and saw Serena still hadn't brought the first-aid kit over and was actually turning to walk away like she hadn't even heard them, his temper exploded. He shouted impatiently, ""Can you hurry up? What's with you today? So slow and annoying.""

# Chapter 2 Out Of Character

Serena turned to look at Leon, her eyes filled with coldness. ""That's how you talk to your own mother?"" she questioned.

Leon was startled by her reaction, completely thrown off. This was the first time Serena had ever spoken to him like that.

Even Victor paused and looked over, a trace of surprise in his eyes.

Leon shouted, ""What's your problem? You're the one who's standing there doing nothing. If it weren't raining and Eliza couldn't come, I wouldn't even need you—""

Serena cut in, ""Fine. Since you adore Eliza so much, then wait for her to take care of it.""

Leon froze, staring at Serena in disbelief as she walked away.

In the past, whenever he got hurt, Serena would panic, fuss over him, hug him, comfort him—but today was completely different. She just left.

Victor was a little surprised too, but didn't think much of it. He frowned at Leon and said, ""Leon, you need to learn how to handle difficulties in life without letting your emotions get the best of you.""

\*\*\*\*\*

In the bathroom, Serena stared blankly at the toiletries on the sink.

For the past few years, neither Victor nor Leon had ever had to squeeze their own toothpaste. She always got up a few minutes earlier to adjust the water temperature just right and lay out all their toiletries ahead of time.

She still remembered one time when the water had been too hot, and Victor snapped at her, ""Can't you even get something this simple right?""

Serena looked away. After taking off her clothes, she turned on the shower and let the hot water pour down on her, as if it could wake her up, again and again.

After a long time, she finally turned off the water. The look in her eyes grew more and more resolute. From now on, her life would no longer revolve around her ungrateful husband and son. She was going to live for herself.

When she came out of the bathroom, Leon was in his room. Victor was sitting on the couch, watching that ""family"" video on his phone. The corners of his mouth lifted without him even realizing, a clear sign of how pleased he was.

Serena let out a mocking laugh and walked over to the drawer. She then pulled out the divorce agreement and walked toward Victor. ""Victor, let's get divorced.""

Victor kept his eyes on the video playing on his phone and mumbled, ""Okay.""

Serena placed the divorce papers on the table. ""I'll walk away with nothing. You can have full custody of Leon too.""

Victor was still staring at his phone, seemingly absorbed in the comments under that Instagram post.

""If you don't have any objections, just sign it,"" Serena said.

""Okay."" Victor took the pen Serena handed him. He paused for a second, just as a notification popped up on his phone. Without even glancing at the agreement, he signed his name on the agreement.

Serena asked, ""Victor, did you even hear what I just said to you?""

""What?"" Victor shot her an impatient look, tossed the pen on the table, and leaned back on the couch. ""Isn't it about buying insurance for Leon? Just buy it.""

Serena realized he really hadn't heard a word. All his attention was on his phone. Ever since Eliza came back, she had gotten used to him being like this.

Just then, Victor's phone started ringing. It was a call from Eliza. He quickly turned around and stepped out onto the balcony to answer it.

Serena looked at the signed divorce papers on the table and let out a cold snort.

All it would've taken was one glance—he would've seen it had nothing to do with insurance. But he didn't. His mind was filled with nothing but Eliza. He couldn't see anything else.

Serena put the divorce papers away and went back to the bedroom to pack her things.

Just then, the doorbell rang. When Serena opened the door, she was met with a delicate, innocent-looking face. Her heart skipped a beat in her chest.

It was Eliza. Even though Serena had only seen her profile in Victor's Instagram posts, she recognized Eliza instantly.

""You must be Mrs. Powell, right? Sorry to bother you this late,"" Eliza said. Standing next to her was her son, Oliver Stone, each of them holding a suitcase—one big, one small.

Serena remarked flatly, ""What do you need?""

""Is Victor home?"" Eliza asked.

""Yeah."" Almost the second he heard Eliza's voice, Victor rushed out from inside. ""I told you I'd pick you up. Why'd you come on your own? Come on in before you catch a cold.""

Eliza let out a dry laugh and didn't come in right away. Her eyes landed on Serena as she spoke, ""Mrs. Powell, I'm having some property issues back in the country, so I'll need to stay here for a few days.""

Serena smiled and thought, 'Stay here? Out of everywhere else, she has to move into her ex-boyfriend's house when he's already married? What is this supposed to be, taking over my place already? Making herself at home?'

Before Serena could say anything, Leon came running out of the house, cheering happily. ""Eliza, Ollie, you're finally here,"" he giggled.

He pushed past Serena, excitedly trying to welcome Eliza and Oliver inside.

Eliza greeted Leon but still didn't come in. She kept looking at Serena and asked cautiously, ""Mrs. Powell, I'm really sorry. I don't have many friends back home, so I had no choice but to turn to Victor. You don't mind, do you?""

Serena sneered, ""And if I do mind? Does that mean you're not coming in?""

Eliza clearly hadn't expected Serena to say that. Eliza froze, and before she could say anything, a young voice cut in ahead of her.

""What's your problem?"" Leon immediately stepped in front of Eliza to shield her. ""It doesn't matter if you mind. This is Dad's house.""

Eliza's expression changed. ""Leon, you can't talk to your mom like that. Your dad and your mom are married. That makes this her home too. She's the one who raised you. It hasn't been easy for her, and you should try to understand her.""

""Okay."" Leon lowered his head. Normally, he'd argue back for every word Serena said. But now, because of Eliza's words, he suddenly quieted down. ""I got it.""

Victor went ahead and picked up Eliza's luggage without waiting for Serena's response. ""Come in,"" he remarked.

Eliza looked at Serena apologetically and kept saying, ""Thank you.""

Serena just stood there quietly, watching them. Compared to the rest of them, she felt like she was the outsider here.

Serena scoffed a cold laugh in her heart. She wanted to go back to her room and pack her things, but Leon suddenly stopped her, saying, ""Where are you going? Hurry up and make dinner. Ollie and Eliza probably haven't eaten yet.""

""No, it's fine,"" Eliza said softly, trying to remind him. ""Leon, that's not appropriate.""

""No need. I'll cook today."" Victor was in a good mood and got up from the couch.

Eliza quickly grabbed his arm, then immediately pulled her hand back with a clear sense of boundaries. ""Don't trouble yourself. You guys just go on with what you were doing. I already ate before I came.""

Serena felt nothing but sarcasm inside. She'd known Victor for years. She could count on one hand how many times he'd stepped foot in the kitchen, let alone cooked.

She had always thought Victor simply didn't know how. But now it seemed he just didn't think Serena was worth the effort.

""All right, then I'll help you carry your suitcases to your room,"" Victor said. Since Eliza really didn't want to eat, he didn't insist. His eyes swept toward the bedrooms upstairs, and a trace of hesitation flickered in the depths of his gaze.

There were four bedrooms in the house. One belonged to Leon, one had been turned into a storage room, and the remaining two were his and Serena's.

A year ago, Victor had already suggested that he and Serena sleep in separate rooms.

# Chapter 3 Letting Go

That was why there wasn't any room in this house for Eliza at all.

Just then, Leon suddenly waved his little hand. ""Dad, let Eliza have Mom's room. It's big and bright—perfect for Eliza and Ollie.""

Victor paused for a second.

Eliza immediately caught the subtle shift in his expression and rushed to speak before he could say anything, ""No, that's not okay. If there's really no space, I'll take Oliver and find somewhere else to stay. I'm so sorry for bothering you.""

""It's no bother,"" Leon said, suddenly pouting. He turned his head and looked at Serena with urgency and grievance, raising his voice. ""Say something. What, you lost your voice today?""

Serena looked into Leon's eyes, full of blame. ""If Eliza takes my room, then where am I supposed to sleep?"" she questioned.

Leon puffed out his cheeks, clearly indifferent, his face turning red as he shouted like it was the most obvious thing in the world, ""The storage room has a bed. Just sleep there.

""You should be glad you even have a place to stay. Why are you being so picky?""

Hearing that, Eliza looked troubled. She stepped forward slightly, her eyes full of sincerity and apology.

She looked at Leon as she spoke gently, ""Leon, I'm a guest. Your mom is the host. How could I take the host's room? I'm already thankful she's letting me stay here. Oliver and I aren't going to be picky.""

Eliza turned to look at Oliver, who had been quiet the whole time. ""Right, Oliver?""

Oliver gave a calm nod.

""Well, Ms. Stone, you really know your place,"" Serena replied evenly, going along with her. ""So you all can figure out another plan for the room.""

Serena had swallowed her pride for years. She wasn't going to back down anymore.

Hearing that, Leon was furious. ""You're such a wretch. I knew you didn't really want Eliza to stay. You're so annoying.""

He put his little fists on his hips. ""But don't even think about kicking Eliza out. I'll just sleep with Dad, and Eliza and Ollie can have my room.""

Victor's eyes lit up. ""That works. It's settled then.""

Leon happily pushed the suitcases toward the elevator, and Victor led Eliza and Oliver to Leon's room.

Once again, Serena was the extra one. She was used to it. She went back to her room and started packing.

Not long after, Eliza came in with a cup of hot coffee in her hands. ""Mrs. Powell, may I come in? Are you packing for something? Going out?""

Serena didn't respond. She couldn't exactly tell Eliza she was leaving.

Eliza said, ""Leon poured this coffee for you. He may be little, but he's got a lot of pride. He was too embarrassed to bring it in himself.""

Serena didn't believe for a second that Leon had poured that coffee for her.

If Eliza hadn't shown up, maybe Serena would've believed it. But the Leon now hated Serena too much to even get her a cup of coffee.

Serena said, ""Ms. Stone, you don't need to smooth things over between me and Leon. The four of you living happily ever after is better than anything else.""

Even though Eliza had played innocent ever since she walked in—and had even stepped in a few times to help correct Leon—Serena didn't believe that was her true colors. Serena's instincts told her Eliza was far from simple.

Eliza bit her lip, looking guilty. ""Mrs. Powell, did I do something to make you misunderstand me?""

She walked over to Serena anxiously. Seeing Serena folding clothes, Eliza quickly reached out and grabbed her hand.

Eliza said, ""Mrs. Powell, if you don't want me to stay, just say it. I can leave. But please don't get the wrong idea about me. I never meant to sabotage your relationship with your family. I really didn't—""

Serena cut in coldly, ""Let go.""

""I'm begging you, please don't misunderstand me, okay? I'll leave, alright?""

""I said let go.""

Serena had no idea what Eliza was trying to do. Seeing her stubbornly clinging on, Serena yanked her wrist free.

Before Serena could say anything, Eliza, who had been standing just fine, suddenly fell. The hot coffee in her hand spilled onto Serena's skin, instantly turning a large area red.

""Ow!"" Eliza's sharp cry pierced the air.

""What happened?"" Leon and Victor rushed over the moment they heard the noise. The moment they saw the scene in front of them, their expressions suddenly changed.

Victor rushed forward, his eyes tinged red with panic. ""Ellie, are you okay? Are you hurt?""

Eliza raised her hand pitifully. Her delicate skin was now marked with a small red burn. ""Victor, it's my fault. I shouldn't have come today. I upset Mrs. Powell. Please don't blame her.""

Victor turned to glare at Serena, his eyes filled with anger. ""Why did you do this? Ellie's just here to stay for a couple days.

""It was already bad enough how you kept giving her a hard time, but now you actually laid hands on her?""

Instantly blamed for something she didn't do, Serena was shaking with rage, knowing full well she'd just been set up. But her mind went blank. She blurted out the truth, ""She fell on purpose.""

Serena had thought Victor still had some ability to tell right from wrong. But not only did he lack that now, his face darkened even more.

He yelled, ""Serena. How can you be so cruel? Why would Ellie fall on her own for no reason? You did it, just admit it. You've really let me down.""

He scooped Eliza into his arms and rushed to the living room to apply medicine to her burn.

Even Leon pointed at Serena's face and cursed her out, screaming, ""You're such a wretch. I hate you. You're evil and disgusting. You don't deserve to be my mom. Just die already. Stop ruining things between Dad and Eliza.""

Serena shoved him away, her breathing heavy. ""Leon Powell, you little brat, say that again.""

Leon lost his balance and fell to the floor, tears welling up in his eyes. ""You wretch, I don't love you anymore. I hate you."" With that, he took off running.

Serena's fingers trembled. It was the first time she had ever spoken harshly to Leon, but she didn't regret it. She took it as her last lesson to him as his mother.

Just then, a dull pain throbbed on the back of her hand. Serena lowered her eyes and looked at the large burn across it, then laughed.

Eliza had only gotten a few drops on her and Victor was already that worked up. But Serena was hurt far worse, and no one cared.

Serena's throat moved with a deep swallow as she walked alone to the bathroom to run cold water over her hand.

The water was colder than usual, and the twisted, jagged scar in her palm seemed even more noticeable now.

Outside, she heard Leon's cheerful voice. ""Yay. We're going out to eat. Daddy's the best. Ellie's the best too. I wish every day could be like this,"" he laughed.

""Victor, are you sure Mrs. Powell won't be upset we're not taking her?"" Eliza asked.

Victor said, ""She won't be. And even if she is, she'll get over it by the time we're back.""

Serena turned the faucet up to full blast, drowning out their voices from the living room.

After a long while, she suddenly shut off the water with a loud clack and walked straight into the bedroom, her steps firm and unwavering.

Serena thought, 'I'll get over it? No, Victor. You're never going to see me again. I'll let you guys be together.'

# Chapter 4 Misunderstood

""Today was so much fun. Eliza, I want to go again tomorrow,"" Leon said excitedly, tugging Eliza's hand as they walked into the living room.

Eliza reached out to pat Leon's head, her smile bright. ""Of course, Leon. If there's something you want to do, I'll definitely take you. But everything I let you eat today was just the kind of stuff Oliver eats all the time. Nothing special.""

Leon pouted and started complaining, ""My mom never lets me eat those things. Eliza, you don't even know how jealous I am of the other kids. Their moms are way better than her.""

Serena had just come out of the bathroom and heard the entire conversation. She walked down from the second floor, and the moment she looked up, she saw the ketchup still smeared on the corner of Leon's mouth.

Serena asked sharply, ""If you knew I don't let you eat that stuff, why did you still eat it?""

Leon looked up at the sound of her voice. The moment he saw Serena, his face turned sour.

Eliza spoke up, sounding apologetic, ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Powell. I didn't know you don't usually let Leon eat that kind of stuff. But it's really no big deal once in a while. Oliver eats it too.""

Serena snorted, ""Fast food is junk—loaded with fat and salt. It causes weight gain. Leon has a sensitive stomach. What makes you think it's no big deal? Or do you just assume everyone's like you people?""

Eliza's expression stiffened slightly.

Leon shot back, ""I've never eaten fast food before. It's just this once because Eliza brought me along. If you want to blame someone, blame me. Don't take it out on her.""

Leon's automatic defense of Eliza made Serena feel bitterly ironic. After everything Serena had done to take care of him, all it took was one fast food meal from Eliza to win him over.

Eliza explained patiently, ""Mrs. Powell, I understand how you feel as a mom. I'm a mom too. It's normal that kids like fast food. It's not like they eat it all the time.

""Plus, Leon is fine right now. I just think maybe sometimes you don't need to be so strict with him.""

Serena sneered, ""Really? And if something did happen, would you take responsibility?""",2,1752594638.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1m0ldr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1m0ldr2/rollercoaster_over_the_last_couple_months_letting/,Rollercoaster over the last couple months (letting it off my chest),"When everyone was dating back when I was in school/university, I was still in the phase where I would never consider dating a guy openly and was quite certain that I'd just keep the fact I'm gay to myself till I die. I never really felt ""butterflies"" when seeing someone, wasn't sure what the feeling of ""love"" is and thought I would never experience it, even tried to accept it. But eventually it did start to weigh on me. I was lonely and isolating myself from everyone, becoming just more and more miserable every day for months. At some point I couldn't bear it anymore and decided that either I at least give it a try or I won't survive till the end of the year.

I don't know how it happened, but everything happened very fast. I set up a Tinder account and tried talking to some guys but was mostly ghosted, even though we matched, but there was one guy that I actually chatted with for a while. Within a couple days we moved to voice calls and played some games together. A week after first talking to him he suggested we meet and I agreed, even though I was 99% sure I'd probably message him a day before or on the day of the meeting that I can't go - it wasn't anything about him, I was just this scared of seeing a guy on a date in public. 

I didn't cancel though and an hour before the date I just thought to myself - canceling now would be a dick move, he might have already left. I arrived at the place a couple minutes early and just stood there paralyzed. I was torn, I was terrified as he'd be the first person to know I'm gay that'd see me in person, on the other hand I just hated the fact that I'd stand him up last minute. And then it was too late - I saw him in the crowd, he saw me.

He wanted to greet me with a hug and I didn't really know what to do. There were probably a hundred people around us, as we met on the street in the city centre and I was terrified of all the people around judging me. On the other hand, I don't know, something in me was telling me it'd be deeply unfair to see someone and force them to hide who they are just because I'm scared. So I hugged him back, nothing happened and it felt like it helped me get over this first fear.

We went to grab a coffee together, entered some quiet place and it triggered another wave of panic in me - this time we weren't in a crowd where no one would notice us. The first ""punch"" was soon after we entered. He ordered his drink at the counter and went to grab us a free table, I was the second to order and the girl working there just looked at me and asked in a voice indicating some kind of disgust or something ""you two together?"". I was already stressed af so didn't say much, just nodded, said ""yeah"" and followed my date to the table.

Tl;dr of the events that followed - we talked for the entire evening, later at night I invited him to my place where we kissed (in my case - for the first time) and cuddled for a couple hours. For a week or so I couldn't stop thinking about him.

It's been a couple months since then and I'm still seeing him. He's the first person that ever made me feel safe with who I am. The thing is we're seeing AT BEST once a week and I just reallllly need to see him more... but when I try to invite him somewhere more often, he'll usually decline, justifying it with being busy.

The thing is, I care about him so much, and don't want to be ""too much"" by pushing him to see me more. I'm scared that if I do and he's not ready it'll just fall apart. I don't want you to see him as some ""bad guy"" who doesn't care or something, he's been the most open person I've ever met, there wasn't ever a thing that he'd been hiding or lying (AFAIK), and he's never given me a reason not to believe him.

I feel like I need to have some of these conversations, but I'm just so scared to lose him, and at the same time... when I try to prepare myself mentally for what might happen if I do lose him, I just don't really think I'd want to date anyone. But I don't want to be alone again.

I hate myself for the fact that I keep having these thoughts of ""okay, what do I do when we're not together"", while still seeing him... it feels wrong to me, cause we ARE seeing each other and I would absolutely love for it to continue and it feels almost as if I was cheating on him.

Honestly, I don't know what I'm expecting, maybe I just needed to let it off my chest. I feel kinda hopeless, stuck in ""this is not enough for me, but I'm too scared to ask for more"".",0,1752594629.0,gaybros,0,0.5,False

Ronan drained his glass, each word deliberate: ""I will never regret it.""  
  
  
That one sentence—“I will never regret it”—tore apart the last of my illusions like sharp claws.  
  
  
Tomorrow was New Year's Eve. The streets buzzed with celebration.  
  
  
Just this morning, Ronan had fucked me senseless, his teeth at my throat, saying how much he loved me.  
  
  
Now every word felt like a blade cutting me open.  
  
  
I collapsed on a park bench, tears streaming down my face.  
  
  
All those buried memories came flooding back.  
  
  
Mira loved my ex mate Evan desperately. The day he and I got engaged, she couldn't handle it—left a suicide note and jumped into the river.  
  
  
Even though Mira was a strong swimmer and my father's bastard daughter, my mother still dove in to save her.  
  
  
So many people filmed it. I watched my mother lift Mira toward the surface, only for Mira to press down on her shoulders, use her feet to push my mother's head underwater.  
  
  
That's how my mother drowned.  
  
  
When I arrived, Mira cried pitifully: ""I just lost my head for a moment, sis. Please don't blame me. When mom saved me, she must have wanted me to live well...""  
  
  
I broke down, demanding to know why she'd pushed my mother underwater when she could swim perfectly well. She just kept crying, insisting it wasn't intentional.  
  
  
I sued her for murder.  
  
  
But the next day, there was a knock at my door.  
  
  
I opened it, eyes red, barely dry from crying.  
  
  
“Evan ?” I asked, caught off guard by his sudden visit. “Are you here for my mother’s funeral?”  
  
  
He stood outside, cold and distant, his voice like a blade:  
  
  
“No,” he said, standing at the threshold. “Listen carefully. I, Evan Locke, Alpha of the Locke Pack, reject you, Lyra Hale, to be my mate and future Luna.”  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
“What?” I froze, struck as if by lightning, unable to move. “What are you doing?”  
  
  
“Accept it.” He ignored my question, “Take my rejection.”  
  
  
Evan’s voice was cold, without a trace of hesitation or mercy. The eyes that once gazed at me so tenderly were now colder than Arctic snow.  
  
  
“NOW.”  
  
  
A chill swept over me. Suppressed by his Alpha bloodline, I could only obey. “I accept your rejection.”  
  
  
The moment the mate bond snapped, my wolf let out a sorrowful howl—as if her soul had been torn apart.  
  
  
I thought my tears had long dried up, yet they slid down silently once more.  
  
  
“Why?” My voice came out hoarse.  
  
  
Evan lowered his eyes, his tone still as cold and cutting as ice: “I won’t allow you to harm Mira.”

He didn’t just break off our engagement. Before the eyes of the entire pack, he sealed the mate bond with Mira. That day, the whole pack celebrated their union, while I was cast out, becoming the laughingstock of the pack.  
  
  
Then the pack erupted with rumors—that I was using my mother's death for sympathy, for attention, for power.  
  
  
They called me jealous, said that's why my mate rejected me.  
  
  
The pressure nearly suffocated me. I had a complete breakdown and developed severe depression.  
  
  
But I never gave up seeking justice for my mother.  
  
  
My mother cared for me, protected me for twenty-three years. How could I abandon her?

Flash forward to about 3 months after I moved out of the city, I start getting all these fake 'Tim Hortons' emails telling me I'm winning prizes and I need to click links to win them or claim them, doesn't share what campaign its apart of, no policies or terms and conditions, just straight photos with all caps. This was not the same incident as the boat winners in Quebec, this is more sketchy than that. I receive emails daily, and I also frequently get logged out of the app. I have changed banks since this happened, and I am very cautious about clicking links and photos in emails.

He said he loved the feeling of playing a grand piano at the local and provincial festivals then we started to think the upright he's using now may have limited his ability to play and enjoy.  And we have been looking around local marketplace for a grand piano for him. 

There happens to have a kawai kg-5c for sale at a local church. This piano has been sitting in their community hall for years as the church has been using electric keyboard since a few years ago.  By looking up the serial number it's manufactured in Japan in 1971. There is a broken string. Some cosmetic damage (an obvious bigger chip, dull color, coffee stain). We don't know piano but my son said the sound and feel is OK (it's out of tune for sure). There is likely no obvous construction defects, so $5k still sounds like a good deal for a semi concert grand.

We wanted to get a known technician to make further inspection but it's getting hard to get a hold of the person posting the ad after our first visit. He doesn't response to message after a day.  I feel like there maybe many inqueires about the piano and he's quite busy.  

  
We are going out of the country for a summer vacation trip very soon. What's your opinion to take a bit of risk and just to give him $5k cheque to buy it now and move it back home after our trip?

We asked our son if he wants this grand piano and he hesitates. It's more of our parent's idea to give him an upgrade. He's only 13 years old and he loves classical music. He's quite good too at about BC provincial level.

1m0l2mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1m0l2mq/i_came_i_saw_i_conquered_a_human_quote/,"""I came, I saw, I conquered.""- A human quote.","“I’m tired,” I mutter to myself on the cold, concrete floor of the shooting grounds. I'm spitting out bloody saliva. I try to get up past my executed colleagues. No, friends. Colleges don’t die for each other. They don’t share your last can of corn beef, or a blanket, or… The shooting squad missed me by the throat. Their bullets shattered my pacemaker, but I’m alive.

 

Yet the cold winds blow past Notre-Dame’s corners, turns, spires, buttresses, and domes. “The Gandra. They did this. The scourge. They burnt Terra in half with their methane, green fires. Their damned black scales, yellow eyes, fangs! I’ll kill them, pay them back 19-fold. They blended our children, ground our bones-” I stopped myself from spiraling. I-I needed to be grateful, for the chance that probability has bestowed me. To avenge everyone.

 

“I am alone.” I really am alone. I begin dragging myself past the arms of a French couple I knew in the trenches. Now dismantled in shapes I could not name. Then I look up to the piercing red sky, a permanent day that illuminates the whole world, even the supposed night side of Earth. And I let out a sob. Then another. Tears roll down my cheeks, wetting and glistening them. Then I cut myself off again. Using the saltwater to wipe my wounds.

 

I’ll kill them. “I’ll put them down like savages, they should’ve died in whatever hell hole they call home. If not for my broken collarbone, ribs, my cat, my family, Tom!…My…my…” I stand up, walking to an abandoned rifle on the splattered floor. A mosaic of still swirling crimson, that I wouldn’t dare dishevel with my pitied state.

 

And I take a deep breath of whatever oxygen’s left, that my lungs can rasp. “Vengeance.” That beautiful word was in my mind, siring itself like a brand on the very gray matter. I needed it. “I’ll rally everyone on Mars, beat them out of our systems and siege all of their 14 ‘homeworlds’. Make sure they regret ever trying to farm us as cattle.” I walk through the long passage ahead of me, with the rifle tucked between my arms. That was a promise.

 

All with my pain-addled gait and determination. I really was alone here. The Gandra were efficient. Whatever they shot was dead without question. That certainty meant they never lingered long. I raise the cylindrical barrel of my gun, now stepping outside past the gray arches of the building. But it’s my olfactory that’s held hostage by the stench of rotting meat wafting from the streets. Human. Not Gandra.

 

And outside, there was nothing but mince. Out on the streets, on the buildings, even in the damn sky for Christ's sake. The next second, I slump to my knees. I want to cry, but I can’t, I don’t have any more to spare. This…this place was filled with banter just hours ago. War cries, industry, resistance. All now nothing but anomalies in the dead silence. The resistance-skull badge I wear on my shoulder feels like a lie, months of blood, literal and figurative. For this. Till I hear something cry near me. I snap my head in the sound's direction, to a manhole cover, and without thinking, I start digging there. I shovel past torn nails and discarded hair.

 

Till I find a face. A child, barely 5 years old. I immediately cradle her into my arms, a child…A kid. Out of 68 million lives. Me and this girl were the only exceptions of this massacre. I hear her giggle in my embrace, oblivious. Probability’s cruel joke. Yet her blue eyes simply gaze at my gruff face. Cheerful, happy, naive. I want to laugh with the joke. But I can’t, my vocal cords having forgotten how to make that now foreign noise. Worn by months of disuse. 3 to be exact, 3 since the occupation. That’s when a new tear falls on my coat, only 1. What am I supposed to do?  A child? I’m no father, I couldn’t even protect my -

 

But my face softens a fraction, looking into her blue eyes. It’s then I remember what the sky looked like, pre-occupation. A beautiful, crisp blue. That changed to pink, purple, and orange when the day ended. I ask for her name, but she doesn’t respond. I’m not sure if she can talk, but she looks like a…Gabriel. Strong, enduring, a pretty girl.

 

 Without wasting more time, I climb down the manhole cover. I, no, we need to find the resistance. To fight back one last time, they stationed emergency forces down here. So as we descend, the last thing we see is the remnants of the Eiffel Tower in the distance. This, this was our supposed punishment for being ourselves.

 

My boots thud against the small puddles and clack on the granite of the sprawling tunnel network. The place was a system of drains so large, a small nuke couldn’t destroy it. But as I walk, I notice the waters start to get muddier. The deeper I go, the redder it gets, until I’m practically walking in blood. I try to stay calm, ignoring the stench. I make sure Gabriel isn’t looking, but that’s useless after what she went through. There wasn’t a reason to get scared; the covers naturally drained all the blood down here.

 

I then notice a drain by the corner pouring out a small stream of the liquid. And down there, by the passage, I spot a light. Flood lights, big and harsh. Without caution or hesitation, I sprint with abandon. Gabriel tucked in my right and the rifle in my left. I ignore the pain in my ribs and power through, getting closer.

 

But then I hear a noise. I then duck behind a crate, with a barrel roll, as silently as I could. I hush the girl firmly, both of us motionless. That sound was not human. I look over my shoulder. And there I see it. A large beast prowls with its black power armor- a black, mercury-like substance that flows on its body.  Its head slouching down from the 6-foot ceiling. But I notice something behind it, by a second crate, I see a bloodied, dark-skinned woman. She catches my piercing gaze and signals me to wait, grabbing a medieval spear nearby. A family heirloom, I assume.

 

With a wave of her hand, I snap my arm to it. I fire 2 bolts in rapid succession. For a moment, the armor’s sabotaged, leaving a large, exposed crater in the swirling, quickly filling material. She drives the blade through, piercing hide, then flesh with everything. The Gandra almost snaps back halfway, trying to shrug her off with a guttural roar. Before it makes the full rotation, l shoot both knees like appendages that instant. She then drives the blade there.

 

The strike fells the beast, its attempted tail strike missing her just barely over the head. On the ground, its claws reach for its holster, now blood-soaked. I shoot again, the hand hitting the floor. “AHHH!!! I shall upend YOU UNGRATEFUL squanderers! We show your kind mercy-”

 

Before he could talk further, the woman next to him twists the spear. The beast snarls in pain, looking up at us. We almost died there. That encounter was mere seconds. If it reached us in the remaining nanoseconds it needed for the rotation, its superior reflexes would’ve torn us asunder. I want to kill him then and there. But I can’t, we need him. That mocking voice holds the secrets to finding out how to beat them. Weaknesses, tech. Even a grunt knew more than we did.

 

But it’s cocky, too cocky. I then empty the barrel on all of its joints; you can never take a chance. Even in its crippled state could still kill us with a well-placed slash. But then I feel a small hand gripping my leg, head pressing against my leg. Yet I couldn’t take my eyes off him.  The woman quickly nails its hands to the ground too fast for him to respond. It’s still growling and slurring at us. And neither of us was going to waste words entertaining its spite.

 

We strip it of all its armor. We leave a few scraps for clothes, some shorts, and a T, there’s a child here anyway. The armor slips onto us without a problem. Fully clothing both of us, thanks to the Gandra’s size.

 

My new female companion looks at the beast with a sneer. “We might as well keep you filthy predator. I’m not going to eat my fallen comrades when you’re here fresh.” The voice of her accent was thick, yet strangely fluent. The woman draws a knife from her armor. But I shot the tail off. “Agghhh! Damn you, cowards!” She proceeded to tie the bleeding beast in ropes, hauling him through the tunnel. It didn’t try anything with the knife propped on its neck now.

 

I knew there was a transport line here. It might be gone now, but we had to check. V, yeah, that’s what I’m calling him, because every damn syllable they mutter sounds like a rock saying “V”. He keeps mumbling about his rank. But we ignore it, I manually haul the beast with us there. The transport’s our only way out, our only way to the space agency.

 

 Moving there, Gabriel seemed not to mind the brutality, even poking at the V’s eyes like a teddy bear. Though I pull her away, as V still tries snapping at her. It isn’t a long walk before a gate appears in the distance.  We quickly enter it, climbing into the underground train, readying it for the European space agency. Or what remains of it. We had to report the failure in Paris, but honestly speaking about it feels redundant. This was a brutal blood bath no one could miss.

 

Yet we start moving regardless. The train tracks are going slowly. On the way, we eventually got hungry. I look at her, and see her grab that knife. She’s the third exception to this. I knew the people who were down here, but I never saw her. But it’s hard to remember one face in a crowd when you’re not looking.

 

“Hey, what’s your name? I’m Marcus, Marc for short. And this girl I’m with is Gabriel. I call her that since she didn’t tell me her name.” The woman pulls out her combat knife. The Gandra’s mouth still shut. “My name’s Emma. Gabriel’s a weird name for a girl, by the way.” She presses the knife against V’s flank.

 

She tears a piece of flesh quickly. V thrashes out violently and tries to fight her, but bullets didn't shut the bitch up. But he stops after a few seconds, hearing the sizzling of a pan. The blood there is gushing out quickly; he knew he’d die keeping this up. And I’d lose a source of food.

 

His eyes meet mine, a begrudging strand of desperation. The suits can help heal him. Seal the wound and regenerate the flesh. I knew this for a while now, but it gave me an idea. I raise a finger and the goo transfers in a few drips, healing him fast.

 

“Your kind disgusts me. Don’t even consider us people, for the first months, we didn’t even think you were sentient. Hell, I wouldn’t even be surprised if you had no government. But no one pulls off space travel without order and rules.” I borrow the combat knife and tenderize the same area further. The blade is now embedded dangerously close to a heart. Close, though, not in. He lashes further, but his disabled state makes it futile. “And so long, you’re with us. I’ll regenerate-” I heal the wound I had just induced, “every sliver of flesh till, so be it I run out of this. It’s a gift you can breathe oxygen. Otherwise, we would’ve gotten rid of you.”

 

Emma then hands me a stake, the flesh surprisingly tender for its gamey tang. I take a bite, eating it fast. It’s not amazing, it’s just what I have to do, she and Gabriel eats too. There’s a simple silence. Not much, but that’s the thing I own in a majority. Ignoring the railway lines carrying us away. With the soft hum of the engine, and the warm compartment.

 

Later on the train stops. We exit, V included, and surface to a higher, but still underground facility. We drag him by a rope I found back there, through some tunnels. Then a team of enforcers stops us. Their metallic armor stands tall, almost the 7 feet of a Gandra. But they could see what’s already going on with us clad in the stolen armor and the ropes.

 

They let us pass through with little resistance. But a guard sets a hand on my shoulder as I walk, I look back, and he gives me a new rifle. “Put that bastard down when you’re done.” He walks off then, leaving his friend to scout, while I see a C4 in his hands. He heads down to the train and loads it there, setting it back to Paris on the 4-hour timer it took us to get here. With that, he shatters the Paris sign above that corridor. Tossing its scraps onto the floor.

 

Inside the walls were lined with reinforced steel barring and panels, in it massive shipbuilding factories line the sides, constructing newer, deadlier engines for the space force. Even with our decimation, we still had a stalemate in space. Not that it mattered. On the white floor, a lady in a white coat walks up to us. “Hello, I’ll be your guide here. And I see you brought us a little liaison. I’m Daniel.” She glances at V.

 

He snarls, now in some better restraints I didn’t notice he had before. The guards must’ve put them there earlier, when passing by. Soon enough she guides us to a large interrogation room, specifically made for his strength. V’s slammed into a chair. And We leave and observe him past 1-way-glass.

 

Inside, with him, is an investigator who speaks interrogates. “ My name’s Albert Wilson, and I’ll be asking a few questions. First, why are you still here? For confirmation of course, your kind don’t communicate at all with us.” The reptile did not try to tamper with the restraints, he saw some exposed wires there. All meaning electrocution if he missteps. “Food. Sustenance for my people, and expansion.” He kept it short, reaching out for a glass of water.

 

“Expansion? When you have 14 homeworlds and hundreds more planets. Same story with more lines. Tell me why I shouldn’t make a nice pair of boots from you? After all you’ve done for so-called food when you have replicators.”

 

“Isn’t it obvious? We require none of this. It’s our master’s whim, they asked of this when said replicators could no longer suffice. We are a middle race. Slaves with slaves. You were meant to be below even those below us.” There was no venom in his voice, though. The growl was laced with a cold business edge to it. He felt indifference. He didn’t feel remorse, never would.

 

“So that’s why you sick bastards don’t let us bury our dead. Mince them for your campaign. I won’t keep this long. You’re not salvageable in the slightest.” Wilson upholds a tablet; there, he plays a video he received from other relays.

 

Past the screen, it shows a purple-grass ranch, where a small furred creature stumbles out of a pen. It whimpers, being prodded with a taser. Beating it was a large, hulking, white beast. Reptilian like a Gandra, but in the way a lizard compares to a T-Rex.

 

“To my intelligence, this is your coworker species, a middle species ranked even higher than you, A-rank. Placed by your higher-ups. And I’ve heard they’re not happy with your performance in Sol. Too many men dying to kill off a species who’s just entered the information era. If you don’t finish the job the next week, you’ll be moved down a rank, and that suddenly means you’re on the menu for that big guy. Those ferret things? Used to be apex predators taller than you, now their feeding one. Let’s make sure that happens. Unless you help us.” He stands up, nodding his head to a secondary camera hidden in the corner. The tablet, still playing on the table, has an audible wet crunch, the next second, there’s apricot jam and some eyes on the ground.

 

He leaves a card on the table. “You have a choice. Make it.” He walks out, the door opening for him. V sits there, unsure. He could die a footnote for his empire. Or he could betray them, and risk death by the humans.

 

From the window, I see him pick up the card. The rifle was trained on him the whole time, waiting for his translator to mutter “NO”. Though I spent so long fighting these things, I understood their language, to an extent. Emma placed down the coffee she was drinking on the metallic table her. “Scaly’s with us now. Right? The moment that bastard lies, I’ll be the one slashing him down. Again.”

 

She picks up Gabriel from her side and holds her in her hands. Daniel the scientist from earlier is in here too, and I can see a question brewing on her face. “Can I ask how you captured him, and if there were any other survivors or were you the only?” She holds a clipboard in her hands, waiting for our answer. Emma gives Gabriel’s head a stroke before putting her down on the seat. I turn to Daniel.

 

“We found in the sewer system on our escape. We think he was searching for something. Probably more people. We think we’re the only survivors, we can give you some of the goo stuff to help out.” I said. I give her a gauntlet strapped on my arm, it pulls off easily, and she grabs a zip-lock bag before it turns to liquid. “Yeah, that’s what happened with me and Mark, we took him down in an ambush. As for survivors, most of us went up to the surface to fight. Me included, but I went back to get more ammo, almost losing an arm in he processes. The rest had their own last stands.” Emma massages her temples, her breath almost hitched, remembering the experience.

 

Neither of us want to go back to that, and hopefully, we never will. As much as I hate the bastard in there, he’s our last hope at winning this. Whether he tells us how to or we rip open his skull and poke at his neurons. Daniel finishes scribbling on her documents. “Thank you for that information. Do you have any idea what rank he is? So that we know his strength expectations and the best way to subdue him. We figure it can’t be that high, considering this.” She pointed a thumb to the window.

 

I scratch my head, nodding politely. “We’re sure he’s worse than a rookie, or the most we’ve seen. When he was fighting us, he was slow, very slow for Gandra standards. His fight or flight reflexes are bad, still running on instinct, when we fought in the subway/ sewer tunnels. He reached to slash us instead of using his gun.”

 

She writes everything down and looks up at me, her face scrunched. “What was he doing there? Mr Mark.” “Sorry Daniel but I don’t know, I think he was scouting out survivors. But that’s unlikely, he was alone and Gandra never stay that long. I’m guessing he was probably left behind. Wait-”

 

I look through the window again and focus on his snout, there I see a familiar scar. My knuckles turn white as I am now mangling the barrel in my hand. That bastard was in the shooting squad. He stood behind my executors, watching us die a we were downed, by the bullets.

 

I abruptly walk to the door, going past Daniel. “Mark, what are you doing! We can’t kill him, we need it, no-”  She grabs my arm, pulling me inches away from the door knob. Even Emma comes over and pulls away my gun. She grabs my second hand trying to calm me down. “Marcus, listen to her. If we lose him, our chances for avenging anyone hits zero. This is the only time we’ve ever gotten a live captor, and if we fumble it, the five billion dead are going to be joined by another twelve. Hold out, just for the week.”

 

Her hands hold me close before she loosens them. It feels contradictory, but honestly, she would be the last person to save any of V’s kind, out of her heart at least. I feel the gun slip out as Daniel removes it, tucking it safely in the corner.

 

I stand stooping at the door in silence for a few seconds. But then something cold and metallic is put in my hand instead. I look down and see Emma wrapping a pair of brass knuckles around my fingers. She slips an arm past and opens the door. “This won’t kill him; they have thick skulls.” Not even Daniel tries to stop me this time. I don’t know where she got them, and I’m not interested in that answer.

 

I walk out. The next moment, V notices me enter the room. He sees my now combed black hair and the white T-shirt and black pants I got while he was being interrogated. I even got a new pacemaker, which makes this job easier. His nostrils can still smell the blood on my skin as I haven’t bathed yet, but now layered in cologne. Before he comments on my new appearance, I land my hit.

 

His head swivels back slightly, tasting blood. I could feel his scales cracking under my swing. But I don’t stop. I throw an uppercut with my raw hand, a small mist of blood flying from both of us, connecting with his hide. I pull before he decides to fight back. He scowls at me from the other side of the table. My hand’s throbbing, but I don’t comfort it. I simply put the knuckles in my pocket, looking back at him.

 

“I will not hesitate to put you in your place, if you step out of line.” I leave him with my warning, going out again. Wilson already left the room, and now it was up to the enforcers to un-restrain the reptile. Now, all we had to worry about is regaining interplanetary supremacy. Once accomplished, we can finally and properly set sail for the galactic stage.",3,1752593923.0,HFY,3,1.0,False

I’d really love to connect with a woman who’s a few steps ahead someone who’s mid to senior level, ideally also in tech or product, who might be open to chatting occasionally or offering perspective. I’ve found that sometimes the best guidance comes not from formal mentorship programs but from real conversations with women who’ve navigated this before.

They will know you are reading this, and they will be coming after you just like they're coming after me.
Prepare yourself — they see everything. Good luck.

My name is Escribar.
If somehow you are reading this message now, they're probably reading it too.
I'm speaking from Brazil, but if this conspiracy goes as far as I think it does, the world map is probably manipulated to keep you and me under control. And if you still don't understand what I'm talking about, then my message has reached its receiver.

Have you ever felt like you are simply excluded from social circles where everyone else fits in?
I have. I've always been treated like I'm different. People just seemed to think that I had some mental health problems, and now I know those people were just bad actors.

I was hired as the night guard of my city's government building. They told me my job was to patrol the interior of the building and the backyard because drug dealers and addicts were using that unsupervised place to smoke and sell narcotics
(Very dumb choice of place, by the way) — and especially because of some vandals that had been causing trouble.
I'm a tall and relatively strong guy, so some rebellious teenagers shouldn't be a big deal.

After four months on this job, the security guard from the afternoon shift called me to say he had forgotten the security camera key hanging on the door.
We usually bring all the keys to the staff room and put them in the key drawer, so he told me to get the camera key and take it there when I finished my shift.
I usually don’t even remember those keys exist, since I don’t use them during my shift — only the main key and the backyard key.
I hadn’t been instructed to patrol only the main rooms and the backyard, and I even had access to the key drawer.
The only rule I had was: do not patrol the second floor.
And honestly, it had been boring these last few weeks, just walking from one place to another.
So I decided to supervise the building using the cameras.
That was my most horrible mistake.

An hour had passed since I turned on the monitor — 1:23 AM.
There are 32 cameras in total, but only 14 are on the ground floor: the halls, the front of the building, the meeting rooms, the staff room, and the main office.
I always thought it was strange that I was hired to protect the building but only had permission to observe specific places.
While taking a sip of my sugar-free coffee, I noticed a small rope sticking out from the monitor.
Thinking it was one of the screen's wires, I tried to fit it back into the monitor, but it just fell off.
The rope was tied to a small plastic rectangle that had been covering part of the back of the screen.
I checked the back of the monitor to see if I had broken anything.
Fortunately (or unfortunately), I hadn’t.
All I found was a small “tablet”-like screen that had been hidden behind the plastic piece I removed.

Not thinking too much, I turned on the tablet. It didn’t even have a menu — it just immediately opened four additional cameras, probably used by the morning shift guard.
Of the four cameras, only one worked: camera 3.
It was showing the management room, on the second floor — a place I wasn't allowed to go.

Before I even had time to think ""Hey, I was told not to supervise this place,"" the camera detected movement.

It was... Pietra?!
The popular girl who studied with me.
She had always treated me badly during school.
She was wearing a beautiful and expensive all-black outfit, with a skirt that reached just below the knees.
I remembered that I was the security guard, and a lot of questions popped into my mind:
How did she get in? Why did she come here? What is she doing?

I watched her for a bit.
She moved her finger carefully across the surface of the manager’s desk — which caused it to... move and open a hidden hole in the ground?
“Maybe it’s a secret safe for the manager’s valuables,” I thought.

I sprinted to the key drawer and grabbed the management room keys, then ran to the second floor.
Getting the keys was useless, because the door was already unlocked and opened with the pressure of my hands as I tried to insert the key.

No one was in there.
The management desk was in place like always.
I looked to the corner of the room where the camera was supposed to be, but all I saw was concrete.
Am I going crazy?

I felt fear for the first time in this job.
I had never experienced a possible break-in — everything had always been calm.

I reached for my radio to call the authorities.
I don’t know why I hadn’t done this earlier, but with my hands shaking, the radio slipped from my fingers and shattered on the ground.

“SH*T!” I had never said that word with so much feeling before.

I looked at the opened management desk with a bit of curiosity.
If the girl had gone somewhere, it had to be through that hole.
Or — in the best-case scenario — I was just hallucinating.

I rubbed the desk surface with my fingers, trying to imitate what I saw her doing.
In some specific spots on the table, I could feel the surface dent slightly and make a clicking sound.
After pressing three of them, the desk moved and revealed an opening with a long staircase.

I entered the opening.

I got to the other side after descending the stairs. It was an elegant, elevator-like room — empty.
I saw a floor panel on one of the walls.
At that moment, I was just out of myself. I wasn’t questioning anything anymore.
I just wanted to see where the girl had gone, report it to the cops, and get out of that place as fast as I could.

I touched the only button present, and the ground started to descend.
It was a very elegant and baroque-like structure.

""You've come! It was about time. I have such sights to show you,"" said a clear and feminine voice coming from the walls.
Maybe it was Pietra?

The ground stopped descending. The walls opened.

A massive, enormous underground structure — like an infinite underground palace — all in a 1600s-like style.
There were classical and even some unknown old paintings, and the place had a strange but pleasant whiskey scent.
Millions of people dressed in smoke-colored suits and dresses, all wearing golden and blue masks.
They were walking, sitting, eating, dancing, drinking, or just standing in the endless rooms like it was some kind of eternal masquerade.

As soon as I stepped out, I realized I should’ve just patrolled the building as I was told to.

Two tall figures in long black robes and golden, overstuffed face masks stared straight into my soul.
In perfect synchrony and absolute silence, they pulled adorned blades out of their pockets.

I ran back into the elevator, feeling something I had never felt before, and smashed the only button on the panel.
The doors instantly closed, and I fell onto my back in complete shock.
I knew something was seriously wrong.

The doors opened as soon as I got back to the ground floor.
I rushed out of the elevator and into the management room again.
Stumbling, I ran to the door — but for some reason, it was now locked.
Whatever THEY are, they know I’m here.

As a security guard, I had to pass some physical and tactical training — nothing too special, but it could save your life.

I tried to stay calm while I picklocked the door with improvised tools.
But that calm faded away when I heard the elevator engine click again.
I hadn’t even realized I was holding my breath until I started choking.

I kicked the door near the handle, and I could hear the steel breaking.
I kicked it with all my strength, using the sound of the desk moving as motivation.
That’s when they arrived in the room with me.

The two golden-masked figures entered just as I managed to destroy the door handle.
I stepped out of the management room only to find another one of them at the end of the hallway.

""What are you?! What do you want with me?!"" I screamed, pulling out the pocket knife I carried hidden on the right side of my waist under my pants and belt.
""So brave, huh? Such a waste,"" said one of them, with a modulated voice.

""I said wh—""
I couldn’t finish my sentence.
The one in the hallway sprinted at me with his golden-handled knife.
I saw that he had a gun in a holster on his leg — and I don’t know why he didn’t just shoot me.
The one who attacked me was the shortest of the three.

The management room door had its handle broken, but it was still mostly in place.
I shut the door as fast and as hard as I could, causing it to jam and trap the two other figures inside — at least for a while.
Right after that, the masked one in the hall reached me.
I managed to grab the hand holding the knife and we both fell to the ground.
I kicked him away, but he slashed my leg just below the knee.

As he stumbled back and fell again, I got up and ran toward the stairs.
The cut on my left leg was superficial — it wasn’t even bleeding yet.
I ran past all the rooms and unlocked the front door as fast as I could.

I was finally outside the building.
But my relief didn’t last long.

The roads were absolutely empty. No cars, no people.
It was 2:04 in the morning — at that time, people who work early are usually already on their way.

They are a militia. A new society. And only certain people are considered “worthy” of joining it.
I don’t know the criteria, I don’t know how many people are involved, and I don’t know what they’re doing.
But if just knowing they exist means I need to be extinguished — it’s definitely nothing good.

I ran toward the city’s police station — not too far from the building I work in.
On the way, I had the strange feeling that they knew exactly where I was, and I wasn’t dead yet because they simply didn’t want me dead — yet.

I reached the police station after two or three minutes of running.
I don’t even know how I managed to do it.

I entered through the front door — and what I saw made me realize how completely screwed I was.

All the police officers were unconscious.
So were the civilians waiting there.

Whatever they are, the government is involved — and they have control over everything.

I don’t know why they haven’t killed me yet.
Maybe they’re just playing with their food.
Or maybe they’re planning something worse.

Either way, I’m hiding inside the police station and managed to arm myself.
I know they know I’m here
what did Pietra want to show me?

So I’m praying to God this message reaches someone.

If my prayer worked and you’re somehow reading this
I'm talking now from ***** **** - ** 
don’t trust anyone. They could be part of it.
Prepare yourself because they’ll come for you when you least expect it.

I don’t know what else to do.
I’ll just hope some of the cops wake up before they decide to neutralize me.

**Here’s what I’d love your help with:**

1. **Foundations First**
   * Best beginner tutorials or courses?
   * Core concepts I shouldn’t sleep through (webhooks, triggers, nodes, etc.).
2. **AI Integration Deep Dive**
   * How to plug in OpenAI, Hugging Face, or other AI nodes the right way.
   * Real-world examples: sentiment analysis, text generation, data enrichment—you name it.
3. **Progression Path**
   * Recommended learning sequence: basics → intermediate → advanced.
   * Milestones or “aha” moments I should hit before moving on.
4. **Tutorial Vault**
   * Blog series, YouTube channels, GitHub repos, PDF guides—if it teaches n8n and AI in concert, I want it.
   * Any hidden gems or “ancient scrolls” from the early days that still hold up.
5. **Best Practices & Gotchas**
   * Common pitfalls folks trip over when mixing AI and workflows.
   * Tips for debugging and optimization—because hell hath no fury like a flaky node.
6. **Community & Next Steps**
   * Active Discord/Slack/Forums where pros hang out.
   * Challenges or project ideas to cement the skills.

I appreciate a no-BS approach—tell me what really worked for you, and what tutorials turned out to be fluff. I’m old-school enough to love a well-structured syllabus, but I’m also here for witty anecdotes and war stories from your automations gone rogue.

I recently found an interest in photography. I was outside every day like a mad man. I even enjoyed the failure and looked at it with extreme optimism as opportunity to get better, but now I havent picked up my (extremely expensive) camera equipment in over a week.

Im always told by my wife to “give myself grace” and “its not always consistent” BUT WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IS NEVER CONSISTENT AND THE END RESULT IS ALWAYS FAILURE? She just doesnt know my track record since childhood

I know im in a depressive episode right now but I also know that once I get out of it (fucking a year from now i bet) that my passion will have subsided. I wont care anymore. I feel like stability is just as brutal as the episodes because I delude myself into thinking I found the right medication and now Ill FINALLY STAY stable but nope im right back into depression, hating life, dreading work every day, laying in bed from the time i wake up until its time to work besides going out to get a coffee which is the only pleasure i get during the work week i wanted to call out today so fucking bad and it wouldnt even be a burden since we have one extra person on tuesdays, but calling out just makes me feel guilty and fills me with anxiety all day so its not like i would enjoy being at home

It wasn’t even dramatic. Just a soft, “Those are really pretty,” while we were both waiting for coffee. Me being lesbian made it a way bigger thing in my head for me than I would of shown, so said thank you and smiled like a normal person, but inside, I went into a full emotional spiral. It felt like someone reached through all the noise in my head and reminded me that I’m still someone worth noticing.

When I’m on my period, everything hits deeper. A kind word feels like a lifeline. A small inconvenience feels like the world is ending. My skin feels thinner, as if every emotion lives closer to the surface. It’s exhausting, but strangely beautiful too. I feel more tuned in, more human. I don’t know if it’s just hormones, or if it’s that time of the month when my heart speaks louder than my brain.

Does anyone else get like this? Absurdly sensitive, but also a little spiritually cracked open?

From the article: 

""With more seating comes more coffee, Griffin-Diaz said. Plans include a second coffee bar specifically for specialty brews, like rare varietal coffees or showcases from coffee competition winners from around the world. (Alejandro Griffin-Diaz is a frequent international competitor and winner.)

""Later this year, the new space will add Jaja, the natural wine bar.

""... The couple, and friends they've made all over the world from competing in coffee competitions, will be curating the wine list. The goal is to have varieties that can't be found anywhere else in the area. Most recently, Griffin-Diaz said the couple was inspired by a competition trip to Bucharest, Romania, where they were exposed to many new wine varieties.""",26,1752593008.0,Albany,2,0.93,False

The screen froze for a few hours before completely shutting down. I have attempted various troubleshooting methods, including watching YouTube tutorials and visiting repair shops and service centers, but unfortunately, they were unable to fix it. I purchased this phone about four years ago for (11k INR). It served me well. The screen had cracked when it fell, and it experienced some lag and glitches, but it remained usable. About six months ago, it began randomly shutting down and consistently lagging. The screen also started showing marks. While it improved for a few months, it completely shut down on July 13th.

I'm just a student and I do not own any laptops or tablets, so this phone is my only device. My family is unable to afford a new phone for me, and I do not wish to burden my parents or add to their stress. I am currently working part-time in a bakery, which is the only job I could find, and I will earn approximately (7k INR) before I move out. The pay is not ideal in this part of the world, but it is what I have. While I could purchase a feature phone for a very low price, colleges nowadays rely on phones and laptops for studies. I would need to attend online classes, record audio in class, take pictures of notes, participate in group meetings, study from YouTube or Google, complete assignments, and download materials. The list of uses goes on.

I humbly request any assistance you can offer. Every contribution would be greatly appreciated. I am hoping to raise between (10k INR) and (15k INR) for a phone with a decent camera, battery, and microphone. I would consider to buy a second-hand phone, but they often come with issues related to the battery, charging, camera, microphone, overheating, and lagging, and the warranty would have expired.  
If any of you generous souls would help me by donating your old (extra) phone you have lying around and don't use very often rn, it would be a miracle! i wouldn't have to beg here in endless subs for donation...ik this seems pathetic and rather nuisance but i am under a lot of stress and responsibilities rn and any help you do is a blessing in disguise...

I am sharing this request on various subreddits to reach as many people as possible and increase the chances of receiving donations. I am an honest person and sincerely hope your generosity will help me overcome this challenge. It would truly be amazing.

i will not be bringing my car, and am specifically looking within the river north/west loop areas (but im open to anything!). my office is located in west loop- and the reason i want to be near there, is because i would like to walk to work (or take the train if i absolutely have to) if possible. i'm looking for a 1 bed 1 bath apartment (not studio preferably). my budget is around $2k - i'm not sure if this is completely unrealistic, but of course i'd be willing to go higher if absolutely necessary. 

not sure if this is relevant, but might give you an idea about me/what i enjoy doing with friends in my free time i like: 

\- taking walks with friends + coffee/matcha runs

\- trying new workout classes

\- grabbing a drink in a nice outdoor area

\- finding new brunch spots

\- rooftop bars! and i love a good night out

\- essentially, would love to try new things! i'm completely open and spontaneous :)

  
so if anyone has any ideas for any apartment complexes/buildings/areas i should look into (even if its not river north/west loop) please let me know! would love to hear everyone's input. i really want to meet new people and find that one 'friend group' eventually haha.

**Parse the Odds (or Lack Thereof):**  
Ah, the WTA Italian Open! Where the clay is red, the sun is hot, and the bookmakers have apparently taken a coffee break. The provided data offers *zero* odds for this match, which is like trying to predict a soccer game’s winner using only the weather forecast. But fear not! We’ll improvise with stats, recent form, and the timeless wisdom of “Lisa Pigato plays on her home turf, which gives her an edge… or at least better WiFi for her post-match Instagram story.”

**Digest the News:**  
Claire Liu, the French-American clay-court specialist, is a player who could outlast a three-hour Netflix documentary on Renaissance art. Her game is built on patience, defensive wizardry, and the ability to turn a two-set deficit into a “let’s play 12 games in the third” endurance test. Last month’s Eupago Porto Open upsets? Not directly relevant, but if top seeds like Heather Watson can be eliminated by a “mosquito swarm of determination,” Liu knows anything can happen here.

Lisa Pigato, the 21-year-old Italian, is the definition of “young and hungry.” She won the 2024 Rome title (on this very clay) and has the kind of aggressive baseline game that makes you check your racket strings for shrapnel. With the Italian Open in Rome, Pigato’s support system is as loud as a espresso machine at 7 a.m. Plus, let’s be real: The crowd loves her. They’ll cheer her on

1m0kjcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1m0kjcd/how_does_the_vevor_commercial_ice_cream_machine/,How Does the VEVOR Commercial Ice Cream Machine Perform in Busy Kitchens?,"The VEVOR BQL-7220T Commercial Ice Cream Machine landed on my countertop not long ago, and I’ve been running it through its paces ever since. Ice cream has long been an obsession in my house, with everyone from my kids to my coworkers often debating the perfect swirl or flavor combo. Naturally, having a machine like this to test was an exciting prospect. From its impressive capacity to its user-friendly features, there’s a lot to unpack here.

**Design and Build Quality**

This machine feels like a tank of creamy goodness! It weighs in at a hefty 187.4 pounds, so moving it requires some strategy—I had my brother help lift it to its dedicated spot. Once in place, its stainless steel construction shines with a durable and professional finish. The solid SUS201 stainless steel exterior and food-grade SUS304 stainless steel cylinders not only make it sturdy but also incredibly easy to clean. I’ve wiped sticky ice cream residue off other machines before, but this one’s surfaces are smooth and resistant to buildup. It’s clearly designed to withstand heavy use in professional environments.

**Performance and Features**

What stands out most about this soft-serve machine is its performance. This thing is efficient! It can churn out up to 21 quarts of ice cream per hour, providing 8 to 10 servings (each 80g) without skipping a beat. My friends and I recently had a mini ice cream night, and even with half a dozen people constantly refilling cups, the machine didn’t falter. The two 4L hoppers and 1.8L cylinders provide a large enough reserve, while the rapid freeze capability ensures that you’re not left waiting. From initial startup, it only took about 15 minutes for the first batch to be ready, and subsequent servings came out in a lightning-fast 6 minutes.

**Ease of Use**

As someone who has struggled with overly complicated machines in the past, this one won me over with its thoughtful design. The LCD control panel is straightforward, showing production time, remaining quantity, and other handy details. One-click auto-cleaning was, frankly, a lifesaver. I despise scrubbing machines bit by bit, and the automated cleaning feature here simplifies everything. Additionally, the elevated design means I never have to lean awkwardly or bend down to operate it, which is much kinder to my back than similar models out there.

**Versatility**

Beyond just ice cream, the possibilities with this machine feel limitless. Waffle cones, cakes, and ice cream sandwiches? All of this became infinitely easier to prepare with its consistent texture and reliable performance. I can see it thriving not just in a home environment but also in ice cream shops, cafes, or dessert kiosks. My cousin runs a small coffee shop, and he’s already eyeing this machine for his dessert menu lineup.

**Pluses**

- High-output capacity makes it ideal for gatherings or commercial setups  
- Stainless steel construction ensures durability and food safety  
- Rapid freeze and quick batch times keep the supply constant  
- User-friendly LCD interface eliminates confusion for operators  

**Pitfalls**

- The size and weight make it difficult to move without help  
- Initial setup and operation require a bit of a learning curve  

**Challengers**

Looking at alternatives like the Cuisinart ICE-45 or the Whynter ICM-201SB, it’s clear the VEVOR machine targets a different level of usage. Those models are solid for smaller-scale operations or home use but lack the sheer capacity and durability of the VEVOR. For instance, the Whynter struggles to keep up during prolonged use, whereas this machine thrives under consistent demand. That said, the ICE-45's compact size and lower price might appeal to casual users. Meanwhile, with rapid freezing and automated cleaning, the VEVOR offers features that many competitors can’t match in a commercial setting.

**Value Proposition**

When it comes to the price-to-quality ratio, this ice cream maker punches well above its weight. Its hefty build and suite of features might seem intimidating, but it delivers such consistent and reliable results that it’s hard not to justify its price for serious users. Whether you’re managing a restaurant, hosting frequent parties, or delving into side gigs selling ice cream, the investment pays for itself in how swiftly it operates and how well it holds up.

I wanted to share my experience to help others who are in the same boat.

I spent countless hours comparing different models, reading reviews, and even visiting local stores. The most important factors I considered were durability, weather resistance, and overall value for money.

Through my research, I discovered that aluminum hardtop gazebos offer the best combination of durability and maintenance-free ownership. Unlike their soft-top counterparts, these structures can withstand heavy snow loads and won't collapse under rain accumulation.

One standout feature that really matters is the roof design. Double-tier roofs provide better ventilation and help prevent hot air from getting trapped inside. This makes a huge difference during summer barbecues and outdoor gatherings.

The size is another crucial factor. While 10x12 feet is the most popular size, I'd recommend measuring your space carefully. Consider furniture placement and walking space - you'll want at least 2-3 feet of clearance around your seating area.

If you're interested in exploring different options, I found a great selection here: https://athometouch.com/gazebos

Installation is something many people worry about. While most hardtop gazebos come with detailed instructions, it's definitely a two-person job. Make sure to anchor it properly - this isn't something you want to skip.

Some key features to look for:
- Rust-resistant frame
- UV-protected polycarbonate roof panels
- Built-in gutters for water drainage
- Mosquito netting
- Privacy curtains
- Proper ventilation system

Maintenance is surprisingly simple. Just occasional cleaning with soap and water keeps it looking new. One tip: remove heavy snow accumulation during winter to prevent any potential damage.

The price range varies significantly, but I've found that spending a bit more upfront saves money in the long run. Cheaper models often need replacement within a few years, while quality hardtop gazebos can last 10+ years with proper care.

For the best deals and current prices, check out this curated selection: https://athometouch.com/gazebos

I've been using mine for over a year now, and it's completely transformed my outdoor space. It's perfect for everything from morning coffee to evening gatherings, and it holds up beautifully in all weather conditions.

Remember to check local building codes before installation. Some areas require permits for permanent structures, though most hardtop gazebos are considered temporary and don't need special permission.

The investment in a quality hardtop gazebo has definitely been worth it for my family. It's essentially added an extra room to our home, and we use it almost every day when weather permits.",1,1752592411.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

I bought this pre owned breville machine last week and I’m using it for the first time today. 

The original breville portafilter that the machine came with cannot fit into the machine for some reason - so I bought a 58mm third party bottomless portafilter. 

When I dial in the grind (12, 16g coffee) I get what I think is a reasonable looking shot, but there is a lot of leaking around the portafilter and even above the entire unit? (See video) 

Any ideas how I can fix? 

I fully accept this may be user error which is why I’m not confident to return the machine. 

Things I’ve tried: 

-I’ve made sure to not over tamp the grinds and compress it too much.

-I originally had worse results with 18g coffee at 6 and 9 grind with significantly more leak and almost no coffee coming through 

-Under advice, took the shower screen out and loosened the screw as originally this was very tight and the shower screen couldn’t move at all. Now it can spin when pushed with a finger.

I couldn’t believe it. Doggie just died for the 26th time tonight after the drop.

I sat there in the dark, slumped in my chair, staring at his defeated face on the screen. My Trick body pillow slipped from my hands and hit the floor with a dull thud. My vision blurred with tears.

How could Doggie do this to me? He’d been flawless in practice. Consistent getting to the drop, time after time. I had sacrificed sleep, skipped meals, given up everything for this verification. I thought we had an understanding.

I screamed.

Not words, just sound. Something raw and inhuman.

I got up and threw my mouse at the monitor. It crashed through the screen, shattering glass and spraying sparks onto the carpet. I didn’t even blink.

Then I started wrecking the living room. I flipped the coffee table in one heave. I tore down the curtains with both hands. I stomped on my PC until the casing cracked open and the motherboard splintered beneath my heel.

Upstairs, my wife screamed my name. I heard my children crying.

I ran to the foot of the stairs, still screaming in pain. She was throwing clothes into bags. My kids clung to her, wailing. When they saw me, they shrank back in terror.

“Please,” she said, voice quivering. “We can’t do this anymore.”

I reached out for them, but they turned away.

Before I could even register it, they were gone. The door slammed. I heard the car’s engine roar to life. The car sped down the street, taillights blinking through my tears.

I dropped to my knees in the foyer. Pressed my forehead to the floor. Sobbed so hard I felt splinters bury into my skin.

It was over.

All for Doggie. For Icedcave. For a level that would never, ever be verified.

The house was silent now. Oppressively, unbearably silent.

I was alone, surrounded by wreckage.

EESI [underscores(opens in a new tab)](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/issue-brief-critical-minerals-and-the-u.s-clean-energy-transition?utm_source=chatgpt.com) that the U.S. currently imports 100% of 12 critical minerals and over 50% of another 28 minerals vital for technologies including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and advanced electronics.  These minerals underpin key industries such as battery storage (lithium, nickel, cobalt) and permanent magnets (rare earths), making supply chain resilience a national security priority.

# Key Points for Investors

The U.S. domestic critical mineral supply chain faces formidable challenges, starting with exploration and extraction. According to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI), it can take an average of 16 years just to navigate permitting processes for mining, with additional environmental and social barriers often delaying or derailing projects. Even when minerals are mined domestically, much of the downstream processing and refining takes place overseas. This “onshore bottleneck,” as EESI describes it, stems from a combination of high labor costs, insufficient infrastructure, and complex regulatory burdens.

However, momentum is building to reverse this dependency. Federal legislation—including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act—has infused billions into domestic mining, refining, and recycling initiatives. In tandem, a slate of bipartisan bills introduced in 2025 aims to strengthen public-private partnerships, streamline permitting, and promote advanced materials R&D. Meanwhile, President Trump’s executive orders earlier this year have accelerated permitting timelines and signaled a push into deep-sea mining—adding urgency and complexity to the evolving policy landscape

# Critical questions remain unanswered

1. Commercial outlook on deep-sea mining–The U.S. is not yet a voting member of the International Seabed Authority, casting uncertainty on the timeline for offshore critical mineral development [Environmental and Energy Study Institute(opens in a new tab)](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/issue-brief-critical-minerals-and-the-u.s-clean-energy-transition?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
2. Recycling cost viability–Secondary recovery methods, such as lithium from brine or rare earths from coal ash, are emerging—but face cost and scaling barriers .
3. Scale up of the rare earth element and critical mineral supply chain years away. Even with the MP Materials Department of Defense deal 2028 is targeted go live officially.
4. Environmental stewardship–How will investors assess and mitigate the substantial environmental and human costs—especially near tribal lands—associated with mining and processing operations?

The arrangement would see MP Materials supply neodymium magnets—crucial components for many Apple products—from its Fort Worth, Texas facility. **In addition, Apple and MP Materials reportedly plan to establish a rare earth recycling operation in Mountain Pass, California, which will process material from both end-of-life electronics and post-industrial sources.**

“Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States,” said Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.

As the only fully integrated rare earths producer operating domestically, MP Materials is well-positioned to expand its manufacturing capabilities and create jobs in R&D and high-tech manufacturing. The two firms are expected to collaborate on training programs to build a skilled workforce to support the new operations.

**The California recycling site will be designed to convert recovered rare earth material into high-grade inputs that meet Apple’s rigorous specifications. Apple and MP Materials have reportedly been developing and testing cutting-edge recycling methods over the last five years, with the goal of reusing rare earth magnets in Apple’s supply chain.**

Recycled rare earths were first featured in Apple’s iPhone 11, specifically in the Taptic Engine. Since then, the company says nearly all magnets across its product range are made with 100% recycled rare earth content.

**This investment is part of Apple’s broader pledge to contribute more than $500 billion to the U.S. economy over the next four years. The magnets manufactured through this partnership will be shipped worldwide to meet rising demand.**

MP Materials owns and operates the only rare earth mine in the United States and is preparing to launch commercial-scale magnet production at its Texas site by late 2025.

**The reported Apple deal comes shortly after MP Materials secured a multibillion-dollar agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense. That deal is aimed at ramping up domestic output of rare earth magnets and reducing U.S. dependence on Chinese supply chains for critical materials used in defense, electric vehicles, and electronics.**

**According to Fox Business, the partnership also includes plans to construct another magnet production facility in Fort Worth and finalize the recycling facility in Mountain Pass.**



# JULY 14th, 2025~America has lit a fire under the rare earths market. Now ASX juniors want Australia to do the same

* Rare earths miners are hopeful of higher prices thanks to a US Government deal with California miner MP Materials
* Floor price of US$110/kg for NdPr could drag ex-China rare earths prices higher
* Developers and explorers want Australia to follow suit and provide floor pricing to build ex-China supply chain

In the weeks ahead of the Federal Election, the Albanese Government launched its “Trump Card”, to get miners onside and float a carrot in the face of the US Administration in a bid to allay the threat of tariffs.

A $1.2 billion commitment to build a critical minerals stockpile, leveraging the geological miracle of WA with its bounty of lithium, nickel and rare earths, was proposed as a way to support a set of industries beaten down by Chinese market control and manipulation and give the US access to something it dearly wants.

Like so many political commitments it was wishy-washy. What would go into that stockpile was unclear.

[**Lynas (ASX:LYC)**](https://stockhead.com.au/company/lynas-lyc/) boss Amanda Lacaze declined last month at a media huddle in Perth to say whether the company had been in negotiations about selling material to Canberra from its Mt Weld mine near Laverton, or what price it may chase.

**But a shot in the arm was delivered by the Americans themselves last week, which could set prices for any similar initiative the Aussie Government wants to roll out.**

MP Materials, the US$7.4 billion owner of the US’ only rare earths operation at Mountain Pass in California, inked US$400m in equity investments from the Department of Defense as part of a multi-billion dollar public-private partnership that will make the Pentagon a 15% shareholder in the New York listed company – a 52% gain on Thursday already putting the taxpayer in the money.

Contained within that deal were loans to expand and construct new and existing magnet production plants and, crucially, a 10-year arrangement to buy or stockpile oxides from Mountain Pass at US$110/kg NdPr oxide.

Even with prices in China surging in response to the news, that clocks in at roughly double the Chinese market price once value-added tax is removed. If ex-China pricing rises to meet that signal, the key circuit-breaker to kick-off stalled rare earths developments – ending low prices resulting from overproduction in the Middle Kingdom – could be triggered.

Argonaut’s Jon Scholtz and George Ross said the deal could provide guidance for future offtakes in Australia, such as for the [**Iluka Resources (ASX:ILU)**](https://stockhead.com.au/company/iluka-resources-ilu/) Eneabba Refinery in WA, which is being supported by close to $2 billion of cheap Canberra debt.

“We view this move as a positive which solidifies the US rare earth magnet supply chain. Of our covered, LYC has upside from the US Plant (separate heavies) which would fill the last remaining gap in the US supply chain,” they said in a note on Monday.

**“While this provides precedent for ILU’s Eneabba facility and potential offtakes with the Australian government for a strategic stockpile.”**

About six months ago, it began randomly shutting down and consistently lagging. The screen also started showing marks. While it improved for a few months, it completely shut down on July 13th.

Back after I had my daughter I had a series of sinus infections until about 2017 when I quit milk in my coffee (basically most dairy) and they abruptly stopped. I started Spiro for moderate cystic acne in late 2021, 50mg. After about 9 months went to 75mg (and it has really been wonderful, I don't have to cover my face in makeup or employ hydrocolloid patches every night). 2023 the sinus infections started again and now they have been going on every 4-5 months for 3 years.

My ENT said I do have a deviated septum but good airflow. But also a mucus-y nose. Which I just googled this morning because I wondered what might cause that. Lo and behold, Gemini said ""some high blood pressure medications""

The only major change I've had (other than getting older and dealing with perimenopause) is taking spiro.

I am feeling like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Stop taking spiro and get pizza face and scarring and hate going outside, or get septoplasty for my deviated septum (which has never caused me issues until the last 10 years) which looks like a miserable week+ of recovery.

Kind or brutally honest! 



Part 1:

The room redefined grey: grey walls; grey table; grey carpet – hell, even a grey chair. The

building seemed devoid of sound or any other form of sensory stimulation – no pictures, no

discernable smells… Although it was a busy building in a bustling city, nothing indicated

signs of life outside of that room.

Iain O’Donnell sat motionless at the table. His powerful hands were clasped on the table in

front of him in an attempt to still the tremors that betrayed his apparent composure. Dark

shadows under his eyes, amplified by his unkempt stubble and overgrown hair, reflected a

different man to the one outlined in his service record - a man haunted and bewildered by

recent events.

The room suddenly exploded into life as the door was kicked open and the aromas of strong

coffee and bacon rolls invaded the space. Coffees clutched in one hand, bakers’ bags in the

other and a manila file suspended from clenched teeth, the wiry frame of Francis Nordale

entered. He grinned around the folder as he kicked the door shut behind himself and mutely

proffered coffee and rolls to O’Donnell.

Nordale’s energy and practicality felt immediately reassuring. O’Donnell felt a sudden surge

of relief. Nothing had changed – that wasn’t possible – but Nordale’s presence somehow

signalled that normality – life - still existed after weeks of numbness and horror.

Nordale sat, fumbling with the case file and a small Dictaphone, then bit enthusiastically into

his roll. His eyes met those of O’Donnell, still holding his coffee and bag, untouched. “You

going to eat, then?” enquired Nordale, smiling encouragement. “I always find that I work

better on a full stomach – and don’t tell me that you’re not hungry, I can tell you’ve not been

in the right place to look after yourself.”

O’Donnell realized that he was, in fact, sick from hunger. Almost robotically, he forced

himself to bite into the roll, to release the tension in his jaw and throat sufficiently to eat.

Only after O’Donnell and he had both eaten and drank did Nordale break the silence.

“Now. Before we begin, I should make it clear that I do not think you’re crazy. I know you are

not crazy, however it might seem to others, or to yourself. Nothing you tell me can be more

outlandish or bizarre than other cases I have already seen – and the people who told me

those weren’t crazy either.” Nordale paused, smiled reassuringly. “Although I am an

investigator, I have no legal rights or jurisdiction. I am allowed to investigate these…cases,

precisely because no-one here gives me jurisdiction over anything! There are no penalties or

punishments for not answering my questions. Nor are there for admitting anything. But you

may just find that sharing with me what happened might be a relief. There are no trick

mirrors, no bugs – the only person listening here is me. I just need you to tell me what

happened in as much detail as you can – truthfully – however confusing, bizarre or

outlandish it seems.”

O’Donnell stared at him mutely.

“Do you understand what I said? Do you have questions for me?” Nordale asked gently.

“This is for your benefit, really – just so you can get it off your mind. Think of it as being like a

confessional…”

O’Donnell nodded slowly, faintly, finally seeming to come to a decision. He dug deep into the

pockets of his combat trousers and fished out a small tin. Carefully stored inside it, wrapped



in fabric, were tattered pages from a notepad and a withered wildflower. His voice rusty from

disuse, he finally spoke to Nordale. “I’m going to need more coffee…..”

O’Donnell, I: Session one.

The wiper blades thrashed backwards and forwards against the driving rain. Muddy water

ran in rivulets down the windscreen of the truck each time the wheels hit a furrow in the road.

The wind seemed to have forced the damp outside in through the seams of the windows and

through the ventilation, so we felt scarcely any warmer or drier inside than it appeared

outside. Six hours of travel had exhausted conversation; we were a morose company that

travelled through the late afternoon towards the Cairngorms.

I glanced momentarily away from the road to look at the pale, drawn face of Marie, my sister-

in-law. “You OK?”

She nodded faintly. “Is it much further?”

“Another hour or so,” answered Bryan from the back seat, where he was huddled next to a

sleeping Richard.

I turned back to the road. I envied them their chance to rest. We had only just returned from

a tour of duty overseas and the last thing we needed was this ridiculous journey to the wilds

of Scotland. I had arrived home to a frantic phone message left by Marie, saying that David

was missing. To be honest, if that had been all it was, I would probably not have responded

– we were well used to him going off for days and sometimes weeks at a time, then rocking

up as if nothing had happened.

But this time was different: this time he had my nephew, David Junior, with him. In my mind,

he was scarcely out of nappies and, although David tended to idolize him and think he was

capable of any adventure, the lad was too young for his father’s hare-brained escapades… I

didn’t care that he was with his father: his mother was out of her head with worry and David

needed to treat her with more respect. As for Junior, he needed to be prepping for his

exams, not galivanting around the forest like a latter-day Indiana Jones.

Finally arriving in the car park of the ranger’s station after what felt like forever, we

scrambled stiffly out into the eternal rain and headed to the ranger’s office. The warmth was

welcome – but not as welcome as the sight of Alby - my brother’s dog - and the sound of his

excited whimpering. As I examined Alby under the guise of ear-tugs and tummy-rubs, I felt a

new sense of urgency rising inside of me: Alby was emaciated and filthy, his usually silky,

predominantly white fur was matted and bloody.

“Oh, you know this scruffy mutt, then?” the ranger enquired, laconically. “I was waiting for the

warden to take him to the kennels. It wandered in yesterday. Can’t have it molesting

wildlife…”

He was interrupted by Richard raising the latched entry and invading the warden’s kitchen

area. When the warden objected, Richard stared, stopping him in his tracks. He poured

water into a bowl, placed it in front of a grateful Alby, then stooped to peer in the fridge for

dog-friendly items.

Watching Alby devour a ham sandwich as if he’d never eaten in his life, I glared at the

Ranger. “This dog belongs to my brother, David Donnell – the David Donnell who is out there

working for you lot. Did you at least see if anyone was out there?”



“Oh. That commission ended ages ago. I just thought he hadn’t checked in before leaving.”

The warden shrugged, open-mouthed. “Happens all too often with these know-it-alls who

think they can do our jobs better than we ca…”

His words were silenced by Richard’s sudden grip on his shirt collar. “How long ago,

exactly?” he snarled.

“Um… um…” he stuttered. “Two weeks? Three? I’m not sure…”

“Iain – look at this.” Bryan, who had been gently examining Alby for injuries and coaxing

briars and other vegetation out from his fur and harness, held out the remnants of a notepad

that had been wedged between Alby and his harness.

The cover, once dark blue but now muddied and sodden, still bore David’s name. A few

pages remained inside – but as much as we needed answers, the pages were saturated and

would need to dry before we could read them. Bryan gently lifted Alby’s rangy frame and

cradled him in his coat, whilst Richard decisively escorted the ranger to his desk to verify

dates and details: we needed to find out as much as possible about my brother’s business

there and we needed to construct a timeline.

That being done, we headed for the cottage we had rented near Grantown. A log fire lit, a

newly washed and fed Alby snoring in front of it, and food warming, lifted our spirits

considerably. True, we hadn’t found David and Junior – but Alby’s return suggested that they

were still in the area.

Bryan’s efforts to recover information from the notebook indicated that it was David’s journal.

It also revealed that accompanying them was Daniel Booth, a zoologist from a southern

university. Bryan used directory enquiries to acquire a number and rang. The call confirmed

that he, too, had not returned – but as he had applied for a sabbatical, that wasn’t entirely

unexpected and had not raised any alarm.

As we ate the hearty stew Bryan had brought from his freezer, we planned our course of

action.

“Well, the journal did mention that it should take them about six days,” Bryan stated. “And

the first entry was on April 1 st – so they are about two weeks overdue.”

Marie looked stricken. “But how could they be missing all that time and no-one know? It’s a

well-traversed area!”

I tried to reassure her. “Look, if one of them got injured, they would be seriously held up.

They couldn’t exactly call for help, could they? And they couldn’t log a route with the

wardens, given that their task was exploratory.” I paused, trying to mask my own anxiety.

“Besides, they know how to hunt and forage – they could survive for weeks out there…”

“The commission they were on was in an uncharted section of the national park anyway.”

Bryan explained between mouthfuls. “a section they’ve called “Aibheis”.”

“What the hell does that mean?” I asked.

“Abyss,” Richard said bluntly.

“Yes – abyss,” Bryan agreed. “I’ve recovered the majority of the information of the first two

days of their journey. They appear to have gone roughly fourteen miles into the section of

wood. But read this bit here, Iain.” Bryan handed me the diary with a marker indicating where

I needed to read from.



“…we made another discovery which has left all of us confused: early in the afternoon,

approaching a narrow gorge, Alby was alerted to something nearby and darted off. This was

sufficiently odd for us to react: unless commanded, he usually stayed glued to Junior’s side.

The way he was excitedly barking and scrabbling suggested that Alby was being summoned

by someone he recognised – but that was clearly impossible. When we finally caught up with

Alby, we found him digging eagerly at a humped mound covered by tussocks of coarse

grass. As we approached where he had scratched away the mud, there was a sudden thud

as a larger piece of turf fell. Beneath it, just visible, appeared to be a man-made structure;

this was no natural formation – that sharp corner could only have been created by the

careful placement of interlocking stones.

Birdsong was abruptly hushed. Our intrusion into their terrain had clearly disturbed them.

The short March afternoon was almost over. Failing light and the need to establish a camp

dictated that we must leave off further investigation. We set up camp hastily, abuzz about the

wonders that we might discover the following day…”



“So… they found something?” Marie asked, a glimmer of hope lighting her worry-dulled

eyes. “That explains it, they must be digging. Alby probably just got lost and they’re just

hoping he gets back to them.”

I stared at Marie. I felt awful about how my brother treated her at times. The worst thing

about it is that it’s not even intentional cruelty; he simply becomes so self-absorbed that he

doesn’t think about the impact on those around him. As messed up as it is, if he had been

hitting her, I’d know how to deal with him. But we’ve all tried to make him think about his

actions more and he’s never taken it on board.

I almost agreed with her hypothesis: however, the look on Bryan’s face suggested there was

something he didn’t want Marie to see. I didn’t have to wait long to get my answer as very

shortly after dinner Marie retired to her room, with the faint flicker of hope allowing her mind

to rest.

As soon as she was out of earshot Bryan pulled out another page and handed it to me. “She

doesn’t need to know this yet.” Bryan said. A much darker mood had taken over. “But if we’re

going in there we need to be ready.”

I opened the page; it was marked four days later than the second entry. Not all of the words

were legible, but the remnants weren’t words I wanted to see.



“…under any circumstance come to try find me or…”

“…I have allowed our son to fall victim to…”

“…me and I hope to see you again in the next life…”

“…brother, I know you….

“…sure Marie is okay…”

“…My last stand will be tonight….”

“…DO NOT attempt to find… or the cairn…”



We all analysed these words for a long time. No one knew what to say; no one knew how to

describe how they felt.

“Is that all we have?” I asked Bryan.

“I’m afraid so, Iain,” Bryan said, downing his beer. “There are four days completely

unaccounted for. It’s your family, Iain, and I’m sorry I even have to say this, but we may well

be doing a recovery. Not a search and rescue.”

My mind was racing, I was too exhausted to process how much my life may well have

changed in the last twelve hours - but if I was going in there I needed to try to let it sink in.

“Last stand?” I said to myself, almost annoyed by the ridiculousness of the phrase. “He’s

dragged the boy out into the middle of God knows what. May have got him… killed? And

now is going to have some kind of last stand like he’s fucking Rambo?”

“Keep your head on, Iain,” Richard piped up. “We’ll get the answers we need.”

“I can’t ask either of you to join me on this, lads. If something really has killed them, I can’t

risk getting you two killed too.”

“You never ‘asked’ us to come up here with you, Iain. We just joined you because that’s what

we do.” Richard stood staring me straight in the eyes, the flames reflecting in his. “If you’re

going in, we are too.”",1,1752591487.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,0.99,False
1m0jzq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1m0jzq2/misconceptions_in_dating_about_psychological/,Misconceptions in dating about psychological profiling,"I see so many posts daily dropping the buzzwords that we are picking up in therapy, being over 40, I imagine a LOT of us have been there, are still there, or maybe will forever be there.

The ""buzzwords"" I see frequently are narcissist, avoidant, anxious attached, gaslighting, love bombing, red flag, etc.

I just wanted to take a minute and say that these words or definitions are way over used and losing meaning quickly.

If Jake or Jill doesn't respond to your text in 24+ hours, and it's not due to an emergency, or the likes, they have a very good chance, that are not actually avoidant, but just an asshole or a cunt.

If Jake or Jill seems to go full force into the relationship on a second date, and are ""smitten"" maybe they aren't anxious attached, maybe they are a dry sponge trying to soak up some of that good feeling, and when getting full will slow down a bit. Just love or attention starved.

If Jake or Jill tells you that 9/10 people prefer to sweep up a coffee spill instead of mop it up, maybe they aren't gaslighting, but just full of shit and/or mistaken.

If Jake or Jill tells you they think they are falling in love on the 3rd date, perhaps they aren't love bombing, but really feel some kind of feeling, and perhaps it's good they are honest with you about that feeling as they feel those feels.

If Jake or Jill spills the catsup at dinner and while cleaning it misses a spot, maybe it's not a  red flag that they will expect you to clean up after then the rest of their lives.

Go out there, find your love, and treat them like you want to be treated in whatever step of the relationship you are in.

If you are already dating someone seriously, keep it up, for about as long as the relationship lasts, the Universe willing, it will be the rest of your lives.

Be careful trying to always assign something a label. People are still assholes, that doesn't make them avoidant, people still fall in love at first sight, that doesn't make them codependent or anxious.

Go out and love!

This month, we're taking on Lue Elizondo’s memoir, Imminent. From his unique upbringing and military background to his inside-the-Pentagon perspective on UAP disclosure, this book is packed with bold and fascinating topics.  
  
Our website is [www.ProjectBookClub.net](http://www.ProjectBookClub.net)  
  
In this episode, we'll need a second cup of coffee to dive deep into Elizondo’s revelations about crash retrievals, biologics, Roswell, and the super-secret Interloper program. We'll also talk about his focus on consciousness, national security, and the challenges of having this conversation.  
  
Our back-and-forth conversation reflects on the book’s tone, structure, and impact, acknowledging both its strengths and the questions it raises. We take on the book's balance between personal storytelling and hard evidence, and why Imminent feels like a major milestone in the growing world of serious UAP literature.  
  
Whether you’re a die-hard fan of Elizondo’s journey or just starting to explore this topic, we hope our conversation will give you both insight and appreciation for one of the most talked-about books in the field.  
  
If you want to get started early, BTW, next month our book is Encounters by Diane Pasulka.

1m0jyiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m0jyiq/does_the_oxo_brew_9_cup_coffee_maker_review_prove/,Does the OXO Brew 9 Cup Coffee Maker Review Prove It’s Worth Buying?,"I’ve been testing the **OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker** for a few weeks now, and it’s quickly become a staple in my kitchen. Known for its sleek design and precision brewing capabilities, this coffee maker promises rich, flavorful coffee every time. While it does live up to several of these claims, there are details worth exploring—both good and not-so-good. Here's my genuine experience with it.

**Exceptional Brewing Performance**  
The brewing quality of this machine is impressive. It uses the BetterBrew Precision Brewing control, which keeps the water temperature in the ideal range of 197.6-204.8°F. As a coffee enthusiast, I appreciate how this machine evenly saturates the coffee grounds via the Rainmaker showerhead. This ensures maximum flavor extraction and consistency in every brew. Whether it’s just me needing two cups during a rushed morning or hosting friends and brewing a full pot, the flavor output remains remarkable.

[Find the best price for OXO 8710100 Brew Coffee Maker on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/)

**Aesthetics and Build Quality**  
What initially caught my eye was the modern yet functional design. The coffee maker features a stainless steel silver exterior, paired with black details, giving it a premium look that fits perfectly into my kitchen aesthetic. Beyond appearance, the build feels robust. While not the lightest machine at 10.5 pounds, the weight lends it a stable and durable feel.

**User Convenience**  
Using this coffee maker feels intuitive. The single-dial interface simplifies the process of setting up brew sizes and programming the automatic wake-up timer. I’ve used the programmable timer on several mornings, waking up to the inviting aroma of freshly brewed coffee—a definite perk for anyone with a hectic schedule.

The pause-and-pour feature has been my savior on impatient mornings. Halfway through brewing, I could sneak a cup without compromising the coffee’s temperature or taste. Also, the freshness timer is a surprisingly useful feature, allowing me to decide whether the remaining coffee in the carafe is worth reheating or not.

**Key Benefits**  
- Exceptional brewing temperature control for optimal flavor.  
- Internal mixing tube ensures every sip tastes consistent.  
- Stylish stainless steel thermal carafe keeps coffee hot for hours.

**Some Drawbacks**  
Not everything about this machine is perfect. There are certain areas where the coffee maker falls short.  
- A bit bulky for compact kitchens; its dimensions (8.3"" D x 15"" W x 17.2"" H) require ample counter space.  
- The paper filter design might not appeal to those who prefer reusable options.  
- Many users have noted reliability concerns over time, though I haven’t encountered long-term issues yet.

**Competitive Options**  
The market is flooded with drip coffee machines, so naturally, comparisons are inevitable. For instance, the Breville Precision Brewer offers customizable brewing modes, which is something this model from OXO lacks. However, the Breville’s interface feels more complicated compared to the simplicity of this coffee brewer. On the budget side, there’s the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1, which makes excellent coffee but sacrifices the consistency of water temperature control found in the OXO machine. For those specifically valuing flavor extraction and user-friendly design, this product stands out, but it doesn't offer the same level of flexibility as some competitors.

**Price Worthiness**  
For the features it offers, this coffee maker provides solid value. While it sits at a higher price point compared to standard coffee makers, the price strikes a balance with the brewing precision, thermal carafe, and added perks like the freshness timer. It's an investment for those who genuinely prioritize their coffee experience. If budget is not your primary concern, this brewer delivers satisfying results without unnecessary complexity.

I used to live at point-pleasant, west Virginia. But, After high school, I moved out for collage, And never really came back. Sure, a few visits to my dad here and there, but, nothing longer than a few days. Until one day, I got a letter, it was from my old high-school.  
It read something along the lines of ""Hey! We're holding a reunion party for the old students of point-pleasant high school! Hope you can come join us for the party!"" The letter was, unexpected. But, it was nothing out of the ordinary. Every class had one of these.  
I remember when I was still in high school, me and 2 of my friends would sneak in one of these reunions, we got so drunk that one of my friends couldn't stop puking for the entire night. We were having a sleep over at one of their houses, and their parents weren't home for a few days, so we didn't get in any trouble, that night at least. The next day, me and the other friend that was staying over at, lets call him ""David"" went home. My dad wasn't that mad about it, somehow. He was pretty loose with rules. Just no drugs, no hurting other people, and Always tell him where I'm at every few hours until midnight if I'm at someone else's place. I miss him.  
Sorry, I'm rambling. After I got the letter, I packed my bags and flew back to the place that I once called ""home""  
As soon as I arrived at the airport, I rented a car, and started driving. It was 1 am on the highway. Luckily I was high on caffeine and wasn't falling asleep on the wheel. thanks to the coffee I packed along the way. But something bothered me, it was like this gut wrenching feeling of dread. Maybe, it was just all in my head, I Did down the equivalent of 3 cups of coffee in an hour or two, that wasn't such a good idea after all. That feeling of fear and dread kept going for at least an hour more.

then, it suddenly got halted by the sound of my phone ringing. I went and took a quick glance at my phone, it was a random unknown number. ""probably a scam"" I said dismissingly.

I quickly took my vision back on the road, that's when I see it, a shadowy figure appeared in front of my car. my body instantly jolted and turned my steering wheel. And before I knew it, I was going to hit a tree. I blacked out for only what I could assume to be 30 or so minutes before waking up. My eyes were heavy, but I had to get out of my car. I opened the drivers seat door and fell onto the dirt.

Suddenly, I felt this jolt of pain on my left leg, I didn't dare to look at it. Because, I could feel that my femur has popped out of my leg. I crawled on the ground getting away from my now burning car. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. My arms and right leg grew tired, the pain would intensify every time I even slightly moved. I gave up, at that moment, I truly gave up. Then it all stopped. The pain and anguish. It got cut out by that gut wrenching feeling again. And then, I saw it. Illuminated by the fire coming from my car, covering the surrounding darkness with a blanket of orange, I saw it.

A man, covered in white glistering fur, it had wings as big as tree branches, it was around 6 to 7 feet tall. I looked at its glowing red eyes, its shine beating the orange tint of the fire. But, I wasn't, scared? Well, I was, but I wasn't scared for my safety, no. Looking at it gave me a sense of comfort I've never felt before. The fear came from what it said to me. I still remember it to this day. The creature spoke, in a high pitched, raspy, and almost animal like voice ""Don't go"".

What was it trying to tell me? Why was its message so short? And matter of fact, what even was ""it""? Before I could even process what it just said, it jumped up, and flew away into the night sky. its fur, mixed with the shine of the moon light and the blazing fire behind me. Made it look, beautiful.

My head fell onto the grass. The next thing I know, I was being treated by paramedics, I could hear people talking, I could see the light of the ambulance and fire trucks, I was saved. The next few weeks I had to spend my time at the hospital. My friends and my family visited, and my girlfriend stayed with me at the hospital.

A few days later, the night of the reunion, I was on a hospital bed. having nothing else to do, I turned on the tv, and what I heard, made my stomach turn. ""Yearly high school reunion tradition at pleasant point ended in tragedy after a gas leak caused a fire to break out"".

I am now living happily with my former girlfriend, now wife, far away from point pleasant. So if you ever plan to go there, just beware of The Night butterfly.",1,1752591132.0,creepcast,0,0.99,False

I made this plan last week, it’s not for sale a it’s already been sold.

Glenn and his grandson redid the plumbing in his house together and he wanted to use the pipes as a partial trade. Since he was getting the pan for his grandson, I thought it would be fitting to melt down some of the copper and use it as an accent. 

Im particularly happy with how the pan turned out and where it’s going

Not everything I do is like this, but the older I get it feels more important to design my work in a way that adds meaning alongside of form and function. I love making objects people will love and use, but I’m very sentimental and adding little things like this bring me joy. 

I always felt like there was a subtle magic to sentiment, it’s the reason why you don’t just throw out grandpa’s old furniture, or maybe your mom‘s old folding chair. Not because they’re made so well but because they hold memories. 

Anyway, my coffee is getting low and I better be getting to work. let me know what you think about the pan, it’s something still have because it holds memories",17,1752591116.0,cookware,8,0.91,False

1m0jsqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pimsleur/comments/1m0jsqf/my_experience_of_two_weeks_in_italy_after_using/,My Experience of Two Weeks in Italy after Using Pimsleur for Nearly One Year,"I have been using Pimsleur for nearly one year focusing on Italian. (I know this because my 1 year subscription will renew at the end of the month). I just got back from a two week trip to Italy and wanted to share my experience of trying to speak Italian and potentially help others who are looking at Pimsleur to help with travel conversations.

I will start with a lot of disclaimers.

* I use the Pimsleur app Monday - Friday on my morning commute to work. I am very regular with this and do not skip work days, but if I was not driving to work, I did not do a lesson that day.
* I redo the same lesson multiple times until I feel that I have achieved some level of mastery over the content. There were many lessons that I spent at least 3 separate days doing the same lesson.
* In one year of using the app, I was only able to complete Levels 1 and 2 successfully (what I determined was successful).
* I made it to about Level 2 Lesson 15 early on in my practice and decided that I was missing some of the basics and decided to start over again at Level 1 Lesson 1. I felt much more confident after repeating Levels 1 and the first half of Level 2, but again I may have taken an additional 2-3 days to complete the same lesson again.
* I did not use anything other than the audio lessons in the app. I tried occasionally to use the other features, but was never committed to it.
* About a month before my trip, I made it to Level 3 and started with Lesson 1, but it was too different / advanced for where I was and realized there was an updated version of Levels 1 and 2, so I restarted with the Updated Level 2 which used much more informal conversation than the original content. I did not do Updated Level 1.
* I used Duolingo a tiny bit during this as well. Much, much less time than using Pimsleur. No streak at all in Duolingo.

During my two weeks in Italy, I was disappointed, but not discouraged by my ability to communicate in Italian. Firstly, nearly everyone I interacted with in Italy spoke English and would default to speaking English to me unless I was very purposeful in speaking Italian. I spent time in Cinque Terre, Florence, Venice, and Milan. Literally everyone that was in a position to interact with a tourist spoke English. The only exception to the English first conversations was in the Dolomites where I was in South Tyrol and the people mostly spoke German.

After one year of Pimsleur, the only conversations I was able to successfully have fully in Italian were ordering breakfast. My best interaction was definitely in Florence where I was able to talk to the barista, order coffees for my wife and myself and a cup of milk for my 5-year-old daughter as well as some croissants. The barista asked if I wanted the milk hot or cold. She then looked looked at my daughter and in Italian asked what her name was. I understood right away and told my daughter in English and had her respond in English. The barista then asked how old she was and I was able to respond properly in Italian.

I had several other similar interactions, but they were all very similar. I was able to use bits and pieces of what I knew to start a conversation, but mostly the locals would switch to English. When I was initiating a conversation that I knew was going to be above my level of comprehension, I was able to ask if they spoke English and let them know I understand a little Italian.

That said, I was disappointed that I didn't have more conversations in Italian. I feel like I have been working hard to learn the language and then used it very little. I believe the people that I did successfully communicate with were impressed / happy to see a tourist at least try to communicate in their language.

Other things I noticed and critiques of the Pimsleur vocabulary. I used way less verbs than Pimsleur is trying to teach me. Many of the lessons are formed around ""I would like..."" or ""I want..."" but I failed to start with those words and just went into the nouns. Instead of saying ""I would like an American coffee,"" I would simply say ""one American coffee."" The second would be that I didn't know enough nouns. Most of my interactions were with waiters / baristas, hotel staff, and clerks at stores. I did not have the words to begin to have the conversations I wanted to have. Simple things such as apple and banana would bring me to a halt and cause the conversation to immediately switch to English even if I wanted to bring it back to Italian.

All of this said, upon returning from vacation, I have continued where I left off and plan to continue working with the Pimsleur app so that the next trip to Italy can be even more successful.",7,1752591018.0,Pimsleur,4,0.9,False

Well, the second I step in, this one employee, who always seems to have something to say, hits me with, “Well, you should have known I was gonna tell you to park if you were doing a mobile order.” And then just walks off before I could even respond.

And this isn’t a one-off thing. He always throws some backhanded comment my way like I’m messing up their sacred process or something. It’s just weird. Like he’s trying to make me feel dumb for... ordering coffee?

I don’t get what his deal is. Maybe he’s just bitter about life and I’m a convenient punching bag. Maybe he hates mobile orders. Maybe I remind him of his high school bully. Who knows.

At night I sit ecstatic at the loom weaving forgiveness into our worldly regrets. All day I listen to the radio of your memories. Yes, I know every secret you thought too dark to tell me, and love you more for everything you feared might make me love you less. When you cry I guide your tears toward the garden of kisses I once planted on your cheek, so you know they are all perennials. Forgive me, for not being able to weep with you. One day you will understand. One day you will know why I read the poetry of your grief to those waiting to be born, and they are all the more excited. There is nothing I want for now that we are so close I open the curtain of your eyelids with my own smile every morning. I wish you could see the beauty your spirit is right now making of your pain, your deep seated fears playing musical chairs, laughing about how real they are not. My love, I want to sing it through the rafters of your bones, Dying is the opposite of leaving. I want to echo it through the corridor of your temples, I am more with you than I ever was before.  Do you understand? It was me who beckoned the stranger who caught you in her arms when you forgot not to order for two at the coffee shop. It was me who was up all night gathering sunflowers into your chest the last day you feared you would never again wake up feeling lighthearted.

**Summary**

Lohkamp takes the Cadillac to Pat's building. He blows the horn and wakes people up. Pat leaves just fine. He suggests a nice restaurant. She thinks it will be boring. He suggests Alfons, a beer garden. She agrees. They both order whiskeys, pork chops, and sauerkraut which impresses Alfons.

They go for a drive through the town. She never learned how to drive, so he lets her take the wheel. Pat gets used to steering and stopping. They go to a bar. Valentin and Lenz are there. Lohkamp wishes they'd leave. Lenz takes them to an amusement park. They ride a merry-go-round and the [devil's wheel.](https://share.google/blzo3ucPHN7mjqJu8) Lenz lands in the arms of Lina who proceeds to get drunk. Lenz wins a whole kit of goods at the ring toss. He was the best bomb thrower in the war. They won teddy bears, a coffee maker, and a pram among other things. They give it all away except for the liquor. 

Blumenthal calls and wants a test drive. The garage guys build up Lohkamp like he's going into battle. Mr Blumenthal works in an office in the woolen trade. He is a tough negotiator. They go for a drive to his home to meet his wife. He knew Lohkamp's tactics well and was impressed. He writes a check right there for more than expected. The car will be delivered tomorrow. He invites Lohkamp to dinner the next day.

At the garage, the baker and his new wife were picking a color of varnish. She spots the Cadillac and sits in it. Lenz thought he missed a big opportunity to sell. Lohkamp tells him he doesn't sell a car twice. They cash the check and take Karl for a spin to celebrate.

Bob pays his rent early which shocks his landlady. He asks to borrow two nice armchairs to entertain his “cousin.” He borrows a lamp from the Hasses and a gramophone from Erna Bönig. 

Pat says she can't come over because she has an important interview. Lohkamp can't accept it. She can take a short walk instead. She smells lilac, but it's too early for it. A gardener says it's [Daphne indica.](https://share.google/TfglMPartmB9yWOov) 

The meeting is with Binding and someone else. Lohkamp is jealous. He's just a nobody compared to him. He says hello to all the seedy people walking the streets because he has nothing left to lose with her. Pat laughs at his childishness. They kiss, and she's gone. 

Lohkamp buys some [bockwurst](https://share.google/uLTGHi9UiPzBxi8Op) from Mother who has a food stand on the corner. She has to keep working because her husband lost his legs in an accident and became addicted to morphine and other men. Lohkamp got his neighbor Georg to eat the food meant for Pat. Then he called her with a coat and blanket over him to muffle the sound.

Lohkamp and Lenz are the pit crew for the big race. Pat, Valentin, and Ferdinand Grau are there, too. Pat's mom was English and had the same name. Koster gets to drive Karl the flivver with Joop in the passenger seat. Other drivers and mechanics trash talk Karl. They are second to last then fourth place. There was no time to change tires. Koster edges Karl ahead of number three and number two. Then he beat the Nutcracker driven by Braumuller. They won a silver cup and some money. 

Bob and Pat walk through the fog to a bench in the cemetery. [The Salvation Army band](https://share.google/IiWSmgEcNJmqAFqRh) plays a hymn very loud because they know couples go in there for privacy. They go back to his room re-outfitted with shabby furniture. She sees a suitcase he borrowed from Lenz and thinks he's traveled all over. He keeps up the lie with stories that Lenz told him. The lights from outside shine on Pat's chest and neck in his bed. She asks to be held and falls asleep. He walks her home in the morning and buys her tulips to be delivered before noon.

Lohkamp and Koster attend an auction to buy a taxi. There are pieces of furniture and books from the desperate and destitute being sold. The pitiful looking man who used to drive the taxi was there. A cocky man named Thiess thinks he can make a deal with them. Koster and Lohkamp outbid him. They tell Albert, the former owner, that they may need a driver some day.

The baker picks up his Ford. He misses his first wife, a frugal saint. Lohkamp suggests he get her portrait painted by Ferdinand Grau. The baker goes back home to get two pictures of her. Grau’s prices are too high. He can afford a profile, but it would be too hard to paint. Then they negotiate a full face for 10% off and an advance. The portraits in his studio are unclaimed or unpaid commissions. After the baker left, he tells Lohkamp that he says one picture is of a princess to get more money. The illusion sustains people.

1m0jr15,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m0jr15/does_the_bonavita_5_cup_coffee_maker_deliver_a/,Does the Bonavita 5 Cup Coffee Maker Deliver? A Detailed Review Awaits!,"**Compact Design and Space Efficiency**  

As someone who values simplicity and a clutter-free kitchen countertop, the compact design of the Bonavita BV1500TS stood out right away. Measuring just 6.2 inches in depth, 12.3 inches in width, and 10.6 inches in height, this coffee maker slots neatly into tight spaces. Perfect for those of us with limited kitchen real estate or for anyone looking for a sleek, modern appliance that doesn’t dominate the room. The black and silver stainless steel finish complements most kitchen decors effortlessly. I’ll admit, it feels satisfying looking at such a sophisticated, minimalist gadget first thing in the morning.

[Check Bonavita BV1500TS price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b00sk5ixpq/)  

**One-Touch Brewing Simplicity**  

After owning coffee makers with more buttons than I knew what to do with, the single-touch operation on this model felt wonderfully refreshing. Brewing coffee becomes as simple as pressing a button—literally. Its automatic operation mode ensures I never have to hover over the machine, yet it brews up to five cups (25 ounces) in no time. Surprisingly, I found its pour-over brewing method effective at mimicking the hand-brewed taste. Plus, there's an optional pre-infusion mode which wets the coffee grounds before brewing. This little tweak really helped extract maximum flavor from my freshly roasted beans. You can tell someone thought about the coffee-making experience while developing this feature.  

**Thermal Carafe and Heat Retention**  

Coffee staying hot long enough has always been one of my gripes with home coffee makers. The double-wall stainless steel thermal carafe on this Bonavita machine has changed the game. It doesn’t just keep your coffee hot for hours—it maintains the flavor too. I often pour a cup before starting work, then go back for a second cup an hour or two later without needing reheating. Even during weekend brunches with friends, the carafe kept everyone’s refills just as warm as the first pour.  

**Merits**  

- Compact form factor ideal for small kitchens  
- Easy-to-use single-touch operation  
- Thermal carafe efficiently retains heat  
- Pre-infusion mode enhances flavor extraction  

**Reusable Filter and Eco-Friendliness**  

Using a coffee machine every day also means dealing with the environmental impact of paper filters. Luckily, this one comes equipped with a reusable filter, which provides convenience and reduces waste. Cleaning it was a breeze too, and although I initially worried about sediment sneaking through, the reusable filter has handled fine-ground beans pretty well.  

**Drawbacks**  

- Might brew too little for larger households  
- Lacks advanced customization options found in pricier models  

**Competing Products**  

Comparing this to similar models like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the OXO Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker reveals some interesting strengths and weaknesses. The Bonavita BV1500TS is far more compact, and its thermal carafe impressed me more than the glass one in the Moccamaster. However, the Moccamaster offers better build quality and larger brewing capacity, which might appeal to bigger families. Meanwhile, the OXO Brew delivers comparable taste but includes features like a programmable start timer the Bonavita doesn’t have. This leaves the Bonavita well-suited for small households or solo coffee drinkers looking for simplicity without compromising on flavor.  

**Quality for Price**  

Although the Bonavita BV1500TS isn’t the cheapest coffee machine, you’re getting a lot of value packed into this small package. Between its durable stainless steel construction, ease of use, and ability to brew legitimately great-tasting coffee, I’d call it a smart investment. If you’re not someone who needs added bells and whistles, and you appreciate eco-friendly features, this machine fits the bill.

Coding while someone is watching can feel intimidating, even for seasoned pros. That’s why it’s essential to be prepared, both technically and mentally.

We’ve been through plenty of these interviews ourselves (with some great successes and a few brutal failures), so here’s our advice for navigating the process.

**Before You Apply...**

**Master the Basics.**  
If you’re 50/50 on something at home, odds are it will be closer to 0 in a situation where you are timed and someone is watching.

**Practice, practice, practice!**  
Look for practice problems online to test your fundamentals. Leetcode, W3Schools, and many other sites and blogs can be found with a quick search.

Find real-world data sets in the Maven Analytics Data Playground or elsewhere with multiple tables. Kaggle and [Data.World](http://Data.World) are amazing too, especially if you want specific types of data. You can also create your own case studies by writing a list of questions you want to answer with the tool you’ll be interviewing with.

Once you start solving most practice problems, practice with strict time limits to replicate the interview experience and improve your efficiency.

If you have a friend or classmate who is comfortable with the tool, do mock interviews with them.

This next part is important... don't wait until you think you're ""totally ready"" to start applying. It might take a while to land an interview, so you can keep practicing in parallel while you're trying to get your first employer responses.

**When You Get Invited to Interview...**

**Research the company.**  
How will the tool be used in the role? What types of data might be common at this company? This can help you better focus your practice.

Ask your recruiter if they can provide any example questions or a list of topics the interview might cover. You won’t always get additional information, but it never hurts to ask.

You can often find coding questions a company has asked online, on sites like Glassdoor. While you likely won’t get asked the exact same questions, you will get a better sense of the concepts you need to master.

**The Day Before...**

**Don’t cram!**  
While we suggest doing an hour or so of focused practice the day before the interview to stay sharp, you’re unlikely to significantly improve your skills at this point.

Trying to cram new concepts will cut into the time you could use for general interview prep, like preparing questions for the interviewer or researching the company.

**Get a good night’s sleep.**  
Being well-rested will ensure you are mentally sharp and will help reduce anxiety.

**The Morning Of...**

**Limit your caffeine intake.**  
You’ll likely have plenty of nervous energy already. We’re not saying skip your usual coffee, but maybe avoid the triple espresso right before the interview. You want to stay calm and focused.

**Practice positivity.**  
Listen to your favorite song, meditate, call a good friend, laugh. There is no last-minute studying that will change the outcome now, but getting into a positive mindset can absolutely make you a better interviewee.

**During the Interview...**

**Make it a two-way conversation.**  
This advice is everywhere because it works. When you are given a question (SQL, Python, or Excel), you are absolutely expected to:

* Ask clarifying questions about the data and metrics they want you to calculate.  
* State your assumptions. This helps the interviewer follow your thinking and will often prompt helpful guidance.  
* If you get stuck, tell your interviewer. In many cases, they’ll give you a hint or move you on to another question.  

**Don’t sit there in silence.**  
As folks who have been on both sides of the table, there is nothing more awkward than seeing a candidate struggling in silence. We want you to succeed. We want to hear how you’re thinking and why you’re making certain choices.

**Try to make it fun.**  
If you make a mistake or two but are engaged, positive, and collaborative, you will leave a much better impression than someone who is technically perfect but freezes out the interviewer.

One mindset shift we love: treat interview questions like a fun puzzle you are solving with someone who likes puzzles too. This helps reduce anxiety and often improves performance.

**After the Interview...**

**Send a thank-you email** to your interviewer promptly.

**Practice self-care.**  
Regardless of how you feel about your performance, interview prep and interviewing are draining. Take care of yourself. Exercise, enjoy a good meal, relax.

**Reflect on the process.**  
Think about what went well, what didn’t, and what you can improve for next time. This will help you get better with each interview.

**Wrapping Up**  
  
To give you a sense of how these can go: we’ve been the interviewee in many coding interviews and the interviewer in even more. Some went great. Others didn’t.

One time, we performed so poorly we were asked to leave the interview early. Another time, we answered all the questions perfectly but weren’t recommended because we didn’t talk through our thought process.

You won’t be the only candidate who can use the tool. Demonstrating communication and collaboration is critical.

Some of our best interviews were for roles we didn’t even want. Because the stakes felt low, our anxiety was low, and we let our personality and skills shine.

**Remember these key points:**

**Interviewing is often arbitrary.**   
Humans are part of the process. Sometimes you catch the interviewer on a bad day. Sometimes the role is already filled internally. You can’t control these things.

**You can’t take failure personally.**   
Bad interviews happen. They are practice. Learn from them and move on. Don’t get stuck in an anxiety loop. The more you practice, the better you will get.

**We believe in you.**   
We’ve never seen someone with a solid grasp of their tools and some interview coaching fail to land an analyst role eventually. It might take 1 interview or 10, but persistence will win.

We hope you found this guide helpful. Best of luck!",2,1752590801.0,mavenanalytics,2,0.76,False

I have attempted to use ChatGPT and Gemini to follow the template and change the text but it doesn’t seem to follow my format and wants to spit it out which takes longer. I want it to track all my changes “in its head” then print it out when needed.

For example, I have a client going to Vietnam in Nov 15 to 18, I will just tell it and it will tweak the planning accordingly. Then I want to type “Stay Hilton hotel Day 1. I want it to search the rewrite the command and fit it into the day 1 of the planning. Even writing a restaurant will allow it to rewrite into “Dine at xxx”.

Don’t brush your teeth right after eating acidic foods!","Why?  
Acidic foods and drinks (like citrus fruits, soda, coffee, or vinegar) temporarily soften your enamel. Brushing right after can actually **damage the enamel** more, leading to sensitivity and erosion over time.

 **What to do instead:**  
✅ Rinse your mouth with plain water.  
✅ Wait at least **30 minutes** before brushing.  
✅ This gives your saliva time to neutralize the acid and protect your enamel naturally.

I lived with two great theater folks who are moving out of state for new jobs, and would love to find 2 roommates, ideally women in their mid 20s-early 30s (flexible), who are clean, respectful, communicative, and financially responsible.

Two rooms available, Bedroom 1 ($1350) and Bedroom 3 ($1050) + utilities (electric and wifi, around $80/month; heat and water is included). Security deposit is 1 month’s rent. The photo of Bedroom 1 isn't amazing because of the stuff that's currently in there, but it is the bigger room!

Location:
- 15 min walk to the N/W line
- Steps away from local buses that connect you to many other trains (E, F, G, M, R, 7)
- ~30 min to Manhattan
- 10 min walk to the Astoria ferry and East River
- 15 min walk to Astoria Park
- Many nearby grocery stores (5 min walk away from a 24hr grocery store), coffee shops, libraries, 12 min walk away from Costco, and as we are in Astoria, proximity to some of the best restaurants in NYC!

Requirements:
- 40x rent or guarantors who make 80x rent
- Good credit score
- No pets
- No couples
- Non-smoker

About me: I am a 31-year-old counseling psychology PhD student at Fordham University, and will be working a hybrid schedule this year. I enjoy reading, going on walks across the city, trying new restaurants, and spending quality time with friends. I love cooking and baking and often share my creations with my roommates. Preference for individuals who don’t bring the party home, but open to movie nights and chill fun times. If you think we may be a good fit please send me a message!

Even their burrito has more carbs than I prefer. I could've done the ""big breakfast"" and throw out most of the carbs, but that seems wasteful. 

I'm in no way surprised that it's *hard* to find low carb food at McDonald's, but I'm a little surprised at how bad it really is.

I know it sounds crazy, but I am very expressive with my appearance (hair, clothes, makeup, tattoos, etc.) and I love to express myself through fragrance too!

Rainy day - maybe something a little more aquatic/ or a warm/cozy gourmand like a warm cup of coffee 

Glittery/Fairy makeup look - something green, with notes of maybe something sweet like berry, fig, or a fruit of some kind to really match that eccentric vibe

If I’m wearing a lot of pink or feeling flirty/feminine - sweet, strawberry or strawberry marshmallow 

Feeling a little serious or more reclused - something woody maybe even with notes like cedar, sandalwood, or bergamot

Feeling sick or need a little extra emotional support - something heavy with lavender, or something fresh like linen or sheets to make me thing about being calm in bed


I have a lot more scent matching that I do depending on the day. Let me know if yall do this, and I would LOVE to hear what scents y’all create depending on your mood/vibe!!! ",7,1752590450.0,FemFragLab,3,0.9,False

Hey everyone! I’ve noticed a common dream a lot of us share — growing our own food. But let’s be real… most people never get around to it because:
	•	They don’t know how to start
	•	They don’t have space (hello, apartment life!)
	•	They don’t have time or patience
	•	Or they’ve tried before and gave up because… life 😅

So here’s a simple idea I’m toying with:

👉 What if there was an app that let you lease a small garden bed in your city — super cheap, like the cost of a monthly coffee or two — and with just a few taps you could choose what you want to grow… and then? That’s it.

A local professional gardener does the planting, watering, pruning, all the dirty work. You get regular photo/video updates of your garden’s progress. And at harvest time, your veggies are delivered to your door — fresh, seasonal, and grown just for you.

Kinda like “owning a farm” but zero effort. You just enjoy the fun parts — choosing what to grow and receiving the fruits (and veggies) of your garden.

I’m a tech person, not a gardener, but I’m really keen to build this. I’m also exploring how to make it feel like a game, where you can level up, unlock new veggies, or even trade crops with others.

I’m based in Melbourne, but this idea can work anywhere. I’m also looking for a partner who might be into urban farming, gardening, or just passionate about food and sustainability.

🌿 So — would you use something like this?
💬 Why or why not?
🤔 What do you see as challenges? What would make it exciting for you?

Today I returned my Ninja 701.
I spent a month trying to get a decent cup of coffee from it. First of all, the coffee didn’t taste good—it was too bitter, no matter what we tried. It also bothered me that I couldn’t stop the brewing program midway. When we did try to interrupt it—because, for example, the cup was getting too full—two liters of water spilled out and flooded my kitchen.

The machine is oddly programmed. When I froth milk, I can’t grind coffee at the same time, which I really don’t understand. On top of that, I don’t think the thermoblock is designed properly. With the Sage, the machine is truly ready to use after just three seconds. I can steam the milk and it heats up immediately. With the Ninja, I have to wait as if I were waiting for better weather. So in the mornings, when I’m in a hurry to take my coffee to work, it takes six minutes with the Ninja. With the Sage, which also makes much better-tasting coffee, it only takes three.


I’m a big fan of the Ninja Air Fryer.
But unfortunately, both the Creamy last year and now the Ninja coffee machine have been disappointing.

So, I’m a bit of a black coffee guy. Like, I literally only drink it plain — no sugar, no milk, nothing.

Saw this video and it got me worried 😟 

But I’ve been hearing that in Thailand, especially with Thai women, sweet coffee (with condensed milk and all that) is kind of the standard — especially on casual dates or coffee meetups.

I have nothing against sweet coffee or people who love it! But what I’m a bit worried about is accidentally offending someone if I don’t order the same thing or if I politely say no when they suggest it.

I know it probably sounds like such a small thing, but in those first few meetups or dates, little things like that can matter, right?

Could this actually be a deal-breaker? Or am I just overthinking it? Would love to hear from any experienced expats or locals — how would you handle this kind of situation?",0,1752590273.0,Bangkok,38,0.3,False
1m0jgyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m0jgyz/unsure_about_this/,Unsure about this,"I’m seeking some advice..


Gf and I have been dating for almost a year, started off LDR now I moved halfway across the country for her. The day I’m leaving my old city and driving 14 hours to see her for a week/ get things moved in and set up. (We have stayed with each other consistently 1-4 weeks at a time over the year then I’d go back home again). She gets drunk, starts kinda belittling me on the phone call, I tell her after 30 minutes I don’t want to talk on the phone anymore. 

1. She did acknowledge belittling me and acting mean towards me.
2. I was supposed to stay at a hotel that night but instead I drove thru the night to her house, wanted to actually surprise her with breakfast..

So that all kinda backfired. After our call ended she sent a couple text messages explaining herself. I sent a long heartfelt message back and didn’t hear anything for 1.5 hours. Then she texted me, I love you goodnight.

Weird thing was, my message was stuck on delivered. So I finally get to her house, I notice she’s awake and home, I turn around to get coffee from right up the street (she hadn’t texted me back or read any messages yet) I’m guessing she saw me cuz then she asked if I had gotten a hotel. At this point I’m almost back to her house, the lights are all off I pull into the driveway. As I’m getting out and walking around the house to the front I see her bolt out the front door and into her car, I’m standing in plain view, I say her name and no response. She gets in the car and flies off down the street.

I call her and she says she’s getting coffee. I didn’t say much but once she got back I noticed.. she had taken her ring off that we wear kinda like promise rings at this point. 

Later that night I confront her about all this asking how she didn’t see me or.. hear my truck parked right next to her house. The dogs were barking, she bolted out and like fled down the street, took 20 minutes at the coffee shop, didn’t respond to
My messages?

She said.. she was drunk and mad at me?mind you she was the one who was being angry with me, not the other way around. She sent her last messages then said, “i powered off my phone, tried to go to sleep but couldn’t then took a shower then got food and went back to sleep”. I called her out on this, she admitted “I lied, I actually blocked you so that I wouldn’t keep trying to talk to you”. 

So this is all pretty strange, idk how she didn’t see me, she said she took her ring off that night as an act of defiance? Or acting out? I showed her the heartfelt message she never got because I was blocked, then was curious if that all was really what had occurred.. I can see from her online status’ on some socials she was up til 1am. 

Idk how I feel about this or what to do. She has said I can go thru her phone but that doesn’t feel right at all. Her other devices are all signed out or no longer syncing with iCloud, she has known my passwords this whole time but refused to share hers citing privacy, which I have respected. Any advice?

1m0jg8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m0jg8g/the_headsets_at_my_job_are_being_updated/,The headsets at my job are being updated,"Dozens of hands moved in a synchronized rhythm, each pair occupied with assembling pieces of a product whose purpose no longer mattered to us that built it. Fingers darted, twisted, pressed and secured parts with mechanical precision. Their owners spread along a factory line, their eyes looking elsewhere. These used to be jobs requiring full focus, now they have transformed into something entirely different.

A closer look behind the rectangular masks each one of them wore, one could see a worker's eye, unblinking and wide. Reflecting the flickering light of a screen. Next to the inner corner of the eye, near the tear duct, a thin clear silicone tube with a collection of wires inside ran out. Disappearing behind their cheekbone and around the ear. 

The screen showed a scene from a movie: a dramatic chase sequence. The worker’s pupil adjusting slightly as the action intensified. What was on their head was a sleek visual headset, wrapped around the upper half of their face, covering both eyes. From one nostril, another thin wire extended downward, slick with lubricant, trailing into a socket on a small device clipped onto their uniform.

Among them was one pair of hands. Mine. They moved with precision. I tightened screws, clicked plastic into place, the rhythm unbroken. I relaxed in the distant world inside my headset. A sudden laugh escapes my lips. A joke from the stream had landed perfectly! The joy of it echoed in a humming factory, otherwise verbally silent.

I prefer it this way, it's nice being able to escape.

Rows of my fellow workers, all wired, all engrossed in their virtual distractions, our bodies on autopilot. On the outside of the factory, a bright clean digital billboard glowed. It advertises yXX’s newest job platform with a cheerful slogan: “Work While Watching - Make Time Work for You”. People my age called these drone jobs, while corporate liked to call them: “Automated body careers.”

A buzzer rang, sharp and final. The shift was over.

I slowly removed my headset and blinked against the sudden change in light. With practiced ease, I pinched the tube near the corner of my eye and slid it free. A soft click, a faint sting. Then, the nasal wire followed, slick and warm. I tugged it from my nose and it coiled up. Around me others were doing the same, the ritual of unplugging reappeared across the room.

Over the Intercom we all heard the ding of an announcement.

“Crew we are happy to announce that tomorrow we will be having a mandatory meeting a half an hour before shift starts”

I groaned softly.

“We are one of the lucky locations that is being selected for the new yXX update and we need all employees here to go through the onboarding presentation. Thank you all. Again, arrive thirty minutes before your shift for the presentation” Another ding sounded, signaling the end of the announcement.

At the clock out station, one of my coworkers and long time friend named Natalie came over with bright eyes and an energetic grin that I returned to her.

“That’s great news we just got. I can finally work on sussing out this D&D campaign I’ve been writing.” She grabbed her bag out of her locker.

“How so?”

“Haven't you heard the rumors?” She stared at me for a moment waiting for a response. She shook her head in slight disapproval. “I guess not, huh? Well the update is going to let us do more than just watch streams or movies”

“Oh so you figure it'll have like a notepad program?”

“That's part of the rumor! Also a web browser. No more waiting until break or home to hash out ideas” Scanning her badge with a beep. “How lucky, one of the first facilities to test it in real time!”

“Hell yeah” I responded, genuinely enthused. “I’ve been wanting to read some comics instead of just streaming. I’ve gone through everything on my to watch backlog. It’s really perfect timing.”

She gave a faint smile. “Then, tomorrow is your day.”

I watched her head into her car as we parted ways in the parking lot. “See ya!” We waved goodbye as she got into her car.

——————————

The walk home was slow and quiet. Lights buzzed faintly overhead, and the hot breath of summer lingered in the air. I felt the familiar feeling of my legs aching and my shoulders heavy with fatigue. I rubbed my hands absentmindedly, the fingers still twitching slightly as if still assembling something.

My mind might be able to wander during work hours, but boy, my body is tired.

In the quiet comfort of my apartment, I reflected on the strange innovation that had become my reality. These headsets from yXX had changed everything. The old days of robotic automation had failed. Errors causing scrap, expensive maintenance, and just too much downtime.

Human minds, it turned out, were more reliable.

So, someone had the bright idea: keep the human brain, discard the conscious thought. With the right neural interface, the wires, the syncing, the gentle nudges to the motor cortex.

People could work without actually thinking about it. And while it paid 30% less than traditional automation jobs, it didn’t matter. The demand was overwhelming. People lined up for the chance to be a part of it.

I leaned back staring at the ceiling lost in thought, imagining what the new update would bring. “Soon.” a grin spread across my face

It won’t just be a glorified streaming box anymore. With programs? The possibilities are endless.

And somewhere far away, a quiet server farm hummed in agreement.

—————————————————-

I woke up and got ready for the morning. I fixed my short messy hair in the mirror. I was still tired, not from a bad night of sleep. But the tiredness that came with doing menial labor 10 hours a day.

Before heading out, I dropped onto the couch for a moment. I took a look at my phone, with its quiet glow I scrolled through the list I had made. Comics I’ve been meaning to read, articles and topics I’d bookmarked for deep dives. History, tech and obscure fiction. I also put a rough note about budgeting a trip to a city I’ve been meaning to visit.

It was the middle of the week, I headed out to meet Natalie at our usual breakfast spot. A cheap place with good endless black coffee. Which more than made up for the old mugs and wobbly tables. It was our ritual, a small rebellion against the bland monotony of the week.

I ordered a bagel, and as always, the bottomless house coffee at the front. I filled up my mug at the self-serve dispenser. Natalie was already seated, tapping at her phone with one hand and grabbing a warm mug with the other.

“Yo” She gave a mock saluted when she saw me bringing over my food and cup. I smiled back.

We chatted for a while about shows we recently finished. Then Natalie spoke with a slightly serious tone in her voice. “Did you finally decide if you’re going back to school?” She asked, then took a big bite of toast. We talked about it last week, and I asked her to check up on me about it the next time we met. “Not yet, I wanted a few more months of freedom before I dive headfirst into it again.”

She laughed, nudging my shoulder “That’s what you said six months ago, man! C’mon, hear me out. If the rumors are true…with that new update at work? You could totally sign up for classes. Study during your shift. Do your homework while you are droning. It’s perfect.”

She frowned a bit “Neither of us want this to be our career for the rest of our lives, right?” I groaned, “Yeah, yeah… you’re right.” Bodies can only do this type of work for so long before chronic pain sets in.

The truth stung a little bit more than I expected. I’d wanted to go back to school for a while now, and somehow, that desire had gotten buried beneath streaming queues and half-finished to-do lists. It felt stupid to admit it out loud.

Maybe tomorrow I’d look up enrollment deadlines. Or maybe later today, during work.

I put a note in my phone so I wouldn’t forget,  while I left the dingy restaurant.

——————————————

The factory was rumbling with excitement. Normally, the shift would begin with the usual quiet hum of preparation. Everyone walking towards their stations to slip on their distractions. Instead, we gathered in the makeshift “meeting room,” which was really just the on-site gym reconfigured with rows of folding chairs and a cheap projector screen.

Everyone was talking, buzzing with speculation. We’d only seen glimpses of the new yXX update through teaser videos and limited press releases. Nothing solid. Today we finally were getting something official. I sat among my coworkers, the folding chair creaking faintly under me, watching as the yXX rep took the stage in front of us. She was corporate as they come: smooth voiced, efficient, and constantly smiling in that slightly too wide way that let you know she’d given this same presentation 3 times this week.

She clicked her device, walking us through the features. The new desktop interface would be layered over the old one, allowing us to organize our screens like we would at home. Tabbing between media players, readers, and even basic software. Not everything would work though, graphic intensive programs or anything requiring fine motor input would be off the table. But for most of us, it was enough. “Eye tracking will still be the main form of control,” she explained, her laser pointer tracing over a diagram of a pupil with a vector arrow. “But yXX2 features increased precision. You should notice fewer mis-clicks and better responsiveness”

YXX2? This wasn’t just a patch or visual upgrade. This was a new model.

She paced with practiced rhythm, anticipating questions before anyone had a chance to ask them. Then, she directed our attention to the printed packet each of us had
been handed on the way in. A slim folder of glossy paper with onboarding checklists and feedback forms. The front cover had the yXX logo: A stylized keyhole with circuit board elements that branched out downward,  all encompassed in a circle. I flipped through my packet as she continued to speak.

● What types of applications do you regularly use at home?
● What types of tools or features would you like to see in yXX2?
● Do you experience eye fatigue more easily or visual blurring at the end of your typical shift?
● Have you noticed symptoms of vision sickness since the beginning of headset usage?
● Is there a noticeable delay between your eye movement and the system cursor?

The questions were framed casually, but I could tell they were taking this rollout seriously. This was a new infrastructure, a new way to live your life on the clock.

“A reminder to everyone, the NDA’s that are a part of your contract still apply to this version.”

Eventually, the presentation wrapped up to scattered applause. One by one, we lined up to receive small black box clips. Our new sync units for the upgraded firmware. They were sleek, matte, and a bit bigger than the size of a match box. They looked harmless, almost elegant. Like before, we were instructed to attach them to the reinforced loops on our uniforms.

I ran my fingers over the clip’s surface. This little box was the bridge to something I hadn’t experienced yet. I wasn’t sure to be excited… or a little scared.

——————————————

We went to our stations one by one, my new headset waiting for me. I slid the slick cord into my nose and it wriggled deep inside, a sensation I’d long since grown used to. Then came the headset itself, it looked the same mostly. Just a different color. I placed it over my eyes and activated the new sync unit clipped to my collar. The headset hummed softly as it scanned my retinas and adjusted the silicone tube, guiding it between my sclera and the inner fold of my eye.

As it settled in, gripping onto parts of my brain, my hands pressed the start button on the conveyor. They moved without thought, beginning their shift. My eyes were introduced to the new OS.

YXX2 was sleek and user friendly. Icons floated on the screen with the yXX company logo on the background. Using what I remembered from the presentation, I moved through the apps. Now simply by moving my eyes to look at what I wanted to navigate to, and then a sharp thought of tapping on it. A huge improvement from the old system, no more blinking in patterns to select anything.

I wandered through the menus and found the internet browser and the app hub. There were only about thirty apps available at this launch but I browsed through them casually.

Ah, they have a version of maps.

I had that app at home already but I liked the idea of gradually taking a walk in another city during company time. A bunch of the apps were things that you’d find on any mobile device outside of work. Simple games like flippy bard, and sudoku.

Looking through the apps I found one listed as a file name, Halcyon.app. There was no preview image for it. No icon. No description. Just the name, rendered in default system font , and a small file size. The moment I opened it the entire headset white-screened and my hands froze mid motion.

There was a deep pulse, long enough for me to feel it, and then the sync unit on my chest whirred. A soft reset triggered, and the mechanical movements of my fingers began again.

I guess that app isn’t finished yet.

The rest of the shift flew by as I explored the menus.

————————————————————

Later, at the time clock, Natalie caught up to me. Her usual energy dulled just a little, maybe from excitement fatigue. “Did you end up going on the university website?” Natalie asked as we scanned out.

“I did… but I forgot my username and password so…” I trailed off quickly. “How about you? Did you work on your campaign?”

“No,” She admitted, grinning sheepishly. “I got totally distracted by all of the apps.”

“Ha! You didn’t do your thing either.” I nudged her. “To be honest, I was distracted for like… the first 8 hours.”

She laughed. “I know, right? It’s like my brain forgot I had goals.”

“That’s what happens when we get brand new shiny toys.”

We walked together through the parking lot, our footsteps echoing on the cracked asphalt. The sky had that smudged-orange look it always got near the end of shift, like it was as tired as we were. Natalie stretched her arms behind her head and let out a groan. “I swear, these updates make everything more fun, but somehow I still feel like I got hit by a truck.”

“It’s cause your spirit is still in bed,” I said, rubbing the back of my neck. “Only your body shows up to work now.”

“Yeah well,” she shot me a look, “that part of me doesn’t get paid, so it stays home.” We both laughed at that…too hard, maybe. The kind of laugh that leaks out when everything else in your life feels like it’s on autopilot.

We reached her car, and instead of me heading down the block, I leaned against her rear door for a moment.

She didn’t unlock it.

“You good?” she asked. I hesitated, then shrugged. “I don’t know. I keep thinking about what you said. About school. About not letting this be our life forever.”

Her face softened. “It’s not just about school. It’s about momentum, you know? If you wait too long, you start believing it’s already too late.”

I didn’t respond right away.

“Sorry,” she added quickly. “That came out more dramatic than I meant.”

“No, it’s okay,” I said. “You’re right. It’s just… I think I’m afraid if I start moving again, maybe I’ll realize how long I’ve been standing still.”

Natalie looked at me for a second, like she was trying to decide whether to hug me or hit me with more truth. Instead, she reached into her bag and handed me a crumpled napkin.

Scrawled in marker was a note:

“Enroll, dummy.”

Underneath was a smiley face with devil horns.

I grinned. “What, is this some kind of hex?”

“It’s a reminder,” she said. “Stick it on your fridge. Or your forehead.” The car beeped as she unlocked it. “Tomorrow. You don’t even have to enroll. Just check the deadlines. One step.” She got in, rolled the window down. “Also, if you don’t do it, I’m making Flippy Bard your start up program until you snap.”

“You wouldn’t.”

“Try me.”

She gave a half wave and drove off.

I stood there with the napkin in my hand a little longer than I meant to, watching her tail lights disappear. Then I started walking down the sidewalk, smiling like an idiot.

—————————

Chapter 2

The next day at work I handed in my feedback form to the same woman who gave us the presentation yesterday. My response was mostly positive, at least on paper. Under the additional comments I had made a note about the app that glitched out and white screened.

When I mentioned it out loud to her the rep was unfazed.

“We have already implemented some bug fixes overnight, due to some employees turning in their questionnaires at the end of shift yesterday. The problem might have already been resolved.” She gave the same plastic grin from yesterday. “We hope there are no further issues.” 

“Uh. thanks” I nodded, turning away with a frown pulling at my mouth. Natalie was looking at me from the locker area. As I walked towards her I could see her expression was a bit duller than normal. 

“Mornin’” Her voice lacked her usual vigor.

“Hey, same to you.” I smiled trying to inject some warmth into the moment. “Good news, I looked up enrollment last night. I even scheduled an appointment to talk to an advisor next week.”

With a slight smile, she exhaled in tired relief. “That’s great.” And she meant it, even if something else was weighing down her energy.

“You doing okay?” It wasn’t really a question. It was clear she wasn’t.

She opened her mouth, hesitating.

“Well…I-“ 

The buzzer cut her off. We both flinched, instinctively glancing at the clock.

“Shit,” I muttered. “We’re not at our stations.”

Natalie gave a quick nod. “Later,” she said.

“Yeah.”

We peeled off toward our respective stations with the silent understanding that whatever she was going to say. Whatever was really going on, would be addressed at next break.

Until then I tried to keep busy with logic games, and music. But my brain wouldn't work the way I wanted to.

————————-

When I walked into the break room, I spotted her already sitting at a table, sipping a drink from the vending machine. She looked… better. Not perfect, but clearer than this morning.

“You look more alive,” I said, grabbing a seat across from her. “That morning fog wore off?”

“Yeah,” she said, with a shrug. “Honestly, I felt like garbage this morning. But once I hooked into the headset... I don’t know. I must’ve nodded off. Slept until right before the bell for break went off.""

“You what?” I raised an eyebrow. “You fell asleep?”

She nodded, totally casual.

“How? Your eyes have to stay open for the sync unit to work properly. That’s, like, the whole thing.”

“I don’t know,” she said, lowering her voice slightly. “But on 2, apparently... you can.”
That left me blinking for a second.

“You’re serious?”

She smiled faintly. “Well, I didn’t get written up. So either it worked, or a supervisor didn’t notice. Either way, I’m not complaining.”

I leaned back in my chair, a bit worried about how dismissive she was.

“Well… you do look better.” I said slowly, ""Guess if you’re lying, the production logs will snitch on you.”

She laughed, but the sound was quieter than usual.

“I don’t remember anything about sleeping being possible in the paperwork.” I added.

She gave a shrug. “Maybe it’s not a feature. Maybe it’s just something the system allows now.”

I didn’t press the point, but her explanation didn’t sit right.

“So, what wiped you out?” I asked. “Did you stay up too late?”

“No, it wasn’t that,” she said. “I kept waking up in the middle of the night. One of those nights where you’re dreaming so hard you jolt yourself awake.”

“…Nightmares?”

She frowned a little. “Not exactly. Just… intense.”

The buzzer rang again, louder than before. Or maybe, I was just more on edge.

We stood up, heading towards the door. “You gonna be okay?” I asked as we tossed our wrappers.

“Hopefully.” She said with a nervous smile.

————————-


Returning to work, I noticed something surprising. Halcyon had an icon now. It was faint, almost translucent. A pale, circular emblem.

I stared at it.

It looks like it was fixed.

Maybe now I could actually see what it was supposed to do. I hovered my gaze on it, hesitating… I opened it.

The screen blinked once.
Then again.
Then again, faster and faster.

Like a strobe light revving up, or a heartbeat skipping out of sync. Lines of text skidded across the display. Unreadable, Half formed instructions or code, disappearing too fast to make anything out.

And then everything went white. 

I felt the pulse again.

I was back. Standing at the same workstation. Components in my hands. Same steady movements of my fingers. Annoyance flickered through me. Not just at the app, but at myself for trying it.

Had I…?

No. No, I didn’t fall asleep. I was just zoning out. I didn’t feel unconscious. Not really. Just…floaty. Disoriented. My playlist had skipped forward by two songs. I glanced at the product counter. It was ahead by a few dozen units.

How long had I been out? I clenched my jaw. Shook it off.

Okay. Lesson learned.

No more opening it.

The end of shift alarm rang out. Reflexively, everyone began unplugging in unison. A sea of hands rose to the headsets, sliding their wires free. I removed mine slower than usual. My eyes adjusting. Breathing shallow like I was coming out of anesthesia. 

I scanned the shop floor for Nat, a bit more sensitive to the light around me. I had started developing a migraine. I didn’t want to wait, I pulled a pair of sunglasses out of my locker and headed out.

The walk home was slow and the heat pressed down on me like a second body. What normally was a 10 minute walk, turned into 20. I drifted past the usual land marks, slowly my shoulders became heavier and my feet dragged across the pavement. The moment I got inside I dropped my keys down, removed my shoes and sweaty socks, and stumbled straight into bed.

———————-

When I woke, the light in the room had shifted, and my head throbbed. A dull, nagging ache that pulsed behind my eyes. I popped a painkiller and chased it with a cold glass of water.

“Ugh” I muttered aloud, pressing my palm to my forehead. “This sucks.”

I called in sick and stretched out on the couch with a damp washcloth draped across my brow. It felt like a hangover. 

A notification ping broke the stillness. I reached for my tablet and saw a message from Nat.

""You bailed on work? Weak.""

I smirked, even though my head still felt like it was full of static. My vision shimmered faintly, like the screen was underwater. I blinked, but it didn’t go away.

""Yeah. Called in sick. Head’s killing me. Thought I was gonna pass out on the walk home last night.""

Another ping.

""Yikes. You good? You’re not the only one who called out today.”

That made my stomach twist a little.

""O? What did they say?”

""Something about the refresh rate or light calibration. One of the floor leads said he was gonna file a report if more people drop.""

I hesitated, then typed:

""U ok tho? No headache?""

She didn’t reply for a few minutes. Then:

""Felt off earlier. Better now. You up to rally later for some post-shift pancakes?""

I stared at the screen. My fingers were sluggish, like they didn’t quite belong to me.

""Maybe...""

The tablet slipped out of my hand in the bed. I didn’t catch it.

And then I drifted off again. 

My dreams were vivid and stressful. I was alone on a grey beach, forced to count each grain of sand. When I lost track, something descended . My punishment was disassembly, my body taken apart, each piece sealed into rough metal. I fell endlessly, waiting to hit the ground.

I jolted awake with my heart racing in fear. The pain in my head, however, had passed.

With a long exhale to steady my emotions, I sat up and checked the time. 5:00pm. Nat will be getting out in an hour.

——————-

By the time I got to the diner, the sun had dipped behind the buildings. I entered the diner and Natalie was already seated in a booth near the back as usual, a mug of coffee slowly steaming on the table.

She looked up as I slid into the seat across from her. “Hey, corpse,” she said with a crooked smile. “You made it.”

“Barely.” I took a long drink from the ice water “I think I melted into the sidewalk twice on the way here.”

“Ugh, I feel that. Thank god they need to have the shop cool because of the headset hardware.” We both paused in relief, imagining what a hellhole it would be.

“Have you heard anything else? About the headset issues?”

Natalie shifted in her seat, looking into her mug like it had answers. “Not really. Just… that a few people complained of headaches. One person said their eyes wouldn’t track right for a while. The rep shrugged it off mostly. Said it was calibration fatigue.”

“Calibration fatigue.” I rolled the words around like something bitter.

She shrugged. “To be honest.. It sounds like something they made up quickly in a meeting to quell us. It's up to corporate how long they want production to be affected.”

There was a pause. We both stared out the window for a few seconds. The street beyond was quiet and hazy.

I lowered my voice. “I opened one of the apps. One that wasn’t listed properly.”

She looked up immediately. “What?”

“It didn’t even have a name, really. Just a file name: Halcyon.app. No info, no icon, well… until yesterday. I made a mistake.” Admitting it out loud. “Everything was flashing and it white screened. My hands froze. It rebooted, but after that… at the end of shift…”

I paused for a moment “I’ve opened it twice now and it doesn’t work. The representative seemed dismissive about it. I’m confident it gave me a migraine.”

Natalie didn’t speak right away. She tapped her fingernail against the ceramic mug in a slow rhythm. Then:

“Yeah, I saw that one too.” She said softly.

I blinked. “You open it?”

She shook her head. “No. I hovered over it for a bit. Thought it was just a bugged out listing.”

I nodded slowly. “Ever since yesterday, I feel terrible. I don’t know. I wanna blame work, but the dreams were intense too.”

That got her attention. “Dreams?”

“Just weird,” I said. “Hard to explain. But I woke up and couldn’t shake the feeling.”

She hesitated, and laughed a little. “Maybe it’s contagious.” She looked back down. “Well you know I've been feeling it too. Like, just a little out of sync. I almost tripped on nothing walking to my car.”

A realization came over me,
“Are you sure you didn’t open halcyon?”

Her voice was quieter. “Not really…I might have when I fell asleep. I woke up to a white screen in the headset.”

We both sat with that for a moment. Natalie broke the silence. “Maybe we’re just fried. New software, long hours, heat wave. That’s enough to scramble anyone.”

“Yeah…” I said, though it didn’t feel like enough.

She pulled her legs up into the booth, wrapping her arms around them. “Still… maybe don’t click anything weird for a while. And if you get another dream like that? Tell me. Deal?”

“Deal.” I managed a smile.

We sat like that for a while longer, sipping coffee as the diner lights buzzed above us and the shadows outside deepened. Neither of us said it out loud, but we both knew something had shifted.
We just weren’t sure how much it would affect us, yet.

Hey everyone! I’ve noticed a common dream a lot of us share — growing our own food. But let’s be real… most people never get around to it because:
	•	They don’t know how to start
	•	They don’t have space (hello, apartment life!)
	•	They don’t have time or patience
	•	Or they’ve tried before and gave up because… life 😅

So here’s a simple idea I’m toying with:

👉 What if there was an app that let you lease a small garden bed in your city — super cheap, like the cost of a monthly coffee or two — and with just a few taps you could choose what you want to grow… and then? That’s it.

A local professional gardener does the planting, watering, pruning, all the dirty work. You get regular photo/video updates of your garden’s progress. And at harvest time, your veggies are delivered to your door — fresh, seasonal, and grown just for you.

Kinda like “owning a farm” but zero effort. You just enjoy the fun parts — choosing what to grow and receiving the fruits (and veggies) of your garden.

I’m a tech person, not a gardener, but I’m really keen to build this. I’m also exploring how to make it feel like a game, where you can level up, unlock new veggies, or even trade crops with others.

I’m based in Melbourne, but this idea can work anywhere. I’m also looking for a partner who might be into urban farming, gardening, or just passionate about food and sustainability.

🌿 So — would you use something like this?
💬 Why or why not?
🤔 What do you see as challenges? What would make it exciting for you?

Keen to hear your thoughts!

Add a half packet of hot cocoa mix. 

Heat in microwave for 90 seconds.

So last week, I was enjoying my usual Saturday morning ritual: coffee, fuzzy socks, and pretending I’m going to clean the apartment. Suddenly, I hear frantic knocking at my door. It’s my neighbor, clutching her cat like it just committed tax fraud.

She blurts out, “Can you talk to Mr. Whiskers? He’s been acting weird since Tuesday.”

I blink. “You want me to… talk to your cat?”

“Yes. You have a calming aura. He trusts you.”

I don’t know what kind of aura I have, but it’s usually the kind that makes vending machines eat my coins. Still, I crouch down and say, “Hey buddy, rough week?”

Mr. Whiskers stares into my soul. Then he sneezes directly into my face.

My neighbor gasps. “That’s the first sneeze he’s done all week! You’re a miracle worker!”

Now she brings him over every other day for “sessions.” I just sit there, drink tea, and occasionally meow back. I think I’m being paid in tuna cans now?

Anyway, if anyone needs a feline therapist, I’m apparently licensed by Mr. Whiskers himself.

His dad comes in without knocking and says hey what's up drakester! Agh, dad! Said Drake. I was about to defeat Undershadow, Lord of darkness! Drake's dad says put down the blasphemy and listen up for a quick sec, sport. Me and your mother are having a second honeymoon over the weekend and youre man of the house. This is a big responsibility, so no guests! An- you're not even listening are you. drake says yeah yeah love and marriage horse and carriage big probability. Jake's dad says you probably don't even care that theres a ""DeGreggio's"" pizza in the freezer when you get hungry later. Drake dies in his game a second time and the sprigs of hair at the crown of his head spike up in excitement as he whips his head around to face his dad in disbelief. "" ""Degreggio's"" signature cheesy, carb-heavy goodness!?"" We'll be home Sunday evening, bye son! A voice in game says switch to easy mode? 

POV shot from inside the oven of Drake haphazardly slapping the frozen pizza into the oven. He gets the bright idea of, instead of waiting for 45 minutes for the oven to cook at 350°, setting it to 1050° and checking on it 15 minutes later. Drake was certain he'd make quick work of the Lord of darkness before his pizza was ready. 36 unfruitful hours and 8000 deaths later, Drake's nose begins to itch. what's that smell ? he says. After a brief pause he goes AAAAAAAAAAA! Drake rushes to the kitchen to find out the oven is open and empty. Drake raises A brow and scratches his head. He then hears loud, booming footsteps from outside that shake the scene like an earthquake. A potted plant is knocked off an end table but Drake dives and catches it. He then steps out to see what all the hullabaloo is about. 

 All types of screaming and a "" run for your life""! Immediately Pierce Drake's eardrums. As Drake is walking into town, a man grabs him by the shoulders and gets in his face with "" kid you gotta get outta here!"" before running off, arms flailing. "" what is going on?"" Drake says to himself, stopping to look into a window with a television showing the local news ""This is whats going on! Reporting live in the central square of Maplemooseington, our town has become the playpen of a ginormous, CHEESY-"" Drake jumped as the entire storefront is crushed under the gooey foot of a flaming pizza colossus! Drake has miraculously eluded its ""vision"" and he dips into an alleyway and smacks right into his friend, Cole. 

""DRAKE/COLE"" They shouted simultaneously. Drake says no time to talk, let's get out of here before it hears us! ""unlikely. According to my calculations, cheese cannot grow ears."" Drake facepalms. Cole says great, now it got away. I was going to stick this thermometer in it to find out its temperature. I have a plan and it's gonna get me that humanitarian award for my college application! Drake follows up with ""Uh, how about a Saving-our-lives-a-quarius plaque instead!"" ""We'll split the difference and skip step 1. Follow me!"" Cole unfolds two collapsible credit card-sized electric scooters from his minimalist wallet and they take off. 

""Where are we going??"" "" Maplemooseington's coldest water ports are towards the coast, we wait for the anomaly to come plodding down Main St. And we blast it with water from a fire hydrant until it is neutralized."" ""The Anomaly, eh? I'm calling it Cheese Boss! ""Whatever. I'm gonna get this thing loose. I've already given it an Ocular scan and detected weak points in the metal."" Cole struggles to move the cap even slightly. "" I think I forgot to carry the 2."" Drake says stand back, I know Kung Fu. He attempts to drop kick the hydrant and overshoots it, landing over the top of it on his back. ""Ow""! Cried Drake. Then a voice in the distance said "" looks like we all skipped gym class. Difference is, I have something to show for it."" 

""21!"" drake and cole exclaimed. ""Dazzle us with one of your weirdo magic tricks and make Cheese Boss disappear, it's getting close!!"" 21 replied i deal in dark arts, not magic tricks. And only an elder practitioner can stop something that big. Meh, I'm not even freaking out over it. I'm ready for my transition to the underworld. But first, let me give you mere humans a hand. 21's daggar-shaped forehead emblem glows as he closes his eyes. He crushes an orb of light in his hand and eats it, then vomits a white hot luminaire at the fire extinguisher and Drake and Cole duck for cover. The light ricochets off the extinguisher and hits a family of birds living in a treehouse, causing them to explode like dynamite. 21 is puzzled. Some debris from the explosion lands at his feet- a tiny coffee table, a tiny garage door, and a tiny grill. Then a second later, a tiny Bible which 21 picks up in between his index and thumb with a discarded napkin. "" huh, that explains it."" Cole shouts "" we're gonna die! We're gonna die and I haven't even submitted my entry for the citywide robotics comp!""

As cheese boss creeps closer to the three, the entire area is enveloped in a vortex of wind, and the giant pile of mozzarella stops dead in its tracks. It is reeled back by what appears to be the force of a black hole, and it screams and vomits UFO-sized pepperonis and olives and sausage bits that look like wrecking balls. With a horrifyingly huge gaping maw emerging from behind it that then swallowed the entire thing whole without effort, this leviathan  found out that there's always a bigger fish. And this fish was having its fourth cheat day of the week. 

""RED!!"" the three welcomed their Pretty, red-haired friend. Cole erupts with "" you really bailed us out there!"" red couldn't speak. "" I had a feeling in my spirit that it was my time today. Eh."" 21 chimed in. Drake followed with ""Before you got here, Cheese Boss was destroying everything. ""Yeah, except your gastrointestinal tract."" said cole. ""Awe man, and I was really looking forward to- WAIT, you guys knew this was all my fault...?"" 21 replied "" it's your fault at least twice a month at this point. (flashback to the four of them attempting to slurp their way out of a chocolate milkshake ocean with straws) ""My blood sugar never recovered."" cole added. 

Drake's ""Alien Alex"" novelty watch starts beeping. ""Oh, crud! My parents are gonna be home in 15 minutes! I'm so grounded..."" "" yeah, and the top speed of that abandoned ice cream truck across the street is only about 30 mph, according to the optical gauge I just ran. You're screwed, dude."" "" a dejected drake and his friends are strong armed into the back of the truck by Red, who still has not uttered a single word. ""What the...?"" 21 said, annoyed. Red stood at the back of the ice cream truck, facing out and holding on for dear life. "" hey cole, what's the statistical likelihood of Red going 5 seconds without talking? ""Beats MeeeeeAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!"" 

Red begins belching with the unrelenting force of a jet engine, propelling the ice cream truck through the streets of Maplemooseington at mach speed! Drake and Cole are fighting over the steering wheel and 21 is sitting by the deep freezer in the back with headphones on, listening to who knows what. ""Cole, only one of us has seen ""Pedal 2 the Metal: Japan"" 10 times!"" "" and I wrote a 50 page essay on the theory of nonsensicality, which is what you are proving right now!"" the ice cream truck careens onto Drake's street, with Red still delivering an unadulterated supply of eructation horsepower. Drake sees the family station wagon in his driveway and frets. ""We're too late..."" Cole quickly counts on his fingers and kicks Drake out with precise enough timing for him to be able to fly out of the side of the van and through his bedroom window. 

""AAAAAAAAAAAA-OOOF!"" he lands smack dab in the middle of his bed. Drake's dad pokes his head in and knocks on the already open door. ""There he is. What's up kiddo?"" Drake lay spread eagle over his sheets and doesn't say a word. ""heh, out cold. That's a ""Degreggio's"" nap right there.""

Context: Kagabi i was scrolling mindlessly sa ig and came across a reel that was like tell the universe to show you how better it can get and watch everything in your life get better. So i was like, universe show me how better it can get. Pero sabi ko kay God nalang pala. Sabi ko god show me how better it can get.

This morning i woke up and got ready for work. Nalate pa nga hahaha i work with my bf. And i was late because nagprep pa ko ng breakfast namin. I always prep our breakfast. Sa chats palang na off na ko but i was like kalmahan mo. We went on our usual morning. We ate at my desk and shared a cup of coffee. It was nice. But for the longest time something felt off. 

I've checked his phone without him knowing. I know i know. Very low of me. But you know our insticts. I found nothing concrete nor any flirtatious message. Checked his followings and his fyp. No half naked women. Puro funny videos. I was embarrassed. Pinaghihinalaan ko bf ko wala naman pala. That was a couple of weeks ago.

And then this afternoon. We were about to pay for his car. I told him to get his contract kasi naglapse kami sa insurance. Need to check if may penalty. Hinanap niya. He left his phone on my table. Foolish me checked his messenger. Saw a name i remember from when i checked. Nung unang check ko wala pa newly added friend. And then kanina i saw the flirty exchange. He asked her if gusto mo ko. She answered i wanna get to know you. Sabi niya dapat daw sa game pa siya magtatanong. Aba naglalaro pala sila ng COD late at night. Nagtanong si girl if gusto din daw ba siya. Hindi sumagot si bf. Sa game nalang daw. They were supposed to play tonight.

Best believe my hands were shaking. Pero hindi ako maka iyak. Until now hindi ako makaiyak.

Previous attempt: wanna know what i did? I messaged the woman. She replied. She was working in the same industry. Sabi ko tawag ako pag uwi ko. May important na tanong lang. Tumatawag na siya. Hindi ko masagot because i was driving. Sabi niya bukas nalang daw maglalaro na daw kasi siya ng COD. Sabi ko wait lang tawag na ko. I was not about to let her talk to my bf before i let her know who i was haha.

So we talked. She admitted to meeting him in one of our compant events. She admitted to having a crush on him. I was composed. I didn't yell. I simply asked what their connection was. She said sorry and that she will cut off contact. She said pa ibablock na niya. Now i don't know if she really did. And frankly if she didn't bahala na sila. 

After that whole thing, i saw that i was blocked na on everything by my bf hahaha naunahan pa ko. Guilty ang lolo mo kahit na sabi naman sakin nung babae wala pa daw ibang ganap at hindi naman daw nagpakita ng motibo bf ko sa kanya. 

And then i remembered what i whispered last night now i can't help but wonder if this is god's way of showing me it could get better. By breaking us up. Ilang dasal ang inialay ko for us and our relationship haha. 

I gave him all my love. Excused his being an avoidant as him being traumatized. I was willing to heal with him as an anxious person.

People come to talk to me at my work station, at lunch, when I'm strolling around or when I go for coffee breaks. I'm tired of talking to people. Or rather listening to people. The work I do is mentally exhausting and I can't entertain any emotional drama which is useless to me.

The intricate stone cathedral loomed over Phineas, every corner and surface covered with delicate carvings and scrollwork.  He’d wanted to stay behind in the park while Althea went on further errands.  Left alone, he studied the stone edifice.

A large arch dominated the front, with two massive wooden doors open to the spring air.  Solid iron hinges secured the doors to the stone.  The eaves of the church had creatures at the corners for the downspouts - varieties of demons, dragons, and other grotesque beings served as gargoyles.  Phineas’ ears drooped, though, when he saw one familiar form on the side of the cathedral.  One of the gargoyles was in the form of a fox, nine stone tails behind it, its face frozen in a snarl of rage.

The large central stained-glass window sparkled in the sunlight, depicting the bronze Tree of Life on a field of green.  Phineas opened his satchel to pull out his old family testament, saved from his old home as a memory of his parents.  The tree on the window matched the gold inlay in the old leather.  He opened the old book, flipping through the delicate pages with a claw.  He remembered his mother reading stories of great old heroes in the past, translating the book from their ancestral language.  He had only started to learn the old tongue before his parents were taken.

Periodically, people slowly walked in and out of the great wooden doors, silent, with their heads down.  Phineas remembered his mother quoting verses about the love of the Creator - that he loved all his creations, even those that had been changed, like Voxa.  Returning the book to his satchel, he made up his mind.  Once the book and his dagger were safely in his satchel, Phineas approached the doors.  When ascending the stone stairs toward the threshold, he realized that all the patrons he’d seen were human.  With a nervous swallow, he continued.  *Mom always talked about the love of the creator. What should I be afraid of?*

Once inside, his eyes adjusted coming out of the bright sunlight.  Taking his hat and sunglasses off, he surveyed the interior.  Three columns of long pews stretched from the altar toward the door.  A great bronze Tree of Life hung behind the empty pulpit, catching the colored rays of sunlight streaming through the stained-glass windows.  About a dozen lonesome humans with heads bowed in the pews.  No one seemed to notice the fox as he jumped up into the back pew.  He lowered his head, closing his eyes as he thought about his parents.  Struggling to remember, he tried to recite the old prayers they taught him years ago.

“You’re on borrowed time, child of the fallen one.”

Startled, Phineas looked up to see the old priest.  Dark green robes flowed around the man, with only a stiff white collar protruding around his neck.  The priest didn’t have anger in the wrinkles of his be-spectacled face, but Phineas felt as if those stern eyes pierced straight into his soul.  Without another word, the priest walked toward the altar, away from Phineas.

*Child of the fallen one?  Which fallen one?  There’s a few to pick from.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_

After another haggling session with an armorer, Althea needed some afternoon coffee.  She noticed a large café that seemed to cater to a more diverse clientele near the river, back on the Duvano side.    Standing near the back corner of the shop, Althea eyed the other patrons as she blew on her latte to cool it down. Light streamed through the dirty windows, illuminating dancing specks of dust in the air.

To her surprise, she saw Brittany enter the dive coffee shop, her elaborate crimson mage robes replaced by a simple, plain light blue dress.  The mage was looking down, avoiding the other customers as she made her order.  She sat at a high table in the back corner, seemingly unaware of Althea’s presence.

*I wonder what’s with her.  I’ve never seen Britt-Brain look so down before.  Should I… talk to her?*

Althea surprised herself, feeling concern for her old school nemesis.  *Admittedly, ‘nemesis’ wasn’t a very exclusive group for me back then.*  She weaved through the tables in the back of the café, cautiously picking her hooves through the crowd.

“Hey Brittany… how’s it going?”

The mage looked up with wide eyes, pushing back a lock of blonde hair that had fallen out of place.  “Sto-, uh, Althea, I didn’t expect to see you here.”

Althea looked down at her latte, not sure how to take that.  She held up her cup.  “I picked up a bad bean habit while working a job in Ocheyedan a few years ago.  How about you?”  Althea settled her legs down, closer to the floor, so they would be closer to eye-to-eye.

The waitress brought Brittany a unexpectedly large mug of steaming black coffee.  Looking up sheepishly, she shrugged.  “Grad classes back at the academy.  Too many all-nighters working on my thesis.”

Althea’s own eyes went wide as Brittany started guzzling the coffee.  Setting it down, the mage saw her surprise.  She fingered the charm on her necklace.  “Fire resistance works for coffee as well.”

*So that explains how that fuzzball did it!*

“My final years didn’t go as well.  I struggled and fought to finish classes and get this position.  You know how the academy was…” She waved her hand dismissively.

This brought a pained grimace to Althea’s face.  “Yeah, before they kicked me out.”

Brittany’s eyes got wide again, realizing what she’d dragged up.  She reached her hand out to Althea’s, looking her back in the eye.  “Oh, they didn’t kick you out, you’d just finished what you, you know, *could* do, after theory training.”

This got the centaur’s eyes rolling.  “The whole Order couldn’t figure out why I’m resistant to magic.”  She set her latte down.  “Do you know how embarrassing it was?  Do you remember how they called me Marcus’ ‘broken pet’?  Every amulet I picked up, every enchanted tome I opened, everything fizzled out.  Do you remember when I broke old Dobromila’s levitation glyph, making her fall off the balcony?”  Taking another swig of her latte, she got more fired up.  “I just wanted to be *normal*!”  She paused as that sunk in, brows furrowing.  “You know, *magic* normal!*”*

“Um, speaking of that…  You do realize that book you brought me is, like, super cursed, right?”

This dampened the fire building in Althea’s eyes.  “Um, no?”

“Yeah, if you didn’t have that ‘resistance’, you’d be undead right now.  If you were ‘*magic normal’*, that book would have shriveled you up with a living mummification hex.”

“Oh…”  Althea drummed her fingers on the little high tabletop.  “Sorry.”

“It’s okay.  The outpost has damping wards that helped me deal with it.”  Brittany finished her mug of coffee, signaling the waitress for more.  “Speaking of sorry… do you remember when I asked if I could study you for a paper?”

Althea’s eyes narrowed.  “Yes.”  After an awkward silence, she continued.  “Why?”

“Well, I kind of used you as a subject for my thesis.”

“What!?”

Brittany put her hands up, palms out.  “It’s okay!  I kept you completely anonymous.  I was studying your magic resistance, hoping I could find, you know - a cure.”

Althea snorted, slowly crushing her cup in her hands.  “*I don’t need a cure*.  I am who I am.  I have accepted that.”  She focused on the broken mug in her hands, ignoring the mage.  *Yet another coffee mug to pay for…*

Brittany chose to ignore how unlikely that statement was, in light of Althea’s previous outburst.  “Well, actually, now that you bring that up…”

“What is that supposed to mean?”

The waitress brought another mug of coffee, nervously skirting around the angry centaur.

“I don’t think you’re *resistant* to magic.  When I was doing my grad work, I found something so old that we don’t even have a word for it in Marien.  It’s, well, *anti-attunement*.”

“Anti-attunement?”  Althea’s brow unforrowed.

Brittany sighed in relief as Althea’s anger faded.

“So, you know, there’s general magical fields that affect everyone in some way.  Arcane, Spiritual, Divine, Eldritch, and Elemental, all with their own subcategories as well. You can attune to specific kinds of magic, strengthening yourself in that, but weakening in ability to use opposite kinds.  You can also attune to objects through bloodlines or other connections.”

Althea’s ears flicked to the side in irritation.   “Yes, I do remember Mystical Affinities 101.  I passed… sort of.” 

“Okay, well, in my advanced studies, I came across *anti-*attunement.  Instead of being connected to a domain, you get blocked from a domain, *but you still can have your own magic*.  You just happen to be anti-attuned to everything we had access to in the Order.”

Brittany watched Althea with curiosity as she considered this all.  Filling the awkward silence, Brittany continued.  “It takes some major-level, old magic to build anti-attunement.  Like, beyond archmages.”

“So, how did I end up with major ancient magic that seems to exist to annoy me?”

Brittany just shrugged her shoulder before drinking more coffee.  “I told you my thesis got rough.  I even tried changing my subject, but the board said I was too far along.”

Althea thought of the cave, when Phineas was trapped in the cage.  That magic was special, but she was nervous about sharing it.  “What if I told you I *was* able to use magic items?

Brittany’s eyes managed to get even bigger.  “You did?!   I can use that for my Th.D dissertation!”  Sensing the faux pas, she backed off.  “I mean, that’s great for you!” She nervously fiddled with a loose lock of blonde hair.   “So, um, what was it?”

Althea’s eagerness for answers outweighed to annoyance at Brittany’s academic excitement.  “You know that weird old fox?  I was able to use his dimensional bag, and his dagger - that zaps everyone else - *glowed* for me.  It cut through wrought iron like butter when I used it.”

Brittany rubbed her chin, puzzled by this.  Taking in another swig of coffee, she then let out a *hmmpf.*  “The items resist everyone else?  All humans?”

“Yep, the bag stayed shut for everyone else, and the dagger attacked everyone that touched it.  Except *me*.  I thought it was my resistance, but then the dagger glowed and I freed Phineas from a cage.”  Althea’s eyes lit up.  “It was the first time I ever really felt magic.”

Brittany pulled out a small notepad from her purse, scribbling excitedly.  “Anything else?  Any other magic?”

Althea felt the scars from the arrow wounds through her dress, thinking of the fiery foxes.  “Well, I maybe, you know, died after that…”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The sun was setting behind the tall smokestacks of Duvano.  Phineas watched alone from the hillside in the park.  The trees reminded him painfully of his old forest, of simpler times.  Even though he had been losing his mind, it was so much more peaceful. 

*No fighting, no quests, no mages or bandits.  All I had to do was deliver adventurers to their doom in the keep and laugh.* 

He pulled out his adventurer’s guild papers.  *’Magical Creature – OTHER’.   Is that all I am?  Am I really the last of my kind?  Am I just a novelty, following Althea around like a lost kit?  People think I’m her ‘pet’.*   He didn’t want to admit that his feelings for her had been changing, in ways he didn’t understand.  The night before out in the town had been awful, prodded along by Rurik and Felmar.  Once he realized what was going on, it was too late. 

*She was so mad…* 

He put the guild papers back into his satchel, then pulled his dagger out.  He slowly turned the hilt in his paws, studying the scrollwork.  The nine tails on the hilt felt like a joke.

*A whole lot of good this ‘grand’ ancestry has done for me.  Just a bunch of kitsunes staring at me in visions, and a price to pay…*

Phineas sighed as the sun slipped below the horizon, a cool breeze coming down from the mountains.  He padded back up into the stand of trees, studying them as he slowly walked.  Althea was probably looking for him at this point.  Or not.  Maybe she was just drinking away her sorrows again in the tavern.

*Sad about not having parents?  Better than having and losing them, seeing them taken away.*  In the vision of the foxes in the glade, the two wispy spirits in front…

He didn’t want to think about it. 

As the breeze blew through the trees, a shiver rippled through his fur.  He knew he should go back to the inn, but he wasn’t ready for that yet.  Deeper into the trees, he found some dead branches, missed by the gardeners.  He soon had a little fire going.

The fire danced in his eyes, lighting the dark world around him in the little copse of trees.  He huddled near the fire for warmth.  He stared at it, not wanting to think of what had led him here.  He jumped, startled by what felt like a nudge from his satchel.  *Something must have shifted inside. Can that happen?*

He opened the flap to find an old, dusty bottle on top.  The hand-written label was in the old tongue, and a dark brown liquid sloshed inside.  Pulling the cork, the strong odor of alcohol emanated. 

*Hmmm.  Well, dad’s bag knows best, right?*

He took a swig, setting off a coughing fit from the strong liquor.

Putting the cork back, he watched the fire again.

*In the cave… how did I do that?  I was aflame, feeling alive, powerful.  Not like now.*

Watching the fire, he tried to focus on that feeling.  He slowly reached out a paw to the flames.  Closer and closer, he reached out, nearly touching the flames.  Strangely, it didn’t feel *too* hot.  He reached out further, bolder…

“*Son of a #$&\**)!”

Phineas shook his singed paw, smelling his burnt fur before licking it.

Staring up at the clear night sky, he pondered the heavens.  His father had tried to teach him about the stars and planets, but he had been too rambunctious of a kit to pay much attention.  Sanvord was high in the sky, near the moon, red against the black night sky.  Above the remnant glow of the sunset, one of the wandering stars slowly moved across the sky, typical for right after sunset.  It appeared abruptly above the horizon for a few minutes as it traveled, then escaped back into darkness.

Settling his paws underneath himself, he curled his tail up, fluffing his fur for warmth near the dying fire.

*Will I ever find my place in this world?*

I'm a citizen of the US, living in Denver, CO currently, and I'm going to college for Film production & post production, with an expected grad date of 2028.

Growing up in Colorado, you see many different walks of life in the same day. People from all over the world the country are at our airport, having layovers and drinking coffee, while some tour down to the city to see what we have to offer. Denver is a hidden melting pot for culture and science, and its lead me to take interest in anthropology and philosophy. The way humans move and interact with one another over time has always been a subject that piques my interest.

I also enjoy the study of Religion from an unbiased perspective as well. Recently, I deconstructed from Christianity and I'm currently spiritual but unlabelled. I have beliefs that the spirit world is real, but not in the way we as humans understand it. I think our Creator is on a different wavelength and frequency than us, so I believe all religion is a human attempt at understanding ""God"". 

I'm also a young queer male, who often studies and critiques the lgbt subculture. I have lots of detailed beliefs on the lgbt community, such as the fact that hookup culture has gotten completely out of control. My desire is to find the 'Why?' behind these facts.

In the last four years I've published Six photo series and a short film. My debut photo series, *A House is Not A Home* (2023) released to critical acclaim, followed by my first short & sophomore photo release: *A Bridge to a Fateful Beginning* (2023). After this, I released two more photographic works: *In Deeds Past Memory* (2024) & *Thoughts I Never Recognized* (2024). This year, in 2025, I'm documenting the seasons in a trilogy of series, and a film which will be detailed further later on this year. The trilogy began it's exhibition this year on April 20, with *Equinox* (2025), and *Solstice* (2025) on July 3.

So, I’m a bit of a black coffee guy. Like, I literally only drink it plain — no sugar, no milk, nothing.

Saw this shorts video and got me a little nervous 

But I’ve been hearing that in Thailand, especially with Thai women, sweet coffee (with condensed milk and all that) is kind of the standard — especially on casual dates or coffee meetups.

I have nothing against sweet coffee or people who love it! But what I’m a bit worried about is accidentally offending someone if I don’t order the same thing or if I politely say no when they suggest it.

I know it probably sounds like such a small thing, but in those first few meetups or dates, little things like that can matter, right?

Could this actually be a deal-breaker? Or am I just overthinking it? Would love to hear from any experienced expats or locals — how would you handle this kind of situation?

What really annoys me is the entitlement. They take up the street while they chat to other dog walking people. They let their dogs off the leash on any patches of grass ignorant of kids and other people. 

And the sh*t. There is dog sh*t everywhere. I've also noticed with horror and disgust that some dog owners have actually picked up sh*t in bags, then tossed the bags into bushes. Why? Pure laziness and entitlement.

I really don't understand the mentality nor entitlement of these type of dog walkers, and it seems a lot of them judging by the length and breadth of dog sh*t all over the place. Why destroy and ruin the beautiful place where you walk your dogs?

I saw one lady walking 10 dogs across a field - I guess one of these professional dog carers. How in the hell is she supposed to keep an eye on all the dogs and clean up after them properly. Most likely she doesn't. 

I also like to frequent a lovely little coffee shop in Bushey - again, full of dogs, and people letting them off the lead in the cafe. The entitlement.

If you’re thinking about getting a reliable and secure VPN, here’s why I think Surfshark might be worth it.

First of all, I travel a lot, and that means I often have to rely on public Wi-Fi at hotels, airports, and coffee shops. Let’s be honest public Wi-Fi is not exactly the safest.. That’s why I started using Surfshark it ensures my personal data stays private no matter where I am.

Surfshark has a strict no-logs policy. For me, knowing that my data isn’t being stored or tracked makes me feel much more secure online. It’s one less thing to worry about when browsing or handling sensitive information like emails or banking.

One of the standout features for me is that you can protect unlimited devices with just one Surfshark subscription. I use it on my laptop, phone, and tablet, and it’s also great because my family can use it too - all for just about $2/month. Plus, I used found a coupon code, ""*redditspecial*"", that gave me an extra discount to make the price even better.

Another thing worth mentioning is that Surfshark has over 3,200 servers in 100 countries, which means I never have to worry about slow connections or limited options. It’s reliable and works seamlessly wherever I am. Also, Surfshark also works on pretty much all devices there are such as Windows laptop, IPhone, IPad, etc.

One last thing that I want to mention is Surfshark offers additional features like ad-blocking and cookie pop-up blocker. Both of those made my browsing experience much smoother, no more stupid ads nor cookie pop ups on every website.

To sum up, Surfshark really ticks all the boxes for me - it’s affordable, easy to use, and super reliable. It’s honestly one of the best VPN options out there if you’re looking for a VPN compatible with various devices.

I hope this review helps. If you have any questions about Surfshark, feel free to let me know.",2,1752589355.0,vpnreviews,1,1.0,False

So, I’m a bit of a black coffee guy. Like, I literally only drink it plain — no sugar, no milk, nothing.

But I’ve been hearing that in Thailand, especially with Thai women, sweet coffee (with condensed milk and all that) is kind of the standard — especially on casual dates or coffee meetups.

I have nothing against sweet coffee or people who love it! But what I’m a bit worried about is accidentally offending someone if I don’t order the same thing or if I politely say no when they suggest it.

I know it probably sounds like such a small thing, but in those first few meetups or dates, little things like that can matter, right?

Could this actually be a deal-breaker? Or am I just overthinking it? Would love to hear from any experienced expats or locals — how would you handle this kind of situation?",0,1752589322.0,Thailand,14,0.29,False

1m0j0nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1m0j0nn/cant_remember_if_i_took_my_medicine/,Can't remember if I took my medicine....,"preface: I am not seeking medical advice and I understand I alone can decide what is in my best medical interest. I will not detrimentally rely on the personal experiences shared as a result of this post. 

Has anyone ever accidentally taken a double dose of their stimulant because they forgot they already took it? And if so...have you ever done it within 30 minutes of taking the first dose? 

I (31F, \~140lbs 5'2) believe I just did that. And I'm feeling a little odd and wired and wondering if you experienced this too, how did you re-regulate your nervous system? I'm also wondering whether I should seek medical support. For context, I took 25 mg extended release generic adderall. My daily dose is 25 XRs with the option for 2 boosters of 10mg instant later in the day (whether I need my full prescribed dose of 45mg depends on monthly cyclic hormonal fluctuations; my psychiatrist has previously advised the highest recommended dosage for adderall, so I am a little worried about having taken 50 mg). I have also had one cup of coffee this morning and did not get adequate sleep last night. 

Currently I'm monitoring my heart rate and intend to go for a walk to regulate. I am an auDHDer and when feeling overly stimulated, physical exercise is my main mode of regulation, but I am also a weighted blanket gal and have other soothing options at my disposal as well.

1m0j0mn,https://v.redd.it/41g55cxfr1df1,Find a Good product for cleaning coffee cups,"I saw one at a branded coffee shop, and then i had to have one. I LOVE it Then i bought one from web! I saw many similar product but this one is totally made with metal, it is heavy and solid. so it can be used for many years.

 It makes rinsing after handwashing coffee mugs and cups, as well as getting out stuck on goo from the inside of my glasses. Totally recommend even if you have to tap a new hole.

1m0j0ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/SchizoFamilies/comments/1m0j0ld/email_to_a_friend_whos_son_was_just_diagnosed/,Email to a friend who's son was just diagnosed.,"*Hi, all. Not sure if this is the right forum, but below is an email that my wife sent to an acquaintance who's son was just diagnosed. She is so much more knowledgeable than me about all this. She read all the books and went to the workshops and poured her soul into this for the past 5 years. I thought it may be helpful to this group. I know it's helped me appreciate he*r:



*Validation Therapy*: Accepting the individual's reality and validating their emotions can help reduce agitation and aggressive behaviors by avoiding confrontation.

If his diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder, he has anosognosia: he is unaware of his mental illness or impairment despite evidence to the contrary.  He will not readily seek treatment or therapy.  His thinking will be disorganized and disordered. He will express outlandish ideas, plans that he can't fulfill, periods of profound sadness or mania, no emotional regard for loved ones' feelings/needs/concerns/requests.  You'll get nowhere trying to correct his thoughts or counter his arguments.  I said ""tell me more"" and he typically ran out of things to say as his thoughts were so superficial and not well thought out.  I also agreed with him or acknowledged what he was saying, ""I hear what you're saying but I don't see it that way"" or ""that's not what I'm understanding."" 

Just listen.  Ask if he wants your opinion.  Tell him you can't understand his reasoning but you want to hear.  If it gets too long-winded or weird, remind him that he's been talking too long and that you need a break.  He can't recognize your feelings or probably acknowledge them.  He can't moderate his emotions so try to set up the interaction for success.  Don't go into a conversation with an agenda....he's too unwell to be able to reliably participate.  He'll say ""OK"" but not be able to follow through.  Tell him if his behavior is scary to you, focus on feelings and behaviors, but keep it super simple and consistent.  Speak slowly and calmly as much as you can.

Go for a walk together, get outside, go get a coffee, take a drive, run an errand, watch a short/simple show, play a short game, pet the dog.  Find a common, neutral space or activity that isn't about illness.  Calm and a peaceful interaction, even if for short periods, is a blessing and the goal when he first enters recovery.  

Initially with this diagnosis, your son is likely no longer functioning as an adult who can understand consequences, make rational decisions, process verbal or written information reliably, complete daily self-care or household routines.  He won't want to be touched or do any loving touch.  He won't tolerate social interactions well.  He might resent you for trying to help or support him because he views it as controlling.  I did a lot of asking if it was OK for me to ask him a question, make a suggestion. Your son will sleep a lot, keep crappy hours.  He will be slow to process what you're saying....always give him extra time to respond, and keep questions simple and infrequent.  I had to prioritize what I would address with my son each day.  Conversation was exhausting and intrusive for him.   Depending upon your son's behavior, you may not want him driving the car because he's unsafe.  It's probably OK to tell him that his recent behavior (whatever it is) makes him unsafe to drive, but he won't believe you.  Stay calm. He'll run out of steam but will bring it up again.  We put a tracker on the car because he was driving Uber Eats and lost the car one time (we were able to find it...another story).  He also went through periods where he didn't want to use his phone.  We were able to get his phone password and email password so we could monitor his communication because he was so vulnerable to being exploited, conned.  We no longer really need to do that.  

I wanted my son to be able to go out in public and not be identified as atypical right away: I washed and folded and put away his clothes and bed linens; I prepared food if he agreed to it; I suggested that he freshen up (shower/brush his teeth) if he went a couple of days. I organized his medications once he was willing to try them and had to provide gentle reminders (if he didn't take it, I'd remind him once again, then let it go that day). I made his appointments and went with him once he agreed to that.  My son was fearful that the dentist was injecting him with poison but will now go to the dentist with plenty of notice.  He will see a doctor and the staff at his first psychosis program.  He still has auditory and some visual hallucinations and I can tell that his brain is ""zapping"" when he has that hundred yard stare or his pupils are dilated.

There is hope for recovery of a sort...we are in the best place that we've been since 2018.  We are playing the long game with our son....we expect he'll live with us for at least the next 10 years but I can truly say that I love him and I'm happy for him to stay with us.  I couldn't have said that 1.5 yrs ago.  I wouldn't have been able to live with him or have our daughter live with him if he hadn't started taking his meds/stayed on his meds...it makes all the difference in his ability to participate in recovery.  He's also been sober for 5 months,  but the antipsychotic meds are a must even if he is using.  He's on an injectable medication that he gets every 2 months.  He just had his 4th dose.  Prior to that he took the oral medication for about a year but it was spotty.  Prior to that life sucked.
