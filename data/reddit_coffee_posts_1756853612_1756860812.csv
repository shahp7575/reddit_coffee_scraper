Crowds moved in steady streams in and out of the shops lining the cobbled streets, juggling bags and packages. In general, they moved with frenzied purpose and a serious lack of holiday spirit. As he wove his way through them, Everett William Sperry, III wondered why in God’s name Brandon felt the need to meet at the Taproom in the midst of all the holiday crazy. This is what on-line shopping is for. To avoid this insanity. Also to avoid all the bell ringers, because he had absolutely no defense against them and felt compelled to drop a substantial donation into every charity bucket he passed. But Brandon had declared a state of emergency, so Everett had come.  
  
  Snow swirled from the pewter sky in fat, wet flakes, sticking to his lashes, his clothes, rapidly slushing up the street of the massive outdoor mall. The hike back to his car when this was over was going to be lots of fun. Everett hunched his shoulders against the bitter wind blowing down from the mountain and picked up the pace. The sooner he got there, the sooner he’d thaw out.  
  
  Up ahead, someone burst out of the Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, flinging the door wide and barreling onto the sidewalk. A middle-aged woman in a puffy pink coat jerked to a halt in an effort to avoid being smacked in the face by the door. The abrupt motion had her feet sliding, the arms full of bags beginning to pinwheel. Everett leapt forward, skidding, and reached for her. The bags went flying, but he managed to catch the woman before she hit the cold, hard ground. The man who’d come out of the chocolate shop never even noticed, already halfway down the block with a cell phone pressed to his ear.  
  
  Nothing like Christmas to bring out the Grinch in people, he thought.  
  
  Planting his feet, Everett righted the woman. “You okay?”  
  
  “Oh my gracious.” She laid a hand over her heart. “You saved me from a broken tail bone at the least.”  
  
  “Least I could do. Nobody wants to spend Christmas sitting on a donut. Here, let me help you with that.” Everett knelt and gathered up the scattered purchases.  
  
  “Thank you, young man,” she said, accepting the collection of bags. “Somebody clearly raised you right.”  
  
  He flashed a smile. “My mama will be happy to hear it. You have a merry Christmas, now.” Everett waited a minute, watching to make sure his rescuee really had her footing back before continuing the remaining couple of blocks to the Taproom.  
  
  The moment he stepped inside, his face and hands began to sting from the heat. Stomping the snow from his boots, he scanned the room, looking for his friend. Brandon sat at the bar, thumbing his phone.  
  
  Stripping off the damp layers, Everett crossed to him. “Okay, I’m here. What’s the emergency?”  
  
  “I need your help with something,” said Brandon, kicking out the stool beside him. “Sit down. Have a drink.”  
  
  Everett draped his coat over the back and sank down onto the stool, loosening his scarf. Because he was frozen through, he asked for coffee instead of a beer. “I swear, if you’ve dragged me out in this mess to help you with your Christmas shopping, I’m going to murder you.”  
  
  “Not exactly,” said Brandon. His hand drummed the bar in rhythm with the jazzy version of “Jingle Bell Rock” playing in the background. His cheeks were faintly flushed and his mouth seemed to be at war between deadly serious and goofy grin.  
  
  “I’m guessing by your expression that nobody died, so what’s going on?” Everett nodded thanks to the bartender as she filled a mug to the brim.  
  
  The grin won the war. “I’m going to propose to Isabelle.”  
  
  Everett waited a beat as that sank in, then grinned himself. “Dude, that’s awesome!” He clapped Brandon on the back. The little brunette had kept his friend besotted for nearly a year now. They were great together. “Am I here to help you plan the thing? Some kind of epic surprise? Will there be a flash mob? We should get Travis in on this.”  
  
  Brandon lifted a brow. “Flash mob? Do I need to be investigating your YouTube viewing history in order to stage an intervention?”  
  
  “I blame my mother. She keeps sending me videos of these epic proposals. I don’t know if she thinks this is going to prompt me to find a woman or what. Anyway, if you need a plan, I’m your man.”  
  
  Brandon waved that away. “No, no, I’m fine on the how. Or I will be. Still working on that. And Travis is on his way. I want your help in picking out a ring.”  
  
  “My help?” asked Everett. “Not that I’m not flattered to be asked, but why?”  
  
  “Well, apart from the fact that this is a big step and I want my closest friends with me when I do it, I want you there because you know about this stuff.”  
  
  “‘This stuff,’” he repeated.  
  
  “Jewelry. Diamonds and stuff,” Brandon clarified.  
  
  “And I know about this how? Because I’ve got a generational suffix after my name?”  
  
  “Because with that blue-blooded upbringing of yours, you’ve been exposed to the real deal. You know quality when you see it. And you know how to use that eyepiece thing jewelers use.”  
  
  “A loupe,” offered Everett, picking up the coffee, warming his hands.  
  
  “Yeah, that. This is a big deal. I’ve gotta get it right.”  
  
  The door opened again and Travis walked in on a swirl of snow and frigid air. He strode over. “Sorry I’m late. What’s going on?”  
  
  “Brandon here is looking to follow in your footsteps,” said Everett.  
  
  “Huh?”  
  
  “I’m asking Isabelle to marry me.”  
  
  Travis whooped. “This calls for a celebration!”  
  
  “Save the celebration for when she says yes,” said Brandon. “We’re going ring shopping.”  
  
  “Want me to call Alicia for a female opinion on this consult?” asked Travis.  
  
  “Absolutely not. This is man’s work,” said Brandon. “There’s some kind of unwritten rule or something that you lose points if you need a girl consult.”  
  
  “Besides, I’m supposed to know about these things,” Everett put in.  
  
  “Well, alright then,” said Travis. “Finish your drinks and let’s get to work.”  
  
  \~\*\~  
  
  As she paced in front of Vandevelde Jewelers, Sylvie Noll cursed Neal Harrier eight ways from Sunday for being a lying, sneaky, yellow coward dog scumbag. Then she chastised herself for insulting the dog.  
  
  How could I have been so stupid to have been taken in by that cretin? she wondered.  
  
  Because he’d wined and dined her, lowering her defenses with charm and gifts, giving every  
impression he was a privileged jetsetter. And she’d bought it, hook, line, and sinker. Damn it, she’d been flattered and dazzled by his good looks, unable to imagine that someone like him would be interested in someone like her.  
  
  Idiot.  
  
  When he said he wanted access to her kitchen to cook her a special meal for their three month anniversary, she’d thought, Oh, how sweet, and given him a key.  
  
  Moron.  
  
  He cleaned her out. TV. Laptop. Jewelry. The Christmas presents she’d bought to mail home to her family in Alabama. The deposit from the gallery that she hadn’t taken to the bank the night before because of the crappy weather. Every single thing of value in her apartment. He’d even found her rainy day emergency stash in the toe of her favorite boots.  
  
  Of course, Sylvie had called the cops. They’d taken her statement, cataloged her missing things. And informed her that the bastard had done the exact same thing to three other women. They were still looking, but the investigating officer surmised that Neal—who’d used other aliases with the other victims—had probably blown town. He suggested that she file a claim on her renters’ insurance.  
  
  Right. The renters’ insurance she didn’t have because she hadn’t been able to afford it.  
  
  She was, in a word, screwed.  
  
  At least the bastard hadn’t gotten keys to the gallery and hadn’t been able to access the stock. Now next month’s rent was almost due on her apartment and the shop, and her landlords were not what you could call sympathetic to her plight. She’d have to move out of the apartment. There was no question of that. But she had to find a way to save her gallery.  
  
  The only thing Sylvie had left that was worth anything was her grandmother’s engagement ring, which she habitually wore on a chain around her neck. She thanked God that the bastard hadn’t gotten away with it, too. It was the only thing she had left of her grandmother. And it could mean the difference between saving the life she’d built here and conceding defeat and slinking home to Alabama as a failure.  
  
  If she could make herself go inside.  
  
  But how could she part with it? What would Mawmaw say?  
  
  Sylvie, my girl, it’s just jewelry. I believed in you when you decided to head out to Colorado in the first place. If this ring will help save you, don’t let a little thing like sentiment hold you back. Think of it as me giving you another little boost.  
  
  “Easy for you to say,” Sylvie muttered.  
  
  The door of Vandevelde’s opened and a man stuck his head out, a polite, but wary expression on his face. “Can I help you, ma’am? Do you need directions?”  
  
  Sylvie jolted and looked around. But, no, he was talking to her. She realized she probably looked like a crazy person trying to decide whether to rob the store.  
  
  “Oh! I…no. That is, I don’t need directions.”  
  
  It’s now or never, girl.  
  
  She braced herself. “And yes, you can help me. I have a ring I was hoping you could take a look at.”  
  
  The man’s face relaxed and he held the door open wider. “Certainly. Please, come in.”  
  
  Sylvie stepped out of the December cold and into the hushed space of the shop. It wasn’t a huge room but the air somehow felt heavy and kind of reverent, like a museum. Glass cases ran in a U along the sides and back, with room for the jeweler behind. He stepped through a little half door into his arena and pulled a pair of bifocals from his shirt front pocket.  
  
  “Now, what can I do for you, Miss?”  
  
  With only a moment’s hesitation, Sylvie pulled the necklace from her sweater and removed the ring. Gently, she handed it over. “It was my grandmother’s.”  
  
  The jeweler took it, examining the art deco setting. “It’s lovely craftsmanship.”  
  
  “I’ve always loved all the filigree. It seems so classy and elegant. Like she was.” As he examined it, Sylvie continued to talk. “She was an actress back in her day. Stage productions, mostly. Tallulah Bankhead was a cousin and helped her get her start up in New York. Mawmaw loved the stage, all the lights and the applause. When she met my granddaddy, she was headlining in America’s Sweetheart on Broadway. He swept her off her feet. So much so that they were married in less than two months, and he gave her this ring. Granddad always used to say that was how he stole America’s sweetheart for his own.”  
  
  The jeweler smiled. “That’s a lovely story.”  
  
  Sylvie flushed. “Sorry. I tend to go on a bit.”  
  
  “S’fine. It’s nice to know the history of a piece.” He peered at her over the glasses. “None of the stones seem to be loose. Did you need it resized?”  
  
  “She absolutely had smaller fingers than I do. Wore a five. Tiny, tiny hands.” You’re babbling, she chided herself. Get to the point. “The fact is, I’m looking to sell it.”  
  
  “Oh? Seems like an important piece to you.”  
  
  “It is. You have no idea.”  
  
  The door opened, interrupting the quiet with the noise of foot traffic outside. Sylvie glanced over to see a trio of men walk in.  
  
  “I’ll be with you gentlemen in a bit,” said the jeweler.  
  
  One lifted his hand. “No rush. We’ll just look around.”  
  
  Sylvie turned back to the counter.  
  
  “You were looking to sell?” he prompted.  
  
  “Oh, yes. Well, I’m in a terrible financial bind. I made the mistake of trusting the wrong person, and I—well, you don’t need all the gory details—but it’s bad, and this is the only thing I have left. I don’t want to sell it, but I really don’t have a choice.”  
  
  “I see.”  
  
  “I came here because you have a reputation for fair pricing. And I swear I’m not making all this up like some kind of sob story to make you feel sorry for me. I’d never do that. I just—sorry, I tend to over share.”  
  
  The jeweler took off the glasses and laid them on the counter.  
  
  Sylvie’s heart sank. He wasn’t going to buy it. She’d be forced to go to a pawn shop, where she’d get pennies on the dollar for what it was actually worth. But the jeweler merely picked up a loupe and began to examine the stones. As her stomach knotted, Sylvie clasped her hands and resigned herself to waiting, while this man determined whether she’d sink or have the chance to keep on swimming.  
  
  \~\*\~  
  
  Everett paused in front of a case of watches and tried to look like he wasn’t shamelessly eavesdropping. It was a terrible compulsion, but the moment she’d mentioned she was in financial trouble, he couldn’t help but tune in.  
  
  She was southern. A drawl underscored the earnest tone as she tried to correct whatever impression she thought she’d given. As the jeweler picked up a loupe to examine the stones in the ring, Everett glanced over at the woman. She wore a good quality red parka, worn but good boots, and seemed properly dressed for the weather. Her blonde hair was pulled back in a loose braid. It gave him a clear view of her profile and the spots of color riding high in her cheeks. Embarrassment. And some anxiety, he thought, catching sight of the hands she was wringing as she waited.  
  
  What had brought her so low that she was selling a piece that clearly meant a lot to her?  
  
  “What do you think of this one over here?”  
  
  “Huh?” Everett turned his attention to Brandon, crossing to a case on the other side to see what he was pointing out. “No, not marquis. Isabelle has little hands. You want something more delicate. Princess or round.”  
  
  The jeweler finished his inspection. “It’s certainly an exquisite piece and there’s a market for antique rings, but you must understand, I won’t be your best bet for maximizing profit.”  
  
  “You have a business to run and access to wholesale markets. I get that.”  
  
  “I wouldn’t ordinarily bring this up, but given your unique circumstance, I feel I should. I have a colleague down in Denver who deals in consignment. He has a generous 70/30 split of the sale price. With the current market, you’d do considerably better going that route.”  
  
  “I appreciate your honesty, but I’m not in a position to wait, and I don’t have a way to get to Denver at the moment. W  
hat’s the best you can do?”  
  
  Everett shifted so he could see the woman as she took the slip of paper the jeweler offered. Her eyes closed after she read it and she swallowed once, hard.  
  
  “I’m sorry it can’t be more.”  
  
  Though she looked pained, the woman nodded. “Let’s do it.”  
  
  “I’ll put together the paperwork.”  
  
  As the jeweler disappeared to an office in the back, the woman knuckled away tears and picked up the ring. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.  
  
  Travis elbowed him. “Earth to Everett. How about checking back in to this planet and offering up some opinions.”  
  
  “Sorry, sorry.”  
  
  As they debated the merits of white gold versus platinum, simple versus ornate, half of Everett’s mind was on the woman.  
  
  I trusted the wrong person.  
  
  Who would take advantage of such a sweet soul? Or maybe that was exactly it. Somebody thought she’d make a good mark. And evidently she had if she was in deep enough to be here. He wished he could do something to help.  
  
  As the jeweler re-emerged, paperwork in hand, Brandon called out, “When you get a minute, we’ve got a few engagement rings we’d like to see.”  
  
  “Be right with you.”  
  
  “Dude, what’s up with you?” whispered Brandon.  
  
  “Nothing. I just couldn’t help overhearing.” He nodded toward the woman.  
  
  “Yeah. Sucky situation all around,” conceded Brandon. “Nothing you can do about it, though. Even if there was, she’s gone now.”  
  
  Everett whipped around in time to see her striding out the door, heading west.  
  
  “What can I help you gentlemen with?” inquired the jeweler, coming around to their side of the store.  
  
  Travis slapped Brandon on the back. “My buddy here is looking to get himself hitched.”  
  
  “Congratulations, sir. What sort of ring are you in the market for?”  
  
  “Actually, can we see the one you just bought?” asked Everett.  
  
  “Certainly.” The jeweler retrieved it.

Brandon held it up. “I don’t know. It looks pretty small. Isabelle’s tiny, but not that tiny.”  
  
  “We can resize anything that isn’t the correct size.”  
  
  “May I?” Everett held out a hand. The round cut sapphire was flanked by smaller accent diamonds in an ornate, antique setting.  
  
  “The story that came with it was rather sweet. Her grandmother was a Broadway star back in her day. Had a whirlwind romance with the grandfather and with this ring, he stole America’s sweetheart.”  
  
  A story like that made this a real part of a family history. An heirloom. Everett had been taught to respect and value such things. He suspected from the seller’s level of upset that she had, as well. Which made the situation that much more tragic. The ring itself was a lovely piece, but it could’ve been hideous and he still would’ve asked, “How much?”  
  
  “Wait a minute,” protested Brandon. “I haven’t even looked at these others. And I think she’d prefer a traditional diamond.”  
  
  “Not for you,” said Everett. “How much?”  
  
  The jeweler named a figure.  
  
  Everett didn’t blink. “Ring it up.”  
  
  “Man, what the hell are you doing?” asked Brandon.  
  
  “My good deed for the year. If you could ring it up fast, that would be great.”  
  
  “Everett, buddy, are you about to do what I think you’re about to do?” asked Travis. He kept his voice light and even, the kind of tone you used with a person threatening to jump off a ledge.  
  
  “I have no idea what you think I’m about to do.” Everett handed over his credit card.  
  
  “I think you’re about to buy an engagement ring for a perfect stranger.”  
  
  “Then yes, I’m doing exactly what you think I’m doing.”  
  
  “This is insane,” said Brandon.  
  
  “Life’s too short not to be a little crazy once in a while. Besides, it’s not like I’m proposing. I just want to give it back to her.” Everett signed the credit card receipt and accepted the ring in a box. Saluting his friends, he said, “I’ll be right back!”  
  
  He bolted out of Vandevelde’s and headed the direction the woman had turned, eyes searching for the red parka and blonde hair. The slushy sidewalks kept him from sprinting, so he took the opportunity to glance through storefront windows. Given the apparently dire state of her finances, Everett didn’t figure she’d have been stopping in any of them to shop, but he didn’t want to risk missing her. It should’ve been easy, even with the crowd, but he didn’t see her.  
  
  She had a five minute head start. How far could she have gotten?  
  
  Everett went all the way to the parking area, but there was no sign of the woman who’d sold the ring.  
  
  I’ll just get her name from the jeweler. He’ll have a record from the sale, he thought.  
  
  Back at Vandevelde’s, Brandon and Travis had narrowed it down to three choices.  
  
  “Find her?” asked Travis.  
  
  “No,” Everett admitted. He looked to the man behind the counter. “Can I get her name and number to arrange a meeting to give the ring back to her?”  
  
  “I’m afraid I have a policy of strict confidentiality of my client’s information.”  
  
  Everett tried a smile. “But surely you could make an exception this one time. In the name of a good cause.”  
  
  “Young man, you may be as well intentioned as you seem. Or you could just as easily be a potential thief or worse. That young lady has had enough trouble in her life. I won’t be the cause of more.”  
  
  Everett tamped down on his disappointment. “No, it’s all right. I understand.”  
  
  “So what are you going to do?” asked Brandon.  
  
  “Keep looking. It’s doubtful she’d have had any knowledge of the store’s reputation if she wasn’t a local. Town’s just not that big. I’ll run into her eventually.” Everett moved over to the counter. “Now, let’s see those contenders.”  
  
  \~\*\~  
  
  “The groundhog lied,” declared Brenna, plunking down into a chair. “There is absotively no evidence of spring out there.”  
  
  Sylvie smiled at her new roommate and speared a chip into the bowl of queso. “You do realize that Punxsutawney Phil has absolutely no bearing on whether we’re getting spring early or having more winter, right?”  
  
  “Spare me the lecture and gimme some of that cheese dip. God, it’s freezing.”  
  
  Sylvie shoved the basket of chips closer. “There’s something wrong when the southerner isn’t the one bitching about the cold.”  
  
  “I am from Tucson,” Brenna protested.  
  
  “Fair enough. At least we do get a little snow in Huntsville.”  
  
  “I rest my case.” She paused when the waiter arrived to take her drink order and asked for a margarita. “How were things at the gallery today?”  
  
  “Good. I’m nearly finished setting up for the Baudelaire showing that starts next week. And while I was uncrating his paintings, somebody wandered in and bought a sculpture by Lily Birdsong.”  
  
  “Oh yeah? Which one?”  
  
  “The steampunk pygmy owl.”  
  
  “I loved that one!” exclaimed Brenna. “He reminded me of Pigwidgeon from Harry Potter.”  
  
  “A small piece, but a really nice sale,” said Sylvie. “And the buyer absolutely had his eye on her copper hawk. I think there’s a good chance he may be back.”  
  
  The server returned with Brenna’s margarita, which she immediately lifted in a toast. “This calls for celebration!”  
  
  Sylvie clinked her glass to Brenna’s.  
  
  Things were better. So much better than she could have anticipated at Christmas, when everything seemed to be falling apart. She’d moved out of her apartment and into the stock room at the gallery. Sylvie hadn’t slept much during those weeks, constantly worried her landlord would find out and she’d be booted from that space too. Then Brenna, one of the Western artists Sylvie featured in her gallery, had found out about her plight and immediately offered up her spare room. With the sale of the ring and the padding of some post Christmas sales at the gallery, she’d been able to keep her head above water. As a special bonus, Sylvie ended up making a new BFF, something she hadn’t managed during her first two backbreaking years in Colorado. She’d always liked Brenna, but living in close quarters had showed her a soul sister.  
  
  Neal still hadn’t been caught, but things were looking up.  
  
  Conversation flowed free and easy over chips and queso, shifting from art to the latest episode of Iron Chef, to the current romantic comedy in the theaters.  
  
  “We should go this weekend,” Brenna declared. “Adam practically broke out in hives the last time I suggested a romcom. I swear, the man doesn’t understand that sappy movies totally prime me for other activities he’d totally be into.”  
  
  Sylvie snickered. “His loss.”  
  
  “Damn straight,” Brenna agreed. “So when are you getting back out there?”  
  
  “Back out where?”  
  
  “Duh. The dating pool.”  
  
  “Oh, I don’t know…a quarter after never?” suggested Sylvie.  
  
  “Come on, Syl. You can’t stay off the market forever just because one guy turned out to be a stinker.”  
  
  “He was more than a stinker.”  
  
  “Okay, yeah, he was a total reprobate,” Brenna admitted.  
  
  “Reprobate?”  
  
  “Asswipe?”  
  
  “That works.”  
  
  “But not all guys are like that.”  
  
  “You’ll forgive me if I don’t trust my judgment at the moment.”  
  
  “If you won’t trust your judgment, trust a system.”  
  
  “A system?”  
  
  “Sure. You should try online dating.”  
  
  “How about hell no?” suggested Sylvie.  
  
  “Wait, wait. Hear me out. Perfect Chemistry does background checks on all the people who sign up. And you have to provide a social security number to prove you are who you say you are and that you don’t have a criminal record, so nobody can go in and just make up an alias. Their whole system is set up on some kind of psychological matc  
hmaking research, so you’re bound to do better than by chance.”  
  
  “Is that how you met Adam of the won’t watch your favorite kind of movie persuasion?” Sylvia asked.  
  
  “I said better than by chance, not perfect,” Brenna qualified. “But seriously, despite some flaws, Adam’s pretty awesome. And I had good dates with a handful of others before I started going out with him.”  
  
  Knowing her friend wasn’t about to let this go, Sylvie sighed and conceded. “Fine. I’ll consider it.”  
  
  Brenna’s dimples flashed.  
  
  “What?” asked Sylvie. “I recognize that impish look. What did you do?”  
  
  All innocence, Brenna studied her pink, glitter polish-coated nails. “I might have set up a profile for you already. And you might already have some matches in your inbox wanting to talk.”  
  
  “Brenna!”  
  
  “What? You weren’t going to act on your own. I’m just giving you a little nudge out of the nest.”  
  
  “A boot to the ass is more like it,” Sylvie grumbled.  
  
  “Just look at their profiles. Talk to a few of them. There’s absolutely no rule that says you have to actually go out with anybody. But it won’t hurt you to dip a toe back in.”  
  
  The idea of having somebody screen dates was kind of appealing. And Lord knew she’d been working her butt off since Christmas. It wouldn’t be a bad thing to have a little fun. “Well okay,” said Sylvie. “Just remember, if something goes sideways and I end up with another Neal, this was all your idea.”  
  
  Brenna clapped in delight. “Excellent! Hurry up and finish your fajitas. I want to go home and check your profile.”  
  
  “Exactly why are you so pumped about this?”  
  
  “Apart from the fact that my stake in this is ultimately potential double date material, I’ll get vicarious thrills from watching you squirm.”  
  
  Sylvie’s lips curved in a wry smile. “You’re a real Saint.”  
  
  \~\*\~  
  
  “I thought we were doing Mexican,” said Everett.  
  
  “The bride-to-be wanted hibachi,” explained Brandon as he wheeled into the parking lot of the local Japanese steakhouse. “When she surfaces from an edit, she eats like a stevedore. I’ve learned not to argue.”  
  
  From the passenger seat, Isabelle shot him an affectionate look. “You’re just weirded out by the fact that I can out eat you.”  
  
  “Well, you’re half my size,” he remarked. “I don’t know where you put it.”  
  
  The pair continued their teasing banter all the way inside. Everett followed, grinning. He liked the way they were together, liked what they brought out in each other.  
  
  Brandon asked for a table for three. As they followed the hostess, Everett’s gaze swept the restaurant, automatically checking for that blonde hair, as had become his habit over the past weeks. But she wasn’t here. Just as she hadn’t been anywhere else he’d been since she’d walked out of Vandevelde’s. He pocketed the ring box he’d been compulsively juggling in his palm and sat.  
  
  “Why are you still toting that thing around?” asked Brandon. “It’s been nearly two months. You ought to go sell it back or put it on consignment somewhere. Get some of your money back.”  
  
  “Money’s not the point,” said Everett. “This is a piece of her family history. She deserves to have it back.”  
  
  “Well, I think it’s sweet and romantic,” said Isabelle.  
  
  “You would,” Brandon said, tugging lightly at the end of her pony tail.  
  
  “Romance wasn’t what I had in mind when I did it,” insisted Everett. “I just wanted to do something nice for somebody in a bad spot.”  
  
  “You’ve made a career doing nice stuff for people in bad spots,” Brandon pointed out. “That would be the entire point of your non-profit, remember?”  
  
  Everett waved that off. “That’s different.”  
  
  “You’re probably lucky you haven’t found this woman. She’d probably take one look at you, recognize you for the blue blood with the biggest, squishiest heart in all of Colorado, and take you to the cleaners.”  
  
  Everett jerked a thumb at him and looked at Isabelle. “You sure you want to marry this cynic?”  
  
  “I’m making it my mission in life to convert him,” she said. “What have you done to track her down?”  
  
  “Well, Mr. Vandevelde was understandably reluctant to give me her information on the front end. Confidentiality and all that. And he was absolutely right. I went back later and had him call to try and set up a meeting at the store, but the number she’d given on her paperwork was no longer in service. Since then, I’ve been mostly back to square one.”  
  
  “With the number disconnected, she’s probably not even still here,” said Brandon.  
  
  Isabelle elbowed him in the ribs. “Ye of little faith. Is there anything you have to go on? Would he give you her name?”  
  
  Everett shook his head. “And that’s fair too. Somebody had taken awful advantage of her to put her in the position to sell the ring in the first place. He has no way of knowing I wouldn’t do the same. I’ve gotta respect that. But it makes things difficult.”  
  
  “I think you need to get out there and look for a real woman instead of holding out for some girl you’re never going to see again,” Brandon insisted.  
  
  “I’m not holding out for her,” Everett protested. “I didn’t do this with some motive of wrangling a date out of it. That would be unethical.”  
  
  Brandon just arched a brow. “Have you been out with anybody since you bought that thing?”  
  
  “Well, no. But things were busy with the holidays, and January is always a busy month at work, and I…” He trailed off at his friend’s bland stare.  
  
  Maybe he had avoided seeking out a date since December. But the search for his mystery woman had captured his imagination. How would a potential date react if he talked about it, as he inevitably would? What normal guy did what he’d done? No normal guy was the truth of it. Normal guys didn’t have the discretionary income to indulge in such a crazy gesture.  
  
  “I think you’ve built her up in your mind,” said Brandon. “Got this whole damsel in distress thing going on and you the knight in armor and all that. It’s a thing with you, that whole addiction to rescuing people.”  
  
  “So long as he’s not taking crazy risks with life and limb, I don’t see how that’s a bad addiction,” countered Isabelle. “Though I can see how that might put you in a position to be taken advantage of yourself.”  
  
  Brandon threw out a hand in a See? gesture. “Thank you.”  
  
  Everett glared. “I’m hardly some bumbling rube without an ounce of common sense.”  
  
  “No, you’re just determined to see the best in people.” Brandon held up a hand for peace before Everett could respond. “I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that. But not everybody’s as nice as you.”  
  
  “So let me get this straight. I’m supposed to give up on finding the woman who sold this ring, stop being nice to everybody, and go out and find somebody to date?”  
  
  “I never said you should stop being nice to people. But yeah, I think you need to come to grips with the fact you may never find this woman.”  
  
  “Well, I’ve got an alternative plan,” said Isabelle.  
  
  Everett lifted his sake. “I’m game to hear it.”  
  
  “You know how when you’re looking for something and can’t find it, it’s not until you stop looking and go do something else that it pops up? Maybe you going out with somebody else will work like that for you. And if it doesn’t, then you still might meet Miss Right.”  
  
  “You happily engaged couples keep trying to marry everybody off,” accused Everett.  
  
  Isabelle laid a hand over his. “We just want to see you happy.”  
  
  Everett sighed. “It’s hard to argue with that.”  
  
  She smiled. “You should check out online dating. My friend Leah met her guy through Perfect Chemistry. And indirectly, that’s how I met Brandon.”  
  
  “Fine. I concede your point. I’ve tried everything else, so I might as well try not looking and see what happens.” />  
  “I don’t believe you,” said Brandon.  
  
  “No? Fine. Just to prove my seriousness, I will sit here and fill out the stinking profile from my phone for your approval.”  
  
  It took a while between juggling conversation, ordering, eating the soup and salad, but by the time the chef was done with their little show, Everett had finished. He handed the phone over. “There. See?”  
  
  “Good man. Now let’s see what kind of matches the site comes up with.”  
  
  Everett rolled his eyes as Brandon began playing with the screen.  
  
  “It’s given you seven matches right off.”  
  
  “Possibly because they are the only available women in our area, in the age range, who have profiles on the site,” suggested Everett.  
  
  Brandon ignored that. “Let’s see. There’s Anne. Age 26. Oooh, a red-head veterinarian. You’re an animal lover. That could be a good pair. Then there’s Lina. She’s a brunette. Age 30. She’s a ski instructor.” He tapped some more. “Oh, here we go. This one is an art lover with an addiction to Mexican food. Quite a looker, too.” Brandon passed the phone back.  
  
  And there she was, staring out at him from the screen. It was a three/quarters profile shot. Casual. Someone had caught her on the verge of a smile as she stood on a trail somewhere in the red parka he’d been looking for all this time. Her eyes were hazel, long-lashed and bracketed by laugh lines.  
  
  “Holy shit,” breathed Everett.  
  
  “What?” asked Brandon.  
  
  “I didn’t think it would actually work.” He looked up. “This is her.”  
  
  “Wait, seriously?” asked Isabelle, leaning over to peer at the phone. “That’s totally not how I thought it would work. I figured you’d go out with somebody else and run into her somewhere. Not that she’d be, like, hand-delivered to your phone.”  
  
  “What are the odds? I mean, it’s not that big a town, I guess, but still.”  
  
  “We’ll just say it was your mouth to God’s ear,” said Everett, darting in to kiss Isabelle’s cheek.  
  
  “What’s her name?  
  
  “Sylvie,” Everett murmured. “Her name is Sylvie.” A sweet name, he thought.  
  
  “Well, I call this a sign,” said Isabelle.  
  
  “So now what?” asked Brandon. “You can’t just up and say, ‘Hey, I bought your grandmother’s ring and I’ve been trying to find you for two months to return it,’” warned Brandon. “You’d look like a creepy stalker guy.

I’m a junior at university, and I’ve been thinking about rushing. There are two Asian-interest sororities at my school. I already know I want to join one specific sorority in the spring, and I’m determined to stick with that.

One of my classmates (who I really like and get along with) is in the *other* Asian-interest sorority—the one I’m not interested in. We’ve hung out a few times (even went to a coffee shop together), and she’s been really sweet. She invited me to her sorority’s rush events. I didn’t go to the first one, but now she invited me to the next one.

I feel awkward because I don’t think it’s a good idea to go to 2 different sorority rush events, especially when I know I’m only interested in the other one. My sister told me I should just be honest and say I’m not interested in her sorority. But I don’t want to hurt her feelings or make things weird between us.

What should I say or do in this situation?",1,1756860537.0,Sororities,1,1.0,False

1n70uer,https://i.redd.it/7uvr5er1kumf1.jpeg,Signatory Vintage Edradour 2000 23 Years 1st Fill Oloroso Sherry Butt Cask #3151 56.2%,"Follow my Instagram! 🥃 
www.instagram.com/artfuldrammer

With its character and heft, this dram deserves respect, and stage time of its own. Dirty, funky, unrepentantly decadent, and distinct.

A deep, glowing umber spirit skirted by amber hues under the light. Dangerously dark, dense, and powerful. On the nose, boiled plums and mangosteens delivered the first punch, followed by a very loaded, and intense wave of wood varnish, dark chocolate, coffee grounds and monkfruit tea.

Rounding the aromas up, is that unmistakable Edradour funk, reminiscent of my old army boots after a day of stomping under berry-bearing trees.
On the palate, an initial river of milk chocolate, caramel, and oaky varnish. A decadent, syrupy consistency and richness.

As the dram swirled around the palate, the typical Edradour-wasabi spirit hits right out of the blue, blossoming into fireworks of fruit jams. 
Raisins, strawberries, cherries, and citrus hints could be detected. The kick of the spirit remains for the whole ride, carrying us to a calmer pool of boot leather, old oak, and the throes of a good Pinot Noir.
This may be a little spicy for some, but knowing Edradour, this is simply a characteristic. The revered 21- and 30-year-old offerings possess this similar trait. 
Adding a couple drops of water tempers the spice and opens the flavour profiles wonderfully.

Finish was long, showcasing ebbing strains of wood tannins, blackberries, cocoa powder, the same damn boots, and the air of a leather carpenter's workshop.

1n70snp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n70snp,AIO for thinking my fiancé is acting shady because he didn’t tell me he was visiting his ex’s house super early in the morning?,"I’ll be typing this whole thing in upper case so it’s easier to read this huge post! And yeah, sorry if this post is unnecessarily long, I’m a bad storyteller and sometimes put unnecessary details in my stories. :(

Again, sorry for the long post, I tried my best to break it up into paragraphs. :((

FYI this is a burner account because my fiancé and our friends all use Reddit and have my account. We all follow each other.

Okay, so I (18F) am engaged to my fiancé (26M), we’ll call him Dylan. Dylan and I have been dating for 2 years and he recently proposed on my birthday in June. It was super sweet and both of our families and friends were present and it was probably the best birthday present I could’ve asked for. Seriously, I still get butterflies thinking about it. Now, fast forward to September. School has recently started not too long ago for my state and my fiancé works as a teacher at my old high school. Don’t worry, he wasn’t a teacher then, he was just a TA. We barely even saw each other. However, since summer break is over, this means he’s gone earlier in the mornings before I wake up which doesn’t bother me. School starts at 7:05 am on the dot, so he has to be there by at least 6:25 am. He typically leaves at around 6:00-ish because the school isn’t too far from his house and the traffic never usually starts until like around 6:30. School started in August, so I’ve started getting used to waking up and him not being there. However, I’ve decided to start waking up earlier and surprising him with some form of breakfast. Nothing fancy, just a toasted bagel with egg, ham, and cheese in between and a coffee to go with it. Since Dylan pays for the bills in his own home, I figured the least I could do is make breakfast when he leaves and make some sort of dinner when he comes home if I am home. Like I said, I live with my parents, so I’m not at his house all the time. However, yesterday, I woke up at around 5:00 am to make him breakfast, like I always do whenever I have the time. But, when I went downstairs, he was already sitting on the couch and pulling his shoes on which really confused me because normally he’s just waking up around that time too.

I asked Dylan why he was dressed so early and he looked kind of startled to see me but he told me he has to go in early to fill in for another teacher who was going to be absent that day. I was confused and asked why they couldn’t just get a substitute teacher and asked who was going to fill in for his own class. He said the school would take care of it but they told him he needed to fill in for this teacher’s class and that he has to leave earlier to “prepare” for it or something. I asked Dylan, “What about breakfast?” And he told me that he’ll just stop at a gas station and grab something quick on the way. I was honestly so sleepy, I didn’t even remember what else he said because he just kissed my forehead and before I opened my eyes again, he was out the door. I was so confused, I just went back to sleep. But, when I woke up again way later, I thought about it and wondered why he couldn’t just leave at his usual time if he needed to be a substitute? And why the school couldn’t just get a substitute to cover that class? I literally went to that school since middle school in 2018 and I know that they have a regular set of substitute teachers. It’s to the point where me and my friends used to memorize which subs were strict and which ones were more chill. So, a teacher covering another teacher’s class has literally never happened and if it has, it’s super rare. I’m upset with myself for not bringing this up earlier in the text messages, but I was pretty emotional and not thinking clearly at the time. For context, “Lauren” (24F) is his ex-girlfriend. They dated for 7 years from 2015-2021 so they were already a thing before I even moved to our state in 2017 and Lauren is actually a family friend. Dylan said that lockdown during the pandemic made them realize they were just incompatible and they split on good terms in 2021, just two years before Dylan asked me out. Dylan, Lauren, and our two other friends Anna (25F) and Anna’s husband, Josh (28M) are all in the same friend group by the way. Yes, this matters. 

Basically, the same day he had left super early, Lauren invited us over to her place to watch a movie in the afternoon. While we were there just talking, I had these really intense pre-period cramps and Lauren told me to go into her bedroom and into the bathroom where the medicine was so I could take some ibuprofen. While I was in the bedroom, I saw something familiar on the dresser. They were Dylan’s glasses. He left the house that morning with his glasses on and I knew they were his glasses because they were just recognizable. I know I sound crazy but those glasses couldn’t have been anybody else’s but Dylan’s. I didn’t know what to do, so I grabbed them, got the ibuprofen and headed downstairs. I asked Lauren why Dylan’s glasses were on her dresser and Lauren, Anna, and Josh all got super quiet. I was super thrown off by the way all three of them just stared at me.

Lauren just shrugged and told me to return them to Dylan if I went to his house. I looked to Anna and Josh because I was confused why they were so quiet and refusing to look at me when Lauren just casually mentioned to Anna, not me, that Dylan had to come by to pick up something and all three of them agreed which felt super weird. Normally, I wouldn’t have cared if Dylan went over to Lauren’s place because he’s an adult and he can do whatever he wants and we’re all friends with Lauren but the dresser beside Lauren’s bed was a weird place to find his glasses. Also the way my friends acted when I brought it up felt weird. I ended up going home early because I didn’t feel too well. I ended up calling Dylan and asking why he left his glasses there and why he lied and didn’t tell me that that was where he was going. I would’ve been fine if he had gone, I just don’t get why he had to lie and not tell me. Dylan said that he “didn’t need this from me right now” and then hung up on me. I burst into tears because never has Dylan ever hung up on me. Then that whole text exchange between me and Dylan happened. I’m at my parents’ house right now instead of Dylan’s because he is refusing to speak to me over this. He feels upset that I would accuse him of something like this and our friends are siding with him. Anna reached out to me. She called me and told me that she understands that this is my first relationship but I can’t just accuse the person I’m going to marry of cheating. Josh also agreed and said that I was being childish and acting immaturely. Dylan also said the same thing and Lauren is refusing to speak to me because she’s super hurt that I would ever think she would do that behind my back. They all think I am being childish and overreacting over nothing, but I don’t know. My other friend (18F) who is an online friend told me that it’s weird and that I should check his phone but I don’t want to be a jealous girlfriend.

So, Reddit, am I overreacting? Please tell me because all of my friends and my fiancé are super upset with me and I’m starting to wonder if I caused trouble. I know I shouldn’t care if Dylan goes over to Lauren’s house because we are all friends but I don’t know why he didn’t tell me. I feel like I’m crazy because my entire friend group is saying I’m making something out of nothing and that I’m doing too much. I just don’t know anymore and I’m so tired. :(",1,1756860293.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.67,False
1n70scx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1n70scx/last_bridge_home_by_iris_johansen_free_read_online/,Last Bridge Home by Iris Johansen Free Read online," THE GRAY FORD SEDAN WASN’T PARKED ON THE tree-shadowed side road today.  
  
  Elizabeth Ramsey loosened her white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel as she slowed her car. She sighed with relief. She hadn’t realized how tightly she had been clutching the wheel until the tension suddenly flowed out of her like air rushing from a pricked balloon.  
  
  Stupid. She was being so incredibly stupid. She’d only seen the car parked there four times. It was possible there was no one in the car. Perhaps the driver was a hunter or some one as innocuous as a bird watcher. She had never felt afraid before on this lonely stretch of road, which led to Mill Cottage. It had just been the way home. The road she loved most in the entire world.  
  
  It must be pregnant lady’s nerves, she decided with a grimace. She had never thought she would be prone to this sort of weakness, but she had learned she wasn’t nearly as pragmatic as she had once believed in the eight months since Mark had died and … She firmly blocked the thought before it could take root and flourish as the familiar barbs of pain. Think about the baby. The baby. Don’t think about Mark or the past.  
  
  Her hand left the steering wheel to rest on the taut swelling of her stomach through the cotton of her loose blue shirt. Life. Soon. All she had to do was hold on a little longer, and then the loneliness would be over for both of them. There was a slight movement beneath her palm and her lips curved in a warm smile of delight. It was almost as if Andrew had read her thoughts and was trying to reassure her.  
  
  The tender smile still lingered on her lips as her hand returned to the steering wheel. Maybe this imagining business wasn’t so bad after all. Not if it brought comfort as well as those silly spurts of panic. She had been foolish to worry.  
  
  She speeded up as she drove into the old covered bridge and the familiar rumble of the planks beneath the tires of her station wagon murmured a soothing chant of the homecoming that was just beyond the next turn in the road. She left the bridge, negotiated the serpentine curve, and Mill Cottage came into view. She immediately felt a surge of peace and reassurance. The ivy-covered stone cottage was very old and had a serenity about it which was rarely found in modern architecture. From her seat in the car, she could see the ancient oak paddle wheel that had powered the mill and furnished the first American Cartwrights with their livelihood. The wheel was still now, and no longer churned the waters of the smooth silver stream winding through the meadow and into the distant woods. Most of the trees in the woods were bare, only the pines retained their greenery. She shivered, and looked once again at the cottage. Home. Inviting, welcoming, warmth in a world that would soon know winter. She rounded the last bend in the road, and the driveway of the cottage appeared before her.  
  
  She inhaled sharply as she spotted a man standing on the stone steps at the front door of the cottage. A man she had never seen be fore. Immediately her gaze flew to the car parked in the driveway. It was a dark green pickup truck, not a gray Ford sedan.  
  
  She pulled her car into the driveway and slowed it to a stop. Nerves or no nerves, it wouldn’t hurt to be cautious. She kept her windows rolled up and the doors locked. The man, who was coming down the steps now, didn’t look menacing, but he didn’t look like the Caspar Milquetoast type either. There was something very controlled about his deliberate approach. Controlled. What an odd word to come to mind, she thought. His deeply tanned face was completely impassive, yet she had the impression he was exerting a tremendous effort to subdue forces that were seething below the surface of his calm exterior.  
  
  Standing beside her window, he bent down slightly to look at her. He spoke in a tone a level above normal so she could hear through the glass. “I’m glad you’re being cautious. It’s very lonely out here for a woman alone. I’ve been waiting for you.”  
  
  He was gazing at her with an odd, almost hungry, intentness. The thought that he was only inches away, separated from her by a flimsy sheet of glass, sent a sudden shudder of fear through her. His eyes were darkly brilliant, his black brows heavy, and his bone structure was too strongly defined to ever be termed handsome. Strength. A strength so powerful it was a shock to her senses. She found herself staring at him in wide-eyed fascination.  
  
  He frowned. “For God’s sake, stop looking at me like that.” His voice was rough and slightly husky. “I’m not going to hurt you. I’m here to help you. I’d never—” He broke off and drew a deep breath. “Look, I’m sorry if I startled you. Let’s begin again. My name is Jon Sandell and Mark Ramsey was my cousin. Per haps he mentioned me?”  
  
  Jon Sandell. She felt a swift swell of relief and hurriedly rolled down the window. “Of course he did. I’m very glad to meet you at last.” She grinned and wrinkled her nose at him. “Though you probably think I’m flighty as a loon to treat you as if you were Charles Manson. I’m not usually this uptight. I guess I have a case of prenatal jitters.” She opened the door and swung her khaki-clad legs carefully to the ground. It was a massive undertaking for her to get herself out from behind the steering wheel these days. Jan Sandell stepped forward and lifted her easily from the seat and onto her feet.  
  
  “Oh, thank you, that helped a lot. I’ll be with you in just a minute. I have to get the groceries out of the car. I stopped at the supermarket on the way home from school, which delayed me a bit. Have you been waiting long?”  
  
  “No.” He was frowning again. “You shouldn’t be out here by yourself. It may have been all right before, but now that you’re—”  
  
  “—big as a house,”  
she finished for him. She shut the car door and went around to the back of the station wagon. “This is my home. Where else would I go?” She unlocked and opened the gate. “Besides, I’m not alone. The Spauldings have a farm two miles down the road, and I have Sam.”  
  
  He stiffened. “Sam?”  
  
  She gazed at him in puzzlement. Why was he so disturbed? Then the answer came to her. Mark had said Jon Sandell was the only family he possessed. They must have been very close. It was only natural that Mark’s cousin would be upset to find out there was an other man in her life only eight months after Mark’s death.  
  
  “Sam is my Heinz 57,” she said with a gentle smile. “He’s half Great Dane and half I-don’t-know-what. I’m surprised you haven’t seen him. I let him run loose while I’m at school.”  
  
  “You’re still attending the university in Al bany?” he asked as he stopped her from reaching for the grocery bags. A small amount of tension seemed to have disappeared from his demeanor. “You go on inside. It’s cold out here now that the sun’s gone down. I’ll bring these in.”  
  
  “You’ll stay for dinner? I put a stew in the Crockpot this morning. There will be plenty for two.”  
  
  He shook his head. “I can’t stay but I’d like a cup of coffee and a little conversation, if it’s not too much trouble.”  
  
  She shook her head as she turned and headed for the steps. “Of course it’s not too much trouble. I’d like to talk to you too.” She glanced back over her shoulder as she un locked the heavy Dutch door. A smile lit her face with glowing warmth, and she said, “Mark was a stranger in these parts and not many people got to know him well enough to realize how wonderful he was. I think one of the things I missed most after he died was not being able to talk to someone who loved him as much as I did.”  
  
  He was gazing at her face with the same in tent expression she had noticed earlier. “I wanted to come to you then, but they wouldn’t let me.”  
  
  “I understood why you couldn’t come to the funeral. Mark had told me you are out of the country most of the time.”  
  
  He reached in the wagon for a grocery sack. “That’s a fairly accurate way of phrasing it. Well, I’m here now. Why don’t you go inside.”  
  
  His last words were a command, spoken with the casual confidence of someone accustomed to being obeyed. Whoever “they” were, they must have been exceptionally high up in the echelon of Sandell’s company to prevent him from doing anything he wanted to do. She saluted. “I’ll put the coffee on, sir.”  
  
  He looked up, and for the flicker of a moment there was a warm smile on his hard face. “Was I being authoritarian? I was in the military for a while and I guess you never really lose a sense of command.”  
  
  She should have realized Sandell was a military man. He certainly looked the part, she thought. His shoulders were broad and powerful beneath the brown plaid of his mackinaw, and he moved with crisp precision.  
  
  “I guess you don’t.” She swung open the door and left it ajar for him as she moved briskly down the hall to the large kitchen which stretched the length of the rear of the cottage.  
  
  Switching on the light, she hurried over to the counter and plugged in the coffee maker, which she had readied before she had left that morning. Then she knelt and touched a lighted match to the kindling in the brick fireplace, watching with satisfaction as the fire sprang cozily to life. It was her routine to have all the preparations for the evening out of the way when she walked out the door in the morning. She had discovered early in her pregnancy that by the time she put in a full day at school, she was often too tired for anything but a bath and bed.  
  
  “If you’ll tell me where things go in the cup board, I’ll put them away for you.” Jon Sandell was standing in the doorway with three bags balanced in his arms.  
  
  “I’ll put them away later, just set them on the counter.” She took the plastic bag containing the items that needed refrigeration, and crossed the parquet floor to the Coppertone refrigerator against the wall. “You can get cups and saucers from the cupboard to your left, if you like. Do you use milk or sugar?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Neither do I.” She put the eggs, milk, and butter into the refrigerator. “I like my coffee black as sin and loaded with caffeine. I’ve been drinking it without caffeine lately because it’s better for the baby, but I still miss the pick-me-up it gave me.” One hand absently rubbed the hollow of her spine as she closed the refrigerator door. “And weighing as much as I do these days, it takes a heck of a lot to pick me u—” She broke off as she turned to face him. “You’re looking at me very oddly. Is something wrong?”  
  
  “No.” He looked away as he took two cups and saucers from the cupboard shelf. “I was just thinking how beautiful you are.”  
  
  She laughed with genuine amusement. “I’m not even pretty. Lord, you must have been out of the country and away from civilization and women for a long time. Where were you any way? In the wilds of the Sahara? Remind me to introduce you to my neighbor, Serena Spaulding. She’s simply gorgeous.”  
  
  She took the coffee carafe and crossed the room to where he was standing. “But thanks anyway for trying to make a fat, pregnant lady feel good.” She poured the steaming liquid into the cups and turned to set the carafe on the warmer. “Take off your coat and sit down.” She shrugged out of her heavy navy peacoat. “I’ll be right back. I have to call Sam and tell him it’s chow time.”  
  
  “I wouldn’t think a Great Dane would have to be told.”  
  
  “Usually he doesn’t.” Her brow knotted with a frown. “I don’t know why he wasn’t here to meet me. I’ll be right back.”  
  
  She returned in less than five minutes, “He didn’t come when I called.” She came slowly toward him, the worried frown still on her face. “Crazy dog. He’s probably out chasing rabbits again.”  
  
  Sitting down across from him at the round oak table, she straightened her shoulders as if to shrug off a burden. “Sorry, I seem to be on an anxiety kick lately. I’ve been blaming it on Andrew. He can’t talk back yet.”  
  
  “Andrew?”  
  
  “My son. It’s a boy. I asked the doctor for an amniocentesis; it’s a test that detects any genetic or other problems and spins off the fascinating information of the sex of the unborn child.” She looked down at her coffee, her index finger gently rubbing the side of the cup. “After Mark died I needed more than a faceless entity to share my body. I needed to know my baby was all right, as well as a real person, a pompanion.” She lifted her eyes to meet his gaze. “Do you understand?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  He said nothing else, yet she felt a warmth sweep through her unlike anything she had ever known. For a moment it seemed impossible to tear her gaze away from his. Her throat felt tight and she had difficulty breathing. She picked up her cup and cradled it in her palms. “I think you do. I guess it’s not surprising. Mark was the most understanding man I’ve ever met. It must run in the family.”  
  
  “I’m nothing like Mark.” His tone was suddenly harsh. “Don’t make the mistake of drawing comparisons that aren’t there. We were as different as night and day.” His lips twisted. “Inside as well as out.”  
  
  What he said was true. Physically there was no resemblance between him and Mark. Jon Sandell was only a few inches taller than her five feet eight and Mark had been well over six feet. Mark also had had golden coloring with deep blue eyes and a smile as kind as summer rain. He was so incredibly handsome that people had stopped on the street to stare at him in bedazzlement. She had been dazzled herself at first and hadn’t been able to believe it when he started to pursue her with gentle persistence.  
  
  There was nothing either gentle or golden about his cousin. Jon Sandell was dark and in tense and composed of hard, sharp angles. She found her gaze drawn to the strong brown column of his throat and allowed it to wander down to catch the faintest glimpse of virile dark hair above the top button of his navy flannel shirt. The dark thatch of hair looked soft, springy, and suddenly, incredibly, she found her palms tingling as if she were actually touching it. T  
he shocking sensation caused her to quickly jerk her gaze away. What had happened to her? For a moment she had felt a burst of sensuality stronger than any she had previously experienced. It was nothing, she told herself. Jon Sandell projected a raw sexuality that would have aroused a response in any woman. It didn’t mean anything. Still, for a moment, along with the sensuality, she had felt a closeness, almost a bonding that was, in many ways, like the empathy she had known with Mark. “Well, I’m sure you’re as kind as Mark or you wouldn’t be making this courtesy call. I’m really grateful, Mr. Sandell.”  
  
  “Jon. I’ve thought of you as Elizabeth for a long time.” He sipped his coffee. “And I’m not kind. I’m here because I want to be.” He paused. “And because I have to be.”  
  
  She lifted an eyebrow. “Have?”  
  
  He nodded. His gaze was fixed on the lead glass windowpane above the sink. “I like your home. How old is it?”  
  
  “It’s been in my family for over a hundred and eighty years. I love it too.” She gazed around the large oak-beamed room with affection. “The cottage was a flour mill at one time. My ancestors built it and lived in two little rooms upstairs. It was renovated and expanded when small mills became a thing of the past.” She lifted her coffee cup to her lips. “Mark loved the house, too, thank heavens. I don’t know what I would have done if he’d wanted to move somewhere else.”  
  
  “Yes, he told me he loved it. He said it was very restful to lie in bed and listen to the creak of the paddle wheel as it dipped into the stream.” His gaze met her own. “I don’t hear it now.”  
  
  “It’s turned off. It was converted to electricity awhile back, and I’m afraid the power to run it is a luxury, now that the stream has turned into a pleasant trickle. You wouldn’t be able to hear it anyway. These stone walls are over a foot thick and the wheel is on the other side of the house.”  
  
  “Outside your bedroom window.” It was a statement, not a question.  
  
  Her eyes widened in surprise. “Mark must have written you in great detail. I wouldn’t have thought he’d bother to describe the cottage so precisely.

He didn’t want to. I insisted. I wanted to know everything.” His gaze flickered to her stomach. “Everything.”  
  
  He couldn’t mean … Elizabeth felt the hot color of a flush stain her cheeks, but she realized quickly how foolish she was being. Mark would never have shared the intimate details of their relationship even with his closest friend. She took another sip of coffee. “That’s understandable, I suppose. We always want to know about the people who are close to those we love. What did he tell you about me?”  
  
  “Not enough.” He was studying her with moody intensity. “Not nearly enough.”  
  
  “Well, there wasn’t much to tell,” she said lightly. “I was a twenty-eight-year-old spinster with a house and a dog and three years to go on my bachelor’s degree in library science, when Mark swept into my life. He came, he saw, he conquered.”  
  
  “So I understand.” Once again there was an inexplicable harshness in his tone. His lids lowered to partially veil his eyes, as he caught the uneasiness of her expression. “You were happy with him?”  
  
  “Oh, yes.” Her eyes glowed softly. “He was the kindest, gentlest human being I’ve ever met. We only had six months together before the accident took his life, but they were the happiest I’ve ever known.”  
  
  “You didn’t have many men to compare him with. After all, you were practically house bound nursing your father all those years.”  
  
  So Mark had told him about her father as well, she realized. “Those were happy years too. I loved my father and wanted to help him. I wasn’t a victim of circumstances, I chose to live my life that way. I’ve never regretted the choice.” A brilliant smile illuminated her face. “And then Mark came into my life, and now the baby. Isn’t it wonderful that when one love is taken away we’re given another to replace it?”  
  
  The hard lines of his face softened as he studied her eager expression. “Wonderful,” he echoed quietly.  
  
  The odd breathless feeling returned, and her hand trembled as she set her cup down in the saucer. “I’m afraid Mark didn’t tell me very much about you. I didn’t even know you existed until shortly before he died, and even then he wasn’t very informative.”  
  
  “What did he tell you?”  
  
  She held up two fingers as she enumerated the facts she knew. “That you worked out of the country. That I would be able to trust you as much as I trusted him.” She held up a third finger, her brown eyes dancing. “And that you weren’t as tough as you seemed. I got the impression you were some kind of mercenary or something.”  
  
  “No.” He was silent for a moment. “It was generous of Mark to speak so favorably of me. I don’t think I would have been as generous under the circumstances.”  
  
  She frowned in puzzlement. “Generous? Why shouldn’t he—”  
  
  “Never mind.” He made an impatient motion with his hand. “It’s not important right now. What’s important is that you trust me as Mark asked you to.” He paused. “I’ve rented a place in the mountains near Saranac Lake. I want you to pack a suitcase and come with me right now. Tonight.”  
  
  “WHAT—” SHE BROKE OFF, HER EYES WIDENING in shock. “You have to be kidding?”  
  
  He shook his head. “I don’t find the situation at all amusing. Unless you come with me, I believe you’ll be even less amused.” He leaned forward, the muscles of his shoulders coiled, vibrating with tension. “Gome with me. Trust me. You won’t be sorry.”  
  
  “Just like that?” she asked blankly. “In case you haven’t noticed, I’m almost nine months pregnant. In another three weeks my baby will be born. I’m not about to go on a jaunt into the mountains. I’m only twenty minutes away from a hospital here on the outskirts of Al bany.”  
  
  “I wouldn’t let anything happen to you or your child.” There was absolute certainty both in his voice and in his expression.  
  
  She believed him. She had the feeling he’d use every ounce of his strength to keep her safe. The impression was so vivid, she had an almost irresistible impulse to yield to it. She hadn’t been able to lean on anyone in a long time. “Look, I realize you want to help me.” She reached out and covered his hand as it lay on the table. His body went perfectly still. Was he one of those people who disliked being touched? Well, if he was, it was just too bad. She was a very tactile person, and she found it difficult to communicate without touching. She kept her hand where it was. “You came here and saw a widow in a very delicate, awkward position, seemingly alone and vulnerable. You remembered how much you cared for Mark, and now you want to do something to make his wife’s way a little easier.” She met his gaze. “Perhaps you even feel guilty because you weren’t here to lend me support at the funeral.”  
  
  “You have it all worked out,” he said, never lifting his gaze from her hand clasping his own.  
  
  “It wasn’t all that difficult. I think Mark was right. You’re not as tough as you look.” Her hand tightened on his. “But you have to understand I’m a good deal tougher than I appear, too, and I’m not vulnerable or alone.  
  
  I have friends, and I have my baby. I’ll be fine.”  
  
  “Friends who are two miles away, and a baby who hasn’t arrived on the scene yet. I wouldn’t say your arguments are convincing. I think you’d just better put yourself in my hands.”  
  
  She automatically glanced down at the hand she was holding. They were strong hands, capable and sure, hands that would never falter. She gave his hand a final squeeze and released it. “But I can’t do that. I have to take care of myself. We all have to live our own lives.” She made a face. “And I can’t see why you’d want to burden yourself with a woman in my condition so soon after your arrival from abroad. You must have all kinds of things you want to do now that you’re back in the States.”  
  
  “You’re wrong. There’s nothing I’d rather do than care for you.”  
  
  “Well, it’s out of the question. So forget it.”  
  
  “I can’t forget it.” As he lifted his lids, she was struck by the impact of brilliant dark eyes. “Because you don’t know what the hell you’re talking about. I don’t feel guilty and it’s not family loyalty that’s dictating my desire to keep you safe. It’s simply a necessity. You’re in danger, dammit.”  
  
  “Danger?” She gazed at him in disbelief. “What danger could I possibly be in?”  
  
  “Lord, now I’ve frightened you,” he growled in profound self-disgust. “I didn’t mean to come out with it so abruptly. I could shock you into labor or something.”  
  
  “I’m hardly that fragile,” she said dryly. “Though you did surprise me.” And frightened her, she thought to herself. There had been no doubt of the seriousness of his statement. “Why should—”  
  
  “It’s a little complicated to explain. Mark belonged to a group the government is investigating. They may think you belong to the same group, or at least have knowledge of them.”  
  
  She felt waves of surprise roll over her. “Mark was involved with a subversive organization? That’s crazy. He would never had sup ported a group like that.”  
  
  “It wasn’t a subversive organization. He didn’t belong to any group that posed a threat to the government.” He paused. “But he did belong to a group under suspicion, and the NIB isn’t known to wait patiently while their suspicions are checked out. The National Intelligence Bureau can be quite ruthlessly effective in their actions.”  
  
  “Are you saying the NIB might have had Mark … killed?”  
  
  “No,” he said quickly. “Mark’s death was entirely natural. The NIB didn’t become active in the investigation until later.”  
  
  “I don’t understand any of this.” She shook her head in an effort to clear it. “Mark wasn’t even interested in politics. He was a professor of English on sabbatical. It doesn’t make sense.”  
  
  “Do you believe me?” he asked quietly.  
  
  Yes, she believed him, she realized. And that was even more incredible than what he had told her. There was no avoiding the naked sincerity in his gaze as he looked at her. “Are you sure?” she whispered.  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  She wa  
s silent for a long time, as she tried to sort reason out of chaos. “Then I believe you. But that doesn’t mean I’ll be in any danger. I’ll just explain I know nothing about Mark’s political activities.”  
  
  He shook his head. “Bardot is a fanatic. He’s been biding his time, but now he’s ready to make his move.”  
  
  “Bardot?”  
  
  “Karl Bardot, NIB.”  
  
  “You appear to be very well informed.” Her expression was wary. “I don’t suppose it’s possible that you belong to the same organization as Mark did?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  She had expected the answer. “Oh dear, I was afraid you were.”  
  
  “Why afraid?” He frowned. “I told you there was no threat involved. Particularly not to you. All you have to do is come with me, and I’ll see that you’re taken care of.”  
  
  “I can’t do that. This is my home. I don’t even know you.” Her fingers ran distractedly through her nut-brown hair. “You walk in here and tell me I should leave everything that’s dear and familiar to me just because—”  
  
  “Mark told you to trust me.”  
  
  “Not with my baby.” Her tone was suddenly fierce.  
  
  A faint smile touched his lips. “Does that mean you’d trust me if the child wasn’t in volved?”  
  
  “I think so.” Her expression was troubled. “Oh. I don’t know. I believe you mean well, but it’s all so bizarre. If I’m innocent, there can’t be any danger to me. This is America, for goodness’ sake.”  
  
  “You won’t come with me?”  
  
  She shook her head. “You have to be mistaken. I’m sure I’ll be fine once I’ve explained I don’t know anything about all this.”  
  
  “I didn’t think you would, but it was worth a chance.” He set his cup down and pushed his chair away from the table. “You’re tired and hungry. I’ll leave now so that you can have your meal and get some rest.”  
  
  “You’re leaving?” She didn’t know why she experienced a sudden panic.  
  
  “I’ve said what I had to say.” He stood up and shrugged into his coat. “I’d like you to promise me something before I go.”  
  
  “Promise?”  
  
  “I want you to promise me you won’t let Bardot lure you out of the cottage on any pre text, that you won’t get in a car or even go for a walk with him.”  
  
  She felt a cold chill ripple through her. She smiled tremulously. “That won’t be difficult. I probably won’t even meet the man.”  
  
  “Do you promise?”  
  
  “I promise,” she whispered.  
  
  “You look like a big-eyed little girl,” he said softly. “Don’t worry. You’re making it very difficult for me, but I won’t let anything happen to you. That’s what I’m here for.”  
  
  She stood up, suddenly feeling a ridiculous sense of profound relief and well-being. “Are you staying in Albany?”  
  
  He shook his head. “I’ll be around.” He fastened the buttons of his jacket. “I can find my own way out. Don’t see me to the door, it’s too cold outside. The weather report said we should expect snow tomorrow night. That might be interesting.”  
  
  Snow, interesting? What a curious turn of phrase. “You’re obviously not from upstate New York or you wouldn’t find the possibility of a November snowstorm very interesting.” Her expression became wistful. “I’ll be sorry to see the first snow. I love the summer. I spend most of my time outdoors from April until September.” She suddenly grimaced. “I guess you can tell. I’m positively covered with freckles.”  
  
  “Yes, I can tell.” He turned away. “Goodbye, Beth, I’ll see you soon.”  
  
  “Beth?” She raised an eyebrow inquiringly. “My name is Elizabeth. No one calls me Beth.”  
  
  “Not even Mark?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  There was a flicker of satisfaction on his face. “Goodbye, Beth.”  
  
  Not waiting for a reply, he turned and left the kitchen. A moment later she heard the front door close.  
  
  She stood there for a while, her mind a wild jumble of tattered impressions and half-formed thoughts. Jon Sandell had been there less than an hour, she realized, but he had managed to throw her into a state of complete confusion. Her heart was pounding, and her skin was tingling as if she’d just been through a Finnish sauna. Fear. Yes, fear and something else which was not so easily defined. Suddenly she was jolted out of her confusion by the most basic action possible: Andrew kicked her with force and precision.  
  
  Her hand went to her abdomen. “All right, I can take a hint. I should think good thoughts and eat dinner. Right, kid?” She turned briskly and walked toward the counter where the Crockpot still bubbled. “Nag, nag, nag.”  
  
  She didn’t have much hope for good thoughts, but she did feel better after she’d had a bowl of stew and another half-cup of coffee. She gazed wistfully out the window as the tap water filled the sink, and she prepared to wash the dishes. It was entirely dark outside, and she could no longer see the narrow ribbon of the stream or the woods that lay beyond the meadow.  
  
  “You’ll have to get a blanket so I can lay him down.”  
  
  She whirled with a startled little cry. Jon Sandell stood in the doorway of the kitchen. In his arms was a mass of lean, tawny fur and … blood.  
  
  “Sam?” She could barely speak. “Oh, no!”  
  
  “He’s not hurt badly. You should take him to the vet tomorrow to have a preventive shot, but after you clean the wound he should be fine. The blanket,” he prompted.  
  
  “What?” she murmured in distraction, her gaze still fixed agonizingly on Sam. “Oh, yes, right away.” She moved at an amazingly fast pace from the room to the bathroom closet and grabbed the first blanket she could find from the shelf. In an instant she was back in the kitchen, doubling the blanket and spreading it on the hearth. “You’re sure he’s not badly hurt?” she asked anxiously. “There’s a vet just—”  
  
  “He’s fine.” Jon knelt and put the dog down carefully on the blanket. His big hands were gentle as he arranged Sam’s legs and settled his weight more evenly. The animal gave a low whimper, and Jon immediately stroked his long sleek nose. “Easy. You’re home now, boy.”  
  
  Elizabeth could feel hot tears stinging her eyes. “What happened to him?”  
  
  Jon pointed to the ugly red gash that ex tended in a straight line from behind Sam’s front paw to the middle of his back. “Bullet. It only grazed him, but he’s not going to feel like chasing rabbits for a while.”  
  
  Elizabeth could feel the blood leave her face. “A hunter?” She moistened her lips with her tongue. “It must have been a hunter who mistook Sam for a deer.”  
  
  “Perhaps.” He gave Sam a final pat and rose to his feet. “Would you like me to stay, or can you manage by yourself?”  
  
  “I can manage. Where did you find him? On the road?”  
  
  “In the woods.”  
  
  She turned in surprise to face him. “What were you doing in the woods?”  
  
  “I was searching for your Heinz 57. I knew as soon as you had time to think about him that you’d be out looking for him yourself. I didn’t want you stumbling around in the dark.” He met her gaze. “Was I wrong?”  
  
  “No,” she whispered. “Thank you, Jon.”  
  
  He smiled with surprising gentleness. “He’s a brave dog. I like your Sam, Beth.” He turned away. “Take good care of him.”  
  
  “I will.”  
  
  The door had scarcely closed behind him when she was kneeling beside the dog, cleaning the wound with soap and water. Jon was right. Though the wound was shallow it had to be very painful for poor Sam. Yet the dog was mutely patient, and he gave only an occasional whimper as the antibiotic cream Elizabeth applied stung the wound.  
  
  “You are a good dog, aren’t you, boy,” she murmured. “He likes you. Do you know that? And that provides him with some pretty heavy credentials for good taste in this household. As for the rest, he’s still a bit of a mystery. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see.”  
  
  The night was clear and frigid, and each breath Jon drew released a wisp of smoky vapor into the air. He opened the door of the pickup,  
stepped up into the cab, and slammed the door. He sat for a moment gazing at the lights gleaming from the windows of the cottage. Elizabeth in the firelight. The memory lingered with an aching sharpness, reaching deep into his mind and triggering responses better left unexamined. He finally tore his gaze away and reached for the mobile phone beneath the dashboard.  
  
  Gunner Nilsen answered on the second ring. “Yes?”  
  
  “I’ve made contact.”  
  
  “And?”  
  
  “She refused to leave the cottage.”  
  
  “Well, you expected as much. You told me yourself it wasn’t likely you could persuade her to trust you that far.”  
  
  “No, but I had to try.” There was weariness threading his voice. “She’s with child, dammit. I wanted to make it as easy as I could for her.”  
  
  “I know, Jon.”  
  
  “How is it up there?”  
  
  “The lodge is comfortable and the location exactly what you wanted.”  
  
  “You covered your tracks?”  
  
  Gunner chuckled. “I not only covered them, I buried them. As far as the leasing agency is concerned, the lodge is being rented by a Wall Street tycoon for his snow-bunny mistress. Did you hear it was going to snow tomorrow? I’m looking forward to it. I bought skis from the sports shop in town.”  
  
  “Wonderful,” Jon said ironically. “All we need is for you to break your leg on one of the slopes.”  
  
  “It can’t be that much different from sand skiing,” Gunner protested. “I’ll be careful.” There was a short pause. “Is she the person you expected?”  
  
  Jon turned the question over in his mind. He had a sudden vivid picture of Elizabeth Ramsey as he’d last seen her. She’d been standing in the kitchen, her body seemingly too fragile to support the burden of the child she was carrying, her straight brown hair shining richly in the firelight, the sleeves of her loose blue shirt rolled up to reveal strong, shapely arms. She had said herself that she wasn’t pretty, and perhaps she wasn’t by classic standards. The slightly upward tilt of her nose and the golden freckles dusting her face weren’t conventionally attractive.  
  
  Freckles touched by the summer sun she loved. She was the kind of woman anyone would want to touch, to leave a sign of affection upon in passing so she would remember … and smile. Lord, he loved her smile. He had expected it, had known how warm and lovely it would be, but he had still found him self staring at her like a gaping boy. He’d found himself glancing away quickly in order to resist the impulse to reach out and trace the source of that smile with his finger.

1n70sa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBigGirlDiary/comments/1n70sa3/8225_just_love/,8/2/25 just love,"Damn it, I just want to be loved. 

Just once, once in all these years I want to be chosen. I want someone to look at me, not even like they DO love me, I’d settle for just like they COULD love me. Never, not once, has anyone looked at me like that.

I want a boyfriend, I want a partner. I want to be loved. And admitting that makes me feel like I’m confessing a sin. It didn’t use to bother me, the utter lack of. But time keeps ticking and it’s working its way into my heart and bones. 

I’m not ugly. I’m not a bad person. I think I’m a really damn cool person. My mind is sound. So why? Why has there never been anyone? It comes so easily to everyone else. They can be prettier and uglier. Smarter and dumber. They can make more money or less. More or less hobbies. Mentally better or worse. They can love themselves less or more. Know themselves less or more. It doesn’t matter what it is. I don’t have that IT that makes everyone else a romantic interest. 

I’m so so tired. I’m tired of being alone. I’m tired of being strong. I’m tired of self love, because no amount of self love can fill a hole shaped for someone else. No amount of waiting for when I least expect it has helped. Surly after 28 years of not expecting it, it isn’t the answer. I’ve put in the work. I have hobbies and friends. I’m not a shut in. I dress well, I speak well, I integrate well. I’ve tried everything that I’m so sick of hearing. 

My mother has told me I’m a lost cause. No one will love me. Save extra for retirement because there will be no one to take care of me in my old age. 

My father says that falling in love with a guy is the worst thing I could possibly do with my life. I’m better off alone. 

My grandma told me a story of her friend who at age 65 got married again, and maybe when I’m 65 I’ll find someone too.

My classmates are getting married. They’re having kids. Some have even divorced and remarried. 

Not a first kiss. Not a first date. Not a first relationship. Not a first time making love, or a clumsy attempt at it. Not a single thing. And it wears through eventually. Because no matter how much you have going for you, if there’s no evidence or anything, doubt does creep in. There’s never been any evidence that I could be lovable. 

I just want someone. I want someone to look at me like they could love me. I want to know what it’s like to be kissed and hold hands and have sex, and maybe even get a good morning text. Once. Just once. 

I once read a poem above an overheard phone call in a coffee shop. A guy picked up his phone and asked his love if she had eaten today, he didn’t want his moon to fade. The author described how she would settle for being called someone’s little earthquake. Please god, I’m your child too. 

So here is me saying, please god, after 28 years, I am your child too",1,1756860263.0,TheBigGirlDiary,0,1.0,False

I’ve been there a long time and I’m very loyal to the company so it’s hard. I’m a dog trainer at my local shelter and I used to love it. At times I still do. 
But it’s gotten so hard. I work with lots of tired, discouraged people. Dogs take forever to get adopted, and some never make it out. I see a decent amount of euthanasias and it’s so emotionally taxing. I show up every day and try my very best but I’m so tired. Not to mention I am newly pregnant (yay!) all the pregnancy related exhaustion and sickness is making it worse. 

I would be leaving anyways once baby is born, but I was recently offered a position at a local coffee shop/bakery. They know I’m pregnant and could only work till baby is born, it’s not a pay cut at all, and I have tons of relevant work experience and I would be working with two of my best friends. It feels like the right move. Less physically and mentally taxing, less daily emotional whiplash, more flexible schedule, and possibly an option to work a few days a week part time post-baby. 

But I’m struggling with my loyalty to my current job and emotional attachment to some of the dogs I work with. It’s a close knit, small group that work with me there and I used to love it so much. I’ve been feeling the burnout since before the pregnancy but the pregnancy has multiplied it. Should I do it? I guess I’m just weighing my options and feeling nervous to jump into the change.
I would likely come back as a volunteer a couple times a week as I can’t imagine fully leaving shelter work. But I really need a break.",5,1756860180.0,AnimalShelterStories,0,1.0,False

  Lust.  
  
  That was what she had felt for Jason Alexander so many years ago. It had been lust, and nothing more.  
  
  She refused to believe that it had been something bigger, more meaningful.  
  
  Biting her bottom lip, she fought the disbelieving laugh that threatened to erupt, directed at her own stupidity. Why, if it had been nothing more than lust, did hearing he was coming to her brother’s Super Bowl party make her heart race and her palms sweat?  
  
  Sitting on her brother’s sofa, Heather Cameron took on the tedious task of peeling the label from her beer bottle. Desperation spurred the need to do something with all the nervous energy pouring through her body. Any minute now, Jason would walk through the front door of her brother’s house.  
  
  She would be face to face with the man who had inspired pretty much every nighttime fantasy she had been privy to as a teen. Back then, she had easily conjured hot, wet, steamy images involving her and Jason naked. Compliments of a wild imagination—and good dream recall—she had done things with him she had yet—not then or now—in the flesh.  
  
  Reality made her sink her teeth into her bottom lip, almost drawing blood.  
  
  Okay, so her little fantasies about Jason had lasted well past her teens. She just didn’t like to admit it, even to herself. Years after he had joined the army, leaving her behind—and angry—she would wake wet with need. The times she had woken up, a near-orgasmic ache between her legs, were too many too count.  
  
  Once she had moved away to college, her fantasies grew more explicit. The more she learned, the more she played out sensual, tempting scenarios in her sleep. And sometimes even in the waking hours.  
  
  And he, Jason Alexander, her brother’s best friend, the man who was about to be in the same room with her, would be the focus of her arousal.  
  
  It had been the move to Manhattan that had seemed to calm her need for him. Her new life had brought with it a refuge of sorts. She had been freed from her 'Jason haunting'. She almost laughed at the thought. That’s how hot she had been for Jason. She had dubbed her obsession a 'haunting'.  
  
  She didn’t want it to consume her again.  
  
  Shoving the thought away, she reminded herself that things were different now. She was twenty-five and a grown woman with life experiences under her belt.  
  
  Now back at home in San Francisco, she was the proud owner of a corporate job with Martin’s department store. Jason would probably be nothing like she remembered. His impact on her would be a big, whopping zero.  
  
  She frowned and tossed a piece of label on the coffee table. It was just so damned ironic that Jason had left the army, and returned home only weeks before her. When her brother had told her he had bought a skydiving school with several army buddies, she had been floored.  
  
  “Boo!”  
  
  Heather jumped so hard, her beer splattered out the top of the bottle. Her brother Matt, now sitting next to her, laughed. “You are too easy to scare, little sis.”  
  
  She made a face and wiped at the dampness on her jeans. ”And you are just as childish as I remember, Matt Cameron.”  
  
  Matt was linebacker big and teddy-bear cute, with blond hair, blue eyes, and a funny sense of humor. He winked at his sister. “But you love me, and you know it”  
  
  That was the truth. She did love him, and had missed him immensely. “Yes, you big lug, I love you.” She shoved him.  
  
  He wrapped a big arm around her shoulder. “It wasn’t the same, having football parties without a girl here.”  
  
  Heather laughed. “Mom would have filled in for me. She loves football.” They both knew why he didn’t want Mom present.  
  
  “Yeah, well, I get all I can take of Mom during the season.” Matt was a high school football coach who often entertained with stories about players and fans. Unfortunately, their mother had created a few of his funnier stories. “It’s no wonder Dad took a dislike to the game. I’ve never seen a woman act like that over football.”  
  
  “I remember Dad taking nerve pills before your college games, afraid she would embarrass you.”  
  
  Matt grunted. “Me?” he said in disbelief. “He was afraid she would embarrass him.”  
  
  The room was already bustling with activity, mostly male in nature. The doorbell rang, and someone yelled for Matt. He kissed Heather’s forehead. “Good to have you home.”  
  
  He was up and gone, leaving her with a contented smile on his handsome face. It was good to be home.  
  
  Her enjoyment of the moment quickly ended when she heard her name. “Heather?”  
  
  She looked up to see the very man she had been fretting over just minutes earlier.  
  
  Jason.  
  
  He stood before her, looking every bit the sinfully handsome male she had remembered. But better. Experience and age had given him a mature quality that clung to him like a second skin, made him seem like he knew things. She could almost bet he knew plenty about pleasing a woman.  
  
  She cringed inwardly. He was already making her have bad thoughts.  
  
  “Jason.” She said his name as if confirming he wasn’t a part of one of her dreams.  
  
  Try as she might, her eyes wouldn’t stay fixed on his face. They traveled the length of what had become a delicious display of pure male power.  
  
  Jason had always looked good, but now…now he was like a work of art.  
  
  His powerful legs rippled with muscles beneath his faded Levis. And then there was the snug, black T-shirt. She had a new appreciation for T-shirts as of now. At least this particular one. It did a mighty fine job of hugging a chest so broad and hard it made her mouth water.  
  
  On his six-foot-two frame, his physical presence could easily be considered intimidating. To Heather, it was like being injected with an instant dose of desire. With lightning speed, she became aware of the prickling in her nipples.  
  
  Her arms crossed in front of her body, reacting to the tiny ache. She prayed he couldn’t tell her nipples were hard through her thin, pink tee.  
  
  Forcing herself to meet his gaze, she found his blue eyes darker, and far more intense than she remembered. Then in that deep, baritone voice of his that she had always loved so much, he said, “It’s been a long time, Heather.”  
  
  Simple words, but they evoked much more than a simple response.  
  
  Her body quaked with the potency of her attraction to him; so long in the making, so alive de  
spite the darkness of time apart. All the while, her heart raced with the emotional intensity seeing him once again evoked.  
  
  She sat her beer on the coffee table, forcing herself to unlock her arms from their defensive posture, and praying her hands didn’t shake. “Yes, yes, it has.”  
  
  He was staring at her with an indiscernible look in his eyes. She resisted the urge to shuffle in her seat, feeling self-conscious under his scrutiny. What did he see?  
  
  Little girl...or woman?  
  
  “You’ve changed,” he finally said in a hushed tone.  
  
  Her knees were pressed primly together, a reflex reaction to the dull ache that had traveled with excruciating accuracy from her breasts straight to her core.  
  
  She barely found her voice. “Have I?”  
  
  A slight smile played on his lips as he stepped forward. Anticipation rushed across her nerve endings. Would he hug her?  
  
  “Yes,” he said as he sat down next to her. Close. He sat really, really close. She could smell him. She’d always found his scent to be arousing. To touch him would take nothing more than a raised hand.  
  
  It was tempting. Her fingers twitched with the need.  
  
  Instead, he reached for her.  
  
  Her breath caught in her throat as his hand gently touched her hair. Basking in the moment, her lashes fluttered shut as his fingers traced a long strand of red. “You changed your hair.”  
  
  Nervously, she forced her eyes open and a smile to her lips.  
  
  He had only seen her hair short. In her youth, she had wanted to fit in with everyone else. The bright auburn color had seemed too bold, so she had kept it short to downplay its existence. Her mother wouldn’t let her color it, so she had cut it.  
  
  Now, as a grown woman, she felt the freedom of being unique and loved it. Her hair was long, below her shoulders, and she liked it that way.  
  
  Her voice was soft as she replied, remembering his old comments about her fire-red temper to match her hair. She wondered if he was thinking the same thing. “It’s been like this a long time.”  
  
  His eyes seemed to go to her lips. It took effort to resist the urge to wet them. ”I can’t believe how grown up you are.”  
  
  She wet her lips. She couldn’t help it. His eyes followed the action, lingering and then lifting to hers. What passed between them in that moment made her breath catch in her throat. It was like something out of one of her fantasies. Hot, primal passion burned in their eyes, blocking out their surroundings.  
  
  It couldn’t be real. Could it?  
  
  “Jason.” His name was a question. Did he want her like she always had him?  
  
  Memories seemed to walk from her mind to his, and his to hers. All the times they had spent together over the years…  
  
  Late night talks when her brother was asleep on the couch...those had been her favorite times. She and Jason would sit on the floor talking for hours. Then there were the nights when she, Jason, and Matt would make popcorn and watch scary movies.  
  
  Sometimes Jason would force her to watch the same old movies over and over. Her brother would bail time after time, saying he couldn’t watch the same movie again.  
  
  But even then Heather had loved Jason. They had been friends, and so much more.  
  
  Watching a movie ten times with him was fun.  
  
  Yes, there had always been something between them. They simply hadn’t allowed it to bloom.  
  
  No. He hadn’t let it.  
  
  Suddenly, she understood why she had never been able to dismiss Jason as a crush. He had been so much more. But he hadn’t let it evolve, holding her at arms' length. She had been forbidden, and he had known it.  
  
  She had been his best friend’s sister. That made her untouchable.  
  
  But that was then, and this was now.  
  
  And there was no question they wanted each other. It was like a low, hot simmer that threatened to go up in flames.  
  
  “Hey, Jason, Heather, come check out the pre-show. That damn quarterback from Utah is in a monkey suit, acting like he knows football when he can’t even complete a pass.”  
  
  Matt as usual had crummy timing, appearing beside them. He had successfully ruined the moment. Jason looked away. Heather scowled Matt’s direction, fighting the urge to throw her beer on him.  
  
  Matt looked at Heather, and then at Jason. “I can’t believe you’re both here. It’s just like old times. Us guys can cut up, drink beer, and listen to my kid sister tell us we don’t know what we’re talking about.” He made a cheering motion with his beer bottle. “Life is good.”  
  
  Jason looked at Matt, then eyed Heather with a cool look, several notches below his prior one. “Yeah,” he said. “I guess it is just like old times.” His gaze switched back to Matt, then with finality to the action. Heather was shut out. “I need a beer.”  
  
  As Jason walked away, Heather tried to calm the explosion of thoughts erupting in her brain. He had just dismissed her like a bad habit.  
  
  No matter what had just passed between them, she was Matt’s kid sister. Always was, and always would be.  
  
  But Jason was wrong. Everything wasn’t just like old times. She was older and wiser. In the past, she had dismissed their attraction as schoolgirl fantasies. Not anymore.  
  
  She saw what was in his eyes. He wanted her. And damn it, she had wanted him a long time.  
  
  All she had to do was prove just how womanly she was, and the kid sister would be forgotten. And why wait? She’d start today.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  The main group of Super Bowl watchers had gathered in Matt’s living room. Among the group there were seven rowdy guys, all with beers in their hands, eyes on the television, and smart-ass comments blurting from their mouths. Heather sat amongst them, shocked that she wasn’t the only female for once. One of Jason’s partners, Bobby, had brought his wife, Jennifer.  
  
  “We need a beer run,” Matt yelled from the kitchen.  
  
  Heather had almost forgotten. “I have a couple cases in my car.”  
  
  “Way to go, Heather,” Joey, another guest said, and then winked. He pushed to his feet. “I’ll carry it in for you.”  
  
  To Heather's surprise, Jason stood. “That’s okay, I got it, man.” He exchanged a look with Joey, who quickly sat back down, bowing out of his offer to help.  
  
  Her eyes narrowed as they met Jason’s, noting his silent intimidation of the other man. But she didn’t say anything. Interesting. She wanted to see where this was going. Turning on her heels, she let Jason follow her outside. With every step she took, she felt him behind her, watching her, moving with her.  
  
  She hit the clicker to her car, and popped the trunk. When they were both standing behind the raised hood, he turned and faced her.  
  
  He fixed her in a stare, but his expression was unreadable. Damn him for having a good poker face. His tone was equally hard to read. “Joey’s a dog. Stay away from him.”  
  
  She laughed. He had to be kidding. “I’m a grown woman, Jason. I hardly need you to tell me who I should stay away from. Besides,” she added, purposely dismissing his warning, “he seems nice enough to me.”  
  
  His hand came out and touched her shoulder. She looked down at it, and then up at him. “He’s not just a dog, he’s a junkyard dog.”  
  
  She let out a breath. “How do you suppose I survived all those years while you were gone without your warnings?” She screwed up her face. “I can decide who I date—or don’t date, for that matter—very well on my own, thank you.”  
  
  She started to turn, but his hand gently closed around her arm. “You’re considering dating him?”  
  
  She wasn’t. “Maybe.”  
  
  His eyes darkened. “That’s crazy. Matt will have a fit.”  
  
  Her eyes narrowed. “Matt, huh? So you are doing this for Matt?”  
  
  “Not for Matt.” He spoke the words softly with a hint of discomfort ringing in his tone. “You’re like a sister to me as well, and you know it.”  
  
  That made her angry. No way was she letting him get away with this. “Funny,” Heather challenged. “That look you gave me in the living room didn’t look too brotherly.�  
�  
  
  She stepped forward, bringing them so close their thighs were almost touching. Her hand flattened on his chest. She was so nervous her insides were shaking, but Jason had avoided what was between them far too long.  
  
  Her voice was a soft, seductive purr, and she inwardly complimented herself on her exterior façade of composure. “You looked at me like a man looks at a woman, Jason.”  
  
  His eyes were half-veiled as he looked down at her hand on his chest. For long moments he stared before once again making eye contact. She could smell his spicy cologne, like a temptation to bury her nose in his neck.  
  
  He didn’t move nor did he deny her words. “Your brother is my best friend.”  
  
  She ignored his words. “Does that mean you know how you looked at a me?” The muscles in his chest flexed under her fingers.  
  
  His voice was low. “Seeing you again took me off guard.”  
  
  She took his words as a small admission. “You took me off guard, too.”  
  
  “Meaning?”  
  
  She had to go for it. “Meaning I had hoped my schoolgirl crush was gone.”  
  
  His eyes flashed with surprise. “What crush?”  
  
  “We both know there has always been something between us.”  
  
  “We were kids.”  
  
  “We’re not anymore.”  
  
  His hand went to her hair as it had earlier. “I love your hair like this.”  
  
  The touch of his hand made her insides flip-flop. “I want you to like it.”  
  
  His eyes went to hers. “Your brother...“  
  
  She finished his sentence for him. “Knows I’m a grown woman.”  
  
  “Would kill me.”  
  
  “No,” she insisted, and if he did she’d kill him. ”He won’t.”  
  
  “He will.”  
  
  “Kiss me.”  
  
  He stared down at her, and then to her complete, utter shock, he did as she asked. Not only was he kissing her, his arms had slid around her waist. He pulled her tight against that hard body of his, and she got a taste of heaven on earth.  
Instantly, she melted into him, molding her softness against those delicious muscles. Her hands slid around his neck. The action pressed her aching nipples against his chest, and she moaned softly into his mouth.  
  
  Divine, soft caresses of his tongue played sensual havoc with her entire body. It was just a kiss, but it was also so much more. Years of pent-up desire had been set free in both of them.  
  
  Wetness dampened her panties as if there had been twenty minutes of foreplay instead of simply this one kiss.  
  
  God, how she wanted him. Her leg went up and wrapped around his calf, pulling his hips against hers. Feeling the evidence of his arousal press against her stomach was fuel to the fire. She wanted to be alone with him, naked and intimately joined.  
  
  He nipped at her lips. “We shouldn’t be doing this.”  
  
  “Why not?” she asked breathlessly.  
  
  He raised his head just enough to look into her eyes. “You know why.”  
  
  “I want you, Jason. Is that wrong?”  
  
  He made a low sound, much like a growl, and then kissed her again. This time, his kiss was different. He seemed more primal in his need, kissing her deeper, his tongue sliding along hers with long, sensual strokes. The potency of desire was consuming him, and taking her with him.  
  
  A door slammed somewhere in the distance, but it hardly registered. Her mind and body were both completely focused on Jason.  
  
  “Where’s that beer?”  
  
  The voice—Matt’s—was a jolt of reality.  
  
  They froze, lips pressed together, eyes flying open. Then, at the same moment, they moved away from each other like two bad children caught with their hands in the cookie jar.  
  
  Jason ran his hand through his hair, and muttered a curse. The crunch of Matt’s shoes on gravel indicated he was about to round the trunk. Jason reached for the beer, and Heather forced a smile.  
  
  This wasn’t how she would have wanted their first kiss to end. Still, she had finally kissed Jason. And it had been a damned good kiss. Very fantasy worthy. She hoped he thought so, too.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Halftime brought with it a scurry of activity. Heather found herself sitting in the kitchen with Jennifer, Bobby’s wife. Bags of chips and empty beer cans scattered the counters. Heather took a bite of a Cheez Doodle, closed the bag, and sat it aside.  
  
  She eyed Jennifer, who was finishing off a Dorito herself, and smiled. She was a pretty woman, blond and curvy. The type that would have made Heather insecure in her younger years. But not now. Now she was proud of who and what she had become.  
  
  And she knew what she wanted out of life, and had done a good job of making her goals realities. Jason was the one exception.  
  
  She had always wanted him. And he had always been beyond reach.  
  
  Vulgar yelling came from the living room. Heather rolled her eyes. “Men.”  
  
  Jennifer laughed, and closed up her bag of chips. “We’re outnumbered.”  
  
  Her eyes widened in a jest. “Ya think?”  
  
  “Mmm,” Jennifer said, sipping her beer. “It’s all good, though. I like being with Bobby.”  
  
  One side of her mouth lifted. “Newlyweds tend to be that way.”  
  
  “It’s not that,” Jennifer told her. “We grew up together, but…”  
  
  Now Heather was curious. “But what?” she asked, and then realized she was being rude. “Oh, sorry. I didn’t mean to be nosy.”  
  
  Jennifer gave her a friendly smile, clearly not upset. “It’s fine. It’s just a long, complicated story. The bottom line is we spent some years apart, and well, I guess you could say, rediscovered each other. I want to enjoy every moment I can with him.”  
  
  Heather studied her a minute, shoving a lock of hair behind her ear. “So do you like football, or just being here with Bobby?”  
  
  “Both,” she said with a smile. “I used to watch Bobby’s football games in high school and it kind of grew on me.”  
  
  “Really?” she asked, walking to the fridge and pulling out a Coke. She held one up to Jennifer, who nodded her acceptance. “I used to watch Jason and Matt play, too. That’s how I took to liking it. I don’t remember Bobby from back then, but I’m quite a few years younger than the guys are.”  
  
  Jennifer nodded, reaching for the can of Coke and popping the top open. “Bobby and Jason are the same age. In fact, Jason followed Bobby into the Rangers, from what I understand.”  
  
  Heather thought back as she took a long drink. Setting her can on the counter, she said, “I don’t remember why he joined the Rangers. Just that it made me miserable.”  
  
  “So,” Jennifer said, curiosity in her tone. “What’s the deal with you and Jason?” She smiled. “I don’t mind being nosy.”  
  
  “Nothing,” she said, trying to seem nonchalant.  
  
  Jennifer’s brows raised in disbelief.  
  
  “Okay, something.” Heather made a face. “He has a problem with me being Matt’s kid sister. Says I am like a sister to him.”  
  
  “Ah, hah,” Jennifer said, and then added nothing else.  
  
  Heather gave her a look. “What does 'ah hah' mean?”  
  
  Jennifer’s brow lifted. “There is only one way to handle the 'sister syndrome'.”  
  
  Heather leaned forward eagerly. “I’m listening.”  
  
  “You’ll have to make him think of you as a woman, not a kid. Of course, he is also probably worried about how Matt will respond.”  
  
  Heather frowned. “I know that much.” Tell me something I don’t know, she added silently. “How, is the question.”  
  
  “Jealousy.”  
  
  “Huh?”  
  
  “Make him jealous. If he really wants you—and he does, I saw how he looks at you—he’ll take the bait.”  
  
  Heather perked up. “How does he look at me?”  
  
  “Like he wants to have hot, wet sex with you.”  
  
  Heather sighed wistfully. “Yeah?”  
  
  Jennifer laughed. “Yeah.”  
  
  But this was serious business to Heather. “I need to make this happen.”  
  
  Jennifer eyed her with interest. “The sex or the jealousy?”  
  
  “Both.” And so much more.  
  
  “Okay,” Jennifer said softly, wiggled her finger at Heather so she would come closer. “There’s this charity auction…”  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Heather stepped into her bathtub, and let out a big sigh of pleasure. All her life, her place of escape had been a bubble bath.  
  
  Tonight, she needed escape more than ever.  
  
  At first, Jennifer’s idea of making Jason jealous had seemed the way to go. But now, alone, thinking things through, it didn’t sit well.  
  
  Jason was special to her.  
  
  Playing games wasn’t her style, and certainly she had never been anything but honest with Jason. She liked what they shared. She didn’t want to change the tone of their relationship just to change the nature.  
  
  Still, the direct approach hadn’t worked. After sharing a hot, tingle-to-your-toes kiss, he hadn’t so much as said a word to her. In fact, he had avoided her like the plague. Sinking against the tub wall and deeper into the water, she mentally replayed the party. She was certain Jason had been watching her.  
  
  He hadn’t so easily ignored her.  
  
  That gave her hope.  
  
  Her eyes fluttered shut as she relived the feel of his lips pressed to hers, soft, sensual, and warm. In her mind, his mouth traveled down her neck, and she could almost feel his breath on her skin.  
  
  She moaned softly as she imagined how it would feel to run her fingers through his hair. To have him touch her would be pure bliss. One of her hands moved up her stomach, but in her mind it was his hand. She cupped her breast, thinking of the rough, perfect texture of his hand.  
  
  Pinching her nipple, she whimpered, calling out his name in her mind, and bringing her other hand upward. Both breasts in her hands, she kneaded them, nipples aching with cries for her touch.  
  
  No, his touch.  
  
  Jason’s.  
  
  A dull ache built between her thighs, begging to have him, wanting him inside her. Her fingers touched the sensitive flesh, and her thighs  
spread, knees bending above the water.  
  
  She needed a release, and her fingers gently answered her body's cry. Images of their bodies, naked, legs entwined, drove her need. She whimpered with the thought of Jason sinking deep inside her body. And then that purposely slow first move that would open her wider, and make her arch into his body.  
  
  He would call out her name, and she would gasp from his first hard thrust.  
  
  Her fingers moved more fervently along her sensitive flesh, urgency growing as images of her and Jason made her hotter for reality.  
  
  The tingling of arousal grew to the burn of pure need. Her mind raced with images of Jason naked, inside her, touching her. Her hands moved, trying to feel what he would do to her, trying to satisfy her desire for him.  
  
  She bit her bottom lip as the build to release came upon her. Her body ached for release and with each touch of her hand she yearned for Jason.  
  
  Tumbling over the wall of build-up, her muscles contracted in orgasm. For long moments, she tensed as pleasure rushed from her core to her limbs.  
  
  When she finally collapsed, she whispered his name, wishing for what had never been, and hoping it would be, and what she hoped would be.  
  
  Chapter Three  
  
  Jason pulled his SUV into his driveway and turned off the lights. But he didn’t get out. His mind was far too focused on Heather to do anything but sit there. Lost in thought, he didn’t notice the interior lights dim. He was too busy trying to make sense of what was happening to him.  
  
  And something was happening.  
  
  Compliments of Heather.  
  
  She was still in his blood, like some kind of jungle disease. Neither time nor effort lessened the impact she had on him. She had invaded his mind, body, and soul. He had thought it would be different now, years later.  
  
  But he had thought wrong.  
  
  The younger Heather had been impossible to ignore, with her vibrant personality and skin of ivory perfection that begged for his touch. Moving away had been the only thing that had kept him from acting on his attraction.  
  
  Time and age should have improved his willpower.  
  
  The reality was, maturity hadn’t done anything to improve his resistance to Heather. Nothing. Not a damned thing. If fact, he found the new, grown-up Heather devastatingly beautiful and downright tempting.  
  
  Her power to entice him had increased, not the opposite.  
  
  Kissing her had been like tasting the ultimate woman. Never had he been aroused so easily. The minute that sweet little tongue of hers had touched his, he had been hard as a rock.  
  
  His eyes shut. He’d spent years wondering how she would taste. He could still taste her now. The real life experience had been addictively sweet, like the purest of honey.  
  
  Her red hair, now long, was like a shimmering halo of silky temptation to his fingers. Her body had developed curves meant to make a man’s heart race.  
  
  Damn, his was racing all right.  
  
  Having those curves pressed against his body had made him want to rip her clothes off right there and then, in her brother’s driveway. Damn, how he had wanted to feel the soft silkiness of that gorgeous skin.  
  
  If Matt hadn’t walked up when he did…  
  
  Jason didn’t even let himself finish the thought. All he knew was by the time the game was over, he had been so on edge he was ready to rip his hair out piece by piece. Absentmindedly he ran his hand over said short hair, as if he wanted to assure he hadn’t indeed done such a thing.  
  
  After he had kissed her, he had felt guilty as hell. Matt trusted him like a brother. Jason knew even as he was kissing Heather how wrong it was. At the time, he had silently reasoned with himself. Just one kiss wouldn’t hurt. In fact, it might end his years of pining.  
  
  Instead it had fueled his desire for her.  
  
  He had become completely lost in her. He pounded the steering wheel with the palm of his hand. If Matt would have caught them…he’d have lost his best friend. Matt would think he was about as good as dog shit.  
  
  And damn it, that about fit how he felt. Like dog shit.  
  
  Heather was like a sister to him. What right did he have to kiss her? Cursing softly, he knew damned well he had to talk to her. They were going to be bumping into each other in social settings. It was inevitable. That meant they needed to set some ground rules.  
  
  He knew she was staying in the house that used to be Old Lady Walker’s. Jason had heard Matt teasing about it being haunted. Turning the key to the ignition, he made his decision.  
  
  He had to talk with her tonight.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Heather’s eyes popped open at the weird scratching sound.  
  
  The bath water was still warm, her mind relaxed, but her heart was racing. There it was again. Could it be a tree on the bedroom window?  
  
  Of course it was. “Damn it,” she muttered, and stood up, water dripping down her body. “Matt and his damn ghost stories.”  
  
  She grabbed a towel, stepping out of the tub and drying off. As she pushed an arm through her white silk robe, she heard the noise again.  
  
  For an instant, she froze, listening, heart thrumming in her chest. Several seconds passed, and she heard nothing. She tried to laugh at herself as she pulled the robe on fully and tied it around her waist.  
  
  With trepidation, she stepped gingerly towards the bedroom. The lights were out. Hadn’t they been on? Her hands slid to the wall, eager to get to the switch, but she couldn’t find it.  
  
  “Damn, damn, damn,” she muttered, feeling around more urgently for the switch.  
  
  That was when her eyes caught on a flash at the window. No more like a shadow. “Oh, God,” she whispered.  
  
  What now? Think, think, think. The phone. Yes. The phone. Braving the darkness despite the way it gave her the creeps, she inched towards the phone. Just as she was reaching for the receiver, she heard the doorbell.  
  
  Her brows dipped. No ghost or bad guy rang the doorbell. Okay, so bad guys might. She looked for a weapon as she grabbed for the phone again.  
  
  She made a disgusted sound. It wasn’t in the cradle. Carrying off the cordless was a bad habit. She heard the doorbell again. Her teeth worried her bottom lip. It could be Matt. If it was, she wanted him inside the house, protecting her. That’s what big brothers were for. Scaring you, and then making you feel better.  
  
  But what if it wasn’t Matt?  
  
  Her cell was in her purse by the door.  
  
  Padding her bare feet across the carpet, she looked for a weapon. She found it conveniently sitting next to her purse on the hall table.  
  
  Her visitor knocked as she fumbled for her cell phone. “Who’s there?” she yelled, umbrella in her hand.  
  
  “It’s me, Heather.”  
  
  She stopped looking for her phone. “Jason?”  
  
  “Yeah,” he said, with irritation evident even through the thick wood of the door. “How long are you going to leave me standing out here?”  
  
  It really was him. Relief washed over her. Safe. She was safe. She dropped her purse on the table, and flung the door open. Stepping towards him, she didn’t stop until she was flat against his chest.  
  
  Her breath was uneven, her words a bit shaky. “Oh, thank God you’re here!”  
  
  “What’s wrong?” he asked, looking behind her, tensions suddenly evident in his big body.  
  
  Her palms flattened on his chest, as she tilted her chin upward to look at him. “Someone was outside my window.”  
  
  His expression didn’t change. Calmly, he asked, “Did you call the police?”  
  
  “No, my phone,” she knew she was rambling, but she couldn’t restrain her mouth, “it wasn’t charged, and I couldn’t find my cell, and then you showed up.”  
  
  He looked down at his feet. She had dropped the umbrella to grab him. “And the umbrella was supposed to do what?”  
  
  “To poke the bad guy, of course,” she said frowning up at him. “That thing is sharp at the end.”  
  
  He laughed.  
  
  “Or I could have hit them with it.”  
  
  He smiled. “I see.”  
  
  Realizing it did sound silly, sh  
e laughed as well. It caused enough movement that the front of her robe fell open. The sash loosened and the silk folds slipped downward. Now open to the waist, her chest was exposed. She felt the cool air hit her nipples, followed immediately by the heat of his eyes.  
  
  She stood there, feeling like a fool, unmoving, making no effort to cover herself. The shock of the exposure along with the potential prowler or a ghost had her brain in overload. This was not the way she wanted Jason to see her naked the first time.  
  
  He seemed to realize her need for assistance. He reached down and pulled the fabric over her breasts. Gentleman that he was, he didn’t say a word.  
  
  Softly, as if trying to be discreet, he cleared his throat before speaking. It seemed as if he couldn’t quite find his voice. “I’ll go check around the house. You go inside and lock the door until I tell you otherwise.”  
  
  “But what if someone’s inside? I heard something.”  
  
  “What did you hear?” he asked, his voice monotone, giving no hint as to how he might feel about just seeing her bare breasts.  
  
  “A scratching sound.” He arched his brow as if questioning her. “I did! Several times.”  
  
  He stared at her, his eyes intense, dark, and unreadable. “Have you been talking to Matt?”  
  
  She glared at him. Yes! “Matt has nothing to do with this. Give me some credit for knowing when I hear a noise or not.”  
  
  He studying her a moment, and then said, “I’ll check inside first. Where did you hear the noise?”  
  
  “In the bedroom.”  
  
  Chapter Four  
  
  Heather started following Jason into the house. He turned and looked at her. “Stay here.”  
  
  “Are you kidding?” she asked in complete disbelief. “I saw someone outside my window. I’m not staying out here alone.”  
  
  There was a hint of irritation in his voice, and far too much authority. “Heather—“  
  
  She pointed at him. “Don’t take that tone. I’m going with you. No way am I staying out here.”  
  
  Definite frustration showed in his face. He leaned down towards her ear. Then he half mumbled, “You are the most difficult woman I have ever known.” More directly he added, “Stay just inside the door.

  Teignmouth, New Hampshire  
  
  Hannah Grey couldn’t remember when she’d enjoyed a funeral more.  
  
  She sat in the back pew of the Methodist church; the service had been lovely, the elderly man in the coffin was content to be there, and best of all, Mr. Donald Dresser’s neglectful family had been discomfited by the praise lavished on him. His offspring, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren had looked uncomfortable, bored, or pious, depending on their ages and personalities, and Hannah hoped they hated every squirming minute of listening to the minister praise Mr. Dresser for his bravery in combat, his innate business sense, and his devotion to his community—qualities that none of them had inherited.  
  
  Now, while the Dresser family shuffled past the coffin, then into the vestibule to accept condolences, Hannah stood, shrugged into her long black coat, and walked up the aisle. She looked down at Mr. Dresser, dressed in his World War II uniform, his arthritis-twisted fingers crossed over his chest. He looked good. Stern. He had been a cantankerous old son of a bitch, but he had had his reasons. As he had told Hannah on a daily basis, I’m sick and tired of being alive when all my friends are dead, my kids are worthless, and the only use I have for a pretty young nurse like you is to help me piss.  
  
  She was fiercely glad he was at peace, but she wiped a tear away as she whispered, “Godspeed, old man. Godspeed.”  
  
  She turned away, fumbling with her gloves, and walked to the vestibule. The mourners were gone, but Jeff Dresser stood alone, waiting for her.  
  
  He was fifty, handsome, well-dressed, and attractive—at least, he thought he was attractive. Big difference.  
  
  “On behalf of the family, we’d like to thank you for your care of our father. You’re the first home-care nurse who could stick it out for more than two weeks, and we’ve sent your final wages to the agency.” He handed her a plain white envelope. “But here’s a bonus for you, with our gratitude.”  
  
  She looked at the envelope. Looked at him. Noted that even at his father’s funeral, when she was covered from head to foot in all-concealing black winter clothes, the fading playboy couldn’t resist looking her over. “Thank you, Jeff. I’m sorry that your father had to die in such pain, but I loved hearing the stories of his life. He was very interesting.”  
  
  She had Jeff’s attention now. “He talked to you? He told you the stories of his life? By God, that’s more than he would ever do with us!”  
  
  “All I had to do was ask.”  
  
  He stiffened, hearing the rebuke.  
  
  She tucked the envelope into her coat pocket and turned away. “Goodbye.”  
  
  He muttered something quietly resentful, and strode past her and out the door.  
  
  So this was it. The end of another job. Time to go back to the placement agency.  
  
  Another man, about Jeff’s age, but imposing, stood holding the church door open, and the cold February air filled the foyer. “Miss Grey? Do you remember me?”  
  
  She shook his outstretched hand. “Of course.” Stephen Burkhart had been Mr. Dresser ’s attorney. The two men had spent hours cloistered in the study, and during his visits, he had been pleasant, respectful of the limitations she placed on her patient, and watchful. Very watchful.  
  
  “Miss Grey,” he said, “there’ll be a reading of the will at my office at four. Mr. Dresser asked that you attend.”  
  
  “Because . . . because Mr. Dresser left me an inheritance?” She smiled and sighed, recalling the previous occasion she’d received a bequest from a patient, and how much Mr. Coleman’s family had resented even that small amount. When she thought about how much the Dressers anticipated getting their hands on the old man’s sizable fortune, she almost wished Mr. Dresser hadn’t bothered. “He was worried about what he called my lack of resources,” she explained. “I told him once I paid off my student loans, I’d be in the clear, and I meant it. I wasn’t hinting.”  
  
  “You knew Mr. Dresser better than that. He was not the type to respond to hints.” Mr. Burkhart placed his hand on her shoulder. “Be at my office at four.”  
  
  Hannah paused in the door of the conference room of Burkhart, Burkhart and Gargano, attorneys at law, and found herself facing a long polished wood table, a nervous Kayla Thomas of Teignmouth’s Opportunity Council, sixteen surly members of the Dresser family, and a stern-faced Stephen Burkhart.  
  
  “Steve, did the old man give a bequest to the nurse, too? My God, did he leave money to every single person he ever met?” Donald Jr. swung toward Kayla Thomas. “He already gave a bundle to the Opportunity Council this year, and now she’s here with her hand out.”  
  
  Kayla flushed. “I am here because Mr. Burkhart asked me to be here.”  
  
  Mr. Burkhart met Donald Jr.’s resentful gaze. “It’s a clean will which makes Mr. Dresser ’s intentions clear.”  
  
  Hannah slid into the nearest chair. The legal assistant followed her in, shut the door behind her, seated herself, and prepared to take dictation.  
  
  Mr. Burkhart announced, “Mr. Dresser originally had my father prepare his last will and testament, and five months ago asked me to help him amend it.”  
  
  The Dresser family muttered and shifted.  
  
  Mr. Burkhart ignored them. “On his behalf, I scheduled a screening of his mental health at the Hartford Mental Clinic. Once the soundness of his mind was established, we discussed his wishes, then wrote his will, as follows.” Unfolding the stiff papers, he read, “ ‘I, Donald Dresser, of Teignmouth, New Hampshire, do hereby make, publish, and declare this to be my last will and testament, hereby expressly revoking all wills and codicils heretofore made by me. . . .’ ”  
  
  As Mr. Burkhart worked his way through the formalities, Hannah observed the Dresser family. Donald Jr. and his wife looked impatient. Jeff leaned forward, his gimlet gaze fixed on the attorney. Mr. Dresser’s only daughter, Cynthia, chewed her thumbnail.  
  
  Kayla Thomas braced herself against the table.  
  
  They were all anticipating . . . something, and Hannah felt the same suspense that gripped them tighten her nerves.  
  
  “ ‘To Miss Hannah Grey, I leave fifty thousand dollars in recognition of her kind and faithful service, with best wishes for her future.’ ”  
  
  Hannah’s breath stopped in her chest.  
  
  Fifty thousand dollars?  
  
  She had never had a father. Her mother had supported them on a legal assistant’s salary, but there had been medical bills. Now for the first time in Hannah’s life, she had a financial cushion, and the relief left her gasping—and facing sixteen pairs of accusing Dresser eyes.  
  
  Mr. Burkhart continued. “ ‘To my family, I leave a chance to redeem themselves. To each of my descendants currently living, I leave fifty thousand dollars—’ ”  
  
  An audible gasp rose from the Dressers.  
  
  Mr. Burkhart soldiered on. “And the chance to work at Dresser Insurance under the supervision of the board of directors now in place.’ ”  
  
  Cynthia came to her feet. “I don’t believe this!” Donald Jr. rapped sharply on the table with his knuckles. “Who has control of Dad’s fortune?”  
  
  Mr. Burkhart read, “ ‘To the Opportunity Council of Teignmouth, New Hampshire, I leave the bulk of my for  
tune, to be supervised and dispensed by Kayla Thomas, a young woman whose acumen I’ve grown to respect—’ ”  
  
  Now all the members of the Dresser family were on their feet, shouting at Mr. Burkhart, at the white-faced Kayla Thomas, and at one another, while Hannah watched first in horror, then in amazement, then in amusement. She knew this wasn’t the place or the time, not so soon after Mr. Dresser ’s funeral, yet as she observed Cynthia stomp her foot, Donald Jr. pound on the table, and Jeff gesture like a windmill, the amusement grew.  
  
  The fifty thousand dollars that seemed like such a fortune to her was an insult to these people, income for a month, spending money at the gambling tables, a tight budget for a shopping trip.  
  
  Damn the old man. He had set this up. He had known this would happen. No wonder the visits from the lawyer had left him with rosy cheeks and glittering eyes. He had anticipated a furor of epic proportions, and she knew that somewhere in the great beyond, he was rubbing his hands and laughing.  
  
  And she . . . she couldn’t help it. She laughed, too.  
  
  As if that was a signal, silence fell, and the Dresser family focused on her.  
  
  “What did you do to earn that fifty thousand, Miss Grey?” Jeff asked. “What kind of services did you render to the old man that made him fifty thousand dollars’ worth of grateful?”  
  
  Hannah’s merriment died an ugly death. “I do not indulge in sex with my patients, if that’s what you’re insinuating. Certainly not with your father, frail as he was.”Jeff snorted. “No man is that frail. Not Dad, for sure.”  
  
  “Jeff, that’s enough,” Mr. Burkhart said. “During my visits, Miss Grey showed herself to be a nurse of upright character. She did not sleep with your father.”  
  
  “Are you kidding?” Jeff gestured wildly at Hannah. “Look at her, sitting there with her innocent expression and a body that won’t end, and fifty thousand dollars of our money. You can’t tell me she didn’t do the old man to death.”  
  
  A cold anger sprang from deep inside of Hannah.  
  
  “Jeff.” Donald Jr. had himself under control again. “Shut up. We’ll fight the will. The old man was obviously insane.”  
  
  At the insult to Mr. Dresser, Hannah’s anger grew, crawling along her nerves, encasing them in ice.  
  
  “You heard Burkhart. You heard about the screening of Dad’s mental health. Do you really think Burkhart didn’t close all the loopholes?” Jeff gestured at Mr. Burkhart with the same vigor he’d used on Hannah. “This little slut managed to screw the old guy stupid, and now she’s laughing at us.” He turned on Hannah again. “Didn’t you? Didn’t you screw him stupid?”  
  
  Under his insulting, denigrating assault, Hannah’s discipline shattered. “Mr. Dresser was never stupid.” She swept the family with a scornful gaze, then returned her attention to Jeff. “I took care of his . . . needs. I met his . . . requirements. I was his . . . friend . . . when he needed one. Make of that what you will.” She knew exactly what they would make of that.  
  
  Mr. Burkhart used his fingers to cut his own throat, to tell her to shut up.  
  
  She would not. What difference did it make if she lost the inheritance before she had it? She was in a glorious rage, slapping the smarmy Jeff down with every word, letting Donald Jr. and Cynthia know the father they’d neglected had been alive and in need of attention.  
  
  She stood up and smiled coldly. “When you think about it, fifty thousand for my services is cheap. I kept Mr. Dresser busy so the rest of you could enjoy your last days of reckless indulgence. I hope you take benefit from your employment at Dresser Insurance. Working for your living should be an interesting experience for you all.” With a grand sense of satisfaction, she opened the door and swept from the conference room.  
  
  “Come back here,” Jeff yelled. “Don’t you dare turn your back on me!”  
  
  She walked steadily down the corridor.  
  
  Behind her, Jeff continued to shout.  
  
  The rest of the family picked up the volume.  
  
  Hannah walked on, her gaze fixed on the elevator at the end of the hall.  
  
  Putting her hand in her pocket, she found the envelope Jeff Dresser had given her earlier. The bonus the Dresser family had given her in gratitude for her care of their deceased patriarch.  
  
  She got into the elevator and punched the button for the first floor.  
  
  Jeff stalked toward her, fists clenched.  
  
  Before he could reach her, the doors closed in his face.  
  
  She could almost hear Mr. Dresser ’s voice. The little asshole.  
  
  She pulled the envelope out of her pocket. She broke the seal, looked at the check . . . and laughed on the edge of hysteria.  
  
  “Really. You shouldn’t have,” she said aloud.  
  
  The Dresser family’s gratitude came to twenty-five dollars.  
  
  TWO  
  
  Five months later  
  
  In the elegant entry of the Teignmouth Country Club, Carrick Manly stopped in front of the mirror. He looked himself over and smoothed his dark hair, ruffled by the spring breeze. He was six one, broad shouldered, and dressed in an understated black suit with a crisp white shirt and dull gold tie. When a man had a background like his, when he sported distinctive green eyes, he had to seem understated. He had to look conservative. He had to be careful.  
  
  Satisfied with his appearance, he stepped into the doorway of the elegant smoking room.  
  
  Collinson met him before he had crossed the threshold. “Good day, Mr. Manly, you’ll want your copy of the Wall Street Journal.” Hushed, reserved, and ageless, Collinson was the perfect majordomo for the exclusive men’s club.  
  
  “Of course.” Carrick took the proffered paper, tucked it under his arm, and assessed the posture and mood of each and every man inside. It was a skill he’d developed and honed during the slim years.  
  
  The club looked as it had for a hundred fifty years: dark paneling, high windows, overstuffed leather chairs, newspapers scattered on the end tables. The low buzz of male conversation and the clink of glasses filled the air.  
  
  Mathew Davis was smirking at the glowing tip of his cigar. Carrick had heard rumors of a successful insider stock deal; obviously they were true.  
  
  Headphones on, Judge Warner Edgerly watched a DVD on his handheld, a heated flush climbing up his shiny forehead. He must be reviewing porn again.  
  
  Jeff Dresser sat at the bar hunched over a gin and tonic. Dresser looked hangdog and irritated, and anything that made the pompous jackass unhappy must be good news.  
  
  Carrick slid into a seat next to Harold Grindle, the nosiest old gossip in New England. “What’s the problem with Jeff Dresser?” he murmured.  
  
  “What?” Harold shouted.  
  
  Carrick leaned forward and turned up the volume on Harold’s hearing aid. Still quietly, he asked, “I said, what’s the problem with Jeff Dresser?”  
  
  “Oh.” Harold lowered his voice, too. “Haven’t you heard?” With a sly grin that relished each of Jeff’s tribulations, he reported the tale of Donald Dresser Sr.’s death and the details of his will.  
  
  When he had finished, Carrick whistled softly. “So the Dressers are working at the insurance firm?”  
  
  “The members of the board of directors are tearing out their hair. The stock is descending with each passing day. As a preventive measure, they’ve fired a few of the most worthless progeny”—Harold’s rheumy old eyes glistened—“including Cynthia.”  
  
  “No!”  
  
  “She’s threatening to sue, but Burkhart assures me her claim will never stand up in court. I asked him about the scandal concerning old Donald’s private nurse. He clammed up about that, but I heard she slept with the old man to the tune of five hundred thousand dollars.”  
  
  Carrick’s eyebrows shot up disbelievingly. “The old man must have gone senile, then, because when I knew him, he hadn’t an ounce of weakness in him.”  
  
  Harold drew back, offended. “I only report what I’ve heard.” He turned off his hearing aid, and loudly, he huffed, “Upstart!”  
  
  Ah, yes. The first insult of the day.  
  
  Sauntering over to the bar, Carrick took a seat two stools down from Dresser. “Gin and tonic,” he told the bartender.  
  
  He hated gin and tonics, but he wasn’t going to drink it, anyway. He was merely ordering up a little camaraderie.  
  
  He placed the Wall Street Journal on the polished cherrywood bar and scanned the headlines, then turned with a well-feigned start. “I didn’t see you there, Mr. Dresser. How’s Ryan?”  
  
  Ryan Dresser was the asshole who had made Carrick’s life hell after Nathan Manly crashed his multibillion-dollar business, walked with the money to South America or Thailand or wherever the hell he’d gone, and left Carrick and his mother destitute and humiliated.  
  
  “Ryan? Oh, he’s fine. Twenty-six years old and absolutely good for nothing. Every one of my children is good for nothing.” Jeff Dresser was slurring his words, drunk at two o’clock in the afternoon.  
  
  This just got better and better.  
  
  “But Ryan’s got all that money behind him. How can he be good for nothing?”  
  
  Dresser shot him a glance that told Carrick he wasn’t so drunk he didn’t recognize sarcasm when he heard it.  
  
  The bartender slid the drink across to Carrick, who lifted it in a swift and distracting salute. “Here’s to the oil companies. Long may they reign.”  
  
  “I suppose you’ve heard the story.” Dresser glanced behind him resentfully. “They’ve all heard the story, and they haven’t stopped chuckling yet.”  
  
  Carrick wisely kept quiet.  
\>  
  “Even that damn girl laughed. Laughed right in our faces!” Dresser shoved his glass back at the bartender, who refilled and returned it.  
  
  Carrick played dumb. “What damn girl, sir?”  
  
  “Miss Hannah Grey, RN. Dad’s nurse.” Dresser tipped the drink down his throat. “He gave that bitch fifty thousand for a blow job.”  
  
  “Must have been a good blow job.” Carrick spun his icy glass on the bar.  
  
  “Wide blue eyes, hair so blond it’s platinum, an innocent face, and a body that will not quit. Yeah, I imagine it was a hell of a blow job.” Dresser smiled a nasty smile. “Burkhart claimed she was an upright character. You should have seen the look on his face when she admitted she’d done it!”  
  
  “She admitted to a blow job? In front of the lawyer?”  
  
  “She didn’t say a blow job. She said she and Dad were . . . friends, in just that tone of voice. Sexy, but not bright.” Dresser smirked. “The family brought suit to stop the execution of the will.”  
  
  “How did that go?” Obviously not well, but Carrick liked making the patronizing bastard admit it.  
  
  “The will is clean. That damn Burkhart made sure of that. But I got revenge on Hannah Grey. I filed a suit with the state of New Hampshire. Her nursing certificate is suspended pending investigation, and her placement agency dropped her.”  
  
  An idea brewed in Carrick’s mind. “So Hannah Grey can’t work in the state of New Hampshire, and she’s living off the inheritance from your father. That won’t keep her for long.”  
  
  “Even better, she has no other resources, and it’s been five months since she’s held a job.” The open malice in Dresser’s face made Carrick almost sorry for Miss Hannah Grey. “I may be broke, I may be working for my living, but by God, she knows now she can’t play games with me and get away with it.”  
  
  There was nothing more to be learned from Jeff Dresser, so Carrick stood. “Give Ryan my regards, and tell him if I need insurance, I’ll definitely keep him in mind.”  
  
  Dresser rocked back on his stool as if Carrick had struck him—which he had, in a cunning show of gamesmanship.  
  
  Carrick took a few steps away, then turned back. “About this Hannah Grey. I imagine you see her occasionally.”  
  
  “Occasionally.” Hostility etched Dresser’s voice. “Why?”  
  
  “I’ll bet she’s too embarrassed to look you in the eyes.”  
  
  “Embarrassed? Are you kidding? That little witch smiles at me and lifts her chin.”  
  
  So Hannah Grey was Carrick’s kind of woman; she kept her eyes on the purse, and wasn’t squeamish about doing what had to be done to get it.  
  
  “Good,” Carrick said. “Good. That’s all I needed to know.”  
  
  THREE  
  
  Hannah sat in the small shop, Buzz Beans, her hands wrapped around her warm cup of French roast, stared at the screen of her laptop, and moaned softly.  
  
  Behind her, Sophia was cleaning the tables in the quiet neighborhood coffee shop. “Another rejection?” It wasn’t so much a question as a statement.  
  
  “If I don’t get a job pretty soon, I’m going to have to change my name, hitchhike to New York, and become a musical star.”  
  
  “You can’t sing or dance.” Sophia was the kid sister of Hannah’s best high school friend, and she knew all too well how Hannah sounded with a karaoke machine.  
  
  “Stop crushing my dreams.”  
  
  Sophia glanced toward the counter and lowered her voice. “How about a cheese pierogi? We made extras this morning and—”  
  
  “I’m fine. Thank you.” Hannah smiled at the young barista, trying to convey her appreciation while holding onto her pride.  
  
  “Yeah, but . . . Mr. Nowak has been bitching because you’re here every morning, buy one cup of coffee without any add-ins, and use his free Internet for two hours. Then you do it again in the afternoon. You know what a grump he is when he shouts.”  
  
  “So he’s been listening to Jeff Dresser.” Who, for all that he’d lost a lot of influence in this town, hadn’t yet been counted out as a mover and shaker.  
  
  “Yeah.” Sophia was squirming. “But I thought if you made a purchase—”  
  
  Hannah smiled at Sophia and said loudly, “When you’ve got a minute, Sophia, could I get a cheese pierogi and coffee?” Because she couldn’t afford the cheese pierogi, but she definitely couldn’t afford Internet hookup.  
  
  Mr. Nowak looked up from his paper, his sharp dark eyes fixed with hostile intent on Hannah. “Sophia, you keep cleaning. I’ll do it.”  
  
  Man, Hannah had announced she’d been one old man’s friend, and Mr. Nowak thought she could corrupt his helper. She waited patiently while he warmed the pierogi and fixed her coffee.  
  
  The brief illusion of security Mr. Dresser’s inheritance had offered had ended abruptly with her flash of temper. She had thought she might lose the inheritance. Instead, she’d lost the possibility of holding a job.  
  
  Five months ago, fifty thousand dollars had seemed like a fortune. Now, even with frugal living, the legal bills to fight for her nursing certificate and the lack of income had reduced her fifty thousand dollars to twenty-two thousand. And with Jeff Dresser using his influence to slow the investigation of misconduct, she was going to have to do something besides the work she knew and loved. Retail, probably, which she’d done in high school, and thoroughly hated.  
  
  “Here,” Mr. Nowak said. “I won’t charge you for the coffee.”  
  
  Maybe he wasn’t so bad after all. . . .  
  
  Then he smiled at her in that knowing way.  
  
  “I insist on paying.” She pushed the cup back toward him, because she’d seen that smile before, more times in the last five months than she wanted to remember, and on more men’s faces than she could bear to think about. And she was not giving this disgusting little troll of a man sex for a cup of coffee. Or for his free Internet. Or for fifty thousand dollars, either.  
  
  His smile disappeared. “You come here every day—”  
  
  The door chimed as someone came in.  
  
  Mr. Nowak’s voice swelled. “Buying your cup of coffee, using my Internet, when everyone in this town knows you are a slut.”  
  
  Hannah stiffened in humiliation and anger.  
  
  He continued. “Everyone in this state knows you got money from poor old Mr. Dresser by—”  
  
  A strange man spoke beside her. “Is there a problem here?”  
  
  Mr. Nowak pointed a finger at Hannah. “She tried to steal from me. She tried to steal a . . . a . . .”  
  
  “I’d be very careful, Mr. Nowak,” Hannah said steadily. “Very careful.”  
  
  His gaze shifted to Sophia, then back to Hannah, then to the stranger. Hannah could almost see him thinking of the gossip if he brought charges, and he shriveled like a three-day-old party balloon. “Go on. Take the food. Take the coffee. Get out and don’t come back. You . . . you . . .”  
  
  “Wait.” The stranger held up his hand. “If she was stealing from you, you should have her arrested. Shoplifting is a serious crime. But you can’t just bandy that charge around. That’s defamation of character. She could sue.”  
  
  The last person to stand up for her had been old Mr. Dresser himself. Now, in astonishment, Hannah turned to look at the stranger.  
  
  He was a fine-looking piece of man flesh: over six foot, whipcord thin, broad shoulders, dark hair, distinctive green eyes, her age or a little older. And he dressed like a wealthy businessman, in a conservative black suit with a dull gold tie.  
  
  “She could sue, but she wouldn’t win,” Mr. Nowak blustered.  
  
  “She’s a beautiful young woman,” the stranger said. “Juries always sympathize with a beautiful young woman.”  
  
  “You’re a lawyer,” Mr. Nowak said in revulsion.  
  
  The stranger shrugged.  
  
  Mr. Nowak started to say something ill advised, then with hard-won control changed his mind. “Sophia, come and take his order.” He disappeared into the back room.  
  
  Sophia whipped around the counter and washed her hands, smiling brightly all the time. “What can I get you, sir?”  
  
   
; “I’ll have a medium Earl Grey tea, hot, with a splash of milk.” He looked down at Hannah. “I know it’s ridiculous, but I learned to drink it that way when I was a kid. If you sit with me, I promise not to crook my pinkie.” And he smiled.  
  
  Hannah stood there, awestruck by his straight white teeth, his long black lashes, the dimple in his cheek.  
  
  “Wow,” Sophia said out loud.  
  
  Grabbing her cup, Hannah said, “I drink coffee. Black.” She winced. Scintillating, Hannah.  
  
  “That is so much more sensible.” He took the tea Sophia placed on the counter. “Let me pay for Miss . . . ?” He looked an inquiry at Hannah.  
  
  “Grey. Hannah Grey.”  
  
  “Let me pay for Miss Grey’s order, also. I don’t want the manager to come back when I’m gone and make trouble.”  
  
  “He’s the owner,” Sophia said.  
  
  At the same time, Hannah said, “I can pay for it.”  
  
  “He’s the owner? All the more reason.” He smiled at Sophia, whose jaw dropped at the gorgeous sight. Then he turned to Hannah. “Miss Grey, my mother is from one of the founding families in Maine. She lives in a hundred-fifty-year-old mansion on the coast, and as far as I can tell, she’s never left the twentieth century. She would kick my rear if she ever heard I let a lady buy her own coffee. So please spare my mother—she has arthritis and simply getting around is an effort.”  
  
  With indecent eagerness, Sophia said, “Really? Arthritis? What a coincidence. Hannah is a home-care nurse who specializes in arthritis cases. She’s the best!” She made eyes at Hannah, and used little shooing motions with her hands.  
  
  She was right. Hannah knew she was right. An arthritis patient? In Maine? Hannah couldn’t afford to let this opportunity slip through her fingers. She looked right into the stranger ’s eyes and said, “If you should ever need help with your mother, I am the best, and I’m between cases.”  
  
  “My mother won’t hear of a nurse, but she’s definitely getting to the point where I’m going to have to insist. . . .” He quirked an eyebrow, appealing to Hannah’s understanding.  
  
  She felt squeamish. She didn’t lie well, not even lies of omission. Her nursing certificate had been suspended. She should tell him that. She should, but if she didn’t get a job soon . . .

The winner was the Mango Green tea for sure, it had a very nice mango flavor. Half sugar was just enough sweetness.

  
They didn't have menus yet, but I grabbed a photo of the menu because I was surprised they had sushi rolls, and appetizers too. I'll definitely go back some day and try those.

1n70kr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Summonoodles/comments/1n70kr6/about_me/,🌻 About Me,"32 [ F4A ] 🌿 branching out to find close friends, anywhere they may be....

All welcome. Im putting effort into this post, hoping that we connect more deeply upfront. 

Ive met many great long-lasting friends on here, and im hoping to find more :)

Disability, LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, and general minority friendly! If you aren't, then gtfo! 🚪 

-----------------------------------

         ::: I am Seeking... ::: 

Im seeking long-term friends, online or not, with some kind of regular communication (inc calls). I want video/voice calls, and meeting new friends irl would be awesome too! But, text here first. Let's take it easy, and enjoy ourselves 😌

I prefer **video calls over voice.**

I like both long and deep convos, and those everyday ""how are you?"", with those simple daily details.

Know upfront - I write long messages too! I hope you like pen-paling 💌

**( OH , KY , IN area is where im at - southwest Ohio )**

BTW- I do not need ""chat buddies"", just ppl i click with who seek true friendship.

-----------------------------------

         ::: Personality :::
**I am...**
    >>> empathetic, passionate, silly goofy giggly, thoughtful, always trying to grow and learn, positive upbeat and optimistic, introspective, patient, inquisitive, complex, excitable, honest, open-minded, warm, loyal


         ::: Interests :::

I have a lot of interests that we may connect on, and if not, a positive attitude, a sense of humor, and your own passionate interests go a long way. 

- **Psychology** is my passion. Mental health, neurodivergencies, addiction, behavior, methods and theories, neurology, all of it. Ive studied it, and I've lived a lot of it, too.
- **Spirituality** is also a passion of mine. My approach is very eclectic and open. I love all things mystical. If you are at all religious and/or spiritual, we will have tons to talk about! If you aren't, no worries :) 
- **Nature**. Rock and fossil hunting 🪨 🦖. I love natural running water. I could sit in one spot in a river or creek for hours 💧 and insects are friends.
- **Arts and crafts.** I love to create. Im still learning though...everything I know so far is pretty basic. But, ive started zentangle drawings, i crochet, do macrame hemp jewlery, beaded and rock wire wrap jewlery, collages, and im in a ceramics class. I skip around 😅
- **Journaling.** Shadow work. Learning about myself.
- **Poetry.** Its been awhile since ive written. Share yours and inspire me?
- **Pets/Animals**. I currently have two dogs and one cat, but Ive had some different kinds of animals over the years. Do you have any?
- I play **billiards**, **corn hole**, **board games**, and/or **card games** weekly
- Im in an **improv** class and loving it. I need to watch more improv, any suggestions?
- I don't read much these days, but when i do its **non-fiction** about interests, or really random **comic books**. Or the **FF** comics.
- Update: im gonna learn the **ukulele!** like i said, im a beginner at a lot of these things, but im learning day by day. 

- **Other likes:** piercings, coffee, tea, waffle house, tootsie pops, turtles, **philosophy**, deep reflective and introspective convos, off-rail pedantic discussions, etymology is cool, **Buddism, Quakerism,** *anything mystical or supernatural*, **tarot**, divination, numerology, astrology, tats, incense and candles, *witchy stuff*, **pen-paling**, collections (got any?), entomology, puns/dad humor, also I want to learn ASL really bad but cant commit to it right now 


- **Media? Not really...** TV, movies, music, videos... it is ***not*** how I connect as a *foundation* for friendship. I need more, a lot more. However, I like rock, grunge, alt, punk, folk/indie, and some 80s and 00s pop. I watch family sitcoms and The Office. Futurama. AHS, Twilight Zone, and Black Mirror. ""Crazy Ex-Gf"" too. But i rarely watch anything.
Idc to watch movies much, either. But I like cult classics and B movies....and Marvel is pretty cool. TBC, I do like these things, just not as a foundation for friendship, or as starter convo.
I also have 0 interest in video games 😬

I **LOVE** silence 🏝

-----------------------------------

Im seeking platonic connections, but I am open to more potentially happening with a woman. I am pan-romantic and demi-sexual. To not be misleading, I am engaged to an enby and we practice ENM. Not looking for a triad or anything, and friendship is more important to me rn.

You dont have to make your intro this long! 😅 BUT *pretty please* put...
- age, gender, general location
- what we relate on
- some of your interests and hobbies 
- tell me something you like about yourself, so i know you read the post (get yourself that credit :). 

Thank you for your time and effort.

Because I know what I heard in those trees. I know what I saw just outside the firelight. I know what it left behind.

You can say I’m mistaken. That’s fine.

Just don’t tell me it wasn’t real.

It was my friend Marcus’s idea. It’s always Marcus’s idea—winter hikes, off-trail shortcuts, rafting when the river advisories say don’t. I usually give him a hard time and go anyway. But this time I pushed back more than usual.

“Where is it?” I asked.

“Old service road, maybe an hour off the highway.” He was scrolling on his phone, showing me a satellite view. A smear of green, a thin silver line, and then nothing—no campsites, no picnic icons, no little tent symbol. “Guy on a hunting forum flagged a clearing way out past the marked trails. Said it was quiet. No trash. No sign anyone’s camped there in years.”

“It’s posted?”

He shrugged. “Land management map says public. Nobody’s going to be out there.”

I should’ve said no.

We left early Friday—tents, water filters, a hatchet, lanterns, my old Polaroid camera because I liked the way photos feel when they develop in your hand. The truck rattled up a rutted road and died in a patch of gravel and weeds. Past that, the trees closed in. No cell service. No noise from the highway. Just us.

We cut through knee-high ferns and ankle-grabbing roots, worked our way deeper, and deeper, until the forest swallowed the ribbon of sky behind us. Marcus checked his grandfather’s brass compass every twenty minutes, tapping the glass like it would balk if he didn’t remind it of north. He had flagging tape—bright orange—looped around his wrist. Every hundred yards he tied a strip to a branch.

“Belt and suspenders,” he said, nodding at the compass and the tape. “No one’s getting lost.”

Four hours later, we reached the clearing.

It was bigger than I expected. Not a meadow—nothing as soft as that—but a broad circle of flattened grass surrounded by tall pines and black spruce. The ground sat strangely level, like someone had shaved the ridge and pressed it flat with a giant hand. No fire rings. No bottle caps. Not even old ash kicked into dirt. The place felt untouched.

And very, very quiet.

No wind. No birds. Not even the invisible hiss of insects that usually fills the spaces between trees. It felt like the forest had paused mid-breath to listen.

“Feels dead,” I said.

Marcus grinned. “Feels perfect.”

We set camp at the edge of the circle—two tents, a low fire pit scraped to mineral soil, food hung in a bear bag high on a limb. The light slid down the trunks and pooled at the base of the trees until it all went the color of copper. I snapped a Polaroid of the clearing—the pale grass, the two tents, the orange tape flickering on the perimeter like desperate little flags—and tucked the picture warm into my jacket pocket.

We ate beans and jerky cross-legged by the fire. Marcus told a story about his grandfather giving him the compass and telling him never to trust a trail that looks too easy.

“Like this one?” I asked, nodding toward the opening we’d carved into the brush.

He poked the fire. “This isn’t a trail.”

The shadows stretched thin and long. The trees’ silhouettes leaned over us until the circle of sky was a coin you could cover with your palm. I tried to name constellations. They seemed wrong. Shifted. The stars looked too sharp, like points punched through a black sheet.

When the fire burned down to heart-coals, we crawled into our tents. The nylon mushed the world into soft shapes and softer sounds. The zipper teeth muttered closed. I lay on my back and watched my breath fog the beam of my headlamp.

Sometime after midnight, I woke to a sound.

Not twigs popping. Not the light patter of a deer stepping cautious through brush.

Breathing.

Slow. Heavy. In and out, like bellows. Not close, not far. Just past the reach of the firelight, where the clearing pressed against the dark. It paced, measured, circling. The breaths didn’t match the rhythm of mine. They didn’t match Marcus’s, either; I could hear his soft, regular snore through the fabric. This was deeper. Deliberate. Something that enjoyed the drag of air.

Then the scrape.

Not on rocks. On bark. The long whisper of something hard and pointed drawn down a trunk. A pause. Another trunk. Another pause. Around us.

I held my breath until my chest hurt, until my body insisted on air and I let a little out and drew a little in, trying to move the tent as little as possible.

The breaths went on.

At some point—with no sound marking it—the air felt different. Thinner. Cleaner. The breathing wasn’t gone, exactly. It was… sated. Or amused. Or something I don’t have a word for.

When I woke again, it was gray morning and my mouth tasted like I’d been sucking pennies. Marcus had the camp stove going and kept glancing over my shoulder at the trees.

“You hear anything?” he asked.

“Breathing,” I said.

He nodded once, like that was an answer he’d been waiting for and didn’t like. “We’ll check the treeline after coffee.”

We followed the orange tape we’d tied the day before, shaking night from our legs. Fifteen feet into the trees, there were marks on a spruce: four parallel grooves, deep as a thumbnail is wide, scored from shoulder height down to the roots. The cuts were clean. Not bear. Not anything with a claw that tears and splinters. It looked like someone had carved meat from the wood with a blade that wasn’t smooth.

We found more marks. On three different trunks around the clearing, all at the same height. All pointed inward.

“Cougar?” I said, even though I knew that wasn’t right.

“Cougars don’t do that,” Marcus said. His fingers brushed the grooves and came back with resin shining. Fresh.

We left it. We had a day to fill, and pretending things are normal is an easy way to move your legs. We took the stream trail Marcus swore he’d seen on a topo map. It wasn’t a trail, exactly, but it was a depression in the duff that suggested other feet had once passed through. The forest opened a little into a place where light caught in the needles like dust and the water ran in a black vein across stones.

On the opposite bank, I saw them.

Carvings, in a dead oak that leaned over the creek. Dozens, maybe hundreds of little figures razor-cut into the bark, each no bigger than a matchbox. The same symbol over and over: a human shape bent backward so far its spine made a circle. Thin arms extended, thin legs braced, head tipped to the sky or where the sky should be if there weren’t trees.

Every one of them faced the direction of our clearing.

“Hey,” I said, pointing.

Marcus stared for a long time. “Those weren’t here last time.”

Last time. My skin tightened. “You’ve been out here before?”

He didn’t answer. He crouched and wetted a handkerchief in the stream, then scrubbed the closest marks. The water ran gray and then pinkish. The carvings had bled; whoever made them had cut through live cambium. He touched the pocket with his compass like he was checking it was still there.

We said very little the rest of the day.

Back at the clearing, we rebuilt the fire and stacked extra wood within reach. I swapped dead batteries for fresh. The first stars blinked through. I took another Polaroid, more to busy my hands than to make a record: tents, fire, Marcus’s profile in the orange light, the ring of trees beyond.

The smell came just after full dark.

Sweet and wrong. Not garbage, not skunk, not rot exactly. Like fruit syrup that’s been heated and left to sit until it turns. It moved before the breathing did, a soft ribbon of scent that slipped over the circle, tasting us, then slid back to the black.

Marcus’s knuckles were white around the haft of the hatchet. “Stay put,” he said, like I was thinking of wandering off.

The breathing started again.

Closer this time. It drew around us like a tide around an island. In and out, slow enough to count. Something scraped wood—lightly at first, then with pressure, then lightly again, like fingers testing grain.

My lantern stuttered. Not out. Just a slow dimming and brightening like a pulse syncing to the breaths.

The laugh came after.

If you can call it a laugh. Sound shaped wrong. A lung pushing air and catching on something to make it rise at the edges. Amusement without a mouth.

It froze me harder than the breathing.

The shadows at the edge of the clearing leaned; that’s the only way I can say it. The dark pushed itself closer, not by walking but by sort of reorganizing where it was. The fire had to decide how far it reached, and it chose us and nothing else.

Something stood just beyond that reach.

I saw the outline as a cut in the dark, not because it reflected light but because it refused it. Tall. Much too tall. Arms long and loose at its sides. Shoulders pointed. Ribs like the slats of an old barrel. A head tilted the wrong way, like a listening dog that doesn’t understand you.

I brought the Polaroid to my face and pressed the shutter.

The flash punched a hole in the night.

When it collapsed back in, the edge of the clearing was empty. The smell thickened.

We didn’t say a word. We didn’t sleep. Every noise meant the same thing so words weren’t useful anymore.

By dawn, mist hung knee-high over the grass. Everything that should have felt like relief just felt like a reprieve.

I checked the Polaroid as we packed.

The clearing wasn’t there. No trees. No tents. No auras of firelight. The whole frame was a wash of whiteness like snow with no texture. Centered on it—perfectly centered—was a little figure, bent backward into a circle.

Smiling with a mouth thin as a cut.

My first thought was that the camera was broken. But when I lifted it, I could feel the warm square still developing under my thumb. The lens was intact. The shutter had worked, and something had worked back.

“We’re leaving,” Marcus said. His voice was raw from not talking.

We should have made it back in three hours. It took us nine.

The forest we entered wasn’t the forest we left. The orange tape we’d tied on the way in hung in different places—higher on some trees, lower on others, and on one trunk it was threaded through a ring of gouges like someone had looped it into a smile. We reached places we didn’t remember passing and didn’t reach places we should have hit. The compass needle trembled in a slow circle no matter how often Marcus tapped the glass.

By mid-afternoon, I saw our own footprints in a patch of damp loam where a seep ran across the path. I felt a rush of relief—proof of a loop we could break if we only turned—but when I pressed my boot into the print it didn’t match. The tread pattern was right. The size was right. But the angle of the heel, the depth of pressure, the place where I scuffed my toe—none of it lined up with the way I walked. It was like the forest had traced my step wrong, or decided to try wearing it.

We stopped at a low rise to drink. That’s when I noticed the cairns.

Little stacks of rocks, no higher than my knee, circled the knoll. The top stone on each pile was a thin, flat piece carved with the same figure as the tree—the bent spine, the ring, the narrow arms—scratched with something sharper than a knife. Every cairn faced the direction we were traveling. All of them were new; their bases sat on leaves that hadn’t browned or curled. One stack had a feather tucked under the top stone. The feather was wet with something sweet and sticky.

Marcus’s face had gone a strange color. “We need to step off,” he said. “This is bad sign.” He said it like a phrase his grandfather had taught him along with how to hold a compass and how to clean a fish. He cut left, deeper into a tangle of young fir. I followed because going a different way from the only person you came with felt like volunteering to be the lesson the woods wanted to teach.

It got darker in the fir. Sound deadened. Our breath sounded too loud. The air felt warm in a way that wasn’t temperature. It felt like the woods had been warmed once, long ago, and remembered it now.

We broke out of the fir into another clearing.

Smaller than the first. Oval. The grass here was different—shorter, slicker, like hair on skin. The trees around it leaned inward a degree or two, enough to notice if you stood still. The sky above it pressed closer than it should.

In the center, there was a ring of wood. Not a structure, not a fence—just logs laid end to end in a perfect circle, bark peeled, pale wood exposed. Each log’s inner face was etched with the same figure as the tree, as the stones, as the Polaroid. On the outside of the circle, in the grass, were little arrangements of things—bird bones wired together with thin twine, teeth strung like beads, ropes braided of something that looked like fibers and looked like hair.

I didn’t step into the ring. Every part of me that still believed in being untouched by things like fear and consequences refused all at once.

Marcus edged along the perimeter and crouched. The pale wood wasn’t dry. It was damp. It smelled sweet.

“Let’s go,” he said.

We didn’t argue about direction anymore. We went away.

The forest let us.

By the time we reached the campsite, the sun was low and the clearing had that orange glow that makes everything it touches seem like a memory of itself. We didn’t see our tents until we were right at them. They looked… wrong. A little too tall. A little too narrow. The lines weren’t exactly the lines we’d pitched.

The bear bag hung on its limb, fat with food. The knot I’d used to tie it off was a knot I don’t know how to tie.

“Did you—” I started.

“No,” Marcus said.

My Polaroid was on my sleeping pad, face down. I hadn’t left it there. When I turned it over, it was a photo of the clearing, at night, with two figures standing at the edge where the trees begin. They were taller than the trees. They were bent backward in that circle way, arms too long and too slack. Between them, hanging on nothing, was something that might have been a smile.

Our fire pit had been rearranged. Not scattered—rearranged. The stones were stacked into a ring taller than my calf, maybe twenty inches high. There were marks on the inside of each stone—burns, but not from fire. Smudges, like something had exhaled on them until they turned black.

“Pack,” Marcus said. The word sounded like it hurt to push out. “We’re not staying another night.”

We moved fast. I shoved the Polaroid under my shirt because my pack felt too far away from my skin. I didn’t notice right away that the bright strips of orange tape on the perimeter branches were no longer bright. Their color had leeched to a pale, dull peach, like a photo left in the sun.

We should have left then.

We didn’t.

We were slow because there were more things to look at than our hands. We were slow because we didn’t want to turn our backs to the trees. We were slow because the world was the size of a circle and there was more outside it than there had been when we walked in.

By the time we had everything in place, the light had dipped into that last band of day when you can pretend you’re not about to be shut in. The forest’s quiet had grown teeth.

“It’ll be worse in the dark,” I said.

“I know,” Marcus said. He said it like he was agreeing with gravity. He swung his pack up. He didn’t look at me. “Go.”

We went.

We didn’t get very far.

The tape we’d put up wasn’t ours. It still sat on the branches where we’d tied it, but the knots were too tight, the tails too even. On one tree, someone had braided the tape into a little rope. On another, the end had been cut clean, not torn, the edges heat-sealed like plastic cut by wire. And on another, the tape hung in two strips like a pair of lips—one long, one short—and someone had scratched the bent-back figure into the bark between them where a mouth would be.

We walked faster.

The forest walked with us.

When we stopped to breathe, everything else stopped too.

When we started again, we didn’t know we had until a branch cracked somewhere to our left and the crack was answered by a crack to our right the same distance away. Like something pacing us at the distance of a thought.

Full dark fell in a way that felt more like being closed in than losing light.

The breathing came immediately.

Not outside us. Around us. The sound didn’t come from a place; it unrolled like a coil and we were in the center of it. Inhale. Exhale. Slow. Measured. Not the rhythm of an animal moving under its weight and air. The rhythm of something counting.

We kept going because stopping meant choosing a position to die in.

I don’t know how long we walked. My hands hurt from where nail met skin. My breath made small clouds that turned to black faster than they should.

Somewhere in the middle of that, I realized Marcus wasn’t beside me.

I turned.

My headlamp picked out trunks and brush and the white flash of the tape. There wasn’t a sound of me and there wasn’t a sound of Marcus. The breathing went on like we were nothing in it.

“Marcus?” I said, not loud. That word didn’t belong in the breathing.

No answer.

“Marcus,” I tried again.

The breathing stopped.

The forest held absolutely still.

Then something in front of me moved that wasn’t me, wasn’t wind, wasn’t anything I have a word for. The dark rearranged itself. My headlamp found two points of pale that weren’t eyes because there weren’t eyes there, just the places where eyes would be if something had them and closed them, and above those the suggestion of a forehead and above that too much nothing.

I took a step back and my heel hit a root.

Something brushed my sleeve.

Not a hand. Not fur. The memory of a hand.

I ran.

Branches slapped my face and cut my lips. The tape flashed in little funerals of orange that didn’t help. My headlamp caught the white flare of exposed wood where something had rubbed bark away and made it smooth. The woods stopped being a place and became lines of dark I had to not run into.

When the breathing stopped again, I fell.

I don’t remember landing.

I don’t remember getting up.

I remember crawling. Dirt under my nails. The smell of earth and that other smell, the sweet one that makes you think of sugar and heat and then turns in your throat. I remember a shape in front of me that was lighter than everything else and then cool air on my face and the tight, unsteady miracle of stars.

I was at the edge of a road cut into a hillside. A narrow ditch ran along it. The ditch held a trickle of water and the reflection of my headlamp looked like a startled animal. The road’s gravel was the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen.

I don’t remember how I got back to the truck. The door was open. There was dirt on the seat I don’t remember dragging in. The keys were in my pocket where I don’t remember putting them.

I woke up in my apartment two days later. The sheets were muddy. My mouth tasted like I’d been breathing through metal. My Polaroid camera sat on the kitchen table next to a glass of water I hadn’t poured. The photo of the clearing with the single bent figure lay under the glass like I’d put it there to keep it flat.

Marcus’s pack wasn’t in my living room. His boots weren’t by the door. His jokes weren’t in my head where they should’ve been.

His number was disconnected.

His socials were empty. Not deactivated. Not private. Scrubbed.

The orange tape I’d tied and retied around my wrist that first day sat on the counter, pale as old scars.

And then someone slid something under my door.

It made a soft whispering sound when it came to a stop. I thought it was junk mail until I saw the knot.

It was a strip of pale leather tied around a bundle of hair.

Hair braided the same way Marcus used to braid his sister’s hair at her soccer games when she asked him to “do the rope one.” I recognized the pattern. He’d shown me once, leaning over a picnic table, laughing at how serious I looked while I tried to copy him.

The braid was cut clean at one end. The cut had been heat-sealed.

There were markings burned into the leather. Not letters I knew. Not any runic alphabet my desperate Googling would later suggest. Little figures in a line, each a perfect version of the one before: the bent body, the ring spine, the praised sky, the long thin limbs.

And on the inside of the leather, pressed into it like someone had used a brand smaller than a thumbnail, were five words in English.

YOU WERE MEANT TO WATCH.

They weren’t crooked. They weren’t shaky. They sat straight and clean like something had pressed them one after the other with care.

I stared at the braid so long my vision went white at the edges.

When I blinked and the room came back, the Polaroid camera had moved.

It was closer to me by a few inches. The lens faced my chest. The strap hung off the table like a tongue. I hadn’t touched it.

I picked it up. My thumb found the shutter because that’s what hands do when they don’t know what else to do.

The flash went off in my face. The apartment lit white and then collapsed back into itself.

I put the camera down and waited for the photo to develop.

The square stayed gray longer than it should have. Then an image came up like bruises emerging.

It was the clearing.

Not the way my eyes had ever seen it. The grass was too smooth. The trees leaned in too far. The tents weren’t tents. The ring of stones around the fire pit was taller and the black on the inside of each was wet.

Two figures stood at the edge of the frame.

They were bent backward into rings. They were taller than the trees. Where their faces should have been were the places for faces. And between them, on nothing, a thin smile hung the way a strip of leather hangs when it’s been tied and then slipped.

In the bottom right corner, smaller than my thumbnail, a third figure stood between the first two like a child between adults crossing a street.

Its face was Marcus’s.

I’m not posting this for attention. I don’t care if you believe me.

I’m posting it because sometimes, just before dawn, I hear breathing in my apartment walls. Not mice. Not air through vents. The slow, patient draw of something that likes reminding me it doesn’t have to hurry.

And because the orange tape that I keep finding tied around my cabinet handles and my bedpost is getting paler.

And because I woke up yesterday with resin on my fingers and four parallel grooves scraped into the wood of my kitchen table at the exact height my shoulder is when I stand there.

And because the Polaroid I left face down on the counter last night was on the floor this morning, and when I turned it over, it was blank white except for a thin ring in the center, burned so lightly into the paper that you only see it if you tilt it to the light.

I don’t need sympathy.

I just need someone else to admit the woods aren’t empty.

They breathe.

They wait.

And if you camp in the wrong circle, they smile.",2,1756859617.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Jesus, he was thirsty. He knew all he had to do was open his lips and the water would flow down his throat, but he wanted to see beyond the arched doorway first. It was huge and ornately carved, beckoning him forward. . . .  
  
  Then he was through the arch and the city was spread before him.  
  
  Giant white columns built to stand forever. Streets laid out in perfect order. Glory and symmetry everywhere . . .  
  
  “Kelby.”  
  
  He was being shaken. Nicholas. He came instantly alert. “Time?” he whispered.  
  
  Nicholas nodded. “They should be coming back for you again in five minutes. I just wanted to make sure we’re on the same page. I’ve decided we scratch the plan and I take them out by myself.”  
  
  “Screw you.”  
  
  “You’ll blow it for both of us. You haven’t had anything to eat or drink in three days, and you looked like a truck ran over you when they brought you back to the cell.”  
  
  “Shut up. It hurts my throat to argue.” He leaned back against the stone wall and closed his eyes. “We go as we planned. I give the word. Just tell me when they start down the hall. I’ll be ready.”  
  
  Go back to the sea. There’s strength there. No thirst that couldn’t be satisfied. He could move without pain through the buoyant water.  
  
  White columns shimmering . . .  
  
  “They’re coming,” Nicholas murmured.  
  
  Kelby opened his eyes only a slit as the door was unlocked. The same two guards. Hassan had an Uzi cradled in his arm. Kelby was so hazy he couldn’t remember the other guard’s name. But he could remember the toe of his boot as he kicked in his rib. Yes, he could remember that.  
  
  Ali, that was the bastard’s name.  
  
  “Get up, Kelby.” Hassan was standing over him. “Is the American dog ready for his beating?”  
  
  Kelby groaned.  
  
  “Get him, Ali. He’s too weak to stand up and face us again.”  
  
  Ali was smiling as he came to stand beside Hassan. “He’ll break this time. We’ll be able to drag him into Baghdad and show the whole world what cowards the Americans are.”  
  
  He reached down to grab Kelby’s shirt.  
  
  “Now.” Kelby’s foot lashed upward and connected with Ali’s nuts. Then he rolled sideways, knocking the Arab’s legs from beneath him.  
  
  He heard Hassan mutter a curse as Kelby leapt to his feet. He got in back of Ali before he could get off his knees, and his arm snaked around Ali’s neck.  
  
  He broke it with one twist.  
  
  He whirled to see Nicholas smashing the Uzi into Hassan’s head. Blood spurted. Nicholas hit him again.  
  
  “Out.” Kelby grabbed Ali’s pistol and knife and ran to the door. “Don’t waste time on him.”  
  
  “He wasted a lot of time on you. I wanted to make sure he’d gone to Allah.” But he was running after Kelby down the hall.  
  
  In the front office another guard jumped to his feet and reached for his gun. Kelby cut his throat before he could lift it.  
  
  Then they were outside the hut and running toward the hills.  
  
  Shots behind them.  
  
  Keep running.  
  
  Nicholas looked over his shoulder. “Are you okay?”  
  
  “Fine. Go on, dammit.”  
  
  Sharp pain in his side.  
  
  Don’t stop.  
  
  The adrenaline was draining away and weakness was dragging at every limb.  
  
  Go away from it. Concentrate. You’re swimming toward the archway. No pain there.  
  
  He was running faster, stronger. The hills were just ahead. He could make it.  
  
  He was through the archway. White columns gleamed in the distance.  
  
  Marinth . . .  
  
  LONTANA’S ISLAND  
  
  LESSER ANTILLES  
  
  Present Day  
  
  Lacy golden fretwork.  
  
  Velvet drapery.  
  
  Drums.  
  
  Someone coming toward her.  
  
  It was going to happen again.  
  
  Helpless. Helpless. Helpless.  
  
  The scream that tore from Melis’s throat jarred her awake.  
  
  She jerked upright in bed. She was shaking, her T-shirt soaked with sweat.  
  
  Kafas.  
  
  Or Marinth?  
  
  Sometimes she wasn’t sure. . . . It didn’t matter.  
  
  Only a dream.  
  
  She wasn’t helpless. She’d never be helpless again. She was strong now.  
  
  Except when she had the dreams. They robbed her of power and she was forced to remember. But she had the dreams less often now. It had been over a month since the last one. Still, she might feel better if she had someone to talk to. Maybe she should call Carolyn and—  
  
  No, deal with it. She knew what to do after the dreams to rid herself of these trembling fits and get back to blessed normalcy. She tore off her nightshirt as she left the bedroom and headed toward the lanai.  
  
  A moment later she was diving off the lanai into the sea.  
  
  It was the middle of the night, but the water was only cool, not cold, and felt like liquid silk on her body. Clean and caressing and soothing . . .  
  
  No threat. No submission. Nothing but the night and the sea. God, it was good to be alone.  
  
  But she wasn’t alone.  
  
  Something sleek and cool brushed against her leg.  
  
  “Susie?” It had to be Susie. The female dolphin was much more physically affectionate than Pete. The male touched her only rarely, and it was something special when he did.  
  
  But Pete was beside her in the water. She saw him out of the corner of her eye as she stroked toward the nets that barricaded the inlet. “Hi, Pete. How are you doing?”  
  
  He gave a subdued series of clicks and then dove beneath the surface. A moment later Susie and Pete came to the surface together and swam ahead of her toward the nets. It was strange how they always knew when she was upset. Ordinarily their behavior was playful, almost giddily exuberant. It was only when they sensed she was disturbed that they became this docile. She was supposed to be the one teaching the dolphins, but she was learning from them every day she spent in their company. They enriched her life and she was grateful that—  
  
  Something was wrong.  
  
  Susie and Pete were both squeaking and clicking frantically as they approached the net. A shark on the other side?  
  
  She tensed.  
  
  The net was down.  
  
  What the hell . . . No one could unfasten the net unless they knew where it was connected. “I’ll take care of it. Go back home, guys.”  
  
  The dolphins ignored her, swimming around her protectively while she examined the net. No cuts, no tears in the strong wire. It took her only a few minutes to fasten the net again. She set off back to the cottage, her strokes strong, purposeful—and wary.  
  
  It didn’t have to be a problem. It could be Phil back from his latest journey. Her foster father had been gone for nearly seven months this time, with only an occasional phone call or postcard to tell her if he was alive or dead.  
  
  But it could b  
e trouble. Phil had been forced to go on the run almost two years ago and the threat was only partially eliminated. There could still be people out there who wanted to get their hands on him. Phil wasn’t the most discreet person in the world, and his judgment wasn’t as keen as his intellect. He was a dreamer who took more chances than—  
  
  “Melis!”  
  
  She became still, paddling in place, her gaze on the lanai a short distance away. She could see a man’s silhouette outlined against the lights of the living room. It wasn’t Phil’s small, wiry frame. This man was big, muscular, and vaguely familiar.  
  
  “Melis, I didn’t mean to scare you. It’s me, Cal.”  
  
  She relaxed. Cal Dugan, Phil’s first mate. No threat here. She had known and liked Cal since she was sixteen. He must have moored his boat at the pier on the other side of the house, where she couldn’t see it. She swam toward the lanai. “Why didn’t you call me? And why the devil didn’t you put the net back up? If a shark had gotten to Pete or Susie, I’d have strangled you.”  
  
  “I was going to go back and do it,” he said defensively. “Nah, I was going to persuade you to do it. I’d have to know Braille to be able to hook it up in the dark.”  
  
  “That’s not good enough. It only takes a minute to pose a threat to the dolphins. You’re just lucky it didn’t happen.”  
  
  “How do you know a shark didn’t get in?”  
  
  “Pete would have told me.”  
  
  “Oh, yeah. Pete.” He dropped a bath towel on the lanai and turned his back. “Tell me when I can turn around. I guess you haven’t taken to wearing a swimsuit?”  
  
  “Why should I? There’s no one to see me but Pete and Susie.” She hoisted herself onto the tiles and wrapped the large towel around her. “And uninvited guests.”  
  
  “Don’t be rude. Phil invited me.”  
  
  “Turn around. When’s he coming? Tomorrow?”  
  
  He turned around. “Not likely.”  
  
  “He’s not in Tobago?”  
  
  “He was setting sail for Athens when he sent me here.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “He told me to hop on a plane out of Genoa and come and give you this.” He handed her a large manila envelope. “And to wait here for him.”  
  
  “Wait for him? He’ll need you there. He can’t do without you, Cal.”  
  
  “That’s what I told him.” He shrugged. “He told me to come to you.”  
  
  She glanced down at the envelope. “I can’t see out here. Let’s go inside where there’s light.” She tightened the towel around her. “Make yourself some coffee while I take a look at this.”  
  
  He flinched. “Will you tell those dolphins I’m not going to hurt you and to stop screeching?”  
  
  She’d barely been aware they were still beside the lanai. “Go away, guys. It’s okay.”  
  
  Pete and Susie disappeared beneath the water.  
  
  “I’ll be damned,” Cal said. “They do understand you.”  
  
  “Yes.” Her tone was abstracted as she went into the cottage. “Genoa? What’s Phil been up to?”  
  
  “Search me. A few months ago he dropped me and the rest of the crew off in Las Palmas and told us we were on vacation for three months. He hired some temporary help to sail the Last Home and took off.”  
  
  “Where?”  
  
  He shrugged. “He wouldn’t say. Big secret. It wasn’t like Phil at all. It was like that time he went off with you. But this was different. He was on edge and he wouldn’t say anything when he came back and picked us up.” He grimaced. “It’s not as if we haven’t been with him for the last fifteen years. We have shared a hell of a lot together. I was there when he brought up the Spanish galleon, and Terry and Gary signed on a year later. It kind of . . . hurt.”  
  
  “You know when he becomes focused on something he can’t see anything else.” But she had seldom known him to close out his crew. They were as close to family as Phil would permit near him. Closer than he would let her come.  
  
  But that was probably her fault. She found it difficult to be openly affectionate with Phil. She had always been the protector in a relationship that had sometimes been both volatile and stormy. She was often impatient and frustrated with his almost childlike single-mindedness. But they were a team, they fulfilled each other’s needs, and she did like him.  
  
  “Melis.”  
  
  She glanced at Cal to find him gazing awkwardly at her. “Would you mind putting on some clothes? You’re one gorgeous woman, and even though I may be old enough to be your father, it doesn’t mean I don’t have the usual responses.”  
  
  Of course he did. It didn’t matter that he’d known her from the time she was a teenager. Men were men. Even the best of them were dominated by sex. It had taken her a long time to accept that truth without anger. “I’ll be right back.” She headed for the bedroom. “Make that coffee.”  
  
  She didn’t bother to shower before she put on her usual shorts and T-shirt. Then she sat down on the bed and reached for the envelope. It might be nothing, totally impersonal, but she didn’t want to open it in front of Cal.  
  
  The envelope contained two documents. She took out the first one and opened it.  
  
  She stiffened. “What the hell . . .”  
  
  HYATT HOTEL  
  
  ATHENS, GREECE  
  
  “Stop arguing. I’m coming to get you.” Melis’s hand tightened on the phone. “Where are you, Phil?”  
  
  “At a tavern on the waterfront. The Delphi Hotel,” Philip Lontana said. “But I’m not going to involve you in this, Melis. Go home.”  
  
  “I will. We’re both going to go home. And I’m already involved. Did you think I was just going to sit around doing nothing after I got that notification that you’d deeded the island and the Last Home over to me? That’s the closest to a last will and testament I’ve ever seen. What the hell’s happening?”  
  
  “I had to turn responsible sometime.”  
  
  Not Phil. He was as close to Peter Pan as a man in his sixties could be. “What are you afraid of?”  
  
  “I’m not afraid. I just wanted to take care of you. I know we’ve had our ups and downs, but you’ve always stood by me when I needed you. You’ve pulled me out of scrapes and kept those bloodsuckers from—”  
  
  “I’ll pull you out of this scrape, too, if you’ll tell me what’s happening.”  
  
  “Nothing’s happening. The ocean is unforgiving. You can never tell when I’ll make a mistake and never—”  
  
  “Phil.”  
  
  “I’ve written it all down. It’s on the Last Home.”  
  
  “Good. Then you can read it to me when we’re on our way back to the island.”  
  
  “That may not be possible.” He paused. “I’ve been trying to get in touch with Jed Kelby. He’s not been answering my calls.”  
  
  “Bastard.”  
  
  “Maybe. But a brilliant bastard. I’ve heard he’s a genius.”  
  
  “And where did you hear it? His publicity agent?”  
  
  “Don’t be bitter. You’ve got to give the devil his due.”  
  
  “No, I don’t. I don’t like rich men who think they can make toys of everything in the whole damn world.”  
  
  “You don’t like rich men. Period,” Phil said. “But I need you to contact him. I don’t know if I’ll be able to reach him.”  
  
  “Of course you will. Though I don’t know why you think you have to do it. You’ve never called in help before.”  
  
  “I need him. He’s got the same passion I have and the drive to make it happen.” He paused. “Promise me you’ll get him for me, Melis. It’s the most important thing I’ve ever asked of you.”  
  
  “You don’t have to—”  
  
  “Promise me.”  
  
  He wasn’t going to give up. “I promise. Satisfied?”  
  
  “No, I hated to ask you. And I hate being in this spot. If I hadn’t been so stubborn, I wouldn’t have had to—” He drew a deep breath. “But that’s water under the bridge. I can’t look back now. There’s too much to look forward to.”  
  
  “Then why make out your last will and testament, dammit?”  
  
  “Because they didn’t get a ch  
ance to do it.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “We should learn from their mistakes.” He paused. “Go home. Who’s taking care of Pete and Susie?”  
  
  “Cal.”  
  
  “I’m surprised you’re letting him do it. You care more about those dolphins than anyone on two legs.”  
  
  “Evidently I don’t, if I’m here. Cal will take good care of Pete and Susie. I put the fear of God in him before I left.”  
  
  He chuckled. “Or the fear of Melis. But you know how important they are. Go back to them. If you don’t hear from me in two weeks, go get Kelby. Good-bye, Melis.”  
  
  “Don’t you dare hang up. What do you want Kelby to do? Is this about that damn sonic device?”  
  
  “You know it’s never really been about that.”  
  
  “Then what is it about?”  
  
  “I knew it would upset you. Ever since you were a child, you’ve always had a thing about the Last Home.”  
  
  “Your ship?”  
  
  “No, the other Last Home. Marinth.” He hung up.  
  
  She stood there, frozen, for a long moment before she slowly closed her phone.  
  
  Marinth.  
  
  My God.  
  
  THE Trina  
  
  VENICE, ITALY  
  
  “What the hell is Marinth?”  
  
  Jed Kelby stiffened in his chair. “What?”  
  
  “Marinth.” John Wilson looked up from the pile of letters he’d been scanning for Kelby. “That’s all that’s written in this letter. Just the one word. Must be some kind of prank or advertising gimmick.”  
  
  “Give it to me.” Kelby slowly reached across the desk and took the letter and envelope.  
  
  “Something wrong, Jed?” Wilson stopped sorting the letters he’d just brought on board.  
  
  “Maybe.” Kelby glanced at the name on the return address of the envelope. Philip Lontana, and the date stamp was over two weeks old. “Why the hell didn’t I get this sooner?”  
  
  “You might have, if you’d stay in one place more than a day or two,” Wilson said dryly. “I haven’t even heard from you in two weeks. I can’t be held responsible for keeping you current if you don’t cooperate. I do my best, but you’re not the easiest man to—”  
  
  “Okay, okay.” He leaned back and stared down at the letter. “Philip Lontana. I haven’t heard anything about him for a few years. I thought maybe he’d quit the business.

I’ve never heard of him.”  
  
  “Why should you? He’s not a stockbroker or banker, so he wouldn’t be of interest to you.”  
  
  “That’s right. I’m only interested in keeping you filthy rich and out of the clutches of the IRS.” Wilson set several documents in front of Kelby. “Sign these in triplicate.” He watched disapprovingly as Kelby signed the contracts. “You should have read those. How do you know I didn’t screw you?”  
  
  “You’re morally incapable of it. If you were going to do it, you’d have taken me to the cleaners ten years ago when you were tottering on the verge of bankruptcy.”  
  
  “True. But you pulled me out of that hole. So that’s not really a test.”  
  
  “I let you flounder for a while to see what you’d do before I stepped in.”  
  
  Wilson tilted his head. “I never realized that I was on trial.”  
  
  “Sorry.” His gaze was still on the letter. “It’s the nature of the beast. I’ve not been able to trust many people in my life, Wilson.”  
  
  God knows that was the truth, Wilson thought. Heir to one of America’s largest fortunes, Kelby and his trust fund had been fought over by his mother and grandmother from the time his father died. Court case had followed court case until he’d reached his twenty-first birthday. Then he’d taken control with a cool ruthlessness and intelligence, jettisoned all contact with his mother and grandmother, and set up experts to manage his finances. He’d finished his education and then taken off to become the wanderer he was today. He’d been a SEAL during the Gulf War, later purchased the yacht Trina and started a series of underwater explorations that had brought him a fame he didn’t appreciate and money he didn’t need. Still, he seemed to thrive on the life. For the past eight years he’d lived hard and fast and dealt with some pretty unsavory characters. No, Wilson couldn’t blame him for being both wary and cynical. It didn’t bother him. He was cynical himself, and over the years he’d learned to genuinely like the bastard.  
  
  “Has Lontana tried to contact me before?” Kelby asked.  
  
  Wilson sorted through the rest of the mail. “That’s the only letter.” He flipped open his daybook. “One call on the twenty-third of June. Wanted you to return his call. Another on June twenty-fifth. Same message. My secretary asked what his business pertained to but he wouldn’t tell her. It didn’t seem urgent enough to try to track you down. Is it?”  
  
  “Possibly.” He stood up and walked across the cabin to the window. “He certainly knew how to get my attention.”  
  
  “Who is he?”  
  
  “A Brazilian oceanographer. He got a lot of press when he discovered that Spanish galleon fifteen years or so ago. His mother was American and his father Brazilian, and he’s something of a throwback to another age. I heard he thought he was some kind of grand adventurer and sailed around looking for lost cities and sunken galleons. He discovered only one galleon, but there’s no doubt he’s very sharp.”  
  
  “You’ve never met him?”  
  
  “No, I wasn’t really interested. We wouldn’t have much in common. I’m definitely a product of this age. We’re not on the same wavelength.”  
  
  Wilson wasn’t so sure. Kelby was no dreamer, but he possessed the aggressive, bold recklessness that typified the buccaneers of this or any other century. “So what does Lontana want with you?” His gaze narrowed on Kelby. “And what do you want with Lontana?”  
  
  “I’m not sure what he wants from me.” He stood looking out at the sea, thinking. “But I know what I want from him. The question is, can he give it to me?”  
  
  “That’s cryptic.”  
  
  “Is it?” He suddenly turned to face Wilson. “Then, by God, we’d better get everything clear and aboveboard, hadn’t we?”  
  
  Shock rippled through Wilson as he saw the recklessness and excitement in Kelby’s expression. The aggressive energy he was emitting was almost tangible. “Then I take it you want me to contact Lontana.”  
  
  “Oh, yes. In fact, we’re going to go see him.”  
  
  “We’re? I have to get back to New York.”  
  
  Kelby shook his head. “I may need you.”  
  
  “You know I don’t know anything about all this oceanography stuff, Jed. And, dammit, I don’t want to know. I have degrees in law and accounting. I wouldn’t be of any use to you.”  
  
  “You never can tell. I may need all the help I can get. A little more sea air will do you good.” He glanced down at the envelope again, and Wilson was once more aware of the undercurrent of excitement that was electrifying Kelby. “But maybe we should give Lontana a little advance warning that he shouldn’t dangle a carrot unless he expects me to gobble it with one swallow. Give me his telephone number.”  
  
  She was being followed.  
  
  It wasn’t paranoia, dammit. She could feel it.  
  
  Melis glanced over her shoulder. It was an exercise in futility. She wouldn’t have known whom she was looking for on the crowded dock behind her. It could be anyone. A thief, a sailor eager for a lay . . . or someone who was hoping she’d lead him to Phil. Anything was possible.  
  
  Now that Marinth was involved.  
  
  Lose him.  
  
  She darted down the next street, ran one short block, ducked into an alcove, and waited. Making sure you weren’t being paranoid was always the first rule. The second was to know your enemy.  
  
  A gray-haired man in khakis and a short-sleeved plaid shirt came around the corner and stopped. He looked like any casual tourist who frequented Athens this time of year. Except that his annoyed attitude didn’t match his appearance. He was definitely irritated as his gaze searched the people streaming down the street.  
  
  She was not paranoid. And now she would remember this man, whoever he was.  
  
  She darted out of the alcove and took off running. She turned left, cut into an alley, and then turned right at the next street.  
  
  She glanced behind her in time to see a glimpse of a plaid shirt. He was no longer trying to blend in with the crowd. He was moving fast and with purpose.  
  
  Five minutes later she stopped, breathing hard.  
  
  She had lost him. Maybe.  
  
  Christ, Phil, what have you gotten us into?  
  
  She waited another ten minutes to make sure and then reversed her path and cut back toward the dock. According to her street map, the Delphi Hotel should be on the next block.  
  
  There it was. A narrow, three-story building whose facade was old, paint-chipped, stained by smog, and yet breathing atmosphere as everything did in this town. It wasn’t a hotel Phil would have ordinarily tolerated. He liked old and atmospheric, but decay wasn’t his forte. He enjoyed his comforts too much. Another mystery that—  
  
  “Melis?”  
  
  She turned to see a small, graying man in jeans and T-shirt sitting at a café table. “Gary? Where’s Phil?”  
  
  He nodded at the water. “On the Last Home.”  
  
  “Without you? I don’t believe it.” First Cal and now Gary St. George?  
  
  “Neither did I.” He took a sip of his ouzo. “I figure I’ll stick around for a few days and he’ll come back and get me. What can he do without me? He’d have real trouble sailing the Last Home by himself.”  
  
  “What about Terry?”  
  
  “Fired him in Rome right after he sent Cal away. Told him to go to you and you’d find him work. Told me the same thing.” He grinned. “You ready to become a headhunter for us, Melis?”  
  
  “How long has he been gone?”  
  
  “An hour maybe. Took off right after he talked to you.”  
  
  “Where was he going?”  
  
  “Southeast, toward the Greek Islands.”  
  
  She moved toward the dock. “Come on, let’s go.”  
  
  He jumped to his feet. “Where?”  
  
  “I’m going to rent a speedboat and go after the idiot. I may need someone to run it while I look out for the Last Home.”  
  
  “It’s still daylight.” He tried to catch up with her. “We’ve got a chance.”  
  
  “No chance about it. We’re going to find him.”  
  
  They caught up with the Last Home just bef  
ore darkness fell. The two-masted schooner looked like a ship from another age in the soft light. Melis had always told Phil that the ship reminded her of pictures of the Flying Dutchman, and in the hazy golden twilight it appeared even more mystical.  
  
  And, like the Dutchman, deserted.  
  
  She felt a ripple of fear. No, it couldn’t be deserted. Phil had to be belowdeck.  
  
  “Spooky, huh?” Gary said as he gunned the motorboat toward the ship. “He’s turned the engines off. What the hell is he doing?”  
  
  “Maybe he’s having trouble. He deserves it. Getting rid of his crew and taking off like—” She broke off to steady her voice. “Get as close as you can. I’m going to board her.”  
  
  “I don’t think he’s going to roll out the welcome mat.” Gary squinted at the ship. “He didn’t want you here, Melis. He didn’t want any of us on this trip.”  
  
  “Too bad. I can’t help what he wants. You know Phil sometimes doesn’t make the best choices. He sees what he wants to see and then goes full speed ahead. I can’t let—There he is!”  
  
  Phil had appeared from below and was frowning as he gazed at them over the expanse of water.  
  
  “Phil, dammit, what are you doing?” she shouted. “I’m coming aboard.”  
  
  Phil shook his head. “Something’s wrong with the ship. The engine just stopped. I can’t be sure—”  
  
  “What’s wrong?”  
  
  “I should have known. I should have been more careful.”  
  
  “You’re talking crazy.”  
  
  “And I don’t have time to talk anymore. I have to go and see if I can find where he— Go home, Melis. Take care of the dolphins. It’s important that you do your job.”  
  
  “We need to talk. I’m not going to—” She was talking to air. Phil had turned and gone back down below.  
  
  “Get me closer.”  
  
  “He won’t let you board her, Melis.”  
  
  “Yes, he will. Even if I have to hang on to the anchor all the way to—”  
  
  The Last Home exploded into a thousand fiery pieces.  
  
  Phil!  
  
  “No!” She didn’t realize she’d screamed the word in an agony of rejection. The ship was burning, half of it gone. “Get closer! We have to—”  
  
  Another explosion.  
  
  Pain.  
  
  Her head was splintering, exploding like the ship.  
  
  Darkness.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  ST. CATHERINE’S HOSPITAL  
  
  ATHENS, GREECE  
  
  “Melis Nemid has a concussion,” Wilson said. “One of Lontana’s crew brought her here after the explosion. The doctors think she’s going to be fine, but she’s been unconscious for the last twenty-four hours.”  
  
  “I want to see her.” Kelby moved down the hall. “Get me permission.”  
  
  “Maybe you didn’t hear me. She’s out, Jed.”  
  
  “I want to be there when she wakes up. I have to be the first one to talk to her.”  
  
  “This hospital is pretty strict. And you’re not family. They may not want to let you in her room until after she becomes conscious.”  
  
  “Get them to do it. I don’t care if you have to give a big enough bribe to buy the hospital. And check back with the coast guard and see if they’ve located Lontana’s body yet. Then go find the man who brought Lontana’s daughter here and pump him. I want to know everything there is to know about what happened to Lontana and the Last Home. What room is she in?”  
  
  “Twenty-one.” He hesitated. “Jed, she’s just lost her father. For God’s sake, what’s the hurry?”  
  
  The urgency was that for the first time in years Kelby had been given hope and it was being snatched away from him. He’d be damned if he’d let that happen. “I’m not going to give her the third degree. To use one of your favorite phrases, that would be nonproductive. I do have a certain amount of tact.”  
  
  “When you want to use it.” Wilson shrugged. “But you’ll do what you want to do. Okay, I’ll deal with the nurses first and then go see what else I can find out about the explosion.”  
  
  Which probably wouldn’t be much, Kelby thought. According to the news broadcast they had heard on the way here, the explosion had virtually ripped the ship apart. He’d gone first to the disaster site, and there had been practically nothing to salvage. At the moment they were calling it an accident. Not likely. There had been two explosions at opposite ends of the ship.  
  
  Twenty-one.  
  
  He opened the door and went into the room. A woman lay in the single bed dominating the pleasant, serene room. No nurses, thank God. Wilson was good, but he needed time to pave the way. He grabbed a chair from beside the door and carried it over to the bed. She didn’t stir as he sat down and began studying her.  
  
  Melis Nemid’s head was bandaged, but he could see strands of blond hair clinging to her cheeks. Jesus, she was . . . exceptional. Her body was small, fine-boned, and she appeared as fragile as a Christmas ornament. It was incredibly moving to see someone that delicate hurt. It reminded him of Trina and those times when—  
  
  My God, he hadn’t run across anyone in years who had brought that period of his life rushing back to him like this.  
  
  So smother it. Turn it around. Transform it into something else.  
  
  He stared down at Melis Nemid with cool objectivity. Yes, she was fragile and helpless-looking. Yet, if you considered the other side of the coin, that very delicateness was oddly sensual and arousing. Like holding a gossamer-thin china cup and knowing you could break it if you only tightened your hand. His gaze shifted to her face. Beautiful bone structure. A large, perfectly formed mouth that somehow increased the appearance of sensuality. A damn beautiful woman.  
  
  And this was supposed to be Lontana’s foster daughter? Lontana was in his sixties and this woman was maybe mid-twenties. Of course, it was possible. But it was just as likely that the designation was a way of avoiding questions about a May-December relationship.  
  
  It didn’t make any difference what she had been to him. The only important thing was that the relationship was long-standing and intimate enough that the woman would be able to tell him what he needed to know. If she did know, then there was no question he would make very sure she told him.  
  
  He leaned back in his chair and waited for her to wake.  
  
  Jesus, her head hurt.  
  
  Drugs? No, they’d stopped giving her drugs when she’d stopped fighting. She cautiously opened her eyes. No lacy fretwork, she realized with relief. Cool blue walls, cool as the sea. Crisp white sheet covering her. A hospital?  
  
  “You must be thirsty. Would you like some water?”  
  
  A man’s voice. It could be a doctor or nurse. . . . Her gaze flew to the man sitting in the chair next to the bed.  
  
  “Easy, I’m not offering you poison.” He smiled. “Only a glass of water.”  
  
  He wasn’t a doctor. He was wearing jeans and a linen shirt with cuffs rolled to the elbow, and he was somehow . . . familiar. “Where am I?”  
  
  “St. Catherine’s Hospital.” He held the glass to her lips as she drank. She gazed warily at him over the rim. He was dark-haired, dark-eyed, somewhere in his thirties, and wore confidence with the same casualness as he did his clothes. If she had met him before, she would definitely have remembered him.  
  
  “What happened?”  
  
  “You don’t remember?”  
  
  The ship splintering, hurling chunks of deck and metal into the air.  
  
  “Phil!” She jerked upright in bed. Phil had been in that inferno. Phil had been— She tried to swing her legs to the floor. “He was there. I have to— He went below and he was—”  
  
  “Lie down.” He was pushing her back onto the pillows. “There’s nothing you can do. The ship was destroyed over twenty-four hours ago. The coast guard hasn’t given up looking yet. If he’s alive, they’ll find him.”  
  
  Twenty-four hours. She gazed at him dazedly. “They didn’t find him?”  
  
  He shook his head. “Not yet.”  
  
  “They can’t give up. Don’t let them give up.”  
  
  “I won’t. Will you go back to sleep now? The nurses a  
re going to kick me out if they think I’ve upset you. I just thought you should know. I have an idea you’re like me. You want to know the truth even if it hurts.”  
  
  “Phil . . .” She closed her eyes as pain washed over her. “Hurts. I wish I could cry.”  
  
  “Then do it.”  
  
  “I can’t. I haven’t—I can’t ever— Go away. I don’t want anyone to see me like this.”  
  
  “But I’ve already seen you. So I think I’ll just stick around and make sure you’re going to be okay.”  
  
  She opened her eyes and studied him. Hard . . . so hard. “You don’t care if I’m okay. Who the hell are you?”  
  
  “Jed Kelby.”  
  
  That’s where she’d seen him. Newspapers, magazines, TV . . . “I should have known. The Golden Boy.”  
  
  “I used to hate that nickname and everything that went with it. It’s one of the reasons I became so damn belligerent with the media.” He smiled. “But I got over it. I’m not a boy any longer. I’m a man. And I am what I am. You might find that what I am can be very useful to you.”  
  
  “Go away.”  
  
  He hesitated and then stood up. “I’ll be back. In the meantime, I’ll try to make sure the coast guard continues to look for Lontana.”  
  
  “Thank you.”  
  
  “You’re welcome. Shall I ask the nurse to come in and give you a sedative?”  
  
  “No drugs! I don’t take—”  
  
  “Fine. Whatever you say.”  
  
  She watched the door close behind him. He had been very agreeable, some might have even said kind. She was too hazy and hurting to know what to think of him. She’d only been aware of that air of calm confidence and physical strength—and it disturbed her.  
  
  Don’t think of him.  
  
  And try not to think of Phil. Twenty-four hours was a long time, but he could still be out there.  
  
  If he’d grabbed a life vest.  
  
  If he hadn’t been blown up before he hit the water.

\-2-3 daily espresso shots.

It's been two years since owning my Opus (initially for filtered), but only six months using it for espresso, since switching espresso machine. Not unhappy with taste (maybe because I have no benchmark), but I do believe workflow could drastically improve (hello retention, even with bellows).

Got my eyes on Timemore Sculptor. First it was 064S, but motor sounds a bit wobbly. Then 078S, but I've read and heard mixed reviews about much room for improvement in taste, because of the burrs. Which leads me to 078S with SSP burrs, but now we're talking about $1100. Not the end of the world to spare a grand, but leads me to touch ground and think rational (I know, I know...).

The above pretty much sums I wouldn't spend more than $1100, therefore no Mazzer, no Zerno, no Mahlkönig for that matter. Also, not considering anything from Niche or DF.

  Not a good sign when you live alone. It can mean only one thing. I brought a hook-up back to the bungalow.  
  
  Fuck.  
  
  Fighting my eyes open against the morning light streaming into my bedroom, snapshot memories of last night begin to dance around my pounding head.  
  
  Max turned up at my office. Talked me into going out and drinking with him.  
  
  Shots. Way too many shots.  
  
  Then, two women came over to join us.  
  
  One was blonde, a natural, with long wavy hair. Petite body. She even had hazel eyes. Her face was pretty, not beautiful like Evie’s but pretty enough. Because of that, I couldn’t help myself. I had to have her. Not because she was hot—which, of course, she was—and not because I just wanted to get laid. No, it was none of those things.  
  
  I fucked the blonde because she looked exactly like Evie, my ex-wife.  
  
  I can’t believe I did it again. Jesus, I really am a sick fuck.  
  
  Trust me, what I’ve done is like an alcoholic falling off the wagon.  
  
  I don’t have a sex addiction—even though I do like sex a lot. No, I have an addiction to fucking women who look like my ex-wife.  
  
  Sick, right?  
  
  Well, I had an addiction, which apparently has kicked back into play.  
  
  Fuck!  
  
  I haven’t pulled this crap in a really long time. Up until last night, for five years—barring a slip-up three years ago—I’d successfully avoided having sex with any women who reminded me of Evie.  
  
  Three fucking years down the drain.  
  
  I’d actually thought I was cured. Guess not.  
  
  For a long time, after Evie had left me, all I did was screw random Evies. All they had to be was petite with long blonde hair, and I would let my imagination do the rest.  
  
  According to my therapist, screwing Evie’s look-alikes was my way of dealing with her abandoning me. Supposedly, I was trying to re-create the one time in my fucked-up life when I had felt truly happy—before it all went to shit.  
  
  Funny because, even though my life had sucked before Evie, ultimately, she was the sole reason it went down the path straight to hell.  
  
  I should’ve known from the moment I met her that, eventually, she’d be my downfall. I mean, I am Adam, and she’s my fucking Eve. It had been written in the cards.  
  
  My therapist said I was mourning the loss of her, like she’d died or something. Maybe if she had, it would have been easier. At least I’d have known why she’d left me.  
  
  But no, all I got—after a year together and one week of marriage—was Evie disappearing without a word.  
  
  I mean, we had been fine, happy even. Or so I’d thought. I had gone out on my one-week-late bachelor party, kissing her good-bye before leaving, and when I got home, waiting on the coffee table for me were annulment papers with her signature on the dotted line, a note beside it saying, Sorry, and her wedding ring sitting on top of it.  
  
  And that was it.  
  
  I haven’t seen or spoken to her since. That wasn’t for my lack of trying. Of course, I repeatedly rang her cell. I left her panicked, then angry, and then just plain old desperate voice mails. And I kept calling until her mailbox was full.  
  
  A few days later, her number was disconnected.  
  
  Even then, I still refused to believe she’d just left me.  
  
  So, like the sad fuck I was, I tried to find her. I hired the best PI in California to look for her.  
  
  But after a few weeks of trying, he came up dry. It was like she’d fallen off the face of the planet.  
  
  I didn’t want him to give up though. I offered him a shitload more money to keep trying, but he told me there was no point. He said the reason he couldn’t find Evie was because she didn’t want to be found.  
  
  And there it was. I had my answer.  
  
  She’d really left me.  
  
  She was gone, and I was never going to see her again.  
  
  Up until that point, I’d held things together with the hope that he’d find her, and I could bring her back home.  
  
  But that was never going to happen.  
  
  That was when I fell apart. I couldn’t breathe, like I was suffocating from the pain. It was the worst kind of agony.  
  
  I just needed to forget—forget everything, forget her.  
  
  So, the first thing I did after leaving the PI’s office was go and score some coke, which was easy enough to do in my world. I had used coke in the past, pre-Evie, for recreational use. That was the norm in my so-called privileged world.  
  
  I snorted that fucker on the spot, and a small sense of relief washed over me, but it wasn’t anywhere near enough. I was looking for total oblivion. So, I took another hit, and then I left the dealer with an eight ball in my hand to get me through the rest of the night. Next up, I went to a bar, and I started drinking with the intention of never stopping until, at the very least, I was comatose.  
  
  Unfortunately, I woke up the next morning with that same agonizing, suffocating desolate feeling.  
  
  I just wanted death to come and fucking take me.  
  
  As I came around, my skull pounding from the drugs and alcohol, I discovered that I was in bed with an unfamiliar girl beside me. But as I looked at this girl’s face, I realized she didn’t look so unfamiliar. Actually, she looked a hell of a lot like Evie. They could have been sisters, given the right lighting. Then, the girl woke up while I was staring at her. She smiled as she put her hand on my cock, and I felt a strange sense of relief.  
  
  Without another thought, I fucked her again. And it was in those first few second  
s of pushing my cock inside the nameless Evie look-alike that I didn’t feel like I was going to die.  
  
  There was nothing. I was numb, free of the pain.  
  
  And that was when I realized that screwing someone who looked like Evie would free me from the pain more than coke ever would, not that it’d stop me from snorting it in tandem with sex. They just kind of went hand in hand.  
  
  But from that moment on, I’d search out that nothingness like a sniffer dog tracking drugs.  
  
  I never slept with the same girl twice. No, because in my fucked-up brain, it felt like a betrayal against the only woman I’d ever loved—you know, the one who had left me in this fucking mess.  
  
  So, screwing these women once was fine. Twice would be a betrayal that I apparently couldn’t do.  
  
  I know. It’s fucked up.  
  
  But this was my life for the next five years.  
  
  When the pain was unbearable, which was pretty regularly, I would take some coke and go out to a bar alone. I’d stay out until I found someone who looked enough like Evie to get me through the night. I’d chat her up with sweet words and empty promises—not that it was ever hard for me to get laid. Then, I’d take her back to her place or a hotel, a pub restroom, or an alleyway—I wasn’t fussy, so long as I could fuck myself into oblivion—and I’d feel that comforting numbness that would get me through a few more days.  
  
  It was an addiction I couldn’t seem to break, not until my father died. Trust me, it wasn’t the grief that made me want to sort out my life. No, it was the glaring fact that I didn’t want to die in some shitty hotel room with coke up my nose and a faceless lay next to me in bed—like he had.  
  
  Although my lay would have been female, unlike his.  
  
  My father was men all the way, much to my mother’s dismay. That was only because she was worried about his preference for men getting out and ruining her public image.  
  
  So, when my father died, after five years of living with my coke and sex addiction, I put myself into rehab. I found out from my counselor that I didn’t actually have a sex addiction. I was addicted to having sex with women who looked like my ex-wife.  
  
  Tragic, right? Yeah, well, tragic is my middle fucking name.  
  
  Two years after rehab, I did fall off the wagon once when I thought I saw Evie.  
  
  I was in San Francisco. My studio was shooting a movie there, and they were having problems on the set. Basically, the director was threatening to walk out on the movie because the lead actress was being a mega bitch. That mega-bitch actress was my mother. So, I had to go there to handle her because no one else could.  
  
  When I was driving through the city, heading to the set, I swore to God, I saw Evie walking down the street.  
  
  By the time I pulled over and went to look for her, I saw no sign of her.  
  
  I was sure it was her.  
  
  Looking back, it was probably just another look-alike. I was always good at finding them.  
  
  Even still, I was so convinced that it was Evie that I got back in touch with my PI and had him look into it.  
  
  Yet again, he came to me a few days later with nothing.  
  
  That night, I got drunk off my ass and fucked an extra from the set who had long blonde hair and a tight ass. She looked like Evie from behind. And, yes, I kept her faced away from me the whole time I was screwing her.  
  
  Pathetic, I know.  
  
  That was when I figured it was time to get myself another therapist.  
  
  And I got a damn good one, and he helped me stay Evie-look-alike free.  
  
  Until last night.  
  
  What triggered last night’s occurrence, I have no clue.  
  
  A few days ago would have been my and Evie’s wedding anniversary, if we had made it that far. But these last three years, I’d gotten through those missed anniversaries without slipping.  
  
  So, aside from that, nothing else happened to set me off—except for a lot of alcohol, which wasn’t a rare occurrence when I went out drinking with Max. We usually got drunk and then got laid.  
  
  I’m not celibate. I did abstain for a time as part of my therapy. But that was a while ago.  
  
  Now, my goal is to just avoid having sex with Evie look-alikes.  
  
  I have tried to date in the past, but I could never get it to work. Trust is a big issue for me. Basically, I don’t trust anyone with a vagina. I think that, essentially, all women are untrustworthy cold bitches.  
  
  My therapist is still working on that one.  
  
  Apparently, that comes from mommy issues as well as my ex-wife issues.  
  
  As you can see, I’m not a good candidate for a relationship.  
  
  But I am a guy, one who works hard and likes to fuck harder. So, I still have one-night stands but just in a healthier manner. I have sex with brunettes or those with black, pink, blue, purple, or red hair. Any color goes, except for blonde. Taller chicks are better, as Evie was tiny. I avoid any temptation I can. Skin color doesn’t matter. I don’t discriminate. I screw anyone I find attractive, but for my own sanity’s sake, I avoid small blondes who remotely resemble my ex-wife.  
  
  Or should I say, I did until last night when my drunken self thought it would be a good time to fall off the wagon.  
  
  My therapist will be so proud. Guess I’m going to have to call him.  
  
  I scrub my hands over my face, letting out a long tired breath.  
  
  I’m really not looking forward to facing the look-alike, and I need to get to work. I have back-to-back meetings all day.  
  
  Grabbing my cell, I check the time. Seven thirty. Among the emails and messages filling my screen, I see a couple of texts from Max from late last night.  
  
  Just for the record, I tried to talk you out of taking the Evie look-alike home. I all but threw my brunette at you. THAT is how good of a friend I am. And it had nothing to do with the fact that the blonde told us she was a gymnast, and I wanted to screw her.  
  
  So, tell me, was she as bendy as she looked?  
  
  Fucker. Laughing, I shake my head.  
  
  Max is my oldest and best friend. We’ve known each other since high school and come from the same background. We both have crappy parents, so we jelled immediately. He knows all about my problem. Max went through the whole Evie thing with me from start to finish. There are only two people I trust in this shitty world, and Max is one of them.  
  
  I hear the shower turn off, so I quickly text him back.  
  
  Good to know that you wanted to screw someone who looked like my ex-wife, fuckface.  
  
  I get an instant response.  
  
  Hey, fucker! Good morning to you, too. And I never said I wanted to screw her because she looked like Evie. I said I wanted to screw her because she was a fucking GYMNAST!  
  
  I let out another laugh as I type a reply.  
  
  You’re a sick man, Max.  
  
  Then, I finish off the message.  
  
  And, yes, she was as bendy as she looked.  
  
  Dropping my cell on the bed, I glance longingly at the swimming pool right outside my door. I don’t even have time for my morning swim. My mornings always feel off if I haven’t been in the water. And this morning definitely feels off. Surfing would be my ideal way to start the day, but that will have to wait until the weekend, like always, when I can get to my beach house.  
  
  God, I fucking hate the corporate life.  
  
  On a sigh, I get up and pull on last night’s boxer shorts. I don’t want to have the uncomfortable morning-after conversation with the look-alike with my junk hanging out.  
  
  I’ve just covered my goods when the look-alike, whose name has evaded me, comes wandering into the bedroom, wrapped in a towel.  
  
  I inhale sharply as I see the reason why I fell off the wagon.  
  
  Fuck. She really does look like Evie.  
  
  A hell of a lot more than I expected. That, combined with last night’s consumption of alcohol, explains my current predicament.  
  
  I really went all out last night.  
  
  The look-alike smiles at me, biting the corner of her lip. Her hand is gripping the top of the towel, holding it in place.  
  
  I can’t do anything but stare at her.  
I feel like my insides are twisting in all the wrong directions, and I have the sick urge to fuck her again.  
  
  Jesus Christ.  
  
  I close my eyes to break the connection.  
  
  “Is this as awkward for you as it is for me?” she asks softly.  
  
  I open my eyes and stare over her shoulder. “Yeah.” More than you’ll ever know.  
  
  She lets out a laugh, squeaky and high-pitched. It’s nothing like Evie’s soul-touching soft laugh.  
  
  Fuck.  
  
  She needs to go—now.  
  
  “Look”—I scratch the back of my neck as I take a step toward my bathroom—“I’ve gotta jump in the shower and get ready for work. I’m running late already. You okay to let yourself out?”  
  
  “Oh…yeah, sure.”  
  
  I hear the disappointment in her voice loud and clear.  
  
  Instead of feeling like shit, I just feel relieved that she’ll be getting the hell out of here, and I can pretend that last night didn’t happen.  
  
  “Cool.” I tap a hand on the doorframe and disappear into the bathroom before she can say anything more.  
  
  Pulling my boxer shorts off, I turn the shower on hot and step inside. I put my head under the spray and close my eyes. But all I can see behind my lids is Evie’s face.  
  
  “Fuck!” I hiss, punching my fist against the tiled wall.  
  
  After ten years, I’m not over her, and I’m still pulling this same shit.  
  
  What the fuck is wrong with me?  
  
  God, I hate myself. And I hate Evie.  
  
  I hate her for living her life without me.  
  
  And I hate that I haven’t been able to live without her.  
  
  Because, really, all I have done for the last decade is exist inside the haze of my memories of her.  
  
  Half an hour later, I’m showered and dressed for work in a suit and tie. I hate ties, but as the head of Gunner Entertainment, I have to look the part.  
  
  I head into the living room of the bungalow I call home five days a week. There’s no sign of the blonde, except for the lingering strong scent of perfume.  
  
  Thank God.  
  
  I live in a rented bungalow at The Beverly Hills Hotel. I could get an apartment, but I can’t bring myself to put down roots here. Even though I grew up in Beverly Hills, it’s never felt like home.  
Home is in Malibu where my beach house is. It’s the house that Max and I rented for our year off before we headed to college. It’s the place where I met Evie and where I spent the best year of my life with her—before she left me, and my world came crashing down.  
  
  The minute I graduated from Harvard and started working for my father, I was granted access to my trust fund. The first thing I did with that money was go straight to Malibu, and I offered a stupid amount of money to the owner of the beach house. He sold it to me on the spot.  
  
  For the three years that I had been away at college, I had kept up with the rent on the beach house. I didn’t go back there in all that time, but I couldn’t let it go either. I couldn’t bear the thought of anyone else being in the place that was hers and mine.  
  
  The first time I went back inside the house was torture. She was everywhere, in every room.  
  
  But no matter how much it hurt, I needed to be there. I needed to be close to her in the only way I could be.  
  
  I probably should sell it now, and buy a new house, as I know it isn’t healthy to hang on to the place. But it’s the only thing I have left of her, and I just can’t bring myself to let it go.  
  
  During the week, I’m forced to be in Beverly Hills because Gunner Entertainment is here. It’s my family’s studio that my great-grandfather started in the early days of making movies. When my grandfather took it over after his father had passed, he turned it into one of the biggest movie studios in Hollywood. After my grandfather passed, my piece-of-shit father, Eric, took over, and during his last few years, he almost ran the studio into the ground. He was too busy screwing any guy he could, pretending to me and the rest of the world that he wasn’t gay. All the while, taking the drugs, which eventually killed him.  
  
  And wasn’t I just my father’s son? Aside from fucking dudes, that is. I took on his form down to the letter.  
  
  It was always set that I would take over the family business. Didn’t matter that I didn’t want to. I never wanted anything to do with it. I hate the movie business.  
  
  My mother, Ava, is a self-righteous bitch of an actress. My father married her to get his heir to the business. And she was a beautiful up-and-coming actress, ruthless enough to marry a gay man and give him the son he needed.  
  
  In return, she got to star in every big blockbuster he could give her. He made her famous, just as he’d promised. She’s one of the biggest names in Hollywood.  
  
  I was just the transaction which gave them both what they wanted.  
  
  Ava was never around when I was growing up. She was usually filming on set somewhere, and even when she was home, I rarely saw her.  
  
  She didn’t give a shit about me. Still doesn’t.  
  
  My life was lonely back then. The only person I had in the world was Max.  
  
  Until I met Evie. And for the first time in my life, I felt wanted and loved by someone.  
  
  And, God, did I love her. Evie was everything to me.  
  
  She gave me the reason and strength to tell Ava and Eric to shove the studio up their asses. I walked away from it all to be with her.  
  
  I married her, and then a week later, she was gone.  
  
  I haven’t seen her since.  
  
  After she left, I was adrift. So, I grabbed ahold of the only thing I knew. I went back to the family business. I fell right back in with the sharks, and I’ve been swimming with them ever since.  
  
  Grabbing my keys off the side table, I let myself out and start the short walk to the hotel’s coffee shop to get my morning coffee.  
  
  Making my way through the hotel, I exchange pleasantries with the staff on duty. When I reach the coffee shop, I push open the door and step straight into the past.  
  
  Evie.  
  
  She’s standing behind the counter. Her face is turned slightly to the right, her attention on the TV mounted on the wall, and her hair is pulled back into a ponytail.  
  
  But it’s her.  
  
  I feel like a speeding train has hit me, and I’m pretty sure my heart has stopped beating.  
  
  It’s really her.  
  
  She’s here.  
  
  “Evie?” I breathe out her name, like I’m taking my first real breath in a very long time.  
  
  Her body stiffens at the sound of my voice. And I watch as her face turns my way. Those big whiskey-colored eyes that I fell in love with all those years ago meet mine, and my world stands still.  
  
  She looks exactly the same.  
  
  How is that even possible?  
  
  Maybe it’s not. Maybe I’m hallucinating. I mean, falling off the wagon with that chick might have tipped me over the edge, and now, I’ve finally boarded my very own train to crazy town.  
  
  I don’t know how much time has passed while we’ve been standing here, staring at one another. My hand is still holding the door open, my foot a step into the past, and my fingers are gripping the wood so tightly that I’m surprised I haven’t ripped a chunk out.  
  
  Then, her eyes shut down on me, and she looks away. It feels like she’s ripping my heart out all over again, and a rage I didn’t know possible floods my body and mind. And it’s all channeled in one direction—her.  
  
  I need to get out of here before I tear her and this place apart.  
  
  Turning, I step back and pull the door with me, slamming it so hard that the shop front rattles. I’m surprised I didn’t smash the windows.  
  
  I get about ten steps away before my blinding anger takes over and turns me back around, marching me straight back there.  
  
  The lobby is empty, which is a good thing because I probably look like an insane person right now—not that I actually give a fuck about what people think of me.  
  
  I yank the door open and stride through, banging it shut with as much force as I did the first time.  
  
  Evie’s big brown eyes are straight on me, wide and afraid.  
  
  Seeing her afraid like this should pull me back a step, but it doesn’t. At this moment, I don’t think a fucking dump truck could stop me.  
  
  I reach the counter and slam my hands down on the metal surface. Leaning forward, I stare at her with cold eyes.  
  
  “Why?” I say low, my voice hard.  
  
  “Wh-why, what?” Her tentative voice shakes, almost like she’s afraid to ask the question.  
  
  She should be afraid.  
  
  I stare down at the counter and take several deep breaths in and out, trying to control my rage. I can barely hear with the blood pounding in my ears.  
  
  One of my hands curls into a fist as I lift my eyes back to hers. “Why. Did. You. Fucking. Leave. Me?” I harshly bite each word out.  
  
  I want her to feel the pain in my words. I want her to feel every second of agony I’ve felt since she tore my heart out and shredded it to pieces.  
  
  Her lower lip trembles. She wraps her arm over her stomach and takes a small step back, away from my anger.  
  
  In all the time I knew Evie, I never really yelled at her—well, not like this anyway. And I never wanted to have to, but this is what she has reduced me to…reduced us to.  
  
  We’re two almost strangers with a world of hurt sitting between us.  
  
  Her eyes sweep the floor. “I-I can’t…”  
  
  She lifts them back to mine. I can see anguish and indecision in them.  
  
  “I…don’t know what to say.”  
  
  My chest is pounding so heavily that air is gusting out of me. “You don’t know what to say?” I yell, punching my fist on the counter. “How about the truth? How about telling me why you upped and disappeared on me a fucking week after we got married?”  
  
  Her eyes go to the wall over my shoulder. I see a shine of tears in them. It makes me ache for her, and that just pisses me off further. What right does she have to cry?  
  
  “I-I’m sorry,” she whispers.  
  
  I erupt again. “I don’t want your fucking apologies!” Well, I kind of do, but I want an explanation more. I want to know why she destroyed us…destroyed me.  
  
  I take a deep breath and try to even out my voice as I say, “I just want the truth, Evie. I just want to know why you left.”  
  
  Her eyes flicke  
r to the window, looking at the people passing by. “Please, Adam,” she beseeches. “It’s my first day here, and I need this job. Can we talk later?”  
  
  My head nearly explodes. I half-expect to see my brain splattered all over this counter. “Are you fucking kidding me? No, we can’t fucking talk later! Ten years, Evie! Ten fucking years! You owe me an explanation, and I’m going nowhere until I get it.”  
  
  The door to the café opens, the sound yanking my eyes away from Evie. I don’t want any interruptions right now.  
  
  A seriously overweight middle-aged guy stands just in the doorway. I don’t recognize him. Must be a guest at the hotel.  
  
  He looks between Evie and me as the door shuts behind him. His brow furrows, and concern flitters over his face.  
  
  We can’t look like a picture of heaven right now. More like the very definition of hell.  
  
  Evie looks like she’s about to burst into tears, and I’m pretty sure my face is bright red from the rage burning up my skin. My hands are now curled around the edge of the counter, and I’m leaning forward over it, invading Evie’s space.  
  
  Ignoring the guy, I stare back at Evie. “Answers, Evie. Now.”  
  
  “Is…everything okay here?” Fatty asks.  
  
  Letting out a pissed off sigh, I swing murderous eyes his way. “Things are just fucking peachy.”  
  
  Then, out of nowhere, I feel her hand on my arm.  
  
  The touch sends me reeling, searing into my skin, heating me right through to my bones. I haven’t felt this way since…since the last time I felt her touch.  
  
  “Adam, I know I owe you my time. But, please, can we talk later?” Her voice is soft.  
  
  And I’m reminded of all the times when we used to lie in bed after making love, and we’d talk about nothing for hours. Her voice was always so soft, so sweet, in the darkness.  
  
  “I have my lunch break at one, or I get off at five. Whichever works best for you, I can do. But just not right now. Please.”  
  
  My eyes move down to her hand. I need her skin off of mine, yet I need her to never let go again.  
  
  She removes her hand from my arm.  
  
  The instant her touch is gone, I feel cold. And the iciness seeps straight back into my ruined black heart.  
  
  I watch as her fingers curl into her palm, like I just burned her skin.  
  
  I lift my eyes, boring straight into hers.  
  
  “Five. I’ll come back here.” Releasing my grip on the counter, I step back and stride toward the door, passing Fatty as I go.  
  
  I yank the door open and then stop before passing through. I turn back to Evie to find Fatty already at the counter. Guy sure can move fast.  
  
  My eyes meet with hers, and I pin her with my stare. “Five o’clock, Evie, and you’d better be here. Otherwise, I will come looking for you, and you can bet your fucking ass that, this time, I will find you.”  
  
  Then, I get the hell out of there and slam the door on my past.  
  
  She’s here again—rock girl. She’s sitting up on that same big rock, a hundred yards away from my beach house, where she sits every day. Hence, the nickname, Rock Girl.  
  
  God, I’m lame.  
  
  With her sketchpad resting against her bent knees, her eyes are fixed on the paper like her life depends on it while her hand freely moves the pencil over the paper, drawing…I have no clue.  
  
  I wish I did.  
  
  I mean, I could take a wild guess and say she’s drawing the scenery—the pier, beach, sand, sky. There’s plenty of shit like that here in Malibu. But still, I want to know exactly what she’s drawing that has her so enraptured.  
  
  Like, I really want to know.  
  
  I’ve been watching Rock Girl for a week now.  
  
  I saw her on the first day when Max and I arrived at the beach house, which will be my home for the next year. This will be my year of freedom before I have to go to Harvard, and then once I graduate, it is on to work for my father to learn the family business.  
  
  Can’t wait. I have to stop myself from rolling my eyes.  
  
  Until then, I’m here to surf my ass off—and apparently stalk cute blonde artists.  
  
  Every day, at least for the last seven days, at just a little after five p.m., Rock Girl walks along the beach, passing by my house, with a bag on her shoulder, usually wearing a pair of ass-hugging jean shorts and a red tank, which shows off her perfectly formed tits. They’re not too big or too small, just the right size to fit my hands, I imagine. And from what I’ve seen, they look to be real—meaning, when I watch her climbing up the rock, they jiggle about.  
  
  I can’t remember the last time I saw a hot girl with a real pair of tits, not in the silicone world I’ve been raised in. Everything in my world is fake, even the people, especially the people.  
  
  On Rock Girl’s shirt is a logo, covering the left breast, that I can’t quite make out. And trust me, I’ve tried. I’ve nearly gone blind, staring at that fucker, trying to work it out—not that staring at her tits is exactly a hardship.  
  
  I’m assuming her clothing is her work outfit. Either that, or she has a really limited wardrobe, not that I’m complaining because her body looks smoking hot in those threads.  
  
  She keeps her long blonde hair, which I would really like to get my hands all tangled up in, tied back into a ponytail.  
  
  When she reaches the top of the rock, she sits down and pulls a sketchpad and pencil out of her bag. Then, she spends the next hour drawing. At just a little after six, she packs her things back into her bag, climbs down the rock, and leaves the way she came.  
  
  And I watch her.  
  
  Every day.  
  
  It’s not creepy at all.  
  
  Okay, maybe it’s a little creepy.  
  
  But I just can’t help myself. There’s something about her, something that has captured my attention in a way no one ever has before. And it isn’t just her sexy tan legs, great rack, or tight ass—even though those are amazing.  
  
  There’s just something…captivating about her.  
  
  I don’t know if it’s the way she seems to put all of herself into her art the moment she presses that pencil to the paper or the way she looks so totally free while sitting up on that rock with the wind blowing through her hair, like nothing or no one can touch her.  
  
  For that hour, she’s free.  
  
  But when she steps down off that rock, I can see a heaviness falling down on her, like a cloud of responsibility.  
  
  And I know what that feels like.  
  
  When I’m out on my board, riding the waves, nothing can touch me.  
  
  But the minute I’m back on shore, that momentary freedom I felt is gone.  
  
  Sure, I have freedom in the sense that my parents haven’t given a fuck about me since the second I was born. So long as I don’t bring disrepute to the Gunner name, tarnishing their smoke-and-mirrors lifestyle, then I can pretty much do whatever the hell I want.  
  
  But there has always been an expectation of me.  
  
  I’m the heir to Gunner Entertainment, the oldest and largest movie studio in Hollywood.  
  
  After this year off—that my parents graciously granted me after I’d threatened to do some seriously crazy stuff if they didn’t give it to me—I’m expected to go to Harvard and graduate with honors. Then, I’m to take my place at my father’s side until the day I take over and become the King of Hollywood.  
  
  Sounds like a dream to most. To me, it’s a fucking nightmare.  
  
  I despise everything about it and what it represents.  
  
  The glitz and glamour cover the lies and deceit. My world is filled with frauds, each one with a dirty little secret to hide.  
  
  Soon, I have to become one of them, and when I do, I fear that I’ll turn into someone I’ve never wanted to become—my father…or worse, my mother. She’s a fame-hungry, soul-sucking bitch who cares about no one, except for herself.  
  
  I paint a nice picture, right?  
  
  Well, call me a cynic, but growing up with the parents I have, you’d be one, too.  
  
  I don’t want any part of the life they’re forcing me to have.  
  
  All I want is to become a pro surfe  
r. It’s all I’ve ever wanted. I just want to be in the ocean, chasing that never-ending wave.  
  
  When I was fourteen, I tried telling Ava that I didn’t want to take over the family business, that I wanted to become a professional surfer. She laughed in my face and then reminded me exactly what would happen if I did.  
  
  They’d cut me off cold. I would have nothing.  
  
  And believe me when I say, they would leave me penniless, living on the streets, and they would do it without losing a second of sleep.  
  
  Especially Ava. She is as hard as the Botox filling her face.  
  
  I wish I were brave enough to go it alone. The problem with being brought up with unlimited funds would be to have to live without it. And I don’t know if I could do that.  
  
  So, for now, I’m my parents’ bitch.  
  
  Although I might be their bitch and screwed up in more ways than I can begin to explain, I’m not a fucking weirdo. I don’t usually hang out on my balcony, watching chicks, like some creeper.  
  
  I’m not exactly the shy type. I’m confident—probably too confident sometimes—and when I want a girl, I tell her. I don’t hide in my house, afraid to approach her.  
  
  And I’m not an asshole—well, not all the time—but I am aware of how I look. When your mother is one of the most beautiful women in the world—even if she is a demon from hell—you stand a damn good chance of scoring lucky in the gene pool.  
  
  And I scored well.  
  
  At six-three, with an athletic body that I’ve gained from all my years of surfing and swimming, I keep the scruff on my face overgrown and my sun-bleached hair longer.  
  
  I have no problem at all with getting chicks. It’s getting rid of them that is usually the issue.  
  
  But for some reason, I can’t seem to get my ass off this balcony to go over there and talk to Rock Girl.  
  
  I’m seriously starting to worry about myself.  
  
  For fuck’s sake, Gunner. Just go down there and talk to her. What have you got to lose?  
  
  “Hey, fuckface. You still watching that chick?”  
  
  Releasing a sigh, I turn to look over my shoulder at Max. “I’m not watching her. I’m…looking at the scenery.” I gesture weakly with my hand.  
  
  Max snorts out a laugh. “Sure you are, limp dick.",1,1756859402.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

I don't see this happening with this new girl and it sucks, because I do like her, but I'm not sure it will work. I hate the word 'needy' but yes, I want to see my girl a bit more, have impromptu dates, coffee, apps, etc.. sneak away for fun sexy time, etc...

1n70fua,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEMrush/comments/1n70fua/local_proximity_vs_relevance_how_google_local/,Local Proximity vs. Relevance: How Google Local Algorithm Really Works,"Google’s Local Pack ranks on three levers: **relevance**, **distance (proximity)**, and **prominence**. 

Relevance comes from your **primary category** and **landing page** match; distance is the searcher-to-business gap; prominence is **reviews/authority**. Proximity is loud for generic nearby queries, but a perfect category match plus strong reviews can outrun distance.

https://preview.redd.it/d0oihctegumf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b8566e722dba34d29cf716183bbdea2c04468c

# The Three Levers: Relevance, Distance, Prominence

**Relevance (your fast switch).** Set the **right primary category** and make the **GBP landing page** talk about the exact service. That pairing fuels “**website mentions**” justifications and improves query fit. Keep secondary categories tight. 

**Distance / Proximity (device-to-business math).** The closer the searcher, the more this lever shouts, especially on broad intent (“plumber,” “coffee”). You can’t edit distance, but you can measure it with a fixed-zoom **geo-grid** and plot **distance decay** to separate reality from anecdotes.

**Prominence (compounding signals).** Reviews (**count**, **velocity**, **recency**) and real-world authority drive this. Build **hyperlocal links** into the GBP landing page to stack authority where Google looks.

https://preview.redd.it/5d7y5kbhgumf1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccccd6dd47198b7631dcb30f4227204c6440b7d4

# Proximity vs. Relevance: Which Wins (and When)

|Factor|What it is|When it overrides|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Proximity|Searcher-to-business distance|Generic intents close to the searcher/centroid|
|Relevance|Category + landing-page query match|Exact service/category match (tight content, right primary category)|
|Prominence|Reviews/authority (brand, links)|Branded or high-authority players with fresh, frequent reviews|

At equal prominence, proximity wins generic nearby queries. As the category/intent match sharpens and reviews compound, relevance can outrun distance for specific queries.

# Ranking Drop - or Filtered? How to Tell (Possum/Hawk)

**Filtered.** Same address or same category neighbors can **suppress** a listing at certain zooms; that isn’t a “rank drop,” it’s the **proximity filter** at work.

**What to check quickly:**

* Another listing in your **category** at the **same address/building**? Expect suppression in the pack view.
* Visibility returns when you zoom/scroll the map? That’s the filter, not a ranking loss.

# What Google “Vicinity” Update Changed (Nov-Dec 2021)

* **Distance got louder.** Vicinity squeezed the visible radius; pack views became more zoom-in biased.
* **Keyword-in-name lost some juice** and carries **suspension risk** if you stuff beyond your real-world name. Don’t do it.

**Safer plays:** lock the **primary category**, align the **landing page** to the query, and build consistent review **velocity** instead of flirting with name spam.

https://preview.redd.it/4clgxwfkgumf1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3eda7433c0eeffb94f6af3cca6657a8156fa936

# Service Areas Don’t Extend Ranking Radius (SAB Reality)

**Service areas** describe where you serve; they **don’t override distance** for ranking. Your **address** still anchors proximity. If you think you’re the exception, run a grid test and prove it.

**Caveat:** You’ll see edge anecdotes, but repeated tests across days/zooms usually flatten them out. Measure, don’t vibe.

# Prominence You Control

* **Review cadence:** aim for **steady velocity** and **fresh recency**; avoid gating or incentivizing.
* **Hyperlocal links:** get neighborhood/org links into the **GBP landing page** that ranks for your category.
* **Citations:** keep NAP clean and consistent; more ≠ better once baselines are met.
* **Name hygiene:** don’t stuff keywords into your **business name**, Google flags it and suspends profiles.

# Field Notes (for the cynics who want receipts)

* Google still names **relevance, distance, prominence** as the core trio.
* **Vicinity** increased proximity weight and reduced keyword-in-name impact.
* **Possum/Hawk** explain a lot of “we vanished overnight” cases: it’s **filtering**, not ranking.
* **Service areas** don’t expand rank radius in controlled tests.
* **“Open now”** can move needles in some categories. Test, don’t game it.

Lately I’ve been thinking about how they’ve followed me from childhood into adulthood, and I wanted to share in case anyone else has gone through something similar.

When I was little, my mom would casually play with a Ouija board. Not long after, I developed an “imaginary friend.” At least, that’s what everyone called it. To me, it felt different—like something was really there.

In the next house we moved into, things started happening that I still can’t explain. I remember waking up around 3 AM and seeing the porcelain dolls on my shelf… their heads slowly turning on their own. In that same house, a friend and I were playing Guitar Hero one night while we were home alone. From where we stood, we could see straight into the kitchen. Suddenly, every cabinet door began swinging open and slamming shut violently. The sound filled the whole house. We just stood there, terrified, because there was no one else there.

For a while, things went quiet. But when I was 23, it all came back. I had moved into a house with my boyfriend and daughter. My boyfriend was away at basic training, my daughter was staying with her father, and I was alone in the house. One night, I watched my phone lift off the bathroom counter and fly across the room. Another night, a hairbrush shot off the coffee table and came straight at me.

It didn’t stop with me. My daughter would talk about seeing a woman in a white nightgown wandering the house. And the voices… those were the worst. I’d hear my boyfriend calling my name when he wasn’t home. Sometimes I’d hear my daughter’s voice calling, “Momma,” when she wasn’t even there.

I don’t know what this is, or why it keeps following me. All I know is that it started when I was a child—and it hasn’t let me go.

Has anyone else experienced something that seems to attach itself to you and follow you through different homes and stages of life? I’d really love to hear your thoughts.

Here's what I remember about it:

* It was definitely going for an 80s pop sort of aesthetic, but the production sounded too modern for it to be actually released in the 80s. I'd therefore estimate it was released sometime in the last 15 years.
* The vocalist was a female.
* The vocal melody reminded me vaguely of ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"" by The Smiths.
* \[For the music theory dorks in the audience\] The song was in a major key, but spent some time in the major key's minor chords. (So, if we assume that the song was in C major (I don't have perfect pitch), imagine that C major is home base, but we pass through some A minor chords before we reach home again.)
* The only lyric I can remember sounded like ""sleep tonight."" But everything I've searched on Google with the line ""sleep tonight"" is a completely different song. I believe those words (or something like them) occurred at the beginning of the second line of each chorus - so it wasn't the main lyrical hook or anything. 
* It was playing in an Einstein's Bagels, so it wasn't anything totally bombastic. Imagine music you'd play to keep people cheerful at 6:30 AM, but without overstimulating them before they've had their coffee. ;)

My Girlfriend(let’s call her Sarah) and I have been living together for a good 3 weeks now and we agreed together that it would be nice to have her friend stay with us (let’s call her Maddie). Maddie is from out of state and wanted to stay for a little over 5 days. Sarah and I have a small meeting me bedroom condo that’s about 1200 sq ft. We have a pull out couch in the living room that we planned to have her friend sleep on during her stay. At first it was nice and Sarah and I had everything set up and cleaned for Maddie. I noticed after the first day that Maddie had this habit of leaving her stuff everywhere. We had a coffee table and a side table for her to use as well. I would wake up and she would have all of her bathroom stuff including her toothbrush and retainers(in case) spread out on the kitchen counter. There would be shopping bags of small trash littered around. I didn’t pay much attention to it until I noticed our cat getting into the stuff on the counter and then her placing the second skin from her tattoo on the shower windowsill and leaving it there. 

Another issue was the smoking. Sarah and I dislike the smell of smoke but chose to say nothing when she went outside the first night. Then it became smoking constantly to the point I would wake up for work at 7AM and her friend Maddie coming in the house smelling strongly of cigarette. The last straw for my partner and I with it was when Maddie went outside front to smoke and the smell somehow got in our air ducts and the whole house smelled like it. Maddie did make a “joke” before she left us that when we go stay with her that I need to let her clean up after me because she felt bad. 

After Maddie left I mentioned all of this to Sarah and how it frustrated me a lot the past day. Sarah said she noticed and that she can understand but things we should prepare more next time someone stays with us. I agreed with her and left it at that but worry that I was an ass and she won’t want her other friend to meet me. ",1,1756858486.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone!
I recently launched a project I’ve been working on for months — an AI calorie & nutrition tracker inside Telegram.

The idea: instead of using clunky apps where you have to weigh every gram and log everything manually, you just text or send a photo/voice message to the bot, and it automatically tracks your calories, protein, fats, and carbs.

What it can do right now:

📝 Text input: write “oatmeal 200g” or “chicken with rice” and it logs it.

📸 Photo recognition: send a picture of your meal, it analyzes and estimates macros.

🎙️ Voice input: say “I had 2 bananas and coffee with milk” and it works.

📊 Progress: track daily calories and macros, get simple reports.

⏰ Fasting reminders & gamification (streaks, achievements, points).
    
Barcode scanning for products 🛒

Weekly/monthly progress graphs 📈

Personalization (different goals: fat loss, bulking, recomposition, maintenance)

👉 I’d love to hear your thoughts:

- What features would make you actually use such a bot every day?
- What annoys you most in other calorie apps that I should avoid here?

Fake names and fake ages are used. Copy and Pasted from my own AITA post, because it was removed. 

 Hello two hot takes family ! Forgive me for my mistakes, this is my first ever Reddit post. I (27f) work for a coffee shop, and transferred stores recently to a major city. My new manager,  Amber(early 30s f), recently has been spending time with one of our regulars, Mason (early 30s m). 

It started out pretty friendly. They would chat for 15 minutes, then he would go about his day and she would return to work. But as of three weeks ago, he has been staying for an increasing amount of time every day. He became less chatty with the rest of the staff, only wanting to talk to Amber. A week ago, he called the store, and Amber grabbed the phone out of my hand and answered, saying she was sorry for not getting back to him and answering his texts. Yesterday, he sat in on a private conversation between me and Amber about a work related issue involving my private information. He sat at the table with her for my entire 6 hour shift. I’ve watched them play footsies with each other, he has kissed her on the forehead, and he has picked her up from work multiple times. 

And it’s not just me who has noticed. Me and multiple coworkers have had many conversations about how Mason and Ambers relationship is very flirtatious, and how Masons presence in private conversations makes us uncomfortable. 

The nail in the coffin? She’s been married 5+ years. The whole store knows her husband, and he’s come in multiple times, as recently as two weeks ago. This morning, my boss was not scheduled and we spotted Mason walking outside of the store. Not even two minutes later, Amber’s car pulled up and picked him up. 

We as a staff don’t know what to do or how to approach this situation. We have brought up amongst ourselves going to the district manager, but all things considered, she is a fine person and none of us want her to get fired.

Ever feel like personal development is this giant, overwhelming mountain to climb? You see people talking about 5 AM cold plunges, meditating for an hour, and overhauling their entire diet in one day. It’s exhausting just *thinking* about it.

But what if optimizing your life wasn't about massive, painful changes? What if it was about tiny, almost **effortless** tweaks?

The real magic isn't in the giant leap; it's in the small, consistent step. It's about making things so easy that you can't say no. This is how you build momentum that leads to **BIG** growth and genuine happiness without the burnout.

Think about trying just one of these for a week:

*   **The ""One Thing"" Rule:** Before you get out of bed, think of ONE thing you're genuinely looking forward to that day. It can be as simple as your morning coffee. This primes your brain for positivity.
*   **The ""Future You"" Favor:** The night before, do one tiny thing to help your future self. Lay out your work clothes. Put a glass of water on your nightstand. Tidy just your desk. It’s a 2-minute gift to yourself.
*   **The ""Commercial Break"" Reset:** During a commercial, a loading screen, or while waiting for the microwave, stand up and stretch. Just reach for the ceiling. It breaks up sedentary time and resets your posture.

These aren't life-shattering on their own. But when you do them day after day, they start to compound. You're not just tidying a desk; you're building a habit of organization. You're not just stretching; you're building a habit of being mindful of your body. You prove to yourself, ""Hey, I *can* do this."" ✨

I get it, though. Sometimes the *real* barrier isn't the action itself, but the emotional fog that makes even the smallest task feel impossible. If you feel like your inner state is what's really holding you back, getting a clear, structured plan to navigate those feelings can be a game-changer. I personally found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to be incredibly helpful for creating that emotional clarity.

It all starts small. You don't have to climb the whole mountain today. Just take one tiny step.

So, what's one small tweak you've made in your life that had a surprisingly massive impact? Let's share some ideas. 🚀",1,1756858077.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I (M/28) started dating this girl (F/23) who I’ve been working with for nearly a year. We work in different departments. Honestly, I liked her from the first time I saw her. But she had a boyfriend back then, so we were just colleagues. Around 8 months ago, they broke up.

About 3 months ago, we started texting each other (at first it was only about work, since we’re responsible for each other’s tasks, so we were just checking things). Then we began talking about our days. Around 1.5 months ago, I invited her out for coffee. It wasn’t exactly a date, I just wanted to get to know her better.

In the last 2 weeks, we started flirting. Things happened faster than I expected. We haven’t had sex, but we sleep together, kiss, and have some foreplay. We’re still trying to get to know each other, asking questions, hanging out, etc. When I asked her opinion about spicy photos (especially during work), she said she would be happy to send or receive them.

Two days ago, she said she was going out with her friends to do some “bitching” (I don’t know how to translate this, but she meant something like “I’m off to sell myself out”). Then I asked her, “What about being my bitch?” Suddenly she got angry and said I was assuming she was a whore, and that I shouldn’t say that. She told me she was just going out with friends to hang out, not to look for sex. Of course, I apologized for misunderstood and explained that I really didn’t mean it that way. She didn’t reply to my texts, so I called her a couple of times until she finally answered. We talked for about 2 minutes, she just said, “Okay, whatever, I must go.” I wished her a good time and ended the call. Five minutes later, she called me back and said, “I just wanted to check on you. I’m really okay, we’re okay, don’t worry.” Honestly, I was happy she called me back.

Everything was fine until today. We went out again, and everything was perfect. Tonight I’m working the night shift. I dropped her off at her house, kissed her, wished her good night, and left to work. About an hour later, I saw a spicy conversation online and wanted to try it with her. Basically, it was like:

I want to see you in the clothes I gave you.
Which one? You didn’t give me anything.
Exactly ;)


Surprisingly, she said she would never send nudes to her future husband. I told her, “But you said you’re okay with sending spicy photos,” and I was surprised. Then she got angry again and said I assumed she sends nudes to everyone, but she isn’t that kind of person. She told me I should find someone else who likes sending nudes and that I’d be happier with her. I tried to explain myself, but she just wished me good night and told me not to text her again tonight. She also didn’t want me to call her in the morning (normally, when I work night shifts, I wake her up). I wanted to call her, but she said if I tried, she would turn off her phone. Then she wished me good night and said, “See you later.”

Honestly, it broke my heart. Frankly, I think I already know the answer, but sometimes you just need to hear it from someone else.

All my levels were fine except my testosterone was super low. My total was 19 and free was 0.1. They inserted 125mg of just testosterone. The first week I noticed I just felt bleh. Not happy or sad, just disconnected. Was waiting for weeks for the libido,energy and all the benefits but nothing. Then I started feeling anxious and was having panic attacks which was scary for me especially while driving. Also the acne, chin hair, swollen clit and water retention sucked. 

I waited till after my 4 week blood work before I called my DR to talk about how I was feeling. My testosterone read total at 193 and free 18.1. They said I'm at optimal level (even though they said they would gradually raise it) and that my anxiety isn't from the pellet and I should talk to my PCP about anxiety meds. No other advice or solution. I did my own research and was advised by another HRT specialist to take a dht blocker. So I started taking saw palmetto and quit drinking coffee or any stimulants. My anxiety/ panic attacks subsided. Btw I don't have a history of anxiety. It wasn't just about the anxiety, don't get me wrong that was my main focus at that moment. But I was looking forward to having my energy back, libido etc etc.

This may be something reflective of our society too.  People are more casual, standards are different, and there are generational differences, but I'm curious if anyone has ever experienced this.

I got inspired while driving home from work and listening to one of my favorite artists/songs, STORY by NF. 
I saw his music video a while ago and while I liked it, I think there's a lot of potential and I haven't really seen any artist turn it into an animation.
I'm not sure if that's because NF declined to let artists use it for animations or not, but for my own enjoyment and because I am now obsessed, I've decided that I'm no longer a traditional sketcher.. 
Today, I'm a digital animator and I'm working on the background for the very first opening scene! 
Unless I get permission from NF to use his song I'll probably never post this anywhere or use it for anything other than to have a visual representation of his song from my pov, which is unfortunate but I also really respect him and wouldn't want to infringe on any of his rights.
Looking really cool though! 
Trying out a few different artstyles...
I want to make it bold, rough, maybe a little in-your-face with the over-the-top animating I'll be doing ina week or so, but it's gonna be like the movement of Bad Guys (animated) with the flair of spider verse. 
That's me being veryyyy confident in my nonexistent digital art skills...

1n6zl4d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6zl4d,For You Avid Readers....,"As someone who's owned 4 generations of the Fold series phones starting at the very 1st, I've realized I take for granted many of the things I've learned about things this phone can do over those 7 years. 

This one in particular is for those of us that like to read books, novels, etc.  

If you're anything like me, reading from your phone just isn't quite the same as a book. This can be due to various reasons, but I've found you can make the Fold pretty damned close to a book.  

First, get a nice e-reader like Moon Reader.  The good ones allow you to use custom backgrounds as your ""paper"".  Second, you're able to change the font itself to suit your style (or even the style of the book you're reading).  Third, you can either read completely left to right across the screen, but if you REALLY want the book experience, you can set the reading app the ""dual page"" and use a background that has a spine valley down the middle, close your phone about 25°, and there you have it.  Looks like a book, you hold it like a book....sorry, but it doesn't smell like a book (yet?).  

Hopefully this will help someone who enjoys reading.  I've included a few images to show two different ""page"" type backgrounds and the two different styles (left to right and dual page/book style)

As we all prepare for the fall season, and the accompanying 4pm darkness and wind chill, I am asking for fall activity recommendations to keep the spirits high. Normally, I see posts for activities like ""walk around some neighborhood"", ""hike around some park"", or ""bar crawl in some district"". While, these are great they don't necessarily apply to people who are interested in more indoor activities or specific things to see and do. [I read this post asking the same question](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1dj8sq8/things_to_do_in_boston_during_the_fall/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), and I didn't see a lot of promising ideas. Can you give some affordable, MBTA accessible, and generally fun/unique events or places to go, regardless of the weather?

  
Here are some things I like to do, can you provide more ideas or itineraries? 

* Commuter rail from North Station to Salem for the Haunted Happenings. We tend to try a haunted house, visit stores, eat at a restaurant, and get apple cider donuts. A bit generic, but are there other things to try in Salem? 
* Harvard Square Ocktoberfest 
* Walk around Beacon Hill - cute, but like cute one time and then you're over it. 
* Whale watching 
* Apple Picking - somewhat inaccessible without a car 

  
Halloween events??

* I've gone to the [ICA Halloween Event](https://www.icaboston.org/events/ica-halloween-black-white-ball/) \- it was very expensive, with no drinks included or food. Also very crowded with bad music. Not the best vibes tbh. 
* [Liberty Hotel Halloween Party ](https://www.showclix.com/event/liberty-hotel-beetlejuice-halloween-party)\- I considered going to this but it's $95 usually with no food or drinks included? Doesn't *seem* worth it. 
* Harvard Museum at Night- College student oriented, and not much to do beyond walk around the museum 
* Alamo Drafthouse for movies - I like this, although...Seaport. So, Boston AMC for fall themed or horror movies.

Your city has absolutely blown me away. What an amazing city, what amazing food, what an amazing mix of cultures, and what a wide range of activities to do - just wow.

Coming from Scandinavia, I was asked by a young local boy one evening:  
*""Is it true that your country is the most perfect place to live, with the happiest population on earth?""*  
The best answer I could give him was this: while I do know I am on vacation and not living everyday life here in Sarajevo, I believe that in many ways you are living in a better place than I am.

The amazing food - pretty much just living off the very affordable pekara (bakeries) every day.   
The views of the city when getting a bit higher up in altitude.  
The social life - people meeting for shisha or a Bosnian coffee at a very affordable price (3.5 BAM per coffee compared to 11 BAM per cappuccino where I’m from which is killing social life).  
The hospitality and the high level of English of the people.  
The possibility of going out partying like I have never experienced before in any European city (the Sarajevo Film Festival probably boosted this a bit).  
The blend of cultures and architecture - hearing the prayer from the mosque simultaneously with the church bells gave me goosebumps.  
The short hourly drives with a rental car to easily experience other parts/cities of Bosnia, see the amazing waterfalls and rivers like the Vrbas, or simply just hike down from the old Olympic bobsleigh tracks back into the city (these places should be filled with tourists by the beauty of it, but luckily I had them pretty much to myself).

Man, I could go on, but please know this: no matter what economic or political frustrations you may endure or complain about - which I perfectly understand if you do - when comparing with the very complex and, in my eyes, messed-up political systems Bosnia is currently being ruled over… just know that the grass is not greener on the other side. In fact, I don’t believe I have ever seen the color green more profoundly than I have in Bosnia.

I ended up with 500+ pictures on my iPhone after two weeks, and normally I take only 1–2 pictures per holiday for perspective. Go to Germany and you may find a bit more money in salary along with depression, and the same goes if you go to Scandinavia. Stay and enjoy your home in Sarajevo, because it is nothing like I have ever visited, I could see myself spending months there every year as I get older.

1n6zb1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1n6zb1t/my_experience_wocs_2025/,My experience: WOCS 2025,"
I wanted to provide something that reflects a more current review of WOCs, sometime in the 2025/26 season. Names, dates, and other stuff are purposefully removed or ambiguous for obvious reasons. Most, if not all the TACs, cadre and command team have probably moved on since I was there. This is my experience with WOCS in 2025. results may vary. 

PRE-WOCS PREP

Learn the Warrant Officer Definition. Not part of it, all of it. Or, (and ask me how I know) don’t learn it and run the risk of looking like a moron. 

Don't get too wrapped up in all the group chats that take place before you report. Most of it was nonsense that wasn't helpful at all.

You aren’t an NCO anymore. A 19-year-old street-to-seater who just left basic is going to be your leader at some point. Get over it. Be helpful, be positive, be a team player. This is going to suck, so keep the complaints internal. The sooner everyone in class gets on the same page, the sooner the dumb parts of WOCS will end.

You must come to WOCS in shape, not A SHAPE. It’s not negotiable. I’m not talking about SFAS/RASP shape, just basic Army shape. You will do very little PT, so don’t expect to get ready there. Obviously, there are graduation required events, but there are other runs, like the 4-mile assessment, victory runs and land navigation that will require you to be ready. If you walk, fall out, or fail the 4-mile run, expect to be counseled, and put on TAC Officer or Senior TAC Officer Probation. It’s not a good look and draws unwanted attention to you. Also, they will absolutely recycle you or kick you out if you continuously fall out or go to sick call. If you fall out and say you are hurt, you will be forced to go to sick call.

Just get the stuff on the packing list, especially uniform items. There are boxes at the barracks with extra stuff like rank, pens, and notecards. You will also have time during the in-processing week to go to clothing and sales and the PX. There was never a real inspection, bag drop, or layout. They never “search” you or go through your stuff. You end up taking all your bags to the barracks late at night with literally zero supervision from the TACS. You can bring extra stuff too, like OTC meds, pillows, sheets, laptops, bug spray and clothes. Anything extra can be kept in secure storage or your lockable cabinet in your room. I highly advise 4-5 uniforms and 5-6 sets of PTS. I would also bring a second camelback if you can. If you go in the warmer months, your hydration system (HS) will get soaked. Having a dry one to go to class with will be nice. Laundry can be an issue so write a memorandum requesting daytime use of the laundry or using unoccupied barracks.

It’s hot and extremely humid. The bugs are everywhere…all the time.  Get bug spray and have it in your assault pack.  You will sweat through a uniform a day, at least.

Duty Positions

Avoid S1, S2, S4 at all costs. If you struggle writing papers, time management or delegating tasks to others, you are going to have a very stressful time at WOCS, especially as a primary. Being the best S1 or worst S4 doesn’t make any difference at all. You don’t get an award, nobody cares, and you are just putting pressure on yourself. Being bad at these will lose you valuable time and even get you put on probation. There is literally no reward for holding one of these jobs.

Feel free to jump on these tasks but be prepared to lose a lot of free time on these projects. If you are a good coffee officer, people will genuinely name their children after you someday. The pot should always be hot. The taste is mostly irrelevant.

Reporting to HHC

I don’t see any reason to report any earlier than your ATRRS report date. You don’t in-process any sooner. Just report in, do height and weight, get linen and try and get sleep. HHC barracks are gross, but you’ll only be there a few days.

WEEK 0: HHC/In processing week

This is probably the worst week of WOCS. Think of BCT reception, but with less structure and everyone thinks they’re the boss. Make sure to have your “I love me book” with all the stuff the welcome packet asked for. Have 2-3 copies of everything.

Do well on the ACFT/AFT. Don’t hurt yourself, but don’t sandbag it. If you finish running in the top 12 or 15 YOU WILL BE A ROAD GUARD. If that sounds like a fun time to you, then god bless.

Read the WOCSOP. Now read it again. You missed something, re-read it. Listen, you have nothing better to do, just read it again.

If you haven’t already, learn the Warrant Officer Definition.

Bag Relocation

From what I hear, WOCS ain’t quite what it used to be. Whatever the bag drag was, this isn’t it. Between 2000-0300 you will take your bags to the 1st WOC Barracks. Just use somebody’s vehicle to get everyone’s stuff. Drop your bags and go sleep as much as possible. The next 24-48 hours are going to be hectic.

Integration Day

This is not that bad at all. You will have learned the drill and ceremony part of this and have your WOCS stuff set up by now. Be calm, recite the definition or get pulled to the rear for a spot report. That’s it. There is no “smoking” or any real yelling. It’s more like getting parking tickets from a disappointed camp counselor. Essentially, you will start academics following this and your life will progressively get better (usually). If you get demerits, even several, don’t sweat it too much.

WEEK 1: 1st WOCs, 4-mile run, Land Navigation

Expect wake-up to be around 0400-0430 nearly every day.  There are tight timelines all day, every day. DO NOT BE LATE. Don’t fudge numbers because “you know your roommate is in the latrine”. Out of all the random stuff that happened, two people missing a formation was the thing that sent our TACS into the stratosphere with anger.

4-Mile Run

If you didn’t prepare…have fun. It’s an out-and-back 4-miler over blacktop with several long, swooping hills. You’ll be wearing a full hydration system (HS). Make sure you know what time you need to run it in. The CDR/Commandant threatened to restart or send people back a class if they walked, quit or didn’t make the time. We had several who quit or missed the time, and they all got counseled and threatened to be sent home due to lack of motivation. The Commander seems to be tired of it, and I don’t’ think they are bluffing. 

***UPDATE: They aren’t bluffing***

Land Navigation

If you don’t know how to do land nav, figure it out now. You will have a 2-hour block on plotting points the day prior and that’s it. You must get 3/4 points and return within a 3-hour time. At least 2-3 of the points will be on or near the road. You don’t even need to shoot an azimuth, just terrain associate and move out. The points are easy to spot, because each one is a 5-foot white pole with a number and a bright orange water cooler. All points and water points have an 8 digit on them for corrections. Also, your entire class plus 10-15 failures will be there. You will probably see someone standing at a point before you see the point. Again, this is basic Army stuff and self-correcting. This shouldn’t be an issue, but it is. I was shocked at how many (supposedly) outstanding NCO’s had zero clue how to do land navigation.

Everyone had one point that was a smooth 1,000 meters away, hidden by a creek or in a dense forest of massive spiders. I got to my first 3 points within an hour, without running at all. I spent an hour looking for a point near a creek that I’m convinced doesn’t exist. I was absolutely covered in massive banana spiders and fell in a murky creek. Fun fact about banana spiders: they don’t taste like bananas at all. They do taste like me walking my happy ass back to the start point munching on a First Strike bar with only 3 out of 4 points.

The course itself is the easiest course I’ve ever seen, and I still watched 12 people fail it. Reasons people failed: Generally bad at land nav, poor time management, and not writing down points correctly. It’s hot and humid, if you think you are going to run this entire thing, be my guest, but be prepared to damn near heat-cat. Some of the people who got all 4 points walked/ran damn near 7 miles. I think we had around 7 failures, with about 3 or 4 who failed the second go-round and got sent packing.

BZ Promotion 95%+

Good luck, a few came close, but nobody got promoted early.

WEEK 2: Victory Run, Leaders Reaction Course, 5k Ruck and Car Wash

Victory Run

This is a “fun run” for the graduating class. It’s roughly 3 miles at about a 9.5 minute pace. Don’t fall out unless you want to get counseled.

Leader Reaction Course

If you fail this, I don’t know what to tell you. This is a group effort, 10 minutes per station. Read the rubric, play the game, go to chow.

Blue Max Road Run

You are going to run as a class to Blue Max Road. It’s about 500 meters from the 1st WOCS footprint. Then you are going to run down and back up the hill about 3-4 times. It’s not fun. After that you will get some “motivation” in the form of some physical fitness. It will probably be the best PT you’ve done since you got to WOCS. I’m not a great runner, and I did not enjoy this at all.

5k Ruck

Make sure the morale officer submits memos for foreign objects including adding your ACH as weight in the ruck. Also, submit memos for no ACU Tops. Everyone in my class passed this event. I came in around 42 minutes (14:30ish pace) and gave maybe 75% on this. It was easy as far as ruck marches are concerned.

Room Inspection

If you and your roommate are staying on top of this, it shouldn’t be an issue. Follow the BSOP and whatever Standz puts out. Clean your room, you nasty weirdo. This is not an event you should stress over at all.

Car Wash

It’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s a fundraiser. Wash the car or hold the sign.

Week 3 Sign Presentation, 10k Ruck, Promotion,

Not much this week outside of academics. Another class is arriving at HHC this week, so senior class will have to grade their AFT. ***Update: Graded the incoming classes AFT. Didn’t think I’d have to say this, but arguing with TACS and the Cadre is not something you should do. Also, don’t get into arguments or talk trash to other candidates, unless you want to be standing at the position of “I’m an asshole” in front of the entire class with an extremely angry CW3 and CW4 absolutely demolishing you.***

PZ Promotion 85%+

Senior Status Pinning. Not sure what the big difference is. Don’t sweat it too much, this is almost over. During the ceremony, you will recite the WO definition. There are WO’s and TACS watching you to make sure you don’t mess it up. Don’t mess it up. I didn’t notice there to be any significant changes in freedoms outside of having access to your POV for a weekend. We only got 1 of the 2 passes anyway.

Also, dont be dicks to the junior classes. It's a waste of time and energy. Help them out as much as you can. 

10k Ruck March (under 106 minutes, 30% BW, max 48lbs)

Don’t overdue the weight and make sure you take care of your feet. If you’re a leaf-eater (like me) get one of the Combat Arms people to help you with your ruck. It makes a huge difference. We got lucky with a nice cool morning. Everyone passed. In all honesty, this is your final physical event, don't quit.

Uniform Inspection

This was more about appearance than anything else. You shouldn’t have gained too much weight, but it’s possible. The TACS were more concerned with the optics at graduation than anything else. 

Week 4 Staff Ride, Doctrine Test, Group Brief

Staff Ride: Horseshoe Bend National Park

Quite honestly the biggest waste of time, money and energy I’ve seen in quite some time. You get on the coach bus with barely working AC and drive for 3 hours. Along the way you’ll stop at a truck stop for lickies and chewies. You get to the park and walk around aimlessly and learn about a cannon for a few minutes. Bebop around a gift shop and museum for another 30 minutes for no reason. You will then move to a movie theater to be served a theatrical representation of a brief you have already received. Next is going outside to see a role player dressed like a period correct soldier. The culminating event is walking in a field to look at a wall that doesn’t exist. THE END. 

Honestly, you will learn nothing from this. The amount of time and money spent, and the risk involved, doesn’t outweigh the training objective. There is an amazing aviation museum across the street that could have been used for this.

Doctrine Test:

CTRL+F. It’s not that hard. Be cognizant of your time, having dual screens is a huge help.

Week 5 Capstone, Out-processing, Victory Run, Pass, Graduation

Oral Panel

You essentially need to get a go from 1 of the 4 panelists. Don’t be a robot and relate the question to you personally and how it can/will affect you in your job. If you don’t totally freeze up, pass out, cry or puke you should get a go.

Victory Run

By the time you are ready for your run, you will have already done one with a graduating class. You can technically fall out, but don’t. It’s just a bad look and there are a lot of eyes on you. There were probably 20-30 CW3/4/5 types running with you and they somehow know who you are if you are in their CMF.

TAC Officers

You will see a few in the morning during PT.  You may see them at the DFAC, and maybe after dinner chow. That’s it. Unless there is an event, they are pretty much not around. But when they are there, ramp up the good order and discipline. They aren’t out in the Alabama heat to waste their time. Having said that, they are (mostly) there to mentor you and shape you into a warrant officer. Hit them with a “Strength and knowledge sir/ma’am” and ask your question. They will treat you with respect and even joke around. They aren’t drill sergeants, but they aren’t your buddy, guy.

FYSA, the Senior TAC will likely be gone bythe time I post this, followed by a few of the other TACS. Senior Tac was by the book, fair, and highly motivated individual. With that, they were around for the “old WOCS” and were part of the transition to the “Candidate Led” WOCs. If I had to guess, WOCS will still be in a transition phase for a while.

Memorandums/ETPS

Memos and ETP’s are essentially asking for permission to be an adult. You will need to ask for permission to use the center stairwell, to change the lights out times, to use the vending machines, etc. Also look into submitting them for things like fitted sheets, adding your ACH to your ruck as dry weight, no ACU tops for the ruck. Have the Morale Officer start these before your report date.

STANDZ Officer:

Just do what they say. Maybe it’s dumb, but everyone needs to be the same kind of dumb, at the same dumb time. If you didn’t read and comprehend what the WOCSOP and BSOP ACTUALLY SAY, then be quiet and look like everyone else. This was probably my biggest point of contention, but once I gave in, it was easier.

Cadre/Civ Teachers

Maybe I got lucky, but all my instructors were awesome. They treat you like a WO1, and the more involved you are the better. They want you to be successful and aren’t gate-keeping the Cohort. The more you and your class participate, the better the course. Also, make sure the coffee team is on their game. You will get a break every 50 minutes and there are 70-90 people who NEED COFFEE NOW.

Academics

In all fairness, 80% of the course is classroom and could be virtual. The academics are generic and base level but are well instructed. Tests are not proctored, open notes, and should be generally easy for competent people. Master the art of Ctrl+F. I have also been told that ESL candidates have a little rougher time when it comes to test time, but I have no way of validating that.

Homework

Most of the homework is essays or discussion posts. There isn’t much of it and its high school level, at best. In all honesty you can have all of it knocked out on a Sunday. By all, I mean literally every assignment in WOCS that isn’t a group effort or a board.

$1,000 Dot/Uniform

Between the packing list, switching over your uniform, getting class shirts, coins and other crap….be prepared to drop anywhere from $250-$1,000. Just getting new shirts for the AGSU is going to cost $160. Class coins are going to run $9-12 apiece, class shirt and hat will be around $35. They will try and guilt you into buying 7 different types of class shirts guidons, etc. Do what you want with that, it’s your money.

I highly suggest switching your uniform before you get here and just dropping it off with Lee’s Alterations for dry cleaning. People doing the full switch here were paying nearly $200 for the braid, removing service stripes, dry cleaning and delivery. This does not include setting up your uniform. I had all that done at my local shop for $27, then paid Lee’s $45 for dry cleaning.

“WOC-isms”

Outside of the WOCSOP/BSOP, things like “GSL’s, AP’s and HS’s, there are other non-typical things you will do at WOC’s. The way marching is done, the way reporting is done, etc. Personally, I think this is to get you to unwind your NCO brain and rewire it to be more of an adaptive thinker. It’s small stuff, but some people can’t let it go. Honestly, if the point of WOCS to delete most of your NCO brain and make you allergic to stupidity…mission accomplished.

Senior Mentors

Our senior mentor, CW4 M. was great. My platoon had the distinct pleasure of having him as an instructor. This gentleman was an academic big brain with teaching chops to boot. Literally every interaction I had with him was a learning experience and I left it motivated and proud to be joining the Cohort. As an intel nerd, we had a few WO’s around to guide us, but I have mixed reviews on impact. Some were great, some were so-so. It kind of goes back to the overall experience, where I could have used a lot more mentorship and a lot less goofball stuff around the barracks.

General Knowledge

Just get along with people. If you aren’t in a leadership position, just be quiet. If you have a great idea that will help the team, talk offline with leadership. Everything is a completion grade outside of actual assignments. Don’t be too loud or too quiet. Work with your roommate on getting your room squared away for inspections. There was maybe 1 or 2 TACs that check rooms and hand out demerits. You must do some egregious stuff to get demerits.

If you enjoy tobacco or nicotine, get a Rx for Nicorette sent to Lyster Clinic. You can’t have cigarettes, chew or Zyn’s, but you can have Nicorette gum with a prescription.  You can also have OTC meds like Ibuprofen, just fill out the little card for the TAC.

Attitude is everything. I saw people get a small handful of demerits the entire time. However, multiple people got put on Senior and Commander TAC Probation for attitude. If you can’t control your mouth, eyes and body when presented with adversity, I’d start fixing that yesterday. Remember, everyone here has a dot waiting for them at graduation. Nobody here is competing for a spot. Being better than others doesn’t get you to graduation or CW2 any sooner. On the other hand, putting others down or being a problem will absolutely get you there later. Remember Rule #1: Be a good dude/dudette.

Before anyone says, “oh this guy must have been S1 or Standz”, nope. I was a random S5 tertiary who just did what was needed to pass. Not gunning for the top, not trying to win awards or attention. I was only focused on doing well on the required events, staying injury free, networking and helping the team. I think it’s important to remember the size of the Cohort, especially within your CMF. You will see these people again at WOBC and throughout your career and leaving WOCS with 4 or 5 more friends in your field is a good thing.

There will be spotlight rangers who throw people under the bus to impress the TACs. I’ll save you some time…they aren’t impressed. It actively makes them angry, and they will call you out, sometimes by name. For instance, a candidate was ear hustling another candidate tattle to Senior. It went something like this:

Candidate: Ma’am, candidate So-and-so is using their phones in the barracks. I wanted to let you know.

Senior Tac: Did you say something to them or correct them? Did you talk to your student leadership?

Candidate: Well…no ma’am. I wanted to tell you personally.

Senior Tac: So, you don’t possess the personal integrity and fortitude to make corrections when you see someone breaking the rules? Is that how you would handle, say, a SHARP violation?

Candidate: *melting in place* No ma’am…I…I…

Senior Tac: You’re dismissed candidate.

OVERALL IMPRESSION OF WOCS

This could have been an email.

Seriously though, the academics portion is just JKO courses, in person. Literally all the doctrine courses are on JKO or some other Army learning portal. The papers/discussion posts are easy. The tests are open notes, CTRL+F. If you have never taken a college course, you will struggle with some things. Find people who have experience writing papers or check out the Command and General Staff College (CGSC) book on how to write professional papers.

The rest of the course could be considered physical or rite of passage type stuff, but I never felt like it was effective. Sending a group of (mostly) seasoned NCO’s through AIT again is pointless. If you treated everyone like adults, and skipped the pointless accountability formations, lack of sleep and the ridiculous WOCSOP WOC-isms and “demerits”, we could really be getting after learning. The TACs/Cadre talk about mentorship and how we aren’t NCO’s anymore, but they are never around to mentor you unless you mess up or get them called out on decisions THEY made. In the off chance you have a block with one of the TACs, it’s clear that they don’t have a desire to be there or are unprepared to conduct a block of instruction. If they do pop in, it’s to review and regurgitate something from that day’s class and it devolves into “how to buy a house and make money” or “should I do PT with the joes” types of things.

IMO

If I was in charge for a day, I would only make one huge change. Aviator candidates would still attend WOCS at Fort Rucker. All other CMF’s would attend an academics focused program at CGSC, Fort Leavenworth or a similar campus. Nothing against aviators at all. In fact, the street to seat kids were some of the best we had. I just think that the bulk of what they could be doing at Ft. Rucker could be started there, while the rest of us could focus on technician-based learning at another campus. We could be getting a head start on taking ownership of our roles in MDMP, writing OPOPRDs, professional writing and research.

Have as much fun as you can, network with your peers and don’t stress out. It’s really just 4 weeks to make a huge quality of life jump. Remember, just be a good dude and you’ll do just fine.

1n6z9tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lelit/comments/1n6z9tb/lelit_mara_x_intermittent_heating_issues/,Lelit Mara X Intermittent Heating Issues,"Hi, recently been troubleshooting my Mara and after a lot of head scratching I finally figured out the issue, documenting it here in hopes it might help someone. **Not asking for help here, just wanted to document this in case someone has this issue in the future.**

My Mara would occasionally just not heat up, but very intermittently, sometimes it would heat up all the way, but then at some point it would lose temperature and drop down. I actually knew the exact temperatures inside the steam and brew boiler and when the heating element should be on [thanks to a little mod I made](https://github.com/maksymovi/maralicious), and there seemed to be little rhyme or reason as to when it heated up and when it didn't. However usually from a cold start it was able to reach temp, but at some point would fail to maintain temp, then come back. 

The issue in this case is the SSR, the solid state relay switch. Its the device that gives power to the heating coils, note this is high voltage power straight from the outlet, be careful with it when the machine is on. 

I was able to use a clamp ammeter and another voltmeter to measure the current through one of the wires output wires in the SSR and the voltage across the smaller input wires (there is also a small LED between the contacts that you can use, it seems to measure the input voltage though), was able to determine that it wasn't powering the heating element when the the SSR should be on. You should see about 9 amps AC going through the SSR. The SSR can be removed, its attached to an L bracket that kind of doubles as a heatsink (badly though, probably why this SSR failed).

It seems the issue is temperature related, the SSR itself will heat up until some critical temperature, then cool down slowly until it reaches some much lower normal temperature, then turn back on. No clue if this is a built in safety mechanism, or some kind of failure mode, either way, I was able to test this by powering down the machine, putting an ice pack on the back of the L bracket heat sink to cool it down, remove the ice pack, turned on the machine, and the SSR quickly was able to come back to life and heat the machine up to coffee temp within a few minutes. NOTE: DO NOT DO THIS WITH THE MACHINE ON, THIS IS A HIGH VOLTAGE DEVICE, BE VERY CAREFUL WITH IT.

Similar issue found here: https://www.home-barista.com/repairs/lelit-mara-x-solid-state-relay-failure-t97069.html, just wasn't able to find it until after I diagnosed the SSR is potentially the problem. Buy a new one, replace it, and the machine should be good as new. Note, espresso suppliers do sell it as the the Lelit 9600028 but they usually mark it up, the device is actually a Carlo Gavazzi RF1A23M25, searching that up may lead you to find it cheaper elsewhere [like here on digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/carlo-gavazzi-inc/RF1A23M25/16733182).

I started my first post as an administrative assistant 5 months ago at a small business. We recently moved to a new location and during the move I’ve also been coordinating two upcoming client events. 

There was no planning or framework for the move, it’s all been on me aside from the moving of the larger pieces of furniture. They had no moving supplies or plan for anything we’d need for the new office. I’ve been stocking it with everything we need, bathroom, kitchen, office supplies plants you name it. I’ve taken on new cleaning duties and responsibilities for making coffee and caring for the plants. All of this on top of the work outlined in my job duties, and all so that everyone else can continue to operate without missing a beat. No support for me, and only one of the 4 people I support even thanks me.

The point of it all: Sine the move, I’ve overheard them call me the “front desk girl” (I’m 34). One person handed me their trash to throw out (I declined to do that). They hand me used clients coffee mugs to take to the dishwasher rather than walk them there themselves (I can’t just keep dirty dishes at my desk so I have to get up in the middle of what I’m doing to take care of it). They play a game of telephone to tell me that the cleaner neglected to put a liner in the men’s room trash, insinuating that I need to be the one to do it. Literally 3 people now know about it and two were unwilling to just get a trash bag. I got them all moving gifts for the new office and only 1 person thanked me. 

Someone tell me every job in this role is like this and that I need to accept it. If that’s the case, I can readjust my perspective and humble myself a bit. But right now I feel like they suddenly see me as beneath them and it hurts.

I stayed on this ward for months trying to work on my clinical skills and resilience within a hostile working environment because I wanted to “prove it to myself” that I wouldn’t be pushed out of a job. In the end I was encouraged by one of my preceptors to make an official complaint in writing and to escalate the issues I’d been facing to my NUM. my NUM never responded to my email of complaint (and tried gaslighting me to my face by saying that you speak to the people on the floor and they occasionally buy coffee for you during their coffee run) though began investigating the claim as they had interviewed one of my friends who had first brought the issue to me initially. On my last day, my NUM hugged me and started tearing up saying that they shouldn’t have let me go and they’re so upset by this outcome, encouraged me multiple times to use them as a reference on their own volition. 

Since then, I have been interviewing for jobs. I noticed that one of the NUMs that interviewed me ran into a roadblock with a reference so I provided them with a supplementary one and I have been offered the job. It wasn’t until following up with someone from a critical area I’m more interested in that they explained my file had a “reg flag” pop up within the internal workforce team which stated my previous num would not recommend to re hire me. 

One of my references is completely shocked, stating that she had been a NUM for years and says there is no space to be emotional when responding to these questions and that it’s not possible not to recommend someone unless I have serious medication errors, unsafe clinical skills or have made an egregious error? 

I feel  like I have whiplash. The woman who told me about this over the phone said my NUM gave me strong clinical feedback but started I was more suited to critical care and he wouldn’t re hire me on a medical ward? 

An interesting thing to say considering I have never spoken to him about my interest in critical care and I’ve never worked in the area… bizarre.

Not sure if I should just go to urgent care or not.

I have been having dull, crampy, abdominal pains for the last 2 months. It is not sharp or localized, it is just vague and occurs in various regions of my abdomen.

Symptoms began mid-July 2025

Nothing makes the symptoms better or worse, they just either present or absent.

It is a dull, cramping pain, not sharp.

**Locations of pain:**

1. Epigastric region --> dull, crampy, gnawing discomfort, not really a pain just a very unpleasant discomfort. So when I say ""pain"" I really just mean a discomfort. Occurs during fasting and after eating, occurs randomly. It feels tender when I palpate that region on myself or when others do it to me.
2. RUQ --> worse with palpation, dull pain
3. LUQ --> dull pain
4. Periumbilical / umbilical region --> dull, cramping pain
5. LLQ --> dull pain, cramping feeling

Abdomen just feels mildly tender when I press on it or when others do.

Severity: 3-4 out of 10

These episodes have been constant in severity, but have been increasing in frequency to where I have them multiple times a week. I do not have nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Stool is normal color. Urine is normal color and and looks clear. Sometimes my lower abdomen feels ""full"", kind of like a pressure feeling. My appetite is normal though.

Past medical history: nothing GI related, just sports injuries, the occasional cold, etc. No chronic diseases or other illnesses.

No family history of, ulcers, IBS, or inflammatory bowel disease, or other GI problems. My dad had heartburn sometimes though and he took occasional tums. No family history of autoimmune diseases. No family history of significant illnesses or diseases.

My diet is mainly clean with home cooked meals, veggies, lean protein, whey protein shakes, but occasionally I will go out to eat with my girlfriend and get pizza, or grill some burgers at home, occasional junk food, etc. I exercise and lift weights regularly, I do not smoke. I drink alcohol on occasion, probably 1-2 drinks a week on the weekends, and I drink coffee maybe 2-3 times a week.

I am not taking any new medications, I do not have any allergies, no surgeries, no recent hospitalizations. No recreational drugs. I am sexually active but use condoms.

Travel history includes 4 trips to Southeast Asia and I am worried this may have something to do with the stomach pain:

1. Philippines, August 2023
2. Thailand, June 2024
3. Thailand, December 2024 - January 2025
4. Thailand, June 14th 2025 - July 7th 2025

Recent symptoms:

1. RUQ pain and worse pain with palpation on August 28th
2. Very mild and subtle itchy fulling throughout my body, arms, legs, face, neck, chest on September 2nd. This was actually the second episode of this, the first time it happened at the end of August. It is very subtle, but I can still feel it, I would describe it as that feeling when a mosquito or insect lands on your skin and you can feel a mild sensation/itchy feeling.

**Labs:**

I am not going to put all the lab results on here because I had a full metabolic panel and CBC done and it is too many results to list, but I can put what I think is most pertinent or add anything as needed. I highlighted the abnormal results.

**June 10th:** Metabolic Panel with CBC on June 10th before my most recent Thailand trip --> **platelets = 135k,** neutrophils = 3.2, **BUN = 24**, Creatinine = 0.94, GFR = 115, **BUN/Creatinine Ratio = 26**, Total Bilirubin = 0.4, Alkaline Phosphatase = 81, AST = 30, ALT = 18, **Urine = Cloudy**, Urobilinogen = 0.2 (it says normal is 0.2 to 1.0, and low is less than 0.2, this worries me because it is right on the cusp of being abnormally low). No other abnormal results. BUN was elevated but I was body building at the time so I am hoping it is just the excess protein I was consuming. Not sure why urine was cloudy, urinalysis came back normal (no proteins, sugar, etc. etc). RBCs were normal, nothing that would indicate anemias.

**August 4th:** CBC only to check platelets again --> platelets = 119k, neutrophils = 1.6 (???? --> 50% decrease in 2 month time span wtf)

CBC from Summer 2023 (2 years ago) showed platelets = 285k and from 2020 Platelets = 275k, no abnormalities.

**Other:**

I suffer from nocturia, for many years now. It has gotten better in recent months but I still pee probably 3 times per night. Saw a urologist, they did an ultrasound and said my bladder was normal and I am emptying okay. Not sure if this is related to anything above or not.

Thoughts and advice? I am really worried because I have never had health issues throughout my life so I do not know what is going on now. I don't know if the low platelets and abdominal pain or related or separate issues. I am trying to focus on my school work but it is always in the back of my mind.",2,1756855748.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1n6z3l3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/1n6z3l3/fk_otr/,F*&K OTR!,"I waited 10 minutes to pay for fuel because the staff were too busy making coffees and toasted sandwiches. I know, how dare I interrupt their ""barista"" role by trying to pay for petrol at a goddamned petrol station! Seriously, I was actually considering walking out in the hope that this would get some freaking attention. 

There was no queue at the register, just a bunch of half asleep people milling about waiting for their caffeine hit. I can't blame them. Clearly, anyone going to OTR for coffee has other issues. 

The worst thing is that I realise that I'm a bloody idiot because I KNOW OTR are an exploitative, crap company with no scruples, but I still went there anyway. I won't be fooled again. 

How many times do I need to press the red frowny face by the door before the store burns down?

Feel like this worked out soooo well, especially having to go by online pictures regarding the green cover 😭 picture of Hirono and the bear landing squarely on the back of the couch and everything! Two $70 pillows, the throw that I miraculously found from a total of 1 Chinese shop for $130 (originally went to get it like the literal day after lifestyle channel stopped offering it 😑), and a $60 couch cover. Money well spent imo, def more than I'd normally spend on decor at once but honestly not bad at all with where we ended up!! Next is a bug themed rug on the way, and swapping out from my boring millennial black coffee table/entertainment stand to a suitable brown, and maybe a couple smaller accent pillows- but I definitely feel like I've officially set up the anchor for my cozy little living room!

1n6ywzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MCAS/comments/1n6ywzw/how_long_was_your_longest_flare_do_mine_mimic/,How long was your longest flare? Do mine mimic anyone else’s?,"I’ve been staying with a friend for months because a smell in my house (I think ozone from HVAC) is what’s causing me to flare. We’ve had mold remediated and it wasn’t even LOTS, but I don’t think that’s it because I was in the home after remediation and alright, until they turned back on the AC which is brand new along with all my duct work. 

Anyways. My mom had been living there the entire time, and my daughter between there and her boyfriends. Whatever the smell is, quite literally only bothers me. While at my friends I’ve been mostly alright, especially in the more recent months. Way happier too because aside from still not being able to eat normal, I felt like my normal self again. No brain inflammation/fog, panic attacks almost gone except for a few here and there, no doom/suicidal thoughts except for once or twice. Got back to sleeping at least a solid 5 hours. 

Yesterday I went to my home to go through things, keep/get rid of. On top of the normal smell that bothers me (which I was there a small amount of time Saturday and didn’t notice it at all) my mom had just made coffee and it was a bit overwhelming. I was maybe at the house 2.5 hours max - a good portion of it outside. I also did many other things I don’t normally do yesterday because I was quite literally trying to get things accomplished. 

I felt great mostly all day. Then 6pm came and I was exhausted from the heat (Florida) and running and going through stuff so I had dinner out with friends. I was tired and eventually laid down at 11:30pm for bed (completely fine still) only to be wide awake at 12:30, panic attack, shaking, doom feeling, excessive need to potty, wanting to cry but forced myself not to because it makes everything worse. I maybe slept 2 more hours after that. 

Is it normal to be exposed and take THAT long for it all to come dumping down? I hate how absolutely insane this illness feels, especially the part where everyone thinks I’d be magically cured if I took anxiety meds 😩😩",5,1756855247.0,MCAS,22,1.0,False

I’ve heard that anything can be an offering, since I really enjoy singing, I wanna offer him a song. Last night, I prayed  to him that I want to offer him a song but I don’t know what song he wants to hear. I asked for a sign in my dreams of what song he wants. Instead of a song, he sent me a dream of my ex of nine months being mean to me 😭

I never get dreams of my ex anymore, it’s been a while since the last one. First thought when I woke up was “wow that’s real mature Loki. I was asking for a song not a reminder of how bad of a person my ex is” 😭😭 The dream was very vivid too.

Hi Everyone! Thank you in advance for your help. I really need to feel prepared! I have a high stress life in general (I feel anyway). I’m a single parent, (2 teenagers) I don’t have my parents anymore and my only sister lives half an hour away and doesn’t drive. I bought my ex out and so am mortgaged up to the eyeballs and am recently diagnosed last year during the most brutal burnout I’ve ever had in my life. (No shock anywhere on the diagnosis). Although maybe still in burnout after a year? Maybe another post! Anyway, I made the mistake of disclosing my diagnosis to my then boss (CEO) and subsequently lost my Pharma sciences job. (With settlement). I made a vow to never go back into management or the industry and have found myself earning double, self employed in construction sales on a contract. I love this job! It’s fun and I meet cool people but the hours are shit 10-12 a day and not predictable. I’ve only been doing it I can’t take even half a days break because it’s largely seasonal and I’m about to titrate with Medikinet XL next week. I’ve been waiting for 3 years to see how much this will help and now I’m shitting it because coffee makes me so tired! I really really don’t have time to be tired. I find it so hard to be on the ball that even the thought of being even more exhausted than I am now makes me terrified I’ll lose this gig. Sorry for the rant. I can’t remember the Reddit rules for cutting a long story short but; Unforgiving hours/contractor Caffeine = soooo tired Methylphenidate = ? £ = 0! Any and all advice would be greatly welcomed,

Apologies it’s a bit messy, I’m in the middle of moving in! 4 people live in the house and we are pretty social so would love the living room to feel cozy and be able to comfortably seat friends when we have people over!

We don’t love the couches or the color of them and were considering making covers for them, but perhaps we just need new couches to fit the space better? The coffee table is too big for the space. We aren’t attached to really any aspect of the living room/dining room and mostly just want a TV somewhere, dining room table of some sort probably, place for the record player and records, and some sort of bar or bar cart! We would love the kitchen and living room to feel more separated somehow! We don’t have many lamps so wanna figure out where some floor lamps could go too to brighten up the room with warm / orangey lights.

Another ideal dream is to have there be a cute selfie kind of area across from the floor length mirror we have (see photo of long mirror)! More art and plants are surely in order as well.

Layout ideas / furniture ideas / any advice would be so helpful! It’s such a strange shape! We just really want to make it cute, cozy, and welcoming. We are all artists and musicians so we love quirky decor but we all agree the living room isn’t aesthetically pleasing us at its current state!

1n6yttb,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1n6yttb/they_mocked_the_shackled_man_until_earths_signal/,They Mocked the Shackled Man… Until Earth’s Signal Unleashed His Partner,"The galaxy had long forgotten the sound of chains.

In the Great Tribunal Hall of Vey’Kar, where empires judged and condemned, silence reigned as a lone figure was dragged across the crystalline floor. His wrists were bound in alien iron, his body battered, but his eyes—those strange human eyes—burned with something no conqueror had ever managed to extinguish.

A thousand alien dignitaries leaned forward in their floating thrones, their translucent skins gleaming under the cold light of the council chamber. For centuries, these beings had ruled the stars, crushing resistance before it could take root. To them, humanity was a minor nuisance—a primitive world barely out of its cradle, foolish enough to raise weapons against civilizations that had sailed the cosmos before Earth had even lit its first city fire.

And yet, the man did not kneel.

“Name your rank,” snarled High Captain Vey’thor, his mandibles clattering as he loomed over the prisoner. “You will tell us who commands Earth’s defenses, so we may tear your armies apart piece by piece.”

The human lifted his chin, blood dripping down his cheek. His voice, hoarse but unyielding, cut through the chamber like a blade:

“Humans don’t wait for permission to defend their own.”

The words rippled through the hall, a defiance so absurd that laughter erupted among the alien captains. They mocked him—this shackled creature who dared speak as if his dying species still had hope.

But then… a sound.

A pulse.

It echoed through the Tribunal’s walls, low and steady, like the beating of a war drum. Lights flickered as a signal breached the unbreachable halls of Vey’Kar.

The shackled man smiled through broken lips.

Somewhere beyond the council’s perception, far past the rim of their complacency, Earth had spoken. And with that signal came something the aliens had never expected—an answer.

Because he was not alone.

His partner was coming.

And the stars themselves would learn why humanity was never meant to be chainedIn the council chambers of Vey’Kar, the laughter rolled like thunder.

To the assembled captains and warlords, the shackled man’s words were nothing but the bravado of a cornered animal. His species had only tasted the stars for a single century—barely a breath of time compared to the millennia of dominion held by the Ar’kai, the Vey’thorians, and the scaled dynasties of the Xi’Drak.

They called humanity “the upstart fireflies”—a species that burned bright for a moment before being snuffed out by the endless night.

“Primitive,” one commander scoffed, his tendrils curling with contempt. “Their ships are nothing but iron coffins wrapped in fire. No quantum sails, no resonance cannons, no living armadas. They fight with scrap.”

Another laughed, tapping the human’s chains with a claw. “Even their soldiers are fragile. Bones break. Flesh tears. They are soft things pretending at war.”

High Captain Vey’thor leaned close to the prisoner, his many eyes glimmering with cruel amusement. “Your Earth is finished. We gave it a single cycle of war. One. And already your defenses are broken. You are a species of dreamers who believed courage could conquer empires.”

The man said nothing. He only watched them, his silence sharper than any blade.

The council did not understand.

They measured strength in fleets, in weapons, in the longevity of empires. They did not know what it meant to grow up fragile, to fight a world that had never been kind, to survive despite scarcity, storms, and extinction’s shadow.

Humans were born of a world that killed the careless.

And because of that, they carried something alien empires had long forgotten: the will to fight when there is no chance left at all.

But the captains did not see it.

They returned to their councils, laughing over wine distilled from dying suns. They spoke of the human resistance as if it were a child’s tantrum, a brief flame that would sputter and die.

What they did not know—what none of them could imagine—was that Earth had never fought to win.

Earth fought to endure.

And endurance was the one weapon no empire had prepared to face.
The stars burned crimson above the ruined colony world of Halcor Prime.

Here, the alien fleets gathered to make an example of humanity’s defiance. Thousands of ships, their hulls gleaming with alien alloys, formed a ring of fire around the planet. To the Vey’thorians, this was not war—it was extermination. One strike, one obliteration, and the message would echo across the galaxy: resist, and be erased.

And then, the humans arrived.

They came not with grand fleets of shining vessels, but with ships cobbled from desperation. Old freighters turned into gunships. Mining rigs reinforced with armor plates. Orbital fuel haulers reworked into missile barges. To alien eyes, they were laughable—a fleet of scavengers held together by duct tape and stubbornness.

The Vey’thorian warlord sneered. “Is this humanity’s armada? Scrap metal and firecrackers?”

The first salvo proved him wrong.

Human ships ignited space in a storm of chaos. Instead of orderly battle lines, they swarmed like predators, hurling volleys of kinetic slugs at impossible velocities. Where the aliens wielded elegant energy weapons, the humans unleashed raw physics—hyperdense projectiles that punched through shields not by elegance, but by sheer brutality.

A mining rig, retrofitted with rail cannons, tore a destroyer in half with a single shot. A fuel hauler, its tanks rigged to detonate, rammed into a cruiser, vanishing in a sun-bright explosion that blinded sensors for miles.

The aliens reeled. This was not strategy they recognized. It was not battle—it was survival turned into a weapon.

“Impossible!” the warlord snarled, mandibles clattering as human missiles broke through his flagship’s outer shields. “They fight without formation! They throw their lives away like—like animals!”

But to the humans, it was not waste. It was sacrifice.

Every ship lost bought time for another to strike. Every pilot who fell made their enemy bleed. And in the chaos, a message spread through the alien armadas:

These humans do not fight to preserve themselves.

They fight to hurt us, no matter the cost.

For the first time in centuries, an empire’s fleet pulled back from a battle it was supposed to dominate.

And for the first time, the stars whispered fear.
The battle of Halcor Prime did not end with victory.

It ended with silence—drifting wrecks of human ships, entire families who had volunteered their freighters to be converted into war machines, gone in blossoms of fire. The surviving human vessels limped away, their hulls cracked, their engines howling. To the alien council, it was confirmation that humanity had merely delayed the inevitable.

But to the humans, it was proof of something greater.

They could hurt the empire.

Even a single wound against an invincible foe meant the foe could bleed.

On Earth, the war councils gathered in underground bunkers as alarms howled overhead. Generals were not soldiers of glory, but teachers, engineers, mothers, and farmers pressed into command. Their maps were not gilded holograms but patched-together star charts smeared with grease and coffee stains. And yet, from these crude tables came strategies the alien empires could not comprehend.

“Every ship is a weapon,” one admiral said, her voice hollow with exhaustion. “Every person is a weapon. We can’t win by numbers, but we can bleed them until they doubt themselves.”

The strategy was brutal, almost unthinkable: trade lives for time, ships for doubt, worlds for survival. Where the empires expected neat lines of battle, the humans scattered into guerrilla cells, striking convoys, crippling supply chains, turning asteroids into traps.

They weaponized desperation.

A small colony with no hope of evacuation sent its miners into space with charges strapped to their rigs, detonating themselves inside alien hangars. Orbital stations overloaded their reactors, dragging fleets into fiery graves. Families burned their own crops so that alien armies would starve before they could feast.

To the empires, it was madness.

To humanity, it was survival.

News of these sacrifices spread not only among humans, but through the hidden networks of other conquered species. For the first time in generations, whispers carried across the stars:

“The humans fight as though death is not defeat.”

And in the council of Vey’Kar, High Captain Vey’thor slammed his claws on the table. “They are insects! Nothing more! Every act of defiance only proves their weakness. They waste themselves for scraps of delay.”

But deep within the void, the shackled man—still imprisoned, still bleeding—smiled when he heard the distant echoes of battle reports.

Because he knew something the captains did not:

Every sacrifice was building toward something greater.

A storm the empires could not yet see.
The Great Council of Vey’Kar shimmered with the light of ten suns, each ambassador seated upon thrones of crystal, bone, and steel. War banners hung in the air, their colors woven from photons themselves. To outsiders, it would seem a gathering of gods.

But to the humans who bled beneath them, they were tyrants dressed in finery.

High Captain Vey’thor stood at the center, mandibles clattering as he recounted the latest reports. “The human colonies burn. Their fleets shatter like glass. Their commanders waste themselves in acts of idiocy. One world even detonated its atmosphere to deny us harvest.”

The chamber erupted in laughter.

“Insects chewing at giants,” sneered the Xi’Drak warlord, his scales rippling with cruel amusement. “Let them sting. Their poison is too weak to scar us.”

“They waste ships as though their lives are worthless,” another commander added. “Perhaps they are. They fling their youth into our guns like fodder, as if courage alone could bend the stars.”

Vey’thor raised a clawed hand. “And yet, there is a danger in such recklessness. They kill without precision, without rules. They warp the order of war. Our fleets were built to face empires that fought with honor, with strategy, with balance. These humans…” He hesitated, mandibles twitching. “…they are chaos.”

Silence fell for a moment—just a sliver of unease.

Then a chuckle broke it.

“They are children throwing stones at titans,” a voice said. “What is chaos to eternity?”

The laughter rose again, booming across the chamber. Their mockery drowned the sliver of doubt. The humans were no threat. The humans were doomed.

And yet, in the quiet corners of the galaxy, the conquered and enslaved heard these same reports and did not laugh.

The Telari slaves whispered of colonies that detonated themselves rather than submit. The fractured clans of the J’ra remembered stories of their ancestors who had once fought this same empire, long ago—and wondered if perhaps the humans carried something their people had lost.

But the council did not see the danger.

They mocked. They celebrated.

And in their arrogance, they fed the fire they thought was dying.
The Vey’thorian empire had studied humanity with the cold eye of conquerors. They catalogued the fragility of bone, the limits of muscle, the shortness of lifespan. To them, humanity was soft flesh against armored carapace, brief lives against ancient dynasties.

But what the empires never understood was this: what breaks easily learns fastest how to adapt.

Across the scattered remnants of human space, survivors began turning ruin into strategy.

On the shattered moon of Tyrel-9, engineers took the wrecks of orbital stations and fashioned them into kinetic rail platforms, hurling debris at enemy ships with terrifying precision. On the ice-world of Veyros, ground troops lured invaders into frozen canyons, collapsing entire glaciers onto armored columns. On Mars, children learned to fly drones hacked together from mining equipment, harassing patrols until the sky itself seemed alive with gnats that bit and vanished.

The weakness of humans—their lack of strength, their vulnerability—became their greatest weapon. Because every loss forced innovation. Every death taught a lesson. Every wound birthed a new way to fight.

Alien commanders raged at this madness.

“They scatter like vermin, yet strike like predators!” one Xi’Drak captain howled as his fleet limped from an asteroid ambush.

“They die and die, yet they change with every battle,” snarled another. “Their ships are never the same twice. Their weapons are crude, yet evolve faster than our countermeasures.”

What the empires had long abandoned—trial by fire—humans embraced with ferocity. Where others sought stability, humanity thrived in instability. Where others clung to tradition, humanity broke every rule, rebuilt, and struck again.

And still, the shackled man sat in his prison, his body failing but his spirit unbroken. To his captors, he was a curiosity—a symbol of defiance they could parade before their councils.

But deep within the static of intercepted transmissions, the signal from Earth whispered again. A phrase the aliens could not translate pulsed across hidden channels, repeated by guerrilla fighters, colonists, and dying soldiers alike:

“Hold the line.”

The stars themselves seemed to tremble as that phrase spread from human worlds to the ears of other enslaved races.

The frail ones. The forgotten ones.

And in that moment, weakness became contagion.

And contagion became power.
It was supposed to be the end.

The alien fleets gathered above the gas giant Korrath, a storm-wracked world whose gravity wells tore ships apart if they strayed too close. The empires chose it deliberately, confident that here the last remnants of Earth’s “fleet” would be erased in a single decisive strike.

The numbers alone should have crushed any hope: four thousand warships of the Vey’thorian empire, reinforced by Xi’Drak dreadnoughts and Ar’kai swarm carriers. Against them: fewer than three hundred human vessels, most of them patched together with scavenged hulls and jury-rigged reactors that screamed with every maneuver.

The council called it the culling.

But history would name it something else.

The humans came not in lines of battle, but in fragments—scattered, chaotic, diving into the gas giant’s storms where no sane fleet dared go. Alien sensors flickered, confused by lightning that danced across the clouds. Then came the first strike: asteroids, dragged by tug-ships, slingshot into enemy formations at orbital speeds. Shields buckled. A dreadnought spun into the atmosphere, torn apart by gravity.

The aliens answered with fire. Entire wings of human ships vanished in seconds. But where one ship died, another struck from the storm. Tiny corvettes darted under capital vessels, latching on with magnetic claws before detonating their cores. Drones swarmed like hornets, carrying warheads stolen from fallen allies.

It was madness.

It was suicide.

And it was working.

High Captain Vey’thor watched in fury as his formations unraveled. “They do not fight,” he roared. “They infect! They are chaos given form!”

But chaos spread faster than order could contain. For every human ship that burned, an alien vessel followed it into the storm. For every act of desperation, another weakness in the empire’s armor was revealed.

And then came the strike that turned the war.

A single human carrier, its engines failing, plunged into the gravity well with a convoy of alien cruisers in pursuit. Its signal went silent. The aliens marked it destroyed.

But deep in the storm, the carrier’s hull split open—revealing it had been hollowed out, packed with warheads, its skeleton crew long since evacuated. The cruisers never had a chance. The explosion lit the storm like a second sun, tearing half a fleet into wreckage that rained for days into Korrath’s endless clouds.

When the smoke cleared, the humans had not won a clean victory. Their fleet was shattered, their dead countless.

And yet… the empires had lost more ships in one day than in a century of war.

The galaxy felt it.

Whispers spread like wildfire through slave camps and hidden enclaves: The humans bleed, but they do not break.

And in the shadows of his cell, the shackled man lifted his head when he heard the news. For the first time, he allowed himself a smile—not of defiance, but of triumph.

Because Korrath had not been a battle.

It had been a message.
The Battle of Korrath became a wound that no empire could hide.

For centuries, the Vey’thorian war machine had ruled unchallenged. Every rebellion crushed, every uprising erased, every whisper of defiance buried under silence. Yet now, across the fractured galaxy, the silence cracked.

On the frozen mines of Veyros, Telari slaves smuggled human broadcasts into their barracks. Grainy, broken transmissions—faces streaked with soot, voices hoarse from battle—spread through the dark. The message was not polished propaganda. It was raw, desperate, real.

“We are dying,” a human commander’s voice declared across hidden channels. “But every death is proof that they can bleed. Hold the line. Fight with us. If we fall, fall striking at their throats.”

The Telari did not laugh. They sharpened their mining drills into weapons.

On the jungles of Kallash, the insectoid Rythi heard tales of human pilots who dove into storms to drag dreadnoughts down with them. They remembered their ancestors, broken by the same empires, and began to whisper again of freedom.

Even in the shadows of the council itself, among the lowest servants and attendants, something dangerous stirred. Quietly, secretly, they repeated the words the humans had made into a creed:

“Hold the line.”

The empires did not notice at first. They were too consumed with fury, too blinded by the humiliation of Korrath. High Captain Vey’thor demanded a campaign of extermination, promising to scour Earth until nothing but ash remained. Fleets mobilized. War drums thundered.

But as the ships departed, cracks deepened in the walls of their dominion. Slave revolts erupted on three outer colonies. Supply convoys vanished into asteroid fields where “pirates” suddenly fought with unnerving precision. Garrisons reported sabotage, uprisings, workers who no longer bowed when commanded.

And always, always, there were whispers of humans.

The shackled man felt it too. Even from his prison, he could sense the change. His guards grew tense, more alert. Their laughter at his defiance grew brittle, forced. Reports slipped through the cracks—uprisings, sabotage, rebellion.

He did not need to see it to know:

Humanity had done more than fight.

They had taught the galaxy to remember how.The war had burned across a hundred worlds, but it would end where it began—at the heart of the empire.

The Vey’thorian homeworld, Vey’Kar, gleamed like a crown jewel in the void. Its orbital citadels stretched like spiderwebs of crystal and steel, its planetary shields pulsed with power stolen from a hundred conquered suns. No enemy fleet had ever breached it. No rebellion had ever dared approach it.

Until now.

The humans came first, ragged ships scarred by years of war, their fleets held together by stubbornness and sacrifice. But they did not come alone.

The Telari, once slaves in frozen mines, flew ships rebuilt from stolen drills and refitted haulers. The insectoid Rythi swarmed in vast numbers, their fighters rising like a living storm. Even fractured clans of the J’ra, thought extinct, emerged from hiding, their ancient weapons revived for one last strike.

The galaxy had gathered, not under banners of empire, but under three words whispered across a thousand battlefields:

“Hold the line.”

From the citadel, High Captain Vey’thor watched in disbelief as the armada approached. His mandibles ground against each other in rage. “They bring cattle to fight gods,” he spat. “Crush them. Erase them.”

The battle ignited.

The void erupted in a storm of light and fire. Alien dreadnoughts unleashed beams that carved entire flotillas apart. Human ships answered with rail slugs and swarms of drones that cut through escorts like shrapnel. Slave fleets broke their chains mid-battle, turning their guns against their masters.

For every alien titan, there were ten smaller ships gnawing at its flanks. For every worldbreaker weapon fired, another human sacrifice bought the allies time to strike.

It was not order. It was not elegance.

It was chaos.

And chaos was winning.

In the midst of the storm, a prison ship broke apart in orbit. From its shattered hull, a single escape pod burned toward the battlefield. Inside was the shackled man—scarred, beaten, but alive.

His pod was caught by a human frigate, its crew gasping as they pulled him aboard. And when he rose, chains still clattering at his wrists, the bridge fell silent.

“Sir…” the captain whispered. “What are your orders?”

The man’s eyes burned like fire.

“Same as always,” he said. “Hold the line.”

With him at the helm, the fractured fleet fought like a single organism. Every sacrifice became coordinated, every strike sharpened. The empires faltered. Their perfect order crumbled against a tide of defiance they could no longer predict, no longer contain.

And as Vey’thor’s flagship reeled under the weight of fire, he realized the unthinkable:

The humans were not fighting to win.

They were fighting to end.
The skies above Vey’Kar burned.

Where once the empire’s fleets had stood unchallenged, now wreckage drifted in silence—thousands of ships torn apart, their hulks scattering across the void like broken crowns. The citadels that had glittered for millennia were cracked, their shields shattered by the relentless assault.

And at the center of it all, the shackled man stood upon the bridge of a scarred human frigate, chains still clinging to his wrists as if mocking the empire’s arrogance. Around him, the last survivors of a thousand worlds fought shoulder to shoulder, their voices carried across comms in a single, unbroken chorus:

“Hold the line.”

High Captain Vey’thor, bloodied and broken, broadcast his final threat across the channels: “You are nothing. You are insects gnawing at titans. Even if you burn us, others will rise. Humanity will vanish into ash.”

The man answered not with threats, but with truth. His voice carried to every ship, every rebel, every slave who had ever whispered freedom into the dark:

“No. We will not vanish. Because we are what you cannot understand. We do not fight for dominion. We do not fight for conquest. We fight because we know what it means to lose everything… and still rise again. You think weakness is our curse. But it is our gift. And it is the one thing you will never conquer.”

With that, the final strike came. Human frigates, guided by allied fighters, pierced the flagship’s heart. Vey’thor’s vessel erupted in fire, consumed in the same storm he had once believed only his enemies could suffer.

Silence followed.

Not the silence of defeat.

The silence of awe.

The war was over. The empires lay shattered, their chains broken. Across the galaxy, slaves stood free, rebels stood tall, and the name human carried a weight it never had before.

In the days that followed, stories spread like wildfire. They spoke of the shackled man who defied the tribunal. They spoke of the people who turned broken ships into weapons, who fought with blood and will alone. They spoke of the species that had taught the stars themselves to remember fear.

And long after the fires cooled, long after Earth rebuilt from ash, one truth remained:

The galaxy would never again look at humanity and see fragility.

They would see the ones who endured.

The ones who rose.

The ones who turned weakness into legend.

And when the stars whispered their name, it was with reverence—and fear.

1n6yscx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n6yscx,Scanning the tracing QR code on bag leads me to stories and no where to put in the code.,"Look.... You have no idea how long I've been trying to figure out when I can the QR code on the bag or manually type the website... Why is it taking me to the story of Starbucks and no link or ANYTHING to trace the coffee itself so that I can do my Coffee Masters hassle free no problem. Has anyone else been having this issue or have I been the only one suffering with a research disability...? I just want to easily see my coffee region map and print it because it's pretty, more info or a link to the details of the growing region, where it is, the notes, the pairings, the washing process- like I am genuinely so fed up right now. And yes, I already know this info, but I specifically need to know the growing region of this bag on a map so I can print it, look at the format, and have an easy spot to access all my information. I just want to work on my project right now.

Does anyone have a link or has anyone else also been experiencing this issue? I have genuinely never thought I'd be so sick of seeing the story of Starbucks popping up in my face consecutively.",1,1756854927.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False
1n6yroc,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1n6yroc/autofilling_the_water_reservoir_how_to_do_it_the/,Auto-filling the water reservoir (how to do it the hard way!),"I've been on a journey, recently, to figure out a system to auto-fill my coffee machine's water reservoir. Not sure if anyone else is interested in doing this.

Turns out there are two ways to go about it. I've done both.

If you have a lot of room in your reservoir (maybe you have a large Keurig machine), you can run a water line to a small float valve (the kind they use for aquariums). There are several YouTube videos showing how to do this.

However, if you don't have a lot of room (maybe you have a Nespresso machine) then there's no room for even the smallest of float valves.

I solved the problem with an electric solenoid, an inductive water level sensor, and a timer. The sensor adheres to the exterior of the tank. The solenoid activates to allow water to flow into the tank. And the timer enforces a delay between the water level dropping and the activation of the solenoid, as well as limiting the period for which the water can run (a safety feature).

If you're wondering why a delay is required before the solenoid activates, it's to prevent ""stuttering"" (where the solenoid repeatedly turns on and off as the machine consumes water).

If this is of interest to anyone, let me know. Happy to share information and pictures.

I currently have my unit running on a Breville Barista Pro. It would work on any machine or even on any other device with a water reservoir (water flosser, fountain, etc).

I (F19) have been on birth control since September of last year. I take my pill consistently and have never missed a dose. This month, I started my 5th semester of college as a STEM major. Due to packing, unloading, and the insane amount of studying, I have relied on energy drinks to get me through my days. On August 14th and 15th, I switched from the normal black cup of coffee to the Witches Brew Alani. I drank half of one on the 14th, and almost a full one on the 15th. On the 16th I moved into my dorm. I’ll spare the details but me and my long-distance boyfriend were able to see each other for the first time in months. Today, I ran out of coffee pods so I bought a Double-Shot Espresso Starbucks energy drink. A few drinks in I realized that it contained Panax Ginseng. I did some digging and found out that not only does this contain Panax Ginseng, but so does Alani Energy drinks. This has me incredibly worried as some articles suggest that Panax Ginseng can reduce the effectiveness of birth control and it acts as a type of estrogen in a way. I called up two different pharmacists and they both said I should be fine, along with checking drug interaction websites which said there are little/no interactions between the two. Should I worry about this? Has anyone gotten pregnant from drinking energy drinks that contained Panax Ginseng. I’m highly frustrated as I have never heard that Ginseng could affect birth control until now. I’ve only ever heard of St.John’s Wart and certain antibiotics/anti fungal medicines effecting the medicine. Will I be okay? ",0,1756854700.0,birthcontrol,4,0.5,False

I'm new to Nimble and I'm trying to understand where the ""Basic Fantasy Fighter"" class is exactly. 

Please forgive me as I'm not sure I've understood all 3 core books correctly but from what I can tell:   
  
The Commander = Seems like a ""Military General"" that doesn't solo fights but actually needs people around them to sort of help buff them and co-ordinate attacks with them almost like a bard buffs people instead of doing the damage themselves / all their class abilities aren't focused on just their fighting output but on teamwork.. / commanding people / heavily relies on other people being there during the fight.. / not really.. themed to be a lone wolf fighter very efficiently /   
  
Berserker =  Seems like a straight up Barbarian. awesome DMG! But can't wear plate or any armor for typical Barbarian reasons.. I get this one but at least they don't rely on others..    
  
Hmmmm..  - I want to be a lone fighter, pick up a sword.. wear plate.. be self reliant and also .. not command anyone ever.. and if all my teammates are somehow subdued / knocked out.. I want to feel like a fighter should be able to do it on their own.. and not need anyone (other than a healer occasionally)  

Also that means that I wouldn't be able to fully enjoy the Commander if I played as a solo character due to their abilities needing others to use them with.. 

Is there an option that if there isn't anyone to ""command"" that a Commander's DMG doubles? lol. Not much of a Commander if you're not actually commanding. I get that too. 

It's like asking for a regular coffee and needing to describe why all the other fancy options aren't regular coffee. From what I've also read online is that other people almost shame people for knocking the Commander in any way, saying 'how much better a Commander is'.. but I don't want to command. And want 100% of my abilities to be for me doing damage as a fighter. 

Maybe someone has made a Fighter Class / work around? I might just use the Barbarian and say they CAN wear Plate.. lol.. (over powered, but I wanna fighter smash at level 1). ",2,1756854592.0,nimble5e,6,1.0,False

I have to admit, I love Charlotte's videos and have basically been binging them all day for the past few weeks when one video caught my eye, specifically the one 'How do I inform this woman that she's not my gf?' because I have a SIMILAR story...

(Apologies in advance bc it's long!!! I'm an author and can't help myself with important details...)

I (35f), swiped right on a dude (43m) about 4 years ago when I was going through what I gently call 'my hoe phase'. We'll call him...Bruce. Basically, it involved dating a bunch of guys at the same time to 'sort through the fish', if you will, at a faster rate. Sadly, not everyone stuck around.

For some reason, this one dude did, even after I found a boyfriend, moved to a whole other city 6+ hours away, only for said bf's step-M(onster)IL to kick me to the curb against his wishes. But that's a whole other story. Me and Bruce had a more ""friends with benefits"" situation going on and didn't really spend a lot of time fooling around, which was fine with me. We talked about a lot of things, more than anything, and we both leaned on each other for some much-needed trauma processing. With my gaining a boyfriend and moving away, he became *strictly* just a friend. No weird sexting, no meeting up, definitely no hanky-panky, touchy-feely nothing. Just occasional reaching-out-updates on how the other is doing. I'd tell him about my work in my city, he'd send me nude house pics (he was gutting and restoring his house as a way to both process and eventually sell and move elsewhere), and overall it was a very platonic experience.

Well, a combination of my poor life choices and bad luck, and I found myself in a bad situation. Shitty job, super-high rent for a singular room in a crazy person's house, isolation, depression, etc. This person was also highly toxic, refused to fix anything in her house while insisting on buying brand-new clothes and accessories, let her home be infested with \*all\* sorts of critters, and, somehow, being one of her two tenants, the entire situation was my fault. Yup, bestie, you right, it was my fault for not seeing who you really were and getting stuck in this lease where I'm starving myself to buy bed bug poison.

*Anyway.*

It got to be too much. I needed help. I had been trying to drag myself up and out for a year to no success and my health was quickly deteriorating. I desperately needed help. And who should just happen to call randomly that moment?

Bruce!

I told him everything. Went into every *excruciating detail* that I won't share here, bc it's pretty bad. He heard loud and clear, was making plans to come get me, and asked me to hold off another month. Said month came and went, and when I reached out again, he said his mother had talked him out of it. Another month went by with radio silence on my end. I tried other routes, checked with local help, called my estranged relatives, checked with shelters - anything that might get me out of there.

Something like two or three months later, he calls me out of the blue, apologizing to no end. I'm about to hang up when he asks if I still need help. I want to say no, I want to turn him away, but the fact was that I was still drowning, still desperate, and my situation was somewhat worse. He explained what had happened and how his mother got into his head, that he'd finished up and sold the house, bought himself an RV, and was on his way there. I had about a week to prepare. The plan was, he was going to pick me up, and we were going to go to a whole other state where I could start over. I told him that I didn't want to give him another chance to let me down again bc, frankly, I couldn't handle it anymore. My situation had become so bad that 'playing in traffic' had become a potential solution. (As dramatic as this sounds, I'm really glossing over the details on how bad the situation was, plus that I've been suffering from major depressive disorder with moderate anxiety for a very large portion of my life and had been unmedicated for close to a year at this point due to severe lack of funds.)

I didn't dare hope, but I prepared anyway. During that week, I was fired from the shitty job I'd had and long ago lost my car to repossession, and put up with more threats of eviction and gaslighting and more.

But he still showed up.

Bruce put one foot in that home and gagged before stepping back out and shaking himself off. He told me to bring everything I was keeping out (which was basically some clothes and electronics since the rest of my furniture had to be abandoned...), and loaded up all my stuff after spraying it down and securing it. Finally, I took a shower and dressed in clothes he had freshly laundered, and I was finally free. We set off, and for the first time in a while, I felt safe.

Several hours later, we found ourselves in a whole other state. After dropping off my things at a storage unit, we stayed in an RV park for a month while I helped him shop around for a new house. 

Fast forward a few months.

We've gone hiking, visited a nearby lake a few times, drank ourselves stupid while sitting and laughing beneath the stars, gone out to breakfast, lunch, and dinner, even hugged once or twice. All on his dime. While there were a few times where I questioned if he was really okay with picking up the tab, he was firm about my not questioning his finances, so I dropped it. I never asked us to go anywhere specific unless he asked me pointedly what I wanted to eat, which wasn't very often. (I know what you're gonna say, and honestly, it was nice not having to decide lmao)

He bought me some new clothes. He let me use his laptop to apply for jobs and write, and generally just dink around with. He made sure I was okay, even tried going on a walk or two around the park's jogging path.

Sounds pretty romantic, right?

See, here's where I'm confused.

Yes, we did the hanky-panky. Maybe once in a blue moon. It wasn't super often, and he was very unaffectionate about it, which made things a little awkward for me. I also slept in a separate bed on the opposite end of the camper. There were also *many* times (easily 10x the number of times we did the dirty) where he *explicitly stated* that he ""Didn't want a girlfriend, didn't want a wife, and especially wasn't interested in a romantic relationship. Not with you, not with *anyone*.""

Which, tbf, I can't really blame him given how his last relationship went. Had I been in his shoes, I'd have already been in jail for life.

And you know what? I respect the heck out of that. He knew what he wanted! Yes, it stung a little bit that I wasn't something that he wanted, and frankly, it was around that time that hanky-panky started feeling kinda...icky because it made me feel used, like a fancy toy. So I stopped asking for it. He set a boundary, and I was gonna respect it because he came and essentially rescued me from a bad situation and was spending his time and money to help me heal and give me some normalcy, all while looking for a new home of his own.

Eventually, I got my own job and, as a result, he bought me a car. Yes, a whole car. Not a new one, a used one, and it wasn't super-expensive, maybe 5k, and he paid for it in full, in cash. (He was working with money he got from the sale of his house, bear in mind.) NGL, I screamed, I cried, and I did a little dance. I was SO happy. Was it the nicest car in the world? No. Was it the nicest gift I had ever received? Hell yeah, it was. TO ME, it was fancy. TO ME, it was new. TO ME, it was a HUGE gesture.

Only, it wasn't a gift. It was a loan. And I was gonna have to repay him for it.

Well. That's still fine. It's a nice car. It runs, it has A/C, and it also has Bluetooth! (This is my first car that's had Bluetooth, leave me alone lmao)

I didn't have to start paying him back immediately, and he gave me a few months of leeway before I started. By then, I was also saving up for my own apartment. Eventually, everything settled into a routine, and I moved into my place. By this time, he had also found a house he liked and was initiating the sale.

At first, I let him store some things in my apartment since it was a bigger space than I intended, and I'm basically all on my own and didn't have any furniture. I had, along the way, collected some furniture, and he moved in while the realtor and the bank settled the paperwork. Yes, lovely sweet potatoes, I know that house-purchasing paperwork between a realtor and a bank shouldn't take 3 whole months, but it, unfortunately, did. The reason is that the realtor was trying to scam him the whole time, and he had to basically vaguely threaten lawsuits and (whatever the realtor equivalent of disbarment is) before she and the bank finally fixed all the paperwork, which the bank had also messed up from previous purchases. I read the emails and overheard the conversations; it was a *whole* hot mess.

Anyway, so at some point during all this, he had kinda moved in. With everything he'd done for me, the least I could do is let him stay on my couch. The RV was slowly breaking down, and he needed access to a good shower and some actual food, among other things. It was eventually moved to the backyard of the house that he was still finalizing the paperwork for (they said it was OK), and he stayed on my couch.

For the most part.

Hanky-panky was a thing again (I didn't ask, but *did* consent), though he still wasn't touchy-feely, didn't sleep with me, didn't hug or hold me (maybe once or twice?), and we didn't really hang out outside of me working on stuff on my computer and him sitting in the same room dinking around on his phone. Oh, and kissing 'wasn't a thing he did.' So, basically, zero affection. Because it's childish or whatever.

But, as he reminded me several times, he wasn't into relationships, this wasn't a romantic thing, and he didn't want a girlfriend or wife or anything. He wanted to just be alone for the rest of his life.

OK, fine.

That didn't stop dudes from giving me their numbers, though.

So, I came home excited because a *handsome* gentleman hit on me and gave me his number. It doesn't happen often because of the severe RBF I have when I'm not in work-mode. I'm not actually a b\*tch, my face is just tired and doesn't want to try, I promise.

Anyway, so first thing I do is start bragging about it to Bruce because, by this point, he's been classified in my brain as a bestie, basically. He's friend-zoned *himself*. I'm laughing and giggling about it, considering if I should even call the guy bc who just hits on a retail worker while on the job, anyway? But he *was* kinda cute-

And Bruce goes OFF. He LOSES his mind. But he doesn't yell, oh no. He has this silent explosion, and I just stop talking while he's getting up, stomping around, and grabbing his wallet and keys. Eventually, he just growls that maybe I *should*, since he apparently means nothing to me.

Wait, what? What is going on?? I pause for just a moment, and it hits me. But...no, way, this dude's far too intelligent and mature...so I ask.

""What, exactly, am I to you?""

""We're together, aren't we? What do you think?""

Since when? Since when did this become a relationship? When did we ever sit down and actually talk about this being a real thing? THE ENTIRE TIME, Bruce was telling me all about how much he DOESN'T want this! What the heck?!

At some point, he leaves, and I'm just left reeling about the whole conversation. He doesn't come back for something close to 12 hours, which he spent at a bar (I learned this later), drinking himself stupid. I wait until the next morning, make sure to make him some coffee and get him some ibuprofen for whatever headache he might have, and wait until he's had some food before I sit him down and talk to him about it.

He said, firstly, that he doesn't subscribe to traditional titles like 'boyfriend' and 'girlfriend' because, to him, it's childish. Secondly, a typical man wouldn't have done all the things that he's done for me if he didn't care *deeply* for the person he's doing them for. And thirdly, if he needed to communicate that we were in a relationship to keep me from 'cheating' on him, then I would have had those tendencies anyway, and there's no point in subjecting himself to that kind of pain again.

My responses were, firstly, too ducking bad because communication isn't childish, and knowing *exactly* where I stand with someone is how I treat them. He's been getting the 'friend' treatment this entire time, not the 'boyfriend' treatment, and if he wants a preview of that, I'd be more than happy to trial that on him (spoiler alert, he hated it! lmao!!!). Secondly, someone who *I* consider to be a ""man"" would help someone regardless of their meaning to them as much as they comfortably could without the expectation of repayment in whatever form that might be. There were lots of things he did for me that I didn't ask for and I didn't feel were necessary for my recovery, but at the time, my opinions of that were skewed. Plus, if he wanted to do them, who was I to stop him? (""No, sir, that's some boyfriend-tier actions and you're only cleared for friend-level actions. You need to upgrade your package before engaging in boyfriend-tier actions."" Kindly what the fork.) And thirdly, SEE FIRSTLY FOR MY RESPONSE ABOUT COMMUNICATION, YOU (#$&(@$&)(%&#\* \*#&$(\*#&$(\*&@ IDIOT.

I got mad about it and I walked out. I was already a teensy bit late for work (think 10 minutes, but my anxiety said 1 hour lol), and from there, lots of stuff went downhill. I won't bore you with the details, but he spent a lot of days drunk off his booty, and I eventually had to kick him out after one of his drunken evenings set off my CPTSD (yay, love that for me...).

But really, am I the AH for not knowing I was in a relationship?

TL;DR: An emotionally stunted man communicates the opposite of how he feels. I understand and act accordingly. Somehow, he thinks we're in a relationship bc of the friend zone. Am I wrong?

I’m currently having very strong negative feelings of his habit of sleeping after his work shift. Let me give you some back story

I work as a barista in a hotel and he is a casino table-games supervisor. 

When we first started living together he had the overnight shift that started at 8:30pm and ended at 5:30am. Whenever he came home he would sleep in and then wake up around 10:30am/12:00 pm. I never had a problem with that because  at the time i had the day shift so by the time i would get home he was already awake and we would do the house things together. Things would get done and we would spend some time together as well. 

Fast forward to today i am 7 months pregnant with a night shift that starts at 2:30pm or 4:00pm and ends around 1am and his current day shift that starts at 4:30am and ends at 1:00pm. We decided that was the best combination so when the baby came we could take shifts on the baby since we dont have a lot of options regarding baby sitting. 

What has been happening is that he gets home at 1pm and then goes to sleep for at least 5/6 hours. If i have a to do list to get done he wakes up and then starts doing some of them. If i didnt give “instructions” he just goes to the gym and then goes to sleep again. And it is pissing me off terribly. 

I am fully aware rest and sleep is incredibly important, and he does some time picks me up from work that is 20 min away from our house. But due to this thing that i see as excessive sleeping (i could be wrong) nothing is getting done and we barely spend any time together not even texting to at least communicate because he spends most of the time sleeping. I know pregnancy doesnt stop anyone and it is not an illness but im incredibly tired, the night shift is very taxing. I don’t drink coffee due to gastritis and HG so i get very little done by myself. Which is also frustrating since i have always been very independent. I cant think as i used to think my mind feels very scattered and to put into a list things to get done or give instructions is hell. I have tried talking to him about this but i receive the “im tired i wake up early to go to work” speech. So i dont know if its me that is asking something unfair or im valid in my negative feelings. 


Edit: i want to clarify that my problem
Is with the amount wasted in the day which is when things need to get done i dont think i would be nearly as bothered if he decided to go to sleep at 5-6pm for example until 3:30am and then go to work. But sleeping at night at around 10:30pm until 3:30am and then again from 1pm to 7:00pm cuts a lot of the time for certain things that have specific timeframes. And a lot of the things never get done things that he is responsible for that i end up doing for him on top of my own things",4,1756854035.0,AITAH,16,1.0,False

# What Makes Affiliate Sales Funnels So Powerful?

Picture this: You're at a party, and someone walks up to you and immediately asks you to marry them. Sounds crazy, right? 

That's exactly what happens when affiliates try to sell products without building relationships first. They skip the courtship phase and wonder why their conversion rates are lower than their morning coffee temperature.

An affiliate sales funnel is your digital courtship process. It's the strategic sequence of touchpoints that transforms curious visitors into loyal customers. Instead of asking for marriage on the first date, you're taking prospects through a natural progression of trust-building and value delivery.

Here's what separates winning funnels from the rest:

**They solve real problems** - Not just promote products for the sake of earning commissions
**They build genuine relationships** - Creating trust before asking for anything in return  
**They provide massive value** - Giving more than they take at every stage
**They guide decision-making** - Making the buying process feel natural and inevitable

But here's the million-dollar question: How do you create these conversion machines?

# The Foundation: Choosing Your Affiliate Arena

Before you can build a funnel that converts, you need to pick your battlefield wisely. This isn't about following the crowd or chasing the highest commission rates - it's about finding your competitive edge.

Most affiliates approach product selection like they're shopping for groceries. They grab whatever looks appealing without considering if it fits their overall strategy. Big mistake.

Here's the strategic approach that separates pros from amateurs:

**Start with passion and expertise** - What topics can you talk about for hours without getting bored? Where do people already come to you for advice? Your natural enthusiasm will shine through in your content, making your recommendations feel authentic rather than forced.

**Analyze market demand** - Use tools like Google Trends, keyword research platforms, and social media listening to understand what people are actually searching for. Are they asking questions about this topic? Are they willing to pay for solutions?

**Evaluate competition levels** - Moderate competition is actually good - it means there's money to be made. But you need to find your unique angle. What perspective can you bring that others haven't explored?

**Consider product ecosystems** - Smart affiliates don't just promote individual products; they promote entire ecosystems. When someone buys a camera, they'll likely need lenses, tripods, editing software, and storage solutions. Think long-term revenue potential.

**Research commission structures** - Look beyond the percentage. A 10% commission on a $2,000 product beats a 50% commission on a $20 product. Also, prioritize recurring commissions whenever possible - they're the closest thing to passive income in affiliate marketing.

# The Psychology Behind High-Converting Funnel Types

Not all funnels are created equal. The type you choose depends on your audience's mindset, your product's price point, and your available resources. Let's break down the three powerhouse funnel types:

## The Education-First Approach

This is perfect when you're promoting complex or high-ticket items. Instead of jumping straight into sales mode, you become the teacher first. 

Think of it like this: You wouldn't trust a surgeon who can't explain the procedure, right? Similarly, prospects won't buy expensive products from someone who can't demonstrate expertise.

Here's how it works: You create a low-cost course or guide that solves a specific problem. Maybe it's a $27 course on ""Instagram Growth Hacks"" that naturally leads to promoting a $497 social media management tool. The course builds trust, demonstrates value, and creates a natural bridge to your main recommendation.

The beauty of this approach? You're getting paid to build your email list and establish authority. Even if someone doesn't buy your main product, you've still generated revenue and created a relationship.

## The Live Demonstration Method

Some products are better shown than told. This is where webinar funnels shine. You're not just describing benefits - you're proving them in real-time.

Picture this scenario: You're promoting a design software. Instead of writing blog posts about its features, you host a live webinar where you create a stunning logo from scratch. Attendees see the transformation happen before their eyes. They experience the ""wow"" moment that static descriptions can't deliver.

Webinars create urgency, allow for real-time objection handling, and leverage social proof through live chat interactions. When someone sees 50 other people asking questions and engaging, they feel part of a community rather than a sales target.

## The Irresistible Offer Strategy

Sometimes the best approach is the simplest one. You remove all the risk from the buying decision by making an offer that's impossible to refuse.

The classic example is the ""free book"" funnel. You offer a physical book for free - prospects only pay shipping costs of $7-12. The book provides incredible value and naturally introduces your main product or service. The small shipping fee qualifies the lead (they're willing to pay something) while the free book creates reciprocity.

This approach works because it feels like getting something for nothing, even though the small shipping fee creates commitment. People value what they pay for, even if it's just a few dollars.

# The Six-Step Funnel Building Blueprint

Now that you understand the psychology, let's dive into the tactical execution. These six steps will transform your affiliate marketing from scattered efforts into a systematic revenue machine.

## Step 1: Define Your Ideal Customer Journey

Most affiliates think they know their audience, but they're operating on assumptions rather than data. This is where many funnels fail before they even begin.

Start by creating what I call ""buyer personas with emotions."" Don't just list demographics - understand the emotional triggers that drive purchasing decisions.

Ask yourself these critical questions:
- What keeps your prospect awake at 3 AM?
- What would they secretly Google when nobody's watching?
- What's the gap between where they are and where they want to be?
- What obstacles have prevented them from solving this problem before?

For example, if you're promoting a fitness program, your prospect might be a working mom who feels guilty about taking time for herself. She's not just buying a workout program - she's buying permission to prioritize her health and a way to feel confident in her own skin again.

Understanding these deeper motivations allows you to craft messages that resonate on an emotional level, not just a logical one.

## Step 2: Map Your Conversion Points

Think of your funnel as a series of micro-commitments. Each step should feel like a natural progression from the previous one.

Here's a practical example: Let's say you're promoting a $997 online course about starting a consulting business. Your micro-commitment sequence might look like this:

**Micro-commitment 1**: Download a free guide about ""5 Common Consulting Mistakes""
**Micro-commitment 2**: Watch a free training video about ""How to Land Your First Client""
**Micro-commitment 3**: Join a free Facebook group for aspiring consultants
**Micro-commitment 4**: Attend a free webinar about ""Building a 6-Figure Consulting Business""
**Micro-commitment 5**: Purchase the full course

Each step builds trust and provides value while naturally leading to the next commitment. The key is making each step feel valuable on its own, not just a setup for the next sales pitch.

## Step 3: Create Your Value-First Content Strategy

Content isn't just about driving traffic - it's about pre-qualifying prospects and building anticipation for your offers.

Instead of creating generic ""top 10"" lists, focus on transformation-based content. Show people the bridge between their current situation and their desired outcome.

For instance, rather than writing ""10 Best Email Marketing Tools,"" create ""How I Grew My Email List from 100 to 10,000 Subscribers in 6 Months (Complete Case Study)."" The second approach tells a story, provides specific results, and creates curiosity about your methods.

Your content should answer these questions:
- What's possible for your audience?
- What's the fastest path to get there?
- What mistakes should they avoid?
- What tools or resources make the journey easier?

Remember, you're not just creating content consumers - you're creating future customers. Every piece of content should move prospects closer to a purchasing decision.

## Step 4: Design Your Capture and Conversion Pages

Your opt-in pages are the gatekeepers of your funnel. They determine whether casual visitors become engaged prospects or bounce back to Google.

Here's the formula for irresistible opt-in pages:

**Clear value proposition** - What specific benefit will they get? Be precise, not vague.
**Compelling headline** - Focus on the outcome, not the features.
**Social proof** - Show that others have benefited from your free offer.
**Minimal friction** - Ask for only the information you absolutely need.
**Strong call-to-action** - Tell them exactly what to do next.

For example, instead of ""Subscribe to Our Newsletter,"" try ""Get the 5-Page Checklist That Helped Sarah Increase Her Conversion Rate by 247% in 30 Days.""

The second version is specific, includes social proof, and clearly communicates the value. It's not just asking for an email address - it's offering a valuable resource.

## Step 5: Build Your Follow-Up Sequence

This is where the magic happens. Most affiliates get an email address and immediately start pitching products. That's like asking someone to marry you on the first date.

Instead, create a nurture sequence that builds relationships first. Here's a proven 7-day sequence structure:

**Day 1**: Welcome and deliver your promised lead magnet
**Day 2**: Share your personal story and why you're passionate about this topic
**Day 3**: Provide additional value related to your lead magnet
**Day 4**: Share a case study or success story
**Day 5**: Address common objections or concerns
**Day 6**: Make your main offer with a compelling story
**Day 7**: Create urgency with scarcity or bonuses

Each email should feel like a conversation with a friend, not a sales pitch from a stranger. Share personal experiences, admit your mistakes, and show the human side of your business.

## Step 6: Test, Optimize, and Scale

Building your funnel is just the beginning. The real profits come from continuous optimization.

Start by tracking these key metrics:
- Opt-in conversion rate (aim for 20-40%)
- Email open rates (aim for 25-35%)
- Email click-through rates (aim for 3-8%)
- Sales conversion rate (varies by price point)
- Customer lifetime value

Don't try to optimize everything at once. Focus on one element at a time. Maybe it's testing different headlines, adjusting your email frequency, or trying new call-to-action buttons.

Small improvements compound over time. A 5% increase in conversion rate might not seem significant, but it can double your profits over a year.

# what are automated trading strategies

automated trading strategies are systematic approaches that use computer algorithms to execute trades without human intervention. instead of manually watching charts and clicking buy/sell buttons, these systems automatically enter and exit positions based on predefined rules and market conditions.

the key difference between automated strategies and manual trading is consistency. humans get emotional, second-guess themselves, and deviate from their plans. 

**algorithms don't.** 

they follow the exact same rules every single time, regardless of whether the last trade was a winner or loser.

# core components of automated trading systems

every effective automated trading strategy consists of three essential elements:

* **entry criteria (where do I enter and how much do I buy)**
* **exit criteria (where do I exit and how much do I sell)**
* **risk management (position sizing, drawdown)**

# why manual trading fails most traders

after working with thousands of traders, I've identified the recurring patterns that destroy discretionary traders. 

# emotional trading

the biggest killer of trading performance isn't market volatility — it's human psychology. this is exactly why automated trading strategies are so effective. traders consistently make the same emotional mistakes:

* taking profits too early when trades move in their favor
* holding losers too long hoping they'll turn around
* revenge trading after a string of losses
* increasing position sizes after wins (overconfidence)
* decreasing position sizes after losses (fear)

automated trading strategies eliminate these emotional decisions entirely. the system follows the same rules whether the last trade was a winner or loser.

inconsistent execution

manual traders rarely stick to their original plan. they modify their strategy mid-trade, skip setups that ""don't feel right,"" or add positions that weren't part of the original plan.

automated trading strategies solve this consistency problem by executing the exact same rules every time, regardless of recent performance or market conditions.

time and attention limitations

if you're like most people, you work a day job. or you have a family. or you're simply just busy throughout the day — and this business can result in missed entry, exit, and take profit signals.

when you create automated trading strategies, you're solving this problem completely. these algos wait for the signals to trigger, and then execute themselves (once you set them up).

you literally won't ever miss a trade again.

# the data behind successful automation

our testing over 18 months with live money provides concrete evidence for automation's effectiveness. these aren't backtested results — this is real money, real slippage, and real market conditions.

ORB algorithm performance on NQ

January 1 - July 31, 2025 results:

* total P&L: +$17,485 (+174.85%)
* total trades: 64
* profitable trades: 73.44%
* profit factor: 2.086
* max drawdown: 18.68%
* average trade duration: 4.2 hours

I referenced this at the beginning of the blog. here's the equity curve image again for you:

# consistency metrics that matter

the most important benefit of automated trading strategies isn't just the returns — it's the consistency. manual traders typically see wild swings in their equity curves. automated trading strategies show much smoother performance patterns.

**this isn't entirely normal — but our ORB strategy has only lost consecutive times twice throughout the year.**

* maximum consecutive losses: 2
* recovery time after max drawdown: 8 trading days

# volume and execution advantages

automated trading strategies capture opportunities that manual traders miss. during high-volatility periods like FOMC announcements, automated trading strategies provide significant advantages:

* execution speed: 1-2 seconds from signal to order
* no hesitation during volatile conditions
* consistent position sizing regardless of recent P&L
* ability to run multiple automated trading strategies simultaneously

# types of automated trading strategies

successful automated trading strategies typically fall into several categories, each with distinct characteristics and optimal market conditions.

at edgeful, we've created 4 different strategies for you to optimize, and then implement.

https://preview.redd.it/pc8b671k0umf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4944aa486fa8f7fcf5332b03342299508cd04b5

1. ORB algo
2. [Initial Balance algo](https://www.edgeful.com/blog/posts/initial-balance-breakout-strategy)
3. [Gap Fill](https://www.edgeful.com/blog/posts/trading-gap-fills) algo
4. [Engulfing Candles](https://www.edgeful.com/blog/posts/engulfing-bars-trading-strategy-profit-targets) algo (new!)

trend following strategies

these automated trading strategies identify and ride sustained price movements in one direction.

opening range breakout (ORB): trades breakouts from the first 15-60 minutes of the trading session. our data shows this strategy works particularly well on NQ in 2025.

initial balance (IB): similar to ORB but uses the first hour's range. particularly effective during trending market conditions with clear session bias, and our data shows ES has been particularly effective in 2025.

mean reversion strategies

these automated trading strategies profit from price returning to average levels after extreme moves. they work best in range-bound markets or during oversold/overbought conditions.

gap fill strategies: trade the tendency for overnight gaps to fill during regular trading hours. our gap fill data shows 67% fill rate for gaps between 0.25% and 1.5%.

# how to build your first automated strategy

building effective automated trading strategies requires a systematic approach. we've done the hard work for you, so all you have to do is follow these steps:

step 1: identify the algo you want to trade

before automating anything, you need a strategy that actually works. this means:

backtest extensively: use at least 2 years of historical data to validate your approach. pay attention to maximum drawdown periods and consecutive losses.

define clear rules: every aspect of your strategy must be objective. ""price looks strong"" isn't a rule. ""price breaks above the previous day's high by at least 0.1%"" is a rule.

optimize for consistency: prefer strategies with 60-70% win rates over those with 90% win rates but occasional large losses. consistent strategies are easier to stick with psychologically.

# step 2: optimize it

* use our reports, the TradingView backtester, and the videos I’ve recorded to dial in the settings
* make sure you would actually trade this strategy manually
* if you wouldn't trade it manually, don't automate it

# step 3: connect your broker

* click ""connect broker"" in the automation section
* read and accept the terms of service (every word matters)
* log in to your broker account
* start with paper trading (this is required)

# step 4: name your strategy

* name your strategy — be specific: ""NQ ORB 5min 0.5R”
* connect it to your broker account
* enable the strategy — this makes it live

# step 5: set up TradingView alerts

* copy the webhook URL from edgeful
* create the alert in TradingView with the exact message format
* make sure it's an open-ended alert so it doesn't expire

# step 6: paper trade it for at least a week

never go live with automated trading strategies until you've tested them thoroughly in a paper trading environment:

* **monitor execution:** verify that orders are being placed correctly and at expected prices.
* **validate performance:** ensure paper trading results match your backtested expectations.

# broker integration and execution

right now, our main supported broker integration is with Tradovate. you can also log into Tradovate if you have a NinjaTrader account using the same log in credentials.

and yes, you can connect your prop firm as long as they integrate with Tradovate/NinjaTrader and check their Terms of Service.

***recommendation:*** *do not use prop accounts with intraday drawdown (drawdown limits on unrealized gains).*

execution considerations

* order types: most automated systems currently use market orders for immediate execution. limit orders are coming but not yet widely available.
* slippage factors: expect 1-3 ticks of slippage on futures during normal market conditions. this increases during high-volatility periods.
* latency requirements: execution delay should be under 2 seconds from signal generation to order placement. longer delays reduce strategy effectiveness.

# risk management for automated systems

automated trading strategies can execute many more trades than manual approaches, making robust risk management even more critical.position sizing mathematics

* fixed fractional: risk the same percentage of account value on every trade. if you risk 1% and your account is $10,000, risk $100 per trade.
* volatility-adjusted: adjust position size based on recent market volatility. increase size during low-volatility periods, decrease during high-volatility periods.
* correlation-adjusted: reduce position sizes when running multiple strategies that might trade similar setups.

drawdown management

* maximum account drawdown: set a threshold (typically 10-20%) where all automated trading stops until manual review.
* strategy-specific drawdown: individual strategies should have their own drawdown limits, typically 5-10% of account value.
* recovery protocols: define specific conditions for resuming trading after hitting drawdown limits.

monitoring and alertsautomated doesn't mean unsupervised. you need systems to monitor performance and alert you to problems:

* daily performance alerts: get notified of daily P&L, number of trades, and any unusual activity.
* system failure alerts: immediate notification if the trading system goes offline or stops responding.
* risk limit alerts: warnings when approaching position size limits, correlation limits, or drawdown thresholds.

# common mistakes and how to avoid them

thousands of traders have shared their automated trading experiences with me. here are the most common mistakes and how to prevent them.mistake #1: automating unoptimized strategies

* the problem: traders automate strategies they've never traded manually or that only work in backtests.
* the solution: manually trade your strategy for at least 30 trades before automation. if you wouldn't trade it manually, don't automate it.

mistake #2: over-optimization

* the problem: continuously tweaking parameters based on recent performance, destroying the strategy's statistical edge.
* the solution: set parameters based on long-term historical data and resist the urge to mess with them frequently. you want to review the parameters at least every month.

# frequently asked questions

what's the minimum account size for automated trading strategies?

for futures trading with automated trading strategies, we recommend at least $10,000 to properly diversify across multiple strategies while maintaining appropriate position sizes. with smaller accounts, you're limited to single-contract positions which increases volatility.

how much time do automated trading strategies require?

once properly set up, automated trading strategies require 15-30 minutes daily for monitoring and review. initial setup and testing of automated trading strategies typically takes 2-4 weeks of part-time effort.

can automated trading strategies work during all market conditions?

no single automated trading strategy works in all conditions. successful automated trading typically involves multiple strategies designed for different market environments (trending vs ranging, high vs low volatility).

what happens if my internet connection fails during trading?

most broker platforms have built-in safeguards including automatic stop losses and position limits. however, you should have backup internet and procedures for manual intervention during system failures.

how do I know if my automated trading strategy is still working?

monitor key performance metrics weekly for your automated trading strategies: win rate, average trade duration, maximum consecutive losses, and profit factor. significant deviations from historical norms may indicate changing market conditions affecting your automated trading strategies.

are there any regulations around automated trading strategies?

retail automated trading strategies are generally unrestricted, but some prop firms have specific rules about automated trading strategies. always check your broker's or prop firm's automated trading policies before implementation.

# key takeaways

look, automated trading strategies aren't magic. they're not going to turn you into a millionaire overnight, and anyone telling you otherwise is lying.but here's what they will do...

* remove the biggest killer of trading performance: your emotions. after working with thousands of traders, I can tell you that 90% of trading failures come from psychological mistakes, not strategy flaws.
* deliver consistent execution: our live testing shows +$17,485 with a 73% win rate over 7 months on NQ. that's not backtested theory — that's real money, real slippage, real market conditions.
* eliminate the ""what if"" game: no more second-guessing entries, no more moving stop losses, no more taking profits too early because you got scared. the algo follows the same rules whether the last trade made $500 or lost $200.
* capture opportunities you'd miss: markets don't wait for you to finish your coffee or get back from lunch. automated trading strategies work while you sleep, while you're at work, or while you're busy with the family.

but you can't just flip a switch and expect to be immediately profitable. successful automation requires:

* a strategy that actually works (test it manually first)
* proper risk management (position sizing matters more than win rate)
* realistic expectations (drawdowns will happen)
* continuous monitoring (automated doesn't mean hands-off)

- The draft law would stop sales in shops, cafés, vending machines and online, but does not affect traditional tea or coffee.
- Current labelling already requires a warning for high‑caffeine drinks; the ban adds a point‑of‑sale prohibition.
- Health officials note that up to a third of UK children drink energy drinks weekly, linking the caffeine to headaches, sleep disturbances, rapid heart rate and, in rare cases, seizures.
- A 12‑week public consultation is open, with similar age‑restriction talks underway in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
- The British Soft Drinks Association argues existing self‑regulation is sufficient, while some retailers have introduced voluntary age checks.
- Health Secretary Wes Streeting says the move will help build “healthier and happier generations,” and chef Jamie Oliver has warned the drinks can contain “three, four shots of espresso” and high sugar.

Why it matters: the ban seeks to curb caffeine‑related health risks in children and provide a clear regulatory framework.
