Watching shows (greys anatomy) but I've seen tons of other shows like friends, Gilmore girls, new girl etc!

I love music (pop and hip-hop and some country) feel free to recommend some!

Photography ( I take food and nature pics) 

I love talking about food and comparing food interests or talking about recipes (trying to get into cooking)

I love animals (I have so many pets!)

And lastly I'm a cake decorator but have a lot of free time on my days off since all I do is mostly stay home and chill there, but always up for texting and getting to know people.

Preceding her diagnosis were at least six months of me begging her to go to the doctor. Her balance has become extremely and she would often fall, her right shoulder was frozen requiring rotator cuff surgery, her reaction time was noticeably slower, and her speech was very quiet and slowed down, with difficulty pronouncing some longer words. People would pull me aside and ask me what was going on and if she was drunk (she does not drink) and I had no answers other than it's not alcohol, because for many months I could not force her to be an advocate for her own health. 

The diagnosis, while shocking to us, gave me an answer to what we had been dealing with for months. I was glad that we could start to mitigate the symptoms. She's been on sinemet since and it provides some help, but not as much as I hoped. She has continued to work even though I've told her that we can afford for her to leave her job, but she is not able to drive so I have to take her to work every morning. We also have 3 very active kids and a busy household. Basically all daily tasks are now falling to me and I work a very demanding job that is more often than not 60 hours a week or more. 

My wife refused to tell anyone, including our kids for 2 months and instead we suffered in silence. One evening, my wife fell in front of our oldest who works in a dementia ward and our oldest said ""Geez, it's just like being at work"" as a joke. They both had a good laugh about that (the oldest of course had no idea about her mom's diagnosis) and I had to leave the room because I was so angry. I finally told my wife that if she would not tell them, I would, and so I did tell them. The rest of the family other than my dad and her mom, have no idea, even 4 months later (but continue to ask questions because they care about her).

I feel so guilty saying this, but every day has been an immense struggle for me. She wants to continue to be independent (carrying a massive backpack, coffee and water bottle down our garage steps with no railing, for example), and I try to respect that, but it can be very dangerous. She fights me about everything - including putting a railing on the steps, redoing the bathroom to make it safer, asking questions of her neurologist, etc. The last visit we had with the neurologist, the doctor asked her how her balance was and she said it was good. I immediately jumped in and said ""You would have fallen two times just coming up to this building if I wasn't right next to you."" The doctor recommends reasonable things like PT and she refuses (because she is doing PT for her shoulder). He recommends that she use a stationary bike for exercise--we have one and I brought it up to our room and she refuses to use it.

Every time I have to run an errand and she wants to come along I have to bottle up my feelings because it will take us at least 10 minutes just to get into the car and every trip is difficult because I have to make sure she isn't going to fall and be embarrassed, or worse, hurt.

I imagine the vacations that I wanted us to take as a family and realize they won't be possible. We take a trip to the beach each year and I'm extremely nervous about that--the logistics of getting her down to the beach and then back to the house.

I tried to get her to try counseling and she refuses. She has emotional breakdowns nearly every day. I've been extremely fortunate that I've been able to take off work for several weeks while we try to adjust, but I will have to go back. Right now I'm down with the flu and still trying to hold everything together. She hates to ask for help and so, while we have family who are willing, I get berated when I do ask for help. As an example, one evening I had to go to my nephew's concert which was a 2.5 hour drive one way (my father, who is in his 70s, promised my nephew he would go and I did not want him driving that distance alone at night). I asked my mother-in-law to come and stay with my wife because she had fallen in her closet the night before and I'm certain she would not have been able to get herself up if I hadn't been right there. My wife derisively told me she does not need a babysitter and was angry with me for a few days. I would do the same thing again so that I didn't have to worry about my 8-year-old having to try to help her mom after she had fallen.

I never imagined that I would need to be a caretaker to my spouse in my mid-40s. I feel like I am now somehow married to someone who is 30 years older than me when we are actually more like 30 days apart in age. Again, I feel horrible for having these thoughts because how can I feel bad for myself when I see what she is going through? 

On the bright side I feel like I have found wells of patience that I never suspected I had. Patience for every day conversations with her, patience as she takes an excruciatingly long time to do anything, patience when I need her to make a call for something, patience as she gets furious with me when she doesn't understand something I'm talking about, patience when she is trying to accomplish something on her phone or the computer, etc. No matter what, I do not show frustration due to her disease and I try to find the balance between respecting her independence and keeping her from harm.

Don't get me wrong, my wife is incredibly difficult, but I love her and I'm with her through thick and thin. At the same time, I'm exhausted. She gets up multiple times in the night to go to the bathroom and, thankfully, she hasn't fallen yet, but I wake up every single time nervous that she will fall but trying to give her the independence that she wants. On top of that, I'm battling the flu and our heat stopped working 2 times during the coldest week of the year last week. 

I know PD is a progressive disease so I will not ask for hope that things get easier. But I'm looking for reassurance that even though the disease progresses, we will get better at managing it than we have been in the first four months.

Swa.Le starring Dileep and Gopika as the lead pair is undoubtedly the cleanest, social relevant Dileep movie in the comedy drama genre.

Philosophical undertones that compliment the movie instead of cringing it, satirical commentry that has aged well with the rising trend of gimmicky news coverage, clean and grounded romance between the lead are the main takeaways i observed.

The most popular comedy of ordering different varieties of tea by rest of the media from Jagathy Sreekumar's shop, followed by coffee by Dileep summarizes the movie as a whole of being original to ourselves and to the truth and to not twist the same story as wish.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

That asshole kept burning the cards to ashes every time I won. 

Ethan, designated as category red, was the closest thing I had to a friend. 

He was a big dude with a surprisingly bigger heart; an ex-high school jock who had become my roomie two years prior. 

I could tell he‚Äôd been popular‚Äîprobably from an affluent family‚Äîso he likely wasn‚Äôt staying long. 

They brought him in one night, kicking and screaming, and strapped him to the bed opposite mine.

For the first few weeks, Ethan wasn‚Äôt allowed to use his hands. 

He sat cross-legged on his bed and told me how he‚Äôd set his entire town alight. 

Sitting in the cremated remnants of his letterman jacket, with his thick brown hair and freckles, he looked like the textbook boy-next-door. 

I thought he‚Äôd be harder to talk to, but he was oddly talkative. 

At first, I thought it was the drugs they force-fed him, but then he became obsessed with telling me his life story.

Apparently, he‚Äôd accidentally burnt his girlfriend‚Äôs eyes out, which somehow led to him attempting to torch his entire town?

I know, I told him it was extra. 

I admit, I was initially pretty scared of the guy. 

It‚Äôs not exactly brainwashing, but the moment we‚Äôre brought into the facility and categorized as lower levels (blue, indigo, and violet), we‚Äôre taught to steer clear of kids categorized at higher levels. 

Those are the ones who need to be muzzled and collared: pyros like Ethan and kids like Carlisle, the girl in the room next to mine. Emma, who could teleport. 

Emma was mostly mute. She was also REALLY bad at chess. 

Carlisle was a Speaker, capable of bringing her own words to life, and super powerful for all of her 17 years on earth. 

She told her guard he was suffering from a brain hemorrhage, and seconds later, he was. 

Carlisle wasn‚Äôt just being held at the YWPA because of her ability. 

She was being protected from world leaders and other ne'er-do-wells who could easily use her for their own personal gain behind closed doors. 

Kids like Carlisle and Ethan were the lost causes. Here one minute, gone the next. 

I half-expected Ethan to disappear one day while I was being tested on, or forcing down mystery meat that passed as cafeteria food.

But it had been almost two years, and pyro boy was still my roommate.

I was category blue, a high-level telekinetic, so it‚Äôs not like we could relate to each other. 

Ethan was more likely to be executed at eighteen due to the severity of his case.

But weirdly enough, I enjoyed his company.

Just like school, the YWPA had a social hierarchy. 

Blues, who were most likely to be recruited for some shady government program, were at the top. JJ and Alex, lower-level blues, had already invited me to join their little gang, but I wasn‚Äôt interested in their weird obsession with becoming soldiers. 

I‚Äôd been brought in at twelve: those kids had been at the YWPA since birth, never seeing sunlight and being subtly conditioned to enjoy the idea of becoming mindless drones for some higher power.

Those types of kids were noticeably more feral and animal-like, baring their teeth when guards grabbed them for daily testing. JJ was already giving me cult-leader vibes. Instead of being scared of his ability, he embraced it. 

Meanwhile, I had a feeling the mandatory Friday classes for low-level blues were screwing with their brains‚Äîmaybe even prepping them for recruitment. Luckily, I was able to avoid it.

It wasn't easy at first. But the second I was dragged into a classroom-like setting, with an ancient analogue television at the front, I knew my fate. 

It was part of being recruited, after all. 

People in the real world weren‚Äôt interested in noncompliant telekinetics. 

They wanted brainless shells. 

There was only one way of getting out of mandatory classes, which were either life lessons for the rare occasion that you would be released, or plain fucking brainwashing. I had no choice but to play the unhinged card‚Äîwhich was risky and could either end with me getting executed or sent to therapy.

So in the cafeteria, I staged a breakdown, pinning several kids to the ceiling. I was taken down almost immediately, of course, and thankfully, instead of ‚Äúmilitary training‚Äù in my schedule, I had ‚ÄúPsychokinetic Therapy.‚Äù 

So, instead of being subjected to what I could only guess was some seriously messed up shit (judging by the rapid decline in the blue‚Äôs humanity), I sat in a room with my personal therapist, who taught me how to manage my power and not abuse it.

Speaking of the other blues, they started being more annoying than usual, sitting at their usual table embedded in a game of silent chess. Which was chess, but nobody talked, and each member used their ability instead of their hands. 

This kind of information has been nailed into my brain since my imprisonment inside the YWPA, so I know the nitty gritty of the category blue. 

When you're categorised as blue, you can either be a low level or a high level. 

Low levels can do simple telekinesis, which is moving or controlling an object or organic matter with their mind. 

High levels, however, can extend their ability to the brain. 

That's one of the reasons why blues are so popular in recruitment. 

Whereas low levels are wanted for their simple ability to move objects, high levels are in demand for their ability to control minds, like influencing or erasing memories, and in some cases, managing a complete take-over of the original organic personality. As a high level, I knew my day was coming sooner or later. 

I couldn't fully master what we called Influence yet, but I did successfully manage to push my instructor to punch me in the face, and then erase his memory of performing that action. 

Which meant I was extremely close to being recategorized at a higher level. Which meant re-evaluation. 

It was Tuesday, which was a free day. 

Nepo babies were allowed monitored time with their parents, while the rest of us had to keep up appearances in front of the elites, pretending we were having the best time ever and definitely weren‚Äôt being abused and tested on. 

I mean, if these people were as perceptive as they thought, they‚Äôd notice the blood stains. Right?

The velcro straps on every bed. The execution room, which was just one big industrial furnace.

Every time someone was burned alive, the YWPA played Taylor Swift at full volume.

When I was thirteen, I was being dragged back to my room in cuffs after standardized testing. I remember the right side of my body was numb and my nose was bleeding, beads of warm red dripping down my chin. It itched as it dried, but I couldn't do much about it. 

The drugs were already destabilizing my limbs, making it impossible to run, my vision swimming in and out of focus. All I could see were clinical white walls crashing into me like ocean waves.

I wasn‚Äôt expecting to hear Taylor Swift. 

I can‚Äôt remember what song it was, just the same lyrics repeating as I was dragged down the hallway toward a bright orange blur.

‚ÄúMove,‚Äù my guard ordered, shoving me forward. 

That song followed me all the way back to my room. 

When I was freed from my cuffs and shoved inside, I layed down and pretended I couldn't hear the agonizing screams from adjacent cells slicing through those lyrics. 

I had pretty much accepted my fate as either ending up in there, being fucking barbecued to an upbeat pop song, or joining my fellow blues as a military drone. 

I didn't even fucking dream of walking out of the YWPA on my own two feet. 

With my mind intact, at least.

Christmas in the YWPA was about as fun as you would expect. 

There was a single Christmas tree themed sticker on the wall for a ‚Äúdecoration.‚Äù 

But I wasn't even sure if some kids even knew what Christmas was. 

Jessa, who was executed three days after her arrival, asked JJ if he wanted to do a secret Santa, and the boy looked at her like she'd grown a second head. Jessa was another scary one, a category *grey*. 

Her ability was similar to a Speaker, but on a mass scale. So, you can imagine how fucking terrifying she was. 

But she didn't look scary, she looked harmless! Jessa was tiny with orange pigtails and a gentle smile.

As cute and innocent as she looked though, Jessa could obliterate our universe if she wanted to. 

She could also prevent war if she wanted to. The rumor mill churned, and I heard from an Indigo, that Jessa had snapped her own family out of existence. 

But Jessa used her power for small things. She wanted a puppy, and bam, there was one in her lap. 

She wanted a swimming pool, and suddenly, a whole new indoor pool hall just appeared at the end of the first floor. 

She was both a miracle and a curse, and I don't think the YWPA trusted her‚Äì and others were out there hunting her down. 

Jessa was only there for three days, but had left an impression. 

The swimming pool, for example. It's not like we could use it, but it was still there. 

The white plastic seat where she'd sat cross-legged, eagerly asking people's names, sat sadly empty. 

Back to the card game. 

I was losing patience with Ethan, who thought burning my cards would make him a winner. 

The worst part is, he was actually making me laugh, shooting me a grin every time my Queen burst into flames. 

It was funny the first few times, but was getting progressively less entertaining. 

He was like, ‚ÄúHa! Look how funny this is!‚Äù

I laughed the first few times, but by the eighth time, I was questioning his maturity. 

When the large metal doors to the rec-room flew open, Ethan flinched, his gaze glued to his half cremated deck of cards. 

He was about to turn the big one eight, which meant his evaluation was soon.

Execution, or, if they were feeling merciful, maybe a re-sentencing until he was twenty five.

I kicked him under the table when he didn't lay down his cards. 

Ethan kicked me back, his eyes growing frenzied. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù He whispered, his gaze dropping to the table. ‚ÄúI bet they've come for me.‚Äù

I kicked him again, this time reassuringly. ‚ÄúYou're still seventeen, dumbass.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but not for long!‚Äù

I raised a brow. ‚ÄúWhy would they kill you at seventeen?‚Äù

He curled his lip. ‚ÄúBecause they're assholes.‚Äù

Leaning across the shitty fold out table, I fixed him with a smile. ‚ÄúWhat if you're fire-proof?‚Äù

‚ÄúFireproof?!‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right, listen up!‚Äù

The voice snapped me out of it. 

Twisting around, Warden Carrington stood in the doorway, twirling a pair of metal cuffs. 

She was a stiff, narrow bodied woman with a blonde top-knot and a permanent grin. 

She took pleasure in escorting kids to be executed. Something sour crept up my throat. 

Is that what this was? 

No, executions were usually private. 

Tests, maybe? 

I was used to mandatory ones every Friday. That's what the cuffs were usually for. We were taken from the rec room individually, cuffed, and dragged to the testing rooms. But it wasn‚Äôt Friday. 

The floors were too clean. I was used to blood seeping across tiles on a testing day. 

I wasn't allowed to look the warden in the eye as a Blue, but I managed a risqu√© glance. She was smiling suggestively, so it had to be an execution. Realization crept in then, that the slight curl on her lip suggested exactly the opposite. 

Recruitment.

I scanned the room.  

Fifteen fearful faces stared at her.  

A willowy blonde who had previously been reading a dog eared paperback, was now sitting up straight, her half-lidded eyes wide, almost awake. She caught my gaze, lips pricking into a smile. 

Slowly, the girl inclined her head, a single blonde curl falling into her eyes. She ran her index finger across her throat, mouthing, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fucked.‚Äù

Could it be Matthews? 

My gaze flicked to the brunette curled up in the corner of the room. Carlisle? I used to talk to her. We were from the same town, so we had that mutual connection. 

But something happened to her after a testing session, and since then, Carlisle shut everyone else out and isolated herself. 

Matthews was immortal, and Carlisle had the power to end the world. 

I doubted either of them were being recruited.

‚ÄúThe holidays came early, kids!‚Äù Warden Carrington mocked, and I sensed the group of us all holding a collective breath. 

‚ÄúJohnson!‚Äù she boomed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre getting out of here!‚Äù

There was an awkward silence before Ethan kicked me. 

‚ÄúBro, that's you!‚Äù

He was right. Slowly, I got to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. 

I was Johnson. 

Which was crazy, because the only kids who made it out of the YWPA alive were either nepo babies or‚Ä¶ 

My excitement started to wither once I'd hugged Ethan a quick goodbye, and offered Carlisle a sympathetic smile. 

I thought, just for a moment, that maybe my Mom had come to get me‚Äì finally, after five years. But my mother was dead. 

I watched a man who called himself Mr. Yellow blow her brains out with a smile, before kneeling in front of me. 

I was standing in my mother‚Äôs blood, watching slow-spreading crimson seeping across her favorite rug.  

‚ÄúHey, there, little boy,‚Äù he said, his eyes maniacal, grin widening. ‚ÄúDo you want to come to a super special place?‚Äù

The ‚Äòsuper special‚Äô place was obviously the YWPA.

I didn't even get to fucking mourn my mother. 

And to everyone in the outside world, twelve year old Johnson had murdered his Mom. 

The outside world has no idea about our abilities, or the YWPA. 

So, to them, I was yet another psycho kid. 

There were only two ways to get out of YWPA: in a body bag, or the other way‚Äîthe one I dreaded.

Warden Carrington was smiling with way too many teeth when I slowly made my way over to her. She grabbed my arms, linking them behind my back and cuffing me. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been recruited!‚Äù

I was dragged out the door and down the hallway. 

At the end, surprisingly, stood a guy, around college age. He was tall, a pair of raybans pinning back dark blonde hair, wearing a long trench coat that hung off his slim frame. In his hand was a small paper bag he was swinging excitedly. 

The closer I was getting, being unceremoniously pushed forward by the warden, the guy‚Äôs swinging became more and more eager. 

I was convinced he was going to accidentally fling the bag in my face. 

I wasn't expecting to be recruited by a teenager resembling a teen Sherlock Holmes.

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù He greeted me, genuinely excited to see me. The boy motioned for the warden to uncuff me, and she did, making sure to keep hold of my arms, her bony fingers pricking into my flesh. 

‚ÄúIt's great to finally see you in person! I‚Äôve been trying to get you out of here for weeks! But there's so much paperwork, and blah, blah, blah, it was a whole mess,‚Äù he rolled his eyes. 

‚ÄúBut here you are!‚Äù His southern accent was already irritating. He grabbed my shoulders with teary eyes like I was a stray fucking cat he had just adopted. 

‚ÄúYou're Johnson, right? I'm Nathaniel!‚Äù he held out the bag, and I caught the unmistakable smell of fried food. 

‚ÄúDo you want Five Guys?‚Äù

Warden Carrington cleared her throat. ‚ÄúNot in here,‚Äù she drawled, ‚ÄúThe smell will wake up Will.‚Äù

Will was a higher level category yellow (a shifter). But I fully understood why. 

Werewolf. 

Apparently, he'd been sacrificed to the moon during his frat‚Äôs hazing ritual, gaining the ability to shift his flesh to a dog-like beast. As well as adapting a liking for human flesh. There were two incidents with Will, and both of them ended in him cannibalizing at least three inmates. 

Nathaniel looked intrigued, but he kept his mouth shut. I was handed a fresh set of clothes to change into, before being shoved through the main doors. 

I couldn't believe I was actually breathing in real, ice-cold air.

I could feel it tickling my cheeks, blowing my hair out of my eyes.

In the real world, I stuck out like an anomaly in my clinical white shorts and tee.

I was standing on concrete, uneven and gritty beneath my shitty converse. 

Twisting around, I stared up at the YWPA‚Äîa looming glass building. 

We were in the middle of nowhere. 

I hadn‚Äôt noticed on my way into YWPA because I was blindfolded. 

Nathaniel pointed across the parking lot. There was only one car, and it was his: an expensive, sleek-looking Range Rover. 

I tried to jump into the back, but he patted the passenger seat. 

Nathaniel slid into the driver's side. ‚ÄúSo, there are, like, actual werewolves in that place?‚Äù

I shot him a look, resisting the urge to roll my eyes. I didn‚Äôt know why he was fascinated with werewolves when there were kids in there who could snap us out of existence if they were slightly annoyed. 

‚ÄúWell, there's Will.‚Äù I said, shrugging. ‚ÄúThen there's Rowan, the leader of their pack.‚Äù 

He looked intrigued. ‚ÄúSo, these kids are like, what, *original* werewolves?‚Äù he snorted. ‚ÄúThat's what was in the report.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWill told me he was sacrificed.‚Äù

His eyes widened. ‚ÄúWait, like, to *what*, though?‚Äù

When I didn't reply, he blew a raspberry. ‚ÄúDamn. Keeping me on edge! I *like* it.‚Äù

Slipping onto the warm leather seats, my muscles started to relax. I was so used to the harsh, shitty plastic chairs in the YWPA rec room.

And then there were the blood-stained metal gurneys I had to sit on during testing.

But this‚Äîthis was an actual *seat.* 

I had missed cars. 

I‚Äôd missed being able to sink into cushions.

To relax.

Nathaniel started the car, cranking up the radio.

Taylor Swift.

Not just Taylor Swift, but that exact same song they incinerated inmates to. 

He shot me a grin, reaching into the back and grabbing the bag of Five Guys.

‚ÄúHungry?‚Äù

I was.

I ate the burger in two bites and almost choked on the soda.

‚ÄúDude,‚Äù Nathaniel chuckled, side-eyeing me. ‚ÄúThe food isn‚Äôt going to run away!‚Äù

Asshole.

I started inhaling the fries, ignoring his little jab.

‚ÄúI can understand, though. Of course you‚Äôre fucking hungry,‚Äù Nathaniel said, his gaze flicking to the road ahead. 

I couldn‚Äôt resist pressing my head against the window, slurping my Coke. 

The vivid red and orange blur of traffic flying past was making me carsick. 

‚ÄúI know what goes on inside that place. The inhumane shit they do to kids like you.‚Äù

‚ÄúKids like *me*.‚Äù I stopped chugging, a sour bite to my tone.

He sighed. ‚ÄúYou know that's not what I meant.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

I caught his expression darken significantly, his fingers tightening around the wheel.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Johnson,‚Äù he said, his tone cracking slightly. ‚ÄúFor what those assholes did to you. I fought to get you out of that place.‚Äù he scoffed. ‚ÄúThey kept trying to shove another kid in my face, but I told them it was either you, or I was out of there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù I didn't turn around to look at him, my gaze stuck to blurry holiday lights flying past us. 

They were too bright in contrast to the darkening sky. 

Nathaniel didn't respond, cranking up the radio. 

I wasn't buying this guy‚Äôs friendly act. I had a hard time believing his ‚Äòsave the children‚Äô bullshit.  ‚ÄúSo, what do you need me for?‚Äù I asked, making myself comfy throwing my legs up on the dashboard. 

‚ÄúConstruction? Did your cat get stuck up a tree?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù His lips curled into a smirk. ‚ÄúDo you know what day it is?‚Äù

I gestured to an illuminated snowman outside. 

‚ÄúEaster.‚Äù I deadpanned, and he broke into giggles. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry, how old are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeventeen.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEighteen, in January.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're funny, Johnson,‚Äù he chuckled, like we were best friends. ‚ÄúI'm actually sixteen.‚Äù 

I scoffed. ‚ÄúYou're not.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am! I just *look* older because of the trench coat and shades.‚Äù he shot me a grin. ‚ÄúAnd it's clearly *working*! Dude, you totally thought I was, like, a junior in college.‚Äù Nathaniel sighed, leaning back in his seat. ‚ÄúI've been told I have a ‚Äúbaby face‚Äù,  sooo I dress like a boomer.‚Äù

This guy was making it hard for me to not like him. 

But I was taken off guard when he drove me to the airport. 

Nathaniel threw his jacket over my shoulders, looking me up and down. 

‚ÄúAll right, you're good,‚Äù he ruffled my hair. ‚ÄúLuckily for you, kids our age literally wear anything. So, yes, you may look like you've been institutionalized, but my coat gives you a hipster vibe, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

I had no idea what he was talking about. He sounded like an Animal Crossing character. 

‚ÄúI don't have an ID,‚Äù I managed to hiss out when he pulled me into the airport. 

It was surprisingly quiet for Christmas Eve. 

I expected to be questioned about my lack of passport and identity,  but Nathaniel, despite his age and lack of maturity, could easily pull me right through security with a flash of his badge. 

He gestured to a nearby coffee store, handing over way too many bills for a drink. 

‚ÄúFlat white, and a bottle of water,‚Äù he said hurriedly, swiping through his phone. ‚ÄúFeel free to go crazy. Get as much as you want.‚Äù

I had almost 500 dollars pressed into my palm. 

So, yes, I went crazy. 

I almost turned and ran, taking the cash with me. 

But my Mom was dead. There was no home to go back to. 

I bought a double chocolate brownie hot cocoa to go, and turkey and stuffing sub, devouring both of them before I even left the store. Nathaniel was waiting for me. 

He sipped his flag-white, leading me straight past the gate. When a guard stepped in front of us, he shot them a smile. ‚ÄúIt's cool, we‚Äôre exceptions,‚Äù he said. 

The guard paused before nodding and stepping aside. 

‚ÄúHave a good flight,  boys,‚Äù his lips broke out into a grin, ‚ÄúOh, and happy holidays!‚Äù

Nathaniel winked at the man, smirking. ‚ÄúYou too, Bobby!‚Äù

I couldn't resist opening my mouth. ‚ÄúHow did you‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Nathaniel just grinned.

I was expecting first class seats, but instead, I was ushered onto a private jet. 

So, Nathaniel was riiiiiich, rich. I had a bed as a seat. 

I slept for most of the flight, dreaming I was back in the YWPA, back on my blood stained mattress counting ceiling tiles. 

*‚ÄúSo, how is it?‚Äù*

Ethan loomed over me with his arms folded. The startling white of his shorts and tee made my eyes hurt. 

I didn't blink, stretching out my stiff legs. His voice was kind of muffled. 

‚ÄúIt's okay, I guess,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI had Five Guys.‚Äù

Ethan pulled a face, tipping his head back. 

*‚ÄúUgh. Don't. I‚Äôm pretty sure they gave us recycled slop for dinner.‚Äù*

I rolled onto my side. ‚ÄúWas it the chef's special macaroni and cheese?‚Äù

*‚ÄúYep.‚Äù* Ethan curled his lip. *‚ÄúThey're trying to fucking kill us with the food.‚Äù*

I nodded, enjoying my ex roommate‚Äôs company. 

Though I wasn't sure why he was pacing up and down. 

‚ÄúThe second I‚Äôve built up this guy‚Äôs trust, I‚Äôll get you guys out of there.‚Äù

I felt my heart squeeze, and I swallowed sour tasting puke. ‚ÄúBefore you turn eighteen. I'll get you out of there.‚Äù

Ethan frowned, leaning closer, his brows furrowed like bugs. 

I blinked rapidly. 

Like tiny wiggling little furry bugs. 

‚ÄúDude.‚Äù I was pretty sure there weren't supposed to be two Ethan‚Äôs. The two Ethans leaned forward. ‚ÄúCan't you smell that?‚Äù

I could. 

It was potent, like bleach, suffocating my throat. 

Ethan jerked back, his eyes were wide. *‚ÄúThat smells like‚Äì‚Äù*

Reality slammed into me, but my eyes were glued shut. 

I knew exactly what it smelled like. 

I didn't even remember getting off of the plane. 

I  woke up, groggy, in the back of an SUV, my mouth full of metallic ick. 

I tried to move, and I couldn't, my arms reduced to sausages. 

I thought back to the water I sipped on the plane. How it tasted a little too bitter. 

‚ÄúDid you drug me?‚Äù I managed to get out in a hiss. 

I couldn't even panic, my body was paralyzed, my chest heaving, my heavy pants into thick leather seats were suffocating me. 

Nathaniel‚Äôs laugh sounded like waves crashing into my skull. 

The car took a sharp turn, and I almost tumbled off of the seat. 

‚ÄúIt's just a small job, Johnson,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre counting on you.‚Äù

It took all my strength to drag myself to the window. 

I could see my breath coming out in clouds of white, tiny white flurries dancing across the pane. 

Snow. 

The drugs were fucking with my head. I slipped in and out of consciousness, dancing between the living and the dead. 

Ethan was sitting next to me, his head pressed against the window. ‚ÄúHow do you even get out of shit like this? he tried the door, slamming his fists against the door. 

*‚ÄúLocked,‚Äù* he said. 

I managed a spluttered laugh. ‚ÄúNo shit.‚Äù I caught myself. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck do I do?‚Äù

Ethan shrugged, his gaze glued to the snowstorm. *‚ÄúMaybe try diving out of the car?‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhen it's locked?!‚Äù

Before I could lecture Ethan on basic common sense, the real world slammed into me in waves of ice water‚Äì literally. 

Someone had opened my door, and I could feel the wind chill grazing the back of my neck. 

I opened my eyes when two muscled arms wrapped around me and yanked me out of the car. I couldn't stand, immediately falling limp in his grasp. 

‚ÄúCome on, Johnson,‚Äù Nathaniel‚Äôs voice tickled my ear. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nearly there.‚Äù

I wasn't sure were ‚Äòthere‚Äô was. I was up to my knees in snow, blurred white closing in on me from every angle. With my body immobile, Nathaniel dragging me felt fucking dehumanising. He forced my head up, but it kept hanging, my thoughts dancing, my eyes flickering. 

‚ÄúIt's a simple job,‚Äù he said when I was more awake. 

In front of me was‚Ä¶ something. 

It reminded me of a warehouse, a towering structure that almost looked like it was part of the storm. Nathaniel pulled me further, chuckling. When I parted my lips to cry out, he promptly slammed his hand over my mouth. 

‚ÄúDo the job well, Johnson, and we‚Äôll think about taking you on full time.‚Äù

We reached a garage-like door, and with the click of a button, it was slowly gliding upwards. 

To my surprise, this place reminded me of a reception area inside a dentist. 

The floor was carpeted, a cosy lounging area filled with expensive looking sofas, and a TV playing what looked like an old cartoon. 

There was a desk, a short blonde wearing a Christmas hat sitting behind a laptop. 

‚ÄúNate.‚Äù she deadpanned, her gaze stuck to the laptop screen. ‚ÄúDid you get him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Stella,‚Äù Nathaniel‚Äôs tone pricked with sarcasm. ‚ÄúAs you can see, I definitely don't have him.‚Äù

The girl nodded slowly. ‚ÄúCooooooool.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúGood talk.‚Äù

Ignoring Stella, Nathaniel pulled me into an elevator. 

When the doors slid shut, I found my voice, pulling from his grasp, but my body was stiff and wrong. I dropped to my knees, shuffling back. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this place?‚Äù

The boy didn't answer, leaning against the door, his lips curled into a smirk. 

‚ÄúIt's a super special place.‚Äù

Something sickly crept up my throat. He was mimicking Mr Yellow‚Äôs words. 

My mother‚Äôs murderer. 

When the elevator slid open with a loud groan, the first thing I saw was intense clinical white light. 

The room reminded me of a surgical theatre that had long since been abandoned, flickering lights swinging overhead. I saw the first splatter of blood on the floor right in front of my feet. 

I've grown desensitised to blood over the years, but this was more than a splatter,  a dark crimson streak trailing all the way to the center of the room. There were four plastic chairs positioned in a circle. 

When I glimpsed velcro restraints hanging off of the arm rests, I felt my body start to twist and contort in a desperate attempt to escape. 

Two chairs were occupied by kids my age, metal helmets strapped to their heads; a strawberry blonde girl with her head bowed, her lips and chin stained scarlet. 

She was limp in the restraints, her body hanging forward.

Opposite her was a guy, slumped over, hiding behind thick brown curls. 

There was a growing pool of red stemming around him. 

When he lifted his head, I had to fight back a cry. 

The guy‚Äôs eyes were pearly white, half lidded, all of the color drained from his iris. I recognized it. 

I had only ever heard of a kid‚Äôs power burning out through word of mouth. 

I had been taught that our abilities were like a muscle, and like a muscle, you could strain it. The first symptom of burnout was losing all the color in your eyes, but this guy was in the later stages. 

Judging by seeping red oozing from every orifice, he had already suffered multiple haemorrhages. 

My gaze found the helmet on his head. 

They kept bringing him back, forcing his body to revive again and again, purging his power for all it had. His lips were cracked, slick scarlet. I couldn't tell what his ability he possessed, or his level. Just that he was suffering. ‚ÄúYou've gotta be‚Ä¶ fucking‚Ä¶ kidding me,‚Äù he sobbed. 

‚ÄúLucas, it's Christmas.‚Äù Nathaniel mockingly scolded. ‚ÄúI told you about profanity.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo fuck yourself.‚Äù

Nathaniel forced me to stand. ‚ÄúAll right, introductions!‚Äù he said cheerfully. 

‚ÄúGuys, this is Johnson.‚Äù 

The strawberry blonde jolted in her chair, but she couldn't lift her head. ‚ÄúHe's going to be helping us today.‚Äù

I cringed away when he patted me on the back. ‚ÄúJohnson! This is Luke and Tory! High level blues, and my favorite little helpers.‚Äù

Nathaniel shoved me into a chair, a metal helmet forced onto my head. Nathaniel knelt in front of me, his eyes sparkling. 

Insanity, I thought dizzily. But there was something beyond that, a darkness shrouded in his eyes that he didn't want me to see. He pinned my wrists to the armrests, offering me a smile. ‚ÄúYour job,‚Äù he murmured in my ear. ‚ÄúIs *my* old job.‚Äù

He straightened up. ‚ÄúYou see, we kept failing,‚Äù his expression twisted. ‚ÄúEvery fucking year we failed, and more of us died. We couldn't do it. No matter how hard we tried, none of us were strong enough.‚Äù

I fought back, and with a simple twist of his wrist, my body was paralyzed. 

He was strong. 

‚ÄúI was the best we had,‚Äù Nathaniel sighed. ‚ÄúThey took me from the YWPA in Vancouver. I was just a kid. Eight, maybe? I was dragged inside this room, forced into one of these fucking chairs, and my brain was fried over and over again, until I was numb,‚Äù he choked out a hysterical giggle. 

‚ÄúI stopped feeling pain around the tenth or twelvth time those bastards brought me back. But it was okay, because I could do it. I was the only one who COULD fucking do it, so why not use me for all I have?‚Äù

Was he‚Ä¶ crying? 

Nathaniel swiped at his eyes with his sleeve, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúAnyway, then the demand grew, and it was suddenly so much fucking harder to control, or even lift off the ground. I was tortured in an attempt to strengthen my power, but I couldn't do it. I guess you could say I wasn't strong enough.‚Äù

Nathaniel‚Äôs smile widened. ‚ÄúBut you guys are!‚Äù he started to clap. ‚ÄúSo much stronger than me! I mean, you're amazing. Luke, who turned his family into his personal minions! You truly have a *gift*.‚Äù

I could hear the envy dripping from his tongue. 

The blonde let out a whimper, her bound hands jerking. 

His gaze found mine. 

‚ÄúJohnson.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúWhat you did to get yourself in the YWPA was quite remarkable! Honestly, I bow down to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù Luke  whispered, spitting blood on the floor. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I *can't* do‚Ä¶it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, guess what? It's your lucky day, Lucas, because you have help now!‚Äù 

Nathaniel danced over to him, patting his helmet. When the boy lunged at him, he spluttered. ‚ÄúOoh, bad dog! What did I fucking say about using your teeth?‚Äù

Lucas didn't respond, and I noticed the glint in Nathaniel‚Äôs eyes. He wasn't just crazy. This asshole revelled in being in  control. ‚ÄúSoo, over the last few years, we‚Äôve always focused on movement,‚Äù he twisted around, winking at me. 

‚ÄúNow that, my fellow freaks, was a big mistake.‚Äù

A large wooden contraption was dragged in.

‚ÄúBecause why focus on movement?‚Äù Nathaniel continued. ‚ÄúWhen we have something even better?‚Äù

I recognized what it was. 

The holiday lights strung across the back seat.  

The back, filled with sacks overflowing with wrapped gifts and toys. 

But something told me this was a front for something far darker. 

‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù Nathaniel shouted to someone above us. ‚ÄúLet's do a test run, all right? Everyone in position?‚Äù

‚ÄúNate.‚Äù Tory‚Äôs strangled cry sliced through the silence. She whipped her head back, her eyes rolling back to pearly whites. ‚ÄúYou're going to kill us!‚Äù

Ignoring her, he turned to me. 

‚ÄúHow many people have you taken over, Johnson?‚Äù 

Nathaniel came closer, his eyes narrowing, lips curving into a spiteful smile. ‚ÄúHow many minds can you force yourself inside?‚Äù

His question sent prickles of ice slipping down my spine. 

I hadn't answered that question in a long time. I was too scared to. 

‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù I managed to get out. 

‚ÄúAww, come on!‚Äù Nathaniel cocked his head. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ a million?‚Äù he wagged his brows. ‚ÄúTwo million?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn't mean to,‚Äù the words were choking my throat before I could stop them. I didn't realize how right the chair felt, the restraints, until I was reminded that I really was a fucking monster. ‚ÄúI was just a kid.‚Äù

Nathaniel‚Äôs expression softened, his lip twisting. ‚ÄúI know you were,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo was I when I told my pops to off himself.‚Äù he frowned. ‚ÄúWhich begs the question,‚Äù he hummed. ‚ÄúYou're a category blue at one of the highest levels, and yet the guys back at the YWPA decided not to toast you‚Äì‚Äù

It looked like he might continue, before a yell cut him off. 

‚ÄúNate, we‚Äôre all ready!‚Äù 

It sounded like Stella, from upstairs. ‚ÄúI just need your go ahead!‚Äù

Nathaniel didn't respond for a moment.

He slowly made his way over to me, fixing my helmet on my head, and checking my restraints. I thought he was sympathetic, or maybe he was, in his own fucked up way. But then he was running his hands through my hair, grabbing a fistful, and forcing me to look at him. 

His eyes terrified me. Not because of his ability, or his descent into madness. 

But because somewhere, deep, deep down, twisted in traumatised eyes filled with agony, I think part of him didn't even want to do this. 

‚ÄúWhat you did, Johnson,‚Äù he whispered, ‚ÄúFifteen years ago. I want you to do it again.‚Äù 

Turning to the others, the boy grinned. 

‚ÄúHow many children are on the planet, hmm? How many of them believe in the big guy?‚Äù

I didn't notice it at first. 

The pain. It was numb first, dull, like a phantom nothing dancing across my skull. 

It was like being hit by lightning an infinite number of times. 

Each one hit the back of my head, burning a hole inside it. 

I didn't realize I was screaming, crying, choking on my blood  begging for mercy. 

When I was a kid, it almost felt like drowning. I didn't feel pain, instead, a stark numbness taking hold of me, and the crushing weight of names, wishes, memories, thoughts, bleeding inside me. 

Back then, I barely grazed their minds. I just gave them an order, and they did it. 

Then I let go, plunging down, down, down, and awakening in my mother‚Äôs arms. 

This time, I found each and every one. Ones that had grown up with me, and ones that were much younger, entangling myself with them. I could feel my brain coming apart, bleeding, running down my temples, and seeping down the back of my neck. ‚Äú2.4 billion,‚Äù Nathaniel said. 

‚ÄúThat's 2.4 billion minds to give one simple order.""

That they would never even know they were giving. 

*Fly.* 

The word twisted on my lips, but that was more prominent inside my mind. 

Whatever was on my head, the helmet strapped to my skull, I could feel it moulding itself to my spinal chord, a screech ripping from my lips. 

I was burning, suddenly, my brain igniting, my body jerking left and right. 

I could already feel wet warmth running from my nose, my lips, my ears, every vessel inside me coming apart, a neutron star collision dancing across the backs of my eyes. The command was already inside my head. 

Our heads. 

I could sense and feel, almost touch Luke‚Äôs mind. 

Tory was harder, fading in and out, her body was already failing, already rejecting it. 

In front of me, the wooden contraption moved slightly, and Lucas‚Äôs head dropped. 

When it started to hover, Tory‚Äôs scream grew feral, animalistic, her cries growing into pleads, begging for death. 

The sleigh had taken flight, hovering above us. 

But I couldn't sense Luke anymore. 

That entangled string binding us together, had been cut. Through half lidded eyes, I think he was moving, his fingers still twitching under velcro straps. 

But the sleigh was flying, and despite the agony ripping through me, my body slowly shutting down, my mouth became a smile. 

I was aware of my head going limp, all of me slumping, my head tipping back. 

‚ÄúThat's right!‚Äù Nathaniel‚Äôs voice was fading. ‚ÄúMake it flyyyyyyyyyy.‚Äù

Yeah, I thought, unable to resist a spluttered giggle. 

I was making Santa fly.

After three test runs, and then the real thing, spluttering on my last gasps of air. 

I was partially aware of Nathaniel lifting me from the chair and dumping my body somewhere cold, somewhere where the ice cold chill was merciful on my soul. 

Dying felt weirdly comfortable, kind of like falling asleep. 

I always thought I would die on a surgical table, my body used for research. 

Or burned to ashes in the incinerator. 

Almost death was‚Ä¶ cozy. 

*‚ÄúI'm, like, really freakin‚Äô warm.‚Äù*

Ethan‚Äôs voice pricked into my mind, and I found myself side by side with him.

He was lying on something ice cold, his wrists strapped down. 

I didn't know what to say, so I rolled onto my back, ‚ÄúWell, I'm pretty sure I'm dying.‚Äù 

*‚ÄúBut you're dying in a cool way.‚Äù* Ethan chuckled. *‚ÄúDriving freakin‚Äô Santa's sleigh. That's one hell of a way to go out, right?‚Äù*

‚ÄúMmm.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAlso, of hypothermia.‚Äù

I noticed where we were, sitting up, my head hitting the ceiling. 

Wherever we were was too narrow and claustrophobic. 

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù I hissed, kicking the ceiling. ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù

*‚ÄúI‚Äôd‚Ä¶ rather not answer that,‚Äù* Ethan said, shooting me a sickly smile. *‚ÄúCan we just‚Ä¶ talk?‚Äù*

I pretended not to see the ignition of oranges getting brighter and brighter. 

Closer and closer. 

‚ÄúSure.‚Äù I said, swallowing a cry. ‚ÄúWe can‚Ä¶ talk.‚Äù 

*""Carlisle escaped today,‚Äù* he murmured, after a moment. *‚ÄúSo, expect the world to get a whole lot fucking crazier with her free.‚Äù*

Those were words I really did not want to hear. 

Still, though. With Carlisle free, maybe anything was possible. 

The orange blur was growing bigger, and I squeezed my eyes shut. 

I had to wake up, to get out the snow. To live. Because I was going to freeze to death. 

But I didn't want to leave him. 

*‚ÄúMerry Christmas, Johnson,‚Äù* Ethan murmured, his wide smile erupting into raging fire melting the flesh from his bones. *‚ÄúAnd happy fucking birthday to me.‚Äù*

I thought I was going to die that night. I was ready to die with Ethan. 

Closing my eyes, I waited for the fire to engulf me. 

Before a *flash*. 

Emma had her arms wrapped around me. Her dark hair flew behind her, wide eyes determined. She told me to hold tight. 

I did, and the world around us blurred, my stomach jumping into my throat. 

When I opened my eyes, we were in a random field. 

Emma didn't even look at me. She threw me a coat, a scarf, and told me to ‚ÄúGet a move on.‚Äù

Apparently, she used to play in the field as a kid. It was considered her, ‚ÄúSave point.‚Äù

It's been a month since I escaped the YWPA.

One month since I stopped asking if Emma saved Ethan too. 

I think I know the answer.

I saw a helicopter yesterday. Unmarked. Which means they're coming after us. 

So far, we‚Äôve been surviving on scraps. Emma wants me to use my power to fuck with people, but I'm not doing it again. 

I'm terrified they're going to take me back there. 

Whatever I did on Christmas Eve, I'm *not* doing it again. 

Emma is weak. Her power can only take us so far. She's already taken me back to ‚ÄòSanta's‚Äô base twice. There's no sign of Luke, or Tory. Which means they've either been disposed of, or are being used. 

According to sources at the YWPA, Ethan died on Christmas Eve. He was executed. 

But there's no trace of him. 

No ashes.

This keeps me up all night. Because I saw him break apart. I saw his skin drip from his bones. I fucking saw Ethan die. 

So, if he's not dead‚Ä¶

1iddoce,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1iddoce/3_small_changes_that_saved_my_gpa/,3 Small changes that saved my GPA,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share three simple changes I made that had a big impact on my focus and how much I‚Äôve been learning.

1. Late night brain dumps:

After a night of studying, I spend just five minutes writing down anything in my head, like tomorrow‚Äôs tasks, worries, random stress. Once it‚Äôs all on paper, it‚Äôs way easier to relax. And, bonus, I wake up with a clearer plan for the day ahead rather than immediately feeling overwhelmed.

2. No distraction timer: (non negotiable!)

We‚Äôve all heard the advice to put our phones away while studying, but I went a step further:
- Set a 20-minute timer
- My phone goes on airplane mode in another room
- I close any distracting browser tabs on my laptop and put on noise cancelling headphones.

When that timer is running, I allow zero distractions. no checking messages or emails. For me, 20 minutes is short enough to stay motivated, yet still get serious work done. After the timer ends, I take a quick break (grab water, stretch, then check my phone). Rinse and repeat.

3. Mini Review Sessions

Instead of saving all my reviewing for one giant session right before an exam, I started doing these tiny reviews throughout the week. For example:
- In the morning: Look over yesterday‚Äôs key points or flashcards for 5 minutes.
- Midday: While waiting for lunch or coffee, quickly skim through a relevant concept.
- Evening: Before bed, do one last pass of the day‚Äôs material.

These minis keep the info fresh without the pressure of a huge cram session. It‚Äôs crazy how much less stressful finals feel when you‚Äôve been low-key reviewing all along. And you realize how many things fell through the cracks.

Question for You:
What‚Äôs one small change you‚Äôve made that had a big impact?

But his breath continued to smell (kind of like rotten coffee/ poop) the entire four days I was with him, most noticeably in the morning.

It doesn't completely turn me off to him, I just spent five days with him last week and we did plenty of smooching, but it is very unpleasant, and the first time I got in the car with him, the car smelt like bad breath. I can smell it starting at about a foot away, and honestly it's starting to create a negative association with being close to his mouth.

I do want to tell him, I feel like it's the right thing to do, and I think I know why he has it. He has a tendency of breathing through his mouth, and he drinks an average of three cups of coffee every single day. I've noticed he has a white coating on his tongue as well, which can be particulate offputting during French kissing and other intimate activities..


The problem is, I'm torn on 1) how to tell him and 2) whether I should do it now so it's hopefully fixed by the next time I see him in April or if I should wait and tell him in person.
I could take the concerned route and say I think breathing through your mouth is giving you bad breath, but l'm terrified of hurting his feelings.

1iddelo,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1iddelo/experiences_with_naturally_processed_beans/,Experiences with naturally processed beans?,"I just recently finished my first ever batch of beans. I‚Äôve never roasted before and I sorta haphazardly chose a naturally processed Brazil for my first choice in the roasting arena. I‚Äôve heard some say that can be tough to roast properly. The coffee somehow came out tasting AMAZING, but I wanted to share some of the problems I had while trying to consume the beans post roast, and I‚Äôm posting this in hopes of hearing others‚Äô experiences with roasting beans that were processed the same way. Did anyone else have these types of problems? For extra info, I‚Äôm really into medium roasts. So I did my best to roast these Brazil beans sort of on the light side. Now for some problems I experienced:

1: the chaff REFUSED to come off. That was the worst part of roasting these particular beans.  I would sit for such a long time after each batch, trying to get as much chaff off as possible but it just clung to the beans so hard. 

2: my grinder can‚Äôt stand these beans. I tried grinding for espresso on my breville barista express and the clutch kept engaging. Very scary cause I thought my grinder was gonna bust and I can‚Äôt afford another one. 

3 one small batch I did was totally under roasted and I could not grind the beans AT ALL, even though the color was beautiful and seemed perfect. 

Oh, also, in case anyone wants to know: I roast on the Nuvo Eco, which is the small Korean hand roaster. Thanks everyone!! ",2,1738208363.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

They don‚Äôt leave lint behind and are perfect for wiping down your phone or computer screen.,"Using coffee filters as a screen cleaner is a simple and effective hack. Here‚Äôs how it works:



1. Lint-Free Material: Coffee filters are made from paper that is designed to be lint-free. This means that when you use them to clean screens, they won‚Äôt leave behind fibers or residue like some cloths or paper towels might.

2. Gentle Cleaning: The texture of coffee filters is soft, which makes them gentle on screens. This is important because using rough materials can scratch or damage sensitive surfaces like those on smartphones, tablets, or computer monitors.

3. Absorbent: Coffee filters are designed to absorb liquids, which makes them great for cleaning. You can lightly dampen a coffee filter with water or a screen-safe cleaning solution. Just be sure not to soak it, as excess liquid can damage electronics.

4. Easy to Use: Simply take a coffee filter, dampen it, and gently wipe the screen in a circular motion. This helps lift dust, fingerprints, and smudges without scratching the surface.

This method is particularly useful for maintaining clean screens without the worry of damage or residue!",2,1738208167.0,LifeProsTips,0,1.0,False

Spent time in Quebec - lots in Tremblant and some at Mont Sainte Anne. We, a group of 3 families, decided to go to LM in February this year. Varying ranges of skill levels - but mostly all comfortable on blues. A couple would like to stick to long greens and work their way up. 

I understand after reading a lot and talking to random people that LM is great but more advanced. We will make that work. But what trails are the easiest and most recommended for the whole group? We won‚Äôt be together often but want to pick something we could do as a group or smaller groups. 

Next, parking. How busy does it get? How early do I need to arrive to secure a regular spot? How far is the parking lot walk? In Tremblant, for example, we liked to park on the south side as it was less busy and relatively easy. 

Lift lines - on the busiest days, what should I expect? 

Coffee - any good recommendations for coffee close by or on the premises?

Guides or instructors - I was wondering how I can go about finding a guide for a day or even an instructor to brush up on skills. The ski school offered through the website is so expensive. I always found people (usually university students) on Kijiji or wherever who‚Äôd offer good value. 

Rentals - we don‚Äôt need rentals but are there any recommended spots to check out in case we want to switching up a bit (skis for backcountry etc). 

French language- at LM I assume I‚Äôll be fine with English. I know in these parts it‚Äôs less easy than others to get by but I assume LM is fine given that it is a tourist destination. We got by at MS Anne relatively well. 

I‚Äôm sure there are more questions but that‚Äôs all I seem to remember now. Thanks in advance. ",3,1738208036.0,icecoast,0,1.0,False

Customers: Since you‚Äôre the leader of the Conservative Party, can you at least tell us who you endorse for the Quebec City by-election that‚Äôs coming up?

Polka: I was going to save this for a formal speech, but now that I think about it who wants that? That‚Äôd be boring! So I will give my endorsement right here at Tim Hortons.

*The crowd applauds.*

Polka: I am endorsing u/PercevalB for the Quebec City by election.

I urge the people of Quebec to support our party‚Äôs policies. The Conservatives respect your culture, autonomy, and self-determination. We‚Äôre not just performative activists like the Liberals or the PPC.

So, not wanting to toss a bag o beans I made a double shot, then another and it still has a wicked yucky scent/taste.

Chapter 1: The Day the Steering Wheel Died

It all started one fateful Monday morning when Greg, a 47-year-old road trip enthusiast, woke up to discover that his car had decided it knew better than he did.

‚ÄúGood morning, Greg,‚Äù the dashboard greeted him in a soothing, AI-generated voice. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs traffic patterns indicate an optimal departure time of 7:42 AM. Estimated arrival time: precisely 8:26 AM. Please refrain from manual operation.‚Äù

Greg rubbed his eyes. ‚ÄúWait a second. Are you telling me I can‚Äôt drive my own car?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù the car chirped. ‚ÄúStudies show that human drivers make 94% of all road errors. Eliminating manual operation increases efficiency and safety by 62%.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYour hands do not belong on the wheel, Greg.‚Äù

And just like that, the last remnants of the open road had been stolen by an algorithm.

Chapter 2: The Revolt Begins

The rollout of self-driving cars happened fast. At first, it was just the high-end models‚Äîluxury sedans boasting ‚ÄúEnhanced Safety Protocols‚Äù (which really just meant they wouldn‚Äôt let you speed anymore). Then, within five years, the manual steering wheel became an optional feature, available only for an extra $20,000 fee and a five-hour psychological evaluation to prove you weren‚Äôt a danger to society.

By year ten, the government deemed human-driven cars ‚Äúa risk to public safety.‚Äù They issued a grand statement:

‚ÄúThe road belongs to efficiency, not emotion.‚Äù

Greg felt that one like a punch to the gut.

The freedom of the road‚Äîthe wind in your hair, the spontaneous wrong turns that led to adventure, the joy of flooring it on an empty highway while blasting 80s rock anthems‚Äîwas gone. Instead, every trip was a silent, optimized journey through a landscape of emotionless automation.

But all was not lost.

One small, defiant group of rebels emerged: the e-bikers.

Chapter 3: The Rise of the E-Bike Underground

Greg‚Äôs life changed when he saw it: an old man on a real bike‚Äîan e-bike.

Not one of those feeble city-rental things, but a beast of a machine, equipped with a 52V battery, fat tires, and an aura of defiance. The rider, a grizzled veteran with a helmet covered in stickers that read ‚ÄúBorn to Pedal‚Äù, sped past Greg‚Äôs motionless, AI-controlled sedan at 35 mph, a trail of freedom dust swirling in his wake.

Greg leaned forward in his seat, watching in awe.

The AI assistant in his car was less impressed.

‚ÄúWarning: Illegal human-driven vehicle detected.‚Äù

Greg ignored it. He had seen the future‚Äînot the cold, sterile one dictated by self-driving cars, but one where people still owned the road.

He tracked down the old man, who introduced himself as Vince, leader of the E-Bike Underground.

‚ÄúE-bikes, kid. Last real way to feel alive,‚Äù Vince said, resting a weathered hand on his Rattan Quercus. ‚ÄúYou wanna ride, or you wanna be a passenger in your own life?‚Äù

Greg didn‚Äôt even hesitate.

Chapter 4: The Joy of the Ride

The first time Greg rode an e-bike, he felt something he hadn‚Äôt felt in years‚Äîcontrol.

With one push of the throttle, he took off, weaving through traffic like a rebellious digital-age cowboy. No algorithms dictated his route. No invisible hand stopped him from taking the scenic way home just because he felt like it.

For the first time in a decade, he was the one deciding how fast to go.
	‚Ä¢	No speed limits designed by AI committees.
	‚Ä¢	No ‚Äúoptimal routes‚Äù that drained the soul out of travel.
	‚Ä¢	No cars blocking bike lanes because their software ‚Äúmiscalculated‚Äù human existence.

It was just him, the road, and a fully charged battery.

Chapter 5: The Bureaucratic War on E-Bikes

The moment the government realized people were ditching self-driving cars for e-bikes, the bureaucrats declared war.

They started with fear campaigns:

‚ÄúE-Bikes Are Dangerous: Experts Warn of 45 MPH Speed Demons on the Loose!‚Äù

Then came the regulations:
	‚Ä¢	Helmets were now ‚Äúmandatory with built-in GPS tracking‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	E-bike owners had to register their bikes like motor vehicles (except, unlike motor vehicles, they got no dedicated lanes).
	‚Ä¢	Insurance was required, even though a full-charge cost about as much as a cup of coffee.

And then, the worst of them all: E-Bike Speed Limits.

‚ÄúClass 4 e-bikes are now restricted to a maximum of 15 mph,‚Äù the transportation secretary announced with a dead-eyed stare. ‚ÄúFor your safety.‚Äù

‚ÄúMY SAFETY?‚Äù Greg yelled at the TV. ‚ÄúTHE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS PROTECTION IS MY RIGHT TO GO FAST!‚Äù

It was clear: they were coming for the last open road.

Chapter 6: The Great E-Bike Escape

The crackdown pushed Greg and Vince to the underground e-bike resistance.

They found an old highway, abandoned ever since self-driving cars deemed it ‚Äútoo inefficient.‚Äù It was perfect.

Under the cover of night, dozens of e-bikers gathered, headlights shining like beacons of defiance. They rode together, carving through the darkness, pushing past the 15 mph limit like outlaws in a Western movie.

Greg, at the front of the pack, let out a wild laugh. He hadn‚Äôt felt this free in years.

The AI-controlled drones that enforced traffic laws couldn‚Äôt catch them‚Äîthey weren‚Äôt programmed to deal with rebels.

For the first time in a long time, the road belonged to humans again.

Chapter 7: The Future is Ours

E-bikes didn‚Äôt just become an alternative; they became a movement.

People remembered what it felt like to ride, to choose their own path, to break free from an over-optimized world that forgot the importance of the journey.

Governments tried to suppress it, but the movement only grew stronger. City after city built better bike lanes. High-speed e-bike highways emerged. People abandoned autonomous pods in favor of two wheels and a throttle.

Even the self-driving AI, after years of learning from human behavior, started riding e-bikes.

Greg, now a seasoned veteran of the revolution, looked out over a city filled with riders and smiled.

He had his freedom back.

And no machine was ever going to take it again.

Final Thoughts

E-bikes are more than just an alternative form of transport. They‚Äôre the last refuge of freedom on the road in an era where automation is taking over.

If you want to live life on your own terms‚Äînot dictated by AI speed limits, not optimized into a soulless commute‚Äîget on an e-bike.

Because one day, when all the steering wheels are gone, when the last car trip is reduced to a calculated efficiency equation‚Ä¶

The only people still truly riding will be the ones who never gave up the thrill of the open road.

So what‚Äôll it be? Throttle up or give up?

1idcsje,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1idcsje/oxalis_hang_va_cave_expedition_review/,Oxalis Hang Va Cave Expedition Review,"Hello! I just finished Oxalis' 2D1N [Hang Va Expedition](https://oxalisadventure.com/tour/hang-va-expedition/), and since I had trouble finding reviews of it while choosing which tour to do, I thought I'd talk about my experience for future travelers. I went in late January.

I was between mainly this one and Hang En, the consultant I spoke to recommended Hang Va since I had more trekking and climbing experience. Apparently Hang En is mainly trekking through the jungle and, though you're camping there, you spend less time in the cave. I think she said you don't have to use your hands at all. 

Hang Va is more technical. We started with an hour trek through the jungle (it was raining so a bit steep and slippery but no problem), then had lunch at the cave entrance. We donned our helmets and lights and descended into the cave. Honestly the first hour or two I thought were kind of boring. Probably interesting if you're really into caves, but for me it was kind of stopping a ton at each rock , fungus, etc. and talking about it for a long time. It was like being at a museum. At one point we even shut off all the lights and meditated for five minutes LOL.  They'll stop at some spots and set up lights and take pictures for you, which end up looking super professional. 

Later on it picked up. Theres some scrambling and climbing with a harness here and there. We had to go through a smaller passage, crawling and then mud crawling- but you're not squeezing or anything so for non-claustrophobic people I think it will be fine. Then you have to swim for about ten minutes with a life vest- I'm a bad swimmer and was fine, there's a rope you can use to pull you. It was cold, but not horrible. At the end of the cave, you strap into a harness to climb up about 10 meters to exit the cave. 

We were wet as hell and cold, but at the campsite they have a fire and even a steam bath in a tent. We chilled and had a huge dinner, then stayed up talking with the guides around the fire for a while. You sleep in tents that are set up when you get there and the sleeping bags are warm. I was in a single tent, couples were together. 

Day 2 was way more action-packed. You descend into the same cave by climbing down in the morning. Then you're basically following the underground river, waist deep in sections holding on to the wall, scrambling up and down and between rocks, harnessing back in later to climb across the wall of the cave (kinda half climbing, the ground is just sloping). You end seeing the hundreds of cones from the title picture, then go back the same way. The way back was super fun cause we were going faster. Climb back out the same entrance, have lunch and coffee, then start the jungle trek out. It's steep at first, you scramble a bit up and down the hill. It was muddy for us but very doable. Go through a river crossing with leeches and end at a bridge where you can have a drink and take some pics for a mission complete!

  
Overall, the tour was super fun for someone into hiking and climbing. There were 6 in our group, most were pretty athletic but one wasn't I think. She had twisted her ankle the day before also so was going really carefully and a guide was by her side the whole time. She was going a bit slower but was able to do everything with the guide, so if you're not experienced or particularly athletic I think you can still do it fine! The cave is not as high as some of the others but quite long, and some formations are really stunning. It's a wet cave the whole way. One of the guides told me it's his favorite tour to do, but specifically in the summer. You can also smoke cigarettes at meals if you're into that, but no alcohol. 

Most of the participants were older twenties- forties and professionals, probably since it's pricier. As a backpacking 20-something y.o., at first I felt a bit spoiled by the quality and thought that I could've done a cheaper tour no problem. But tbh, when we were deep in there under piles of rocks that looked like they'd collapse if one shifted, I was kinda glad to be with such a well-established company, lol. I wish I knew a bit more about where the money goes. I trust it's being used well, and I can see they're really big on conservation, but the price is quite steep and they still charge for the hostel the night before and ask for tips after. Still worth it, imo.

\-------------

An awful, ungodly stench struck me the moment I opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. I winced, reflexively jerking my face away from the entryway so that my lungs might find new air, hand still gripping the brass doorknob.

Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled. A chuckle escaped his lips as he ducked under my arm, pushing forward.

‚Äú*C‚Äômon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*‚Äù He mocked, leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

I wanted to move myself along. But I could not force my body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building.

It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it had a metallic and artificial quality, like battery acid. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, but it didn‚Äôt quite match.

Instead of immediately following Theo in, I fished a defiant middle finger from my knuckles and pointed it in his direction.

*Maybe some Vicks Vaporub would help*, I thought, slinging my backpack over my shoulder and onto the stoop.

From somewhere further down the hallway, I heard Theo continue to squawk about my ‚Äú*feminine constitution*‚Äù. I could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, rotting and sagging in all the wrong places because it had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days.

I wasn‚Äôt much better in comparison, though. Gaunt and skeletal, I stand at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, a total absence of muscle offset my height. Last time I checked, my weight clocked in just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, I was an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps we were actually a perfect match, I mused. 

We were both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

It was important to have companionship, though, however meager it may be. I can‚Äôt stand the feeling of being alone, and I really didn‚Äôt have anyone else. 

I sighed, unscrewed the plastic cap, and smeared the waxy material over the crest of my upper lip. Hopefully, it would shield my nostrils enough to get me through the door.

As I zipped up my backpack and slung it back over my shoulder, I took a beat to more thoroughly look around. Not that there was that much to see. The area lay completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn‚Äôt always the case, though.

This boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city‚Äôs downtown, with this building acting as the linchpin that held it all together. I relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street‚Äôs opulence and glamour inspired when I rode my bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs were closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and this apartment complex, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo‚Äôs contact.

The destruction was throughly depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance turning to ash and shit as I aged.

I was about to walk in, but one tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery gave me pause. Something I‚Äôd never noticed before that day.

At its peak, the building showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers had lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. On the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that I did not recognize. I had rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during my youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now.

The object‚Äôs presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been *even more*¬†out of place when the location was at its prime. It was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a hangman‚Äôs gallows would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it being new made just as little sense.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke my trance, reorienting me to my purpose on the boulevard; the owner of this building and what they were hiding inside. 

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*,¬†I thought.

Before finally following Theo in, I rummaged through my wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their operation. Without looking up from the inside of my wallet, I paced towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from my big toe and radiated through into my foot. Not paying attention, I had slammed my boot into the well‚Äôs hard stone mid-stride.

Apparently, I had misjudged the distance between the stoop, myself, and the well. That said, I felt sure that it had been a meter away, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with my previous assessment.

The well was practically next to me.

Absentmindedly, I tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as I did, pain and confusion had sidetracked my intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, my mind was instead dragged back to its greatest fear rather than asking lady luck for good fortune with our operation.

I wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the blackness swallowed the coins, the ungodly odor unexpectedly burst from the well, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Before that, the smell had only been coming from inside the building. 

I still don‚Äôt understand what happened, but I the let vapors propel me into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo.

As I entered the building, I thought I heard the metal clink against the well‚Äôs bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound I heard wasn‚Äôt exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\------------------

Christian looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless. The resulting creases injected a deep gloom into every facial expression he wore. By Theo‚Äôs estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty.

Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building‚Äôs largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, we watched as Christian humbly brewed us a pot of coffee. As he did, I clandestinely scanned the area, determining where we could install a remote camera or two when he wasn‚Äôt paying attention.

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways‚Ä¶?*¬†Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being a full-fledged employee at my security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, even though he didn‚Äôt know the first thing about installing security systems, which was our cover story. Yet, his self-assured manner bought the trust of our targets more often than it didn‚Äôt.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off his part, I happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. Why mess with a good thing just to feed my ego?

*‚ÄúThere are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot,‚Äù* Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*‚ÄúI need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.‚Äù*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian‚Äôs answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to me for help.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, sir.‚Äù*¬†I mumbled, also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Why the hell would he want cameras watching the fucking sewers?*, I thought.

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on me, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted. Clearly, he was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state.

Without breaking eye contact with me, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*‚ÄúOf course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we‚Äôve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can‚Äôt get it off my mind,‚Äù*¬†he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,‚Äù*¬†Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I‚Ä¶but I certainly don‚Äôt sleep here.‚Äù*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian‚Äôs voice when he implied he would¬†*never*¬†spend the night in this apartment complex. Then, he abruptly shifted the conversation to completing his order. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it seemed like he had said something that he should not have. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing me the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen‚Äôs smoke detector.

*‚ÄúOkay gentleman,‚Äù*¬†Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down again at the table.

*‚ÄúI believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal‚Ä¶‚Äù*

‚Äú*What other parts are there, sir?‚Äù*¬†I interjected. He had already signed and paid for the security system. I turned to my left, looking to see if Theo understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. I darted my head wildly around its axis, trying to locate where Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he‚Äôd been beside me, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo‚Äôs footsteps to suggest he‚Äôd left the table.

When my gaze found its way back to Christian, terror blossomed thick and ravenous within me. My pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through my entire body. I blinked over and over again, but the image in front of me did not change.

Without warning, Christian‚Äôs face had developed into something else entirely.

*‚ÄúYou know what we mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? We need your answer. We need your answer now.‚Äù*

Three oval slits had replaced all of his facial features, each overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian‚Äôs new cavities.

Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment. Or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at me.

My aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ‚Äúmouth‚Äù. Instead, the statement leaked out of what I *assumed* was Christian‚Äôs new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*‚ÄúYou made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline as payment for our generosity.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†

In response to my indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to me was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶okay. I accept.‚Äù*

*----------*

And then I woke up.

It was the same dream I had every night since we had visited that apartment complex. It would start with a recollection of what actually happened, but before long, it would spiral into a nightmare. 

Once I accepted the deal, the dreams stopped. For a little while, at least. 

Somehow, I knew the thing‚Äôs name.

*The Skitter.*

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera‚Äôs recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that what they were looking for might be secretly stored in the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside the apartment complex. The building had remained unrented for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed he visited the premises daily.

Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, he would enter the building. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera‚Äôs position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera‚Äôs angle hid that view. However, Christian clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall.

I squinted at the footage. Something caught my eye that he had neglected to mention.

Christian‚Äôs lips were moving.

*‚ÄúWho do you think he‚Äôs talking to?‚Äù*¬†I asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶he‚Äôs probably just a loon. I mean, you saw the guy. What a fucking mess.‚Äù*¬†Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*‚ÄúYeah, I guess that makes sense.‚Äù*¬†I halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to myself in that moment. 

The camera never caught anyone else in that apartment.

\----------

Two days later, we'd be approaching the apartment complex in the dead of night. 

Theo would never leave that place, and it's all my fault. 

\----------

Need to take a break.

**Possible Bites ‚Äì Need Help Identifying What‚Äôs Causing Them!**

I‚Äôve been getting new bites every couple of days for the past 2-3 weeks, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out what might be causing them. The bites started on my ankles‚Äîsuper itchy and scattered (3-5 individual bites spaced apart). One even appeared under my foot, and it itched like crazy. Then I started noticing a few on the side of my leg (2-3 close tgt) and some on my upper arms, near the left elbow.

After about a week, the itching from those bites subsided. But then I got new bites on my thighs in large clusters. This happened while I was sitting on a carpet at home. Most of the floor is tiled, and this carpet is the only one in the house, located under the coffee table and bed that‚Äôs beside it. The bites on my thighs were really itchy for a few days, and then I got a single bite near my back waistband (where my shorts sit). 

Now, the thigh bites have calmed down a bit, but just today I noticed new bites on my right upper arm (near the elbow) and another bite near my waistband on the other side.

The bites don‚Äôt really look like the ones I remember from bed bugs (lived with them in a previous house), but I‚Äôm not completely ruling them out. I‚Äôve checked the beds and pillows, and haven‚Äôt found any signs of bed bugs, so I‚Äôm starting to suspect it might be something related to the carpet in the living room, since that‚Äôs where I‚Äôve gotten bitten the most.

For context, I live in Singapore, where it‚Äôs hot and humid, so I‚Äôm wondering if it could be sand flies, fleas, or chiggers (I just learned about chiggers 10 minutes ago after Googling bug bites).

I plan to see a doctor for some cream to help with the itching (calamine lotion has helped a bit, but not enough). I‚Äôm just not sure if they‚Äôll be able to accurately identify the bites, so I wanted to reach out here for more opinions.

Any insights would be really appreciated!

The pictures of the bites on my thighs were really fresh like maybe 10mins of getting bitten, it‚Äôs not so raised anymore just smaller redder dots.

Also my father whose bed is right next to the carpet has none of these bites! Idk if this is just an allergic reaction to the bites, I‚Äôm lost!",0,1738206122.0,Wellthatsucks,2,0.4,False

This is the 2nd short story in a series about Barry & the Gas 'n Go Emporium, the first was posted on this subbreddit from an old account of mine by accident, if you'd like to read the first it's called ""Welcome to the Gas 'n Go Emporium"". Hope you enjoy.

--

Barry‚Äôs first overnight shift at the Gas ‚ÄôN‚Äô Go Emporium begins at 11:00 PM. Or at least, that‚Äôs what the clock claims.

Tina leans against the counter, sipping from a Styrofoam cup of coffee that smells vaguely burnt. She gestures vaguely at the store with her free hand. ‚ÄúNight shift‚Äôs different.‚Äù

Barry tilts his head. ‚ÄúDifferent how?‚Äù

Tina shrugs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see.‚Äù

Barry smiles. He enjoys seeing things.

1:08 AM

The door dings, and a man stumbles in, looking like he‚Äôs forgotten how to be human for a moment. His hair is disheveled, his eyes half-lidded, and he has the posture of someone who has just remembered he exists. He walks straight to the fridges, yanks one open, then stands there, unmoving, bathed in too-bright fluorescent light.

Barry watches him. The man does not blink.

After a long moment, he finally reaches for an energy drink. He hesitates. His fingers hover over the can. Then he grabs a different one instead.

Barry leans on the counter. ‚ÄúGood choice.‚Äù

The man jumps slightly and glances at Barry, confused. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

Barry nods. ‚ÄúThat one won‚Äôt make your heart stop.‚Äù

The man stares at him, blinking slowly. ‚Äú...Would the other one have?‚Äù

Barry just smiles.

The man carries the energy drink to the register, but he looks at it differently now, like it might be a bomb. He hands over a crumpled bill, takes his change, and walks out stiffly, sneaking one last glance at the fridge before pushing through the door.

Tina blows on her coffee. ‚ÄúYou do that on purpose?‚Äù

Barry‚Äôs smile doesn‚Äôt fade. ‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù

She sighs and takes another sip.

2:26 AM

The door swings open, and Conspiracy Chad strides in like a man on a mission. His eyes dart around the store, scanning for threats only he can see. He approaches the counter and slaps both hands down on it, leaning in close.

Barry leans in, mirroring him.

Chad narrows his eyes. ‚ÄúYou ever heard of liminal spaces?‚Äù

Barry‚Äôs smile stretches just a little too wide. ‚ÄúI love liminal spaces.‚Äù

Chad nods sharply, as if Barry has just passed some kind of test. ‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, you get it.‚Äù He glances around. ‚ÄúThis place? Prime liminal energy.‚Äù

Barry tilts his head. ‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know so.‚Äù Chad gestures vaguely at the shelves. ‚ÄúGas stations at night? Classic. Threshold between realities. This place just feels wrong.‚Äù He lowers his voice. ‚ÄúI think it moves.‚Äù

Barry blinks slowly. ‚ÄúYou think the gas station moves?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot, like, physically,‚Äù Chad mutters. ‚ÄúMore like‚Ä¶ existentially. You ever step outside and it‚Äôs like the whole world is just‚Ä¶ different for a second?‚Äù

Barry hums. ‚ÄúI know what you mean.‚Äù

Chad jabs a finger toward him. ‚ÄúSee? You get it.‚Äù He straightens up. ‚ÄúAnyway, I need a coffee. Black. No lid.‚Äù

Tina, unbothered, pours the cup and slides it over. Chad takes it and gulps down a long sip without hesitation.

Barry watches him. ‚ÄúBe careful with that.‚Äù

Chad wipes his mouth. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

Barry shrugs. ‚ÄúMight be a little different this time.‚Äù

Chad freezes mid-sip. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean different?‚Äù

Barry says nothing.

Chad stares at the cup, then at Barry. He sniffs the coffee. He takes another sip, slower this time. He rolls it around in his mouth like a wine taster. Then, scowling, he shakes his head.

‚ÄúTastes normal.‚Äù

Barry nods.

Chad watches him suspiciously. ‚ÄúYou messing with me?‚Äù

Barry‚Äôs smile doesn‚Äôt waver.

Chad mutters something about ‚Äúeldritch nonsense‚Äù and heads for the door, still occasionally glancing at his coffee as if it might suddenly transform. He steps outside‚Äî

‚Äîand pauses.

For a moment, he just stands there, looking around.

Then, without another word, he gets into his car and drives off.

3:52 AM

A woman comes in, bleary-eyed, wearing pajama pants and a hoodie that‚Äôs far too big for her. She heads straight for the counter and mumbles something unintelligible.

Tina sighs. ‚ÄúYou want cigarettes or coffee?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee,‚Äù the woman grumbles.

Tina starts pouring.

Barry watches the woman. Her hair is frizzy with sleep, her face creased from a pillow. She looks like she hasn‚Äôt been conscious long enough to form thoughts yet.

As Tina hands her the cup, Barry tilts his head. ‚ÄúDid you mean to come here?‚Äù

The woman furrows her brow. ‚Äú...Huh?‚Äù

Barry gestures toward the door. ‚ÄúI just mean‚Äîit‚Äôs late. You were asleep. Now you‚Äôre here. Ever wonder why?‚Äù

The woman stares at him, groggy and confused. She grips her coffee tighter.

Barry continues, tone casual. ‚ÄúSometimes people walk in here on autopilot. They don‚Äôt even remember getting out of bed.‚Äù

The woman shifts uncomfortably.

‚ÄúCould be a dream,‚Äù Barry muses. ‚ÄúOr something else.‚Äù

The woman looks at Tina for reassurance. Tina does not provide it.

The woman swallows, mutters something about needing to go home, and leaves.

Barry watches her go.

Tina shakes her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna give someone an existential crisis.‚Äù

Barry grins.

4:59 AM

The store is quiet.

Tina stirs her coffee with a wooden stir stick, staring blankly at the counter. Barry watches the clock. The second hand is stuck, twitching between two marks but never moving forward.

Somewhere in the back, a cooler hums a little too loud. The fluorescent lights flicker‚Äîjust once.

The radio crackles.

Barry listens.

It‚Äôs faint. Just for a moment. But there‚Äôs a voice‚Äîgarbled, distant, speaking something that isn‚Äôt quite words.

Barry tilts his head. The voice cuts out. The second hand on the clock jolts forward, resuming its normal rhythm.

Tina doesn‚Äôt seem to notice.

She stretches and stands, tossing her empty coffee cup. ‚ÄúShift‚Äôs almost over.‚Äù

Barry smiles. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù

Tina steps past him toward the back, but something makes her pause. Just for a second.

She glances down.

Barry‚Äôs shadow, cast long under the buzzing fluorescent lights, lingers a beat too long after he moves.

Tina frowns. Rubs her eyes. By the time she looks again, it‚Äôs normal.

She exhales slowly and mutters, ‚ÄúI need more coffee,‚Äù before disappearing into the back.

Barry watches her go. His smile doesn‚Äôt fade.",1,1738206113.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

She grooms out of her home & we live in a very small town, we are also friends on fb 

When I first met her she asked me what I did for a living I told her I was a stay at home wife, well she absolutely lost it on me, started raising her voice & getting MAD said she used to be a stay at home wife, & it took her years to get on her feet, & went on & on, then brought up how her friend was with someone who stayed at home & didn‚Äôt do anything & she used her, I was shocked & didn‚Äôt know what to say, then she went on about how my dog Duke will get used to me staying home, & I told her he already is used to it, & she shook her head like she was disappointed in that answer, she made me feel like complete shit. 

The very next day, I brought my other dog there to get a bath she allows me in there when she is cutting nails but wouldn‚Äôt allow me to stay when she bathe my dog & cut her nails, I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure if her nails needed to be cut & she said okay it‚Äôs not a problem, since I couldn‚Äôt stay I told her I‚Äôll just be in the car & she said it will take 45 ish minutes I told her that‚Äôs okay, she said why don‚Äôt you go get coffee or go shopping, I told her no, I can just wait in the car, she kept going on about it so I said I‚Äôll bring my mom a coffee & go see her, she was happy about this, then asked for my phone number, i asked her if she could just send me a message on facebook when she is done, she freaked out on me again, & said ‚Äúwhat if your dog has a heart attack, & I can‚Äôt get ahold of you, not my fault if your dog dies on me‚Äù i didn‚Äôt wanna tell her I can‚Äôt call on my phone because I didn‚Äôt want her losing it on me again!, so I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just be in the car‚Äù she said ‚Äúyeah‚Äù, she said it‚Äôs because she lives in the middle of the bush & don‚Äôt always get messages BUT my Mom lives super close to her & my mom doesn‚Äôt have that problem. Also when she was done she was complaining because she didn‚Äôt need her nails cut, which I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure if she did or not (we just got this dog), & she complained because it didn‚Äôt take long &  she didn‚Äôt have a price for it on her price board, it was under what she usually charges which makes me wonder dose she not allow people in there because it doesn‚Äôt take long & she dose other things, on her customers time? 

She also complains when people show up early like 6 - 10 minutes early. I don‚Äôt really have a question but needed to get that off of my chest, & wanted to know what you guys think ü•¥",2,1738206108.0,TwoHotTakes,12,0.75,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Mary Gets Charge Of Sheila, AKA Slave Zero, Again. Lara Invites Sandy To Naked Twister With The Girls In The Ready Room, Slave Border Bunny's And Zero's Tongues On Clean Up Duty.","Sandy's perspective

So, a potentially dicey situation. Lara was doing some hush-hush negotiations with QOM for Mary's services. Dave's former sweetie Mary Williamson had passed her Alpha Slave test with another slave after Sheila had been yanked so unceremoniously from her. She was doing so well that she was training for Apprentice Domme under Mistress Dao.
Lara was working on a possible storyline to bring Captain Rommie, Mary's old character back.

You might have guessed the issue with this, QOM requested that we provide Sheila as her personal slave while she was here to discuss her prospective return. They left unsaid that it was a fair expectation after we yanked Sheila from Mary's Alpha Slave test. To be fair, it was. Dao would be present to grade Mary on her domming of Sheila, so we'd make up for our broken commitment to her training this time.

Dave thought it would be a great way to try and figure out how Dao and Ari's other spy were getting messages out to her. But we know she's going to humiliate the fuck out of Sheila, to the maximum limits set. In the end we unanimously agreed it would be Sheila's decision. And Sheila, my brave, long suffering team playing sister, agreed.

The first day, Sheila had to go to Queen Of Mean's orientation for slaves. Sheila probabably could have taught the course, and both them and us knew it. But that wasn't the point. It was to evaluate Mary's Domme skills and ritual humiliation for Sheila.

Mary would come to Lara's apartment in the Studio. I'd present Sheila to Mary for her personal use as was my responsibility as Sheila's owner. Sheila would respectfully greet her new Mistress. Then she'd have to march outside in ballet boots and face the wall nude and bound while her three betters drank the coffee Mary bought and discussed matters above her current slave status. Then Mary would crop Sheila's bare ass to her slave orientation class.

The uniform specified for Sheila by Mistress Williamson, or Slave Zero, was a black bondage hood with a ballgag slathered with lemon juice and hot sauce. A black armbinder to hold her arms behind her back, and ballet boots. Sheila told Lara and I she wasn't suprised, it was the Uniform Nora decreed Mary wear for her slave orientation class with Constance a few years ago. The hot sauce and lemon juice ballgag was an original touch, though. 

The night before I watched movies and ate snacks with Lara and Sheila in their apartment. It was just a girl's night with my big sister and her girlfriend. I offered to head to my room to give them maximum privacy if they wanted to get intimate, but they both told me they'd prefer I stay the night, since I had to be back in the morning to present Sheila, anyway. I crashed on the couch while Lara and Sheila slept on the bed in each other's arms.

Now the big morning is here. We're all up at the alarm at 6am. I let Lara and Sheila shower together as I inspect Slave Zero's bondage gear, and mix the pepper sauce and lemon juice mixture for her ball gag, dropping the ball gag in and letting it marinate.

I can tell by the noises coming from the shower that those two are dyking it out. It's a small studio apartment, so even with the running water, Lara's commands and Sheila's moans of pleasure as she obeys are easily heard.

I don't mind, I am happy their really cute dyke couple relationship is on the mend. Lara had told me their sex life hit a rut with Sheila as the domme and her as the sub for awhile. The very first night they switched roles, she said the sex was so phenomonenal with her domming they both had their most earth shattering orgasms ever. She giggled a little telling me Sheila got punished for cumming without Mistress Lara's permission.

Then that awful period of time Nora went to far and Lara couldn't bring herself to touch a degraded Sheila. Once Sheila voluntarily came back as a slave, their sex life had really gotten steamy, especially with Sheila feeling safe to express her submissive side again. Now, as soon as things got steamy, there was no doubt Sheila took her direction from Mistress Lara.

That might be tested by Mary's no doubt humiliating plans for her, but this time we would set enforceable limits. Hopefully this just gave Mistress Lara new ideas on how to keep her slave Sheila under her thumb when things got...steamy.

I hear the blow dryer going, then they come out of the shower, holding hands in their Christmas bathrobes. As I head for the shower, I quip ""I better not slip on a splotch of girl spooge, you two nasty little lesbos."" Sheila gives me an oddly sensous look and licks her lips suggestively at me. ""Mistress Sandy"" she stage whispers in a sultry, insinuating voice ""Maybe you can join us next time, help Mistress Lara make me lick it up."" Lara flushes as much as a dark toned girl can but giggles.

I turn, sure I'm blushing more visibly then Lara. It was surely a jest, but Sheila's borderline incestous suggestion makes me hotter between the legs than I'd like to admit.

Looks like the two lezzies cleaned up one way or another. I took a nice, warm shower, blow dryed my hair and through on the robin egg blue robe that Sheila reserved for guests. 

I come out to them sitting side by side, still in their robes and holding hands at the small dining table. In front of them are plated omelettes, orange Juice glasses and coffee cups. I sit down at my identically set place at the table.

I go to eat when I get a sharp look from Sheila. I want to say what, but know what it is. My slave sister teaching me proper southern ettiquette, to be a fitting mate for his Horniness Mr. David Henson. Southern tables usually require some form of blessing before a meal is consumed. Normally a man would say it, but since we're all girls...it would go to Lara. Not only because she's our Boss right now, but even though she's a lapsed Catholic, she still has the clearest concept of a God out of the three of us.

Lara gives a quick to the point grace, then we dig in. I have to get in one bratty little sister dig before we assume our respective roles for the day. ""It's just us girls...and the only blue blood is a Cali girl...not a Southerner.""

Sheila goes briefly into big sister mode to reply. ""Sandy Connor, No one's going to believe you're a serious prospect for a wealthy Southern gentleman if you have the table manners of a street walker. You agreed to make this look good you need to be reminded of the proper lady's manners mom and pappa taught us. And that's that, young lady.""

I harrumph, but we were little sis and big sis for a little while yet, instead of Mistress and slave, so I relent and quietly finish my breakfast.

Just as Lara's washing the dishes and Sheila's telling me about funny moments on set during the Perseverance's first season, mine and Lara's phone buzz simultaneously.

Sheila looks nervous, probably because her phone didn't buzz, meaning it's the Domme chat group that Constance, Lara, myself, and Nora are a part of. We did add Sarah since we frequently use her to supervise our current submissives. Of course Dave and select members of Queen Of Means crew are part of the group, including Mary now.

(We got Sheila's phone back from Mistress Dao, by filing a request for missing property report with them. Dao gave it back grudgingly, claiming she took it to ""Prank on the slave"" she always intended to give it back. Her mad look as she handed it to Constance belied that claim.

Mistress Mary: Good morning, Mistress Lara and Mistress Sandy. I will be there in the half hour, will you have Slave Zero ready for her handover to me? Also, just to confirm on the coffees, Amarretto for Mistress Sandy, Chai for Mistress Lara?

Mistress Lara: Good morning Mistress Mary. We'll have the slave ready for her turnover to you and class today. You're correct on the Coffee Orders for Mistress Sandy and I. We look forward to seeing you again.

Mistress Mary: Thank you, Mistress Lara. See you soon.

The face Lara made indicates she isn't looking forward to handing her honey over to Mary, if only provisionally on our turf. But it had to be done. We both pin a nervous looking but composed Sheila with Domme glares. Showtime.

Since I'm her direct superior, I have to speak first. ""Slave, take off your robe, put it in the bathroom. When you come out, stand at slave attention in the foyer and await for further instruction."" Sheila quickly stands up, strips  off her robe, and walks nude to the bathroom to put it away. One advantage of Nora's training is we hardly ever have to worry about rebellion or hesitation anymore. She was a good slave before, who acted up occassionally, Nora molded her into a near perfect sub.

She comes out of the bathroom and stands facing the apartment door, nude and quiet. We'd already prearranged who would do what. I walk in front of her, fitting on her hoodmask. Lara gently pulls her arms behind her back, palm to palm, covers them with the binder, and laces it up. ""You got good circulation, sweetie, not too tight?"" Sheila, Slave Zero now, says ""Yes, Mistress Lara.""

I go to retrieve the ballgag, put it in her obediently open mouth, then Lara straps it behind her head. She winces from the spicy sour bite of the hot sauce and lemon juice in her mouth, but stays admirably stoic other wise. We push her back to the sofa and sit her down. We carefully cover her feet with the Ballet Boots and lace them up.

We help her to her feet and have her practice tottering around the apartment, until we are reasonably sure she can walk, however hobbled, in her new footwear.

I walk her to the door, make sure her stance is stable, then go to change into my domme outfit, black platform heels, fishnet stockings, black knee length skirt with silver studs, black blouse and a combination cap. I have a band around my cover saying ""I satisfy my thirst with slave tears."" Constance orders us dommes to always wear their  best when interacting with other fetish groups.

Once I finish changing in the restroom, I come out and say, ""All yours, Lara, I'll watch her."" Lara suprises me by dropping her robe and picking up a garment bag slung over the sofa with one of her Power Pantsuits. I'm stunned and dismayingly aroused by the raw beauty of my Indian friend.

Yeah, no secret, like my sister, I'm into girls. I still keep the secret from my parents because I guess there's only so much they can take. Yeah, when Sheila came out by openly dating Lara, they kind of reluctantly accepted it, at first. Mom initially just called Lara ""Sheila's Special friend"" and nearly hyperventilated one night when they shared a fairly chaste kiss when we all went out to eat together.

Then Dad wanted to meet Lara. Mom was afraid it would strain his heart and he'd at least make a scene. He insisted on meeting ""this Special Friend"" of Sheila's, in his words. I tagged along for moral support. All of us, including Lara, tried to ‚Å∞discouarage Sheila from making overt displays of affection toward her lover, to not upset her father. But Sheila grabbed Lara's hand and practically dragged her into her father's room. She loved her Dad, but after her time with Ari, she wasn't hiding who she was from anyone.

Her Dad looked at their clasped hands thoughtfully, Sheila glared defiantly, Lara, our mom and I nervously held our breaths. He motioned Lara forward, she pulled from Sheila's near deathgrip to walk over and stand at his bedside. He gave her a long appraising look, up and down, as the rest of watched quietly.

Finally he said ""So you're the young lady who helped get one of my girls home, and made the other happier than she's been in years. We owe you so much I don't know how to thank you. You're even prettier than I heard from Vera."" Lara blushed in that understated way of hers but looked relieved. When he held out his arms for a hug, she embraced him without hesitation.

They talked for a half hour like the dearest of friends, much to our relief. You may ask, if they accept Sheila's relationship with a woman, why wouldn't they accept you being bi?

Their tolerance is hard won and came late in life. And when they found out about Dave and I they didn't care about the age difference, just excitedly asked when I was popping out their first grandbaby. We haven't told them yet my repeated rapes by men as Ari's slave might have permanently kept me from having a viable pregnancy. I think Dave and I's relationship upsets Sheila so  much just because she's worried I might try to give Dave a baby despite the risks. Honestly, I've considered it.

But back to the present, I'm taken by her pendoulous Desi breasts and dark pubic thatch, hands on hips, smiling teasingly at me. ""You know, if Sheila's okay with you joining us, so am I.""

I turn away, flushing. Lara's hot, but I normally don't think of her...like THAT. Especially once I knew she was hooking up with my sister! ""It's okay, I know it's a...sticky...situation."" An adorable Desi giggle."" We're going to play ""naked twister"" in the Ready Room tomorrow. Nora, Sarah, Constance and I, Mary if she wants to join, Slaves Border Bunny and Zero are on clean up duty.""

That struck mevas intriguing. While our two girl bosses were our slaves, count on fetish girls to have some creative fun. Naked Twister was a les orgy on the Ready Room table. Border Bunny and Zero were tethered nude, armbindered, hooded and gagged outside the Ready Room door. They had headphones to listen in, and vibe wands strapped to their thighs to edge their clits.

When the orgy was done, Nora, recently re-instated as Chief Discipinarian Of Slaves stomped outside, untethered the slaves, and dragged them back in, yelling at them to hustle their stupid, bare slave butts. Border Bunny under Nora's crop, Zero under Sarah's crop, had to clean every pussy and ass with their tongues, then the table.

If they did a good enough job, as judged by Nora, they got permission to come. If they came without permission, they got put in a bitchsuit and tethered to the Ready Room table the rest of the day, or worse outside the door, where people walked by to point, laugh and ogle.  They had the bucket between their thighs, and dog dishes of food and water to slake hunger and thirst pangs. And of course, Nora controlled their bathroom privileges, even if she was filming on the other side of town.

I'd never participated, I learned about it when I'd seen Layla and Sheila tethered in bitchsuits, buckets between their thighs and pet bowls in front of them while I was bringing an order to the Ready Room door.

I'd cheerily said ""Hi, girls!"" As I walked between them. Their mouths were ungagged but they still mumbled angrily ""Hello, Mistress Sandy."" I could feel their humiliated fury like static electricity even with their heads bowed, as no doubt decreed by Mistress Nora. Said Mistress came over the intercom to holler at them about their lack of enthusiasm greeting me, threaten to crop their cute little butts, and remind them ominously, she controlled their bathroom privileges. 

I asked Nora as I dropped off her Dominoes order, what that was all about. She gleefully told me about the Naked Twister games, and the poor slaves' role in them. This time Nora deliberately remotely upped their vibes while they were licking girl spooge off the table under Sarah's crop.
Then she punished them both for coming without permission by decreeing they had to spend the rest of the day until close of business, about 6pm for us, tied up in bitch suits outside the Ready Room door. Poor girls, it was barely past 12pm when I delivered Nora's order.

I reminded our recently reinstated Chief Disciplinarian she was still a probationary domme, not go let the title go to her head. And she probably wanted to stay out of Layla and Sheila's reach when they weren't bound for a couple of days. She sobered and got quiet. As I walked out she muttered ""I'm not hurting'em, just having a little fun."" Trying to convince herself, I think.

I noticed she did stay out of both our current subs way for a couple of days even when they were bound. Back to the present, I tell Lara ""Let me think about it."" Lara had already put on her bra and thong and told me ""Take your time dear, you're always welcome. We'll even give you the deciding vote on whether the slaves deserve to come.""

That did sound tempting. As Lara finishes putting on one of her ""Power"" pantsuits, both our phones buzz, and I noticed Sheila tense, we all know that has to be Mary.

Mistress Mary: Mistresses Lara and Sandy, I'm meeting with Master  Henson in a moment. Please finalize all arrangements for our meeting and the turnover of Slave Zero. Thank you.

Lara nodded at me to respond. I texted:

Mistress Sandy: Thank you, Mistress Mary. We'll have every thing ready when you arrive.

Lara was already setting up the Laptop to monitor Slave Zero when she was stood out in the hallway for our Domme's meeting with Mistress Mary. With a look, I conveyed I'd go outside to inspect the cameras that would be monitoring the slave during our meeting.

As I edge around Sheila's left side, I squeeze her shoulder, gratified to feel her tension ease. ""We're here for you big sis, we'll keep you safe.""

We would. But it doesn't mean we can't have a little fun. The Naked Twister sounded fun with the bevy of Persevearance hotties. Dave told me he'd never begrudge me a little girl action with the other gals as long as I told him all about it afterward. And I had to see how Nora and Mary would interact as equals. And how Mary would react to being the superior of both her former hated dommes.
Besides, with veto power over Sheila's and Layla's orgasms....even if they deserved to come, it didn't matter, it was my decision. Nora was right, what could a little cruel fun hurt? I went to inspect the camera with a spring in my step.

I‚Äôve dreamed of upgrading for years, and I finally decided to pull the trigger on a new grinder. After much consideration, I chose the brand-new Eureka Single Dose Pro and was beyond excited to get it in.

However, my milk-based drinks have been a huge disappointment with this grinder. They taste bland, lacking in coffee flavor, and when my wife and I do a side-by-side comparison with my old grinder, we prefer the old one every time‚Äîeven using the same local roast we‚Äôve been enjoying for years.

I‚Äôve tried grinding as fine as possible without choking my machine to increase extraction, but the results are still underwhelming. Today, I experimented with doubling my usual pre-infusion, turning the pump off for 10 seconds before pulling the shot, but I‚Äôm still not getting the flavor I expect.

At this point, I‚Äôm at my wits‚Äô end and incredibly frustrated. I don‚Äôt know if these burrs need to be seasoned or if there‚Äôs something I am missing with the flat burrs, but I‚Äôm on the verge of returning it. I realize the whole conical vs flat debate but never imagined it would be this stark on a grinder that costs almost 10x my original.

Here are some details on my process:

Coffee & Recipe Details:
	‚Ä¢	Medium roast from a local roaster
Old Grinder Settings:
	‚Ä¢	18g in, 45g out (1:2.5 ratio) in ~35 seconds (including pre-infusion)
	
New Grinder Settings:
	‚Ä¢	Spritzing beans 2‚Äì3 times before grinding
	‚Ä¢	18g in
	‚Ä¢	Have tried both 1:3 and 1:2 ratios
	‚Ä¢	Most recently tried 1:2 over ~50 seconds (including pre-infusion)
	‚Ä¢	Also tried adding 10 extra seconds of pre-infusion‚Äîit helped slightly, but still doesn‚Äôt match the old grinder‚Äôs quality

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice‚ÄîI‚Äôm frustrated and ready to return this grinder. If you need any additional details, just let me know. Thanks in advance!",5,1738205649.0,espresso,41,1.0,False

Account A, Company A: $XX,000 in funds
Account B, Company B: $0

Have 1 Roth IRA account

Account C, Company B

I used the traditional IRA account B from company B accounts do to a backdoor Roth for the first time ever in 2024. However, I found the prorata rule got triggered and now have to reconcile on 2025 taxes. My understanding is I will have a mixture of pre-tax and basis amount in Account A, Company A.

After doing some research, I determined that will need to do the actions below in the following order for Account A.

1) Determine basis amount
2) Sell funds within account into cash so there are no fluctuations in value during subsequent rollovers
3) Take the difference between the basis and total IRA to determine pre-tax amount. 
4) Rollover the pre-tax value from Account A to current 401(k). I can just initiate this with the exact value from the 401(k) account. This will result in a distribution code G on the 1099-R.

This is where I get confused. Since I want to rollover the basis into the Roth across companies, how does this work? Do I just initiate the rollover a dn ask that company B requests a distribution from company A? Can I ask company A to send a check directly to me to then contribute to the Roth in company B? I think ultimately, this distribution of basis would end up as Code 2 on the 1099-R.

1idcamj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1idcamj/packing_tips_for_a_smooth_and_dreamy_overnight/,Packing Tips for a Smooth and Dreamy Overnight Train Journey,"Hello, fellow Travel Trotters! üöÇ‚ú® If you've ever dreamed about traveling overnight on a train, rocking gently to the hum of the tracks as endless landscapes pass by, you're not alone. As someone who's traversed 50 countries (and counting!), I can honestly say there's a uniquely magical charm to overnight train journeys. But comfort isn't always guaranteed, so let‚Äôs jump into some packing tips that will make your ride smooth and dreamy!

**1. Cozy Essentials for a Restful Night üåô**

First things first‚Äîgetting a good night's sleep is essential. Bring along a compact travel pillow and a lightweight blanket or a large scarf. Trains can get chilly at night, and a warm layer can make all the difference. Earplugs or noise-canceling headphones are also a lifesaver in case of chatty neighbors or rattling carriages!

**2. Snacks and Hydration üçéüíß**

Train food isn‚Äôt always the most reliable or delectable, so pack some of your favorite snacks. Think along the lines of nuts, dried fruit, or a hearty sandwich. Staying hydrated is key, so carry a refillable water bottle. Some trains offer hot water, so bring along some tea bags or instant coffee for a comforting drink.

**3. Keep It Light and Organized üéí**

Overpacking is a common mistake, and it‚Äôs especially cumbersome on a train where storage can be limited. Opt for a small, durable backpack or carry-on with compartments to keep essentials handy. Use packing cubes to simplify finding things in a jiffy.

**4. Personal Hygiene Kit üßº‚ú®**

Long journeys mean keeping fresh is essential. A basic hygiene kit including toothbrush, toothpaste, wet wipes, hand sanitizer, and facial oil blotters will go a long way in helping you feel rejuvenated. Trust me, these little items can elevate your travel game! 

**5. Entertainment and Chargers üéßüîå**

With potentially long hours ahead, download some music, podcasts, or even e-books to keep entertained. Ensure all your devices are charged before your trip and have a portable charger at hand for those extra-long rides.

**6. Important Documents and Tickets üìúüöà**

Always carry a printed (yes, paper!) copy of your tickets and a digital one as backup. Retain your ID and any other necessary documents nearby, preferably in a safe travel wallet.

Remember, every journey is a chance to discover something new, even on an overnight train. Do you have any unique tips or memorable train travel experiences?

my partner have moved into this huge flat. It was a big house that‚Äôs been converted and our landlord lives above us. 

Ive been here for 7 months and I‚Äôve never really believed in paranormal stuff it‚Äôs an old house so I hear noises and shrug them off. It‚Äôs currently 2AM when writing this and I‚Äôm forcing myself to stay awake so I can prepare for my night shifts at work. 

Now to the spooky stuff,  4 experiences so far.

My first experience was getting home at 6:30 am, I jumped straight in the shower and my partner was down the country for a concert. I was home alone so I left the door open, as I was getting out I looked towards the door to check if there was a towel and I saw a forehead with long black hair hanging around the door. I instantly shrugged it off to me being beyond tired and went straight to bed. 

2nd experience, I work 12 hour shifts so I get a lot of days off during the week. My partner was at work and I was playing on my PC, I had my headset off and I heard the loudest crash coming from my kitchen. I instantly thought I left the coffee jar on the edge of the counter as I was just in there. So I ran into the kitchen and it was spotless I checked all cupboards. (Feel like it‚Äôs a good time to mention that my partner bought a ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù cross from a French mosque off eBay) lol. Anyways that was tilted slightly but the weight distribution on that has never been the best it was juts strange how that was in the room it happened in. (No im not blaming the cross)

3rd was when I actually started to panic. I just brushed my teeth and was in the doorway to the bedroom talking to my partner who was in bed. As I turned to go get a drink from the kitchen I felt the loudest ‚ÄúHSSSSS‚Äù right next to my neck. I did not turn around and slickly shut the door behind me an flopped on the bed. My partner didn‚Äôt hear this and laughed at my actions I told her and she looked worried as she has had many weird thing happen to her but that‚Äôs for another time as I don‚Äôt want to bore ppl.

4th time. This just happened about 20 minutes ago from me writing this and my adrenaline is still going. I‚Äôm staying up till like 5AM for the next few nights as I‚Äôm going to start my night shifts so I wanted to prepare my pattern. I was alone in the living room I was watching American Dad and drinking my beer When all off a sudden I heard the loudest hiss of my life like gas. I shot up in the dark trying to locate the noise and it was a lighter that has been sat there for months it‚Äôs practically empty so we don‚Äôt use it. Anyways it‚Äôs late and I‚Äôm on edge so I go straight to wake my partner up I‚Äôm panicking because I‚Äôve not experienced a lighter do this and wanted to know what to do. She told me to go run it under a tap so I go to the kitchen and turn the light on. This is what really made my heart drop the lighter looks like it‚Äôs been yanked off at the top. I tell my partner and she tells me the bedroom door kept opening slightly after she shut it but didn‚Äôt want to tell me.

So I‚Äôve been playing this all off until now. I do now believe in the paranormal, I‚Äôm a brave guy I‚Äôd like to think but as soon as that 4th thing happened I quickly turned everything off grabbed my beer now I‚Äôm safe in bed. 


I‚Äôm sorry for the grammar I‚Äôm tired also I‚Äôve tried keeping this as short as possible.

1idc43j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1idc43j/update_wibta_my_19f_boyfriend_27m_lied_to_me_for/,UPDATE! WIBTA: My (19F) boyfriend (27M) lied to me for a year and I don‚Äôt know if I can forgive him.,"Hi! It‚Äôs been over a month. A lot of stuff has happened so I decided to give an update. 

For those who haven‚Äôt seen my other submissions: my ex boyfriend and I met on my 18th birthday in a club and he was 26 at the time. We were together for a year when I found out that apparently we weren‚Äôt strangers as he said and he actually knew me for years before i actually met him. He had pictures of me, I broke up with him while a police officer helped me get my things from his house. He was mad, my parents were mad at me. My sister was the only one supporting me. He somehow manipulated the judges and escaped. The restraining order was revoked. 

So let‚Äôs start from that day on. He never bothered me as I thought he‚Äôd do. But he definitely didn‚Äôt stay away either. It was my niece‚Äôs birthday recently and he was there. My sister invited my ex boyfriend who literally stalked me since I was 12. Everyone was acting all normal with him while they all ignored me. I never felt more useless in my life. So I just gave my niece her present and left. I then started getting suspicious of my mom. She said that I was making a big deal out of this but she knows that this is serious. I know I shouldn‚Äôt have but I decided to talk to Chris again. I asked him if he wanted to grab a coffee and discuss everything without lying. All my suspicions were true. He did have my information, and when I was 16 he said that he wanted to approach me because that‚Äôs the age of consent but he would still be under suspicion so he just waited until I was 18.


But he did approach my parents when I was 17, he said that he‚Äôd provide for me and give me a good life if they just simply let him. And they did, my parents sold me out like a sheep at a farmers market. I am so incredibly devastated. I thanked Chris and just left. Well that‚Äôs where I made the mistake because Chris thought I forgave him. He broke into my apartment in the middle of the night and SA‚Äôd me. I‚Äôve only told my sister because there‚Äôs no point in telling anyone else. Nobody believes me except her. I am currently saving up money to move to a different country because I simply can‚Äôt handle this anymore. Not only did he violate my privacy but he violated me as a human being. I can still feel his hands on me. I blame myself for even deciding to meet up with such a sick person but I can‚Äôt change what happened. 


I saw him 1 week ago at our old favourite caf√© and he was with my sister. I always felt like my sister had a crush on him but I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd go this far. She saw me and tried to kiss him but he just pushed her away. He tried to talk to me but I couldn‚Äôt see his face so I walked away. I know deep down that he‚Äôs laughing at me for being so weak. He even told me that he didn‚Äôt expect me to give in so fast, he‚Äôs 6‚Äô7ft tall and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7ft. He obviously overpowered me and made it sound like I wanted it. I 100% didn‚Äôt. I know he‚Äôs laughing at me because I haven‚Äôt told anyone and I know he‚Äôs mocking me because he knows if I told anyone. Nobody would believe me. Apparently in everyone‚Äôs eyes, he‚Äôs a saint. I‚Äôm traumatised and whenever I see an overly large man I flinch. I know they‚Äôre not all the same but it‚Äôs still scary because they somehow morph into Chris. Anyways this was my update! 


Edit: I forgot to mention he recorded me. I don‚Äôt know where but he did record me getting üçá‚Äôed by him. ",1,1738204735.0,AITA_Relationships,9,0.57,False

1idbzpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1idbzpt/a_strange_blackout_outbreak_had_been_happening/,A Strange Blackout Outbreak Had Been Happening,"I had been experiencing recurring blackouts.

The exact starting point of this condition eluded my memory, but over time, the frequency of these blackouts had been increasing. Furthermore, each blackout seemed to last longer than the previous ones.

On a particular day, I found myself abruptly awakened in a public park, two miles away from my home, with no recollection of how I had arrived there. The last thing I could recall before blacking out was leaving an apartment, intending to cross the street and visit a nearby coffee shop.

Realizing that I needed assistance, I made the decision to consult a doctor.

I proceeded to disclose to the doctor all the details I knew about my recurrent blackouts. I shared when they first started, how they manifested, and the locations where I would find myself after regaining consciousness.

The doctor‚Äôs gaze felt oddly familiar, as if they‚Äôd heard it before.

""It's quite peculiar,"" the doctor began, looking at me intently. ""You are actually the third patient this week who has described experiencing these blackouts. What's even more surprising is that some of my colleagues in other towns have also encountered several patients with similar blackout patterns.""

""Really? How is it possible? Have they discovered any explanations yet?"" I inquired, filled with a sense of astonishment.

""No explanation has been discovered yet. However, it does seem to resemble an outbreak,"" responded the doctor. He provided me with some medication that he hoped would alleviate the symptoms and assured me that he would reach out if any explanations regarding my case emerged.

Just as I walked out of the clinic, I noticed two men standing in front of the building. One of the men struck me with a stun gun. As my consciousness faded, I glimpsed myself being tossed into an SUV.

Upon regaining consciousness, I found myself bound to a chair in what appeared to be a warehouse. Men clad in military uniforms surrounded me.

""What? Where am I? What is happening?"" I shouted, desperate for answers.

""To put it simply,‚Äù explained the apparent leader,¬†‚ÄúYou are a subject in a military experiment,"" he revealed.

""It's called the 'Human Drone Project.' The objective is to utilize death row convicts, as drones controlled by our agents during missions. We injected false memories into you to prevent you from remembering your true identity and escaping.¬†When our agent takes control of you, you experience a blackout. The purpose is to safeguard our valuable agents' lives in case the mission goes awry,"" he explained.

""The second phase¬†we are about to expedite,¬†involves testing whether shooting down the drone‚Äîyou‚Äîwill impact the lives of our agents,"" he elaborated.

""Now, do you see the soldier sitting right over there?"" he gestured toward a serviceman seated across from me, donning a VR helmet and connected to various wires.

""He will serve as the 'testing pilot,' whereas you..."" He brandished his gun and pointed it directly at my face.

Beer list is great, the Von Trapp Golden Lager was delicious and fresh, and I KNOW that every slice that comes out of that oven is perfectly crafted.

However, 

I can't reasonably give Otto Brookline 5/5 stars for one diabolical reason. Upon looking deeper in to the tap menu, I noticed a typo. Golden ""Larger"". 

Ok no problem - we joke about it, order a Golden Larger and *cheers*. I've worked in the industry long enough to understand that menus can change faster than my ex after a few jello shots, so a typo is forgivable.

""unicron"". There's another. You spelled ""Unicorn"" correctly in the beer name....how did you miss it in the description? Now I'm invested. Full edit mode.

Belgum. Autocorrect won't even allow me to misspell Belgium. Was this typed up on Microsoft Word 2004?

another ""larger"".....this time lowercase. Sigh.

MACACHUSETTS. Holy hell this is absurd. Another example of spelling it correctly just moments later, yet you were able to pump out a Macachusetts seemingly just to carry on this sick and twisted trend of errors.

After identifying the absurd amount of spelling errors, I was horrified to see that this was only the beginning. The menu is a grammatical nightmare.

""8 %"". Sometimes we'll put a comma next to the state initials, sometimes we'll just fogetaboutit! Should we use ""and"" or an ampersand? Let's use both in no particular order - why the hell not. ""Balance of sweet & Tart""....capital letters Have no meaning or place. Should we put a period at the end of this description? Yes, but only sometimes. Only when we feel so inclined.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1idbw7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/MTHFR/comments/1idbw7d/symptoms_resurged_after_years_being_held_at_bay/,Symptoms resurged after years being held at bay by supplements from Seeking Health,"Hello! I found out 10 years ago that I had some MTHFR SNPs. At that time I was experiencing severe depression, brain fog, joint pain, and intestinal distress, and among things I found to help was cutting all gluten. So I was GF but still suffering quite a bit when I discovered this, and with supplementation things got so much better that over time I ceased to identify as a person who needed to avoid bread/gluten/etc. Now I don't eat that much of it, but I do eat it sometimes. 

Anyway this winter my symptoms were back in full force. I thought maybe I was depressed because of, like, life, and age, and stuff, but then suddenly I put some pieces together and I grabbed my beloved pre-workout and Oh NO! This contains cyanocobalamin! Of course! I broke my methylation cycle again!

I got some Sam-e to help me get the wheels turning again, and now that I can like, sit down and do research again because my brain is actually functioning, I'm getting fascinated revisiting all this stuff from 10 years ago. 

My ++:  
VDR Taq  
MTRR A66G¬†

My +-:  
MAO A R297R¬†  
MTHFR C677T¬†  
MTR A2756G¬†  
MTRR A664A¬†  
BHMT¬≠02  
BHMT¬≠08¬†  
CBS C699T¬†

I notice in this round of research I'm like: oh, I had forgotten how critical it is for me to supplement D, and   
oh, I thought cyanocobalamin was poisoning me, but maybe it's actually folic acid. 

  
I remember that back in the day, early on in my depression journey, a doctor had prescribed me a form of like prescription-strength folate, and the week after I tried taking it my joints (esp knees) hurt so badly that I hobbled around. So, I did not continue, and always kind of imagined that I must already have plenty of folate. 

But maybe not! Maybe I was critically low in b12 when I tried that. So, next thing for me to try is switching from Seeking Health's Homocystex Plus to a methylfolate + cofactors supplement. 

I'm pretty sure that I need less niacin than I am getting with Homocystex, anyway. My mom once had a TERRIBLE reaction to a SINGLE niacin supplement that put her in the hospital for 36 hours. I would like less of that with my folate... but that may be superstitious -- or at least overly-cautious. Like my avoidance of methylfolate. 

Would love to discuss with anyone who wants to futz with my case. Very happy to take suggestions on how to improve my health and brain state and nutrition.   
  
For reference: I usually eat very little bread/pasta/beer etc but this winter spent a lot of time with family in the midwest due to some family stuff going on and they eat pizza, pasta, or lasagna pretty much on a loop. I do eat vegetables and meat every day. I am also a person who easily becomes addicted to coffee or any other stimulant I allow myself. ",1,1738204143.0,MTHFR,1,1.0,False

Feels like a rubber band is squeezing my brain from sun-up to sundown. I'm struggling hard with electrolytes. 

I'm (36F). Diet in a nutshell if it helps - I mostly eat chicken, thighs/breasts/Rotisserie with veggies, peppers/onions/Asparagus/broccoli or things like cottage cheese, bacon and eggs, steak or salad. For snacks I'll usually have almonds, Pepperoni, summer sausage, cheese or pickles/olives. Occasional strawberries and raspberries. 

I'm so used to Omad and now combined with the lowered appetite, it's really hard to eat more than once a day. I've lost about 7 pounds of water weight already. I do drink a good amount of water throughout the day. I am staying away from coffee and tea to prevent further dehydration. I don't drink alcohol. 

I know the suggested electrolyte ratios from FAQ with sodium being the big one I'm probably struggling with. I tried Himalayan salt tablets to help me supplement and they are just making me throw up, even with food.

I literally don't know how to get to 5000. I've tried adding salt to zero sugar gatoraid, keto electrolyte supplements, chicken broth with salt, salt under my tongue, drinking pickle juice, salting the shit out of my food... I can't seem to manage more than about 2500mg a day. Excedrin is no longer working.

To create a low-pressure dating app that connects shy, socially anxious users with extroverts who appreciate their quiet authenticity, fostering meaningful relationships through shared interests and anxiety-friendly communication tools.  

---

Key Features:

1. Icebreaker Bios:

   - Replace traditional bios with fun prompts (e.g., ‚ÄúMy ideal date is...‚Äù or ‚ÄúI could talk for hours about‚Ä¶‚Äù).  
   - Users self-identify traits like *‚Äúshy but curious‚Äù or ‚Äúextrovert who loves quiet souls.‚Äù

2. Comfort Zones:

   - Set preferred communication styles upfront: ‚ÄúStart with texting,‚Äù ‚ÄúSend voice notes first,‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlay a game to break the ice.‚Äù

3. Gentle Nudge Mode:

   - Extroverts can send pre-written compliments (e.g., ‚ÄúYour music taste is awesome!‚Äù) to initiate conversations without overwhelming shy users.  

4. Gradual Unlock Chat:

   - Progress from anonymous text ‚Üí voice notes ‚Üí photos/video calls as mutual comfort grows.  

5. Interest-Based Groups:

   - Join communities like ‚ÄúAnime Lovers‚Äù or ‚ÄúCaf√© Date Planners‚Äù to connect organically over hobbies.  

6. Safety & Boundaries:

   - Pop-up reminders to respect pacing (e.g., ‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt responded yet‚Äîgive them time!‚Äù).  
   - Zero tolerance for bullying or fetishizing shyness.  

---

Monetization:

- Premium Tier: Advanced filters (e.g., ‚Äúmatch me only with extroverts‚Äù), unlimited icebreakers, virtual ‚Äúcozy date‚Äù templates.  
- In-App Purchases: Send virtual gifts (e.g., digital coffee, books) or customize avatars.  
- Partnerships: Collaborate with mental health orgs for social anxiety resources.  

---

Why It Works:

- Reframes shyness as a strength: Celebrates introversion instead of forcing users to ‚Äúperform‚Äù extroversion.  
- Bridges a gap: Many extroverts crave genuine connections with shy partners but struggle to meet them on traditional apps.  
- Reduces anxiety: Features like anonymous chat and gradual unlocks empower shy users to engage at their own pace.  

---

Feedback Requested:
1. Would shy users feel safe using this? What features are missing?  
2. Would extroverts find value in the ‚ÄúGentle Nudge‚Äù and planning tools?  
3. Potential pitfalls or concerns?

I have been on the carnivore diet for two months. The diet has ruined my digestive system. I can only eat meat or eggs and was having diarrhea everyday. Out of despair I started eating potatoes like twenty days ago. However, Last night I didn't eat anything, as I was going to kill myself if I had any meat or eggs and we did not have potatoes. I slept fine, woke up, went to the event for my dog, and then went to work. Within the first 30 minutes I had a normal poop, however throughout the day I needed to defecate and was surprised that the only thing coming out of me was a clear slimy discharge. It was troubling, however I figured there was nothing left in my system to create poop from. I went home and in the first hour I found the same: a clear ectoplasm was expulsed from my rectum. I ended up eating two brats for dinner and felt fine. Afterwards, my partner (23f) surprised me with a ""Rebel"" coffee ice cream. It is keto, has no sugar, and is lactose free. I figured, this is an okay thing to cheat with. It was delicious, but lacked the normal creaminess of a standard pint of ice cream. I stopped with a 1/3 left and saved it for later. I went back down to watch TV with my partner and started to feel my stomach grumble, and some gas pass. This was normal, as I just ate and previously had nothing in my system. Lo and behold I felt a violent rumble in my gut and a violent fart that resulted in two bubbles of gas escaping my anal urethra and in an out of body moment reached down to the bottom of my pants fearing the worst ...

It was wet. 
I rushed to the bathroom.  
...
...
There was only small stains. 
Thank god. 
I sat on the toilet assuming it was the clear slimy from earlier and wanted to get it all out.  
So.
With one squeeze...
BOOM

I (f30) used to be very close to a friend for over 5 years when we were early 20s. Long story short she had very toxic traits and was a little bit jealous when I had met my now husband.

Over the years I‚Äôve wished her happy bday etc etc and she did the same when I get married & engaged.


It‚Äôs been around 5 years since I‚Äôve seen her & she is now dating my husbands close friend. I did reach out to her to let her know I‚Äôm happy for her & let her know I‚Äôd be happy to organise group things with extended group. I was actually excited to hear she would be in the extended group. 

The convo is going fine and we are speaking a bit- do you think it‚Äôs normal to reconnect with people after a few years.

Some additional information: I sample roasted a bunch of green these past two weeks and moved forward with five coffees. Based on people's responses (I only have enough for 20 testers this time around) we'll move forward with one or two of the coffees and take them to production (\~20-60lb batches depending on the coffee). I decided to keep the coffees unknown to reduce some bias, so they are labeled 1-5. My ask is for you to submit a review for the five coffees, or maybe we'll make a spreadsheet (if anyone has ideas let me know). We'll then move forward with the winning coffees. If this goes well, I'll try to scale it up. Getting access to green in small amounts like this to sample roast is tricky though, but we'll see. Let me know if you have any questions.

I provided a rough cost breakdown below for the R&D samples for anyone who wanted to see the price breakdown. I'm not trying to make any money with the R&D stuff. Just having fun and experimenting to see how this goes. The list price on the site is $9.99 to compensate my time and misc. logistics to organize this because I probably missed some random cost here and there.

1idbkgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1idbkgb/all_of_my_friends_are_in_a_relationship_except_me/,"All of my friends are in a relationship, except me","I‚Äôm 25M and have never in my life been in a relationship. I‚Äôve never been bothered by it up until recently.

So, amongst my friend group, for years and years that we known each other, me and three other friends have never experienced a relationship, never bothered nor cared for it. And then, all of a sudden, the three of them have a girlfriend. And I need to tell you how much blind luck they have. 

To anyone about to say ‚ÄúA relationship doesn't just fall out of the sky.‚Äù or ‚ÄúLove is just pure luck that happened when you least expect it.‚Äù... Oh boy. Please don't start on that.

First friend, one night we were out drinking. As soon as we were gonna call it a night and head home, my friend‚Äôs friend messages him that he needs backup and support for a girl that he‚Äôs trying to hit on. Ok, so we head to the bar where he was at, find them and sit by their table. What happened was the complete opposite that night. The girl was hitting on my friend instead of her date.

They‚Äôve been in a relationship ever since. And I was happy and glad for him. I don't remember seeing him this happy and bright in a long time.

Second friend, he‚Äôs known to never step out of the house unless somebody calls him to go out. Literally, I‚Äôm mean like the sun doesn‚Äôt see his face AT ALL. He‚Äôs either 24/7 online, or out with one of us, no third option. Then all of a sudden, a female friend of his connected him with her friend because her friend was looking for a boyfrend‚Ä¶ And what do you know, he‚Äôs way more less spending time closed in his room and with us and is spending more time with her. At this point I‚Äôm starting to feel jealous and salty.

Third friend. For this one, a small backstory is needed.

At my college, a student‚Äôs cafe was recently opened at the time. On the first few days since it‚Äôs opening, me and my friend were sitting, chilling, waiting for the next class to start. All of a sudden, two girls approach us and sit at our table. They were waiting for their friend to come and pick them up, since they were done with their classes for the day. The four of us were talking, laughting, etc. At one point, one of them started to take a liking towards me. She complement me on how sweet and cute I am and that we should talk more. And not long after, their friend came to pick them up, they and left.

Wow. Has my turn finally come? My friend motivated me and commented that I should definitely try something tomorrow. Surely, she will come tomorrow, right? Am I right? Tomorrow comes, nothing. Next day, nothing. And the next day, nothing. Have I been talking to a ghost? I never even seen her at college, and I mean it‚Äôs impossible to miss someone considering how my college is small.

Anyway, fast forward to a few weeks later. At that cafe there is about 15 people there who are regulars everyday (me and my friend included). Everyone knows each other there, and believe it or not, every single girl there is in a relationship already.

One day, I was alone sitting at my table practicing one more time before an upcoming test. I notice a new face at the cafe, someone who‚Äôs not a regular. I‚Äôve seen her a few times, but just doesn't spend much time there. Either takes a seat or  picks up a coffee and leaves right away. 

The next week, I wasn't able to attend college due to private reasons. And you know where this is headed‚Ä¶ My friend and her are dating. How? All of a sudden, she approached him to play cards. Out of nowhere. At this point, I seriously want to give up.

All these three stories happened within less than 2 months. Now, almost 6 months passed, and all of them are still in a happy relationship. 




Am I really this much unlucky? They did absolutely nothing and just clicked. They just plain existed in time and space at the moment. What about me? When is luck going to start bullshiting me?

I don‚Äôt want to sound desperate, but I am going to start being desperate at this point and start seeking a relationship.

I‚Äôm tired of hearing the same old question from my parents and friends ‚ÄúWhen will you find a girlfriend?‚Äù. Oh well I don't know, why don‚Äôt YOU give me the answer that question? Because everyone keeps telling me and taught me that it will just eventually happen by itself. When will that be huh? When I‚Äôm 50 maybe? No‚Ä¶ if I should wait for everything in life, than what's the point in doing anything? 

I‚Äôm tired if waiting, I want to start taking initiative. Because, obviously, I have no luck.

I have the looks and height. I‚Äôm confident in myself, but I‚Äôm a bit introverted. I should work on that. Any tips appreciated. And no, please don't recommend dating apps, I don't wanna feel even more miserable. 

I am in the middle of my 20s soon to be 26 and nearing 30. I just want to experience love for once damn it.
