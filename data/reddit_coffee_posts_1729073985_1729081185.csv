I’m a 30-year-old trans woman based in East Sussex, and I’m hoping to connect with some of you who are also in the area. It can sometimes feel like we’re spread out across the country, but I’m hoping there are some people closer to home who would be up for chatting, grabbing coffee, or just sharing experiences.

I’ve been on HRT for 5 months and navigating this journey like a lot of us—balancing work, family, and everything in between. It would be really nice to get to know more people in the local trans community, whether you’re early in your transition or further along. I’m pretty easygoing and love a good chat about anything, from trans topics to tech (I work in software), movies, or just life in general.

So if you’re in East Sussex or nearby and feel like connecting, give me a shout! It’d be great to make some new friends around here. 😊

All the best,

1g4xws7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1g4xws7/the_ultimate_guide_to_designing_an_outdoor_living/,The Ultimate Guide to Designing an Outdoor Living Room,"An outdoor living room is the perfect way to extend your home's living space into the open air, creating a comfortable and stylish area to relax, entertain, and enjoy nature. With thoughtful design choices, you can transform your patio, deck, or garden into an outdoor oasis that feels as cozy and functional as any indoor room. In this guide, we'll walk you through the essential elements of designing the ultimate outdoor living room, incorporating must-have pieces like [bar carts](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/bar-carts), [rattan benches](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/rattan-benches), and [hanging chairs](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/hanging-chairs) to elevate your space.

**1. Start with the Layout**

The first step in designing an outdoor living room is planning the layout. Consider the size of your space and how you want to use it. Do you envision a cozy seating area for intimate gatherings or a larger space for entertaining guests? Identify zones for different activities, such as lounging, dining, or serving drinks. A well-thought-out layout ensures your space flows seamlessly and maximizes functionality.

**2. Comfortable Seating Options**

Seating is a key component of any outdoor living room. To create a space where people can unwind, opt for a mix of seating types that cater to different needs:

**Rattan benches:** These versatile pieces provide ample seating while adding texture and warmth to your space. Rattan's natural look blends effortlessly with outdoor environments, and its durability makes it ideal for year-round use.

**Hanging chairs:** Perfect for adding a touch of whimsy and comfort, hanging chairs create a cozy spot to lounge and enjoy the breeze. They’re also great for creating a relaxed, boho vibe.

Lounge chairs, sofas, and poufs can complete the seating arrangement, ensuring there’s a comfortable place for everyone.

**3. Create Ambiance with Lighting**

Lighting is crucial for setting the mood in your outdoor living room. Soft, ambient lighting creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, perfect for evening relaxation or hosting guests. Consider using:

String lights for a magical, starry-night effect.

Lanterns or pendant lights for a more formal and structured look.

Solar-powered lights to enhance eco-friendliness.

Position lighting strategically to illuminate key areas, such as seating zones and walkways, without overpowering the natural beauty of the outdoors.

**4. Add Functional Style with Bar Carts**

A bar cart is a stylish and practical addition to your outdoor living room. It serves as a convenient spot to mix and serve drinks while keeping everything you need within arm’s reach. Opt for a bar cart with wheels for easy mobility, allowing you to move it around depending on your event’s needs. Stock it with glassware, a few cocktail essentials, and perhaps even some snacks to keep your guests refreshed during those long summer afternoons.

**5. Outdoor Rugs and Textiles**

To make your outdoor living room feel more like a traditional indoor space, consider adding an outdoor rug. This will not only anchor your seating area but also add warmth and texture underfoot. Choose a durable, weather-resistant material that can handle the elements without sacrificing style.

Incorporate cushions, throws, and pillows in outdoor-friendly fabrics to enhance comfort and give your seating a cozy, plush look. Mix and match colors and patterns to reflect your personal style, whether it's bright and bold or more neutral and serene.

**6. Decor and Accessories**

Personalize your outdoor living room with decor that enhances its charm and functionality. Potted plants, ceramic vases, and outdoor artwork can bring color and life to your space. Consider using rattan baskets to store extra cushions or blankets, and add small side tables or stools for extra convenience.

Don't forget to layer in accessories that provide both form and function. Use weather-resistant trays on your bar cart for serving drinks or snacks, and place outdoor candle holders on tables for added ambiance in the evening.

**7. Weather-Proofing and Durability**

When choosing furniture and accessories for your outdoor living room, it’s essential to select weather-resistant materials. Opt for furniture made from materials like teak, metal, or all-weather wicker. Items like rattan benches and hanging chairs should be treated or designed for outdoor use to ensure they last through different weather conditions.

Also, consider investing in protective covers for your furniture and textiles to keep them looking fresh for years to come.

**8. Incorporate Natural Elements**

Bringing in natural elements like wood, stone, and greenery can help blend your outdoor living room with its surroundings. Potted plants, hanging planters, or a vertical garden can make the space feel lush and inviting. You can also introduce natural textures through your furniture choices, like rattan benches or a wooden coffee table.

**Conclusion**

Designing the ultimate outdoor living room is all about creating a space that balances comfort, style, and functionality. With the right layout, seating, lighting, and decor, you can transform any outdoor area into a stylish retreat perfect for lounging, entertaining, or dining. By incorporating essential pieces like bar carts, rattan benches, and hanging chairs, you'll have a space that's not only beautiful but also practical and versatile for enjoying the great outdoors year-round.",1,1729080867.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to have a discussion about something I’ve experienced recently. I’ve had chronic migraines for 15 years, starting when I was 9. They have changed over the years, but recently, after giving birth to my daughter, they have seemingly disappeared!

I’m just curious if anyone else has had this experience? 

I had come to terms with the fact that I would always have migraines, I even had some of the worst migraines of my life while I was pregnant (I drank a pepsi one day, big mistake, and half of my body went numb when previously the most that would go numb was my one hand and half my face, not to mention the other symptoms of aura, nausea etc). 

I gave birth 7 months ago, and I haven’t had so much as a bad headache since, let alone a migraine.

They were fairly under control before I got pregnant since I was getting botox every 12 weeks for the past 5ish years, but caffeine and strong perfumes/smells were still major triggers for me.

Now, I drink coffee daily, no migraines, no headaches, nothing. I hadn’t drank coffee in 10 years!

Has anyone else been cured of migraines by giving birth? Genuinely curious if I am just extremely lucky or if this is “normal”",1,1729080716.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

I have never had any issues until this morning and someone said “it’s policy” that they are not allowed, at the same store that they just allowed it for weeks at. They also charged me extra for it today which has not happened any other time.

Lately, I've realized that I've been contaminated to the point where it's affecting my everyday life. It's gotten so bad that even my friends have started to notice—and they're definitely concerned. I’ll be doing something as simple as picking up my phone and out of nowhere, I’ll blurt out, ""Tuh my ta? Umm ta."" My friends will just stare at me, completely bewildered, probably wondering if I’ve invented some alien language they weren’t clued into. I see the confusion on their faces, and I can't can't do anything but stifle a laugh. 

It doesn’t stop there. It’s like Zy0x has wormed his way into every corner of my daily activities. I'll be in the middle of a conversation, and suddenly, out comes the exaggerated, drawn-out ""OH MY GOD I'M BLOOMING,"" even if it has nothing to do with the topic at hand. The worst is when it just slips out while doing something mundane, like opening a fridge or missing a bus. My friends? They either ignore it at this point or try to pretend like they understand, but I know deep down they're questioning my sanity.

Sometimes, I even catch myself moaning when I’m frustrated. I swear, it's just this weird reflex I’ve picked up, and it doesn’t help when I repeatedly say ""sorry, sorry, sorry"" right after. My friends have asked, “Why do you keep apologizing for the same thing five times? Once is enough.” They just don’t get that once I start, it's almost like I can't stop. The repetition feels necessary, even if it makes me sound like a complete dumbass. 

All this is fine when I'm alone or online, but it's when I’m out in public, doing normal things like ordering coffee or hanging out with friends, that things get really awkward.

I have regular bowel movements and can eat almost everything apart from lactose, coffe and alcohol. Was wondering  if there could be something else than sibo? Feeling a bit lost on what is going on and how to get healthy.

Symptoms:

* abdominal discomfort/tightness
* constant headache
* extreme fatigue

The headache and brain fog get worse if I eat something bad like lactose, coffee or alcohol so it is surely something gut related. Everything else I can eat. The discomfort does not bother me but the headache and fatigue are killing me. My GI doc said its a bit weird that sibo patient usually don't have headache issues.

Antibiotics:

* First round of metronidazole cleared up my brain fog (had some herx).
* Now I am on second round with rifaximin, which I will finish in 2 days but I don't feel any difference whatsoever (no herx).

Was reading about SIFO, but I actually did a blood test which confirms I don't have candida. I am still considering trying Nystatin which some people have helped about the brain fog and fatigue.

Tested for lyme which I am negative. Did blood work, CT and xray which are all a-okay.

Tried eating normally - felt the same, tried low fodmap - felt the same. Now I will try sibo specific diet which is basically carnivore with some fruits and veg.

Also tested my stomach acid levels with beatine hcl. If I eat 1000mg of hcl I get heartburn so I take only one pill. Which I interpret as sufficiend acid levels. Correct me if I am wrong.

Why would the antibiotics not work? Could there be something else? I find it a bit odd that I can eat almost everything and have regular bowel movements.",1,1729080066.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

I’ve known her for 2 years now and my crush developed in the last year or so. She’s gorgeous, soft-spoken, intelligent, and very feminine. I started realizing I really liked her because I’d start getting nervous around her and because I’d think about her outside of work. Between us, we have kind of a professional relationship, not really anything personal. We both are teachers and we teach similar subjects. 

Usually when I’m in public, I put on a mask that I’m very confident, but deep down I’m not. I’m currently going to therapy for this so I can change how I talk to myself. Anyways, at the end of my shift yesterday I was feeling very tired and drained, I didn’t feel like talking to anybody. All of a sudden at the end of the shift, she approached to talk to me. I was kind of flustered and long story short, I was so fucking awkward. Usually, I’m not like this around her, I’m generally more confident because of the mask I put in public. I really wanna ask her out for coffee, but I can’t muster up the courage to do so, probably because I put her on a pedestal and how I talk to myself. 

I feel like I get signs from her though.  The other day she told me that I’d be such a good “girl dad” (I usually give off like big brother vibes to my students, I’m funny but also strict with them). Btw I’m not sure what exactly that means tbh. She also finds me funny when I am confident, and smiles whenever I say hi to her. I really want to ask her out for coffee, but my thoughts are against me. I’m sick and tired of small talk with her, I thrive on deep conversations that are meaningful.

So I went on a first date with this guy over a month ago. Just a coffee for 1 hour. It was nice and he suggested meeting again and I agreed. 

So a week later we're texting and I say I'm headed to travel for about 2 weeks if he'd like to catch up before. He says he's also going travelling and will be busy. We discuss that we're both back the 14th so we'll catch up then. 

We're texting at a rate of about a message a day about what we're up to and where we are.

I'm on my way home and I just mentioned in one of my messages how we'll have to catch up once we're both back (since this is what we talked about). He kind of brushes it off and continues his texts and how he's planning his next trip. 

So flash forward to now its been a month since our first date. We haven't planned anything for the time we're both in the city as we talked about. He hasn't made any effort in response to my text to at least try to find time that would suit us both. I'm headed off again for a week to travel (side note: I'm a flight attendant who travels for work and in between I backpack, whilst he's unemployed in between jobs travelling the odd weekend).

Is it reasonable that I ended things? Or was it unreasonable since he's busy? I just feel like I've technically been out of town more than him but I've made efforts while he hasn't. I just feel like a month is too long to leave it without any plans set since it was just a coffee... I'm just lost interest honestly. I've had this in the past and when I asked about planning a second date (after a month also) the situation was that they were seeing someone else in the meantime despite texting me constantly everyday lol.

A while back, I was working on an app that helped travelers find hidden gem cafes and coworking spaces (I’m a big coffee and remote work fan). At first, I was just winging it with vanilla React Native, but things got messy real quick. That’s when I started using frameworks like Expo and Ignite, and it completely changed the game. Expo, for instance, was like a Swiss Army knife for mobile development—it handled all the headaches like native code, push notifications, and app store submissions. If you’re new to React Native, Expo is perfect because it simplifies the process while still letting you build powerful apps. Plus, with Ignite, I found that the boilerplate code gave me a great head start, and their pre-built components saved me hours of work!

One thing I learned the hard way is that while frameworks are super helpful, you’ve got to pick the right one based on your project. For my travel app, Expo worked wonders because I didn’t need deep customization of native features. But if you’re building something more complex, you might want to eject from Expo at some point and dive into native code. Another fun challenge was managing state across the app—I used Redux, but some people prefer using the Context API or other libraries like MobX. If I could give one piece of advice, it’s to not shy away from using these frameworks; they make your life so much easier. Just keep experimenting until you find the right tools that fit your project’s needs!

Curious about what makes your favorite Starbucks coffee so special beyond the beans? In ""Pour Your Heart Into It,"" Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, shares the inspiring story of how unwavering dedication to quality and a vibrant work culture turned a small coffeehouse into a global icon.

**Core Principles Drive Success**  
Starbucks' journey is a testament to the power of authenticity and consistency. Despite challenges like the 1994 coffee crisis, they refused to compromise on quality, opting to cut costs elsewhere rather than switch to cheaper beans. This dedication to their core product cemented customer loyalty.

**Stubborn Persistence Pays Off**  
Howard Schultz’s relentless determination is key. After initially being rejected by Starbucks' founders, his persistence led him to eventually acquire the company, transforming it into the billion-dollar enterprise we know today.

**Trust and Teamwork**  
Starbucks fosters a culture of trust, treating employees as partners with benefits like stock options. This approach has reduced turnover and strengthened customer relationships through familiar faces and personalized service.

**Innovative Growth and Collaboration**  
Starbucks isn’t afraid to invest ahead of the curve or explore collaborations, like their partnership with Pepsi, which expanded their reach. Innovation and strategic partnerships have allowed them to introduce new products and rejuvenate their brand.

**Staying True to Values**  
Even as they expand, Starbucks holds fast to its principles, from treating employees well to addressing environmental concerns. This commitment ensures the brand’s authenticity and strengthens loyalty.

[$200],"I've been drinking large lattes all my life but got into better and better coffee experiences lately. I'm at the crossroads in deciding if I should upgrade my machine first or buy better accessories, like grinder, portafilter and tamper.  
I have a really cheap Sencor espresso machine, this: [https://www.sencor.com/espresso-machine/ses-1710bk](https://www.sencor.com/espresso-machine/ses-1710bk)

I had it for 3 years now and it's doing a good job and I didn't have any technical issues with it either. As I found a medium dark roasted coffee that I really liked, started to pay more attention to how I tamper I got better and better results. I know that I drink my coffee with a lot of milk, but the quality of the coffee still matters a lot to me. It's not bitter, it's creamy and got a lot of praise from guests as well that I got a pretty good espresso out of it.

As much as I would love to, I just can't really reason why I should upgrade to a Delonghi Dedica that has been recommended here a lot. Based on what I read here, it would make more sense to put the same amount of money to upgrade my shitty grinder, buy a good portafilter, unpressurized basket and tamper. Especially when I already like the result of the Sencor 70% of the time, and the goal would be for that number to be closer to 100%, not the overall huge improvement of the quality.

I’m still not seeing the results I want. I’d like my waist to be at least 24-25 inches. 

I had emsculpt + exilis done in the past couple of weeks but results take about a month to show up. 

I personally think that my issue is my diet - I eat very clean (no sugar, no coffee, no junk food, limited alcohol) but my protein intake is limited. i take about a scoop and half of protein powder a day which is about 24g.

What I would also appreciate from you is help me understand is he covertly controlling and/or manipulative depending on the things I will provide before I explain the argument.

He is generally amazing, we can talk about any topic, he helps a lot around home, makes us meals often, brings bouquets, is very attentive with gifts. Everybody loves him.

However, he initially was extremely protective over me. For example, he once pushed me back when I wanted to cross a road where car was far away, so he made a fuss over it how I am careless and he only got one of me. This concerned me a lot, but we resolved it in a way that I accepted it as his way of caring about me.

Once, we talked about traveling and most of the countries I bring up to visit he finds as unsafe, like something bad can happen there and I got so fed up that I said I am not restricting myself because I am careful enough and anything can happen everywhere anyways. A brick could fall on me anywhere if it is to happen.

At some point I asked would it be okay if I got to go somewhere as a business trip, he got upset as to why would I want to travel without him, saying he would cancel his business trip if he couldn't bring his wife.

Also, possibility of traveling anywhere without him also is not okay with him as why would I do it as a married woman. Like, are we unity or not.

Then I asked him what about moving to another country if we got better opportunity, he is against it, like there is nowhere better then where we are right now. Whereas, I was always open about it as I see it as an immense learning experience.

Now we live in a city and he expressed how he would like us to move to the country side and have a farm. I was not okay with it saying what about opportunities to grow that cities give. And if we ever have children, how are we going to give them opportunities if there is nothing except farms and people generally move out of that specific place, especially young ones. He didn't take it well saying how I don't understand what liberty of life country side gives and farming is the future. Like, people will always need food.

I grew up in a healthy family where I valued the trust I had with my parents and how much they taught me through wisdom and understanding. When we talked about how harder it would be to raise the kids in today society, with me specifically being overwhelmed with how much work it is and how we need to keep growing ourselves in order to raise kids properly, he said how it is bad if I only give trust and talk nicely to our kids as my parents did. And that he would be intentionally pi*sing them off at some point to teach them to stand up for themselves and put boundaries, by being their enemy. I tried to explain what damage that could do and he didn't acknowledge it.

Then he started commenting on how independence and individuality are wrongly executed referring to my behaviour.

Finally, I asked him about executing our alone times. He prefers it at home and says I have a room where I can go and do anything I want on my own. I told him how my style before usually was going to a random coffee shop for a reading, studying, whatever. At some point he said he would be okay with it, but made that face how he is uncomfortable with it. He also said I'm not a teenager or a college student to study at coffee shops, but whatever.

So, over a course of a year of us being together and married, I barely went out alone. We work together, live together, go out with friends and family together.

So, one day at work I decided to go out to buy something. Saw him on a way out talking to the colleagues and going to play some games with them in our office's relax area. We waved at each other. And then I decided, why wouldn't I go for a cup of a coffee as a break. So, he calls me about an hour later asking where I am. I tell him and he gets angry saying I should have let him know I am going for a coffee, as he was done with work an hour and a half ago and could have gone home without waiting for me and am I sorry for wasting his time. I said why he didn't tell me that? I wouldn't want him to wait for me. We finish at the same time but it is extremely rare we are free that early. He said that when he got the news I seemed busy with work for him to tell me. I said, you saw me going out of the office while you were with the colleagues and said nothing, only called me an hour later? He dismissed it hard saying that I should have told him that I am on a coffee. And I couldn't put up with his statements anymore and said that obviously this is not the problem, rather the fact that I went out alone. I even pointed out how he told me that studying on a cup of coffee is college type and he said it wasn't an insult, it was just his opinion and besides, I am still a student so it applies to me. And I'm like, are you serious? You told me that in a criticizing way, not as an opinion. And he just rolled back to his opinion that I should have let him know I went for the coffee so he didn't waste his time. Then I said if the roles were reversed, I'd just tell him okay and I'm free and we or I can go home or may I join him on that coffee.

I am angry inside, so sorry if this post reflects that state through my writing. Thanks for reading 🤞",7,1729077601.0,abusiverelationships,11,1.0,False

We haven't had anything wierd happen at all besides the occasional sound every now and then that nobody thinks much about. But in the last 6 months or so, the balcony door will open. We live on the third floor (no fire escape). It would happen often enough to where we had to be sticklers about locking the balcony door. The rule is, if you unlock the balcony door, you have to lock it back or it will come open and the cats will get out. 

Well, we stopped having a problem with the door opening all together. Two hours before the time of this posting, I heard something yank the hell out of the balcony door. I'm the first one to wake up at 4am to get ready for work. Today I happened to be sitting in the living room 10 feet away from this door while sipping on some coffee. I heard the door handle squeak and the door yank really hard, hard enough for the blinds on the door to stir from the force and stay moving for a good minute. I stared at the door trying to figure out what happened. I looked at the lock and saw that it was still deadbolted. Both cats came over to investigate. One of them had their tail puffed up. I couldn't figure it out and had enough so I ran to my bedroom and sat there sipping coffee. The two cats followed closely. 

I was sitting on the bed trying to explain away what happened when I could hear the door yank again with a slightly lesser force. I continued to sit in the room out of fear. I began looking up stories of negative air pressure opening doors and how that works in an effort to find an explanation. But nothing accounts for the door handle squeaking from turning at the same time.

I then heard the door yank again. This time my frustration overcame my fear and I bolted out of the room. I found my friend/roommate(m28) standing in the living room. He looked startled from me popping up like I did but immediately said ""the balcony door was open."" It was freezing in the living room now from the chilly night and the door being wide open. He understandably must have been a little frustrated. I mentioned that the door was locked and told him about what just happened. I'm not entirely sure if he believes me but didn't object because the door opening has been a problem for a while.

I am a skeptic. Always have been. I'm always able to explain things away. But this one has me stumped. I guess I'm looking more explanations with this post and if that involves the paranormal, so be it. What I just witnessed is the weirdest thing I've seen outside of movies.

My current routine :
-Wake up 
-Drink two glasses of water 
-8 ounce of pre-workout 
-8 to 10 ounces of coffee 

20 to 30 minutes of calisthenics on the Betterme app 

Breakfast 
Usually consists of a slice of bacon, slice of toast, banana, and recently I added an 8 ounce serving of whey protein .

I will then go for at least a 2 mile walk and after that, I will try and jog. Recently I’ve been able to do .7 miles before my breathing becomes unsteady. 

Throughout the rest of the day, I don’t pay much more attention to my meals, other than calories and amount of sodium I’m taking in. Because I don’t want to limit myself just yet on what I’m eating. And I will do an additional 2-7 miles on my walking pad at my standing desk.

My original goals of my workout were just to make sure that my body could do whatever I needed it to without it straining. It was a very humbling moment when I will try to reach behind me and nearly pulled my back. Typically this lead to about two weeks of working out and then stopping and coming back to it 2 to 3 months later. 

The results of these last 39 days are 23 pounds lost and it is an amazing feeling to have done so. 

And while I do believe in everything that I’ve been doing, and I can actually see that it’s working. I am hoping there are those who will reassure me that I am doing everything. I am in an optimal order. Or if they can correct me and tell me if I should be eating before I work out or after my run.

1g4wugb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1g4wugb/stray_cat_obsessed_with_me/,Stray cat obsessed with me? ,"
This was such a fringe, strange experience I had to write about it and ask!!

Some backstory: I have never owned a cat in my life, generally do not know how to interact with them (though I love animals, and love being around them) but recently, on holiday, this stray cat was just obsessed with me. 

We were staying in a large resort with plenty of people around. I was with a group of three other girls, and this happened in Greece this summer. This cat was apparently a common stray around the area, and the hotel staff knew her by name and fed her occasionally — but she was notoriously shy, as told to us by them, and would accept food but would dart away right after, generally keeping to herself and preferring to observe guests and lounge around. 

Now, on our very first day at the hotel, we had just finished checking in and were being given a tour by a member of staff of the grounds — we spot this cat, and the staff member is just telling us how she is scared of humans and doesn’t like to be around them too much when she DARTS up to me, and immediately begins purring, rubbing herself on my ankles, and pawing at my knees. We’re all laughing, but even the staff member looks surprised— going so far as to tell me that he had worked there and had been feeding her for a year now and she still kept her distance from him! 

Fast forward to the next few days — Our room had a ground floor balcony that led out directly to the shared hotel pool deck — for context, we would lounge for hours on the sunbeds. I wake up the very first morning and go for a coffee on the balcony, and lo and behold, I’m greeted by the cat! The minute I sit down, she immediately hops up into my lap and begins purring— she’s very affectionate, and super comfortable with me. This continues throughout our stay. Everytime I’m near the pool or outside, she finds her way to me and just plops herself on my lap— she avoided being pet by my fellow holidayers and friends, and when the staff neared (normally to proclaim their shock) she would duck away momentarily and wait until they had distanced before coming right back. As someone who has never had ANY experience with cats, it was surreal (and a very good feeling!) strangely, I never even fed her anything! She was coming back just to hangout and chill with me! It was kind of insane— lol I began to worry about my health actually, because I’ve heard animals can be overly affectionate or all over you when they sense illness/tumours/ that you’re unwell etc. I began to think the only cause for this is was I must be sick 😭 She was by no means a young cat— according the staff, she had been around for about 6 years give or take. 

Sorry for the long winded post, but I was just wondering what could cause a cat to act like this? Should I book a doctors appointment lmfao? Or was this just a case of random luck? I’ve never had a cat be so affectionate with me without any familiarity so quickly, especially one that is KNOWN for being standoffish (and indeed, WAS standoffish, to the rest of my group, to the others staying at the hotel, staff) 

Any insight from those experienced with cats/cat behaviour would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you in advance :) ",1,1729077183.0,CatAdvice,0,0.99,False

A lot of the texts are about how one can come to understand God. 

Today I had a massive epiphany as to why SR makes one closer to God generally and thought I’d share it. 

According to these texts, all is within God and God is within all. And he has no need for anything as there is nothing that is outside of him. 

This last bit gave me a key understanding as to the nature of God and the understanding as to why SR makes us feel closer to God. It seems (and likely this is only just part of it), that our desires are keeping us apart from God specifically because God has no desires and needs nothing, hence to understand him we must be the same. And so to truly be one with, and to understand God we must be without desire, as he is. SR helps you eliminate one of the largest desires a man can have and hence is the biggest step to a better understanding.

the owner is very hospitable and made sure everyone is attended to despite the constant flow of people streaming into his cafe. he gave out his post cards, stickers and tried to make conversation with all customers.
we had to wait approximately 1 hour from the minute we sat down to being served his coffee

by the time this barrel arrival at our table, he had ran out of the ""golden spoon"" and i was served this extract of coffee on a ""regular"" spoon... (somehow disappointed)

its coffee but it does not taste exactly like coffee, its sweet and syrupy, to me it taste somehow like wine! 

my wife and son had affogato which was the special thick shot of coffee with very creamy milk (instead of ice cream), they absolutely love it

we had a picture taken with him and he gave a menu together with his name card and more post cards (of himself). oh i forgot to mention, you get to take the piece of napkin he used to wipe clean the tap of the barrel as a souvenir 🤣

the experience was a very pleasant one and i would do it again... 

for those coffee lover, if you were to ever visit Osaka, this is a must!

It not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of a space but also contributes to our overall well-being by boosting mood and energy levels. With the right techniques and design choices, you can maximize the amount of natural light in your home. Here are expert tips gathered by our[ interior designers in Kottayam](https://dlifeinteriors.com/location/kottayam/) Natural light can transform a home from dull and dreary to bright and inviting. It not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of a space but also contributes to our overall well-being by boosting mood and energy levels. With the right techniques and design choices, you can maximize the amount of natural light in your home. Here are expert tips gathered by our interior designers in Kottayam to help you make the most of sunlight in your living spaces.

# 1. Choose the Right Colors

The color scheme of your home plays a significant role in how light is perceived. Lighter colors, especially whites, creams, and soft pastels, reflect light and can make a room feel larger and airier. Consider painting walls, ceilings, and even floors in lighter shades.

For those looking to add a touch of color, opt for light hues like pale blues, soft yellows, or gentle greens. Additionally, choosing glossy finishes for your paint can increase reflectivity, further amplifying the light in the room.

# 2. Maximize Window Space

Windows are the primary source of natural light in any home. To harness this light effectively, consider enlarging existing windows or adding new ones where possible.

**Window Treatments**

If your windows are adorned with heavy curtains, consider replacing them with sheer fabrics that allow light to filter in while still providing privacy. Blinds can also be adjusted to let in more light when desired. Roman shades and roller shades in light colors can maintain aesthetics while enhancing brightness.

# Window Placement

When designing or renovating your home, pay attention to window placement. South-facing windows receive the most sunlight throughout the day, so consider larger windows or additional openings on these sides of your home. Skylights and clerestory windows are also excellent options for bringing in light from above, especially in rooms with limited wall space.

# 3. Incorporate Mirrors

Mirrors are a brilliant way to enhance the natural light in a space. By strategically placing mirrors across from windows or in darker corners, you can reflect sunlight deeper into the room.

Consider the following tips for using mirrors effectively:

* **Choose Large Mirrors:** A large mirror can significantly amplify light. Consider placing a floor mirror in a sunlit area or a wall mirror that reflects a window.
* **Create a Gallery:** A collection of smaller mirrors can also add charm while maximizing light. Arrange them in a cluster to create a stunning focal point.
* **Use Decorative Mirrors:** Mirrors come in various shapes and styles, so choose decorative options that enhance your décor while serving the purpose of light reflection.

# 4. Open Up the Floor Plan

An open floor plan can greatly enhance the flow of natural light throughout your home. By minimizing walls and barriers between rooms, light can travel more freely.

# Knock Down Non-Load-Bearing Walls

If feasible, consider knocking down non-load-bearing walls between adjacent rooms. This can create a more spacious and connected feel, allowing light to permeate every area.

# Use Open Shelving

Instead of bulky cabinets or bookshelves that block light, opt for open shelving. This allows light to pass through and makes spaces feel less cluttered. Choose light-colored shelves to further enhance brightness.

# 5. Opt for Glass and Transparent Elements

Incorporating glass into your home design can significantly enhance natural light. Here are a few ways to do this:

* **Glass Doors:** Replace solid doors with glass ones to allow light to flow from one room to another. This works particularly well for areas like dining rooms or home offices.
* **Translucent Partitions:** If you need to separate spaces without blocking light, consider using translucent screens or partitions.
* **Glass Railings:** For multi-level homes, glass railings can maintain an open and airy feel while allowing light to travel vertically.

# 6. Landscaping Considerations

Your home’s exterior can also impact how much natural light enters. Proper landscaping can either enhance or obstruct light.

# Trim Overgrown Trees and Shrubs

Ensure that trees and shrubs around your home don’t block sunlight from entering your windows. Regular trimming can keep plants in check and allow more light to flood your interior.

# Choose Strategic Planting

When planting new trees or shrubs, be mindful of where they are positioned. Opt for low-growing plants near windows to maximize light exposure. Additionally, consider planting deciduous trees that provide shade in summer but allow sunlight to filter through in winter when they lose their leaves.

# 7. Use Light-Reflecting Decor

Incorporate decor that enhances the brightness of your space. Here are a few ideas:

* **Metallic Accents:** Items made from metals such as brass, gold, or chrome can reflect light beautifully. Consider using metallic picture frames, lamp bases, or decorative objects.
* **Glossy Finishes:** Choose furniture with glossy finishes, such as lacquered coffee tables or shiny ceramic vases, which can reflect light and enhance brightness.
* **Textiles:** Use light-colored and lightweight fabrics for cushions, throws, and rugs. Opt for materials that reflect light, such as silk or satin.

# 8. Consider Artificial Light Sources

While maximizing natural light is ideal, it’s also essential to supplement with artificial lighting when necessary. Here are some tips for creating a well-lit environment:

* **Layered Lighting:** Use a combination of ambient, task, and accent lighting to brighten your home effectively. Ceiling fixtures, floor lamps, and wall sconces can work together to provide illumination throughout the day.
* **Dimmers:** Install dimmer switches to control the intensity of your lights. This allows you to adapt the lighting to the time of day and your mood, complementing natural light effectively.



Maximizing natural light in your home not only enhances its aesthetic appeal but also promotes a healthier and happier living environment. By employing these expert tips and with guidance from a professional team of [interior designers in Kerala](https://dlifeinteriors.com/kerala/), you can transform your space into a sunlit sanctuary. From choosing the right colors to strategic window placement, every decision contributes to the overall brightness of your home. Embrace the sunshine and let it invigorate your living spaces, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that you and your family will enjoy for years to come.

1g4wnka,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g4wnka/aitah_is_she_a_narcissist_or_am_i/,AITAH Is she a narcissist or am I?,"Basically I (30F) had this friend (30F). We went to school together but only really became close after we finished. Fast forward many years and we've maintained the friendship. I've been with her through every trial life had thrown her way (abusive mother, bad breakups, friendship breakdowns, mental health issues). I've even been there for her when she needed support with her children such as organizing my husband's work roster to be home with our child so I can look after hers for the night while she gave birth to her second. She has a very low opinion of herself and basically hates herself as she has told me many times. In our teens/early 20s she would get her confidence by going from guy to guy at the clubs and having one nighters. That wasn't my scene so I never got involved but never judged either because I understood why she did it. Me on the other hand have only had two partners and I'm happily married to the second one. When I found my now husband, she got extremely drunk one night and tells me ""I don't like him. He's too young for you (he's four years younger than me) and he can't provide for you (I didn't need and still don't need providing for). She couldn't stand that I stayed with him and made things extremely awkward so I ended the friendship. Fast forward two years, she comments on a memory on FB that I was tagged in and we decided to meet for coffee and chat. That restarted the friendship (stupid me, I know now) because I really thought she had chilled out within herself and her opinions of others. Well we ended up pregnant around the same time and she had her baby a month before me. All is well (ish) for the first 4 years and the kids have grown up together and formed a close friendship. During this time her mask has slowly slipped and I've once again seen her for who she truly is and I decided to slowly distance myself. She would constantly bad mouth her partner, calling him a cunt and useless (he has his own issues but his efforts were never good enough for her), she even showed me a picture of his dick one day to prove that he's a ""grower, not a shower"". She's stated that if she could afford it she would leave him but she wouldn't be able to finance a house on her own with now two kids. Shes done a whole other bunch of things which she's proudly declared like withhold sex from him unless he was willing to get her pregnant again. She told him when she was pregnant with her first child that if he didn't propose to her before the birth then the child was taking her last name instead of his (he never proposed and they ended up hyphenating their last names together). Just weird controlling shit like that. Besides all of that, she constantly speaks poorly about her friends including me which I found out about and wasn't too surprised. Our kids go to preschool together so it's not like it affects them, they can still be friends. I've got no problems with that. 
Everything I've mentioned is less than half of what I could say this person has done to those in her life. Both our kids attend a weekly playgroup event for two hours at their new school for next year. One of the mothers told me that one week when I couldn't make it that this person was trying to plant seeds in the heads of the other parents about me, that was the final straw for me. Anyway, like I said, I've slowly been distancing myself. Accepting fewer invitations to things, not really divulging any information about my life to her, just giving her the bare minimum. I chose this course of action rather than speaking with her about it because I knew if I even hinted that she had done/said things that were upsetting/worrying/offensive then it would be gloves off and she'd attack me and paint herself as a victim. So I was hoping I could quietly just slip away from the friendship and let it die. Well wasn't that my biggest mistake? When she realized what I was doing she dug her heels in even further and started sending me messages of support such as ""I'm here if you need to talk."". She's never once done that before in the history of our friendship even when she knew I was low at times. It wasn't until she realized she was losing control that she decided to send messages of ""support"". I was nice in my responses ""Thanks a lot. I'll let you know"" or heart reacting and left it at that. 
Fast forward a bit further and it's orientation day for our kids who are starting the same school next year (yay). At this point I haven't seen her in approx 2 months and we've barely spoken on messenger so I thought ""Great, the friendship is running it's course"". Nope. She approached me quite aggressively at the orientation, didn't even start with a ""Hey"" or ""Hello"". She just walks up to me in a huff and says 'Whats going on with you? You've been quiet"". I said that I was just going through some trials at the moment but I'd be ok and I told her it wasn't anything personal (because if I did then I knew she'd get on the defensive and the outcome is never good when I've done that in the past). I thanked her for checking on me and left it at that. I was there for my child and wanted to focus on that. We ended the brief conversation on a good note or so I thought. A week after that interaction out of nowhere, she unfriends me on FB, leaves every single group chat that we were both apart of on messenger and gets a friend of hers to message me to tell me how horrible I am before blocking me. It was completely random and it felt like she was chucking a massive adult tantrum. I let it go and didn't respond in any way as I knew she was looking for a reaction via a message directly or me reaching out to a mutual friend to ask what was wrong. I completely left it because it wasn't worth my energy. 
Well a new term started this week and today was the first playschool back and holy shit it was the most awkward and uncomfortable interaction. We didn't acknowledge each other at all and when it came time for the kids to have morning tea, because our two kids are friends they sat next to each other. I naturally sat behind my child and she came over to sit near hers except in her big power move, instead of sitting facing the center of the circle, she plonked herself down and turned her back to me and cutting off her child from my own. Luckily her child was more mature than her and actually got up, moved around her and rejoined myself and my child while she maintained her position with her back to me, excluding me from the conversation being had with the other parents. I happily spoke to my child and hers like nothing was happening because I wanted to shield them from the bullshit. 
I just want to know, from that information alone (there's so much more of what she's done/said but this would turn into a thesis very quickly if I listed everything), am I the asshole for wanting to end the friendship and should I feel at all guilty for trying to slowly slip away which triggered her huge reaction in the end? Id also really appreciate advice because I find this whole situation so mentally debilitating. She's very good at manipulating people (like me) so I know she will be getting into the heads of the other parents at my child's school whenever she can.

It’s basically like hugging your soul. Here’s why investing in an espresso machine is a total *game-changer* when the cold hits:

# 1. Endless Hot Drinks at Your Fingertips

When it’s freezing outside, all you crave is warmth. With an espresso machine, you’ve got your personal café right in your kitchen. Think espresso, lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos—*whenever* you want. Skip the trek to the coffee shop in a snowstorm, save the cash, and enjoy that perfect hot drink in your PJs. 

# 2. Coziness On Demand

Winter is all about creating cozy vibes. Nothing sets the mood like the rich aroma of freshly ground coffee filling your home. Add a fluffy blanket and your favorite Netflix show, and you’ve just created the ultimate winter setup. The espresso machine isn’t just for coffee—it’s for *ambience*. 

# 3. Perfect for Hosting Winter Gatherings

Got friends coming over? Impress them with your newfound barista skills. Make custom drinks to fit their taste—flat white for that friend who’s super picky, or a luxurious mocha for the sweet tooth. Trust me, no one’s turning down a handcrafted hot coffee when it’s 20°F outside! 

# 4. Save Money While Staying Warm

The average coffee run costs what—$4, $5, maybe more for a fancy drink? Multiply that by the 10 times you’ll need it during a cold week, and it adds up FAST. Your espresso machine pays for itself in no time. Plus, you can experiment with different coffee beans and syrups, crafting your ultimate winter beverage without breaking the bank. 

# 5. Ultimate Comfort on the Dark, Cold Mornings

Let’s face it: winter mornings are rough. It’s dark, cold, and the bed feels way too good to leave. Having an espresso machine means a comforting, *delicious* reason to get up. A smooth shot of espresso (or two) gives you that much-needed energy boost to kickstart your day—and survive the winter blues. 

# 6. Level Up Your Winter Aesthetic

It’s not just about the drinks; it’s the whole experience. An espresso machine adds a sleek, café-style aesthetic to your kitchen. Pair it with some cute mugs, maybe a coffee bar setup, and boom—you’ve got a Pinterest-worthy winter vibe going on. 

So whether you’re a coffee addict or just looking for ways to stay cozy and caffeinated this winter, an espresso machine is the perfect addition to your home. Plus, no one ever regretted being able to make café-quality drinks on a cold winter's day.

When it comes to designing a functional butler's pantry, creativity is key.

1. In her demon form, Belphegor is actually the tallest Sin with her often having to change her form to be smaller so that she doesn't have to look down on everyone, especially Lucifer (basically, they could replicate the end of King Kong with their sizes)

2. She acts as a financial advisor to many of the sins, also often handling legal disputes due to her expertise and her precognitive abilities (which basically act the same as the Future Sight abilities of Garnet from Steven Universe, using probability to determine the future), with this actually leading to her being a VERY fast reader of contracts and such due to being able to use her precognitive abilities with all futures having the same version of contracts since they were already written. However, due to her duties, she can't always be there to do so, leading to people like Asmodeus getting the help of Stolas.

3. Mortimer's sister is in Heaven, with her having taken a similar path as Mortimer by becoming a doctor, despite how young her winner form was due to her inability to age in Heaven, with her form resembling a Caladrius, a mythical bird known for taking sickness from the sick. She's also there alongside her and Mortimer's mother, with the two having a good relationship.

4. Belphegor can venture into the human realm and, previously, whenever she went on a vacation, she always took a trip to Columbia while assuming a human disguise, with her really liking the coffee there (with her also thinking coffee is one of humanity's best discoveries) with her always making sure to bring back some to Mortimer alongside a bit of cocaine for him. 

5. Often times, Belphegor has traveled to the human realm on business in order to use her precognitive abilities and intellect to grant inspiration and ideas to some of history's greatest minds in exchange for their souls, as she still isn't running some charity case, with these individuals going to hell and the Sloth Ring to repay their debts to Belphegor after their deaths... Although, these souls would later be transfered into the Pride Ring following the first extermination, which devastated much of hell and led to Lucifer and Lilith making the decision to have all sinners reside in the Pride Ring and weren't allowed to leave it after making a deal with heaven in order to minimize destruction to the other rings and Hellborn caught in the crossfire. 

6. Mortimer, at one point, managed to find his dad in hell, then showing him how successful he's become, to try and receive closure for his dad abandoning him and his sister due to him believing them not to be survivors, with Mortimer then killing him... However, killing and showing off to his dad wouldn't really fix anything...

7. Laz (the lab made son of Mortimer and Belphegor) is able to visit the Living Realm, with him actually growing up and deciding to spend some years in the living realm to more discover himself, ultimately leading to him becoming an infomercial salesperson like Phil Swift. If there's one thing he learned from his dad, it's how to sell a product.",2,1729075837.0,HazbinHotelOCArt,0,1.0,False

","Hey everyone,

I’m in a challenging situation with my boyfriend of five years, and I could really use some perspective. Recently, we’ve been facing a tough time due to issues related to infertility, which has led to increased tension and arguments between us.

A little background: earlier this year, we travel to his home country, and I found out he met up with his ex-girlfriend for coffee, despite telling him prior my discomfort with it. At the time, I was also feeling lost in the relationship and needed a break to think if I wanted to continue or not. He told me this when we were in a car to visit his friends, he begged me to join him and not let him go alone to his friend’s house, which I reluctantly agreed to, but I cried throughout the journey. However, next day, we returned to our normal lives without fully addressing our issues. Once we return home we decided to reset, create better habits and work on us, he was unemployed at the time and I try to help him, not 100% financially but close, and also looking at jobs for him, etc... and for 6 months we were better than before, he stopped drinking had more energy, i stop complaining so much, tried to read more about how to control better my emotions and things seem very good! Also, important to say, he is in a foreign country, I helped him a lot with settling in because we met when he arrived here. However, summer return, he got a job, and what was going out for drinks 2x a week, transformed into going out for drinks every day, more fights and more complaints + infertility I was also on a lot of medication which did not help.

We’ve had several fights over the years, he drinks a lot, and i complain a lot, I had this trait that I'm working on it but sometimes i try to have a conversation and the person doesn't want to have the talk or goes to other room not to listen, and i get furious. He often struggles with communication, especially with his ADHD, and I feel like I’ve been the one doing most of the emotional heavy lifting and feel a lot of our fights happen, and then they go under the mat and then dont get resolved.

We had a major fight last week... small things piled up, I was in a lot of stress and I said things that I did not want it and push the argument, he stood up and said that he was done, and he wanted to break up, i completely shut down and start crying and said that that is not what i wanted, he said that he stopped feeling attracted by me because of my weight gain when he met me I was skinny, he didnt saw this going anywhere, he feels i only seem him as a good father and thats it.

In part is true I stop carrying about how i look in the last year, it was a lot of things going on, like infertility, my job got to intense, him being unemployed, etc... I was in a lot of stress in the past year that contributed to this and in part it was good that he told me because I feel that is something that requires some work.

Next day, he asked for a break to reflect on whether he wants to continue the relationship. He will stay with a friend. We agreed to be in a relationship but be distant. Yesterday, we had a brief encounter at home where we spoke casually about mundane things, and he thanked me for washing his clothes. I asked if he wanted to go see a soccer game on Sunday, he mentioned going to his friend’s farm for the weekend and hasn’t confirmed if he’ll be able to be in town on time, which makes me anxious. I gave me a small cuddle in the arm, and he said, "" I need to go..."" and left.

I’m trying to respect his space, but the emotional distance is concerning. I’m left wondering if he’s leaning toward a breakup or if he genuinely just needs some time to decompress i also feel that i was there for him on all his less good moments like unemployment and changing countries, and because im having a difficult time with fertility and a bit more emotional lately, he wants to break up, once we were doing the reset things were better, the fertility treatments and the drinking came to ruin things. I’ve thought about reaching out for a heart-to-heart conversation when he’s ready, but I’m unsure how to approach it without pushing him further away.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you navigate the uncertainty and emotional distance? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",1,1729075740.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

His company recently spent three plus months re-doing their offices. I've visited there after they were done, so I can vouch for the shittyness. Some key features; a) ""focus zone"" right next to the passageway that everyone needs to go through if they're going to the coffee machine or the elevator if they have a meeting on another floor, b) said ""focus zone has desk separators that are not attached to anything, and only about 30-35cm tall, c) printer room is no longer a proper room, they took away the door, d) ""co-working space"" with a long table and non-padded chairs where there used to be about 8 or 9 cubicles for high concentration work.

There's like three-ish different teams on this floor, and one of them spends a lot of time with outgoing calls and meetings. He OTOH is a pretty calm, somewhat introvert maths wiz working on calculating long-term interest rates, internal margins, and stuff like that, and spends most of his time buried in deep work with very few meetings. 

After the renovation, he's spent more time WFH since there's no good seats left for concentrating. Boss recently demanded 4 days pr week in the office. He complained. Boss responded by setting up a ""dialogue meeting"" with a HR rep, who, and I kid you not, dropped some absolute banger when saying that ""the definition of quiet is not very clear"" and ""maybe you just need to talk to someone about concentrating better"".

1g4we7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1g4we7r/anyone_tried_keto_fastingintermittent_fasting/,Anyone tried Keto & Fasting/Intermittent Fasting?,"**Asking for a friend who has been diagnosed with CFS.**

**I don't have CFS** but I had insulin resistance and obesity, I have been on Keto and 16:8 fasting for just over a year now and it has completely transformed my life I am no longer obese, and my energy levels are high all day.

I know it is not the same condition but at the root of it I believe **damaged mitochondria** is the similarity between most conditions.

**Your mitochondria are the power sources of your cells**, what converts food into useable energy for your body. If you had a virus or extreme stress in your life that happened at the start of your CFS it is this damaged mitochondria so they can't provide you with proper energy resulting in your fatigue.

Normally when you eat a regular diet, you are running off sugar/glucose, all carbohydrates convert into glucose. So if your mitochondria is not able to process this into energy this is the problem.

So with Keto and Fasting, this cuts out most of your carbs/sugar so much that your body then switches to ketosis to run off fat. Either dietary fat from what you eat, or body fat. Any fat you eat won't get stored because your insulin will be low due to no carbs/sugar spiking it and insulin is required to store fat.

**So here is why I think it may help and I would be interested to see if anyone else has tried this and how it went.**

* When you restrict carbs under 50g a day, and eat healthy fats - extra virgin olive oil, ghee, avocado oil, avocados, walnuts, salmon, grass fed beef mince/steak, cheese etc you go into a metabolic state called ketosis.
* Ketosis makes your body run off ketones produced from dietary or body fat
* Ketones are signalling molecules they **signal mitochondria to undergo mitophagy** which removes mitochondria that are not providing proper energy
* They also signal **mitochondrial biogeneis** which is creating new mitochondria that are more efficient providing you with more energy.

The process of turning over your mitochondria takes around 3 months so you will need to strictly stay on the diet for that amount of time to start seeing major benefits.

Intermittent fasting and extended fasting without keto, does the same thing, but with Keto diet you are in ketosis all day and night. Intermittent fasting is an eating window for example 8 hours eating, 16 hours not eating. Extended fasting is 24-72hrs of not consuming anything but water or black coffee. The benefits of this aswell is your gut is not diverting your energy to processing food so the repairing of your body can be fuelled better.

I combine 16:8 intermittent fasting with keto, so only eat in an 8hr window.

If anyone wants to try it you just need to eat the following:

* Any meat/fish cooked from raw, season yourself with single ingredient powders, avoid seasoning mixes that have dextrose/maltodextrin/sugar. Higher fat will give you more energy, but make sure you are following the diet strictly under 50g carbs a day. Carbs + fats will cause you to store fat and is not healthy.
* Low carb vegetables you can google them but I mainly eat avocado, broccoli, pepper, onion, mushroom, asparagus, lettuce, bok choy, tomatoes
* Full fat dairy - all cheese, avoid processed burger cheese and shredded cheese. Get it in a block and grate yourself so it does not have extra ingredients. All creams, milk. greek yogurt. Avoid low fat yogurt and flavoured yogurt, these have emulsifiers and sugar that are not good for your gut cascading to inflammation problems.
* Eggs are a staple, natures multivitamin and an extremely bioavailable form of protein
* Fruits - avoid all fruit apart from blackberries and raspberries, put in greek yogurt
* Nuts - Walnuts, pecans or macadamia nuts. Walnuts are your best bet, high in anti-inflammatory Omega 3.

If you eat this way it is important to avoid all things that will cause inflammation so the fat you are eating will not get damaged. Normally having high blood sugar is what damages the fat, causing it to then get stored instead of used, which is why you must not eat carbs and fats together.

* Avoid all refined carbs and sugars. Your 50g allowance will be filled with the low carbs in veg and dairy. This means, no bread, rice, cereal, pasta, potato, buns, tortillas, bakery items, all sugar, soda, candy that has sugar, fruit juice, smoothies.
* Avoid all ultra processed food - things that have ingredients you don't find in kitchen
* Avoid seed oils - High in Omega 6, pro inflammatory - canola oil, sunflower oil, vegetable oil, palm oil, soybean oil. This is in 80% of the food in store.

It was me and four other guys and the rest of the group was twelve girls. On the trip I got very close with everyone in this group. I especially got interested in this one girl. I hadn’t really talked to her except a little before the trip. Over the course of the trip I found myself getting more and more infatuated with her. But this infatuation felt very different than crushes I had in high school. It wasn’t anything lustful, it was more about her personality and some of her flaws I found most attractive. She was easy to make laugh, which was surprising to me because I’ve never seen myself as a witty/funny guy. During the trip I’d always try my best to sit near her in lectures, buses, etc. Not next to her but maybe within eye sight. I mentioned to one of the guys I knew before the trip I might ask her to coffee after this trip is done with. He said that’d be a great idea and that I should shoot my shot. 

The last night of the trip while a group of us including her were having dinner, she mentioned her boyfriend. It came up in casual conversation and my friend sitting across from me could see my shock. This has led me down a very confusing rabbit hole. 

One on hand it’s motivated me to work on myself physically, academically, hobbies/interests. But on the other hand I just wanna go to her and tell her I’m interested, regardless of the answer. Because at least then I’d have some closure. I’ve asked multiple people what to do. I’ve had some friends who say move on. I’ve had one who said if you really like her keep pursuing her (respectfully of course). He made the point that boyfriends come and go and she might just need to know I’m interested in her. 

It’s been a two days since I got back from this trip and I can’t get her out of my head. I value her company a lot but I’m not sure I could keep her as only a friend. She encouraged me to join a club she’s in so I figured I might do that to try and build a friendship. But right now my course of action is to give it a couple months of friendship and if I’m still uncomfortable I’ll just shoot my shot and go for it. Really I’m writing in this subreddit because I want to know, 1. Is this just a crush that will blow over in a month or is it something more. And 2. What should I do and has anyone been in a similar situation. Sorry for the long paragraph I’ve been a big mess. ",0,1729075290.0,Crushes,6,0.5,False

We ordered food immediately (She did). adi edo cranberry cold brew ani cold coffee edo chepindi... Vinagane thipindi I was so confused by the name itself that coffee lo fruit ela ani dani meda oka 5 mins matlade lopu it arrived and it turned out actually good (Meru kuda velte try cheyandi) and rest of the order arrived too.

I started devouring it and I completely forgot why I was here lol, Oka 2 mins tarwata gurthochi ala paiki chuste she was blankly starring at me... I was like ""Hehe.. sorry akalesi marchipoya"" and she laughed it out (I think she genuinely found it funny but she might be trying to be nice too). So inka kunchem slow avi I started asking about her (But I already knew her so it was very hard), asked her about her internship (? ade doctors oka 1 year something edo chestaru ga), about her dog, about her brother and all. She was so excited to talk about her internship and her dog, I don't know... she looked cute like that. ala kasepu aiyaka she realised only she was talking and asked me about my masters plans and all but I didn't have much to say.

She then changed the topic to movies and Devara (She knows I love movies and NTR) and I started yapping lmao. ala kasepu aiyaka we we were talking about this movie and realised our names match with the leads of that movie (Sorry, can't disclose and dox myself) we started joking about us being those character like ""enduku ra ila chesav?"" and me giving the most ridiculous reason possible and that cringe went on for an embarrassingly long time than I would have liked it to but we laughing so loud that we got waiters sent over to ask us to keep it low lol. Then I got a call from the guy whose car I lepified(I thought my other friends made him call me to check if I am still with her or not), Call chesi arey mama NKR ne retain cheyadam kana RTM better ra antu start chesadu (Aa mundu roju Ind vs ban match aindi) nenu bayata una ra ani cut chesa (Memu ante samayam sandarbam lekunda ila cricket gurinchi matladutam). She's an RCB fan anta, she started saying if NKR comes to auction RCB will go all out for him (which is true) and I was like meru NKR ni tesukuna vadi career ni nasinam cheyadam thapa pekedi emi ledu ani and thus started the RCB vs SRH stats war with google as the technical support (and the waiter as the moral support /s) ala oka 20 mins debate tarwata she gave up. I didn't realise I was actually having a lot of fun till this point and a had big uncontolable smile across my face. She looked very happy to be there too.

7:05 pm

Then we asked for check and we came out... I wanted to spend some more time but I couldn't dare to ask. Ala car lo ki velaka she asked ""So what now?"" and I was like ""Your call madam, what ever you say"".(We had this whole itinerary planned by our friends for the whole evening but we decided to scrap it before hand and go with the flow, So we didn't have a plan then) She suggested why don't we go for bowling (I love bowling and she surely knew that) and I was like say no more! I know the perfect place!

1g4w832,https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1g4w832/so_weirdly_but_not_surprisingly_enough_the_pens/,"So weirdly but not surprisingly enough, the  pens everyone reccomended are now the things I love the most in my collection. So much so that I wanna get another version of them.","Im torn between getting the 823 F and the Lamy 2k EF. So, I love these pens, I bought the Lamy 2k F 28 days ago and the 823 like a week or 2 before the 2k and I haven't even finished them yet. I \*never\* bring my 823 to school since the M is just too big for cheap test papers and the like, BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE how it writes. The weight and the grip are just perfect. As for the Lamy 2k F... That shit is the GOAT, I dont even use a pen sleeve lol (when i do the piston turn thing turns as well), but it's such a tank. 

I use the Lamy F on all my paper, especially during classes, and I have been loving the shin-kai, which I disliked at first. I might get the sailor pigment inks just for this pen. I love these pens so much, I haven't checked this sub since then! I got back to some of my hobbies, like coffee making and video games. These pens have helped me with these as well. I love how it writes and the smooth spot isnt a thing as the way I write fits it.

I honestly havent used the 823 in weeks, because of the 2k, but thats mostly because of the smaller nib, and the sturdier and less ""fragile"" feeling pen. The 2k feels sturdier than my VP despite being a softer material. I know it sounds like the Lamy 2k is a better choice but, I love the 823 so much I  cant explain why, while the 2k is something I've used more due to practical reasons. But don't get me wrong, i probably love the 823 a little more than the 2k in terms of writing. 

  
Here are some pros and cons I've noticed

**823:** 

-I got the amber one so the left over ink can't be seen. But I'm getting the demonstrator version, though that's honestly not a problem, since I'll probably just keep using the same ink.

-scratches scratches and oil. The thing is more prone to scratches than  the 2k, and bringing it to uni isn't really a big deal since I'm looking for a pen I can write with. However, I do have to wipe it a few times, since my pen keepsevery handoil i secrete

-the plastic feels more fragile 

  
Pros: 

-Writes more comfy than the 2k

-The size/weight and other proportions are perfect for my hands, It's like this pen was made for me.

-Aesthetically better for me

  
**2k Pros:**

-i can probably step on this thing and it wouldn't get a scratch, and probably break my shoe too

-quicker to cap and uncap, though that isn't a problem with 1-2hr writing sessions

-smaller and sleeker = less attention from 

I- lent this pen and i wasn't scared at all ( grave sin i know), probably wouldn't even have shown the 823 if I knew someone needed a pen.

  
overall, the 2k is more sturdy, and built for abuse than the 823, however the 823 is more comfy honestly. 

  
P.S: I made a no buy rule until next year, as I want to focus on other hobbies, but you never know. I might accidentally order either pen on december lol. Im getting both pens months apart, though that depends on other factors tbh( no it wont break the bank, I wouldn't be buying any pen for that matter if it did)",7,1729074798.0,fountainpens,4,1.0,False

   • Love cats, they’re so cute. I wish to adopt and take care of a pair one day. I heard cats are very social animals and taking care of 2 is less demanding than 1.

   • For activities, I like working out and walks along the seawall.

   • Recently, as a side hobby I’ve been learning how to program video games. A fun challenge for myself to see if I can do it.

I snapped out of it 3 days later and changed my coffee place. And horrible cheating ocd came out of it.

But still, I did act on my crush - I went out of my way to talk to him and dressed cute. That I know was wrong and I won't do it again.
