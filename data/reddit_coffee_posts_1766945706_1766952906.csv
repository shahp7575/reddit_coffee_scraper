1py155n,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1py155n/a_dreamless_sleep/,A Dreamless Sleep,"I woke up in a cold sweat, my skin chilled and my mind foggy. What woke me up? I don't remember dreaming or... or even waking up but here I am, awake but not sure why. It feels as though I was never asleep at all, but yet I know I was. 

The feeling of unease clinging to the back of my thoughts, the feeling of a hidden danger lurking just out of sight. The pitch black darkness seemed to move and swirl, surely just an illusion. Looking over to see my wife sleeping so soundly beside me comforted my nerves slightly but didn't resolve the inky fear of what dwelled just outside my range of vision. ""It was probably just a bad dream, nothing to get worked up over."" I said under my breath.

Looking over at my bedside clock, ""3:08am, shit... way to go with the cliché"" I thought, glancing back into the darkness that somehow felt alive in an unexplainable way, I got up and headed downstairs to the kitchen for a drink, God.. what is it that is just so off? Trying to put my finger on exactly what it was drove me insane. 

I felt like I was being called to something, like a subconscious pull but I had no idea towards what. As if I no longer felt comfortable or even belonged in my own home anymore. In fact I couldnt even identify what I was feeling anymore, Anger? Fear? Sadness? No word could label it correctly and noticing this fact added to the feeling of impending insanity.

My mind clearing up and my drowsiness completely gone I no longer felt tired but I still had that lingering dread of something just not right.
Rubbing my eyes, I resolve myself to the fact I will not be going back to sleep tonight, grabbing a cup of coffee and deciding to go for a walk. Stepping outside the air was chilled, bordering cold, but I pushed on starting on my journey to nowhere in particular. 

It was relaxing walking under the stars and after about an hour as the night sky gave way to morning I decided to head back home. 
I start for a light jog, feeling lighter and more energetic than I ever have before. 
Walking up the driveway and walking inside, I'm greeted with... the sound of my wife crying upstairs. In a hurry I rush up to the source, to see my wife holding me tightly in her arms and sobbing.

Looking up in the window just behind her, I could see red and blue lights arrive outside.",1,1766952682.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

My Baratza Encore is acting up. Coffee is grinding, but it’s not making its way from the burr chamber into the chute.

I took the grinder apart (pretty familiar with Baratzas), removed and cleaned the burrs, and didn’t see anything obviously broken. One thing I noticed: the black plastic adjustment ring (grind size selector) felt fairly loose. Is it normal for that piece to only be secured by the calibration screw?

After reassembling, the grinder starts normally, but the ground coffee quickly compacts inside the burr chamber—almost like a tamped puck—and then the grinder stalls.

Context: Our 6wk old has been having reflux symptoms since week 2ish. EBF. Always aggressively squirmy and fussy after feedings with back arching (she has a shallow latch which has improved, but the gassiness continues due to air intake w/BF). I basically have to keep patting her back and distract her after feedings for 30-40 min after feedings or else she cries while arching her body. Her nasal congestion is worse at night with a lot of throat clearing and occasional wheezing/stridor. Weight gain has been steady and she always wants to eat, has a tendency to overeat to soothe (as determined with the help of our LC). Lots of spit up. She looks uncomfortable most of the time while pooping, though maybe that's totally normal? Intermittent green poops w/mucus and more recently had a few diapers with specks of blood which prompted our pediatrician to advise cutting out dairy for now (this was over the phone--awaiting in person appt). 

I've been off dairy strictly for about 6 days without any real noticeable change in symptoms. The majority of my diet outside of fruits/veg has been homemade bread, nuts, oats, avocado, black tea/coffee, chips/crackers, which all have the potential to be triggers. 

I don't mind being super restrictive with my diet if it means my baby will feel better after feedings. Have you started with an elimination diet and then slowly introduced possible triggers one at a time and if so what was your experience like? Would you recommend this approach?",2,1766952414.0,MSPI,0,1.0,False

I seen discourse all the time about how some would have to “prepare” going into the dutch line solely because the barista will talk to them. I’ve had customers that cut me off, interrupt me, straight up just disrespect me just cause im explaining their order! hardly even making small talk but *literally* cant even say their total. i understand the cons of service and that people are people, so this is purely how i been perceiving things but at the same time, i dont think im asking for much either.

usually us broistas have a feel for how the customers are, at least most of us can understand when you’re the introverted type and will end it quicker ourselves. but its another thing when that introvert that doesnt let me finish what im saying before they start rolling their window up and driving off.

im not even asking for a conversation with everybody i meet, i more blame that after the great 2020 everyones social skills kind of went all over the place (me included). but at the very least if you’re coming in i want to be able to serve you in the way i was taught by dutch, not like any other coffee shop. when i was just a regular i would pick dutch for its atmosphere, i loved feeling apart of the stand from just my car.

i promise to not let a few bad apples ruin the whole day, but honestly if you want the mundane coffee experience why is dutch the first choice????????",0,1766952363.0,dutchbros,2,0.5,False

Important details:

	•	Not a joint account

	•	I didn’t give my email at checkout

	•	Discover and Capital One shouldn’t be sharing cardholder data like that

First, I want to thank everyone for sharing their insights, personal stories, and just overall support. I’ve never posted anything before! 

I’m a little over 7 months sober and I’m doing well. I’ve read posts from this group for quite sometime and want to thank each and every one of you! Just celebrated my first sober birthday and Christmas and it was good!! Waking up first, clear headed and just enjoying my coffee was wonderful! I don’t miss wondering what I said or did the night before, apologizing to my husband once again, etc! I’m “present” in my marriage even if that means falling asleep on the couch after a long day. It’s totally different from passing out because you drank too much. 

My issue is I’m not quite ready to say I’m never going to drink again. That’s a big statement and scares me a little. I don’t have cravings anymore. I have a counter on my phone but I’m not obsessed with it. I’ve retrained my brain to not have that drink every Friday to celebrate the week is over. I’m dealing with my emotions and feelings. We don’t have kids and we recently moved cross country to get away from the cold. 

I have a hard time going out to restaurants that don’t have any mocktails. I love trying new places, local food, etc.. When attempting to try new places, I check out the online menu and I just get annoyed. I don’t drink water with dinner at home. We’ve gone out many times and I’ll either order a NA beer or some sort of mocktail and I’m fine. There’s been times I just get a strange vibe from the waitstaff when asking. It annoys the crap out of me. The alcohol industry is something else!! 

I know moderation is a tricky thing and most people can’t do it. I get it!! It takes so much energy and just sucks the life out of you. I’ve read a good junk of all the books and they’ve been extremely helpful and I appreciate all the authors! They’re all fabulous.

Went with the Mova P10 Pro Ultra after reading a lot of recommendations across multiple robot vacuum subs. We have two dogs and went with this vacuum for its ability to handle pet hair & object avoidance.

I’ve ran two complete cleaning custom cycles and the robot doesn’t seem to be very good at anything, including object avoidance.

•	⁠As shown in my video the robot frequently (mostly after vacuuming a carpeted room) sits in 1 spot completely still or occasionally turning for 10-15 minutes, or until I pick up the robot and relocate it. Sometimes with both mops down. Sometimes when vacuuming carpeted rooms the robot will have 1 mop down and 1 up.

•	⁠With Intelligence Obstacle Avoidance on the robot’s navigation is absolutely terrible. It especially has trouble navigating on carpet. With Intelligence Obstacle Avoidance off the navigation is a bit better but still quite bad and it no longer avoids obstacles, including cables, very well at all.

•	⁠With Collison-Avoidance mode on the robot doesn’t clean tightly around objects. With it off the robot is bumping into everything, sometimes at fairly high speeds.

•	⁠We have an area rug and sectional couch in the middle of our living room, surrounded by laminate. When the robot finishes mopping the living room it keeps going up on the area rug, under the coffee table surround by our sectional, and just drives around on the carpet for ~10-15 minutes. Today I was sitting on the couch and the robot ran over my feet multiple times during this.

•	⁠Mapping is terrible. I had to mark all of my fully carpeted rooms as carpet manually because the robot only marked them as partially carpeted. The areas it marked as carpet for our area rugs are larger than the actual rugs are. I have had to just put no-go zones around most areas with tables, chairs, etc because the robot doesn’t probably detect legs or horizontal bars near the floor properly and continuously bumps into them.

Did I have unrealistic expectations when I purchased this robot? Did I just get a dud? Are a lot of the recommendations for this robot just bots or shills? I know this robot is considered one of the cheaper models, but at $500 retail I expected better, especially considering a lot of the recommendations online say it’s a great value for the price.",2,1766952194.0,RobotVacuums,1,1.0,False

I’ve attached 2 videos. Both are done with hot water and cocoa powder plus soap.

Now I’m aware my pull through is kind of hectic and messy, but I think it’s going very wrong before that already. With milk and coffee I can consistently get something approaching a heart, it’s the pour through that often makes it look a bit less pretty. I’ve tried a Rosetta, but that always ends up being a heart as well (attached a photo from earlier in the day with coffee and milk as well).

So what is going severely wrong for me? Or is it simply a matter of practicing more?

1. The Speaking: ChickyTutor & HelloTalk
This was my missing link. I was doing tons of ""sentence mining"" with Migaku, so I could understand everything, but I was still terrified to speak. I started using ChickyTutor as my ""safe space."" Since it’s an AI tutor, I can practice my output and test out the grammar I learned from shows without the ""social battery"" drain or the fear of sounding like an idiot. It’s perfect for building that initial muscle memory.

Once I feel warmed up and my tongue isn't tripping over desu/masu, I jump on HelloTalk to chat with actual natives. These two together took the ""speaking anxiety"" from a 10 down to a 2.

2. The Vocabulary: Migaku (The King of Immersion)
I stopped using textbooks and started ""mining"" my favorite shows. Migaku turns Netflix and YouTube into a giant classroom. It’s the only way I’ve been able to make Kanji stick because I associate the characters with a scene from a show I love, not a boring list.

3. The Foundation: Renshuu
While Migaku handles the immersion, I use Renshuu for grammar. It’s way more flexible than Duolingo and actually explains the why behind Japanese particles (which are honestly the final boss of the language). It’s cute, it’s community-run, and it doesn't harass you with passive-aggressive notifications.

4. The Reading: NHK News Web Easy
Every morning with my coffee, I read one article here. It’s real news written in simple Japanese with furigana (reading aids) over the Kanji. It’s my daily ""vibe check"" to see if my reading speed is actually improving.",2,1766951134.0,ImmerseWithMigaku,0,0.75,False

I was definitely the type to skip breakfasts most mornings. I would either tell myself that I didn't have enough time or I got overwhelmed by my choices and just decided I would be fine with nothing. No surprise that just having coffee each morning led me to be starving by late morning, and when I would fold and buy a breakfast somewhere, I'd feel regret for wasting my money when I had food that I could have made at home.

I had some time off during Christmas break, and decided to try having stovetop oatmeal in the mornings. My brother got on an overnight oat kick, and I wanted to take advantage of all the extra oats we had in the house. The past two weeks, it's all I've been having for breakfast, and it's been a game changer! I feel full and satisfied all the way until lunch, it takes me no time to make (I make it while I'm waiting for the coffee maker to finish), and it's an excuse for me to use up fruit in the fridge that might otherwise get forgotten about.

I know this isn't revolutionary by any means, but it's changed how I start my mornings and has helped me have much better days because I'm well fed. It's also got me happy that I'm getting my fibre in!

I have really enjoyed being part of this community and reading everyone's MDs over the years. So, I thought it was finally time to contribute my own! Using the template from [u/MymajorisTrees](https://www.reddit.com/user/MymajorisTrees/).

**Section One: Bio**

I (F30) and my husband just eloped and I thought it would be fun to share a quick recap of what we spent and what we prioritized. We got engaged over the summer, and both of us pretty quickly came to the realization we did not want a traditional wedding. We did consider a small elopement (i.e. inviting 30 close family/friends), but ultimately did not want to have to wait a year plus to get married and settled on eloping just the two of us.

I will add that we did not receive any financial help from parents nor was any offered. I do think if either of our parents made a big fuss about our elopement but were willing to significantly chip in, we would've been at least open to the idea. However! Since that was not the case it was an easy decision for us and everyone else got on board. I only ended up getting like, 5 comments max about how disappointed a random aunt of my husband's was about us not having a wedding.

We did get a few veiled questions on if we were expecting, which we are not but was part of the calculus as we'd like to try for a baby this year.

Occupation: I am in Accounting and my husband is in project management (not tech).

Location: Midwest/HCOL

**Section Two: Assets + Debt**

This is currently my numbers only but we will be combining finances after marriage.

**Retirement Balance: $223k**

**Other investments: $64k**

**Home Equity: $0ish**

I bought the home by myself a few years ago so my interest rate isn't 3% but also not 7%. We have recently done a handful of renovations and are debating selling in the spring if the market isn't atrocious. Honestly the location is incredible and I love my neighborhood, but the house isn't quite right for us and would need an extensive ($$$) remodel in order to get it even halfway there. My equity is probably higher than $0 but I am conservative given the housing market is so strange right now.

**Savings account balance:** **$63,000** ($23k emergency fund, $40k earmarked for renovations/sinking funds)

**Checking account balance: $3,700**

**Credit card debt:** **$0** I have a running balance but it's paid in full each month and net out my cash numbers above.

**Student Loan Debt**:

Federal (me): $5,600 

My federal loan interest is low and I refuse to give another penny to the government early to repay this.

My husband's student loan debt is much higher, and we'll evaluate how we want to balance paying this off vs interest rates/saving for a down payment.

**Total Student Loan Debt: $5,600**

**Cars:**

I have a small SUV with an atrociously high interest rate (8%) that I'd like to pay off this year, depending on bonuses. Or at the very least transfer to my credit union.

**Total Car Debt: $11k**

**Total Car Assets:** **$15k**

My husband also has a sedan that is almost paid off. Both of our cars have pretty low miles. We plan to try for a baby this year and probably plan to keep our cars for at least another 4-5 years. We'd like to eventually upgrade to our ""dream"" vehicles (Toyota 4Runner and Tundra), which I then plan to drive until they die!

**Total Net worth (just me): $350k (!!!)**

**Section Three: Income**

We make $270k base income, split 60/40 (I am the higher earner).

Our bonuses can both fluctuate, I'd say a good average for us would be $30k but not guaranteed.

**Section Four: Wedding Expenses**

**Dress/Clothing**:

Hers: $350 dress, veil, and hair piece + $0 alterations +$0 vintage coat (borrowed) + shoes $60 + accessories $48 = **$458**

I bought my dress from a well-known online store and absolutely loved it! It didn't need any alterations and fit me incredibly well. I debated going to a boutique but had a quick turnaround time (<3 months) and really didn't want to spend thousands on a dress. I originally did buy a veil which I didn't end up using, and a cute rhinestone headband I wore to dinner. A vintage coat was my something ""borrowed"".

My wedding shoes were cute little white lace up boots from Amazon. Accessories included cute little socks with white hearts on them from Bombas, small gold hoops for my second piercing, and a velvet ring box (for photos). I wore my daily gold hoops as my main earrings and no other jewelry aside from my rings.

His: Suit, tie, overcoat, scarf and shoes = **$697**

We went to a local men's store for custom suiting and got such a good deal on his wedding clothes. His suit was non-traditional and they are all pieces he can wear in the future too. This price included tailoring.

**Wedding Rings**: n/a

Our rings are not included.

**Officiant/Photography & Engagement Photos:** $475 officiant + $1,600 wedding photography = **$2,075**

Where we got married is super popular for elopements but I was still shocked at the pricing for photography and officiant services. My photographer was on the lower end of the spectrum (there was someone charging $6k???) and she was great to work with. We landed with our officiant because she was really the only option this time of year, but she ended up being wonderful and really flexible, and our ceremony was lovely. We did not have engagement photos.

**Lodging/venue: $950** \- we stayed at a local resort for 4 days and 3 nights. They very kindly let us use an indoor space last minute due to weather, so we ended up getting married inside and taking our photos around the resort as well.

**Hair and makeup:** **$0** for hair and makeup, I did my own. Wedding prep was approx. **$500**: $120 manicure & pedicure, $130 wax, and $250 for hair color & cut. The hair color & cut is part of my ""usual"" annual spend but still included here. It was also a bit last minute and more expensive than what I normally budget because my usual lady cancelled on me for a family emergency. I had to scramble to find a reputable salon to fit me in the week of!

**Flowers: $255** for a flower bouquet, boutonniere, and flower crown. I did buy a veil but decided to ditch that option a few weeks before the wedding as I was worried about getting it to stay on my own. I'm so happy I went with the flower crown because it was gorgeous and really tied my whole look together.

**Cake: $30** for a cherry cheesecake from our favorite bakery in town

**Entertainment:** **$0** but we both made wedding playlists we enjoyed all weekend long. We also played his during our ceremony and the have decided the songs that played during our vows are going to be our ""official"" songs :)

**Dinners, Drinks, Shopping, & Other weekend activities:** \~**$1,200**

This included our wedding dinner, drinks and snacks we picked up on our way for the weekend, and other meals/coffee/etc. We also did a sauna session that weekend, and shopping at local boutiques for gifts for family and friends (and ourselves!).

**Ceremony Location:** $0

We originally wanted to get married at a public beach but knew since it was winter it was going to be 50/50. Thankfully the resort we stayed at had an indoor option we were able to use and still took most of our photos outside, which was important to me.

**Venue Coordinator:** n/a but we talked to a nice lady via email a few times about the indoor option

**Wedding Costs Total: $6,155**

**Section Five: Wedding Day Explanation & Diary**

**How did you save up for this event and for how long?** We saved $1k a month for 3 months and pulled another \~$3k from savings.

**Did you accumulate credit card debt for your wedding?** No. A lot of it was put on a credit card but will be paid in full.

**What about a honeymoon trip?** We'd like to do a honeymoon in the spring for about a week. We will plan to do a 1-year anniversary trip as well!

**Wedding weekend:** We got married on Friday & it went by so quickly! It was one of the best weekends of my life and I loved getting to marry my best friend. The rest of the weekend we just relaxed and enjoyed ourselves and did a lot of shopping & eating. I can't wait to go back up next year.

**Reflection:**

I'm so happy we eloped and did what felt right for \*us\*. There was maybe one moment on Friday I wished our families were there, when we called our parents after our wedding dinner just to chat and reflect with them. At the same time, I was so grateful it was just us so we could focus on ourselves the entire weekend and not family dynamics. At some point we'll figure out our party in the spring but that will likely be an afternoon backyard affair with some cheap catering and Costco drinks.

These are all mine:
- Diego Armando was a much-loved lawyer: Not because of how he defended clients (which, to be Mia's mentor, he must have been very good at), but because of the person he was; probably friendly, loyal, and kind. The attempted murder would have hurt much more if it had been someone with many acquaintances.

- Many people knew him: Something I feel FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART is that Raymond Shields/Eddie Fender and he were very close friends, although they clashed a lot. And who knows, it occurred to me that maybe he was a rival of Neil Marshall and friends outside of court.

- A lawyer from a very young age: First theory I came up with. In the background of a photo of Miles, Phoenix, and Larry (9 years old), we can see Robert Hammond, Marvin Grossberg, and Diego Armando. If my mental calculations are correct, Diego would be 18 years old here.

- Latin American: I came up with a pretty good story in my head: He was born in Bariloche into a fairly large family with coffee plantations all over the world; perhaps a very specific case made him start studying law so young. His family supported him and they haven't heard from him since the poisoning. I imagine he lived with his whole family in a fairly large house on the outskirts of the city.

- Culture: He reads poetry, likes theater and music like jazz or tango. He likes to write and practice instruments, but he blushes when asked to play or recite something. He knows a lot about that kind of culture.

- And my last headshot, which I'll need some corrections for here: Gregory was his mentor. Doesn't it seem strange that he's ""such a good lawyer,"" being a disciple of Grossberg? He could also have met Ray/Eddie there. (I got this from one of the icebergs)

1py0dkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1py0dkz/19_m4f_india_online_looking_for_a_cinematic_old/,"19 [M4F] #India #Online - Looking for a CINEMATIC, Old soul connection with 3 AM deep talks","Heads up: Reading this might make you wonder why you ever settled for a ""boring"" connection before. 

I’m going to be honest, I’m a total walking paradox.

I’m the guy who can sit with you at 3 AM having the deepest philosophical talk about the universe, but 5 minutes later I’ll be cracking jokes with what my friends call **""chaotic confidence""** just to make you laugh. I have this ""old soul"" vibe, but I’m just as wild when the mood hits.

Right now, I’m 19 and a student. I spend a lot of my time learning and working on personal projects, and I take my goals seriously. 

**But don't get me wrong, I’m still figuring life out like everyone else. I just take my dreams (and my feelings) seriously.**

Honestly, I'm tired of doing this alone. I want someone to share the lore, the struggle, and the quiet moments with *right now*. I know I talk a lot about my goals, but I promise to be the biggest fan of yours too.

I also have some **stats** you should probably know about.

First, I have a secret **""better than cafe recipe""** where I make the best hot and cold coffee you’ll ever have.

Second, I genuinely love cooking (if I don't know your favorite food, I will **learn to cook it from scratch** just to surprise you).

And third, I love traveling. I have this dream of seeing the world in the future, eventually with our families together. I want that big, happy energy.

Physically, I see the world in cinematic shots. I have that **""Intellectual Streetwear""** aesthetic: deep brown eyes, glasses, and a **sharp jawline** (I actually take skincare seriously lol).

Body-wise, I’m **skinny-athletic (172cm)** right now, but I’m actually starting my fitness journey on **Jan 6th**. I have a specific goal in mind, so you’d be meeting me right at the start of the transformation. I also have a unique **fire-shaped mark** on my body (guess where) that’s honestly just a really cool detail.

I also have a private archive which I started months ago full of thoughts and moments I've saved specifically for ""the one.""

I’ll be real about what I’m looking for. Someone whose a yapperrr with Great Convo skills!! I tend to be really drawn to that **sharp, defined look** (whether you're skinny, curvy, or athletic). Whether you’re smiling or serious, there is just something about a defined jawline, a nice nose, or those striking eyes that instantly catches my attention.

The only hard dealbreaker is that I don't smoke or vape. I don't drink personally, but it's not a dealbreaker if you do. I just need someone who keeps it clean enough so we can actually live long enough to enjoy the life we build together.

Most importantly, I date with the **intention of a serious, forever commitment**. Loyalty is everything to me, so Long Distance isn't an issue.

**If this is your first time trying to find love online, don't worry, I plan on making it your last.**

To prove you actually read this far, tell me which **vibe** you want us to have (just DM me the number):

1. **Protective:** I want to ""hate"" you like **Eren hated Mikasa**. (Translation: I would burn the world down just to keep you safe). 🧣
2. **Cinematic:** You be the **Max to my Lucas**, and I promise to never let the music stop when things get heavy. 🎧
3. **Best Friends:** We act like the main characters who scare everyone else, but actually we’re just two dorks getting coffee.
4. **Chaotic:** You walk into the room, and I whisper, *""Guess what I’m wearing? The smile you just gave me.""* (Cheesy? Yes. Will it work? Also yes).

If you liked my vibe, stop overthinking.
Send me a DM and tell me: **What is the one place in the world you've always wanted to visit?**

*(P.S. Go listen to ""Her"" by JVKE to get my vibe).*

(Obviously I payed for everything) after the date I messages her of course saying it was nice to finally meet her and talk to her in person, she said the same and said it was a very enjoyable evening.

The thing is she never texts first nothing at all we don’t text at all it’s always me that has too message first etc… which I don’t mind but it’s kinda confusing what she wants

1py0a6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/mixedrace/comments/1py0a6p/a_constant_mistrust_and_chip_on_my_shoulder/,"A constant mistrust and ""chip on my shoulder""","I am Filipino mixed with white. I noticed that I constantly have a “chip on my shoulder”. This anger and constant mistrust of people’s actions towards me.  

My friends and I were at a Chinese restaurant. My friend is white. The staff came by with our coffees. My friend’s latte had latte art. A carefully crafted cat. The Chinese waitress put my drink down. It looked like it just was plopped into the cup. The waitress looked at my friend and said, “Here’s your drink, I drew you a cat”.  She didn’t say anything to me. I don’t know if she was flirting with my friend (who had his girlfriend with him) or giving him the “white treatment”. *But it still left a bitter feeling in me and felt really angry for some reason*. 

A few days later, I was exiting through an airport in Spain. The couple in front of me was white British, and the airport staff spoke to them in English. She looked at me, and I said, “US American”. She just signaled. I took that as follow the people in front of me. She yelled towards my direction in Spanish. She repeated. I was confused. My Spanish is bad. She definitely heard my stumbling in Spanish and then I followed it up with a long “umm. Huh?” She still continued in Spanish. My brain was thinking “why not actually talk to me in English? Why did you signal at me instead of giving me actual instructions?” *Was it a skin tone thing?* Or was it that she just subconsciously defaulted to Spanish? Why Spanish *to me*? 

Even among the Filipino spaces, I feel left out or misunderstood. I was at a Filipino bakery and told the lady what I wanted. She looked at me, and even though I said the Tagalog words (mixed with some English) for the things I wanted, she clarified in English. I bought my stuff, and she began to explain how to reheat things. I respectfully listened, then after I said the equivalent to “thank you ma’am” in Filipino, she just responded in English. I knew she spoke Filipino. I heard her speak it to her customers and to her staff, but *why default to English to me*? Is it because she couldn’t understand me, am I not Filipino enough, or she didn't want to see that I was trying to communicate? My brain again just started to think that no matter how hard I try, I don’t belong in these spaces. 

I lived in the Philippines for a bit and a lot of people defaulted to “oh so you are American” even after I tell them I am both. And in some instances they tried to explain the most basic aspects of Filipino culture to me even after repeated attempt to explain to them that I am not your typical American. I have a Filipino parent and even though I grew up outside the Philippines I know some things. Then I get impatient, snappy, flustered, and snarky. 

I tired of the micro aggressions, lack of understanding, and this constant feeling that every misdirect is a result of *“oh it’s my appearance, that’s why”* feeling. ",5,1766950637.0,mixedrace,0,1.0,False

1py08n6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1py08n6,Flag Friday #23: DIRIGO,"Well, no time like the present to get another one out the gate!  And have we ever got one, the state that failed to restore its old glory in the most controversial flag referendum since the Illinoian debacle.  Since they seem determined to not reinstate the Lone Pine, they clearly seek something better; I offer this to discerning Mainers.

(That's not a joke, by the way.  I actually posted this to r/Maine to see what they'd make of it.  There followed no less than two dozen blunt refusals, jokes about wallpaper and wrapping paper, an Oregon Trail reference, and accusations of excessive consumption of Allen's coffee brandy.  Philistines.)

The post, for those who want a laugh: [People of Maine: If you had a new state flag but it COULDN'T be the Lone Pine, would you fly THIS? : r/Maine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/1pvslzb/people_of_maine_if_you_had_a_new_state_flag_but/)

ANYWAYS, on with the show.

This flag combines two principal sources: the tinctures and symbols of the Lone Pine flag -- of course -- and the composition of the banner of arms of the traditional French county (as in actually ruled by a count!) and thereafter province of Maine -- today divided into the departments of Sarthe (who still bear the old arms but not the banner) and Mayenne.  The field of buff is now semy of green pines, similar to the semy-de-lis field of the provincial flag, while the blue bordure (the same as the mullet of five points on the Lone Pine flag) is charged in the dexter chief with a silver/white mullet of five points, a combination of the North Star from Maine's flags and arms (itself allusive to the motto ""DIRIGO"" -- I lead) and the silver/white lion rampant in that position on the provincial banner.  The idea was to use the French banner as the basis, as the French arrived there from Europe first, and thus the province may be the namesake of the state (although it is not quite certain).

I hope that this flag is found deserving of the honor of winning this competition, and that for those who have followed the link, the snarky opinions of Mainers have not put you off it.  Enjoy, upvote, and comment for further insights.

They favor my two younger siblings a lot and will give them whatever they ask for. They are never asked to do anything and never get in trouble. My sister is 5 so I understand not asking much of her, but they dont discipline her, so shes a bully to other kids and a brat in our house. My brother is 15 though so I dont see why hes not expected to do anything and why they have such low expectations. 

I have a job. I work at a fast food place. But my parents make me buy them things constantly. I dont mind it every once in a while but it is CONSTANT and they often wont tell me im paying until we're there. Most of my money has been drained by my mom going to get coffee. I know they've bought me lots of things over the years, but theyre in their 30s with two more-than-minimum-wage incomes. Im sixteen and making 11 an hour. They refuse to let me get my license but complain constantly about driving me to work and school and friends' houses. 

They LOVE going in my room and ""seeing if it's clean"" but whether it is or not they will ground me for SOME reason. 

Ive been trying to save up so I can move out ASAP bc as much as I love them, they drain me and I figure our relationship will be better when im not under their roof. My money was hidden in a lunchbox I dont use. 

The messages attached are what I got from my dad while coming home from work with my friend. 

After getting home, my friend came in with me to ensure im safe. We made up that she just wanted to see my tattoo gun. My parents noticed I was pissy and asked about it. I said I dont want them going through my things especially not my money. My dad said ""I was more upset that you wouldnt help your mom if she needed it."" I tried to explain that i would if she NEEDED it, but the situation described was not a NEED. Dad insisted she would have paid me back but I know from past experience she would NOT. 

They then of course got mad my room was messy and said if I dont clean it they'll take my money (I have around 170 right now. I know its not much). I cleaned. They say they didnt take any money and that checks out, but it was the ""joking"" abt taking it and their history of using my money that upset me and makes me think they WOULD take it if they wanted to. 

My friend was concerned and is even gonna take me to the bank so I can change it to large bills and hide it under my carpet. She says theyre emotionally abusive and using me. 

TL;DR -- parents found my money and ""joked"" about taking it. They use me for money a lot and I dont trust them since they constantly go through my things.",38,1766950530.0,AmIOverreacting,97,0.93,False
1py0754,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1py0754/any_advice_at_all/,Any advice at all,"Hello, all. I haven’t been on Reddit in quite some time but I’m feeling a little desperate and need some advice…any advice. 

Some background information: I grew up in a very unhealthy household. Mentally, physically, you name it. I struggled with self-confidence and my weight pretty much my entire life. I was always around 145 to 150 in high school (5’3 so I think I’m considered petite) and felt so…gross. 

I was 145 when I met my husband, and that was my weight when I got pregnant the first time in 2023. I went from 145 pounds to 198 pounds during that pregnancy. It took me almost 2 years to lose back to 155. I tried several diets and exercise routines over that time but nothing ever lasted more than a week or two before I was exhausted or so hungry I was nauseous. Fasting changed that, but it still took so long and I had to be so careful, I was quick to eat even an ounce too much and gain several pounds back. One missed day felt like weeks of setback. I finally hit 155; I wasn’t that happy with the way I looked but I was proud I had finally made it that far. Thanksgiving of 2024 I found out I was pregnant again. My emotions snowballed but I managed to watch how much I ate. I went from 155 to 196. Not a startling difference, but enough that I wasn’t entirely discouraged to try and lose again. 

I had my second child in July of this year and pretty much started researching different weight loss habits and methods as soon as I was healed enough to start exercising. I found a set of videos that were low-impact strength training (which was the best as per the research I’ve done). I found a channel called Coach Viva on YouTube that detailed “lazy” ways to lose fat, which were mainly small lifestyle changes that added up over time. 

I’ve started trying to incorporate more vegetables by buying fresh over canned. I’ve started trying to have more fruit by making smoothies with oats and Greek yogurt. Greek yogurt has replaced sour cream in my meals when we have dishes like homemade burritos and chili. I’ve started adding cottage cheese to my scrambled eggs. I’ve managed to stick to exercising at the very least three times a week for at least 10 minutes each session. I don’t eat chips, I don’t bake sweets like muffins and cookies anymore, I stay away from candy except for the occasional Reeses Cup when I go grocery shopping as a treat for myself. I drink more water than I ever have in my life, and I’m shooting for a liter by at least 6:00 P.M. every day. I’ve cooked meals for the last three to four years, and NEVER eat fast food anymore. I’ve started drinking coffee with literally an ounce of creamer only (I measure it out) and trying to keep up with herbal tea at night to calm down and get good sleep. 

I’ve managed to go from 189 pounds when I left the hospital to 155. But that’s where the progress stopped. I’ve been bouncing between 155 and 162 for about two months now. None of it seems to be working anymore. I checked my weight last Monday (my weekly weight check) and I’m back to 164. Since then I’ve been pretty discouraged and have just kinda drifted. I’m pretty sure I’ve gained more than that back and I hate it. I’ve worked so hard to lose and the progress just stalls and goes backwards, even when I’m doing everything “right”. At this point I would suck it all out with a vacuum if I could. 😭 it’s impacted my mental health and self-confidence/esteem immensely, which in turn has affected my relationship with my entire family. I’m looking into therapy to help but I won’t lie, I absolutely hate myself right now. I want to hit at the very least 125, but 120 is my goal.

Excuse the very crude drawing of my living room but I’ve been frustrated for a long time because I don’t feel I’m utilizing the space very well. I also just got a record player and I’m struggling to find a spot for it. The computer at the desk doubles as our tv and it has been challenging to find a configuration that feels right. Also there is a protruding part of the wall that seems to cut the room in half. Any advice would be great! Thank u!,1,1766950394.0,FengShui,0,1.0,False

I went to three Walmarts because in the first one I found a lot of items on sale -so I cleaned out the other two stores. What was left of it – somebody got there before me. Chips were $.50 each. The individuals were between a dollar and $1.25. The bars were between a dollar and three dollars a pack. On two of them I got a one dollar off coupon so they were $.50 each. The Atkins were $2.50 per pack and I do eat METRx and those were $2.50 each box. So this isn’t my whole meal profile, but these are definitely my snacks and post workout drinks… for a whiiiiile. 💪🏽😅

as you may be aware, atrioc is the COFFEE COW. This means he is a cow (creature that wanders aimlessly) and is obsessed with coffee(a drink). Now, please pay attention. this clearly means that big a is a suit at BIG BAR. When a drunk person is ready to go home, they will say to the bar tender, ""\*Slurred speech\*I  need waymo."" the bar tender will than be able to keep serving them ""WAY MO"" drinks. 

Now here is where big A comes in. He is the coffee(connected to drinks) cow(cows are like waymos). CLEARLY, Big A is an EXEC at BIG BAR, and the GENIUS who released the COFFEE COW FILES(seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/tzxriv/i_came_up_with_a_new_atrioc_joke/)) was trying to OUT him before it was too late. Now gen z will become a new genoration of alcoholics because of the waymos, or should i say, ""everclear cows""

1pxzxkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildinpublic/comments/1pxzxkj/i_built_a_habit_tracker_that_locks_social_media/,I built a habit tracker that locks social media apps if I don’t log,"I want to journal daily and track habits, but I always start forgetting to do so after a couple of days.

So I built ""Log or Lock: Daily Journal"" to solve my own problem.

Every day at 20:00 my social media apps get locked if I didn't log the day – forcing me to log my day. As soon as I log, social media apps get unlocked again.  
  
With this approach I were able to log every day for the last 5 months. Before that I always forgot to log after a couple of days.  
My friends have been using a beta version already for 3 months now and for them it also works super well and all of us have a long streak of days logged.

I added 3 input types to track data:  
\- Freetext: ""What did I do today"", ""Highlight of the day"", ""Breakfast"", ""Lunch"", ""Dinner"", ...  
\- Checkbox: for everything you can check (obviously, lol :D) ""Datenight?"", ""Feeling healthy?"", “Workout?"",...  
\- Range slider: I am using that for ""Mood"", ""Protein powder scoops"", ""Drinks"",...  
\- Steps: Auto displays today's steps.

In the monthly overview you can always see the total and average data of the Checkbox, Slider and Steps items and quickly navigate to each item.

Your logged data is only stored on your device, but can be exported from your phone as .csv (Excel or Sheets format).At no point is the data you logged leaving your phone.

A friend of mine exported the data and analyzed it with AI to find patterns, but that is up to you. Maybe I will implement that functionality natively sometime in the future, but even then you will 100% be in control of the data you logged.

[App store link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/log-or-lock-daily-journal/id6746960315) (iphone only atm)

Since we are all makers here, some more insight of building the app: 

The app is fully written in swiftUi, its my second swiftUi App, but first bigger project. 

I started working on the app roughly 7 months ago.  
It took \~4 weeks to get approval from Apple to use the Family Controls framework which handles the blocking of the apps. It was approved on the first try, but Apple has its own review process for that API. Working with the API was a real PITA. I had a hard time getting it up and running at first and the whole API feels a bit buggy. Also, not being able to open the main app right from the screen blocker screen is a bummer. After I solved all the issues it was mostly smooth sailing.

I changed the design a few times. First very minimal and clean, then a bit more bold and in the end I stuck with the ""scrapbook sticker"" style (which was designed by a friend who was also using the app for daily journaling).

The stickers were created with nano banana.

I implemented payments with RevenueCat. I worked with payments before with Stripe, but never on iOS and it was way more complicated than expected. I had the issue that it first didn’t work in internal TestFlights because it didn’t add the tax information yet (took me way too long to figure out tax where the reason the payment didnt work inside the app).  
The app is fully usable with the free plan, but I thought would be nice to maybe get a few coffee out of it and I wanted to learn how to add payments on iOS.

Lastly I implemented the Facebook SDK. I am quite confident that nobody will download the app without proper marketing and since I implemented Revenuecat already I was hooked to also get a few downloads and implemented the Facebook SDK so that I can play with Facebook and IG ads. And oh boy, Facebook really doesn’t want my money :D It was super annoying to get everything set up but in the end I figured it out

So overall thoughts:It is a fun lil project wich became bigger and bigger because I it was fun working on it.

Lmk what you think. Always happy to receive feedback :)

1pxzvzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pxzvzg/aitah_for_cutting_my_fil_out_of_holiday_family/,AITAH for cutting my FIL out of Holiday Family Dinners,"Buckle up, this will probably be long and I’ll add a lot of context. My fiancés (40m) dad (~70m I think?) is the kind of grumpy old man you can never please. He is a mixed pot of mental illness (depression, loneliness) mixed with just being a child in an old man’s body. Meaning he’s extremely immature emotionally. His version of conversation is pointing out flaws in anything everything around him and “suggesting” ways to improve. Whether it’s the food you make, the way your home is arranged, how you train your dogs, etc (meanwhile he has no right to make such comments due to the fact that he has never gone out of his way to cook another person a meal in his life, or had two dogs to raise and train for himself, etc)

Another example of a comment he made that was just so tactless and rude was one time he said he liked the way we had plants and lights on the top of 1 of 2 bookshelves we have in the living room. He said we should put plants on top of the 2nd bookshelf as well. Which I replied (and thinking he just didn’t notice) that shelf is for the urns of our children who passed away and is a small memorial of sorts to them. To which he doubled down with no hesitation “yeah, so just move that stuff and get plants on there”. 
(This was just to give context of how out to lunch this man is and how tactless and rude he can be.)

Every Christmas we try to plan in a way that will make him happy, along with being able to spend quality time with my MIL (FILs ex wife of over 30 years), my mother (another extremely toxic and emotionally immature person), and my finances step mom (FIL ex wife of about 5 years). 

On top of that, FIL cannot drive due to drinking and driving and getting into a wreck that severely crippled him a few years ago. So it’s always up to us to taxi him around (he lives a 1hr 45m drive away). 

This was the first Christmas we had a living baby (3 months f) with us and we dint plan to host this year. We got an invite from my MIL to have Christmas dinner at her place (which is about 1.5 hours away) and we accepted, deciding to stay the night so it would be easier on us for driving and packing half our home (packing for an infant is a lot) in and out of the car. 

FIL offered to come and stay at our house to watch the dogs while we were away. Due to some miscommunication between him and my fiance, he arrived at 1pm on Christmas Eve (after we all agreed it would be a rest day for us since myself and our daughter were under the weather with a cold). My fiance had previously told him to come by 2pm or after. Fiance said he’d be home by 12/12:30 so I could shower and clean up a little bit before FIL arrived. Being a FTM to a baby, I was sitting on the couch in the middle of a disaster living room, unwashed, hair unbrushed, I hadn’t eaten yet, I was still sick, and tbh getting the worst period of my life when he showed up early. And fiance was not home. It’s fair to say I was not happy about any of this. 

Despite that, we had as decent of an afternoon and evening as we could with him and all his “suggestions” and opinions. Fiance made spaghetti for us (the same exact way I do) and he complimented the meal for once (meanwhile when I made it one of the last times he came over, he was disappointed that I didn’t hand make the sauce by scratch). 

We woke up on Christmas and it was a scramble to get everything we needed ready to go overnight with a baby for the first time, but we still made him a nice breakfast and instructed him on what to feed the dogs and to help himself to our fridge and pantry for dinner. By midday we were finally starting to pack the car and he kept making comments like “did you even consider what I’d have for dinner?” Or “this isn’t what I planned for Christmas”…….. my fiance reiterated how much food was available to him and said we are not turning around after an hour of being at fiancés moms house to come home and make him dinner. 
I also would have loved to ask him what exactly he had planned for his Christmas then when HE SUGGESTED AND OFFERED TO STAY ALONE WITH THE DOGS AT OUR HOUSE WHILE HE KNEW WE WERE AWAY. But my fiance and I were just so done with his miserable demeanour by then and got out as fast as we could at that point.  

Now Boxing Day morning comes around, we had a great time at my MIL home for Christmas, we had a coffee in the morning and hit the road to come back home. The plan had always been for us to host a dinner for FIL and my mom on Boxing Day. 

As soon as we got home (about 11am) I got to work in the kitchen. The man had wonderful snippy comments to make the whole time that were usually some kind of jab at me or my fiance. He watched me in the kitchen for hours making our meal, but apparently the whole time he was texting a friend of his to come get him. A major ice rain storm had started and my FIL was nagging at someone to come get him from over an hour away so that he could leave. Meanwhile the plan had always been for him to stay the night and we’d drop him off home the next day as we had plans in the area. 

About an hour before dinner was ready he comes up to me and says something like “I see you’ve been working hard in here for hours now but I’m afraid I won’t be here to eat”. I don’t know what to say. On one hand I’m so done with this guy I want him out of my home. On the other hand, it’s extremely rude to me that he decided to leave when he did. 

…. Basically we tried to plan with him and make him happy and we spent most of the holiday with him, only for him to just be a miserable old man and stress us out unimaginably. 

I forgot to mention, he wakes up at like 4-5am, comes to our living room and sits on the couch staring at the wall until we woke up on Christmas morning. I think he sits there and stews and makes up problems in his own head because when I came downstairs to make a coffee at about 8 or 9 am he hit me with 3 or 4 very awkward and rude comments and mentioned wanting to go home (despite previously offering to watch the dogs while we would be gone that day). But when my fiance came down he wasn’t so direct and jokingly mentioned going home. To which my fiance said, we can’t fit you, two dogs, a child, all our things and ourselves in the Hyundai accent we are taking to MIL that day and therefore could not drop him off (it would be about a 15-20 min detour if we could).

So, after all is said and done. Fiance and I are still mentally recovering from this miserable experience, we get the text message that it was “the worst Christmas ever” for him and that “it seemed to have gone to the dogs”? And how he misses Christmas with my MIL and fiance from over 30 years ago. The man lives in the past and expects to be the centre of attention and to be handed everything on a silver platter the whole time. For us to smile and sympathize as he complains about anything and everything.


As I mentioned this was our first Christmas with a baby after losing two previously and both my fiance and I grew up in “broken” homes, so making Christmas a priority for our daughter is extremely important to us. He ruined this Christmas for us, just like the last few and I’ve decided I’m done trying to please him and that he’s not welcome in our home anymore for things like Christmas dinners. My fiance is mostly of the same mind, but we’re trying to figure out how to tell this to FIL. There’s no right way because he has no emotional capacity and it would be like talking to a wall, but we have to make it known. 

(Another cherry on top for context is that on more or less every single holiday, Father’s Day, Thanksgiving, fiancés birthday, family day, etc is we get a “woe is me” text from him where he tries to guilt us for not traveling to him and making the day about him - meanwhile he doesn’t even approach us before hand or put any semblance of effort into planning anything from his end).

I feel like I’m NTA but curious on what other opinions are.

If we start talking now, we could celebrate christmas together with matching pajamas next year!","Please don't reach out if we're not looking for the same thing, I have no interest in wasting my time or yours. No NSFW right out of the gate either please.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 25-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?",1,1766949630.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

**Drink more water:** Why? This helps the body regulate glucose by actions such as kidney glucose excretion, preventing dehydration and reducing concentrated blood sugar. How? Most adults should try to drink 64-80 oz of water daily (tea/coffee without sugar, sparkling water, or water with a sugar-free water flavor enhancer can all count towards total).

**Move your body:** Why? Using muscles (in any way) lowers blood glucose. How? ANY. You do not need to buy equipment or memberships… you could dance in your kitchen or do light leg lifts while watching TV. Just move more than you would otherwise. It is especially effective when done shortly after eating.

**Eliminate sugary drinks:** No regular soda, juice, or sugar in coffee/tea. None. Why? They increase your glucose a lot, and quickly. How? Switch to water and/or use alternative sweeteners (there is a lot of controversy on if sweeteners are bad for you, and a lot of information out there about which ones are better than others – do your research.) *Tip: one step further - eliminate “white” foods (white bread/bagels, standard flour tortillas, cookies/cakes, standard potatoes, white rice, cream of wheat cereal, sweetened yogurts).*

**Add fiber:** Why? Soluble fiber in the gut slows digestion (including carb absorption), reduces post-meal spikes, and is associated with better insulin sensitivity and lower A1C’s. (Also shown to lower LDL cholesterol and support heart health.) How? It can be difficult to increase fiber while maintaining diet goals. The easiest way is to take a supplement, such as psyllium husk, which comes in many power, pill and other forms. *Tip: Introduce and increase slowly to avoid any unpleasant GI upset.*

**Stop eating before bedtime:** Why? Insulin sensitivity decreases at night. Active digestion = lower sleep quality. Eating at night increases liver glucose output (you’ll get higher fasting numbers). If you get heartburn/have GERD, it will also help that. How? Stop eating 3 or more hours before your bedtime. *Tip: If you need calories before going to bed (like you missed  your last meal), or you prone to nocturnal lows, you can modify by eating or drinking a protein-based snack before bed (hard boiled eggs, lean beef/chicken slices, plain Greek yogurt, bone broth, low-carb protein shakes).*

**Sleep 7-9 hours per night:** Why? Improves insulin resistance. Even 1 short night (4-5 hours) can measurably reduce insulin sensitivity. This one is pretty complex, but it changes hormone reactions that directly influence blood glucose, and is often missed as a factor. How? Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.

Please discuss this list with your health care provider. Everyone has unique health care needs and there may be other factors that change what is best for you.

1pxztpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pxztpl/americano_canadiano_500cad/,Americano/ Canadiano [$500CAD],It's been almost 2 years since my espresso journey began and am still really happy with my starting setup (bambino plus & DF54) that was suggested in this sub. That being said my wife and I drink a lot of cortados but during the week she tends to enjoy drinking Americanos/ Canadianos. She usually pulls her double shot then uses the hot water dispenser function to fill her travel mug. I just wonder if it would make sense to invest in a Fellow Aiden or Technivorm or something else that would be quick and suitable for her to use while still providing a quality cup of coffee. ,1,1766949554.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1pxztot,https://llclick.com/b72ssccb/,The Day the Wi-Fi Became Self-Aware,"One quiet afternoon, Sam decided it was finally time to be productive. Coffee brewed. Laptop opened. Motivation… mostly present.

Sam clicked “Connect to Wi-Fi.”

Nothing happened.

“No problem,” Sam said confidently, like someone who absolutely did not depend on the internet for everything in life. A quick refresh. Still nothing.

The Wi-Fi router blinked once. Slowly. Judgingly.

Sam restarted the router, a ritual passed down through generations of frustrated humans. Lights went out. Lights came back on. Hope briefly returned.

“No internet.”

At this point, Sam began negotiating.

“Listen,” Sam whispered to the router, “I only need you for like… five minutes.”

The router blinked again.

Sam tried everything. Turned Wi-Fi off and on. Restarted the computer. Restarted the phone. Restarted *emotionally*. Still nothing.

Then, suddenly, the Wi-Fi connected.

Sam gasped. “Yes! Thank you!”

Immediately, the browser froze.

The Wi-Fi disconnected again.

Sam stared at the router. The router stared back, blinking calmly like a cat knocking a glass off the table.

“Oh,” Sam said quietly. “You’re playing games now.”

Sam googled “why is my internet slow” using mobile data, which felt illegal. Every result said the same thing: *restart your router.*

“I DID,” Sam yelled at no one.

Just then, the Wi-Fi connected again. Full bars. Lightning fast.

Sam clicked on an important page.

Disconnected.

That’s when Sam realized the truth.

The Wi-Fi wasn’t broken.

It was bored.

Sam leaned back in the chair. “Alright. You win. I’ll stop working.”

Instantly, the Wi-Fi reconnected. Stronger than ever.

Sam opened a video. Perfect playback. No buffering. The router blinked proudly.

That night, Sam learned an important lesson:

The Wi-Fi always knows when you’re trying to be productive.

And it will never, ever allow it.",1,1766949553.0,TheIndianRepublic,0,1.0,False

Good morning, my love. I’m sorry about the messages from yesterday. You don’t have to read my pain, and I don’t want to make you feel bad. I just want to say something I didn’t say before: there is a beautiful house in our neighborhood with good views, with two bedrooms, a very large living room, an even bigger kitchen, a pantry, a terrace, and much more, for $1000 a month. I’m also in a better financial situation now.

I would be willing to go to therapy and do whatever you need to help you feel safe. I would leave tomorrow to live with you and start over from zero. Think about it—maybe everything could start with a coffee. I love you.",1,1766949454.0,toxicmasculinity,1,1.0,False

The manager of this place graduated high school this year, and has no prior experience working at a coffee shop. It’s a hot mess, there’s no leadership, lack of communication, you can tell she doesn’t know how to run the place when it gets semi-busy. But what’s really bothering me is the fact she talks to me like I have noooo idea what I’m doing. Yes every place is different, but the basics are the same every where across the board. I don’t mind managers who are younger than me, but wouldn’t it be irritating working with/listening to someone trying to talk down to you who has never worked in the profession? 

For more context on how bad it is, she forgot about a customer at our drive thru because she was busy talking about her boyfriend to some customers up front. She struggles to do the basics like steam almond milk. My first time closing I was left alone with no instructions on protocol, how to close the drawer, etc. Same thing happened to another new hire. Thank god we both had prior experience so we could just wing everything. It’s just so incredibly frustrating having someone like that be your boss.

I live in a very small town in the south. And we decided today to go to Waffle House for Sunday breakfast.

It was busy so my daughter, husband and I took a seat at the front of the restaurant to wait for a table. A man walks in and I immediately feel super uncomfortable, as he was super strange.

He was older, early 70’s I’d guess and he was wearing a full black suit and tie without a single wrinkle. He had a large black suitcase that he wheeled in with him. He had thick blue tattooed eyebrows that went all the way past his temples, and he had a John F Kennedy pin on his suit jacket. He also was wearing thick black gloves that had a Velcro strap and silk scarves tied to each wrist.

As soon as he walked in he took notice to us and started talking to my husband about his tattoos. He also started asking very personal questions about where we lived and what he did for work. Luckily we got sat at our table and he was sat at the breakfast bar. Throughout our meal we saw him chatting with everyone at the bar and making people visibly uncomfortable. He never took his gloves off for the entire meal.

We are local to this place so the hostess we always see came up to chat, and she told us to make sure we hold onto our daughter when we leave because there’s a weird guy making people uneasy.

He finished his food around the same time as us but decided he wasn’t leaving. He sat at the front again with a cup of coffee and stared us down. When my husband got up to pay at the front, he immediately came over to me and started staring at my chest, asking if I actually liked the band Def Leopard (I was wearing a DL shirt) and then he proceeds to ask me if I was wearing something underneath and if it was comfortable. The weirdest part about it was that he called me by my name, which I never gave.

My husband ran back to us after seeing this all go down from the register and grabbed my daughter and we peeled out of there quickly. Next time we go I’ll get an update from the hostess about what happened when we left.",7,1766949264.0,creepyencounters,0,0.82,False
1pxzoss,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pxzoss/i_may_be_followed_by_the_ghost_from_my_job_part_1/,I May Be Followed by the Ghost From My Job (Part 1/?),"I may be followed by the ghost from my job. I work for a cleaning service. One that most people don't apply for. We do all types of big cleaning jobs such as sewer pipes bursting, biohazard spills, hoarder houses, etc. But I'm mostly assigned the real dirty work, the kind most people can't stomach. Sure most cleaners get used to the smell of human excrements and dangerous chemicals, but most can't stand the horrific site that is the aftermath of a crime scene. In the 10 years since I have started this job, I've never really much seen anyone come and go. It's not like we are never short staffed, but it's been the same faces for the past decade. It's one of the best paying jobs in town actually, yet only few out of thousands rarely work it. Why I say this is because of late, I feel like we are understaffed at the moment.

Now with my job, it's never easy. The bulk of my work most of my career has been murder scenes and suicide messes. This town is known for its high murder/suicide rate and bizarre events, so work is pretty steady. But lately, these last couple months have been overly exhausting on a physical and mental state. Lots of people seem to be losing their minds. It's either a double murder this week, or someone blows their brains out with a shotgun in a McDonalds the next week. Why do I feel like there's some kind of pattern to it all and I'm the only one around who realizes it.

I'm only just a laborer. My mind set is, get in, get the job done, get out. My grandmother always said blood is like wine, very hard to get out of the carpet. She wasn't lying. But as I said, I'm only just a laborer and I have always had a knack for deep cleaning, especially with thick and very stainable liquid substances, such as blood. Sometimes I work alone, most of the time I'm partnered up with Anthony Wellers, but he prefers Tony, or ""Tone"" as he tells people. He's the one that takes the job a little too seriously. Thinks he's some Dexter Morgan guru and will attempt to explain in full detail what happened or how he says, ""how it went *doooowwwwn*..."", the word down played off in a spooky fashion. I try my best to tune him out.

As I stated at the beginning, I may have a ghost problem. In the 10 years that I have been doing this, not once had I ever came across anything paranormal. Tone, he likes to say that he's heard things or seen stuff on his solo jobs, but never myself. You would think living in this town and doing the job I do, you would have at least had one ghastly experience. There was that one time when I was a small boy, I faintly remember possibly seeing the notorious 'black coated man', but it may have been my imagination getting the best of me.

So a few weeks back, strange things started happening around me at my assignments. Nothing too major, at first. It started with sounds. A knock here, a creek there. Then the experiences started to escalate as the days came. Things would start moving on their own. I distinctly remember, I was down on one knee, I had placed a spray bottle next to me on the ground, went to grab for it and it was gone. It just somehow grew feet and arms and climbed up on the coffee table behind me. As I snatched it up, I definitely heard a mans voice whisper, ""why"" into my ear. I jolted and looked around. The shiver made my entire spine and legs tremble like an earthquake for a few seconds.

Had a solo job where a woman had slit her wrist in her kitchen, never got the details as to why. The apartment complex hired our services for a rush order. The kitchen was a small space but she had left a terrible mess. She must have done what she did while standing at first, and it sprayed everywhere. On the hanging cabinets, the fridge, sink, ceiling, yeah, it was everywhere. As I toiled away at my cleaning, one ear bud in my left ear, listening to some alternate rock, I would catch faint whimpers randomly from my open right ear. As if someone, a woman, was right next to me, crying. Ignoring these sounds, I finished up my work and as I went to collect my things in the living room, I heard as if the wet slapping of feet were stepping around back on the kitchen linoleum flooring. I went back to check, and I shit you not, there was a trail of bloody footprints left over from the sink area coming back towards the threshold where I stood to go into the living room. As much as I wanted to scurry out of there, I had to finish the job. From that night on, my slumber periods have not been that well. I rarely get any peaceful sleep. I get abruptly awoken sometimes by the whispers of ""Why?"" in my ear. Always a different voice, some sounding angry and some in a dreaded despair of confusion. Like as if they're lying in bed next to me.

This last assignment I went to is why I write this down today, it was a murder scene. Rumors are going around its another serial killer. The victims were a couple living together in a small house on the rough side of town near the city limits. The 'ghetto side' as Tone puts it. ""You know it's gonna be a good one when we gotta go over to the West *Siiiiiiiiide*."" There isn't enough ear wax in the world to block him out. There's been a running of murdered 'couples'. The cops and detectives did all that they could and gave us the call for the 'OK' to start our clean up. It was going to be a long ride over. ""Jeez, we've been real busy lately huh?"" Tone blatantly asked. ""Yeah I guess"", I answered him. ""Haven't heard of a body count of this magnitude in such little time since the Riot of '98."", he continued. ""Was still a kid when that happened, but my uncle said he was there to see the tail end of it, nothing short of pretty."" As much I enjoyed conversing with my coworker, he's not the type I would find myself hanging out with. I don't ever see us going for after-shift beers and diving into deep conspiracy theories of our work or sharing untold secrets with one another, but I had to ask him, ""So, have you been experiencing anything lately? You know, hearing shit or whatnot at the jobs?"" He looked over at me with wide eyed astonishment, like a child finding out your into the same hobbies as he is, thank goodness I was driving the van. ""No, but why you ask? You been seeing shit?!"", he asked with a tasteless grin on his face. ""Yeah. You didn't hear any voices on that last job we did?""

I was referrring to the McDonald's incident. A man had come in, dressed too relaxed with only a bath robe and basketball shorts on, carrying a twelve gauge shotgun. Witnesses say he screamed out some nonsensical jibberish as they ducked down under the tables thinking he was there to do them harm, and as quickly as he was done speaking, he took the front of the barrel to his chin, and pulled the trigger. Tone and myself were assigned  there to soak up the massive pool of crimson left on the floor and to pick out the brain matter from the ceiling above. Tone had lost at rock, paper, scissors to see who was going to be on brain matter duty and would be up on the ladder most of the night. As Tone did his work up on the ladder, I was doing my part with the floor and would keep hearing clicks and beeps coming from the kitchen equipment that kept me on edge. The sounds for some reason would reverberate intensely, piercing in my eardrums, like my own personal volume was turned up to the max. Suddenly, the faint whimpering again. This time more manly. Then out of the corner of my eye, I swear I saw a shadowy figure in the back for a split second. I turned to look, and then heard ""WHY?!!"" echo from the kitchen area. I looked up at Tone to see if he had noticed, but to my amazement, he wasn't fazed at all. He was still working atop the ladder like he had heard nothing. He was just mumbling to himself. I was too afraid to say anything as I turned back to look at the kitchen. Nothing else for the rest of the time we were there.

""No. I didn't hear a damn thing. You saying you heard something?"", he asked raising a single eyebrow. I had given him the details of what I had saw and heard that night and still he shook his head in doubt. ""Maybe the job is finally getting to yah huh? Going crazy on me now are yah?"" ""No."", I answered with no hesitation, ""I've been doing this job for years now. Wouldn't you think this is something that should've been happening to me far back in the beginning?"" ""You have a point."", Tone replied. The rest of our ride over was quiet, just vibing out to the radio music. We arrived to the address where an officer was awaiting us. He handed me the keys to the house and asked us to make sure to lock up before leaving. ""Take as much time as you need boys, this place wont be up for market sale anytime soon. You may have to pull the rug."" ""Thanks officer."", I had said. It was a small house, run down. Junk in the front yard. We were definitely on the outskirts of town. Don't even know if we are beyond the city limits. The house nestled right against the woods. Nothing but thick endless forest as its backyard. No wonder it took so long for the bodies to be discovered. News said they had been dead for two weeks before the wife's mother came over after so many phone call attempts. The husband was found in the kitchen with his caved in to a pulp. The wife got the worst apparently. There wasn't much details given to reporters from the police on what completely happened with her. So you got to figure it was probably pretty bad.

As I scoped the outside of the house up and down, I found myself feeling queasy for some reason, as if my body wanted to start floating in the air. That uncontrollable numbness that floods your body like you know you're about to black out. It only happened for a mere second, I didn't think much of it at first. We got inside and started to check everything out. Tone had gone in first and I had followed right behind him. The officer was right, we are going to have to pull the rug. The living rooms floor was a white, or what used to be white, shag rugging. The stain covered most of it. If he was found in the kitchen, the next room over, then she would've been found in here I assumed. I watched as Tone went into the kitchen to peer over the mess in there, ""Yup, gonna need the jet sprayer for in here."", he said. I turn back over to the site in the living room, as my eyes moved forward to the back wall, the blood continued upwards, and then I saw the two holes punched in the wood paneling. In a flash I saw her, like she was crucified to the wall, dressed in a small white sleeping gown, her body was cut to shreds, the blood poured out like a fountain of absolute horror. She was sobbing, crying out in a low whimper, ""why?"". I snapped back, hit with that dizziness of deja vu. My mouth goes dry and the queasyness comes back again, I almost pass out catching myself before I hit the ground. ""Whoa, partner! You OK?!"", I can faintly hear the words coming from Tone. I do my best to focus. And then instantly, the sensation leaves me, like it evaporated from my body. I begin to feel my legs again and can now clearly hear, ""YO! You OK bro?!"". I flinched from the loudness of his voice and assured him I was fine and we began our work. I thought it best not to say anything about what I just experienced. I said it was just a lack of eating on my part. When he was convinced, we did our normal routine of who does what. Rock, paper, scissors was not in my favor this time as I was stuck with rug pulling duty.

It took us another two days to finish up the work at that house. Nothing else had happened to me and Tone never came forward about anything. Knowing him, he would for sure say something. He is one for attention. The second day of cleaning, I had pulled most the rug the night before and had moved on to the wall with the two holes. Tone had gone into his Dexter mode. Stretching his arms out front and making the L's with his hands, he proclaimed, ""I don't need any reports or photos to tell yah what happened here."" He closed one eyeball and squinted the other while hanging his tongue out like he was in deep thought. I rolled my eyes so hard it actually hurt resulting in me rubbing them. I could feel a headache coming on. ""She was definitely strung up. Crucifix style."" I looked back up in bewilderment. ""How do you figure that Sherlock?"", I ask bluntly. ""Well if you see the two holes there, they each got trails that seem to flow down and at the length their spread apart, I would have to assume it's the distance between both arms being stretched out. Most likely her hands."" ""Genius"", I applauded him with the very sarcastic Men at Work golf clap. He was wrong on one thing, she was bolted up at the wrist. ""Alright man, enough of your shenanagins, let me get back to this, I gotta fill these holes in today so I can sand them later."" On the third night though, is when my hauntings really started to get intense for me.

I was home trying to get some sleep. Trying not to think about what I had saw at that house. But my dreams didn't let me forget. I dreamt of what happened there I think. It was so vivid. It felt so real. I found myself in the corner of the living room. Unable to move a muscle. Like I was stuck in time. The wife was lain stomach down on the shag rug, bound together by zip ties with her hands behind her back and feet prompted up. She had a dirty, greased up bandana wrapped around her mouth. I could hear her struggle to speak and scream as the sounds of heavy pounding came from the next room. Suddenly a sledge hammer was hurled in from the hallway bouncing off the wall next me then landing next to the woman. It was coated in blood. A dark figure emerged in the doorway from the hall leading to the kitchen. I couldn't see his face or make out his body. It was like he was a third dimensional shadow. Just all black. I could make out his clothing, a baseball cap and hoodie. He slowly walked towards the woman on the floor, she tried effortlessly to shake around and yell out as loud as she could, but the muffling of the rag in her mouth did little for her. The house was pretty much out in the middle of nowhere and the nearest neighbors were half a mile in both directions. No one was hearing her. The shadowy figure had then turned her around to face him and he grabbed at her throat with one hand, tormenting her with the fact that he had dominion of her now. Then he just stops. She stops. Silence fills the room, then the shadowy figure turns his head up to look directly at me, like he just now notices I'm there, stuck in the corner, watching beyond my control. I could hear the muscles in his arms and legs snap and crunch as he rises up to stand. His head bobs sideways like a dog hearing a peculiar sound for the first time as if he's staring at me with childish curiosity. He then rushes at me, grabbing at my throat. I see his burning yellow eyes, then I wake up drenched in freezing sweat. My bed was soaked over like I had pissed in it. It may have been a mix of both not going to lie.

That was two nights ago and last night has to be the worst for me right now. I dreamt of what may have happened at the solo job I had talked about before. The woman who had slit in her wrist in her kitchen. It wasn't as vivid as the first dream, but all I remember is this. I was stuck again, but his time where I stood when I saw the footprints. The entrance to the small apartment kitchen. She stood at the opposite side of the room, at the sink area, one hand clasped around her face, the other dangling down holding a knife. She was crying, tears dripping from between her fingers. ""W..why?"", I hear like an echo in a hollow cave, ""why me?"" ""SHUT UP! DO IT!"", a second voice screeched out from nowhere. She then quickly turned around to face me and with precision, slashes down on her left arm grabbing the knife with her opposing hand and proceeds to swiftly slash the other, dropping the blade and shifting her arms out so the red went spraying everywhere like a water show. That last moment happened as if time was moving at a slow pace. She was making eye contact with me. Her expression told as if she was in a state of pure relief. Like she was letting go. I could feel the hot drips hit the skin of my face. I could smell the iron in the air. Then I awoke in cold sweat again. My mouth was dryer than a desert. I go to my own kitchen to get a drink of from the fridge, and there they were. Footprints of blood. Starting from the sink and ending where my kitchen floor meets my living room carpet.

I don't know what's going on with me or what to do about it and who to talk to about it but any advice would be helpful. I will update soon if anything else wild happens with me, but for now, I will be staying at a hotel for a couple days and see if its just my place or its me.

(advice needed)","I (30F) am 4 months into 7 months of travelling. Before I was in Cuba, Italy and Spain. I had an amazing time, felt so good, met loads of friends etc. 

I've been travelling in Colombia for a month. I've been to: Cartagena, Santa Marta, Sierra Nevada, Palomino, Minca, Bogota, Medellin and Jardin. 

When I first arrived I had food poisoning and heat exhaustion and it took me about 2 weeks to feel fully better. Then last week I got a flu on my way to Medellin and was sick for a few days. I haven't quite had the energy for social hostels and have had to isolate in airbnbs and hotels to get better in private. Had a few issues with terrible hostels that meant I had to leave too. 

I'm aware that due to health issues, I haven't met so many people that I connect with which has made me feel more lonely- and I am a super social person. But at the same time, Colombia hasn't given me a new experience compared to other places I've travelled to in central America and SE Asia.  I've struggled with the issues with safety, too. I've met so many travellers who have been drugged and robbed and I feel like every time I've been out I've had to constantly think about my safety. Now I'm in Jardin, I feel a bit safer, but unsure how safe it is to hike around by myself.

Over the last week, I've become more and more disillusioned with staying here. I feel really unbothered about seeing the sights, which sounds a bit like the travel fatigue people have talked about. I am totally aware that health issues haven't put me in the best position to enjoy this beautiful country, although I have met a few other traveller that have felt similarly to me about Colombia. 

I intended on staying in S. America for the next 3 months, but now I feel like I would like something different, as the pueblos and landscapes don't feel so different to what I experienced on my 2019 central America trip. I'm thinking of going to Peru for a month and then changing it up and going to Japan until April. I have a friend in Lima and a friend going to Japan for a couple of weeks in March. 

  
I'm wondering if starting brand new, in a new country, now I'm feeling better, will get me out of this feeling. Or if I'll likely feel the same way. Lately, I've struggled with feeling like I don't have purpose since the first 3 months of travel felt like a novelty to not be at work. Going home to the UK doesn't feel like a possibility, as I am subletting my room until the end of March and its also Jan/Feb which is awful and dark. I'll probably kick myself if I went home during winter. 

Good travel to me looks like: Somewhere new and different, new friendships and new experiences

I would really love some advice or an outside perspective, especially if you've gone somewhere new after feeling travel fatigue. 

1. Should I spend a couple of weeks exploring the coffee region and then Cali and then go to Peru, then Japan

2. Cut my losses and go to Peru now

3. Go to South Korea and then Japan now for somewhere completely different

3.  Go home (please no lol)

I'm still new and so I'm trying to build partner relationships. Meeting agents for coffee or lunch and following up with them every week to keep me top of mind. I'm going to brokerages to see if I can teach classes as well as increasing the size of my sphere through other means.

I can't say I'm particularly enjoying this part of it. But, if I'm consistent about my lead generating activities I believe business will pick up. Assuming it will...and I'm closing double digit loans a month eventually. I'm trying to figure out once I'm in that situation if I'll be happier and have more job satisfaction or just really enjoy what I'm doing.

If you're in that situation now where you're closing double digit loans and a lot of income coming in...are you happy? Or does closing more loans make you so busy that your miserable or at least not really enjoying life?

This is honestly a question geared more towards LOs working at a broker shop vs retail.

For context I am with a brokerage and I work from home and I'm entirely self gen and I can basically choose how many bps I want to take since my brokerage doesn't take a split and we're correspondent with 4 different lenders.",2,1766949084.0,loanoriginators,4,1.0,False

There’s One Call I Was Told to Forget.,"I worked as a 911 dispatcher for seven years. Most people think that job is nonstop screaming and chaos. It’s not. Most calls are boring. Arguments. Drunks. False alarms. That’s why this one still bothers me. Because it was calm. Too calm. It was around 2:17 a.m. on a Tuesday. Graveyard shift. Half-asleep coworkers, cold coffee, buzzing fluorescent lights. The call came in with no caller ID. That happens sometimes. I answered like I always did. “911, what’s your emergency?” There was breathing on the other end. Slow. Controlled. Like someone trying to stay calm. Then a man said, “I think someone is in my house.” Standard call. I pulled up the address. “Sir, are you somewhere safe right now?” “Yes,” he said. “I’m in my bedroom. The door’s locked.” I could hear it then—soft footsteps in the background. Bare feet on carpet. “Okay,” I said. “I’m dispatching officers now. Can you tell me where you are in the house?” He gave me his address. That’s when I froze. Because the address already had a call attached to it. From eight minutes earlier. Same address. Same phone line. I scrolled back. The first call was still open. No resolution. No officers dispatched. The notes just said: Caller reports someone in home. Whispering heard. Call disconnected. My throat went dry. “Sir,” I said carefully, “did you call us earlier tonight?” “No,” he said. “This is my first time calling.” Another sound came through the line. A soft tapping. Like fingernails on wood. “Sir,” I asked, “is anyone else in the house with you?” There was a pause. Long enough that I thought the call dropped. Then he whispered, “I live alone.” The tapping stopped. And then—a voice. Not his. Right into the phone. “Stop telling him that.” I pulled my headset off instinctively, like that would help. When I put it back on, the man was breathing hard. “Did you hear that?” he whispered. “Yes,” I said. “I did.” My screen refreshed. The original call from eight minutes earlier updated on its own. Caller still on line. Breathing detected. “Sir,” I said slowly, “I need you to listen to me very carefully. Are you absolutely sure you’re alone in that room?” “I locked the door,” he said. “I can hear it outside.” “It?” I asked. Something scraped against the phone speaker. Like lips brushing the mic. Then the other voice spoke again. Calm. Close. “He’s lying to you.” The line went dead. I dispatched officers immediately. They arrived in under four minutes. The house was empty. No signs of forced entry. No footprints. No hidden rooms. Just one thing. On the bedroom door. From the inside. Five deep gouges in the wood. Like someone had been clawing their way out. The man was never found. But the call logs still exist. Two calls. Same number. Same time. One of them is still marked active. And sometimes, when the call center is quiet, my headset clicks on by itself. And I can hear breathing.",1,1766949080.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

There’s One Call I Was Told to Forget.,"I worked as a 911 dispatcher for seven years. Most people think that job is nonstop screaming and chaos. It’s not. Most calls are boring. Arguments. Drunks. False alarms. That’s why this one still bothers me. Because it was calm. Too calm. It was around 2:17 a.m. on a Tuesday. Graveyard shift. Half-asleep coworkers, cold coffee, buzzing fluorescent lights. The call came in with no caller ID. That happens sometimes. I answered like I always did. “911, what’s your emergency?” There was breathing on the other end. Slow. Controlled. Like someone trying to stay calm. Then a man said, “I think someone is in my house.” Standard call. I pulled up the address. “Sir, are you somewhere safe right now?” “Yes,” he said. “I’m in my bedroom. The door’s locked.” I could hear it then—soft footsteps in the background. Bare feet on carpet. “Okay,” I said. “I’m dispatching officers now. Can you tell me where you are in the house?” He gave me his address. That’s when I froze. Because the address already had a call attached to it. From eight minutes earlier. Same address. Same phone line. I scrolled back. The first call was still open. No resolution. No officers dispatched. The notes just said: Caller reports someone in home. Whispering heard. Call disconnected. My throat went dry. “Sir,” I said carefully, “did you call us earlier tonight?” “No,” he said. “This is my first time calling.” Another sound came through the line. A soft tapping. Like fingernails on wood. “Sir,” I asked, “is anyone else in the house with you?” There was a pause. Long enough that I thought the call dropped. Then he whispered, “I live alone.” The tapping stopped. And then—a voice. Not his. Right into the phone. “Stop telling him that.” I pulled my headset off instinctively, like that would help. When I put it back on, the man was breathing hard. “Did you hear that?” he whispered. “Yes,” I said. “I did.” My screen refreshed. The original call from eight minutes earlier updated on its own. Caller still on line. Breathing detected. “Sir,” I said slowly, “I need you to listen to me very carefully. Are you absolutely sure you’re alone in that room?” “I locked the door,” he said. “I can hear it outside.” “It?” I asked. Something scraped against the phone speaker. Like lips brushing the mic. Then the other voice spoke again. Calm. Close. “He’s lying to you.” The line went dead. I dispatched officers immediately. They arrived in under four minutes. The house was empty. No signs of forced entry. No footprints. No hidden rooms. Just one thing. On the bedroom door. From the inside. Five deep gouges in the wood. Like someone had been clawing their way out. The man was never found. But the call logs still exist. Two calls. Same number. Same time. One of them is still marked active. And sometimes, when the call center is quiet, my headset clicks on by itself. And I can hear breathing.",4,1766949042.0,creepypasta,2,1.0,False

Proceed with caution.

I’m going to be honest, I’m a total walking contradiction.

I’m the guy who can sit with you at 3 AM having the deepest philosophical talk about the universe, but 5 minutes later I’ll be cracking jokes with what my friends call **""chaotic confidence""** just to make you laugh. I have this ""old soul"" vibe, but I’m just as chaotic when the mood hits.

Right now, I’m 19, a CS student, and running on a serious **""startup founder""** mindset. I’ve been planning my venture since 2022 (I even taught myself to code 4-5 months ago just to build it), and I’m aiming for something massive in the AI space.

**But don't get me wrong, I’m still figuring life out like everyone else. I just take my dreams (and my feelings) seriously.**

Honestly, I'm tired of doing this alone. I want someone to share the lore, the struggle, and the quiet moments with *right now*. I know I talk a lot about my ambitions, but I promise to be the biggest fan of yours too.

I also have some **stats** you should probably know about.

First, I have a secret **""better than cafe recipe""** where I make the best hot and cold coffee you’ll ever have.

Second, I genuinely love cooking (if I don't know your culture’s cuisine, I will **learn to cook it from scratch** just to surprise you).

And third, I love traveling. I have this dream of traveling the world in the future, not just us, but eventually with our families together too. I want that big, chaotic, happy energy.

Physically, I see the world in cinematic shots (photographer brain), so I tend to romanticize the little things. I have that **""Intellectual Streetwear""** aesthetic: deep brown eyes, glasses, and a **sharp jawline** (I actually take skincare seriously lol).

Body-wise, I’m **skinny-athletic (172cm)** right now, but I’m actually starting my villain arc (aka joining the gym) on **Jan 6th**. I have a specific physique goal in mind, so you’d be meeting me right at the start of the transformation. I also have a unique **fire-shaped mark** on my body (guess where) that’s honestly just a really cool detail.

I also have a private Instagram archive which I started 5-6 months ago full of thoughts and moments I've saved specifically for ""the one.""

I’ll be real about what I’m looking for. I tend to be really drawn to that **sharp, defined look** (whether you're skinny, curvy, or athletic). Whether you’re smiling or serious, there is just something about a defined jawline, a nice nose, or those striking **""siren"" eyes** that instantly catches my attention.

The only hard dealbreaker is that I don't smoke or vape. I don't drink personally, but it's not a dealbreaker if you do, I just need someone who keeps it clean enough so we can actually live long enough to enjoy the life we build.

Most importantly, I date with the **intention of a serious, forever commitment**. I don't mean I want to rush everything, but there has to be a vision we are chasing together.

Honestly, the fact that people can date, travel, share secrets, and get intimate for years and *still* break up literally scares the sh*t out of me. I don't want that. I want the ""forever"" kind of love. Loyalty is everything to me, so Long Distance isn't an issue.

**If this is your first time trying to find love online, don't worry, I plan on making it your last.**

To prove you actually read this far, tell me which **vibe** you want us to have (just DM me the number):

1. **Protective:** I want to ""hate"" you like **Eren hated Mikasa**. (Translation: I would burn the world down just to keep you safe). 🧣
2. **Cinematic:** You be the **Max to my Lucas**, and I promise to never let the music stop when things get heavy. 🎧
3. **Best Friends:** We act like the main characters who scare everyone else, but actually we’re just two dorks getting coffee.
4. **Chaotic:** You walk into the room, and I whisper, *""Guess what I’m wearing? The smile you just gave me.""* (Cheesy? Yes. Will it work? Also yes).

If you liked my vibe, stop overthinking.
Send me a DM and tell me: **What is the one place in the world you've always wanted to visit?**

*(P.S. If you want to know the vibe I’m looking for, go listen to ""Her"" by JVKE).*

1pxzfgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1pxzfgh/seeking_advice_on_reactive_8_yo_mini_aussie/,Seeking advice on reactive 8 yo mini Aussie.,"Hi everyone - As the title states, we are seeking advice on our older ""mini"" Australian Shepard. Please note, we will also be seeking the council of a behavioral specialist, but also want to ask other folks. Reddit will NOT be fully replacing the behavioral specialist, though.

Context: Our boy spent the first three or so years of his life living outside 99% of the time, by himself, in an fenced ""crate"" (think something 8' x 5' roughly). My mom's late ex husband bought him for her, but decided he never wanted him in the house. My mom did her best (daily forest walks, etc.) while navigating a bad marriage, but he was never socialized. My mom is very much his PERSON. When she finally left, maybe when the dog was between 3-4, we were able to start training him and socializing him.

Training has been a lot of work, but he improved greatly with the help of my husband and I--mostly with listening to us and recall, but not when it comes to other people and/or dogs. We all live together in a large house now, and while he is pretty obsessed with my husband and I, he is still first and foremost obsessed with my mom.

Here is the issue: Over the past year, we moved into this new multi-generational house and he had a major surgery. While he was territorial and reactive before, he is even more so now. The surgery was \~4 months ago now, so we anticipate some of his behavior might be increased movement after a long rest period, but there has to be something else going on.. 

He barks at all guests and all other dogs while on a walk. He growls at guests, and if they are sitting, tries to ""dominate"" them by putting his paws on their chest. He tries to herd people. He freaks the f\*\*\* out if another dog tries to say hi to my mom. He has a few doggy friends, but is generally a bit of a dickhead to other dogs. He whines incessantly if my mom, husband, or I leave. I just took him on a ride to the coffee shop drive through and he barked at everyone passing by... loudly, not listening to me. And the worst incident? We recently had a small party at our house, and while a friend of ours was going upstairs, our dog bit him. He didn't draw blood, but did brush his skin. We are lucky our friend was not hurt and was very cool about it, but this isn't okay and we haven't brought people over since. 

We love him deeply, but need to start taking more action to correct his behavior. We don't want to put him down, but his basic training isn't cutting it with the aggression and reactivity. Like I said before, we will be hiring a behavioral specialist, but in the meantime... does anyone have any advice for us? 

Thank you in advance for reading this long post and any advice given. ",1,1766948615.0,DogAdvice,0,1.0,False

Any recommendations?,"Met her through Bumble and we ‘clicked’ (To be honest don’t know if we did as this is the first time I ever am trying to get into a relationship as I never had one in my WHOLE Fing LIFE). We chatted via text first then eventually we meet up at a coffee shop twice to get together in person. During the first get together and before I asked to meet up for the second time, I asked if she did enjoyed her time meeting with me and she said she did. She moved back to her home country for a while and we then continued to talk via chat. I haven’t mentioned it to her but I do check up on her timezone to see when is it the right time to text/reply first so that I won’t be a bother. As this has been going on for two month and counting, I have noticed she is not doing the same thing as well as she is not initiating the conversation. This is something not new as she was doing this before she left for her home country and the only reason why I haven’t given up yet is because she told me she was interested in me in person. Any advice on what to do as I am currently on verge on giving up and accepting that no one really wants me as all my previous courtship phase conversations with others involves me initiating and trying to stoke the fire of conversation.

The cause was 100% having low vitamin D, hour long walks in the sun and supplements have been huge. 

But as costo is, the stress evolves over time, my anxiety been acting real wacky lately. Doing anything in the gym has been helping with this. The treadmill and stair stepper still gives me flair ups, but so far the gym bike hasn’t (prob because I’m sitting down). Can do some leg works out and physical therapy stretches. I’m going to get tested to see if I have low testosterone. I really really don’t want to take anti depressants. I bet it does help but I’ve heard too many horror stories from my friends. 

Overall I am making progress on getting better but I def have a long way to go. I do get flair ups still but they aren’t too bad right now. Back pod has been huge, I’ve been using it on the spine and on the sides of the spine where the rip joints are. I do this 4 times a day. I was targeting my upper back but I’ve noticed that I do need to stretch some rip joints below my shoulder blades (was getting arm numbness when targeting lower areas). Chiropractor with cold laser and the recommended YouTube massages twice a week been huge too. 

I never really drank coffee but I love whiskey. Had a bad flair up after a bachelor party and I’ve swore off it till I get better (only like two weeks into this). I’ve seen some conflicting posts that high sugar may or may not mess with costo. Im going try to limit my sugar to just granola and apples but we will see.

This is 100% the most committed I’ve been to getting better. One day I’m gonna post that I beat this.

1. Chen's beef noodles house (Kreuzberg)

This place was so good that i went twice. They make hand-pulled noodles, which are super chewy and fresh, and the noodles come with unlimited refills. I highly recommend the beef noodle soup (menu no.9) and the chicken noodles (no.12).

2. Youngheene

If u want Korean street food, this is the place! The tteokbokki was amazing, and the tuna gimbap was huge and really good. I wanted to order the corn dogs (which i missed for a long time), but i was already way too full 🥲 they also sell bungeoppang (붕어빵) in winter - the two of us ordered four and finished them easily. Higly recommended.

3. Hou Tang Hotpot

A Chinese hot pot restaurant. It's on the pricer side, but the ingredients are fresh and everything tasted great. The atmosphere is perfect for year-end gatherings, and i'd definitely go back to the next time i'm in Berlin.

4. Monsieur Vuong

A Vietnamese pho place that already seems pretty well know. We waited about five minutes before getting a table. You can choose between a small or large portion. I recommend the large one.

A little about me:

• I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 4 years now.
• I live alone, take care of myself, but also never say no to dessert.
• I’d be happy to host or come to you, whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
• I love being outside, especially in the summer… picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace… simple things, really.
• Traveling is a big part of my life and dream. I’d love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
• I’m a good listener. My friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You’ll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that’s what you need 🤗
• Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me. I value both deeply.
• I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I’m looking for:

Someone to share gentle and genuine connection with. Whether that’s cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I’m also open to making new friends… movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby… whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you’d prefer to meet in a public space first, that’s absolutely fine. Your comfort always comes first.

So if you’re someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh. I’d really love to hear from you. 💛

I use Hinge myself and have also looked through a lot of friends’ profiles over the past year because they kept asking why things felt stuck. This post is just me noticing patterns that kept repeating, not advice I pulled from a blog.

Not asking for feedback on my own profile, just sharing observations I kept seeing and curious if others relate. 

I’ve ended up seeing a lot of Hinge profiles lately, mostly through friends and people asking why things feel stuck. After a while, you start noticing that the issue is rarely effort. It’s usually that people are optimizing for the wrong thing without realizing it.

Most people think a Hinge profile’s job is to describe them accurately. Subconsciously, I think they’re trying to prevent being misunderstood. So prompts become explanations, values statements, or summaries of who they are as a person.

For example, I see some version of this constantly:

“The hallmark of a good relationship is communication, trust, and honesty.”

From the inside, this feels mature and emotionally healthy. From the outside, it’s just abstract. It doesn’t tell me what interacting with you would feel like.

A small shift that works better is turning values into behavior:

“I’m pretty direct. If something’s off, I’ll say it, and I appreciate the same energy back.”

Same values. Now I can picture the dynamic.

Another one I see a lot:

“The one thing you should know about me is I’m ambitious and hardworking.”

People write this because they want to signal stability and drive. The issue is that ambition is assumed on Hinge. Saying it doesn’t differentiate you.

A version that landed much better for one person was:

“I’m the type who plans things properly, then immediately accepts the plan will probably change.”

That single line implied ambition, competence, and flexibility without naming any of them, and people actually responded to it.

Humor is another area where intention and impact don’t line up.

Something like:

“Typical Sunday: gym, groceries, existential dread.”

From the writer’s perspective, it feels relatable and funny. But it’s a closed loop. There’s nothing for the other person to step into.

We adjusted it to:

“Typical Sunday is gym, groceries, then convincing myself I deserve a coffee I didn’t plan for.”

Same tone, but now it invites agreement or a story back. Replies got longer almost immediately.

What people rarely realize is how much *order* matters.

Most profiles lead with their safest prompt because it feels logical to ease in. But the first prompt sets the frame for everything that follows. If it’s vague or jokey, the rest of the profile gets interpreted through that lens.

The structure that consistently works best looks something like this:

First prompt: answer “what is this person like to date” in one clear, grounded way. Not a joke. Not a list of values. Something that establishes how you show up.

Second prompt: add texture or mild polarity. A preference, a habit, a quirk that makes the right person lean in and the wrong person lean out.

Third prompt: make conversation easy. This is where humor works best. It should be effortless to reply to without trying to impress you.

When profiles struggle, it’s often because these are out of order. The clearest line is buried at the bottom. The joke comes first. The conversational prompt is trying to do all the work.

Photos follow the same principle.

One clear anchor photo where your face is obvious and relaxed. One context photo that shows lifestyle. One photo that adds social or activity credibility. Everything else is optional, and more often than not, one extra photo creates more confusion than value.

I’ve seen profiles improve just by removing a single photo that didn’t fit the story, even though it was a “good” photo on its own.

Another pattern I notice is how much people soften themselves to avoid turning anyone off. Preferences get watered down. Edges disappear. Everything becomes agreeable.

What’s interesting is that when someone adds one clear, grounding line that filters, matches might dip slightly, but conversations become easier and dates happen faster. The people it’s meant for recognize themselves in it.

Most people don’t do poorly on Hinge because they’re boring or awkward. They do poorly because their profile is optimized to be understood, not felt. It explains who they are instead of letting someone imagine what being with them would be like.

If you do well in person but the apps don’t reflect that, it’s usually not you. It’s the translation.",15,1766948019.0,dating_advice,15,0.86,False

The first was a young mother from Victorville. Her photo on the news looked like it had been taken on some family camping trip, the sun tangled in her hair, her smile slightly off center like she had been laughing when the picture was snapped. The second was a truck driver from Apple Valley, who used to stop by for coffee when he passed through town. I didn’t know him well, but I remembered his voice, raspy, like every word scraped its way out of a dry throat. The third was a retired mechanic from Hesperia, a quiet man I had served pies to a handful of times. He always smelled faintly of oil and hot metal, even after he washed his hands.

The articles were short, bare facts and vague warnings. Black text on white screens, names reduced to ages and locations. But my dreams filled in the rest. Not the way you would expect, no monsters, no faceless killers. Just strange, quiet details that clung to me after I woke.

In one, I was standing in a patch of desert at night, the wind cold and restless, tossing grit into my eyes until they burned. The air tasted like rust and sage. The young mother lay in the dirt, one shoe missing, her sock dark with blood. Her hair was stiff, matted close to her scalp, crackling faintly when the wind touched it. I reached down and felt something hard pressed into her palm. A flower. Dry, fragile, its edges sharp enough to bite my skin. In the morning, when I read her obituary, I told myself my brain had made that up.

Another night, I dreamed of the truck driver’s rig sitting abandoned on a frontage road. The engine ticked softly as it cooled, metal snapping in the silence. I opened the cab door and the smell of old coffee and diesel rolled out. He was there, eyes open but not seeing, his hands resting on the wheel like he had simply paused mid drive. Between his fingers was the same kind of flower, pale, dry, curling inward on itself like it was trying to hide. I shook myself awake, heart racing, sure it was just because I had read too much about him.

For the mechanic, I dreamed of a dark workshop, the air thick with dust and grease. Tools hung on the walls, faintly clinking as if something had just passed through. He was slumped in a chair, head tilted to the side, mouth open slightly. One arm hung loose, fingers stiff. In his palm, again, a desert rose, chalky and brittle. I told myself it was just my mind recycling the same image.

Still, the dreams made me worry for my customers. Folks were scared. You could hear it in the way they spoke, voices low, sentences trailing off. Nobody wanted to throw birthday parties or retirements or even graduations anymore. If people weren’t celebrating, they weren’t ordering cakes.

My bakery in Adelanto, California, was barely holding on. The air inside always smelled like sugar and warm butter, but lately there was an edge to it, something anxious, like the smell of overheated wiring. I dropped my prices, lowest in town. Not because I needed the money, my aunt had left me enough to keep the place alive. But because it felt like something I could do. Maybe if people had a reason to smile, it would keep the fear from settling too deep, from sinking into the walls.

The cops came in sometimes. Their radios crackled softly at their hips while they drank coffee that had gone lukewarm. I gave them free pastries, told them it was just good community service. Really, I wanted to hear whatever scraps of information they would let slip. One afternoon, while they were nursing their coffee, I asked if they were getting any closer to finding him. One of them said something about “those flowers,” then shut his mouth like he had just stepped off a cliff.

I leaned in, resting my palms on the counter, felt the cool laminate under my skin. I asked what flowers.

“Desert roses,” he muttered, eyes fixed on his cup. “Every one of them is found with one in their hand.”

The weird part was, I knew that already. It wasn’t in any article. I had only seen it in dreams. I told myself it was just a lucky guess, that maybe I had read it somewhere and forgotten. But the thought wouldn’t leave me alone. It sat behind my eyes, heavy and insistent.

The nights after that were worse. I would wake in the dark and swear I smelled dust in my sheets, a dry, bitter scent that didn’t belong inside. My mouth felt gritty, like I had been chewing sand. Once I found a few grains of it on my bedroom floor, clinging to my socks when I got up for water. I told myself it was from tracking it in during the day, but I couldn’t remember walking through any that week.

A week later, the man and his daughter came in.
The bell over the door gave its usual tired jingle. She looked about sixteen, shoulders hunched, keeping her gaze low like she was somewhere else entirely. He stood too close to her, filling the space with the smell of sweat and aftershave. He was looking for a cake with a specific kind of frosting I didn’t have. I told him I couldn’t do it in time for the date he wanted. The girl flinched, just a small movement, like she was bracing for a sound that never came. Something in me twisted, tight and sharp. I smiled and told him I could make it happen after all.

That night, my sleep came heavy and deep. No tossing, no teeth in the dark, just a single, vivid dream.

I saw him walking alone on the edge of a dirt service road, the sky the color of cooling ash. The wind smelled like rain hitting dust, sharp and electric. Someone was behind him, close enough that I could hear their breathing, slow and steady. He turned his head, and there was a dull, wet sound, like something heavy dropped into mud. His knees buckled. He fell forward into the dirt, his cheek pressing against the ground, mouth filling with grit. His hand twitched once, twice, then went still. Between his fingers, a brittle desert rose caught the moonlight, its shadow sharp against the earth.

When I woke, I felt good. Rested. Clear headed. My body felt light, like I had finally exhaled after holding my breath too long.

I lay in bed scrolling through my feed until I saw the headline. LATEST VICTIM IDENTIFIED.

It was the father. Same photo I remembered from the shop, his arm around the daughter, her smile stiff and forced. I stared at the screen until my thumb went numb, and for some reason, I suddenly remembered something from that day in the bakery, something I had pushed aside.
Before I had stepped away to check the frosting, he had muttered at her. Low, but sharp enough to cut. “You’re wasting my money. Could have just bought a damn boxed cake mix and had your mother make it.”

Her eyes had stayed fixed on the floor. She hadn’t blinked.

I don’t know why that memory came back then, but it settled into my chest like a stone, cold and heavy.

I pulled out my order book, found his number, and called. No answer. Just his voicemail greeting, cheerful and oblivious. I told him the cake was ready for pick up.

1pxz5dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pxz5dm/cuba_travel/,Cuba travel,"# Cuba travel notes Dec 2025

Hi All, maybe this post will help someone to prepare for Cuba travel. Was there in Dec 2025

1. I am from US so we have travel restrictions, so I went on Support of Cuban people program. Very beautiful, but for the same time poverty everywhere, was there for 9 days. Not many tourist's was able to go to all places without lines.
2. Havana is place to see, my suggestions buy traveler book, and look there before you go, many places are not in walking distance, and a tour guy may not mention it. Be aware that ""hours of business"" needs to be checked before you go, because they could be closed, ask you receptionist to check it for you. Loved ballet, Museum of contemporary arts, and Factory of art 20 min from Old Havana ( very cool place, art+music+dance performances+ bars and food), there are many places to see. Museums are $2-$3 entry fees.
3. Download Spanish on your google translate app, it works off line and very helpful. I am not Spanish speaker, so I was just typing what I needed there and was ok.
4. Also download google maps offline, very helpful tool. I was using it for "" you parked there"" for our casa( where we lived) to find my way back when we walked around. Ask your receptionist for casa card with info, very easy to show card to taxi when you traveling and need to go back to your place.
5. Wi Fi....... usually every casa has it, but its slow,
6. Power - yep..... grab flashlight, you will need it. Its not like power is down and you are in the darkness, its just at evenings it could happened. In casas they have generators and solar batteries, but on the streets when you are walking around you will use it.
7. Water is available to buy every ware, do not drink tap water bring your owned bottle. Sunscreen, bug spray are must have. Also you might consider to do vaccines, but they are not mandatory, and you can find those online, I didnt do them.
8. Currency- you should ask you receptionist for the current rate, Dec 2025 350-400 peso for dollar, in casas, or in the stores. I did not looked for better rates from ""special"" people, better be save then sorry. Also have plenty of 1 dollar bills, ( I had 100 by 1)
9. People are very friendly and will try to explain or help if you ask them for something. Be aware that in Havana specifically ( did not see it as much in other cities) there are some people on the streets that will ask for medicine, dollars, pesos, anything...., because they need to feed child, lost job, have any other life difficulties, but if you are saying no! they are living you alone ( for the most part)
10. Food - in casas breakfast - juices, coffee, tee, salads, fruits, omelet, bred, cheese, sweet staff, etc... On the streets, I was ordering lobster in every place we went, about 6,500-7,000 pesos. They have every meat, veggie , chicken, everything. Food is very delicious! Drinks 600-1200 depends what you want. BE AWARE that you need to know currency rate!!! Some times its better to pay in dollars, some time in pesos, every place you go has a little different rate, so just ask rate right there, so you know how/what you will pay. Ask in your case where to go, they might recommend you dinner place. We also had small thermos and asked for hot water to mix with instant coffee, I am coffee addict.
11. Donations - very difficult topic, on the streets they asking for anything, in casas I was living dollars, med supplies, and I was traveling with staff that I knew I would just live there. Powdered milk, bandages, batteries, hygiene products, candy for kids, Nutella?!, benedrill, advill, tylenol... etc. Staff for kids, like highlighters, pens, pencils. I shopped in dollar store for bunch supplies, and also had a lot of medical staff at home. Note from me... I didnt know how to give all of this to people... on the streets? just randomly? So i asked our tour guy for help. You are not allowed to just go to the school grounds, or give it to pharmacy or hospital. We just divided our supplies in to zip locks and some of it went to people on the streets, some for casa families and workers, some are for recommended families. Anything you could live there will be used. Sad situation, good people......
12. Small staff.... in the bag I was carrying: small amount of toilet paper ( some places on the street, or rest stops, etc... do not have it), water bottle, triple ointment, snacks, sunscreen and bug spray, flashlight, ladies fan. Majority of our travel ""expenses"" are taxi fairs, gas there is very expensive and difficult to find for them.

I liked it there a lot, we spend couple of days on the beach as well, snorkeling was good, beautiful sea!!!! In summary I would recommend it, just be aware that its not a 5star luxury vacation , its more of the "" I want to see something different"" type of vacation, you need to understand that from the start, so you are not disappointed and complaining later. Cuba is beautiful and ugly (poverty) at the same time very authentic unique experience . Its kind of sad that not many people go there.

Hope my post helps! Have a nice vacation!",4,1766947975.0,travel,1,0.7,False

I ordered the Timemore S3, not the C3, and after reading more and more I'm starting to feel like I made a mistake with choosing this one.  
I am not in any way an expert or knowledgeable about coffee to notice a difference so I'm just asking here for some help. I am a newb at coffee.

Some context: I usually drink french press, and I had a cheap ceramic grinder before, but the knob used to tighten it broke, ironic that not the burr broke first. I wanted to also try to get into moka but I was not sure if this grinder was a good choice. What I found about it online was either lacking in detail or the person was confusing it with the C3. Probably a good idea would've been to ask here before making the purchase.  
  
My main reason reason for choosing this particular grinder was the foldable hand which makes it easier to travel with, and I heard some reviews that it has a pretty decent build, and it's a good one. Plus I got it for 100\~€, which might have given me the push to press buy.

1pxz38b,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pxz38b/desert_rose_bakery_the_cakes_are_to_die_for/,Desert Rose Bakery - The Cakes are to die for,"I had already seen three of the victims online before I ever spoke to the man and his daughter.
The first was a young mother from Victorville. Her photo on the news looked like it had been taken on some family camping trip, the sun tangled in her hair, her smile slightly off center like she had been laughing when the picture was snapped. The second was a truck driver from Apple Valley, who used to stop by for coffee when he passed through town. I didn’t know him well, but I remembered his voice, raspy, like every word scraped its way out of a dry throat. The third was a retired mechanic from Hesperia, a quiet man I had served pies to a handful of times. He always smelled faintly of oil and hot metal, even after he washed his hands.

The articles were short, bare facts and vague warnings. Black text on white screens, names reduced to ages and locations. But my dreams filled in the rest. Not the way you would expect, no monsters, no faceless killers. Just strange, quiet details that clung to me after I woke.

In one, I was standing in a patch of desert at night, the wind cold and restless, tossing grit into my eyes until they burned. The air tasted like rust and sage. The young mother lay in the dirt, one shoe missing, her sock dark with blood. Her hair was stiff, matted close to her scalp, crackling faintly when the wind touched it. I reached down and felt something hard pressed into her palm. A flower. Dry, fragile, its edges sharp enough to bite my skin. In the morning, when I read her obituary, I told myself my brain had made that up.

Another night, I dreamed of the truck driver’s rig sitting abandoned on a frontage road. The engine ticked softly as it cooled, metal snapping in the silence. I opened the cab door and the smell of old coffee and diesel rolled out. He was there, eyes open but not seeing, his hands resting on the wheel like he had simply paused mid drive. Between his fingers was the same kind of flower, pale, dry, curling inward on itself like it was trying to hide. I shook myself awake, heart racing, sure it was just because I had read too much about him.

For the mechanic, I dreamed of a dark workshop, the air thick with dust and grease. Tools hung on the walls, faintly clinking as if something had just passed through. He was slumped in a chair, head tilted to the side, mouth open slightly. One arm hung loose, fingers stiff. In his palm, again, a desert rose, chalky and brittle. I told myself it was just my mind recycling the same image.

Still, the dreams made me worry for my customers. Folks were scared. You could hear it in the way they spoke, voices low, sentences trailing off. Nobody wanted to throw birthday parties or retirements or even graduations anymore. If people weren’t celebrating, they weren’t ordering cakes.

My bakery in Adelanto, California, was barely holding on. The air inside always smelled like sugar and warm butter, but lately there was an edge to it, something anxious, like the smell of overheated wiring. I dropped my prices, lowest in town. Not because I needed the money, my aunt had left me enough to keep the place alive. But because it felt like something I could do. Maybe if people had a reason to smile, it would keep the fear from settling too deep, from sinking into the walls.

The cops came in sometimes. Their radios crackled softly at their hips while they drank coffee that had gone lukewarm. I gave them free pastries, told them it was just good community service. Really, I wanted to hear whatever scraps of information they would let slip. One afternoon, while they were nursing their coffee, I asked if they were getting any closer to finding him. One of them said something about “those flowers,” then shut his mouth like he had just stepped off a cliff.

I leaned in, resting my palms on the counter, felt the cool laminate under my skin. I asked what flowers.

“Desert roses,” he muttered, eyes fixed on his cup. “Every one of them is found with one in their hand.”

The weird part was, I knew that already. It wasn’t in any article. I had only seen it in dreams. I told myself it was just a lucky guess, that maybe I had read it somewhere and forgotten. But the thought wouldn’t leave me alone. It sat behind my eyes, heavy and insistent.

The nights after that were worse. I would wake in the dark and swear I smelled dust in my sheets, a dry, bitter scent that didn’t belong inside. My mouth felt gritty, like I had been chewing sand. Once I found a few grains of it on my bedroom floor, clinging to my socks when I got up for water. I told myself it was from tracking it in during the day, but I couldn’t remember walking through any that week.

A week later, the man and his daughter came in.
The bell over the door gave its usual tired jingle. She looked about sixteen, shoulders hunched, keeping her gaze low like she was somewhere else entirely. He stood too close to her, filling the space with the smell of sweat and aftershave. He was looking for a cake with a specific kind of frosting I didn’t have. I told him I couldn’t do it in time for the date he wanted. The girl flinched, just a small movement, like she was bracing for a sound that never came. Something in me twisted, tight and sharp. I smiled and told him I could make it happen after all.

That night, my sleep came heavy and deep. No tossing, no teeth in the dark, just a single, vivid dream.

I saw him walking alone on the edge of a dirt service road, the sky the color of cooling ash. The wind smelled like rain hitting dust, sharp and electric. Someone was behind him, close enough that I could hear their breathing, slow and steady. He turned his head, and there was a dull, wet sound, like something heavy dropped into mud. His knees buckled. He fell forward into the dirt, his cheek pressing against the ground, mouth filling with grit. His hand twitched once, twice, then went still. Between his fingers, a brittle desert rose caught the moonlight, its shadow sharp against the earth.

When I woke, I felt good. Rested. Clear headed. My body felt light, like I had finally exhaled after holding my breath too long.

I lay in bed scrolling through my feed until I saw the headline. LATEST VICTIM IDENTIFIED.

It was the father. Same photo I remembered from the shop, his arm around the daughter, her smile stiff and forced. I stared at the screen until my thumb went numb, and for some reason, I suddenly remembered something from that day in the bakery, something I had pushed aside.
Before I had stepped away to check the frosting, he had muttered at her. Low, but sharp enough to cut. “You’re wasting my money. Could have just bought a damn boxed cake mix and had your mother make it.”

Her eyes had stayed fixed on the floor. She hadn’t blinked.

I don’t know why that memory came back then, but it settled into my chest like a stone, cold and heavy.

I pulled out my order book, found his number, and called. No answer. Just his voicemail greeting, cheerful and oblivious. I told him the cake was ready for pick up.

When I hung up, I opened the industrial fridge to start on the morning prep. Cold air rushed out, raising goosebumps on my arms. The top shelf caught my eye. Two of my aunt’s dried desert roses sat in their glass jar, petals curled like little fists, pale against the glass.

Only two.

I stared at the empty space where the others had been and asked the room, “Where the hell did the rest go?”",1,1766947837.0,scarystories,2,0.67,False

However, I realize I also have denture cleaning tablets at home (which I use to clean my hydroflasks and other bottles/containers sometimes). Is this a less harsh method of cleaning? I want to be sure whatever I use to clean the ember mug, won't ruin the mug's inner coating. So if I can use the less harsh one while still effectively removing coffee stains, then I'd go with that!

Did i overreact?","I had been friends with this person for a very long time, but something happened which was basically my fault, we were alot of younger and stupider, i had a very toxic ex that was very jealous of her with no reason, and we stopped talking, that was almost 10 years ago.

She lives in a different country now, 6 months ago a mutual friend mentioned she was around town to see family, so i ended up sending her a message, and we met up for drinks, i basically opened up to her, told her how bad i felt about how things ended up, and apologized. She ended up messaging me later that day after we went home, and thanked me for everything, and told me she was glad we fixed things up and started being friends again.

We have been messaging eachother almost everyday since then, and after 2 months she basically became one of my best friends, i've always had alot of trust issues, but she made me feel like i was important to her and seemed to care about me.

We were sending eachother like a message a day, or every 2 days, which i'm perfectly ok with, honestly i'm not a person that is on his phone alot through the day and i've actually had issues with people before because i'm the one that usually takes too long to answer texts. She sometimes took 3-4 days to answer but that was very rare and actually apologized and explained to me that she had been busy with someting (i never really cared or even asked for explanations)

The problem is somewhere around a month ago or a little bit more, she started doing this all the time, every text i sent her she would take 3-4 days to answer while i could see she was on Instagram alot uploading Stories and such, and also being alot more distant when talking to me, sometimes even not answering or kind of ignoring something i asked her or about the topic we where talking about. I would normally not care about the texting thing but the whole mix with the sudden change i've felt on her has got me feeling pretty bad lately and wondering what could've happened, basically questioning if i'm putting too much effort in someone that doesn't really care about me or just see's me as an acquaintance and not as a friend, i have been depressed for some time and this or my trust issues because of shitty experiences i've had with bad people in the past clearly didn't help.

She was coming to town for Christmas and even told me a couple weeks before coming (when she was already being distant and rarely messaging me) that she wanted me to save some time for her so we could go out and do something. This whole week and a half that she has been here i've felt like a stranger to her, the second day she was here we had all day to go out of town and do something she ended up messaging me super late and we ended up only meeting for 2 hours to have coffee, the 2 other days we saw eachother before she left we were with mutual friends and barely talked to eachother, she basically had a couple of entire spare days without doing anything and never cared about doing anything with me.

Today i finally got tired because i have been feeling like shit for more than a month because of this, i've had similar experiences with friends that were very important to me and when i've felt a sudden lost of interest i just kind of cut them off out of my life. I told her what i've felt, about the change i have been feeling since a month, how important she started being in my life after we started talking again, and that i need to get away from her for now, because this is not making me any good and i dont feel i'm half as important to her as she is to me.

This is my first post, and English is not my native language, i hope i explained myself in the best manner, thanks to anyone that reads this. For some reason Reddit keeps deleting my message i got no idea why :( 

TLDR: I recovered a friendship that was lost because of mostly me screwing up, we start talking alot through a couple of months, and one day all of a sudden she starts being very distant and making me feel like she doesn't care about me, so i end up stopping trusting her and basically cutting her off loose.",0,1766947613.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

I am still exploring my sexuality, I have a hypothesis that I am probably Demisexual as I have never really been attracted to anyone, even after knowing people for a long time the closest I have got is a weak romantic feelings for another person. 

Shit hit the fan though recently, I attended a munch and after 1 conversation with a Demi individual, I immediately felt some sort of platonic love for this person, it was a weak feeling at first much like with others, but me and them just kept talking and feelings got stronger. Then they invited me for coffee and a chat, we ended up walking around a lake after some Turkish Pide.   
  
I was a fairly closed individual before the events of the last month, rarely being comfortable talking about sex or relationships. this person completely changed that, and put me on my path today. Throughout this chat I had probably the strongest emotions and platonic feelings I have ever felt before for a person. I can only describe basically after only recently learning about the types of love, that this was an incredible platonic love for this person

So my question to the Demisexual community.  
Would this be something a Demisexual individual, like I hypothesize myself to be, would experience or could experience?

Yes — this adds up, and it does so through the most underrated channel: everyday social proof.

What these scenes show isn't hard marketing; it's the emotional normalization of the product:

Delivery ritual (flowers, ribbon, photo): transforms the purchase into a personal event, not a transaction.

Daily use (coffee on the wheel, real traffic): the car as an extension of the routine.

Careful interior and color: its own identity, not a ""tech demo.""

Spontaneous testimonial (""I waited for Xiaomi… I chose NIO""): a choice by informed elimination, not by hype.

This mix is ​​powerful because it doesn't depend on the calendar (launches, NIO Day) or spreadsheets. It builds affinity. And affinity is what reduces friction when the ecosystem scales.

Something had just changed, and the clouds were constant. I don't remember when I last saw the sun in its true beauty. Yesterday was the end of the world. I don't know where everyone went, but they just disappeared, and I was just left in the shitty apartment. I was late on rent. I just don't know why I was left the only one. 


I woke up, not wanting to go to work. I was getting ready to go to the shitty office I work at. I made myself coffee on the stove and I went out to the balcony for my usual morning smoke, and it was empty, not a soul in sight, not even a sound, it was as if I had just entered a different dimension that was a cheap copy of the world. The greyness was only more intense. The world was sucked dry of its color. Even the crows seemed even darker as they flew by. It all felt still and dry, and not even the wind was there, just sucked dry of life. I felt scared, not because I felt in danger. Maybe it was a bit of that, but I knew what this feeling was... It's dread, pure unadulterated dread. I just felt weakened by just being here. Even though I was used to being alone, this was something else.

I kept looking down at the cars that were left untouched. I drank my coffee and just left my apartment. The bills I had just left in a pile uncaring. I put on my jacket and shoes and just left, locking the door as I usually do, and I walked down. It was just grey, black and white, which only just made sense to me. I walked down the hallway, then a door opened. I looked at the pitch black that was behind the door and then suddenly a light turned on over a baby's crib. The room I saw looked familiar, and subconsciously I began walking towards it. Even even though it was close, I just couldn't walk towards. It felt like I was walking on a treadmill it was so close, yet I couldn't get to it then it shifted, and it was my childhood room painted in vibrant colors and a child me was sitting on the bed the nostalgic covers brought me some bad memories and a few good ones I stopped and cried along with my childhood self the sound between us was agony an adult and a child crying together both hopeless as eachother",1,1766947274.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

For many months possibly a year now, there’s been a guy at my gym who’s frequently been in my proximity. Nothing weird, just consistently ending up on nearby machines, occasional eye contact, etc. A few months ago, I (F) approached and initiated friendly conversation. It was well received, we exchanged names, talked briefly about schedules and where we live/work, and I exited politely.

Since then, there’s been continued friendly interaction over time, warm eye contact, smiles, waves, brief conversations when paths cross. On a couple occasions I removed my headphones and initiated short, normal follow-up conversation, which he reciprocated (asking questions, remembering details, being engaged). We’ve even briefly crossed paths outside the gym and chatted again. The vibe has always felt comfortable and positive, not intense or overly personal.

What hasn’t happened: any escalation. No asking for a number, no suggestion to grab coffee, nothing beyond friendly connection despite multiple clean opportunities.

I’m trying to be realistic and not over-interpret. My question is:
After 4–5 months of this kind of repeated, warm but non-escalating interaction, is it fair to assume this is just a gym-friendly connection that’s not going anywhere? Or do people sometimes genuinely stall this long due to gym etiquette or caution?

Not looking to force anything, just trying to read the situation clearly and decide whether to mentally let it go.

Appreciate grounded perspectives.

This morning I was like, okay, I said I was going to Get Ready and Get Dressed™️. But I was thinking I was going to paint that morning, so I was like “well I should just sit down and start painting. . .No, you promised you were going to Get Ready today.” And I thought, why would I get ready to sit down in my house and paint? Why would I curl my hair for that? That’s stupid. 

And I thought okay, if you were going to a coffee shop, could you get ready then?? And the little petulant child in my brain nodded her head lol. 

Then this was my thought process: Okay, we’re getting ready to go to the coffee shop. It’s cold outside. I don’t want to look formal. But I also don’t want to look too schlubby. (So no-go on my enormous, baggy men’s snow jackets.) 

Once I had that in my mind, picking out clothes was pure vibes. I was like I want THIS and THIS and THIS. No thoughts head empty, I wasn’t really thinking about how it would all fit together or color or anything like that. 

After I’m fully dressed and haven’t seen myself yet, I walked into the living room to take photos and was like:

. . . Holy shit, I look like a pirate! (Or at least feel like one, in some indescribable way) 

????? this is awesome???? 😄 This looks so much cooler than I thought it would??

So, after that ramble I’d love to hear your thoughts.

Forceborne: Weight of the Soul 

CHAPTER 1 — Port of Ghosts 

Rain crawled down the gantries of the Port of Oakland, each droplet catching sodium light before slipping into black pools flooding the concrete below the containers. Freight cranes hunched in the dark like rusted titans, their red beacons blinking slow, tired warnings to a city that never looked this far west anymore. The air tasted of salt, diesel, and old storms that never quite left the Bay.

A white security van rolled to a stop near the north perimeter.

A young man stepped out, boots splashing into cold water.

“Kael.”

The voice came from beneath an awning.

Kael turned. Light-brown skin, lean but hardened in the way someone gets when survival stops being a lesson and becomes a routine. His uniform was stiff and new, his posture already worn. Tight waves brushed neatly across his head. His eyes scanned without urgency—measured, listening, like the rain itself was speaking to him.

The supervisor stood under the awning, clipboard tucked tight to his chest. The tag on his coat read MENDEZ. Exhaustion clung to him the way the rain clung to steel.

“First night?” Mendez asked.

Kael nodded. “Just hired last week.”

“Lucky you.” Mendez jerked his chin toward the container maze. “Two patrols each. North and west lines are yours. Halloween week, storms, short staffing…” He hesitated. “And a few incidents.”

Kael waited.

“If you hear something, call it in. You see something, don’t chase it. Observe and protect.” Mendez met his eyes. “Don’t be a hero.”

Kael let out a breath that almost passed for a laugh.

“Trust me,” he said quietly. “I’m far from a hero.”

⸻

The break room heater rattled without warming anything but a small square of carpet beneath it. A desk cluttered with sign-in sheets. A woman pouring coffee into paper cups, her hands steady despite the hour.

“Tara,” she said, offering one. “Night-shift survivor. Part-time Laney student.”

Her smile was small but real. Dark circles framed her eyes—the look of someone still trying, even while exhausted.

“Kael.”

He didn’t sit. Took the window instead. Watched rain stitch silver threads across the yard.

“Strange season to start,” Tara said softly. “Couple workers went missing last month. Union says accidents. Internet says ghosts.” She shrugged. “I say they went looking for trouble.”

Kael’s reflection blurred in the glass.

“Something tells me you don’t have to look very hard around here,” he murmured.

“You from Oakland?” She asked.

“Yeah. Left for a while, Came back to make good on a promise.”

The radio crackled.

“North perimeter check-in, in thirty,” Mendez’s voice dragged through static.

Kael nodded once and stepped back into the rain.

⸻

The port breathed.

Containers rose like silent apartment blocks—blue, red, peeling white. Rain drummed slow rhythms against steel roofs as Kael walked the west line, flashlight cutting a narrow cone through the dark.

He stopped.

Not because of sound—

But because of its absence.

His right hand lifted.

“Soul to Earth—Anchor.”

A faint blue pulse tremored beneath his uniform, then vanished.

The soul answered.

A metallic scream tore through the stacks.

Kael keyed his radio, voice steady. “Everything’s fine. Continuing patrol.”

Then came something else.

A wet, animal roar.

Hungry.

Alive.

Kael turned toward it.

“…On second thought,” he muttered, angling the radio up. “Call 911.”

He dropped the radio and ran.

⸻

Three Blocks Away

A man in a long black trench coat sprinted between spray-painted containers, puddles exploding under heavy boots. Muscular, dark-skinned, curls matted with rain. His breath burned as he cut a corner—

Dead end.

He tightened his grip on a marbled wooden wand carved with volcanic grooves.

A voice echoed from somewhere above.

“Wizard… all alone? Brave. Or stupid.”

Mars spat into the rain with grit. “They upped your bounty. Thought I’d check.”

He raised his wand—

Too late.

The Yokai crawled down the side of a container above him, limbs bending wrong, joints too many.

Charcoal-black skin split with molten orange veins. Rain hissed into steam before touching it. Horn-like ridges curved back from its skull, half-formed and jagged. Its mouth glowed like a furnace, teeth rearranged by something that didn’t understand bone.

“You want money?” it purred. “Bring me humans. I’ll give you anything.”

Mars looked up.

“…Sounds profitable,” he said. “Shame you won’t be able to cash it.”

The Yokai dropped.

Mars dove aside as molten claws slammed concrete.

“Earth to Soul—Flare Shot!”

His wand radiated blue aura as White flame cracked from the wand, striking dead center—

And vanished into steam.

The Yokai laughed as the last embers disappeared they begun to sparkle and pop creating an

Intense blinding light.

“You wizards keep coming,” it rasped. “Goldy Locks must be closing contracts.”

Mars froze. “What?”

“You’re not working with him, you’re just a pawn you could never be working with the Golden One.”

No time to ask.

The Yokai lunged.

Mars ran.

⸻

Row Nineteen

Steel screamed as the Yokai burst through a stack of containers—then stopped.

A blue sphere slammed into its torso.

The creature flew backward into wreckage.

Kael stood waiting.

“So,” he said calmly. “You talk?”

The Yokai screeched, claws digging molten grooves into the concrete.

“Yes, it talks!” Mars yelled from cover. “Now kill it!”

Kael didn’t look at him.

“Tell me what you know about the golden-horned Yokai,” Kael said. “And you live.”

The creature’s eyes narrowed.

It sprang.

Kael inhaled. Holding his right hand open toward the creature.

“Soul to Earth—Shockwave.”

Blue force thundered outward.

Steel bent. The Yokai slammed hard, molten veins flaring—then sealing.

It smiled.

“Warlock,” it breathed. “You’ll make a fine meal.”

A blade of wind sliced its arm clean away.

“Earth to Soul—Wind Slice!”

The wizard skidded into view.

The Yokai roared.

Kael stepped forward. His once spread  fingers now brought closely together as he holds his pal

Towards the stretching yokai. “now this is your last chance.” The yokai kept its silence but smiled demented ever lifting his hand up with what seemed to be a middle finger. 

“Soul to Earth—Slash.” Kael said unleashing 

A clean arc of blue carved reality.

The Yokai froze—then split.

Ash drifted.

Rain reclaimed the yard.

⸻

The wizard stared on.

“I’ve never seen casting like that,” he said. “What kind of conduit do you use?”

Kael walked past him.

“You’re with the Association,” the wizard called.

Kael slowed.

“I can help you find him,” the wizard said quickly. “The golden-horned demon.”

Kael stopped.

“…What did you say?”

“I know things,” he swallowed. “More than anyone else you’ll find.”

Rain filled the silence.

Kael glanced at the wreckage. At the broken steel. At the life he was standing in.

“What do you have to lose?” The wizard questioned 

Lightning split the sky, As sirens begun ringing through the air.

“…Nothing, nothing at all” Kael said.

(He M 22 blocked me when he has never done it before in the past year of our break up) F 22","I had a very bad relationship with my past partner. We broke up over a year ago, and sometimes we still talk, but only to fight, because I really hate him. If he contacts me, it's always 'I miss you', which I've made clear I don’t like. I can be normal, but I don’t want to talk in relationship terms. He still does it and claims he loved me. He hung out with a boy who touched inappropriately, didn't stand up for me, and is best friends with girls who spoke badly about me. He went out with them two days in a row, then texted me saying I should have met those girls out of courtesy because they were leaving town, even though we hadn’t spoken for a while by then. He then texted me about standing up for them ('namesake hello hi friends') but couldn’t call to wish me happy birthday when we were together. Now he has blocked me; I don’t know why. I don’t speak to him at all, and I’ve always kept him blocked, but before the year ends, I wanted to bury the hatchet. He blocked me first, so I called from my other number. He actively cut my calls. I think I was obsessed, and I called him twenty times. I feel so ashamed—I broke my streak of not reaching out. Then he says 'I want no contact; don’t call me,' and blocked this number too. It’s not that I want to be with him; it just felt like an ego hit, and I just can’t focus on anything else. Please help me, I don’t know what to do. I really don’t like him or care, but I’m hurt. Over the years, he never blocked me, so this felt particularly bad.

I have such resentment and hatred, but I really want to let it go. I just don’t know how. Every time I think of letting go, I remember how he asked his friend for explicit pictures of girls he was sleeping with and commented on how good their bodies looked. We had been together for four or five months then and he lied about his body count a lot, in detail. I always paid everywhere, and he never had time for me. I loved him and wanted to be with him all the time, but he chose his other friends over me every time and cheated on me. When we broke up, he would ask his friend where to take some random girl for dessert, but he never planned anything or put in any effort for me. We broke up for two days, and he did that. Even when we were talking but already broken up, almost together, he was chatting with forty girls on Instagram, begging them to meet up for coffee, complimenting them, and saying things like, 'No, tell me about your hobbies, tell me about yourself, what’s your favourite book?' I even won third place in a writing contest. He didn’t ask me what the story was. I still forgave him, stayed, and paid when he had the money to go to Manali, smoke, and drink — but not for coffee.

1pxyhfw,https://i.redd.it/b00vwtgggz9g1.png,Quick Guide to Your Country's Culture and Values,"Sweden is all about ""Lagom"", ""Fika"" and ""Jantelagen"".

**Lagom** 

Etymology of the word lagom: ""*\[eg. dat. pl. av LAG, sbst.1; jfr fsv. laghum, efter lagens föreskrift, lagligen\]*"" --- source: Svenska Akademiens Ordbok (the Swedish version of Oxford English Dictionary). Translated to law, but is used in the sense of appropriate or fitting.

* Balance & Moderation: The core idea is finding the ideal amount, avoiding excess and scarcity.
* Practicality: It's a down-to-earth philosophy applied to everyday choices, like work-life balance or mindful purchases.
* Fairness: Historically linked to Vikings sharing mead (""laget om""), it promotes a sense of community and equitable distribution.
* Social Sustainability: At its heart, lagom is about living sustainably by taking only what's needed.
* Swedish Psyche: It's considered a cornerstone of the Swedish national character, emphasizing consensus, moderation, and contentment

The Norwegians use that word ""*Passe*"" which conveys the meaning of suitability. Finns use the word ""S*opivasti*"" which is near identical. Icelandic people use an identical word ""*réttiligr*"". I will get angry Danes after me for saying ""Hygge"" is the closest word, emphasises balance and enjoyment in life, but in fact is closer to Fika.

**Fika**

Etymology of the word fika: ""slang inversion *of the syllables in the dialectal word kaffi (“coffee”), from Dutch koffie*"" or from ""craving"".

* More Than a Break: It's a mindset of slowing down, enjoying the moment, and connecting with others, a cornerstone of Swedish well-being.
* The Ritual: Usually involves coffee or tea, paired with pastries (fikabröd), cookies, or even sandwiches, but the act of pausing is key.
*  Glue: In workplaces, it builds team cohesion, fosters open communication, and improves morale, often scheduled daily.
* Social Versatile: Can be a quick chat with a colleague, a casual date (less pressure than a formal dinner), a family catch-up, or even a moment alone.  

Similar to the concept of ""Hygge"" from Denmark. Nordic neighbours help me out here.

**Jantelagen**

Most people would be surprised to find out that this was written by a Dane, Aksel Sandemose, who was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. His observation was sharp in (*En flyktning krysser sitt spor, 1933*); often it takes an outsider to tell you about something you don't know about yourself. Most Swedes have probably not read his book.

1. You're not to think you are anything special.
2. You're not to think you are as good as we are.
3. You're not to think you are smarter than we are.
4. You're not to convince yourself that you are better than we are.
5. You're not to think you know more than we do.
6. You're not to think you are more important than we are.
7. You're not to think you are good at anything.
8. You're not to laugh at us.
9. You're not to think anyone cares about you.
10. You're not to think you can teach us anything. 

According to ""*Distinctive Swedish Traits: Unlocking Essence of the Swedes*"", written by Campervan Sweden: *""This cultural code emphasizes humility, group solidarity, and discourages individual achievements that may set someone apart. Understanding Jantelagen is key to grasping the Swedish aversion to boasting or standing out.""* Most Swedes could agree, but then we all know that Zlatan, one of our most beloved Football players challenged this. (He was not humble and aimed to stand out). Jantelagen is said to reflect ""*a set of social norms that prioritize humility, egalitarianism, and collective well-being*"".

In 12months I have lost 50lbs without dieting or going on weightloss medication.

Last Christmas I accidentally ate wheat when I was at a restaurant which I'm intolerant to(I have been gluten free for 10+years) and since then haven't gotten better, usually my reactions to wheat would last between a few days to weeks before clearing over but every day without fail when I eat I get terrible stomach cramps​.

I live in Scotland and use the NHS, I've went to the doctor 5 times over this duration, i went first when I lost 20lbs in the first two months, the doctor said it was just an IBS flair up and it was not worrying due to my weight (I was overweight at the time, the first picture) he gave me mebeverine and sent me on my way, safe to say it didn't work, I went back a few months later after losing more weight and was with a different doctor, I asked for a nutritionist and they send they would send a referral but there was no guarantee I would hear back, they would probably just send a leaflet in the post.

Nothing came in the post and no appointment was given. I myself went without dairy, done a low fodmap diet, tried not eating garlic or onion.

Im already gf, don't drink fizzy juice or alcohol, I also don't eat oats. I don't go out to eat dinner anymore or have coffee or even sweets all of which I love.

I had also tried peppermint oil, buscopan and imodium

By this point I wasn't vomiting all the time of having diarrhea several times a day but the extreme ​stomach​ cramps hadn't settled and there was no consistency to my days, some days is beautiful in and out of the toilet and other days I was okay in the toilet​.

I moved house and went to a new clinic and they seemed a little more on the ball, at this point I'd lost more weight despite being able to stomach food without being sick. The doctor put in a referral to the hospital to get seen and asked me to do bloods, she said she was worried it was maybe crohns. She gave me amitriptyline. It didn't work and the debilitating cramps continued

AFter hearing nothing again from my bloods and from the hospital I went back and was wight again and I had lost 39lbs ​at this point (that was the last pic I took), she wanted to give me amitriptyline again but I didn't go on it because it didn't work, she checked my referral and I was on the waiting list.

Final visit was last week I went to the doctor and he weighed me again and I had lost 50lbs, I told the doctor I was starting to get scared and that it was really affecting my social life (always needing to be within walking distance of a toilet)  he told me he'd put in an emergency referral but he really wasn't worried, he said he thought it was just chronic pain​. And that they would see me when they see me.

He sent me away with more bloods to be taken and I need to give in ​three stool samples, no pain killers​, he said I most likely am a medical anomaly.

I feel so frustrated and upset, every day this pain is just unbearable, I could barely enjoy Christmas because I stayed away from the rich food, it's just been so hard.

is there anything I could take to ease this horrific pain, anything to slow the weight loss​

edit I wanted to add pics but couldn't do it on my phone for some reason, for reference I was just under 200lbs and now I'm 148lbs ",1,1766946405.0,ibs,2,1.0,False
1pxygrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/accelerate/comments/1pxygrb/how_to_solve_housing_forever/,How To Solve Housing Forever,"\*Prompt: If we were to purchase land and a reasonably sized house for every adult American or family that doesn't already own one, how could we fund that without breaking the economy completely?\*

  
Answer (ChatGPT Free): So you want to give everyone land and a house and somehow not detonate the economy like a dropped microwave. Bold. Unreasonable. Weirdly refreshing.

  
Short answer: you can’t do it with one magic pile of money, and you absolutely can’t do it overnight. The only way this works is slow, structural, and annoying. Which is why it never happens.


Here’s what would work without turning inflation into a feral animal.


1. Stop treating housing like Pokémon cards


First principle: housing cannot be both a universal human necessity and a speculative asset that’s expected to endlessly go up in price. Pick one. Civilizations that try to do both get tent cities.


So step zero is policy that:


Penalizes land hoarding and vacant housing


Taxes speculative flipping


Makes it boring to own ten houses and profitable to own one


This alone deflates prices without “breaking” anything. Investors scream, but investors scream at clouds anyway.


2. Use land that already exists and is already paid for


The U.S. government already owns:


Massive amounts of unused or underused land


Decommissioned military bases


Failing commercial real estate


Dead malls begging for mercy


You don’t buy that land. You repurpose it. Zoning reform does more economic work than a trillion dollars if you let it.


Upzone aggressively. Legalize dense housing. 

Kill single-family-only zoning in high-demand areas.


No new money required. Just political courage, which is rarer than uranium.


3. Build at scale like a civilization that plans ahead


Private housing is expensive because it’s bespoke, fragmented, and optimized for profit. 

Public housing can be cheap if you stop sabotaging it on purpose.


Do this:


National or regional public builders


Standardized, modular construction


Medium density, not dystopian towers


Mixed-use neighborhoods so people can walk like mammals


When you build millions of units the way we build highways, unit costs collapse. This is boring infrastructure math, not ideology.


4. Fund it the unsexy way


No single funding source. That’s toddler economics. You layer mechanisms so none of them overload the system.


Examples:


Land value tax (tax land, not buildings)


Progressive property surtaxes on second, third, tenth homes


Closing capital gains loopholes on real estate


Long-term federal housing bonds


Redirecting existing housing subsidies that currently inflate prices instead of lowering them


Notice what’s missing: “print infinite money.” You spend over decades, matched to real construction capacity, so inflation stays on a leash.


5. Give people homes, not tradable lottery tickets


If you just hand everyone a house they can immediately sell, congratulations, you’ve invented the Great Housing Flip of 2032.


Instead:


Long-term occupancy requirements


Shared equity models


Community land trusts


Restrictions on resale windfalls


People get stability, not a casino chip. The economy prefers that.


6. Accept the uncomfortable truth


You can absolutely house everyone without collapsing the economy.


What you can’t do is:


Preserve current housing wealth gains


Keep rent-seeking profitable


Avoid upsetting powerful asset holders


Those things are mutually exclusive with universal housing. The economy doesn’t break. Some expectations do.


And that’s the real obstacle. Not money. Not land. Not feasibility.


Just the collective refusal to admit that shelter shouldn’t behave like a luxury stock.


Annoying, right.

  
\*Prompt: How could we use AI and general purpose robotics to both reduce overhead and speed up the process?\*

  
Answer: So now we’re automating the part of civilization we somehow still do like it’s 1953. Good. This is the correct escalation.

AI and general-purpose robotics can absolutely compress timelines and costs. Not in a sci-fi “robot utopia tomorrow” way, but in a very boring, very powerful “overhead quietly evaporates” way. Here’s how it actually works.

1. Kill the planning bottleneck first (AI’s real superpower)

Construction is slow mostly because humans argue, miscalculate, duplicate work, and lose paperwork.

AI can:

Instantly generate compliant housing designs optimized for local codes, climate, and materials

Simulate neighborhoods before ground is broken: traffic, utilities, sunlight, heat, flooding

Optimize layouts for density without turning places into concrete misery

Auto-handle permitting documentation and inspections

This alone cuts years off projects. Not because AI is magical, but because it doesn’t forget to attach Appendix F for the fourth time.

2. Standardize housing like we standardized shipping containers

Robots love repetition. Construction hates bespoke nonsense.

AI helps by:

Designing a small library of modular housing types

Continuously improving them based on cost, durability, and occupant feedback

Adapting modules to different regions without redesigning from scratch

Once you standardize, robotics become useful instead of expensive toys.

3. Factory-built housing, not “robots on muddy job sites”

Putting humanoid robots on construction sites is flashy and mostly dumb. The real win is controlled environments.

Use robotics for:

Automated fabrication of wall panels, plumbing cores, wiring looms

Precision cutting and assembly with minimal waste

24/7 production without overtime, injuries, or coffee breaks

Then ship modules to sites and assemble them quickly with smaller human crews.

This turns housing into manufacturing. Manufacturing scales. Construction usually doesn’t.

4. Robots do the dangerous, tedious, soul-crushing parts

General-purpose robots shine when tasks are:

Repetitive

Hazardous

Physically exhausting

Examples:

Site prep and material handling

Bricklaying, drywall installation, painting

Roofing and exterior work

Demolition and recycling of old structures

Humans move into supervision, skilled finishing, customization, and maintenance. Less injury. Less burnout. Fewer shortages.

5. AI supply chain coordination (the invisible money saver)

A huge chunk of housing cost is logistics stupidity.

AI can:

Predict material demand months ahead

Reduce overordering and shortages

Coordinate local sourcing to cut transport costs

Optimize delivery timing so materials aren’t stolen, ruined, or blocking traffic

You don’t see this in glossy demos, but it’s where billions disappear quietly.

6. Continuous feedback loop from lived-in homes

Once people move in, AI keeps working.

It can:

Monitor structural health and energy efficiency

Predict maintenance before failures

Feed real-world data back into future designs

Reduce long-term operating costs

That means housing stays cheap over decades, not just at construction.

7. Why this doesn’t “steal all the jobs”

Construction already has:

Chronic labor shortages

Aging workforce

High injury rates

Robotics fill gaps humans don’t want to fill anymore. Meanwhile:

New jobs appear in robot maintenance, oversight, design, logistics

Training pipelines shift instead of collapsing

The economy adapts. It always does. The alternative is pretending nothing changes while everything rots.

The uncomfortable conclusion

AI and robotics don’t magically fix housing. They remove friction. They expose where the real resistance lives.

If deployed seriously, they could:

Cut housing costs dramatically

Build faster than population growth

Make universal housing logistically plausible

What they can’t do is override zoning laws, investor lobbying, or political cowardice.

Technology can build the houses. Only humans decide whether they’re allowed to exist.

Which is, tragically, the slowest subsystem of all.

  
\*Prompt: Only change I'd like to see is a tiny bit more customization - obviously building modularly is more efficient, but perhaps minor customization options can be included that don't break modularity?\*

Answer:  
Fair. Completely fair. Nobody wants to live in a copy-paste suburb where every house looks like it was stamped out by a tired god on a Friday afternoon. Efficiency doesn’t require aesthetic punishment. That was a choice.


The trick is constrained customization. You don’t let people freestyle, you give them meaningful knobs to turn that don’t break the system.


Here’s how you do it without detonating modularity.


1. Customize at the interface, not the core
Think of a house like a laptop.


You don’t redesign the motherboard for vibes. 

You customize:


Exterior panels


Interior finishes


Layout options within fixed structural grids


Structural core stays standardized. Everything people see and touch is flexible.


Robots stay happy. Humans don’t feel like livestock.


2. Parametric design instead of “one model, take it or leave it”


AI-generated parametric models let you vary:


Window placement and size within limits


Roof shapes and pitches


Balcony, porch, or courtyard options


Floor plan permutations using the same modules


Same parts. Different configurations. Zero bespoke engineering.


It’s Lego, not Play-Doh.


3. Aesthetic diversity via swappable skins


Exterior monotony is the real psychological crime.


Solve it with:


Multiple facade systems that attach to the same structural frame


Regionally inspired materials and colors


Pattern variation algorithms to prevent visual repetition


You can build 10,000 units that all share bones but look nothing alike unless you squint like a real estate investor.


4. Interior choice without chaos


Let residents choose from curated sets:


Kitchen and bathroom layouts


Flooring and wall finishes


Built-in storage options

Choices are finite and validated. No one gets to invent a new plumbing topology because they saw something on Pinterest.


This scratches the identity itch without wrecking supply chains.


5. Neighborhood-scale variation, not house-by-house anarchy


Uniformity feels worse when it’s uninterrupted.


Use AI to:


Vary height, setbacks, and orientation across blocks


Mix housing types intentionally


Insert communal spaces, courtyards, and green corridors


Avoid visual repetition within sightlines


The result feels organic, even though it’s highly controlled under the hood.


Cities already do this accidentally. You just do it on purpose.


6. Post-occupancy personalization is sacred


The house doesn’t need to express your soul on day one.


Design for:


Easy future modifications


Non-structural walls that can move


Add-on modules like sunrooms or workshops


Resident-led aesthetic evolution over time


A place becomes home through living, not through an options menu.


7. The key mindset shift


The choice isn’t:


Soulless prefab vs artisanal chaos


It’s:


Invisible standardization


Visible diversity


Modern manufacturing figured this out decades ago. Housing just refused to learn because conformity was cheaper and nobody powerful had to live there.


You can absolutely build fast, cheap, and humane housing that doesn’t feel like a dystopian diorama. It just requires respecting that people want difference, not infinite choice.


Which is reasonable. Even if humans are exhausting about it.",0,1766946387.0,accelerate,38,0.33,False

1pxygcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pxygcl/aita_for_testing_if_my_coworker_likes_me/,AITA for “testing” if my coworker likes me?,"Hi Reddit, throwaway because this whole thing is… messy.

So, I’m 24F, and I work with this guy, let’s call him Carl, he’s 26M. We’ve always had this kind of playful rivalry. I like watching how people react, and Evan pretty clearly has feelings for me. The way he looks at me sometimes, how he trips over his words when we talk, it feels obvious.

I’ve been kind of testing him. Nothing big, just pointing out small things and seeing how he responds. Sometimes I’ll say stuff like,

“Wow, you actually didn’t mess that up. I’m impressed for once.”

“Not bad, for someone like you.”

“Oh, I see you tried today. Cute effort.”

In my head, it’s just teasing, seeing if he’s into me, seeing where the line is. I’m not trying to hurt him. To me, it felt like a harmless experiment. But apparently other people see it very differently.

Today I found out that one of our coworkers went to HR and said I’m abusing and bullying Evan. They said I’m mean, controlling, and that I pick on him on purpose. I honestly don’t get it. I was literally just testing him. He seemed fine. He reacts, he smiles, he gets flustered. If anything, that made me think he liked me more. I can’t believe HR actually took this seriously. I’m not a bully, I thought I was helping him sort out his feelings.

Now people are looking at me weird, and Evan is being… awkward. I don’t even know what to say to him, because I’m genuinely confused. I thought I was being playful and a bit clever, and now I’m being told this counts as harassment.

So Reddit, am I the asshole for testing whether my coworker likes me by pointing out his mistakes and making him flustered? I really thought it was harmless fun and just part of flirting.

TL;DR  
I’ve been testing my coworker’s feelings with ""backhanded"" compliments and comments that make him flustered. Other coworkers say it’s bullying, HR got involved, and now I’m wondering if I’m actually the asshole.

EDIT: I just want to make clear. I’m really noticing how into Evan he obviously is. He keeps asking me to grab coffee, and we’ve even gone out alone a few times, without any coworkers. He freezes, blushes, and follows me around, and this has been happening before, during, and after I was “testing” him. I honestly thought it was just playful, harmless, and didn’t realize others might see it another way.

Edit 2. I will apologize to Evan. I can see how my so-called “testing” may have been frustrating. I really appreciate how he mirrors my actions, finds reasons to be near me, remembers small things I mention, explains things in detail, and shows small signs of jealousy. It’s clear how much he cares. From now on, I’ll try harder to notice his efforts, give him space when he needs it, and be more thoughtful in how I speak to him.

Or you can request just one big-ticket item and have everyone split the cost. This year, my brother asked for a very fancy and beautiful coffee machine, and only that. We siblings and our parents gladly agreed to divide the expense evenly.

1pxya6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pxya6p/someone_turned_my_campsite_into_a_trap_while_i/,Someone Turned My Campsite Into a Trap While I Slept.,"I am writing this from a hospital waiting room with my hands wrapped like I tried to catch barbed wire on instinct.

I went camping last weekend at a state park outside my town. That is what the reservation email said. Loop C.

I still have the receipt. It is smeared from rain and sweat, but I can read enough of it. State park. Camping fee, one night. Vehicle fee. Total thirty-five dollars. A reservation ID that means nothing to anyone except me.

I am not asking you to believe in the paranormal. Something mechanical happened to me out there. Something you can buy, carry in a tote, and switch on.

I camp alone a lot. I do it the boring way. I tell my sister where I am. I park nose-out. I lock food up. I do not hike off trail at night. I do not drink. I do not go looking for trouble.

This time I wanted one quiet night and a morning coffee that tastes like smoke.

I got there around 4:40 p.m. The ranger in the booth tore my printed slip and gave me the usual talk about quiet hours and not leaving coolers unattended. The entrance sign had a changeable-letter board under it. Fire danger was moderate. No moving firewood. Quiet hours 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

The park was half full. Families in big SUVs. A couple with a rooftop tent. A group of teenagers arguing over a Bluetooth speaker that kept cutting out when they walked too far from it.

Loop C sat deeper in the pines. The road was dirt and washboarded. My spot was on the outer edge. Not the best view, but private. Picnic table. Fire ring. One of those steel bear boxes bolted into a slab of concrete, the kind that squeals when you open it.

The first thing that felt off was the posts.

There were four skinny fiberglass stakes around my site, about waist height, with bright orange reflective tape on the tops. Like survey markers. They were spaced in a loose square that did not match a normal campsite boundary. Each stake had a black zip tie near the top, cinched tight around nothing.

I stood there longer than I want to admit, staring at them with my hands on my hips like that would solve anything. I told myself it was maintenance. Hazard tree marking. Utility work. Something.

I set up my tent, a little two-person backpacking tent. I parked nose-out. I put my cooler in the bear box.

Here is the stupid human mistake I keep replaying. I did not latch the bear box the first time.

I closed it. I heard the heavy door thunk. I walked away thinking it was secure. Ten minutes later I walked back and realized the latch was still open by half an inch, the way it sits when you do not pull it down and lock it. I muttered at myself, fixed it, and moved on.

Around 6:10 I walked to the restroom building to wash up. The building was painted that tired park-bathroom green, and it smelled like damp concrete and lemon cleaner that never quite wins. On the way back I passed a bigger site where a dad was pounding stakes into the ground with the flat side of a hatchet.

He nodded at me and said the bugs were insane.

I agreed even though I hadn’t noticed bugs yet.

He looked past me toward my site and squinted like he was trying to read something in the dark.

“What are those poles?” he asked.

“Already here,” I said. “Probably maintenance.”

He made a face like he did not love that answer, then went back to his tent.

I made a small fire. Not a big one. Just enough to feel like I earned being outside. I ate a pouch dinner and sat on the bench with my headlamp around my neck, listening to the campground noise thin out. A baby cried somewhere down the loop. Someone laughed too loud and got shushed. A car door slammed. Then it got quiet in that way campgrounds do, where you still hear people, but it comes in little distant pieces.

At 9:58 my phone flipped from 5G to SOS. I remember because I looked at it before crawling into my sleeping bag. I texted my sister “All good. Night.” It failed to send. Not surprising. Lots of parks have dead spots.

I fell asleep with my keys in my hand.

That is another thing I normally never do. I always put them in the same pocket. This time I was half asleep and I set them on the picnic table when I tightened my tent guylines, then forgot to pick them back up. I did not realize that until later, when it mattered.

I slept for maybe two hours.

I woke up because my tent moved.

Not a gentle flutter of wind. A hard tug, like someone grabbed the rainfly and yanked.

My first thought was an animal brushing past. Then the tent moved again, lower, like pressure at ankle height.

I sat up fast. My elbow hit the tent wall. My heart went straight to my throat.

I listened.

No footsteps. No snorting. Just a faint sound outside that didn’t belong. A tiny clicking, steady, like a cheap plastic pen being pressed over and over.

Click. Click. Click.

I found my headlamp and turned it on, pointing it at the tent wall. The nylon glowed. Shadows moved wrong. Thin lines crossed the fabric, not like branches, not like the normal wavering shapes you see when a light hits canvas.

I pushed the door zipper open just enough to look out.

The beam hit the orange tape on the nearest stake and flashed bright. Behind it, in the dark, something caught the light in sharp little glints.

Clear line. Fishing line. Monofilament. Dozens of strands stretched between the stakes. Some at shin height, some at waist height, some higher. A web that had not been there when I went to sleep.

And it was moving.

Not swaying. Pulling. Tightening.

The clicking got faster.

A line snapped tight across the front of my tent door and the nylon creased around it like it was being cinched. The tent shifted an inch. Then another.

I crawled out on my hands and knees because standing felt like begging to get clotheslined. The headlamp made the lines sparkle for half a second, then they vanished again unless the beam hit them at the right angle.

A line caught my wrist.

It did not wrap gently. It bit. Pain so clean it felt hot. It dug into skin like a wire saw.

I yanked back on instinct and the line tightened, dragging my hand forward toward the nearest stake. My headlamp bounced. The beam flashed over the ground and I saw where the lines were anchored.

Small black boxes at the base of trees, each about the size of a brick. Each had a spool and a little metal wheel like a tiny winch. The clicking was coming from those boxes.

They were pulling the line in.

A second line snapped up and caught two of my fingers together. My hand cramped instantly. I felt my pulse banging against plastic and pressure.

I went for my pocket knife. Got it open. Brought it down on the line at my wrist.

It did not cut right away. The line stretched. The blade skated. Then it finally nicked through. The moment it broke, the free end snapped back and whipped my knuckles.

I rolled, trying to get clear. A line tightened under my armpit. Another caught my ankle and my foot slid toward the stake like the ground had turned slick.

I started yelling. Loud. Ugly. I screamed for help until my throat burned.

No one came running.

Either nobody heard, or nobody wanted to charge into a campsite full of invisible line.

Then I heard something new. Not clicking.

A soft electronic chirp, like a key fob, followed by a longer tone.

One of the winch boxes changed pitch. It went from click to a smooth high whine for half a second.

The line on my wrist tightened again and I understood what it was doing.

This wasn’t just a web. It was a net that was closing around me.

I crawled toward the nearest box, cutting lines as I went. Each cut line snapped back, stinging, sometimes catching my clothes. The knife handle got slick with blood. My wrist burned in a clean groove where the line had opened it.

I reached the nearest box.

It was strapped to the trunk with a ratchet strap. A thick battery pack sat beside it, wired in. On top was a small antenna, like a cheap handheld radio.

The line ran through a metal guide and onto a spool.

I drove the knife down and cut as close to the spool as I could.

The motor protested. The line went slack for a breath.

Then the spool reversed and yanked the slack back. The line tightened around my calf again, harder, like the system corrected itself.

Something in the trees flashed to my left.

A red dot, low, moving.

My headlamp caught a shape behind a trunk. Someone using the trees. Keeping distance. A hand raised. I saw the rectangle of a phone or a remote. The red dot moved again and settled on my torso, steady, like it was aimed on purpose.

My stomach turned cold. Not because of the dot. Because of what it meant.

This was for me.

I grabbed the battery cable and ripped it out of the box.

The clicking stopped. The line around my leg went slack so suddenly I almost fell backward.

For half a second it was quiet except for my breathing and the soft snap of the fire dying down in the ring.

Then another clicking started farther away. Another box. Backup. The lines began tightening again, slower but still tightening.

The person in the trees shifted. Leaves crushed under a careful step.

I did not wait.

I crawled out of the tightening net, cutting and dragging, getting snagged, freeing myself in inches. My shorts tore. My skin caught line and I felt it burn new grooves across my thigh and forearm. My headlamp bounced, turning the trees into quick flashes.

I got to my car and reached for my keys.

Nothing.

My pocket was empty.

My brain did this blank, stupid pause, like it tried to deny reality for a second. Then it hit me. Picnic table.

The clicking sped up again. The net tightened again. I could feel it starting to catch my waist.

I turned my headlamp toward the picnic table and saw them glinting there like a cruel joke. Right where I left them.

I crawled to the table, grabbed them, and my wrist screamed when the line shifted against the cut.

I got back to the car, hit unlock, and yanked the door open.

A line snapped tight across my waist as I tried to get in. It caught on my belt and pulled me back hard enough that my head clipped the door frame.

I screamed and cut at it. The knife finally sliced through. The tension snapped back into the trees.

I fell into the seat, slammed the door, and locked it.

Lines slapped the outside of the car. I heard them ping against the metal like cables flicking a drum. In my headlight beam I saw the stakes again, and my stomach dropped even more.

There were more than four.

Extra stakes beyond the campsite boundary, closer to the road, hidden in brush. The web reached toward the road like it expected me to run.

I started the car and threw it into reverse.

The tires spun on dirt. The car lurched and I felt a jolt, like I hit something soft but strong. The hood dipped. The lines stretched. For a second I thought the car would be held in place.

Then the lines snapped.

The sound was sharp, multiplied. Whip cracks. The hood shook. Something slapped the windshield and left a wet streak.

I reversed hard, then swung forward, aiming for the main road out of the loop.

In my mirror, between trunks, I saw the person move.

A silhouette, closer now. Reflective tape on their sleeves, orange like the stakes. They stepped toward my car and raised a hand.

Not waving. Pointing.

My headlights swept the ground and for a second I saw what they’d been standing near. A plastic tote half buried in needles, lid cracked open, full of coiled clear line and more black boxes. Supplies.

I hit the gas.

On the way out I laid on the horn until it sounded wrong. I wanted lights to come on. I wanted witnesses.

Some did. Porch lights snapped on. A man stepped onto the road in socks, hands up like he did not know whether to stop me or ask what was wrong.

I did not stop.

I drove straight to the entrance booth. It was closed, dark, but there was an emergency phone box by the gate. A small sign above it said to lift the receiver for emergencies and not to use it for reservations.

My hands shook so badly I dropped the receiver once. I told the dispatcher someone had set wire traps in my campsite and there were motors pulling them tight. I kept saying “wire” because “fishing line” sounded too stupid for what it had done.

A sheriff’s deputy arrived first. Then a ranger in a separate vehicle. They took one look at my wrists and legs and told me to sit.

They drove back to Loop C with lights on.

I didn’t go with them. I couldn’t make myself.

I sat under a buzzing light and watched moths slam into the plastic cover while my blood dripped onto the concrete. I remember thinking, very clearly, that the drip was too slow to be real, like my brain was watching it in someone else’s body.

When the ranger came back his face looked different, like he’d aged ten years on the drive.

He did not tell me it was nothing. He did not tell me I imagined it.

He said, “We found it.”

They found the stakes. They found the lines. They found multiple winch boxes still strapped to trees, still working, still pulling line even after I’d ripped one battery loose. They found the tote.

They did not find the person.

At the hospital they irrigated the cuts. They picked clear fragments out of my skin with tweezers. They gave me a tetanus shot. The doctor asked if I’d been attacked.

I told him yes.

He asked by what.

I told him, “A system.”

Two days later I drove past that state park on my way to work just to prove to myself it existed.

The sign is still there. The entrance still looks friendly. The little tourist board still advertises it like a peaceful place to unwind.

Loop C is closed now. There is new signage zip-tied to the permanent posts. Bright yellow, temporary. It says the area is closed due to utility work and not to enter Loop C.

If I ever camp again and see skinny fiberglass stakes with reflective tape that do not make sense, or zip ties around nothing, I won’t assume it is maintenance.

I won’t sleep in that site.

I won’t step between those posts.

And if I hear clicking in the dark that doesn’t sound like an animal, I’m leaving. I’m doing it before the lines start moving.

Because once they start pulling, you stop being a camper.

Spent way too much time researching supplements because I was tired of wasting money on hyped up garbage that does nothing. The supplement industry is a $150B racket that preys on people wanting shortcuts. Most products are borderline scams with fancy marketing and zero real science backing them up.

Good news: there ARE a few supplements actually worth taking. Backed by legitimate research, not just bro science from your gym buddy or some influencer's affiliate link. I dove deep into studies, podcasts with actual researchers, and books by people who aren't trying to sell you their proprietary blend of pixie dust.

Here's what actually works (and what doesn't):

**Vitamin D is non negotiable**

Unless you're outside shirtless for hours daily, you're probably deficient. Around 40% of people are. Vitamin D affects everything from bone health to immune function to mood regulation. The research is absolutely overwhelming on this one.

Get the D3 form specifically, not D2. Take 2000-5000 IU daily depending on your levels (get bloodwork done if possible). Take it with a fat source since it's fat soluble. Costs like $10 for a year's supply. Literally the highest ROI supplement you can take.

Dr Layne Norton talks about this constantly on his podcast Biolayne, and he's one of the few fitness PhDs who actually reads the full studies instead of just the abstracts. The guy has a PhD in Nutritional Sciences and competes in powerlifting, so he's not some armchair expert.

**Creatine monohydrate is stupid cheap and stupid effective**

Most researched supplement in existence. Over 1000 studies supporting it. Increases strength, muscle mass, and cognitive function. Yes, your brain benefits too.

Take 5g daily. Timing doesn't matter. The loading phase is unnecessary, just take 5g every day and you'll be saturated in a few weeks. Costs like $20 for a 6 month supply.

Ignore the fancy forms like creatine HCL or buffered creatine or whatever. Monohydrate works and it's way cheaper. The supplement companies want you buying the expensive versions because they make more money, not because they work better.

**Omega 3s if you don't eat fish regularly**

Most people are getting way too much omega 6 (from vegetable oils, processed foods) and not enough omega 3. This imbalance promotes inflammation.

If you eat fatty fish 2-3x per week you're probably fine. If not, supplement with fish oil or algae based omega 3 (for vegans). Aim for 1-2g of combined EPA and DHA daily, not just total fish oil. Check the label because a 1000mg fish oil capsule might only have 300mg of actual EPA/DHA.

Quality matters here because cheap fish oil can be oxidized (rancid) which defeats the purpose. Stick with brands that third party test like Nordic Naturals or Carlson.

**Protein powder is just convenient food**

Not magic, just convenient. If you're hitting your protein targets through whole foods, you don't need it. If you're struggling to get enough protein (aim for 0.7-1g per pound of bodyweight if you're training), then whey or plant based protein powder makes life easier.

Whey is cheapest and most effective. MyProtein is solid and way cheaper than the fancy brands. If you're lactose intolerant, try whey isolate or a plant blend (pea and rice together give you a complete amino acid profile).

The book ""Bigger Leaner Stronger"" by Mike Matthews breaks down protein supplementation really well without the usual bro science BS. Guy actually cites his sources and updates the book when new research comes out.

**For the knowledge hungry, there's BeFreed**

An AI-powered learning app that pulls from research papers, expert talks, and books to create personalized audio content on any topic, including nutrition and fitness science. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers, it generates custom podcasts based on what you want to learn, whether it's a 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with examples.

The adaptive learning plan adjusts to your goals and keeps evolving as you learn. Plus, there's a virtual coach that answers questions mid-podcast and captures your insights automatically. The voice options are surprisingly addictive, from calm and soothing to energetic depending on your mood. Useful if you want to dig deeper into the actual research behind supplements without wading through paywalled studies.

**What NOT to waste money on:**

Multivitamins: your piss becomes expensive yellow pee. Most of it isn't absorbed properly and you're better off eating varied foods. If you're deficient in something specific, supplement that thing specifically.

BCAAs: completely useless if you're eating adequate protein. Manufacturers basically convinced people to buy overpriced flavored amino acids that you already get from food and protein powder.

Testosterone boosters: the only thing that boosts testosterone in supplement form is literal testosterone (requires prescription). The natural ""boosters"" might increase T by like 10% in specific deficient populations, which translates to absolutely nothing in real world results.

Fat burners: caffeine works somewhat, everything else is snake oil or dangerous stimulants. Just drink coffee and fix your diet.

Pre workout: mostly just caffeine and beta alanine (the tingles). You're paying $40 for what amounts to a strong coffee with some filler. If you want pre workout just drink coffee and eat a banana.

Greens powders: eating actual vegetables is cheaper and better. AG1 costs $99/month when you could literally just eat some spinach and broccoli.

Collagen: the research is extremely weak. Your body breaks it down into amino acids anyway so there's nothing special about consuming collagen specifically vs just eating protein.

**Real talk**

Supplements are SUPPLEMENTARY. They fill gaps in an already solid foundation of diet, training, and sleep. The supplement industry wants you thinking they're essential game changers so you keep buying their overpriced products.

If your training sucks, your diet is garbage, and you sleep 5 hours a night, no supplement stack will save you. Fix those first. Then consider the basics: vitamin D, creatine, omega 3s if needed, protein powder if convenient.

Anything beyond that is either personal experimentation or unnecessary spending. Save your money for quality food, a good gym membership, or literally anything else.

The actual research is pretty clear on this stuff but everyone wants to sell you magic pills instead of telling you the boring truth: consistency with basics beats exotic supplements every single time.",1,1766945913.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m doing my Masters + PhD :) I was raised in both the US and UK over the years so my accent throws people off (I just embrace it as an international school accent). I did my undergrad overseas and then moved back home because I wanted to be closer to family and I miss rainy London. About me: I love to run, swim, hike. My hobbies include, crafting, cooking, reading, movies, and music. My preferred drink is a Matcha Latte but I also really love coffee. My studies and work keep me incredibly busy but ever so often I crave some good deep conversations with a hint (a lot) of sweetness.  I enjoy having academic conversations since I love learning new things. I’m a big fan of staying in and if I could I would probably never leave my house. 

I don’t even know what to say, if you’re kind, can keep the conversation going we can take this somewhere far. I’m certain. I can show you my stupid yarn collection or something and make you a stupid mushroom pizza toast with Japanese milk bread every Sunday morning. I’ll play overcooked with you and we can tell other where we are lacking and laugh, oh we can laugh together. 

Let’s laugh together? I also want to travel in trains, I fucking love stupid trains fucking choo choo. ",8,1766945763.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.83,False
