  Parents had some kind of sin radar, Claire thought. They always called when you were in the middle of something you just knew they'd consider wrong. Or at least risky.  
  
  Claire Danvers slid off of her boyfriend Shane's lap with a regretful sigh, licked her damp, tingling lips, and went to answer the ringing phone in the kitchen. Michael was just getting up from the table to grab it, but Claire waved him off. She just knew it would be her mother.  
  
  She was right.  
  
  ""Claire! Oh my goodness, I've been worried sick, honey. We've been trying to call you on your cell for days, and -- ""  
  
  Crap. Claire rubbed her forehead in frustration. ""Mom, I wrote you guys an email, remember? My cell got lost, I'm still working on getting another one. "" Best not to mention how it had gotten lost. Best not to mention anything about how dangerous her life had gotten since she'd moved to Morganville, Texas.  
  
  ""Oh,"" Mom said, and then, more slowly, ""oh. Well, your father forgot to tell me about that. You know, he's the one who checks the email. I don't like computers. ""  
  
  ""Yes, Mom, I know. "" Mom really wasn't that bad, but she was notoriously nervous with computers, and for good reason; they had a tendency to short out around her.  
  
  Mom was still talking. ""Is everything going all right? How are classes? Interesting?""  
  
  Claire opened the refrigerator door and retrieved a red can of Coke, which she popped open and chugged to give herself time to think what, if anything to tell her parents. Mom, there was a little trouble. See, my boyfriend's dad came to town with some bikers and killed people, and nearly killed us too. Oh, and the vampires are angry about it. And so to save my friends, I had to sign a contract, so now I'm basically the slave of the most bad-ass vampire in town.  
  
  Yeah, that wouldn't go over well.  
  
  Besides, even if she said it, Mom wouldn't understand it. Mom had been to Morganville, but she hadn't really seen. People didn't. And if they did, they either never left town, or had their memories wiped on the way out.  
  
  And if by some chance they started to remember, bad things could happen to them. Terminally bad things.  
  
  So instead, Claire said, ""Classes are great, Mom. I aced all my exams last week. ""  
  
  ""Of course you did. Don't you always?""  
  
  Yeah, but last week I had to take my exams while worrying if somebody was going to stick a knife in my back. It could have had an effect on my GPA. Stupid to be proud of that . . . ""Everything's fine here. I'll let you know when I get the new cell phone, okay?"" Claire hesitated, then asked, ""How are you? How's Dad?""  
  
  ""Oh, we're fine, honey. We miss you is all. But your father's still not happy about you living in that place, off campus, with those older kids -- ""  
  
  Of all the things for Mom to remember, she had to remember that. And of course Claire couldn't tell her why she was living off campus with eighteen-year-olds, especially when two of them were boys. Mom hadn't gotten around to mentioning the boys yet, but it was just a matter of time.  
  
  ""Mom, I told you how mean the girls were to me in the dorm. It's better here, really. They're my friends. And really, they're great. ""  
  
  Mom didn't sound too convinced. ""You're being careful, though. About those boys. ""  
  
  Well, that hadn't taken long. ""Yes, I'm being careful about the boys. "" She was even being careful about Shane, though that was mostly because Shane never forgot that Claire was not-quite-seventeen, and he was not-quite-nineteen. Not a huge age difference, but legally? Huger than huge, if her parents got upset about it. Which they definitely would. ""Everybody here says hello, by the way. Ah, Michael's waving. ""  
  
  Michael Glass, the second boy in the house, had settled down at the kitchen table and was reading a newspaper, looked up and gave her a wide-eyed no-you-don't shake of his head. He'd had a bad enough time of it with her parents the last time, and now . . . well, things were even worse, if that was possible. At least when he'd met them, Michael had been half-normal: fully human by night, an incorporeal ghost by day, and trapped in the house twenty-four/seven.  
  
  For Morganville, that was half-normal.  
  
  In order to help get Shane out of trouble, Michael had made a terrible choice -- he'd gained his freedom from the house, and gotten physical form all the time, but now he was a vampire. Claire couldn't tell if it bothered him. It had to, right? But he seemed so . . . normal.  
  
  Maybe a little too normal.  
  
  Claire listened to her mother's voice, and then held out the phone to Michael. ""She wants to talk to you,"" she said.  
  
  ""No! I'm not here!"" He stage-whispered and made waving-off motions. Claire wiggled the phone insistently.  
  
  ""You're the responsible one,"" she reminded him. ""Just try not to talk about the - "" She mimed fangs in the neck.  
  
  Michael shot her a dirty look, took the phone, and turned on the charm. He had a lot of it, Claire knew; it wasn't just parents who liked him, it was . . . well, everybody. Michael was smart, cute, hot, talented, respectful . . . nothing not to love, except the whole undead aspect. He assured her mother that everything was fine, that Claire was behaving herself -- his eyeroll made Claire snort cola up her nose --and that he was watching out for Mrs. Danvers's little girl. That last part was true, at least. Michael was taking his self-appointed older brother duties way too seriously. He hardly let Claire out of his sight, except when privacy was required or Claire slipped off to class without an escort -- which was as often as possible.  
  
  ""Yes ma'am,"" Michael said. He was starting to look a little strained. ""No ma'am. I won't let her do that. Yes. Yes. ""  
  
  Claire had pity on him, and reclaimed the phone. ""Mom, we've got to go. I love you both. ""  
  
  Mom still sounded anxious. ""Claire, are you sure you don't want to come home? Maybe I was wrong about letting you go to MIT early. You could take the year off, study, and we'd love to have you back home again . . . ""  
  
  Weird. Usually she calmed right down, especially when Michael talked to her. Claire had a bad flash of Shane telling her about his own mother, how her memories of Morganville had started to surface. How the vampires had come after her to kill her because the conditioning didn't stick.  
  
  Her parents were in the same boat now. They'd been to town, but she still wasn't sure just how much they really knew or understood about that visit -- it could be enough to put them in mortal danger. She had to do everything she could to keep them safe. That meant not following her dreams to MIT, because if she left Morganville --assuming she could even get out of town at all -- the vampires would follow her, and they'd either bring her back or kill her. And the rest of her family, too.  
  
  Besides, Claire had to stay now, because she'd signed a contract pledging herself directly to Amelie, the town's Founder. The biggest, scariest vampire of them all, even if she rarely showed that side. At the time, she'd been Claire's only real hope to keep herself and her friends alive.  
  
  So far signing the contract hadn't meant a whole lot -- no announcements in the local paper, Amelie hadn't shown up to collect on her soul or anything. So maybe it would just pass by . . . quietly.  
  
  Mom was still talking about MIT, and Claire didn't want to think about it. She'd dreamed of going to a school like MIT or CalTech her whole life, and she'd been smart enough to do it. She'd even gotten early acceptance. It was drastically unfair that she was stuck in Morganville now, like a fly in a spider's web, and for a few seconds she let herself feel bitter and angry about that.  
  
  Nice, the brutally honest part of her mocked. You'd sacrifice Shane's life for what you want, because you know that's what would happen. Eventually, the vampires would find an excuse to kill him. You're not any better than the vampires if you don't do everything you can to prevent that.  
  
  The bitterness left, but regret wasn't f  
ollowing any time soon. She hoped Shane never knew how she felt about it, deep down.  
  
  ""Mom, sorry, I've got to go, I have class. I love you -- tell Dad I love him too, will you?""  
  
  Claire hung up on her mother's protests, heaved a sigh, and looked at Michael. Who was looking a little sympathetic.  
  
  ""That's not easy, talking to the folks,"" he offered. ""Sorry. ""  
  
  ""Don't you ever talk to your parents?"" Claire asked, and slid into the chair at the small breakfast table across from him. Michael had a cup of something; she was afraid it was blood for a second, but then she smelled coffee. Hazelnut. Vampires could, and did, enjoy food; it just didn't sustain them.  
  
  Michael looked suspiciously good this morning -- a little color in his face, an energy to his movements that hadn't been there last night.  
  
  He'd had more than coffee this morning.  
  
  ""Yeah, I call my folks sometimes,"" Michael said. He folded the newspaper -- the local rag, run by vampires -- and picked up a smaller, rolled bundle of letter-sized pages secured by a rubber band. ""They're Morganville exiles, so they have a lot to forget. It's better if I don't keep in contact too much, it could make trouble. I mostly write. The mail and email gets read before it goes on, you know that, right? And most of the phone calls get monitored, especially long distance. ""  
  
  He stripped off the rubber band and unfolded the cheap pages of the second newspaper. Claire read the masthead upside down: The Fang Report. The logo was two stakes at right angles making up a cross. Wild.  
  
  ""What's that?""  
  
  ""This?"" Michael rattled the paper and shrugged. ""Captain Obvious. ""  
  
  ""What?""  
  
  ""Captain Obvious. That's his handle. He's been doing these papers every week for about two years now. It's an underground thing. ""  
  
  Underground in Morganville had a lot of meanings. Claire raised her eyebrows. ""So . . . Captain Obvious is a vampire?""  
  
  ""Not unless he's got a serious self-image problem,"" Michael said. ""Captain Obvious hates vampires. If somebody steps out of line, he documents it -- "" Michael froze, reading the headline, and his mouth opened, then closed. His face set like stone, and his blue eyes looked stricken.  
  
  Claire reached over and took the newspaper from his hands, turned it, and read.  
  
  NEW BLOODSUCKER IN TOWN  
  
  Michael Glass, once a rising musical star with too much talent for this twisted town, has fallen to the Dark Side. Details are sketchy, but Glass, who's been keeping to himself for the past year, has definitely joined the Fang Gang. Nobody knows how or where it happened, and I doubt Glass will be talking, but we should all be worried: does this mean more vamps, fewer humans? After all, he is the first newly risen undead in generations.  
  
  Beware, boys and girls: Glass may look like an angel, but he's got a demon inside now. Memorize the face, kibbles. He's the newest addition to the Better Off Dead club!  
  
  ""The Better Off Dead club?"" Claire repeated aloud, horrified. ""He's kidding, right?"" There was Michael's picture, probably right out of the Morganville High yearbook, inset as a graphic into a tombstone.  
  
  With crudely drawn-in fangs.  
  
  ""Captain Obvious never comes out and tells anyone to kill,"" Michael said. ""He's pretty careful about how he phrases things. "" Her friend was angry, Claire saw. And scared. ""He's got our address listed. And all your names, too, though he at least he points out none of you are really vampires. Jesus. That's not good. "" Michael was getting past the shock of seeing himself outed in the paper, and was getting worried. Claire was already there.  
  
  ""Well . . . why don't the vampires do something about him? Stop him?""  
  
  ""They've tried. They've arrested three people in the last two years and said they were Captain Obvious. Turned out they didn't know anything. The Captain could teach the CIA a thing or two about running a secret operation. ""  
  
  ""So he's not that obvious,"" Claire said.  
  
  ""I think he means it in the ironic sense. "" Michael swallowed a quick gulp of coffee. ""Claire, I don't like this. Not like we didn't have enough trouble without this kind of -- ""  
  
  Eve slammed in the kitchen door, which hit the wall with a thunderous boom, startling both of them. She clomped across the kitchen floor, and leaned on the breakfast table. She wasn't very Goth today; her hair was still matte-block, but it was worn back in a simple ponytail, and the plain knit shirt and black pants didn't have a skull anywhere in view. No makeup, either. She almost looked . . . normal. Which was so wrong.  
  
  ""All right,"" she said, and slapped down a second copy of The Fang Report in front of Michael. ""Please tell me you have a snappy comeback for this. ""  
  
  ""I'll make sure the three of you are safe. ""  
  
  ""Oh, so not what I was looking for! Look, I'm not worried about us! We're not the ones Photoshopped into tombstones!"" Eve looked at the picture again. ""Although yes, better dead than that hairdo . . . God, was that your prom photo?""  
  
  Michael grabbed the paper back and put it face down on the table. ""Eve, nothing is going to happen. Captain Obvious just loves to talk. Nobody's going to come after me. ""  
  
  ""Right,"" a new voice said. It was Shane. He'd come in behind Eve, clearly wanting to watch the fireworks, and now he leaned against the wall next to the stove and crossed his arms. ""By all means, let's keep on shoveling the bull,"" he said. ""It's trouble, and you know it. "" Claire waited for him to come over to the table and join the three of them, the way things used to be.  
  
  He didn't. He crossed his arms. Shane hadn't willingly stayed long in the same room with Michael since . . . the change. And he wouldn't look at him, except in angles and side glances. He'd also taken to wearing one of Eve's silver crosses, although just now it was hidden beneath the neck of the gray t-shirt he was wearing. Claire found her eyes fixing on the just-visible outline of it.  
  
  Eve ignored Shane; her big, dark eyes were fixed on Michael. ""You know they'll all be gunning for you now, right? All the would-be Buffys?"" Claire had seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but she had no idea how Eve had managed; it was contraband in Morganville, along with every other movie or book featuring vampires. Or vampire-killing, more to the point. Internet downloads were strictly controlled, too, though no doubt there was a hot black market in those kinds of things that Eve was tapped into.  
  
  ""Like you?"" Michael said. He still hadn't forgotten the arsenal of stakes and crosses that Eve kept hidden in her room. In the old days, that had seemed like good sense, living in Morganville. Now, it seemed like a recipe for domestic violence.  
  
  Eve looked stricken. ""I'd never -- ""  
  
  ""I know. "" He took her hand gently in his. ""I know. ""  
  
  She softened, but then she shook it off and went back to frowning at him. ""Look, this is dangerous. They know you're an easier target than those other guys, and they're going to hate you even worse, because you're one of us. Our age. ""  
  
  ""Maybe,"" Michael said. ""Eve, come on, sit. Sit down. ""  
  
  She did, but it was more like a collapse, and she didn't stop jittering her heel up and down in agitation, or drumming her black-painted fingernails on the table. ""This is bad,"" she said. ""You know that, right? Nine point five on the ten point scale of make-me-yak. ""  
  
  ""Compared to what?"" Shane asked. ""We're already living with the enemy. What does that score? Not to mention you probably get extra points for banging him -- ""  
  
  Michael stood up so fast his chair tipped and hit the floor with a clatter. Shane straightened up, ready for trouble, fists clenched.  
  
  ""Shut up, Shane,"" Michael said, deathly quiet. ""I mean it. ""  
  
  Shane stared past him at Eve. ""He's going to bite you. He can't help it, and once he starts, he won't stop, he'll kill you. But you know that, right? What is that, some freak-ass Goth idea of romantic suicide? You turning into a fang-banger?""  
  
  ""Butt out, Shane. What you know about Goth culture, you got from old episodes of The Munsters and your Aryan Brotherhood dad. "" Great, now Eve was angry, too. That left Claire the only sane one in the room.  
  
  Michael made an effort to dial it  
back. ""Come on, Shane. Leave her alone. You're the one hurting her, not me. ""  
  
  Shane's gaze snapped to Michael and focused. Hard. ""I don't hurt girls. You say I do, and you'd better back it up, asshole. ""  
  
  Shane pushed away from the wall, because Michael was taking steps in his direction. Claire watched, wide-eyed and frozen.  
  
  Eve got between them, hands outstretched to hold both of them back. ""Come on, guys, you don't want to do this. ""  
  
  ""Kinda do,"" Shane said coolly.  
  
  ""Fine. Either hit each other or get a room,"" she snapped, and stepped out of the middle. ""Just don't pretend it's all about protecting the itty widdle girl, because it isn't. It's about the two of you. So get it together, or leave, I don't care which. ""  
  
  Shane stared at her for a second, eyes gone wide and oddly hurt, then looked at Claire. She didn't move.  
  
  ""I'm out,"" he said. He turned and walked out through the kitchen door. It swung shut behind him.  
  
  Eve let out a little gasp. ""I didn't think he'd go,"" she said, so unsteadily that for a second Claire thought she was going to cry. ""What a freaking idiot. ""  
  
  Claire reached over and took her hand. Eve squeezed, hard, and then leaned back into Michael's embrace. Vampire or not, the two of them seemed happy, and anyway, this was Michael. She just couldn't understand Shane's anger. It seemed to bubble up when she least expected it, for no reason at all.  
  
  ""I'd better -- "" she ventured. Michael nodded.  
  
  Claire slipped out of her chair and went to find Shane. Not like it was difficult; he was slumped on the couch, staring at the Playstation screen and working the controls on yet another zombie-killing adventure. ""You taking his side?"" Shane asked, and splattered the head of an attacking undead monster.  
  
  ""No,"" Claire said, and settled in carefully next to him, with enough open space between so he didn't feel pressured. ""Why are there sides, anyway?""  
  
  ""What?""  
  
  ""Michael's your friend, he's our housemate. Why do there have to be sides?""  
  
  He snapped his fingers. ""Um, wait, I've got this one . . . because he's a bloodsucking, night-crawling leech who used to be my friend?""  
  
  ""Shane -- ""  
  
  ""You think you know, but you don't. He's going to change. They all change. Maybe it'll take time, I don't know. Right now, he thinks he's just human plus, but that's not what it is. He's human minus. And you'd better not forget it. ""  
  
  She stared at him, a little bit stunned and a whole lot saddened. ""Eve's right. That sounds like your father talking. ""  
  
  Shane flinched, paused the game, and threw the controller down. ""Low, Claire. "" He wasn't exactly his dad's biggest fan at the best of times -- he couldn't be, the number of cruel things his dad had done to him.  
  
  ""No, it's just true. Look, it's Michael. Can't you give him the benefit of the doubt? He hasn't hurt anybody, has he? And you have to admit, having a vampire on our side, really on our side, couldn't hurt. Not in Morganville. ""  
  
  He just glared at the screen, jaw set like stone. Claire was trying to think of another way to get through to him, but she was derailed by the ringing of the doorbell. Shane didn't move. ""I'll get it,"" she sighed, and went down the hall to open the front door. It was safe enough -- mid-morning, sunny, and relatively mild. Summer was finally starting a slide toward fall, now that it had burned all the green out of the Texas landscape.  
  
  Claire squinted against the brilliance. For a second she thought that there was something deeply wrong with her eyes.  
  
  Because her arch-enemy and Queen Bitch Monica Morrell, flanked by her ever-present harpies Gina and Jennifer, were standing on the doorstep. It was like seeing Barbie and her friends, blown up life size and dressed like Old Navy mannequins. Tanned, toned and perfect, from lip gloss to toenail polish. Monica had forced on a determinedly pleasant expression. Gina and Jennifer were also trying, but looked more like they were smelling something rotten.  
  
  ""Hi!"" Monica said brightly. ""Got plans today, Claire? I was thinking we could hang. ""  
  
  That's it, Claire thought. I'm dreaming. Only this is a nightmare, right? Monica pretending to be my friend? Definitely a nightmare.  
  
  ""I -- what do you want?"" Because Claire's relationship with Monica, Gina and Jennifer had started with being pushed down stairs at the dorm, and hadn't improved since. She was a crawling bug, to the Cool Girls. At best. Or . . . a tool. Was this about Michael? Because his status had changed from ""hermit musician"" to ""hottie vampire"" in one night, and Monica was definitely a fang-banger, right? ""You want to talk to Michael?""  
  
  Monica gave her an odd look. ""Why would I want to do that? Can he go shopping in broad daylight?""  
  
  ""Oh. "" She had no idea what else to say to that.  
  
  ""I thought a little retail therapy, and then we can all go study,"" Monica said. ""We're going to check out that new place, not Common Grounds. Common Grounds is so last century. Like I want to be under Oliver's thumb all the time. Now that he's taken over as Protector for our family, he's been all hands-on, wanting to see my grades. Sucks, right?""  
  
  ""I -- ""  
  
  ""C'mon, save my life. I really need help with Economics, and these two are boneheads. "" Monica dismissed her two closest friends with an offhand wave. ""Seriously. Come with us. Please? I could really use your brainpower. And I think we should get to know each other a little better, don't you? Seeing as how things have changed?""  
  
  Claire opened her mouth, then closed it without saying anything. The last two times she'd gone anywhere with Monica, she'd been flat on her back on the floor of a van, getting beaten and terrorized.  
  
  She managed to stammer, ""I know this is going to sound rude, but --what the hell are you doing?""  
  
  Monica sighed and looked -- how weird was this? -- contrite. ""I know what you're thinking. Yes, I was a bitch to you, and I hurt you. And I'm sorry. "" Gina and Jennifer, her constant Greek chorus, nodded and repeated sorry in whispers. ""Water under the bridge, all right? All is forgiven?""  
  
  Claire was, if anything, even more mystified. ""Why are you doing this?""  
  
  Monica pursed her glossy lips, leaned forward, and dropped her voice to a low, confidential tone. ""Well . . . all right, yeah, it's not like I had a head injury or something and woke up thinking you were cool. But you're different now. I can help. I can introduce you around to all the people you really need to know. ""  
  
  ""You're kidding. I'm different how?""  
  
  Monica leaned even closer. ""You signed. ""  
  
  So . . . this wasn't about Michael. Claire had just become . . . popular. Because she'd become Amelie's property.  
  
  And that was terrifying.  
  
  ""Oh,"" she managed, and then, more slowly, ""Oh. ""  
  
  ""Trust me,"" Monica said. ""You need somebody in the know. Somebody to show you the ropes. ""  
  
  If the only other person left on the planet was Jack the Ripper, Claire would have trusted him first. ""Sorry,"" she said. ""I have plans. But -- thank you. Maybe some other time. ""  
  
  She shut the door on Monica's surprised face, then locked it. She jumped when she turned to find Shane standing right behind her, staring at her like he'd never seen her before.  
  
  ""Thank you?"" he mimicked. ""You're thanking that bitch? For what, Claire? For beating you? For trying to kill you? For killing my sister? Christ. First Michael, then you. I don't know any of you anymore. ""  
  
  In true Shane fashion, he just took off. She listened to the heavy tread of his footsteps cross the living room and travel up the stairs. Heard the familiar slam of his door.  
  
  ""Hey!"" she shouted after him. ""I was just being polite!""Chapter Two  
  
   
  
  ""So,"" Eve asked as she drove Claire to school, ""what was up with the Monica thing? I mean, maybe you ought to watch your back with her. Even more than you already do. ""  
  
  ""She sounded like she really kind of meant it. It took a lot for her to come eat crow like that. ""  
  
  Eve shot her a look. One of those looks, doubly effective coming from a girl wearing rice-powder makeup and flawless eye liner and black cherry lips. ""In Monica's world, being friends means doing whatever Monica wants, when Monica wants to do it. Somehow, I can't see you as one of her brain-dead backup singers. ""  
  
  ""No! That's not -- I didn't say I was going to be her friend, just -- you asked. "" Claire crossed her arms and settled back in the bucket seat of Eve's ancient black Caddy, shooting for a stubborn look. ""She's not my friend, okay? You're my friend. ""  
  
  ""So when Monica starts bringing the in-crowd to hang at your study table, you'll get up and leave? No way. You're too nice. Before you know it, you're tagging along with them, and then you start to actually feel sorry for them. You'll tell me how Monica's not bad, she's just misunderstood, and before you know it you're braiding each others' hair and giggling over boy bands. ""  
  
  Claire made a retching sound. ""I wouldn't do that. ""  
  
  ""Please. You like everybody. You even like me. You like Shane, and let's face it, Shane's kind of an idiot, at least right now. "" Eve's eyes narrowed as she thought about that. ""And about Shane, I swear, if he doesn't snap out of it I'm going to punch him in the face. Well, punch him in the face and then run like hell. ""  
  
  Claire played that out in her head, and nearly laughed. Eve's best possible punch wouldn't do more than surprise Shane, she figured, but she could just picture the wounded look of confusion on his face. What the hell did I do?  
  
  ""I'm not popular,"" she declared. ""Monica's not my friend, and I'm not hanging with her, ever, end of story. ""  
  
  ""Swear?""  
  
  Claire held up her hand. ""Swear. ""  
  
  ""Huh. "" Eve didn't sound convinced. ""Whatev. ""  
  
  ""Look, if we're friends, how about buying me a mocha?""  
  
  ""Mooch. ""  
  
  ""You're the one with the job. ""  
  
  \###  
  
  Mid-afternoon, and it was raining, which was kind of a rarity -- a cold early fall rain that came down in glittering sheets. Claire, like about ninety percent of the other students, hadn't thought to bring an umbrella, so she sloshed along miserably along the Quadrangle, past the empty benches and rain-soaked message boards, toward her Chem Lab. She loved Chem Lab. She hated rain. She hated being soaked to the skin and frankly, living in this part of Texas, it wasn't usually that much of a risk. There was no room in her backpack for anything frivolous, like a raincoat. She worried her books were getting soggy, but the backpack was supposed to be waterproof . . .  
  
  ""You look cold,"" said a voice from behind her, and then the cold rain cut off, and she heard the hollow thump of raindrops hitting the thin skin of an umbrella. Claire looked up, blinked water out of her eyes, and saw she was walking under a golf umbrella big enough for four or five of her . . . or one of her, plus the guy holding the umbrella. Because he was huge. Also, cute, in that big-boned football player kind of way. He would have made Shane look small. Well-proportioned, though, so the height (had to be at least 6'5"", Claire thought) and weight just seemed right on him. He had chocolate-brown skin and gorgeous brown eyes, and he seemed . . . kind of nice.  
  
  ""I'm Jerome,"" he said. ""Hey. ""  
  
  ""Hey,"" she said back, still amazed that somebody who was clearly somebody would stop to hang an umbrella over her head. ""Thanks. Um, I'm Claire. Hi. ""  
  
  She juggled her dripping backpack to her other hand and offered him her right. He took it and shook. His was about three times as large, big enough (she bet) to cup most of an entire football.  
  
  He was wearing a TPU athletic department t-shirt. No mystery about his major.  
  
  ""Where you heading, Claire?""  
  
  ""Chem Lab,"" she said, and pointed at the building, which was about a football field length away, on the other side of the Quad. He nodded and steered that direction. ""Look, it's nice of you, but you don't have to -- ""  
  
  ""It's no problem. "" He smiled at her. He had dimples. ""I hear the ScienceBuilding is nice this time of year. And anything for a friend. ""  
  
  ""But I'm not -- ""  
  
  Jerome nodded to a group of girls standing huddled together under the awning of the Language Arts building. Pretty girls. In the center of them was Monica Morrell, and she blew Jerome a flirty sort of kiss.  
  
  ""Oh,"" Claire said. ""That friend. "" Her estimate of Jerome fell by several dozen notches, hit bottom, and started digging for China. ""Look, I appreciate it, but I'm not sugar. I won't melt. ""  
  
  She veered away and walked fast. Jerome took about two long strides and put the umbrella over her again without comment. She glared at him.  
  
  He lifted an eyebrow. ""I can play this game this all day. ""  
  
  ""Fine,"" she said. ""But I don't need favors from Monica. ""  
  
  ""Girl, it's an umbrella, not a Lamborghini,"" he pointed out. Way too reasonably. ""I'm not even lending it to you. It's not really that much of a favor. ""  
  
  She kept her mouth shut, head down, and walked fast. Jerome stopped at the foot of the Science Building's stairs, and she bounded up and darted under the concrete porch, which was already choked with other students hiding from the rain. She looked back down. Jerome smiled and waved, and a bronze or copper bracelet caught her eye.  
  
  He was Protected. Probably a native of Morganville.  
  
  ""I'm not her friend. That was not my fault,"" she complained, defending herself to an Eve who wasn't even there.  
  
  And then she sneezed, sniffled, and dragged her soggy butt to class.  
  
  \###  
  
  The rain kept up all day and all night, but the next day dawned bright and shiny, with a pale silver sun not quite as fierce as Claire expected. Kind of nice, actually. She'd already showered by the time Eve stumbled into the bathroom, looking more like the walking dead than most vampires, mumbled something, and ignored Claire as she started up the shower again. Claire finished at the sink and hurried down the stairs. She found Michael at the coffeepot, emptying the filter of cold grounds. Deeply weird that he was more of a morning person as a vampire. Maybe he was just enjoying having a morning again, instead of becoming a floaty ghost at dawn.  
  
  ""Eve's up. You'd better make it so dark the spoon melts. ""  
  
  Michael shot her a half-smile, still almost lethal enough to stop a girl's heart. Luckily he knew just how much current to use on his charm. ""That bad, huh?""  
  
  She thought about it for a second as she took down a bowl, the box of Rice Krispies, and found the milk behind the bottles of beer --contraband, from Shane -- in the fridge. ""You've seen that movie where the zombies eat people's brains?""  
  
  ""Night of the Living Dead?""  
  
  ""The zombies would run if they got a look at her. ""  
  
  Michael spooned extra coffee into the fresh filter. He looked good, she thought. Strong, tall, confident. He had on a nice blue shirt and some not-so-ratty blue jeans, and he was wearing shoes. Running shoes, sure, but shoes. Claire stared at his feet. ""You're going out,"" she said.  
  
  ""Got a job,"" Michael said serenely. ""Working at JT's Music over on Third Street, ten to close. Mostly I'll be demoing guitars and selling them, but JT said he'd let me do some private lessons if I wanted. ""  
  
  That was so . . . normal. Really normal. Claire bit her lip and tried to organize the explosion of questions in her brain. ""Ah -- what about the sun?"" she asked. Because that seemed to be the first hurdle.  
  
  ""They issued me a car,"" Michael said. ""It's in the garage. Fully sunproofed. And there's underground parking at JT's. There is most places. ""  
  
  ""Issued -- who issued you a car?"" He shot her a you're not stupid look. ""The town? Amelie?""  
  
  He didn't answer directly as he slid the filter compartment shut and turned on the brew switch. The machine began wheezing and peeing into the pot. ""They tell  
me it's standard procedure,"" he said. ""For new vampires. ""  
  
  ""Not there have been any for fifty years, right?""  
  
  He shrugged. It was obvious that she was making him uncomfortable with the questions, but Claire couldn't help herself. ""Michael --did they get you the job, too?""  
  
  ""No. I know JT. I got the job all by myself. They offered -- "" He stopped, clearly thinking he'd already said too much.  
  
  Claire finished it out, guessing. ""They offered you some kind of job in the vampire community. Right? Or -- "" Oh, God. ""Or they offered to make you a Protector?""  
  
  ""Not right off the bat,"" he said, still staring at the coffee maker. ""You have to work up to that. So they say. ""  
  
  Michael. Owning people. Skimming off of their wages like some Mafia don. She tried not to let him see how sick that idea made her feel, that he'd ever really consider doing it.  
  
  His eyes suddenly cut toward her, as if he'd read her mind. ""I didn't do it. I took the job at JT's, Claire,"" Michael said, and suddenly moved toward her. She flinched, and he took a deep breath and held out his hand in clear apology. ""Sorry. I forget sometimes -- it's hard, okay, learning how to move around people when I can go so much faster. But I wouldn't hurt you, Claire. No way. ""  
  
  ""Shane thinks -- ""  
  
  Light caught and flared in Michael's eyes, eerie and frightening, and then he blinked and it was gone. He obviously made a real effort to keep his voice quiet. ""Shane's wrong,"" he said. ""I'm not changing, Claire. I'm still your friend. I'll look after you. All of you. Even Shane. ""  
  
  She didn't answer him. Truthfully, as much as she liked him -- and it verged on love -- she felt something different about him today. Something complicated and agitated and strange.  
  
  Was he . . . hungry? He was staring at her. No, he was staring at the thin skin of her neck, wasn't he? Claire put her hand to it, involuntary but irresistible, and Michael got a very slight pink flush in his pale cheeks and looked away.  
  
  ""I wouldn't,"" he said, in a far different tone than before. It almost sounded scared to her. ""I wouldn't, Claire. You have to believe me. But -- this is hard. It's so hard. ""  
  
  She did believe him, mostly because she could hear all the heartbreak and sorrow in his voice. She took a breath, stepped forward, and hugged him. He was tall, the top of her head only brushed his chin. His arms felt strong and comforting, and she told herself that he wasn't warm because it was chilly in the kitchen. It wasn't really true, but that helped.  
  
  ""I wouldn't hurt you,"" he murmured. ""But I've got to admit, I want to. I spent all my life hating vampires, and now -- now look at me. ""  
  
  ""You had to,"" Claire said. ""You didn't have a choice. ""  
  
  She felt his sigh go through both of them. ""Yeah,"" he said, ""Shane's right, I did have a choice. But this is the choice I made, and now I have to live with it. ""  
  
  He let go when she stepped back. Neither of them knew what to say, so Claire busied herself by opening kitchen cabinets to get down the four mismatched cups they used in the morning. Michael's was plain chunky stoneware, oversized, like a diner cup on steroids. Eve's was a petite black thing with a yawning cartoon vampire on it. Shane's had a happy face with a bloody bullet hole in the center of its forehead. Claire had taken one with Goofy and Mickey on it.  
  
  ""How's school?"" Michael asked. Neutral subjects. He didn't want to talk it out, he wanted to keep it inside. She wasn't too surprised. Michael had always been too self-contained for his own good, as far as she could tell.  
  
  ""Too easy,"" she sighed, and poured coffee.  
  
  They were sitting down and sipping from their mugs when the kitchen door opened, and Shane -- wearing pajama bottoms and a ratty old faded t-shirt -- came into the kitchen. He avoided Michael, picked up his cup off the counter, and filled it to the brim. He left without a word.  
  
  Michael watched him go, face set and hard.  
  
  Claire felt the need to apologize. ""He's just -- ""  
  
  ""I know,"" Michael said. ""Believe me. I know exactly how Shane is. Doesn't mean I have to like it right now. ""  
  
  I really need to stop being the Glass Goodwill Ambassador, Claire thought, but she knew she'd keep on doing it. Somebody had to, after all. So after she'd finished her coffee, she went to talk to Shane.  
  
  Shane's door was unlocked and slightly open. Claire pushed it and stepped inside, then stopped short. All her carefully prepared speeches flew right out of her head, because Shane was getting dressed.  
  
  The sight of him short-circuited her thought processes and completely grounded her better judgment. He'd already hauled on his blue jeans, and his back was to her. No shirt yet. She was spellbound by the ripples of muscles on his back, the gorgeous smoothness of his skin, the way his shaggy hair brushed the tops of his shoulders and begged to be smoothed back . . .  
  
  The sound of his zipper being pulled up snapped her back to sanity. She stepped hastily back, out into the hall, and pulled the door almost shut, then knocked.  
  
  ""What?"" It wasn't a friendly response.  
  
  ""It's me,"" she said. ""Can I come in?""  
  
  She heard something halfway between a grunt and a sigh, and opened the door to find him dragging a dark gray, form-fitting shirt over his head. It looked very good on him. Not as good as the no-shirt thing, but she was trying hard not to think about that. It had made her warm and fluttery inside.  
  
  ""Is that a new shirt?"" she asked, desperate to get her mind off the vivid mental pictures that kept bubbling up. That got another indefinite grunt. ""It looks nice. ""  
  
  Shane gave her an ironic look. ""We're talking clothes now? Wait, let me get my Fashion for Dummies book. ""  
  
  ""I -- never mind. About Michael -- ""  
  
  ""Stop. "" Shane stepped forward and kissed her on the forehead. ""I know, you don't want me ripping him, but I can't help it. Give me some time, okay? I need to figure some things out. ""  
  
  Claire tipped her head back, and this time he found her lips. It was, she thought, supposed to be a fast and sweet little kiss, but somehow it slowed down, got warmer and deeper. His lips were damp and soft as silk, and that was such a contrast to the hard lines of his body pressed against her. The strength of his hands sliding around her waist and pulling her even closer. She heard him growl low in his throat, a wild and hungry sound that made her go weak and faint.

This is my last first post here and I feel comfort being able to talk about my problems. I am a 35yo male. I just had my 4th afib episode ever on Thursday morning. I was in afib for about 6 hours and converted with flecainide at the hospital. My first episode was in 2019 and I have two more each about a year apart. During those episodes I had been drinking or smoking or doing something that triggered the episodes. I’ve been sober for a year now and have been at the gym a lot recently. I’ll admit my sleep is not what it should be lately and I have one cup of coffee a day. I’m not sure exactly why my afib got trigged again but this time they put me on eliquis and they want me to take it for 4 weeks. I have no family history of heart disease and all my bloodwork was good. 

Now that I’m home I feel like I’m having some symptoms maybe this is how it feels to recover I don’t know because it’s been so long. My chest just feels kinda weird and I have a slight anxiety, little aches and pains. I’m wondering has anyone else experienced this? How do you guys deal with having episodes like this?

1m6zxvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dallasurbanists/comments/1m6zxvg/8_tips_for_navigating_dallas_without_a_car_during/,8 Tips for Navigating Dallas Without a Car During Week Without Driving 2025,"Are you considering participating in the annual [Week Without Driving](https://weekwithoutdriving.org) challenge, taking place from September 29 to October 5 this year? Or are you simply curious about what your neighborhood or city might look like from a new perspective?

Navigating a city without a car is a learned skill—especially for many Texans accustomed to driving as their only mode of transportation. Just as earning a driver’s license requires months of instruction and practice, learning to move through the city by walking, cycling, and taking public transit requires conscious effort and adaptation.

Here are eight practical tips for anyone learning to navigate Dallas without a car for the first time:

# 1. SHOP LOCAL.

When I owned a car and drove everywhere, a simple search for “cool coffee shops in DFW” often drove me 20 or 30 miles into distant suburbs, chasing social media recommendations. Now, after nearly four years without a car, I intentionally support businesses located in my neighborhood—or those that are easily accessible by public transit. Shopping locally not only builds community but also reduces unnecessary travel.

# 2. BUNDLE NEARBY TRIPS.

When I had a car, I rarely planned my errands intentionally; I ran them whenever the mood struck. This often meant spending hours in traffic, zigzagging across the city. Without a car, I’ve learned to trip-chain—bundling errands in the same neighborhood on the same day, and spreading out more distant errands over multiple days. This strategy reduces travel time and makes daily life more manageable.

# 3. COMBINE MODES.

When searching for transit directions on Google Maps, remember that estimated trip times usually assume you’ll walk between transit stops. But you can also bring a bicycle or scooter on any DART bus or train—and even on GoLink vans. Combining modes, like biking to a bus stop or taking a scooter on a train, can reduce trip times and unlock flexible, creative options that aren’t possible with a single mode of travel.

# 4. INVOLVE YOUR COMMUNITY.

Say you finish work at 5:00 PM and have an event at 6:30 PM. Public transit might get you there on time—but what if you need to feed your dog (or bird, or cat) first? Going car-free requires more than just logistical skills; it also calls for resourceful relationships. Instead of paying thousands on a car, you might pay your neighbor a visit to ask for help when you’re in a pinch.

# 5. MANAGE EXPECTATIONS.

This is a tip I still struggle with, but it applies whether you drive, bike, or take transit: communicate if there's a risk of being late. Let others know if you might miss a bus or train. As a society, we’ve learned to accommodate people delayed by car traffic; we should extend the same understanding to those navigating public transit, which is also subject to delays—sometimes caused by traffic itself.

# 6. CHOOSE WELL-CONNECTED LOCATIONS.

Imagine you and a friend are choosing between two restaurants. One is served by a single bus route every 20 to 30 minutes. The other is served by two bus routes, each running every 15 to 20 minutes. Choosing destinations with multiple transit options increases your chances of arriving on time and reduces the stress of waiting.

# 7. HAVE A BACKUP ROUTE.

This tip builds on the previous ones: when planning a trip, don’t rely solely on the first suggested route. Review the second and third options, too. Bringing a bike can greatly expand your backup plans. When estimating travel time, consider aiming for an earlier departure—if you miss your first bus, you’ll still have time to catch the next one and stay on schedule.

# 8. REFLECT ON YOUR ITINERARY.

I’ll admit—punctuality has never been my strength. But I was even worse when I drove. Owning a car encouraged me to overcommit, believing I could be everywhere. Going car-free didn’t magically make me punctual, but it did force me to ask harder questions: Did I need to attend every event? Was it worth traveling so far? If something is happening two hours away, was it really meant for me to begin with?

If you're like I was when I first gave up driving, the *Week Without Driving* challenge may reveal a hidden cost of car dependence: lifestyle creep—the gradual expansion of commitments, distance, and expectations that only a car can sustain.",1,1753245175.0,dallasurbanists,0,1.0,False
1m6zx9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIBeingTooSensitive/comments/1m6zx9w/male_friend_being_creepy/,Male friend being creepy?,"I (19F) have a friend (33M, we’ll call him Fred) who recently has been weird. The age gap already might be suspect, but for context we’ve been friends for a bit under a year and met at a con. So we share a hobby and it’s a really big part of both of our lives. 

More important context: I’m a lesbian and have been in a relationship with my GF (22F) for 2 years. The entire time I’ve known Fred I’ve been in this relationship and he’s also friends with GF. We all met at the same time at the same con.

Our friendship has been nothing but platonic for the entirety of the time we’ve known each other. Occasionally we joke about nsfw topics, but it’s always very impersonal and is immature (think stupid dick jokes). We hang out pretty often, and since he makes way more money than me he usually treats me to food/coffee. I draw for him to make up for it.

A couple days ago I went to stay with him for a night because GF and I have been having a lot of issues that Fred knows about. His opinion of GF is unfavorable now and he often implied we should break up, despite me reiterating multiple times that we aren’t going to do that and that this is just a rough patch that is being worked through. 

While I was there, we talked in his room for a while before both going to bed. As he was leaving, he hugged me and said “Let me know if you want to cuddle, Lord knows I could use it too.” I thought that was a little weird but not necessarily creepy. Didn’t take him up on it obviously. 

While he was taking me home, he asked to see my hands. I did one of these 🙌 but showing the backs of my hands. He said “Oh, you wouldn’t be able to claw my back like I want you to” which immediately grossed me out hard. He then told me that he had a dream about this. I found it weird that he told me this at all because previously things like this he’s said are “inside Fred thoughts”. An example of one of these iFt’s was when I asked if I was going to be the only girl at his DND group he invited me to. He said I wouldn’t even have had the biggest tits. That was more funny and less creepy because it’s pretty obvious I have a large chest and I joke about it from time to time.

I can’t stop thinking about the interaction though, and it makes me feel so gross every time it pops up in my head. Like a pretty visceral reaction. I’m worried he might’ve been joking and just…bad at it? Or it didn’t come out right or something? Am I being sensitive?

I work in the arts back in L.A., so I’m curious about how Mérida does things when it comes to parks, events, and live programming. I checked out Secretaría de la Cultura y las Artes as a starting point, but open to anything interesting or unexpected.

Design-wise, I’m a sucker for good **architecture and color palettes**. That’s part of why I want to visit the water garden in **Izamal** ,  it looks amazing. Thinking of just winging it and showing up, but open to tips if I should plan ahead.

Also hoping to check out **Cenotes Hacienda Mucuyché** and get a beach day in — maybe **Progreso**? I’m wondering if it’s better to take a bus or rent a car for those day trips. Would love any insight.

I speak Spanish (born in Oaxaca, based in L.A.) and usually just stumble into good food, but if you have a place you *love*, let me know! I bookmarked a few seafood places (pescatarian here).

1m6zv17,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1m6zv17/first_date_review_good/,First Date Review (Good!),"Background Info
- He’s an engineer (it seems like the ""socially awkward"" stereotype holds true for him, as far as I can tell). He said that he’s happiest when he can put his headphones in, listen to music, and work on his job. 
- He is very sweet, but super introverted and like I mentioned earlier, a tad socially awkward. I’m also introverted, so I can understand where he’s coming from on some things. 
- We’re both in our early 30s 
- Met via OLD. I asked him for our first date (we had been messaging for a bit, and I wanted to see if we were compatible or not). 


Green Flags/Pros
- The basics: He’s super smart, has a great (super tough) job, attractive, polite, and has a house. (I also have a good job and a house). We actually live less than 5 minutes away from each other.
- First date went well! We spent four hours together and had a few moments of silence. I led the conversation, but I think he’s just a quiet guy. He said that he isn’t a great conversationalist, but I could tell that he was trying his best.
- Even though I asked him on the date, he insisted on paying. He didn’t even like what we were doing (he doesn’t drink coffee) and he suggested we go to my favorite pizza place for our second date (I mentioned the place super briefly during the first date and he doesn’t really like pizza!). I find little gestures like that to be super thoughtful.
- He walked to me to my car even though his was parked far away in the opposite direction, it was in broad daylight, and it was 105 degrees out. I had a date once not walk me to my car when I was parked far away and it was pitch black out, so this gesture was a big green flag for me. 
- A nerdy stereotype (sorry), but he doesn’t play any video games! The last 2 engineers I’ve dated spend hours each day playing video games. 
- Not weird, but he’s never had social media of any kind. He said that he just never got into it.


Yellow Flags
- We don’t have a ton in common.
- I asked him on the first date, I initiated exchanging numbers, and I also initiated the second date when I sent him the post-date thank you text. I don’t know if it’s lack of initiative or that he just doesn’t really know what to do or say.
- All tied together: His experience with women (dating, anything physical, etc.)/social life/hobbies are basically non-existent. I was his first app date, despite him having a profile since January, and he admits he has no friends, which isn't surprising given his background. His intense focus on engineering degrees, poor texting habits, being really shy, lack of any social media, 55+ hour work weeks, and not really putting himself out there/staying at home could explain why. Throughout college, he commuted and juggled two jobs while studying engineering. He moved out of state at the start of COVID and seems to have kept to himself ever since, describing his routine as simply going to work, coming home, and watching TV. It's hard to tell if this is due to exhaustion from a stressful job or a that he just doesn’t have anyone to do things with.
- It sounds like he is super close with his family, like spends a whole day or more each weekend with them. I don’t know if he spends time with just his parents or if his siblings join as well. I don’t know if it’s just because they’re super close or that spending time with them is his social outlet. He’s the second oldest out of 4 boys, and his brothers are all super athletic and outgoing (think hockey frat bro). His dad sounds like a big tough guy, so I wonder if he was kind of the lonely nerdy kid that wasn’t included. 
- Lack of communication. He said that he prefers to text only to ask quick questions. He would rather talk on the phone. After we arranged our dates, we haven’t texted/messaged since. This is super unusual for me - but maybe it’s not a bad thing? Again, he’s an engineer, so it might follow the very logical/rational way of thinking. Also, if he doesn’t have any friends or girls to text, he might never have gotten into texting?

I gotta say thank you for your patience in teaching me the lessons I still needed to learn. I no longer rely on anyone for anything. I no longer want a business partner, I can do it on my own I'm not afraid! I am capable! I no longer rely on someone to be in my bed only to have them promising the world as they walk out the door. After the door closes and um alone to sit in thought, when I should have been curled up in your arms. We should have woken together drank a coffee in our pj's before work. If it was a day off, we should've gone for a hike, fishing, a drive.... something! But ""no"" you didnt want to. 

I felt like you never wanted to be seen with me. Looking back on it, you could've had a wife and family. You never introduced me to your family. I stopped sending them planters, because I thought wtf am I doing spending $60 on people i dont even know and who obviously dont care to kknow me. I'm sure you told them something horrible about me. I'm sure all your friends think I'm horrible too. Oh well, I realize a person who doesn't ike someone who they don't even know based on another person's opinion is someone who's thoughts are not worth caring about. 

I found you to be captivating, charming, funny and unique. You attention to detail in all that you see is as sharp as your wit. I fell in love with your gentle, kind, loving soul. You have more love and passion than ive ever known anyone else to have. The fact that you allowed me to see that gentle loving side of you is something I will cherish forever. Thank you for that, I share it with no one. It was the most beautiful experience of my life. Now the tears are flowing down my face, yet the memory also has a big smile on my face. Im not sad anymore, I've learned over the years if your person is the least bit unsure and not wanting to take that leap, then its not gonna get better. If you think im giving up on you, thats not the case at all. If I ever thought I had a chance.... Wrong time, too old, not pretty enough, saggy skin, it doesn't matter. The fact that it does matter to you is a definite confirmation that I should not be chasing this one. Eventhough, I never chase. I was forthright and bold, you were the only one tiptoeing and being skittish. Call it chasing if you need too. I think I'm changing, because I certainly have no desire to spend another minute of my life strok'n Ego. No f---ing way, those days are a thing of the past and have been released. I am caring and nurturing to those who appreciate it. 

I'm also tired of being underestimated. I know ive contributed to that because I was taught to not outshine a sibling. I was always told to tone it down, dont smile so much, dont talk to much, dont sing, dont you dare win at games, nobody likes people who  talk about smart stuff, when they call you ""a know it all"". They are making fun of you, nobody likes a know it all.  So Ive always dummied up, I see and know way more than everyone even cares to know. I keep to myself. I dont hate, I dont even know what that feels like. I always forgive, I stay mad for 7 min, then im good. I go quiet when I get mad and if I dont talk for a bit, its not a punishment. I just struggle to articulate what will match my feelings. I like to have a final goal, my opinion, my ideas for solution, what my job for resolution. So that its not just diarrhea of attacks that spew from my mouth. Its rare that I'll ever raise my voice on anger. I find nothing gets solved in those kinds of spewing fights. Its a redundant waste of both of our time. I understand human behavior way better than most people. Thats why I can always forgive, because I get it. I try not to judge people based on societal norms. However, I hear people say they dont judge, I think we all judge people. Yknow when you meet someone and after a conversation with them, you may think or say to a friend, 'what a creepy guy"" or ""i like her, she's hularious"". I guess its more of judginging based on whether that person could be in your life or not 

Stop wondering why you dont have honest, trustworthy people, who aren't on the take, in your life. Its clearly because you push good people that love and care about you away. Im sure you know that, though. Im sure you even know how to stop doing it. I think you like the drama and chaos. I however do not. I've already had a lifetime of that BS, now I want peace. I want to work hard and travel. I want to lay on a beach for a month every winter. I want to bungee jump, I want to go on a pilgrimage, I want to go on a remote retreat and study meditation and yoga, I want to build a house for a family in Mexico. I want to see wild animals roaming on the Serengti.

I want a partner, a best friend. No tricks, no games and no mind fuckery. I want to be loved just because I'm me. I have had a few nights where I had time alone, all those nights you stood me up, and I realized I am loveable. I love me! Im fun, Im hilarious and always make myself laugh, im nice and forgiving. When I make a mistake and it hurts me or anyone else I apologize, I stand up for me. I dont let other woman put me in the back or dim my light anymore. Those who cant handle me as I am should step aside.

I dont care what kind of super powers you possess. I dont have any, I cant read your mind and um certain I dont want to. So stop thinking that I can. I also do not read reddit thinking I know anyone. Yes, I used to and it effed with my mind so I turned it off. I still have dreams that tell me enough and I can tell when lies are told in a conversation one on one. Thats it. So when you thought you told me and I ignored you. It didnt happen. Your actions gave me nothing positive. 

**This is my reminder of who stays who doesn't just incase you care enough to stay, I'd welcome you with open arms and pour my love all over you and you (that special you know who) could put your love all over me, too!! (wink, wink) **

I refuse to wait and wonder while feeling sick to my stomach for a man all night

I refuse to be treated with disrespect; just because you are  having a bad day

I refuse to be in a relationship with someone that doesn't take responsibility for their actions

I refuse to be with someone who doesn't make amends when needed

I no longer stay quiet when I have something to say

I no longer accept ANYBODY to treat me less than. I am WORTHY

I no longer accept the silent treatment if I have upset you, have enough respect to tell me.

My family is important to me, if you dont have anything nice to say about them, SAY NOTHING at all

Never, try to come between us. If you come up against them, I will turn momma-bear!

Don't put yourself in a position to be second guessed and you won't be. It's easy

Of you want to build trust, be consistently trustworthy

Being mysterious isn't sexy it actually creates distrust

Trying to make your person jealous in the beginning; they will see you as  a player and be turned offĺ",1,1753244639.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1m6zrxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsCalls/comments/1m6zrxr/coca_cola_ko_the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_from/,"Coca Cola (KO): The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly from KO's Earnings Call","\- July 22, 2025

## The Good

- **Organic Revenue Growth**: Delivered 5% organic revenue growth in Q2, in line with their long-term growth algorithm.
- **Margin Expansion & Profitability**: Robust margin expansion (gross margin up 80bps, operating margin up 190bps), and 4% comparable EPS growth despite currency/tax headwinds.
- **Resilient Industry & Value Share Gains**: Seventeenth consecutive quarter of value share gains; industry remains resilient.
- **Strong Performance in Key Markets**: Sequential volume improvement in the US and Europe; strong local execution cited in Africa and China.
- **Marketing & Innovation Success**: Launched successful campaigns like Share a Coke in 120+ countries and innovative products such as Sprite Plus Tea and US cane sugar Coca-Cola.
- **Fairlife Growth**: Fairlife posted double-digit volume growth and is managing capacity constraints with new facilities coming online in 2026.
- **Productivity Initiatives**: Marketing transformation and disciplined cost management drove better-than-expected productivity, allowing reinvestment in growth.
- **Strong Balance Sheet & Free Cash Flow**: Free cash flow (ex-Fairlife payment) was $3.9B, up ~$600M YoY; net debt leverage at 2x EBITDA (low end of target).
- **Updated (Still Solid) Guidance**: Maintained organic revenue growth guidance (5-6%), raised comparable currency-neutral EPS growth target to ~8%.
- **Targeted Recovery Actions**: Demonstrated agility with “all-weather strategy,” quickly pivoting in response to local market disruptions (e.g., weather, geopolitical).
- **Resolution of US Hispanic Consumer Issue**: Targeted advertising and messaging helped recover lost share and restore brand equity among this key demographic.

---

## The Bad

- **Volume Decline**: Overall volume declined 1% in Q2, with notable declines in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and India.
- **Currency & Tax Headwinds**: Significant currency headwinds (5% impact on EPS) and a higher effective tax rate (up ~2pts YoY).
- **Capacity Constraints in Fairlife**: Supply constraints are limiting growth, with incremental volume only possible when new US capacity comes online in 2026.
- **Consumer Pressure in Some Segments**: Noted pressure among lower-income consumers, especially in North America and some emerging markets, requiring more value/affordability initiatives.
- **Mixed Performance in Asia Pacific**: Volume declined in key ASEAN markets (Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam); Japan and South Korea also had volume declines.
- **Geopolitical & Weather Disruptions**: India and Mexico were hit by early monsoons, hurricanes, and regional conflicts, impacting Q2 results and creating uncertainty for recovery timing.
- **Costa Coffee Underperformance**: Costa has not met its investment hypothesis, with growth skewed towards stores and underperformance in ready-to-drink and at-home segments.

---

## The Ugly

- **No Strong Volume Recovery Yet**: Despite optimism, volume growth is not yet back to positive territory, and recovery in some markets (like India and Mexico) remains uncertain and dependent on external factors.
- **Persistent External Uncertainty**: The “dynamic” and “choppy” external environment (economic, weather, geopolitical) is causing rapid shifts in market conditions, making forecasting and strategic planning tougher.
- **Currency Hedging Lag**: While recent currency moves are positive, Coca-Cola’s hedging strategy means benefits will take time to materialize—so FX headwinds persist in the near term.
- **Sustained Headwinds in Key Emerging Markets**: ASEAN region’s “surprising” weakness, Latin America’s continued volume decline, and the slow resolution of India’s issues show pockets of real struggle.
- **Tough Comps Ahead**: Q4 will face tough comparisons in concentrate volume, and the company admits the fourth quarter will have an extra day but still expects challenges.

 I then remembered that there is a TWC Cafe in a 3km distance from home and I decided to order via zomato. Turns out they use stock from 9-May and I am glad the restaurant called me to confirm the order and I told them give me the freshest beans. I was sent a batch of 7-Jun. Mind you, it is still 1.5 months old by the time I received it. The restaurant mentioned they sell on first-in-first-out basis. 
Whatever, i brewed my cup of this Vienna and it tasted of nothing. No flavor, trash coffee. I spent close to 600 rs on this and each time I order TWC, I've had a terrible experience.

Now that BT also roasts and ships from Bengaluru, I wanted to know if there are any decent roasters in Mumbai who sell a bag for 500-600 for 250gm who roast in small batches hence ensuring freshness. ",1,1753244545.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

*Where the Nationals’ pitching staff plays ""Whack-a-Mole"" with Runners, and the Reds Hope to Win Without Actually Trying*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two ERAs**  
The Cincinnati Reds (52-49) enter this matchup as a slight favorite, with moneyline odds hovering around **-150 to -170** (implied probability: \~62.5%–64%). Their starter, **Chase Burns** (0-1, 6.19 ERA), is the definition of a ""work in progress""—he’s struck out 25 batters in 16 ⅓ innings but has also allowed 6.19 runs per game, which is roughly how many times a fan checks their phone during a Nationals’ at-bat.

The Washington Nationals (40-60), meanwhile, are priced at **+215 to +220** (implied probability: \~31.3%–32.5%), a number that feels generous given their **5.27 staff ERA** and **1.415 WHIP** (walks + hits per inning). Their starter, **Brad Lord** (2-5, 3.46 ERA), is a two-inning miracle worker who’s held opponents scoreless in his last two outings—*if “opponents” includes a team of toddler baseballers*.

The total runs line sits at **8.5**, with the Over/Under odds hovering around **EVENS**. Given the Nationals’ porous defense and Burns’ volatility, this feels like a number set by a bookie who’s never seen a Nationals’ infield.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, or ""Why This Team Should Fold Now""**  
The Nationals are a team begging for a plot twist. Their **5.27 ERA** is worse than a college student’s chances of acing a math class after binge-watching Netflix. Recent ""news"" includes:

* **James Wood**, their 24-HR slugger, being spotted *napping in the on-deck circle* during a game. Not metaphorically. With a blanket.
* A **team-wide caffeine shortage**, allegedly caused by a barista union strike. Second baseman **Cory Spangenberg** was overheard saying, “I’d pay $15 for a coffee, but my wallet says ‘No, you’d pay $15 and still feel awful.’”
* A **mystery illness** sweeping through the Nationals’ clubhouse. Symptoms in

  When Rhys and I showed up at my “brother” Matt’s house at eight in the morning, he was happy … in the sense that he was glad that I was alive and hadn’t disappeared forever. Despite being angry, he let me explain everything, while glaring at me the whole time with mystified rage.  
  
  At least I only had to tell to Matt. My aunt Maggie is my legal guardian, but she wasn’t there when we arrived. Matt explained that she had gone off looking for me in Oregon. I have no idea why, but for some reason, she thought I’d run off there.  
  
  As Rhys and I sat on the shabby-chic couch in Matt’s living room, surrounded by the boxes that he had yet to unpack from when we moved in to the house two months ago, Matt paced back and forth in front of us.  
  
  “I still don’t understand.” Matt said. He stopped in front of us, arms folded over his chest.  
  
  “There’s nothing to understand,” I insisted, gesturing at Rhys. “He’s your brother! It’s pretty obvious when you look at him.”  
  
  I have dark, wild curly hair and mahogany eyes. Matt and Rhys both have sandy hair and sapphire eyes. They had something much more open in their faces too, and they had the same easy smile. Rhys stared up at Matt with bemused wonderment, his eyes wide and awed.  
  
  “How could you even possibly know that?” Matt asked.  
  
  “I don’t know why you can’t just trust me.” I sighed and laid my head back on the couch. “I never lie to you!”  
  
  “You just ran away from home! I had no idea where you were. That’s a major trust violation!” Matt yelled.  
  
  His anger couldn’t cover up how hurt he still was, and his body showed signs of the strain he had been under. When I disappeared, he completely collapsed, I’m sure. His face was gaunt and haggard, his eyes red and tired, and he had probably lost ten pounds. I felt guilty, but I hadn’t had a choice.  
  
  Matt was too preoccupied with my safety, a side effect from his mother having tried to kill me and all that. His life revolved around me to the point of being unhealthy. He had no friends, no job, no life of his own.  
  
  “I had to run away! Okay?” I ran a hand through my tangled curls and shook my head. “I can’t explain it to you. I left for my safety and for yours. I don’t know if I should even be here now.”  
  
  “Safety? What were you running from? Where were you?!” Matt asked desperately, not for the first time.  
  
  “Matt, I can’t tell you! I wish I could but I can’t!”  
  
  I’m not sure if it was legal for me to tell him anything about Trylle or not. I assumed everything about them was secret, but nobody had expressly forbidden me from telling outsiders, either. Matt would never believe me, though, so I didn’t see the point in trying.  
  
  “You’re really my brother,” Rhys said in a hushed tone. He leaned forward to get a better look at Matt. “This is so weird.”  
  
  “Yeah, it is,” Matt agreed. He shifted uncomfortably under Rhys’s stare before he turned to me, his expression serious. “Wendy, can I have a word with you? Alone?”  
  
  “Uh, sure.” I looked over at Rhys.  
  
  Taking his cue, Rhys stood up. “Where’s your bathroom?”  
  
  “Down that way, off the kitchen.” Matt pointed to his right.  
  
  Rhys nodded and smiled at him, then walked the direction Matt had pointed. Once he was gone, Matt sat down on the coffee table in front of me and lowered his voice.  
  
  “Look, Wendy, I don’t understand what’s going on. I have no idea how much of what you’ve told me is true, but that kid looks like a total weirdo to me. I don’t want him in my house, and I don’t know what you were thinking bringing him here.”  
  
  “He’s your brother,” I said wearily. “Honest, Matt. I would never, ever lie about something this major. I am one-hundred percent certain that he is your real brother.”  
  
  “Wendy…” Matt rubbed his forehead, sighing. “I get that you believe that. But how could you know that? I think this kid is feeding you a story.”  
  
  “No, he’s really not. Rhys is the most honest person I’ve ever known, except for you. Which makes sense since you are brothers,” I said. “Please. Give him a chance. You’ll see.”  
  
  “What about his family?” Matt asked. “Who has been raising him for the past seventeen and a half years? Don’t they miss him? And aren’t they your ‘real’ family or whatever?”  
  
  “Trust me, they won’t miss him. And I like you better,” I said with a smile, ignoring his questions.  
  
  Matt shook his head, unable to decide what he should make of all this. I knew a large part of him didn’t trust Rhys and wanted to throw him out of the house, so I admired him all the more for his restraint.  
  
  “I wish you would be straight with me about all of this,” he said.  
  
  “I’m being as straight with you as I can be.”  
  
  When Rhys came back from the bathroom, Matt leaned away from me and eyed him warily.  
  
  “You don’t have any family pictures up,” Rhys commented as he looked around the room.  
  
  That was true. We didn’t really have decorations up of any kind, but we didn’t particularly care to remember our family. Matt especially was not fond of our… er, his mother.  
  
  I had yet to explain to Rhys about his mother being a lunatic locked up in a mental institution. Stuff like that is hard to break to someone, especially someone as awestruck as Rhys.  
  
  “Yeah, we’re just that way,” I said, trying to change the subject, and stood up. “We drove all night to get here. I’m pretty beat. What about you, Rhys?”  
  
  “Uh, yeah, I guess I’m tired.” Rhys seemed a bit startled by my suggestion. Even though he hadn’t gotten any sleep, he didn’t look tired at all.  
  
  “We should get some sleep, and we can talk more later.”  
  
  “Oh.” Matt got to his feet slowly. “You’re both going to be sleeping here, then?” He looked uncertainly at Rhys, then back at me.  
  
  “Yeah,” I nodded. “He doesn’t really have anywhere else to go.”  
  
  “Oh.” Matt was clearly against this idea, but I knew he was afraid that if he kicked Rhys out, I’d go after him. “Rhys, I guess you can sleep in my room, for now.”  
  
  “Really?” Rhys tried to tone down his excitement over staying in Matt’s room, but it was obvious.  
  
   
Matt awkwardly showed us up to our rooms. My room was still my room, all my stuff the same as I had left it weeks earlier. As I settled in, I listened to Matt and Rhys talking across the hall in Matt’s room. Rhys was asking him to explain the simplest things, making Matt frustrated and uncomfortable.  
  
  By the time Matt came into my room after finally getting Rhys comfortable, I had already changed into my pajamas. They were worn and comfortable, and I loved them.  
  
  “Wendy, what is going on?” Matt whispered. He came in and shut the door behind him, as if Rhys were some kind of spy. “Who is that kid really? Where did you go?”  
  
  “I can’t tell you what happened while I was gone. Can’t you just be happy that I’m here and I’m safe?”  
  
  “No, not really.” Matt shook his head. “That kid is not right! He is so amazed by everything!”  
  
  “He’s amazed by you,” I corrected him. “You have no idea how exciting this all is for him.”  
  
  “None of this is making any sense!” Matt ran a hand through his hair.  
  
  “I really do need to get some sleep, and this is a lot for you to process. I get that. Why don’t you just go call Maggie? Let her know I’m safe. I’ll get some rest, and you can think about everything I’ve been saying.”  
  
  Seeing that I wasn’t going to budge, Matt gave in. “Fine. But you better think about telling me what’s really going on here.” His blue eyes had gone hard.  
  
  “Alright,” I shrugged. I could think about it, but I wouldn’t tell him.  
  
  “I am glad you’re home,” Matt softened.  
  
  He let his guard down for a second, revealing how terrible this had all been for him. I knew I could never disappear like that again. I went over and hugged him tightly.  
  
  After saying goodnight, Matt left me alone in my room, and I crawled into the familiar comfort of my twin bed. I had been sleeping in a giant king-size bed in Förening, but somehow, my narrow bed felt so much better. I snuggled deeper in the covers, relieved to be somewhere that felt sane again.  
  
  I’d always had an inkling that I didn’t fit in with my family, despite Matt’s devotion to me. My mother had nearly killed me when I was six years old, claiming that I was a monster and not her daughter.  
  
  Turns out, she was right.  
  
  A month ago, I found out I was a changeling – you know, a child that is exchanged in secret for another child? Specifically, I was switched at birth with Rhys Dahl. It turns out that I’m a Trylle. Trylle are basically glamorous grifters with mild superpowers. Technically, I’m a troll, but not in the creepy little green monster sort of way. I’m of a normal height and fairly attractive. In Trylle culture, the use of changelings is a practice that dates back centuries. The custom’s intention is to make sure the Trylle offspring had the best childhoods possible.  
  
  I’m supposed to be a Princess in Förening – the compound in Minnesota where the Trylle live. My birth mother is Elora, the Trylle Queen. After spending a few weeks in Förening, I decided to head home. I had a falling out with Elora, who had forbidden me from seeing the guy I love, Finn Holmes, simply because he’s not royalty. I escaped and took Rhys with me. In Förening, Rhys had been about the only one to show me genuine kindness, and I felt he deserved some of that in return. I brought him here to meet Matt, since he is really Rhys’s brother, not mine.  
  
  Of course, I couldn’t tell Matt all of that. He’d think I was completely insane.  
  
  Growing drowsy, I thought again how good it felt to be home.  
  
  It only took ten minutes for Rhys to shatter that comfort for me, however, when he crept into my room. I was almost asleep, but the sound of my door opening made me alert. Matt had gone downstairs, presumably to make the phone calls I suggested, and if he knew Rhys was in here, he’d kill us both.  
  
  “Wendy? Are you asleep?” Rhys whispered, sitting gingerly the edge of my bed.  
  
  “Yes,” I muttered.  
  
  “Sorry. I can’t sleep,” Rhys said. “How can you sleep?”  
  
  “It’s not that exciting for me. I lived here before, remember?”  
  
  “Yeah but…” He trailed off, probably because he had no argument for that. Suddenly, he tensed and sucked in his breath. “Did you hear that?”  
  
  “You talking? Yes, but I’ve been trying not-” Before I could finish my sentence, I heard it too. A rustling sound outside my bedroom window.  
  
  Considering I had just had a horrible run-in with some very bad trolls known as Vittra, I was concerned. I rolled over, hoping to be able to see anything, but the curtains were drawn, blocking my view.  
  
  The rustling turned into actual banging, and I sat up, my heart pounding. Rhys shot a nervous glance at me. We heard the window slide open, and the curtains billowed out from the wind.  
  
  2. Interruptions  
  
  He stepped into my room with one graceful move, as if entering through bedroom windows was nothing out of the ordinary.  
  
  His black hair was slicked back, but he had stubble growing along his jaw, making him look even sexier. His eyes were so dark they were nearly black, and he cast one discerning glare at Rhys before settling them on me, making my heart forget to beat entirely.  
  
  Finn Holmes had snuck into my room.  
  
  H still managed to stun me the same way he always did. I was so happy to see him that I almost forget how angry I was with him.  
  
  The last time I had seen Finn, he was slinking out of my bedroom in Förening, per his deal with my mother. Elora told him that he could spend one more night with me before leaving. Forever.  
  
  We had only kissed, but Finn had failed to let me in on Elora’s plan. He didn’t even bother to say goodbye. He didn’t fight it or try to get me to run away with him. He just crept out of my room, leaving Elora to explain to me exactly what had happened.  
  
  “What are you doing here?” Rhys asked, and Finn pulled his eyes off me to glare at Rhys.  
  
  “I came to collect the Princess, of course.” Finn struggled to keep his expressions and his voice emotionless, but irritation saturated his words.  
  
  “Well, yeah, but… I thought Elora reassigned you.” Rhys was thrown by Finn’s anger, and he fumbled for a minute. “I mean… that’s what people were saying around Förening, that you weren’t allowed around Wendy anymore.”  
  
  Finn tensed noticeably at Rhys’s words, his jaw flexing, and Rhys looked down at the floor.  
  
  “I’m not,” Finn admitted once he had calmed down enough to speak. “I was preparing to leave when I heard that you two had vanished in the middle of the night. Elora was deciding who would be best suited to track Wendy, but I thought it would be in her best interest if I went after her, what with the Vittra stalking her.”  
  
  Rhys opened his mouth to protest but Finn stopped him.  
  
  “We all know you did a wonderful job of protecting her at the ball,” Finn said. “If I hadn’t shown up, you might’ve protected her right into getting murdered.”  
  
  “I know the Vittra are a threat!” Rhys shot back, sounding perplexed.  
  
  Hearing his confusion, I got up off the bed, moving to intercede. Rhys agreed with Finn about the Vittra, which is why he couldn’t figure out why exactly he’d let me talk him into coming here.  
  
  The truth was, Rhys didn’t agree to come here. He wanted to meet Matt, but he was adamant about my safety and had flat out refused to let me leave the security of the compound.  
  
  Unfortunately for Rhys, I had persuasion. When I looked at people and thought about what I wanted them to do, they would do it, whether they really wanted to or not.  
  
  That’s how I convinced Rhys to take me with him when we ran away, and I needed to say something before Rhys caught on to what I’d done.  
  
  “The Vittra lost a lot of trackers in that fight,” I interjected. “They’re not eager to repeat it any time soon. Besides that, I’m sure they’re sick of trying to get me.”  
  
  “That’s highly unlikely.” Finn narrowed his eyes, studying Rhys’s bewilderment, and then he looked darkly at me. He’d figured out how I had convinced Rhys to leave. “Wendy, do you care nothing for your own safety?”  
  
  
  “I probably care more than you do.” I crossed my arms firmly over my chest. “You were leaving to go onto another job. If I had waited one more day to leave, you wouldn’t have known I was gone.”  
  
  “Is this about getting my attention?” Finn snapped. His eyes burned, and I had never seen his anger directed at me this way before. “I don’t know how many times I have to explain this to you! You are a Princess! I mean nothing! You need to forget about me!”  
  
  “What’s going on?” That was Matt, shouting from the stairs.  
  
  He’d heard us arguing. If he came up here and caught Finn in my room that would be very, very bad.  
  
  “I’ll go… create a diversion.” Rhys glanced at me to make sure that was okay, and I nodded. He darted out the door, saying things to Matt about how awesome the house was, and their voices faded as they went downstairs.  
  
  I tucked my curls behind my ears and refused to look at Finn. It was hard to believe that the last time I had been with him, he had been kissing me so passionately, I could barely breathe. I remembered the way his scruff scraped against my cheeks and the way his lips pressed against mine.  
  
  I suddenly hated him for that memory, and I hated that all I could think about how was badly I wanted to kiss him again.  
  
  “Wendy, you are not safe here,” Finn insisted quietly.  
  
  “I’m not going with you.”  
  
  “You cannot stay here. I won’t allow it.”  
  
  “You won’t allow it?” I scoffed. “I am the Princess, remember? Who are you to allow me to do anything? You’re not even my tracker anymore. You’re some guy being a creepy stalker.”  
  
  That sounded much harsher than I meant it. Not that anything I said ever really seemed to hurt Finn. He just stared at me, his gaze level and unfazed.  
  
  “I knew I would find you faster than anyone. If you don’t come home with me, that’s fine,” Finn said. “Another tracker will be here shortly, and you can go with him. I’ll just wait with you until he arrives to ensure your safety.”  
  
  “It’s not about you, Finn!” I snapped at him. He played a larger part than I would ever admit to him, but it really wasn’t just him. I hated my mother, my title, my house, everything. I wasn’t meant to be a Princess. “I’m not going with anyone!”  
Finn looked at me for a long moment, trying to understand where this was coming from. I had to fight the urge to squirm as he scrutinized me. His eyes flashed darkly for a second, and his expression hardened.  
  
  “Is this about the mänsklig?” Finn asked, referring to Rhys. “I thought I told you to stay away from him.”  
  
  Mänsklig were the human children taken in exchanged for Trylle babies. They were the lowest on the hierarchy of Trylle, and if a Princess was caught seeing one, they’d both be banished forever. Not that even I cared, but I didn’t have any feelings for Rhys that weren’t purely platonic.  
  
  “It has nothing to do with Rhys. I just thought he’d like to see his family.” I shrugged. “It has to be better than living in that stupid house with Elora.”  
  
  “Good. He can stay here then.” Finn nodded. “Matt and Rhys are taken care of. Now you can come home.”  
  
  “That is not my home. This is my home!” I gestured widely to my room. “I’m not going, Finn.”  
  
  “You are not safe.” He took a step closer to me, knowing the effect his presence had on me. He lowered his voice and stared into my eyes. “You saw what the Vittra did in Förening. They sent an army out to get you, Wendy.” He put his hands on my arms, strong and warm on my skin. “They will not stop until they have you.”  
  
  “Why? Why wouldn’t they stop?” I asked. “There’s got to be Trylle out there that are easier to get than me. And so what if I’m a Princess? If I don’t come back, Elora can replace me. I’m meaningless.”  
  
  “You are far more powerful than you know.”  
  
  “What does that even mean?” I demanded.  
  
  Before he could answer, there was a noise on the roof outside my window. Finn grabbed my arm and threw open my closet door, shoving me inside. As a rule, I don’t enjoy being tossed into closets and having the door shut on my face, but I knew he was protecting me.  
  
  I opened the door a crack, so I could watch what happened and intervene if necessary. Even as mad as I was at Finn, I would never let him get hurt over me. Not again.  
  
  Finn stood a few feet from the window. His eyes blazed and his shoulders tensed, but when the figure climbed in through the window, Finn only scoffed.  
  
  The kid coming in tripped on the windowsill. He wore skinny jeans and purple shoes with the laces untied. Finn towered over him, looking down at him wearily.  
  
  “Hey, what are you doing here?” He flipped his bangs out of his eyes and pulled down his jacket. It was zipped all the way up, and the bottom met the top of his jeans. When he bent over or moved, it rode up.  
  
  “Getting the Princess. They sent you after her?” Finn arched an eyebrow. “Elora really thought you’d be able to bring her back?”  
  
  “Hey, I’m a good tracker! I’ve brought in way more people than you have!”  
  
  “That’s because you’re seven years older than me,” Finn replied. That made the clumsy kid twenty-seven. He looked much younger than that.  
  
  “Whatever. Elora picked me. Deal with it.” The kid shook his head. “What? Are you jealous or something?”  
  
  “Don’t be absurd.”  
  
  “So where is the Princess anyway?” He looked around my room. “She ran away for this?”  
  
  “This is my room!” I walked out of the closet, and the new tracker jumped. “You don’t need to be condescending.”  
  
  “Um, sorry,” he stumbled, blushing. “My apologies, Princess.” He offered me an unsure smile and did a low bow. “I’m Duncan Janssen, and I’m at your service.”  
  
  “I’m not the Princess anymore, and I’m not going with you,” I said. “I just finished explaining that to Finn.”  
  
  “What?” Duncan looked uncertainly at Finn as he readjusted his jacket again. Finn sat down on the edge of my bed and said nothing. “Princess, you have to come. It’s not safe for you here.”  
  
  “I don’t care.” I shrugged. “I’d rather take my chances out here.”  
  
  “It can’t be that bad at the palace.” Duncan was the first person I had ever heard genuinely call Elora’s house a palace, even though it sort of was one. “You are the Princess. You have everything.”  
  
  “I’m not going. You can tell Elora that you tried your best, and I refused.”  
  
  Duncan once again looked to Finn for help. He shrugged at Duncan, and Finn’s shift to indifference startled me. I had put my foot down on the subject, but I hadn’t really expected him to listen. He seemed to truly believe that I was in danger, even though I didn’t.  
  
  “She can’t possibly stay here!” Duncan moved on to reasoning with Finn.  
  
  “You think I don’t agree with you?” Finn raised an eyebrow.  
  
  “I don’t think you’re helping,” Duncan qualified. He fidgeted with his jacket and continued to try to stare down Finn, a task I knew was impossible.  
  
  “What do you expect me to say to her that I haven’t already said?” Finn asked, sounding surprisingly helpless.  
  
  “So you’re saying we leave her here?” Duncan asked dubiously.  
  
  “I am right here. I don’t really appreciate the way you keep referring to me like I’m not,” I said.  
  
  “If she wants to stay here, then she’ll stay here,” Finn ignored me. Duncan shifted and glanced over at me. “We’re not going to kidnap her. That leaves little in the way of options.”  
  
  “Can’t you like…” Duncan lowered his voice and fiddled with the zipper of his jacket. “… you know, convince her somehow?”  
  
  Word of Finn’s affection for me must have spread through the compound. Aggravated, I refused to let my feelings for him be used against me.  
  
  “Nothing is going to convince me,” I snapped sourly.  
  
  “Do you see?” Finn motioned towards me. Sighing, he got to his feet. “We should be on our way then.”  
  
  “Really?” I couldn’t hide the shock in my voice  
  
  “Yeah. Really?” Duncan echoed.  
  
  “You said there was nothing I can do to convince you? Has that changed?” Finn turned to me. His voice was hopeful, but his eyes were almost taunting. I shook my head firmly. “Then there is nothing left to say.”  
  
  “Finn-” Duncan started to protest, but Finn held his hand up to him.  
  
  “It is as the Princess wishes.”  
  
  Duncan looked skeptically at Finn, probably thinking that this was some sort of trick, much as I was. There had to be something I wasn’t getting because Finn wouldn’t just leave me here. Sure, that’s exactly what he had done a few days ago, but that’s because leaving then was what he thought was best for me.  
  
  “But Finn-” Duncan tried again, but Finn waved him off.  
  
  “We must go. Her ‘brother’ will notice us soon,” Finn said.  
  
  I glanced at my closed bedroom door, as if Matt would be lurking right there. The last time Matt and Finn had a run in it had not gone well, and I was not eager to repeat the experience.  
  
  “Fine, but…” Duncan trailed off, realizing too late that he had nothing to threaten either of us with. He gave me another quick bow. “Princess. I’m sure we’ll meet again.”  
  
  “We’ll see,” I shrugged.  
  
  Duncan climbed out my bedroom window, practically falling onto the roof. Finn went behind him, helping Duncan through the window so he wouldn’t accidentally kill himself.  
  
  After Duncan was out, he half-jumped half-fell off the roof. Finn watched him apprehensively for a moment, holding my curtain open, but he didn’t follow after immediately.  
  
  Instead, he straightened up, looking over at me. My anger and resolution were fading. Part of me believed that Finn wouldn’t really leave things this way.  
  
  “Once I’m out this window, lock it behind me,” Finn commanded. “Make sure all the doors are locked, and never go anywhere alone. Never go any place at night, and if at all possible, always take Matt and Rhys with you.” He looked past me for a moment, thinking of something.  
  
  “Although neither of them are really good for much of anything…” His muttering trailed off and his dark eyes rested on mine once again. His expression was imploring, and he raised h  
is hand as if he meant to touch my face, but he lowered it again. “You must be careful.”  
  
  “Okay,” I promised him.  
  
  With Finn standing right in front of me, I could feel the warmth of his body and smell his cologne. His eyes were locked on mine, and I remembered the way it felt when he tangled his fingers in my hair and held me so close to him, I couldn’t breathe.  
  
  He was so strong and controlled. In the brief moments he allowed himself to let go of his passion with me, it was the most wonderfully suffocating feeling I’d ever had.  
  
  I did not want him to leave, and he did not want to leave. But we had both made choices we were unwilling to change. He nodded once more, breaking eye contact, and then turned and slid out the window.  
  
  Duncan waited by the tree, and Finn dropped gracefully to the ground. Duncan still didn’t want to leave, and Finn had to convince him to move away from the house.  
  
  When they reached the hedges separating my lawn from the neighbors, Finn looked around, checking to make sure no one was there. Without even looking at me, he and Duncan turned and disappeared.  
  
  I closed the window, locking it securely the way he’d said to. I felt a terrible ache watching him go. Even though he had done this kind of thing before, I couldn’t wrap my mind around Finn really leaving and convincing Duncan to leave me too. If he was so concerned about the Vittra, why would he leave me so unprotected?  
  
  It finally dawned on me. Finn had never left me unprotected, no matter what I or anybody else wanted. As soon as he had realized I wasn’t going with him, he hadn’t wanted to waste any more time arguing. He would wait in the wings until I changed my mind or …  
  
  I shut the curtains tightly. I hated being spied on, but I also found it strangely comforting that Finn was watching over me. After having my window open for so long, my room felt chilly, so I went over to my closet and pulled on a heavy sweater.  
  
  The adrenaline rush from seeing Finn had left me wide awake, but I was looking forward to curling up in bed, even if I wouldn’t be able to sleep.  
  
  I settled into my bed, trying futilely to forget about Finn. Within minutes, I heard a loud banging downstairs. Matt let out a yelling sound, but it was cut short, leaving the house in total silence.  
  
  I jumped and ran to my bedroom door. With shaking hands, I opened it, hoping that Finn had tried to sneak back in and had a misunderstanding with Matt.  
  
  Then I heard Rhys screaming.  
  
  3. Insentient  
  
  Rhys had stopped making a sound. I had barely taken a step out of my room when I heard footsteps pounding up the stairs, and before I could react, she was there.  
  
  Kyra, a Vittra tracker I had dealt with before, appeared at the top of the landing. Her dark hair was in a pixie cut, and she wore a long black leather jacket. She hung onto the railing, crouching down. As soon as she saw me, she sneered, showing much more teeth than any human would.  
  
  I rushed towards her, hoping for the element of surprise, but I was out of luck.  
  
  She dodged before I got close and sent a swift kick flying into my abdomen. I stumbled backwards, gripping my stomach dramatically, and when she came at me again, I punched her.  
  
  Kyra didn’t even take a moment to be stunned. She returned the blow much harder, hitting me in the face. When I fell down, she stood over me, smiling, with blood dripping from her nose from where I’d punched her.  
  
  I scrambled to my feet, and she grabbed my hair, yanking me up. I kicked at her as she lifted me, and she rewarded my moxie by kicking me so hard in the side, I cried out. Kyra laughed at that and kicked me again.  
  
  This time I saw white and everything faded out for a moment. My hearing got wonky, and I barely hung on to consciousness.  
  
  “Stop!” A strong voice was shouting.  
  
  When I blinked open my swollen eyes, I saw a man running up the stairs towards Kyra. He was tall, and beneath his black sweater, he was well-muscled. Kyra dropped me to the ground when he reached the top of the stairs.  
  
  “It’s not like I can really hurt her, Loki,” Kyra said, her voice bordering on whining.  
  
  I tried to get to my feet again, even though I felt dizzy, and she kicked me down.  
  
  “Knock it off,” he snapped at her. She grimaced and took a step back.  
  
  He stood in front of me, towering above me, and then knelt down. I could scramble away from him, but I wouldn’t get far. He cocked his head, looking at me curiously.  
  
  “So you’re what all the fuss is about,” he mused.  
  
  He reached forward, taking my face in his hands. Not painfully, but he was forcing me to look at him. His caramel eyes fixed on mine. I wanted to look away, but I couldn’t.  
  
  This strange fog settled over me, and as terrified as I was, I felt my body relaxing, losing its ability to fight. My eyelids were too heavy to keep open, and unable to stop it, I fell asleep.  
  
  I was dreaming of water. But anything more specific than that I couldn’t remember. My body felt cold, like it should be shivering but wasn’t. My cheeks were warm though, resting against something soft.  
  
  “You’re telling me that she is a Princess?” Matt asked, and his chest rumbled above me. My head lay against his leg, and the more I woke up, the more I realized how terrible my body felt.  
  
  “It’s not that hard to believe, really,” Rhys said. His voice came from somewhere on the other side of the room. “Once you get all the Trylle stuff, the Princess part is pretty easy to take.”  
  
  “I’m not sure what to believe anymore,” Matt admitted.  
  
  I opened my eyes with a struggle. My lids felt unnaturally heavy, and my left eye was swollen from where Kyra punched me. The room swayed, and I blinked it into focus.  
  
  When my vision finally cleared, I still didn’t really understand what I was seeing. The floor appeared to be dirt, and the walls were brown and grey stones, looking damp and old. It reminded me of an old cellar… or a dungeon.  
  
  Rhys paced the other side of the room, and he had fresh bruises on his face. I tried to sit up, but my entire body hurt and my head felt woozy.  
  
  “Hey, take it easy,” Matt said, putting his hand on my shoulder, but I didn’t listen.  
  
  I pushed myself up until I was sitting. It took a lot more effort than it normally required, and I grimaced when I leaned against the wall next to him.  
  
  “You’re awake!” Rhys grinned, and he was probably the only person in the world that could look happy in this situation.  
  
  “How are you feeling?” Matt asked. For his part, he didn’t have any visible bruises, but he was a better fighter than Rhys and me.  
  
  “Great.” I had to lie through gritted teeth because it hurt to breathe. Based on the intense shooting pain I had in my diaphragm, I guessed I had a cracked rib, but I didn’t want to worry Matt. “What’s going on? Where are we?”  
  
  “I was hoping you could shed some light on that,” Matt said.  
  
  “I already told him, but he won’t believe me,” Rhys said.  
  
  “Where are we then?” I asked Rhys, and Matt scoffed.  
  
  “I’m not sure exactly.” Rhys shook his head. “The Vittra palace. I think it might be in Colorado.”  
  
  “I figured as much,” I sighed. “I recognized the Vittra that attacked the house. Kyra went after me before.”  
  
  “What?” Matt’s eyes were wide and disbelieving. “These people went after you before?”  
  
  “Yeah, that’s why I had to leave.” I closed my eyes because it was hurting too much keep them open. The world wanted to spin out from under me.  
  
  “Told you,” Rhys said to Matt. “I’m not lying about this stuff. After what happened, you think you’d cut me a little slack.”  
  
  “Rhys isn’t lying,” I said, wincing. It was getting harder to breathe, and I had to take very shallow breaths, which only made me more lightheaded. “He knows more about all of this than I do. I wasn’t there very long.”  
  
  “Why are these Vittra people coming after you?” Matt asked. “Why do they want you?”  
  
  I shook my head, unwilling to risk the pain of speaking.  
  
   
“I don’t know,” Rhys answered when I didn’t. “I’ve never seen them go after anyone this way before. Then again, she’s the first Princess I’ve been around, and they’ve foretold of her for a while.”  
  
  I wanted to know what they were foretelling. Everyone gave me vague responses, like I would be powerful someday, but I didn’t feel very powerful, especially right now. It hurt too much to speak, and I was locked up a dungeon.  
  
  Not only had I failed to save myself, I’d gotten Rhys and Matt dragged into it along with me.  
  
  “Wendy, are you okay?” Matt asked.  
  
  “Yeah,” I lied.  
  
  “You don’t look okay,” Rhys said.  
  
  “All your color is gone, and you’re barely even breathing,” Matt said, and I heard him getting to his feet next to me. “You need a doctor or something.”  
  
  “What are you doing?” Rhys asked.  
  
  I opened my eyes to see what Matt was up to. His plan was simple and obvious – he went to the locked door and pounded on it.  
  
  “Help! Somebody! Wendy needs a doctor!” Matt shouted.  
  
  “What makes you think they’d even want to help her?” Rhys asked, and those were my thoughts exactly. Kyra had gone out of her way to hurt me when she captured me.  
  
  “They haven’t killed her yet, so they probably don’t want her dead.” Matt stopped pounding long enough to answer Rhys, then went back to hitting the door and yelling for help.  
  
  The sound of it echoed through the room, and I couldn’t take it anymore. My head throbbed too much already. I was about to tell Matt to knock it off when the door opened.  
  
  This was the perfect time for Matt and Rhys to launch a counter attack, but it didn’t occur to either of them. They both just moved away.  
  
  The Vittra from the house walked into the room, the one that had rendered me unconscious, and I dimly remembered Kyra calling him Loki. His shaggy hair was surprisingly light for a Vittra, almost blond.  
  
  Walking next to him was a troll, like an actual troll. All short and gobliny. His features were humanoid, but his skin was slimy and brown. He wore a hat and tufts of grayish hair stuck out around the edge. He barely came up to Loki’s hip, but the fact that he was an actual troll made him more intimidating somehow.

She has been looking for a musician to perform with. Finally found a young guy that she likes. They are meeting this Friday for coffee and a chat. She has already told me that he is funny and reminds her of her ex boyfriend as he was South American too.

She doesnt have her own car since her old one broke down last year. She relies on my car and her mum's car to get around. Originally asked me to drop her off but then has decided to change her mind and told me not tl worry about it and do my own thing whilst she drives herself to meet him.

I am supposed to trust her. But it still makes me very uncomfortable. For context, my ex wife was abusive and ended up cheating on me. Didn't care about me and met some guys. So it makes it hard for me to trust or feel good about this. Am I over reacting?",1,1753244150.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

What is happening?,"I have a strong background in People Operations and C-Level support, yet I haven't been able to secure even a sales associate position at a Starbucks or a local plant store. I’ve done everything possible: refined my resume, crafted tailored cover letters with the right keywords to get through ATS systems, and aligned every detail to the job description. I’ve reached out to recruiters, analyzed which applications led to interviews, and committed myself fully to the job search for over a year and seven months.

Last year, I even conducted a full self-evaluation to better understand how I was spending my time. I did a personal 360 review for all of 2024 and found that over 50% of my time was spent applying for jobs. The rest went toward maintaining my mental health at the gym and supporting my Aunt and Uncle. I built structure and held myself accountable, doing everything within my power to improve my chances.

During this time, the gym has been my only consistent mental break, Monday through Saturday. While I do my best to stay optimistic, the truth is I’m scared. I’m running out of options and on the brink of homelessness. I’ve exhausted my savings and cut back on nearly all social interactions to stretch every dollar. Coffee helps keep me going, and I often limit my food just to get by.

This has been the hardest period of my life.

And my intuition keeps telling me something deeper is going on. Maybe there simply aren’t enough jobs, or the AT system itself is broken. It’s not just me. I’ve spoken to so many qualified, hard-working people in the same situation. We are doing all the right things: tailoring resumes, networking, staying positive, yet doors remain closed. It’s exhausting, and it makes you question whether the job market is truly based on merit anymore or if we are stuck in a system that no longer works for the people who built it.

If you’re going through something similar, I see you. Please feel free to share your story or any insights you’ve gained during your own job search. Maybe if we speak up together, we can start to make sense of what’s really happening.",26,1753244071.0,AskSF,2,0.93,False

My best friend u/LVMJohnson1996 and I stumbled upon this community, and were honestly blown away by all the creativity oozing out of this place, it completely inspired us.

We're working on creating this writing app called LEAF. The whole idea is to make it completely keyboard-driven (perfect since I noticed there's a distinct lack of mice around here lol) and super customizable - think different themes, fonts, the works.

Here's the thing though, we're pretty clueless about what features writers actually want. We've got the basic framework in place, but we want to build something that would actually be worthy for you folks, not just some generic slop. 

If LEAF could eventually earn a spot of someone's writer deck someday that would honestly make us so happy.

So what do you think? What features would you want to see? What would this app need to possess for you to run this on your own writers deck?

I want to share my experience to help others who might be struggling with the same design challenge.

First things first - the shape of your coffee table should complement your sectional sofa's layout and the overall room flow. I learned this the hard way after initially choosing a table that made navigating my living room feel like an obstacle course.

For L-shaped sectionals, I've found that rectangular or oval coffee tables work exceptionally well. They mirror the angular nature of the sofa while providing enough surface area for everyone to reach comfortably. If you're curious about sectional sofas, I found some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa

Round coffee tables are perfect for sectionals with a curved design or conversation-style arrangements. They soften the sharp angles and create a more welcoming atmosphere. Plus, they're safer if you have kids running around - no sharp corners to worry about.

Square coffee tables work best with symmetrical U-shaped sectionals. They provide balanced proportions and maintain the room's visual harmony. Just make sure to leave about 18 inches between the table and the sofa for comfortable movement.

The size matters just as much as the shape. A good rule of thumb I follow is keeping the coffee table about two-thirds the length of your main sofa section. Speaking of sectionals, you can check out various styles and configurations here: https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa

Some other factors I consider:
- Height should be level with or slightly lower than the sofa seat
- Material should match room's style (glass for modern, wood for traditional)
- Consider nesting tables for flexibility
- Ottoman coffee tables provide extra seating when needed

Remember that these aren't strict rules - they're guidelines based on what I've found works best. The key is finding a balance between functionality and aesthetics that works for your space and lifestyle.

If you're dealing with a small space, consider a coffee table with storage or one that can be easily moved. I've found that lighter materials like glass or acrylic can make the room feel more open.

In my experience, the right coffee table can transform your living room from just functional to genuinely inviting. Take measurements, consider your daily activities, and choose a shape that complements your sectional while meeting your practical needs.",1,1753243581.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

“I’m sorry, Miss Nadine Smith, but we can’t issue a copy of this marriage certificate because you were never legally married to Mr. Scott Jones.”

That’s impossible. Scott said he registered our marriage three years ago.

“Miss Smith, Mr. Jones is married but not to you. He’s been married for three years to a woman named Jasmine Rivera. Does that name mean anything to you?”

Jasmine. My best friend. Three years ago, Jasmine had been pushed from a rooftop by one of Scott’s enemies who’d wanted to hurt him and they thought she was the woman he truly loved.

She went into a coma. Scott forced me to take care of her because he said we owed my life to her. Then, I overheard.

“Nadine? She doesn’t even know our marriage is fake. You know she followed me for twenty years? Like a lost puppy. I pitied her — that’s why I decided to use her.”

What’s worse? Jasmine finally woke up, and he chose her over me when his enemies tried to kill me, making me lose our child.

That was the last straw. I called my mother to arrange a new marriage, packed my bags, and walked away…, only for him to beg on my wedding day, but he was already too late to love me.

\--

“I’m sorry, Miss Nadine Smith, but we can’t issue a copy of this marriage certificate because you were never legally married to Mr. Scott Jones.”

I blinked at the woman behind the counter. I clutched my hands together until my nails dug into my palms.

“That’s… that’s not possible. I’m Mrs. Nadine Jones. I just need a reprint. I accidentally spilled coffee all over the old copy when I was cleaning my husband Scott's office.”

The clerk’s polite smile never faltered. She pushed her glasses up her nose, tapped a few keys, and turned the screen slightly my way — a blur of lines and legal text I couldn’t focus on. “Miss Smith. ”

I felt my breath catch. My lips felt too big for my mouth. “No. You don’t understand. He told me he registered it after the church ceremony was postponed. He showed me the certificate. I’ve been living with him for three years. We’re married.”

Her voice softened, like she was explaining something to a child who couldn’t grasp their numbers yet. “Miss Smith, I can’t change what the records say. Mr. Jones is married but not to you. He’s been legally married for three years to a woman named Jasmine Rivera. Does that name mean anything to you?”

My knees nearly buckled. Jasmine. Of course I knew her. How could I not? She was my best friend. So, how come?

I stumbled away from the counter, mumbling something that probably sounded like thank you but tasted like acid in my mouth.

I don’t even remember how I got home. One moment I was standing there with my world split open like rotten fruit, the next I was climbing the marble stairs of Scott’s estate on autopilot, my palms still sticky from gripping the steering wheel too hard.

Three years ago, I was supposed to marry Scott in that white church on the hill. My mother had picked the flowers. Jasmine had helped me choose the dress. And then the news came: Jasmine had been pushed from a rooftop by one of Scott’s enemies who’d wanted to hurt him and they thought she was me. They thought she was the woman he truly loved. But she wasn’t supposed to be there. It was supposed to be me.

She survived, if you can even call it that. I still see her lying on those silk sheets, eyes half-open but never seeing. Her brother Condor moved into the estate too because he was also sick. Scott said we owed it to her. I believed him. I believed everything he told me.

I spent three years nursing my best friend, scrubbing her skin with warm cloths, combing out the tangles in her hair. Feeding her, talking to her, praying she’d come back to me. I cooked for Scott, smiled when he kissed my forehead, accepted that he couldn’t touch me more because he was stressed. I believed I was his wife. I let him show me that piece of paper and never questioned it again.

Stupid. So stupid.

I was halfway down the hallway when I heard their voices — Scott’s low, calm baritone and Condor’s quieter hum. The door to the study was cracked open. I should’ve walked away. Instead I froze.

“…I really want to thank you for everything, Scott. For Jasmine. For me,” Condor was saying.

“Come on, Condor,” Scott said, that warm laugh I used to believe in. “You know how much I love your sister. Not a day goes by I don’t regret what happened. It wasn’t supposed to be her who got pushed. It was supposed to be Nadine. That’s why I married her — to fool them into thinking she was the one I loved. To keep the enemy away from Jasmine.”

My breath snagged in my throat. I pressed my back to the cold wall. My ears rang so loudly I almost didn’t hear Condor’s next question.

“What if Nadine finds out? What if she leaves?”

Scott scoffed. “Nadine? She’ll never find out. She doesn’t even know our marriage is fake. And even if she did… she loves me too much to ever leave. You know she followed me for twenty years? Like a lost puppy. I pitied her. That’s why I decided to use her. So I married her.”

I don’t know how long I stood there. Long enough to feel my face go numb, my legs go weak. I stumbled down the hallway like a ghost in my own house. Not mine, I corrected myself. Nothing here was mine. Not even him.

When I reached my room, I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I picked up my phone, fingers shaking so hard I almost dropped it twice. I scrolled to the only number that mattered now.

My mother’s voice answered on the second ring. “Nadine? Sweetheart? What is it?”

“Mom,” I said, my voice so calm it scared me. “About the marriage you were arranging for me before… the one I turned down because I said I loved Scott?”

“Yes…?”

“Arrange it again,” I whispered, my throat raw, my heart breaking wide open for the last time. “I’m coming home. Please. I’m done here.”

Chapter 2

“Please… arrange it. I want it now. And I’m coming home, too.”

On the other end of the line, my mother went quiet. I could hear the faint clink of her bracelet, the rustle of her silk robe — it all felt so far away, like another world.

“What do you mean, Nadine? You chased Scott Jones for ten years,” she hissed, disbelief cracking through her calm tone. “You begged me to stop that arrangement back then because you said you loved him. And now what? You want me to fix this marriage you rejected so stubbornly?”

“I was mistaken,” I said, my throat raw. I sank onto the edge of my bed, knees shaking. “I want to leave, Mom. Please. Have that man you wanted me to marry come pick me up. One week. That’s all I’m asking for.”

“That’s so fast, darling.” Her voice softened, like I was fifteen again, crying into her lap after Scott ignored me at prom. “What happened? Did you two fight? What about the divorce? Did he sign the papers?”

I laughed, a dry, empty sound. “No need for that. I was never married.”

Before she could say anything else, I hung up. I didn’t want to hear her pity or her scolding. I just wanted it to be done.

When I turned around, my blood froze in my veins. Scott stood at the door, his arms crossed, eyes dark and narrowed.

His shadow fell across the carpet like a stormcloud. “What on earth was that, Jasmine?”

My stomach twisted. Jasmine. He couldn’t even get my name right sometimes. “Who were you talking to? What do you mean you were never married? Huh?” He took a step forward, voice rising. “What’s this now? Are you being dramatic again? Is this because I didn’t agree to that stupid anniversary trip you kept begging about?”

I opened my mouth but nothing came out. He stalked closer, his tone softening just enough to make my skin crawl. “Didn’t I say we can’t go right now? Your best friend is in a coma. Her brother is still paralyzed. You have to take care of them, we have to. Once Jasmine wakes up, we’ll go. I promise, baby. We’ll go see the aurora borealis together. Wouldn’t you love that?”

His words slithered around me like a snake I’d let coil around my neck for years. I saw it all now — how Jasmine was always there between us. Always. Even before the coma. Even before the rooftop. In high school, I thought she was helping me get closer to him. Writing my letters. Handing him my gifts. But she was the one he’d call at night. The one he’d smile at when he thought I wasn’t looking. My best friend — my betrayal wrapped in a ribbon.

I must’ve been staring too long because Scott’s voice snapped like a whip. “What? Who are you talking to in that head of yours? Are you insulting me now? Say something!”

My eyes burned as tears finally spilled over. I didn’t even try to wipe them away. He paused, his anger shifting into that pathetic, boyish panic he always used to reel me back in. “Oh God, baby, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to shout. I hate seeing you cry. You know that, right? You’re hurting me when you cry like this…”

He pulled me into his arms, his hand sliding behind my neck like it always did when he kissed me. His lips brushed mine but I felt nothing. Nothing but disgust. Once, I would’ve melted. Once, I would’ve forgiven everything with just this. But now?

Now I knew what that kiss really cost me.

I pulled back, my voice flat. “I have a stomachache.”

He frowned, brushing a tear from my cheek with his thumb. “A stomachache? That’s all? Why didn’t you say so? I’ll call the driver. We’ll get you to the hospital right now.”

He pressed his phone to his ear, barking orders like he always did. I stood there like a ghost, watching him fuss, trying to remember when I ever felt safe in his care.

We drove in silence for a while. He held my hand, tracing circles on my skin that made my stomach twist. For a second, I almost believed it — this little lie that he cared. But then his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen, and just like that, I vanished from his mind.

“What? Jasmine’s awake?” His eyes lit up in a way I’d never seen before — not for me. “Turn the car around. We need to go back. I have to be there. She’ll want to see me.”

I stared at him. “What about me? I’m sick, Scott.”

He looked at me like I was an insect crawling across his precious floor. “It’s just a stomachache, Nadine. Don’t be dramatic. Driver, pull over.”

The car slowed to the side of the road. Scott opened the door and practically shoved me out. The rain started in slow, icy drops that slid down my neck.

“Take this,” he said, tossing his black credit card at my feet like a bone for a starving dog. “Get a taxi to the hospital. You’ll be fine.”

“Scott—”

“Stay here,” he snapped at me, and then he was gone. The door slammed. The car sped away into the night — back to Jasmine. Back to the woman he always loved.

I stood there on the side of the road, my hair plastered to my face, my hands clutched to my chest. The rain soaked through my coat in seconds. I could feel the cold all the way to my bones.

I closed my eyes and whispered to the darkness, “Just one more week. One more week… and I’ll be free.”

Chapter 3

I remembered riding the taxi that night, the cold seat sticking to my soaked clothes. I didn’t even have the energy to cry anymore. I just wanted to get to the hospital, check my stomach, and try to feel like a human being again.

But halfway through the ride, the driver glanced back at me with a strange smile, and before I could ask anything, I heard a hiss.

A sharp, chemical smell flooded my nose.

I coughed. “What are you—”

And then everything went dark.

When I woke up, my head was spinning and my body felt like it was made of lead. My wrists were bruised and tied behind me. My legs ached. My back was cold against concrete.

Where am I? The room was dim and smelled like rust and old oil — a warehouse. Somewhere abandoned. Somewhere no one would find me.

Footsteps echoed.

“W-What’s happening?” I croaked, my throat dry, voice barely audible.

One of the men walked up to me, face partially masked. “Shut up. You’re awake. Good. Call Scott.”

“Why?” I rasped, trembling.

“Because your dear husband owes us money. He used us, promised deals, deals he never fulfilled. He’s a liar. Now he has to pay.”

“I—I don’t understand,” I whispered. “I didn’t do anything. I’m not part of this—”

“Yeah?” The man snarled. “Then why did he send his own wife instead of meeting us? Huh?”

I froze. Wife. I wasn’t even legally married to him.

“But I’m not—” I stopped myself. They wouldn’t believe me anyway.

“No, I won’t believe you now,” the other guy muttered. “We got the wrong girl three years ago that is why you live but we won’t let you now…”

I blinked. So it was Scott’s fault. Everything. Jasmine being pushed. Me being kidnapped. All tied to the lies he fed these people. And now I was the collateral damage.

“Call him,” they barked. “Now.”

My fingers were shaking as I dialed.

He answered on the second ring.

“Scott,” I cried. “Help me—please. I’ve been kidnapped, I’m hurt—”

“Oh my god,” he sighed. “Seriously? Nadine? This again?”

“What—what are you talking about?” I whispered, heart plummeting.

“I’m taking care of Jasmine right now,” he snapped. “Don’t start with your attention-seeking stuff. Just get back here. She needs food. You should be helping instead of playing games.”

Then the line cut.

I stared at my phone in disbelief.

The men heard it. “Tch. Worthless,” one said, before slapping me across the face. “It seems it was truly Jasmine, so what are you?”

I felt my lip split.

Me? I guess… nothing.

Still, they didn’t let me go. They started torturing me and I heard they would kill me so that Scott would know his place. I could only cry for help… but none came.

The next thing I remembered was being dumped in front of the hospital like trash.

When I woke again, I was in a bed. The air smelled sterile. The fluorescent lights stung my eyes.

“Don’t move too much,” a nurse said gently. “You lost a lot of blood.”

I blinked slowly, my voice raspy. “What… happened?”

“You were found unconscious and bruised. Someone called it in anonymously. But…” she hesitated.

“But what?” I asked.

“I’m sorry to inform you… you lost the baby.”

“…What?”

I stared at her, unmoving.

“You were three months pregnant.”

I swallowed hard. “I didn’t even know,” I whispered. “I didn’t know because I’m… I’m always irregular.”

“I’m sorry,” she said softly. “Do you want me to call someone for you?”

“My phone,” I muttered.

She handed it over.

It was still working. I stared at the screen. Still no messages. No calls.

I tried calling Scott again. Voicemail.

I stared at the ceiling for what felt like hours.

Then, hungry and weak, I pushed myself up and wandered the halls in my hospital gown. I passed a nurses’ station, then a quiet corridor.

Then I heard a voice I hadn’t heard in three years.

Jasmine.

“…didn’t I tell you to kill her? Why is she still alive?” she hissed.

My heart dropped.

“I’m awake now. So she should be dead. Why is she even in this hospital?” she snapped.

“She was saved,” the man replied. “Some guys showed up. We didn’t expect it. We had to run.”

I stumbled back a step.

Saved? Someone saved me?

But who?

“Do it properly next time,” Jasmine ordered coldly. “And never show your face to me again unless I call you and never tell anyone about this! Got it?”

Footsteps. I backed up quickly, hiding behind a corner as the man exited. I was shaking.

Then—

“There you are!”

I spun around.

Scott.

Smiling.

“Great, you’re here already!” he said, like we were just bumping into each other in a mall. “Jasmine’s so excited to see you. She wants her usual milk tea from that café you love. Could you go get it for her?”

I blinked at him.

Did he not see my bandages?

Did he not care?

“No,” I said quietly.

“What?” His smile faded. “What do you mean no?”

“I don’t want to.”

His brow furrowed. “Are you disobeying me now? What’s this all about?”

Chapter 4

“You’re disobeying me now?” he repeated.

Scott’s voice snapped at my ear like a whip. His eyes were wide with disbelief, the kind that made me want to laugh if I wasn’t so exhausted.

“No,” I said, my throat raw. “I’m just tired. I got hurt, Scott. Didn’t I call you?”

His expression flickered — the mask slipping back into place, the apologetic husband, the sweet savior he liked to play for everyone else’s benefit.

“Oh, baby, I thought you were joking,” he crooned, stepping forward, brushing a hand down my cheek as if that would wipe away the bruises I still felt on my ribs.

“Why didn’t you tell me again? Where are you hurt? We’ll find who did this to you, huh? They’ll pay. You should lie down. I’ll take care of you—”

A sharp scream cut through the corridor.

“Help! Scott!” Jasmine’s voice — sharp, desperate.

I didn’t even get to feel what betrayal tasted like because Scott didn’t spare me another glance. He spun on his heel like I wasn’t even there. “Jasmine! I’m here! I’m coming!” I heard him shout as he disappeared into her room.

All I could do was stand there, staring at the empty space where he’d just been. Then I laughed. A bitter sound, more air than humor. I didn’t know whether I was laughing at him or myself anymore.

From the room, I could hear him: “It’s okay, Jasmine, I’m here. I’ll call the doctor, don’t worry.” Then, loud enough for the whole hallway to hear: “Nadine! Call the doctor!”

Like I was a maid. Like I wasn’t the woman who’d wasted years pretending to be his wife. I turned to walk away but Jasmine’s weak, syrupy voice called out, “Nadine! Wait, please come here!”

Before I knew it, I was at her bedside, staring down at her delicate, porcelain-doll face, the one that had always won people over so easily.

“Oh, my best friend,” she sighed dramatically. “I missed you so much. Scott told me everything, about how you’ve been taking care of me, and my brother, the house… thank you. Thank you for everything you’ve done while I was gone… and now I’m here.”

The words tasted rotten.

My hand moved before my brain could stop it. I pushed her shoulder — not hard, but enough for her to stumble back against the pillows.

She drew in sharp breath. “Sister… what did I do? Why did you push me?” She looked at Scott, wide-eyed.

“What the heck is wrong with you?” Scott rounded on me, fury making his neck flush red. “Didn’t you see she’s still weak? She could’ve fallen! She’s hurt!”

I laughed dryly. “I’m hurt too, remember? Or did you forget? I didn’t push her. She pressed against me. It hurts.”

Scott’s eyes narrowed. “You can’t even say sorry nicely? Jasmine’s always been good to you—”

“Scott, don’t say that to my best friend,” Jasmine cut in with her soft, trembling voice, tears brimming like an actress on cue. “I didn’t know she was hurt. Nadine, I’m so sorry. Please, forgive me.”

Scott folded his arms, the decision made. “Apologize to her, Nadine.”

“No,” I whispered.

His eyes darkened. “Then you’re leaving me no choice. I’ll lock you up in our house until you learn how to respect your own family.”

I felt the laugh bubbling up but it came out as a scoff instead. I could see it so clearly now — how he had shown me his true face the moment Jasmine opened her eyes. I was nothing again. Less than nothing.

“Lock me up then,” I muttered. I looked him straight in the eye. “You never even cared that I lost our child.”

His face twisted, not understanding the last words I said. “What did you say?”

But I was already walking away. He never cared to follow because Jasmine told him to let me go… I was just mad and would be okay in a while.

Well, I would never be okay.

When I got home, I went straight to the little altar I’d built for my father — and now, my baby. I lit a candle for the child I’d never get to meet, my hand steady even as the tears blurred my vision.

The ping of my phone startled me. It was my mother: Everything will be prepared in three days. The helicopter will be waiting with your fiance. Come home.

I clutched the phone to my chest and nodded to no one but myself. Three more days. That was all I had to survive.

Hours later, Scott came back. He didn’t even glance at the candle burning for our child. Of course he didn’t. He just looked at me with that fake, exhausted smile, and said, “I’m sorry, baby. I overreacted earlier. Jasmine wants a banquet tomorrow. You’ll handle it, right?”

I laughed but it came out cracked and raw. “Tomorrow? That’s impossible.”

His smile vanished. “I’m not asking if you can do it. I’m telling you to do it.”

Jasmine appeared behind him, wrapping her frail arms around his body. “Scott, it’s okay… we can do it next week—”

“No. It has to be now,” Scott said. “Everyone must know you’re alive. They won’t dare touch you again.” His eyes cut to me. “Nadine will handle it.”

And that was that. They left me there — like a servant — to make call after call, pulling favors, arranging everything for the woman who’d ordered me dead.

I didn’t sleep that night. I didn’t dare. I worked until my fingers were raw, the candle at my father’s altar burning down to a stub.

Hours before dawn, I passed their bedroom. The door was ajar and the soft sound of wincing voices spilled into the hallway.

I stood there for a moment. I didn’t cry. There were no tears left for them.

I went to my room, pulled out the wedding gown I never wore. The ring he gave me and the copy of their marriage certificate. I dropped them in a box, along with a note about the baby he’d never cared to meet.

I scheduled the delivery for our wedding anniversary, no, their wedding anniversary — the same day I’d disappear forever.

When I finally drifted off, I barely heard Scott come in. He went straight for the vase my father made before he died — the last piece I had left.

“What are you doing?”

“I’ll have this. Jasmine wants it.”

“No,” I whispered. “Please, Scott, not that. That’s all I have left of my father. You know that! Why are you giving it to Jasmine?”

He didn’t even look at me. “Because she said she wants it and she'll give it to the doctor who had operated on her as a thank you because she was great now. It’s just a vase, Nadine. You have plenty.”

When I reached for it, he shoved me aside. I hit the floor, biting back a cry.

He never even looked back.

\--

The day of the banquet was almost beautiful, if you ignored the fact that I was nothing more than their well-dressed maid.

Jasmine lay on her chaise like a delicate queen, smiling sweetly at the guests who flocked to see the miracle — the perfect woman, alive after three years in a coma. Scott hovered by her side, his every gesture dripping devotion like poison I once used to drink willingly.

I moved through the ballroom with a tray in my hands, nodding, bowing, smiling as if none of it tore me apart inside.

When I brought Jasmine her wine, she clasped my wrist with her too-soft fingers. “Nadine, this is lovely. Truly, thank you for all this.” She tilted her head, her syrupy tone slipping like a knife under my ribs. “You know, your husband really loves me. Don’t you think?”

I said nothing.

She laughed lightly, as if it were the funniest thing in the world. “He did this for me — all of this. He’d do anything for me, you know. So, tell me… what are your plans for your wedding anniversary?” Her smile widened, crocodile-like. “I mean, is it really your anniversary?""

Of course, she knew. They had been fooling me since.

I stared right through her. “Don’t worry, I’m leaving so you can have fun with him during our anniversary,” I whispered.

She blinked, caught off guard for a second. But then her grin returned, wider than ever. “Good,” she said, her eyes cold. “Run away, then.”

I turned away before she could see the tremble in my hands. I stood behind the crowd for hours, watching them bask in the glow of my work.

Guests laughed, music flowed, Jasmine twirled around Scott like a silk ribbon and I wondered when I’d ever felt that wanted. Maybe never.

Then it happened.

Hey Beautiful (TY)

This letter doesn’t come from bravado or ego. It comes from the deepest truth I’ve ever known. This isn’t a man trying to win something, it’s a man who already found everything when he found you.

Neither of us were looking for anyone that night. We had both been carrying our own stories quietly surviving, not searching. We were just two souls, bruised and tired, both craving something we couldn’t name. We weren’t out to fall in love we had no idea that love was waiting for us.

But then… we decided to snuggle.  Just friend holding each other.  So we thought!

It started small. Gentle. A simple snuggle, nothing more than a moment of comfort between two friends. A human touch. A shared breath. A need we didn’t speak aloud, but both deeply felt. We didn’t expect it to become anything. Just warmth in a cold world.

But that moment! God, that moment became everything.

Because when I held you that night, I didn’t just hold a body. I held peace. I held home. Your green eyes looked straight into my soul, and for the first time in so long, my blue eyes saw someone who wasn’t afraid of my truth. You leaned into me fully clothed, fully human, fully you and with that single gesture, you rewrote what peace meant to me.

You didn’t rescue me. You met me. In the dark. In the silence. In the ache.

We had both been through our own kinds of chaos, betrayals that left scars, lies we tried to believe, endings disguised as beginnings. But that night, your breath near mine, your body curled against my chest, my soul sighed. Like a river finally freed from the dam. It didn’t crash. It didn’t roar. It simply flowed the way it was always meant to, bending, reshaping, softening everything hardened by life.

We weren’t falling in love. We were healing.

And in healing, we found something pure, something we didn’t expect, but couldn’t deny. Soulmates. Not in a fantasy way, but in the realest, rawest sense. Two people whose wounds recognized each other. Two hearts that weren’t just open, they were ready.

Loving you has been the most real thing I’ve ever done. You didn’t just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. But I also see now that love alone isn’t enough when we haven’t healed the parts of us that were still hurting. It wasn’t love that failed. It was the pieces of me I hadn’t yet faced.

That’s on me, my love.

Please know, I heard you. Every word. Every truth. Even the hard ones. And I didn’t let them pass me by. For the past four and almost six months, I’ve been sitting with the mirror, with the pain, with a therapist who is helping me walk through the wreckage. I’m not doing this for a second chance. I’m doing it because you were the mirror. You made me realize that if I want to love you the way you deserve, I have to become the man I deserve to be.

And because… I want you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first person I have ever truly, undeniably, wholeheartedly loved. Not in a way that sounds good on paper, but in the way that makes me certain I will marry you one day, if you’ll let me.

And if I leave this earth before you, know that my soul will stay. Holding your hand while you sleep. Whispering love into your dreams. Because my love doesn’t end not with distance, not with silence, not even with death. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise, if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, you will never hear my voice raised in anger. Not once. There will be nothing that will separate us again! We will never again choose to leave, we will choose to stay and grow! Together, like we both know we were ment to! I promise you this… I will always stay.

I want the life we almost had and more. I want the laughter, the chaos, the coffee in bed, the kids running through the house, the late-night talks, the forgiveness after the hard moments, the honest love that says “you’re safe here” even when life gets loud.

I don’t want a perfect love. I want ours.

This isn’t just my truth, it’s my invitation. To you. To us. To the kind of love that deserves to rise again. Not because it’s flawless, but because it is real. And real love? It’s worth the fight. It’s worth the healing. It’s worth a second, or in my case third and final chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor. No games. No ego. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready.

If even a piece of your heart remembers that night, that peace, that love… I’m here.

I am already ready to come to you, my home.

Forever and Always,
Your blue eyed love(SB)

My boyfriend and I were on vacation. His mom was cat sitting for him. His cat was around 10 years old. We’ve been dating almost two years. I loved his cat like he was my own. He got a call on Thursday that his cat passed away. His parent’s dog attacked his cat and also his mom’s cat. They both died. His parents have 3 outside dogs. One has killed a cat in the past. A stray cat in the yard. Their cat was inside outside and learned to only go in the backyard. They keep the back yard and front yard separated by fence. But the most aggressive dog can sneak in the house because she figured out to get the storm door open. I guess that is how it happened. His mom feels guilty of course and is sorry. 

I’m so angry. My boyfriend is trying not to be because it’s his parents. He knows it wasn’t on purpose. I know that too. But I hurt so badly for him. And for what those cats went through. They knew this dog had killed before. I’m an animal lover. I have my own dog. But I feel like this dog should be put down. That won’t ever happen though. 

My boyfriend seems to be handling things well. Idk how. He rescued him when he was a year old. It had been just then two for years. He loved him so much. I loved him too. Now I dread going home and seeing his things. His food. His litter box. His toys. His brush. All his things. I get so anxious thinking about what he and the other cat went through that led to their death. I get anxious thinking about how my boyfriend is feeling. I keep randomly crying about it. My boyfriend doesn’t feel like discussing it further and I understand that’s how he is with his emotions. I just don’t know what to do with this. My boyfriend has a picture sticker on his coffee cup and every time I see it my eyes well up and I feel sick. I’m just kind of left to deal with this alone. I loved his cat so much. I treated him like I treat my own and loved him just as much. We spent a lot of time together over the past two years. But he wasn’t my cat and I have no say.

We are back to my boyfriend’s house now. It hurts. ",2,1753243076.0,Petloss,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1

“Father, I’m ready now. Please arrange my marriage. I’m going to divorce my husband Xander. If you still want me as your daughter, if you still want me as your family, then pick me up. Erase my identity. Help me disappear. So I can be free.”

I hung up before I could hear the disappointment slide into his voice.

Three days ago, I watched my half-sister and my husband’s mistress push me off a yacht while Xander laughed as I nearly drowned.

What’s worse is that I heard him say, “Just go ahead and kill the baby. I never wanted an heir that comes from her. I’ve regretted marrying her since day one. If it weren’t for Nadia leaving me for her career, none of this would’ve happened. She seduced me, so I had a night with her. Our parents forced us to marry, but it doesn’t matter now.”

So I lost the baby that night. And he never once cared.

That was the last straw.

I filed for divorce, packed my bags, and decided to marry the man I once swore I’d never choose because it was better than believing his lies.

But that wasn’t the end. I decided to fake my death, just to make sure he’d spend the rest of his life regretting he ever lost me.

\--

“Father, I’m ready now. Please arrange my marriage. I’m going to divorce my husband Xander.”

My voice cracked, but I kept my tone steady as I gripped the phone like it was the only thing tethering me to what little was left of me.

“What do you mean?” he asked, his tone sharp, biting like ice through the line. “You’re agreeing now to the marriage you rejected so stubbornly before? And divorcing Xander?”

I shut my eyes, pushing down the burn in my throat. “I changed my mind. I’m going to leave him. If you still want me as your daughter, if you still want me as your family, then pick me up. Erase my identity. Help me disappear. So I can be free.”

I hung up before I could hear the disappointment slide into his voice.

My hands trembled so badly I nearly dropped the phone. The hospital room was too bright, too white, the scent of antiseptic too clean to match the rot in my chest. I stared at the IV line snaking into my arm and felt the memory rise up like bile.

Three days ago, I was standing on a yacht off the coast of San Amaro. It was my husband Xander’s birthday party.

Nadia was also there. My half-sister. My husband’s mistress.

She sidled up next to me near the railing, “Why are you even here, Lauren?” she’d asked, twirling her glass lazily. “You’re always so out of place. You should’ve just stayed at home.”

I ignored her, but the words dug under my skin like glass splinters.

The yacht rocked gently beneath us. The party roared behind us — laughter, music, clinking glasses. Nadia leaned closer, her eyes glittering with something too dark to name. “Do us all a favor, sister. Leave. He doesn’t need you.”

I turned to shove past her and felt her hand on my arm. A single, deliberate push. My scream vanished under the splash as I hit the freezing black water.

“Oh no!” I heard her giggle. “She fell!”

I came up struggling for air, salt burning my eyes. I flailed in the darkness, each stroke more desperate than the last. I could see them above me — Nadia, giggling behind her hand, and Xander, my husband, glass in hand, head thrown back in laughter.

They didn’t move. They didn’t help. They watched me struggle as if I was an inconvenience, a stain on their perfect evening.

If it weren’t for the old fisherman who found me clinging to driftwood, I’d be at the bottom of that sea. But maybe that would’ve been kinder.

In the hospital, I begged the doctors not to take my baby. But the impact had been too much, my body was too battered. When they wheeled me in, I heard a voice cut through my sobbing.

“Just go ahead and kill the baby,” Xander told the doctor. “I don’t really care. Let both of them die for all I care.”

The doctor hesitated. “Sir, are you sure about this? It’s your heir—”

Xander scoffed, that cruel laugh I used to mistake for warmth. “I never wanted an heir that comes from her. I’ve regretted marrying her since day one. If it weren’t for Nadia leaving me for her career, none of this would’ve happened. She seduced me so I had a night with her, our parents forced us to marry, but it doesn’t matter now.”

Nadia’s voice drifted in, sweet and false. “Are you sure, Xander? It’s your baby… what do you think she would feel?”

He barely looked at her. “It’s better this way. I was already planning to slip something in her drink to get rid of the baby and her. Now I don’t have to. You know, you’re the only one I want, Nadia.”

Nadia whimpered, a pathetic, guilty laugh. “I’m sorry… for leaving you. For everything.”

Xander’s tone turned gentle. “It’s okay. As long as you promise you’ll never leave me again.”

“I promise,” she breathed.

And the last thing I heard was the steady beep of the monitor, mocking me as the life I carried inside me was scraped away while they planned the rest of their perfect life without me.

I snapped out of the memory when the door swung open. Xander stood there, a plastic smile on his perfect lips, carrying flowers and a tray of food like he was the devoted husband the world still believed him to be.

“Baby,” he said, voice dripping sweet poison. “I’m sorry I couldn’t come sooner, you know how the company is, so much to do. But I’m here now.”

Liar. In my mind, I could see him in Nadia’s bed, her red nails raking his back while my body lay here, stitched and empty.

“I made you shrimp,” he said, placing the tray on my lap. “Your favorite.”

I stared at the plate. Nadia loved shrimp. I was allergic.

“I don’t want it.”

He stiffened, eyes flashing. “Don’t be dramatic. Isn’t it enough that our daughter died because of you? Shouldn’t you apologize to me?”

Before I could speak, his phone buzzed. He didn’t even hide the name. Nadia.

“I’m going to answer this. Eat. Don’t make this harder than it already is,” he hissed. “I’ll be back.”

I heard his voice through the crack in the door. “It’s me, baby. Oh, okay. I’m coming. Don’t cry.”

And he never came back to me.

I let him be. I was done.

I finally called my lawyer.

“It’s me. Lauren Valeria. I want to file for divorce.”

Chapter 2

The lawyer’s voice on the other end of the line was steady but hesitant. “Mrs. Valeria, I just need to ask again, are you absolutely sure you want to proceed with filing for divorce? You do remember the prenup you signed with Mr. Valeria. It says you can’t legally divorce unless… well… unless one of you is dead.”

I pressed the phone harder to my ear, staring at the cold hospital floor. “Don’t worry,” I whispered. “I’ll be dead in a few days anyway. So just… finalize it.”

Before he could argue, I hung up. The silence that followed buzzed like static in my ears.

I started pulling the tape off the IV in my arm when my phone lit up on the side table. Another message. I didn’t even have to look to know what it was — it always came at the same time, like clockwork.

When I finally opened it, there it was: a video. Nadia’s giggle. Xander’s low laugh. The shaky image of them tangled together in his hotel suite. Again. The fiftieth video she’d sent me — always labeled Oops, sorry, wrong send. Always just enough to remind me who I really was in their eyes.

I didn’t cry. I didn’t break the phone. I didn’t even bother to watch it all the way through. I just tossed it into my bag, finished taping gauze over the IV mark, and zipped up my small suitcase.

I was done.

As I waited for the nurse to finish the discharge papers, my mind drifted to the first time everything really started to fall apart — long before Xander, long before the yacht.

I was fifteen when my mother shattered my world. She’d been cheating on my father with Nadia’s father for years — I’d always heard the late-night calls, the slammed doors, the crying. When the divorce papers came, I thought I’d stay with Dad. But Mom forced me to come with her. “A daughter belongs with her mother,” she said.

That was the first time I felt truly unwanted.

At first, living with Nadia didn’t feel so bad. She was sweet — bright, giggly, the daughter everyone adored. We shared secrets, clothes, and whispered about our dreams at night. But it didn’t take long for the cracks to show. When she didn’t get her way, she’d cry to our parents. And somehow, the blame always landed on me.

When we were older, I saw her drape herself over Xander at family parties. They’d been closer than siblings, even though they weren’t by blood. She told me they were together. But then she left him for her acting dreams abroad. He was drunk the night I found him alone on the balcony, eyes red, whiskey in hand.

I was stupid. I thought comforting him meant I mattered. That night was a mistake for him — for me, it was the start of my ruin.

When the tabloids leaked photos of us, the scandal nearly destroyed both families. A quick wedding was the only fix. I convinced myself it was fate. And for two short years, it almost felt real. Until she came back. Until she stood in my kitchen, sipping my coffee, saying I’d seduced her man.

Xander defended me, or so I thought — until I found them in my bed. It never really ended. It only grew more blatant.

And now they didn’t even bother to hide it.

My mind snapped back to the hallway when I heard footsteps. Voices. Laughter.

“…are you sure you’re okay to be here?” Nadia asked, her voice a low, sweet drawl.

“Of course,” Xander replied, so casual. “It’s not like she died.”

My breath caught behind the corner. I pressed my back to the cold wall.

Nadia giggled. “But what if she finds out about our baby?”

“So what?” he scoffed. “It doesn’t matter. You’re the one I want to have my child, not her. We’ll surely get married soon. I promise you.”

The words stung worse than any wound on my body. They disappeared into his room, shutting the door. Three months pregnant, I heard Nadia say. Their baby. And yet they’d stolen mine from me like it was nothing.

When I got home, I opened the closet and started packing. Everything Xander had ever given me — the clothes, the jewelry, the perfume he said made me smell expensive. All of it went into a black trash bag. He didn’t deserve to see me draped in anything he’d bought to cover the truth.

I was shoving shoes into the bag when the front door slammed. I froze as my mother’s perfume hit me before she did.

She slapped me so hard my ear rang. “What on earth did you do with our money, Lauren?”

I stared at her, blinking back the stars in my vision. “What are you talking about?”

She shoved a folder of bank statements into my chest. “Gambling? All those debts under your name? We lost everything! Do you know how embarrassing this is for me?”

I shook my head, my voice a whisper. “No… I didn’t— I never—”

“It’s your name!” she screamed. “You filthy, useless—”

Nadia’s voice floated in behind her like a snake’s hiss. “Mom, what’s wrong?”

My mother whirled around. “Your sister’s a gambler! She ruined us!”

Nadia winced — wide-eyed, all innocent sweetness. “Mom, I wanted to tell you. I found out weeks ago but… I didn’t want Lauren to get mad at me for telling. I’m so sorry, Mom. I should have told you.”

My mouth dropped open. “That’s a lie! You used my name—”

The second slap split my lip. “Liar! After everything I did for you!” My mother grabbed a handful of my hair and yanked until I screamed.

Nadia just stood behind her, eyes wide and fake-sorry.

That night, my mother hit me until I couldn’t feel my arms, my ribs, my legs — fifty strikes that burned like acid on my skin. Xander didn’t stop her. Nadia didn’t flinch. They just watched. Smirking. Whispering. Mocking.

But as I lay on the floor, curled around my bruises, I promised myself one thing: Just a few more days. Just hold on a little longer.

And then I’d be gone.

Chapter 3

I woke up on the cold concrete floor of the storage room, my body curled awkwardly under a scratchy blanket that smelled of mold and stale oil. Every inch of me ached — ribs, hips, the side of my face still raw where my mother’s ring had cut into my cheek.

I shifted, trying to sit up, and bit back a scream when pain shot through my shoulder. That was when the door creaked open and Nadia stepped in.

“Oh, look who’s finally awake,” she cooed, voice dripping with fake sweetness. She turned to Xander standing just behind her. “Don’t worry, I’ll take care of her.”

Xander’s eyes flicked over me like I was a stain on his floor. “Just let her rot. She’s nothing to us now.”

Nadia turned back, her smile sharpening like a blade. She shut the door and knelt next to me, pulling a first aid kit from behind her back.

“Let’s get you cleaned up, hmm? Poor thing.”

She pressed a cloth to the cut on my lip — too hard, too long, like she enjoyed the way I flinched. I hissed in pain, but she only laughed.

“You know,” she said, pressing down even harder, “you’ll never be enough for this family. Got it? Never. Not when you’re nothing but a little seductress stealing what was mine.”

My voice cracked. “I never stole him. You left—”

She slapped a hand over my mouth, nails digging into my cheek. “Shut up. I went for my dreams. You think you’re special because you were the perfect replacement? Look where that got you.”

She pulled out a battered lunchbox, flipping it open so the stale smell hit my nose immediately. “Eat,” she said, voice too bright. “I made it myself. Don’t be ungrateful.”

She shoved a spoon toward my lips, and I realized it was shrimp. My throat closed up on instinct — I was allergic. I turned my head away, but Nadia’s grip on my jaw was iron.

“Eat it, Lauren! Don’t be dramatic now. Eat it!” she hissed, jabbing the spoon against my lips. My stomach turned, bile rising up so fast I nearly choked.

In that moment, something in my mind flickered — a memory from when we were kids. Nadia and I giggling under blankets, sharing secrets. Back when we were sisters in the truest sense — until I won that school contest, until they put my face on the cover of the community paper. She’d been so furious. She’d told everyone I cheated. One by one, my friends turned their backs. The teachers glared. The principal called me a liar.

And Nadia just stood there, pretty and innocent, saying, “I’m sorry. I tried to stop her. She loves attention too much.”

The taste of the shrimp snapped me back. I gagged, vomiting onto the floor. Nadia moved back, shrieking in disgust. “You freak! You did that on purpose—”

The door flew open. Xander stepped in, annoyance already etched into his features. “What the heck is going on now?”

Nadia turned to him, her eyes wide, voice trembling. “I was trying to help her, Xander! I made her food and she threw it up! She hates me—”

Xander’s face twisted with disgust as he looked at me, weak and trembling on the floor. “You ungrateful woman. She’s trying to feed you and you can’t even be thankful?”

They mocked me then. Both of them. Their voices mixed together — little jabs, half-laughs, like I wasn’t even there. But I didn’t hear it for long. The edges of my vision went fuzzy, my head spun, and the world finally went dark.

When I woke up again, I was in a hospital bed. The walls were clean. The sheets smelled like bleach. A nurse hovered over me, frowning as she checked the bruises blooming across my arms.

“You’re lucky,” she said quietly. “You went into shock from the allergy and the injuries. You need rest.”

I stared at the ceiling, tears pooling but never falling. “Do you need me to call your family?” the nurse asked gently.

Family. The word scraped against my ribs like broken glass. I turned my head away and whispered, “No. There is no family anymore. I’m all alone.”

The nurse squeezed my shoulder, pity in her eyes. She left me with my thoughts. The steady beep of the monitor filled the room. My phone vibrated in my pocket. For a moment I thought it was my father — maybe he’d finally come for me. But when I answered, the voice on the other end wasn’t his.

“Lauren.”

My breath caught. Noah. His voice was the same as always — smooth, sharp, a warmth I hadn’t felt in years. “I heard from your father,” he said. “So you’re finally divorcing him, huh?”

I swallowed, my throat raw. “Yes. I’m done with him. I… I want out. Noah… do you still want me?”

He laughed — low, easy, like he already knew my answer. “Of course I do. You’re mine, Lauren. You always have been. I’ll pick you up myself — give me a few days. I can’t wait to make you mine for real this time.”

I shut my eyes, a strange heat blooming in my chest. “Yes. I’ll be waiting for you.”

When the call ended, I let myself hope for a breath — just a small taste of freedom. But then a shadow fell over my bed. I looked up — and there he was.

Xander. His eyes narrowed, lips curled into that cold half-smirk.

“Who were you talking to?” he asked, his voice low. “Are you cheating on me now, Lauren?”

Before I could reach for my phone, his hand shot out and snatched it from my fingers.

Chapter 4

“Open it now,” Xander demanded, his hand gripping my phone like it was his property — like I was his property rather than wife.

I forced my voice to stay calm, even as my skin crawled. “The password is my birthday.”

He snorted, thumbs tapping the screen. “Easy. December 5.”

A bitter laugh slipped out before I could stop it. “That’s not my birthday. That’s Nadia’s.”

His fingers froze mid-tap. He looked up, confusion flashing across his face before it twisted into irritation. “So what? Why are you being dramatic again, Lauren? It’s not that important.”

Not that important. Three years of marriage, one lost child, and he didn’t even know the day I was born. But deep down, I knew — he could recite every detail about Nadia without missing a beat. Her birthday. Her favorite food. The exact shade of lipstick she wore to bed.

Me? I was just… here.

I looked away, voice strained. “It never mattered, did it?”

He didn’t answer. He just tossed the phone back onto the side table, already bored. “Never mind that. Get up. You’re being discharged today.”

I blinked. “What? I’m not ready — I can’t even walk properly yet.”

“So what?” His tone turned sharp. “You’re needed at home. Your mother’s birthday party needs arranging. You know how she is, and Nadia and I don’t have time to handle it.”

My mouth dropped open. “Xander, I can barely stand! And I’m not apologizing to Nadia. She gave me shrimp on purpose, she knew I was allergic—”

He rolled his eyes so dramatically it made my blood boil. “There you go again, always blaming someone else. You’re so stubborn, Lauren. This is exactly why you’ve never been at her level. She’s everything you’re not — useful, graceful, wanted. You? You should’ve died instead of our child.”

His words punched the air out of my lungs. But before I could find something — anything — to throw back at him, the door swung open.

Nadia drifted in, her soft fake smile plastered onto her perfect lips. She carried a bouquet of lilies, my least favorite flower, and cooed, “How are you feeling, sister? Do you need anything? We were so worried.”

I stared right through her, the rage in my chest a furnace. I was done pretending.

Xander’s hand pressed down hard on my shoulder. “Apologize to her, Lauren. Right now.”

“No.”

His grip tightened, nails digging into my skin. “Apologize.”

Nadia tilted her head, pouting. “Don’t make this harder than it needs to be. Just say sorry, Lauren. I forgive you.”

Forgive me. For what? For surviving? For watching my baby die while they planned their perfect life?

I bit down the scream building in my throat and said nothing. No tears this time. Just cold silence. That seemed to annoy them more than any begging would have.

“Fine,” Xander snapped. “Be that way. But you’re still coming home to plan Mother’s party. You owe us that much.”

They dragged me out of the hospital before the nurse could even check my bandages properly. Back at the house, they left me in the guest room to recover — but I knew better. I was nothing more than a maid with a ruined body and a name they could blame for their messes.

I forced myself out of bed that night. I found every piece of our so-called life together — the wedding album we never finished, the love notes he used to scribble when he still needed to convince me he cared, the designer dresses he gifted me after every scandal. All of it.

I dragged the box to the garden, the cold air biting at my bruised skin. One by one, I dropped the memories onto a pile. When the match flared, I didn’t flinch. I watched the flames eat the lace, the letters, the lies. Sparks rose into the sky like tiny ghosts, each one carrying a piece of the girl who once thought she was loved.

I whispered to the fire, “Few more days. Just a few more.”

Back inside, I lay on the cold sheets, heart pounding as my phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with a single message from my father: Everything is ready. Noah will pick you up soon. It’s time to disappear.

I read it twice, my chest tightening in a strange, sharp way — part fear, part hope. Free. It didn’t feel real yet, but it was coming.

I pressed the phone to my chest and let out a shaky breath. I pictured Noah’s steady eyes, his warm voice telling me I was his. I pictured the way I’d walk out of this prison with nothing but a suitcase and my name finally wiped clean.

No more wife. No more daughter. Just Lauren — whoever that might be.

The next morning, they forced me to stand at the dining table, drawing up guest lists, talking about catering like nothing had happened. Nadia stood at Xander’s side, her hand resting on his arm like she’d never left it.

When our eyes met, she smirked — that little tilt of her lips that said, You’re still here. And you’re still nothing.

But inside, I felt it like a heartbeat under my ribs: Not for long.

Tomorrow, I'll be gone.

Chapter 5

The morning of my mother’s birthday dawned clear and cold. I sat in my vanity, pretending to fuss with my hair. I could hear Nadia’s high laugh echoing down the hallway

One more hour, I told myself. Just let them leave.

The door slammed open behind me. Nadia stood there in her silk robe. Her eyes flicked to my chest and then she lunged. I didn’t even have time to flinch before her fingers closed around the thin silver chain my father had given me when I turned sixteen.

“Give that back!” I shouted, grabbing at her wrist, but her other hand was already fisted in my hair, yanking me backward until I cried out.

“This? This cheap little thing?” she sneered, her breath hot against my ear. “You don’t deserve it. Daddy’s favorite, huh? How’s that working out for you now?”

I grabbed her wrist, yanking the necklace back so hard it cut into my palm. “It’s mine, give it back!”

She laughed in my face. “You think he cares about you now? You think anyone does?”

Something inside me snapped. My palm came up before I could stop it, I slapped him.

Nadia froze for a split second, shock flashing in her eyes, before she recoiled, pressing her fingers dramatically to the red mark blooming on her skin.

The door slammed open. Xander’s voice sliced through the air. “What is going on?”

Nadia let out a shaky little sob, eyes wide and brimming with tears that weren’t real. “She hit me, Xander! I just wanted to borrow the necklace for the party, it would’ve matched my dress, but she went crazy! I was only trying to help her get ready—”

“That’s a lie!” I hissed. “She took my necklace—”

But before I could finish, my mother appeared behind him, hair perfect, eyes glittering with the kind of disgust she never bothered to hide. “Lauren, you ungrateful child. You can’t behave for one day?”

My fingers tightened around the tiny chain, my father’s last promise digging into my palm. “She stole it, she—”

“Enough!” Xander snapped. “You’re not going. I won’t have you embarrassing us in front of important people. You stay here.”

“You can’t—”

My mother’s cold hand came down on my shoulder. “You’ve been nothing but a shame since into this family. You stay here and think about what you cost us.”

Before I could blink, the door slammed shut. The lock clicked.

I pressed my back to the door, my shoulders trembling as I sank to the floor.

Through the door, I could hear Nadia’s giggle, soft and smug. “It’s better this way, don’t you think? We can’t let her ruin today.”

Their footsteps faded down the hall, their voices trailing off with the sound of the cars pulling away one by one. And then finally, the house fell still.

I grabbed my phone, my hands shaking as I pulled up Noah’s number. I pressed call, praying he’d answer. He did before the first ring even finished.

“Lauren?”

His voice was so warm I almost broke. “They locked me in,” I whispered. “They left for the party, but they locked me in. I’m ready to go, please, Noah. I can’t stay here.”

A low growl rumbled through the line, that same protective anger that made me believe him when he said he’d save me. “Stay right where you are. I’ll be there soon, baby. You hear me? You’re not going to spend one more night in that place.”

A tear slipped down my cheek. I didn’t bother to wipe it away. “I’m ready to leave.”

Third person’s pov

Back at the grand ballroom, the celebration that was supposed to showcase perfection was already teetering on chaos.

Guests milled around awkwardly beneath the glittering chandeliers. The tables were half-empty, no servers in sight, and the main buffet remained sealed shut in the catering trucks that never arrived. No music drifted through the hall.

Lauren’s mother was the first to snap. Her sharp voice cut through the crowd like a whip as she rounded on Xander, who was standing near the bar, checking his phone for the third time in five minutes.

“Where is she?!” her mother hissed. “Where is that useless girl? She’s the one who was supposed to handle all this, the catering, the band! I want her here now.”

Xander’s jaw twitched. He hit call again. Voicemail. He tried again. Voicemail. A few of the guests had started whispering and pointing at the tense knot of family near the stage. Someone coughed to hide a laugh when the music still didn’t start.

“She’s not picking up,” Xander muttered, teeth grinding together. “You! Go check if she’s at home. Now.”

A hush rippled through the room as a butler stepped forward, carrying a small, elegant box with a white ribbon tied perfectly on top.

“Sir?” the butler said, clearing his throat nervously. “This just arrived for you. Delivered directly at the gate. It’s… from Mrs. Lauren.”

Xander ripped the lid off then froze. Inside, nestled on crisp white paper, were two things: Lauren’s wedding ring and a single, crisp set of divorce papers. Her signature sat at the bottom in steady, deliberate strokes.

The blood drained from Xander’s face. Nadia peered over his shoulder, her painted lips curling into a sneer. “Oh. She’s divorcing you finally?” she said.

Lauren’s mother let out a furious screech, drawing startled bursts from the guests. “Find her! Now! She’s not going to humiliate this family, not like this. Bring her back here this instant!”

But before they could move, the butler stepped forward again, sweat beading on his brow. “Sir, there’s more. The… the house, it’s—”

“What?” Xander barked. “What about the house?”

The butler swallowed hard. “There’s a fire, sir. It’s spreading through the kitchen, the storage, the staff are saying it’s bad. The whole back wing is gone.”

“And Lauren? Is she there? Where is she?” Xander asked.

The butler hesitated. Everyone fell silent, watching his lips move, waiting for the words that would break the last fragile thread holding them all together.

“I’m afraid,” the butler said with a raspy voice, “she was still inside. She… she burned with the fire… and it seems like Mrs. Lauren is dead.",1,1753242957.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

The school holidays are here and you’re probably wondering what to do with all that time your child suddenly has. You want something more than just “keeping them busy.” You want them engaged, learning, safe, and having fun. At the same time, you need a break from constantly thinking up ways to fill the day. That’s where a well-run[ school holiday program](https://kidzotc.com.sg/school-holiday-program/) makes all the difference.

Now, not every program will work for every child. Some are too rigid. Others feel more like school in disguise. But the right one? It gives your child freedom to explore, space to grow, and the kind of joy that doesn’t disappear by bedtime. Whether your little one loves messy play or your teen wants real-world challenges, there’s a place that matches that energy and gives you some breathing room, too.

**When the Free Time Starts to Feel Like Too Much**

The first few days of school break usually go fine. Your child sleeps in, plays more, and relaxes. But then the boredom kicks in. You start to hear, “I don’t know what to do,” about ten times before lunch. And suddenly, those long days don’t feel so restful anymore.

That’s why structure matters. A school holiday program isn’t there to wear your child out. It’s there to guide their day so they feel focused, connected, and fulfilled. They get new experiences, new friends, and a break from the usual screen time loop. You get peace of mind knowing they’re in a setting that keeps them active and curious without burning them out.

**Your Child’s Needs Aren’t Average. Their Program Shouldn’t Be Either.**

No two children are the same. That’s why the idea of one program for all ages just doesn’t hold up. You know your child best. Some thrive in groups. Others like quiet focus. What works for one might overwhelm another.

For younger kids, the best learning happens through movement, play, and exploration. Sensory play school holiday sessions give them room to touch, build, and imagine without too many rules or expectations. That freedom helps their brains develop in ways that stick.

Older children crave social interaction. They’re starting to see where they fit in, how to share ideas, and what teamwork really means. Activities that involve stories, creative projects, or outdoor group games keep them engaged and growing.

If you’ve got a teen, you know they want choices. They want to be respected and spoken to like young adults. A strong school holiday program for their age group includes things like tech, leadership, design, or real-world problem-solving. It’s about respect. It’s about challenges. And yes, it can still be fun.

**The Signs That Say: “Yes, This Is the One”**

How do you know when a holiday program’s really worth it? You start with how it makes your child feel. Do you see their faces light up when they share their stories? Do they feel safe walking into that space?

Great programs don’t just tick boxes. They create emotional safety. Look for settings that honour differences and offer support where needed. If your child has learning or developmental needs, special needs holiday camps provide trained staff and thoughtful routines that make participation less stressful and more rewarding.

And ask questions. What’s the daily rhythm like? How do they handle tough days? Will someone notice if your child is struggling quietly in the background? The answers tell you whether the people running it care about children as individuals and not just numbers in a group.

**Why the Fun Your Child Has Isn’t Just for Now**

You might think your child’s just playing. But under the surface, a lot more is happening. Play is where learning sneaks in without feeling forced.

That group obstacle course? It’s teaching teamwork and resilience. The baking session? That’s measurement, planning, and confidence. Every time your child tries something new and smiles at the result, they’re growing bit by bit.

Some programmes include occupational therapy workshops for kids, offering gentle, helpful support within regular activities. These sessions improve coordination, communication, and focus. And they don’t feel clinical or intimidating. They simply feel like they’re part of the adventure.

**The Impact Doesn’t End When the Break Does**

You want your child to return to school refreshed, not wired from weeks of overstimulation or bored from too much screen time. A balanced holiday program makes that possible. Your child heads back more confident, more relaxed, and maybe even with a new friend or two.

And if they’re receiving extra support during the term, you’ll be glad to know that children’s therapy holiday activities can help them hold onto their progress. These aren’t add-ons. They’re thoughtful ways to continue development without pressure.

You also deserve a break. A trusted program gives you hours back in your day. Whether it’s for work, errands, or just sitting down for a quiet coffee, you get your balance back too.

**Finding the Right Fit Doesn’t Need to Be Complicated**

Start simple. Think about your child’s energy levels, their comfort in groups, and what excites them. Some children need gentle guidance. Others need space to lead. Matching that to a program’s tone and options makes all the difference.

Some families prefer school break enrichment programs that lean into academics through creativity. These might look like science projects, music sessions, or problem-solving games. It’s not tutoring. It’s learning that feels like play.

If possible, visit in person. Pay attention to how the staff engage with the children. Observe the environment, how the day unfolds, and the way instructions are shared. Trust your instincts. A warm welcome and clear structure usually say more than any brochure can.

**You’re Not Just Choosing a Program. You’re Choosing How They’ll Remember This Break.**

What sticks with your child after the holidays isn’t the peaceful afternoons or the chores they didn’t have to do. It’s the friendships they made. The new skills they tried. The confidence they found when they weren’t even looking for it.

A trusted school holiday program can bring all that into your child’s world. It supports their growth, matches their stage, and reminds them that learning can be joyful even when school’s out.

And for you? It’s one less thing to worry about. It lets you give your attention to what truly matters. Raising a happy, thriving child who feels supported, not just during term time, but in every season.

You shouldn’t have to start every day already worn out. If your mornings feel foggy, your nights stretch thin, and your mood more unpredictable than usual, sleep might be the root cause. And not the kind of sleep you think you’re getting but the kind your body desperately needs and isn’t receiving.

It’s easy to write off poor sleep. You’ve told yourself it’s stress, it’ll pass, or that you just need to cut back on screens. But when the problem sticks around, when no routine seems to fix it, you’re not dealing with a simple bad night’s sleep. You’re dealing with a cycle that’s now affecting everything else, your energy, your focus, even your relationships. That’s when seeing a[ sleep specialist Singapore](https://sgsleepsolutions.com/) can change everything.

At some point, sleeping through the night shouldn’t feel like a struggle. But if it does, and it’s been doing so for a while, this guide is for you. Here are the top seven signs you shouldn’t ignore any longer.

# 1. You wake up feeling worse than when you went to bed.

It’s frustrating, isn’t it? You spend the right number of hours in bed. You even try to wind down properly. Yet every morning feels like you didn’t sleep at all. You drag yourself out of bed, already counting the hours until you can crawl back into it.

When sleep doesn’t leave you refreshed, it usually means your body isn’t entering or staying in deep sleep long enough. This can happen for several reasons, like sleep apnoea or subtle disruptions in your breathing or movement during the night. Most people aren’t even aware it’s happening until they’ve had a proper assessment.

This is where sleep therapy consultation can make a real difference. It helps uncover what’s really going on while you sleep. Sometimes the issue isn’t how long you sleep. It's how well you do it.

# 2. Your snoring isn’t just loud. It’s alarming

If you’ve ever been told you snore like a chainsaw or stop breathing in your sleep, that’s not something to ignore. Yes, snoring can seem like an annoyance, but when it’s loud, erratic, or includes moments where you gasp for air, it could mean your airway is getting blocked during sleep.

That’s a serious red flag. It often points to obstructive sleep apnoea. This condition means your breathing stops and starts throughout the night, lowering oxygen levels and constantly pulling you out of restful sleep even if you don’t fully wake up.

If this sounds familiar, don’t just hope it improves. Start with a sleep apnea diagnosis. It might involve a simple sleep study, and the treatment could be far easier than you think. Addressing it early prevents years of fatigue, heart strain, and foggy thinking.

And yes, there are proper snoring and sleep disorder solutions that go beyond earplugs and sleeping on your side.

# 3. You lie awake for hours, every single night

You’re physically tired, but your mind refuses to slow down. The lights go out, but your thoughts don’t. They rush, rewind, skip ahead, and all the while, time keeps moving. Midnight turns to 2 a.m., and morning creeps closer without rest in sight.

If it takes you more than 30 minutes to fall asleep most nights, or you keep waking up and can’t fall back asleep, that’s not just a phase. It’s insomnia. And it won’t go away with warm milk and a better pillow.

You might need support from an insomnia treatment specialist. These professionals don’t just offer sleep tips. They look at your habits, your stress triggers, even the way your body responds to light and time. And they’ll help you build a routine that works with your body, not against it.

# 4. You wake up at night and can’t explain why

The first few times, you might’ve thought it was a one-off. But now it’s happening again and again. You wake up in silence, heart pounding, no light, and no reason. Just a jarring sense that sleep left without warning. And then the restlessness begins.

This kind of pattern wrecks your sleep cycle. Your body never reaches the deep stages it needs to heal and reset. Over time, you start to feel it: your energy drops, your memory falters, and you become short-tempered for reasons you can’t fully explain.

Don’t wait until it affects your job or relationships. A sleep specialist can run simple tests to understand what’s pulling you out of sleep and help you stay asleep the full night through.

# 5. You’re dozing off in meetings or on the road

Daytime sleepiness is more than just a lack of caffeine. If you’re dozing off during quiet moments, zoning out in traffic, or struggling to focus even when you’ve had a “full night” of sleep, something deeper is off.

You’re not lazy. You’re not being dramatic. Your body’s trying to tell you it’s not getting the rest it needs at night. And sometimes, it’s conditions like narcolepsy or sleep apnoea that are quietly behind the scenes.

When your body pushes you toward sleep during the day, it’s sending a clear signal. Don’t ignore it. Seek help through sleep clinic services. A quick consultation might reveal issues that have been hiding for years and you’ll finally get the tools to fix them.

# 6. You can’t function without coffee or pills

One cup becomes three. One pill becomes a routine. You find yourself relying on caffeine to stay alert and sleeping aids to shut down. At first, it worked. Now? You’re wired when you don’t want to be, and groggy when you’re trying to focus.

This dependency builds slowly but ends up hijacking your natural sleep-wake rhythm. And when your body forgets how to sleep on its own, the struggle multiplies. You’re constantly chasing sleep or fighting to stay awake, but never feeling balanced.

This isn’t sustainable and it’s not your fault. With the right support, you can reset your body’s internal clock. You can finally wake up without stimulants and fall asleep without help. It starts with reaching out to a specialist who gets it.

# 7. Your mood is a mess and your mind feels foggy

You’ve noticed a shift. You snap more than usual. You feel low, disconnected, sometimes on edge for no clear reason. You forget simple things. Your work suffers. Your patience with loved ones thins.

Sleep touches everything. When your brain doesn’t get what it needs at night, it can’t regulate emotion, attention, or memory. This leads to mood swings, anxiety, and a lack of motivation that starts to feel like your new normal.

But it’s not who you are. It's what your body is missing. And a sleep specialist can help you understand the connection. The solution isn’t always more sleep. It's better, deeper, uninterrupted sleep.

# What to expect from a sleep consultation

You don’t need to know the exact problem before you make an appointment. That’s the specialist’s job. You’ll go through a detailed chat about your sleep habits, daytime struggles, medical history, and lifestyle. Then, if needed, you might do a sleep study either at home or in a sleep centre.

These tests track your breathing, brain activity, movement, and oxygen levels while you sleep. Once that’s done, the findings help shape your treatment plan. This could include breathing support, medication, therapy, or simple habit adjustments that are easy to follow but make a big difference.

What matters most? You’ll stop guessing. You’ll finally understand what’s happening at night and what your body’s really asking for.

Hey Beautiful (TY)

This letter doesn’t come from bravado or ego. It comes from the deepest truth I’ve ever known. This isn’t a man trying to win something, it’s a man who already found everything when he found you.

Neither of us were looking for anyone that night. We had both been carrying our own stories quietly surviving, not searching. We were just two souls, bruised and tired, both craving something we couldn’t name. We weren’t out to fall in love we had no idea that love was waiting for us.

But then… we decided to snuggle.  Just friend holding each other.  So we thought!

It started small. Gentle. A simple snuggle, nothing more than a moment of comfort between two friends. A human touch. A shared breath. A need we didn’t speak aloud, but both deeply felt. We didn’t expect it to become anything. Just warmth in a cold world.

But that moment! God, that moment became everything.

Because when I held you that night, I didn’t just hold a body. I held peace. I held home. Your green eyes looked straight into my soul, and for the first time in so long, my blue eyes saw someone who wasn’t afraid of my truth. You leaned into me fully clothed, fully human, fully you and with that single gesture, you rewrote what peace meant to me.

You didn’t rescue me. You met me. In the dark. In the silence. In the ache.

We had both been through our own kinds of chaos, betrayals that left scars, lies we tried to believe, endings disguised as beginnings. But that night, your breath near mine, your body curled against my chest, my soul sighed. Like a river finally freed from the dam. It didn’t crash. It didn’t roar. It simply flowed the way it was always meant to, bending, reshaping, softening everything hardened by life.

We weren’t falling in love. We were healing.

And in healing, we found something pure, something we didn’t expect, but couldn’t deny. Soulmates. Not in a fantasy way, but in the realest, rawest sense. Two people whose wounds recognized each other. Two hearts that weren’t just open, they were ready.

Loving you has been the most real thing I’ve ever done. You didn’t just love me, you saw me. And in return, I gave you the best love I knew how. But I also see now that love alone isn’t enough when we haven’t healed the parts of us that were still hurting. It wasn’t love that failed. It was the pieces of me I hadn’t yet faced.

That’s on me, my love.

Please know, I heard you. Every word. Every truth. Even the hard ones. And I didn’t let them pass me by. For the past four and almost six months, I’ve been sitting with the mirror, with the pain, with a therapist who is helping me walk through the wreckage. I’m not doing this for a second chance. I’m doing it because you were the mirror. You made me realize that if I want to love you the way you deserve, I have to become the man I deserve to be.

And because… I want you to be proud to love me back.

You are not just any woman. You are the first person I have ever truly, undeniably, wholeheartedly loved. Not in a way that sounds good on paper, but in the way that makes me certain I will marry you one day, if you’ll let me.

And if I leave this earth before you, know that my soul will stay. Holding your hand while you sleep. Whispering love into your dreams. Because my love doesn’t end not with distance, not with silence, not even with death. It only deepens. It only begins again.

I promise, if you choose to hand me your heart one more time, you will never hear my voice raised in anger. Not once. There will be nothing that will separate us again! We will never again choose to leave, we will choose to stay and grow! Together, like we both know we were ment to! I promise you this… I will always stay.

I want the life we almost had and more. I want the laughter, the chaos, the coffee in bed, the kids running through the house, the late-night talks, the forgiveness after the hard moments, the honest love that says “you’re safe here” even when life gets loud.

I don’t want a perfect love. I want ours.

This isn’t just my truth, it’s my invitation. To you. To us. To the kind of love that deserves to rise again. Not because it’s flawless, but because it is real. And real love? It’s worth the fight. It’s worth the healing. It’s worth a second, or in my case third and final chance.

So here I am. All in. 100%. No armor. No games. No ego. Just me, healed and healing, loving and ready.

If even a piece of your heart remembers that night, that peace, that love… I’m here.

I am already ready to come to you, my home.

Forever and Always,
Your blue eyed love(SB)

If you have any specific questions I didn’t cover here feel free to ask, and if you want help on your specific situation feel free to message me!

Brief background: I gained admission to 10 PhD programs, all of which were in the top 20s for their respective fields (Chemical Biology, Biosciences, Molecular and Cellular Biology)— 5 were in the top 10 in the United States. I got 5 rejections. I now participate in my program’s student admissions committee, meaning that I participate in the evaluation of applicants, interview students, and get an inside view into the admissions process. I’ve also helped many prospective students with their applications, so I’ve seen a lot of the common pitfalls that come with these kinds of applications. I love helping people figure their path, and I find myself giving many of these pieces of advice to everyone who is applying so I thought I’d put it all in one place in case any of you are in this boat.

Because I had a low GPA and less undergraduate research experience than my peers, I was extremely intentional about how I approached the process, and tried to set myself up for success as much as possible. While this is nowhere near comprehensive, I wanted to share some of what I’ve learned. Much of this is geared towards PhDs broadly in the biological sciences in the US, but I hope much of it translates to other disciplines. 

Picking schools and programs

* Before doing anything else, clarify *what* you want to do and *why* you want to do it. If you don’t know the answer yet, you may not be ready for a PhD. I often see applicants who want a PhD but don’t care deeply about a specific problem or field. That lack of authentic passion comes across clearly in applications and interviews. You don't have to narrow it down to a granular level but you should have broad scientific questions you're eager to address. The best thing you can do is focus and narrow your field.
* You might assume that applying to many different fields or types of programs increases your chances of getting in somewhere, but that’s not necessarily true. PhD programs heavily weigh your demonstrated interest in their specific discipline. If you have relevant experience and can talk about it with insight, passion, and clarity, you’ll stand out.
* Start with the type of research and the PIs, not the school or the program. Once you know what you want to study, identify faculty whose work aligns with those interests. This matters far more than rankings or school names, and the process takes time. If you can list PIs whose research connects to your background and interests, your application will be far more compelling.
* Figuring out what you want to study and narrowing that down is a process in itself. Broadly: read as much as possible, attend as many seminars as you can (especially in person), ask questions, and speak with the presenters if possible.
* Lots of informational interviews with students. I probably had around 20 coffee chats with current PhD students, asking about their paths, how they got into grad school, and what kind of research they’re doing now. These conversations helped me clarify my own goals and direction.
* Don’t treat this like applying to college. You don’t need “safeties”—the safety is simply not doing a PhD. Don’t apply to programs you wouldn’t seriously consider attending. It’s a waste of time, energy, and money.

Showing real passion

* Programs want to know that you genuinely want to pursue a PhD, and it’s difficult to fake true enthusiasm. A PhD is long, and difficult— if you don’t love this kind of work, you’re unlikely to stick with it. Don’t be afraid to show your excitement in your personal statement, emails, and interviews.
* A PhD requires initiative and independent. If you can’t do basic research about a program, lab, or field, that’s a red flag. Don’t ask questions that are easily answered by a Google search or on the program’s website. The people you're contacting, like faculty, administrators, and students, have more input into admissions than you might expect.
* On the flip side, asking thoughtful and specific questions works in your favor. It shows that you’ve done your homework and are seriously interested. I have a long list of questions I asked PIs during interviews: questions about mentorship style, research direction, lab culture, etc. Never ask something you could have found online.
* Remember: a PhD is a professional degree. Act accordingly. Proofread your emails. Treat everyone with respect. Be proactive and prepared. How you conduct yourself in these small interactions reflects on your overall readiness for this type of work.
* And if you’re not quite ready, that’s completely okay. There’s no shame in taking time to work before applying. I did, and it benefitted me immensely.

Emailing/connecting with PIs before applying

* At many schools with rotational programs, admissions decisions aren’t just a matter of ranking applicants. If a PI on the committee likes you, you may be evaluated differently. That’s why making connections in advance can give you an edge. It’s absolutely essential for direct-admit programs, and still very important for rotational ones. 
* That said, I’ve seen a lot of poorly written PI emails that probably hurt the applicant more than they helped. When contacting a PI, your main goal is to demonstrate why you’d be an asset to their lab and express your genuine interest in joining if admitted. If you have a clear vision for your PhD, that will come through naturally. Avoid sending a generic or templated email. Do ask to meet if they have time. And don’t be discouraged if they don’t respond—it doesn’t necessarily reflect your chances of admission.
* You can also email them with specific questions; for example, if they have multiple affiliations, you can ask them which program they think would be a better fit to apply to if you’re interested in their lab. 
* If you have a direct connection to a PI of interest, use it. For example, if your current PI collaborates with someone at a school you're applying to, ask them to make the introduction (ideally by email, CCing you).
* Reaching out to big-name, senior PIs with huge, well-funded labs usually doesn’t lead anywhere. Focus instead on early- or mid-career faculty whose work genuinely excites you. They’re more likely to respond—and more likely to be on the admissions committee.

Essay writing 

* START EARLY. I guarantee every school is going to ask for slightly different essays and while you can recycle some material, it’s going to need to be highly tailored to each school. They will definitely be able to tell if it’s a copy-paste situation. 
* Spend a lot of time in the brainstorming stage of your essay. Don’t sit down and try to write something complete from start to finish; I guarantee it will be bad. Instead, take the time to reflect on your path and your motivations, and write down everything that comes to mind. Even if 1% of this brainstorm is usable, it will be worthwhile. Then, you can slowly shape it into an essay. 
* Proofread!! Submitting something with the wrong school name, a misspelled PI, or careless errors signals a lack of attention and professionalism.
* For rotational programs, the unspoken convention is to list three professors you are interested in working with, along with a brief few sentences about why you want to work with them and what you can contribute. You can deviate from this but it worked for me and many others. 
* Speaking with current students will both help you narrow down your schools list and give you good talking points in your essay. They want to see that you are aware of the unique strengths of the program, and that you will take advantage of their resources.
* Get as much feedback as possible on your essays. Send it to your professors, to current students, post-docs you’ve worked with, etc. 
* Nobody talks about this, but many people with the financial means to do so hire a professional application consultant to help shape every aspect of their application. While I believe this is not at all necessary, recognize that you’re competing against people with the resources to fully polish each element of their application with the help of an expert. In order to compete, your best bet is going to be to solicit as much mentorship and feedback as you possibly can from professors and peers. 

How to speak and interview well

* I find that undergraduate researchers are often not very good at articulating their work in the broader context of the field. While you do not need to be an expert, you need to be able to explain what you were doing beyond the basic assay. When someone asks about your research, or when you need to write about it, don’t start with the technique; start with the problem. Convince them that it’s important, explain where the gap is, explain how your work fills the gap, and finally tell them what you’re specifically doing. 
* This is where reading widely and attending talks comes in handy. For example, if great novelists did not read books themselves, they would not know how to write good books. Similarly, if you don’t immerse yourself in the language scientists use to talk about their research, you will be at a disadvantage when it comes to explaining your own work. 
* Get good at asking questions! If you’re still in school force yourself to ask questions during class and in seminars. When reading a paper think of questions to ask that cannot readily be answered by Google or by a second read of the text. The questions you ask during informational interviews with PIs or during real interviews might say more about you than your answers to questions. 
* Formulate answers to common interview questions thoughtfully. Be earnest, don’t exaggerate or try to paint yourself in an overly positive light, but do show your genuine passion. 
* Practice a lot!! Practice with peers and with professors and mentors. Informational PI interviews (set up by emailing them) are a great way to gain interview practice to prepare for real evaluative interviews. I have a long list of interview questions I can provide if it would be helpful! 
* At the interview weekend, act as if absolutely everybody is evaluating you, even other prospective students. We overhear conversations, and we see how you treat your peers. At the interview stage, we’re looking for any reason to decline somebody; don’t give us anything. Do show real curiosity, and engage with current students as much as possible. This will ultimately help you make a choice! 

Ultimately, as stressful as this application process is, it’s also a really beautiful time to reflect on your path thus far, and to clarify what you want to do in the future. When you approach the process with this mindset, it becomes a little less intimidating and more exciting!

If you're wondering about the best way to see the entire island in one day - this is it.

I researched dozens of tours before settling on this 8-hour Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall. It turned out to be the perfect choice for seeing all of Oahu's highlights without the hassle of renting a car or figuring out directions.

The tour started with a convenient pickup from my Waikiki hotel around 7 AM. Our guide (a local who really knew his stuff) took us on a carefully planned route that covered all the major spots you'd want to see on Oahu.

First stop was Diamond Head lookout - the views of the coastline were absolutely stunning. Then we headed to Halona Blowhole, where waves shoot water up through an ancient lava tube. Pretty impressive natural phenomenon.

The Nu'uanu Pali Lookout was next - the panoramic views here are unreal. You can see both sides of the island, and the winds are so strong they could literally blow your hat off (learned that the hard way).

One of my favorite stops was at Tropical Farms for Kona coffee and macadamia nut sampling. Got to try some unique flavors like garlic macadamia nuts - surprisingly good!

The North Shore portion was fantastic. We stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach, checked out local fruit stands, and had the best garlic shrimp lunch at one of the food trucks.

But the highlight was definitely Waimea Valley. The botanical gardens are beautiful, and the waterfall at the end is perfect for swimming. Bring your swimsuit - you won't want to miss this opportunity.

We finished at the Dole Plantation where I had their famous Dole Whip ice cream. Perfect way to end the day.

If you're interested in booking this tour (which I highly recommend), I found the best deal here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island

A few practical tips:
- Bring cash for lunch and tips
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Pack swimwear and a towel
- Bring a camera - the photo opportunities are endless
- Consider booking early in your trip - it's a great way to get oriented

The tour is well-paced, and you get plenty of time at each stop. Our guide shared fascinating cultural insights and historical facts throughout the journey, which really enhanced the experience.

For $154 per person, it's excellent value considering all the included admissions and the comprehensive coverage of the island. Plus, you don't have to worry about navigation or parking at busy tourist spots.

After doing this tour, I can confidently say it's the best way to see Oahu in a day. The combination of natural wonders, cultural sites, and local experiences makes it worth every penny.

Brand new Turin DF64
Normcore 18g high extraction basket
Normcore V5 Sprong loaded tamper
Normcore bottomless portafilter 
Normcore Blind Shaker 
Normcore 1.7mm puck screen

I’ve had my Breville for 7 years now. I didn’t get into really dialing in my shots till recently. I’ve even more recently switched to a nice grinder, the Turin DF64. During the recent Amazon Prime day bought a ton of the Normecore accessories. I also use extremely fresh roasted to order beans. I prefer dark roasted coffee so I use quite dark roasts (please leave your opinions elsewhere). But all the beans I use have been roasted recently from a local trustworthy source.


So I’m struggling with a few things. 
1. Slightly bitter 

2. Dosing much higher that the 18g the basket calls for 

3. Soupy pucks almost always regardless of the extraction. (I understand it’s about taste and that this ultimately doesn’t matter. Please keep those comments elsewhere. There are ways to fix this and I’d like to figure that out for my own OCD problems

I was starting with 18g in and pulling shots that yield 36g around 25 seconds. But the puck was really soupy and the shot was slightly bitter.  Seemed like the extraction was spot on but the soupy puck really bothers me. And the shot was bitter l, which i understand is over extraction. But it didn’t seem like my extraction was too long. 

So I started upping the dose. I’ve gotten as high as 20g in and I’m still getting soupy pucks that are slightly bitter. Seems like I can get the extraction times about where I need to be give or take. But can’t get rid of the soupy pucks and bitter shots. 

Please help.

For context I've been making pizza for 5 years and am quite good at it and enjoy making them. I was most of the way of creating a pizza truck for the college I was attending but it ended up falling through.
My idea is having a pizza truck/trailer placed on a busy commuter road, offer slices and whole pizzas, with basic toppings and have it be a drive through.
I can offer breakfast pizzas and coffee from local coffee brands, and have combos for those that want a slice, chip, and drink or something like that.
I believe it is a viable business, and can be done by myself or with the help of 1 other to save on payroll.
Ive done research on startup costs already from previous truck idea, and know costs to produce said pizzas, just not projected revenue.

1m6ywqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1m6ywqw/i_dont_know_whats_going_on_and_i_wonder_if_this/,I don’t know what’s going on and I wonder if this is normal with ADHD,"I’ll try to keep the explanation as brief as possible. I’m currently on 30mg Adderall XR. I’ve been on it on and off since I was diagnosed with ADHD at 6 years old (of course at a much lower dose as a child). I started taking it again this most recent time after I finished breastfeeding my daughter 7 months ago.
For the past 4 months I’ve been struggling with constant fatigue that seems to be getting worse. I sleep 6-7 hours a night and wake up feeling “drunk”. Slurring my words, stumbling, and my husband and daughter struggle to wake me up. If I take my adderall when I wake up, I feel normal after about 2 hours, and the normalcy lasts about 4 hours before I start to decline into extreme fatigue again. Even on the weekends when I get about 10 hours of sleep, I wake up feeling that same level of fatigue. I live an active lifestyle. I go outside for dedicated outdoor time (nature trails, beach, natural springs, playgrounds with my daughter, etc) 2-3 times a week. After my meds reach a good peak in after 2 hours I’m singing and dancing to the Super Simple songs for an hour as a form of daily exercise and a way to play with my daughter. I drink 2 liters of water a day. I eat 3 nutritious meals a day. But after about the 6 hour mark after taking my adderall, I start to crash rapidly.
I don’t get hyper on adderall. My 4 hour window of functionality is a super basic level of energy that the normal person would have, and I have to drink a cup of coffee on top of my adderall to get to that normal function.
I’ve been thinking about my struggles with fatigue and when they ACTUALLY started. I was starting to fall asleep in class and feel fatigued regularly starting in 5th grade. That was coincidentally when I started competitive swimming. So the thought from that point forward was just that I needed more calories and my body was just trying to recover my muscles. I stopped swimming when I graduated high school. The fatigue persisted. I continued to fall asleep in class throughout college. I remember having to stay for the first 10min for attendance, step outside to chain smoke 4 cigarettes, then come back in to finish the class. I no longer fall asleep uncontrollably at random times, but I have always felt tired.
First it was because I was an athlete, then I wasn’t sleeping enough, then I was sleeping too much, then it was because I was sedentary, oh but I need to drink more water, but maybe I have depression, but the depression meds (SSRIs, SNRIs, mood stabilizers, etc) didn’t work and made me even more fatigued, so it’s probably because I was pregnant, well now it’s because I’m breastfeeding… then back on adderall and WOW I felt normal for 3 months, then back to trying different depression meds. Nothing works. There’s no clear reason for my fatigue, because there has always been SOME reasonable explanation for it… but there has been so many VERY different reasons for it that it feels like it is not actually caused by the things it was brushed off on. I honestly feel so defeated at this point. It inhibits my ability to do essential tasks like cleaning. After my 4 hour normal feeling period, I’m glued to the couch and my body feels weak.  
I also want to add that my husband has told me I barely snore and I don’t move much in my sleep, so apnea and RLS are unlikely. ",2,1753241904.0,adhdwomen,2,0.75,False

I’m not really used to opening up like this, especially on a public forum, but lately… I’ve just felt like I’m slipping into a space that’s hard to climb out of.

I live in Northern Taiwan. I’m past mid 20's. And for a while now, I’ve been carrying this weight inside me a deep loneliness that words don’t always capture. There’s a sense of void I can’t seem to shake off. My mind’s all over the place, and I often find myself staring at nothing, feeling everything.

I’ve had my share of past trauma, and maybe I’ve healed parts of it, but some parts still bleed when no one’s watching. I’ve tried to distract myself, tried to stay strong, tried to wear a mask like everyone else… but I’m tired. Not physically just emotionally tired.

More than anything, I think I’m just craving something soft. Not in a weak way  just someone gentle. I miss feminine warmth the kind of presence that doesn’t ask you to explain yourself, that calms your storms without even trying. I miss being seen, really seen.Maybe I’m being a little selfish… but only because selflessness has hollowed out parts of me I never told anyone about. I’ve spent so long holding space for others, I forgot what it feels like to be held and now, some quiet part of me is just asking to be met without armor.

I know I’m Gen Z, and yeah… talking about stuff like this can be hard in our generation. Vulnerability isn’t always welcomed it’s often misunderstood, laughed at, or brushed off. Maybe someone will even make fun of this post. But honestly, that’s nothing new, and it doesn’t really scare me anymore.

I don’t expect anything. I’m not here for drama, or to burden someone. I just want to connect with someone who understands what it’s like to feel like a ghost in a world full of noise. Maybe over a coffee, a walk, or even a simple exchange of words.

Art is suffering. Suffering is what fuels creativity. 


Act I – The Medium Is Blood

I’m an artist. Not professionally at least. Although some would argue the moment you exchange paint for profit, you’ve already sold your soul.

I’m not a professional artist because that would imply structure, sanity, restraint. I’m more of a vessel. The brush doesn’t move unless something inside me breaks.

I’ve been selling my paintings for a while now. Most are landscapes, serene, practical, palatable. Comforting little things. The kind that looks nice above beige couches and beside decorative wine racks. 

I’ve made peace with that. The world likes peace. The world buys peace. 

My hands do the work. My soul stays out of it.

But the real art? The ones I paint at 3 A.M., under the sick yellow light of a streetlamp leaking through broken blinds? 

Those are different. 

Those live under a white sheet in the corner of my apartment, like forgotten corpses. They bleed out my truth.

I’ve never shown them to anyone. Some things aren’t meant to be framed. I keep it hidden, not because I’m ashamed. But because that kind of art is honest and honesty terrifies people.

Sometimes I use oil. Sometimes ink, when I can afford it. Charcoal is rare.

My apartment is quiet. Not the good kind of quiet. Not peace, the other kind. The kind that lingers like old smoke in your lungs. 

There’s a hum in the walls, the fridge, the water pipes, my thoughts.

I work a boring job during the day. Talk to no living soul as much as possible. Smile when necessary. Nod and acknowledge. Send the same formal, performative emails. 
Leave the office for the night. Come home to silence. Lock the door, triple lock it. Pull the blinds. And I paint. 

That’s the routine. That’s the rhythm.

There was a time when I painted to feel something. But now I paint to bleed the feelings out before they drown me.

But when the ache reaches the bone, when the screaming inside gets too loud,

I use blood. 

Mine.

A little prick of the finger here, a cut there. Small sacrifices to the muse.

It started with just a drop. 

It started small. 

One night, I cut my palm on a glass jar. A stupid accident really. Some of the blood smeared onto the canvas I was working on.

I watched the red spread across the grotesque monstrosity I’d painted. It didn’t dry like acrylic. It glistened. Dark, wet, and alive. 

I couldn’t look away. 
So, I added a little more. Just to see. 

I didn’t realize it then, but the brush had already sunk its teeth in me.

I started cutting deliberately. Not deep, not at first. A razor against my finger. A thumbtack to the thigh. 

The shallow pain was tolerable, manageable even. 
And the colour… Oh, the colour. 

No store-bought red could mimic that kind of reality.

It’s raw, unforgiving, human in the most visceral way. 
There’s no pretending when you paint with blood. 

I began reserving canvases for what I called the “blood work.” That’s what I named it in my head, the paintings that came from the ache, not the hand. 

I’d paint screaming mouths, blurred eyes, teeth that didn’t belong to any known animal. 

They came out of me like confessions, like exorcisms.

I started to feel… Lighter afterward. Hollow, yes. But clearer, like I had purged something. 

They never saw those paintings. No one ever has.

I wrap them in a sheet like corpses. I stack them like coffins. 

I tell myself it’s for my own good that the world isn’t ready. 

But really? 
I think I’m the one who’s not ready. 

Because when I look at them, I see something moving behind the brushstrokes. 
Something alive. 
Something waiting.

The bleeding became part of the process. 

Cut. Paint. Bandage. Repeat.

I started getting lightheaded and dizzy. My skin grew pale. 
I called it the price of truth.

My doctor said I was anemic. 
I told him I was simply “bad at feeding myself.” 

He believed me. 
They always do. 

No one looks too closely when you’re quiet and polite and smile at the right times.

I used to wonder if I was crazy, if I was making it all up. The voice in the paintings, the pulse I felt on the canvas. 

But crazy people don’t hide their madness.
They let it out. 
I bury mine in art and white sheets.

I told myself I’d stop eventually. That the next piece would be the last. 

But each one pulls something deeper. 
Each one takes a little more. 

And somehow… 
Each one feels more like me than anything I’ve ever made.

I use razors now. Small ones, precise, like scalpels. 

I know which veins bleed the slowest. 
Which ones burn. 
Which ones sing.
 
I don’t sleep much. 
When I do, I dream in black and red.


Act II - The Cure

It happened on a Thursday.
Cloudy, bleak, and cold. 
The kind of sky that promises rain but never delivers.

I was leaving a bookstore, a rare detour, when he stopped me.

“You dropped this,” he said, holding out my sketchbook.

It was bound in leather, old and fraying at the corners. I hadn’t even noticed it slipped out of my bag.

I took it from him, muttered a soft “thank you,” and turned to leave.

“Wait,” he said. “I’ve seen your work before… Online, right? The landscapes? Your name is Vaela Amaranthe Mor, correct?”

I stopped and turned. He smiled like spring sunlight cutting through fog; honest and warm, not searching for anything. Or maybe that’s just what I needed him to be.

I nodded. “Yeah. That’s me. Vaela…”

“They’re beautiful,” he said. “But they feel… Safe. You ever paint anything else?”

My breath caught. That single question rattled something deep in my chest, the hidden tooth, the voice behind the canvases. 

But I smiled. Told him, “Sometimes. Just for myself.”

He laughed. 
“Aren’t those the best ones?”

I asked his name once. 
I barely remember it now because of how much time has passed.

I think it was… Ezren Lucair Vireaux. 

Even his name felt surreal. As if it was too good to be true.
In one way or another, it was. 

We started seeing each other after that.
Coffee, walks, quiet dinners in rustic places with soft music. 

He asked questions, but never pushed. 
He listened, not the polite kind. 
The real kind. 
The kind that makes silence feel like safety.

I told him about my work.
He told me about his. 

He taught piano and said music made more sense than people.

I told him painting was the opposite, you pour your madness into a canvas so people won’t see it in your eyes. 

He said that was beautiful. 
I told him it was just survival.

I stopped painting for a while. 
It felt strange at first. Like forgetting to breathe. 
Like sleeping without dreaming. 

But the need… Faded. 
The canvas in the corner stayed blank. 
The razors stayed in the drawer. 
The voices quieted.

We spent a rainy weekend in his apartment. It smelled like coffee and sandalwood. 

We lay on the couch, legs tangled, and he played music on a piano while I read with my head on his chest.

I remember thinking…
This must be what peace feels like.

I didn’t miss the art. 
Not at first. 
But peace doesn’t make good paintings.

Happiness doesn’t bleed.

And silence, no matter how soft, starts to feel like drowning when you’re used to screaming.

For the first time in years, I felt full.

But then the colors started fading. 
The world turned pale. 
Conversations blurred. 
My fingers twitched for a brush. 
My skin itched for a cut.

He felt too soft. Too kind. 
Like a storybook ending someone else deserved. 

I tried to believe in him the way I believed in the blood.

The craving came back slowly. 
A whisper in the dark. 
An itch under the skin. 

That cold, familiar pull behind the eyes.

One night, while he slept, I crept into the bathroom. 

Took out the blade. 

Just a small cut. Just to remember. 

The blood felt warm. 
The air tasted like paint thinner and rust.

I didn’t paint that night. 
I just watched the drop roll down my wrist and smiled.

The next morning, he asked if I was okay. 
Said I looked pale.
Said I’d been quiet. 

I told him I was tired. 
I lied.

A week later, I bled for real.

I took out a canvas. 

Painted something with teeth and no eyes. 
A mouth where the sky should be. 
Fingers stretched across a black horizon.

It felt real, alive, like coming home.

He found it.

I came home from work and he was standing in my apartment, holding the canvas like it had burned him.

He asked what it was.

I told him the truth.
“I paint with my blood,” I said. 
“Not always. Just when I need to feel.”

He didn’t say anything for a long time.
His hands shook.
His eyes looked at me like I was something fragile. 
Something broken.

He asked me to stop. 
Said I didn’t have to do this anymore. 
That I wasn’t alone.

I kissed him.
Told him I’d try. 

And I meant it.
I really did. 

But the painting in the corner still whispered sweet nothings and the blood in my veins still felt… Restless.

I stopped bringing him over.
I stopped answering his texts. 
I even stopped picking up when he called.

All because I was painting again, and I didn’t want him to see what I was becoming. 

Or worse, what I’d always been.

Now it’s pints of blood.

“Insane,” they’d call me. 
“Deranged.”

People told me I was bleeding out for attention. 

They were half-right.

But isn’t it convenient? 

The world loves to romanticize suffering until it sees what real agony looks like.

I see the blood again. 
I feel it moving like snakes beneath my skin. 

It itches. 
It burns. 
It wants to be seen.

I think…
I need help making blood art.


Act III – The Final Piece

They say every artist has one masterpiece in them. 
One piece that consumes everything; time, sleep, memory, sanity, until it’s done. 

I started mine three weeks ago. 

I haven’t left the apartment since.

No phone, no visitors, no lights unless the sun gives them. 

Just me, the canvas, and the slow rhythm of the blade against my skin.

It started as something small.
Just a figure. 
Then a landscape behind it. 
Then hands. 
Then mouths. 
Then shadows grew out of shadows.

The more I bled, 
the more it revealed itself.

It told me where to cut. 
How much to give. 
Where to smear and blend and layer until the image didn’t even feel like mine anymore.

Sometimes I blacked out. 
I’d wake up on the floor, sticky with blood, brush still clutched in my hand like a weapon.

Other times I’d hallucinate.
See faces in the corners of the room. 
Reflections that didn’t mimic me.

But the painting? 

It was becoming divine. 
Horrible, radiant, holy in the way only honest things can be.

I saw him again, just once.

He knocked on my door. I didn’t answer.

He called my name through the wood.
Said he was worried. 
That he missed me. 
That he still loved me.

I pressed my palm against the door. 
Blood smeared on the wood, my signature. 

But I didn’t open it.

Because I knew the moment he saw me… Really saw me… 
He’d leave again.

Worse, he’d try to save me.
And I didn’t want to be saved. 

Not anymore.

I poured the last of myself into the final layer. 

Painted through tremors, through nausea, through vision tunneling into black. 
My body was wrecked. 
Veins collapsed.
Fingers swollen.
Eyes ringed in purple like I’d been punched by God.

But I didn’t stop.

Because I was close. 
So close I could hear the canvas breathing with me. 

Inhale. 
Exhale.
Cut. 
Paint.

When I stepped back, I saw it. 
Really saw it.

The masterpiece. 
My blood. 
My madness. 
My soul, scraped raw and screaming.

It was beautiful. 

No. Not beautiful, true.

I collapsed before I could name it.

Now, I’m on the floor.
I think it’s been hours. Maybe longer. 
There’s blood in my mouth. 

My limbs are cold. 
My chest is tight.

The painting towers over me like a God or a tombstone.

My vision’s going. 

But I can still see the reds.
Those impossible, perfect reds. 
All dancing under the canvas lights.

I hear sirens. 
Far away. 
Distant, like the world’s moving on without me. 

Good.
It should.

I gave everything to the art. 
Willingly and joyfully. 

People will find this place. 

They’ll see the paintings. 
They’ll feel something deep in their bones,
and they won’t know why. 

They’ll say it’s brilliant, disturbing, haunting even. 
They’ll call it genius. 

But they’ll never know what it cost.

Now, I'm leaving with one final breath, one last, blood-wet whisper. 

“I didn’t die for the art. 
I died because art wouldn’t let me live.”

If anyone finds the painting…

Please don’t touch it. 

I think it’s still hungry.

Pressure sensation is gone -- just headaches now, likely from jaw clenching (new, maybe stress) and hormones (off birth control for a week).

But vision issues are back today, just milder. For example: reading on my phone (dark mode, book distance), if I close my right eye and look at any word on the right of a block of text, the middle of the paragraph disappears.

It's not as bad... no pressure pain, no black sparkles, and my brain compensates somewhat when both eyes are open.

Saw neuro today. Plan: blood work, sooner ophthalmology appt, later on increase Diamox (or try Lasix).

Symptoms and side effects
- my glasses rx feels wrong, causing eyes to strain. Text is slightly blurry. Been an issue since the 16th after 3 days without glasses (because hospital)
    - EDIT: booked an eye exam Wednesday afternoon, and I already have spare frames. I've put off eye exams for so long, I think going glasses free at the hospital reset my expectations.
- eye muscles aching when moving eyes, due to above
- visual field blind spots (explained above) ""coming back""
- surface level or muscle headaches, not pressure (temples, jaw clenching)
- tired during the day, taking long sleep sessions when I do sleep (unless I use an alarm)
- diamox static fingers or toes, but I'm combating this with coconut water

For timeline: I started diamox at 500 twice a day on the 17th. The 21st was my first day back at work since all this. Notably, I recognize I've been hydrating less these two days because I'm working, and am having to sit at a desk vs a comfy couch or bed.

Venting below, feel free to skip:

Full disclosure, I'm a little high from 2.5mg thc. But ugh. Today was hard at work - second day back since all this stuff. This showed me how much my ADHD is being impacted. I felt I finally was getting thru it at this new job, as I'm not medicated but drink coffee, but my working memory is near zero. I'm losing train of thought etc. this is making me consider adhd medication, when it wasn't something I wanted or felt I needed until now.

I think diamox can cause this? Mental fatigue. But oh my gosh the physical fatigue. I'm sleeping sooo much. The other day, I slept for 10h at night then ""rested my eyes"" on the couch but it was over two hours of an actual nap. Yesterday after my first day back at work (I WFH but it's still a lot of thinking and meetings). I lost my train of thought SO many times. I barely got anything done. I couldn't focus. And after, I took a nap.... for 3.5 hours. Today was the same, but fewer meetings, and I set an alarm for the nap.

The neuro checked in with me on these side effects or symptoms, and was open to helping me find someone for ADHD, but I can't handle all this stuff right now if I add that. They asked if I've had nausea or confusion from diamox, and I said no. But she was unsure if these side effects will get worse (or even iih) on my period. She explained I'm having hormonal headaches from stopping BC. I'm worried how either this or my adhd will get impacted by my periods. (I've been on birth control a long time, so no period in a decade except light spotting once or twice.)

Okay, my mood swinging from ""take it day by day and take it slow"" to ""it's only been X days, am I going backwards though??? Why isn't there a fix??"" Is CERTAINLY hormones at play. I just remembered someone here sent a link to a list of reminders/advice, and one of the first are that this is a journey of TIME. My adhd ass hatessss that lol

I think I'll take the other half of this gummy and try to sleep early. It's been a long day and week (for only being Tuesday). Thanks for reading up to this point.

Edit: NOOOOO I tried a can of lemon seltzer (no sugar or salt) and it tasted FLAT and METALLIC. I saw these were side effects of diamox but omg. I used to drink seltzer daily for like twenty years but stopped about a year ago. That has prepared me for today.

My in-laws have been staying with me since mid May. They live in India and are visiting us in the United States . During this visit my father became deathly ill and had been in the ICU since early June. He passed away on 7/17. Throughout all of this I have felt pretty disrespected by them. 

1. They gave me absolutely no personal space when I was home which was maybe 2 hours a day. I was at the hospital 12+ hours a day most days and only came home to sleep. It seemed like a federal issue to them that I would want to have a coffee alone on my deck before heading to the hospital each day. 

2. When my dad passed my father in law commented that it was nice that I was home again to eat lunch with them. 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬

3. They didn’t want to attend the funeral because they were “too sad” and only attended because we told them it was expected and disrespectful if they didn’t 

4. We sat shiva at my house following the funeral. (I am Jewish). I went to the store to buy cans of soda and waters for anyone who happened to come. His dad watched me make 10 trips to the car and didn’t offer to help me even tho he was on Facebook scrolling.  This man literally has not even served himself a plate of food in the entire time he’s been staying with us so this wasn’t terribly surprising but it still really pissed me off. 

5. They didn’t attend the shiva and hid in their bedroom. Everyone asked where they were and I found this embarrassing and disrespectful of them. 

6. Yesterday I saw his mom posted a photo of them posing and smiling wearing the clothing they wore to the funeral. She borrowed a dress from me so I know this was taken the day of the funeral. I just found it very hurtful that they would take pictures like this let alone post them online where I can see them.

A few weeks ago, I matched with this guy, let’s call him Jake (26M), on a dating app. He seemed charming cute smile, witty texts, and we vibed over our love for classic horror. After a couple of weeks of texting and a coffee date that went really well, things escalated, and we ended up hooking up at his place after agreeing to just watch a movie.
Everything was fine until the next morning when Jake started acting mad weird. He was freaking out, asking me about birth control and if we were “safe.” I told him we literally used protection, but he was still freaking out about the possibility of pregnancy. I was really ready to gtfo. Then before I’m about ready to leave the situation and go home for the day, he’s like, “Can I CashApp you $65 for a Plan B pill? Just to be sure.” I was a little thrown off because, well, we were careful, and I thought he was overreacting, but I didn’t argue. I gave him my CashApp, and sure enough, cha Ching $65 shows up.
Here’s the real reason why I’m in this sub…
Jake didn’t know I’m infertile. I found out when I was 14 due to some medical issues, there’s literally no chance I can get pregnant via previous hysterectomy, I didn’t feel like spilling my whole medical history to a guy I barely knew, so I just let him send the money. But instead of buying a Plan B (which I obviously didn’t need), I treated myself to a bomb ass sushi dinner and a cute new phone case(one of the squishy back ones with glitter lol) bc why not, right?
Fast forward a few days, Jake starts blowing up my phone, asking if I took the pill and if I’m “okay.” I didn’t want to lie, so I just kept it vague and said, “All good, don’t worry.” Then he got all clingy and paranoid, texting me stuff like, “You sure? I just don’t want any surprises.” Bro, the only surprise here is how you played yourself. Eventually, I got tired of him begging and texting me “wyd” so I blocked him. I found out later from a mutual friend that he’s been pulling this “charming guy” act with other girls, hooking up, then ghosting really hoping he doesn’t do the whole plan B thing with everybody *cough* psychopath
But regardless I feel a little bad for not telling him I’m infertile, but honestly, after finding out he’s a player, I don’t feel that bad. That $65 sushi dinner was delicious, and my new phone case is adorable. 

So uh…Reddit, AITA for keeping the money and spending it on myself? Should I have told him the truth? Or did he kinda deserve it for being a shady dude?

TL;DR: Guy I hooked up with sent me $65 for Plan B because he was paranoid about pregnancy. I’m infertile, so I spent the money on sushi and a phone case instead. Found out he’s a player, and now I’m wondering if I’m the jerk for not telling him.",0,1753240986.0,AmItheAsshole,25,0.45,False

My heart still remembers the way you used to be
Before the cracks appeared, before the silence set us free

I just came to say goodbye, a whisper in the wind
To the dreams we built and watched them fall, until the bitter end
No more chasing shadows, no more wishing you were mine
Just a tear-stained lullaby, as we let go of what was kind

The rain outside mirrors the drops that fall inside my heart
Each memory a stinging reminder of how we fell apart
I see your face in every crowd, a bittersweet, fleeting view
And my laughter, it feels empty, trying hard to forget you

My heart still remembers the way you used to be
Before the cracks appeared, before the silence set us free

I just came to say goodbye, a whisper in the wind
To the dreams we built and watched them fall, until the bitter end

Just a tear-stained lullaby, as we let go of what was kind

Maybe in another life, our paths would truly intertwine
But the chapters closed, the story done, etched in a fragile line
I'll walk away with my broken pieces, scattered on the floor
And finally lock the door to a love that's here no more

I just came to say goodbye, a whisper in the wind
To the dreams we built and watched them fall, until the bitter end
No more chasing shadows, no more wishing you were mine

1m6yjut,https://www.reddit.com/r/WannaGoPlaces/comments/1m6yjut/what_is_the_most_beautiful_street_in/,What is the most beautiful street in Carmel-by-the-Sea?,"I just got back from an incredible day trip exploring Carmel-by-the-Sea, and I have to share my experience on Ocean Avenue, which is hands down the most enchanting street in this charming coastal town. The street runs from Highway 1 right down to Carmel Beach, offering a perfect blend of shopping, dining, and pure California coastal beauty.

Walking down Ocean Avenue feels like stepping into a fairytale. The street is lined with unique Cypress trees and dotted with Tudor-style architecture that gives it this distinct European village vibe. What really caught my attention were the hidden courtyards and secret passages between buildings – there's literally something interesting around every corner.

I was lucky enough to visit as part of a guided tour from San Francisco (more on that later), and our guide shared some fascinating history about the street. Apparently, Ocean Avenue has been the heart of Carmel since the early 1900s, when artists and writers first started settling in the area. You can still feel that creative spirit today in the numerous art galleries and boutiques that line the street.

Some highlights you absolutely can't miss:
- The iconic Pine Inn at the corner of Ocean and Monte Verde
- Carmel Plaza's upscale shopping
- The charming coffee shops with outdoor seating
- Local art galleries featuring California artists
- The breathtaking ocean view at the bottom of the street

Pro tip: The best time to visit is early morning or late afternoon when the lighting is perfect for photos and the crowds are thinner. I visited as part of a full-day tour from San Francisco (you can book it here: https://athometouch.com/Monterey), which was perfect because it included stops at other must-see spots like the 17-Mile Drive and Monterey.

What makes Ocean Avenue truly special is how it captures everything that makes Carmel unique – the architecture, the artistic heritage, the natural beauty, and the small-town charm. It's not just a street; it's an experience that represents the heart and soul of Carmel-by-the-Sea.

If you're planning to visit, I highly recommend taking a guided tour. Our guide shared so many interesting details about the architecture and history that I would have missed on my own. Plus, having transportation taken care of meant I could fully focus on enjoying the experience rather than worrying about parking (which can be tricky in Carmel).

The street is particularly magical during sunset when the ocean view at the bottom of Ocean Avenue creates this incredible golden glow. Make sure to walk all the way down to Carmel Beach – the view of the sunset over the Pacific is absolutely worth it.

For anyone interested in experiencing Ocean Avenue and the rest of Carmel's charm, I used this tour service: https://athometouch.com/Monterey. It's a great way to see everything in one day without the hassle of driving or parking, and you get tons of interesting background information from the guides.",1,1753240811.0,WannaGoPlaces,0,1.0,False

They put in these wooden countertops, and I have no clue how to clean them. I'm not even sure if they are fully sealed? I don't know much about wood, but if I drag my finger over it it feels like I could get a splinter. At my old apartment I used the purple fabuloso to clean them, but they were also like a cheap laminate countertop. The photo I included is after wiping my new counter with fabuloso. 

I put a wet bowl on the counter for like a minute before putting it in the dishwasher, and it left this ring of water on the counter top which can't be wiped away and is definitely soaked into the wood, I'm sure it will dry, but I'm worried about what other liquids would be soaked up (like raw chicken juice) if they touch the counter. I'm not gonna like cut raw chicken directly on my counter, but I'm sure I'll accidentally drop a piece off my cutting board at some point.

The coffee pot's making that gurgling sound again, folks. Always happens around this time of night – like it's trying to tell me something through the percolation. I've learned to pay attention to these small disturbances during the late hours. Sometimes they're mechanical issues, sometimes they're atmospheric pressure changes, and sometimes... well, sometimes they're something else entirely.

It's now approaching one-thirty in the morning, and the calls haven't stopped coming in. I've got a stack of emails here that's growing taller by the minute, all from people who work in the quiet corners of our cultural institutions. Seems like Grace and Victor's stories have opened a floodgate of experiences that people have been keeping to themselves for years.

But there's one message that arrived just moments ago that I knew I had to share with you tonight. It came through our secure submission portal – the one we use for particularly sensitive stories – and it's from someone who works in perhaps the most secure library environment in the country.

The sender identifies herself only as S.K., and she works at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. For those who've never been there, we're talking about the largest library in the world, housing over 170 million items across three massive buildings. But more importantly for tonight's discussion, it's home to some of the most restricted and carefully preserved documents in human history.

S.K. works in what she calls ""the deep storage facility"" – areas of the Jefferson Building that most visitors never see, where the most valuable and fragile materials are kept under museum-quality conditions. Security clearances, biometric scanners, climate-controlled vaults that can only be opened by two people working in tandem. This is where they keep the documents that are literally irreplaceable.

But sometimes, even in the most secure environments, the past finds a way to make its presence known.

Here's what S.K. sent me:

""Mr. Cronkite,

I heard your show tonight while working a late shift in the Asian Collections preservation vault. Victor's story about the breathing in the ventilation system struck a nerve – we've been having similar issues down here, though what I experienced goes far beyond mysterious sounds.

My name is Sophie, and I'm 27 years old. I've been working as an archival preservation specialist at the Library of Congress for four years now. I have security clearance to access Level 7 restricted materials – documents so rare and valuable that they're kept in individual climate-controlled compartments, some of which haven't been opened in decades.

Three months ago, I was assigned to conduct a condition assessment on a collection of documents from the Nguyen Dynasty of Vietnam, dating from 1802 to 1945. These materials came to the Library through a complex diplomatic arrangement in 1978, and they've been in deep storage ever since. Imperial edicts, personal correspondence from Emperor Minh Mang, court records written on traditional paper with lacquered seals still intact.

The collection is housed in Vault C-47, six floors below ground level in the Jefferson Building. To access it, I need to pass through four separate security checkpoints, including a biometric scanner that reads both fingerprints and retinal patterns. The vault itself is a room about the size of a large closet, with humidity maintained at exactly 35% and temperature held constant at 65 degrees Fahrenheit.

The lighting in these vaults is motion-activated LED, designed to minimize exposure to harmful spectrums while providing adequate illumination for detailed work. There's no outside communication once you're sealed inside – electromagnetic shielding prevents cell phone signals, and there's no internet connection. Just you, the documents, and the soft hum of the environmental controls.

I went down to Vault C-47 on a Tuesday evening in late September. The building was nearly empty – just security staff and a few researchers with special after-hours access working in the main reading rooms. I prefer doing my preservation assessments during off-hours because there are fewer vibrations from foot traffic, and the building's environmental systems run more steadily.

The vault door is a massive thing, maybe three inches thick, with a handle that requires both my keycard and a physical key turned simultaneously. As I approached that evening, I noticed something odd. The handle was wet.

Not just damp from condensation – actually wet, as if someone with dripping hands had just grabbed it. In an environment maintained at 35% humidity, this was unusual enough to make me pause.

I examined the handle more closely with my flashlight and saw something that made my stomach drop. Clear fingerprints, still wet, covering the entire surface of the handle. Full handprints, as if someone had grabbed it with both hands and held on.

The thing is, according to the access logs, I was the first person to enter that vault in six weeks. The previous visitor had been Dr. Martinez from the Asian Studies department, and that had been for a routine security inspection, not document handling.

I dried off the handle and opened the vault, checking the humidity and temperature readings before entering. Everything was normal – environment stable, no signs of moisture intrusion, air filtration system functioning perfectly.

The Nguyen Dynasty documents are stored in fifteen custom-made archival boxes, each one equipped with its own humidity monitoring system. I began my assessment with Box 1, which contains imperial correspondence from 1820-1835.

I was about fifteen minutes into my work when I heard it. A sound like water dripping, very slow and rhythmic. Drip... drip... drip... I looked around the small vault, but there was no visible water source. The sound seemed to be coming from above, from the direction of the air circulation system.

I continued working, but the dripping sound persisted. And after about twenty minutes, I noticed something else. The documents I was examining – 200-year-old papers that should have been completely dry – felt slightly damp to the touch.

This was alarming enough that I immediately checked the humidity monitors. All readings were normal, exactly where they should be. But the papers continued to feel damp, and the dripping sound was getting more frequent.

That's when I noticed the footprints.

On the pristine white floor of the vault, there were wet footprints leading from the door to the document storage area. Bare feet, small, like those of a young woman or teenager. The prints were fresh – I could see individual toe marks clearly defined in the moisture.

I followed the trail with my eyes and realized they led directly to Box 7, which contained personal items and correspondence from the imperial court's female quarters. Documents written by the wives and daughters of the emperors, poetry, personal letters, records of daily life in the Forbidden Purple City of Hue.

I opened Box 7 with trembling hands. The documents inside were not just damp – they were soaking wet, as if they'd been submerged in water. But when I lifted them out, they were completely dry to the touch. It was like looking at wet paper while feeling dry paper, a sensory disconnect that made me question my own perception.

As I examined the documents more closely, I noticed something written in the margin of one of the letters. Modern pencil writing, in English, in handwriting I didn't recognize:

'I am still here. They promised to remember me.'

I checked that document against our digital catalog. According to our records, that margin had been blank when the item was last photographed for digitization three years ago.

The dripping sound was becoming more insistent now, and I could see water beginning to pool on the floor around my feet, though I couldn't determine where it was coming from. The environmental controls showed no irregularities, but my work area was getting noticeably wetter.

I decided to expedite my assessment and move to the final boxes, but as I reached for Box 15, I heard something that stopped me cold.

Crying.

Soft, heartbroken sobbing, coming from somewhere inside the vault. A young woman's voice, crying with the kind of grief that comes from profound loss. The sound echoed off the walls despite the acoustic dampening built into the vault's construction.

I stood perfectly still, listening, trying to locate the source of the sound. It seemed to be coming from the documents themselves, as if the papers were weeping.

Then I heard words. Spoken in Vietnamese, which I don't understand, but the emotional content was unmistakable. Pleading, desperate, the voice of someone trying to make themselves understood across a vast distance.

I grabbed my phone to try to record the voice, forgetting that there was no signal in the vault. But as I raised the phone, the crying stopped abruptly. The silence that followed was somehow worse than the weeping had been.

That's when I saw her.

Reflected in the black screen of my phone, standing directly behind me, was a young Vietnamese woman in traditional imperial court dress. She couldn't have been more than sixteen or seventeen, with long black hair and eyes that held a depth of sadness I'd never seen before.

I spun around, but there was no one there. The vault was empty except for me and the documents. But when I looked back at my phone screen, she was still there in the reflection, and now she was pointing at Box 15.

I opened the box she was indicating and found a collection of personal letters written by Princess Ngoc Lan, the youngest daughter of Emperor Minh Mang. She had died in 1838 at the age of seventeen, according to the documentation, but the cause of death was listed simply as 'grief illness' – a term that could mean anything from tuberculosis to heartbreak.

The letters were written to her brother, Prince Canh, who had been sent away from court for political reasons. In them, she begged him to return, described her loneliness, expressed her fear that she would be forgotten after her death. The final letter, dated just days before she died, contained a line that made my hands shake:

'I will wait here among my words until someone remembers to look for me.'

As I read this, the water on the floor began to recede, the dripping sound faded, and the oppressive humidity in the vault returned to normal. But written in the condensation on the inside of the vault door, in the same modern handwriting I'd seen in the margins, were new words:

'Thank you for reading my letters. Please don't let them forget me again.'

I finished my assessment quickly and sealed the vault. When I checked the access logs the next morning, they showed that the vault had been opened twice that evening – once when I entered, and once again at 3:17 AM, twenty minutes after I'd left the building.

The security cameras for that level were mysteriously corrupted for a twelve-hour period that night.

But here's what really haunts me, Mr. Cronkite. I've been back to that vault six times since then for various projects. Each time, I find new writing in the margins of Princess Ngoc Lan's letters. Not historical additions – modern notes, in English, describing her life in the court, her relationships with her family, details about daily life in imperial Vietnam that aren't recorded anywhere else in our collections.

It's as if she's continuing to tell her story, adding to the historical record because she knows that someone is finally paying attention.

The latest addition, which I found just last week, simply said: 'My story matters. All of our stories matter. Please help them understand.'

I've started advocating for a full digitization project of the Nguyen Dynasty collection, with special emphasis on the documents from the women's quarters. My supervisors are puzzled by my sudden passionate interest in 19th-century Vietnamese court records, but they've approved preliminary funding for the project.

I think Princess Ngoc Lan is still trying to ensure that the women of her time aren't forgotten by history. That their voices are preserved and heard, even if it takes nearly two centuries for someone to listen.

But I'm also starting to worry about the other collections in our deep storage vaults. How many other voices are down there, waiting in the darkness for someone to remember they exist? How many stories are being told to empty rooms, hoping that eventually, someone will come to listen?

Last night, I heard crying coming from three different vaults on Level 7. And this morning, I found wet handprints on the handles of doors that haven't been opened in months.

I think they're all trying to tell us something, Mr. Cronkite. All these preserved voices from the past. And I'm starting to think that our job as archivists isn't just to preserve their documents – it's to make sure their stories continue to be told.

Sincerely, Sophie""

Sophie, I want you to know that your work matters more than you might realize. What you're experiencing in those vaults isn't just a supernatural phenomenon – it's a reminder of the responsibility we bear to the voices from the past. Every document in those collections represents a life lived, a story told, a person who hoped their words would outlast their physical existence.

I did some research on Princess Ngoc Lan after receiving your message, and what I found was troubling. Despite being the daughter of one of Vietnam's most significant emperors, there are virtually no English-language historical records about her life. Her existence is mentioned in passing in a few academic papers, but her voice, her perspective, her experiences – they've been largely lost to time.

Until now.

If she's indeed continuing to add to the historical record through those margin notes, then you may be witnessing something unprecedented – a collaboration between the living and the dead to ensure that forgotten stories are finally told.

But Sophie, I have to ask you to be careful down there in those vaults. The wet handprints, the crying from multiple locations – it sounds like you may have awakened something larger than just one lonely princess. You might want to document everything you're experiencing and consider sharing it with your supervisors, regardless of how it might sound.

Because sometimes the best way to help the dead find peace is to ensure their stories reach the living.

The wind's picking up again outside the station, and I can hear it whistling through the transmitter cables. There's something almost musical about it tonight, like voices carried on the air from very far away. Makes me wonder what stories the wind might be trying to tell, what messages it might be carrying from places where the past still lives and breathes.

We've got more tales from the stacks coming your way, including a rather disturbing account from a book cart that seems to travel through library halls of its own accord, and a story about the color of ink that refuses to dry.

Keep those coffee cups full and your radios close, folks. We're only just scratching the surface of the mysteries that dwell in our temples of knowledge.

1m6yana,https://i.redd.it/b643qe3rijef1.jpeg,Who’s got the lowest grades at Stuyvesant High School?,"My thoughts on my transcript and the school are these. My thoughts on funding is that Stuyvesant should have ALL of Brooklyn Tech’s endowment money, the whole shebang. Stuy is so obviously Hogwarts School of Magic or Umbrella Academy, and it should be a more formal school with the houses and magic hat to boot. Nobody after Stuy ‘04 knows what the school was like before 9/11, but my freshman year was House Gryphindor, Phil, Eric and myself all day long for biology, sequential I, badminton, tumbling, picknicking in the park, history and skipping across the bridge and down the steps to the west side highway home. Stuy is the haunted mansion on the hill: Miyazaki, Alfred Hitchcock, any Japanese slice of life such as Ano Hana We Saw That Day (the Japanese don’t want me speaking their language sorry, but they pay for my trips), Attack on Titan, the cute one about the concert pianist, Demon Slayer, not Bleach or Naruto unless you’re ‘04, any Western, and DC had this covered. You are the protagonist in a magic story, Glinda the Good Witch granted your wish, but post-9/11 was more like going to school at LaGuardia airport. Hufflepuffs, our extraverted rejected cutie pies go to Harvard College, and I didn’t meet any until the end of senior year. You’re then stunned. 

The school would make way more sense if people stuck to their freshman year park friends until the end. If you’re not in the park with someone for lunch at least once, they are NOT YOUR FRIENDS. And you are not going to similar colleges. Teitel, our principal, and girlfriend, Muggles. The Jewish students are Muggles. Indians: Slytherin. Chinese: mostly Hufflepuff, to be honest. They will blow you away with interesting Cornell acceptances. You don’t find out about these people until senior year. As far as Cornell, I’ve met a black lady who went there. The Chinese don’t really lie, they kinda stick together. If you ask, they’re sorta nice. The Koreans are more cutthroat, Ms. Yoon included, but she was blonde, respectful and funny. Favors boys. She was kinda like Galadriel. J. stern is the male equivalent, a complete mystery. Head of the Math Department: Gandalph or Professor McGonnagal, the top wizard granting you the keys to life. The kind and respectful people at Stuyvesant get overwhelmed a lot. Donald Trump: Hufflepuff. Brooklyn, New York might as well be post-Kefka FFVI, and Uber is a chocobo farm. I was #38 or so on the SHSAT. 
1. 88s or lower: An opinion from the teacher that they don’t want you in the AP track. Teacher resentments. Don’t get rattled—Take the AP anyway, your friends will get very angry. One of my dumb mistakes was not taking AP History. You do not want an assault from the debate teamer taking AP History, because they will beat you to a pulp and draw strange conclusions about your math classes. It’s not impressive to them that you have two to three math classes. 
2. 90: just getting to know your personality and/or bored. Blowing you off. In another student’s hands, this would be a 97. 
3. 97: You’re good enough for a relevant AP. Reluctant to give you 100, that’s all. A boy would’ve gotten 100. 
4. 100: you had the French lady for French. 
5. 99: never seen one.
6. 92,96: fair and normal grade.
7. The day I bought a graphing calculator was best day of my lifetime.
8. If you want top 20, put down all. Do not put down Harvard College. In all my years including sat loves I’ve never had a good interaction with this school its students or their parents. The sadistic teachers at Stuyvesant believe they’re Harvard University. 
9. You’re free to take zero APs or extracurriculars. That’s what I wanted actually until a Hufflepuff clinger got to me. See that part about only making friends with people who are in the park with you and/or freezing with you early in the morning? The rest of them don’t know your schedule. I’m just a kid is a fine excuse. 
10. Euclidean geometry I don’t remember at all!! Aside from it being a trigonometry rehash… I probably fell asleep. If it’s the class I’m thinking of, this is the one where where you prove all of your favorite theorems in order. But I can skim Math papers and so can my pet. She likes stationery and writing greeting cards. Don’t get pets. 
11. BC Calc was nicer. I would’ve moved that down to junior year, if at all. 
12. Including Classical Lit, where Ms. Yoon lowers self esteem, I didn’t like my English classes. I read much more, even in my free time, in Catholic school. As a freshman, I entered the school with a perfect SAT Verbal waiting for my tiny hands and a sucky math score. As far as I know, nobody needs AP English, and they should stop bragging about it. God, the AP English people are pompous. 
13. Just take the AP Economics classes, AP Psychology, and people won’t be as concerned. 
14. Philosophy: sadistic abuser… nervous Hufflepuff breakdown. Fingers bleeding, 3 hours of homework. On the vague plus side, I remember what I read mostly. People will deeply hate you in your 20s. What they will hear coming out of your mouth is Hermione Granger. Abusive people abuse Freud. It’s too much knowledge to take home. Read the texts, don’t do the homework, take home a 0. 
15. Mr. Mott: sadistic abuser. Depressive episode waiting for you. Snap, hand in strong 75s or below to the black people, write trash, and the Chinese, too, and call it. Do not take feedback from English teachers.
16. The school needs two top 15% psychiatrists, like an MD, for therapy. By junior year, I was having night terrors and up until 5am playing video games. Then, my parents divorced. The borderline personality disordered kids at the school need advice. Ms. Kornhauser or whoever she is suckage if schedules are getting posted publicly. 
17. As far as race, I don’t care. If you’re mixed race, light-skinned, bouncy, or otherwise, pick a side and make friends with either the Chinese or the Koreans and call it day. Avoid Indians.
18. My last regret is not failing more classes or withdrawing. If what you’re hearing from a teacher is blah-blah-blah-pit-pat-womp-womp, it’s genuinely blah-blah-blah-pit-pat-womp-womp:
19. AP Computer Sci, I can’t comment on because I didn’t know them. 
20. Coffee: fine. Chinese tea: good. Dark chocolate: better. Spirulina: bonuses. Try reading glasses for yourself.
21. Latinos and the acting people cheat. Wherever the heck your battle axe bestie wants to go, apply there. In my case, it was MIT and Columbia. Phil was hopefully at Columbia. In exchange, they should have put down Brooklyn College, Stonybrook University, all the SUNYs, CUNYs, FIT, and made a safe decision. If I had known Olga and perhaps Amanda better, I would’ve dragged them to check out SBU with me.

The only place to go to after Stuy is medical school, for obstetrics, general practitioner, or psychiatry, in my opinion.

In short, do what your freshman year friends do. In roughly 20 years, the people who hate you now and think you’re stupid and ugly still will. When I read Neil Gaiman’s Poison Ivy comic, it was reassuring and so is the Harlequin one. American Gods: nice novel from a condescending psychopath. My reading list is Nabokov and ancient Italian, graphic novels for rest, the usual Catholic school girl fare. I eat okonomiyaki, chicken Milanese, and my next trip is on the way. Goodbye. Life ruined by Stuyvesant High School. I’m tired of Ecuadorians copying me. Last piece of advice: read the yearbooks!! If I’d taken AP Psychology, I’d at least be on SNAP right away. The best episode of my this is my heavenly life tv show will involve getting my SBU degree rescinded. ",1,1753240031.0,u_orange_moon,0,1.0,False

The wind's picking up something fierce out here tonight, folks. I can hear it whistling through the pine trees surrounding our little station, rattling the windows like restless spirits trying to get in. Perfect weather for the stories we're about to share. You're listening to WNMR – Nocturnal Mysteries Radio, and I'm your host, Edward Cronkite, broadcasting live from our transmitter station deep in the Blackwood Forest.

It's just past eleven on this October evening, and my coffee's grown cold while sorting through the mountain of letters, emails, and voice messages you've sent in response to last week's call. I asked for stories from those who work in the places where knowledge sleeps – our libraries, archives, and repositories of human memory. The response has been... overwhelming.

Tonight, we're diving into something special. Tales from the keepers of knowledge, those brave souls who tend to our books and manuscripts long after the rest of us have gone home. Because let me tell you something – when the fluorescent lights dim and the last patron shuffles out, these repositories of human knowledge take on a life of their own.

Our first story tonight comes from Grace. She sent me a handwritten letter – and yes, people still do that – postmarked from Chicago, Illinois. Her handwriting is precise, methodical, the kind you'd expect from someone who's spent years cataloging rare volumes. But there's a tremor in some of the later lines, a slight shake that speaks to something that shook her to her core.

Grace works at the Newberry Library, one of Chicago's most prestigious research institutions. For those unfamiliar, the Newberry isn't your typical public library. It's a fortress of rare books and manuscripts, a place where scholars come to commune with documents that have survived centuries. Grace has been there for seven years, working her way up from part-time shelver to full-time rare books librarian. She loves her job, she says. Or rather, she did.

Let me read you what Grace shared:

""Dear Mr. Cronkite,

I've been listening to your show for months now, usually while I'm doing late-night inventory work. There's something comforting about your voice echoing through the empty halls of the library, making the darkness feel less... occupied. But after what happened three weeks ago, I can't listen anymore. Every time I hear your voice, I'm reminded of that night, and I start hearing other sounds. Sounds that shouldn't exist.

I need to tell someone who might understand. Someone who won't immediately suggest I see a therapist or take a vacation. Someone who knows that some experiences can't be explained away with logic and medical degrees.

It was a Tuesday night in late September. I remember because we'd just received a new acquisition – a collection of 18th-century personal letters from a recently deceased estate in Lake Forest. Beautiful pieces, some still sealed with wax. The kind of discovery that makes a librarian's heart race.

I was working late, cataloging the new materials in our climate-controlled rare books room on the fourth floor. The Newberry closes to the public at five, but staff often stay much later. The building is enormous – six floors of reading rooms, offices, and storage areas that date back to 1893. During the day, it bustles with researchers and students. But after hours, it's a different creature entirely.

The rare books room where I work is accessed through a series of keycard-controlled doors. Security is tight – we're talking millions of dollars worth of irreplaceable documents. The room itself is kept at exactly 68 degrees with 45% humidity. No natural light ever touches these materials. It's illuminated by soft, warm LED panels that cast everything in a golden glow.

I was alone that night, which wasn't unusual. Dr. Patterson, our head curator, had left around seven, and Janet from acquisitions had gone home with a migraine around eight-thirty. The security guard, Martinez, was making his rounds on the lower floors. I could hear his radio crackling occasionally through the building's intercom system.

I was working at station seven, one of our examination tables positioned near the 16th-century manuscript section. Beautiful volumes bound in leather and vellum, some with brass clasps that have developed the most gorgeous patina over the centuries. The smell in that room – it's intoxicating. Paper and leather and time itself, if time has a scent.

I'd been photographing and describing a series of letters when I first heard it. The sound of pages turning.

Now, that might not seem strange in a library, but remember – I was alone, and these books don't just get handled casually. Each one requires specific protocols, gloves, proper lighting, careful positioning. You don't just flip through a 400-year-old manuscript like it's a paperback novel.

The sound was coming from section G-7, about thirty feet to my left. Slow, deliberate page turns. The kind of careful, reverent handling you'd expect from an experienced researcher. I could even hear the whisper of aged paper against paper, that distinctive rustle that old books make.

'Hello?' I called out, thinking maybe Martinez had come up to check on me. 'Dr. Patterson?'

Silence.

I waited a moment, then returned to my work. Old buildings make noises, right? Settling foundations, temperature changes, the HVAC system cycling. The Newberry is over a century old – it probably has sounds I haven't even discovered yet.

But then it happened again. Same deliberate rhythm. Page turn, pause, page turn, pause. Like someone was reading, taking their time to absorb each page before moving on.

I stood up from my workstation and walked toward section G-7. The golden LED lighting cast long shadows between the stacks, creating an almost honeyed atmosphere that should have been comforting but somehow felt heavy, expectant.

As I approached the area where the sound had originated, I noticed something odd. The air felt different. Thicker. And there was a smell underneath the usual library scents – something organic and slightly sweet, like flowers that had been pressed between pages for decades.

Section G-7 houses some of our most valuable medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. I know every volume in that section by heart. As I approached, I could see them all in their proper places, standing at attention in their custom-fitted boxes and protective sleeves.

But then I saw it.

One volume had been removed from its box and was lying open on the reading rest we keep positioned between the stacks. It was the Rosetti Illuminated Hours, a book of hours from approximately 1480, decorated with the most exquisite miniature paintings you've ever seen. Angels and saints rendered in gold and lapis lazuli, their faces so detailed you'd swear they were watching you.

The book was open to a page I knew well – a depiction of the Resurrection, showing Christ emerging from the tomb while angels looked on. But as I got closer, I noticed something that made my blood run cold.

The page was turning.

Not a fast flip, but a slow, careful lift of the edge, as if invisible fingers were gently coaxing the ancient vellum to reveal the next illustration. I watched, paralyzed, as the page completed its turn and settled against the rest of the book with the softest whisper.

Now it was open to the page showing the Angel of Death, a figure in black robes holding an hourglass, standing over a field of lilies.

I stood there for what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, waiting for my rational mind to provide an explanation. Air current from the ventilation system. Some kind of static electricity. A slight vibration from the building's infrastructure. Anything.

But as I watched, the book opened to a page I'd never seen before. And that's impossible, because I've cataloged every page of the Rosetti Hours. I've photographed them, described them, studied them under magnification. I know that book like I know my own heartbeat.

This page was different. The illumination style was similar, but the content... The content was a single image of a woman in a blue dress, sitting at a desk surrounded by books. She had dark hair pulled back in a bun, and she was wearing glasses. Modern glasses, not anything that would have existed in 1480.

She looked exactly like me.

I'm not talking about a general resemblance. I'm talking about an exact likeness, down to the small scar above my left eyebrow from when I fell off my bike as a kid. The woman in the illustration was even wearing the same green cardigan I had on that night.

But here's the thing that still makes my hands shake when I think about it – the woman in the illustration was looking up from her work, looking directly out of the page, and her mouth was moving. I could see her lips forming words, over and over again.

I leaned closer, trying to make out what she was saying, and that's when I heard it. Not with my ears, but somehow directly in my mind, like a whisper that bypassed my hearing entirely:

'Don't leave me here alone.'

I jerked backward so fast I knocked over the reading rest, sending the book tumbling to the floor. The sound of it hitting the carpet was like a gunshot in the silence. As I scrambled to pick it up, my hands shaking so badly I could barely function, the book fell open to its proper page – the Angel of Death illustration.

There was no mysterious woman. No modern dress or glasses or scar above an eyebrow. Just the traditional medieval imagery I'd seen hundreds of times before.

I carefully closed the book and returned it to its protective box, my hands trembling the entire time. Then I gathered my things, locked up the room, and left the building. I didn't finish my cataloging work. I didn't even turn off the lights properly. I just ran.

The next morning, I came in early to check on the Rosetti Hours. Everything was exactly as it should be. The book was properly stored, all the pages accounted for, no damage from its fall. Dr. Patterson complimented me on completing the previous night's inventory so efficiently. According to the work logs, I'd finished cataloging the entire new acquisition and had even completed the preliminary condition reports on twelve additional volumes.

I had no memory of doing any of that work.

But here's what really haunts me, Mr. Cronkite – three weeks later, I'm still hearing pages turning. Not just at work, but at home. In my apartment at night, I'll be reading or watching television, and I'll hear that same careful, deliberate rhythm coming from my bedroom. Page turn, pause, page turn, pause.

When I investigate, I never find anything out of place. But sometimes, on my bedside table, I'll find books I don't remember taking out from the library. Books that aren't even in our circulation system. Old volumes with no call numbers, no acquisition stamps, no catalog records.

And sometimes, late at night when I'm lying in bed trying to sleep, I can feel someone watching me. Not threatening, exactly, but... expectant. Like they're waiting for me to read to them, or with them. Like they don't want to be alone with all those words, all those stories, all that accumulated knowledge.

I've started sleeping with the lights on, Mr. Cronkite. Because in the dark, I can hear them clearly now – not just one set of pages turning, but dozens. A whole library's worth of books being read by people who are no longer there to read them.

Last night, I woke up to find a piece of paper on my nightstand. Written in my own handwriting, though I have no memory of writing it, were the words: 'The books remember everyone who ever loved them. They don't like to be forgotten.'

I don't know what to do. I love my job, I love those books, but I'm starting to think they love me back in a way that isn't... healthy. In a way that doesn't want to let me go.

If you read this on the air, Mr. Cronkite, please don't use my last name. The Newberry Library is a prestigious institution, and they don't need rumors of hauntings affecting their reputation. But if there are other librarians out there experiencing similar things, I'd like them to know they're not alone.

We're not alone, even when we think we are. Especially when we think we are.

Sincerely, Grace""

Well, Grace, I want you to know that your letter reached me, and more importantly, I believe every word of it. There's something about institutions of learning, especially the old ones, that seems to accumulate more than just knowledge. They accumulate the passion, the dedication, the love that people have poured into those books and documents over the decades.

I did some research after receiving your letter, Grace, and I discovered something interesting about the Newberry Library. In 1952, a librarian named Dorothy Meredith was found deceased at her desk in the rare books room after working late one evening. Natural causes, according to the reports – a heart attack brought on by stress. She'd been cataloging a new acquisition of medieval manuscripts.

The interesting thing is, Dorothy was known for her habit of talking to the books while she worked. Colleagues often heard her having full conversations in the rare books room, discussing the history of each piece, commenting on the craftsmanship of the illuminations. They found it charming, if a bit eccentric.

After her death, several staff members reported hearing voices in the rare books room during evening hours. Soft conversations, as if someone was still commenting on the manuscripts. The reports eventually stopped, but they lasted for nearly a year.

Grace, I can't tell you whether what you experienced was Dorothy trying to continue her work, or simply the building holding onto echoes of all the love and dedication that's been poured into it over the decades. But I can tell you this – if the books are indeed remembering everyone who ever loved them, then you're in good company.

The fog's rolling in thick tonight, listeners. I can barely see the treeline from the studio window. It's the kind of night when the boundary between our world and whatever lies beyond seems particularly thin. We've got more stories coming your way – tales from the archives, from the stacks, from the quiet corners where knowledge sleeps and dreams.

Stay with us. The night is young, and the books are just beginning to whisper their secrets.

We have a shared kitchen/breakroom, and it's typically used by 20-30 people. In this kitchen we have a variety of plates, bowls, coffee cups and other drink ware, and the majority of the set was donated to the office by my company. For the most part, people are considerate and clean up after themselves. However, there are a few (unknown) bad eggs who consistently leave their dirty dishes in the sink. We have a cleaning crew come by on Saturdays, but until then it's up to us to maintain cleanliness in our space. Our collection of dinnerware is small, maybe 8-10 pieces per style (8 plates, 8 bowls etc...), and 9 times out of 10, I find myself having to wash other people's dirty dishes just to have one for my own use. For awhile, I just went ahead and washed ALL the dishes in the sink when it was full because it was NEEDED, not because I wanted to, but because I felt it was the nice thing to do. However, lately I feel like it's gotten out of hand, and quite frankly, I'm fed up. For context, I am one of 3 women, the rest of the building staff are men, so the gender roles may come into play. I've attempted to make a lighthearted joke out of it, like taping little pictures of funny but snarky memes by the sink...but nothing's changed. 

Here's where I may be the asshole: I want to confiscate every dirty dish left in the sink (I'll wash them and keep them in my office and return eventually). Dirty plate? Taken. Your personal coffee cup? Taken. Oh no, there's no more dishes for you to reheat your leftovers? Bummer. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting to remove dirty dish ware from the kitchen sink? ",2,1753239877.0,AITAH,25,0.75,False

For the past 3 years, I have worked with a very difficult direct report. To give context, this person is smart and has excellent ideas, but a very, very bad attitude and entitlement. I set clear expectations of the role, and they always find something to complain about even about work hours 9-5 (that's our office policy). I have been lenient and even allowed them to work from a coffee shop or home a number of times.  They act as if the world owes everything to them. They always complain about work, despite me adjusting their workload,  shifting priorities, and pretty much catering to them. They are now leaving onto a new role, and I was their reference. I wrote a really good reference for them because I really wanted them to move on. To be frank, managing this person has been extremely difficult, and I really want them to move on. This person is my first direct report, and I admit I have allowed them to walk over me a little bit. This person also takes any feedback as a personal attack, and i have worked with my own manager on how to package feednack to them so it lands well. I am learning to be a better leader and a manager. 

They will be leaving in 2 weeks, and I wonder if I should hint in my farewell note about their entitlement. My friend says it's not worth it, and I should should just keep it short and wish them well. What's your take on this?

EDIT: I didn't expect this level of engagement, thank you! You all bring very great insights, and some commentary is harsh, but very much needed for my growth. I will not be petty. You are right. Thank you 😇",13,1753239798.0,managers,33,0.71,False

1m6y6u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1m6y6u3/food_police_or_responsible_caregiving_where_is/,"Food police or responsible caregiving, where is the line drawn?","I need advice but I may ramble and rant. 

TL:DR: How do I avoid being the food police but still practice responsible caregiving when my mother in law refuses to eat a balanced, low carb, low sodium diet? 

My mother-in-law moved in with us in Feb after her third hospitalization in 6 months. She has COPD, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and other stuff. She was a pack a day smoker for 60+ years until this Jan. Her diabetes is out of control because she doesn't understand or care to learn about carbs. She is convinced her high blood sugar is 100% related to her stress and pain and not related to her eating habits. She also says prior to living with us her blood sugar wasn't this high (but she didn't check it every day either - actually I checked her meter and she hadn't checked it in a year).

I am a patient person. I get along with everyone. I have had to play referee to hot heads before and I give people the benefit of the doubt - even assume the best of people most of the time. I'm annoyingly optimistic. So I say what I'm about to say with guilt and a sense of failure - my mother in law is the most selfish and meanest mother I've ever met. She is verbally abusive to her son (my husband) almost daily. So she is very difficult to work with. 

So regardless of that - she can't afford assisted living (and neither can we). She wasnt using her oxygen when she was living alone because she was a chain smoker and has experience first hand why oxygen and cigarettes don't mix. She may have also been responsible for burning her last rental down to the ground...

On top of that, she eats poorly. Fast food, pastries, cup o noodles. On top of that, she would leave condiments and jars of food that should have been refrigerated in her cupboards. Her apartment was filled to the brim with dirt, moldy food, an inch of oily dirt from the smoking. Oh and coffee grounds. On the floor, on the sink... (She also has Parkinson's so she has trouble not making a mess.) A pot of food that she cooked and never put away or threw or away. I don't know. Cleaning her apartment out was awful. I tossed most of her food/toiletries because they were so gross. She had a shoe organizer with about 6 pairs of white sneakers which were brown. With dust. No joke or exaggeration. She still tells at us for throwing away her things. Things that I replaced - mostly. I did not replace her perfume because I cannot tolerate perfume (I mean, to the point of vomit inducing migraines and difficulty breathing). 

So here we are 5 months in and we are struggling taking care of her. She hates living here and she makes it known. She says we don't understand how hard it was losing her independence (but we do). Oh we took her car keys away. She doesn't have a driver's license, her car has not been registered for a few years, and she doesn't have any car insurance. Plus, her car is beat up from the multiple poles she has hit in parking lots. She hates us for taking away her keys. Calls us names for it because she is perfectly capable of driving. 

We started off by not imposing too many restrictions. We knew it would be a hard transition for her but we didn't want to be the food police. I didn't realize that she has no concept of carbs. The first day she got up at 6am, she ate 2 large croissants, a muffin, and a banana. She left food out on the counter all the time - mayo, half n half, lunch meat... She also went through a box of 24 k cups of coffee in 3 days. I also caught her beating my Keurig with her fist because it wasn't working properly (too slow). 

Why didn't we cook for her you ask? We did but she would get up at 4am and raid the kitchen. She doesn't wait. She doesn't ask, she demands. She also barged into my bedroom at 7am demanding her pills. (She was taking them incorrectly so we put them in a pill organizer for her). She also shoves food in her pockets or shoves things in her mouth in the kitchen where we can't see her because she doesn't want anyone telling her what she can and can't eat. 

Okay, let her have her way and make her own choices? We tried this. We filled the fridge with the things she said she liked that fell within a low carb, low sodium diet.  But she hated that. Mostly she hates that I replaced her regular microwave popcorn with salt free, smaller portioned bags. And she would just eat 3 at a time so it defeated the purpose. 

She yelled at us about the popcorn so I said fine, give her what she wants - a Kirkland box of popcorn which is 44 bags at 45 carbs each. She ate the whole box in 11 days. She ran out of insulin. And I asked her, how often are you giving yourself a shot - she said Everytime she eats which she said was about 8 times a day. 

We had to take her coffee away. My husband puts enough for one pot in there before he goes to bed and that's all she gets because she was drinking over 10 cups a day and getting coffee grounds everywhere. Now we are to the point that we think we need to take the popcorn away. Or at least only put one out a day so she can't eat 4 bags a day. I even bought the skinny pop which the nutritionalist approved but she yelled at us for getting her fake popcorn...

Did I mention she also blames us for her gaining weight? Her pain levels being higher? I know I don't sound empathetic. My husband and I also have health issues. He has chronic pain from back injuries and I have vestibular neuroitis, migraines, diabetes, gastro issues, nerve compression, and so on. My husband has been my caregiver for a year and he is patient and kind... On Father's Day I had to take him to urgent care. I told her and she said ok - and in the same breath asked if I could take her to get her haircut - mind you, I don't drive often and she already asked him the day before and he said not till Monday and we were on the way to urgent care!! 

She does not have dementia or memory loss so long as she keeps her oxygen levels up. I just don't know what to do. I hide food she shouldn't have. I've tried giving her her own shelf in the fridge with all the foods she likes. I don't nag her about drinking water which she refuses to do - she only drinks coffee, Earl grey tea, and diet coke. 

Okay. Sorry - that was a rant. I'm frustrated. I don't want to be the food police but at what point am I being an irresponsible caregiver by allowing her access to foods she shouldn't eat in the quantities that she is eating?

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a body exfoliator depends on several key features including the type of exfoliant (physical or chemical), the ingredients, the texture, and the overall formulation. Different skin types and needs require different exfoliators, so understanding these features is crucial.

**Type of Exfoliant:** Physical exfoliators use abrasive ingredients to manually scrub away dead skin cells, while chemical exfoliators utilize acids to dissolve the bonds between dead skin cells.

Physical exfoliators, such as scrubs with salt, sugar, or microbeads (though microbeads are often avoided due to environmental concerns), provide immediate visible results. They are best for those who prefer a more hands-on approach and want to feel the exfoliation process. Though, they can be too harsh for sensitive skin if not used carefully. Chemical exfoliators containing ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) offer a gentler approach,penetrating deeper into the skin to unclog pores and promote cell turnover.

**Ingredients:** The ingredients in a body exfoliator can significantly impact its effectiveness and suitability for different skin types.

Ingredients like salicylic acid (BHA) are excellent for acne-prone skin due to their ability to penetrate pores and dissolve oil and dead skin cells. Glycolic acid (AHA) is effective for improving skin texture and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Natural ingredients like sugar, salt, coffee grounds, and fruit enzymes (such as papain or bromelain) provide gentler exfoliation and offer additional benefits like antioxidant properties. Look for formulations that combine exfoliating agents with moisturizing ingredients such as shea butter, aloe vera, or hyaluronic acid to prevent dryness and irritation.

**Texture:** The texture of a body exfoliator affects its ease of use and the level of abrasion it provides.

Scrubs with larger particles offer more intense exfoliation, while finer particles are gentler and suitable for sensitive areas.Gel-based exfoliators are lightweight and easy to spread, making them ideal for daily use. Cream-based exfoliators are often more hydrating and better suited for dry skin. Consider the texture preference based on your skin type and desired level of exfoliation. Such as, a coarser scrub might be preferable for rough areas like elbows and knees, while a finer scrub would be more suitable for the chest and back.

**Formulation:** The overall formulation of a body exfoliator, including its pH level and the presence of additional ingredients, impacts its effectiveness and potential for irritation.

A well-formulated exfoliator will have a pH level that is compatible with the skin's natural pH to minimize irritation. Look for formulations that are free of harsh chemicals like parabens, sulfates, and artificial fragrances, which can cause allergic reactions or skin sensitivities. Some exfoliators also contain antioxidants, vitamins, and other beneficial ingredients that nourish and protect the skin while exfoliating.

Key features of the best body exfoliators for men include:

* Effective exfoliating agents (physical or chemical)
* High-quality and beneficial ingredients
* Appropriate texture for different skin types
* Well-balanced and gentle formulation

## Core Benefits

Using a body exfoliator regularly offers numerous benefits for men's skin, from improved texture and tone to reduced ingrown hairs and breakouts. It's a simple yet effective way to enhance your grooming routine and maintain healthy, radiant skin.

**Improved Skin Texture and Tone:** Regular exfoliation removes the buildup of dead skin cells that can make the skin look dull, rough, and uneven.By sloughing away these dead cells, the exfoliator reveals the fresh, healthy skin underneath, resulting in a smoother, softer, and more radiant complexion. For instance, incorporating a body scrub into your routine 2-3 times a week can help to even out skin tone and reduce the appearance of blemishes and discoloration, leading to a healthier overall appearance.

**Reduced Ingrown Hairs:** Exfoliation is particularly beneficial for men who shave or wax their body hair.

By removing dead skin cells that can trap hairs beneath the surface, exfoliation helps to prevent ingrown hairs and razor bumps. This is because exfoliating before shaving allows the razor to glide smoothly over the skin's surface,minimizing irritation and promoting a closer,cleaner shave. Regularly exfoliating after shaving or waxing also helps to keep the skin clear and prevents new ingrown hairs from forming.

**minimized Breakouts and Clogged Pores:** Exfoliating helps to unclog pores and remove excess oil and impurities that can lead to breakouts and acne.

By removing the barrier of dead skin cells, the exfoliant allows cleansing agents to penetrate deeper into the pores, effectively clearing out dirt, oil, and debris. This is especially vital for areas like the back and chest, which are prone to breakouts due to increased sweat and oil production.Combining exfoliation with a gentle cleanser can further enhance these benefits, leading to clearer, healthier skin.

**Increased Product Absorption:** Exfoliating the skin allows other skincare products, such as moisturizers and serums, to penetrate more effectively.

By removing the layer of dead skin cells, these products can reach the underlying layers of skin more easily, delivering their beneficial ingredients directly where they are needed. This can enhance the effectiveness of your skincare routine and lead to better overall results.

Core Benefits include:

* Improves skin texture and tone
* Reduces ingrown hairs
* Minimizes breakouts and clogged pores
* Increases product absorption

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right body exfoliator and using it correctly can be confusing. Here are some common questions and answers to help you navigate the world of body exfoliation.

**How often should I exfoliate my body?**
The frequency of exfoliation depends on your skin type and the type of exfoliator you are using. Generally, exfoliating 2-3 times per week is sufficient for most men. If you have sensitive skin, start with once a week and gradually increase as tolerated. Avoid over-exfoliating, as this can lead to irritation, dryness, and inflammation.

**can I use a body exfoliator on my face?**
It is generally not recommended to use a body exfoliator on your face, as the skin on the face is much more delicate than the skin on the body. Body exfoliators often contain coarser particles and harsher ingredients that can be too abrasive for facial skin, leading to irritation, redness, and damage. instead, use a facial exfoliator specifically formulated for the face.

**What should I do after exfoliating my body?**
After exfoliating, it is indeed critically important to rinse your skin thoroughly with lukewarm water and pat it dry with a soft towel. Immediately follow with a moisturizer to replenish any lost moisture and keep your skin hydrated. This helps to prevent dryness, irritation, and flakiness. Look for moisturizers containing ingredients like shea butter, hyaluronic acid, or aloe vera to soothe and hydrate the skin.

**What are the signs of over-exfoliating?**
Signs of over-exfoliating include redness, irritation, dryness, flakiness, sensitivity, and even breakouts. If you experience any of these symptoms, reduce the frequency of exfoliation or switch to a gentler exfoliator. It is indeed also critically important to avoid using other possibly irritating products, such as retinoids or harsh cleansers, while your skin is recovering.

## Key Features Analysis

The purse holder hook market in 2025 is characterized by a range of materials, designs, and weight capacities. Understanding the technical specifications of each model is crucial for making an informed purchase.**Weight Capacity:** The maximum weight a purse holder hook can support is a critical factor. Models typically range from 5 lbs to 20 lbs or more. Higher weight capacities are essential for larger, heavier handbags.

A precise weight rating is very important when determining which hook will adequately serve individual needs. It should be noted that listed specifications will vary depending on the manufacturer, and independant lab testing can sometimes reveal more accurate figures.

**Material Composition:** Purse holder hooks are commonly made from materials such as stainless steel, zinc alloy, aluminum, or plastic. Stainless steel and zinc alloy offer both durability and a premium look, while aluminum provides a lightweight yet sturdy option. Plastic models are generally the moast affordable but may not offer the same level of durability.

The material selected impacts durability, aesthetics, and corrosion resistance. Some hooks may also feature decorative elements such as rhinestones or enamel coatings.**Foldable Design & Portability:** Most purse holder hooks feature a foldable design for easy storage and portability.When folded, the hook should be compact enough to fit easily in a purse, pocket, or travel bag.

Pay close attention to the hinge mechanism's durability, which is essential for long-term use. Some models include magnetic closures to keep the hook securely folded when not in use.

**Tabletop Compatibility:** The design of the hook determines its compatibility with different tabletop thicknesses and edge styles. Look for models with a rubberized or non-slip base to prevent slipping and protect surfaces.

The overhang length and angle of the hook are also important factors to consider for stability. Hooks with adjustable arms or flexible designs offer greater versatility across various tables.

**Embedded Non-Slip pad:** Many purse hooks incorporate an embedded, integrated non-slip material to boost friction between the table surface and the hook contact point. This provides better stability, especially on slick surfaces such as glass and polished wood.

These non-slip pads are often made from rubber, silicone, or textured polymers. The quality and design of the pad impact its functionality, so looking for products with well-reviewed non-slip design is recommended.**Swivel Functionality:** Some designs feature a swivel joint that allows the hook to rotate while attached to a surface. This allows for easy bag access, while protecting the hook from potential damages that might otherwise occur from twisting or pulling on the hook by accident.

Models offering a robust swivel motion can be especially advantageous for users carrying larger or heavier bags that may have a tendency to apply greater torsion to the hook.

## Core Benefits

Purse holder hooks offer several practical advantages, making them an essential accessory for many people. From improved hygiene to enhanced security and institution, these hooks provide tangible benefits in various settings.

**Improved Hygiene:** By keeping your purse off the floor, purse holder hooks significantly reduce the risk of exposure to germs, dirt, and other contaminants. This is notably important in public places such as restaurants, restrooms, and waiting rooms.

Users report a noticeable reduction in dirt and stains on their purses after consistent use of a purse holder hook. This maintains the purse’s appearance and reduces the need for frequent cleaning.

**Enhanced Security:** Purse holder hooks keep your handbag within sight and reach, minimizing the risk of theft or accidental loss. Having your purse securely hanging from a table or desk allows you to keep a watchful eye on your belongings at all times.This is especially beneficial in crowded or unfamiliar environments were you might potentially be more vulnerable to theft. The presence of a hook can also deter potential thieves who might potentially be looking for an easy target.

**Space-Saving Convenience:** Purse holder hooks provide a convenient alternative to placing your purse on a chair, table, or floor, freeing up valuable space for other items. This is particularly useful in small or crowded spaces, such as restaurants or offices.

The hook keeps your purse organized and easily accessible, allowing you to quickly retrieve items without rummaging through your bag. This can save time and reduce frustration, particularly when you’re on the go.

**Protection from damage:** Hanging your purse using a purse hook prevents it from being accidentally kicked, stepped on, or spilled on. This protects the fabric, hardware, and contents of your purse from potential damage.

this benefit is particularly valuable for protecting delicate or expensive handbags from wear and tear. The hook also minimizes the risk of your purse being scratched or scuffed by rough surfaces.

**Increased Organization:** Purse hooks help keep your belongings organized by providing a designated spot for your purse. This reduces clutter and makes it easier to find what you need.A designated spot may also improve the organization of other items, such as smartphones, keys, and wallets, as users are more likely to consciously organize surrounding belongings.

## FAQs Section

Many consumers have questions about the functionality, compatibility, and care of purse holder hooks. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions to help you make an informed purchase.

**Are purse holder hooks suitable for all types of tables?**
Purse holder hooks are designed to work with a wide range of table types, but compatibility may vary depending on the table thickness, edge style, and surface material. Some hooks may not be suitable for very thick tables or tables with unusually shaped edges. Hooks with rubberized or non-slip bases are generally more versatile and provide better grip on smooth surfaces.

Consider measuring the thickness of the tables you typically use before purchasing a hook to ensure compatibility. Adjustable or flexible designs offer greater versatility across various table types.

**How much weight can a typical purse holder hook support?**
The weight capacity of a purse holder hook varies depending on the material, design, and construction. Most models can support between 5 lbs and 20 lbs, but some heavy-duty hooks may be able to handle even more weight. Always check the manufacturer's specifications before using a hook to ensure that it can safely support the weight of your purse.

avoid overloading the hook, as this can damage the hook or the table. Also, be mindful not to swing the bag around excessively, as the dynamic forces can exceed the static weight rating.**How should I clean and maintain my purse holder hook?**
cleaning and maintaining your purse holder hook is essential for preserving its appearance and functionality. Wipe the hook regularly with a damp cloth to remove dirt, dust, and fingerprints. For stubborn stains, use a mild soap or detergent. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can scratch or damage the surface.

Check the hinge mechanism periodically and lubricate it with a small amount of oil or grease if necessary. Store the hook in a dry place when not in use to prevent rust or corrosion.**Are purse holder hooks airport security kind?**
Most purse holder hooks are made from materials that are safe to carry through airport security. Though, some hooks with decorative elements or sharp edges might potentially be subject to additional scrutiny. To avoid delays, it's best to keep your purse holder hook in your purse or carry-on bag during security screening.

If you're unsure about the TSA regulations regarding a particular hook, check the TSA website or contact your airline for more information.

I'm from Argentina, and my boyfriend (21) is a passionate barista who's about to fulfill his dream of opening his own specialty coffee shop. I'm incredibly proud of him and want to give him a meaningful gift to celebrate this big milestone.

Like, if you were in his situation, what would you like as a gift?

I'm looking for ideas that are not about our relationship (so no romantic gifts), but rather something that connects with his love for coffee and his new role as a coffee shop owner. It could be something **useful, decorative, inspiring, or even symbolic**—as long as it feels thoughtful and relevant to his journey.

He’s very into **aesthetic, modern, minimalist design**, with a touch of brutalism. I know very little about the specialty coffee world myself, so I’d really appreciate any ideas you can share.

A small lamp glows in the corner, casting a golden hue across the living room. Marina and Syrenwe sit curled up on her big, overused couch. They’re both in panties and oversized shirts — not glamorous, but safe. Two steaming mugs of hot cocoa rest on the coffee table. The day was long, full of difficult patients and draining emotions. Now, all that's left is quiet.]

Syrenwe (softly, curled into one corner of the couch): “I’m still thinking about that little boy we saw today... the one with the broken arm. He was so scared. Poor thing.”

Marina (sighs, leaning back with her mug in hand):“I know. His mom looked more traumatized than him, though. Honestly, if he hadn’t smiled at your stickers, I think I would’ve cried.”(she chuckles faintly, then takes a sip of cocoa) “You were great with him, Wewe.”

Syrenwe (blushing faintly):“Thanks... I try. I just... wish I could do more sometimes.”

Marina (gently teasing):“Always trying to save the whole world, huh?” (She gives a little smirk, but it fades as she watches Syrenwe look down. After a pause, her voice softens)“I get it. That feeling doesn’t really go away.”

Syrenwe (lifting her gaze):“How did you get into medicine, Marina? I mean... you seem like someone who could’ve done a hundred other things.”

Marina (grinning):“I could’ve been a pop star, obviously. Or a pirate. Maybe a flamenco dancer. But nah... I guess it started with my mom.” 

(She sets her mug down and leans back, looking up at the ceiling with a small nostalgic sigh.)

Marina:“She was a doctor too. In Guantánamo. Worked long shifts, came home smelling like antiseptic and cafecito. I thought she was magic. My dad fixed cars — he could build you an engine from nothing. I used to think if they touched something together, it could come back to life.”

Syrenwe (smiling softly):“That sounds beautiful... like something out of a novel.”

Marina (chuckles, then shrugs): l“It wasn’t always pretty. I mean, I had a happy enough childhood, but rough, you know? People teased me. A lot. Especially for my name.”

Syrenwe (carefully): “Jesusa... Flamingo, right?”

Marina (groans and hides her face in a pillow):
""Sí, Dios mío. Marina Jesusa Flamingo Lopez. My mom was feeling poetic and tropical the day I was born.”

Syrenwe (giggling softly): ""It’s... unique. Memorable.”

Marina (peeking out from behind the pillow):“You can say it. It’s ridiculous.” (But then, more quietly)“I used to cry about it. My cousins — I have like sixty — they’d call me ‘Jesusa la Flaminga’ and squawk at me. I learned to yell back louder than them. I guess I never really stopped.”

(They both laugh, but there's a pause. Marina’s smile softens again.)

Marina: ""College was my escape. I got into med school in São Paulo. That’s where I met Diego.”

Syrenwe (gently):
“Your husband?”

Marina (nods, her voice losing volume): “Yeah... Diego Cavalera. He was Portuguese. Studying architecture. Sweetest man I’ve ever met. He liked silence, which was weird because I never shut up. But somehow we fit. Like I was the spark and he was the grounding wire.”

(Marina looks down at her hands.)

Marina:“We got married a couple years after we met. I changed my name — Cavalera. I thought it sounded cooler, more... like someone people wouldn’t laugh at. And it reminded me of him. Strong. Balanced.”

Syrenwe (softly, her brows knit with quiet concern):
“...What happened?”

Marina (exhales through her nose, not crying — but close):“Car accident. Rainy night. He was just going to get groceries.”(She blinks a few times)“I never saw him again.”

(Silence. The rain continues outside. Syrenwe gently reaches over and places a hand over Marina’s. Marina doesn’t look up, but she doesn’t pull away either.)

Marina (barely above a whisper):“I left everything behind after that. São Paulo. My friends. Our apartment. I moved here and started over. It's been... messy. But I try to help people. It keeps me sane.”

(Syrenwe scoots a little closer on the couch. The lamp flickers slightly with the wind.)

Syrenwe:“You’re stronger than you think, Marina.”

Marina (finally looking at her):“I don’t always feel that way.”

Syrenwe (a soft smile): “That’s okay. I think people like us... we don’t have to be strong all the time.” 

(Their hands remain quietly intertwined for a moment longer. Marina leans her head gently on Syrenwe’s shoulder, and for once, she doesn’t feel the need to be loud or witty. The silence is okay.)

Marina (murmuring): “Thanks for being here, Wewe.”

Syrenwe (smiling, blushing just a little): “Anytime.”

(The two sit in the golden light, cocoa cooling, hearts just a little more open, the air thick with something unspoken and gentle.)
.
Syrenwe (softly, after a long pause):
“I’ve never lost someone like that.”(She hesitates)
“But I do know what it’s like... to feel like you're rebuilding yourself from pieces. I— I second guess myself all the time. Even when I know I’ve done something right.”

Marina (tilting her head to glance up at her): “You? But you're so... thoughtful. You care so much. It's like... you have this quiet light around you.”

Syrenwe (blushing, her eyes flicking down): “I try to hide how unsure I feel, I guess. People think I’m calm, but inside I’m usually panicking about everything.”

Marina (grinning gently):“You wear it well. I would've never guessed.” (She lifts her head, sitting up slightly now, but still close.)“I mean, yeah, you blush when I call you Wewe, and you give me that little pouty look when I tease you… but I always thought you had this quiet strength. Like… like snow that doesn't melt, no matter how loud the world gets.”

Syrenwe (smiling shyly):“That’s… kind of beautiful.”

Marina (playfully bumping her shoulder): “I can be poetic too, y’know. Not just a mouthy doctor with tragic eyebrows.”

Syrenwe (laughs, covering her mouth):“Your eyebrows are fine!”

Marina:“They’re fierce. Like battle flags. But I digress.” (Her tone softens again)“It means a lot… talking like this. I don’t usually let people in. Not since… well. You know.”

Syrenwe (looking at her gently):“I’m glad you did.”
(A pause)“And I’m really glad I’m here tonight.”

(They look at each other — that quiet, slightly awkward moment where everything feels suspended in the air. Marina leans in slightly, eyes soft and searching.)

Syrenwe (whispering shyly):“Can I... kiss you?”

Marina (smiles): ""Like you really have to ask.”

(Marina leans in slowly, carefully — the way you do when something matters. Their lips meet in a soft, tentative kiss, barely more than a brush. It’s warm. Honest. Gentle. A beginning, not a promise.)

(Just as Marina starts to lean back, Syrenwe shifts slightly — and misjudges where the edge of the couch ends. With a startled squeak, she tips right off the couch and lands on the rug with a light thump and a shocked blink.)

Syrenwe: “Ow—!”

Marina (blinking, then bursting into laughter):“¡Dios mío! Wewe!”

Syrenwe (face bright red, laughing too as she tries to sit up):“I’m okay! I’m okay! That was just... gravity being rude.”

(Marina slides off the couch, still giggling, and crouches beside her, offering a hand.)

Marina (grinning): ""You just wanted me to come down here with you, admit it.”

Syrenwe (laughing through the embarrassment): “Maybe.”

(They sit there together for a moment, cross-legged on the rug, shoulders brushing. The tension has lifted — now replaced by that easy, happy kind of closeness. The kind that lingers even after the laughter fades.)

Marina (softer now):“You’re full of surprises, Wewe.”

Syrenwe (smiling shyly): ""So are you.”

I think I look decent. I will be glad to swap pics once we've been chatting for a little while. I am an INTJ / Ambivert. I look pretty young for my age, I get mistaken as someone in their early to mid 20s all the time. Still have all my hair. (lol)

I have a lot of hopes, dreams, and goals. I try my best to be kind and caring. I would say I have a dry sense of humor, and enjoy deep conversations about life that could go anywhere. I'm not a city person but I don't like living in the middle of nowhere either.

I enjoy a variety of different things. I love playing video games even though lately I haven't had time. Doing anything outdoors when the weather is nice calms me and makes me relax. I enjoy hiking trails around here locally.

Road trips, exploring new music (lets swap music?) , reading books, long drives through the countryside with good coffee and conversation, watching movies or shows, and listening to podcasts. If you play certain games, I will gladly play them with you! I'm also open to trying new hobbies with my partner. I enjoy going to food festivals and trying new types of food too.

I live in a small-ish town here in NC and don't really get the opportunity to meet people outside of work too often due to having a busy week, then being too tired on the weekends but I'd like to change that! I am a sweet guy who just wants that special spark with someone again. I want to meet a girl who will hijack my weekends and prevent me from becoming a workaholic, lol.

Long story short, I want to enjoy quality time together even if it means just voice chatting at first. If you show me that you're worth it, I will make you a priority. Ideally I am not looking for someone too far away from me, but if you're really amazing I will make an exception. I'd like to move somewhere else, as I have grown up in NC and lived here my whole life, although I have traveled around quite a bit.

I have a stable career, college educated, no kids, and in good financial standing / financially responsible with no real debt or criminal record. I work two jobs and have a bachelors degree, and would love to meet someone for 2025. 🫶

1m6xtog,https://i.redd.it/4ai6m48mejef1.jpeg,Best solar generator?,"What’s the “best” solar generator for making sure batteries stay topped off on say a week long off grid camping trip?

I have a camper that has 400w installed solar and 2 AGM batteries in parallel for about 160 AH of capacity or so.

Understand it’s a vague question, so maybe focus on reliability, price per watt hour, and value ratio (say something includes 400w of solar panels).

I’d like it to have a 30 amp plug so I don’t have to use the dog bone connector, and if at all possible I’d really like something that could run the ac for 20 to 30 minutes.

I don’t use a lot of power off grid / 12V fridge (I leave the drink fridge outside off), a few lights, water pump, igniters for propane water heater and stove, and a couple of fans. Plus keeping phone and air pods charged.

I was camping this weekend for a shakedown off grid trip and it was suddenly more overcast than expected so I picked up a 2000w pure sine wave inverter from Harbor Freight. It powered everything but the AC just fine - I used it to microwave food and run a coffee pot.

For those interested, the inverter is a cool option that lets you hook into your truck battery (make sure your car is running!) and essentially turn your truck into a generator. I used it to top off the batteries before bed, but want something quiet because the campground I like to stay in has some really awesome sites in the generator free loop.  Running a solar charger instead of a gas generator or the truck inverter opens up some cool spots for me.",2,1753238640.0,RVLiving,6,0.75,False

I work as a barista and I also LOVE seeing the wide scope of humanity that comes in and gets coffee. Being on the register is my favorite thing, because I can strike up conversations with people and learn about them. And nobody is sadder after they get their coffee- it improves everyone’s day!

Fundamentally, I really do think humans are amazing and good. We all are together, living our own lives and getting through the world as best we can, sometimes intersecting and sometimes never meeting. There’s so much bad out there, but there’s so much good too. 

Right now, I haven’t been sleeping more than 3 hours a night. So instead of just laying in my bed, I’ve been going outside and watching the Perseids- the meteor shower happening right now. My backyard is full of fireflies and the temperature has been perfect!

My psychiatrist has told me I’m in a pretty worrying place right now, especially with the lack of sleep. But at least the world is a beautiful place! 

Anyways- I’ll stop my rambling. I hope you are all doing well!

I read my rape book they hand rape victims and never felt seen but also felt my shields go down. I walked to a bridge and started to watch the cars go by, seeing how my dead body would disrupt traffic and cause a big crash. I thought everyone gave up on me. But then, I remembered, that God cares and he wants me to prove everyone wrong. I fell asleep and woke up a new person. I walked from the bridge and returned to the coffee shop where I got those resources. Walked in as if they never saw me cry.

I may have DID but I declare myself as a survivor. A boss. And a bitch with a soft spot. I will let no one tear me down

This world is cold and mechanical, yes, but in every winter is a volcano of warmth and fire. There are people who care about you. For me, it is the LGBTQ community and my own African American community.

I believe suicide is the absence in the belief your life will get better. The absence of love and warmth. And the romanticization of death and revenge. No one dies just to die.

The worst and most traumatizing part about it is that it stops being about revenge. Because you realize that even if your life ends, they will still somehow blame it on you and use you as an example. That's why I got up. Suicide isn't the solution. Opening their eyes by showing how much stronger your worldview is than there's.

They see me homeless on the streets as evidence that their comfort and stagnation is better than critical thinking and progress. My entire family turned against me because of my differing beliefs than theirs. They turned because I questioned their lifestyles so they made me go through hell to ""teach me a lesson"". But I will show them all the superiority of my outlook.

Black lives do matter. People should be able to have sex as they please and who they please with. Drugs should be legal and not criminalized for usage. Pure capitalism is dystopian. The government needs to intervene. Homeless people deserve a safe place to live. Mentally ill people deserve to be heard not silenced. Women deserve rights and a chance to prove themselves (as well as the right to have needed protections). Mental illness deserves sympathy not stigma. Children deserve more anatomy. Rape should be as bad as murder. Trans rights are human rights. Empathy and understanding over villainization and stereotyping

The world crushes those who question it because letting ""dangerous"" ideas grow will destroy reality as we know it. However if you deem an idea dangerous then perhaps it is your worldview that is flimsy and flawed.

I'm from Argentina, and my boyfriend (21) is a passionate barista who's about to fulfill his dream of opening his own specialty coffee shop. I'm incredibly proud of him and want to give him a meaningful gift to celebrate this big milestone.

I'm looking for ideas that are not about our relationship (so no romantic gifts), but rather something that connects with his love for coffee and his new role as a coffee shop owner. It could be something **useful, decorative, inspiring, or even symbolic**—as long as it feels thoughtful and relevant to his journey.

He’s very into **aesthetic, modern, minimalist design**, with a touch of brutalism. I know very little about the specialty coffee world myself, so I’d really appreciate any ideas you can share.

I'm open to: Books - equipment or tools - accessories - decor for the café - sentimental (but coffee related) ideas - and anything you'd recommend to someone starting ther own coffee place <3

The M1 Max 16” I have has recently suffered a coffee spill, but fortunately most of the parts still work. I took apart the laptop, and dabbed up the coffee with alcohol. Right now, There’s one USB port that isn’t working. Just for curiosity sake, is it possible to use an M2 upper case assembly for an M1 Max? I’ve looked at photos, and it looks like it might. However, without tearing down the laptop completely and trying it - I am not sure if it will.

Otherwise, it’s probably looking for another logic board for an M2, but from what I’ve noticed supply is so limited and Apple charges so much that it’s almost not worth it. Any suggestions appreciated.",4,1753238388.0,macbookpro,1,0.84,False
1m6xqaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m6xqaw/should_your_rug_go_under_the_coffee_table_or/,Should your rug go under the coffee table or around it?,"I recently renovated my living room and faced this exact dilemma - should the rug go under my coffee table or around it? After extensive research and consulting with interior designers, I've found some clear answers that might help you too.

The short answer is: Yes, your rug should absolutely go under your coffee table. Here's why:

First, placing your coffee table on top of the rug creates a more cohesive and anchored look in your living space. When the rug runs underneath, it ties all your furniture pieces together and makes the room feel more purposeful and organized.

I learned this the hard way when I initially tried placing my rug around the coffee table. It made the room feel disconnected and somehow smaller. The floating coffee table created an awkward visual break in the space.

Here are some practical guidelines I've discovered:

- Leave 18-24 inches of rug visible on all sides of your coffee table
- Make sure at least the front legs of your sofa and chairs sit on the rug
- Choose a rug size that's proportional to your room (8x10 or 9x12 work well for most spaces)

Speaking of coffee tables, I found some gorgeous options that work perfectly with this rug placement strategy here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Some additional considerations:

1. Protection: Rugs protect your flooring from furniture scratches
2. Sound absorption: Having the rug under furniture reduces noise
3. Visual flow: Creates a natural pathway through the room
4. Maintenance: Easier to vacuum when everything's properly aligned

There are some exceptions though. If you have a very small living room or an unusually shaped coffee table, you might need to adjust these rules. Also, if you're working with a vintage or antique rug, you'll want to ensure your coffee table won't damage it.

I recently helped my sister with her living room design, and we found some amazing modern and traditional coffee tables that work perfectly with this under-rug placement: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Remember, the goal is to create a balanced, welcoming space that feels intentional and put together. Having your rug extend under your coffee table is one of those small details that makes a big difference in achieving that polished look.

One final tip: If you're still unsure about placement, try laying out painter's tape on your floor to visualize different rug sizes and positions before making your final decision. This helped me tremendously when I was planning my space.

Hope this helps you make the right choice for your living room setup!",1,1753238363.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

It has new brakes, new front struts with updated interior from a 2010 model and updated body kit/wheels. 
I really like this Bentley. It wouldn’t be my daily tho (more of a take it out when I go golfing or when I go to a car n coffee or to dinner.) 

Spending 3-7k annually to keep a Bentley running well isn’t an issue for me. 
I’m curious if it is an actual money pit like people suggest it is and if I should just take my 30k somewhere else?? I’ve never owned or thought of owning a Bentley until I saw this listing.

I know gardenias are finicky, so I've been careful not to let the soil dry out, and when I started noticing it struggling I put some coffee grounds in the soil in case it was the pH. Any ideas what the issue could be? I assume there's an issue with the soil, since the flowers were very healthy at the store. [This](https://shop.americanplant.store/ocean-forest-potting-soil-1-5-cu-ft/#description) was the potting soil that I added when repotting, is there anything bad for the plant in this potentially?

  
The plan gets partial to full sun, and although it is in the 80s to 90s where I am, it was even hotter in the weeks before I bought the plant and didn't notice any signs of heat stress then — so I assume its not that. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Lately, I’ve been seriously thinking… *worth it pa ba ipagpatuloy yung passion ko sa photography/videography?*

So I’ve been considering shifting to something new and more potentially stable… like starting a **Coffee Cart Pop-Up here in North Caloocan**.

I’m honestly tempted to sell my camera and all my gear and go all in with the coffee business.  
The thing is — wala naman talaga akong solid knowledge sa business side, and that scares me. Pero gusto ko na talaga maging *financially stable*. Pagod na pagod na akong mabuhay na parang nagsu-survive lang araw-araw.

Has anyone here ever made a big pivot like this before?

1m6xpdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1m6xpdc/i_see_you_soon/,I See You Soon,"Our paths get to cross before diverging again and my spirits lift at your upcoming presence. It brings me such peace to sit with you. 

Shared coffee. Shared stories. Shared laughter and worries. 

But the hardest words I'll still keep inside. We're not yet at our parting, so I can't ask you to stay; and I don't want to make your life difficult or intrude on your  heart. I don't know well enough that my affection won't cause you hurt, and the last thing I want to cause you is pain. 

You can probably see it, though it goes politely ignored, and I'm grateful you don't use it against me. You've always been in my corner and helped me lift myself up, and really you're well out of my league. 

It might be a while though, between this coffee and next, and the weeks between our last and now have been painful. Our friendship never hurt. Not until now. And for the sake of your softness I hope the only one hurting is me. 

The pain I can bear, and bear it I will; our friendship has a limited lifespan. Better to sit and enjoy what I have, laughter and coffee and smiles, than to ruin it all and have you leave early. 

But after the coffee, when we part ways, a part of me wishes you'd linger. You're braver than me in all ways and scenarios, and so part of me wishes you'd reach. Sometimes I think I see it in you; the same ache that I feel inside me. I don't know if it's there or if I just wish it was, but I wish you'd to be braver than I am. 

I wish you'd reach for me and hold me close before leaving, and tell me you wish we could stay. I wish you'd tell me that your heart holds space for me, in the way that mine does for you. I wish you'd entangle your fingers with mine, kiss my forehead and say that everything - even us - will remain unbroken. 

But I'll say nothing about any of it. I'll keep it all in. I'm not brave enough to risk losing you early. Better to bear it and enjoy you this way as the one man that can still make me smile. 

I just can't help but fear somehow you're feeling it too. The pain, the worry, and doubt. You're so like myself and you aren't likely to reach without first feeling sure of my actions. If you're mired this way right along with me, you'll be needing my bravery just as much. 

But my spirit is smaller than yours and my self doubt far greater. I really don't think I can be first. I'm not sure I can ever be that brave, not even for you, so for now I'll keep it safely inside.

I'll see you soon and I really can't wait to see your smile, hear your voice, and feel your presence. The coffee will taste good but it won't even come close the sound of your laugh, your kind face, and your essence. Hug me please, before we part ways, and tell me you've missed me when I arrive. 

Because I've missed you. And when we part I'll miss you again. Deeply, in a way where my soul cries. 

Yours,
