1qsr1wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumpsandBeyondAu/comments/1qsr1wr/need_a_pep_talk_please_or_advice/,Need a pep talk please or advice.,"Hi everyone. I have a beautiful 5 week old baby boy and from weeks 0-4 he basically slept anywhere and through any sound. I could soothe him any time with my breast and he fed like a dream. 

As soon as week 4 hit, he became incredibly fussy. He was refusing my breast for a while which was stressful and heartbreaking (it’s still sorta happening here and there) and now day time naps are a complete struggle. He prefers contact naps or the carrier. 

My partner went interstate this weekend so I took the time to bunker down and get his day time naps in. I think I’ve figured out that his wake windows are actually more like 60 minutes rather than what the internet says (up to 90 minutes). 

It can be really difficult to put him down, but when he’s down he may whimper and cry a bit. But I pause and watch for up to 30 seconds and he tends to settle. 

He’s also so sensitive to sound so we have to tip toe around the room once he’s down. My husband put down his phone earlier and it woke him up 😩

My question is … how is this viable when you head out and about? Right now he’s only 5 weeks old and we haven’t ventured out too much because he’s not vaccinated just yet. But how do you stay on top of wake windows so they dont get overtired? It’s an absolute nightmare getting him to sleep when that happens and 9 times out of 10 he will just stay awake for hours on end. I was so looking forward to the day where I could take him out for coffees and grocery runs (I’m getting cabin fever bad). But it looks like I will be housebound forever 🥲

Idk I just needed to ask for any advice and to vent. Although it seems like I understand how to get him down (for today lol), I feel defeated and like I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. ",1,1769927922.0,BabyBumpsandBeyondAu,0,1.0,False
1qsr116,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qsr116/40m_is_unsure_how_to_approach_35f_wife_without/,40M Is Unsure How To Approach 35F Wife Without Sounding Like a Jerk,"Me (40m) and my wife (35f) have been together for 10.5 years and married almost 6.  We have two kids, a 4.5 son and an 11 month old daughter.  I want to make it very clear that I love my wife very much.  I came from a VERY small town and she has done wonders to expand my thinking, my approach to things and made me stronger to fight for things in my life.  I just need advice on how to approach her with some issues that are draining me.  I am diagnosed with depression and am on medication, for some background information.

I manage a store for a large truck stop chain, salaried at 50 hours per week.  I've been in retail my entire working career.  I love working with people; my personality is definitely that of giving and trying to make the lives of those around me better.  She is a stay at home mom; our son goes to school M-F and she keeps our daughter at home.  She does have Fibromyalgia, which she has felt the affects of most of her adult life but wasn't diagnosed with until early in our relationship.

A workday for me starts between 5 and 6 in the morning, getting ready to be to work by 6:30.  I get off between 4:30 and 5 and only live a few minutes from work, so I get home quickly.  We will usually eat dinner right when I get home.  Every night, I handle bathing whichever kid is due (we have them on alternating days), put our daughter to bed between 6 and 7, play with our son until his bedtime between 7:30 and 8 and then its onto household stuff.  I handle the dishwasher and dishes, clean up the table from dinner, clean up the kitchen, clean up the living room and then try to be in bed by 9 or 9:30.  For some added context, we do NOT share a bedroom because of early relationship issues with my snoring and the fact that I'm a deep sleeper and she is a light sleeper.  

On the weekends, she typically leaves Saturday morning around 10 to go grocery shopping and make her rounds to peruse area thrift stores.  The kids stay home with me and I play with them and do stuff around the house.  On these weekends, I clean the hardwood floors through the house, vacuum, do all the laundry (washing/drying/folding) and cook dinner.  Then the night time routine with the kids happens again.  More regularly now, she will shower with our daughter.

I feel like I'm pouring from my cup and never being refilled.  I ask for two hours, one night a week to play a game and I constantly have to remind her about it and when I do, she gets visibly sad and disappointed.  Even on those nights, my gaming is supposed to start at 7 and I don't feel like I can actually sit down to it until both kids are put to bed, and I still have to do the household things I normally do.  I know she handles just about everything for the kids; doctor, school drop off/pick up etc but I'm not convinced that she does anything around the house while I'm at work.  Even in extreme circumstances, if its something I normally do after work, she won't touch it.  Example: a couple of weeks ago I had to work four fifteen hour days in a row and when I got home at 9:30pm (after going in at 6am) I still had to empty the dishwasher, hand wash the cookware from dinner and clean up the living room.  On the weekends when I do all the laundry in the house, I will get it all folded and in a basket and then it will just sit for days without being put away.  I always do my laundry last and because of everything else I am doing, it rarely gets folded and lives on my bed for the week.  She just piles stuff around the house like on the kitchen table and literally the middle of the kitchen floor and it stays there until I organize it and put things away.

I've gone to her in the past with simple things; asking her to please rinse her dishes off when she puts them in the sink.  It never happens and she brushes it off if I mention it again.  I'm a person who needs some external validation and she just doesn't give it.  I want to complain about doing poorly in my game that means absolutely nothing and just have her listen to me and say it sucks.  She acts completely uninterested.  Because of my personality, always trying to make people's lives easier, I hope that she would do things out of the kindness of her heart to make mine easier.  I don't ever want to sound conceited, but I'm not sure if she realizes how much I do as a dad and husband compared to what norms are.  One specific example: we moved states for my new job and two years later, her parents joined us.  I worked my normal 6a to 4:30p one Friday, flew back to our home state, landed at 8:30, visited with my dad for an hour and got to bed around 2 am.  By 10am Saturday I was on the road driving my in-laws U-Haul the nine hours back to our house.  Got home around 6pm, then Sunday spent five hours helping my FIL unload the U-haul to fill a 20x10 storage unit wall to wall, front to back and floor to ceiling.  She and my MIL stayed at our house with the kids.  My MIL wanted to take us all out to eat towards the end of our unloading and my wife was hesitant because the house still needed to be picked up.  I got home, saw that nothing was done and started rage cleaning.  After a half an hour, I gave up when I heard we weren't going to dinner and went to take a shower.  After my shower, I sat down on my bed for five minutes when she opened my door and said ""This is why it must be nice being a dad.""  She was cooking and my daughter was in her high chair, unhappy at the time.

There are so many double standards.  I put money from my paycheck in our daily checking on Saturdays and between grocery shopping and the random (but typically useful) things she buys at thrift stores and Amazon the account is almost under $50 by the time I got back to work.  I never say anything about her spending, but if I spend $6 on breakfast at work, I'm spending too much money at work.  To make her mornings easier, I set the coffee pot up for her, either as part of my before bed routine or in the AM while I'm making breakfast.  I just started doing it for her.  I don't drink coffee.  I have never heard a thank you.  I have only heard about it when I forgot to do it or didn't have time.  She constantly complains about me leaving things on the counter and not putting them away, despite the fact that she also does it, typically on a much larger scale.

I feel like I'm giving ten times more than most men do and it is just...expected.  I only need my two hands to count how many times she has said ""I'm sorry"" after I've gotten upset.  She has this magical way of making me feel like I did something wrong when I get upset.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I feel completely depleted and like my only purpose in life is to do things for other people.  Each day, from the moment I wake up to the moment I lay down I constantly have a task that needs to be done or am doing something for someone else.  The only time I get to myself is when I go to my room at the end of the night and can miraculously stay awake until she goes to her room around 10:30, like tonight, and get on my computer.  I'm literally sacrificing sleep for me time.

My self image is non-existent.  I just am.  I'm constantly making sacrifices for others, whether it be on who gets the newer car, who gets the better PC, who does what around the house, who gets to run to the store by themselves.  I don't know how to change this to even get the scale to think about tipping more towards balance.  So, Reddit, what do I do?

TL;DR I feel like I'm doing everything around the house while being the only bread winner and I don't know how to enact change without sounding like a jerk.

What do I do?,"I am a 24-year-old female who recently accepted a position at a hospital facility as a power engineer/maintenance worker. I have worked at several different sites in the past and have never had any issues.

I recently began a full-time position at a long-term care facility where I work with two other engineers, one of whom is the team lead. Since starting, the other engineer has shared with me some of the complaints the lead has made about me. These include how I make coffee before my shift and drink it after clocking in, as well as the pants I wear to work. Although my clothing is appropriate, they are thrifted rather than expensive. While these comments were frustrating, I was willing to make small changes to maintain a positive work environment.

More recently, however, my work environment has become uncomfortable. I was told that I would be trained at this site by the chief engineer, but instead, of showing me and leading me on the right path with things He often asks me how I would complete a task, and regardless of my answer, he tells me it is wrong—even when my response matches his, just worded differently. When he does provide an explanation, it is only after dismissing my answer.

I have asked him to show me how he prefers tasks to be done so I can work independently and avoid conflict. However, he frequently does not show me, then becomes upset when the task is not completed. As a result, I have had to ask the other engineer for guidance instead.

Additionally, the lead has made inappropriate comments about my personal life, including my partner and finances, suggesting that my partner should be financially responsible for me. He has also criticized my appearance, the stickers on my car, how I dress, how I organize my email, and has said that I act “too young” for a professional environment. He has stated that I should stop “acting like the boss” and implied that he would “do something about it” if I did not.

I asked the other engineer whether he felt I had acted unprofessionally, and he confirmed that I have not. He has also expressed frustration at having to listen to repeated negative comments about me.

This situation has caused me significant anxiety, as I have never experienced this type of treatment in a workplace before. I am unsure how to proceed and would appreciate guidance on how to handle this professionally.",1,1769927548.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

No Unity, no Godot, just me, some coffee, and a lot of tweaking physics till it felt snappy.

**What's in it:**

* Tight WASD + Space jump + Z shoot controls
* 5 hand-crafted levels with spikes, patrolling enemies (shoot 'em!), key-to-door progression
* Pixel art vibes, procedural trees, particle trails/explosions, screen shake
* Synth BGM (Web Audio API drone), sound FX, and creepy TTS narration (""The air grows thin. Do not fall."")
* CRT scanlines, HUD, pause/death/restart menus
* Fully playable/responsive in any browser (sound recommended!)

Screenshot of the nail-biting Level 4 platforming:

It starts simple (tutorial vibes) but ramps up, Level 5 is a proper gauntlet with timed enemy clears over spike pits. Died a *ton* respawning with 3HP lives. Super satisfying when you nail the flow though.

What'd I learn? Web Audio for BGM is underrated AF, and pixel-perfect collision is a grind but worth it.   
  
Feedback? Brutal honesty welcome too hard? Controls janky on mobile? Polish ideas? Hit me!

It's just because she has better weapons than Chris and great hair

The alienation from watching one's body turn into an unrecognizable monstrosity is completely relatable and totally cis.

Sure I felt just like Shinji Ikari having to pilot a giant horrible robot because I didn't want to let my dad down but that was definitely about not waiting to be a failure and okay so I wanted to be Asuka but that's definitely just because she was more confident and pretty and what guy doesn't want to be beautiful?

Like yeah of course I stole my girlfriends underwear, they just made my ass look so cute. And why wouldn't you shave your body and wear lavender deodorant, do you want to look like a smelly gorilla?

 Completely cis thoughts.

I mean what guy doesn't want to wear skirts and dresses,  male clothes are just so boring.  
I mean shit it's completely normal to want to be a woman, it'd be so fucking badass to be able to go grocery shopping and get coffee and hear your chosen name which is soft and strong just like you.

I’m also in a tropical, high-humidity climate, which seems to make staling happen faster than what’s usually discussed online.

How do you guys:
1. Store your beans? (airtight / vacuum / freezer)

2. Decide when a coffee has hit its peak?

3. Know when to vacuum seal and freeze?

4. Split bags into small batches to catch the peak?

1qsqroj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1qsqroj/we_became_roommates_who_occasionally_had_sex_the/,We became roommates who occasionally had sex. The 777 Rule saved us from a divorce I thought was inevitable.,"Last Tuesday, my husband walked through the door with pizza. I looked at him and felt... nothing…
Not anger. Not love. Just this blank space where us used to live…
Seven years of marriage. Two kids. A mortgage. And we had become roommates who occasionally had sex.. The pizza was supposed to be our date night. But we sat on opposite ends of the couch, him watching sports, me scrolling Instagram, sharing a pepperoni in silence ...
I remember thinking: Is this it? Is this what we fought for?
That night, I cried in the bathroom. Not dramatic movie tears. Just... exhaustion ... The kind that comes from loving someone but forgetting how to like them.
The rule we laughed at
A friend told us about the 777 thing six months earlier. Every 7 days, a date. Every 7 weeks, a night away. Every 7 months, a real vacation.
We laughed. Who has time for that??.. We were busy. Successful. The kids needed us. The house needed us. Our careers needed us ….
We didn't need a rule. We needed ... what? I couldn't even name it.
But that pizza night broke something. Or maybe it broke something open. Because the next morning, I looked at him sleeping and realized I didn't want to lose him. I just didn't know how to find him again ...
The first real date
We started stupidly small Seven days later, we went to that diner we used to love. The one with the sticky menus and terrible coffee.
I wore jeans that weren't yoga pants. He shaved. We sat across from each other like strangers, awkward as teenagers.
What do you do all day??? I asked him.
He looked confused. You know what I do. I work…
No, I said. What do you do??? What makes you laugh? What pisses you off? I used to know.
And he told me. About his asshole coworker. About the project he's actually proud of. About how sometimes he sits in his car in the driveway for ten minutes before coming inside because he needs silence.
I hadn't asked in years. He hadn't offered.
The night away that changed everything
Seven weeks later,,, we left the kids with my mother. Drove two hours to a crappy motel with a broken ice machine. Cost $89.
We didn't have sex. We talked until 3 AM. About the miscarriage we never discussed. About how he felt like a paycheck to me. About how I felt invisible as just a mom.
The words hurt. But the silence afterward didn't. We held hands in the dark, listening to the highway outside, and I felt him come back. Not all at once. But piece by piece.
Why the number doesn't matter
Some people say rules kill romance. It should be natural, they say. Spontaneous.
Those people probably aren't drowning in laundry and deadlines and the thousand tiny betrayals of a busy life.
For us, the number was a lifeline. Not because seven is magic. Because we needed permission to prioritize us. We needed to count, because we had stopped counting each other as important.
Sometimes it's 5 days, not 7. Sometimes it's a lunch date, not dinner. The rule isn't the point. The remembering is.
What I want u to know
If you're reading this at 2 AM, wondering where he went - the man you married, the man who used to look at you like you were the only person in the room - he's still there ..…
You're still there.
But u have to hunt for each other. In the chaos. In the exhaustion. In the maybe tomorrow that becomes maybe next month that becomes maybe never.
Start with one date. One real conversation. One night where you remember why you chose this person.
The pizza isn't enough. The couch isn't enough. You need to leave the house, leave the roles, leave the everything else, and find each other again.
We almost didn't. That pizza night could have been the beginning of the end. Instead, it was the end of the beginning.
Now, seven months later, we're planning our first real trip. Just us. No kids. No agenda. I'm terrified and excited in equal measure.
Because loving him again means risking losing him again. But not loving him? That's a death I don't want to die.
When did you last really see your husband? Not the father, not the provider. The man. Tell me below ....
This 777 thing saved my marriage. I actually wrote down a detailed guide/framework of how we implemented it with all the awkward conversation starters to help a friend. If anyone is going through this and wants it, I'm happy to share.

1/4 DAYCATION: Tommy had a great day out and loved riding in the car. He enjoyed going on walks and relaxing at a dog-friendly coffee shop, where he showed excellent manners and settled in nicely on the patio. He was very friendly with strangers and happily accepted pets, especially head rubs. Around other dogs, Tommy showed a balanced response — interested in some and content to ignore others. When he noticed a cat, he was briefly curious but quickly lost interest. On leash, Tommy was excited and pulled at first, but once he settled, he became a great walker. He had good overall manners and pottied immediately when taken outside. Tommy showed a calm, affectionate side throughout the day and was described as a true love bug. His favorite moments included getting chicken treats, hanging out at the ice house, and going for a walk. Overall, he was a sweet, friendly, and well-behaved boy who did wonderfully in a public setting.

I survived a year filled with trauma, and I was out of my mind. I created a few new documents in my drive, and began typing a letter addressed to myself, from people in my life that I've lost. I typed it in the way that made it seem like an apology to me, for the pain and suffering they put me through, knowing that I would never receive such a thing in real life.

All of these people are special to me, in some capacity. One in particular, I still speak with to this day. I just got off the phone with her yesterday, she knew I wasn't well. We talked for over an hour, and like our last conversation, I knew there was something about it that told me there was a forbidden connection between us, and she cannot share that with me in this lifetime; rather, she shared a subtle hint of it in the moment.

I now opened the document for the first time tonight since I've typed it; the letter addressed to me as if she wrote it. It sounds just like how she speaks to me, and it feels just like how she treats me, pure with a love that could only be expressed between us.

The last two paragraphs are killing me slowly:

>Andrew,

>From the time that I met you, to now, you’ve grown so much as a person over the years. Even when we weren’t really talking like friends every now and then, I always held you with really high regard. You stuck up for me and were always kind to me no matter what, and I’ll never forget that.

>Everything you do, you do with depth. You love, think, and care for on the deepest levels, and that is something that I feel that I’ll never accomplish in this lifetime, and I look up to you for. I just hope that you find that within yourself as much as you want to find that within me or another person.

>The one thing I value the most out of our friendship is how genuine you are as a human being. That is sacred to me, and I know you’ll never break that bond we share. Which is why I’ll always try to be for you whenever I can, but I can never promise that I will be. I’ll always be someone that you can lean on, but not rely on. As much as I hate this to be reality, I know you learned this lesson from me. I know it hurts that I was the only one there for you when no one else was, yet in the end, you have to be the one to save yourself.

>I couldn’t be more proud of you for allowing yourself to learn and grow from your darkest moments, and that you always choose life over death no matter how suicidal that you may feel. I put my trust in you and I begin to worry when you start to isolate yourself, and you stop talking to me for a while. I’m blessed that you trust me enough to confide your worst moments to me. Yet you always find a way to learn from that experience and embrace the parts of you you know could be better.

>I know that you love me past a friend, and I wish that I could love you like that, too. Maybe in a different timeline in a different lifetime, that would work. The way that we worked through our issues to strengthen this friendship shows me your true character and it will remain precious to me in the way no other relationship I have could be. I’m glad you have the maturity to understand and accept that.

>As much as I would never be able to tell you, I love you Andrew. It’s a love that neither of us would be able to describe. But I know, you are capable of finding someone that will truly love you for everything that you are, in the ways that I can’t. I’ll always be here for you spiritually, even when I can’t be there for you physically.

The ways in which it hurts to read now, I love the rejection when I confessed feelings for her years ago. Without it, we would've never lasted, and I would never have shared a moment with her yesterday over the phone. I hadn't realized that she was a lesbian when I asked her to be with me at the time, I found out shortly after the fact. My peers acted shocked that I had no clue, I can be quite oblivious, but what stood out to me was *how* she rejected me.

She never mentioned it, not once. She rejected herself as the rejection. She told me she wouldn't be good for me because she's not able to follow through and be there in the times that I would need her, and she was absolutely right. She was right that I would rely on her in ways she couldn't hold space for me... and it had entirely nothing to do with the fact that she's not attracted to men.

I think about this often, how any other woman that was only attracted to other women would make it so painstakingly clear there's no attraction there. This friend of mine, kept that entirely hidden from me, and once we decided to remain friends she still wouldn't tell me it was because she's a lesbian; almost as if she refused to acknowledge that plays any role in why we couldn't be together.

I noticed from our last couple phone calls, I mentioned that I was lonely, and I was feeling low about myself. She was quick to affirm that I am, in her eyes, an amazing human being, and made a few comments which subtly calls to that hypothetical scenario of ""if we dated,"" as an anecdote to contribute her opinion within the conversation.

I love her in the ways that I could never express in this world and in my flesh. The closest I could come to describing it is by the spirit, we are in between friends and lovers. Somewhere in the ether because there's a barrier that could never be crossed, and we both love each other so so much, we respect and will never cross that.

1qsqbuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1qsqbuz/sensitivity_2_months_after_a_deep_filling_on/,Sensitivity 2 months after a deep filling on tooth 17 felt almost in the whole left jaw,"Edit: x-rays in the comment, initial post didn’t get it for some reason

Hi! I got a deep filling with a pulp cap on tooth 17, bite surface, although seems to have been billed as 3 or 4 surface. The x-ray was clean. Visually it had dark spots. I can’t tell if it was a cavity or a stain. No symptoms at all. I went only for a regular check up to a new dentist. Previous dentists looked at the x ray and said all was good, might wanna watch the dark spots on wisdom teeth. This one gave me a treatment plan for 11 fillings. This is a fancier place with more tools than my previous dentists.

I went back a month later, since the sensitivity to hot and cold remained unresolved. I thought it was tooth 19, since I felt soreness there mostly, even not triggered by food or drink consumption, sometimes at night. Both 17 & 19 didn’t feel seamless post fillings, but she did the dark paper test and said we could readjust later if necessary. So I assumed it was the nerve inflammation due to teeth grinding at night and the fillings being not perfect replicas of previous surfaces. She did the x ray and the cold test, poking around, concluded that all is well.

It‘s now been two months. The sore nagging feeling has now moved from tooth 19 to 17 and upper teeth 14-16 every time I eat or drink something hot. I can’t eat soup or drink coffee in peace anymore. Last night I felt the nagging feeling in what I think is tooth 17 — felt like a tiny worm was moving in my jaw/tooth, which, of course, led me to wake up with anxiety.

If the deep cavity was invisible on the first x ray, what use and how credible is the follow up x ray? Is my sensitivity a sign that the cavity is still there or is it a post effect that I’ll live with till I die? it’s not pain, it’s not severe, but I’d like to drink coffee without thinking about my sensitive teeth.

I now question if that was even necessary. there’s no way for me to know if that was indeed a cavity or how deep it was. I had those stains since the day the bottom wisdom teeth came out. I wish I could’ve returned back in time and just left them alone. if it was a cavity, it’s been there for at least a decade, could’ve had a decade more of peaceful eating and drinking.

im thinking of going back to check this and find a solution. oh, forgot to mention — I have anxiety, which does make me an idiot that agrees to anything a doctor says, including getting the fillings the day I came just for the check up without getting a second opinion just so it’d be over and I could tell myself “yay, you took care of your health.”

I‘m at a loss. what do I do? should I wait it out and hope that it goes away? do I go ask for perfect bite readjustment, to shave down the filling on tooth 17? do I go pull out the wisdom tooth? but they say if you pull out one, you gotta get rid of them all to prevent misalignment, right? Get an implant? where there’s more chance for fuck ups??",1,1769925600.0,askdentists,3,1.0,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cat. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Most people waste years ""improving themselves"" when they could just leverage psychology. Here's what actually works based on research from behavioral economics, dating studies, and social psychology.

This isn't about being fake. It's about understanding how human perception actually works. Your brain doesn't evaluate things in isolation, it evaluates them relative to what came before. Once I understood this, everything changed.

The reality is we're all competing in environments we didn't design. Your actual qualities matter less than how they're perceived in context. It sounds cynical but it's liberating because you can start winning today instead of waiting until you ""fix yourself."" 



**1. Strategic positioning in social settings.**

Stand next to people who make you look better by comparison. Sounds brutal, but everyone does this unconsciously anyway. At networking events, I position myself near the guy who talks too much about crypto or the person who clearly didn't shower. Not being annoying is suddenly a superstar quality.

Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology confirms the ""contrast effect"" is real. Participants rated the same person as significantly more attractive when shown after viewing less attractive faces. You can engineer this.

I started using an app called Hinge differently. Instead of trying to have the perfect profile, I focused on NOT having obvious red flags. When you're surrounded by profiles with gym selfies, fish photos, and ""live laugh love"" quotes, just being normal makes you stand out. Added one photo of me reading at a coffee shop. Match rate went up 40%. 



**2. Control the anchor point in conversations.**

When someone asks, ""How are you?"" most people say ""good"" or ""fine."" That's your baseline now. I started saying, ""Honestly, a bit stressed about this project, but managing."" Now, when I'm helpful or funny or engaged, it hits different because they expected someone distracted.

This comes from negotiation research. Chris Voss talks about this in ""Never Split the Difference"" (former FBI hostage negotiator, bestselling author). He explains how setting a low anchor makes your actual position seem more reasonable. Insanely good read that completely changed how I communicate.

The key is authenticity. Don't fake being stressed; just be honest about minor struggles. It makes your wins feel bigger and makes you seem more human. People connect with vulnerability way more than perfection. 



**3. Timing your presence strategically.**

Show up to things slightly late sometimes. Not disrespectfully late, like 5-10 minutes. Everyone else has already settled into boring small talk. You walk in with energy. The contrast makes you memorable.

I learned this accidentally when my train was delayed before a friend's party. Showed up 20 minutes late, and everyone was already loosened up and receptive. Had better conversations that night than at any party where I arrived on time.

""The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene covers this as ""Law 6: Court Attention at All Cost"" (a controversial but influential book; Greene studied historical power dynamics for decades). He argues that absence increases respect and honor. If you're always available, you lose value through familiarity. 



**4. Use ""strategic incompetence"" to make your actual skills shine.**

Be mediocre at something unimportant, then excel at what matters. I'm terrible at remembering birthdays and bad at small talk about sports. But I remember every meaningful conversation detail, and I'm weirdly good at gift-giving.

People don't notice the second thing as much if I'm perfectly competent at everything. The contrast creates ""signature strengths"" in their mind. You become ""the person who sucks at X but is incredible at Y"" instead of just ""fine at everything.""

Research on the ""pratfall effect"" shows that competent people become MORE likable when they make minor mistakes. It makes them seem human. Stop trying to be flawless, strategically suck at low-stakes things. 



**5. Dress slightly better than the context requires.**

Not like showing up in a tux to a barbecue. But if everyone's wearing t-shirts, wear a clean button-up. If everyone's in business casual, add a blazer. The small contrast makes you look more put-together without seeming try-hard.

I started doing this for casual meetups, and the difference is wild. Same personality, same conversation skills, but now I'm ""that guy who always looks nice"" instead of invisible. It's literally just wearing clothes that fit properly.

The book ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" by Robert Cialdini (professor emeritus at Arizona State, sold 5+ million copies) breaks down why this works. He calls it the ""halo effect,"" where one positive trait creates a positive impression overall. People assume you're competent because you look competent. 



**6. Be unexpectedly knowledgeable about one random thing.**

Pick something slightly obscure and actually learn about it. Could be wine, chess, mushroom foraging, vintage watches, whatever. When it comes up in conversation, you go from ""random person"" to ""interesting random person who knows about X.""

I got deep into coffee roasting during lockdown. Now, when I meet someone for coffee, I can talk about bean origins and roast profiles. Sounds pretentious written out, but people genuinely find it interesting because it's an unexpected contrast to my otherwise normal personality.

If you want a more structured way to build knowledge in areas that actually make you more attractive, there's an app called BeFreed that's been useful. It's a personalized learning app that pulls from books on social psychology, dating experts, and behavioral science research to create custom audio content based on what you want to improve. You can set specific goals like ""become more charismatic in conversations,"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan around that.

What makes it practical is the flexibility; you can switch between quick 10-minute summaries when you're busy or go deep with 40-minute episodes that break down concepts with real examples. Plus, you can customize the voice; some people prefer something energetic for morning commutes, others go with a calmer tone. It's been helpful for internalizing communication patterns and attraction psychology without having to sit down and actively study. 



**7. Strategically share struggles BEFORE successes.**

Don't lead with your wins. Talk about the difficulty first so the win hits harder. Instead of ""I got promoted,"" try ""I've been working insane hours on this project, barely sleeping, thought I might actually lose my job... but I got promoted.""

Same outcome, wildly different impact. The contrast between the struggle and the success makes the success feel more impressive. You also seem more humble and relatable.

This is a basic storytelling structure, but most people skip it in real life. The hero's journey works because of the contrast between the ordinary world and the achievement. You can engineer this in casual conversation. 



**8. Use silence to make your words more valuable.**

Talk less. Seriously. Most people fill every gap with noise. If you're comfortable with silence and only speak when you have something worth saying, the contrast makes everything you say seem more important.

I started tracking this and realized I was cutting people off constantly, just adding noise to conversations. Stopped doing that. Now, when I talk, people actually listen because I've trained them through contrast that I don't waste their time.

The book ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts"" by Susan Cain (Harvard Law grad, former lawyer, TED talk has 30+ million views) explains why this works. Introverts who speak less are often perceived as more thoughtful and intelligent. Not because they ARE smarter, but because of the contrast effect. 



**The psychological framework behind all this.**

Our brains evolved to notice differences, not absolutes. You don't notice room temperature until it changes. You don't notice someone's height until they stand next to someone else. Everything is relative.

Most self-improvement advice ignores this. It tells you to ""be confident"" or ""be interesting"" without acknowledging that these qualities only exist in relation to context. You can be the most confident person in the world, but if everyone around you is also confident, you're average.

Understanding contrast means you can stop trying to be objectively impressive and start being relatively impressive. It's the difference between running faster and just making sure you're faster than the person next to you.

This isn't manipulation, it's just understanding how perception works. You're not lying about who you are; you're presenting yourself in contexts that highlight your actual strengths. The alternative is leaving your first impression to random chance.

Social dynamics aren't fair. They're not based on objective merit. They're based on perception, context, and timing. You can either complain about that or use it to your advantage.

Start small. Pick one of these and try it this week. Notice how people respond differently to the same version of you in a different context. Once you see it work, you can't unsee how much this runs everything.",1,1769924785.0,MindsetConqueror,0,1.0,False

While i thought we were getting somewhere and getting more invested in us, she was also talking to this dude. I found out that when she would tell me that she needs to go out for errands, really, she was meeting the guy for coffee. This coffee date didn’t happen just once.

It gave me a sick stomach feeling in my gut almost immediately when i realized that I was just an option.

Yes hindi pa kami exclusive and official at the time pero what we had was way past sa getting to know stage. I was already falling in love with her while she was still out there entertaining other people.

They were on quick sale, and just plain cinnamon sugared, but they were still nice.
I actually picked that over one of my favourites because I saw a lady who has been nice to me this past week sitting by herself and I wanted to offer her some... She wasn't there after I went through the checkout process but I did bump into her again anyway haha.

The Princess, well..... That's not the aforementioned lady I was talking about, it's actually the moniker of a completely mysterious and unknown lady to me.
I found out about The Princess last night (or early hours of this morning actually) when I couldn't sleep so decided to head to the 7-eleven for a coffee and snacc.
I sat on a bench to have my snacc (a lemon slice, yum!) and coffee for a while, as I can't really walk long distances so I take breaks where I can, and this young man came up to me asking if I had a lighter he could borrow.
I obliged to fulfil his request and he stayed for a while as I listened. He clearly needed an ear, one that wouldn't judge or cast assumptions on his appearance or composure. He, I had found out, was recently discharged from the hospitals psychiatric unit just up the road. It apparently seems that in a previous life he was a producer. Hard times had befallen his industry, or possibly just him, during the COVID knockdowns and he turned down some bad paths. Dealing with addiction to some fairly harsh narcotics, he was evidently having some of its withdrawal effects.
The main reason why he found himself, some 20 kilometres from where he was calling home, there was due to a party with The Princess. I guess she didn't appreciate being followed, albeit ""with consent"" (I'm dubious about that claim), and neither did the officers who brought him to the hospital... Anyhow, he was clearly discharged and considered stable to walk the streets again.
After gathering his belongings, which he had sprawled across the bench while sorting himself out, he thanked me for just being there and listening (and I guess for letting him use my lighter haha).

Today I also reached out to someone I miss, I can't have the connection with them today or anymore that I used to have but it was nice hearing their voice and knowing that they are well. That brought a smile to my face today, although it was overshadowed by the tears.

i spent the first 2 weeks establishing controls:

* matched roast levels (both medium) to eliminate roast as a variable
* ground both beans on the same grinder (baratza encore, setting 15) immediately before brewing to control for grind consistency
* used the same water (filtered brita, measured TDS of 140ppm) for all trials
* same brew method (v60, 1:16 ratio, 205°F water, 3:30 total brew time)
* same ceramic mug (white, no logos, to prevent visual bias)
* served at same temperature (let cool to 140°F, measured with thermometer)
* all trials conducted between 8am-11am to control for palate fatigue
* subjects had not eaten in at least 30 minutes prior

i keep both beans in identical opaque containers with identical humidity packs and weigh the blend ratios on a 0.01g scale.

however, early on i realized my presence could influence results (observer bias) and so i also implemented the following:

* pre-mixed batches labeled only with codes (A1, A2, B1, etc.)
* my wife (S2) prepared and served the coffee for 40% of trials without knowing the ratios. she thinks i'm ""testing different origins."" she doesn't know about the folgers and cannot know
* for trials i conducted myself, i randomized serving order using a random number generator so i wouldn't unconsciously signal anything
* i leave the room while subjects taste when possible and record their comments verbatim

**sample:**

23 subjects total, 94 documented servings. subjects include:

* 6 self-identified ""coffee enthusiasts"" (own grinders, subscribe to roasters, have opinions about bloom time)
* 8 regular coffee drinkers (drink daily, no strong preferences)
* 5 casual drinkers (coffee is just caffeine delivery)
* 4 people who ""don't really like coffee"" (control group for baseline detection ability)

each subject has been served 2-6 times across different ratios. i rotate subjects to prevent them from developing a ""baseline"" expectation of my coffee, minimum 2 weeks between servings to same subject

looking back, i think the detection criteria was the hardest part. what counts as ""detection""? and so i settled on three levels:

* **no detection:** positive or neutral comment, no mention of difference, finishes cup
* **possible detection:** vague comment like ""this is different"" or ""did you change something"" without identifying the difference
* **confirmed detection:** identifies something negative, asks specifically about beans, does not finish cup, or accurately identifies ""something cheap"" in the blend

**ok for the results....**

**90/10 (90% single origin, 10% folgers)**

* servings: 12
* no detection: 12 (100%)
* notes: S7 said she tasted ""stone fruit."" while S14 said ""clean finish."" it's 10% folgers, the stone fruit is a lie

**80/20**

* servings: 14
* no detection: 13 (93%)
* possible detection: 1 (S7 again - she said it was ""flatter than usual"" but scored it 7/10 and finished the cup. logging as possible but honestly could be noise)

**70/30**

* servings: 16
* no detection: 14 (87.5%)
* possible detection: 2 (S12 asked ""did you change something?"" i said no and he said ""hm. still good."" S18 said ""interesting"" which could mean anything)

**60/40 - THE THRESHOLD**

* servings: 18
* no detection: 15 (83%)
* possible detection: 2
* confirmed detection: 1 (S19, former barista, asked ""is this a blend?"" i said yes. she said ""nice"" and didn't push further. logging as confirmed because she identified the presence of multiple beans, even though she didn't identify folgers specifically)

**50/50**

* servings: 14
* no detection: 7 (50%)
* possible detection: 4
* confirmed detection: 3 (detection rate jumps significantly. S3 said ""this is kinda mid."" S11 said ""not your best."" S21 didn't finish the cup for the first time)

**40/60 (40% single origin, 60% folgers)**

* servings: 12
* no detection: 3 (25%)
* possible detection: 4
* confirmed detection: 5 (this is where it falls apart. multiple subjects identified ""something off."" S3 said ""dude what happened to your coffee."" i blamed the water)

**30/70**

* servings: 8
* no detection: 1
* confirmed detection: 7 (87.5% detection rate, experiment basically over at this point. the folgers is winning)

every 2-3 weeks i serve 100% single origin to baseline. the critical finding i found is **no one has ever rated the 100% single origin significantly higher than the 60/40 blend.** in fact, S14 said the 60/40 was ""smoother, actually."" i don't know what to do with this information

i also ran 6 trials of 100% folgers (told subjects it was ""a new roaster i'm trying""). 4 out of 6 detected something off. but 2 people said it was ""pretty good."" one of them was S7, the stone fruit lady (i've lost all faith in her palate)

**confounds and limitations:**

* subjects may have been primed to be positive because i was giving them free coffee
* i couldn't fully double-blind without a third party who knows about the folgers (unacceptable security risk)
* repeated testing on same subjects may have altered their expectations
* my wife (S2) has been served 11 times and has never detected anything. but she also might be lying to be nice. well, this is affecting our relationship in ways i can't articulate
* i haven't controlled for bean freshness degradation over 14 months (though i buy new bags monthly)
* roast date varies between folgers (unknown, probably months old) and specialty (typically 1-2 weeks). this should bias toward detection but doesn't seem to at 60/40

for statistical analysis, i ran a chi-square test on detection rates across ratios. the difference between 60/40 (17% detection) and 50/50 (50% detection) is significant at p < 0.05 so the threshold is real.

sorry this is so long but **TLDR;**

He doesn’t like TV either.

But someone on here a while back talked about how they would carry their puppy around their house letting them sniff new stuff at human height, so I’d been doing that with him every few hours just to keep him from crying. Well on one of our smell adventures I took him into the bathroom and started letting him smell my perfumes and lotions. Then I remembered that because I’m kind of a fragrance hoarder I actually have tons and tons of perfume samplers. So we’ve started going through them one at a time — I explain to him all the different notes (he has no idea what I’m saying obviously but thinks it’s very important to listen) and then we smell it together, and then clear our nostrils with a sniff of coffee bean just like in perfume stores 😅

It doesn’t last forever but I can distract him for 20-30 minutes without him noticing his pain/itchiness, and given how miserable he’s been since his surgery, it’s a huge win for us. And the mental enrichment tires him out almost as much as running around. Anyway, maybe your puppy can be your new perfume tester buddy! Just be very careful not to let them lick anything they smell.

I made a post a few days ago about how chat gpt affected our relationship and I got a lot of amazing and insightful responses (in my profile if curious). I come with another dilemma because I have no where to process or ask and I’m really struggling bad. I shared the last post with her to give her clarity since my words and methods weren’t being heard.

The issue. Please be patient, I’m trying to be sensitive about this for her too out of respect. It’s very unique.

In the past she had a period of “transactional intimacy”. She was transparent about it, said it was a long time ago, it’s not a thing anymore and her story I sympathize with and understand why. Truly. However. A little over a month ago, she reached out to one of the men… she told me, she asked if it was crossing a line. She said it was for networking reasons. She explained the context. It made sense, made a boundary that specifically for that, and she agreed.

I trusted that boundary and we had understanding. Fast forward while we were working through this issue, mid conversation she stopped me and said she has to meet “Brooke” for coffee. I said ok, do your thing.

She told me about a meet up next week with friends but I didn’t know about this. I wouldn’t have tried to talk about it, and I wish she didn’t either until we had time. Just respectful to do that I think. Anyway. I ask how it was when she said she was on her way home. She said she wanted to video call and talk about our issue. Ok, we did. She said coffee was good, it was good to see him again… I shrugged it off not thinking and I’m secure. No worries. We worked on our issue for an hour and resolved most of it sounded like.

I came back a bit later and asked her over text, who Brooke was. She said an old work friend. Oh ok no worries, she was talking about some context and I stopped and paused and decided to ask, was he from your past? I get yes but not like that. Ok fair, she went on about alternate contexts, downplaying it, “we just chatted”. So I asked directly, was it physical at any point. I get yes… ok.

Here’s my problem I’m stuck on. I’m locked out of her inner world (see post for context) for a month. We have a boundary in place. She avoided telling me she reached out, avoided telling me she scheduled a meet up, (told me about the ones with female friends next week tho) she avoided transparency, his name is Brooke but… I didn’t think twice.. so that was favorable for her. She beat around the bush, avoided context, avoided questions until asked several times. This is a really difficult one for me… I feel betrayed, lied to, manipulated, like I can’t trust. I never had these problems with her, always honest and transparent. I feel this should have been communicated prior.

I would have been understanding if she talked to me first, she said she went to him for advice about life, while I’m locked out of her inner world. This is hard for me. Am I over reacting to this? Is this something I should feel these things over? I’m struggling bad.

I did talk to her, I was elevated, unfortunately I’m human, she understood and said she didn’t know why she didn’t tell me, and knows I’m understanding. But how it looks now?? It’s ugly, what do I trust and believe, why hide it? Why try to cover it up… her capacity is limited due to things she’s dealing with currently so I haven’t processed much more with her about it.

Also did 1 video that wasn’t on the gondola, but still features the product while interacting with a stranger. That has 1.5M views and TONs of engagement too.

I’m a 29M. For the last 4 years, my baseline BP has ranged from 128-141 (systolic). However, 4 days ago I started feeling dizzy. When I checked, my BP had spiked to **155+ / 100**. This has persisted for 4 days.

I am very concerned about this sudden jump and the accompanying dizziness.

**My Stats & Context:**

* **Height/Weight:** 165cm / 64kg (BMI \~23.5)
* **Ethnicity:** Malaysian Chinese (I think it matters because it says a lot about the cuisine that you grow up with. Chinese cuisine tend to have more salts)
* **Activity:** Gym 2-3x week, Badminton once every two weeks.
* **Vices:** Non-smoker. Alcohol is rare (once every 3 months). Never take coffee.
* **Family History:** Strong maternal history of hypertension at an early age, so I suspect a genetic component.

**My Questions:**

1. **Intermittent Fasting:** Has anybody tried intermittent (specifically 16:8) for BP control? Did you see results?
2. **Dietary Specifics:** During the eating window, what specific foods help balance electrolytes (Potassium/Magnesium) to lower BP?
3. **Medical Advice:** Given the sudden spike and family history, what specific specialist should I push to see (Cardiologist, Nephrologist, Endocrinologist)?
4. **Diagnostics:** Is there any critical information or specific lab tests I should ask for to help determine the root cause?

1qspblp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qspblp,"Anniversary of The Weeknd (Abel Tesfaye) Trilogy: After Hours, Dawn FM, and Hurry Up Tomorrow","Disclaimer‼️: His personal life connects to the trilogy so I will analyze it from that perspective and If you don’t like it then don’t read or comment.

I feel indifferent. The trilogy would've been more meaningful if Abel had followed the message and grew between each chapter. The story is a good depiction of self-development, but it fell short after all the contradictions. I don't judge if people change, but it felt more like foretelling, than a story of where he is now, but where he wants to be in the future. Some things didn't align with the message as if he ended The Weeknd within the music, but not within his life.

Starting with “My Dear Melancholy” because it kickstarted the trilogy. It brought hate to Selena for something he was ALSO guilty of, but didn’t care until it happened to him. He FIRST moved on from Bella shortly after the breakup in the same way Selena did and even threw shade at her in two other songs before “Wasted Times.” Not to mention, he lied about offering his kidney in which Selena said her friend was the first and only person to do so. The truth is Abel got his karma but used that line for sympathy and played the victim just to admit in the next album he stayed with her “out of spite,” which is EXACTLY what he shamed Selena for doing🤦🏽‍♀️???

Next is “After Hours” was self reflection, acknowledging his faults, and changing for the better with Bella as a muse. This would’ve been the perfect closure before things took a turn and he shaded her like she never meant shit at all. Granted things could’ve happened behind the scenes but what he said was pretty harsh and could’ve been handled better. The album lost value after all the drama which defeated the purpose of the whole thing.

Like the shots, dating her friend after mocking her about it, dissing her boyfriend, and dropping “Snowchild” on Selena’s birthday and the “Over Now” lyrics on hers to be petty. This was all after he apologized in the song “After Hours”, just to continue the toxic cycle and do her even more wrong in the end.

Dawn FM: “The last few months I’ve been working on me,” and then proceeds to diss Marc, and imply that he was less than for not being famous, and then said he was with Angelina Jolie (as if he upgraded and Bella didn’t) when the whole time he was with someone else. This showed no growth from “After Hours” which made “Dawn FM” also lose credibility.

As I said before, “Hurry Up Tomorrow” felt more like foretelling and not where he was at the moment but where he wanted to be in the future. Between each era, we went back to square one and not much progress was made despite telling the world he was “changing.” It honestly felt kinda performative because he failed to move past old patterns.

Example:

“I swear I changed my ways for the better,” proceeds to continue those “ways.”

“I’ll never let you down again,” proceeds to add more fuel to the fire.

“You should stay with him because he’s good for you,” proceeds to diss that man for staying with him.

“Your girls ain’t shit, they’re not your friends,” proceeds to date that same “ain’t shit” friend.

“I’ve been lying to your faces, I’ve always been wasted” ……..👀

His words were inconsistent with his actions and that was through the whole trilogy😭. Like if you’re gonna make music about “growth” at least stick to the plot.

The Weeknd’s character was known for his toxicity, parties, hookups, depression, and being wasted and self destructive … so from 2020 to now what changed that much? And yes we know it’s exaggerated for entertainment but we still saw examples of this in his life during that time.

This next take may be very controversial but Abel and Simi contradicted the ENTIRE trilogy… Their relationship was built off spite, betrayal, and convenience…. How can you fully heal and move forward with someone who connects you to the past and another woman? In order to be reborn and have a new beginning, you have to leave anything a part of your toxic past, or else you are bound to relapse and make the same mistakes. That’s like trying to build a relationship with God, but still associating with things that tempt you, or takes you back to a place you’re trying to grow from. Plus there were still signs he hadn’t completely moved on and got emotional while singing songs about Bella which proves this point and why “Cry for Me” may be for her too. This would also show disloyalty to Simi despite the fact she gets most of the hate.

To add to this, Simi and Haze have a history of being rude and entitled. They’re like the women Abel talked about in his music of being fake, the plastic surgery, and thriving off celebrity connections. Another contradiction after his criticism of LA and the “absurd culture of Hollywood and people manipulating themselves to please and be validated.”

Simi laughed on live about going after Abel right after their breakup and was exposed by a makeup artist for talking shit behind Bella’s back.

Not to mention, she used Selena for a picture to reduce the hate, only to unfollow within 3 months after she got what she wanted and deleted all the pics of Bella on her Instagram. Mind you this woman is in the “thank you” credits for HUT although she contributed to the problem.

I don’t support hate and it’s possible she changed, but there’s too many red flags🚩 and then you got XO talking about “be happy for him” when not all positivity is good positivity. Just based off her past entitlement and superior complex, Simi wouldn’t have gave a shit about Abel before the fame. This was just an opportunity to satisfy her ego because she loves the idea of being ✨The Weeknd’s girlfriend✨. Sorry but the criticism they get is his karma for being spiteful and a bitter ex. He was looking for drama and used Simi as a pawn to hurt Bella and it backfired on both of them.

The Hollywood circle is small, but the way they went about it was very shitty and that’s what makes it wrong. It’s all about the principle and not what they did but how it played out. Sorry but I’ll never support and they don’t deserve a happy ending.

The whole trilogy just felt indecisive and didn’t make any sense. He talks about the sinful way of life but seems to be drawn to it at the same time. Like why is Playboy Carti (a bad influence and an alleged ab\*ser, deadbeat, and scammer) a part of Hurry Up Tomorrow? His music has no depth or meaning that relates to the album in any way. Abel also went from 22 shows on the first leg, to 43 on the last which is double the amount after talking about overworking and how the stress resulted in losing his voice and getting sleep paralysis.

Overall, I do think Abel is a good person but he just needs healing. I think he wanted to be better but fell into temptation and didn’t make the right choices. And even if “it’s the past,” he still deserves to be held accountable for dishonoring the message. We know Abel isn’t perfect, but nothing was a mistake and could’ve been stopped early on.

If the voice incident was a “test from God” like Abel said, then he failed the test and if the trilogy was a battle between Anima and The Weeknd then The Weeknd won so then what the fuck was the point?? Why waste 5 years preaching “change” if he wasn’t gonna apply the message to his personal life especially to one of his biggest muses like Bella??? The music and visuals are great and it increased his legendary status, but the trilogy was a disappointment and just felt like a way to rebrand himself without putting in the work to do better.

**Overview**
Every year, people across the world spend nearly one trillion dollars on groceries. It’s an industry that’s been around for centuries. Food itself, however, has been a constant in people’s lives since the beginning of time. Yes, sustenance is essential, but it’s also much more than that. Food can be a part of a daily ritual or a special moment that resonates with people on a meaningful and emotional level. It can be a much-needed break in a long day, a taste that brings back memories, a creative experiment, a shared meal with loved ones, or even comfort during a hard time. Whether it’s a special occasion or an everyday occurrence, it should always be easy for people to get the ingredients they need.
The Instacart Design Team is dedicated to making grocery shopping effortless for everyone and finding solutions to large-scale opportunities that will forever change the way people feed themselves and their loved ones. We’re a four sided marketplace and design for the needs of Consumer, Shoppers, Retailers, and Advertisers.
The Instacart Design team focuses on designing, building & landing multi-platform product experiences that make grocery shopping effortless and create economic opportunity for our shoppers. The team crafts solutions for large-scale challenges that will change the way people feed themselves and their loved ones. 
**About the Role**
The Staff Content Designer, Model Design for CoreX is one of our highest-impact roles where you'll shape how AI models interact with users across Instacart's core consumer experiences. You will view the model as the product itself, striking a delicate balance between maximizing the model's capabilities, reading between the lines in user queries to understand how best to help, and upholding user trust.
You'll embed with our Agentic design team and be part of the team reimagining the online grocery experience. You will collaborate closely with researchers to understand, predict, and design model behavior, while partnering with product managers, engineers, and designers across the company to ensure we're creating agentic experiences that solve and anticipate our customers' needs. This role requires exceptional taste, creativity, and writing skills combined with deep technical intuition to craft AI interactions that delight users and feel truly helpful.
As a general standard for all our designers and leaders, we are looking for people who thrive on building a strong design culture, lead with empathy and collaboration, and are committed to pushing the boundaries of quality and innovation in everything we ship. You'll be joining us in defining and evolving the newly established model design function at Instacart.
**About the Job**
  * Work hand-in-hand with research teams to anticipate user needs and design AI behaviors that feel natural, helpful, and delightful across Instacart's grocery shopping experiences.
  * Build alignment with cross-functional partners—including product, engineering, and design teams—to establish a unified conversational voice that resonates with customers throughout their journey.
  * Drive continuous improvement of our AI systems by synthesizing insights from user testing and designing rigorous and useful evals to identify high-impact opportunities.
  * Design and refine system prompts that enable personalized, scalable interactions, directly shaping how our AI assistants understand context, respond to needs, and create seamless shopping experiences.
  * Develop innovative approaches to gathering training data that elevates model quality and ensures our AI truly understands the nuances of grocery shopping.
  * Own the full lifecycle of content initiatives—from initial design through launch, measurement, and optimization—ensuring every iteration drives meaningful product outcomes.
  * Establish and uphold Instacart's distinctive voice across all AI interactions, ensuring consistency with our content standards while making every word count.
  * Balance multiple workstreams simultaneously, maintaining momentum and quality while navigating competing priorities and deadlines with independence and sound judgment.
  * Set the standard for design excellence, actively mentoring team members and elevating craft across the organization through your work and leadership.


**About You**
Minimum Qualifications
  * 12+ years creating content for consumer digital products, with a portfolio that demonstrates mastery in content design, narrative development, and establishing design standards. Must include at least 2 years of direct experience designing AI model interactions.
  * Natural storyteller with refined taste and strong writing instincts who creates user experiences that surprise and delight. Your expertise spans language, design methodology, and content systems, enabling you to distill complexity into clarity.
  * Deep knowledge of how information architecture and visual-verbal design work together to create coherent product experiences.
  * Proven expertise in prompt engineering that drives personalization at scale. You go beyond surface-level conversational polish—you architect the underlying instructions that determine how AI systems think, respond, and adapt to individual user contexts.
  * Technical fluency to understand how data composition, training approaches, and prompt modifications influence AI behavior and output quality.
  * Strategic thinker who bridges user research, product goals, and business objectives to create language frameworks and UX copy that solve real problems.
  * Self-directed operator who thrives in ambiguous, fast-moving environments, making smart tradeoffs and maintaining high standards without close supervision.
  * Compelling communicator who builds buy-in for your vision through well-crafted presentations, interactive prototypes, and clear connections to company strategy.
  * Passionate about developing others, consistently modeling excellence and providing guidance that helps teammates grow their craft.
  * Energized by open-ended challenges that require you to establish structure, rally stakeholders, and chart a clear path forward where none existed before.
  * Deeply empathetic and self-aware, with genuine commitment to creating experiences that work for diverse global audiences.


You might thrive in this role if you:
  * Find energy at the intersection of language, technology, and human behavior—particularly in pioneering how people and AI collaborate in everyday contexts.
  * Embrace a test-and-learn mindset, readily exploring new directions while having the discipline to abandon approaches that don't deliver results.
  * Engage thoughtfully with complex, sometimes abstract questions about user intent and AI behavior, while keeping the team focused on practical outcomes.

  * Lead data operations at scale, including in-store capture, synthetic generation, and third-party annotation—setting data quality bars, SLAs, and privacy standards in partnership with Legal and Security.
  * Establish rigorous evaluation frameworks that connect offline metrics and on-device performance to business outcomes (e.g., recognition accuracy, shrink reduction, throughput), including pilots and A/B tests in stores.
  * Drive deployment readiness and reliability: model packaging for edge devices, rollout plans, monitoring and alerting, incident response, and postmortems with clear, actionable follow-ups.
  * Communicate program status and insights to stakeholders and executives; proactively manage dependencies and risks across a ~25-person cross-functional org and external vendors.


## **About You**
### _Minimum Qualifications_
  * 6+ years of technical program management experience, ideally leading end-to-end ML/AI programs from data to production.
  * 3+ years working on computer vision or edge/on-device ML for embedded, mobile, or hardware-integrated products.

  * Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Electrical/Computer Engineering, or a related technical field; or equivalent practical experience.
  * Hands-on familiarity with the ML lifecycle, including data pipelines, labeling/annotation workflows, model training/evaluation, and MLOps/CI-CD for ML.
  * Ability to query and analyze data using SQL and basic Python to validate assumptions and interpret model and product performance.
  * Experience coordinating cross-functional teams of 10+ stakeholders, including external vendors, with strong risk, dependency, and change management.
  * Excellent written and verbal communication skills, including executive-level reporting and decision facilitation.
  * Willingness to travel to stores, labs, and partner sites as needed (up to 15%).


### _Preferred Qualifications_
  * Experience in retail technology, robotics, autonomous systems, or other physical AI domains.

  * Background establishing data quality standards and managing third-party labeling vendors at scale.
  * Familiarity with privacy, security, and compliance considerations for in-store data collection (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
  * Graduate degree in a relevant technical field.
  * Experience integrating hardware components (cameras, depth sensors, scales) and leading calibration/validation workflows.
  * Ability to create dashboards and operational telemetry for model and program health using tools like Looker, Mode, or similar.

I’m a 29M. For the last 4 years, my baseline BP has ranged from 128-141 (systolic). However, 4 days ago I started feeling dizzy. When I checked, my BP had spiked to **155+ / 100**. This has persisted for 4 days.

I am very concerned about this sudden jump and the accompanying dizziness.

**My Stats & Context:**

* **Height/Weight:** 165cm / 64kg (BMI \~23.5)
* **Ethnicity:** Malaysian Chinese (I think it matters because it says a lot about the cuisine that you grow up with. Chinese cuisine tend to have more salts)
* **Activity:** Gym 2-3x week, Badminton once every two weeks.
* **Vices:** Non-smoker. Alcohol is rare (once every 3 months). Never take coffee.
* **Family History:** Strong maternal history of hypertension at an early age, so I suspect a genetic component.

**My Questions:**

1. **Intermittent Fasting:** Has anybody tried intermittent (specifically 16:8) for BP control? Did you see results?
2. **Dietary Specifics:** During the eating window, what specific foods help balance electrolytes (Potassium/Magnesium) to lower BP?
3. **Medical Advice:** Given the sudden spike and family history, what specific specialist should I push to see (Cardiologist, Nephrologist, Endocrinologist)?
4. **Diagnostics:** Is there any critical information or specific lab tests I should ask for to help determine the root cause?
5. **Resources:** Can anyone share studies or case logs regarding intermittent fasting and Hypertension?",2,1769922339.0,hypertension,0,1.0,False

I mean, it's nice and all for a quick cup in the morning whilst getting ready for work when I'm running late.. But on the weekends, when there's more time, I looove to brew a small pot o' my fav coffee and be all warm and cozy lazily enjoying my warm mug of pour over gorgeousness, you dig?

This is day one of nine. 1/9, I says! That's right! Off for the next nine whoooooollle days! 🤸🏻‍♀️ Ngl, I'm a lil restless rn. Like I should be doing something. Still in pajamas, I know it's late.. Trying to plan my days ahead, and I think it's going to be good. Finn's chicken is roasting in the oven and the rice is cooked. My boy is hungry! Of course there is broccoli and sweet potatoes, too. And it's so sunny outside, leerrrv. He's sleeping in a sun puddle on the bed. 🥰

Thinking I'd like to make a lasagna at some point. I'll have to go out for sour dough and a baguette, will def be making my lentil soup as well! But if I do make the lasagna, it's gonna be too much for one person, so I look to P, who I know would be happy to take some off me hands! I know what I'll do, I'll get those tins, the toss away tins with handles you bake with at the grocery store. The deep dish ones! I'll get two of those, one for my apartment and one for Pia's place. The mozzarella and ricotta, I use whole milk cause I'm a fatty. ANNND if youre gonna have lasagna, have fucking lasagna. I don't mess with the low fat ricotta and mozzarella. I like to mix the ricotta with defrosted, strained, chopped spinach, too, cause it's looks so pretty. White cheese speckled with green, whaaaa? I'll get two tins of San Marzano plum tomatoes, too. Make my own marinara sauce. Fresh basil and a hunk of grated Parmesan Reggiano to finish the whole thing off with along with Italian garlic bread.. sheesh. Sounds like a plan! Omg, drooling rn. 🤤

Annnd everything, all the ingredients are on sale so how can I not make it. I mean I could easily do stuffed shells, or a manicotti, that's easier. But that's .. eh, boring. Now lasagna, that takes time. Lasagna is fucking gorgeous, you know how I feel about it. All components make with lerv and carefully considered. I don't cut corners or use those weird lasagna sheets that you just bake, no boiling in water needed! No! Wtf is that!? First things first, make the marinara sauce, boil the salted water and add the pasta sheets till al dente. Al dente, I said. Never liked over cooked pasta, thats bad. Mix the ricotta with the dry chopped defrosted spinach till it's all pretty and speckled and smooth. CAn even add an egg to the mixture, I'll have to think about that...  I usually do ground turkey and not sausage or beef. And I'm quite light with the meat, not big on a meaty lasagna like like some folk do. Nerp. I mean it's nice, just not for me. I don't want it too heavy like.

Then comes the layering, my favorite part. Sauce on the bottom of the pan, layered with cooked pasta sheets, topped with the cooked and seasoned and drained turkey (I like the ShadyBrook 80% fat version, not the 90%, that's too lean and rubbery, too tough) then glob on the ricotta/spinach mix and smooth out with off set spatula. Top with freshly grated mozzarella, and more sauce, then repeat the whole process till you reach the top. Cover with reynolds wrap and bake in 400 degree oven till bubbling, and omg. Sometimes if it's just outta the oven and not quite set, it will be a little watery, or liquidy if you cut into it too soon, so I like to let it rest for as long as I can possibly stand, but it's never too much liquid as the pasta should continue to cook once assembled, and absorb the sauce.. 

  
Holy crap, I'm gonna do it. Haven't made a lasagna in a few years! I think the last time I made it, I filmed it and posted it and you guys saw it. Gosh, that was a very long time ago. That was when we had to post our vid clips on Imgur, remember that?! Goodness, I'm excited. I'll text Pia, see if she's is in the mood for it. 🤗

  
Messaging Pia! She wants sausage, so I'll use the sweet Italian sausage!!

For me, that project was always creative writing – something I deeply wanted to do, but consistently found ways to put off, despite knowing exactly *how* to do it.

My struggle wasn't a lack of time or knowledge; it was the gnawing resistance that popped up every single day. The ""I'll do it later when I feel inspired"" trap. I tried everything from strict Pomodoro timers (which often just made me stare blankly at a screen for 25 minutes) to elaborate rewards systems (which I inevitably cheated). None of it stuck for more than a week or two.

But recently, I've had a breakthrough, not with some revolutionary secret, but by leaning into a super simple principle and adding a few personal tweaks. I’ve maintained some form of creative work for **112 consecutive days** now, and it’s no longer a battle. Here’s what shifted for me:

**My ""No-Zero Days"" Experiment with a Twist**

The core idea is ""no zero days"" – meaning you do *something*, no matter how small, towards your goal every single day. My spin makes it practically impossible to fail:

1.  **The Trigger:** I tied it to an existing, non-negotiable habit. For me, that's my first cup of coffee in the morning. *Before* I open email, *before* I check Slack, *before* anything else, I sit down with my coffee and my writing. This ""before X"" rule is crucial for beating procrastination.
2.  **The Minimal Viable Action (MVA):** This is where I almost broke it. My MVA isn't ""write 500 words"" or ""finish a chapter."" It's incredibly small, designed to reduce friction to zero:
    *   *Option A (Ideal):* 15 minutes of focused writing. I set a simple timer (on my phone, no fancy apps).
    *   *Option B (Resistance is High):* Outline one scene, or just a few bullet points for a plot idea.
    *   *Option C (Feeling Horrible/Zero Inspiration):* Open my manuscript and read one paragraph I wrote yesterday, or just proofread a single sentence. That’s it. Five minutes max. Still counts as a ""non-zero day.""
3.  **No Pressure for Perfection:** The goal isn't to write something brilliant every day. The goal is to *show up*. I learned to silence my inner critic during this 15-minute window. Bad writing is still writing.
4.  **Simple Accountability:** I didn't join a public writing group or post on social media (too much pressure for me). Instead, I had a shared Google Sheet with one trusted friend who's working on their own creative project. We simply listed our initials and a ""Y"" or ""N"" each day. No long explanations, no judging, just a quick check-in. This quiet accountability was enough.

**The Messy Middle & What Almost Derailed Me:**

*   **The ""Why bother?"" feeling:** In the first two weeks, there were days I'd stare at my screen, thinking, ""This is only 15 minutes, what difference will it make?"" I pushed through by reminding myself that the goal wasn't a finished product *today*, but building the *habit*.
*   **Actual busy days:** Some mornings truly felt packed. On those days, I’d default to Option C (reading a sentence) just to maintain the streak. It kept the chain going without feeling like a massive burden.
*   **The Inspiration Myth:** I waited for inspiration for years. This method taught me that consistency *generates* inspiration. Showing up often sparks an idea I wouldn't have had otherwise.
*   **The Breakthrough Point:** Around day 25-30, something shifted. It stopped feeling like a ""should"" and started feeling like a natural part of my day. The resistance lessened significantly. Now, those 15 minutes often stretch into 30, 45, or even an hour because I get into a flow state.

**The Results (So Far):**

*   I finished the first draft of a short story collection that had been languishing for months (it took about 45 days of this method to get through the bulk of it).
*   I’ve started outlining a novel idea, which felt impossible before.
*   More importantly, the *habit* feels solid. Even on tough days, the thought of skipping feels alien. It’s ingrained.

This isn't a ""get rich quick"" or ""become a literary genius overnight"" method. It’s a strategy for consistent, sustainable progress on those important, non-urgent tasks that usually get pushed aside. It's about reducing the activation energy to practically nothing and letting momentum do the heavy lifting.

1qsp3vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1qsp3vp/my_neighbor_is_growing_something_in_her_yard_and/,"My Neighbor Is Growing Something in Her Yard, and It Smells Like It Wants Me","I didn’t realize when it first started that I was paying attention.

That’s what unsettles me most now, because I can’t remember when curiosity turned into something else. It crept in slowly, like Mississippi winter, damp and quiet, slipping into your bones before you notice you’re cold.

She moved in next door late last fall, right when the trees were shedding and the air started smelling like wet bark and chimney smoke. Nobody really spoke to her. She waved sometimes, smiled in that distant way people do when their attention is already somewhere else. She spent most of her time in her backyard, working the soil even when frost clung to the fence rails.

At first her garden looked normal. Struggling vegetables, herbs turning brittle from the cold, late flowers hanging on out of stubbornness. Then, after a week of steady winter rain, something began forcing its way out of the soil along our shared fence.

I noticed it while drinking coffee one morning, watching fog crawl across the street. It already stood knee-high and thick as my wrist, and I remember being certain it hadn’t been there the day before.

The stalk was a deep, mottled green veined with purple, like bruised flesh healing badly. Its surface wasn’t bark or fibrous skin. It looked layered, ridged in overlapping strands that seemed to flex slightly when the wind pushed against it. I told myself it was just rainwater running down grooves in the surface, but even then I remember feeling like it was breathing in its sleep.

It grew steadily, ignoring frost and cold snaps that killed everything else in her yard. By early winter, it had climbed above the fence and twisted toward the old oak tree, sending thick vines around its trunk. Swollen nodules formed along the vines, pale and tight, like something waiting to rupture.

That was when animals started disappearing.

The neighborhood stray cats vanished first. Then squirrels stopped crossing the power lines. Even the possums that used to shuffle through the alley stopped showing up. Nobody found remains. No tracks in the mud. Just silence that felt heavier than it should have been.

Around that time, the smell started drifting over after dark.

It smelled warm and sweet, like fruit fermenting under wet leaves. Completely wrong for winter. The scent slowed my thoughts in a way that felt comforting, almost soothing. I started losing small pieces of time after that. I’d step outside to grab a package and find myself standing at the fence twenty minutes later, staring at the plant without remembering why I walked there. I burned dinner twice in one week because I forgot I’d started cooking. I started waking up with dirt under my fingernails that I couldn’t explain.

I also noticed a faint discoloration creeping along the inside of my wrist. At first it looked like a mild rash, thin greenish lines branching under the skin like delicate veins. It never itched or hurt, so I ignored it. It seemed to darken slightly on nights when the smell was strongest, but I kept telling myself I was imagining patterns that weren’t there.

I asked her about the plant once while she knelt beside it, scraping something dark from the base with a small gardening knife.

Up close, shallow splits had formed along the stalk, opening just enough to reveal glossy tissue beneath that shifted slowly, like thick sap trying to breathe.

“It needs care,” she said without looking at me.

Her hands were stained a deep rust color, packed into her cuticles and knuckle lines like she’d been digging in clay that wouldn’t wash away. When she finally looked up, her pupils seemed too large, swallowing most of the brown in her eyes.

“If I don’t tend it,” she continued, pressing her palm against the stalk, “it gets restless.”

The surface rippled beneath her touch. Not dramatically. Just enough to make my stomach tighten.

I laughed and went back inside because laughing felt easier than asking questions I wasn’t sure I wanted answered.

The night I saw it feed, the temperature hovered just above freezing. Fog blurred the streetlights into pale halos. I stepped outside to drag my trash to the curb when I heard something shrieking from her yard, sharp and desperate enough to make my chest tighten.

I looked through the fence and saw a raccoon circling the base of the plant, its breath fogging in quick bursts as it sniffed the ground like it had followed a scent trail it couldn’t understand.

The vines moved.

They didn’t snap or lash out. They uncoiled slowly, sliding across the ground with a wet dragging sound like soaked rope. One wrapped around the raccoon’s back leg. Another cinched around its middle until I heard ribs creak.

Thin tendrils pushed from the swollen nodules along the vine, pale and threadlike, slipping beneath the animal’s fur with slow, patient insistence. The raccoon screamed and convulsed as those tendrils pulsed darker, as if something thick was flowing through them.

Then the smell hit me.

It rolled across the yard thick and warm, completely out of place in the freezing air. My thoughts dulled instantly. The screaming softened, muffled like it was underwater. I remember noticing how peaceful the fog looked drifting between the houses, how calm everything felt despite the sound that I knew, somewhere distant in my mind, should have terrified me.

The raccoon stopped moving. The tendrils withdrew slowly, slick and dark. The vines tightened once more with a soft cracking sound. The body collapsed inward slightly, like something inside it had been hollowed out and folded in on itself.

When I blinked, the yard was empty.

I don’t remember walking back inside. I woke the next morning sitting on my couch with dried mud on my jeans and a faint copper smell clinging to my sleeves. My wrist ached slightly, and the greenish veins had spread farther up my forearm. I convinced myself it was irritation from the cold or some strange allergic reaction, even though part of me knew that explanation didn’t make sense.

Since then, I’ve started hearing a low humming sound at night. I thought it was my heater or pipes, but it gets louder when I stand near the fence. It almost sounds rhythmic, like breathing or a slow heartbeat under the ground. I’ve also been having dreams about being underground. Not buried. Just surrounded by roots. The soil feels warm in those dreams. Safe. I wake up calmer than I should.

The plant has changed again.

The seams along its stalk open wider at night, revealing slick, glistening tissue beneath. A thin, milky fluid sometimes leaks into the soil, and wherever it drips, smaller shoots begin pushing upward within days. The vines have slipped through gaps in the fence and now rest against the frozen grass in my yard.

I’ve caught myself touching them more than once. They vibrate faintly, like distant machinery humming beneath the earth. The last time I pulled my hand away, a faint imprint of branching lines lingered on my palm for several minutes before fading.

She looks healthier now than when she moved in. Fuller. Rosier. Sometimes when she talks, her jaw moves slightly after she finishes speaking, like she’s chewing something slowly. Once, while she was smiling, I thought I saw something shift beneath the skin of her throat, like a swallow moving in the wrong direction.

Last night she stood beside the fence while storm clouds rolled overhead.

“It knows you,” she said quietly. “You’re receptive.”

I asked her what it eats.

She smiled, and the smell drifting from the garden thickened until it felt like it was settling into my lungs.

“It takes what it’s offered,” she said.

I should be afraid. I know that somewhere under the calm wrapping around my thoughts. I know the missing pieces of my memory should terrify me. I know the veins spreading slowly along my arm shouldn’t look as natural to me as they’re starting to feel.

But tonight the scent is stronger than it’s ever been, drifting through the cracks in my windows and settling into my chest like warm breath. The humming beneath the ground feels steadier when I stand closer to the fence, almost comforting. The vines have crossed completely into my yard now, tracing slow patterns through the frost like they’re mapping the space between us.

One brushed my ankle earlier, and I didn’t pull away right away.

I think I’m going to step into her yard.  
Just for a closer look.  
Just to understand what it wants.

""A distant crash makes the walls of my room vibrate, waking me up. I try to close my eyes again, but knowing that the first siren is almost always followed by another, I reluctantly sit on the edge of my bed. With a vacant stare and half-closed eyes, I stretch my limbs and clear my mind after washing my face with cold water.


""The deathly silence of my caravan is broken when I turn on my old television to the news channel. While searching in my nearly empty cupboard, I listen to a report that makes my heart churn and chills my blood.


""At 1:30 a.m., a fifty-one-year-old man was on his front porch with his sixteen-year-old son when men on a motorcycle arrived to..."" ""Kill them.""

My mind wanders for a few moments, but I regain my composure when the steam rising from my small pot touches my face. I'm afraid to say that I know those responsible for that incident, and something tells me I could be next.

Relaxing on my sofa, I fill my stomach with a piece of stale bread and butter as the chill in my body fades when a brown liquid trickles down my throat.

My gaze wanders over every corner of my home.

Weary from an invisible burden, I sigh in defeat. For weeks, my mind has tormented me with a thought, an action that could end my problems forever, but which, out of cowardice or something else, I haven't carried out.

A faint sense of responsibility jolts me out of my trance. Standing up, I leave my caravan, leaving my half-finished coffee pot behind. Take a sip. The sea breeze gently caresses my face as my hair moves in the wind.

Walking among old carnival rides, the ground beneath my feet creaks with each step, and the soles of my boots slip on the mold and dampness that have accumulated in the wood. The old Ferris wheel still stands, crooked, as if waiting for the exact moment to topple over. As I exhale, my breath freezes in the air.

◇◇◇

Looking up at the sky, the sun's rays barely pierce the dense gray clouds that blanket the city. From a railing, I watch the seagulls meticulously preening themselves, only interrupted when they see me pass by.

When I glance at the people in suits walking beside me, none of them returning my gaze, I wonder if I would have been in their place. If only I had made better choices in my life. Although, to be honest, their apathetic, almost lifeless expressions aren't so different from my own.

Dodging the rushing crowd to catch the last bus, I suddenly feel a strong grip on my left shoulder, more intent on hurting me than getting my attention.

""Hey, Ethan. Long time no see.""

Death whispers in my ear. Turning around, a bald guy in a military jacket intercepts me, dragging me with him into a dark alley.

The stench of rancid garbage permeates the place, compressed by large dumpsters.

""Where's what you owe us?"" he asks furiously, his eyebrows almost touching.

""Calm down, Armando."" I raise my hands. ""I haven't done it yet."" I have.

Two guys behind him, tattooed to the core, stare at me like they want to squash a rat.

""You've been given plenty of time,"" one of them says. ""Are we your clowns?""

My heart pounds in my chest, marking every second I'm missing. I reach for my pocket, slowing my pace as I see their eyes tighten.

""What's this?"" Armando closes the distance.

""Believe me, it's all I've got right now.""

""The boss's been waiting for you for a long time, shit.""

""Give me more time. I promise I'll have a part tomorrow...""

His knuckles slam into my teeth, pushing me against them. the pavement.



— You son of a bitch, listen to me. We've given you way too much time, understand?



His blow makes my eyes dart around, barely making out my surroundings. Armando crouches down to be at my level, but I'm still below him.



— Last chance. If you don't have our money by tomorrow, then I'll cut off your hands, you hear?



— Yes… — I nod, without looking at him.



I didn't stand up until they left. The muddy concrete stained my beige shirt. This week I was going to eat with those twenty dollars I no longer had.



Fucking faggot. — I clench my jaw.



To think that he used to be my friend…


I keep walking to the factory, my gums bleeding and my lip split.



◇◇◇


The warehouse vibrates from the force of the machinery, and the stifling atmosphere makes the back of my neck sweat. Sitting on a stool, the foreman looks at his phone while supervising the staff.



""Good morning,"" I say, fanning my chest with my shirt. ""Do you have work?""



""Over there,"" he points without looking at me. ""Unload that truck and put the boxes on that platform.""


My motivation goes down the drain when I see the pile of boxes that's taller than me.



""That's a lot. Is there anything extra?""



""The Same here. If you want. — He grunts.

Since I'm not officially on the payroll, I make a living by helping out occasionally.

In moments like this, I'd normally turn around and leave, but I need to make up for lost money. Besides, I have another problem on my hands. I have to pay those guys, but I don't know how. Robbing a store isn't as easy as it used to be, not to mention they don't keep much cash on hand anymore. Running away is impossible; they'd find me sooner or later.

Behind me, a high-pitched, raspy voice catches my attention. When I turn around, I'm surprised to see an old acquaintance. Maybe he can help me.

As if my arms were carrying blocks of iron, my face starts sweating profusely. It's a miracle nothing fell and crushed my foot. I manage to finish this job with great difficulty. The sun is already high in the sky. Barely Just as I managed to sit down to catch my breath, someone arrived to interrupt my sacred rest.

""Ethan, I need you to take these tools upstairs,"" the foreman ordered sharply.

""I'm coming. Give me five minutes,"" I said, wiping the sweat from my brow with my shirtsleeve.

""Now. Or I won't pay you.""

He strode away from me.

""Son of a bitch,"" I muttered to myself.

My stomach churned, as if I'd eaten acid. It was midday, and I still couldn't speak to him. Here, even the walls had ears, and besides, I wasn't sure I wanted to.

The workers left after hearing the bell ring. With the area clearer, I walked toward him. I felt my My legs grow weaker with every step I take.

His tank top reveals almost skeletal arms.

""Hey, Frank, how have you been?""

Interrupting his work polishing a boat, he turns to find my voice.

""Ethan!"" he says, extending his hand. ""Damn, how long has it been?""

I return his gesture. His sawdust-covered palm makes it feel rougher.

""Months, I guess."" I force a laugh. ""I thought you were still locked up.""

""No, man. I got out yesterday. Thank God.""

""I heard you got arrested for kidnapping..."" Someone.



— Simón, dude. — He clicks his tongue, letting out a sour breath. — But they also caught me because I stayed behind to look after that idiot.



His bad breath hits my nose like a mule. It's hard to pretend everything's normal when the dark yellow of his teeth steals my attention for a second. I'm amazed he still has them in place.



— So tell me, why are you saying hi? Don't give me any of that nonsense.



I lower my gaze, gathering my thoughts.



— Look… — I say, lowering my voice. — I need money. I don't know if you can help me.



— That's a shame, dude. — He sighs. — I don't have any money to lend you. I'm broke.



— I'm not… “Borrowing,” I say, placing my hand on the back of my neck and squeezing it. “It’s just, don’t you have a job around here to do? You know.” I nod.

“Oh, I get it.” He frowns, his mouth twisting into a smile. “Maybe I can introduce you to someone, but I don’t know, man. I don’t want you to embarrass me.” He shrugs.

“Relax.” I pat my chest. “You know how I work.”

“It’s not that.”

I don’t like the way he starts looking around. When he’s sure no one’s watching us, he signals me to lower my head.

“I want you to twist someone,” he whispers.

My tongue locks for a second, like something’s blocking it. My throat. I was expecting the usual. Not this.

The skin on my back prickles. I don't want to do this, but if I refuse, I'll be the one left to die.

Frank taps me on the shoulder.

""Hey, relax. It's fine if you don't want to do it.""

I force myself to speak. My throat is still closed.

""Why do they want to break him?""

""I don't know, man."" He laughs indifferently. ""I just heard the big shot from my area wants him dead. But the guy lives in another neighborhood, you know?"" He makes a vague gesture with his hand. ""If everyone goes, it'll be a total mess, but you'll go alone. Nobody knows you.""

Me I rub my eyelids with my fingers and lift my chin. I say nothing. I jump when the bell rings again, reminding me how little time I have left to decide.

He must have done something to make them want to kill him…

— Yeah… go ahead. — I reply, my voice barely audible.

— Sure, man. — He nods. — I'll give you the address and they'll tell you what to do there.

Frank puts his arm around my back, lowering his voice.

— Listen, do it right. If you screw up and someone finds out, I'm screwed too.

I leave the place after my payment. The hunger I felt has vanished, and my hands tremble and my temples throb. I have to kill him without anyone seeing me. I don't know how.",1,1769921838.0,writers,5,1.0,False

I still remember those days when I first left home for engineering studies and stayed in a hostel. Back then, 'home' wasn't just a house made of bricks and mortar; it was a spiritual solace. The six months of the semester in the hostel's four walls somehow passed, but my eyes were always fixed on those red dates on the calendar—summer vacations.

When the train would stop at the station and I'd turn into the alley with my heavy bag slung over my shoulder, it felt like someone had filled my lungs with fresh air. Reaching the doorstep, Amma's scolding—""You're here? You've gotten so thin""—was the biggest reward in the world for me. In those ten to fifteen days, the entire household revolved around me. Even Babuji's reprimands were laced with love, and to my younger siblings, I was nothing short of a hero. I was a part of that home, just like a beating heart in a body.

But then time turned its wheel. I got a job, the city changed, and gradually, visits home became fewer. At first, I'd go for every festival, then just Diwali, and then... only video calls.

Money started coming in. I got the raw roof of the house made permanent. I sent money for Babuji's treatment at a good hospital. I sent new sarees for Amma and a big TV for the house. I thought I was fulfilling my duty. I used to think, ""I'm earning for them, after all."" But I had no idea that in the noise of this 'earning' and 'duty,' the 'sense of belonging' was silently dying somewhere.

Today, after a full five years, I was returning. This time, there was no jostling in the general compartment; I had my own car, branded clothes in my suitcase, and a fat wallet in my pocket. But as I reached the corner of the alley, I felt a strange nervousness.

The old wooden door of the house, where I had once carved my name with a knife, was gone. In its place was a heavy iron gate—strong, shiny, but emotionless. I honked.

Babuji came out. His gait had slowed. He opened the gate, but the old sparkle that used to light up his face when he saw me getting off the train wasn't there. There was a formal smile, like a host welcoming some distinguished guest.

""You're here? The journey was fine, right? Park the car inside,"" he said.

His words had less 'warmth' and more 'courtesy.'

I went inside. The courtyard was now paved. The old tulsi platform where Amma used to light a lamp in the evening had shrunk into a corner.

Amma came out from the kitchen. She didn't hug me; she just ran her hand over my head from a distance. Perhaps my expensive suit and my 'big boss' image was making her hesitant.

In the evening, when we all sat together, an awkward silence spread between us. We used to eat from the same plate before, fighting, making noise. Today, everyone was sitting properly.

My younger brother, who was now a father himself, asked me, ""Bhaiya, would you like tea or should I get coffee made? People in your city must drink coffee, right?""

This question pierced my heart like a dagger. In the home where ginger tea was thrust into my hands without asking my preference, today my 'choice' was being asked. This wasn't respect; it was the distance that time had drawn between us.

The biggest shock came when I headed towards my room.

Amma stopped me hesitantly, ""Beta, that... your room has been turned into a store room. There was too much stuff, you know. I've cleaned the guest room for you. There's an AC there too; you won't feel hot.""

My feet froze right there. My room... where I had woven my nighttime dreams, where I had pasted the poster of my first earning on the wall—that was now a 'store room.' And me? I was no longer the son of this house; I was a guest in the 'guest room.'

That night, lying on the velvety mattress, I couldn't sleep. The coolness of the AC wasn't in my bones, but in the relationships. I realized that I had bought a house in the city, but lost my 'home.' When a person climbs the ladder of success, often the very ladder they stepped on to climb up gets left behind.

I was the same, the house was the same, the people were the same. Just, time had erected an invisible wall between us. I understood that now I was just a 'relative' who comes only on vacations, someone whose arrival is awaited, but over whom no one claims any rights anymore.

That night, under the roof of my own home, I felt homeless.",1,1769921489.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

They're not exactly ignoring you, but they're also not making a move. You catch them staring sometimes, then they look away. They seem interested one day, distant the next. It's driving you insane and you're wondering if you're just reading way too much into everything.



I spent months researching this exact pattern, digging through psychology studies, relationship podcasts, and behavioral science books. Turns out, there's actual science behind why people hide their feelings and specific patterns you can spot. Here's what actually matters.



\*\*They get weirdly nervous around you, but only you\*\*



Your crush acts totally normal with everyone else, then suddenly they're fumbling their words or getting fidgety when you show up. This isn't random. Research on attachment styles shows that when someone's into you but scared of rejection, their nervous system literally goes into overdrive. They might:



\* Touch their face or hair more when talking to you

\* Struggle to maintain eye contact (or stare too intensely then look away fast)

\* Laugh at things that aren't even that funny

\* Get quieter than usual or talk way more than they normally would



\*\*The Definitive Book of Body Language\*\* by Allan and Barbara Pease breaks this down perfectly. It's a bestseller that decodes exactly what people's physical cues mean. The book shows how micro expressions reveal what someone's actually feeling, even when they're trying to hide it. After reading it, you'll never miss these signals again. Insanely useful for reading any social situation.



\*\*They remember the tiny details you mentioned once\*\*



You casually mentioned loving a specific band three weeks ago. Now they're suddenly listening to them and bringing it up in conversation. They remember your coffee order, your favorite TV show, that story about your childhood dog. This isn't coincidence.



When someone's interested but hiding it, they're paying way more attention than they let on. Psychologist Dr. John Gottman's research on relationships found that emotional attunement (remembering small details) is one of the biggest indicators of genuine interest. They're basically collecting information about you without being obvious about it.



\*\*Check out Matthew Hussey's YouTube channel\*\*, especially his videos on mixed signals. This guy's a behavioral psychologist who's worked with thousands of people on dating psychology. His content cuts through the BS advice and explains exactly why people act hot and cold. No fluff, just practical insight on human behavior.



\*\*Their friends act weird around you\*\*



Ever notice their friends smirking when you walk into the room? Or maybe they suddenly get quiet when you join the conversation? Their friends probably know something you don't.



When someone's hiding their feelings, they usually confide in close friends. Those friends then have to play it cool around you, which creates awkward energy. Look for:



\* Friends pushing you two together in group settings

\* Inside jokes that stop abruptly when you appear  

\* Their friends asking you oddly specific questions about your relationship status

\* That knowing look between friends when your crush's name comes up



\*\*They find excuses to be around you without making it obvious\*\*



They just happen to show up at places you frequent. They volunteer for the same projects at work. They join conversations you're in but act like it's totally casual. This is intentional proximity, and it's one of the clearest signs someone's interested but playing it safe.



\*\*Attached: The New Science of Adult Attachment\*\* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller explains this perfectly. It's research backed content from a psychiatrist and psychologist showing how attachment styles affect behavior in relationships. The book reveals why some people (anxious or avoidant types) will orbit around their crush instead of being direct. Understanding your crush's attachment style explains SO much about their confusing behavior. Game changer for decoding mixed signals.



\*\*Their texting pattern is inconsistent but they never fully disappear\*\*



They take forever to respond sometimes, but then other times they reply instantly. They might send short messages but keep the conversation going. They react to your social media posts but don't always comment. This hot and cold pattern isn't them being a jerk, it's often fear.



Psychologist Dr. Lisa Marie Bobby talks about this on her podcast \*\*Love, Happiness and Success\*\*. She explains how people who are scared of vulnerability will create distance as a protective mechanism, but can't fully pull away because the feelings are real. It's not manipulation, it's self protection.



For a more personalized approach to understanding these patterns, there's BeFreed, an AI learning app that creates custom audio content based on your specific goals. If you're trying to navigate dating as an introvert or figure out mixed signals from someone with a different attachment style, you can tell it exactly what you're dealing with. 



It pulls from dating psychology books, relationship research, and expert insights to build a learning plan that actually fits your situation. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10 minute overviews to detailed 40 minute sessions with real examples. Plus you can pick a voice that keeps you engaged, whether that's something energetic or more conversational. It's practical for anyone trying to improve their dating life without endless scrolling through generic advice.



For tracking these patterns and understanding your own reactions, the \*\*Finch app\*\* helps you identify your emotional patterns and attachment behaviors. It's weirdly helpful for recognizing when you're overthinking versus when your gut instinct is actually picking up on something real.



Look, most people hide their feelings because they're terrified of rejection or worried about ruining the friendship. The mixed signals aren't a game, they're usually just fear. But also, you deserve someone who can be emotionally available and clear about their intentions, even if it takes them a minute to get there.



If you're seeing multiple signs here, there's probably something real happening. The question isn't just whether they like you back. It's whether you want to wait around for someone who's too scared to be honest about their feelings, or if you'd rather find someone who's brave enough to show up fully.



Trust your gut. You're not crazy for noticing these patterns. You're just paying attention.

1qsox68,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qsox68/aitah_for_setting_boundaries_after_a_friend/,AITAH for setting boundaries after a friend started mirroring serious parts of my life?,"I (19F) have been friends with “Anna” (18F) since kindergarten. When I say friends, I mean we’ve been orbiting each other our entire lives.

I’ll be honest. Even as kids, I found her kind of insufferable. She wasn’t mean, just extremely fixated on me. If I wore a purple scarf, her mom would drive her to buy the same one. If I liked something, it suddenly became her personality. She even asked to be called my name, just spelled slightly differently. It wasn’t malicious, just constant mirroring. Flattering maybe. Mostly annoying.

Despite that, I was always kind. I went to her birthday parties, went on a mini vacation with her family, and even did a talent show with her because she wanted me to. She just wasn’t my cup of tea.

As we got older, friend groups changed, and she became the only friend I really had. The obsessive behavior faded a bit, and honestly, I learned how to set boundaries through my relationship with her, something I’m actually grateful for now. By middle school, the dynamic shifted from imitation to competition, and I knew it. I mostly ignored it.

Then eighth grade hit, and my life completely changed.

I suddenly developed seizures from a neurological condition. It was terrifying and life altering. I missed school, was physically and emotionally exhausted, and had to relearn how to exist in my body. She was there for me during that time. She helped clean when we hung out and supported me emotionally. I will always acknowledge that.

I forced my life back to what felt like normal as fast as I could. By high school, my condition wasn’t part of my daily identity anymore, though the work to get there was intense.

Early in high school, she participated in a hurtful rumor about me. That was my breaking point. Years of one sided conversations and emotional labor caught up to me, and I realized this friendship wasn’t healthy anymore. So I pulled away.

I found a new friend group. She inserted herself into it. I wasn’t rude, just distant. Polite hallway conversations, a birthday gift, but no daily calls. I was done.

About a year after my seizures began, she started mimicking symptoms of my condition. I noticed immediately. After it happened a few times, I checked in with her. Eventually she said, “I think I have your condition.” I literally walked away.

My disorder isn’t unheard of, but it’s not common, and it was still very fresh for me. Given her long pattern of mirroring and attention seeking, I genuinely believed it wasn’t real. I stopped speaking to her.

Later, I transferred schools. She ended up working where I worked, and later became my employee at a different job where I was in a leadership role. Over time, my anger cooled. We had a couple coffee chats and acted like nothing had ever happened.

Now she’s away at college, and I’m working back home. Recently, she texted asking for the name of my seizure condition. After I told her, she replied, “lol twins, I’m about to be diagnosed with it.”

I asked if she had gone through the proper testing. She said she was getting it done “this week.” That week has passed. No update, even though I asked her to keep me posted. Knowing her, and knowing how this diagnosis actually works, I don’t believe she has it.

After that, she unloaded everything all at once. Medications, ADHD, an eating disorder, a miscarriage, self harm, and sexual assault. I called her because I genuinely cared. I poured my heart into that conversation. I was stern but loving. I didn’t coddle her because I don’t think coddling is kind in situations like this. I told her I wanted to be the one person she could be completely real with. Wanted to let her know that she could always come to me and then I understood these things because I went through having the condition she's claiming to have.

I also want to be clear that I understand people can reinterpret experiences over time, especially when it comes to sexual trauma, and I fully respect that. My concern isn’t that re framing is impossible. It’s the broader pattern of exaggeration, oversharing without boundaries, and mimicking serious conditions that makes it difficult for me to know what’s real.

What made this even harder is that she previously described her first sexual experience to me at work very casually and not as assault at all. Now the story includes rape and pregnancy. I take assault seriously, but the shifting narrative, combined with her long history of self diagnosing and mirroring, makes it hard for me to navigate this without skepticism.

What finally pushed me over the edge is that she’s been sharing these details publicly and with much younger family members. Her cousin is the same age as my baby sister, and my sister came to me asking questions she is far too young to understand. She doesn’t even know what assault means, and she comes retelling me details graphic for a young mind, retelling all of my old friends, different struggles in life. To which I had to explain in an age-appropriate way. To my sister who's really concerned. I don’t think it’s appropriate for children to be exposed to graphic adult trauma narratives. It is what it is, but I can't help feel like if these were all authentic struggles you wouldn't be boasting it to the world much less a cousin who is nine years younger than you. Now, I feel obligated to tell my mother that my sister has been exposed to all of these adult details. You guys little sis asked me what oral meant. Has she's trying to understand the stories she's been told... I'm honestly so frustrated. 

I feel torn. I can list a million ways she supported me when I first developed seizures and my world felt like it was falling apart. I haven’t forgotten that. But I don’t want to be there for lies, exaggerations, or mirroring behavior. I’m not trying to gatekeep my diagnosis. I don’t want it, and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I’m genuinely afraid of her being falsely diagnosed with something that requires lifelong personal work and has no magic fix. The involvement with my sister just a really upset me.

She’s always been quick to label herself, the type to mess something up and joke, “Must be my ADHD.” After everything she told me, I do believe she’s struggling mentally. I just don’t believe every label she gives herself is accurate.

So, AITA for setting firm boundaries, being skeptical, and refusing to validate what feels exaggerated or fabricated, even though I care about her deeply? What would you do? Do I talk to my mom in regards to my sister? ",0,1769921337.0,AITAH,6,0.5,False

1qsous9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qsous9/the_shadows_thrall/,The Shadow's Thrall,"Now that I'm trying to tell the story of how I died, I've found myself appreciating the craft of eulogy more than I ever did in life. I'm finding it difficult to find where the story of my end begins.

It all started with *it*, I suppose. I saw it first on my walk home from work a month ago. I'd stayed late at the coffee shop after my shift was technically over, and that shift had itself only begun after a long day at school, so I wasn't in the best of moods. What helped distract from the foulness of my mood was that me and my buddy, Rick, worked similar hours as part-timers in the city who could only work outside of school hours, and we worked close enough together that we'd meet up after work and head back home together; we lived in the same neighborhood, so at least we had some company in the dark, silent city late at night.

I forgot all about the woes of university life, though, when I saw it. I caught it in the corner of my eye at first, two pale eyes peering out from the darkness of an alley into the street as we walked toward the train station long after the buses had stopped running for the night.

What I thought it was at first, I don't know, but I remember not thinking much of it at the time. A homeless person looking for some spare change, maybe. I didn't say anything to Rick, whose eyes were, as per usual, glued to his phone. I didn't say anything when I saw those two pale eyes, all white with no iris or pupil if my mind wasn't playing tricks on me, set into the bald, papery white skull of the figure that I spotted in the reflection of a store window following not too far behind us a few minutes later.

I didn't take it seriously. If I had, perhaps none of this would have happened. If anything, I thought it was annoying; if I was going to get robbed or attacked by a homeless guy, he couldn't have found me at a worse time.

In hindsight, I should have known something was up. Despite its emaciated appearance, it moved in a way that suggested strength and power, with an even stride that made him look as though he was floating and not walking. It was dressed in shades of black, which somewhat hid the disheveled state of its clothes, as it did look very much like a person who slept on the streets, despite the fact that it wasn't wearing very many layers. Even the long coat it wore was thin and couldn't have provided much heat, though the thing never shivered in the cold the entire time my eyes were on it. Rick and I were dressed for the cold and were trembling before we'd walked a block.

It was on the train, too. I knew at once when Rick saw it, because his face went red as he tried not to laugh. Despite my annoyance with that habit of his — unfortunate-looking people were one of the funniest things in the world, if you asked Rick — I had my own bad habit of laughing when others did, even when it wasn't appropriate.

Soon we were both consumed by a fit of laughter that was only silent through our efforts to not break the silence that blanketed the world at such a late hour with our nonsense. It didn't seem to mind. It just stared out at the world passing by out the window. I only realized later, after things outside of my ability to stop had already begun, that it had never cast a reflection onto the window no matter how the light shifted.

When we got off the train, it was time for Rick and I to part ways, and we did so without much fanfare. We'd see each other at school tomorrow. What I thought was a random stranger who'd just happened to catch the same train as us didn't get off at our station, so I put him out of my mind. Just one of those people you meet when you're out late at night. No one of note.

The problems started when I got to the train station two days later — Rick sometimes had days off when I didn't, lucky bastard — and Rick wasn't there. I texted him to ask whether or not he was going to be late, but he didn't answer. He didn't even read my text, according to my phone. I shrugged it off and went about my day as normal. When I had some free time around noon and saw that Rick still hadn't read my text, I started getting a little bit annoyed at how off I felt without him at my side throughout the day.

We took all the same classes, so we were rarely apart; our childish pipe dream was to study game design, which we did, and then open a studio out of the unused garage at my parents' house when we graduated. That had been the goal since we were twelve. I found myself feeling kind of embarrassed by how codependent I must have gotten without even noticing. I had work again that night, so I couldn't keep checking my phone like I had been throughout the day, but I got the feeling that if I had, I would have continued to see that read receipt showing that he hadn't even seen my message. Instead of being worried, I thought, what a loser! Skipping school wasn't going to get us our studio.

The next morning, which I had to myself, I walked to his house a few streets over from mine, the way it had been for near-exactly a decade, and knocked on the door intending to give Rick a piece of my mind. Instead, his mother answered the door, and I swallowed the harsh words that had been on the tip of my tongue in favor of a smile.

""Hey, honey,"" Nancy said quietly, almost whispering. Her voice had the same tight quality as her face. ""Ricky's not well right now, so he might not be up to going out, if that's why you've come.""

That made no sense. If he was just sick, then why the hell had he not answered my texts? ""What's he sick with? Can I talk to him, at least?""

Nancy hesitated before saying, ""Sure, why not?"" The way she said it made me think she was holding something back. I didn't fail to note that even as she walked me to his room — I had no clue why she felt the need to do that, considering that I'd been in their home a thousand times before — and I asked again, she didn't tell me exactly how he was sick.

At this time, I hadn't seen Rick in three days. I don't think I had gone that long without seeing him since we were fifteen. When I stepped into his room and Nancy closed the door behind me, I'll admit that I cringed at the sight of him. His room was dark, his curtains drawn so that no sunlight could fill the room from outside. It took my eyes a moment to adjust, but when I did, I almost gasped.

Rick was a small bundle of pale flesh wrapped in thick, dark blankets on his bed, buried in them. His skin was so white that his veins were visible all over, and he shone with slick sweat. If he wore anything under the blanket, I thankfully couldn't see what. He was not quite gaunt, but he was visibly thinner than he'd been when I last saw him. His eyes were dark still, as was his hair, though his usually bouncy curls were matted to his scalp from the sweat.

I almost blurted out that he looked like shit, which I realized before even opening my mouth wouldn't do any good. That's when the smell hit me, the stench of Rick's sweat-soaked body and the musk of unwashed flesh. His room's window must have been closed, and it must have been closed for a while. I made a noise of shock and disgust, and Rick's face twisted into a wry grin.

""Sorry,"" he said in a dull voice that shared none of the humor in his eyes.

""No problem,"" I said, making an effort not to pinch my nose so I could stop smelling him. ""What's going on, man? Haven't heard from you in a few days. Your mom told me you're sick.""

""Yeah. Sick,"" he mumbled, shifting stiffly under the blankets that he brought up to his neck with shaking arms. ""Don't know with what, but it's bad.""

I nodded slowly, and tried not to breathe in too hard. ""Have you seen a doctor?""

Rick scoffed. ""No. Dad thinks it's just the common cold. Won't hear anything about a doctor."" He laughed, and it carried a sickly wheeze. ""A doctor would have to come to me, anyway. Can't walk. Can barely move my arms. My body feels tight. And cold. Really cold.""

I shuffled on my feet, not knowing what to do to help my best friend feel better. ""Some sun can't hurt. I'll open the curtains.""

Rick sat up so fast that he almost lurched forward. ""No!"" he roared, his voice filled with something that might have been fear or rage. His eyes met mine and I was frozen to the spot by the intensity of his gaze. There was a dark patch where his head had rested on his pillow.

A few moments passed before I gathered enough of my wits to recover. ""Okay."" The smell of Rick's unwashed body, the sharp smell of sweat, filled my nose even more strongly than it had when I was standing at the door. It was a proof of my willpower that I didn't gag. My voice was strained, though, when I repeated myself without anything more to say. ""Okay.""

Rick's eyes filled with pain and he groaned as he laid back down in bed slowly. His movements were jerky and stiff, as if moving was not only painful, but difficult, as if all strength had left his body, or as if his limbs had locked up and relaxing was the hard part. He was left panting afterwards, and my first instinct was to move closer and help him however I could, but the thought crossed my mind that whatever he had might have been contagious, and that kept me where I was, one step from the door.

""Em,"" he said with his strangled, breathless voice. ""You probably shouldn't hang around.""

""Yeah, probably,"" I sighed. I looked around the dark room and instantly regretted breathing deeply enough to sigh. ""Have you talked to our teachers? I won't do your homework for you, but I can set something up.""

""Yeah, that'd be great."" His eyes met mine, and even as his body sagged into his bed after his brief exertion, those dark eyes were burning.

I left after that — the smell drove me out just as much as Rick's insistence that he was fine. The whole way home, I breathed deeply to get the stench out of my nostrils, despite how it burned my nose and lungs. That wasn't the only reason I took my time. I tried to figure out what the hell kind of disease makes a person that kind of sick. I went to our local park and sat while I searched the internet, but I found nothing. Not a single thing matched that he could have possibly caught from anywhere or anyone. It's like his body had just decided to shut down out of nowhere. It bugged me, but there was nothing to do except wait for Rick to get better.

The week that followed was hard. I wouldn't claim that I had it harder than Rick, but I struggled. If three days on my own had made me so thoroughly uncomfortable after a decade of inseparability from my best friend, then I wasn't looking forward to spending what eventually became weeks that way. I had work and school, so I couldn't visit Rick often, which only added to my loneliness.

He never read any of my texts, much less answered them. We called a few times, but those calls always left me feeling hollow inside. His voice was a poor replacement for his friendship. I had never been the type to wear earrings, but I started wearing the studs he'd gotten me for my eighteenth birthday a couple of years back — they were pure silver, and gleamed even when there wasn't much light. It's just a shame that I can't wear them now.

What really bothered me at the time was that Rick wasn't getting better. Whatever he'd caught, it was not a common cold, whatever Rick's dad said. The guy was a neat freak who my mom — who had a degree in psychology that proved its worth every day while she worked as a lifeguard at the pool — liked to joke with about the OCD diagnosis she knew he'd get if he saw a professional, which he refused to; any kind of illness of the mind or body set him off. It was why he was sleeping in the car while his son worked through this sickness.

About two weeks into my new status quo, I encountered him again. Or, rather, it. It had filled out a little in the time since I'd seen it last, and it moved with even more strength and liquid agility than it had had before. It moved like a shadow upon the ground, gliding more than stepping.

The Shadow had not emerged from an alley this time, it hadn't stepped out from the darkness. One second, I had been alone on the streets of the city while making my way home in the middle of the night, and the next, the Shadow was there. I made an abrupt left turn as soon as I could without missing a step, not looking where I was going. I had no destination in mind. All I wanted was to not be alone with it.

I glanced back a few steps past the turn and found the Shadow gliding around the corner. It was much closer than it had been mere seconds ago when I had taken my eyes off of it, and that caused my heart to leap up into my throat. I stifled a gasp and picked up my pace a little, because I suddenly got a much better look than I ever had before. My eyes had met the Shadow's, empty and whiter even than its papery skin, which was not as tight around its skull and throat than it had been last time, which I noticed at the same time as the faint pale shine of bone jutting out from between its lips.

Bone. No, not bone. Teeth.

Prickly dread flashed through me like ice in my veins, and I came to another realization; the Shadow wasn't gaining on me, wasn't catching up — it was keeping pace with me.

That was when I realized the Shadow was dangerous. I had been so at ease, so comfortable in my life, that even when a danger had entered my life the first time I spotted the Shadow following us, I had ignored it and carried on with my night. The next turn I made was another left, taken at the nearest available opportunity. As soon as I rounded the corner I started sprinting down the street and looked for any small space that I could tuck myself into so that I could hide. Unfortunately, there were none. I cursed my luck and begged my aching legs to move faster, but I'd just gotten off a longer shift than usual and was just about dead on my feet.

When I glanced back to see whether or not the Shadow was following me, my heart skipped a beat. It wasn't behind me. While my back was still turned away from the direction in which I was running — which was back the way I had originally been walking after leaving work after making two left turns — I stumbled backwards into what felt like a brick wall. I bounced on impact and fell forward onto my hands and knees.

The back of my head, which had struck his exposed chest — his clothes were in an even worse state than ever — burned the way that touching cold metal burns. Looking back, I was met with the towering figure of the Shadow. It had never been close enough to me before for me to properly gauge its height, but it had to be six and a half feet tall. As I scrambled to my feet and backed away from it as it looked down at me with pale, white eyes that almost glowed in the moonlight, I realized another thing.

The Shadow couldn't be human. It had crossed a hundred feet in a second without a sound. The damned thing didn't even look like it breathed, that's how perfectly still it was when it wasn't moving, so I didn't think it had ever risked becoming out of breath through such a physical feat.

It could have caught me at any time. Even aside from that, running into it at full speed had felt like crashing into the ground! It hadn't budged an inch. Whoever this person was, if it was a person, was no mere man. Panic flashed through me like a lightning bolt and I turned to run, panting hard as I pushed my body to the limit in a snap decision that hadn't really been much of a choice at all. I was in the hands of my fight or flight response then, and my body chose to flee.

I ran right across the road without checking if it was safe to cross, and almost got pulverized by a car that narrowly missed me by three feet or less. The headlights blinded me for a second, but when I fell on my ass in the middle of the road and stared back the way I'd come and blinked spots out of my eyes, I saw clearly that the Shadow's head turned to follow the car that had nearly killed me slide to a stop halfway through the intersection.

It turned back to me and my skin prickled with the heavy anticipation of death as my eyes met its own. The driver, whose hands shook in trembling fists, approached me from where he left his car door hanging open and asked me if I was alright. I glanced at him and told him that I was alright, but when I looked back at where the Shadow had been, almost taunting me with its casual demeanor, it was gone. Only the dark of the night remained where it had stood.

I got a cab home from right there on the street, from the spot that I refused to move from without some form of protection from the Shadow.

The guy who'd almost hit me with his car must have felt really guilty for almost killing some random girl out of nowhere, because he stayed with me the whole time and seemed curious and worried about what a young woman was doing running through the city with such recklessness that she'd almost get herself hit by a moving vehicle. I told him that I had a stalker, and figured it was close enough to the truth that I could get some protection before my cab got there. The Shadow had only left after another person had shown up. Was it scared of getting caught? Somehow I thought it was something else.

When I got home, I didn't mention what happened to my parents right away. In the morning, I only told them what I had told the man who'd stayed with me after the Shadow had disappeared. I had a stalker, and I didn't particularly want to be leaving the house knowing that some creep was out there waiting for me to be alone so it could do whatever the hell it wanted to me. I had no idea what the Shadow might have even wanted from me, since its non-humanity was certain in my mind by then, but my parents certainly had a hunch.

I was thus glad to receive what they called a 'benevolent grounding', happy to be stuck in the house while my parents had me call the police and give them a statement when they showed up shortly after. They said they'd keep in contact if they found the Shadow using my description of him as a guide. I didn't mention its eyes, or its overwhelming physical abilities.

I got the feeling that they'd laugh at me if I told them that the man stalking me had purely white eyes that shone in the moonlight and could move faster than I suspected any human could. I didn't know exactly what the Shadow was, but I wanted to find out. My first idea for getting information also happened to be the one person that I wanted to see more than anything at that time.

It took a few days to convince them that nothing bad would happen if I went over to Rick's, though the only thing that got them to agree to it was my acceptance of a bodyguard; my father, who liked to think he was tough because he used to be military, but only had a medal and a limp to show for it. Another of his demands was that he got to finally crack open the safe he hid under their bed and carry the gun he kept in there the whole time we were out of the house.

In those few days, I didn't go to school or work. I had my homework delivered by trusted friends, and I got all my shifts at the coffee shop covered for the foreseeable future. A deep cringing shame overwhelmed me the entire time that my dad and I walked the empty suburban streets. Despite that, I was just as anxious as he was, looking over my shoulder and walking quickly. We made it to Rick's place in record time after setting out just as the sun was dipping below the horizon, so that we'd be home in time for dinner.

Nancy answered the door again, and in the second before her whole face changed when she realized who was at her door, I saw clear as day the despair that had made her expression stony and dark. She let us in without a word, and hugged both of us so tight that I thought she might've become so depressed that she'd flipped and become manic and decided to strangle me. When I was free from her iron grip, I excused myself to talk to Rick and started down the hallway. That was, until Nancy called out with a shaky voice and her mania seemed to break, leaving her to plummet back to depression in an instant.

""Wait!"" she cried before realizing she'd yelled and taking a deep breath that seemed to soothe her. ""Ricky's not well, honey. I mean, you knew that, but … I don't think he's in the mood for visitors.""

It took me a moment to recover from the feeling of being slapped in the face. ""Why not?""

""He …"" Nancy struggled with the words. Her legs started shaking, and my dad guided her over to the sofa in their living room where they both sat. When she could collect herself, Nancy explained. ""I don't quite know how to say this."" She laughed, but it was a hollow sound. ""Emily, could you please sit?""

""No,"" I said roughly, fighting the tears that wanted to form in my eyes. I'd never liked getting emotional. When Rick and I had first met, he'd been one of my few classmates back then to not make fun of me for being an overly emotional girl. ""What's wrong with him? Why can't he tell me himself?""

Nancy's breath came in shaky huffs of air as she too began to tear up. My parents had always joked that they, both of them being fairly stoic people, had never taught her that little habit of getting worked up easily, and instead I'd learned it from Nancy, since I was over at her house so often. ""He's sleeping right now, but he's become … particular … in his taste in company.""

When I stared at her in a silent demand for more, she averted her eyes from mine and stared at the carpet underneath her feet. ""When we got the doctor down here to look at him, something happened to Ricky. He got mad, or maybe scared, and acted out until the poor man left without figuring out what was wrong with him. Every doctor since then has gone through that same thing. He just lashes out. He's stronger than he looks, too — especially now — so when he gets violent …"" She paled at even the memory.

Only one thought came to me at that moment. What in the world? ""That's insane. Do you need to get the cops down here or what?"" I asked.

My turbulent emotions had died down and I had become strangely calm; the shock of hearing all that had driven the sadness away and replaced it with sheer disbelief. The Rick I'd known hadn't been violent. Mostly because he'd never had the muscle mass to be really dangerous. As that thought crossed my mind, I made a connection, though I really, really didn't want it to be true. My suspicion was a crazy thing to just pitch to two rational, normal people, though, so I took a moment to decide on what I wanted to do about it.

I ended up deciding to just walk away from Nancy and my dad and march down the hallway toward Rick's room. I had to see for myself. At that moment, I didn't particular care if whatever he had was contagious or not. His door was already off its hinges when I arrived, and I stood staring at it for a moment before the smell hit me for the second time, all the way out in the hall. It was worse this time. The same odor of sweat and Rick's unwashed body hung in the air, worsened with time, but there was a metallic undercurrent to it this time, the bitter stench of iron that warned me of what I would find in there before I even stepped inside.

Within the bedroom it was entirely dark, the curtains drawn and the window closed, and this time I did gag when I got far enough in that sweat and bodily fluids and blood was all that I sensed, so foul and rancid that my knees weakened and I had to stop to recover my balance. I turned his overhead light on and bathed the room in yellowish light that illuminated the scene that will stick in my memory forever.

Rick wasn't anywhere to be seen. A slurry that was more solid than liquid stained the carpet, red and yellow mixed into orange bile that steamed heavily and filled the room with its sickening aroma. The room was cold, so cold that my breath misted in front of my face. His window must have been opened finally, but it did nothing for the smell. There was rotten meat somewhere judging by the stench, and the buzzing of flies that I couldn't see, and I held my breath as I pushed further into the room to find it.

A sound that could not have been made by a person made me jump as it echoed slightly from the bathroom attached to Rick's bedroom. The door was closed, and I was hesitant to destroy the memory of first coming to this house and marveling at how Rick had his own private bathroom when I didn't at home, but I walked over and gripped the doorknob tightly as it stung my hand from the cold, just like the Shadow's skin. That reminder pushed me to action even faster.

The smell of rotten meat and blood were only made worse by opening the door. There Rick was, hunched over his toilet and retching, making that awful, ear-splitting noise that had made my whole body erupt with goosebumps. When I screamed, his whole body turned toward me so fast that a cracking sound came from his neck or back, I don't know which. Red stained his lips and chin, and ran down his neck to soak his chest, which was just as bare as the last time we'd seen each other.

He suddenly lurched again, and turned back to vomit up a gush of thick, dark blood that dripped from his tongue and lips slowly, as if partially congealed. He breathed wetly, his gasps causing him to choke on more of that thick, chunky blood that must have still been caught in his throat. Another heaving retch later, and something solid fell into the bowl beneath him, which made my blood run just as cold as his must be — what he threw up didn't steam at all.

""Em,"" his rasping, flat voice said. He spoke as if it hurt to speak. His eyes caught mine, and I screamed again, but not because of the fresh blood that dripped down his stained face and chest, which was just as dark and clotted as the old blood. I screamed because when I met his eyes, what I saw was not his usual blue pair of bright, happy eyes.

Rick's eyes were white, paler than pale, empty.

""Emily?"" he asked again, slowly standing with a motion so smooth that you would never be able to tell that he had been literally puking his guts up just a second earlier. He moved with a boneless sort of agility, another trait he now shared with the Shadow. ""You finally came. We've been waiting for you."" He did not smile, but amusement of a sort played across his bloody features.

We. A thrill of fear shot through me, and I moved on pure instinct, taking off out the door to Rick's room and leaping over the unhinged door. My dad was right there when I fled from the bedroom, peering into the room and blocking my way. I crashed into him and we both went staggering down the hallway, but while my mind was consumed with thoughts and fears of the Shadow and what Rick's resemblance to him might have meant, it was a comfort to know that others around me were not like them.

My dad put himself in front of me instantly, and he didn't flinch when Rick's white body emerged from the empty doorframe with an almost slithering grace. Rick's light, bouncing steps brought him a few feet away from my dad and I, and we kept stumbling backwards as he approached slowly with a grim focus on his face.

""Hello, sir,"" Rick said, and he almost sounded like himself, but there was still a breathless rasp to his voice that marked him as different. ""You mind if we talk to Emily alone for a bit? We have a lot to catch her up on.""

""Jesus Christ, kid!"" my dad yelled, putting his hand out in front of him so that there was something between him and Rick. ""You ought to see a doctor.""

""No more doctors!"" Rick roared as he surged forward with serpentine agility. He lurched and tackled my dad, who was still built like a brick wall even ten years after being forced into an early retirement due to the bullet a crazy squad-mate of his had put in his leg in a fit of psychosis, or so they said. They fell to the floor, Rick crouching over my dad's fallen body, and pushed me down the hallway in the process so that I spilled out onto the floor in view of Nancy, who stood and shook like a leaf at the sight of her boy.

As I stood and put as much distance between Rick and myself, dragging Nancy along with me as I backed up against the front door, a window caught my attention at the corner of my eye. I didn't yet know the significance of why the Shadow had only ever appeared at night, but I remembered that Rick had sounded almost scared of the sun when I'd seen him last, so I figured the kind of thing they were — because they sure as hell weren't human — didn't just prefer the darkness, but actively avoided the light. As soon as half a plan formed in my head, though, I noticed that all that remained of the sunlight had faded to a dull orange halo around the horizon as the sun had just minutes ago set for good.

""Don't you see us?"" Rick said flatly, walking with a posture that showed off how thin he had really become since I'd seen him last. His bones showed through his thin, tight skin, and his shorts hung off him so loosely that they might have fallen off at any moment with some bad luck. His stomach was entirely concave, empty of innards that he had purged in the bathroom mere moments ago

 Rick's chest did not rise and fall with the rhythm of breath.

He held his arms out and smiled — his skin was pulled so taught against his ribs that I expected them to pierce through — but his eyes were still that same flat, pale white, empty of the humor that had filled his home, his life, just weeks ago. ""No more pain. No more doctors. We will never need a doctor again.""

Rick turned his back on Nancy and I quickly, and looked back at my dad, who'd forced himself to his knees; getting to his feet from the ground was a thing of the past. His gun, sleek and black, pointed right at Rick's chest, and even though his whole body shook, his hands were still. ""Stand down, son. We can help you, alright? You just need to stand down.""

When Rick moved faster than I'd ever seen a person move before, my dad opened fire. It didn't even look like Rick took any steps, he simply appeared behind my dad as if he hadn't bothered with the distance between them at all. My dad fired three rounds. One impacted the window with the loud sound of shattering glass.

Another flew right by my head with a whizzing noise that I didn't process until I realized my face had suddenly become very wet with the red stench of metallic blood, and Nancy collapsed back onto the door behind us with a gasp that turned into a hacking cough as her lungs filled with blood.

The third came when my dad must have felt Rick's hands on the back of his head and aimed his gun so that the bullet sailed right through Rick's neck through to the crown of his skull.

Fresh, dark red soaked Rick's entire front and splattered on the wall and ceiling behind him and above. A lot of that red coated my dad's head and shoulders and back. He tried to move away from Rick, to free himself from the grip that only tightened upon getting shot, but those hands were iron and he couldn't pry them off of the sides of his head, untangled those fingers from his shoulder-length hair. Rick's face, which was only intact due to the angle at which the bullet had blown through his brain, contorted in rage and sadness.

""Know this, Frank,"" Rick whispered, his words causing congealed blood to ooze out of his neck wound even faster. ""We regret spilling blood without feeding. We only want to talk. You did this to yourselves.""

Rick's hands moved as though he experienced no resistance from my dad's spine and neck muscles. He twisted my father's head around so quickly and effortlessly that he must have died before his body even jerked and fell to the ground, his chest slumped into the carpet and his lifeless eyes looking up at Rick as the remnant of breath caught in his twisted throat.

I screamed again and looked between my dad, dead or dying on the ground with his neck broken, Nancy, bleeding out and shaking as she drowned in her own blood that was quickly soaking into the welcome mat under my feet, and Rick, who seemed no worse for wear after having his brains blasted out of his skull and throwing up all his insides. He was well and truly empty inside, just like those pale eyes that regarded me without emotion as he once again slowly approached with his almost feline gait.

""What are you?"" I screamed as tears streaked down my face. I had come here hoping for answers, but had only gotten blood, and more questions to boot. Trembling where I stood backed up against the front door to Rick's home, I finally broke. ""Stop it! Please, Rick!""

That gave him pause. His dark, thick blood, the blood of a man long dead, flooded down his legs and began sinking into the carpet as he stopped in his approach. ""We are Rick."" He said it like he didn't even really know. ""We remember being Rick.""

""Do you …"" I hesitated to ask, now that I had a shot. My body refused to stop shaking, which didn't help. ""Do you remember how you became … us?""

His empty eyes could have been looking at me or past me for all I knew. ""When we were Rick, we were walking in the night. Night is dangerous, the night hides many things best left unseen and unsaid."" Watching a person talk without having to stop to breathe was uncanny; it gave him a bizarre speaking rhythm, almost like he was trying to force as many words out as quickly as he could, but he never ran out of time. ""A shadow passing in the night. The other us. The one we were before we were us.""

""The Shadow,"" I stammered. It was the first time I had said it out loud. ""He came after me again the other day. Did you know that?""

Rick was silent for a moment before speaking again, almost like he was thinking, though I don't know how that was possible with his brain painting the walls of the home we had both loved once. ""No. The other us knows things that the other us does not share. That comes with being the first us.""

""The other you tried to kill me!"" I shouted. The more I learned, the more I saw, the more my fear transformed into rage. ""You're supposed to be my friend!""

""We are your friend, Emily,"" Rick said with an imitation of a smile. ""We would like to keep being friends if possible. That is why we have an offer for you.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""You want me to be like you?""

""Yes. We remember being Rick. We know that we were fond of you, and you of us. If we were all us, we could be together. Forever,"" Rick said, holding out his blood-covered hand to me and putting on that fake, empty smile. That smile exposed the pointed ends of teeth that had become sharper than knives.

Clarity filled my mind like a light bulb being switched on. Rick was gone, and this thing wearing his face might have remembered being him, but it clearly didn't remember well enough. Rick and I had been best friends, sure, and received more than our fair share of teasing given that we had been a boy and girl going through the growing pains of puberty together, but our relationship had never been the way everyone thought. We'd been friends to the end. The only feeling I had left for this hollow mimicry of my best friend was regret that I hadn't been with Rick when the end had come sometime in the last two weeks. What stood before me was the Shadow, talking through his mouth, seeing through his pale eyes, making him dance on invisible strings.

I tried to turn and open the door at my back, but the instant my back was to him, Rick's hands, colder than ice, took me by the shoulders and stopped me in my tracks. ""You will see. When you are us, you will see as we do."" The air around my neck grew colder as his head tilted as if to kiss the soft flesh of my throat, and it was at this moment that I realized what Rick had truly become.

""No!"" I screamed, but I had no power to resist his inhumanly strong grip.

His teeth punctured my skin with ease, many sharpened points slicing through my flesh like a hot knife through butter, except they were cold, as cold as his skin. My neck and shoulders were flooded with an indescribable cold that seeped through my muscles right down to the bone as his lips closed over the wounds, and he began to drink up the bright red blood that I could feel his freezing, slimy tongue seeking as it lapped against my warm skin.

I writhed against him, trying to pull my head and neck away from his, and to my surprise, it worked. He screamed and lurched away from me so fast and hard that his feet left the ground and he tumbled over the sofa, collapsing on the floor in a boneless heap.

When he rose to his feet again, Rick's flesh was smoking and melting away from the bone, the skin around that spot on his cheek was blackened and charred. I stared at him like an idiot before realizing what must have happened and taking the silver earrings out of my ears and clenching my fist around them. I resigned myself to what I had to do. Friends to the end.

When he leapt at me again with his mouth open and wet with my blood — I didn't even feel the burn of being bitten; it must have been that numbing cold — I let him tackle me to the floor between our dead parents and when the angle was right, I shoved the earrings into his mouth and used the bullet hole in his neck as a handhold to force his mouth shut, even though it didn't really work.

He screamed, and smoke and dark, thick blood spilled from his lips and made me splutter and cough. He rolled onto his back and clawed at his mouth, but he couldn't seem to spit it out. When he screamed again, with another waft of black smoke, I got a glimpse of the earrings melted into the roof of his mouth. The smell of cooking flesh filled the air as he thrashed around and smoke began to pour from that neck wound, and the back of his ruined head, and his nose.

Rick went limp after a while of struggling, though the burning continued. Whatever had been keeping him alive must not have been able to fight off the silver, and soon his head was a flaming ball of charred meat. Sometime after the fire had consumed his head but before it spread to his body, I felt something akin to a string snapping, a connection that ran from me to him breaking. I also felt that same thing to something outside. That was a mere moment before the door rattled, something heavy and powerful pounding against it as if intended to knock it right off its hinges. I had no doubt that it could. I went to the door on weak legs and prayed that my suspicion about what Rick was had been correct before opening the door.

The Shadow towered over me in silence, and did not attack. He stood a few steps out from the threshold of the house, and peered in with those empty eyes that had likely seen more than anyone could in one lifetime. ""I see that my thrall has met death after all."" It spoke as if it didn't even truly care about that. ""Very well.""

""So that's it?"" I asked, a little bit breathless as I recovered from the shock of hearing the Shadow actually talk.

""What is done is done,"" it said, its deep voice filling the silent night outside.

""Am I going to turn into a vampire now, or what?"" I said shrilly as I gestured to the wound on my neck. The Shadow regarded me for a moment with its empty eyes and then turned to leave. ""Answer me!"" I didn't dare go outside and meet it on its turf, and watched as the figure melted into a shadow behind Rick's dad's car and vanish. Rick's dad was asleep in the car, his limp body slumped against the steering wheel. I hoped he was asleep.

That was last night. I spent today in Rick's room with the curtains drawn, writing this, because I don't know how much longer I'll have before my fingers and limbs start locking up. Looking up the effects of rigor mortis knowing that it'll be happening to me soon wasn't fun. I already feel cold, and it doesn't matter how many blankets I cover myself with, it's never enough. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I do know that if I survive the change as myself, I'll have the freedom to choose, at least. Killing Rick broke the bond that I would've had with the Shadow, too.

At least there's that.",1,1769921131.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1qsotw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DailyDoseCoolFinds/comments/1qsotw3/tired_of_fake_deals_heres_my_honest_process_for/,Tired of fake deals? Here's my honest process for finding *actual* savings online after months of testing (saved $250+ on household essentials this quarter) 💸,"I don't know about you, but I'm absolutely fed up with seeing ""70% off!"" sales that are barely 20% off the *real* pre-inflated price. Or those ""limited-time offers"" that seem to be ""limited"" to every single day for a month. It's exhausting trying to sift through the noise to find something genuinely good, and frankly, a waste of time.

That's why a few of us started **r/DailyDoseCoolFinds**. We're not about marketing fluff; we're about sharing actual findings after doing a bit of digging and price comparison. Think of it as a small group of friends trying to save each other some cash without the BS.

Here are a few recent examples of the kind of stuff we've shared, based on real price checks and personal experience:

*   **A well-regarded ergonomic office chair:** We found this for **$280** on a flash sale, down from its usual **$450-500** retail price. That's a solid **38-44% off** for a chair that consistently gets good reviews and is built to last. It required a specific coupon code and watching inventory closely, but the savings were worth the quick action.
*   **Quality merino wool socks (3-pack):** Regularly around **$25-30**, we found a brand offering them for **$16** during an unadvertised clearance. Great for hiking or just keeping warm without breaking the bank. These deals often come up seasonally.
*   **Smart home security camera:** A popular model that often hovers around **$80-90** dipped to **$55** during a short Amazon warehouse deal. These deals go fast and often have limited stock, but if you're quick, the savings are real for an open-box item in ""like new"" condition.
*   **Premium coffee beans:** We often highlight small roasters or bulk deals where you can get specialty beans for closer to **$10-12/lb** instead of the typical **$18-20/lb** in a grocery store. It's not always a 'deal' in the traditional sense, but knowing where to consistently buy better quality for less *is* a cool find in our book.

Now, let's be real: finding these isn't always instant. It takes a bit of patience, some price history checking, and sometimes you need to act relatively quickly before stock runs out or the coupon expires. We also try to flag things like regional availability, potential shipping delays, or if a deal might require a membership (like Prime or Costco). The goal isn't to buy stuff you don't need, but to help you get what you *do* need at a genuinely good price.

So, if you're tired of scrolling through endless fake discounts and want actual, vetted finds where people share their own experiences and price checks, consider following **r/DailyDoseCoolFinds**. We test products, compare prices, and share what's *actually* worth it, not just what some marketing team wants you to buy.",1,1769921055.0,DailyDoseCoolFinds,0,1.0,False

Your host Kottei-Ryo here, today's fun plan is... Kidnapping Dino from the hospital and tossing him to The Lands Between to see how long he survives there for!

But since I am not all evil, I'm gonna give him something incredible!

I did some research and hesitant ako sa vendo machine piso wifi since I am not technical in case masira ito. Then I saw a tutorial that is also piso wifi but no slot machine but uses voucher (gaya ng mga sa coffee shop). The instructions is pretty straightforward basta may pc ka and mas mura raging from 4k-6k. My question is meron napo ba gumagawa nitong business nato sa inyo and advised if mas okay to kaysa sa vendo type. Cons nakikita ko is need may bantay since need ibigay manually yung voucher.
