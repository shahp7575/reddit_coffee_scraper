Victor wasn’t holding back anymore.

I could see it in the stiff lines of Ethan’s shoulders, the way he paced his office like a caged animal, the tension in his jaw that never seemed to ease. Whatever mask of civility Victor had worn before was gone, replaced with bold, calculated strikes aimed directly at Ethan’s career.

It started with whispers—academic rumors swirling through the university about misattributed sources in Ethan’s research. Then came the emails.

“They’re accusing me of fabricating evidence,” Ethan said, his voice sharp as he slammed his laptop shut. The sound made me jump. He ran a hand through his hair, his frustration radiating off him in waves. “Do you have any idea what that does to someone in my field?”

I sat across from him, my heart breaking at the raw anger in his voice. “We’ll fight this,” I said softly.

“How?” Ethan snapped, then immediately shook his head, guilt flashing across his face. “I’m sorry, Livia. I didn’t mean that.”

“I know,” I said, standing. I crossed the room and placed a hand on his arm, feeling the tension thrumming beneath his skin. “But you’re not fighting this alone. Whatever Victor’s doing, we’ll stop him.”

Ethan let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. “He’s not just attacking my career. He’s tearing apart everything I’ve built—everything I’ve worked for. And he’s doing it so well that people are actually starting to believe him.”

I tightened my grip on his arm, grounding him. “We’ll prove he’s lying. We’ll find the proof.”

He looked at me then, his eyes softening, but the doubt lingered. “What if we can’t?”

“We will,” I said firmly, meeting his gaze. “Because I believe in you, Ethan. And because we don’t have another option.”

Victor’s attacks escalated faster than I thought possible. Within days, formal complaints had been filed against Ethan, triggering a review of his recent publications. Anonymous sources claimed Ethan had falsified records, fabricated data, and plagiarized entire sections of his work.

The accusations were as vicious as they were unfounded, but they were enough to tarnish Ethan’s reputation. The once-respected historian now faced whispers in every corridor, cautious glances from colleagues he’d once considered friends.

“I know Victor’s behind this,” Ethan said one evening, his voice tight with frustration as he sifted through another stack of paperwork. “But he’s covering his tracks too well.”

“We’ll figure it out,” I said, though the weight of his words pressed heavily on my chest.

But the truth was, I didn’t know if we would.

A breakthrough came when Ethan’s university email was hacked. Dozens of fabricated messages were sent out, painting Ethan as desperate and unprofessional. The emails accused him of everything from stealing ideas to sabotaging other researchers.

“I didn’t write any of this,” Ethan said, his voice trembling with fury as he stared at the screen.

I leaned over his shoulder, reading the messages with growing horror. They were calculated, laced with just enough truth to make them believable.

“This is Victor,” I said quietly.

Ethan exhaled sharply, pushing the laptop away. “Of course it’s Victor. But how do I prove it when he’s hiding behind anonymity?”

“We start digging,” I said, standing. “If Victor’s involved, he’ll slip up eventually. And when he does, we’ll be ready.”

It took days of meticulous work, but eventually, we found the thread that tied everything together. Ethan’s IT department traced the fabricated emails to an external server registered under an alias. The owner of that alias? Victor Hayes.

“This is it,” Ethan said, his voice quiet but resolute as he stared at the evidence in front of us. “This is the proof we need.”

For a moment, I felt relief—a flicker of hope that we could finally expose Victor for what he was. But it didn’t last.

Because if I’d learned anything from the regressions, it was that Victor never stopped at sabotage.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The weight of everything—Sebastian’s betrayal, Victor’s calculated attacks, the pressure Ethan was under—pressed down on me like a heavy blanket.

When I finally drifted off, the dreams came for me again.

I was in the garden, the air thick with the scent of roses. Sebastian stood before me, his expression a mix of determination and fear.

“They’ll come for me,” he said, his voice low. “But they won’t stop there, Isabelle. They’ll come for you too.”

I shook my head, tears stinging my eyes. “We’ll stop them. We’ll find a way.”

Sebastian’s gaze softened, but his smile was tinged with sadness. “Sometimes, fighting isn’t enough. Sometimes, you have to be willing to lose everything to protect what matters most.”

His words followed me as I woke, the weight of them lingering in my chest.

When I arrived at Ethan’s office the next morning, he was already there, hunched over his desk with a cup of coffee growing cold beside him. He looked up when I walked in, and the exhaustion in his eyes made my heart ache.

“Victor’s not going to stop, is he?” I asked quietly.

Ethan shook his head. “No. But neither will I.”

I crossed the room, stopping just in front of him. “Then we fight.”

Ethan’s gaze softened, his hand reaching out to brush against mine. “Together?”

“Always,” I said, my voice steady.

For the first time in days, Ethan smiled—a small, fleeting thing, but it was enough to remind me why we were fighting in the first place.

-------------------------------------------------------

When considering a new home in Kentucky, you might want to explore the modern trend of barndominiums. These unique structures blend the rustic charm of barns with the comforts of a traditional home. Barndominium kits are becoming increasingly popular for various reasons, making them a great option for those looking to build in the Bluegrass State.

### Cost-Effectiveness

One of the most appealing benefits of barndominium kits in Kentucky is their cost-effectiveness. Compared to traditional homes, barndominiums can be built at a lower price point. This is partly due to the simple design and efficient use of materials.

- Lower material costs: Steel and metal components are often less expensive than conventional wood framing.
- Less labor-intensive: The straightforward design can reduce labor costs significantly.
- Energy efficiency: Barndominiums are often more energy-efficient, which can lower monthly utility bills.

### Customization Options

Barndominium kits offer an incredible range of customization options. You can design everything from the layout to the finishes. This flexibility allows you to create a home that perfectly suits your lifestyle.

- Open floor plans: Many kits provide an open concept, making the space feel larger and more inviting.
- Exterior finishes: Choose from a variety of siding materials to fit your aesthetic preferences.
- Interior designs: Customize your kitchen, bathrooms, and living spaces according to your taste.

### Durability and Low Maintenance

When you invest in a barndominium kit, you choose durability. The materials used in these kits, particularly metal, are built to withstand the extremes of Kentucky weather. This translates to less maintenance over the years.

- Weather-resistant: Metal roofs handle heavy rain and snow better than shingles.
- Termite-proof: Unlike wood, metal is not susceptible to termite damage.
- Longevity: A well-constructed barndominium can last for decades, reducing the need for frequent repairs.

### Versatile Spaces

Barndominiums are not just homes; they can accommodate various lifestyles. Whether you need a workspace, a hobby area, or room for your family, these structures are incredibly versatile.

- Home offices: Create a dedicated workspace separate from living areas.
- Workshops: Have tools and equipment for hobbies or side businesses without taking up household space.
- Guest accommodations: Include extra bedrooms for visitors or family members in town.

### Connection with Nature

Living in a barndominium often means being closer to nature. Many choose to build these kits on rural land or large lots, allowing for serene, peaceful surroundings. You can enjoy your property with excellent outdoor spaces such as:

- Large porches: Perfect for sipping coffee and enjoying the view.
- Gardens: Grow your vegetables and herbs right on your property.
- Open fields: Excellent for recreational activities or simply enjoying the great outdoors.

### Community and Lifestyle

Many folks in Kentucky are already embracing the barndominium lifestyle. By choosing this type of home, you are joining a community that appreciates simplicity, functionality, and a love for the outdoors. You can connect with like-minded individuals who value sustainable living and hands-on projects.

### Financing Options

Exploring financing options is essential when considering a barndominium kit. Fortunately, many lenders are becoming more familiar with this trend, offering financing that suits your needs.

- Construction loans: Some banks offer specialized loans for building barndominiums.
- Personal loans: If you have the cash for materials, personal loans can help cover labor costs.
- VA loans: Veterans may find that VA loans can be applied to barndominiums, allowing easier access to financing.

Exploring the options available for barndominium kits in Kentucky can lead you to a rewarding investment in both your quality of life and financial future. Whether you want to save money, customize your living space, or live closer to nature, barndominiums offer diverse benefits that can enhance your lifestyle in the beautiful state of Kentucky.

Key Considerations for Choosing Barndominium Kits for Your Kentucky Home
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you considering building a barndominium in Kentucky? You've come to the right place! Choosing the right kit for your new home can be exciting yet overwhelming. There are quite a few key considerations to keep in mind to make the process smoother and more enjoyable.

First and foremost, think about your budget. Barndominium kits come in various price ranges, and knowing what you can spend will help narrow down your options. Consider not only the cost of the kit itself but also any additional expenses like land, permits, and utilities. This way, you can make an informed decision without unexpected financial burdens later on.

Next, evaluate the size and layout of the barndominium kit. Determine how much space you need based on your lifestyle. Are you planning to accommodate a large family or just yourself? Do you want an open floor plan for entertaining or separate rooms for privacy? No matter your preference, you should ensure that the dimensions of the kit will work for your vision. A good rule of thumb is to create a floor plan that meets your daily needs while allowing for some flexibility in the future.

Don’t forget to consider location. Kentucky's weather varies, and different regions have their climate challenges. Make sure the barndominium kit you choose can withstand the elements of your specific area. Look for features like insulated walls and sturdy roofing materials that provide energy efficiency and durability. You want a structure that will keep you comfortable year-round.

When looking at barndominium kits, the quality of materials is crucial. You wouldn’t want to invest in a beautiful house only for it to wear down after a few years. Research the suppliers and manufacturers to ensure they use high-quality steel and sustainable materials. Reviews from previous customers can guide you on which companies provide the best products. Good materials will extend the life of your home and save you money on repairs down the line.

One essential factor that is often overlooked is customization. While some kits offer a basic design, others allow for more flexibility in layout and finishes. If you have specific tastes or needs, seek a kit that accommodates your customization desires. You could personalize your kitchen, bathrooms, or even the exterior to make your home truly yours.

Next, consider the assembly process. Some barndominium kits come with detailed instructions and all necessary parts, while others may require additional tools or professional help to put together. Think about your DIY skills and whether you plan to build it yourself or hire contractors. Knowing the complexity of assembly will help you plan for either option and avoid potential delays.

Also, evaluate whether the kits are designed for easy upgrades. As your family grows, you might want to add rooms, garages, or other amenities. Consider purchasing a kit that allows for these upgrades in the future. This flexibility is vital for keeping your home functional as your needs change.

Don’t forget to check local regulations and zoning laws. Different counties in Kentucky may have varying requirements for building a barndominium. Reach out to your local building department to ensure that your plans comply with all regulations. This step will save you from potential legal hassles and unexpected costs.

Choosing the right barndominium kit in Kentucky involves several critical considerations:

- Determine your budget
- Assess the size and layout
- Consider the weather conditions in your area
- Focus on the quality of materials
- Look for customization options
- Evaluate the assembly process
- Check for upgrade capacity
- Understand local regulations

By taking these factors into account, you can find a barndominium kit that fits your lifestyle, budget, and future needs. Happy building!

### Conclusion

Barndominium kits in Kentucky offer a unique opportunity to embrace both style and function in home building. As you explore their benefits, you’ll find that these structures combine the charm of rustic design with modern efficiency. Their durability, energy efficiency, and low maintenance needs make them particularly appealing to homeowners looking to invest wisely in their future. You can enjoy an open-concept living space while still having the flexibility to customize your layout according to your lifestyle.

When considering which barndominium kit to choose, remember that various factors play a crucial role. Assessing your budget, understanding local building codes, and selecting a trustworthy supplier can make a significant difference in your overall experience and satisfaction. Take the time to evaluate your needs and preferences, as these will guide you in finding a kit that fits not just your aesthetic desires, but also your practical requirements.

Ultimately, embarking on the journey of building a barndominium in Kentucky is a fulfilling endeavor. It encourages you to blend your personal touch with the benefits of modern designs and materials. Whether you are looking for a cozy retreat in the countryside or a spacious family home, barndominium kits represent a practical solution that stands the test of time, ensuring you create a place where many joyful memories await. By making informed decisions, your barndominium can become the sanctuary you’ve always dreamed of, all while securing the value of your investment for years to come.",1,1738230642.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False
1idjjzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1idjjzh/carnivore_research_and_findings_i_would_be_glad/,Carnivore Research and Findings - I would be glad to hear any thoughts:,"Hi, I did the research I could not find on Carnivore, and this is my list that helps the skeptic's. The below list is in order of least damaging foods to the human body covering non toxic, non inflammatory and low oxidative items.   
  
I have also commented on why some things are not in the carnivore diet.

The top 17 items are only supported by a carnivore diet, to summarise my findings: 

* **Strict Carnivore:** Meats, organs, seafood, eggs, animal fats, dairy, bone broth.
* **Relaxed Carnivore/Animal-Based:** Fermented foods, Greek yogurt, fish/chicken skin, coffee, tea.
* **Healthy but Less Carnivore-Friendly/Keto:** Avocado, olive oil, low-sugar fruits, some herbs/spices.

**I keep seeing instagrammer;s adding Raw honey, but the the problem with it is:** 

* **High in Sugar (Fructose & Glucose)** – Can cause blood sugar spikes and insulin resistance over time.
* **Glycation & Inflammation** – Excess sugar consumption leads to glycation, which contributes to aging and chronic inflammation.
* **Impact on Gut Health** – While raw honey has some beneficial enzymes and antibacterial properties, its high sugar content can feed harmful bacteria and yeasts in the gut.

**Garlic gets hype too - but dont touch it**

* Garlic is high in fermentable oligosaccharides (FODMAPs), which can cause bloating, gas, or digestive discomfort in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a sensitive gut.
* **Anti-Nutrient Properties**:Like many plants, garlic contains compounds (e.g., lectins, saponins) that may interfere with nutrient absorption, especially if consumed in excessive amounts.
* **Sulfur Compounds**:Garlic contains sulfur-based compounds (like allicin) that give it its characteristic smell and flavor. While these compounds have antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, they can irritate the stomach lining in sensitive individuals or when consumed in large quantities.

**Healthiest:** 

1. **Grass-Fed Meats** Rich in nutrients, omega-3s, CLA, and antioxidants. Higher quality than conventionally raised meats.
2. **Organ Meats** Highly nutrient-dense, providing vitamins and minerals like iron, vitamin A, and B12. Essential for maintaining health on a carnivore diet.
3. **Wild-Caught Fish** Excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, supporting brain, heart, and joint health.
4. **Complete Proteins** Critical for building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function, and enzyme production. Found in meat, eggs, and dairy.
5. **Bioavailable Nutrients (Iron, Zinc, Calcium, Magnesium, Selenium)** Essential for bodily functions, with animal sources being highly bioavailable.
6. **Essential Fats (Saturated and Monounsaturated Fats)** Vital for energy, hormone production, and cellular health. Found in fatty cuts of meat and animal fats.
7. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids** Anti-inflammatory and crucial for overall health, found in fatty fish and grass-fed meats.
8. **Fat-Soluble Vitamins (A, D, E, K2)** Important for vision, bone health, immunity, and reducing inflammation. Highly bioavailable in animal sources.
9. **Vitamin B Complex** Critical for energy metabolism, nervous system health, and red blood cell production. Abundant in animal foods.
10. **Taurine** Important for heart health, brain function, and electrolyte balance. Found in meat and seafood.
11. **Carnitine** Supports fat metabolism and energy production. Found in meat and essential for heart and muscle health.
12. **Choline** Crucial for liver function, brain development, and nervous system health. Found in egg yolks and liver.
13. **Collagen and Gelatin** Important for joint health, skin elasticity, and gut lining. Found in bone broth and connective tissues.

**Supportive for Overall Health:**

1. **Glutamine** An amino acid that supports gut health and immune function, essential for maintaining overall wellness.
2. **Amino Acids (Essential and Non-Essential)** Building blocks of protein, crucial for muscle repair, immune function, and neurotransmitter production.
3. **Glycine** Important for sleep, detoxification, and collagen production, found in connective tissues.
4. **Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)** Found in grass-fed meats and dairy, supports fat loss and reduces inflammation.

***Diets that support these: Carnivore***

**Neutral but Optional:**

1. **Probiotics (Fermented Foods)** Beneficial for gut health, digestion, and immunity, but not a focus on a carnivore diet (except for certain fermented animal products).
2. **Creatine** Enhances energy production, muscle performance, and brain health. Naturally found in meat, may be an additional support for active individuals.

***Diets that support these: Carnivore, Keto***

**Potentially Negative:**

1. **Anti-Inflammatory Properties** While the carnivore diet can have inherent anti-inflammatory effects, additional anti-inflammatory compounds are less necessary.
2. **Polyphenols** While beneficial for some, carnivore proponents argue they are unnecessary, as the body naturally manages oxidative stress.
3. **Antioxidants** The low-carb nature of the carnivore diet reduces oxidative stress, decreasing the need for dietary antioxidants.
4. **Fiber** Often unnecessary on a carnivore diet but not inherently harmful unless consumed in excess by sensitive individuals.

**Diets that support these: Keto, low carb, low calorie, paleo, Mediterranean** 

**Nutrients or Compounds of Concern:**

1. **Omega-6 Fatty Acids** Excess intake leads to chronic inflammation and metabolic issues. Carnivore diet naturally avoids these when focusing on animal fats.
2. **Polyunsaturated Fats (PUFAs)** Found in seed oils, associated with inflammation and oxidative stress.
3. **Sugar (Sucrose)** Not a focus on carnivore diets, but pure sucrose may be seen as less harmful than fructose.
4. **Glutens** Highly inflammatory for those sensitive or intolerant, linked to gut permeability.
5. **Plant Hormones and Estrogen-Mimicking Compounds** Phytoestrogens in plants (like soy) may disrupt endocrine function in high quantities.
6. **Alkaloids** Found in nightshades, may trigger inflammation in sensitive individuals.
7. **Tannins** Can inhibit iron absorption but may be less harmful compared to other anti-nutrients.
8. **Lectins** Anti-nutrients that can impair digestion and disrupt gut barriers.
9. **Saponins** Soap-like compounds that can damage gut linings in sensitive individuals.
10. **Goitrogens** Found in cruciferous vegetables, may interfere with thyroid function in iodine-deficient individuals.
11. **Mold and Mycotoxins** Found in grains, nuts, and plants; can be toxic and harmful to the liver and immune systems.
12. **Additives and Preservatives** Artificial chemicals in processed foods can disrupt gut microbiota and hormonal systems.
13. **Processed Meats** High in sodium, nitrates, and unhealthy fats, potentially leading to cancer risks.
14. **Trans Fats** Found in partially hydrogenated oils and processed foods, linked to heart disease and inflammation.
15. **Artificial Sweeteners** Disrupt gut bacteria, cause cravings, and may have long-term health implications.
16. **High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS)** Contributes to obesity, insulin resistance, and liver fat accumulation.
17. **Dairy (Lactose Intolerance)** Can cause digestive discomfort and inflammation for those sensitive to lactose.
18. **Caffeine (Excessive Consumption)** Excessive intake may lead to insomnia, anxiety, and digestive disruption.
19. **High-Sodium Foods** Excessive sodium intake can lead to high blood pressure and kidney issues.

***Diet - Keto,*** **low carb, low calorie, paleo, Mediterranean*****Average American/UK Diet, Vegetarian, Vegan***

I hope this gives some technical insight into why Carnivore is in my view the best diet for a human for long term health.",1,1738230558.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False

Just a cool looking machine that's more than capable of making quality espresso and milk drinks.

I've only had it for about a week, so I wouldn't consider this a review. Just my experience at this point. I pulled a 1:3 shot in the video at 9 bar. I learned the basics while using my ROK, so dialing in was pretty straight forward. I also pulled a 1:1 and 1:2, both at around 30 seconds, but the lungo was my preference for this roast.

The machine actually sounds louder in the video than in person. It's not whisper quiet, but not annoying. It PRETENDS it's ready to make coffee in about a minute, but for the best cup, I'd suggest waiting until the group head is hot to the touch (10-15 minutes).

It's a thermoblock machine, so switching from brew to steam takes about 45 seconds, and you need to pull a blank shot after steaming to bring the temp back down for brewing again. I was aware of these ""shortcomings"" and aren't a bother to me. But, to each their own.

There's talk that the OPV may be adjustable, but is covered with red goo and will void the warranty if tampered with. Again, I was aware of the lack of easy adjustment, so my feelings aren't hurt there. I like medium roast or darker, and have found that many of the variables being chased make little to no difference with roasts on the darker side, mainly just lighter roasts.

I like the automatic shot/steam timer. Little stuff like that seem so unimportant when watching online reviews, but when you get to play with your new machine it's a whole different experience. And having a pressure gauge is SWEET! I love the basic design of my ROK, but seeing your pressure in real time vs ""feeling"" it is quite satisfying, just in a different way.

From my research, it seems Gemilai is a fairly common brand in SE Asia and the Philippines. The offer commercial machines as well as a whole range of consumer machines. There's just not much talk about the G3006, so I decided to buy the extended warranty and find out for myself! LOL

NOTE: For those curious, I have a df54 grinder, and it's currently set around 23 on the dial. I typically don't do wdt, just a quick level and tamp. I started using a puck screen with this machine to make the process a little cleaner. The ROK is easy to keep SUPER clean without one. I have the pre infusion set to 7 seconds, but there's so little water released that I doubt it makes much difference. I'm sure those details are important to someone. lol

But even indians with sufficient and comfortable incomes prefer to ""settle"" for low quality or unhealthy/unsafe options in most things. They can afford to eat balanced meals with more protein and fruit/veg, but cheap rice remains their staple. They can easily buy comfortable footwear, but will choose cheap sandals that eventually give them foot issues. Can buy skin friendly soap, moisturiser, etc but will buy the harshest chemical skin damaging soap because it costs 30 rupees. Can afford to live in a safe, clean locality but choose a run down, polluted locality because it's cheaper. Quality tea, coffee, snacks etc are available but unhygienic cheap places are preferred.

The younger, more educated generation doesn't quite follow this trend and I suppose it's from them that the demand for quality goods and services originates. 

Note that I'm not commenting on how to spend money on personal preferences like clothing brands, travel, entertainment etc and only things that objectively improve anyone's health and quality of life.

Since then I realized that it is acid reflux and the taste becomes bearable if my stomach is really empty. But the  even drinking water can trigger the taste. 
Today I am going to have the manometry and the pH impedence tests. My question is, how common for that kind if thing to start like this suddenly withou giving any
prior notice. 
I had a very strong before that although I admit I drink coffee corabonated drinks and NSAIDs because of my migraines. It was super strong. 
Is it possible that this reflux thing can start suddenly like that?

For the last 2 years, we have lived nearby her house (about 20 mins drive), and since I have got a new job about 30 minutes away from where we live now. We need to move because my commute is going to be around 2 hours each way. My parents live about 5 hours drive away. My new job is really exciting, and means that we are both set up for life. Our kids will have free private education, and I know I'm going to love the company as I have many friends there already and was recommended for the job. My partner's commute is also going to be halved when we move. When my MIL found out we were moving, her and her husband had words with my partner and made him feel awful about his decision to move. They use money against him (as they have given him money in the past) and have said it wasn't for us to move. I then had a 1-1 chat with his mother, under the guise of it being a ""girls coffee morning"" where his sister was supposed to come but came two hours late, and she said that my commute ""wasn't that bad"" and that we shouldn't be moving, that it is too far from our friends and family (when it's actually closer to my friends and family), and that is a silly decision, that I might not even like the job. I told her about my children getting really private education as part of the package, she replied ""you might not even be able to have children!"". She said when she has given money in the past to my partner, that it was never the intention for my partner to use it on moving. In 3 months, we are getting married. When her daughter got married, there was a big fall out months before the wedding and I fear she is trying to do the same as she is not having everything her way. Over the last few years, she has made other comments regarding my weight, for instance giving me her old clothes and saying they will fit me as they are from her ""bigger days"", when I was looking for a new job she would send me jobs to apply to, and once when my dad came to visit them, she served him rum cake for dessert without telling him or us, and he is a recovering alcoholic. She has never served us rum cake before in our lives. She made a whatsapp group and would send long paragrapghs with instructions for us to do when we are on holiday. When we got engaged, her and her husband flew out 3 days afterwards to be there with us (it was at their house abroad), and the week before she hinted my partner was going to propose by telling me that she expects me to get married in her town (which we are not doing). When I got my new job, she told my partner that I shouldn't get pregnant in my first year there as they wouldn't like that. She also threatened me not to tell my partner about our 1-1 conversation, and texted him frequently immediately after to check that he wasn't upset with her. My partner has dealt with this controlling behaviour for years, but now it is trickling into our relationship. I worry that it will get worse if we don't deal with it now. I worry for our future children that she will be very critical of my parenting style. I fear that she doesn't want us to get married or have children. I know that there is some kind of enmeshment happening here. My partner is very protective of me and wants to have it out with them but I fear that will make things worse right before our very expensive big day. ",56,1738229138.0,AITAH,8,0.98,False

I agreed and since that point on I wake up every morning and clean the house make sure everything is clean. One thing I struggle and hate doing is folding clothes.

However, I planned on doing it tommorow waking up early and doing a deep clean of the house. The part of the story where he calls me lazy is because I’ve been home from work the past two days and been staying in bed all day because I haven’t been feeling good however, I still got up and made him dinner despite how I was feeling because I knew he was upset with me about the laundry situation and felt bad.

I then don’t even sit to eat my food but go straight to the bedroom meanwhile he sits and eats his entire dinner without once checking in on me. I’m so upset and come out the room from crying because I realize someone who won’t check on me isn’t worth my tears I come out the room and he tells me that I have no reason to cry because it’s my fault and if I just did what he asked then we wouldn’t be here. I explained to him that I was going to do it the following day and that I don’t feel good today however, he said he doesn’t believe me that I always have something going on.

He‘s in his mid 30s, I am in my mid 20s. We got along straight away. To be honest, in the beginning I wasn’t that into him because well, I didn’t know him that well but we needed up chatting and calling each other once a month on a daily basis (I was home for summer break and he was back in the city where my university was so we couldn’t meet up for said month). One week before we were supposed to meet he suddenly started texting less. I was confused but ultimately ended up asking him whether we‘d still meet up the day we had arranged before. He said that a woman that he had dated in summer had reached out again and that he was extremely sorry but couldn’t meet two women at the same time (to be fair, he was super nice about it and even wanted to call me and explain it to me). I said that I was really sad but that I‘d understand and asked whether he wanted to meet just as friends. He thought about it for a day and then agreed to meeting. we went on a brunch and it was amazing. WE laughed all the time and he was arranging our next meeting during said brunch. On our next date he kissed me and I then I asked him about the other women. He said he had cut all ties with her after he had first met me. To be fair, all of this sounds like he is a liar but I truly believe him, because he is a very upfront and honest person. It’s just hard to put everything into words cause I am from Sweden and English is not my first language. 
We kept dating for three months and everything went great (well, in my opinion). He suggested dates, concerts and hotels. Until a couple days before Christmas he called me. He said he had gotten under pressure and he felt overwhelmed by the whole situation and needed time. I was bummed since I tried letting him take the lead and tried not being too straight forward even though I was already in love with him by this point. I agreed on giving him time and we said that we‘d be talking about where things might or might not be going after Christmas. He then called me and said he was in a really rough patch right now and that it wasn’t anything about me, he really liked me, but he couldn’t see himself being in a relationship right now. I again said that I was really sorry and whether he could see us being friends or whether he‘d like to be just by himself at this point in his life. He agreed to being friends. It’s been three weeks. We’ve met for dinner and drinks once and he asked me to meet up for coffee next week. We do text, but it’s muss less than before. He shoots a text one day, I reply the next day and so on. 
I do still have feelings for him and I wonder whether meeting him is the right decision. 

I‘d be really glad if you could interpret the situation for me. Do you think there is any chance we could still work out?

Assistant, I have most of Feb. 1 vacant (10AM-5PM). None of my friends, nor my official driver, are available either. I am a bit frail, physically, at the moment, recovering from severe flu and asthma attacks,  so commuting isn't really an option... 

I'm looking for a companion, preferably in her late 30s to late 50s (so we have things in common to tall about), has a car and can drive me around and accompany me, all expenses on me of course. I leave the itinerary up to you, I just have to be at Sam's 21 by 530PM for a formal event. maybe that rules out driving outside the city, maybe we can just have lunch, watch a movie, have coffee, have early dinner. Purely SFW 😊. I'll pay for everything of course, and I'll be happy to compensate you for your time as well.  Wag lang po masyado mahal 😁

1idizn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rosacea/comments/1idizn3/supplements_diet_success/,Supplements & Diet Success,"My rosacea is really well under control and I wanted to share what I have done to make this happen. First of all I cleaned up my diet so I don’t have any processed foods, but I do have all the rosacea triggers like coffee, tomatoes etc.

I did, however, add in the following supplements which could have an effect:

Multivitamins 
Fish oil (2000mg 2x per day)
Vitamin C (1000mg 2x per day)
NAC
Zinc
P5P
Vitamin D & K2

I also take specific strains of probiotics to support my body - notably lactobacillus rhamnosus. In addition I consume regular amounts of fermented foods like kefir and yoghurt as well as sauerkraut. I also make sure I have enough fibre in my diet. 

I begun these dietary changes last year in May and as it takes a while I think it’s only now that I am seeing full results. 

I have rarely seen my skin this settled. I’ve been able to use actives like retinol on it for the first time in a very long time and I am considering switching the Efracea I take to every other day to see if I can stop it completely, although I am unsure as I might get a relapse of ocular rosacea. 

However, my thought is that if the doxycycline works as an anti-inflammatory and I have succeeded in lowering inflammation levels another way perhaps I don’t need it anymore?

I don’t use any topical creams anymore like Soolantra or Metronidazole. As a reminder my diagnosis is Type 1 & 2 with ocular rosacea. 

Maybe some of this might be helpful to someone else who is trying to make changes internally! 

Good luck to anyone who is thinking of this!

I used to work long hours on my feet. I have very well regulated and consistent BMs. No pain or cramping, but IBS-D, so you know the drill. I would go 3-4 times every morning (at work LOL everyone knew my issues) but it was fine.

Recently I’ve started two things:
- a mild reduction in calories (dieting) with about the same proportion of fiber, etc. similar diet, but less food. 
- a remote position with a significant reduction in walking (see first bullet point lol) and SIGNIFICANT reduction in stress. I went from like cpr every day to basically sitting on my ass reading. 

Same cup of coffee, same wake-up time.

My bowels have been AWFUL. It’s 3 am. I just woke up in severe pain and I am unleashing a demon. I have had cramping and horrible gas, constipation/diarrhea - it’s really all over the place. I haven’t had a flare up like this in years!!! 

What gives ??? Do I need to exercise in the morning so I can poop more? Is the sudden drop in adrenaline (I get crazy stress poops at work) causing this issue? is it my reduced food intake? 

Should I go see my doctor? Lol

Thank you for reading my 3am rant. I’m confused.

- Analyzing what services they offer and their pricing structures.

This insight will help you design a unique offering that stands out in your market.

### Set Up Your Composting System

Your composting system will be the heart of your business. Here’s what you need:

Essential Tools and Equipment for Effective Composting
------------------------------------------------------

Composting is a fantastic way to reduce waste and enrich your garden. To make the most of your composting experience, having the right tools and equipment can significantly enhance your efforts. Below is a list of essential items that will help you manage your compost effectively and create nutrient-rich soil amendments.

### Basic Tools for Composting

Starting off, there are some fundamental tools every composter should have:

- **Compost Bin:** Choose a bin that suits your space. Options include tumblers, bins made from wood, or even simply a pile in your backyard. Tumblers speed up the process by aerating the compost as you turn it.
- **Pitchfork or Garden Fork:** This tool is essential for aerating the compost and turning materials to speed up decomposition. Look for one with sturdy tines for effective mixing.
- **Shovel:** A shovel is helpful for transferring finished compost to your garden and moving bulk materials into your bin.
- **Measuring Container:** For balanced compost, you need to ensure you have the right mix of browns and greens. A measuring container, like a bucket, helps you keep track of how much composting material you are adding.

### Materials for Successful Composting

Knowing which materials to use is just as crucial as having the right tools. Here’s what to focus on:

- **Browns:** This includes dry leaves, straw, and cardboard. Browns provide carbon, which is essential for healthy composting.
- **Greens:** Fresh grass clippings, vegetable scraps, and coffee grounds are excellent sources of nitrogen.
- **Water:** Keeping your compost moist but not soggy helps it decompose correctly. A simple watering can or garden hose will do the trick.

### Advanced Tools for Efficient Composting

Once you’re familiar with the basics, consider adding advanced tools to optimize your composting process:

- **Compost Thermometer:** This tool helps monitor the internal temperature of your compost. An optimal temperature (between 130°F and 160°F) is essential for efficient breakdown of materials and pathogen elimination.
- **Screening Tools:** After the compost has decomposed, you may want to screen it to ensure uniform texture. A simple screen made of mesh can help you sift out larger chunks.
- **Worm Bin (Vermicomposting):** For those interested in a smaller, indoor version of composting, a worm bin can help recycle kitchen scraps efficiently while producing nutrient-rich worm castings.

### Environmental Considerations

It’s essential to consider the environmental footprint when selecting tools:

- **Eco-Friendly Containers:** Opt for biodegradable or recycled materials for your compost bin. This supports sustainability.
- **Hand Tools:** Whenever possible, choose hand tools over electric ones. This reduces energy consumption and cultivates a deeper connection to your composting practice.

### Maintenance and Care

To keep your composting tools in good shape:

- **Regular Cleaning:** Keep your tools free from soil and compost residue. This prevents cross-contamination and helps them last longer.
- **Proper Storage:** Store tools in a dry, sheltered space to extend their lifespan and avoid rusting or weather damage.

The right tools and materials can transform your composting experience. Whether you’re just starting or looking to expand your current setup, having these essentials will set you on the path to successful compost creation.

With patience and dedication, you can turn kitchen scraps and yard waste into a valuable resource for your garden, all while doing good for the planet!

Starting a composting service in your local community is a great way to promote sustainability while earning a decent income. The key to making this venture successful lies in how effectively you market your services. Let’s explore some innovative strategies to get the word out and attract more customers.

- **Develop a tagline:** Craft a short and catchy slogan that encapsulates your mission.

### Utilize Social Media for Outreach

- **Share content:** Post helpful tips about composting, share success stories from your current clients, and showcase your services. Regular and meaningful posts keep your audience engaged.
- **Engage with followers:** Respond to comments and messages in a timely manner. Engage your audience with questions or polls that invite their input.

- **Hand out flyers:** Create informative flyers that explain your services and the benefits of composting. Distribute them door-to-door in neighborhoods.
- **Collaborate with local businesses:** Partner with nearby eco-friendly stores or farmers' markets to place flyers and host joint events.
- **Local bulletins and newsletters:** Advertise in community centers, local newspapers, and online community boards to reach broader audiences.

### Host Workshops and Events

- **Hold community clean-up days:** Organize events that involve cleaning up local parks or neighborhoods, followed by demonstrations on proper composting techniques.

### Use Testimonials and Success Stories

Your current customers can be your best promotional tool. Share their experiences through:

- **Testimonials on your website:** Feature stories from satisfied clients who have benefited from your services.
- **Social media shout-outs:** Encourage happy customers to share their experiences on their social media, tagging your business.
- **Case studies:** Provide in-depth stories on how your composting service has helped clients and the environment.

### Implement Referral Programs

Encouraging satisfied customers to refer friends and family can significantly boost your business. Consider the following:

- **Offer discounts:** Provide incentives like discounts on their next service for every referral that signs up.
- **Create referral tracks:** Have a simple system in place to track who referred new clients to ensure they receive their rewards.

By focusing on effective marketing strategies, you can successfully reach your local community. Building relationships and showcasing the benefits of composting will not only help your business grow but also promote a greener environment.

Composting has gained significant attention in recent years, and for good reason. Not only is it an effective way to reduce waste, but it also offers numerous environmental benefits that can positively impact our planet. Understanding these benefits is essential for anyone looking to adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives.

### Reduces Landfill Waste

One of the most crucial advantages of composting is its ability to significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills. When organic materials such as food scraps and yard waste are composted, they break down naturally rather than taking up space in landfills.

- Less waste in landfills means reduced emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
- Composting helps extend the lifespan of existing landfills, delaying the need for new landfills.

### Enhanced Soil Health

Compost enriches the soil, and here’s how:

- It adds vital nutrients, promoting healthy plant growth.
- Improves soil structure, enhancing its ability to retain moisture.
- Encourages the presence of beneficial microorganisms that aid in breaking down nutrients for plants.

By using compost in gardens and lawns, you can create robust ecosystems that require fewer chemical fertilizers and pesticides, allowing for a more sustainable approach to gardening and farming.

### Conserves Water

Another benefit of composting is its ability to help conserve water. When compost is added to soil, it improves its porosity and structure. This leads to:

- Better water retention, resulting in reduced need for irrigation.
- Decreased surface runoff, minimizing soil erosion during heavy rain.

By using compost, you can ensure your garden thrives even during dry spells while conserving this precious resource.

### Supports Biodiversity

Healthy soil supports a diverse range of plants, insects, and microorganisms. By composting:

- You contribute to the overall health of the ecosystem.
- Composting creates habitats for earthworms and other beneficial creatures that improve soil quality.
- A diverse range of plants can thrive, leading to healthy gardens and landscapes.

### Reduces Carbon Footprint

When you compost organic waste, you are effectively lowering your carbon footprint. Traditional waste disposal methods, such as incineration or landfilling, release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Composting mitigates this impact by:

- Preventing the release of methane from decomposing organic waste in landfills.
- Reducing the need for synthetic fertilizers, which are energy-intensive to produce.

Every bag of organic waste you compost is a step toward a healthier planet, reducing the strain of climate change.

### Encourages Sustainable Practices

Composting promotes a culture of sustainability in several ways:

- It encourages individuals and communities to be more mindful of their waste management practices.
- Inspires the use of organic materials instead of harmful chemicals in gardening.
- Fosters an understanding of environmental stewardship, especially among younger generations.

As more people engage in composting, the collective impact on waste reduction and sustainable living practices will be profound.

### Cost-Effective Fertilizer

Compost serves as a highly effective and cost-efficient alternative to commercial fertilizers. By using compost, you can:

- Save money on gardening and landscaping expenses.
- Minimize the environmental impact associated with the production and distribution of synthetic fertilizers.

Homemade compost enriches your soil without the harmful effects that can result from chemical fertilizers.

Understanding these environmental benefits of composting can empower you to make informed choices that contribute to a healthier planet. By providing a simple yet effective solution to waste and enhancing the environment, composting represents a vital practice for sustainable living.

Tips for Managing Customer Relationships in Your Composting Business
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Building a successful composting business requires more than just collecting organic waste to create compost. A key component that drives the growth of your business is how you manage customer relationships. A focused strategy on customer interaction can not only enhance client satisfaction but also lead to referrals and long-term success. Here are some essential tips to help you manage customer relationships effectively in your composting business.

### Communication is Key

Regular and clear communication is vital. Use multiple channels to keep your customers informed.

- **Email Updates:** Send out newsletters with tips on composting, reminders about collection schedules, or highlights on how your service is making a difference.
- **Text Alerts:** Quick updates via SMS for reminders or changes can keep customers informed and engaged.
- **Social Media Engagement:** Use platforms like Facebook and Instagram to share successes, photos, and community events.

### Provide Excellent Customer Service

Exceptional service can set you apart from the competition. Be responsive to customer inquiries and concerns. Here’s how to enhance your customer service:

- **Listen Actively:** Take time to truly understand customer needs. Ask for feedback and be open to suggestions.
- **Be Proactive:** Anticipate issues before they arise. If there’s a delay in service, inform customers early.
- **Training Staff:** Ensure your team knows how to represent your business positively and handle complaints effectively.

### Build a Community

Encouraging a sense of community among your customers fosters loyalty. Here are some strategies:

- **Workshops:** Organize events that educate people on composting. It can be a fun way for your customers to engage while learning valuable skills.
- **Rewards Program:** Create a rewards system for referrals or long-standing customers. This not only incentivizes loyalty but also creates a word-of-mouth marketing channel.
- **Social Gatherings:** Host events where customers can meet, share experiences, and network. This strengthens the bond between customers and your business.

### Know Your Customers

Understanding the demographics and preferences of your clients can significantly improve your service. Here’s how you can get to know them better:

- **Surveys:** Conduct short surveys to gather information on customer preferences, satisfaction levels, and areas of improvement.
- **Customer Profiles:** Maintain records of customer preferences, service usage, and feedback. This allows for tailored communication and service offerings.
- **Follow-ups:** After service, always follow up with customers to ensure they’re satisfied. This shows you care about their experience.

### Leverage Technology

In today’s digital age, technology can significantly enhance your customer relationship management. Utilize software that can help you:

- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Tools:** Use CRMs to track interactions, schedule follow-ups, and keep customer information organized.
- **Online Booking:** Enable customers to schedule pickups through your website or app, making it easier for them.
- **Feedback Platforms:** Implement tools for customers to provide feedback easily, which can help you make data-driven improvements.

### Educate and Empower Your Customers

Empowering your customers with knowledge about composting can improve loyalty. Share educational content that alleviates their concerns about composting:

- **Provide Resources:** Create easy-to-understand guides or infographics that explain the composting process and benefits.
- **Answer FAQs:** Build a comprehensive FAQ section on your website to answer common queries.
- **Highlight Success Stories:** Share testimonials from satisfied customers or case studies of successful composting practices.

These strategies into your composting business will enhance your customer relationship management. When your customers feel valued and appreciated, they are more likely to remain loyal, recommend your services, and contribute to the growth of your community-focused business. Finding that balance between excellent service, effective communication, and education will shape the future of your composting service.

### Conclusion

As you embark on your journey to start a composting service, the potential to make $100 a day is within reach. By following the outlined steps diligently, you can establish a profitable business that not only supports your finances but also contributes to a healthier planet. Investing in essential tools and equipment is crucial for ensuring effective composting processes, which will improve the quality of the service you provide.

Effective marketing strategies tailored to your local community can help you attract customers and raise awareness about the value of composting. Share the environmental benefits, such as reducing waste and enriching soil health, to connect with eco-conscious individuals who are likely to appreciate your service. Make use of social media, local events, and flyers to spread the word and build a loyal customer base.

Nurturing customer relationships is essential for sustained success in your composting venture. Communicate regularly with your clients, addressing their needs and concerns promptly. A focus on exceptional customer service will not only foster loyalty but also lead to word-of-mouth referrals that can further boost your business.

By combining practical steps, effective marketing, environmental education, and strong customer engagement, your composting service can thrive while allowing you to earn a meaningful income. The journey may require hard work and dedication, but the rewards of financial stability and environmental impact are well worth the effort. Take that first step today, and watch your composting business grow.

1idiw1a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1idiw1a,Everything you need to summon crumpets! & More!,"A lot of y'all probably already know about this but just in case there's anyone out there who doesn't know and would like to know how to summon the crumpets, I thought I'd share the items needed and how to use the items to make them appear! And at the end of the post if anyone wants to know where to find the rest of the crumpets in the game, I thought I'd share this info as well! But if you haven't found them all and want to find them on your own, don't read the last part of this post! 

So most of the items needed to summon the crumpets can be found in Bop City! The only items that can't be found there are the green tablet and cheetah toy on wheels in the picture with Nari, which can be found in the Little Paws Daycare pack (I'm pretty sure that's where it's from anyway) and the pink and blue eraser pillow and black tablet pen in the picture with Leon, which can be found in the creative workshop pack! Everything else can be found in Bop City. 

Items needed from post office: the tallest plant on the lockers and the blue card with red heart on it. 
Food court: triple layer cake with white icing and red berries and orange traffic cone. 
Apartment: yellow game controller, gray coffee cup, soapy sponge, picture frame with person with red glasses, purple octopus, gold trophy, snow globe, yellow poop.
Convenience store: roll of toilet paper, pizza crust (tap to turn it into a slice of pizza), carrot, tofu, green magazine, unsliced loaf of bread, blue carton of milk, binoculars, soccer ball, basketball, blue bag of potato chips, pink ball, sloth, orange doll, blue doll, lettuce, disco ball, fish, black phone, yellow phone, cucumber, little green ball, green party hat, purple party hat, cat food, burger (hamburger bun+steak=burger), pink pillow. 
Movie theater: yellow candlestick with 3 candles, red rose, green gem.
Tailor: black sunglasses, cup of markers, bottle of glue. 
Hair salon: purple hair dryer and scissors. 
Storage units: yellow skateboard, camcorder, black camera, big metal can from the yellow dumpster. (There's also a soapy sponge at the storage units and you can use the one from there or the one from the apartment, it doesn't matter either way.
After you find everything, take it all to the storage units and find characters Leon, Rita, Zeke, and Nari.
The first picture I've shared is Leon. Place him on the street in front of the storage units. I've paired all of the objects together and spaced them all out a little so you'll be able to easily tell which two objects go together. Put the sloth in one of his hands and the orange doll in the other and a crumpet will appear! Then do the same with the green ball and green party hat, then the green gem and pink pillow, etc..
Next picture is Rita. Do the same with all the items in the picture with her, but you'll notice in her picture I've got things circled and that's because some of the objects are used more than once so like the coffee cup and soccer ball will summon one crumpet and then the soccer ball and purple octopus will summon another crumpet. Same goes for the orange traffic cone and pink ball and the pink ball and the metal can from the dumpster. 
Next is Zeke. You know what to do lol. 
Next is Nari. Same.
The last picture shows some crumpets in the dumpster at the storage units. Once you've summoned all of your crumpets just line the ones up that are shown in the photo and that's how you'll get the pink house, yellow car and rv, and the cute little white and pink crumpet to appear in front of the yellow dumpster as shown in the photo. 

****Now for the spoiler alert**** 
**DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU'D PREFER TO FIND ALL THE CRUMPETS ON YOUR OWN**

1idivma,https://i.redd.it/s18vlws9i3ge1.jpeg,Anyone familiar with KB? I can’t get a good v60 from these beans.,"Just purchased beans from KB Coffee Roasters in Paris after enjoying an incredible espresso at their cafe. I'm struggling to get a decent pour over from them. 

KB tend to have funky, fruity beans, but so far every cup I’ve made on my v60 has that overwhelming natural/funk/boozy taste with nothing close to the notes of cola, cherry, and fruit it’s supposed to have. 

My go-to recipe (which hasn’t come close to working) is:
- Current method: 90°C water
- Ratio: 15g coffee to 250ml water
- 3 equal pours

I'm already halfway through the bag and still haven’t tasted anything nice. 

Anyone familiar with their stuff? What brewing recipe would you recommend trying?

When I arrived at the cafe, he was already seated and he ordered coffee and muffins for the both of us. Our date went well, except for the fact that he was constantly on his phone the entire time. Towards the end, he excused himself to use the bathroom leaving his phone behind. The Grindr notification sound started rapidly playing. I stared at his phone and sure enough he was actively texting multiple guys. 

I don’t know why but my heart sank when I saw the endless back and forth messages. I thought today would be a special day between just the two of us. 💔I think he didn’t like how our date went so maybe he’s actively searching, but can’t that wait until after our date?

One day, you’re productive, and the next, even opening your laptop feels exhausting. If you’re running on empty but still have deadlines to meet, here are some ways to push through without completely crashing:

1️⃣ **Lower the Bar (Temporarily)** – Not every study session has to be your best. If you can’t focus for hours, aim for 20 minutes. A little progress is better than none.

2️⃣ **Switch Up Your Environment** – If staring at the same desk makes you want to scream, move somewhere new. Even a different room or a coffee shop can help reset your brain.

3️⃣ **Do the Bare Minimum, Then Stop** – If you're mentally drained, identify the *absolute must-do* tasks and only focus on those. Everything else can wait.

4️⃣ **Find a Study Buddy** – Sometimes, just being around someone else who’s working (even virtually) can help you stay on track without forcing yourself to overthink.

5️⃣ **Take a Real Break** – Scrolling on your phone is not a break. Go for a walk, take a shower, or listen to music. Your brain needs real downtime to recover.

I used to believe that if I just found the perfect job, everything would fall into place. The right role, the right company, the right salary—and then I’d be set.

But here’s what I’ve learned. The perfect job doesn’t exist. Every role has challenges, trade-offs, and learning curves. And most people don’t have just one dream job—our careers evolve as we grow, gain new skills, and figure out what truly matters to us.

My first job at the age of 14 was helping an engineering company create a display for their exhibition, and get coffee, and do photocopies and anything else. 

At 20, I had my first internship as a project assistant for a telecom giant in US (AT&T), 21 internship with Honeywell. 

After graduation - worked in Management Consulting

At 32 got recruited by Mastercard to run a $10M. 

At 36 left Mastercard after growing that business to $100M

Now I run a few different businesses, and even a couple of businesses that have nothing to do with my background. 

So instead of chasing some ideal job, here’s what I focus on:

* **Growth over titles.** I look for opportunities that stretch my skills and open doors.
* **Experimentation.** The best way to figure out what you want is by trying different industries, roles, and projects.
* **The right environment.** A great job in a toxic culture will never feel like a dream.
* **Continuous learning.** The best career moves happen when you actively upskill and adapt.

For anyone just starting their career, here are a few things I wish I knew earlier:

* **Your first job won’t define your career.** It’s a stepping stone, not a lifelong commitment. Learn as much as you can, but don’t stress about it being perfect.

1idih1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1idih1z/aita_for_telling_my_dads_mistress_i_dont_care/,AITA for telling my dad's mistress I don't care about their possible death's?,"My parents marriage ended just over a year ago after my mom learned my dad was having an affair. My dad and his mistress had been ""together"" for about 6 years by then and my dad was less concerned about mom finding out because my older siblings were out of the house and I (18f) was almost grown. I think he wanted her to know about the affair. To me and my siblings it looks like he hated mom and from the way he talked it seemed as though he resented her for being happy with him.

We all turned our backs on dad when we found out and he tried to fight it, he spoke to us and said he loved us and he was still our dad and he still wanted the best for us. None of us wanted the best for him. My brother told him he hoped the rest of his life was miserable.

Weeks after my mom filed for divorce my dad texted me and my siblings that his mistress was pregnant. He sent us a scan photo but none of us were moved to get back in contact with him or to keep him in our lives.

I live at home with mom still and I'm in community college. My siblings visit but they live out of state now.

A couple of weeks ago my dad's mistress showed up at the coffee shop where I work and she tried to talk to me. But I stayed professional and informed her there was no personal conversation that could take place at work. She left but came back when my shift was ending and she tried to talk to me as I walked home. I told her I had nothing to say to her. She wanted me to look at and ""meet""  her baby but I walked away before she could get the baby out of the stroller.

She showed up again a few days later and she did the same thing, only without the baby this time. She told me to think about how short life is and how our dad could die tomorrow and we would have shut him out of our lives for no reason. I told her I don't care if they die. I told her they were sick and twisted and I was letting him go. That I didn't care about him or her or the baby they had together. And I said if she wanted her kid to be protected from the truth then she better keep the kid away from me and my siblings because we wanted nothing to do with them and would not pretend to care just to make them happy. I said she needed to leave me alone or I'd make sure I went to the police about her stalking me.

When I got home I had a random account DM me saying I was wrong to not care about people's deaths. Since she was the only person I said it to I deleted it and moved on. But she told my dad's family and some of them told me I should still care about that, especially my dad and the baby because they're family. Another relative said the mistress hadn't done anything wrong to me or my family and didn't deserve to have it taken out on her when she owed my mom nothing. I brushed off what they said but I guess it made me wonder if I was wrong to say it? Either way I won't apologize but I'll just ignore if she or dad tries again in the future.

1idifwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1idifwp/january_results_and_reflections_celebrating_a/,January results and reflections (celebrating a small success),"First of all, I'm really happy that finally what I am doing is working.

I started this year with the weight of 96kg, I'm 28M, 176cm (211lbs, 5' 10 for Americans). Now I'm at 92.2kg (202lbs): [https://imgur.com/a/GW27TWE](https://imgur.com/a/GW27TWE)

I've just come back from visiting home during NYE where I gained a substantial amount of weight, and my first thought after coming back to my place was to figure it out and lose weight. My usual diet was always characterized with processed and preserved foods, eating out, sugar...etc. I wasn't particularly feeling the best, nor was I feeling at my worst. I was just ""existing"". My sleep was also all over the place and I kinda hated it.

In the first week of January, I listened to Allen Carr's audio book on how to lose weight, and I took home a few pieces of valuable advice (the book is very questionable, but nonetheless it contains some valuable advice). And I started adjusting my diet and eating habits accordingly and learnt a few key lessons.

**1. The effect of foods on your body stay for 48 hours**

I learnt that when you eat something, its effects (bloating, further hunger, energy, weight fluctuations...etc) remain with me for 48 hours. When I switched to my current diet (more on that later), it took me approx 48 hours to get a good night's sleep. When I ate KFC on January 13 and had that weight surge you can see it in the graph, it took me 48 hours to feel back to normal again and to also sleep well and see the bloating go away. I used to think that foods have an immediate and short-lasting effect on me, so this lesson was really important to wrap my head around because now I am definitely more patient with how I see my weight fluctuations and foods. Like if I eat a larger than normal volume of food the day before and my weight did not move or added a few grams since last weigh-in, I realize that the food I consumed the day before did not properly digest yet and it will take some time for it to finish. Same with sleep. When I eat not so healthy food, I find myself not sleeping well for the next 1 or 2 nights and then back to normal.

**2. Processed and preserved food should be a very small and minor group of the foods you consume on daily basis (my diet)**

With how wildly available processed and junk food are and with how much effort it takes to prepare healthy and whole foods and make them edible, I struggled deriving my calories from healthy ingredients. I was always drinking ""FuzeTea"" (it's your American Gatorade AFAIK), these sweetened ""zero"" drinks, I was always eating a bag of chips every day, high sugar chocolate and other processed junk and snacks. This was a critical component of my diet and I was borderline addicted. If you look at the graph as well, you can see how my progress slowed down on January 13 when I ate that KFC, and its effects were felt in other areas in my life as well, like sleeping and headaches...etc.

After reading Allen Carr's book and how much sense he made about eating more fruit and vegetables and making them the primary source of fuel, I decided to switch my diet to have 90% of my calories coming from pure plants. I went to the supermarket and grabbed of each kind of vegetables/fruit 4 pieces.

Now when I wake up I eat a banana, an apple, and an orange with a cup of coffee.

At lunch, I mildly fry pepper and eggplants in 1tbsp of olive oil then crack 3 eggs on them, add some spicy sauce and some spice, then cut fresh vegetable and pour it on the mixture and eat it with 2 whole-grain breads on the side. I sprinkle it with some spinach and voila. The result is almost a big bowl of vegetables. I took with me to work the other day and my colleagues were amazed and complimented me on my culinary skills lol. I love this meal, it makes me feel full and it gives me so much energy.

Later in the day I eat 150g of shelled peanuts, and I eat 2-3 low-sugar chocolate bars throughout the day to keep the binge eating tendencies at bay. I follow up a banana or an apply depending on how hungry I feel during the day. The recipe and what I mentioned changes day to day, sometimes I'd include sausages in the meal or eat other types of fruit like avocados or mango, but what's important is that anything that is highly processed or has +10g of sugar, I immediately pass. The chocolate bars have lower than 1g of sugar in them.

**3. Divide your goal into smaller increments to make it easier to see progress and stick to plans**

My goal weight is 75kg (165lbs) but just looking at that number crushes every bit of motivation I have left, and this was one of the reasons that made me quit in the past. I looked at my previous data and I look at how fast I lost/gained weight and based on that I'd put a goal that reflects it. I decided that for my first goal, I want to reach 92kg (200lbs) by the end of February (that's 4kg/8lbs difference in 2 months). And here I am beating myself to it and reaching 92kg a lot earlier than I expected. Was the weight loss fast? Sure. But do I feel drained or can't do it anymore like before? Absolutely not. Unlike before, I feel like I could still do it, and drawing nearer and nearer to 90kg makes me excited and makes me feel like 2025 is probably the year I'll go back to my normal weight. 

My next goal is to reach 90kg in the next 2 months, and after that, I want to reach 87kg, then down to 85kg, then 82, and finally 80kg, see how I feel, then down to 76kg. I estimating 1.5 or 2 months in-between each goal, so this is a plan for the next 10 months or so. 

**4. Losing weight is a very slow process**

Most of the days, I am really maintaining my weight and trying not to gain any, and you see that some days, even that was not always achievable, but the real weight loss happens when I go out  for a walk. You see these drastic weight loss days where I go an entire 700g lighter? These are the days I walked more than 8k steps either by hanging out with friends, by going to the office, or going around my day with groceries and stuff. My life style is sedentary and do not move much, so when I eat my normal diet to not feel like I'm starving, I usually maintain my weight or lose just a tiny bit, but the real loss happens when I walk, and this is why it is such a slow and difficult process. 

Anyways, I hope this helps people trying to figure it out. I write this post just to reflect on what I learnt and to keep myself in check and resume my work. I hope this all works out for the best, and I hope from the bottom of my heart that we all will eventually see the light of day and wake up to bodies that we cherish and appreciate.
