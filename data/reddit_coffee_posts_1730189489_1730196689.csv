I am debating between upgrading or building a new PC. I would prefer to upgrade but my motherboard doesn't allow me much wiggle room for a better CPU and so to make an impactful upgrade, I think it would require a full motherboard swap. Even then, the PC has been used pretty hard-core for 5 years and I am worried about the general ware on other parts.

In your opinions, would it be cheaper and easier to upgrade or just buy a new PC

So I'm 21M, a university student. I have a huge crush on my classmate. And have already told her but she has said she doesn't like relationship stuff (I belong to Pakistan, a rather conservative society where relationships before marriage are not considered good let alone physical relationships). She is quite introvert and seems of good character. So I was quite heartbroken but I try doing different antics to impress her but she just laughs them off(not irritated) She has a very good male friend (another classmate) , who is tall+attractive. I always suspected that they both are together but he is in a relationship with some other girl and she doesn't go out with boys alone.

Now the main story is. 2 days ago, when our classes ended for the day, I saw them sitting in her car together and I got jealous AF so I put my scooty after them at a safe distance. They stopped outside some small house and went inside the gate. Now you can imagine my fury. I parked some yards away, and waited for a few minutes then climbed the wall.. I wanted to get inside the house at any cost, so I devised a quick plan and knocked on door. Till he came outside to check, I went to the back and hid there. He went back inside and then I knocked again and this time both of them scared and furious came outside and tried to check everywhere, leaving the main door open. I slowly slowly crawled away from wherever they were checking and when both of them were in backyard, I went inside the door. It was one bhk home, so I went quickly inside the only room and hid myself in the cupboard. They both came back and were in the living room. He was playfully teasing her. And she was saying that why he was with that other girl and didn't recognized her love earlier. Both were talking very sensually. (imagine my fury). Then she told him to be gentle as it was her first time and he said that he bet she wouldn't be able to walk on her legs afterwards. (imagine my fury). Then she asked him to wait there and she came to the room. She wore a very se#y make up and a sizzling bikini, and then asked him to come to the room. Then what i saw i couldnt believe my eyes, that she is the same naive girl. She danced for him on a really sensual song, and was literally behaving like a¬†[wh@re](mailto:wh@re). I peeked in from the cupboard all the time and boy oh boy. For the next 4 hrs, he literally busted every hole that she had in multiple positions and not once gently, and she was enjoying it AF. She kept moaning and screaming loudly and he kept banging her from left, right and centre. Especially when they were trying the ""other hole"", she literally bled. And even then he pounded her in that hole one more time. On the bed, on the couch, leaning on wall from behind.. in missionary, in doggy,.. THEY TRIED EACH FUC\*ING THING...she even jokingly said to him ""forget walking, i wont be able to sit properly for weeks now""...thats the level of pounding she had recieved....

I was like where the F did that introvert and shy girl has gone whom I loved. I used to be very respectful and gentle around her but during all this episode he wasn't once gentle with her and even slapped her hard when she was blowing him. So after all this (4 hrs had passed), they both went to the attached bathroom and she was literally not able to walk properly. After a minute or two, her moans started again. Here I was in the cupboard, with teary eyes and a huge boner. I quietly came outside and sneaked outside the main door and then climbed the wall again and got home. All the night I was having the worst wet dreams of my life involving both of them. Yesterday in the class, both of them arrived separately as usual and were behaving like nothing had happened. She was still not able to walk properly. She was with her female friends, and I was feeling the very urge to talk to her. So I asked her for notes and she gave me those. I couldn't control myself and asked if she would like a coffee in the Cafe and she smiled and said that I've told you earlier, I don't go out with boys alone. I kept quite.. But wtf bro... Tell me straight away that you don't like me rather not wanting a relationship with anyone.

I don't know if I'm horny, sad or heartbroken since 2 days. Probably a mixture of all feelings. This event has probably given me a trauma for whole life... I can't even eat or sleep properly... She was the only girl whom I had ever loved in my life... Does this happen with all nice guys??,

This story is true AF. May sound over dramatic but I can't assure you people using anything else.. Needed to take it out somewhere so using this account I made a month ago for browsing .... Feel free to share¬†your¬†thoughts..

Looks like we'll be starting off the day with heavy intensity rain, so make sure to grab your umbrella and rain boots before heading out the door. The rain is expected to last throughout the morning, so you might want to plan for some indoor activities or cozy up with a nice cup of coffee.

As we move into the afternoon, the rain is expected to ease up a bit, but there will still be showers lingering around. Don't let the weather dampen your spirits though, maybe take this opportunity to enjoy a leisurely lunch at one of the local cafes or explore the town's charming shops.

By the evening, the rain should start to taper off, leaving a cool and refreshing atmosphere in its wake. It might be the perfect time to take a relaxing stroll along the beach and enjoy the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. Just remember to pack a light jacket to stay comfortable as the temperature drops slightly.

Overall, today's forecast calls for a wet start but a calming end to the day. Embrace the rain and find joy in the little moments it brings. Stay dry and have a wonderful day, Puerto Morelos! ‚òÇÔ∏èüåä",1,1730196012.0,PuertoMorelos,0,1.0,False

I'm a 46F and I tend to fall asleep fine, but then I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. I don't drink caffeine during the week and only two cups of coffee on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Melatonin 2mg has been working great, but I am a little groggy the next day, so I thought I'd try the magnesium. I took it for the first time last night and it didn't help with staying asleep.

My partner came out as bisexual four years ago, and we‚Äôve experienced some of our best and worst moments navigating their journey.

I‚Äôm not going to lie‚Äîthere‚Äôs a special bond that comes from being your spouse‚Äôs wingman. They‚Äôve had independent relationships, some where I was invited, and other amazing periods focused just on us. We have two kids around seven years old. My partner works remotely from home, and I left corporate after COVID to stay home full-time and homeschool.

Ninety percent of everything is great, but I can tell I‚Äôm not the favored fantasy anymore. We‚Äôve settled into more of a partner/co-parenting relationship, where emotional and physical intimacy often has to be scheduled around work, mental states, and stress levels. Even kissing can sometimes be overwhelming for them, and while I don‚Äôt take it personally, I sense they may be closer to gay than bi. Still, neither of us wants to jeopardize the 90% that‚Äôs amazing or risk impacting the kids by separating.

I‚Äôve also realized that what we have might be better than many traditional marriages. We set time aside to date and have a great sex life, probably more than a lot of married couples. I just wish it felt more organic‚ÄîI miss being wanted.

They‚Äôre interested in dating again, and I understand that I can‚Äôt give them what they‚Äôre missing. But for the first time, I‚Äôm feeling my own need for something more‚Äîthe feeling of being genuinely wanted.

So, I think I might start dating too, believing we can each fulfill that 10% while maintaining everything we‚Äôve built.

1geqppv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/1geqppv/overwhelmed_at_starbucks/,Overwhelmed at starbucks,"Ill be honest, it is not my trainers or management thats the issue, its genuinely me. i thought I would love starbucks bc i love making coffee at home. But my first training day was a bit of a mess imo. I was thrown on the POS and heating, which was fine but abbreviations hurt my brain. For the most part its not bad abbrviating the simple coffee orders, those with more than 2 words, yeah fk. Writing shots and syrups, i constantly struggle with. I dont know if its just training jitters and i just need time to memorize and get it down, or maybe i just dont have a good memory as i thought. I have a feeling its the fact my memory sucks now. 
I honestly want to ask to switch back to fulfillment‚Ä¶ i dont want the responsibility of messing up coffee orders. I kept confusing the short tall and grande hot cups. And it takes me a full 3-5 minutes per customer to get one customized drink order down. Figuring out what to write, figuring out how to put it in the POS, ive asked a million questions already and im scared to make drinks now. I was taught making lattes and flat whites, easy peas. But i dont think i could be a good barista honestly 
is it bad if i call out of my training or should i go in and ask to just go to fulfillment.. 
i have so much anxiety just thinking about messing up at starbucks. Fulfillment i know i will be fine, its just laborous since im running around at mach speed haha i phyiscally burn out in fulfillment but thats manageable. ",1,1730195179.0,Target,0,1.0,False

1geqnu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1geqnu7/aita_for_wanting_to_room_alone_with_my_girlfriend/,AITA for wanting to room alone with my girlfriend instead of sharing with our friend?,"

For context, my girlfriend (let's call her Sally) and I have known each other since 5th grade, and we‚Äôve been together for over a year now. Recently, we made a new friend (we‚Äôll call her Tina), and we all get along really well. The dynamic in our trio is great, and although we‚Äôve only known Tina for about a month, we really value her company.

Sally and I have decided not to share our relationship with Tina yet, partly due to the risk of bullying and also because we haven‚Äôt known her long enough to fully trust her with this secret. (Yes, I‚Äôm a lesbian, and we live in a country where LGBTQ+ relationships aren‚Äôt widely accepted. We‚Äôve already faced some bullying and just want to live peacefully.)

Near Christmas, the three of us are planning a trip to Vienna, and we‚Äôre all really excited. Here‚Äôs where my dilemma comes in: Sally and I would really love to share a hotel room. It‚Äôs a rare chance for us to spend time alone together since we don‚Äôt live together, and we‚Äôd really appreciate having that privacy, at least at night. But Tina has been assuming we‚Äôll all share a room, and I‚Äôm worried that asking for alone time might hurt her feelings or make her feel left out.

However, in the past, there have been minor situations where Tina didn‚Äôt take things well, like when we went out for coffee and she felt left out.

We haven‚Äôt brought it up yet because we‚Äôre unsure how to approach the situation without revealing our relationship. I really value our friendship with Tina, and the last thing I want is for her to feel excluded on this trip.

i'm ordering AP from amazon to the philippines so I kinda have to get everything i need in one order. i am having a hard time deciding which stuff to buy so i'm here asking for help. Which set should I buy?

* A - AP, AP Flow Control Cap + SS filter ($82)
* B - AP, Cafe Concetto Fine filter ($52)
* C - AP, WeThinkeer Flow Control Cap (57.40) 
* D - AP, Able Disk ($60-70)

Sadly, Fellow doesn't ship to my location so Prismo is not an option. As for Able disk, I can't choose whether to get Fine or Standard. I've read people had their Fine warping so idk about that. I could get a set of both for an additional $10. 

Also, I saw[ this rather inexpensive caddy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09JKGY7TN/). Anybody here got it? There's some mixed reviews so I'm not sure if it's worth spending on it.

Sil woke to the stench of ammonia. It jolted her back to consciousness like a hot poker driven up the nose. She drew in a sharp breath, coughed, and continued for long enough that she felt she might spit out a lung.

Her head throbbed.

Her back cracked painfully when she tried to squirm away from whatever emitted that awful stink. Her heart rate threatened a fatal outcome.

‚ÄúSee? Right as rain. Nothing harmed.‚Äù

The voice was new, speaking from the side. By the time her vision cleared of tears, hands held her shoulders and guided her upright.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, Sil. Relax. It‚Äôs ok.‚Äù Vergil‚Äôs voice accompanied the boy‚Äôs steadying presence at her back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe. The big spider‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

Through gasps for fresh breath and wild panic, she could see two more people looming above her. Tallah drew herself up, tying off a small, blue satchel.

*Smelling salts?* She recognized the bloody thing at a glance.

Someone else stood next to the sorceress. Sil‚Äôs heart hitched in her throat on first sight, fearing Erisa. *That‚Äôs not right*, a part of her observed. This newcomer was entirely different from the pieces they‚Äôd seen growing out of the spiders.

‚ÄúWh-Who?‚Äù she croaked.

There was blood in the back of her throat, or at least the taste of it. Swallowing hurt. Talking barely produced a rasping whisper. She‚Äôd screamed herself hoarse.

Tallah moved closer and offered her left hand. The right was still as stump, neatly cut. No bone saw could have produced that perfect effect. She also missed half her sleeve and all the limiters that had been on that arm.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs she?‚Äù Sil leaned on Vergil for support once up on her own two feet, her head spinning.

‚ÄúGlad to see you still kicking,‚Äù Tallah answered.

‚ÄúDaughter Dreea, explain yourself,‚Äù the albino girl demanded. She came to stand next to Tallah, fists on hips. ‚ÄúWhat is this nonsense about your name being *Sil* and being an Adana? I gave you no permission to demean your calling.‚Äù

The words cut straight through whatever complex set of feelings Sil experienced just then. Pain, fatigue, confusion, all melted down in the furnace of rage, painting her sight red and her mood black.

‚ÄúExcuse me?!‚Äù She shook free of Vergil and stalked forward, barely stumbling. Her voice rasped but she didn‚Äôt care. ‚ÄúWho do you think you are?‚Äù

The girl barely reached her chest but the intensity of her red gaze made her seem much more imposing. ‚ÄúYour god‚Äî‚Äù

Sil struck her clean across the face, hand moving before her mind finished reeling. After the horror of the last day and seeing what had become of Erisa, how could she not strike whatever called itself a goddess? *Her* goddess?

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt dare,‚Äù she hissed. ‚ÄúWhat goddess are you? Where were you? What right have you to demand anything?!‚Äù

She meant to strike her again but her hand wouldn‚Äôt obey. Tallah had grabbed her wrist and held it fast, a half-smile on her lips.

‚ÄúAs entertaining as this is, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to strike her,‚Äù the sorceress said.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have me kneel? To her? After all this?‚Äù Sil wrenched her arm away and gestured vaguely to encompass the entire city.

‚ÄúAbsolutely not. Just don‚Äôt hit her.‚Äù Tallah inclined her head and Sil‚Äôs gaze followed to the mound of steaming meat behind them. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what she made of the beast giving me grief. I‚Äôm rather certain I can‚Äôt defend us if you piss in her coffee.‚Äù

She turned back to the goddess.

‚ÄúWhere were you?‚Äù she demanded. ‚ÄúWhere were you when all of this happened?‚Äù

Panacea‚Äîif that‚Äôs who she truly was‚Äîregarded her with a mixture of surprise and anger. Sil‚Äôs strike hadn‚Äôt even budged her chin, but a pink palm imprint shone on her cheek.

‚ÄúAs I was explaining to the sorceress before she insisted on waking you, I have no idea where this is.‚Äù She glared at Tallah and then back at Sil. ‚ÄúI will forgive you your outburst. Once. Now, kindly explain before you run my patience ragged.‚Äù

Vergil offered Sil a canteen of water. She drank deeply, cool water steaming the coals of her anger, its touch a balm on her ragged throat. Her goddess had failed here! She had failed that young girl and condemned her to this wretched fate. And now, she‚Äôd killed her, just like that.

What use was a goddess if she couldn‚Äôt even protect a child?

‚ÄúYou sent Erisa here, and allowed all of this to happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll of this‚Ä¶ what?!‚Äù The goddess raised her tone. ‚ÄúI need‚ÄîActually, no.‚Äù She raised a hand and Sil dropped to her knees, every muscle in her body screaming as she was bent forward in supplication.

Panacea flicked her forehead. A light tap that sent Sil‚Äôs head spinning as if struck by a shovel.

‚ÄúAh! Now I see.‚Äù A dark frown creased the goddess‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúLovely. Right under my nose. Of course I had no idea. Fuck that Brachus and his gaggle of imbeciles.‚Äù She lapsed into mutterings filled with pointed invective, pacing around the brutalised clearing.

Sil dropped to her hands and knees, released. Again, Vergil helped her rise.

‚ÄúCan we please stop attacking one another?‚Äù he asked, a note of exasperation in his voice. ‚ÄúThere are worse things in here. Maybe we can focus on not attracting them?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the worst things in here,‚Äù both Tallah and Panacea said in unison, then glared at one another.

‚ÄúDaughter‚Äî‚Äù Panacea started, immediately stopped and let out an annoyed sigh. ‚Äú Daughter Silestra, I give you my word that I couldn‚Äôt have known what went on in here. Coming through the barrier shielding this place was more effort than I can describe in ways you could understand. They‚Äôve deployed an imperfect copy of my own protective lattice, one designed specifically to keep me out. I did not even know it existed. You walking in here opened up a passage for me to follow.‚Äù

She raised a hand as Tallah opened her mouth.

‚ÄúYou both have questions. I commend you for them. But I have little time and much to accomplish now that I understand the situation. Maintaining coherence, even projected as I am, is spectacularly difficult. I would like to get my daughter back since I‚Äôm presented with the opportunity.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not really here,‚Äù Tallah said. ‚ÄúThis much raw power in a mere projection?‚Äù

‚ÄúPrecisely. And even so, there are forces becoming aware of my activity. I do not wish their attention drawn here or to you. Do you understand?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot in the slightest.‚Äù Tallah shrugged. She gave Sil a long look. ‚ÄúTry and make some sense. What did you just do to Sil?‚Äù

‚ÄúA mere mind touch. Nothing to harm‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou promised that can‚Äôt be done,‚Äù Sil spat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in every text: no healer may be mind touched.‚Äù The very notion of it was ghastly.

‚Äú*May* being the operative word in there, daughter Sil.‚Äù Panacea turned red eyes on her, and an apologetic smile. ‚ÄúI make sure you cannot do it to one another. But it can be done. Creating the kind of protection your friend here uses is too difficult to maintain, and is prone to failure. I prefer locking it away from your use via conditioning.‚Äù

Sil‚Äôs world slipped out from beneath her feet.

‚ÄúYou lied to us‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúQuite an impressive jump to that conclusion. In the strictest sense, I do lie, yes. Is this relevant for anything? Or are you simply intent on remaining petulant?‚Äù An evil smile crept across her face. ‚ÄúMight you like me to count the number of touches you‚Äôve performed without informed consent?‚Äù

Sil swallowed her next protest and it went down kicking. Vergil was just one. A rush of many other faces and their accompanying memories flashed across her mind‚Äôs eye, some of them stoking her headache.

‚ÄúI thought not.‚Äù Panacea came closer and Sil drew a step back, her anger beaten back into shame. ‚ÄúI am willing to forgive some things, for now, due to circumstance. I expect you to explain yourself later, daughter *Silestra.* I expect you to explain why you saw fit to bury Dreea as you did.‚Äù

Sil took another step back and yelped as she stumbled over Vergil. She nearly fell.

‚ÄúVergil,‚Äù Tallah called the boy to her. ‚ÄúLet Sil deal with her mommy. You go and fetch my arm, please. It‚Äôs back there, by the churned earth. I should be able to reattach it before the knowledge slips from me.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow much blood did you lose?‚Äù

Sil turned away from the goddess‚Äôs red glare, feeling very much like she‚Äôd been scolded by one of the School‚Äôs matrons, now needing to make herself useful. Tallah‚Äôs lips were near parchment white and purple bags hung beneath her eyes. It was a miracle she was upright at all. How she held her stump without cauterising it or, at least, having it wrapped, was nearly imbecilic.

‚ÄúCan you open your rend? We‚Äôve got bloodberry tonics stocked.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can barely keep my eyes open and my feet under me,‚Äù Tallah answered, swaying in place. The rush of battle was leaving her and it showed in her stoop. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky I can even walk. Anna‚Äôs slipped away from our grasp when this one tried a touch on me.‚Äù She gave Sil a tight-lipped half-smile. ‚ÄúNot my finest moment.‚Äù

She made her way to Tallah and slipped her remaining arm over her shoulder.

‚ÄúLean on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fancy eating grass just yet,‚Äù Tallah chided. She stumbled and nearly dragged Sil down.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be an arse. I‚Äôm fine enough. I feel better.‚Äù

Panacea raised a white eyebrow at them. ‚ÄúIf you have your arm, I will reattach it. It‚Äôs not an issue. You shouldn‚Äôt be walking about after an amputation like that.‚Äù

Tallah grinned, ‚ÄúWhy are you even here? Since when do gods meddle when it doesn‚Äôt benefit them?‚Äù

The goddess let out a long sigh and had the grace to look abashed. ‚ÄúI did not take losing an Egia daughter well. You might actually say I took it‚Ä¶ poorly. I may have said some unkind things to that girl, Catharina, when she brought me the news. May have promised doing some unsavoury things if she ever showed her face to me again.‚Äù

She blushed bright pink, washing out the signs of Sil‚Äôs slap.

‚ÄúMy system‚Äôs been running a passive check for any signs of Erisa for nearly two centuries. I received confirmation today and rushed on-site.‚Äù She gestured vaguely at the walls and the forest. ‚ÄúThis place is so well shielded that I couldn‚Äôt penetrate easily once connection was achieved. I imagine my coming caused a lot of discomfort for you, daughter. It was not by design.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou nearly got me killed. Why can‚Äôt I channel?‚Äù

‚ÄúSimply put, because my transmission is much stronger than your flow of illum. You can‚Äôt overcome the kind of volume I‚Äôm pushing through. My advance warning should have made you much more receptive to my coming, but even that got scrambled.‚Äù

Vergil returned with Tallah‚Äôs severed arm held out in front of him, head turned to the side as if ashamed of looking at it. Panacea took it and inspected the bloodless cut.

‚ÄúI will not heal you fully. Even with the nerves severed cleanly, there will still be damage. When you‚Äôll come see me, I‚Äôll finish the work properly, or fit you with a prosthetic.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôll what?‚Äù Tallah asked.

‚ÄúCome see me.‚Äù Panacea made it sound like the most natural follow-up to the entire mad event. ‚ÄúYou and I have a lot to discuss, and we can‚Äôt do it here and now. Time‚Äôs short. I‚Äôll expect the three of you at my School after you‚Äôre done here.‚Äù

A flick of her fingers cleared away the grime accumulated around the wound.

‚ÄúThis will hurt. And it will not be as good as before. I am simply too far away and the interference too great for me to risk anything more than a simple attachment. Once the pain passes, it will be numb. Do not use it for anything too demanding until we finish the work properly. Is that clear, sorceress?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust put the blasted thing back on. It‚Äôs starting to bother me not having it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs you say.‚Äù

Tallah screamed as Panacea used a healing weave Sil had never seen before. Regeneration wasn‚Äôt something taught to them at the School, nor reattachment of limbs. That was left to the Sisters, their own goddess and their trees.

Panacea herself was different from any depiction she‚Äôd ever seen of the goddess. No wide hips, generous bosom, or motherly demeanour. This real one was, at best, a girl. Her physique was willowy, skin parchment-white and smooth as marble. If not for the pink of her tongue and the red of her eyes, she wouldn‚Äôt have been much different from any of the statues lining the walls. Less benevolence, more repressed rage.

‚ÄúStop screeching,‚Äù the goddess complained as she took her hands away. Only a soft scar remained on Tallah‚Äôs bleached skin, a ring around the midpoint between wrist and elbow to mark where the arm had been severed. ‚ÄúDaughter Silestra, if you have some poppy or snapper‚Äôs stem, they should be sufficient to numb the pain. There‚Äôs a good girl.‚Äù

Luna had come out from wherever it had hidden and climbed back up Vergil‚Äôs shoulder to stare at the goddess. She, in turned, stared back.

‚ÄúWonderful little creature.‚Äù Panacea scratched the spider across its back. ‚ÄúBring this one too, when you come. I‚Äôd love to make a study of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúUhm‚Ä¶‚Äù Vergil stammered, his mouth opening and closing several time. ‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you said you‚Äôll get to me. Do you know something about me? Can you tell me why I‚Äôm here?‚Äù",1,1730194506.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I finally managed to get Ventura installed after about a week of quirks and configs.

Had a bit of trouble with EXITBS errors before but got mad and started over for the 5th time and with -igfxvesa added to the boot-args, with that managed to get the OS installed. After installed it took a bunch of time to get HW Acceleration but with a bit of trial and error everything is OK.

Now I need to do a bit of optimization in order to get the most juice out of the system, if anyone has any tips please share them.

She just knows the best, always criticises my coffee, soda consumption or subtly criticise my cooking and how i look.

Also, I broke my feet yesterday and this morning before my partner leaves she prepared a small breakfast table, and asked me if I was eating. I really found it weird as I need physical help at the moment as I cannot get up and prepare myself something. And she only poured him some tea and herself.

J: Aren‚Äôt you tired of questions about your age?

D: No, there were so many questions about my age, I got used to them. At first, I was confused. But I was 33, and now I‚Äôm 41. And the amount of these questions is even greater now. My favourite question: ‚ÄúDo you know that you will be 42 at the Olympics?‚Äù Well, thank you for reminding me.

///

J: What is the difference between recovery process when you are 20 and when you are 40?
D: First of all, I need more time to warmup. I always come to the ice rink at least in one hour before the beginning of the training session. I‚Äôm jealous when girls enter the changing room in just 5 minutes before the training. Of course, I‚Äôm trying to explain them how their body won‚Äôt be grateful for it, but who listens to an old woman?

///

J: Can you afford a glass of alcohol?

D: No, even a glass of wine will be excreted from the body for 28 days. When you need to be in your prime physical condition, you can‚Äôt afford it. I had a glass of good wine in the plane  when returning from the World Championship in Japan. That‚Äôs all - one glass in a year.

J: What about the New Year celebration? Maybe champagne?

D: No, right after Christmas we have Nationals, so it‚Äôs not a right moment.

J: Well, the question about sweet lemonades is silly, isn‚Äôt it?

D: Right, I don‚Äôt drink lemonades. Only water or coffee, don‚Äôt forget that I‚Äôm from North America. One person asked me why I continued drinking coffee after returning to sports. Well, how can I live without coffee? Especially when I have to get up at 4am for a training.

I can relate with that.

And then there's some who would say count your blessins. And yea we can find numerous of things to be grateful and happy about.

Pero hear me out here, if we count our blessings and everything that we can rationalize as something to ve grateful for, are we depriving ourselves the true essence of happiness, the genuine thing where it doesnt need rationalization?

Example: I am not happy with life, the government, inflation, my work, lets say my work is so toxic and I have a terrible boss. 

Do I rationalize and say 'ahh at least I have a work' instead of thinking, I need to do something and find something that will really make me happy. A supportive boss. A conducive work environment?

Do I just focus on the small things like the taste of my first sip of coffee in the morning? Isnt that shoving my issues under the rug just so I can feel that temporary bliss that we call gratitude and happiness?

I mean there is a big difference if you truly appreciate what you have, but if you are really noy happy, I think that is a sign from the universe to pursue what really makes us happy.

Do the pics make sense? No. No they dont. But its all my dumbass took. Does the project make sense? No idea, but its been fun. Its the second piece i've ever built and for some reason smth that was way outside my technical skill is what my heart desired.

I 'designed' either a great space efficient coffee/dining table combo or a devious trap to my unsuspecting loved ones - By joining two solutions one is legs on hinges that i got from here:

https://www.familyhandyman.com/project/coffee-dining-table/?_cmp=stf

So that the table moves up and down.

And a draw leaf design which i got from combining youtube videos, old ikea manuals, old ass magazines. Closest thing is this:

https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-a-Dutch-Draw-Leaf-Dining-Table/

And some details from stuff that i like (mostly modern furniture and japanese furniture but thats aesthetics that ill likely not pull off anyway fml).

Point is, its all plywood. Im in spain and baltic birch seems oddly rare here for some reason (just moved here). So i got this thing called 'Okum√©' plywood. Im concerned if the legs will hold or not. They are 4cm thick by laminating the ply and i think around 6cm wide at the base and 3.5 at the leg. 

Did i Fuck up?

Please help!!! ,"Hey everyone. Something happened recently that made me very uncomfortable but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking it or it‚Äôs something that I should be genuinely concerned about. 

Some backstory. Myself (23F) and my friend (24M) -I‚Äôll call him Max for this (obviously not his actual name for the sake of anonymity) have been friends since I was 20 years old. I moved back to my hometown after a year of trauma with a man who was much older than me who left me utterly destroyed. I was in a really bad space and abusing substances. I met Max on a dating site and we met up. That led to half a year of us hooking up. But we both realised that the sex was just available and not really what either of us wanted. He was really just THERE for me. Whenever I needed him. When I was waved from drug abuse he helped me through it and made sure I was safe when I fell off. I really REALLY wish we had never been intimate because he has become one of my best friends. 

The current situation is that I have been with my boyfriend (M24) for a little over 2 years now. And I know a lot of people do not agree with female/male bestfriends when you‚Äôre in a relationship but I made it very clear to my boyfriend when I met him that Max was a part of my life, of course when it comes to any insecurities or discomfort that he has regarding Max we do find compromises. Luckily for us Max had been travelling for the past year and only got back recently. Because I haven‚Äôt seen him in so long I of course made a point of seeing him and catching up. Some things have already transpired that I‚Äôve discussed with my boyfriend, when it comes to Max still being very physically affectionate towards me and saying things that are inappropriate. Never inappropriate in a sexual way. But there was one incident when he texted me and called me his ‚Äúsweet love‚Äù I may sound like a complete idiot for not immediately clocking that as suspicious, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt because I know he‚Äôs just strange and says things without really thinking about it because I do the same thing sometimes. If you have raging adhd I think you‚Äôd get me. Of course this pissed my boyfriend off and he has been iffy about Max since then. I have already spoken to Max about my boundaries when it comes to saying things like that or being too physically affectionate with me because even though I don‚Äôt see it as anything that deep I don‚Äôt want to disrespect my boyfriend. I also don‚Äôt like being touched in general. 

The most recent issue. Which I really hope isn‚Äôt what I think it is. And I‚Äôm going to take a moment to be fully self-aware and say, if this is what I‚Äôm starting to feel it is, and he is still holding onto something that has long passed, I think the reason that I‚Äôm in denial is because I really do value our friendship, he means a lot to me and if he makes it known that he has feelings for me I would end the friendship immediately. I love my boyfriend, with all my heart. I wouldn‚Äôt continue to interact with someone who intended to disrespect my relationship. I‚Äôm really hoping this isn‚Äôt the case because I love him as a friend. Maybe I‚Äôm ignoring the signs and unintentionally stringing him along which I don‚Äôt want to do and I fear that a conversation needs to be had. 

What happened was that, we went out for an unintentional beach day. It really just happened. Side note: I had been working temporarily with his mom so I was close by and he was down to hang out. Afterwards we went back to his place and the thing about his parents house is that they have this really amazing bath tub. I only have a shower at home so when I saw it for the first time I asked his mom if I could bath there the next time I visited. Maybe that‚Äôs weird? I don‚Äôt know. 
We get back and he told me he was going to run me a bath. He then lit candles. I then went into said bathroom with candles, and before leaving he tried to hug me, I turned so that he just hugged my side body and kinda curled away from him. 
Then he left and said I can lock the door if I wanted to which I imagine was his way of making me feel comfortable. I found it really weird and my gut instinct told me it was weird. I told my boyfriend immediately afterward. And then myself, my boyfriend, Max and some other friends all went out this weekend and my boyfriend finally lost his shit at him, the three of us were in the bathroom together üò≥‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è where he told him if he ever does weird shit like that again he was going to beat his ass and Max apologised and said he didn‚Äôt realise it was that strange.

My boyfriend, bless his soul. Has been very understanding because he knows where I stand and he doesn‚Äôt want to keep me from my friends, we have put more boundaries in place, such as, he isn‚Äôt allowed in our place and I won‚Äôt go out with him at night anymore and restrict our friend dates to getting coffee or going to the beach etc. But because of my own personal morals I don‚Äôt want to hang out with someone who might just be still trying to get into my pants.

	‚Ä¢	**Siri Revamp**: Siri has undergone a significant transformation, both visually and functionally, to respond more fluidly to voice commands‚Äîeven if the user pauses or rephrases mid-command. It now allows users to type queries, which can be a discreet way to use the assistant in quiet settings, and provides device-specific guidance on using Apple products. However, instructions are text-only, which may be less user-friendly compared to illustrated guides.  


	‚Ä¢	**Priority Messages in Mail**: Apple Intelligence scans incoming emails to identify those that may be high-priority and highlights them in a dedicated inbox section at the top of the app. This helps users focus on essential messages without sifting through everything in their inbox, particularly useful for users who don‚Äôt meticulously clean out their mail and may overlook important emails amid clutter.  


	‚Ä¢	**Smart Replies in Mail**: This feature suggests quick, AI-generated responses based on the content of an email, similar to the smart reply options available on platforms like Gmail. Although it‚Äôs not for everyone, the functionality is ideal for users who want to respond on the go with minimal typing, especially in high-email environments where brief, efficient replies can save time.  


	‚Ä¢	**Message and Notification Summaries**: Apple Intelligence now generates concise summaries of incoming emails and messages, providing an easy-to-read preview that helps users understand the content before opening. Summaries also appear in lock screen notifications, giving a quick overview of message content at a glance. While it generally works well, it can struggle with casual or fragmented language often found in texts, as well as shorter emails.  


	‚Ä¢	**Memory Movie Creation in Photos**: The Photos app can now auto-generate a movie from selected images based on a user-provided text prompt, organizing visuals into a cohesive slideshow. The feature allows for personal customization‚Äîusers can edit the soundtrack, title, filters, and even individual images‚Äîmaking it an appealing, user-friendly option for creating sentimental or thematic videos from photo collections.  


	‚Ä¢	**Clean Up Tool in Photos**: This new tool enhances images with AI-powered adjustments, which can be applied to both new and older photos in the gallery. While it works well for straightforward edits, such as brightening and contrast, it‚Äôs not yet as robust as competing brands for complex image retouching. It‚Äôs a convenient option for users who want quick fixes without leaving the Photos app.  


	‚Ä¢	**Natural Language Search in Photos**: Users can now find images simply by describing what‚Äôs in them, which ideally would make searches faster and more intuitive. However, the search relies on precise terms, meaning it might miss images that don‚Äôt strictly match the search word (e.g., searching ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù may exclude items with related words like ‚Äúespresso‚Äù), making it less comprehensive than some might expect.  


	‚Ä¢	**Phone Call Transcription and Recording**: Apple Intelligence can transcribe and record calls, a feature that‚Äôs stored in the Notes app for easy access. This is helpful for capturing important conversations or meeting details, though its accuracy depends on the proximity of the phone to the speaker and background noise. Summarization is also available within these transcriptions, providing quick highlights of key discussion points.  


**Coming Soon in iOS 18.2**:

	‚Ä¢	**Image Playground, Image Wand, and Genmoji**: These anticipated tools will add creative flexibility, letting users generate custom images or avatars. Genmoji, for instance, aims to create unique, AI-driven emojis tailored to users, while Image Playground and Image Wand will likely support artistic and imaginative visual creations.

	‚Ä¢	**Visual Intelligence**: This tool is expected to give more contextually aware image analysis, identifying detailed aspects of photos. For example, it could distinguish specific objects, landmarks, or environments, though it may be limited to the latest iPhone models to handle the processing requirements.

	‚Ä¢	**Enhanced Siri Actions**: The forthcoming Siri updates will include the ability to take more context-sensitive actions within apps and generate responses tailored to a user‚Äôs personal profile. This could transform Siri from a basic assistant to a more integrated, personalized helper with expanded functionality across multiple apps and situations.

1gepzr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/visualsnow/comments/1gepzr5/symptoms_getting_better/,Symptoms getting better,"I tried everything to get a better eye sight again. I guit smoking, do a lot of Sports (it's really a lot), no alcohol, etc. But there was one thing I didn't want to quit. Coffee. I love coffee. I had an espresso machine and a V60 and was at r/espresso a lot. At work I drank like 3-5 coffees per day and very low amounts of Water because I'm very lazy. 

I did a little bit of research and found that coffee can be overstimulating. Especially when consumed the way I did. I'm now on day 2 without any caffeine and instantly got sick. I explain this because if you drink so much coffee there's a lot of cortisol that prevents from getting sick like u do naturally.

I struggle with severe VSS since half a year and photophobia and dry eyes. Opthalmologist said my eyes are perfectly fine but dry. Did a CT at the neurologist and its all fine. My doctor said If those doctors don't find anything its because of stress. And yess, I'm that kind of person that gets stressed easily, but Coffee is causing more stress hormones plus the overstimulation. I also have ADHD and heard that a lot of people with ADHD get photophobia and VSS symptoms.

This night I figured that I can see better in the dark again ant the VSS symptoms aren't that ""flashy"" anymore but grey, so not that irritating. The light sensitivity/photophobia isn't that severe anymore. 
I also had a lot of brainfog and could't remember shit like names. Even if I tried very hard. Hope it gets better.

Coffee is also the plant that is sprayed with Pesticides and herbicides like no other plant. I'm afraid that my body couldn't handle the nestl√© instant coffee at work. 

I will make an edit after a week and tell if it's better or not. ",3,1730191840.0,visualsnow,0,1.0,False
1gepzn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gepzn8/i_think_my_guy_friend_might_be_playing_the_long/,I think my guy friend might be playing the ‚Äúlong game‚Äù but I‚Äôm not sure because his social cues are cooked. Please help!!! ,"Hey everyone. Something happened recently that made me very uncomfortable but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking it or it‚Äôs something that I should be genuinely concerned about. 

Some backstory. Myself (23F) and my friend (24M) -I‚Äôll call him Max for this (obviously not his actual name for the sake of anonymity) have been friends since I was 20 years old. I moved back to my hometown after a year of trauma with a man who was much older than me who left me utterly destroyed. I was in a really bad space and abusing substances. I met Max on a dating site and we met up. That led to half a year of us hooking up. But we both realised that the sex was just available and not really what either of us wanted. He was really just THERE for me. Whenever I needed him. When I was waved from drug abuse he helped me through it and made sure I was safe when I fell off. I really REALLY wish we had never been intimate because he has become one of my best friends. 

The current situation is that I have been with my boyfriend (M24) for a little over 2 years now. And I know a lot of people do not agree with female/male bestfriends when you‚Äôre in a relationship but I made it very clear to my boyfriend when I met him that Max was a part of my life, of course when it comes to any insecurities or discomfort that he has regarding Max we do find compromises. Luckily for us Max had been travelling for the past year and only got back recently. Because I haven‚Äôt seen him in so long I of course made a point of seeing him and catching up. Some things have already transpired that I‚Äôve discussed with my boyfriend, when it comes to Max still being very physically affectionate towards me and saying things that are inappropriate. Never inappropriate in a sexual way. But there was one incident when he texted me and called me his ‚Äúsweet love‚Äù I may sound like a complete idiot for not immediately clocking that as suspicious, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt because I know he‚Äôs just strange and says things without really thinking about it because I do the same thing sometimes. If you have raging adhd I think you‚Äôd get me. Of course this pissed my boyfriend off and he has been iffy about Max since then. I have already spoken to Max about my boundaries when it comes to saying things like that or being too physically affectionate with me because even though I don‚Äôt see it as anything that deep I don‚Äôt want to disrespect my boyfriend. I also don‚Äôt like being touched in general. 

The most recent issue. Which I really hope isn‚Äôt what I think it is. And I‚Äôm going to take a moment to be fully self-aware and say, if this is what I‚Äôm starting to feel it is, and he is still holding onto something that has long passed, I think the reason that I‚Äôm in denial is because I really do value our friendship, he means a lot to me and if he makes it known that he has feelings for me I would end the friendship immediately. I love my boyfriend, with all my heart. I wouldn‚Äôt continue to interact with someone who intended to disrespect my relationship. I‚Äôm really hoping this isn‚Äôt the case because I love him as a friend. Maybe I‚Äôm ignoring the signs and unintentionally stringing him along which I don‚Äôt want to do and I fear that a conversation needs to be had. 

What happened was that, we went out for an unintentional beach day. It really just happened. Side note: I had been working temporarily with his mom so I was close by and he was down to hang out. Afterwards we went back to his place and the thing about his parents house is that they have this really amazing bath tub. I only have a shower at home so when I saw it for the first time I asked his mom if I could bath there the next time I visited. Maybe that‚Äôs weird? I don‚Äôt know. 
We get back and he told me he was going to run me a bath. He then lit candles. I then went into said bathroom with candles, and before leaving he tried to hug me, I turned so that he just hugged my side body and kinda curled away from him. 
Then he left and said I can lock the door if I wanted to which I imagine was his way of making me feel comfortable. I found it really weird and my gut instinct told me it was weird. I told my boyfriend immediately afterward. And then myself, my boyfriend, Max and some other friends all went out this weekend and my boyfriend finally lost his shit at him, the three of us were in the bathroom together üò≥‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è‚òÉÔ∏è where he told him if he ever does weird shit like that again he was going to beat his ass and Max apologised and said he didn‚Äôt realise it was that strange. I really did think prior to this it was simply a struggle with not understanding boundaries because of his neurodivergence but that was a very strange and uncomfortable experience and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was trying to test the waters that day to see if I was open to doing something more with him. 

My boyfriend, bless his soul. Has been very understanding because he knows where I stand and he doesn‚Äôt want to keep me from my friends, we have put more boundaries in place, such as, he isn‚Äôt allowed in our place and I won‚Äôt go out with him at night anymore and restrict our friend dates to getting coffee or going to the beach etc. But because of my own personal morals I don‚Äôt want to hang out with someone who might just be still trying to get into my pants. It makes me feel icky because then, we aren‚Äôt really friends are we? It‚Äôs onesided and he‚Äôs just waiting for a moment of weakness on my part‚Ä¶
I know I need to speak to him about it I just don‚Äôt know how to go about it, which is why I would like some advice. I really hope this isn‚Äôt what is actually going on because it would hurt so much. ",0,1730191826.0,Advice,4,0.5,False

	‚Ä¢	**Writing Tools**: This suite includes advanced proofreading that goes beyond simple autocorrect, rephrasing options, and an adaptable tone feature with Friendly, Professional, and Concise options. It also offers summarization, key point extraction, and the ability to format text into lists or tables, making it ideal for summarizing articles or reorganizing information with ease.

1gepqq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1gepqq0/september_trip_report_part_i_tokyo_kanazawa/,September Trip Report Part I (Tokyo - Kanazawa - Hakone - Osaka),"While I was researching my holiday to Japan, I had a lot of help from these kind of trip reports. So I thought I'd pay it forward and share my own experiences from our recent holiday, end of august/first half september . It ended up being more of a diary-entry style of post than I'd set out to do, so apologies for it turning out massive (and having to split it into 2 posts). But I had a lot of fun reminiscing about all the wonderful moments we had in Japan, so I can only hope some people will enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

***ABOUT US:***

Two Belgians, 35(m) and 35(f), first time in Japan. Very broad tastes, with a big focus on food and drink culture. Normally not hugely into shopping, but we did find ourselves doing so (and spending) a lot more in Japan than we'd done in other countries. I also really get into photography while on holiday. So if a place feels a bit meh, but I manage to get some good photos out of it, I still feel like I had a pretty good time.

***BUDGET SPENT:***

Per person, our flights were about 1000‚Ç¨. Hotels ended up almost the same, around 1000‚Ç¨ for 19 nights, with the ryokan and shokubo stays bumping the overall price a bit. We did manage to get some amazing deals (under 80‚Ç¨ pp for 4 nights in Osaka!), so doing some research can really reduce those costs. We started off with 1500‚Ç¨ pp in yen from the bank, and had to draw some more spending money twice. Did some of the more expensive dinners and shopping on visa, but mostly used cash.

Entire costs turned out at 4200‚Ç¨ per person, which we're pretty happy with.

***PRACTICAL STUFF AND OVERALL THINGS PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ASKING ABOUT:***

* My main tip, and everyone says this but I feel like I have to emphasize: make sure you've got solid, comfy, well-worn shoes. Maybe even 2 pairs so you can switch it up. In Japan, you're going to be doing a lot of walking; doesn't matter how easy-going you think you're going to be, you'll be hitting at least 15k steps on a lot of days. My biggest issues during this trip were blisters on my feet, and I had to buy quite a few blister plasters to try and sort that out. And a little bonus tip for people who aren't huge hikers: start getting in your daily 10k steps a month or 2 before your trip. It really does help getting your legs into the habit of doing a bit of walking every single day.
* We used Google Maps for everything and it never once steered me wrong. There's a slight learning curve to using it on the public transportation, but by our second or third day it's second nature. Just make sure you look at the final destination so you know you're going the right direction, and take notice of which yellow exit you have to take. It was as intuitive and free of hassle as I could possibly imagine public transportation being.
* For internet we had a pocket wifi from Japan-Wireless delivered to our hotel. Worked brilliantly. Only slight issue is you have to recharge it during the day with a powerbank they supplied. So sometimes we'd lose internet in the evening, and it'd be because I forgot to recharge our wifi. Really small issue really, but it is another set of batteries you'll have to manage. An e-sim is probably even easier if your phones are high-tech enough, but the overall wifi experience was pretty flawless.
* Get a Suica-Card. You can obviously keep buying individual tickets for single trips, and in the short term that's not really a problem. But an IC-card will make traversing cities 10 times easier, so I'd call it borderline essential.
* Luggage delivery is a gift from the traveling-Gods. We used it 3 times, and it cost us (two large bags) 5,200 yen per transport. And I'd honestly recommend it if it was 2 or even 3 times that price. Really makes traveling absolutely stress-free, and it really is a wonderful feeling to be able to enjoy your first experiences when stepping out into a new place, instead of having to drag this big heavy block behind you. The amount of comfort and ease of mind it provides it pretty much unparalleled.
* I'd highly recommend against planning specific restaurants, except for special meals. There can be big lines for a specific place when you don't really want to wait. Or a restaurant can be quite a bit out of the way from where you think you are going to be. I just couldn't imagine having to worry about making sure I'd get to a specific location for my meals, seeing as there are hundreds if not thousands of decent restaurants pretty much anywhere. I'd recommend making a list of specific dishes you want to try, and finding restaurants near you on the fly, ticking off those boxes. Don't completely trap yourself into your travel-planning, and leave room for some spontaneity. We often just searched google and reddit for some options while on the train or in the hotelroom, which lead us to some of the best meals we had on the entire trip.
* The garbage issue is real, but overall not that big of a problem. Garbage cans on the streets are few and far between, but you'll be able to deposit your empty bottles near a lot of the vending machines, and most konbini's will have garbage cans inside the stores. Just put your garbage in a bag and you'll probably be able to dump it somewhere within 30 minutes.
* We didn't have many issues with hotels. My gf spent a lot of time doing research to make sure we had spacious hotels with large beds, and we felt they were all adequate. By Western standards some may have been a tad small, but never really an issue. We also didn't have a single instance where we were bothered by noise coming from other rooms. We mostly only use our hotelrooms for showering and sleeping, though, so mileage may vary.
* We both adapt pretty well to hot weather. So the Japanese 35¬∞ at high humidity - although being really hot - never really fazed us, and we never had to resort to cooling neckbraces or fans. But the sun can really burn, and you will be sweating a whole lot. I bought some deodorant and simply took it with me everywhere so I could spray a couple of times during the day. But although the sun could be pretty harsh, we never got sunburnt. I'd say the whiplash you'd get from the freezing airconditionings were a bigger hurdle for us than the actual heat.
* The language barrier was so so so much better than we thought it'd be. The people are super friendly and many of them speak decent English, especially in the cities. And when they don't speak English, pointing at things with a couple of basic phrases gets you 99% of the way. My main takeaway is that people really, really like you just making an effort. Don't be that tourist who's loudly saying ""THANK YOU"", just learn some basic sentences and you'll see quite a lot of people light up and going the extra mile to accommodate you.

The phrases I learned and used quite a lot:

* Konichiwa / Konbanwa - Hello / Good evening
* Sumimasen - Excuse me (for apologising, or getting attention from someone)
* Arrigato Gozaimasu - Thank you
* Hai - Yes
* Kore - This (when pointing at a menu or something)
* Daijobu - I'm ok (when people ask if you need a plastic bag or anything like that)
* Okaikei kudosai - check please (a really big one that people clearly appreciated)
* Chotto matte, kudosai - Could you wait for one moment, please
* Eigo de daijobu deska - Is English ok? (Probably really butchered that, but had to use it twice and it got the job done both times)

Right, so now that all that's out of the way: the actual trip!

***THE ACTUAL TRIP:***

**DAY 0:** **Arrival**

Arrived slightly after midnight at Haneda, where a very friendly gentleman explained to us in perfect English how and where we could get an IC-card. We then took a cab for around 10.000 yen to our hotel: MONday in Asakusa. Very friendly check-in, we had some tickets and pocket wi-fi sent beforehand and everything was there, without any problems. This was our first contact with the Japanese organisation and friendliness, and it basically didn't change for the duration of our trip. Literally every single person we met was helpful and kind, and everything everywhere is clearly defined and communicated. On a cultural level, it really is the perfect location to go on holiday.

**DAY 1: Asakusa** *(steps: 23.000)*

People often seem to be asking what part of Tokyo to stay in, and we couldn't have been happier that we started our trip out in Asakusa. It seems to offer a lot of what makes Tokyo great, but doesn't feel as overwhelming or crowded as some other areas tend to be. Seeing how you'll likely be jetlagged and slightly overwhelmed by the new culture, Asakusa seemed like a great place to get our bearings. We also opted not to use any public transportation on our first day, and just took everything in at our own pace.

We visited **Senso-Ji** at around 10u00. It was quite crowded, but the temple complex is so large that it never felt too dense with people, and we enjoyed our first of many, many temples. Walked around through the neighbourhood snacking on some decent tonkatsu sando's, konbini onigiri and took our first stab at trying out random drinks (we chose... poorly). We then came across the **Don Quijote** store we heard so much about, so we decided to have a quick look around. Two hours later we re-emerged, wondering where the time had gone. This is also the point where I started singing the Donqui theme for 20 days straight.

After quickly freshening up at our hotel room (the jetlag was real, and wreaking havoc on my digestive system), we went to **Kappabashi**, specifically because I wanted to buy a new kitchen knife. We were expecting a cozy shopping-street, so we were a bit disappointed to see kappabashi just being a normal street with lots of traffic running through. We entered some shops, but honestly they all felt very samey, so we quickly went back to the most hospitable one with the most friendly owners, and bought a knife. The shops which do the plastic food-props are fun to see (and sell nifty keychains), but besides that I'd say Kappabasi is an easy skip unless you're doing some serious shopping. It's more of a functional place than it is a charming one.

Finished off the evening at the **Asahi Sky Room**, which was brilliant. We didn't do the Skytree or anything like that so I can't compare, but having a nice beer to sip on while watching the sunset hit the skyline simply can't be beat. Plus: entrance is free, so that's a big win. Went for some quick conveyor belt sushi at **Sushi Hinatomaru Asakusa Main Store**, which was fine. It still was a revelation compared to the type of sushi we're used to getting at home, but nowhere near the best we would have on the trip. We went back to **Senso-Ji** at nighttime, which dramatically changed the atmosphere and it's really fun to see the same place in such a stark contrast when the crowds have evaporated. I should also add that this trip was right around the time typhoon Shanshan hit Japan, so we enjoyed some gigantic downpours on our way back to the hotel.

**DAY 2: Shibuya / Shinjuku** *(steps: 29.000)*

Torrential rains were still falling down as we went for some konbini-breakfast. This would quickly turn into a staple of most mornings, with a nice coffee and an eggsalad or tonkatsu sando and - when I really got into vacation-mode - some fried chicken or currypan on the side. Double deep-fried for breakfast really is the best life.

The typhoon-rainfall made some of the subway-lines run late and a couple were even canceled. Luckily we didn't have any issues as we headed to Shibuya. Got out to see the **Shibuya Crossing**, which was honestly a whole lot of nothing. Might have been because of the rain showering down but it didn't even feel like the biggest or busiest crossing we'd see that day. Went to the Parco for some drinks and check out the **Nintendo, Capcom and Jump store**. Which was, you know, fine. I'd probably gone mental for this some years ago, but if you're not really into buying ""random crap that lays around in a drawer"" anymore, there isn't a whole lot to see. Had as much fun just wandering around the other stores. Picked up a Japanese national team football jersey from a KAMO, which is honestly a really great souvenir. This was an idea I picked up on this sub, so thanks to that one guy who bought a jersey for his son.

Overall we didn't really vibe with Shibuya all that much; the constant music gives it this real artificial atmosphere, like you're walking around some sort of industrial Disneyland. Lots of great skyscrapers which make for some cool photography though. Went and quickly ate some average crispy noodles dish before walking through to **Meiju Jingu.** The temple itself is nice, but it's the surroundings that really take you aback. It's quite literally a 5 minute walk from the chaos of this gigantic city, and the utter tranquility of a calm, relaxing forest (where planes fly over really low). Definitely worth seeing it for that alone. Went for a quick coffee in **Harajuka**, which we expected wouldn't be for us and we weren't wrong, and then walked to Shinjuku Station to pick up a Suica Card like the nice man at the airport suggested.

**Shinjuku** was amaaaaaaazing. It's all of the chaos and sensory overload ramped up to 10, but never in a way that feels overbearing. It's superbusy and chaotic, but there's a lot of structure to the chaos which makes it all just work. We were lucky to pass by Godzilla just as the show was starting, and it honestly got to me a bit (I wasn't expecting the music to take over the entire street!). Walked around some more enjoying the neon, which makes for some sensational photos. Went into **Omoide Yokocho** somewhat hesitant, but had a lot of fun eating some increasingly weird yakitori (for those non-adventurous eaters: doublecheck you're not getting stuff like skin and hearts) and enjoying the first of many, many highballs. Also walked through **Golden Gai**, but honestly this felt a bit too intimidating for us at this point. All these tiny bars with miserable-looking middle-aged men didn't feel too inviting, possibly because it was too early in the evening. So we made a note to return here on a later date, and went back into an Omoide Yokocho izakaya where we enjoyed the rest of our night eating the most funky stuff we'd see the entire trip.

**DAY 3: Odaiba** *(steps: 19.000)*

Let this be a cautionary tale for all of you. We had Teamlab Planets tickets at 9u00, because internet told me that it's best to be there in the first group. Which in retrospect would be a bit early, especially with the public transporation not working perfectly. So I tried to rebook the tickets for 10u00, but all the slots were filled up until 19u00. So we just had to set our alarm a bit early and hope for the best.

Needless to say, I was quite gutted when we awoke at 11u00, having slept straight through our alarmclocks, our jetlag going out with one big bang. Luckily from this point on we were fully acclimatized, but it really did mess up our plans for the day.

We were planning on trying for Sushi Dai at Toyosu (yeah, hilarious, I know). So with that idea clearly in the gutter, we went to **Tsukiji Fish Market** instead. We didn't really stay all that long, but still fun to see all the carts jammed close together. There were way more souvenir-shops than we'd think, though, but the area definitely has a charm. Ate some (overpriced) bites, and decided to head to teamlabs anyway, which took about an hour longer because bus-traffic got really messed up due to - you guessed it - the typhoon.

So roughly 5 hours late for our booking we walked up to **Teamlab Planets.** The lady behind the desk simply put a post-it on my phone, we showed it at the entry, and they just let us in anyway no problem, eventhough the slot was fully booked. This has quickly become my go-to anecdote to explain to people how incredible the Japanese culture really is, as I can only imagine the hoops I'd have to jump through to try (and probably fail) to try the same thing at a museum in Europe. Either way, Teamlab is a blast if you don't set your expectations too high. There are some really cool visuals going on, and the tactility of it all really boosts the experience up another level. Some of the rooms may be a tad too instagram-centered for my liking, and I think the order of the rooms could probably have been a bit better, but for a fast, unique experience: great fun.

Finished our day at **Odaiba**, which in itself it really bizar. There are these huuuuge streets everywhere, broad enough to fit like 30 peope side by side. And it's just empty, we shared this gigantic area with probably 5 other people. I once went to the Arsenal Emirates Stadium in London while it wasn't a matchday, and it gave me the same feeling I got then. This ground that's clearly designed to fit hordes of people, virtually abandoned.

Got some quick snack at the **Diver City** food court and then went around the shops. I'd recently learned what gunpla is and was interested in checking it out while in Japan, so I thought I'd hit the Gundam Base. Turns out you have to book for entry to the store and all slots were fully booked for the entire weekend. Woops. Luckily there's also this tiny shop where you can freely go in, and they have some editions which are limited to the Gundam Base, so not a complete bust.

The other side of Odaiba (around the malls) feels a lot nicer with the ocean, statue of liberty and the Fuji Broadcasting Center building making for a real moody sundown. Had a beer while waiting for the tropical storm to pass and went into **DECKS Daiba Itchome Shotengai**, the Showa style street which was just amazing. This '80s era of Japan is definitely my favorite aeshetic in the entire Japanese culture, so I had an absolute blast walking through and taking photos. Had some fun playing some ancient arcade games (House of the Dead 2 really took me back to my childhood) in this permanent fairground. Ate some solid, forgettable ramen in the Aqua City hall, slowly realizing that we should start looking a little bit closer when picking out restaurants.

**DAY 4: Kamakura / Enoshima** *(steps: 25.000)*

Luggage safely transfered, we went on the first of many smooth, uneventful traintrips powered by Suica and Google Maps. Dropped our luggage at the excellent Tosei Hotel Cocone, went to see Hokokuji temple, and ended up accidentally entering **J≈çmy≈ç-ji** instead. Which is really excellent in its own right; it's got a main-building, a cozy teahouse and a big cemetery. Plus it's pretty calm there. Fought our way through another round of typhoon-drenchers to our intended destination of **Hokoku-ji,** which mostly seems to be about it's bamboo forest. Which was nice.

Went for lunch down Komachi street, and sadly I can't for the life of me remember the place we ate at (and can't make sense of the kanji trying to find it on google maps), because this was our first proper amazing food experience. We wanted to try the local shirasu-don, and got this set menu which included not only just that, but also soba, a collection of tempura, pickles, sashimi, tofu, and an apple jelly. Proper delicious, and all that under 2000 yen. Amazing lunch, and the first of many excellent meals.

Went to **Kotoku-in** to see the Buddha, which was fine, getting to go inside was an interesting angle. We were running a little late by this point, and the weather had turned for the absolute worst, but we still went and sought out **Enoshima,** which was absolutely amazing! I've read tons of reports of this being overcrowded, but the typhoon probably kept away a lot of the crowds. Meaning we could really enjoy ourselves hiking the many steps, seeing the shrines, enjoying the nature. We were sweating profusely, but at the same time soaking wet from the rain, while the roaring thunder was constantly looming over our heads. There were some immense views of gigantic cliffs, a sprawling ocean, breathtaking vistas, and even some wild turtles. When we eventually turned back, the typhoon suddenly made way for the absolute brightest, harshest supernova of a sunset I've ever seen in my life. With the entire island bathing in this ethereal glow of orange and purple light, this really felt like a special moment of beauty which left a huge impression. Enoshima was one of the absolute higlights of our trip, and I'd recommend everyone going to Tokyo to give it a chance.

While we went to freshen up at the hotel, the weather took another turn for the worst. So we had to step out into the apocalypse to find some food. This is where we quickly learned that Kamakura isn't Tokyo, and lots of restaurants were already closed by 20u00. So with the copious amounts of rain battering down on our flimsy umbrella, we tried to assess our options, but quickly turned around and went into one of the only places still open: **Misaku**. Again conveyor belt sushi, but the quality here was a big step up from what we had in Asakusa. Fresh fish, freshly made sushi, very reasonably prices. I really loved this Japanese type of fast food (you could literally step in and out with a full belly in 15 minutes if you wanted). Had a beer at a Turkish bar (?) before calling it a night.

**DAY 5: Kamakura / Hakone** *(steps: 23.000)*

This is the day blisters were becoming a real issue. I'm not going to keep repeating whenever my feet started hurting real bad or I had to go and buy blister plasters, because that would get real boring real fast. But heed my warning: get proper shoes.

After a lovely konbini sando breakfast we went to **Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu**, which was pretty cool. We were worried we'd get bored of temples pretty quickly, but we found many of them to be quite interesting variations on a theme. So at least visually they mostly always kept our interest. Had a wonderful coffee at a bakery, took the train to Odowara, dumped half of our belongings in a locker at the station, enjoyed some onigiri and went to Hakone.

We'd decided to do the loop clockwise as we were staying the night in Gora. I'd read somewhere you can do the first part by foot if you want. Do not do this. In 35¬∞ heat it's incredibly steep, and you're just walking next to an asphalt road the entire time, nothing idyllic or pictureque about it. Don't be a hero, take the bus, like we eventually did (after some waiting). Got off at **Amazake Chaya** and enjoyed their local beverage (recommended!), and took the walk via **Tokaido Road**. This was a way better walking experience, at least you're surrounded by nature and there's some small element of hiking. It isn't the most spectacular walk you'll do, but if you're feeling to get some more steps in, this is a fun way to do so.

Our single biggest mistake of the entire trip happened here at **Lake Ashi**. We were afraid we'd lost too much time doing the walks, but we got to the boat and saw there were still 3 departure times left. So we went and had a look at all the people queuing up for the **Hakone Shrine** (which is admittedly pretty), got a drink, relaxed a bit, and finally went to board the pirateship. Only to then find out that the final 2 departure times don't synchronize up to the loop. Meaning when we got to the ropeway, it had already closed down. Meaning we had to take an out of the way, not-included-in-the-freepass bus to get to our hotel. This ultimately meant we had to skip the Open Air Museum the next day, and we ended up doing the ropeways in some of the worst circumstances imaginable. Double check the boat times, people!

Gora is a pretty dead place, so there aren't many options for food. We decided to check out the **Yakitori Izakaya**, where we turned out to be the only 2 people there. The food was great (albeit a tad pricey, but that's izakaya's), but what really sold us on this place was the staff. Their English wasn't great, but they were so very kind and hospitable to us, which created this atmosphere that simply makes you feel incredibly welcome. The chef - who didn't speak a word of English - even came out to have a chat through Google Translate. When we eventually were halfway back to our hotel, walking through the dark abandoned streets of Gora, one of the waitresses came sprinting up to us: we'd accidentally left our roomkey on the table, and she was bursting a lung to make sure we didn't have to come back looking for it ourselves. I love the Japanese people.

Had a soak in the onsen at Hakone Tent (small tubs, felt quite comparable to a warm bath at home to be honest), and spent our first night sleeping on a futon. Turns out: way more comfortable than you'd think!

**DAY 6: Hakone / Dotonbori** *(steps: 19.000)*

Having missed half of our Hakone Loop, we had to take the bus back. After a day of nothing but sunshine and 35¬∞ heat, the typhoon once again reared its ugly head for its final act of vengeance. Heavy rains, but way worse: thick mists. We got on the ropeway, but honestly we could barely see a thing, it pretty much felt like we were traveling through a white void (which was an interesting experience in itself). The announcements were saying there was a storm approaching, which could force them to close down the ropeway entirely. So we quickly went further, and luckily managed to see a slight glimpse of **Owakudani** (30 seconds, tops, but it honestly looked like we were on a different planet). The one major bummer we faced on this trip is that we didn't get to experience Owakudani with clear skies because we took the wrong boat. Learn from our mistake, take your time to translate the kanji next to departure times!

Took the trainrides back. They're just a trainride with occasionally some nice views. Nothing wrong with them, but definitely not an attraction in their own right like some people make them out to be. Retrieved our stuff at Odowara and took our first Shinkansen. Didn't book the tickets ahead, but the machines couldn't be more clear about the process. Grabbed a lovely ekiben lunch and enjoyed the ride to Osaka.

Walked around a little bit in Osaka, but the gf had to do a oral exam via zoom at 18u00, so we went and hung around the hotelroom for a bit (FL Hotel Dotonbori; solid hotel, great location!), and went out to enjoy a night of Dotonbori.

We reaaaaally dug the vibe of Dotonbori. It kind of feels like a smalltown village festival but on a large scale, with neon lights everywhere, a huge amount of stalls, and people enjoying food literally everwhere you look. It's really infectious to see everyone around you acting with such enthousiasm, and it makes for a very positive and uplifting atmosphere. We enjoyed some takoyaki, yakitori, drinks, cremia ice cream and obviously some more takoyaki. Lovely evening.

Fun side-story: I had this really weird moment here which I can only describe as the Yakuza-effect. If you've played any of those videogames, you'll know there's a city called Sotenbori, which is fully designed after Dotonbori. And while we'd be walking past the river in Dotonbori, reaching the bridge, I'd stop my gf and say ""we have to go up on the bridge, you can't go through here"". Looking at what was a perfectly normal passage below the bridge, it really took me a couple of seconds to realise my mind was thinking of the invisible walls in the videogame. Proper mindfuck.

**DAY 7: Himeji / Kobe** *(steps: 26.000)*

Spent the morning at the beautiful **Himeji Castle**. Some of the signage in the sidebuilding felt a bit too specific, and I started zoning out halfway through. But the main castle was awesome, and we really liked how pure it is kept. There are enough displays to inform you on what you're seeing and for it to be educational, but mostly you get to experience the architecture just by walking through it, which I personally prefer to seeing lots of props behind glass. Went and got some curry and tonkatsu in some chain, which was fine, but not really any better than a Golden Curry you'd make at home (which isn't a criticism, I love Golden Curry).

Went to Kobe, mostly because we had a restaurant reservation. Walked a bit through the malls and by the coast pondering where to go next; we could check out the Herb Garden, or maybe even go up to the Kikuseidai. But we decided what we really wanted to do, and what our body was quietly craving, was to sit down and chill for a couple of hours.

A little side tangent here, but one of our biggest surprises about Japan is that people don't just seem to go out and have a drink during the day. There are coffeeshops, and there are bars that open in the evening. But simply sitting down and enjoying a beer or soda in the open air isn't really a thing in Japan. Which mainly accounts to the amount of walking you'll do. When we're traveling, we're used to walking around a bit, sitting down streetside to have a drink, and then walking around a bit more. In Japan you simply get a cold drink from the konbini and keep walking around forever. It's one of the main adjustments we had to make.

We strolled around a bit more looking at the shops before heading to our reservation at **Kobe Rogoma Kobo**. A small place that felt way more formal than the other restaurants we'd visited. We were the only guests for the first hour, which - combined with a more stoic and silent host - made us feel like we had our own private chef. The food was very solid, but obviously you're there for the Kobe steak, which really delivered. Perfectly cooked, with all that beautiful marbling beautifully rendered, it really feels like each time you chew a bit more butter gets released from the meat. While this was probably the best we had, I'd say beef in general was absolutely amazing in Japan. It's quite expensive compared to some of the other foods, but every piece we had was absolutely gorgeous. This really is how the meat-market should operate globally, but that really is another tangent not fit for this post. Took a detour through Dotonbori to try out a melonpan dessert: delicious.

**DAY 8: Osaka** *(steps: 25.000)*

Took a morning walk to **Honzenji Yokocho** (fine) and **Namba Yasaka**, which is such a fun little shrine. Pictures really don't do this one justice, with the lion's head looking like he's going to eat every single tourist who dares to pose for a picture. Headed to Umeda Station because we had to validate a voucher for bus tickets the next day, one of the few times we got proper lost in Japan. The highway bus stations can be quite tricky to locate, and we easily spent half an hour walking back and forth throughout the station.

Went to get some lunch at **Shin Umeda Shokudogai**, wandering past the hundreds of tiny restaurants crammed into these narrow streets. A proper mood. Ended up at an okonomiyaki place which was excellent. There's something very soulful about getting this amazingly hearty food, being in and out quickly to keep the line moving, but never feeling rushed or having anyone try to force you to quicken up the pace.

Took a small detour to check out **Osaka Castle** from the outside. It's pretty, but doesn't have that aura of vastness that Himeji has. Went to check out **Den Den Town**, but this basically was Koppabashi all over again. Not really a neighbourhood perse, just a bunch of shops centered around a busy road lacking any real charm. Walked through some shops and bought some stuff, before going to **Shinsekai**. Really lively place; bought some souvenirs, made some photos, ate some ok kushikatsu. Stopped by this small retro arcade to play some Street Fighter II and Super Mario Bros, but sadly I only made it to world 4 because the controls were laggy (my gf didn't believe me but I swear it's the truth!).

Went for dinner at **Shikaku**, a ramen place that specialises in an oyster-based broth. Super tasty food combined with this digital-art-exhibition interior made for a very pleasant dinner. Wanted to do get some drinks, so we went to this **PC and Retro Bar Space Station** I'd found online. There's no nice way to say this, but I really hated this place. The idea of a bar filled with retro-games sounds super fun and right up my alley. But it's jam-packed with tourists, while the host herself was American, and every word you hear spoken in this tiny room is in English. Which to me felt like a really fake atmosphere, like a circle-jerk of tourists saying to each other ""wow look at us experiencing Japan right now!"". Mileage obviously may vary, and if you like the vibe there more power to you because it obviously is a personal thing, but I couldn't get out of there fast enough. Went out and stept into a neighbouring place (I think Takotako King?) to grab a beer, which instantly felt more grounded in reality.

**DAY 9: Nijigen no Mori** *(steps: 21.000)*

Specifically went here to see the **Godzilla Museum**. You start out seeing this fantastic short film (honestly way more production value than you would imagine) and gliding into the giant Godzilla's mouth which is super fun. Afterwards there is this little shooting game that didn't feel like it was working 100% right. The museum itself was fun, some really cool props and models, but it did feel a tad underwhelming. I guess I'd imagined it being a bit bigger, since it is essentially is only one big room. The giftshop equally felt a bit uninspired, and the Godzilla-themed curry and soba we had for lunch was very average. Overall it was fine, not a bad experience in anyway, but not really worth the hassle of going out to such a remote place.

I'd probably be more disapointed if it wasn't for **Dragon Quest Island**, a super fun immersive JRPG experience. Me and my gf both dabbled a bit in Dragon Quest XI, but you don't really need any knowledge of the franchise to enjoy this place. It's like a very narrative-heavy escape room, with some very original ideas to stretch the limited resources out into what feels like quite a grand adventure. It was absolutely scorching hot at this point, and you have to do a fair bit of walking around, but we still really enjoyed ourselves. Kind of wish we had the time to do the side quest.

For our final evening we returned to the ever vibrant Dotonbori. Ate some more takoyaki, amazing fried octopus, yakisoba, and really good kushikatsu from the place with the big face. Gf had a list of skincare products she wanted to get from the Don Quijote, so we went to the one near the water with the ferriswheel: horrible experience. The store was simply way too crowded, and any form of etiquette among the customers had long gone. We had to give up on trying to get any shopping done in these Lord of the Flies circumstances, so we instead went to unwind at the **Elephant Bar**. Just next to the Retro Space Station, but instead of being shoulder-to-shoulder with fellow tourists, you could simply enjoy playing Nintendo 64 out on the porch while the friendly Japanese owner is making smalltalk and blasting Black Sabbath. It's the little things that make all the difference.

And with that, we were done in Osaka, and the first half of our trip. If you're wondering what Kyoto and the Japanese Alps had in store for us; you should really go and read Part II.",1,1730190673.0,JapanTravel,1,1.0,False

1gepo2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/JDorama/comments/1gepo2k/jdrama_recommendations_please/,Jdrama recommendations please,"Hi guys

Can I get some recommendations on some jdrama‚Äôs that might peak my interest?

A little backstory of myself, I watch and read anime/manga most of my life and a genre I always go towards is romcom‚Äôs a lot. I‚Äôve watched near almost all romcoms in anime format and a sizable chunk in manga. When I was in highschool my Japanese teacher put up a few different jdramas while I was in class like

1. My boss my hero
2. GTO
3. Hana Yori dango

In my own time after watching 1-2 episodes of each of these in class I binged the rest of the episodes and enjoyed them immensely. I‚Äôve watched Hana kimi which was on Crunchyroll at one point and also enjoyed it. I think out of the 4 I‚Äôve seen I really liked GTO and Hana yori dango the most. For GTO I really liked onizuka‚Äôs personality and morales while for Hana yori dango I liked how much of a badass makino was throughout the show and even she has a vulnerable side when the going gets tough with a bit of a prince like character sweeping in to save her. 

I think I‚Äôve watched a few episodes of a show called coffee prince with my sister but I didn‚Äôt like it much when I was young, maybe my opinions might change if I give it a second shot but otherwise there is 1 other k drama I watched but it was about 6 boys I think and they all have to live together and I think they all compete for one of them gets a inheritance or rich if they complete some objective or mission. That‚Äôs all I can think of in terms of dramas I watched.

Please give me any recommendations if you think I would like it. 

Thank you!

I've been using it without a problem for the past two years but lately it's been acting up. for a while it kept making this loud clicking sound when it ejects the puck, and the pucks are always very wet and mushy. I figured as long as it kept making coffee it's probably ok, but recently it's just given up.

For starters the ""slide to unlock brew unit"" switch is a little funky now, I need to manually lift the catch arm and slide it back under... I'm not explaining it very well but in any case it seems that something's a little funky.

 I can get one cup of coffee out of it, but then when I try the second it will grind the beans, they go into the hopper, then it seemingly can't figure out how to press it. it clicks 4-5 times then says ""clean brew unit."" and I have to take everything apart. At this point I'm wondering if I should buy a new brew unit all together. 

  
any thoughts / advice? has anyone had a simmilar experience? I love this machine and it's been a real life and wallet saver, I just don't know if it's finally time to get a new one, or if I could just replace the brew unit. I don't want to blow $100+ on a new brew unit to find out it's a more serious problem and then have to go spending an additional 400-600 on a new machine...",1,1730190174.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

I haven't taken vitamins for a long time and I figured I probably should do that.

I'm very picky, I don't eat any veggies or fruits.. I eat lots of beef, chicken,  bologna sandwiches, cheese,  spaghetti, beans, beef stew( carrots I like here), pork, eggs, potatoes are god send, burgers etc.  All plain but I like seasoning. Nothing spicy. I air fry so luckily I don't use oil really ever. 

Also, I do love food, usually drink coffee in the morning, soda when I eat (2-3 times a day, not including snacks and I don't exercise but I have water with me all the time. Not a 3 drink person cause I'm picky and don't mind water after countless UTIs in high-school. 

Any suggestions on stuff?

Is there a test the doctors can do to see what I'm missing?

Any tips or advice welcome.

My ASM said she was happy for me but sad to see me go. A lot of my co-workers didn't believe me, but, I got a lot of congratulations and fist bumps and hugs. DS let me take one last joy ride around the store in the forklift and I went for a late night coffee with a coworker at the end of shift.

Peace out HD ‚úåüèº
