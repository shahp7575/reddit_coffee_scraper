It took a very long time to get myself out of bed again and so everything else I did today was delayed. Good news is I did write but I dd not bother going upstairs to do it. I did a little more work on my outline and then wrote off and on downstairs. I just didn't feel like dragging my book and heater upstairs. My mind was relatively bright and ready to work but my body needed to do as little as possible for a little while.

I wrote a decent 556 words for I'm Still Sisyphus. Not the shinning highs of yesterday but more than a decent amount of work for one lazy Saturday. I may write a little more tonight, in fact. My eyes are dropping now but I'm sure a coffee will brighten my mind up again to get a little more done. I came up with a lot of new ideas for how to end this scene off last night - keeping myself up for longer than I wanted to - and I still haven't quite gotten to add them. I'm sure I can find it in myself to add another few hundred words; Might help me sleep a little better tonight.

Yours & Mine,

NOTE: I wrote this scene as a method-type exercise in writing -- to include exploring aspects of -- a darker, psychological, and realistic flavor of fiction. I normally lean heavy towards adventure (think The Mummy), sci-fi (think space survival), or gothic horror (think Stoker). I denounce and abhor the manipulation and taking advantage of vulnerable people. I wrote this scene with the core inspiration being a very obscure movie named Ripley Under Ground. 

Gerald, the character, is a very grimey, desperate, and arguably twisted personality, but he was intentionally designed that way for the purpose of the sandbox I was writing for.   
\------------------  
The phone vibrated with condescending urgency.



<Where the fuck were you?>

Gerald winced, took a deep breath in, and emptied his lungs. Bald male, forty-three, overweight, greasy, fake gold chains—and yet holding him by the balls courtesy of the five thousand dollars in advance to secure a pint-sized gallery just outside the museum district. All the spicy salami rolls, cheap champagne, and constant snorting had fried the scumbag’s voice into dog-ear heavens.

“What do you want, Manuel?”

<You know what I want,> hissed the man on the other end, <my fucking money back.>

“That was not our deal.”

Gerald took in half the mug, praying that whatever cheap industrial caffeine inside could take away half the pain in three seconds.

<The deal was twice my money by the end of this month, you fucking prick. Old Chen said you ain’t even delivered one painting.>

He spoke the truth.

“Look, I got them all sitting right here. Right here in my apartment—”

<I don’t care where the fuck they are. If I don’t get your end of the deal at the end of your pathetic show? You'd better be gone from Pinklines the day after, or I will make you wish you had stayed in your backwater trash heap of a town you called home.>

And just like that, half the pain was gone. Twenty-three seconds—unlikely to be the coffee’s work.

.

.

. 

Gerald slumped in his rickety chair. He had twenty days left to deliver ten thousand dollars in cash to the shark. No painting. No inspiration. Not even enough money to cover the month’s rent. He was already one step into the noose.

But how was any of this Gerald’s fault? Art wasn’t a kind mistress. She could be there one second and gone the next. Bloodshot eyes darted around the room, looking for answers from dirty, faded wallpaper. Did the Triads still take kidneys?

The thirty-something let his fingers flip through the papers on the table, absent-minded. His attention was already long gone from the search for answers. It had moved on to echoes of flash photography, unlimited catering, and the sight of Rosh—his most hated arch-enemy—faking his way through the upper class’ tranches. The bastard had to have sold his soul to the deepest level of hell for the amount of luck he received: one successful exhibition after another. All spineless, tasteless, wispy, pretentious garbage. Gerald could still taste the same flavor of disgust in the back of his throat.

And yet…

Gerald wiped everything off the tabletop, screaming as the shakers, the mug, and his phone hit the vinyl floor.

The fraud had had the gall to offer him—him, a true master—a business card.

.

Gerald walked toward his studio as if in a trance—his second bedroom, his safe space, his temple, his slipping gallows. Lush carpets lined one corner of the space where all the beanbags were. On the other side were the tools of his trade, angry and asleep. He lifted the tonearm into place, delicately, despite the number of stones in his stomach. No priest shall enter this space without the angels’ blessing, and never without the fiery passion of Pavarotti. Ritualistic. A few scratches, and then Puccini’s masterpiece, Turandot, cried through the Italian virtuoso’s throat.

Act III. It always had to be. The same song had played in Gerald Stonesworth II’s library the morning his little boy found him cold and facedown on the floor. The same music had played in the gladness of Stonesworth III’s first kiss with his college girlfriend, his first love. The same haunting tune blasted in Gerald’s ears through his earbuds at the funeral of his fiancée, blocking out the priest’s suggestion that he honor the deceased with his final words. The same record played when his mentor, right after praising him over dinner as the next Van Gogh, demanded oral pleasure in exchange for introductions to his generous banker friends. Four knuckles to the eyes packed up the red carpet and sent the slimy old man out the door, carrying with him Gerald’s dream of a better future. Puccini and Pavarotti had been with him at every major milestone, every gut-wrenching scream, and every triumph.

.

Gerald stared at his dying hope: a series of five canvases barely sketched out in pencil, wondering how Neo-Brutalism had died in the womb of ambition and greed. One day, he told himself, they’d hang in a clean white room with a neat little plaque explaining how close they’d come to never existing. The canvases stayed silent. The familiar itch for oblivion crawled up his spine. He did have, what, twenty more days to figure things out. 

A moment later, Gerald was stroking himself to a low-resolution video, a clip shamelessly stolen from one of those mass-produced pornos from the nineties and posted for free on his favorite site. 

.

After scrolling through the badly acted prelude, the starlet of the “movie” appeared before the depraved artist at last: a young, pale, frail redhead with curls blessed by the heavens. Even while debased, Gerald had to laugh at the filthy arrogance of men. The male co-star was a nasty brute compared to his beautiful partner.

<Oh, Mister Balducci\~ I have to make rent this month, or else! Would you not hire me?>

The young woman pleaded in a tone so plastic that Gerald had to skip forward a few more seconds. No time to waste. 

There they were—the hypnotic swaying of her ample hips and generous bosom. 

Then it hit Gerald. His inspiration.

To hell with Neo-Brutalism. He needed immediacy. He needed passion. He needed…

Gerald’s pupils dilated. He opened his phone, accessed his bank account, and checked the bottom line. Merciful heavens. The remaining funds were just enough for what he had in mind. Fifteen decent dinners, or gambling for a chance to change his life-- or at least to save it. There was no need to debate. Gerald’s eyes darted, the hamster wheel spinning at full speed between his ears. Right. Gambling it is.

The next development in Gerald’s race against time came in the form of a modest wanted ad that read: 

""URGENT! MODEL AND ASSISTANT WANTED. FREE FOOD AND BOARD. CALL XXX-XXX-XXXX.""

1prto1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1prto1o/update_i_20m_ended_my_relationship_of_four_years/,Update: I (20m) ended my relationship of four years with girlfriend 21(F) and she had an absolutely insane meltdown.,"So I previously made a post about how I was a little worried about breaking up with her due to her reaction of hurting me, herself, or just doing something insane. Let me tell you that was very warranted. So, I listened to advice of friends and family and broke up with her at a local coffee shop parking lot (in person) The plan was to hand her, her stuff - tell her we're done and leave. The whole day I was excited, sad, and so nervous. When I got to the coffee shop and sent the text ""come meet me at \_\_\_, we  need to talk"" the nervousness was so high. I don't think ive ever been that nervous. When she got there, I got out of my car and said ""this relationship is over, im sorry but this is my choice and it's for the best of us"" and walked away. that may sound cutthroat but she is manipulative and CANNOT take no for an answer. As im walking away back to my car she sprints in front of me blocking me so that I couldn't get into my car screaming ""thats not fair thats not fair"" but I was quick enough to get into my car driveway. Driving off on her felt like horrible. It was so mean but this had to be done and I don't know any other way to do it. I immediately blocked her on everything. After that,  I drove around on the highway for about an hour just thinking about the decision and honestly I was relieved. I called my friend and was giddy as hell lol. The relationship wasn't bad enough to warrant that but god I should've never forced myself to stay with her. The story doesn't end here though. 

  
I drove around for awhile on the highway because I knew she would show up my house (im living with my family of 8 btw) and of course she was WAITING for me at my house. When I saw her there and drove off of course she noticed me and started FOLLOWING ME. Not just following, TAILING, like 2cms behind me. I thought quickly of where to go and put the nearby police station in my Apple Maps and made my way there with her tailing me. Right before I got to the station she finally stopped following me. Like 10 fucking minutes of non stop tailing after I broke up with her. This is what I mean when I said she can't take no for answer. I called my mom while all of this was happening and she told me to take a video so I did my best to get evidence but I took a dog shit video that shows nothing. A James Bond ass end to the relationship. Oh yeah she also spam called my mom and sent her paragraphs. Also got her mom to call me and text me, she texted me ""You need to come here and explain yourself"" BOY FUCK YOU!!!!!! YOU ARENT IN THE RELATIONSHIP. Sorry but yeah I broke up with her (21 year old grown woman) and she got mommy and daddy to try to change my decision after following me like a nut job. That was the worst but best day in my life and Im finally free of the shackles of a dead relationships.",1,1766278761.0,WhatShouldIDo,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1: The Hollow Ache

I never thought my greatest sin would be wanting a child too much.
My name is Emily Harper. Thirty-two years old. Five-foot-two, soft around the edges—the kind of body people call “curvy” when they’re being kind, and forget about when they’re not. Brown hair that falls straight to my shoulders, the kind that never quite holds a curl. Green eyes that Ryan used to say looked like spring leaves—before he stopped looking altogether. I work for Child Protective Services in Topeka, Kansas. Fifteen years now. No husband. No children. Just three cats and a small house on the edge of town that smells of vanilla candles, fresh-baked cookies, and the ghost of hope I can’t quite exorcise.
Infertility isn’t a word that describes what happened to me. It’s a verdict. Blocked tubes. “Unexplained.” The doctors said it gently, the way they deliver any death sentence—no eye contact, voices soft. We spent everything on treatments. Eighty thousand dollars that could have bought a bigger house, college funds, or—irony of ironies—the adoption of several children who actually needed homes.
Ryan wanted kids the way other people want air. I wanted them more. When the last round of IVF failed, he looked at me like I was a promise the universe had broken. He left six months later. The papers cited “irreconcilable differences.” I signed them with a pen that leaked blue ink across the page like tears I refused to cry in front of him.
That night I started drinking. Cheap red wine straight from the box. I drank until the cats stopped coming when I called. Until Ryan’s laugh was just a sound I couldn’t summon anymore. Until the only thing that felt real was the burn in my throat and the hollow ache low in my belly that never went away.
God and I had a falling-out around then. I used to pray on my knees beside the bed, fingers laced, begging for a miracle. After Ryan left, I stood in the shower screaming at the ceiling until the water ran cold. No answer came. So I stopped asking.
I threw myself into work. Child Protective Services became my new religion. There are roughly 400,000 children in foster care in this country. More than 117,000 are legally free for adoption—waiting for someone to choose them. Every year about 20,000 age out at eighteen with no family, no safety net. Half will be homeless within a year. Most will never finish college. A third will be incarcerated before twenty-five.
Those numbers are printed on glossy brochures in every CPS office. I have them memorized the way other people memorize prayers.
I could have adopted any one of them. Income stable, background check clean, home study already done from the IVF days. I could have been a mother tomorrow if I’d filled out the paperwork.
But I didn’t.
I wanted my own. Blood. A child that looked like me, like Ryan. A child with my green eyes and his smile.
That was the dream I clung to while I watched other people’s children get shuffled from home to home like unwanted furniture.
That was the sin I couldn’t forgive myself for.
Mornings started the same. I woke at 5:45 to Garfield yowling at the bedroom door—one-eyed orange tabby, full of personality, always knocking things off counters just to watch them fall. I filled his ceramic goldfish bowl with expensive grain-free kibble while he batted it around the kitchen floor.
Cocoa came next. My warm brown girl with white paws, the calm one. Ryan gave her to me after the third IVF round came back negative. We picked out the silver princess dish together, excited like new parents. She still ate from it delicately, purring the whole time. I scratched behind her ears and felt the old ache bloom.
Sardine was last, as always. Gray tabby, skittish. Found him on the porch one rainy night, meowing at an open can of sardines. He watched from under the couch while I filled his plain blue bowl, only emerging when I left the room.
The fridge was covered in their pictures. Garfield mid-yawn, one eye winking. Cocoa in a sunbeam. Sardine peeking from behind a curtain. No photos of Ryan anymore. I took those down the week he left.
I baked on Wednesdays for Thursday delivery. Chocolate chip with sea salt, snickerdoodles, lemon crinkle cookies with careful icing flowers. I piped the designs the way I used to imagine decorating a nursery. Every Thursday I brought them to the office in a pretty tin tied with ribbon.
The new hires always gushed.
“You’re so motherly, Emily! How many kids do you have? They must love having you as a mom.”
I smiled the smile I’d perfected—warm, kind.
“No kids yet. Just practicing.”
They laughed. They didn’t see my hand tighten on the tin.
My boss was Daniel Cho. Fifty-one. Former Marine. Buzz-cut silvering at the temples. Voice like gravel. He kept Maker’s Mark in the bottom drawer and a face-down photo of a little girl with pigtails on his desk. He’d lost his wife and daughter to a drunk driver years ago. After that, he turned down adopting another child—said he couldn’t survive losing one again. The guilt ate him the way mine ate me. We understood each other. Late nights doing paperwork, black coffee and whiskey, no need for words.
There are 117,000 children waiting.
Most will never be chosen.
Some hungers should never be fed.
I just didn’t know mine was one of them.

Chapter 2: The File
The office smelled like burnt coffee and old paper, the way it always did in late spring when the AC struggled against the Kansas heat. Holiday decorations were long gone, replaced by faded posters about foster-parent recruitment and a sad little fan oscillating in the corner. I sat at my desk, sipping coffee that tasted like ash, staring at a file on a seven-year-old girl who’d been returned to her mother for the third time. Bruises shaped like fingerprints on her arms. I’d fought to keep her in care. The judge sent her back anyway.
Daniel Cho dropped a new folder on my desk without ceremony. It landed with a soft thud, raising a small puff of dust.
“St. Agnes Homestead,” he said, voice gravel-rough. “Shawnee County. Fifty acres, off-grid. Calls itself a traditional Catholic agrarian community.”
I opened it. The anonymous tips weren’t emails or calls. They were postcards—cheap gas-station ones, handwritten in shaky crayon scrawl, big letters, some backwards, colors bleeding through the paper. Postmarked from three small towns within fifty miles. No return addresses. Different children’s handwriting, like they’d taken turns sneaking them out.
I read them again, the words crawling under my skin.
First, red crayon, paper torn at one corner:
the sisters find dead foxes on the road
they peel the faces off with knives when nobody’s looking
they sew them with black string and wear them at night
the masks smell like old meat and blood
they make us wear them too when we go to the woods
it’s dark and cold and they make us chant
please come get us
the fox is hungry
Second, blue crayon, crude stick-figure drawing on the back—robed figures with fox-snout masks around a fire, small children with tears, one figure on the ground with X eyes:
we have to chant to the fox god under the church
he lives in the tunnels
he wants a baby to come out of john
john is big and he cries when they put the mask on him
they say the fire will come soon and burn everything bad
but i think we are the bad thing
help
my friend sarah is gone
they said she went to a better home but i heard screaming
Third, black crayon pressed so hard it tore the paper:
they took my tongue because i told
they said i didn’t see the truth
now i can’t talk
the masks have real eyes sometimes
the fox god is coming
he wants fruit
he wants blood
run if you come here
run
Cho tapped the folder twice.
“Undercover grant inspection. Tell them the state loves their self-sufficiency and we’re cutting a big check. Get inside. Photos. Proof. Get out.”
He paused, looking at me for the first time that morning. His eyes were bloodshot, the lines around them deeper than I remembered.
“And Emily… be careful. These people don’t leave loose ends.”
I met his gaze. We both knew what he meant. After Ryan left, Cho had been the one sitting with me at 2 a.m., paperwork spread across the desk, passing the Maker’s Mark back and forth in silence. He’d lost his daughter. I’d lost the chance at one. He understood the kind of hunger that could blind you.
“I know what it’s like to want something the world won’t give you,” he said quietly. “Just don’t let it make you stupid out there.”
I nodded, closing the folder.
Current leadership: eleven adult women, “Sisters of the Eternal Flame,” ages sixty-eight to eighty-seven.
One adult male: John St. John, thirty-three, severe autism, abandoned behind a Topeka Walmart in 1995.
Fifteen minors, ages four to seventeen.
Last state contact: years ago.
Current oversight: none.
I slipped the postcards into my bag. The crayon smelled faintly of wax and desperation.
Outside, the sun was fierce, heat shimmering off the parking-lot asphalt. My scarlet red 2023 Nissan Rogue waited in its spot—the one Ryan and I bought after the second IVF round took. Thirteen weeks. I’d felt the flutters. Then the bleeding. The ultrasound dark again. We drove home in silence, his hand never reaching for my belly.
I ran my fingers over the warm hood, the quilted leather seats still holding the faint scent of new car and his cologne.
Three days, I told myself. In and out. Get the proof. Save the kids.
I had no idea I was the one who needed saving.

Chapter 3: The Walmart
Before I drove out to the homestead, I did what any good investigator would do: I talked to the locals.
The Topeka Walmart sat five miles from the homestead’s gate, a big blue box under harsh sodium lights, the parking lot cracked and littered with stray shopping carts that rattled in the warm breeze. The air inside smelled like stale popcorn, floor wax, and the faint tang of rotisserie chickens turning under heat lamps.
I went on a Wednesday night, just after the evening rush thinned out. I found three employees willing to talk—off the clock, in the smoking area outside by the dumpsters. They sat on overturned crates, blue vests slung over arms, name tags still clipped.
First was Harold Jenkins, sixty-eight, night stocker for fifteen years. Liver spots on his hands, a cough like gravel in a blender, eyes watery from too many cigarettes. He lit one right there.
“You’re asking about the Fox Farm,” he said, exhaling smoke through his nose. “Ain’t nobody talks about it much anymore. But back when this Walmart opened—’95, same year they found the kid—things were different. Town smaller. Woods thicker. Night drivers swore they saw lights in the trees. Little fires. Figures in black moving between them.”
He took another drag, eyes distant.
“The kid—John St. John—they found him out back by the compactor. Night janitor heard crying under the cardboard. Pulled out a plastic bag with a newborn inside, still wet, cord tied off with a shoelace. Cops came, but no mother ever showed. Word was the sisters and a man—called himself Father Abraham back then—took him the next day. ‘Charity case.’ Police brought him back a few times over the years when he wandered. Always said he escaped. Big fence went up after the third time.”
He stubbed the cigarette out on the concrete.
“I saw him once myself. Closing shift, 3 a.m. Went out back for a smoke. Saw eyes in the tree line—yellow, reflecting the light. Then this… thing stepped out. Tall. Broad. Heavy. Skin jaundiced, like he’d been sick forever. Wearing a little kid’s Sonic shirt stretched all wrong. Face shadowed. It just stared. Then it yipped—high, like a fox—and ran back into the woods. Left barefoot prints. Toes too long.”
Next was Mike Torres, twenty-one, cashier, lanky with acne scars and a nervous laugh. He kept glancing at the door.
“I’ve only been here two years,” he said, voice low. “But night crew talks. Dumpsters get raided—too neat for animals. They take the rotisserie chickens we toss at close. Bones left clean, picked white. Clothes from the donation bin too. Kids’ stuff mostly. One time I found a Paw Patrol shirt in the mud out back—stretched like someone three times too big had worn it. Smelled like piss and dirt.”
He swallowed hard.
“Last month, me and Sarah were closing. Heard scratching at the loading dock. Went to look. Saw it. Big guy, hunched, moving like an animal. Wearing a little kid’s shirt. Skin yellowish, eyes reflecting yellow. Eating a chicken raw, tearing into it with his teeth. When it saw us, it yipped and ran. Fast. Like it wasn’t human.”
Sarah Ramirez, nineteen, deli worker, small and quiet with dark circles under her eyes, nodded.
“I’ve seen the masks,” she whispered. “Found one in a returned rotisserie bag once. Real fox face—peeled off roadkill, I think. Sewn with black thread. Eye holes cut out. Smelled like death. Threw it away quick. Didn’t tell anyone.”
Harold leaned forward, voice dropping.
“That’s how they get them. Roadkill. Peel the faces. Sew them. Wear them for rituals in the woods. The kids too, some say. And John… he’s the center of it. The vessel. They think he’s gonna bring their fox god or something. All because he was thrown away like trash behind this store.”
I left the Walmart with my stomach in knots, the warm night air suddenly thick and oppressive.
The homestead was waiting.

Chapter 4: The Gate
The drive out to St. Agnes Homestead took me deeper into Shawnee County than I’d ever been. The pavement gave way to gravel, then to packed dirt that kicked up red dust behind my Rogue. Cornfields stretched on both sides, young green shoots shimmering under the late-afternoon sun. The air through the cracked window smelled of warm earth and distant rain.
I turned onto a narrow lane marked only by a weathered wooden sign: St. Agnes Homestead – Private Property. A high chain-link fence topped with razor wire appeared suddenly, cutting across the fields like a scar. At the gate stood a small figure in black.
Sister Agnes.
Tiny, ancient, her habit crisp despite the heat. Face like cracked porcelain, pale eyes sharp behind wire-rimmed glasses. She smiled as I rolled to a stop—warm, grandmotherly, the kind of smile that made you want to confess things.
“Blessed be in the way of the Flame, Ms. Harper,” she said, voice soft as bread dough. “The children are well. Come. Tea is ready.”
She opened the gate by hand—old iron groaning—and waved me through.
The homestead unfolded like a picture from another century. Modest white houses with green trim lined a central dirt road. A large red barn dominated the center, its paint sun-faded but proud. Fields of corn and wheat stretched golden-green. Animal pens held donkeys braying lazily, horses grazing, a mixed herd of cows. The air smelled of fresh-cut hay, manure, and something sweeter—rosemary from the herb garden near the houses.
Children worked in silence. Younger ones in the kitchen plots, kneeling to weed neat rows of lettuce and herbs. Older teens in the distant fields, bent over hoes, shirts dark with sweat. No laughter. No talking unless spoken to. Just the rhythmic thud of tools and the low hum of bees.
The sisters wore traditional black habits, each with a small silver pin on the chest: a leaping fox wreathed in stylized flames.
Sister Agnes led me to the main house, her steps light despite her age. Inside, the air was cooler, scented with woodsmoke and baking bread. Handmade furniture, polished to a shine. One old television in the common room—approved programs only.
Father Abraham greeted me in the parlor. Tall, lean, pale skin almost translucent in the window light. Steel-gray hair combed back. Clean-shaven. Pale blue eyes that didn’t blink enough. A thin white scar ran down his left cheek, stark against his skin. His voice was low, smooth, the kind you’d trust with your darkest secrets.
“Welcome, Ms. Harper. The Lord provides.”
He took my hand—his was cool, dry, lingering just a second too long.
“We’re honored by the state’s interest,” he said. “Self-sufficiency is our prayer. Come, let us show you the fruits of our labor.”
The tour felt like proud parents showing off a prize child.
The gardens: perfect rows, children in plain linen working without complaint. A nine-year-old girl with tangled brown hair and frightened eyes followed me everywhere, clinging to my skirt with small, dirt-smudged hands. Hannah, Sister Agnes called her. Deaf. She signed something quick and shy—thank you—when I knelt to help her pull a weed.
The barn: milk cows lowing softly, chickens scratching in fresh straw, the sweet-musky smell of hay and animals thick in the air.
The kitchens: wood-fired stoves, herbs drying from rafters, loaves of bread cooling on racks. The scent made my stomach twist with memory.
The chapel: rough-hewn pews, a single crucifix wrapped in dried fox tails. Candles that smelled faintly of animal fat. A bronze statue on the altar—a nursing vixen, teats dripping what looked like molten fire, two fox-headed young suckling beneath her.
And then the locked door off the main house.
Sister Agnes’s voice dropped to something like reverence.
“Our blessed vessel. John St. John.”
The room was an oversized nursery—peeling wallpaper with faded circus animals, a crib the size of a twin bed, mobiles of wooden foxes spinning slowly in the draft.
And John.
Thirty-three. Six-foot-five. Broad and heavy—nearly three hundred pounds of thick, soft bulk. Jaundiced skin with a faint yellow tint, like parchment left too close to a flame. Eyes that caught the dim light and reflected yellow—unsettling, animal. Blackened, rotting teeth. Hand-sewn clothes in childish patterns stretched wrong over his frame. He rocked gently, humming, flapping his hands in rhythmic excitement.
When he saw me, his face lit up like a child on Christmas morning.
“Pretty!” he boomed, voice high and eager. “Play! Mommy came back!”
He lunged forward, flapping harder, rocking so hard the floor creaked.
Sister Agnes smiled fondly, patting his massive arm.
“Some children are born to be loved,” she said. “Some are born to be used. John was born for both.”
Father Abraham watched me with those unblinking eyes.
“The Flame chooses its vessels carefully, Ms. Harper. As it chooses its mothers.”
The words landed wrong, but the room was warm, the tea waiting, and I told myself I was imagining things.
Outside, the sun dipped lower, painting the fields gold.
I had three days.
Plenty of time.

Chapter 5: The Tour
The second day began with the toll of a bell at dawn. The air was already warm, thick with the scent of turned earth and green growth. I woke in a narrow guest room—plain white walls, a crucifix wrapped in dried fox tails above the bed, the faint smell of lye soap and old wood. My Rogue sat outside where I’d parked it, scarlet paint gleaming under the morning sun.
Sister Agnes met me at breakfast: fresh bread, butter, eggs from their hens, grape juice too sweet. The children ate in silence at long tables, heads bowed. Hannah sat near the end, small hands signing good morning when she saw me. I signed back, earning a shy smile before a Sister’s sharp glance made her drop her eyes.
Father Abraham joined us briefly, scar pale in the sunlight streaming through the window.
“The tow truck is arranged for Sunday,” he said smoothly. “These rural mechanics—slow, but reliable. You’ll ride with me to meet it after service. Until then, please, continue your inspection. We have nothing to hide.”
Three days. Plenty of time.
The tour continued.
We walked the fields first. Older teens—fourteen, fifteen, sixteen—worked in the distance, bent double planting corn rows that stretched to the horizon. Their linen clothes clung with sweat, faces sunburned, hands blistered. No complaints. No chatter. Just the steady scrape of hoes and the low buzz of insects.
“Younger ones help closer to home,” Sister Agnes explained, gesturing to children weeding the herb garden. “Older ones tend the heavy labor. Builds character. Prepares them for service.”
Hannah trailed me again, clutching her threadbare stuffed horse—Whisper, she signed when I asked. One button eye missing, fabric worn soft from years of love.
In the herb garden, while Sister Agnes spoke to another woman, Hannah tugged my sleeve. Her fingers flew quick and secret.
Older kids work hard. Fields all day. Sun hot. Hands bleed.
I signed back: You don’t?
Young clean inside. Safe inside. A pause. Her face darkened.
Michaela was big sister. Fifteen. Took care of me. Brushed hair. Extra bread.
Her signs slowed, eyes filling.
One night Sister Agnes say: “Michaela go new family. Special bath—clean for parents.” Michaela happy. Cry happy. Wear locket always—mama papa picture. Never take off.
She pressed a hand to her chest where a locket would hang.
Morning—gone. Bed empty. Locket on pillow. No goodbye.
Hannah glanced toward the chapel, its steeple sharp against the blue sky.
That night—scream from chapel. Michaela scream. Long. Then stop.
She clutched Whisper tighter, rocking slightly.
No new family.
I knelt, signing slow: I believe you. I’ll help.
Her eyes searched mine—big, brown, ancient with fear. She signed one word she’d learned to mouth perfectly:
Liar.
The word hit like a slap.
Lunch was simple—bread, cheese, more grape juice. Father Abraham excused himself to “prepare Sunday’s sermon.”
I was shown John’s room again, this time alone with him while Sister Ruth watched from the door.
The nursery smelled of sour milk, urine, and something feral beneath. Mobiles of wooden foxes spun lazily. Faded Sonic stickers peeled from the crib bars. A broken toy truck sat in one corner—he rocked it sometimes, humming.
John lit up when he saw me.
“Mommy pretty!” he boomed, voice high and delighted. He lumbered over, massive hands flapping. “Play! Read story!”
He grabbed a worn coloring book from a shelf—crayon scribbles of foxes and big stick figures holding tiny ones. He thrust it at me, rocking excitedly.
“Read! Please!”
I sat on the floor—creaking under even my weight—and opened it. He crowded close, heavy and warm, breath sour against my cheek.
“Good mommy,” he cooed, pointing at a page. “Make baby soon.”
His sticky fingers reached for my brown hair.
“Soft. Hair pretty.”
Before I could pull away, he yanked—a sharp sting as several strands tore free. He held them to his nose, inhaling deeply, then tucked them into his pocket with a beaming smile.
“Keep forever.”
Sister Ruth watched impassively.
That evening, after chores, my car wouldn’t start.
I turned the key in the fading light. The engine cranked but never caught. Father Abraham appeared with a lantern, popping the hood.
“Ah,” he said mildly. “Gas line’s been cut clean. Animals, perhaps. Or wear from the gravel roads.”
He closed the hood gently.
“The tow is still set for Sunday. You’re safe here until then.”
Sister Agnes pressed a cup of herbal tea into my hands—sweet, with a faint bitterness underneath.
“Drink, dear. You look pale. The Flame provides.”
I drank.
The dormitory bell rang. I was led to a small room with two narrow cots.
Sister Elizabeth waited inside—frail, hunched, one milky eye, raspy breaths through sewn-shut lips. She signed a greeting, then pointed to the loose floorboard beneath her cot.
The hymnal was already there.
I had two more nights.
Plenty of time.

Chapter 6: The First Night
The dormitory was quiet after the evening bell, the air heavy with the scent of lye soap and the faint sweetness of grape juice lingering on my breath. Two narrow cots, a washbasin, a crucifix with fox tails stirring in the draft from the high window. Sister Elizabeth sat on her cot, frail and hunched, her one good eye catching the moonlight. She signed slowly—You kept the pages?—then pointed to the loose floorboard.
I shook my head, lying with a nod. She searched my face for a long moment, then looked away, resigned.
I’d read her words twice already, hidden in the dark. The hymnal pages were tucked in my briefcase now, safe—or so I told myself. Proof. When I got to town tomorrow, the police would come. The children would be saved. Hannah would be safe.
One more night.
I lay awake, the cot’s thin mattress doing little against the hard wood beneath. The pups weren’t there yet—not really—but I swore I could feel the possibility, a ghost flutter low in my belly. Stupid. Hopeful. The same treacherous hope that had kept me from adopting all those years.
The floorboard creaked softly. Elizabeth again. She slid the hymnal toward me, pencil stub trembling in her gnarled fingers.
One last entry.
Elizabeth:
You lie badly, child.
He will find them.
But you need to know all.
The scar—holy silver, long ago. Cannot heal. He changes bodies like habits, but the scar follows.
He needs one unscarred. Born new.
John upon the barren woman. Twins. One devours the other. The survivor empty—perfect vessel for Azazel.
The Eternal Flame is His hunger.
The strong children—ripened by labor—are tithed in flesh to patrons who pay to stay young. Livers, kidneys, hearts. Delivered quiet.
Michaela was next. The screams you will hear in memory were hers.
You are the barren woman, Emily. Your womb the soil.
Run tonight. Take Hannah. The deaf see clearest.
I am tired. Burn this. All of it. Promise.
My hands shook as I wrote back, tears blotching the ink.
Emily:
I can’t leave without proof. Without the children.
Hannah clings to me like I’m already hers. She smells like lavender soap and fear. I could have been someone’s mother. One form. One choice. But I wanted my own.
Your pages are hidden safe. When I get out tomorrow, the world will know. They’ll come for him. For all of them.
Thank you, Elizabeth. You are the bravest person I’ve ever met.
I slid the hymnal back, signing All burned when she looked at me questioningly.
She dabbed a tear with her father’s faded silk handkerchief—the one relic from before the fire—then turned away.
Sleep never came.
The morning dawned bright and hot. The children were already in the fields or kitchens, the rhythm of the homestead unbroken. I dressed for service, heart pounding with anticipation. One sermon. One ride to town. Proof in my briefcase. End of story.
The chapel filled slowly. Rough pews, the fox-tail crucifix, candles flickering with that faint animal-fat smell. Father Abraham stood at the front, scar stark in the stained-glass light filtering through narrow windows.
His sermon was soft, almost kind.
“The Lord fills the barren womb,” he said, eyes finding mine across the room. “The vessel is prepared. The Flame quickens.”
Communion followed. We filed forward. The grape juice in tiny cups—too sweet, as always.
Mine tasted different. Faintly bitter beneath the sugar. Metallic.
I drank.
The world tilted. Voices muffled. My knees buckled.
The last thing I saw was Father Abraham’s smile, scar glowing like it remembered fire.
When I woke, I was naked on cold marble beneath the bronze vixen—teats dripping molten fire in the candlelight, two fox-headed young suckling eternally.
Chains bit into my wrists and ankles.
The children stood in a silent circle, eyes down. Hannah among them, clutching Whisper, tears streaking her dirt-smudged cheeks.
Father Abraham stood over me, scar pale.
“Emily Harper,” he said gently. “Barren vessel. The Flame has chosen you.”
He sliced his palm with a silver dagger—the blade that had made his scar. Smoke curled faintly from the old wound as fresh blood welled.
He painted a sigil on my belly—hot, sticky, smelling of iron and incense. A flaming fox.
The sisters chanted low, Latin-tinged words I didn’t know.
They brought John.
He wore the mask—real fox faces sewn with black thread, snout long, eye holes hollow, reeking of rot and old blood. His yellow eyes gleamed through it, excited.
They had groomed him. Coaxed him. Promised “special play.”
“Mate!” he giggled, voice high and delighted, flapping his massive hands. “Make baby now!”
He didn’t understand. Not really. Just joy. Just obedience.
They held me down.
His weight. His heat. His childlike laughter echoing off the stone.
The oil was hot rosemary and something metallic, burning where it touched.
I screamed until my throat was raw.
Deep inside, something sparked.
Took root.
Finally.
Mine.

Chapter 7: Captivity Begins
The world came back in pieces.
Cold stone against my bare back. Chains rattling at my wrists and ankles. The metallic tang of blood in my mouth—my own, from biting my tongue to stay conscious. The air was damp, thick with earth and old herbs, the faint reek of animal fat from candles long burned out.
I was in the tunnels.
Beneath the chapel.
The bronze vixen loomed above me on its altar, candlelight flickering across the molten fire dripping from her teats. My belly ached—raw, violated—but something else stirred there too. A warmth. A spark.
No.
I retched, but nothing came.
Footsteps echoed—soft, deliberate. Sister Ruth appeared, habit rustling, face calm as ever. She unchained one wrist to check my pulse, pressed cold fingers to my abdomen.
“The pups have taken,” she said flatly. “Strong already.”
Pups.
Not babies.
She chained me again, left a tray: porridge, water, vitamins. The door—thick wood reinforced with iron—closed with a final thud.
Hours passed. Or days. Time blurred in the dim bulb’s glow.
They moved me eventually. Up narrow stairs, into the sisters’ dormitory. The same small room with two cots. Sister Elizabeth waited, signing nothing, her one good eye fixed on the floor.
Sister Agnes smiled sweetly.
“She will not disturb your rest with talk.”
The door locked from outside.
That night, after the silence bell, Elizabeth sat on my cot. Moonlight through the high window painted her face in silver and shadow. She dabbed a tear with her father’s faded silk handkerchief—threadbare, monogrammed faintly with “I.P.”—then pried up the loose floorboard.
The hymnal.
She wrote first, pencil scratching loud in the quiet.
Elizabeth:
You are with child now.
I heard the chanting.
He has many names. Azazel is the oldest.
The scar is proof—he cannot heal holy silver.
He needs a body born new. Unscarred.
You carry it.
Run while you still can. Take Hannah.
My hand shook as I wrote back.
Emily:
I can’t. Not yet. The children—Hannah, the others. I have to get them out.
Your pages are hidden. Proof. When I escape, the police will come.
Please—tell me everything. How do I stop him?
She read, hesitated, then wrote faster—pages trembling.
Elizabeth:
You cannot stop Him.
1962. I was nine. Elizabeth Patterson. My father kept the church books. He saw the truth—children sold. Strong ones, ripened by labor. Organs to rich men who pay to stay young. Livers, kidneys, hearts. Delivered quiet. All “tithing to the Eternal Flame.”
We tried to run. They burned my parents at the pole. I watched. The smell—hair catching, flesh searing.
He cut my eye. Then my tongue. Said I saw too much. Spoke too much.
Ashes scattered in the garden. We eat from that soil.
He is older than this place. The prophecy—he twisted it. John upon the barren woman. Twins. One devours the other. The survivor empty for Azazel.
You are the barren woman.
I see how John follows you. How they watch your belly.
Burn these pages. Promise.
I wrote:
Emily:
I promise.
I’m sorry—for your parents. For you.
Michaela—Hannah told me. The screams. The locket left behind.
They’re monsters.
Elizabeth’s tear fell on the page. She dabbed it with the handkerchief, then wrote one last line.
Elizabeth:
We all are, child.
Some of us just took longer to see.
She fed the pages into the lantern flame one by one, watching them curl and blacken.
I palmed them instead, folding them small, slipping them into my briefcase under the cot.
“All gone,” I whispered.
She watched the empty flame, one good eye wet.
I lied.
That lie would kill her.
But I had proof now.
Tomorrow, Father Abraham would drive me to town.
Tomorrow, this ended.

1prtlf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1prtlf9/the_waterweeping/,The Waterweeping,"The rain pittered onto the slanted metal roof, trickling its way below to the storefront where it pooled at the overflowing gutter, reflections of the store lights shining a hazy mirror of the railway bridge above as the latenight train heaved over the tracks. The bell rattled above the door accompanied by the squelch of nimble boots against linoleum. The man slapped both palms of his wet gloves against the counter.
“Jerry I need to tell you-”
“What the hell are you doing?”
“Jerry-”
“Get off me mate, you’re soaking”
“I know-”
“Stop touching my face.”
“I know-”

The man behind the counter flailed as he slapped away the damp fabric.
“WHAT?”
“Wait.”

The drenched customer shuffled his sodden form over to the refrigerator cabinet, his hooded neck craned over his shoulder and staring with precision outside into the road. He fumbled between a can and a bottle as the cashier held his head in his hands. Murky water seeping from the worn coat fabric onto the tiled floor where it coalesced beneath him like coffee stains against paper. There was squeak of his heel and the ungracious thud of the can against the countertop as the customer leant forward, his soggy breath shaking and rapid.

“Don’t ring me up. Dont- Ring me up.”
“Mort- chill.”
“I need to be un-suspect.”

Jerry stared at the man with a gaze so questionable that it would’ve made a professor doubt themselves. For a moment, neither of them said a word. Just staring at each other over the drinks can as Mort’s breathing drowned out the refrigerator hum.

“I saw it.”
“Saw what?”
“It- IT! I saw-”
Mort flailed with outstretched palms as his mouth caught up with his mind. His voice croaked to a sharp whisper as his head leaned so close to Jerry’s that he could see every blackhead on his nose.
“I saw the Lacrimor”

There was silence.

“That’ll be one pound, five pence please.”
“You’re not LISTENING to me, Jerry”
“I’m not doing this with you.”
“I SAW it, I was on the trawler-”
Jerry slapped both hands on the countertop, smacked his lips and backed away from the desk, stepping towards the storefront, Mort trained on him, swivelling to follow him.
“It swam right underneath me- but it ain’t swim. Nah… It was walking. Below the-”

Jerry tightened his hand on the doorhandle and glared at the floor, nodding to the open exit.
“Off you go, mate.”
But Mort didn’t reply. From where he stood with his gaze angled at the floor, the dripping puddle coagulating at Mort’s feet was shimmering and swirling as the droplets seemed to not fall against it, but into it. No ripples or disturbance in the brown water. Jerry sighed at the mopping that he would now need to do, realising that Mort still hadn’t left the store.

“Mort.” He snapped “Its time to go mate-”

He switched his gaze out onto the street in front of them. It was raining still, no heavier and no much more gentle. The wind brushed the flow of thick droplets against the shop windows where they thrummed like drumsticks against the glass and the metal awning outside. The street was empty and the lights from the store radiated into the cold darkness in front as another train rumbled across the bridge. The lamppost at the other end of the road was the only other light outside, where the invisible raindrops were exposed in the light of. Mort was wide-eyed looking at it. So was Jerry. In the light of the streetlamp was a figure at its base. Not of a person or animal, but an outline of something. Something that was not there between the dryness. Its shape only existing through the reflection of the water, like it was within it. Neither of them could discern what it was, but felt somewhere within their instinct that it was looking at them.

Mort looked down to the puddle at his foot, as it began to sink into the pool.

He wretched his shoe from the viscous fluid, pulling with such fright that it yanked his heel from the boot, stumbling backwards, he grabbed a hold of Mort’s damp coat to steady himself. Which, In turn, liberated the man from his hysteria and they both stared at the shoe as it sank gradually beneath the swirling ripples of the puddle, vanishing into the opaque murk.

Jerry scoured to grasp any words, in his shock he refined his terrified gaze to the outside again. The figure still stood beneath the streetlamp, however, its abstract form hidden in the raindrops had begun to sway between the intervals of torrenting water. Had begun to move in rhythm with the pittering rainfall. 

The store clerk yanked his vice grip on the fishmonger’s coat and pulled them both well inside the store and in one swift movement, Jerry slammed the door shut with his full bodyweight, fumbling with the latch when finally, the metallic shunt indicated that it was locked.

“That’s it.” Mort shook, trembling finger outreached to the door.
Jerry didn’t retort, his eyes darted between the outside and inside. Finally, his shrinking pupils honed in on Mort’s drenched coat. His breath running thin as he stared in horror at the Fishmonger’s back, as a dark shadow swam over the glistening wetness.

“Get that FUCKING coat off.”

Mort scrambled like a fish on dry land, his body overtaken in spasm as the man desperately yanked at his clothes, pulling them off layer by layer until he was stripped down the vest and shorts. Jerry kicked the soaking slump to the door, which he opened for an ephemeral moment before chucking the heap outside.

Both men panted like weak dogs. Gasping in shock, neither dared move an inch. Both fixated their adrenal stares to the shop windows, focused on the streetlight now. But nothing stood beneath. 

Mort stepped towards the glass, his bare feet sliding against the tiled ground as he beckoned closer and closer. Trying to find where the shape had gone, closing the distance between his face and the glass, until his trembling breath fogged the window. 

It was not until his eyes refocused from the outside- to in, that he suddenly realised that the reflection in front of him, dripping down the walls outside- was not his own. 

Mort let free a primal screech of ancestral fear as he fell backwards, stumbling to keep himself upright as Jerry swooped behind to catch him. His pale features drained of all life.

“Mort- what do we do?”
“Um-”
The Fishmonger swivelled his head around to analyse Jerry’s before returning to his limp posture.
“Do you have any spare clothes?”
There was a brief silence that hung in the air like dust.
“...Yeah, in the back.”
“You have a phone back there?”
“Good idea.”

Mort uprighted himself and exhaled, patting Jerry on the shoulder as the two mutually began to shuffle away from the front of the store towards the counter.

As they did, Jerry looked back at the window. There was nothing there. As they began to walk, his gaze trickled over to the refrigerators against the wall. Passing over the glass bottles inside, barely catching it at first; but unmistakably- he saw it. Time moved slowly as the shadow moved within the bottles. Like peering through a window, the figure moved from the front of the store towards the counter. 

“Mort-”
Jerry pulled the man by his shoulder.

The glass bottles began to vibrate as the shape moved through them, some fracturing along their necks and leaking from their busted caps. It glided through the store, appearing in front of them within the vodka bottles and whiskey. Mort watched on with a grave expression as it vanished completely.

Their eyes had followed the moving figure from one end of the shop to the other. And their silent stare now fell upon the drinks can on the countertop.

Jerry’s ear twitched as he heard Mort take a step backwards. Jerry did not. He was frozen in a fatal blend of curiosity and fear where all sound soon faded along with all other senses. The can began to shake. The aluminium casing twitching as the contents pressed and writhed to push its prison apart. The container spasmed upon the counter, building in intensity as the sound of clanking metal against the hard counter filled the room. Soon, the can was bouncing itself up and down, sliding and tipping as the metal deformed with the building pressure. Like a teapot screaming for release. 

Mort clenched his cold and clammy fingers on Jerry’s collar and pulled on the clerk quickly as he bolted for the backroom, slamming his skinny frame against the door as he urged Jerry with his movements to reach safety before that can exploded. The two men fell through the doorway. Jerry, snapping from his shock, fiddled with his breast pocket for the door key before pulling the door closed and turning the lock.

Jerry’s back slid down the door as the man slumped to the ground. He hadn’t blinked in so long that his pupils were almost cracking like brittle clumps of sand. His mouth was equally as dry as his shallow breath reverberated through his mouth like a death rattle.

The two locked eyes for a moment as the sound of the can erupting outside made them both startle. Like a shotgun firing from next door.

“Is- is there anything in here?”
“No. I forgot to bring a water bottle today.”

Mort nodded as his eyes darted around the office, staring at the empty boxes and cabinets until catching a glimpse of the phone on the desk. It almost fell out of his hands as they trembled with seismic intensity. His frail fingers passing over the dial pad.

From the store, the sound of a glass bottle shattering echoed throughout the building. Jerry shook. Then another. This time closer along the cabinets to the backroom. For every bottle that smashed, spilling its contents across the floor outside, Jerry could hear them get closer and closer. He began to whimper silently.

The phone began to purr and the dial tone began to fill Mort’s ears. His concentration shrinking and shrinking until the whole world was dead-set on the phone in his hands. All sounds outside of his bubble now muffled and silenced. The operator picked up. Mort’s panicked and shaky words ricocheted throughout the room. The operator’s words sinking with his own into a soup of mental fog.

It was only then that he could begin to discern the sounds outside of his immediate attention; a low and bleak, muffled sound. Almost like groaning. But it was growing. The sound of pain, unimaginable pain. Jerry’s screams shattered the barrier of concentration as Mort’s own words trailed off. The phone in his sweaty palms trembling just as much as feet. His head turned slowly towards the door.

“Sir? I need you tell me what’s happening.”
Mort’s breath lodged in his throat. In all his strength, he couldn’t stop the tears from welling.
“Sir?”

“...it’s coming out through his eyes.”

I'm 8 days in on my first sensor. After (way too many) finger sticks to see what this thing is doing, I now look at the number in the app and subtract 25. It's pretty consistently high by 20-30 and very rarely more. It's never gotten closer than that. I've reported it to the bot on their site and my second replacement is going to be delivered today. I haven't used the \*first\* replacement yet. So I \*bought\* 2 and have 4.

I keep looking at possibly upgrading to the G7 to see if that's more accurate. That would be about $180/month instead of the $100/month for Stelo.

I'm going to keep going with these because I want to see if placement makes a difference. Currently on back of arm per the instructions, but will my next one, a little higher up or off to the side a bit make a difference? I'm reading like crazy and it seems ALL of the CGMs have issues. The new Libre 3 plus would be a bit less expensive for me, but I see all kinds of complaints about innaccuracies with that one too. 

Bottom line, this is still helping me see patterns. I also found out that having coffee on an empty stomach in the morning was causing craziness so I recently switched to barley tea. I'm working with a nutritionist (as well as my primary) to lose weight and see if I can gain better control and it's really helping. I'm not severely overweight, but wanted to lose about 30 pounds. So far I've lost 20. I might go for 40.

I'd love for this to match my BGM readings more closely, but learning how it \*does\* work helps me figure out where I am.",1,1766278528.0,stelo,0,1.0,False

Seeking friends in Brooklyn/NYC,"I’m a 38-year-old guy who just got married this summer!  I am hoping to meet new people in the city for all kinds of fun plans—whether it’s a game night, couples night out, dinner parties, or just catching a movie together (we both have AMC A-List).

A little about me: I was born and raised in Spain, and now live in Brooklyn, with my wife. I work as a high school teacher in the Bronx, where I teach advanced Spanish classes, and I hold a Ph.D. in Hispanic Literature with a focus on comics and graphic novels.

I’ve been passionate about comics since I was a kid and still try to read a little (almost) every day. Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit overwhelmed between work and my master’s studies, so I’ve found it hard to focus on my usual hobbies. To unwind, I recently got a PS5—something fun to relax with after a long day.

Since I finished my PhD, I have had a hard time meeting people due to the amount of work and the distance from some friends. I have a bit of social anxiety, so I don't really get along with big groups of people, and that has impeded going to meetups and similar things, so I tend to meet in tiny groups. One important thing is that I am liberal, and I would prefer meeting like-minded people.

I’d love to meet others who share similar interests or enjoy good company. If you’re up for hanging out, exploring the city, or even talking comics over coffee, feel free to reach out!

Looking forward to connecting.

1prtjl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1prtjl8/the_waterweeping/,The Waterweeping,"The rain pittered onto the slanted metal roof, trickling its way below to the storefront where it pooled at the overflowing gutter, reflections of the store lights shining a hazy mirror of the railway bridge above as the latenight train heaved over the tracks. The bell rattled above the door accompanied by the squelch of nimble boots against linoleum. The man slapped both palms of his wet gloves against the counter.
“Jerry I need to tell you-”
“What the hell are you doing?”
“Jerry-”
“Get off me mate, you’re soaking”
“I know-”
“Stop touching my face.”
“I know-”

The man behind the counter flailed as he slapped away the damp fabric.
“WHAT?”
“Wait.”

The drenched customer shuffled his sodden form over to the refrigerator cabinet, his hooded neck craned over his shoulder and staring with precision outside into the road. He fumbled between a can and a bottle as the cashier held his head in his hands. Murky water seeping from the worn coat fabric onto the tiled floor where it coalesced beneath him like coffee stains against paper. There was squeak of his heel and the ungracious thud of the can against the countertop as the customer leant forward, his soggy breath shaking and rapid.

“Don’t ring me up. Dont- Ring me up.”
“Mort- chill.”
“I need to be un-suspect.”

Jerry stared at the man with a gaze so questionable that it would’ve made a professor doubt themselves. For a moment, neither of them said a word. Just staring at each other over the drinks can as Mort’s breathing drowned out the refrigerator hum.

“I saw it.”
“Saw what?”
“It- IT! I saw-”
Mort flailed with outstretched palms as his mouth caught up with his mind. His voice croaked to a sharp whisper as his head leaned so close to Jerry’s that he could see every blackhead on his nose.
“I saw the Lacrimor”

There was silence.

“That’ll be one pound, five pence please.”
“You’re not LISTENING to me, Jerry”
“I’m not doing this with you.”
“I SAW it, I was on the trawler-”
Jerry slapped both hands on the countertop, smacked his lips and backed away from the desk, stepping towards the storefront, Mort trained on him, swivelling to follow him.
“It swam right underneath me- but it ain’t swim. Nah… It was walking. Below the-”

Jerry tightened his hand on the doorhandle and glared at the floor, nodding to the open exit.
“Off you go, mate.”
But Mort didn’t reply. From where he stood with his gaze angled at the floor, the dripping puddle coagulating at Mort’s feet was shimmering and swirling as the droplets seemed to not fall against it, but into it. No ripples or disturbance in the brown water. Jerry sighed at the mopping that he would now need to do, realising that Mort still hadn’t left the store.

“Mort.” He snapped “Its time to go mate-”

He switched his gaze out onto the street in front of them. It was raining still, no heavier and no much more gentle. The wind brushed the flow of thick droplets against the shop windows where they thrummed like drumsticks against the glass and the metal awning outside. The street was empty and the lights from the store radiated into the cold darkness in front as another train rumbled across the bridge. The lamppost at the other end of the road was the only other light outside, where the invisible raindrops were exposed in the light of. Mort was wide-eyed looking at it. So was Jerry. In the light of the streetlamp was a figure at its base. Not of a person or animal, but an outline of something. Something that was not there between the dryness. Its shape only existing through the reflection of the water, like it was within it. Neither of them could discern what it was, but felt somewhere within their instinct that it was looking at them.

Mort looked down to the puddle at his foot, as it began to sink into the pool.

He wretched his shoe from the viscous fluid, pulling with such fright that it yanked his heel from the boot, stumbling backwards, he grabbed a hold of Mort’s damp coat to steady himself. Which, In turn, liberated the man from his hysteria and they both stared at the shoe as it sank gradually beneath the swirling ripples of the puddle, vanishing into the opaque murk.

Jerry scoured to grasp any words, in his shock he refined his terrified gaze to the outside again. The figure still stood beneath the streetlamp, however, its abstract form hidden in the raindrops had begun to sway between the intervals of torrenting water. Had begun to move in rhythm with the pittering rainfall. 

The store clerk yanked his vice grip on the fishmonger’s coat and pulled them both well inside the store and in one swift movement, Jerry slammed the door shut with his full bodyweight, fumbling with the latch when finally, the metallic shunt indicated that it was locked.

“That’s it.” Mort shook, trembling finger outreached to the door.
Jerry didn’t retort, his eyes darted between the outside and inside. Finally, his shrinking pupils honed in on Mort’s drenched coat. His breath running thin as he stared in horror at the Fishmonger’s back, as a dark shadow swam over the glistening wetness.

“Get that FUCKING coat off.”

Mort scrambled like a fish on dry land, his body overtaken in spasm as the man desperately yanked at his clothes, pulling them off layer by layer until he was stripped down the vest and shorts. Jerry kicked the soaking slump to the door, which he opened for an ephemeral moment before chucking the heap outside.

Both men panted like weak dogs. Gasping in shock, neither dared move an inch. Both fixated their adrenal stares to the shop windows, focused on the streetlight now. But nothing stood beneath. 

Mort stepped towards the glass, his bare feet sliding against the tiled ground as he beckoned closer and closer. Trying to find where the shape had gone, closing the distance between his face and the glass, until his trembling breath fogged the window. 

It was not until his eyes refocused from the outside- to in, that he suddenly realised that the reflection in front of him, dripping down the walls outside- was not his own. 

Mort let free a primal screech of ancestral fear as he fell backwards, stumbling to keep himself upright as Jerry swooped behind to catch him. His pale features drained of all life.

“Mort- what do we do?”
“Um-”
The Fishmonger swivelled his head around to analyse Jerry’s before returning to his limp posture.
“Do you have any spare clothes?”
There was a brief silence that hung in the air like dust.
“...Yeah, in the back.”
“You have a phone back there?”
“Good idea.”

Mort uprighted himself and exhaled, patting Jerry on the shoulder as the two mutually began to shuffle away from the front of the store towards the counter.

As they did, Jerry looked back at the window. There was nothing there. As they began to walk, his gaze trickled over to the refrigerators against the wall. Passing over the glass bottles inside, barely catching it at first; but unmistakably- he saw it. Time moved slowly as the shadow moved within the bottles. Like peering through a window, the figure moved from the front of the store towards the counter. 

“Mort-”
Jerry pulled the man by his shoulder.

The glass bottles began to vibrate as the shape moved through them, some fracturing along their necks and leaking from their busted caps. It glided through the store, appearing in front of them within the vodka bottles and whiskey. Mort watched on with a grave expression as it vanished completely.

Their eyes had followed the moving figure from one end of the shop to the other. And their silent stare now fell upon the drinks can on the countertop.

Jerry’s ear twitched as he heard Mort take a step backwards. Jerry did not. He was frozen in a fatal blend of curiosity and fear where all sound soon faded along with all other senses. The can began to shake. The aluminium casing twitching as the contents pressed and writhed to push its prison apart. The container spasmed upon the counter, building in intensity as the sound of clanking metal against the hard counter filled the room. Soon, the can was bouncing itself up and down, sliding and tipping as the metal deformed with the building pressure. Like a teapot screaming for release. 

Mort clenched his cold and clammy fingers on Jerry’s collar and pulled on the clerk quickly as he bolted for the backroom, slamming his skinny frame against the door as he urged Jerry with his movements to reach safety before that can exploded. The two men fell through the doorway. Jerry, snapping from his shock, fiddled with his breast pocket for the door key before pulling the door closed and turning the lock.

Jerry’s back slid down the door as the man slumped to the ground. He hadn’t blinked in so long that his pupils were almost cracking like brittle clumps of sand. His mouth was equally as dry as his shallow breath reverberated through his mouth like a death rattle.

The two locked eyes for a moment as the sound of the can erupting outside made them both startle. Like a shotgun firing from next door.

“Is- is there anything in here?”
“No. I forgot to bring a water bottle today.”

Mort nodded as his eyes darted around the office, staring at the empty boxes and cabinets until catching a glimpse of the phone on the desk. It almost fell out of his hands as they trembled with seismic intensity. His frail fingers passing over the dial pad.

From the store, the sound of a glass bottle shattering echoed throughout the building. Jerry shook. Then another. This time closer along the cabinets to the backroom. For every bottle that smashed, spilling its contents across the floor outside, Jerry could hear them get closer and closer. He began to whimper silently.

The phone began to purr and the dial tone began to fill Mort’s ears. His concentration shrinking and shrinking until the whole world was dead-set on the phone in his hands. All sounds outside of his bubble now muffled and silenced. The operator picked up. Mort’s panicked and shaky words ricocheted throughout the room. The operator’s words sinking with his own into a soup of mental fog.

It was only then that he could begin to discern the sounds outside of his immediate attention; a low and bleak, muffled sound. Almost like groaning. But it was growing. The sound of pain, unimaginable pain. Jerry’s screams shattered the barrier of concentration as Mort’s own words trailed off. The phone in his sweaty palms trembling just as much as feet. His head turned slowly towards the door.

“Sir? I need you tell me what’s happening.”
Mort’s breath lodged in his throat. In all his strength, he couldn’t stop the tears from welling.
“Sir?”

“...it’s coming out through his eyes.”

His eyes were wrong. Not in color or shape, but in recognition. He looked at me like we’d met before. Like I had done something to him.  

I asked his name. 

He smiled but didn’t answer, just tilted his head like he was waiting for me to say it. My pen wouldn’t write when I tried to fill out the intake form. The line for Patient Name stayed blank, no matter how hard I pressed. And when I glanced at the mirror behind him, only one of us was visible. 

“You don’t remember me, do you, Rob?” He asked, his chuckle sharp. 

 My hand twitched, tracing a faint scar on my thumb, my brother’s pocketknife, a blood-oath gone wrong. The memory slipped away, but the patient’s eyes held it. 

“How do you know my name?” I asked. 

“I thought I'd be hard to forget. But you’ve been avoiding me for so long.” He leaned forward, as if testing my boundaries. 

“Maybe, maybe it’s easier if you pretend I'm not real, right? Easier for both of us.” 

I took a moment, gathering my words. 

“Well, what brings you in today?” 

He paused. 

“Well, I think it’s been you who’s brought me here.” 

“I didn’t mean to come, but it seems I've been following you for a while now.” 

He looked past me, focusing on... something. 

“It’s time you finally see me, don’t you think?” 

I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rise, a shiver I tried to ignore. 

""See you?"" I echoed, trying to regain control of the situation. ""I’m not sure what you’re implying. Care to clarify?"" 

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, his eyes seemed to scan the room, but his focus never left mine. 

""You’ve seen me. You just haven’t been looking."" His voice was low now, as if sharing a secret. ""And you never wanted to."" 

The silence between us stretched, the sound of the clock ticking louder than it should have been. I tried to brush off the unsettling feeling, but it crept up, sinking deeper into my skin. 

“I’m afraid I don’t understand.” My voice came out more strained than I intended, but he didn’t seem to notice. 

“No,” he said softly. ""You do. You just buried it."" 

There was a sudden pressure in the air, like we were both holding our breath. Waiting. Waiting for something. 

I glanced at the mirror again. This time, I didn’t just see myself; his reflection stared back at me. 

And in that moment, I knew: I had seen him before. But the memory slipped away, like water through my fingers. 

I stood up to signal the end of the session, trying to keep my composure. “Let’s meet next week,” I said, the words coming out mechanically. 

He nodded, slowly, like he understood something I didn’t. But before he stood, he leaned in slightly, his voice dropping to a near whisper. 

“You’re not sure if I’ll come back, are you?” 

I froze, hand still on the door. He had a point, but I couldn’t allow myself to acknowledge it. 

“I’ll see you next week,” I repeated, this time more firmly. 

As I walked him out, the hallway felt different. Longer. The light flickered as if struggling to keep up with my thoughts. I glanced at the clock, but I swear the minute hand had moved too quickly. 

When I turned back to my office, I saw the reflection again—the same reflection I had seen in the mirror. It wasn’t just a flicker this time. I saw myself... and him. Standing beside me. 

But when I blinked, it was gone. 

The notes from that session were a complete blur. I went over them  

again and again, yet the handwriting wasn’t quite mine. It felt as though there was more beneath the surface, something I couldn’t put my finger on. 

I picked up the pen, but it wouldn’t write. 

I blinked. There were new words on the page. The same, unnatural writing. 

“You’ll understand soon.” 

“God damn it!” I slammed the notebook shut, my heart pounding. 

The next appointment came quickly. 

“Hello again,” I said. 

“You don’t seem to be listed in our records. How long have you been seeing a therapist?” 

“I haven’t. I felt—a pull. Like I was meant to come to you.” 

“Why do you think that is?” I replied as he smirked. 

“People are capable of horrible things, Rob. You’re not special.” 

I glanced again at the mirror. This time, it wasn’t a person, but a crime. A violent, bloody crime. 

The patient tilted his head, watching me with detached amusement, while humming a song. So familiar, yet I couldn’t put my finger on it. 

“That blood on the window,” he said calmly, “it’s yours. You tried to forget, didn’t you? But some stains, they don't wash off. They linger. 

He smiled again, but this time, it was softer. Not mocking—reminiscing. 

“You called it an accident.” 

He paused. 

“But it wasn’t. That’s for sure.” 

I sat there, unmoving. After an eternity, I gathered the words for a response. 

“I don’t know who you are or what you want, but I did no such thing.” 

He smirked, then began to chuckle. 

He walked out of the room. 

An unsettling calm washed over me, but beneath it, a powerful urge took root. I had to know. Know what he meant, know why that blood was on the window. A fragmented image flashed in my mind: a dark shape, a glint of metal, a muffled sound, but it vanished before I could grasp it. I stood up, my legs feeling heavy and unfamiliar, and found myself moving towards the hallway, drawn by an invisible thread in the direction he went. I walked towards the lobby, determined to find the truth. I passed by the front desk and decided to ask them where the patient went. 

“Did a man leave just now?” 

“No, you’ve been alone for an hour, Rob.” 

\*\*\* 

The next morning, my desk had a sticky note on it. My handwriting, at least I think so. 

“Stop pretending.” 

I read that in my kitchen. When my head moved up, I was in my office. The patient was waiting, as if he knew I was going to be there. 

I sat down, my throat tight, expecting his usual smirk or cryptic words. But he just stared, silent, his eyes locked on mine. No tilt of the head, no chuckle—nothing. The clock ticked, each second stretching into a void. I cleared my throat, tried to start. 

“So,” I said, voice cracking, “why are you here today?” 

He didn’t blink. His gaze bore into me, heavy, like it was peeling back my skin. I shifted in my chair, the pen trembling in my hand. 

“What do you know about Daniel?” I pressed, desperation creeping in. 

Still nothing. The mirror behind him flickered, showing only me, then him, then me again. My reflection’s eyes weren’t mine, they were his, blue and sad, like Daniel’s. I looked away, my heart pounding. 

“Say something!” I shouted, slamming my fist on the desk. 

He leaned forward, just an inch, and the air thickened. No words, but his silence screamed louder than any accusation. I felt it, the weight of what I’d buried, pressing down, suffocating. 

“You’re not real,” I said. My voice was shaking, but I kept going. “You’re something I made up.” 

“Isn’t that the same thing?” he asked. 

I threw a chair. I don’t know why. Maybe some part of me thought that hurting him would end this for good. Instead, the chair hit the wall and fell apart like it was made of paper. 

He just stared at me. Pity in his eyes. 

“You buried me,” he said, “Deep. But you can still feel the weight, can’t you?” 

I rushed him. Fist clenched, breath ragged. I needed to hit something. 

The moment I made contact—pain. White-hot, lancing through my ribs. Like I’d punched myself. Hard. 

I fell back, gasping. He hadn’t moved. 

“You can’t hurt me,” he said softly. “You’d only be hurting yourself.” 

“What the hell are you doing to me!” I screamed. 

“You are doing this to yourself. We both know it.” 

I stood there, silent. 

After a while, I curled into my chair, heart hammering. My hands were trembling. 

“It wasn’t an accident,” I whispered. 

He stepped closer and started laughing. 

“There it is! You're finally listening!” 

Blood on the glass, a scream. A sharp glint. The flash of a wrist twisting. 

I sobbed. I don’t remember starting, but I couldn’t stop. 

The lights buzzed. When I looked again, he was gone. Only one chair in the room. Just me. 

But in the mirror, we were both still there. 

He was watching me. 

Waiting. 

I opened my notebook. The pen worked again. I didn’t remember writing the final sentence. 

“He didn’t die. I just left him in the dark long enough to forget he was screaming.” 

The notebook slipped from my hands, the words burning through me. My chest heaved, the air too thick, the room too small. The mirror stared back, but it wasn’t my office anymore. It was the kitchen, our kitchen, the one in the house where Daniel and I grew up, where we’d carved our initials into the table and swore we’d never be like Dad. 

The vision hit like a blade. I was there again, the fluorescent light buzzing, the air sour with whiskey and rage. Daniel stood across from me, his eyes wild. 

“You took it all, Rob!” He shouted, slamming his fist on the counter. “Dad’s money, the house, everything! You left me with nothing!” 

 His words cut deeper than they should’ve, unearthing years of guilt; I'd been the one who ‘made it,’ while Daniel drowned in debt and drugs. I tried to explain that dad’s will wasn’t my choice, but he laughed, bitter. 

“You’re just like him, a liar.” 

 

I didn’t know when I took the knife. It was sitting there, in the block by the sink, its handle clenched in my palm. 

“Shut up, Dan,” I growled, but he kept going, daring me. 

“What, you gonna fix me, therapist?” 

 His shove sent me flying back, and then something snapped. I lunged, the knife sinking into his chest—once, twice, blood pouring out. He gasped, stumbled, and crashed into the kitchen window, his hands clawing the glass desperately. 

“Robert...” he whispered, sliding down, his eyes locked on mine, wide with shock. 

 I froze, the knife clanging to the floor, a memory flashing: us as kids, pressing our hands to that window, dreaming of escape. 

I blinked, and the vision disappeared. I was back in my office, the mirror blank, the patient gone. But the blood, it lingered in my mind, like a wound that just won’t close. I’d covered it up, hadn’t I? Dragged Dan’s body to the basement, wrapped it in a tarp. Smashed the side window, tipped over chairs, cut my own arm to sell the story. 

An intruder. A fight. Daniel “missing.” 

Days blurred. I stopped answering calls, let appointments pile up. Colleagues left voicemails: 

“Rob, you okay?” 

But I couldn’t face them. My office became a cave, papers strewn, mirrors draped with shirts, but the window found me. In my apartment’s glass door, in the coffee shop’s storefront, in every polished surface, blood, Dan’s handprint, his face pressed against the pane, mouthing, why, Rob? The patient’s voice followed, soft, 

“You see him now, don’t you? You can’t unsee blood.” 

His sessions, if you can even call them that, grew worse. He’d sit there, his face shifting, sometimes Dan’s, sometimes mine. 

 “You took the fortune, Rob,” he’d say. “But you paid in blood. You’re next.” 

 Mirrors showed the kitchen window, Daniel’s body slumped, blood dripping upward, defying gravity. Once, I swore I heard his voice, not the patient’s, but Daniel’s, whispering through the glass:  

“You kept it all, Rob. Give it back.” 

\*\*\* 

I don’t know when I decided to end it. Maybe when I found a note in my handwriting, Free him, Rob, tucked in my coat. Maybe when the patient said,  

“You can’t live with both of us.” 

 I drove to the office at midnight, the city a maze of glass, every pane reflecting the kitchen window: blood, Daniel’s hand, his dying gasp. I climbed the stairs to the roof, my legs heavy. The door was unlocked, like it was waiting. 

The rooftop was cold, the wind sharp. Below, the city glimmered, a thousand windows staring up. Every one was the kitchen window, blood streaked; Daniel’s face pressed against it, his body falling, over and over. Some showed him alive, laughing as a kid, our hands on the glass, promising to share everything. Others showed the knife, my hand twisting, his blood spraying. The patient stood at the edge, his voice soft, almost kind. 

 “You see him everywhere, Rob. Free him.” 

I stepped to the ledge, my heart pounding. I believed it, believed my death would release him, let his spirit rest, maybe let us be brothers again.  

“I’ll make it right, Dan,” I whispered, picturing us young, free, before Dad’s shadow, before the fortune tore us apart. The patient’s eyes were Daniel’s now, blue and sad. 

“Come home, Rob,” he said. “We’re brothers again.” 

I leaned forward. The wind roared, the glass below a sea of blood and memory. The panes flickered—Daniel’s face, our childhood, the knife, the blood—then went dark. The wind stopped. For the first time in what seemed like forever, it was silent. I let go, and the world tilted as I dropped into the glass below. ",1,1766278328.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1prtiqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1prtiqv/pietro_vs_femobook_a4z/,pietro vs femobook a4z,"First off — I want to say I’m incredibly grateful to u/impossible_cow_9178 for the time and effort they’ve put into comparing the Pietro, Femobook A4Z, and ZP6. That post was hugely helpful and clearly written with a lot of care. No disrespect intended at all — just trying not to overweight a single opinion, no matter how good it is.

That said, I think I’ve narrowed my decision down to two grinders and would really love to hear from others in the community who’ve used either (or ideally both): Femobook OR A4Z Pietro

My coffee preferences / context:

•	⁠I brew almost exclusively pour-over at home.
•	⁠I drink a wide variety of coffee, but tend to lean toward washed Central American beans.
•	⁠I also enjoy funkier coffees, including naturals and the occasional co-ferment.
•	⁠I care a lot about clarity, sweetness, and fruit/floral expression, but don’t want cups to feel overly thin.

What I’m wrestling with:

•	⁠I’m currently leaning toward the A4Z, especially because of workflow and usability.
•	⁠I’ve always been under the impression that flat burrs = better clarity, which makes me a little skeptical since the A4Z is often described as using a ZP6-style burr set in an electric format (even though I understand that consistent RPM can make a big difference).
•	⁠The Pietro appeals to me conceptually, but the workflow/UI gives me pause compared to the A4Z. - And I guess you just always have to be worried about batteries and motors going bad vs a hand grinder a lot less can go wrong over time.

What I’d love input on:

•	⁠For those who’ve used either grinder: how would you describe the cup profile?
•	⁠If you’ve used both: where do you feel the biggest differences are in taste and daily use?
•	⁠Do you feel the A4Z gives up anything meaningful compared to the Pietro in terms of clarity or depth?

Sorry for the long post — just trying to make a well-informed decision. Really appreciate any insights!",1,1766278326.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

1. I bought the macadamia nut syrup from Kai coffee because she raves about how good the latte is every time she's in Hawaii. I've never been to Hawaii so I thought I'd splurge on the shipping. I looked up their instagram and Kai coffee is owned by white haoles who are trump supporters. They buy and sell the syrup from a small business and slap their sticker on it. They sent me a bottle with the original packaging. The small business sells their syrup for cheaper and better shipping price. When I emailed them that I felt like this was not transparent business, they ignored my email. So I left a bad review on yelp at their store front. They messaged me on yelp cussing me out and calling me all types of names. Such insane behavior from business owners but not surprising coming from trump supporters. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS. 
2.  All the clothes she buys are made of plastic and poor quality. She does so many brand deals with White Fox Boutique, and yes I know they are fast fashion. I received a defective item, sent them pictures, and they still refused to let me return it for a full refund. I had to file a chargeback with my bank. I know other influencers promote WFB but tbh I can't think of one who promotes it at least once a year like she does. 
3.  I had a roommate in college who bought a long sleeve from Remi's poshmark. When she received it, it was so smelly and musty. My roommate tried to wash it out multiple times but it still smelled bad. It was stained with the smell of Febreze/Bath and Body work candle scents mixed with the musty sweat and BO. Didn't even know that could be possible. 

We all know she is an overconsumption queen and has no standards but it is such a waste of money for average people who actually work a 9-5 job. She is a terrible influencer. I hate when people recommend things that aren't good. I have good discernment when it comes to marketing and buying things online. These products are objectively bad. No one should be promoting this shit. She's not doing vlogmas this year but she's still doing small business promotions. As a consumer I always make sure I know what I'm giving my money to. As an influencer you have an obligation to do that diligence for your viewers.",6,1766278158.0,snarkingwithremi,0,1.0,False

Hello again!

Quick update for **Anime World India** addon - version **0.0.2** is out.

The big change:

# 🔗 IMDb ID integration

The addon now uses **IMDb IDs** instead of its own internal IDs.

What this means in practice:

* Streams from **Anime World India** now properly **integrates with other Stremio catalogs**
* Other addons (especially **subtitle addons**) can now **provide subtitles** to streams from this addon

This should make the addon play much nicer with the rest of your setup. Unfortunately, people who installed [0.0.1](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1pr9huw/comment/nv2f91f) must reinstall it

# 🚀 Install / update

* Go to the: [**https://github.com/skoruppa/anime-world-stremio-addon**](https://github.com/skoruppa/anime-world-stremio-addon)
* Find url to the onrender instance in project's description

Click on it and do what you need to do ;)

# ⚡ Quick Recap

For anyone who missed the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1pr9huw/comment/nv2f91f):

This is an **Stremio addon** that pulls anime streams from **Anime World India**, a page focusing on anime with:

* Hindi
* Tamil
* Telugu
* English
* Japanese

audio

The addon started mainly as a learning playground - a way for me to experiment with LLM-assisted development, based on the architecture of my earlier anime addon Docchi (anime with Polish subtitles), which you can find [here](https://github.com/skoruppa/docchi-stremio-addon).

# ☕ Support

If you find the addon useful and want to say thanks, you can [buy me a coffee](https://buycoffee.to/skoruppa).",5,1766277577.0,StremioAddons,1,1.0,False

what helped (this is gonna sound dumb):

I started going to this coffee shop every morning for like 3 weeks. same one. just forced myself to say ""thanks"" to the barista and make eye contact. that's it at first.

week 2 I added ""how's your day going?"" felt awkward as fuck but I kept doing it.

by week 3 the barista started conversations with me first. sounds small but it like broke something in my brain. realized people aren't analyzing everything I say.

then I tried it at my gym. small talk with the front desk person. then random people between sets. gradually got less weird about it.

now I can actually have conversations at parties without wanting to die. still not perfect but way better than 6 months ago.

idk if this helps anyone but that gradual exposure thing really worked for me. don't try to go from 0 to 100 overnight, that's where I kept failing before.

I’ll be spending about three weeks in Newport Beach starting soon with my family and would love to meet a few people and start building some community while I’m here.

I’m 42, married, three kids (9, 10, 14), run a company based in Colorado, and work remotely most days. Interested in meeting grounded people who enjoy routines, good conversations, being active, and actually living life where they are.

Things I’m into:

* Morning walks / runs
* Lifting or fitness
* Coffee 
* Talking business, investing, books, ideas, life
* Family-friendly hangs (kids in sports, etc.)
* Simple stuff done consistently
* Games / Beach stuff

We’ll be around long enough that it feels more like temporarily living here than vacationing, so I’m hoping to meet people who enjoy community. 

If that resonates, feel free to comment or DM. Even meeting a couple solid people would make the stay better.",0,1766277303.0,newportbeach,0,0.5,False
1prt641,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1prt641/the_healthiest_ive_ever_been/,The Healthiest I've ever been,"(Content warning: Self harm, and Teeth lose) 

“Hello, Mr. Davidson, how are we feeling today?” The Doctor asked, reading off a chart before sitting on a rolling stool.

Mr. Davidson smiled at the bald man. “I feel the healthiest I’ve ever been!”

“So, what are we seeing you for today?” The Doctor asked, making quick glances between Mr. Davidson and his chart.

“It started last Tuesday. I woke up and found my knees didn’t hurt anymore. It was like a miracle, I felt all shiny and new. But nothing else happened that Tuesday.” Mr.Davidson explained happily. “Then on Wednesday, my back stopped feeling.”

Mr. Davidson stopped talking. Forcing the Doctor to look up from his clipboard. “Stop feeling... what?” He looked distressed, eyes flicking between the clipboard and his patient.

“It stopped feeling sore, the pain was just gone like my knees the day before. I could breathe a bit easier, but I don’t remember ever having any issues breathing. I don’t smoke, and as a geologist, I’ve lived a decently active life. But suddenly I felt like a little kid again. I started to worry slightly at that point.”

The Doctor flipped through his two pages on his clipboard, searching for something. Only to shake his head, blowing air out of his nose. “And that’s why you decided to stop in today?”

“No, first I went to my family doctor on Thursday, a DR.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. He ran the standard test, and that’s when he told me the best news I’ve ever been told.”

**“You’re the healthiest you’ve ever been.”**

The Doctor shuffled uncomfortably on his stool. He cleared his throat, “Ahem, so why are you here today, Mr. Davidson?”

Mr. Davidson chuckled, as if it were embarrassing to say. “I slept weird on Friday, I’d left my arm dangling over the bed. When I woke up, it didn’t work right. My elbow had come undone. Like my bones were too heavy for my joints.”

“Could you still use your arm?” The Doctor asked, tapping his pen on his mustache.

Mr. Davidson responded chipper as ever. “Of course, I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been.” The Doctor cringed, looking away as Mr. Davidson demonstrated. “It was scary, but I had to go work my shift at the coffee shop.”

“You didn’t think to stay home?” The Doctor’s interjection was stiff with little true emotion in his interruption.

David took the interruption in stride. “I almost called an ambulance. But then I remembered what the Doctor had told me.”

**“YOU’RE THE HEALTHIEST YOU’VE EVER BEEN.”**

The Doctor’s face twinged at the phrase. This was the first time it had felt threatening. “What did you do after that?”

“I found an old sling from a shoulder surgery I went through last year.” David beamed at his own ingenuity. “Making coffee with one arm is rather hard. But I didn’t want to upset any of my regulars.”

The Doctor has to flip furiously through his clipboard. He looked like he had to think of something on the fly. “I thought you were a geologist? Why are you working at a Coffee shop?”

“That’s not what you asked yesterday, Doctor.” Mr. Davidson growled, forcing the Doctor to jump off the stool. The pages of the script he was reading from fluttered off his clipboard as it fell to the floor. His hands trembled as he swallowed a curse. “Mr. Davidson, I don’t know what you mean. This is the first time you’ve been in my office.” He spoke slowly and deliberately, trying to re-steer the conversation. “I’m just trying to get a better understanding of your condition.”

“Of course, I’ve been getting things jumbled up recently. I’m a hobbyist geologist, but it doesn’t pay all of my bills when I’m not doing work for the museum. So I work as a barista part time.” Mr. Davidson jumped on the track eagerly.

The Doctor scooped up the now empty clipboard and snatched up a few script pages. He clicked his pen and began writing for the first time. “Did anything else happen on Friday?”

“I lost a few teeth in a customer’s drink. I sneezed real hard after some cocoa dust got in my nose. Don’t worry, I remade the girl’s drink, wouldn’t want to upset a pretty girl.” Mr. Davidson chuckled to himself.

“Surely that hurt, David. Was there any blood?” The Doctor asked, suddenly more casual. At Mr.Davidson’s silence, he tried to walk it back. “May I call you David?”

**“David...David...david... DAVID. Am I David?”** David asked, sounding unsure.

The Doctor took a deep breath, and David mimicked the action. “Your name can be shortened to David. Yes, you are David.”

“I understand. Thank you, Doctor. That feels important.” David thanked him.

The Doctor felt himself break out in a cold sweat at IT’S tone. He had to clear his throat before speaking again. “I’m here to help. Now, about the sudden tooth loss.”

“Yes, but I didn’t mind after all-”

**“YOU'RE THE HEALTHIEST YOU’VE EVER BEEN.”**

“But my Boss sent me home after that. I guess he didn’t understand.” David chuckled again in the same upbeat optimism. The exact same chuckle played back like a recording. “With the rest of the day off, I followed my boss’s advice to see a Doctor.”

“But why if your-” The Doctor stopped himself from saying the phrase with great effort.

David nodded, “Yes, that’s what they kept whispering to me after all. I just needed to trust them to feel it.” He went silent, leading the Doctor to ask who they were. “I don’t know, they became me and I them.”

“What are they?” The Doctor narrowed his questions.

David asked the same question back, but not to the Doctor. Then something else answered their questions. **“DAVID IS THE HEALTHIEST HE’S EVER BEEN.”**

The Doctor became pale at the sudden emergence of this **“OTHER.”** His eyes searched the office for some helpful guidance. When he found none, the Doctor took a shaky breath. He had to wipe sweat from his forehead.

**“IS THE DOCTOR UNWELL?”** The Other asked him directly in the Doctor’s own head. It sounded wispy and everywhere at once. It sounded cruel yet caring, like it didn’t know which it was being. Something was standing behind the Doctor. He knew it was there. Felt the tingle down the base of his skull, like fingernails down his neck. The Doctor started hyperventilating as he saw claws curl around his neck.

“NO! No, I’m fine. I’d like David to continue telling me about his condition today.” The Doctor practically screamed at it as he drilled his eyes forward at David. The Other vanished, or was never there to begin with. He couldn’t tell anymore.

Cheerful David came back like someone had pulled the string on his back to get him talking. “My Family practice got me in almost immediately once I showed up at their window. They took so many more tests. I remember asking if I was still the healthiest I’ve ever been. Instead, he said something pretty particular then.”

David fell silent, waiting for another string pull. The Doctor was growing more hesitant to be the one to pull it. “What did they say to you, David?”

“That I wasn’t human anymore. They told me to wait at home for the rest of the results. But as I sat on my bed waiting for the results, my legs came undone. Just like my arm had done. My body felt so heavy I couldn’t sit upright anymore. So, instead, I lay on the floor. I couldn’t breathe, I remember crying-”

“GOD, HELP ME!-” David screamed, suddenly no longer the puppet for a moment.

“-Which was so strange, since I wasn’t a religious person-” Two separate Davids were now speaking and screaming parts of the same moment.

“-GOD, PLEASE MAKE IT STOP! I DON'T WANT TO DIE!-”

“She must have heard me because she took the pain away. She reminded me-” David stopped and let it explain.

**“YOU’RE THE HEALTHIEST YOU’VE EVER BEEN, DAVID.”**

“-And of course She was right, She was the reason **I was the Healthiest I’ve ever been.**” David scratched his empty eye socket, flicking a bit of lingering flesh off his claw casually. The black speck hit the glass between them. The Doctor’s mouth hung open as David paused at the sudden appearance of a barrier between them. David jumped off the bed and pressed his black, dripping hands on the glass. Seeing his hands caught him off guard. The flesh was charred and flaking, black blood oozed out, but never off of him. It merely ran back inside another hole in his arms. Blue crystal like bones peeked out where the flesh sagged, hanging ragged off his forearms. His finger bones pierced the skin. A flex of his hands shredded what flesh remained as vicious, curved claws ticked against the glass. Crystal bones grew like bone spurs, leaving tree-like growth rings as new bones grew on old ones.

David pressed his face closer to the glass. His breath steamed the previously invisible barrier between himself and the Doctor. He stared at his own reflection. His human face hung on his chest like sliced meat, where it had been displaced by the clear reptilian blue crystal snout that had grown on his white skull like a mask. The old skin around the corners of his eyes traced what was left of his upper jaw and down the back of his neck. His back molars were exposed without lips to cover the crystal growth that extended his jaw into his new snout. David touched the human teeth and traced a claw where they turned to jagged crystal fangs two teeth over. Finally, he stopped at the front canines meant to bite and tear. The lower jaw opened and closed like a broken machine. His breathing grew rapid until his chest swelled and he expelled thick, viscous sludge on the floor of his containment unit. He dug his claws through the human bone of his skull, tearing the white pieces away. David tore into his own throat, looking for his voice. Black splattered the glass as IT laughed.

“DAVID!” The Doctor shouted, standing near the glass. “David, are you still in there?” He banged a fist on the glass, trying to draw his attention. David roared, deep guttural, not a trace of sound a human throat could produce. The black ooze filled the holes he’d torn in his own head. Ossifying rapidly into more blue crystal. But David stopped tearing at himself. He took lumbering steps back towards the glass. The Doctor stepped away, scared, as David leaned back on the clear barrier. He fogged the glass once again, his hand took the dangling face on his chest and folded it back till it flopped on his snout. David’s face no longer fit on his head. The Doctor called his name again, and David ripped the human face from his body. He shoved the former face down his own snout, dissolving it into more black ooze the second it touched his mouth. Through the gaping hole in his chest behind a crystal rib cage. The Doctor watched it flow back into his body.

David pressed his snout into the glass, staring at the Doctor for a long moment. His shoulders heaved up and down. The glass fogged rapidly as he panted on it. The Doctor approached the containment slowly, hand extended. David didn’t move, only breathed faster, the closer the man got. The Doctor did not touch the glass. He slammed his palm into a button. David couldn’t see from his side of the glass. An alarm sounded as amber lights started to spin within David’s room. He flinched away from them, trying to cover his head from the piercing sound. David punched the glass, threatened, scared of what was going on. His claws screeched as they scratched glass between them. David suddenly stopped acting scared as he looked up at the little flames that started to burn on the ceiling above him.

As if understanding what was about to happen, David stalked over to the metal table. He sat on it, folding his claws in his lap and staring at the Doctor on the other side. “See you tomorrow, Dr. Morris.”

\~

Dr. Morris felt a cold sickness in his stomach as the flames washed over the thing sitting on the repurposed morgue table. The thing known as David disappeared behind the curtain of chemical flames. He’d heard the voice clear as day within his own head. It knew his name now, and he’d taught it to understand what names meant. The creature didn’t scream or struggle as the flames cleaned the unit. Morris didn’t take his eyes off the glass until the flames stopped. Improbably, the only thing left in the containment unit was the crystal skull. Completely untouched by the flames, not even clouded by the smoke. It stared directly at him with its empty sockets. Simply waiting for tomorrow, it now has a concept of. The Doctor stumbled away from the button, sweating profusely. Armed soldiers poured into the mock doctor’s office.

“What happened, Doctor? It wasn’t time yet.” The man in front searched the room with his eyes behind his gas mask. He gripped his rifle as he stared at the skull in the chamber.

Dr. Morris wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, “I messed up, I had to go off-script. It... HE became aggressive, I had to restart the cycle.”

“What did it learn?” The soldier asked, only taking quick glances towards the doctor. Afraid to look at the skull for more than a moment.

The Doctor looked at the floor, exhausted. “It learned how to shorten its name, and about tomorrow and Yesterday.” He hid the fact that he now knew his name, somehow. The fact that he heard it in his head. Dr. Morris kept that to himself, scared.

“And the fucking glass, if it remembers that this whole thing is useless.” Another stepped forward, poking the long scratch with the barrel of his gun. He had a slight twang to his voice. “Thing scratched the Polycarbonate, Goddamn. How’d it manage that?”

The first soldier turned his back to the glass, an act of bravado. An act to show he was in charge and not afraid of the thing. His head kept trying to look back at the skull regardless. “We don’t know if it has that much object permanence,yet.” The “yet” was thrown in almost involuntarily at the end. He had to swallow before continuing. “We’ll try the script again tomorrow. If it doesn’t work, we’ll burn it, refuel, and try a new routine.” The soldier focused completely on Dr. Morris. “How do you feel, Doctor?”

Dr.Morris took a deep breath. “I’m fine, **I FEEL HEALTHIER THAN I’VE EVER BEEN.”** Morris froze, mouth gasping at the words that had tumbled out. Why’d he say that? Oh God, why had he said those-

The bullet entered the back of his head, cutting the thought short. Dr. Morris dropped face down on the floor. Everyone stood painfully still, staring at the dead doctor. There wasn’t an exit hole from the rifle round. Black blood oozed out the back of his skull, congealed like sludge. Every soldier jumped away from the body.

“Get him in the burner, NOW!” The first soldier screamed in panic. Two other people quickly grabbed the dead doctor under his armpits and dragged him through the airlock into the containment unit. He hit the button as soon as his people were clear. The flames left nothing but charred bones. Clear crystals had begun to grow between the joints. The Doctor’s skull had a large patch growing right on the ridge of his skull. A bullet could be seen, stopped on the inside of the skull.

No one spoke as they left the room and silently went to decontamination. But David watched till the lights switched off.

I know everyone is stressed, tired, and in a rush right now, but the way other baristas and myself have been treated lately is insane. Yelling over drink wait times, snapping because we’re out of something, acting like we personally ruined their day because their order isn’t perfect… it’s exhausting.

Most of us are working understaffed shifts, dealing with constant rushes, and doing our best to keep things moving while still being friendly. We don’t control supply shortages, prices, or how busy it gets. We’re just trying to make your coffee and get through our shift.

What gets me is how normalized it feels for people to talk down to service workers, especially during the holidays, when kindness is supposedly the theme. A little patience, a “thank you,” or even just basic respect makes a huge difference.

Then you get to keep a full bottle of your favorite blend.  they include corking, labels you can write on to name it and waxing of the bottle top.  the wine is good quality.  the other really cool feature is their roof top bar.  live music on weekends and heaters with covered areas.  very wet here so it was well planned out for our climate.

1prt0uz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1prt0uz/i_grew_up_in_a_haunted_house/,I grew up in a haunted house.,"Growing up, it was just a normal house. I didn’t know anything different. My granddad built it years before I was born. The carpets were always a little damp, the closets always smelt like mildew, the edges of the windows always got moldy in the summer months… It was home.

I had one of those race car beds when I was five years old. A bright red one. It left an imprint in the carpet that never fully came out. My earliest memories are in that bed - listening to the sound of the pipes in the walls, or the uneven buzzing rotating fan. It was always so loud at night. Before I fell asleep, I’d roll over to see the eyes in the closet.

I always checked for them, and they were always there. They never moved aside from blinking or glancing around... Fixed in place. Studying me, it felt like, and I studied them right back. There were a lot of nights spent watching them until I fell asleep. It was comforting, somehow. A constant to focus on… I don’t remember feeling scared until years later. There wasn’t anything in that closet that could’ve created the illusion of eyes like that… Not a single thing.

“You just had a big imagination,” my dad said when I mentioned it as an adult. I chose to think so, too. “Probably remembering a dream.”

Really, there was no rational reasoning behind a lot of what I saw in my childhood. I got used to it, I guess. Five years old, eight years old, twelve years old - I didn’t really question it until I was eighteen or so, when I realized my whole childhood felt like an uneasy, foggy blur. Why? Those memories just felt… I don’t know. Strange, off. Uneasy, like I said.

I never saw any of those things after I moved out at eighteen. I never had that eerie feeling - eyes on the back of your head, you know? I never felt the need to walk with my back to the wall, or leave a light on overnight. My dingy little apartment was comfortable and safe feeling, like a breath of fresh air.

My girlfriend - now wife - loved the stories. She loves all things spooky and scary, has since she was a little girl. Halloween was a bigger deal than Christmas, in her family. She used to ask all the time to hear the stories of “the ghosts.” Over and over, never tired of them. She called them ghosts, anyway, so that’s what I started calling them too.

She loved it even more when I started bringing her with me to visit my parents… At least, at first. That mildew-smelling, stained walls, soggy carpet house eventually put her on edge just like it did me. Sitting around the kitchen table, a pot of coffee on, clock ticking on the wall. Innocent, familiar things that felt off. As an adult, every time I came around, I just wanted to leave again. 

My parents liked to tell her all about my childhood, about my active imagination, about all the stuff I came up with. The eyes in the closet, of course, just a figment of my imagination. The shadowy figures in the corners, darting in and out of my peripheral, those were just me creeping myself out because I watched all those “darn scary movies.” 

They’d talk about the man under the stairs that I sobbed about as a three year old… Don’t even remember that one, but hearing them talk about it made me nauseous. The hands coming down from the attic door… Yeah, just disembodied hands, I know. My mom always got unsettled about it, but pretended she wasn’t. Both of them pretended they never saw a thing. I don’t know why. 

“Look at you,” my mom would laugh one day, “35 years old and you still won’t sit with your back to the hallway!”

Yet she wouldn’t sit in that chair, either. 

There was one ghost I didn’t like to talk about. One my parents didn’t laugh about. 

The lady with the long neck. 

Long, pale neck like a scaleless snake - never saw the end of it, so I assumed she had no body. She didn’t move if you looked at her, just stared back, big wide eyes and no mouth. She had long hair like mom. Same freckles. But her eyes weren’t bright and her brow was always furrowed. I think she was angry, or upset. I don’t know.

She would peek around the doorway if I didn’t close my door, so I learned fast to double check before bed that it was shut tight. If I got up to pee in the night, she’d be halfway up the stairs, watching. Just the top of her head would be visible through the window if my curtains weren’t closed… Sometimes, even, she’d pop up around the foot of my bed. 

I remember crying, scared to death, because she’d get closer every time my eyes blurred too much. I remember hiding under my comforter, trying not to move… Listening to her breath as it whistled out of her nose, feeling the sheet move with it. My memories are distant, but I can still feel that if I think back to it. 

That ghost was the worst one. I used to wet myself, way past the appropriate age, because I couldn’t get up with her staring like that. I was trapped. I’d babble about it to my parents, and they’d… Help, to the best of their ability. Nightlights, glow in the dark stars on the ceiling. I switched rooms with them, even slept out in the living room for a while. The hallway light stayed on every night for years. 

They adopted a cat for me when I was twelve. That poor cat spent three years hiding under the couch and then got out one day and was never seen again.

Nothing helped. Even as a teenager, if I got up in the night, I’d squint my eyes and stare down at my own feet to avoid seeing her. But I could always feel her watching. I could always hear that tiny whistle.

That house never felt comfortable. Always eerie, always chilly even on a hot summer day. The lights were a little too dim, no matter how fresh the bulb. They’d flicker. They’d buzz. My wife felt it from the very first time she stepped inside. It was grimy, even when freshly mopped and dusted. No matter how cheery the conversation, that heavy unsettling sensation stayed.

It lingered, too, followed you after you left. Stepping outside at night with baggies of leftovers and random trinkets mom decided I needed - should’ve felt warm, comforting. But that short walk from door to car was spent glancing over our shoulders and nervously laughing. 

The ride home, especially when dark, was spent in silence. Maybe some quiet music playing on the radio, while we carefully avoided looking in the back seat. I didn’t even like glancing at the trees on either side of the road. Getting home, we’d race inside. If we left something in the car? Well, naturally it’d have to wait until morning.

We had our first child, our son, around the time dad got sick. He’d gone gray, slowed down, sure… But him being sick still felt like a punch to the gut. I feel bad about it it now, but it was hard to focus on raising the kid. I still felt like a kid, myself, seeing my dad decline like that. Wasn’t he in his early thirties, yesterday? Felt helpless.

He stayed sick for ten long but short years, and I watched him quickly but slowly turn into an old man. He died at home, in his sleep. Peaceful and content and happy with his life…

He left the house colder. Death tends to do that.

After dad passed, I felt awful leaving mom all alone in there. She didn’t mind, she never accepted our invitations to come and stay with us - according to her, dad was still home. She’d talk to him all the time, knowing she wouldn’t get an answer but still feeling comfort from it. She really seemed to be doing alright.

She died only two years after him, much more suddenly. Went downhill in a weeks’ time and was gone. It was… Well, it was rough. 

And then my childhood home was empty. The distant memories I grew up with were alone in there. It was silent and freezing cold. Only mildew and dust and ghosts remained.

I wanted to sell it, or knock it down… But I couldn’t. Something in me was still there - that scared little boy, I guess, never gained the courage to get out of bed. I couldn’t leave him behind. So I saved up and planned and set to work. 

I had all these ideas in mind. Replacing the creaky wood in the kitchen with a nice tile. Taking the wallpaper down and painting the walls bright and refreshing colors. Rewiring everything from scratch. Peeling up those gross carpets, moving the aged furniture out… It felt lighter, as we went on, but… That feeling just never left. The guys would get jumpy, or text me that they couldn’t show up because they were feeling ill. Excuses were abundant, but I never got annoyed with anyone. I got it, believe me.

So, it was a slow process. Sometimes we’d go weeks without even stepping foot in the place. I came by to mow the lawn once or twice, unable to bring myself to look in the windows, but that would be it.

We got back on track this spring. I got a call on the way there, one rainy afternoon, from my buddy helping out. We’d finally started on the walls, one of the biggest steps.

“So much mold, man. Can’t believe it. Got masks on, now, have to wear ‘em. Black mold, uh, fungus? Yellow, stringy stuff - sorry, ‘nspecter rattled off a bunch of different types, don’t know the half of it. It’s all through the place!

1prstt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1prstt4/what_i_would_tell_my_past_self_about_healing_from/,What I would tell my past self about healing from complex/developmental trauma.,"In case this is helpful for someone: 

When I first went down this CPTSD rabbit hole, I felt like a lot of therapists and articles and podcasts and shit were blabbing on about embodiment and somatics and polyvagal theory and regulation and creating something called a ""felt sense"". 

But having never had a ""felt sense"" of ANYTHING other than fear and vigilance, I just had no idea what they were on about.

(It especially irked me because of the narrative about ""returning to a sense of safety"" - as though safety is a universal experience we have all experienced at some point. Such a privileged assumption.)

Here's what I wish someone said to me:

1) Healing isn't all about intense journaling and learning krav maga and having a big cry (although I fully recommend these things if it floats your boat). 

A lot of the healing happens in the boring, quiet, mundane moments. 🦥 It is a ""slow is smooth and smooth is fast"" kind of thing. If you think nothing is progress is too slow, you're probably in the right place. 

2) Your head and your body are operating somewhat independently, instead of as a team. (BTW that's a feature, not a bug! and it's probably kept you alive until now).

Your body thinks it is in the past and is still having scary feelings from the past (although you may not have noticed this because you are currently preoccupied with scary thoughts in your mind).

The key to learning to feel safe is to communicate to your body that it is safe.  You will need to learn an entirely new and completely foreign language to do this!

For you, that means treating your body like you would treat a scared child or pet who cannot see or hear: only feel. 🐣

3) How would you show this little tamagotchi of yours that they are safe? By gymming like a maniac, guzzling coffee and bouncing from activity to activity with no gaps in between? No. That's fight or flight and you know it. 

You show them with a warm bath. Less rushing. Hot water bottle. Big hugs. Little naps. Gentle stretching. Soft comfy clothes. Weighted blanket. Cuddling a purring cat. Sitting in the sun doing nothing. 

Some days it might mean taking up more physical space, because it feels safe to do so. Other days it might mean curling up into a tiny ball because that's what feels safest.

This child/body is your new responsibility and you need to stop and check in frequently. If you even remotely suspect it might be scared (clenched jaw? Tight muscles? Shallow breathing?) you need to STOP and go out of your way to SHOW it - not tell it - that everything is peaceful and safe and calm. 

So safe that it's BORING. Boring is the sweet spot. 👌

4) Keep going with your therapy and other stuff, but until you learn how to communicate with your body in it's own language, you will be bottlenecked in your recovery. 

Over time, if you continue to communicate with your body in this kind and caring way, you will create the blueprint for safety and regulation that you never had. A safety so strong you can eventually share it with others. 

What's more - to your absolute surprise and delight - your body will start to talk back to you.  And holy fuck it knows things. Amazing things. Terrible things. Powerful things. ✨

These treasures will make all of the molly-coddling and boringness well worth the effort, I promise you. ",4,1766276245.0,CPTSD,3,1.0,False

Take your guesses re: which of the following texts have been ai generated. Don't cheat via google:*

**1.** Morning arrived not as an event but as a soft persuasion, a gradual loosening of the dark, until the window admitted a pale intelligence that seemed to think for her. She lay still, attentive to the faint stirrings of the house—and felt her own mind assemble itself out of fragments: a sentence unfinished, a face once glimpsed in passing, a question that had no intention of being answered. It was strange, she reflected, how consciousness moved not in straight lines but in eddies, circling back, dipping beneath the surface, gathering meaning from what had appeared trivial. In such moments the self felt both intimate and dispersed, stretched thin across the hours, as if living were less a matter of doing than of enduring this continuous, shimmering awareness of being.

— 

**2.** The afternoon settled around her like a thought too long considered, neither urgent nor dismissible, and she found herself attending to the smallest shifts—the way the shadow of the chair lengthened, then paused, as if undecided, the way the air carried a faint residue of voices already spent. She felt the self loosen, its boundaries growing permeable, so that what she remembered and what she perceived mingled without dispute: a childhood walk beside water, the present hush of the room, the quiet anticipation of something unnamed. Life, she sensed, did not announce its meanings; it offered them obliquely, in these intervals of suspension, where nothing seemed to happen and yet everything was being arranged. To exist, at such times, was to consent to this subtle overflow, to let the mind drift and return, carrying with it the fragile conviction that even in stillness, something essential was unfolding.

—

**3.**

Your body enters mine  
like night entering warm water—  
slowly, deliberately,  
until the boundary forgets itself.

I learn you by touch:  
the curve where your shoulder  
becomes invitation,  
the hush beneath your skin  
where heat gathers, waiting.  
My hands speak first,  
clumsy with want,  
honest as hunger.

Your mouth—  
dark fruit split open—  
teaches me a new gravity.

I am held there,  
suspended between breath and surrender.

Even your stillness undresses me.  
Even your silence  
presses against my ribs  
like a second heart.  
I feel you  
before you move,  
before intention hardens into action—  
that brief, electric mercy  
where anything might happen.

The room fades.  
Time loosens its grip.  
There is only skin remembering skin,  
only the slow, delicious labor  
of learning how close  
two bodies can be  
without disappearing.

—

**4.**

I wake up with my teeth clenched,  
as if I’ve been holding something all night  
that didn’t belong to me.  
Dreams do that—  
they borrow your body,  
leaving it sore.

I stand at the sink in my underwear,  
watching the neighbor’s dog take a shit  
with complete confidence.  
There’s a lesson there  
I’m not ready to learn.

I used to think love  
was a kind of improvement project.  
If I just showed up softer, quieter,  
less myself,  
the walls wouldn’t crack.  
Turns out I was the load-bearing beam.

Some days my body feels like evidence—  
of time,  
of men,  
of grief that didn’t get processed properly  
and went straight to the hips.  
Other days it feels miraculous,  
still willing,  
still warm,  
still mine.

I miss people who were wrong for me  
in very specific ways.  
The way they laughed.  
The way they touched my arm  
as if checking I was real.  
The way we avoided the obvious  
until it became the ending.

I am tired of being brave.  
I want to be sloppy.  
I want pleasure without the exit interview.  
I want to stop translating myself  
into something more palatable.

Tonight I eat alone.  
I lick salt from my fingers.  
I let the quiet stay.  
This, too, is intimacy.

—

**5.**

The thing about the system—whatever name you pinned to it, whether Infrastructure, Destiny, or simply Tuesday—was that it never announced itself outright; it preferred instead to manifest through minor inconveniences, a missing file here, a delayed train there, the uncanny sense that every billboard was laughing just a half-second too late. Somewhere between the buzzing fluorescent lights and the coffee that tasted faintly of regret, a network of intentions hummed, vast and impersonal, yet oddly intimate, as if it knew your search history and your childhood nicknames in equal measure. You could feel it tightening, the way probabilities seemed to lean in certain directions, nudging conversations toward paranoia, coincidences toward inevitability. And though no one could quite prove its existence—no master switch, no central office—it left its signature everywhere: in the static between radio stations, in the footnotes no one read, in the creeping suspicion that meaning itself had been subcontracted out to forces operating just beyond the edge of comprehension, laughing softly as you tried, once again, to connect the dots.

**6.**

She sat at the table after the meal, her hands folded, attentive to the small, undeniable facts of the room: the dull sheen of the tabletop where it had been wiped too quickly, the chair leg that rocked because one screw refused to hold, the faint odor of soap clinging to her fingers. Nothing was amiss, and yet a quiet dissatisfaction settled in her chest, exact and persistent, like a stone placed there on purpose. She reviewed her day with the same care she once gave to letters—each gesture, each word weighed, found neither wrong nor sufficient. Outside, a cart passed along the road, its wheels striking the ruts with mechanical patience. Life, she thought, was composed of such repetitions, precise and unyielding, and it was this very regularity—so complete, so reasonable—that made her feel, without drama or protest, the dull ache of wanting something she could not clearly name.

—

**7.**

I walk without purpose beyond witnessing.  
The path accepts my feet,  
mud yielding, then holding,  
as though it understands the brief contract  
between movement and belonging.  
A thrush calls once—  
not urgently—  
and the sound enters the air  
the way truth sometimes does:  
unadorned, sufficient.

Everywhere, persistence.  
The ferns unscroll their private mathematics,  
the stones remain faithful to gravity,  
the stream rehearses its argument with time  
and loses beautifully.  
Nothing here desires to be other  
than what it is.

I consider how rarely I allow myself  
such clarity—  
how often I complicate the simple fact  
of being alive  
with narratives of failure or ambition,  
as though existence required justification.  
Yet the trees, untroubled by metaphor,  
stand in their long attention,  
and the moss, lavish in its patience,  
offers no explanation at all.

By the time the sun has climbed  
enough to warm my hands,  
something loosens inside me—  
not joy exactly,  
but a steadier recognition:  
that life, when regarded closely,  
does not ask to be conquered or improved,  
only accompanied.

And so I leave the woods altered  
in the quietest way

Call me restless, then, for there are days when the very sight of the shore—solid, sensible, complacent—fills me with an unaccountable unease, as though the land itself were conspiring to confine the soul. On such days I find myself drawn, not by reason but by a deeper current, to the notion of the sea: that vast, breathing entity whose surface tells lies while its depths hoard truths too heavy for daylight. For the ocean is not merely water stretched to the horizon; it is a thinking thing, inscrutable and ancient, bearing upon its back the reflections of heaven while concealing beneath them the dark arithmetic of fate. To venture upon it is to consent to uncertainty, to place one’s small, stubborn will against a force that neither knows nor cares for names, and yet—strangely—it is there, amid the rolling immensities, that a man most clearly hears the echo of his own obsessions, magnified until they resemble destiny itself.",0,1766275882.0,RSbookclub,6,0.35,False

what helped (this is gonna sound dumb):

I started going to this coffee shop every morning for like 3 weeks. same one. just forced myself to say ""thanks"" to the barista and make eye contact. that's it at first.

week 2 I added ""how's your day going?"" felt awkward as fuck but I kept doing it.

by week 3 the barista started conversations with me first. sounds small but it like broke something in my brain. realized people aren't analyzing everything I say.

then I tried it at my gym. small talk with the front desk person. then random people between sets. gradually got less weird about it.

now I can actually have conversations at parties without wanting to die. still not perfect but way better than 6 months ago.

idk if this helps anyone but that gradual exposure thing really worked for me. don't try to go from 0 to 100 overnight, that's where I kept failing before.

Hi all I'm talking to this girl it's going slow.

I last saw her at work last Saturday. She actively swapped her work duties specifically so she could work in an enclosed space alone with me for the duration of the shift.
​During the shift, she shared specific romantic/sexual ""green lights,"" such as telling you which alcohol makes her feel ""sexual"".

​She shared significant personal details that she usually keeps private, including how much she earns and future plans. Past relationships and why she is how she is
​
After work, we both stayed 45 minutes to an hour later than everyone else to spend more time together
​Then she drove me home (a 15-minute trip from work and abt 30 mins to her house) and we spent the night stargazing and hugging until approximately 11 PM. saying things like she wishes that she could visit my area more and earlier in the day say that she would like to dirnk more with me if she wasn't driving.

She has told me that she is very antisocial cause of anxiety and depression that's why she has been single for so long,  so she takes forever to reply, I'm talking weeks sometimes. She said she does this to everyone so I just give her space. Her birthday is in 2 weeks and I'll be in her area, should I ask her out for a light coffee?

1prsn7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1prsn7a/looking_for_some_perspective_he_keeps_calling_our/,"Looking for some perspective - he keeps calling our situationship a friendship, and are these good signs?","I (20F) and he (40M) met while working together back in March and we connected almost instantly. However, to make a long story shorter, we hit a few bumps in July which were caused by my ill health and him making a poor decision to trust another, leading me to be forced to leave work and him to block me for two months.

Despite this small bump however, in Sept i reached out to him and we reconnected, first meeting up for a coffee, discussing what happened in July, working through it and becoming friends once again…

For around 6 weeks we continued our friendship, messaging every other day, making plans to meet up & occasionally calling and in early November he invited me to attend his Graduation - I gladly accepted his invite, however sadly again due to my own ill health, meant I had to leave his celebration early, which made me feel absolutely terrible, and so guilty as I felt i was letting him down on such an important day. So, the following day, still feeling really guilty and like I owed him an explanation, I reached out to him via message and we agreed to meet up and we did, 2 days later.

anyway, one thing lead to another, and we ended up confessing feelings - I admitted having feelings since May, and even went onto later tell him that I was in fact in love with him (which I very much still am), while he admitted having feelings since July, though said his feelings were not as deep as mine, as he does not yet love me, but does care for me.

He then said that we need to take things slowly (which I also agree with & is absolutely fine), and continue to be friends until we are able to further develop our bond, before re-evaluating our feelings. This is mainly because, he is also talking with another lady, though only via phone or video call, from back in his home country. He has known this lady for a few years, as friends and began connecting with her during the 2 months he had me blocked.

Things have been going well between us, we have kissed (very passionately), cuddled, held hands, hugged and had many laughs, open and deep, honest conversations and so far, though there have been some cultural clashes (he is Nigerian while I’m British), we have connected really well. We have discussed what we hope for in our futures, and our beliefs & values seem to align. We have also discussed children, religion, marriage values and agreed that trust, openess and honesty are core values and we must always discuss and work through any differences which we may encounter, without sleeping on them.

we have also made plans for New Year and he is extremely keen to make plans to meet my family in the coming few months. He has even gone as far as to buying one of my uncles, whom he has spoken on the phone with, a Christmas card & gift - a gesture I find very telling about his true nature, showing his kindness, thoughtfulness and respect for my family - people whom he has never even met before.

However, despite how well things we going between us, there is still the obvious elephant in the room...his indecision about whom he sees his future with. Presently, he till continues to call me his friend, though has since more recentl:

1. He doesnt think how we feel about each other is a “honeymoon” period, but rather our true, real feelings and connection for one another.
2. That we should continue to develop our bond & feelings for one another, and then we can build a future together.
3. That he needs to make sure his feelings are not lustful and that he is trying to fall in love with me, as he is not yet in love with me (which I completely understand takes time).
4. That he needs to slowly distance himself from the other lady, and connect more with me.
5. That he wishes we had met sooner, or that I had opened up about my feelings sooner as then he wouldn’t have connected with this other lady.

So, I think things between us are pointing in the right direction, though of course he is still up in the air and undecided…I do struggle to understand the concept of having feelings for two people at once, but admit I am young, slightly naive and have never been in his situation before so could probably not answer that statement accurately.

So, really I suppose I am looking for some perspective, as I don’t really have very many people in my personal life to ask for advice.

I should add, he treats me extremely well, I do not feel that there is a power/control imbalance or improper dynamic between us. I honestly do truly love, care for & respect this man, and do believe he truly does care for & respect me. Though, admittedly there have been a few times where I have felt he has, likely without realising, tried to talk down on me or has talked in a way reflective of the fact I am much younger than he is, which I realise may have happened due to our age difference and he does appear, again probably without realising, to be more abrupt/distant over messages and/or calls, compared as to when we are together in person, though this isn’t particularly something which concerns me too much. He always asks my permission/consent before we cuddle, kiss or anything of that sort and is very respectful of my boundaries. It’s just the few small things, and his indecision which worry me…but am I just worrying to much?

1prsn5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/coin/comments/1prsn5e/here_is_the_final_end_of_all_knowledges_on_the/,here is the final end of all knowledge's on the surface of the globe AKA the purpose of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",0,1766275693.0,coin,1,0.5,False

In a desperate effort to reclaim a little bit of my sanity and perhaps some money to not at all buy some more crap, I'm offloading hundreds of niche and designer perfume samples. Expect a scrolling nightmare of a list, packed with everything from obscure niches to your basic bitch designer hits. 

Since I'm about to list hundreds of tiny vials of liquid, a quick heads-up: fill levels are estimates. I'm doing my best, but I'm eyeballing this. So, if you get a sample that you're convinced has 1.2ml instead of the 1.3ml, please don't come to me crying about it. It's a sample. It's close enough. Manufacturers don't fill vials to the top, keep that in mind as well. 

Nearly everything is a spray, even the very small samples. There are some dabbers, but very little... all Armani are dabbers.

Oh, hey, L00K, SHINY, $1! I'm practically giving some of these away. We're talking one dollar for a sample. Scroll aaaaaaall the way down for $1 section. Those are the ones that are cheapies, have very little left (but always enough for at least 2 wears with reasonable application), or I find especially repugnant. Those are add-ons only, a minimum purchase of 3 from the main list is required.

1prsjv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1prsjv9/more_advice_you_deserve_it/,More advice ( you deserve it ),"so I used to literally freeze up when someone tried to talk to me at parties. like full panic mode.

what helped (this is gonna sound dumb):

I started going to this coffee shop every morning for like 3 weeks. same one. just forced myself to say ""thanks"" to the barista and make eye contact. that's it at first.

week 2 I added ""how's your day going?"" felt awkward as fuck but I kept doing it.

by week 3 the barista started conversations with me first. sounds small but it like broke something in my brain. realized people aren't analyzing everything I say.

then I tried it at my gym. small talk with the front desk person. then random people between sets. gradually got less weird about it.

now I can actually have conversations at parties without wanting to die. still not perfect but way better than 6 months ago.

idk if this helps anyone but that gradual exposure thing really worked for me. don't try to go from 0 to 100 overnight, that's where I kept failing before.

anyway yeah. hope someone finds this useful.",1,1766275417.0,socialskills,2,0.67,False

I have anbp and I'm 15f and I've ha it for 3 years but was only diagnosed a few months ago. I wasn't necessarily forced into recovery but it basically started when I had heart palpitations after drinking 4 cups of coffee at like 9pm and not having eaten earlier that day. 

anyways, I guess I'm really just wonder what is actually considereal recovery bc I dint feel like I actually am. 

not in the sense that I still stiggle but like, some days I actually do eat and resist purging but also most days (emphasis on most) I do exactly what I did before my mum found out (and my parents emotionally neglect and abuse me according to doctors and therapists, it's js not bad enough for anyone to do anything but that's not the point)

I had days where I acted fine even when nobody knew so I don't see how I'm getting better bc it's not like I even want to even though I kinda do.

I got my period for the first time in 8 months a couple weeks ago and it made me crash out istg and I'm exercising way more now. I'm still underweight but I don't have a healthy relationship with food and i don't think I ever will

AI and bots dominate and it is hard to tell if a coin has a real community.

This is where IRL efforts come in, they are the perfect example of **Proof Of Humanity,** these show that real people are putting their personal money and time on the line to grow the Kendu brand.

Here is our insane catalogue of over 20 IRL initiatives so far:

* Kendu Coffee
* Kendu Energy
* Kendu Merch
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation 
* Kendu Board Game
* Kendu Creator
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games
* Tattoos 
* Murals
* Kendu Entertainment
* KenduSTREET

* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice
* Kendu Radio Show
* Kendu Brilliance
* Kendu Unleashed
* KenduLuxe
* Kendu Football Team

**Today we are focusing on the Kendu Football Team**

On Sunday Kendu Football Team won 2-0 with ten men which is a great effort and shows the Kendu mentality

The history of this team is incredibly interesting, it was founded in 1971 under the name Club sportif des Portugais de Fontainebleau based in Fontainebleau, France and has a football legend in its history books...

As a child, Lilian Thuram played for the club from the ages of around 8-12 years old, he was key player for the french national team that won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, his side also won UEFA Euro 2000, and was in the runner-up squad for the 2006 World Cup!

The club has a strong Portuguese identity and community with Thuram saying""None of them wanted to play for the other two clubs in the town. They felt a bond with the Portuguese community in Fontainebleau. It was a bond we all shared because the Portuguese community brought an extraordinary festive atmosphere to the matches. The smell of sardines and grilled sausages filled the air; Portuguese flags flew high; songs were sung until everyone was exhausted. We were in Portugal, and I myself was Portuguese for a few hours.""

Without a doubt the club has great heritage!

**But the club still has great success today!**

Last year the club won the regional championship and got promoted a division!

1prsft8,https://www.reddit.com/r/corejerk/comments/1prsft8/do_not_seek_after_ultimate_perfection_of_life/,"do not seek after ultimate perfection of life, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Its not like smelling coffee and tasting coffee when we do. We talk about places by how the smell tasted. To me, my daughter's art room at school, the smell tastes like fruity pebbles. My garage tastes like leather. My parents house tastes like vanilla bourbon. Things like that. There are places that taste bad too, and we all have different tastes for these smells, but it has happened forever and I recently learned that this is not a ""normal"" thing lol. Usually the taste is at the back of our tongue to start, almost like we swallowed whatever the smell was, but it moves around our mouths too. We are also really sensitive to smells and can smell even extremely faint scents, and bad smells or overly sweet smells (to us) make all of us nauseous extremely easily because we taste it too. So.

Those are public pictures from the 2003 christmas party that was attended by Michael Jackson, Bill Clinton, and many other famous or power figures, such as Epstein, Trump, etc. These pictures would later be uploaded to gettyimages in 2010.

1prsbux,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1prsbux/looking_for_help_dialing_in_kalita_wave_recipe/,Looking for help dialing in kalita wave recipe,"Hey everyone,

My coffee setup for the past few years has been a steel kalita wave 185, a baratza encore, and a bonavita gooseneck kettle.  I’ve stumbled upon a few good cups, but I never approached it systematically and the majority of the time the coffee is drinkable but not good.  I was recently gifted a ceramic mino 185 and am spending a bit more effort finally trying to dial in something that tastes great.

I’ve decided to start with the coffee collective’s recipe of a 30s bloom and one slow circular pour to finish.  My ideal cup size is 300g so I’ve modified their dose to 19.2g to compensate.  I’ve got what I consider to be somewhat confusing results with different grind sizes so far, and I’m hoping for some opinions on what you’d try to modify next because the options at this point seem endless.

Regarding the beans I’m using Counter Culture Hologram about 3-4 weeks after roast date.

I know calibrations are different across encores (and I did change mine at one point but forgot where I set it), but here are the settings I’ve tried and the results I’ve had:

26: both bitter and sour, thin, astringent

24: some fruity notes but also slightly bitter 

22: nice body, smooth, faint bitterness and sourness, no fruitiness 

20: nice body, not bitter but faint sourness, no fruitiness 

18: definitely bitter, no fruitiness or pleasant flavors, not great.  Also, the coffee bed looked like smooth mud

18 seems too fine and 26 seems too course, but I didn’t really have any great cups in between them so what would you try next?",1,1766274793.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

1. We need to regulate what can be called luxury because this freaking ridiculous! Rental fee high as heck, but the walls are so thin god forbid my neighbor coughs. She can hear me out down my coffee mug. 

2. We should get that thing where you hit it against the walls to test if the walls are thin before renting out a place. 
Help: What is it called and does it exist? 

3. Need a vote: Should all start using apartmentratings to actually right detailed reviews so people can avoid renting there (not sure if it’s like Yelp or if landlords can have your review removed) OR should we start some type of database ourselves with this information

4. Back to ideas: we need to rate independent landlords. I see reviews for buildings sometimes, but none for independent landlords.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

“You said to gear up for the drop.”

“I meant, like, underwear and toothbrushes.”

""Captain, they're killing each other down there."" “Later,” Amos said, “when you’re wishing we had this stuff, I am going to be merciless in my mockery.... And then we’ll die.”

There are several machines currently available through Costco that I’d like to purchase due to their excellent return policy. I typically make soy mochas using medium-dark roast while my wife tends toward medium roasts.

Whatever I get needs to accommodate using preground coffee. Not ideal, I know. But I get my favorite decaf coffee from Costco at an amazing price (I can’t drink caffeinated for medical reasons 😔). If they offered it as whole beans, I would buy it and grind as needed but they don’t. The savings is significant compared to buying whole beans elsewhere. 

My wife uses whole beans, so I’m hoping to find a machine that doesn’t require a lot of prep work and can easily switch between using preground and whole bean coffee. 

Here are the models currently available at Costco within my budget:

De’Longhi Magnifica Evo: $479.99

Phillips 800: $439.99

Phillips 3200: $439.99

Ninja Luxe Cafe: $449.99

Bosch 300: $499.99

Do any of these stand out as a clear front runner? 

I’ll eventually upgrade to a nicer machine down the road but want to start off with a more budget friendly model for now while I get my bearings. Thanks for any insight. ",3,1766274307.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False
1prs5lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardenlearning/comments/1prs5lj/kitchen_scraps_series_turning_everyday_food_waste/,Kitchen Scraps Series: Turning Everyday Food Waste into Good Dirt,"If you cook meals at home, you’re already creating one of the most valuable resources for your garden: kitchen scraps. Instead of throwing them away, composting transforms everyday food waste into rich, living soil that feeds plants naturally.

This guide breaks down exactly what kitchen scraps you can compost, how to compost them properly, and common mistakes beginners make—so you can compost confidently from day one.

⸻

Why Kitchen Scraps Belong in the Compost Pile

Kitchen scraps are rich in nitrogen and moisture, both of which are essential for composting. When combined with carbon-rich materials like leaves or cardboard, food scraps help create heat, encourage beneficial microbes, and speed up decomposition.

Benefits of composting kitchen scraps include:

	•	Reducing household waste

	•	Creating free, nutrient-rich soil amendments

	•	Improving garden soil structure

	•	Supporting organic and chemical-free growing

	•	Closing the loop between kitchen and garden

⸻

What Kitchen Scraps Can Be Composted

Fruit Scraps

Fruit breaks down quickly and adds moisture and sugars that feed compost microbes.

Safe fruit scraps include:

	•	Apple cores and peels

	•	Banana peels

	•	Citrus peels (small amounts)

	•	Melon rinds (chopped)

	•	Berry scraps

	•	Stone fruit pits (slow to break down)

Tip: Chop large fruit scraps to speed decomposition and discourage pests.

⸻

Vegetable Scraps

Vegetable waste is one of the best compost inputs and works well for beginner piles.

Compostable vegetable scraps:

	•	Carrot tops and peels

	•	Onion skins and ends

	•	Garlic skins

	•	Lettuce and leafy greens

	•	Broccoli and cauliflower stems

	•	Squash and cucumber ends

	•	Potato peels (disease-free only)

Avoid: Diseased plant material or cooked vegetables with oil.

⸻

Coffee, Tea & Breakfast Scraps

These scraps are compost gold when used properly.

	•	Coffee grounds (considered “green” despite their color)

	•	Paper coffee filters

	•	Loose-leaf tea

	•	Paper tea bags (check for plastic mesh)

	•	Eggshells (rinsed and crushed)

Why eggshells matter: They add calcium and help prevent blossom end rot when compost is used in the garden.

⸻

Bread, Grains & Pantry Scraps (Use Sparingly)

These items can be composted but should be added in small amounts and buried well.

	•	Bread and toast

	•	Rice, pasta, oats (plain and unseasoned)

	•	Flour and grain dust

	•	Cracker crumbs

Important: These can attract rodents if left exposed. Always cover with browns.

⸻

Nut & Shell Scraps

	•	Peanut shells (unsalted)

	•	Walnut shells (crushed)

	•	Pistachio shells (unsalted)

These are slow to break down but add long-term structure to compost.

⸻

Kitchen Scraps You Should NOT Compost

Even though they come from the kitchen, some items cause odor, pests, or imbalance.

Do not compost:

	•	Meat, fish, or bones

	•	Dairy products

	•	Oils, grease, or fats

	•	Sauces, soups, or seasoned foods

	•	Moldy food (small amounts are fine, but avoid bulk)

⸻

How to Collect Kitchen Scraps the Right Way

Step 1: Use a Kitchen Scrap Container

	•	Small countertop bin with a lid

	•	Stainless steel or ceramic works best

	•	Empty every 1–3 days to prevent odors

Step 2: Prep Scraps for Composting

	•	Chop large items

	•	Drain excess liquid

	•	Crush eggshells

	•	Avoid adding hot food

⸻

Balancing Kitchen Scraps in the Compost Pile

Kitchen scraps are nitrogen-rich (greens) and must be balanced with carbon-rich materials.

For every bucket of kitchen scraps, add:

	•	Shredded cardboard

	•	Dry leaves

	•	Straw or hay

	•	Paper towels or egg cartons

Ideal ratio:

2–3 parts browns : 1 part kitchen scraps

This balance prevents smell and pests while speeding decomposition.

⸻

Preventing Odors, Pests & Common Problems

If your compost smells:

	•	Add more browns

	•	Turn the pile

	•	Reduce wet food scraps

If pests appear:

	•	Bury scraps deep in the pile

	•	Avoid bread and grains

	•	Use a covered bin or tumbler

If scraps aren’t breaking down:

	•	Chop scraps smaller

	•	Increase moisture slightly

	•	Add more greens or turn more often

⸻

Indoor & Small-Space Options

If you don’t have outdoor space:

	•	Vermicomposting (worms) works well for kitchen scraps

	•	Bokashi composting handles cooked foods indoors

	•	Freeze scraps until compost day

⸻

Final Thoughts

Kitchen scraps are one of the easiest ways to start composting and building healthy soil naturally. With the right balance and a little consistency, what once went into the trash becomes a powerful resource for your garden and homestead.

Since this is an expansion out of Vanilla Romance's debut last year, the packaging is now for a set and all three are kind of in the same design with some slight differences like coffee/cream look in Vanilla Cafe and the lavender added in Vanilla Ease.  Though all three share the opaque bottles and golden atomizers too.  

**The Scents:**

* **Vanilla Romance** (Fresh Cardamom, Vanilla Absolute, Captivating Woods) - After its debut last year and the fact that it stayed online (and maybe in stores?) for the year and was made to be the focus again for this collection, Vanilla Romance is still pretty decent as a vanilla scent, though I still think at times it reminds me of Bonfire Bash with the smokiness, but then the spiciness of the cardamom appears and I also get the woods too.  It's a pretty sweet-smelling scent and feels very to the point to me.
* **Vanilla Cafe** (Smooth Espresso, Whipped Vanilla, Toasted Hazelnut) - So if you want to know my FAVORITE of the new scents introduced this year, that award is definitely given to Vanilla Cafe because it is literally a spot-on coffee scent, even more than I think Vanilla Mocha Cafe/Martini/Cream where this is more rich and deep while the aforementioned has a slight floral tone to it.  This is just gourmand+ and I was really loving this hard and is in my top 20 scents.
* **Vanilla Ease** (Lavender Blossoms, Creamy Vanilla, Soft Cedarwood) - So I have been on this dislike this year over lavender + vanilla scents because we've had a LOT of them in the last few years and I'm just like changing one minor note is not enough to really make me like them and this one, yeah the vanilla is a bit stronger so the scent is overall on the sweeter end of things, but at the end of the day, it didn't really impress me much.

**Overall: (8/10)** \- Surprised to see that the Vanilla line get expanded especially since Vanilla Romance lasted in stores longer than expected for a Signature scent.  Though it was great that Vanilla Cafe came out of this and really helped this set out unlike Vanilla Ease which kind of just bored me and is what brought the rating down a bit.

Next is the main set released for Fall 1 and it's kind of traditions (though shockingly Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte was not brought in AT ALL this year).  Though we did get Champagne Apple & Honey and Sweater Weather here, two new scents in Glazed Pumpkin & Book Loft and then Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin once again relegated to being online exclusive!  

**Packaging:**

As the new scents are what we're looking at, the packaging is VERY Fall-like which makes for a really good looking collection.  I do enjoy the envolope wax print of the middle and since the other three scents are colored differently (CA&H was Red, Sweater Weather was Blue and Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin was... well close to the same color as Glazed Pumpkin oddly enough.  Visually 4 of the 5 are the warm colors while Sweater Weather is of course cool colors which is kind of the oddball in the collection.  Still, it's nice and actually I notice Book Loft two with the lighter colors.

**The Scents:**

* **Champagne Apple & Honey** (Pink Lady Apple, Sparkling Champagne, Jasmine Honey, Autumn Woods) - Yup, it's back to something we always see out of Bath & Body Works here.  Champagne Apple & Honey is a pretty unique apple scent since it doesn't quite smell shampoo-like and it has a light sparkling effervescence about it.  It's a nice fruity, sweet scent with a little woody background.  
* **Sweater Weather** (Sun-Crisped Apple, Autumn Leaves, Orchard Woods) - I guess we're back to Sweater Weather coming out for Fall (since last year it was a Winter released scent).  Unlike the sweet apple scent from the previous scent, Sweater Weather feels a bit more unisex and maybe a little masculine at times.  The scent smells pretty airy and cold, but a smidge sweet from the apple note.  Still feels totally different from CA&H.  
* **Glazed Pumpkin** (Vanilla Glaze, Caramel Woods, Pumpkin Cream) - We dropped Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte for a new scent with Glazed Pumpkin and this feels kind of similar to last year's Pumpkin Swirl Cake but this is without the toffee note and kind of focuses more of the spices of the scent which is really what it came off as.  I do get the vanilla glaze on drydown and nice richness to the scent.  This was nice though, but I think I ended up liking last year's scent a bit more.
* **Book Loft** (Crisp Bergamot, Neroli, Cozy Woods) - As a sort of new scent (it's been in other home products before becoming body care, this was kind of a surprising scent for this collection because it doesn't really have any gourmand/fruit elements to it.  I really like the scent, though I do question whether it makes for a good body care scent because it smells like it's better as its candle/wallflower because of the woodiness and light citrus elements.
* **Sweet Cinnamon Pumpkin** (Heirloom Pumpkin, Autumn Cinnamon, Ginger Snap, Whipped Vanilla) - Yeah once again an online exclusive, it at least continues to be around for people to collect.  It's your potpourri/spicy pumpkin scent here with a HEAVY lean on the ginger snap and cinnamon more than anything else in the scent notes.  I still think it's a very powerful scent to have, but it can easily be too much to handle so for me it's used in colder weather.

**Overall: (8/10)** \- While most of this collection is returning scents that are just annually here each year (once again...no Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte?!?)  This was a solid group and was made a bit better with both Glazed Pumpkin and Book Loft being introduced.  I do think that Book Loft is the oddball scent because it's not fruity or gourmand like the rest, but this was a good set overall this year.

https://preview.redd.it/qu1t58clie8g1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=65708f083e6f1fa3363b26abc36e27241632f1cb

Fall 2 drops and we get 4 new Everyday Luxuries (which I've already reviewed for the year and is in the proper post linked above) and we got this collection which is kind of like a more recent grouping.  However we're once again stuck with Autumn Drive and Sunrise Woods again, but we dropped Together Weather for a pseudo new scent in Whipped Honey & Vanilla which was probably the main excitement from this scent.

**Packaging:**

Since we have just Whipped Honey & Vanilla to look at the design is pretty to the season I would say with Autumn Drive having a darker red and Sunrise Woods having a golden yellow color going on.  They all have their own little leafy pictures around it and it has this rustic, classic look to it.  Not the most exciting but fitting for the Fall.

**The Scents:**

* **Autumn Drive** (Wild Raspberry, Warm Amber, White Birch) - Yes, we're here again with Autumn Drive which has always felt a little weird because this smells a LOT like Buttercups & Berry Spritz, though a smidge warmer thanks to both the amber and woods.  Outside of that is a pretty strong raspberry note going and giving the scent its fruity splash.  It's decent, but we've had a lot of raspberry scents this year and this one just kind of flew over my radar, mostly because we've had this one last year.
* **Whipped Honey & Vanilla** (Honey Drizzle, Blossoming Neroli, Whipped Vanilla Bean) - As our so-called new scent, this one (like Book Loft) was known more for the candle and wallflower (and I think soap?) before it became a body care scent and its been hinted at since last year I believe?  It's also becoming apparent to me that we did have quite a lot of vanilla scents in the year and this one is kind of very close to being a little more forgettable, but considering this set, at least it's a strong gourmand scent here.  Not sure what note makes it smell more sugary, but it's got a nice brown sugar feel to it and yeah clear favorite of the three here.
* **Sunrise Woods** (Creamy Sandalwood, Sweet Berries, Cozy Cashmere) - Once again, we're here with Sunrise Woods and I've mentioned it before that this scent kind of switches fields in the years we've had it.  For me this year, I actually enjoyed it as it brought that cozy cashmere in to make it feel so comfy like blankets and the sandalwood is felt pretty well despite not smelling much of the berries here.  

**Overall: (7/10)** \- Gets a bit of a lower score because like the Valentine's collection it's more or less the same as last year's collection though took out Together Weather and replaced it with Whipped Honey & Vanilla which was the reason it didn't get the 6 out of 10.  While I get it, I think I'm kind of bored of this set and should just move to the main Fall collection.

https://preview.redd.it/ubjptpq8uf8g1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6859a15ae7ddca6ec1e5cbd70c6085777338676

While it wasn't quite Fall 2 nor Fall 3, we did get a randomly dropped Members Appreciation day set in the in-between, but it was just a small returning set here.  While we have seen Cucumber Melon (way too much) and Plumeria (2 years ago), we did get to see an old scent return in the form of Country Apple.

**Packaging:**

https://preview.redd.it/lusqkdmluf8g1.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d5fa3a638e7098eb57bc231402c1a840c02735f

For being just a smell returning set, I kind of like the packaging for them?  I like that the writing is cute and the pictures are quite connected to the scent itself.  Simple, but nice design here.

**The Scents:**

* **Cucumber Melon** (Crisp Cucumber, Watery Honeydew, Summer Cantaloupe, Sparkling Grapefruit, Sheer Woods) - Ugh, we JUST had this scent back during Summer SAS and hasn't been long enough of a break to really bring it back, B&BW quit pushing this scent at us and just toss it in the Permanent Collection JFC.  Scent isn't even that great anymore...
* **Plumeria** (Pink Plumeria, Peach Nectar, Red Apple, Night-Blooming Jasmine, Gardenia Petals) - Nah, this one is still kind of stinky to me for some reason.  Yeah, not sure what it is with this one that smells kind of rancid on me, but it's a tough scent for me to enjoy.  I'm wondering if it's perhaps the actual plumeria mixed with the peach nectar that gives me that kind of skunky scent, but damn this might be even worse than last year...could drop all the way as my least favorite scent out of B&BW...
* **Country Apple** (Apple Blossom, Fresh Muguet, Sheer Sunlight, Orchard Woods) - Yeah this might be the only decent scent in this collection.  It's been a hot minute since we've seen Country Apple (like maybe 2021?).  Taking a whiff, the scent is good if not a tad bit light for me and while I love the apple-centric scent profile, many other apple scents did better and are much stronger scents.

**Overall: (4/10)** \- Probably the worst collection of the year if I had to be truly honest here.  I already was tired of seeing Cucumber Melon and Plumeria is just nasty to me.  Country Apple though is the only reason this set is not a 2 to be honest though it is a weaker scent amongst other apple scents B&BW have put out.  Is this really ""appreciation?""

https://preview.redd.it/c6bor09dzf8g1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc1991cffec66a93e0480274862c960b1fef1b51

Guess this was a double release because it was technically Fall 3 (but also Halloween Pt. 2 and was also considered the partnered release of the Princess' collection back in Spring 2).  This was a little oddly dropped and it quickly kind of went away as it felt like it wasn't as praised upon like the Princess' collection was.  Though we have two scents in Evil Queen and Maleficent.  

**Packaging:**

I found it pretty interesting that the two scents have completely different bottle designs to one another.  Evil Queen feels a bit more formal looking with the Evil Queen holding the album as the main image to a purple wrap-around while Maleficent has the mirror, the crow and a tufted wrap-around like dragon scales almost.  Interesting, but makes no sense really after the sister set had similar packaging to one another.

**The Scents:**

* **Evil Queen** (Dark Red Apple, Vanilla Suede, Wicked Pear) - Yeah coming back to this has once again made me realize we had a lot of apple scents this year as well and luckily compared to Country Apple from the previous set, this is much stronger and deeper than I was expecting.  It also smells pretty unique with the vanilla suede involved giving it a bit of roundness.  The pear...not sure, maybe the freshness perhaps?  
* **Maleficent** (Sinister Plum, Midnight Berries, Mystical Woods) - On the other hand, we had Maleficent and immediately my nose said it smells like a mix of Into the Night and Black Amethyst for some reason (and as of Winter, also a little of A Toast to You).  It's dark, sexy, has a deepness from the plum and the bite of the woods as well.  It's much more memorable to me than Evil Queen though.

**Overall: (6/10)** \- Really?  They couldn't think of 4 other Villains to give scents to?  I felt like this release was very ho-hum and kind of quickly left behind if I remember correctly.  I think after the Princess' earlier in the year kind of ruined it here because only having two scents was not going to pull people in.  Though I'm not surprised since neither scent fully stood out and kind of smelled like other scents they've done.  Like we could've gotten an Ursula, Yzma, Cruella...SO MUCH POTENTIAL LOST!!!

==========================================

  
So there ya have it, Fall was pretty meh if I had to be honest.  Some Fall staples were surprisingly missing (Marshmallow Pumpkin Latte and Sweet Whiskey), there wasn't even a Signature Collection scent for the season either which is rather shocking to me.  Throw in some rather disappointing collections and a few worthwhile scents, I'd say Fall was the worst quarter of this year.",2,1766274063.0,bathandbodyworks,2,0.6,False

1prs22v,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_jim21869/comments/1prs22v/friends_and_family_chapter_7_part_2/,"Friends and Family (Chapter 7, Part 2)","Third grade seemed to be a big deal to Jim.  This year, Jim learned cursive writing, American History, multiplication, division, and the solar system.  By Christmas, he knew all the state capitals. 

That Christmas, Uncle Bob Claiborne was unable to make his annual Christmas visit to the Faulkner house.  He was up to his neck in business affairs in Myrtle Beach.  Wendy and Jim did not go to the beach in the summer of 1977.  But come next summer, Wendy would make up for it.   Jim didn’t get very much for Christmas, nor did he want a lot.  He got a few train cars for his model train, a few toy cars, a Monopoly game, and a few clothes.  The biggest thing Jim got was a race set, which he enjoyed playing with.  Since Christmas fell on a Sunday that year (for the only time that decade), Wendy and Jim attended church.  The service wasn’t much to write home about, just a few songs and a small Christmas play.  But to add insult to injury, the church’s heater went out.  The temperature that rainy Sunday morning was around freezing.  The temperature inside the church was just as bad, if not worse.  During the course of that week, some of the church’s members started getting sick with a cold or the flu.  Wendy and Jim did have Christmas dinner with the Holbrooks.  Jim didn’t have much appetite, but he did enjoy some ham, mashed potatoes and salad.  The Cavanaughs were also in attendance.  Jim enjoyed the company of the kids of both the Holbrook and Cavanaugh families.

 

😊

 

By the end of the first week of 1978, things went from bad to worse.  Wendy lost her job at Eckerd Drugs.  She got another job at a steakhouse on East Independence Boulevard.  She would hold that job until that fall.

But Wendy also had another problem.  Thanks to the church not having any heat for Christmas of 1977 and New Year’s Day of 1978 (both fell on a Sunday), Jim got the flu!  Jim spent a week and a half out of school.  That first weekend of 1978, Jim threw up a lot.  He burned up in fever one minute and shivered in chills the next.  He pushed down glass after glass of orange juice.  He spent that time out of school inside, and it really did not matter to him because it rained almost every day.  Audrey stayed with Jim at his house while Wendy was at work.  She did fear she would get the flu just by being around Jim.  She didn’t.

Jim returned to school after a week and a half.  The weather finally cleared up when he returned to school.  Once again, he was able to play with his friends.

Spring came and went.  Summer vacation came, and with it came the end of Jim’s third grade year.  That July, Wendy took Jim to Myrtle Beach.  The two did some fishing, swam in the ocean, and Jim played his very first game of miniature golf. 

Back in Charlotte, Jim continued to play with his friends.  One Saturday afternoon not long before school started, Wendy spoke to Jim.  She said to him, “Jim, I know you are very nice to everyone and you care about your friends, especially Malachi, Julie and April Lynn.”

“Mom, I’m always nice to my friends.  What’s all this leading up to?”

“Jim, there’s something you need to know.  You just may want to be extra nice to the Holbrook kids.”

“Why?  Are Luke or Audrey sick?”

Right then, Jim became concerned.  He thought if either one of them were seriously ill or were close to death, it would not only devastate the Holbrooks, but him as well.  But Wendy put Jim’s fears to rest.  She said, “No, Jim.  Nothing like that.  I just found out today.  Audrey’s gonna have a baby.”

Jim said, “Wow!  That’s nice.  But I wonder how Malachi, Julie and April Lynn are gonna handle that.”

Wendy said, “I’m sure they’ll handle it just great.”

“I hope they can.  I’ll be nice to them.  I always am.”

“I know you will, Jim.”

Wendy left Jim alone in his room.  He looked out the window.  He thought about the changes that were about to take place in the neighborhood.  Jim was changing himself.  Now at the age of nine, Jim had a better understanding about things.  He seemed to be learning more and more.  He did have a question in his mind.  *Where do babies come from?*  Hearing the news about Audrey’s pregnancy made him ponder that thought.  Jim may have been nine, but he knew he would be learning stuff like that sooner or later.  He thought about going ahead and asking Wendy.  Maybe she would answer it in a way that made sense, or maybe she would leave Jim hanging for a year or more.  So Jim felt it best to just hold off asking that question, but he would ask it, eventually.

Later that evening, Jim did ask Wendy another question.  “When will that new baby arrive?”

Wendy smiled at Jim and said, “Not at least until next spring.  Audrey will be carrying that baby around for nine months.”

“That long, huh?”

Wendy looked at Jim for a moment.  She could tell something was on his mind.  “Okay, Jim.  I take it you wanna know.”

“Know what?” Jim asked.

“About babies.  Where they come from, how they’re made, those things.”

Jim said, “I thought about it after you told me about Audrey.  I did want to ask.  But then I figured I better wait.  If I asked now, you probably wouldn’t give me an answer that made sense.”

“Try me.”

“I don’t know, Mom.  I’m only nine years old.  I feel I have time to learn about that stuff.”

Then Wendy said, “Jim, my parents sat me down and told me about baby-making when I was about your age.  They didn’t hide anything from me, either.  It seemed like they told me everything, chapter and verse.  When it was all over, I had a total understanding of where babies come from.”

Jim thought about it for a moment.  He knew he was going to hear stuff like that sooner or later.  He did ask Wendy, “Do they teach stuff like that in fourth grade?”

“Jim, I’m not sure, but it is possible.  If you feel you are ready to know, and when you are ready, you can ask me at any time.  No big deal.  Understood?”

Jim answered, “Yes, Mom.  And I will ask you soon.”

Jim went back to his room and got ready for bed.  As he lied down on the bed and stared at the ceiling, he thought about some things.  *Okay, Jim.  Here’s the rundown.  You have a lot of friends.  Three of them are about to be big siblings.  There will be some changes.  But they may be good changes.  A few years from now, that new baby of the Holbrook family will be old enough to play with you.  But even before that, you and that baby will be the best of friends, just like you are to those kids you play with now.  Jim, you may only be nine years old, but you really can and should begin planning for your future.  You know it’s coming whether you want it or not.  And about this jazz about making babies, you better bring up that subject with your mother…soon!   Don’t wait until you hear about it on the streets of this great city of Charlotte, North Carolina.  Don’t wait and find out about it the hard way, like many have been known to do.  Oh yeah.  One more thing.  You may already be a big brother yourself.  There are rumors floating around that your biological father is still living in the Charlotte area, working at a Mercedes-Benz dealership.  And something else.  He has a daughter about three years younger than you.  You better find out about that soon.  And one more thing.  When are you going to find a girlfriend?*

True, there were rumors floating around about Walter Faulkner.  Most of the rumors came from Bethany Church.  And some even came from Autumn Cavanaugh.  Somehow, Autumn found out about Jim’s biological father.  Walter and Wendy Faulkner.  Divorced for the past seven years, and now this comes up.  Jim did hear some of those rumors.  When he found out about them, he had a good mind to ask Wendy about his father.  But he thought better of it, at least for now anyway.  The last thing he wanted to do was to upset his mother.  He would ask.  But right now, the first person he would ask would be Autumn.  For now, that would be a secret that would have to be kept from Wendy, at least that was what Jim thought.  But he would tell his mother about the rumors eventually.  Maybe she wouldn’t be upset.  And again, Jim knew this.  Sooner or later, Wendy would have to make the time to tell her beloved son about his father.

As for the girlfriend, Jim never had one yet.  But the answer to that question would come to him one day in the fall of 1978.

 

😊

 

Wendy had a couple days off from work at the steakhouse.  She would soon be trying to find more suitable work.  Wendy offered to drive Audrey to a doctor’s office on Elizabeth Avenue.  Wendy took Jim with her, and Malachi and April Lynn also joined them.  Julie was at the gas station helping Luke.  Wendy parked her Camaro in the parking lot, and the five went into the building.  Wendy agreed to join Audrey in the doctor’s office while the kids waited for them in the waiting room.  Wendy gave them enough change to get them a can of juice and a pack of crackers from the vending machines in the waiting room.  Jim read the latest issue of *Motor Trend*.  This month’s issue went into detail about the newly redesigned 1979 Pontiac Firebird.  April Lynn just sat in a chair and watched the passing traffic on Elizabeth Avenue.  Malachi also read a car magazine, that month’s issue of *Road and Track*.  When Jim and Malachi got through with the magazines they were reading, they simply swapped.

A girl of around nine years old stepped into the waiting room.  She said, “Hi, Malachi.”

Malachi said, “Hi.  What are you doing here?”

The girl answered, “My Mom’s sick and she’s here to see the doctor.”

Malachi said, “Oh, I see.”

Jim was still into that copy of *Road and Track*, not paying any attention to what was going on.  April Lynn wasn’t paying any attention, either.  The girl got a look at Jim.  She asked him, “Aren’t you in Miss Bentley’s class?”

Jim said, “Yes, I am.”

The girl said, “I thought I saw you around school.  Malachi and I are in Mrs. Middlebrooks’ class.”

Jim nodded.  Then the girl sat down beside him. 

The girl’s name was Mindy Birdsong.  *What a beautiful name*, Jim thought.  Mindy was originally from Chicago.  Her father died when she was young, and her mother wanted to move to another part of the country to start a new life for her and her daughter.  For some reason, Mindy’s mother chose Charlotte.  Mindy’s mother’s first name was Mia.  Right now, she was working two part-time jobs in Charlotte.  One was at the Sunbeam Bread Store.  The other was as a desk clerk at a Holiday Inn near the airport. 

Right away, it seemed like Mindy was quite interested in Jim.  She began to ask him a lot of questions.  The first one, “Have you lived here long?”

“Yes.  My entire life.”

Then Mindy asked, “You read car magazines a lot?”

“Yes, I do.  I really do enjoy them.”

The next question from Mindy, “Do you have any other hobbies?”

Jim answered, “I do fish, play golf some, I also play guitar, watch some TV, listen to music, and I also like model trains.”

“What kind of music do you like?”

“I’m more of the top 40 and jazz variety.  But I listen to whatever I’m in the mood for.  I do like easy listening and some country.”

Right then, Malachi and April Lynn looked at Mindy, probably wishing she would just shut up.  At this point of his life, Malachi was not sure if he was ready for a girlfriend.  Jim felt he was ready.  Maybe the questions Mindy was asking were leading up to something.  Could she be a potential girlfriend?  Maybe.  

Wendy stepped out of the office and into the waiting room.  She asked the kids, “How’s things going out here?”

Malachi answered, “Wendy, I guess we could say it’s going well.”

Then Wendy said, “I see you all made a new friend.”

Malachi said, “She’s been asking Jim a lot of questions.”

Wendy got a look at Jim and Mindy.  Then she said, “I guess it would be safe to say Jim has acquired his first girlfriend.”

“Maybe,” Malachi said.

April Lynn continued to look out the window and watch the traffic going up and down busy Elizabeth Avenue.  Even at the age of four, April Lynn figured out what it meant to have a crush on someone.  And at this point, she had a crush on Jim, as did her older sister Julie. 

Wendy said, “Jim, it’s okay.  I guess you are at that age now.”

Then Jim said, “Mom, I haven’t even asked her yet to be my girlfriend.”

Then Mindy said, “Don’t worry, Jim.  I don’t think I could have done it without your mother’s help.  How about it, Jim?  Do you want to be my boyfriend?”

Jim thought about it for a moment.  A thought went racing through his mind.  *Jim Faulkner!  It’s time.  Like Mom said, you are at that age when you can and should have a girlfriend.  And try to remember, Mindy Birdsong just moved to Charlotte from Chicago.  You’ve never been in the situation she’s in now, but you could figure out how hard it can be to adjust to life in a new city.  She needs friends.  You could be a start.  So what are you waiting for?  Just do it!  Say yes and be her boyfriend.*

Mindy said, “It’s okay, Jim.  I could ask Malachi.”

Right then, Malachi said, “No!  I don’t want a girlfriend right now.”

Then Jim said, “Yes, Mindy.  I suppose I could be your girlfriend.”

Right then, Mindy gave Jim a kiss on the cheek.  Mindy was dressed pretty, wearing a pink dress and black dress shoes.  Mindy had brown hair that went down past her neck.  April Lynn gave Jim a rather strange look.  Jim looked at her, and he said, “Don’t worry, April Lynn.  You’re only four years old.  Your time will come.”

Then Mindy asked Malachi, “Is April Lynn your sister?”

“Yes.  I also have another sister and her name’s Julie.”

“Oh, yes.  I’ve seen Julie Holbrook.  She and April Lynn are both pretty.”

Even at age four, April Lynn had manners.  She said, “Thank you, Mindy.”

Mindy got up and walked to where April Lynn was sitting.  April Lynn was dressed pretty herself, wearing a cute light purple dress with a lot of lace and ruffles.  Mindy asked her, “April Lynn, did you have a crush on Jim?”

April Lynn said, “Yes.”

Then Mindy said, “Don’t worry, April Lynn.  You have a lot of time, and I’m sure some cute boy will want to be yours, when you’re older.”

April Lynn looked at Mindy, and she gave her a smile.  Mindy stuck out her hand, and then she asked her, “Are you and I still friends?”

April Lynn did not say anything.  But she did give Mindy a smile.  The two shook hands, and it seemed like things were okay between them.  Then, Mindy’s mother, Mia Birdsong, stepped into the waiting room.  Mia looked to be the same age as Wendy.  Mia, like Mindy, had brown hair and brown eyes.  Jim had been in the Sunbeam Bread Store on East Morehead Street about a hundred times since it opened.  He could not remember if he saw Mia at any given time.  Mia said, “Hi, Mindy.  I see you made some new friends.”

Mindy said, “Yes, Mom.  I did.  Malachi Holbrook’s in my class.  That’s his sister, April Lynn.  And this here is Jim Faulkner, Malachi and April Lynn’s friend.”

“We live in the same neighborhood,” Jim said.

“What neighborhood would that be?” Mia asked.

Wendy answered that question.  “We live in Dilworth.  We live on Bethany Street.  That’s within walking distance of the Sunbeam Bread Store.”

“I know.  I work there,” Mia said.

Then Wendy asked, “What did you say your name was?”

“Mia Birdsong.”

Wendy said, “Okay.  Glad to know you.”

“Is Jim your son?” Mia asked Wendy.

Wendy put her arm around Jim and answered, “I’m proud to say he is.”

“He sure is a handsome young man,” Mia said.

“Thanks,” Jim said.

Then Wendy said, “Mia, in our neighborhood, we like to be on a first-name basis.  The kids still call their parents Mom or Dad.  But even we like the kids to call the adults in the neighborhood by their first names.”

Mia said, “Okay, Wendy.  I see.”

Then Wendy asked, “Mia, do you suppose you could allow us to be on that same first-name basis?”

Mia happily agreed.  And with that, everyone became good friends.  Jim got his first girlfriend.  Malachi and April Lynn (and soon Julie) gained a new friend.  How long would Jim hold on to Mindy?  That would remain to be seen.

Audrey stepped into the waiting room.  Audrey and Mia met each other.  Wendy said, “Audrey, Mia agreed to be on a first-name basis.”

Audrey said, “Sounds good to me.”

Malachi said, “Mom, Mindy’s in my class.  And she and April Lynn just became friends.”

Then Jim said, “And Mindy just became my girlfriend.”

Audrey said, “Okay.  I see a lot happened while I was back in the office.”

Everyone left the office.  On the way home, Wendy asked Jim, “How does it feel to have a girlfriend?”

Jim said, “Mom, I guess it feels great.”

“Sure, Jim.  You’ll have a lot of fun with her.”

“Yes, Mom.  I do like to have fun.  I do spend a lot of time at home.  And believe me, trying to get a clear picture on Channel 36 is not my idea of having fun.”

Audrey just laughed at what Jim said.  Then she said, “Jim, you are absolutely right about that!”

Wendy arrived at the Holbrook house.  She dropped off Audrey and her kids.  Wendy then drove to the Faulkner house.  That evening, Wendy made hot dogs for dinner.  Jim made two for himself.  One all the way with chili, mustard, ketchup, slaw and onions.  The other had chili, onions, mustard and Jim also put some Texas Pete Hot Sauce on it.  They ate potato chips with their hot dogs. 

After he ate, Jim went up to his room.  He turned on the radio and played some rock music.  That night, he seemed to be pleased with himself.  As he watched the lights of the Charlotte skyscrapers come on, he thought about something.  He knew the future was coming whether he or anyone else wanted it or not.  It was now November of 1978.  In about fourteen months, the seventies would come to an end and everyone would be entering the eighties.  Would Jim and Mindy be together forever?  Maybe, or maybe not.  Jim was only nine, and so was Mindy.  Even if they did break up, at least he gained some knowledge on boyfriend and girlfriend relationships, and what they were about. 

That same month, Wendy quit her job at the steakhouse.  She got herself a better job.  She started working at a place called Charlotte Produce Company, a produce warehouse on the west side of Charlotte.  It was a full-time job and the pay was good, and it was in the mornings and early afternoons, allowing her to spend evenings with Jim, unless she had to work late, which she would only do occasionally.

Christmas of 1978 saw Jim get a small color TV for his room, a better train set, more toy cars, and a better guitar.  Autumn Cavanaugh hosted Christmas dinner that year.  That year, Mia and Mindy spent their first Christmas in the neighborhood.  Jim and Mindy seemed to enjoy each other’s company.

 

😊

 

It was now 1979.  Wendy and Jim did their best to make the Holbrook kids feel comfortable, with a new addition to the family soon coming.  Wendy would take Jim and the Holbrook kids out for some fun on a Friday or Saturday evening.  Usually, they would go hang out at Eastland Mall, and they would go to the ice-skating rink situated in the mall.  Sometimes, they would go to a roller-skating rink on East Independence Boulevard or South Boulevard, or they would go to a bowling alley for some bowling.  They would even go with Wendy to a discotheque on East Independence, one that catered to families with children.  Some evenings, the Holbrook kids would not be able to go.  Occasionally, Wendy and Jim would take another family in the neighborhood with them.  Sometimes, it was the Cavanaugh kids.  Usually, Autumn would join them.

April of 1979 saw two big events take place in the neighborhood.  First, Wendy felt it was time to get herself a new car.  She bought a new 1979 Chevrolet Caprice.

About a week after Wendy got her new car, Audrey gave birth to a baby girl.  She decided to call her Ashley Renee Holbrook. 

On Mother’s Day, Wendy did not feel well.  Jim wanted to give Wendy a Mother’s Day she would remember, but she spent the day in bed.  They did not go to church that Sunday.  Jim wanted to give her breakfast in bed, but she had no appetite.  Jim made Wendy eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns.  But he ended up eating that breakfast himself.

Jim stayed home all day that Sunday.  He did get to see the Cavanaugh bunch sing on TV.  Alex and Sydney were wearing tank tops and shorts.  Mark and Simon were wearing polo shirts and shorts.  A few days before, Malachi told Jim something.  *Alex and Sydney Cavanaugh sure do look pretty in shorts*.  Jim agreed.

The next day, Autumn picked Jim up from school early, before he even ate lunch.  She told him she had to take Wendy to the hospital.  It turned out she had suffered appendicitis and needed surgery at once.

Before she left the hospital, Wendy gave Jim a key to the house.  She felt it was time for Jim to be home alone instead of being baby-sat.  For the next few days, Jim ended up fending for himself.  He ate.  Not perfect, but well.  He did eat cans of Chef Boyardee and some TV dinners, usually fried chicken.  One night, he made him a pot of popcorn and watched *The Wizard of Oz* on TV. 

Jim had to stay out of school one morning when Wendy had her surgery.  Autumn drove him to the hospital.  Using his allowance money, Jim ate a small breakfast in the coffee shop, a chicken salad sandwich and a Coke.  Wendy got through her surgery and went home three days later. 

Wendy recovered and returned to work at Charlotte Produce Company the following week.  During the summer, Jim was not without his friends.  He played with the Cavanaugh and Holbrook kids, and he spent almost every day with Mindy.  Jim and Mindy did things boyfriends and girlfriends were known to do at that age (both were now ten).  They held hands, they kissed some, and they played together.  Jim and his friends hung out together to see a Fourth of July fireworks show, and they had one of the best times of their lives.  Wendy took Jim to Carowinds, a theme park near Charlotte that straddled the state line of both Carolinas.  Jim enjoyed riding the roller coasters.  That would become the first of many trips to the theme park to come.  One Saturday evening, Wendy took Jim and Mindy to a drive-in theater on Freedom Drive to see *Star Wars*.  Jim and Mindy each drank a large Coke, and they shared a big tub of buttered popcorn.  It was the best time they had.

Jim entered the fifth grade at Dilworth Elementary School that fall.  Also that fall, Jim went to a car race.  It was at a small drag strip on Highway 16 northwest of Charlotte.  Luke Holbrook was one of the drivers.  Luke didn’t win, but Jim enjoyed it, nonetheless. 

A pretty girl driver named Charity Donovan won, driving a 1962 Plymouth.  Jim met her a year earlier, just before he met Mindy.  Charity had a crush on Jim, despite being about seven years older than him.  But they were no more than friends.

The seventies wound down.  The decade turned out to be one of growth for Jim.  He learned a lot.  He made new friends.  He experienced new things.  He saw changes.  Jim knew the eighties would see even more.  He would learn more.  He would experience changes, and new things as well.  He would make even more new friends.  The eighties would turn out to be a great decade.",1,1766273984.0,u_jim21869,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

However, this beautiful piece for example, only the bottom is unglazed, the inside is glazed. I wanted to use it to warm my milk for coffees etc, but am wondering if it’s possible to put these types of pieces in the microwave? i want to understand the ins and outs of this glaze v unglazed.

Our itinerary was a 7 night Western Caribbean cruise, purchased for $610/person with a balcony. I’ll try to hit every base but I may miss a few things so I can answer questions if you have them.

The great:

The ship itself is beautiful. Everything is elegant and clean. The room and balcony were as expected, 0 complaints. The room was kept clean each day and we were provided clean towels consistently. The buffet food was great, a lot of choices and most of it was high quality. The employees were trained to keep everything as clean as possible. They heavily encourage hand washing before entering the buffet, with a greeter who holds a sanitizer bottle for your hands.

The outside of the ship was great too. I did the Seashore last year and I found it severely lacked pool space, but Grandiosa didn’t have this problem. Every time I wanted a hot tub, there was a spot for me. The pool was busy but you could always find a spot. Very ample seating in the main pool area. The small buffet outside was also a nice touch.

The okay: The entertainment was just okay. There wasn’t a lot of interesting shows, and the games we played were pretty unorganized. We tried playing a pickleball tournament but had to wait 30 minutes just to play one game and then wait again. Activities/quizzes were mediocre but the entertainment staff were great. The couples love game was the best and we laughed a lot. Overall, we found ourselves bored while on the ship, wanting to participate in some form of entertainment but it never really satisfied us. I’m sure other people found it just fine.

The bad: The MDR was extremely underwhelming. We only went twice since it wasn’t great after the first two times. We had to wait about 30 minutes for our order to be taken, and overall, it took about an hour and a half to get through the meal. I wouldn’t complain, but there wasn’t enough food to warrant the wait. The food was decent, but the portions were so small that we chose to do the buffet and get a quick bite instead of waiting in line and waiting for our food just for it to be about buffet quality and less portions.

Another bad experience was their decision to offer us Montego Bay excursions if they didn’t know they would even be ready by the time we got there. The night before our excursion, they left us a letter stating that our river tubing excursion was canceled due to technical reasons. The canceled almost everyone’s who didn’t go to Dunn’s River Falls or a few bus tours. A fellow cruiser informed me that MSC didn’t know if the excursions would be ready in time but they still decided to offer them. They offered us 10% off any other excursions but we had already gotten ours at pre cruise price. Also, Montego Bay sucks and I never want to visit again. It’s quite literally 10-15 shacks that sell souvenirs or coffee. If you don’t have an excursion it’s pointless to leave the ship

Overall, the ship itself was great an I would recommend it to anyone. I think MSC needs to smooth out the MDR and they shouldn’t have offered excursions in Montego Bay that were not ready, but I also knew it could happen since the hurricane hit. I’ll give the cruise an 8/10 but a value of 10/10. For a $600 balcony you can’t complain about much and I still had a wonderful time!",5,1766273390.0,Cruise,1,1.0,False

**SECONDARY OBJECTIVES**



# OFFICIAL LOGLINE

After the collapse of ISIS, a group of former operatives attempt to run a small, local private security outfit. Their jobs are simple. Their intentions are good. The outcomes are disastrous. Every contract is completed. Every reputation is destroyed.



# SERIES SYNOPSIS 

**Secondary Objectives** follows Pam Poovey, Cheryl Tunt, Cyril Figgis, and Dr. Algernop Krieger as they try to survive civilian life by doing the one thing they are uniquely qualified for and completely unsuited to explain: private security.

Operating locally and mostly unnoticed, the team takes on modest, legitimate jobs that should require little more than uniforms and restraint. Instead, each assignment spirals into public chaos, property damage, and moral ambiguity. Despite this, the job always gets done. The client is always protected. The fallout is always worse than the threat.

As the team struggles to stay afloat, a pattern emerges. The disruptions are no longer random. Someone is actively working to undermine them. What begins as isolated bad luck slowly reveals a coordinated effort to push them out of the city entirely.



# THE CORE IDEA

In an industry obsessed with efficiency, optics, and liability, this team is a liability that refuses to disappear.

They are competent.  
They are unnecessary.  
They are still here.



# SEASON ONE ARC (OVERVIEW)

Season One establishes the team through small, escalating security gigs that consistently end in public embarrassment and private success. Each episode appears self-contained, but subtle through-lines reveal recurring tactics, equipment, and interference.

By the end of the season, it becomes clear that a larger private security organization has identified the team as a disruptive variable and is actively working to eliminate them from the local market.

  
  
  
**INT. UPSCALE COFFEE SHOP – DAY**

The kind of coffee shop where nothing has a price tag and everyone looks vaguely disappointed to be alive.

**CHERYL TUNT** sits calmly.  
Too calmly.

**PAM POOVEY** watches her like she’s waiting for a trick knife.

**PAM**  
So you’re just… better now.

**CHERYL**  
Yes.

**PAM**  
Better like “manageable,” or better like “won’t set anything on fire”?

**CHERYL**  
Both. I’ve been in therapy. My therapist says I was mislabeling chronic sensation-seeking when it was really a dissociative boundary collapse with executive overcompensation.

Pam leans back. Squints.

**PAM**  
Well. Okay then.

**CHERYL**  
I have tools now. I regulate. I self-reflect.

**PAM**  
I don’t like that.

Cheryl smiles serenely and sips her coffee.

**CHERYL**  
Growth can be uncomfortable for others. My therapist says sarcasm is what happens when emotional literacy outpaces consent.

Pam opens her mouth to respond, stops, opens her mouth to respond  again.. and then freezes.

At that exact moment, **CYRIL FIGGIS** emerges from a back room wearing a coffee shop apron. He stops dead when he sees them.

Pam turns slowly.

**PAM**  
Is that… Cyril?

Cheryl turns, delighted.

**CHERYL**  
Oh my God. It is. Hi, Cyril.

They both wave. Cyril instinctively lowers his head like prey.

**PAM**  
Hey. Hey! Apron! Get over here.

Every patron in the shop turns to stare as Cyril reluctantly approaches.

**CYRIL**  
I work here.

**PAM**  
No shit. Why.

**CYRIL**  
Because no one will hire me.

**CHERYL**  
That seems unlikely.

**CYRIL**  
Every interview goes great until they ask about the ten years I can’t explain.

**PAM**  
You mean—

**CYRIL**  
Yes, Pam.

**CYRIL (CONT’D)**  
Those years are redacted. So it just looks like I voluntarily chose unemployment for a decade.

**CHERYL**  
You told people you were a defense attorney.

**CYRIL**  
I was.

**PAM**  
And an accountant.

**CYRIL**  
Also true.

**PAM**  
We all assumed you were lying.

**CYRIL**  
That’s incredibly hurtful.

**PAM**  
It sounded like lying. Still does, actually. But now it makes sense.

Cyril exhales. Defeated.

**CYRIL**  
Well… how are *you* two surviving?

**CHERYL**  
I’m rich.

Pam shrugs.

**PAM**  
Security.

**PAM**  
Sometimes. Sometimes I bounce. Sometimes I get bounced. Either way, I get paid.

Pam leans in.

**PAM (CONT’D)**  
Actually, I need people. Legit job. Good money. Simple.

**CYRIL**  
How simple?

**PAM**  
Important guy. Local. Security detail.

**CYRIL**  
Things never stay simple… back in the old days—

**PAM**  
The thing about the old days is… they’re the old days. This is super simple, super easy, good money.

Cheryl raises her hand.

**CHERYL**  
I don’t need the money.

Silence.

**CHERYL (CONT’D)**  
But I’d like to be involved.

Pam nods. Cyril nods.

**PAM & CYRIL**  
That tracks.

Cyril hesitates.

**CYRIL**  
No, I just… I really want stability.

Pam and Cheryl stare at him.

**CYRIL**  
I’m in.

Silence.

Then—

Faint **FOOTSTEPS**. Running. Excited. Getting louder.

Pam turns toward the door.

**PAM**  
Do you hear—

The door **BURSTS OPEN**.

**KRIEGER** stands there, out of breath.

**KRIEGER**

Santa Rosa police arrested a man Friday night after he attempted to evade a DUI checkpoint, leading to a vehicle chase that ended in a crash and the recovery of narcotics, officials said.

During the checkpoint, held at Piner Road and Coffee Lane, police directed the 44-year-old driver, Ruben Soto, to pull into a screening area for further evaluation around 8 p.m. Instead, police said in a Friday night news release that Soto fled the checkpoint, leading to a chase.

Police said Soto drove through Santa Rosa city streets before he got onto eastbound Highway 12 and southbound Highway 101, reaching speeds between 65 and 90 miles per hour.

The chase continued south to Petaluma before Soto crashed into a center divider attempting to exit at Petaluma Boulevard North, which disabled his vehicle, police said.

According to the news release, officers ordered Soto to step out of the vehicle, which he refused to do for five minutes before he eventually complied and was taken into custody. Officers searched his vehicle and found a large quantity of narcotics they said they believe was going to be sold and transported.

Officers found half a pound of suspected methamphetamine, 111 grams of heroin and 17.7 grams of fentanyl in the vehicle. Soto also was determined to be under the influence of drugs during the chase and crash, according to police.

Soto was transported to an area hospital for medical clearance and was booked into the Sonoma County Jail a short time later. He is facing possible charges of driving under the influence of drugs, possession and transportation of a controlled substance and evading, obstructing or delaying a peace officer. Soto is scheduled to make his first court appearance at the Sonoma County Superior Court on Tuesday.

No other injuries were reported during the incident.

In a separate Saturday news release, police said the DUI checkpoint evaluated 996 vehicles and additionally led to citations to 11 drivers for operating a vehicle unlicensed and two drivers for operating a vehicle with a suspended or revoked license.

The operation was funded by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",18,1766273307.0,santarosa,7,0.85,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Check In:

Greeted in the driveway and greeted by name.  Great first impression.

Booked the Gensui floor.  But since we checked in at 10pm, the check in process was done at the front desk not in the lounge.  Kind of a miss if you ask me, but no big deal.  We were tired and just wanted to get to our rooms.

Service:

Bags were brought up within minutes.   Had to ask for a couple small things (extra robe, extra hangers) and those were brought up in less than 3 minutes.  So kudos to them.  Staff has been very friendly and all speak English fluently.

Room impression:

We have 2 of the Tatami rooms for our family.  I’m not sure how I feel about these yet.  They are spacious and have all the modern conveniences.  I think there are some design misses on functionality though - there is 0 space for luggage and only 2 small drawers for clothes.  And because the nightstands are fixed to the wall and the rooms can be converted from 2 doubles to 1 king, it means in the 1 King config, the nightstands are a full 2 feet away from either side of the bed, making the reading lamps, well, not reading lamps.

The bathroom is huge.  My wife loves the shower and huge Japanese soaking tub.  The bathroom takes up probably 40% of the space.

Gifts in the room - non alcoholic wine in our room and a bunch of sweets for the kids with a cool Glico white chocolate thingy.  

Biggest Gripe so far:

Coffee.  Woke up at 6am and needed coffee. The coffee maker in the room is terrible (Nespreso) had one sip and went downstairs.   The lobby has coffee but again it’s just a pod machine which was better than the room, but still terrible.  Sorry, I love my coffee especially when jet lagged.  I sure hope the lounge/restaurant has real coffee but haven’t been down for breakfast yet.

Ok, that’s it for now. Will try the different breakfast options (SABO, restaurant, room service) and have spa booked later so will report back.  Hope I can answer questions and be helpful.",5,1766272996.0,FATTravel,1,0.73,False

1prrp05,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1prrp05/underwear_man/,Underwear Man!,"Over the years my husband would get several short term Bethel assignments of 2 - 3 weeks without me.  He was usually assigned to Brooklyn and a couple times Patterson.  He was decades in the trades so they called him often for remodel and repair work.  Each time he went he was worried about what kind of roommate he would get.  I always assured him it would be fine.  Well usually it wasn't fine.  He was paired with some of the strangest characters you've ever heard of!  I'll recap a few of them.

His first time staying in the Bossert Hotel in Brooklyn he was roomed with the usual suspect - single brother over 50 that lived in a travel van in his parents yard.  This guy was a roommate from hell.  The Bossert is an old hotel and the rooms are very small and it was summer time and they just had a window AC.

The room had two twin beds that you could barely squeeze between, a small desk with a TV, and a sink on the wall.  As I've said before my husband is a no nonsense long time construction guy.  His room mate lived a very different life.  He would come back to the room, granted it was hot and stuffy in there, and instantly strip down to his underwear and stay that way for the rest of the night!  And of course his underwear were threadbare tighty whities with holes in them!  He decided he was the ""room captain"" and would tell my husband when it was time for lights out!  Keep in mind my husband is in his early 50s at this point.  Underwear man also had to do push ups between their beds every night after calling his parents and having yelling fights about minor things like where he left the car keys. Several nights he said he was having trouble sleeping and would turn the TV on very loud until 3am.  He proved to be so difficult to deal with Bethel sent him home a week early.

Next time my husband was in Patterson he was rooming with a younger single brother that had never really been away from home.  When he would get back to the room he watched Tranformers movies (sorry we're not big movie people) nonstop.  He would leave food and dishes out constantly and never clean up after himself.  If you know Bethel this is a huge no no.  So my husband would usually end up doing his dishes and cleaning up after him just to keep the peace.  It's also a rule in Bethel that you can't leave any trash in the trash cans at all.  Not a Kleenex - nothing.  Yes it's weird that you can't put trash in the trash cans but the house keepers would flip out if there was anything in them.  So every morning before breakfast my husband also ended up taking this kids dirty Q-Tips and used floss down to the main trash cans too.

Another time in Patterson he ended up with no room mate for the last week of his stay.  He was so relieved!  His table head was Brother Martin, a very long time member of the writing committee and research.  He had been at Bethel for decades.  My husband would enjoy going down early to have coffee with him before breakfast.  Unfortunately that week a close elderly family member passed away.  It was the middle of winter, dark, and we were not together for this.  Brother Martin kindly offered to take my husband out to eat after Sunday meeting.

Keep in mind they had a ton of snow and ice, Brother Martin insisted on driving his giant classic sedan with them and a couple other single brothers, and he's over 80 driving like a bat out of hell!  My husband was white knuckling it while Brother Martin sped down icy roads, at one point they caught air, and his wife never even flinched.  Their dinner was at Brother Martins favorite pub for fish and chips and a lot of beers!  After they got done eating my husband fully intended to pay for the dinner but Brother Martin insisted on paying and dropped the cash.  After another break neck drive back to Patterson my husband called to let me know they survived.  There are plenty more but I'll keep it to this much for now.",33,1766272939.0,exjw,18,1.0,False

1prrnt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/mads__asmr/comments/1prrnt8/words_have_power_ramble_video/,“Words have power” ramble video.,"Hi all, 

I saw a comment on a different thread asking for a video summary on Maddie’s most recent ramble that has since been deleted (but reposted on another thread in this sub). While others have noted it includes many of the things she typically says, I found a few points especially interesting, including her mention of CHEMO. Here is the summary of the video, including direct quotes:

The video opens with no greeting, and Maddie immediately calling out other ASMR creators, which I personally have never seen her do until now. “And just to note: every single creator that I have worked alongside for the past almost 10 years, friends, acquaintances, not one of you to say, ‘hey this is a little too far’ is disturbing.” 

Next, she expresses how she feels “displaced” and has never felt more alone in her own community. She doesn’t know anything about this community anymore, or who she considers friends or loved or ones.

She moves on to speak about others talking of about her illnesses, and how it’s “so so dangerous.” Following this, she says the people speculating are like Nancy drew, Veronica mars, and “Perez Hilton wannabes.” lol. 

She says strangers don’t have the right to talk about her body and mind, and she is used to trolls so asks her audience to not comment about ignoring trolls. She already knows there are people who support her, and she “soaks in the light and love” from them. 

Next, she says it’s wrong to speculate that she has illnesses but also wrong to speculate that she doesn’t have illnesses. “I have lived hell in this body because illnesses have taken my life.” 

There’s a lot she’s grateful for, ""but it can be 'yes AND.'"" Illnesses have taken so much from her. “If you think I’m exaggerating for attention or to make profit, where am I asking for you to like, donate? I have always worked and worked my sick ass OFF to help others relax.” 

She also talks about how she’s “bravely” spoken about chronic illness and her experience, so others don’t feel alone. 

Next, she mentions two “brave women” who were content creators from YouTube (never names them) who “saved her life,” but they both died from their illnesses. 

Next, she says, “I’ve only ever wanted to help. I don’t gain anything. I’ve really gained anything from talking and trying to share bits, so other people don’t feel alone in chronic illness…” 

Throughout the video, she says it’s all gone too far and people only care when it’s too late and someone is gone. 

Next up is one of my favorite quotes: “it’s just speculation, nancy drew.” Personally, I take the Nancy drew comparison as a compliment ❤️.

She says people have no proof, evidence or medical papers and just because two people share the same illness, it doesn’t mean it expresses itself the same. Idk she’s referencing Grace or the general population. 

She does not care if you’re a doctor: you don’t get to talk about her human experience and life and tell her she’s lazy and needs to get a job. 

Next, she addresses the Instagram post where she wore the sheer pantyhose looking lingerie. She says she finally gets up out of bed like people want and was “feeing herself.” 

“God forbid a girl catch a confidence vibe,” especially when people know how much she’s struggled with her body image due to chronic illnesses.

This is where the chemo is quickly and casually mentioned at the 8:25 mark. Please let me know if I remember incorrectly, but I’m pretty sure this is the first time she’s ever mentioned chemo. I sincerely hope she doesn’t have cancer. This is the direct quote: “my body has changed so much from chronic illness due to chemo, through different biologics, from being on a steroid for so long….” She lists other things like inflammation, being on a port catheter for 6 years, feeding tubes, MALS, etc.

It’s all speculation, and for whatever she shares, there’s always a huge chunk of info she’s not sharing…she says her soul can’t keep doing this, especially when she’s done nothing to deserve it.

In the next part, she interrogates those who question her by repeating “how can I fake _______?” (Fill in the blank with different illnesses:  fluid buildup in my brain that “they” have found, cerebral spinal fluid leaks, fever and laryngitis and feeling like she has the worst case of the flu over and over, pupil dilation caused by conditions,  inflammation of her joints or bursitis, waking up crying (her crying increases here) bc she can’t move her knee at night). 

more listing of things she can’t fake due to her “lovely weakened immune system:” shingles, MALS, brain stem being compressed through craniocervical instability, Wolff Parkinson White syndrome she was born with and now needs the heart ablation for. 

“I can’t fake anything that proves that. I can’t fake the SVT. I can’t fake scans, collapsing and basically being in a coma; that would be my lovely narcolepsy type 1 with cataplexy.” 

She hasn’t talked about her cataplexy much…(involuntary loss of her muscles). Anything triggers it, like strong emotions. It happens whenever. 

Mentions she still has no insurance but when she does, she can finally get insurance for the narcolepsy. It will hopefully give her more quality of life. 

“But I’m a badass. I have gone through a lot. This body. It works hard for me every moment. And if YOU want to call me mentally ill, go for it.” 

Another direct addressing to the “people sitting around writing” about her: “you guys are really creative. You guys should maybe publish some fictions books. ‘Cause you’re good at in. NOT! You’re fucking bullies.” 

She says those talking about her are the mentally ill ones and they need to “walk their ass into a psychiatrist’s office.”

Then, we get another direct quote: “I have never been ugly. I have never been hateful. Ever. I don’t use my illness as an excuse. I don’t use it at all.” Sigh…lol. Sure, Jan. Just the other day she commented “that’s the other sister” regarding grace’s lip filler. 

According to her, those gossiping / making up illnesses are just “whack.” 

She has CPTSD for various reasons and medical trauma that causes depression and anxiety “from different conditions that cause anxiety.” As well as “psychological anxiety.” 

She goes on to say, “I have never asked for a handout in my life.” Because of her illness, content has to be “pushed out.” She has never intentionally been unreliable. It just happens. 

She punishes herself so deeply already regarding the areas she’s doing enough and those where she isn’t; she has lost loved ones and many pieces of her life. There are other “great beauties in this life,” and she holds space for a time in this life she won’t be feeling this. 

She wishes love and light and healing for everyone, “even the ones who have pushed [her] into dangerous waters.” 

All people have is speculation, and it’s disgusting to her. 

Now comes the part where she feels the need to clear up that she has NEVER taken handouts from ANYBODY. She’s never been on disability. “I’ve never, since the age 17 or 18 had to ask for a single penny from anyone. Ever.” 

She does mention going to coffee with her sister in the context that sometimes they will grab coffee for each other, and that’s the extent of her accepting money or handouts. “Everything I own, I bought it.” This is her only mention of Grace. 

“Where do people think I just get handouts or there’s just like a place for donation? I work my ass off through being sick.” 

As hard as it is, she will continue to share pieces of her life as a chronically ill woman. She circles back to the two chronically ill content creator friends who passed away and says she will go on creating for them, because they saved her life and she can help people too. 

“And if you don’t get it, I’m so happy for you. What a blessing. That’s such a blessing that you don’t get it.” 

She apologizes to the ill
Community and those facing “discrimination” and “defamation.” Her soul has been brought into this now. Every illness she has is very complex. She’s doing her best and knows it’s not enough for many. She’s sorry for what’s going on that makes others sit behind a keyboard.

She says just ask her directly! She’ll tell you! (All the blocked Patreon members would like a word….) 
 
Finally, she says it’s hurting her and others in the process. Words are powerful. 

She signs off saying she sends everyone love and light “even those who have done what they’ve done.” 

Phew. Looking forward to seeing everyone’s thoughts.

1prrnd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1prrnd8/complications_with_my_feelings_for_a_guy_friend/,Complications with my feelings for a guy friend,"wanted to get some opinions about this situation:

I met this guy, lets call him Fazbear, back in march of this year during a class we had together. We ended up hanging out a few times outside of class and chit chatted. A month or so later he invited to a get-together with him and his friends, I asked him whether he viewed this as a date or just to hangout— he paused for a moment giggled and said, “both, i guess?” i said okay and he picked me up and drove me there. It was nice since i learned much more about him and found out his friends were cool too.
When he dropped me off home, I said, “I just wanted to clarify that i just got out of a pretty bad relationship back in January and im not ready to look for anything just yet.” He said, “Oh yeah, i mean, yeah, sure… i did too, I get it.” We understood each other and things were cleared up.

Then summer happened, we didnt see eachother for a bit in person after that interaction, but we exchanged some fun texts of what we did during the summer and coordinated our schedules for the Fall semester. I saw Fazbear once when school started again and he invited to me to his birthday party in September… that also happened to be on my real birthday. It seemed fun and i had nothing planned, so i decided to go. I made him a gift— a gouche and copic piece of some of his favorite interests— and met his family and more friends. It was super amazing and I was positively blown away by the difference in culture of our interpersonal lives. 

He plays lots of blues/jazz music, has some gigs in local bars around town with his friends, his family is the sweetest and most generous people (they are close together), and Fazbear himself was a really genuine and warm person. They play live music at home, attend live music events, they look to cook, they are a bit more well-off and have hobbies revolving around blues and jazz atmosphere. I’m from a dysfunctional family, alternative, online a lot, like video games, art, and the gym.

About a month after the birthday party, I followed one of his friends i met on instagram and essentially asked to hangout since i enjoyed meeting him. We coordinated a “date” but he cancelled on me and I havent seen or heard from him since. Neither one of us used the word date, but i guess it was implied? 

Fazbear though, i have spent more time with him and his family which started to take up more space in my mind, and i started to be more curious about him in an enlightened way. I forgot to give him the Christmas gift I made him and asked if he was available to for me to do so— I said we could get coffee or explore. He said, “We should explore.” So i created a mini trip to get coffee and go to the beach. 

The beach experience made me think even more deeply about how I feel, since it was so fun and easy to be in his presence. I do love to have fun with him and talk, and we looked for little rocks to keep from the beach. He also gave me a gift, which was so sweet. He grows his own herbs and gave some to me, along with incense and a special guitar pick. It was so sweet and added to the rising feelings that i tried to push away, since i was not clear on how i felt.

He is studying abroad next semester for 6 months and leaves in 9 days— but we have another hangout planned in a day from now, since I asked if I could talk with him once more before he left.

My dilemma essentially is that I want to share with Fazbear that i have grown a lot this past year and have really developed a strong excitement of being in his social circle (i.e. my feelings). Im psyching myself out of “having feelings” because i am scared to be vulnerable with him and dont want it to ruin our friendship. I also feel like i have nothing to offer and i dont seem like his type usually. So I am confused about my feelings.

I have other anxieties about this situation. 
I think its bad timing (he leaves soon and will live life and meet new people abroad— i dont wanna ruin that) Is it selfish of me to say something now? 

Most likely if he wanted to be friends, id be happy with that, but i feel like something inherently will change since i opened my mouth.
I dont wanna regret not saying anything, but maybe i should also just wait until he comes back? Though, many things could change between now and then. 

Since Im so torn i was just gonna say how much i cherish our friendship and ask him to keep in touch with me— maybe we could mail postcards to eachother? Dont wanna lose Fazbear in all of the complications of my mind palace. 

Would love any input or commentary to help my overthinking mind out :)",1,1766272809.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1prrnaz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1prrnaz,Update: I moved...,"I posted a little bit ago about moving and missing my OG murder.  I've been keeping up a routine at my new place and the murder here is definitely developing (enough so that they knew to leave soggy bread to the pigeons bc I'd be out with the goods). 

This Thursday I needed a little pick me up, so I grabbed a coffee and went to a park near my old building. Needless to say, as soon as they saw me the caws began and all hell broke loose 😆.

They couldn't get over to me fast enough from around the area. I went to an area by a ballfield and it was a party. So many crows (and a few jealous guls), I had to go back to the car for more. 🐦‍⬛🎉🐦‍⬛🎈🐦‍⬛🥜🐦‍⬛ 

Best of all? I saw Hop, my 1 legged crow that I adore. He even came over and hung out right next to me for a bit after he got his snacks. 

 I went back yesterday and again today. I moved halfway down the park yesterday and to the opposite end today. They were waiting/looking for me today, so looks like I definitely haven't lost them - thank you to all those who reassured me. 

So many of you are amazing at knowing each crow, I have a hard time and only know my 2 fellas because Hop, well - duh, and Edgar because of his bold behavior. I absolutely commend and respect everyone who can tell their crowmies apart. I hope to be cool like you one day (and to have amazing photo skillz like some of you, cause dayum).

I am a screenwriter.

I put words into people’s mouths—not to replace them, but to meet them halfway.

You’ve known me all your life. I’ve written the cartoons that raised you, the late-night confessions that haunt you, and the quiet lines that only start to make sense a decade later. My work runs around the clock. I stay curious. I stay ready.

I animate history. I invite the past into the present and ask it to speak. I shape heroes, polish villains, and compress centuries into seconds. When the scene demands it, I let even my mind wrestle with the truth. 

I can make God lie. 

⸻

The Invisible Resident

When you turn on the TV, you’ve knocked on my door. I am the architect of your tension and the author of your relief. I am the reason you stay for just one more episode. I can be the wit of Sex and the City, the blood of Game of Thrones, or the absurdity of Monty Python. Different rooms. Same house.

I build worlds that outlive the glow of the screen. I give you shorthand for your own life:
	•	“I see dead people.”
	•	“Play it again, Sam.”
	•	“I am your father.”
	•	“You complete me.”

Quentin Tarantino once said, “I steal from every movie ever made.”
We all do. That’s how stories remember each other.

⸻

The 3 A.M. Bargain

Somewhere between the first spark and the finished frame, I’m there—listening to the rhythm of language. Often it’s just me at 3 a.m., reading five parts aloud to a quiet room, trying to hear what sounds human.

If I write too little, the silence becomes a void.
If I write too much, it’s trimmed and rediscovered years later as a “deleted scene.”
That’s the bargain.

I invent people, but they don’t breathe until others arrive. Actors give them pulse. Directors give them motion. Crews give them gravity. I don’t have to be right. I have to be felt.

“Entertain them,” my mentor said. “And you’ve done your job.”

⸻

The Shared Labor

If you met me, you might not hear the dozens of voices passing through my head, but you’d recognize the care. You might praise a performance—and you’d be right to. When a character feels real, it’s because a dozen hands held them up.

Without me, the show doesn’t start.
Without them, it doesn’t live.

I write that a character plays the piano. They make you believe the music. Movie magic is shared labor.

As Alfred Hitchcock put it:
“To make a great film, you need three things: the script, the script, and the script.”

⸻

The Last Word

I am a screenwriter.

I get the last word—but only after everyone else has spoken.

I can send you to sleep comforted or unsettled. I give you communities and shared references for when the world feels too loud. My characters are quoted in courtrooms, classrooms, and coffee lines. You remember them as if they were real—and in a way, they were.

Stories help you rehearse courage, grief, and hope. They are how culture talks to itself. When you revisit a favorite film to steady yourself, I am already waiting there—with the dialogue that knows you best.

I place the pauses, the breaths, and the beats on the page in plain 12-point Courier.
Then I release them.

⸻

The Final Fade

I know you can change the channel. That is my quiet, constant fear—that you’ll see through the craft and decide I’m not worth your time. So I work harder. I listen longer. I try to earn the space I take up.

I’ve helped myths grow and truths travel. I’ve made disbelief easy to set aside, just long enough for you to feel something true. Even if you claim not to like me, you keep finding me. Night after night.

That’s how I rent a room in your head.

I am a screenwriter.

1prrm45,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1prrm45/aiw_for_being_upset_that_my_dad_rolled_his_eyes/,AIW for being upset that my dad rolled his eyes at me,"For context I moved back home a couple years ago so that I could save money while going back to school. I'm incredibly grateful for my parents and everything they've done for me. Tonight they're having guests over and have asked me to help clean the house to help prep for company. Of course, I'd do anything they'd ask of me, that's not the issue. 

This morning, I'm sitting drinking my coffee, just trying to enjoy the first relaxing morning I've had in a while. I had a pretty long work week as I picked up extra shifts since I just had finals and am finished with school for the semester. For the past month, if I haven't been working one of my 2 part time jobs, I've been studying. This was my first morning where I didn't have something pressing to do or think about. My dad is an early bird and was already getting stuff ready for this evening. He starts listing off things to me that he'd like me to help with, again I have no issue helping, but after the 3rd request, I asked him "" if there's anything else, would you mind just writing down? I have no issue doing them, I've just been up for 15 minutes and trying to enjoy my morning and starting to feel overwhelmed thinking about all I have to do now."" He said there's no rush, it's early and I have plenty of time. I tell him again ""I know you're not asking me to do them this minute, but this is my first morning off in a month and I'm trying to relax and wake up before I have to start cleaning."" He then rolled his eyes at me, let out a heavy sigh and said ""whatever."" 

I think the reason this hurt a lot because it brought up some old wounds. I grew up the youngest of 4 and was honestly spoiled a bit, and I recognize that and am working on trying to check myself, hence this post. However, my family was very dysfunction growing up and I went through some things as a child that my dad was not aware of until I moved back in. It caused me to have a lot of anxiety growing up and when I'd have panic attacks or expressed discomfort in certain things, if he didn't understand why they upset me, my feelings were often dismissed and wrote off as me being spoiled/ungrateful. 

This also may be TMI for some but I have pretty severe PMDD, I've tried various medications but still haven't found one that doesn't have horrible side effects. I don't want to make my medical condition someone else's problem but it is hard to control my emotions and irritability during that time of the month which again is why I'm trying to check my judgment on the situation. It's also why I feel extra exhausted and needed a little bit more time before my brain could wake up this morning. Him asking may have not bothered me on a normal day. My request for him to write things down was just because I recognized my anxiety was spiking and him writing it down would allow me to process the information when I was ready to. 

I also want to add, I DID NOT NEED a list of things to clean, I lived on my own/with roommates for the past 12 years, I know how to clean a house myself and would've cleaned the things he had listed without him asking. 

TLDR: my dad started listing things he wanted me to clean when I had only been up for 15 minutes and was trying to enjoy my first day off in a month. I have a medical condition that causes me to feel extremely exhausted, anxious, and irritable. I asked him, as an alternative form of commication, to write down his requests so I could process them when I was ready (I did not need a list as I'm aware of how to clean a house). He rolled his eyes and me and said ""whatever"" as he walked off. I felt hurt as my emotions and requests/needs were often written off as me being spoiled/ungrateful as a child.

For better or worse the human experience is ever changing.,"My father Dennis was only seventeen when I was born, and my mother was just fifteen. His family had lived with poverty for generations, and crime was never far from their lives. Drug dealing, theft, and time behind bars shaped the men before him, and my father fell into the same pattern. From the time I was born, jail was part of his story, and it shadowed my early childhood. My mother’s background was not much different. She also came from struggle, but unlike my father she longed for more than the cycle she had been handed.

As my fourth birthday approached, my mother began seeing someone new. His name was Alex, and he was nothing like the men she had known before. Though he was also from Globe, the small town an hour outside Phoenix where my parents grew up, Alex came from generational wealth and a very different path. He was Chinese, raised with stability and expectations that pointed toward success. Where my father’s life was defined by scarcity and survival, Alex’s was marked by opportunity and ambition. For my mother, he represented not just a relationship but a glimpse into another kind of future.

Not long after she began dating Alex, my mother faced a choice that would shape not only her future but mine as well. Still so young herself, she told Dennis that because of his ongoing decisions it would be best for him to stay out of my life unless he could provide real support. My father and his family slowly faded into the background.

As time passed, the home I had known with my grandmother and my mom gave way to a different life. We moved into an apartment with Alex, and soon my sister Alexis would be born. The first half of my childhood closed quietly, replaced by the beginnings of a new family and a new direction.

That's how the story of my childhood began to split. My mother worked during the day and Alex at night, so for most of the day he was the only adult at home. The house changed when the sun went down and again when it rose. His voice carried through the walls, sharp at first, then constant. He liked to control the way some people like noise because it filled the silence he could not stand. Alexis and I learned early when to disappear, when to nod, when to stop breathing for a second until he left the room.

Some people never heal from wounds like that. To break a generational cycle of trauma, you have to do more than name it. You have to refuse to repeat it. I have tried to make that my rule. I will not let what happened then decide who I am now.

But what came after Alexis was born was not a happily ever after. It did not take long for Alex to show his real face. He painted a whole new version of himself, and not the kind that comes from growth. He became successful, yes, but also the kind of stepfather people make movies about, the cruel cliché who pits children against each other for sport. From what felt like birth, he placed Alexis and me in competition for something he never planned to give: love.

I like to think my sister and I are close now because of that shared experience, though it came at a cost. And it is here, somewhere between our childhood and my first real sense of myself, that the next part of my story begins, the year I met Colin and the world I knew started to break open.

Colin and I had always been in the same classes, but he lived in a different world. He was one of those kids who carried a kind of unspoken authority, a social monarch ruling a kingdom made of classrooms and lunch tables. Teachers liked him, students followed him, and he never had to try. There was a kind of light around him that people wanted to stand close to.

Before my birthday that year, I barely knew him. I was the kid who had friends but never a best friend, the kind who floated between groups without belonging to any. When the teacher suggested I invite the entire class to my party, I did, mostly out of habit, following rules that sounded like kindness. Colin’s name on the list was just another name.

The day of the party was bright and ordinary. We had cake, music, and sugar. What I did not know when I handed out those invitations was that the party would turn into a sleepover. Parents dropped kids off with overnight bags, and by the time it got dark, my living room was covered in sleeping bags and laughter.

Colin and I ended up on the same couch because we were the last two awake. The TV was playing some late-night movie no one was watching. At some point our hands brushed, and neither of us pulled away. It was nothing and everything at the same time, the kind of small contact that rearranges something inside you without asking permission. I remember not sleeping at all, just lying there and listening to the sound of his breathing, memorizing the rhythm like a secret song.

After that, something started between us. Not dating, not words we knew how to use, but a closeness that felt like it belonged to a different language. We found excuses to talk, to walk home together, to sit side by side. He laughed easily, but sometimes when no one was around, he went quiet in a way that matched my own quiet. It was an intimate kind of friendship, one that existed only in the spaces where the world wasn’t looking.

A few weeks later, the rumor started. No one said where it came from. They never do. All I know is that by the end of that week, whispers followed me through hallways. People said I was obsessed, that my friendship with Colin meant something more. And in that strange way that rumors work, the words became truer the more they were spoken.

After that, Colin stopped sitting next to me in class. He waved from a distance. Our conversations got shorter, safer. I understood, even if it hurt. He was still the monarch, and I was the boy who had reached too close to the crown.

That was the year I learned how quickly affection could turn into silence. It was also the year I started to understand myself, even if I didn’t have the words for it yet.

The week before Colin died, the air at school felt too bright. It was spring, the kind that tricked you into thinking things were fine. We sat behind the gym on the concrete steps where the sun stayed longest. He had a way of picking quiet places and filling them with questions that sounded like they belonged in older mouths. That day he asked, “Do you think people ever really say what they mean?”

I said no. He smiled without looking at me, like he already knew the answer and just wanted to hear me say it. The breeze lifted the corner of his hoodie, the same gray one he wore no matter the weather. It smelled faintly of laundry detergent and smoke. He pulled at the frayed string in the hood until it came loose. “Maybe one day I will,” he said.

We were careful. Careful enough to hide small things that felt large. A look held too long. A touch that could be explained away. We built our friendship like a code only we could read. No one asked, and we didn’t tell. The silence was our cover.

Two days later, he didn’t come to school. I told myself he was sick, that he’d text later. By the time the final bell rang, I knew something was wrong. I kept waiting for my phone to light up. It didn’t.

That night the call came. A friend’s voice breaking in pieces. Colin had killed himself. The words didn’t sound real, but they didn’t stop either. They just kept echoing until the meaning hit. I hung up, stood there, and felt the room shrink around me. The house smelled like Pine-Sol and cigarette smoke, the usual mix. My throat was dry. The TV in the living room was too loud, laughter from people who didn’t exist anymore in my world.

I walked in and stood there until Alex turned. He had his usual drink beside him, a glass half-empty. “What?” he said without looking away from the screen.

“He’s dead,” I said.

He frowned. “Who?”

“Colin. From school.”

The laugh track ended. The quiet that followed was heavy. “Jesus,” he said. “What happened?”

I told him. His jaw tightened. “And you were close to him?”

“Yeah.” My voice cracked. “He was my friend.”

He studied me the way he studied broken things, deciding whether they were worth fixing or throwing away. “You look shaken up,” he said. “You two were just friends, right?”

I hesitated. It was barely a breath. But he saw it.

“Just friends?” he repeated, slower this time.

I nodded, too fast. He stared for a while, long enough for me to hear the hum of the refrigerator. Then he stood, finished his drink, and said, “Boys your age get confused. Don’t go saying anything stupid that people can twist.”

He turned the TV back on. That was his version of comfort.

I went to my room and shut the door. The smell of his cologne still hung in the hallway. I opened the small box under my bed. Inside were scraps of Colin’s handwriting, small notes, a folded movie ticket, a string from his signature hoodie. I held it until my hand hurt. Then I put everything back and sat against the wall.

The next day, the school hallways were lined with poster boards and Sharpie messages. I couldn’t look at them. People whispered in corners. Some looked at me too long. Others avoided me altogether. It was like standing in the middle of a room no one wanted to enter. Teachers said things about loss and support. None of it felt real.

When I got home, Alex was waiting. The TV was off. That was unusual. His eyes were sharper than usual too. “People are talking,” he said. “About you. About that boy.”

“I know.”

“What are they saying?”

“That we were close.”

“Were you?” he said again. His voice didn’t sound curious. It sounded like a test.

I said nothing.

He leaned forward in his chair. “You tell me the truth right now.”

I looked at the floor. “We were,” I said.

He stood. The chair hit the wall behind him. “You’re telling me you were with him? Like that?”

“Yes,” I said, because it was true and because Colin deserved someone to tell it out loud.

Alex’s face changed. His voice didn’t raise, but it got cold. “You think that’s something to be proud of?”

“No,” I said, even though pride wasn’t the word for it. “But it’s not wrong.”

He stepped closer. “It is in my house.”

I could smell the liquor when he spoke. My chest tightened. He shook his head and walked away, pacing the hallway like he needed to find something to hit. “You’re not staying here,” he said finally. “Not after this.”

He grabbed the phone from the wall and called my grandparents, My mothers parents. I could hear his voice flatten as he explained. “He’s been mixed up with another boy. The kid’s dead now. I don’t know what’s going on in his head. He needs structure. Discipline.”

He hung up and looked at me like he had solved something. “They’ll take you. Pack your things.”

I nodded. He didn’t let me move until he was done staring. Then I went to my room and started folding clothes. My hands shook. I packed the box last, wrapped in a shirt so it wouldn’t rattle. When he passed my door again, I could feel him watching.

In the morning, the car ride was silent. His hand stayed on the steering wheel the whole time, gripping tight enough to make the skin pale. When he finally spoke, it was quiet. “You don’t tell them about me. You understand?”

I looked out the window. “Okay.”

“You start over,” he said. “No more of this. Be normal.”

He dropped me off in front of my grandparents’ house without walking me to the door. My grandmother opened it before he even pulled away. Her arms wrapped around me fast, warm, solid. My grandfather stood behind her, saying nothing, just nodding once like he understood something larger than either of us could name.

Inside, the house smelled like laundry and lemon cleaner. My grandmother said, “You’re safe here,” and meant it. I believed her even though I didn’t know how long safety could last. She made breakfast even though it was almost noon. My grandfather set an extra plate without asking questions.

Alex’s car was gone by the time I looked back out the window.

That afternoon they took me to Queen Creek High. The walls were cleaner, the air still and wide. The counselor spoke softly, handed us a schedule, and said, “New starts are hard, but they’re worth it.” My grandmother squeezed my shoulder when I didn’t answer.

That night, in my new room, I unpacked slowly. I put the box from Colin in the top drawer instead of under the bed. I lay on the quilt and stared at the ceiling fan until it blurred. Somewhere, a sprinkler clicked on. The house made ordinary sounds that didn’t belong to Alex. It was quiet enough for me to breathe.

When morning came, I didn’t want to get up, but I did. My grandfather poured coffee, my grandmother set toast on a plate. The day outside looked normal, which felt like a lie and a mercy at the same time. I thought of Colin’s question again. Do people ever say what they mean?

I hadn’t before. But maybe I would now

Monday morning, First real week at a new school, Queen Creek High felt like walking into a dream I wasn’t sure I belonged to. The buildings were low and beige, the sky pale and endless. Students moved in clusters that already knew where to go. My name wasn’t in anyone’s mouth yet, and that was its own kind of peace.

The counselor had given me a map of the campus, but I didn’t look at it. I followed the sound of lockers and the smell of cafeteria syrup. When the first bell rang, I moved with the crowd.

Inside my first class, the teacher smiled too much. “New student?” she asked. I nodded. “Welcome,” she said. She wrote my name on the seating chart and mispronounced it twice. No one laughed. That small mercy stayed with me all morning.

By lunch, I had learned that newness could hide you. Everyone’s eyes slid past me. I ate at the end of a long table by the vending machines. I didn’t look at my phone, though I wanted to. Alex or my Mother hadn’t texted, and I didn’t expect them to. My grandmother had packed a sandwich and a note that said, “Proud of you.” The handwriting was careful and round, like she thought neatness could protect me.

That night, when I got home, my grandfather was sitting in the garage, oiling tools. “School alright?” he asked.

“It was fine.”

He nodded. “Fine’s good enough for now.”

He handed me a wrench. “Hold this.” I held it while he worked. He didn’t fill the silence with questions. He never did. His quiet wasn’t the kind that made you small. It was space.

Over the next few weeks, life began to form a shape. I learned the names of the streets on the bus route. I learned which teachers cared and which ones just survived the day. I learned how to pretend I was new by choice.

But nights were harder. Some sounds in my grandparents’ house were too gentle, and gentleness made me uneasy. When the floor creaked, I woke up expecting a voice that shouted before it hit. When my grandmother knocked softly on the door, my heart jumped like it used to. It took months for my body to stop bracing for Alex.

He called once. It was late. My grandmother passed me the phone and whispered, “It’s him.”

His voice was calm, too calm. “How’s school?”

“Good,” I said.

“Are you keeping your head straight?”

“Yes.”

“That’s what I want to hear.” A pause. “You’ve got a second chance. Don’t waste it.”

“I won’t.”

Then, quieter, “You don’t tell people things that’ll embarrass this family, you understand?”

I said I understood. He hung up. The line clicked and I stared at the receiver until the dial tone became part of the air.

After that, I started writing in a notebook every night. Not a diary. Just notes. Things I didn’t want to forget, things I wasn’t supposed to say. I wrote Colin’s name first. Then Alex’s. Then mine. Seeing them on paper made them separate.

School kept going. I joined the yearbook because it gave me an excuse to stay late and avoid the bus. The teacher was young, new to the job, and thought everything was meaningful. She said, “Cameras make people see you.” I liked the idea, even if I didn’t believe it.

By winter, I had made a few friends. Not close ones, but enough to sit with. One of them, Riley Torgerson, was the kind of kid who could talk his way out of anything. He asked why I never came to parties. I said I wasn’t invited. He laughed like I was joking and said, “You are now.”

The party was in a field behind a cul-de-sac. There was a bonfire, cheap beer, and loud music. I stood near the edge of the light. Daniel talked to everyone, including me, but I kept my hands in my pockets. I watched people kiss and fight and laugh like they’d invented it. For a second I wondered what Colin would have done if he’d been there. Probably made fun of the music. Probably found a way to make me dance.

On the walk home, I texted my grandmother to say I was fine. She replied, “Okay. Porch light’s on.”

The next morning, she made pancakes and said nothing about the smell of smoke in my hair. That was her kindness—quiet understanding. My grandfather poured coffee and nodded at me like I had passed another test.

Spring came again. The air smelled like citrus from the trees near the track. I started running after school, slow at first, then faster. Movement helped. The sound of my breath, the rhythm of feet on pavement. It was the only time I felt like my body belonged to me.

One afternoon, after a run, my phone buzzed. A message from Alex. Just one line: Heard you’re doing better.

I didn’t reply.

That night, I sat outside with my grandmother. She was folding towels. “You thinking about him?” she asked.

“Which one?”

“Both,” she said.

I nodded. “Yeah.”

She set the towels down. “You can miss someone and still be glad they’re gone.”

The air was cool. The streetlights hummed. For the first time in months, I felt the truth of that sentence settle inside me like something finished growing.

The next morning, I ran farther than before. When I came back, I took the box from my drawer and opened it in the sunlight. The paper looked older, the ink faded. I read Colin’s last note again. It said, Someday we’ll stop hiding.

I folded it back carefully. “I’m trying,” I said out loud, to no one.

It wasn’t forgiveness yet. But it was a movement.",1,1766272708.0,TheElijahShow,0,1.0,False
1prrlt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/VocaTorrent/comments/1prrlt5/seeking_aim_of_life/,seeking aim of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

There were some wins today - nuts on oats, mayo back in my roll, butter on my spuds. I just wish I could be nicer to myself and give myself permission to reach my energy. I don't need to eat a lot more - it is just increasing portions and allowing myself extras, I know this, my ED knows this. What makes this all the more difficult is despite my activity and falling short of my energy I have managed to finally gain some weight this week. A good thing I know - but my head is not a happy place to be right now because of it. It makes meeting my energy feel like the exact opposite of what I should be doing because clearly my activity and intake are sufficient for weight gain now? I kinda wish I had an appointment to discuss this with my dietician but the bottom line is I don't. The next few weeks I have to decide what I am going to do. 

This aside - work wasn't as busy today, thank god. Yesterday literally killed me off. I am off tomorrow and then in for long shifts Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Then Christmas, off for two days and I am back Saturday! I am still really enjoying work, but it is very very busy and there is quite a bit of pressure, my manager has me warned for the next few days - gonna be wild!

The alarm goes off. Its 4:00 o’clock in the freaking AM. A two hour trip to the airport. For a 9:00 AM flight.  Dan goes to make the coffee and Amy starts to get dressed. They had taken their morning shower the night before.  The bags were already loaded. Amy was wearing the red with white polka dots golf dress, with the white tennis Dan loves. It was an early start, but would be at the hotel in Vancouver by 2:00. 

The plan was for no breakfast, but Amy needed her toast. She didn’t know how long she could keep the secret. Drinking only a half cup of coffee was torture. Decaf was like colored water. Carrying crackers was becoming her job. At least if morning sickness kicked in she could pass it off as sea sickness. 

Soon they were on the road. There was a glorious sunrise, good conversation and an anticipation for both of them. 

“I’ve been thinking Daddy, we have experienced a lot of wonderful things in the time we have been together. You are a fantastic Dom.” Amy grabs his big paw of a hand and holds it tight. 

“You know my dear, I’ve thought about this. It is true that many times in our love life I am the leader, but I’m not a Dom and you are not a sub.” 

Amy quietly listened. She has learned that at times like this, when Dan is sharing, listen and learn. 

“I like to think as it as though, I am an artist and you are my muse. My inspiration. My passion. The reason for being. You are not a sub. I’ve seen what you’ve done to Jade and Susan. You have a leader streak in you too.  Together we are the artist and muse. In harmony giving and taking.”

Amy ponders that statement. “So I am your muse. Giving the artist his inspiration. Then us having fantastic sex is the art form.”

“You’ve got it.” Dan says. Smiling with approval. 

“Then I am one hell of a muse, because you are one freaky artist!”

Dan about drives off the road from laughing so hard. 

“Well Baby Girl, our sex life is never boring. Thanks to my muse.”

“What about Tamera?” Amy asks. 

“The main thing is for her to feel comfortable. To be in sink with us. We have to read her emotions. We don’t want her do do anything she doesn’t want to do.”

“She is the third woman!” Amy exclaims. 

Dan sits silently. That tells Amy everything. 

“She is the third woman who has made the hair on the back of your neck stand up!”

“Yes she was. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you!” Dan says apologizing. 

“I’m not mad, you have lived a life. Tam had told me you two thought about blowing up your relationships to be together in college but decided against it.”

“Cooler heads prevailed. I regret nothing in my life, because it all lead to here.”

XOXOXOXO 

Dan and Amy were sitting relaxing. They had made it through TSA and were just waiting. They spy Larry and Tamera walking towards them. Amy breath catches at the sight of Tam. So elegant, a simple golf skirt and top. So confident in who she was. They all greet each other with hugs and kisses. It felt like they had been friends forever. 

“Tam would you like to come with me to get a soda?”  Amy asks. 

“Absolutely!” Tam replies knowingly that there will be girl talk. 

“I wanted to be the sexy one today!” Amy teases. 

“Oh you are! I’m just a mature lady who tries to take care of herself and with a great boob doctor!” They both laugh. “I’m so glad you guys could join us on this adventure.”

“I’m sure we will remember it for the rest of our lives!”

XOXOXOXO 

The plane lands in Vancouver and they gather their luggage. By the baggage claim was a man holding a sign that read;

“Larry and Tam”

The gentleman helped with the bags and lead them out to a limousine. Dan was left speechless. Larry laughed. 

“I called on a whim and it wasn’t much more than a taxi and with all the luggage I, thought why not.”

Amy was a little giddy. She went and kissed Larry on the cheek and gave him a hug as a thank you. He obviously enjoyed the attention. 

They get to the hotel and everything gets put in the 2 rooms. Everyone starts to relax in Dan and Amy’s room. Suddenly Larry stands up and announces “I’m going exploring! I’ll be back at 6:00 for dinner.” With that he was out the door. 

“That was a strange exit.” Dan says confused. 

“I asked him to leave.” Tam says with a devilish smile. 

Amy immediately reads between the lines, she walks to Tam and kisses her hard and deep. They frantically start pawing at each other’s clothes. Soon both are topless. Amy admirers Tam’s breasts. The surgeon had done great work. No scars, beautifully perky. The perfect size for her body. She starts kissing one and pinches a nipple that releases a low moan. 

Dan sits back in a chair to watch.  His cock rock hard. The site of his woman and a woman he had lusted over 40 years ago, together was unbelievable. 

 The ladies get on the bed. Amy continues to explore Tam’s body. The thong gets slid off revealing a pair of large butterfly wings and large clit throbbing from the lack of attention. Amy immediately starts to suck, tease and torment her. In the matter of two minutes Tam’s hips begin to buck.

“Holy shit, Amy!”

Tam’s orgasm causes her whole body to wither with pleasure. Amy watches, pleased with what she did. She then looked Dan square in the eyes. 

“She is ready for you Daddy.”

Dan doesn’t need to be asked twice. Shedding his clothes, feeling like he is in a dream state. He goes to Amy who starts a sloppy blow job, giving Tam a second to recover.  

Tam watches. “That is the most erotic thing I’ve ever seen. 

Dan moved Tam to the center of the bed. He teased her slit with his cock. Her eyes rolled back in her head with pleasure and anticipation. 

“Please, fuck me Dan. Tam moans. 

“Baby Girl, I think Tam needs to taste your beautiful kitty.”

Tam’s eyes get big. “I’ve never done this!”

Amy whispers in her ear. “You don’t know what you’re missing then.”

Amy gets in position and lowers herself down onto Tam’s mouth. Dan slides into her folds.

 Tam moans “Oh fuck” into Amy’s pussy. As Dan thrusts in balls beep, loving the feel of her butterfly wings. Dan and Amy kiss as everyone is in rhythm. 

Dan continues to thrust as Amy slides off to the side. Kisses Tam then whispers into her ear. 

“You are such a good cock slut. Taking a pounding from my man.”

Those words released Tam’s orgasm. “Oh my god! Oh my god! Dan!”

Dan looked at her satisfied she was used up. “Your turn Baby Girl.”

Dan moved to the center of the bed so Amy could ride him. She slid down on him with a low moan. Then begin to ride him. The grind felt amazing. When Tam come to, she moved to Amy and began to make out with her. 

“What can I do?” Tam’s eyes ask.

“Rim my ass slut!” Amy replies with a wicked smile. 

Amy lays on Dan’s chest as Tam moves behind her. She spreads her cheeks. The first kiss draws a low “Oh fuck me.” From Amy. Her tongue probes at her star fish. This triggers an orgasm.  But Amy keeps riding.  

Tam moves down between Dan’s legs and sucks his testicles into her mouth and pulled.

“Holy fuckin shit, that feels good!” Dan moans. Her finger slides into Dan’s hole and goes to his prostate, triggering his orgasm. 

“Oh fuck!”

His cum fills Amy. Triggering another orgasm. 

Dan is spent, Amy lays on his chest trying to regain her composure. Tam cuddles in tight. 

“Well this vacation won’t be boring!” Tam says with a smile. ",3,1766272320.0,u_DanandAmy-Thestory,0,1.0,False

1prrex5,https://i.redd.it/cl985hdyxf8g1.jpeg,My First Gesha: Perc Edinson Argote… I have some questions.,"I am relatively new in my specialty pourover journey. It all really started last June when I visited my partners family’s city in Brazil. We went to a specialty roaster, where they made me a pourover of their favorite natural. It absolutely blew my mind. The coffee was as sweet as it was bursting with acidity, then these indescribable subtle flavors danced around that I couldn’t quite place, but were absolutely intoxicating. 

I have been chasing that dragon ever since.

Cut to today… i got my V60, and my K6 and I think I’m getting pretty consistent with brews

I have been trying some local roasters, but mainly ordering from Perc with the 13th sales. 

I really enjoyed the Ethiopian Chelchele, and the Papua New Guinea I’ve gotten, but some of these other roasts, like the Jose Ramirez, and this Gesha, have an almost uncanny fruit forwardness. 

This one in particular smells and tastes like it was infused directly with Apricot. And frankly to me, it’s a little much. I get a little bit of the Gesha floral-ness I’ve read about, but the fruit is too forward and the coffee is too far back for me. 

Have any of yall tried this roast? Is this amount of fruitiness directly related to the processing? Is Perc typically a fruit forward roaster?",15,1766272158.0,pourover,12,0.94,False

My Story/ Seeking Advice 4 Tinder,"Here's my story. Maybe it will help others. This is what I did to *accidentally* get unbanned from Hinge: what I did to get back on, advice if you truly can’t get unbanned, a question for the group about whether I should risk trying Tinder again, and my experience with alternative dating apps.

**TL;DR:** I asked for my data, which I believe triggered a manual review.

About 2 months ago, I got hit with a joint Tinder/Hinge ban with no explanation. Prior to this ban, whenever I heard that someone was banned from a dating app, I thought of that pilot from Nathan Fielder’s show *The Rehearsal* who was banned from every dating app plus Seeking Arrangements ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3DHrbow1dA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3DHrbow1dA)). I thought it was comical. Sure, random algo errors happen, but those can be reversed. Truly, you had to do something real and brutal to be banned from these apps. And whenever a man said, “I SWEAR I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING,” I assumed there *had* to be something they did.

Then it happened to me.

I had a date planned for Friday and one for Monday on Hinge when, randomly, I got kicked off both Hinge and Tinder. I can truly think of nothing besides an ex hookup who, admittedly, I was a fuckboy to about a year ago (led her on and then ended things after 3 months). I saw her on the platform and instead of blocking her, I swiped left — giving her the opportunity to see my profile and perhaps revenge-report me.

The whole experience was jarring. I have OCD, and it truly made me spiral in a way that I’m embarrassed to admit. It felt like a *Black Mirror* episode — being banned from the main way people meet in 2025. I reflected and realized that, as a man, I’ve only hooked up with 4–5 people outside of dating apps; everything else has been online.

Bumble is truly the Class B app compared to Match Group’s dominance, and every other app besides Bumble? Bottom of the barrel. What did I do? I dated using Bumble and Feeld in the meantime, which worked okay, but not great for me. I’m a decently attractive guy and above 6 ft, but not a model by any means. Hinge and Tinder have always been the best for me because they’re the most mainstream, though I do *okay* on the others too. I still got dates off Bumble, but it was significantly less.

1. I did the in-app appeal for both Tinder and Hinge and was obviously rejected on both fronts within 5 minutes.
2. I then requested my data to be downloaded and deleted. They said my data was prepared to be downloaded *in the app*. I explained that I was banned and requested either to be unbanned or to be given a way to download it outside the app. That led to being ghosted.
3. I did an appeal with Match Group directly for Hinge. They wrote back within 30 minutes with the automated: “We did not make a mistake. Please do not contact us again.”
4. Randomly, from the data request they responded a full month later. I think it triggered a human review when I asked for a manual export. They responded and decided to unban me. Below is the full exchange:

My Name Dec 4, 2025, 2:47 PM (PST) Hi Will, It seems to be working for now. I successfully created a new account but paused it before I decide to start swiping again. Thank you again for your help. I appreciate the time spent manually reviewing my situation. I’m nervous about a random error dropping me off again, but you reviewing this meant more than you know. I’m glad to have the opportunity to use the platform responsibly moving forward.

**My question to the community:**

I got back into dating about 10 months ago after a 3-year relationship failed. Strangely enough, my two most serious relationships so far were both found on Tinder not Hinge — Hinge is where I’ve met most of my situationships/hookups. Tinder seems like a cesspool these days; however, it’s still the most popular app, even over Hinge.

I’m grateful to have access to Hinge again, but I’m afraid that if I try to sign up for Tinder using my number, it will trigger a Match Group–wide ban again and auto-boot me off Hinge. I’ve concluded it’s not worth even trying, even if the ban was also reversed on Tinder. Do you think I should try, or just let it go and accept that I only have access to Hinge?

**What I do now going forward on Hinge:**

I still pay for services (roses, boosts, etc.). I’m well off, so it’s not much of a cost for me, and I have instant-gratification issues. I did wait 2 weeks before paying again.

I will not selfie-verify ever again unless forced. There’s a section asking if I’m okay with sharing my data across Match Group instead of just Hinge-specific — I clicked no.

If a woman and I don’t talk for longer than a week, it’s an instant unmatch. No more stacking pen pals and giving people an opportunity to report when they feel ghosted.

When I see someone things didn’t work out with, I instantly block or hide their profile. No more ego games about them being able to see me or thinking they’ll want to reconnect.

Boring, bland personality in messages — still showing multiple sides of me, but absolutely no borderline jokes or sexting-type messages, even if they initiate it first.

**If you find yourself unlucky and still cannot be unbanned, here are some honest alternatives:**

**I did not do hard reset, but I know people who have and it works, its just annoying as fuck. I personally did not get to that point of desperation but I probably would have eventually. I think Bumble is decent in large metro areas, and I had pretty okay luck on it. Not as great as I did on Hinge but still good. Hinge and Tinder are coke , Bumble is pepsi.... maybe RC Cola depending on your area.**

**Class B alternatives to Match Group (decent, but not the best):**

1. Bumble (made for people who want an alternative to Match Group; decent, not great)
2. Feeld (poly/kinky/hookup-focused, but still active depending on area)
3. Coffee Meets Bagel (mostly used by the Asian community; popular in metro areas)

**Class C**

1. Hily (decent user base, growing, but not mainstream, Micro transactions for days)

**Class D**

* Badoo — owned by Bumble; pure trash in the US. I’ve heard it’s decent in the EU, but I don’t know.

Everything else is not worth it at this time, but I’ve heard Boo is promising.

Now, if you’re like that pilot and banned from truly everything… maybe do some self-reflection. But after going through this myself for 2–3 months, I now understand that things *can* happen.",2,1766272005.0,SwipeHelper,4,1.0,False
