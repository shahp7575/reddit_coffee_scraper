It's extremely difficult to do heavy house work while he sits on the couch watching TV,  listening to music, or playing a game on his phone (he has spent nearly $700 on in the last 9 months). I get angry & resentful! My ADHD works amazingly when I have a body double while I clean. Even if he wasn't doing a lot, just having someone to chat with makes it bearable. However. I can't even have small chit chats with him anymore. I'm trying implemented & enforce bounderies. If I start having small chit chat, it always makes him go back to being kind for a couple of days & then right back to narcissistic man-child behavior. I am forcing myself not to fall back into the comfort zone!

Anyway, we own a 35ft trailer we have parked in our yard approx 30ft from our front steps. It's hooked up to electrical & propane, & Wi-Fi reaches out there. The water is not on & lines all need to be flushed from the winter antifreeze first. I actually chose to sleep in it the last 2 nights & will continue doing so until he moves in the trailer or moves out somewhere else. 2 weeks ago he offered to call a friend to go for coffee to give us a break, but today I asked him to call a friend & he said he will not go see anyone & will not go to the trailer. I have no drive to get things done! I'm so tired of doing all of the heavy labor in our home, as parents, as pet owners, as grown adults, & as partners!  I just want him to leave for a day or 2! 

(Bit of back story)I reached out to him mother months ago asking her to talk to him about being financially, physically, emotionally, etc  irresponsible. She talked to him, I heard the conversation I was sta ding right there. They talked about my reaction to his behavior is the problem. Not once did she tell him he needs to grow up. Also- her & his step-dad told me ""We know you do a LOT! Is there anything I can do to help you?"" I talked to his step dad about 6 months ago about how I can no longer take care of him & neglect my boys, dogs, & myself. He hugged me & told me he's sorry & said ""it's not right. He has to take care of his responsibilities."" I told him that I was planning on asking him to leave & he may ask his parents to stay at their house. His step dad instantly shock his head & said; ""Nope! He won't being stating with us. We don't have the space for him to stay plus (my husbands son) our grandson is staying here. There's no room"". I remember thinking, I would give my son my couch to sleep on if that is all I had. It would be harder to offer that if I have spent the last 20 years bailing him out of situations. My husband told his stepdaughter I was making him leave & stepdaughter laughed our loud & said ""she can't make you leave! Cops can't even make you leave. There's no physical violence"" 

I actually tried locking the door afrer he went out this morning. It was locked out of habit because it wasnt fully closed. After ai realized I locked it, I thought to myself ""maybe if I leave it locked for 1-2 mins to piss him off enough to go to the trailet instead of being around me! I know it wasn't nice but I am desperate to get him away for a few gours. It also was not abuse It was kiterlly only locked for 3 mins & I have the video/audio proof.

I asked this subreddit a while back about why a little bit comes out and everyone said the grind level was too fine. That fixed the problem then. and was really good coffee for a while. 

I didn't change anything since then, not the beans or anything, but out of nowhere a while back it just stopped working well. now the machine only spits out a few drops. I tried adjusting the grind size too, a bit more coarser and finer, but every morning I have to waste 3-5 servings of coffee beans just to get a sub par cup of coffee. after a few grinds and pours every morning, some more coffee comes out, but it's very burnt, or acidic. 

I am really frustrated right now. I want to sell my machine and go get a ninja coffee machine or something (not really, but really frustrated)

1kg8dp8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kg8dp8,Rotation: May Subs have begun shipping,"The coffees have finally cleared customs. I had to physically drive across town UPS, FedEx, USPS hubs just to keep them from sitting and stalling any longer.

Every day has felt like another delay. I know I‚Äôm behind schedule, and I want to sincerely apologize.

I placed the orders weeks ago to prep for the May 1st subscription relaunch, aiming to ship the last week of April so everything would land in the first week of the new month. But with FDA customs clearance, packages lost in transit, and all kinds of other roadblocks, I had to push the April 28th ship date to this week May 7th - whenever I can finish.

I packed as much as I possibly could. Left work early just to chase down packages, then went nonstop from 6PM to 1:29AM pushing out as many Rotation orders as I could. I‚Äôve got to find a way to finish the rest tomorrow and squeeze this out.

Honestly, I‚Äôm at my limit. It‚Äôs too much to manage solo, but the volume still isn‚Äôt high enough to justify hiring for real help (would need someone that can stay on consistently and enough work to keep them busy, not a 1 off freelance hire) or locking in a dedicated space(leases are contractual by YEARS). 

I‚Äôve got to figure something out soon. This started out as a passion project, but the ‚Äúfun‚Äù is wearing thin with all the ongoing attacks against me. The Downvotes, shit talking, the fake rumors, being banned from other coffee subs (I can‚Äôt grow this because I‚Äôm banned or shadow banned. And my only real viable option is through the people who ‚Äúget‚Äù what I‚Äôm doing and spread by word of mouth)

Even now at 3% of my brain capacity, I‚Äôm offering 47 times more than any comparable service. Most aren‚Äôt even in the same league. And I‚Äôm still operating a fraction of what I can really do.

But I‚Äôll be real I‚Äôm seriously considering handing this off to a random person. As you know, even if Rotation was running at full scale, it still couldn‚Äôt support my current lifestyle. So yeah, a lot on my mind right now.

But your orders should be out or completing this week.

1kg8ddr,https://i.redd.it/ow23yjz2r6ze1.jpeg,I‚Äôve been wanting to reach out to my former friend and ask her about her views on the economy. Should I?,"Allison was one of my oldest friends. My mom was friends with her father in high school so we go way back. She was my prom date. She has (had?) a good heart and is relatively bright and well-traveled. So imagine my shock as I watched her ditch common sense and compassion to embrace Trump, MAGA, anti-vax views, etc‚Ä¶

Under Trump, we had a tense but cordial relationship. We managed to get together for coffee whenever I was in town (I‚Äôve not lived in our hometown since my teens). My 2022 FB post ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù the midterm results was the final straw for Allison. I‚Äôve only shown her comment. Not shown is a bit of back and forth (though Allison never replied beyond her stupid post). I told her how offended I was that she had the nerve to tell me ‚Äúnot to reply‚Äù on my own FB post and, of course, many of my friends chimed in to engage. This was the last time we ever ‚Äúspoke‚Äù. She blocked me soon after, as did her mother. 

The fact that this is how we ended our relationship, and that she was so cowardly towards one her best friends has continued to anger me three years later. Now with the economy looking like it‚Äôs headed into a free fall, I‚Äôve wanted to reach out to her. I‚Äôve even drafted a text but decided not to send it. I want to ask her if she‚Äôs seeing prices fall and if she‚Äôs feeling confident about the economy.

1kg8bfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kg8bfj/does_the_cupluw_cold_brew_coffee_maker_offer_the/,Does the Cupluw Cold Brew Coffee Maker Offer the Best Brew Experience Review?,"Testing coffee gadgets is basically my hobby, and the Cupluw cold brew coffee maker has taken center stage in my kitchen for a while now. Its simple design and promise of brewing smooth, low-acid coffee caught my eye. The way I see it, cold brew isn‚Äôt just a drink; it‚Äôs a lifestyle. For anyone like me who values stress-free mornings with a refreshing sip of coffee in hand, this product seemed worth diving into.

**Design and Build Quality**

The heavy-duty glass mason jar feels solid in hand. Though lightweight enough to carry around even when full, the material screams durability. What truly impressed me is the soda-lime glass construction, designed to resist breaking while being completely lead, cadmium, and BPA-free. I feel a lot safer knowing there‚Äôs no plastic to interact with my coffee here. Plus, it‚Äôs compact enough to tuck effortlessly into the fridge without awkward rearrangements of other groceries.

**Ease of Use and Features**

A cold brew coffee maker should make the process simple, and this one certainly delivers. From its ergonomic handle to its easy-pour spout, I found every little aspect engineered for convenience. The airtight lid is a major win: it keeps coffee fresh and prevents spills, and I‚Äôve had zero leakage in my fridge so far (finally, no sticky shelves!). Even the flip-cap lid feels like a thoughtful addition. It saves me an awkward dance with caps each time I pour a cup.

[Check Cupluw cold brew coffee maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0dhpbr3k8/)

**Filter Performance**

The stainless steel filter is secretly the MVP as far as I‚Äôm concerned. Coffee grounds staying in the filter instead of floating in my drink? Game-changer. This 160-micron mesh filter felt ultra-fine yet sturdy, handling not just coffee, but tea leaves and even fruit infusions like a pro. If you‚Äôve ever had a gritty sip of cold brew, you know how crucial this feature is. Cleaning the filter takes a little patience if you‚Äôre obsessive like me, but it‚Äôs worth it for the smooth brews it churns out.

**Durability and Maintenance**

Life‚Äôs too short for fragile coffee equipment, and this one has held its own pretty well during chaotic mornings. It‚Äôs dishwasher-safe (thank goodness), and the wide-mouth jar makes manual cleaning straightforward when I feel old-school. I also appreciate that the glass feels neutral ‚Äì no weird lingering coffee flavors when I switch to brewing iced tea or lemonade. That kind of versatility? Underrated and necessary.

**Advantages**

- Compact size fits snugly into refrigerators.
- Robust glass features lead-free, cadmium-free, and BPA-free construction.
- Airtight lid preserves freshness and prevents leakage.
- 160-micron filter offers smooth cold brew, tea, and other drinks with no residue.
- Dishwasher-safe design simplifies cleanup.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Not suitable for drastic temperature changes (e.g., boiling water).
- Grainy grounds can clog the filter if not cleaned regularly.
- Handle feels slightly narrow for larger hands.

**Alternative Offerings**

While exploring similar products, I noticed the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker offers strong competition. Its plastic build appeals to those avoiding glass for breakability reasons. However, plastic taste can sometimes interfere with subtle coffee flavors ‚Äì something I never encountered with Cupluw‚Äôs glass pitcher. On another note, the Oxo Cold Brew Coffee Maker is popular due to its even coffee-water distribution, but its setup feels bulkier and far less fridge-friendly.

Compared to its competitors, the Cupluw cold brew coffee maker strikes a sweet balance by combining durability with practicality. Sure, it might lack Oxo‚Äôs fancy brewing tech, but that fine-mesh stainless steel filter maintains purity without overcomplicating the design.

**True Value**

When you consider the performance, simple usability, and sturdy materials, it hits the mark as an affordable indulgence for coffee lovers. While not the cheapest option out there, the quality justifies the price. Tossed between brewing smooth coffee or experimenting with fruity iced tea, my mornings now feel effortlessly upgraded.

¬†**ENERGY UPDATE | START LIVING OR START DYING¬†Ô∏è**

What‚Äôs happening in the cosmos and collective consciousness?This week‚Äôs energy is all about¬†integration, embodiment, and letting go of what's not yours to carry.

We‚Äôre now moving through the¬†afterglow of the Taurus New Moon¬†‚Äî a cosmic reset that asked us to plant grounded intentions around stability, self-worth, and embodiment. And with¬†Pluto still in retrograde, deeper patterns around power, control, and identity are continuing to surface. You may feel the urge to ‚Äúdo more‚Äù or push ahead ‚Äî but the true invitation is to¬†trust the recalibration.

Old timelines are collapsing, and attachments to who you ""should be"" are being stripped away to make room for your next evolution. This is a powerful time to¬†release the need to force outcomes¬†and instead align with your inner knowing.

As of the week of May 5, 2025, the primary planetary¬†retrograde is Pluto, which began its retrograde motion in Aquarius on May 4 and will continue until October 13. This period encourages deep personal and collective transformation, prompting introspection about power dynamics, societal structures, and personal growth.¬†¬†¬†

***Key Astrological Events This Week:***¬†

May 10:¬†Mercury transitions into Taurus, shifting communication styles toward practicality and grounded thinking.¬†¬†

Remember:¬†Your next level isn‚Äôt something you chase ‚Äî it‚Äôs something you allow.¬†Let go. Breathe. Receive.¬†Ô∏è

¬†**CALL-IN QUESTION & COACHING TIPS¬†Ô∏è**

This week‚Äôs question comes from¬†Jessica in Austin, Texas (USA)¬†‚Äî a soul-led woman navigating the complexities of modern relationships:

*‚ÄúI‚Äôm dating a man I really care about, and we both have kids from previous marriages. The issue is, he lets his children stay up really late when they‚Äôre with him ‚Äî like 11 or even midnight. I believe in a structured routine, especially school nights, and it‚Äôs becoming a real point of tension. How do I handle this without seeming controlling or creating conflict?‚Äù*

Let‚Äôs explore this through the lens of¬†conscious partnership and Universal Law.

At the core, this isn‚Äôt just about bedtime routines ‚Äî it‚Äôs about¬†core values, parenting philosophies, and blended family dynamics. When unspoken expectations clash, it creates emotional friction and misalignment.

Here‚Äôs the deeper truth:¬†You are not just navigating logistics ‚Äî you‚Äôre being called to define your own standards, communicate clearly, and align your relationship to a shared vision.

Solution: Creating Your¬†Life‚Äôs Manual:Inside this tool, we clarify what matters to you ‚Äî your values around parenting, communication, structure, and lifestyle. You‚Äôll learn how to express your truth with compassion, without controlling the other person or losing your own voice.

¬†Instead of reacting, you‚Äôll respond from soul-alignment.¬†Instead of arguing, you‚Äôll co-create agreements that honor¬†both¬†of your paths.¬†Instead of dimming your truth, you‚Äôll embody it with love.

This kind of clarity isn‚Äôt just for this moment ‚Äî it‚Äôs how you build a conscious relationship that lasts.¬†

¬†**UNIVERSAL LAW OF THE WEEK**¬†

The Law of Non-Attachment

This law reminds us that¬†freedom comes through surrender. When you're clinging to how, when, or what things should look like, you‚Äôre actually resisting the very flow you desire.

This week, practice releasing your grip on the outcome. Instead of asking ‚ÄúWhen will it happen?‚Äù ask, ‚ÄúHow can I stay in my truth, regardless of what happens?‚Äù

1kg8an0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kg8an0/should_you_buy_the_3m_water_filter_hf20s_review/,Should You Buy the 3M Water Filter HF20-S Review for Ice Makers?,"I was recently tasked with testing the 3M 56151-03 Water Filter Replacement Cartridge for my commercial ice maker, and after daily use for a few weeks, I feel like I‚Äôve got a pretty good grasp of its quirks and qualities. Designed to enhance water quality while reducing sediment, odors, microplastics, and scale, this cartridge didn‚Äôt just pique my curiosity‚Äîit earned its place in my day-to-day routine. As an avid coffee shop owner who relies heavily on ice quality to complement beverages, I know how crucial clean and consistent ice is in keeping customers happy.

### **Ease of Installation Makes Life Simpler**

My first impression was how user-friendly the replacement process was. Thanks to the Sanitary Quick Change (SQC) design, swapping out the cartridge was straightforward. No tools, no mess, no dealing with dust-covered instructions that leave more questions than answers. You just twist it off, pop the new one in, and voil√†! The valve-in-head design is equally impressive, as it automatically shuts off water during cartridge replacement. I didn‚Äôt have to panic about accidental spills or rushing to locate the shutoff valve in my bustling shop.

[Grab 3M 56151-03 Water Filter on Amazon before it‚Äôs gone!](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00571m910/)

### **Performance That Lives Up To Its Promise**

This thing really delivers in terms of its claims. The water it filters has a noticeably cleaner taste, which transferred to better-tasting ice. It made a huge difference for beverages like iced lattes and cold brew coffee. A big selling point was its ability to reduce chlorine taste and odor while inhibiting scale buildup. There‚Äôs nothing worse than random bursts of calcium flakes appearing in your drink to ruin an otherwise great cup of coffee. By filtering out cysts and other microbial particles, it made me feel secure about serving quality drinks without hidden nastiness.  

If you‚Äôre running a similar foodservice business, this cartridge saves you the headache of frequent maintenance. Reduced sediment means fewer service calls, and trust me, anyone who‚Äôs dealt with failing pumps or sticky valves due to scale buildup will find this feature an absolute boon.

### **Durability Over Time**

One aspect I was wary of was how long it would last without sacrificing quality. Based on the specs and my initial experience, it seems built to hold up under daily strain. For context, my ice machine runs almost non-stop, as I‚Äôve got a fairly steady rush of customers. The 3M water filter manages purifying water flow rates of up to 1.5 gallons per minute, which worked perfectly for my machine‚Äôs high-demand needs. Also, the NSF Standard 42 and 53 certifications give added assurance on its safety and structural integrity.

### **Key Benefits**

- Improves water taste significantly, enhancing ice quality.
- Sanitary Quick Change (SQC) ensures touch-free and hassle-free replacements.
- Valve-in-head design simplifies maintenance with no need to shut off upstream water.
- Incorporates a scale inhibitor to keep machines running smoothly longer.
- Certified to filter odors, particles, chlorine, and microbial cysts effectively.

### **Shortcomings to Keep in Mind**

Every product has its quirks, and this one isn‚Äôt exempt. While I benefited immensely from its performance, a few minor downsides stood out.

- Limited compatibility: The cartridge is designed specifically to work with the 3M ICE120-S system. If you‚Äôre operating a different unit, double-check compatibility beforehand.
- Size: At a dimension of 12 inches in height and a little over 3 inches in diameter, its taller-than-usual size might need cozy adjustment in certain setups.
- Replacement frequency: Depending on your water usage, you might find yourself needing replacements sooner than expected, especially in high-demand environments.

### **Competing Brands and Alternatives**

I‚Äôve tried similar water filtration solutions in the past, like Everpure and Pentair cartridges, so comparing them to the 3M water filter felt natural. While Everpure has an edge in ultra-long lifespan in certain models, their replacements tend to be more cumbersome to install. Pentair may offer a wider range of compatibility for different systems, but I found the water quality to be slightly less consistent. Ultimately, the 3M cartridge wins when it comes to truly seamless maintenance and end-product quality. The practicality of the built-in scale inhibitor also gives it an advantage other alternatives don‚Äôt always match.

### **Price Performance Perspective**

While I can‚Äôt speak on exact pricing since it fluctuates, I‚Äôll say it‚Äôs hard to put a price on peace of mind. Given how much maintenance stress this product alleviates and the immediate improvement in ice and water quality, it feels like a solid purchase for commercial purposes. If you‚Äôre someone balancing high quality and operational budget, this cartridge strikes an excellent price-to-quality ratio. You spend less worrying about wasted machine parts or customer dissatisfaction, making the investment worthwhile.

Got a flat burr TimeMore 078s and currently have a WW Key conical. Both are sort of described as ""hybrids"" for flavor so like more close to the middle ground between each. 

Some things I've noticed:

* needing 18.5g in flat burr vs 20g in conical for the same coffee once dialed in (which makes sense given uniform vs bimodal distribution)
* The spent pucks on the flat burr are not as clean, often more wet and when I knock it out of the portafilter, the bottom edges tend to stick and not come out as cleanly, I touch it though and it's not dry but probably more dry? 

I'm wondering:

* Is this normal? 
* Is this due to less fines?

1kg89j8,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kg89j8/does_the_melissani_m1_reverse_osmosis_water/,Does the Melissani M1 Reverse Osmosis Water Purifier Live Up to Reviews?,"Testing out the Melissani M1 Reverse Osmosis Countertop Water Purifier has truly been an interesting journey in improving everyday hydration. As someone who looks for convenience and efficiency in home appliances, this product caught my attention with its professional-grade purification features and no-installation design. The promise of removing 99% of PFAS, lead, and other chemicals while offering hot or cool water in merely three seconds seemed like a game-changer.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the sleek, modern design of this countertop machine stood out. It doesn‚Äôt feel out of place in a contemporary kitchen, fitting right in with its compact 9.5 x 17 x 19-inch dimensions. Despite its clean design, the purifier is a bit on the heavier side at 24 pounds, so moving it around could be a minor hassle. That being said, its setup was as easy as unboxing it and plugging it in. No tools, no complicated instructions, just straightforward functionality. The removable drip tray was another design highlight, making cleaning less stressful, particularly when different cup sizes are at play.

**Performance and Filtration System**  
Using it daily, the filtration performance impressed me. The 5-stage RO filtration system paired with LED-UVC sterilization ensures water is thoroughly purified, removing particles down to 0.0001 microns. According to the specs, it eliminates fluoride, chlorine, rust, lead, and even viruses, which is a huge win for anyone concerned about tap water quality. The taste of the water transformed completely‚Äîit‚Äôs smooth, crisp, and noticeably better than unfiltered water. The maximum flow rate of 24 liters per hour is also sufficient for household needs, even for someone like me who guzzles water nonstop.

**Positives**  
- Advanced 5-stage filtration system that enhances water taste and safety.  
- Self-cleaning mode keeps the system fresh for extended filter life.  
- Hot water function is perfect for quick tea or coffee preparation.  

[View Melissani M1 Reverse Osmosis Countertop Water Purifier sale info on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0bpdk47h4/)

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Using this device every day, I appreciated the smart features built into the system. The TDS display shows real-time water quality, which reassures you of the purifier‚Äôs efficiency. Its smart life indicators are also convenient, reminding you when it‚Äôs time to switch out filters. Replacing the filters felt intuitive, with clear instructions ensuring simplicity. The standout, though, was the instant hot or cool water feature, which made it ideal for my morning coffee or filling a bottle of cold water to go. Plus, the variable output options (8 oz, 12 oz, Continuous Flow) add another layer of user-friendliness.

**Negatives**  
- The weight (24 pounds) can make relocation inconvenient.  
- Price point could feel steep for budget-conscious shoppers.  
- Initial operation of features like hydrogen enrichment can be slightly tricky.  

**Environmental Impact**  
I loved the focus on sustainability with this water purifier. Switching to a purifier not only cut down on plastic water bottle usage but also provided a healthier alternative for drinking water. It‚Äôs a win-win for both the planet and the body. The optional hydrogen enrichment feature feels like a luxury, but it‚Äôs fascinating if you‚Äôre someone who geeks out over health innovations.

**Product Competitors**  
While testing the Melissani purifier, I couldn‚Äôt help but compare it to similar water purifiers like the AquaTru Countertop RO System and Waterdrop‚Äôs countertop models. The Melissani stands out with its superior compact design and the inclusion of features like hot water on demand. However, AquaTru‚Äôs interface is slightly more beginner-friendly, and Waterdrop might be more affordable for those with tight budgets. What sets Melissani apart is its all-in-one approach, offering water temperature customization alongside stellar filtration.

**Value Proposition**  
Talking about cost-effectiveness, yes, the initial investment feels significant‚Äîbut that‚Äôs where its advanced features come into play. It shines in long-term convenience, eliminating the ongoing need for bottled water or external filtering solutions. For anyone who prioritizes healthier water and household efficiency, this product feels like a smart way to spend.

1kg88tf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1kg88tf/betterme_vegan_intermittent_fasting/,BetterMe: Vegan Intermittent Fasting,"If you're plant-based and curious about intermittent fasting (IF), you're not alone. While both veganism and IF are popular separately, combining the two can be a powerful‚Äîbut tricky‚Äîapproach to better health and weight loss.

# üå± What Is an Intermittent Fasting Vegan Meal Plan?

It‚Äôs a combo of:

* **Veganism**: No meat, dairy, eggs, or other animal products.
* **Intermittent Fasting**: Cycling between eating windows and fasting periods. Common methods include:
   * **16:8** (eat for 8 hours, fast for 16)
   * **5:2** (eat normally 5 days/week, limit to \~500-600 calories on 2 days)

You follow the fasting method of your choice while sticking 100% to plant-based foods.

# üçΩÔ∏è What to Eat on an Intermittent Fasting Vegan Plan:

**Focus on nutrient-dense, whole foods** during your eating window:

* **Proteins**: Lentils, beans, tofu, tempeh, chickpeas, seitan
* **Whole grains**: Quinoa, brown rice, oats, whole wheat bread/pasta
* **Fruits & veggies**: Especially leafy greens, berries, citrus, root veggies
* **Healthy fats**: Avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil
* **Plant-based milks**: Look for calcium and vitamin D/B12 fortification
* **Drinks for the fasting window**: Water, black coffee, or unsweetened tea

Started with pain mid to upper sternum and just lateral on the right. An almost constant pain and always felt like I needed to pop something. When I coughed it sometimes made it better. Sometimes worse. 

I work in the medical field and definitely believe there is a viral inflammatory reaction that triggers Costo for many people. 

Fast forward‚Äî basically miserable for 2-3 weeks of the month for the last several years. and tried everything from stretching, PT exercises, back posture brace, reflux meds (my PCP was convinced it could be from hiatal hernia, it was not), changing sleep positions, working out less (No chest or back weight lifting)‚Ä¶ nothing worked.

1kg86hg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVReviewLounge/comments/1kg86hg/discover_if_the_sony_xbr65x900f_65inch_4k_tv/,Discover if the Sony XBR65X900F 65-Inch 4K TV lives up to its hype!,"Testing out the Sony XBR65X900F 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED Android TV with Alexa Compatibility was an experience that transformed movie nights into a theater-grade escape. I‚Äôve spent some quality time with this 65-inch stunner, and while it‚Äôs a strong performer in several areas, there are some considerations to keep in mind. Here‚Äôs what stood out to me about this TV.

**Outstanding Picture Quality with Enhanced Technologies**  
The picture quality is where this TV truly shines. I initially tested out a 4K HDR movie, and the clarity almost had me questioning whether my living room wall just turned into a window to another world. This display blends the X1 Extreme Processor with X Reality PRO, making even older content look refreshingly detailed. The HDR performance, complimented by X-Tended Dynamic Range Pro 6X, handles light and dark contrasts so well that shadow-filled scenes retain details without getting muddy. It‚Äôs ideal for anyone who streams a variety of content or enjoys gaming with vivid visuals.

**Smooth Motion for High-Speed Action**  
As a fan of sports and action-packed flicks, I‚Äôve always looked for a TV that can keep up. The X-Motion Clarity technology on this device makes a noticeable difference during fast-paced sequences. No ghosting or blurriness when my friends and I caught some high-speed Formula 1 footage‚Äîit felt smoother than my morning cup of coffee. This same feature came in handy for gaming enthusiasts in the house, especially since the 120 Hz refresh rate enhanced the action-packed gaming experience.  

[Ready to buy Sony XBR65X900F? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://raltv.com/p/b078gzydfk/)

**Stellar Colors with TRILUMINOS Display**  
Colors on this TV are rich and accurate without going overboard. I threw on a nature documentary, and the greens of rainforests and blues of the ocean were nothing short of jaw-dropping. Thanks to the TRILUMINOS display combined with Super Bit Mapping, the color palette seems endless, delivering hues I didn‚Äôt realize regular TVs often botch. Skin tones, sunsets, or even the texture in fabrics‚Äîall looked incredibly natural.

**Voice Control and Smart Features**  
The built-in Google Assistant and compatibility with Alexa take convenience up a notch. I enjoyed being able to bark commands like ‚Äúplay the next episode‚Äù into the remote instead of fumbling with buttons. It integrates seamlessly with my other smart home devices‚ÄîI can dim the lights or check the weather without pausing what I‚Äôm watching. This feature is perfect for multitaskers or anyone who loves making tech do the heavy lifting.

**Multiple Ports for Connectivity**  
Another thing I appreciated while setting this TV up is its variety of inputs. It includes 4 HDMI ports, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 slots, plus a Composite option‚Äîall invaluable for connecting gaming consoles, streaming sticks, and external drives without plugging and unplugging constantly. My home setup tends to get a bit chaotic with devices, so the availability of ports kept the layout clean and functional.

**Performance Highlights**
- Stunning picture clarity with true-to-life colors
- Motion-handling technology perfect for sports and gaming
- Sleek design that looks great in any living room
- Seamless integration with smart home systems
- Ample connectivity options for various devices  

**Areas of Concern**  
That said, not everything about this TV left me spellbound. There are a few areas where I found room for improvement.

- The sound is decent but lacks depth; external audio setup recommended.
- The remote, while functional, feels a bit outdated and clunky.
- Android TV interface can lag occasionally during heavy use.

**Product Competitors**  
I‚Äôve also tested similar models from Samsung and LG, and this one sits nicely in the middle ground. Compared to the LG OLED options, the blacks on this TV, while good, weren‚Äôt as deep, and the viewing angles didn‚Äôt feel as wide. Samsung‚Äôs comparable QLED models excelled at providing brighter images but didn‚Äôt hit the same balance in color fidelity that this smart TV achieves. What the Sony model does better is retaining detail in both light and dark scenarios, thanks to its full array local dimming.

For anyone considering competitors, it comes down to what‚Äôs most important to you. If you prioritize richer blacks and cinematic visuals, OLED might win you over. If budget is tighter, Samsung‚Äôs QLED lineup offers respectable picture quality too but misses out on a few of the Sony‚Äôs finer details.

**Value Proposition**  
Considering the technology packed into this television, it offers serious bang for the buck. Between the gorgeous display, motion clarity, and integration of smart features, this product comfortably stands as a worthwhile investment for cinephiles, gamers, or anyone looking to elevate their at-home content consumption. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest TV in its class, the quality and technology justify its positioning.

I've read these since I was 12, and just now decided to sit down and write. I'm not very good though...too many run-ons, not enough adverbs and adjectives.



Chapter 5

  
I quicky made my way up the wet pavement outside the thirteen story brick building, with my umbrella held tightly to my chest, as the rain poured lightly in a sideways direction that made it hard to avoid getting my freshly ironed clothes wet. The weather had been stormy and chilly the past week with freezing rain off and on making the sidewalks icy and slippery. I had to be careful in my cheap black pointed-toe heels not to trip and break the heel. As soon as I entered the building through the rotating glass doors I glanced at the closest mirror to take in my disheveled, pitiful looking appearance. I really don't know why I had bothered, knowing how the weather was, but I quickly smoothed my white, button-up blouse and tucked it back into my knee-length black pencil skirt; looking around to make sure no one was paying attention. My hair, neatly curled and held back in a half pony tail with a thick black beret, was now stringy and more wavey than curly. I pulled my wet rain coat tighter against my body as I made my way to the elevator to the 9th floor.



The elevator opened to reveal my designated floor and I stepped out and moved over to my cubicle. I noticed that the door to Mr. Braswell's office was closed as usual. Very rarely, was it open as he was usually in the middle of a meeting or conference call. I pressed the intercom button to let him know he had a meeting with Dr. Crowley at 1:00 and his mother had called the day before to ask him for dinner. He listened intently and then I heard a quick ""thank you"" on the other end, before he quickly hung up the receiver. 



The rest of the day was mostly spent finishing up paperwork, and entering financial reports into the computer until lunchtime when Mr. Braswell called me to his office to hand me his business credit card to pick up lunch at the local McDonald's. 



Making my way back up the elevator with two large brown sacks and cupholder in hand, my thoughts suddenly drifted to Cassian. I had not seen or heard much of him since taking the job here. I had visited with Misha a few times for dinner, and saw him once or twice in the office; but that was the most of it. I could visualize it now, he was probably in his office with some beautiful foreign European model hunched over his desk; and probably hadn't given me a second thought since. Finally, the elevator stopped at my floor and I made my way to Mr. Braswell's office.



Just like Cassian, Mr. Braswell was a pretty handsome fellow, with sandy blonde hair, icy blue eyes with a piercing gaze and a neatly trimmed beard to match. He was usually always dressed in a different colored dress shirt with a tie and khakis. I had never seen him in anything less than formal attire, as we were not close outside the office; strictly business. Walking into the office, noticing he wasn't there; I gently laid the bags on the desk as I went through them to pull out my chicken nuggets and French fries with sauce; slowly walking back to my cubicle to eat and take phone calls.



Not fifteen minutes later, Mr. Braswell came rushing by my cubicle as I handed him the credit card, and with a nod and quick 'thank you' he went into the office and quietly shut the door. 



At about 2:15 the telephone rang and as I answered I heard a familiar voice on the other line say:



""Hello Miss, I'm needing to make an appointment with Brittany Rainwater this evening for dinner at 8. My name is Cassian Sexton from the 10th floor up. I see a lovely lady right now in a sexy skirt and white blouse with chicken nuggets all over her desk, and thought she could use a proper meal.""



I couldn't help but laugh at the intrusion, even though it made me a little uncomfortable to know he'd been watching me eat.



""What?!"" I tried to stifle a chuckle.



""I was asking you if you'd like to have dinner with me at my apartment tonight? Is that okay?"" I could almost see him smiling through the phone.



""Well, I guess I could make time...."", I tried to act as if I wasn't just a little bit excited.



""8 o'clock then?""



""Yes, that would be fine. I have to go, I have another call"", I said anxiously as I saw a light start blinking furiously.



""Alright, see you then"", he said before hanging up on me; and I quickly switched to the other line.



The rest of the day passed quickly, and before I knew it the clock read 6:00, so I grabbed my purse and headed back out on the icy pavement; further reminding me that I would need to text Cassian to let him know I'd be needing a taxi or Uber ride to his place.





As I paced quickly on the sidewalk arriving at my destination, I started to get nervous thinking about the evening. I've been on plenty of dates before, and have dabbled around with casual sex, but there was something about him that I couldn't peg. Making my way, anxiously, into the apartment and sitting my purse on the island, I started to wonder if I should change or if I should just touch up my hair a bit and makeup. I didn't want to come across as desperate really, even though he was super sexy and for all I knew it was just a friendly dinner. Men and women both do that don't they? Make wrong assumptions when it comes to encounters with the opposite sex. We assume because a person gets a little too close, it automatically means they want more. Perhaps, we are just too isolated and craving connection that we misread things so easily.



Funny thing is, I knew quite a lot about the ins and outs of sex, though I wasn't an expert; but I rarely shared this much with anyone I thought to myself 'If I can't get love and sex like that, why should you?' A good portion of my life I had spent in holey pajama pants and old t-shirts, barely able to make ends meat; that is, if I wasn't on some form of government assistance. Rarely, did I have money for dress up, high heels, lace, sexy lingerie and beauticians or anything that remotely put me in the mood for anything. Time and time again, I had watched romance movies; watching the couples make love passionately wondering why my life hadn't ever been that way: passionate, unpredictable, sexy...dirty all in one. I wasn't usually a casual sex type thing unless I had been drinking, which sometimes led to a series of very unfortunate events that I'd usually wake up the next day regretting. I, like many other people, just wanted something to hold on to, something real, sweet, fun, and spontaneous.



I walked back into my bedroom and began smoothing the white blouse and black skirt once more until I felt satisfied. Trying to pace myself, I walked into the bathroom and hooked up the hair straightener; waiting until it was heated and going back over the stringy strawberry blonde waves, until the waves were smoothed out into soft longer strands. Gently, placing the hair utensil down and unplugging it, I pulled my makeup out and went with a very clean natural evening look, darkening my eyes a bit to contrast with my pale skin and freckles; and finishing the look by placing the small studs in my ears I guess that would do. 



Satisfied with my appearance, I went into the living room and sat watching a romcom for a half hour until I received a text letting me know my taxi was on it's way. Funny, I had forgotten to text Cassian to tell him I needed a ride; oh how considerate he was.



At a quarter until 8, the taxi arrived to take me to Cassian's apartment on the other side of town. As nervous as I was, my confidence had certainly taken a turning point since I last saw him. I'm not sure if that was necessarily a good or bad thing, but it was nice to not feel so tense all the time; being able to let my hair down a bit and be myself. 



The drive wasn't long, maybe 10-15 minutes; as I mostly just looked out the window watching the pedestrians walking along the icy sidewalk, glad I didn't have to walk this time. The taxi made it's way into a gated entrance and dropped me off in front of a building that looked to be about five stories high. I walked into the lobby heading for an elevator and pushed the button, patiently waiting for the doors to open. The doors opened, and a young couple moved past me giggling and laughing about something. I watched for a few seconds until I heard the elevator start to close slowly almost tip toeing my way in and pushing the button to the designated floor.



'Ding' was the sound I heard as the elevator stopped at Cassian's floor. I walked to the first door I saw and quietly knocked. Suddenly, the door opened to reveal Cassian Sexton in all his glory, looking ""perfect"" as ever, if that was even the right word. Well, ""perfect"" to me anyways. Standing there leaning up against the door,  with a brown t-shirt, and boot-cut pants looking absolutely delicious was the object that I had been invading my thoughts for sometime. Upon further inspection looking down, I notice house slippers. How cute? I suddenly felt almost overdressed. As my eyes made their way back up to his face, I noticed his eyes were following mine with a pair of black framed reading glasses hanging down from his nose.



""Hello again, Miss Brittany...how are you?"" he purred.



""Fine. Thank you"", I replied sarcastically as he moved out of the way and gestured me into the 'living area'.



I looked around the spacious living room for moment noticing the 9ft ceiling, beautifully stacked books on several shelves scattered along the walls; with black leather furniture with oriental ornaments and lamps decorating the tables. I walked up to the bookcases to notice a fine collection of Leo Tolstoy, Mary Shelly, Bram Stoker, Jane Austen, Henry Agrippa, Thomas Harris, Hans Christian Anderson, Charlotte Bronte, Greek Philosophers and mythological literature stacked neatly along the shelves. Curiously, I had wondered if he had read them all or if he was just a collector. Nevertheless, it was a fine collection that anyone would be proud to show off. 



As I looked around the room some more, I noticed an old piano in the corner.



""Do you play?"" I asked, gesturing to the old musical instrument.



""Sometimes, I'm not very good...but it's therapeutic being able to move my fingers along the keys after a long day at work.""



""My mother played some. I never heard her play, but she took lessons when she was younger. I remember looking at pictures of her as a child sitting at the piano, wishing I could learn too; but I never said anything about it"", I replied sadly. It's true, I had tried to play around with the instrument as a child, but could only play a few keys to a few popular well known songs from Disney movies. As my thoughts drifted, I found myself in front of the piano running my fingers lightly across the keys.



""Penny for your thoughts?"" his voice dragged me back to reality.



""Nothing...just thinking"", I responded and then moved over to the leather sofa to sit down in front a coffee table lined with catalogs and Reader's Digest, nervously picking one up and skimming through the pages; as I heard him make his way into the kitchen pulling a few items from the fridge.



""So how do you like your new job?"", he asked from across the room.



""Oh, I like it very much. Mr. Braswell has been very good to me. Thank you"", was all I could manage to get out as I could hear the edge of the blade of a chef's knife quickly chopping and dicing through vegetables; a few minutes later I could hear the sizzling from the pan as the vegetables made their way into the pan.



""You're very welcome"", he said in a smooth tone as I turned my head back to look and saw him smirking at me like a Cheshire cat.



After chatting a bit back and forth about work, I suddenly heard dishes being placed quietly on the table, so I turned around to see him right as he went back into the kitchen while reappearing bringing the food to sit in the middle of the table.



Laying the catalog down, I walked into the dining room and sat in what looked like my 'assigned' chair.



""So he cooks too?"" Feeling a little overwhelmed by the neatly decorated table, arranged dishes and silverware; and the food looked fantastic.



""Sometimes"", he sat across from me smiling as he picked up a dish that looked to be sauteed veggies with mushrooms, and seasoned chicken.



He gently passed the dish to me as I filled my plate, suddenly losing my appetite; not necessarily because the food, but I was starting to feel a little nervous. I didn't say anything, but quietly picked up my fork poking it gently into a belled pepper and onion bringing it to my lips.



""This is amazing.""



""Thank you""



""So what do you do with your time, besides school and work?"" he pried as he stopped eating for a minute to glance across the table.



It paused for a moment before responding.



""I sometimes write erotic short stories."" He cocked his head to this die and squinted one of his eyes as if trying to figure me out.



""Porn"", I continued. ""I write porn"". At my confession he seemed amused and gave me a small smile.



""Well...I write and...read it...."", I found myself rambling and then I went silent.



""Anything interesting?"" he looked at me with a raised eyebrow still not touching his plate.



""Well....I suppose. I also read a lot of amateur romance fiction online and novels. I've done it since I was 12"", I quickly added as I tried to change the subject a bit.



""...And what did you learn?""



I paused for a moment trying to think of an intelligent answer.



""I guess a lot of women are more interested in reading what men think, and men are more interested in what women say? I could be wrong...""



He pondered on that for a minute for turning is attention back to his half eaten plate. All I heard was him mutter a ""Hmmm..."" before grabbing his fork and knife to finish the rest of his food.



After some time passed, we finished our plates; as he slowly moved around the table to start picking up dishes and silverware.



I walked back over to the couch and started fiddling with my hands just standing there, waiting.



He came back into the living room and sat down on the sofa with what looked to be a bottle of an expensive wine; started unscrewing the cork to take a swig straight out of the bottle. I mostly just stood there staring for a minute before sitting down with my hands folded in my lap.



""Want a drink?"" he asked as he passed the bottle and I found myself wrapping my fingers around it pulling it to my lips. 



He chuckled a bit watching my face sour, before he got up and walked over to the bookcase and pulled out what looked like a cigar and some matches. Walking back over to the sofa with the cigar hanging out his lip; he sat down and stared without saying anything.



""What"", suddenly feeling self conscious as I placed the bottle on the coffee table.



His gaze following my movement.



""Why do you keep staring at me?"" I snapped.



""I have another proposition for you,"" he said calmly and then continued:



""I was wondering if you'd like to spend the week with me, here at my place?""



I took some time before finally replying, ""What is this?"", I whispered softly.



""It gets lonely here, and I'd like to be better aquainted with you...""



""You mean sex"", I cut off before he could finish.



""Well, yes...I'm hoping it might lead to something like that"", he said matter of factly as he ran his hand through his dark hair; my gaze following his movement, as I found myself imitating it almost involuntarily, only tucking a few strands nervously behind my ear.



""And what do I get out of the arrangement?""



""Sex, clothes, whatever you like?"" I watched as he placed the cigar in the ashtray.



""I don't know, I should probably be getting home..."", I moved to get up, as I felt a hand lightly pull my arm back to a sitting position.



""Stay"", he said with almost a hint of sadness but quickly masked the vulnerability with a small smile.



""Okay....?"", I didn't really know where this was going, but it was so hard to say no to him especially knowing that after the awkward conversation, I would have to wait for a taxi to return to take me home. Figuring I might as well at least stay the night, I eased back into the sofa not saying anything for a while.



""Just for the night. I'm tired and don't feel like waiting for a taxi...""



""If you say so"", he said as he got up from the couch and walked back toward the kitchen to wash dishes and clean up, I presume.

I found out last week I had a bunch of airline flyer miles about to expire, so I got a ticket to CR without much planning. A big part of it was to have a full medical checkup at Clinica Biblica in San Jose (no health insurance in US due to how much of a ripoff it is if you're in good health), but otherwise I'm open.

I arrive tomorrow (Wed) early afternoon, then the clinic checkup is Thursday morning. I fly back to US around noon next Monday, so I really have Thur afternoon to Sunday afternoon for adventuring. About 9 years ago I did a grad school exchange trip where we stayed in Alajuela, hiked Arenal, visited an organic coffee farm and processing coop, and did a side trip to some beaches on the pacific side near Jaco. I won't be able to rent a car this time since I recently lost my physical credit card and apparently a virtual/google wallet card won't work for deposit.

Since I'll be relying on public transport, I was thinking of just going to Puerto Viejo then renting a bike and staying around there to hang on beaches, hike in parks etc. But I've read it's gotten a bit sketchier in recent years with beach theft and I'm not the biggest fan of tourist towns where most people are drunk white Americans/Europeans. Had been thinking of Manuel Antonio but seems tough to get there and back via bus and maybe quite rainy.

I cook most of the meals for us at home. And while I want to be accommodating I really don‚Äôt want to have the food I cook be spiceless blah all the time. She says I could always add my own heat after cooking, and while that‚Äôs sort of true I honestly believe cooking food in the peppers is a totally different experience than just adding sriracha or whatever after the fact. 

I sneak some red pepper flakes -like barely anything maybe 1/4 tsp. - into pretty much anything I make. And I get away with it like 1/3 of the time in the hopes of building up a tolerance in her. But the other 2/3 she catches me and then it becomes a whole thing. 

So how can I get her to like spicy food? Even on a minor level doesn‚Äôt have to be a fanatic about it. I just wanna cook food that we both like without having to make two separate dishes

Over time we became very close, so did our families and we started to have feelings for eachother, but never dated. It was more like a friends with benefits situation. Back then he had very bad anger issues, we went out together one night with a group of our friends and he came back to my house, we got into an argument and he punched a hole in the wall next to where i was standing. i forgave him and we continued as friends with benefits. fast forward a few months we were at a house party together and I had slept with one of his close friends (this was incredibly stupid of me), he ended up finding out and got SO angry that we locked him out of the house. He rammed his car through the fence saying he was going to find me and kill me. i remember hiding in a cupboard with one of my friends and being on the phone to police. i still went back to him after that and he eventually got a girlfriend and i got a boyfriend.

For 3 years we didn‚Äôt hear from eachother, and he never really crossed my mind. We both got out of our relationships a little over a year ago. A couple of weeks ago he added me on social media and messaged me asking if he could take me out for coffee. I reluctantly agreed and we went out today. Now i sort of feel the same again as how i did all those years ago towards him.

This community, its content, its members and all of your collective contributions have helped shape my experience, increase my knowledge and have enlightened me in a way that has encouraged me to step outside the traditional box of espresso.  

I‚Äôll start by saying that I have been a traditional espresso drinker since the early days when I used to travel to Seattle and when you‚Äôd walk into a Starbucks there and hear baristas bang the portafilter on the trash can.  As I began my recent renaissance, I realized I needed better equipment than my stock Gaggia Classic Pro and Breville Smart Grinder Pro to even get decent traditional espresso shots.  I settled on a Rancilio Silvia Pro X and a DF64 Gen 2 grinder.  After getting everything dialed in I was pulling consistent ‚Äúgod‚Äù shots every morning.  

As  I learned more about different beans and how to brew them here, I wanted to find out what all the fuss was about with light and medium roast beans.  I‚Äôd tried them in the past at specialty coffee shops and at home and thought they were sour and disgusting.  Fast forward to my buying some medium roast beans from two different local roasters in my area and the key to unlocking what you all rave about was the proper brew temp and using pre-infusion or soft infusion on my SPX.  Wow!  Those were the best non-traditional Italian roast shots this girl has ever tasted!  Better than brewed at the coffee shops.

# My Experience

**Birth Story**

my baby was born at 37w0d via c-section after a not great birth experience. I‚Äôd developed gestational hypertension at 34 weeks so an induction was planned. my water broke on the morning of 10/14 - or rather, the forebag of the amniotic sac broke and it made me test positive for amniotic fluid so I was admitted. I was given 2 steroid shots 24hrs apart for baby‚Äôs lung development since she was a little early. my water finished breaking (in classic ‚Äúomg there is now a puddle under me‚Äù movie fashion) early on 10/16. misoprositol for cervical ripening & pitocin for labor induction were given to me that day, but after 24hrs, labor stalled at 5cm. in that 24hrs, I‚Äôd developed severe pre-eclampsia (bp was 187/110 at one point and the nurse thought she‚Äôd made a mistake until she took it again lol) and was put on labetelol to lower my bp & magnesium to prevent seizures. the magnesium was ROUGH, and I had to lie down, making contractions unbearable since I couldn‚Äôt move, so I got an epidural. was taken in for a c-section at 12:10pm 10/17 and baby was out by 12:28pm. didn‚Äôt get discharged until 10/21 because my bp wouldn‚Äôt stabilize until they gave me a second bp med. and i gotta say, after never being admitted to a hospital for anything in my life, an 8 day stay in one with at one point 2 IVs was surreal.

I tell you my birth story because I think it‚Äôs important for context. I was not planning on doing any pumping at all at first but was forced to (‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùforced‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù in that I put the pressure on myself to feed her BM exclusively) because my LO was jaundice and the bilirubin needed flushed out. I think because she was born at 37 weeks, while technically early/full term and not premie, her suckling skills were not quite there yet. she started losing weight rapidly, as many babies do in the beginning, and the docs had us supplement her nursing sessions with 30mL/1 oz of BM.¬†

**Timeline**

I nursed and pumped for 2ish months before switching to EP for the last 4.5ish months. I did start combo feeding at 4 months - 1oz of formula + 4oz BM for each bottle and holy hell has that decreased my stress a whole lot.

# Equipment & Set Up

* I have the [Spectra S1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DBKFFJM?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_8) as my main pump. It‚Äôs great. Highly recommend.
* But my main pump USED to be the [MomCozy S12 Pro](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB3W8MRB?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_14). It was also great! ‚Ä¶for about a month. But as it turns out, as nice as hands-free pumps are for convenience & not being strapped to a bunch of fucking tubes, they really should not be your main pump. And after using it 8x a day for a month straight, I started having‚Ä¶ issues. I was not being fully drained, which caused clogs, which caused painful lumps that had to be massaged out. This is when I started a lot of troubleshooting‚Ä¶

**Replacement Parts**

* [silicone duck valves and backstop protectors](https://www.amazon.com/Maymom-Compatible-Duckbill-Silicone-Replacement/dp/B08Q7CL35R/ref=sr_1_9?crid=24FOGCX2K53XO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.K-IJbraPqWDhvC7IxPf_QrQ3Jaz-fMXgdW7-0Lkagabl198d5G6ekdQjE9o73zrItsCT2GgNdYna75NWPzvJDntLVV2l___yNSdyTQAIGx2r0JuO4eMhZ8yYyqeZ61bSGUVxzk-aNgu_zQyhtk5EILYuSuLVseX6rnNn6GzGj-tXdMJF2NgECCL7owUicykFsVih9pgS81GRH31fzkQ9fXTOKPupUIgTzpj5WKujNqkX5W9X_oO24pRCyJdgvSpcvkWFGfmt-UiCfn14xLkaMkukalDXfSynUzq4-ymwAek.VRP4WTjUxFdELaYHNds_6i1trGgFVoagMpYGRQ4IVCg&dib_tag=se&keywords=spectra%2Breplacement%2Bpump%2Bparts&qid=1746545906&s=baby-products&sprefix=spectra%2B%2Cbaby-products%2C122&sr=1-9&th=1) \- these need to be replaced fairly regularly - like once every 1-2 months for the valves and once every 2-3 months for the backstop protectors. I will say, I think this will be different depending on the company/pump. My Spectra duck valves have lasted WAY longer than my MomCozy ones.¬†
   * how do you know when they actually need replacing? you‚Äôll notice you‚Äôre not being drained as efficiently & the actual pumping may sound different, too. I recommend comparing how it feels to put the old duck valve on compared to a new one. you‚Äôll likely notice a stark difference in the silicone‚Äôs integrity. it‚Äôll just feel ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to put the old one on.
   * the hard plastic parts may still need replacing at some point. keep an eye out for cracks - one of my MomCozy cups cracked maybe four months in, making it virtually useless. I‚Äôve been solely using the Spectra ever since with no issues.

**Flange size**

* What even is a flange, you may wonder? It‚Äôs the piece of plastic/silicone that actually touches your breast. Like bras, one size DOES NOT fit all, and it‚Äôs crazy how much of a difference it makes.¬†
* To get the correct flange size, you need to measure across the BASE of your nipple (NOT including the areola - don‚Äôt make that mistake unless you want to panic about having monstrous-sized nipples‚Ä¶ this may or may not have happened to me lmao). Then use that measurement to refer to whatever size chart the company uses for their pump/part. Pumps/parts often come with a nipple size ruler, too - keep them!!¬†
* Tips for correct sizing:
   * make sure your nipple is ‚Äúperky‚Äù/hard, like you‚Äôd want it to be if you were gonna nurse
   * measure it BEFORE you pump. this is crucial because your nipples WILL be bigger right after pumping.¬†
   * measure BOTH nipples, because they may be slightly different sizes. (my right is slightly bigger than my left, for example.)
   * your measurement DOES NOT always equal the same flange size and will depend on the company. (it‚Äôs like how you can be a size 10 in one brand of pants but a size 12 in another. isn‚Äôt the lack of standardization grand?)
   * your measurement MIGHT CHANGE OVER TIME. another joy of postpartum life <3
   * Once you know your size for the specific company you are purchasing from, you can either buy [different flanges entirely](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CYPFF53J?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3) or [flange inserts](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFR7SZZD?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_9) that fit snug within the flange (if you‚Äôre a smaller size than the original flange, anyway).
   * Depending on the elasticity of your nipples ‚Äî meaning how stretchy they are or how far they can extend into the flange ‚Äî you may need to play around with flange size. This brings me to my last point:
* PUMPING SHOULD NOT BE PAINFUL/UNCOMFORTABLE. It should seriously just feel like a gentle tugging. If you‚Äôre feeling pain from your nipple, it‚Äôs very likely it‚Äôs because you are using the wrong flange size. Please note the pain I‚Äôm talking about here does not include that from lumps/mastitis/clogs.¬†

**Flanges**

* Even with the correct flange size, I found the hard plastic flanges that came with the Spectra pump just straight up not very comfortable if I wanted to get a good seal. I switched to using [softer silicone flanges made by Lactek](https://www.lacteck.com/collections/store/products/4th-gen-babymotion-flange-one-pair?variant=44949849080129&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21195888397&gbraid=0AAAAADsrakMyDcAQ6gbvZ5sQTxe2BB9gV&gclid=Cj0KCQjw5ubABhDIARIsAHMighYje4lVrhdleeQ2X_Zu05p5oLWMQ6tT3ON88NBUcJgPbILaRp8s758aAvG8EALw_wcB). I saw an immediate increase in production, too - highly recommend!
* Note, if you have a Spectra and get the Lactek flanges, you‚Äôll need a Spectra [adapter/wide mouth connector](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D37J8QN2?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_5), too.¬†

**Nipple balm/cream**

* Especially in the beginning when I was nursing AND pumping, [nipple balm](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X53WM1H?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3&th=1) was a godsend. I'd put it on before pumping to prevent chafing if my nipples were already sensitive. Lanolin nipple cream works well too, though I generally liked putting that on after. I did notice after a few months though that I no longer needed to use either.

**Pumping Bras**

* I don‚Äôt use one. Here‚Äôs why:
* When I first got the Spectra, I was already using a [nursing bra](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076P5FB3M?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2) (bought at the end of pregnancy since I planned on nursing - lol), so I decided to get a [front-zip pumping bra that could go over the nursing bra](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004S8MGHU?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_6). It even came with straps for additional support, which I absolutely need (normally a US D cup, currently a DD/E). Getting all setting up - putting on the bra, putting the flanges in the holes, getting the flanges comfortably on me - took extra time, like 5-10 minutes. Maybe the 5 minutes doesnt seem like a big deal, but 5mins x 6-8 times a day catches up to you. To put it simply, it felt like an annoying waste of time.¬†
* Another reason: I found massaging and/or gently doing hand compressions was more efficient than just letting the pump do its thing. It also helped me feel for any lumps that were forming and take care of them before they could be a problem.
* And finally: because I like to do the massaging, it‚Äôs much easier to massage a boob without a bra in the way, or for that matter, pump parts. This brings me to my last point about equipment/set up:

**I pump one boob at a time. Seems like a waste of time? Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not:**

* Makes it easier to massage as I pump. One hand holding the bottle/flange, one massaging my boob. Massaging ‚Äî> increase in pumping efficiency ‚Äî> time saved & more milk produced.
* Uses half the pump parts, leaving the other half for future pumps. If you are filling up the bottle with one boob, simply transfer the milk to a storage bottle/bag and continue with the other boob.
* No extra set up or special bra needed. I just pull up my shirt, pull down one side of my bra, and pump. I started doing it this way around 2.5 months in and couldn‚Äôt believe it took me so long to figure out.
* NO LUMPS. EVER. Seriously, in the last four months, I‚Äôve had maybe two times when I‚Äôve felt lumps starting to form and within the day I was able to massage them out and get unclogged. No lumps means no time spent trying to get unclogged with the haaka or using heatpads before or ice packs after pumping. I‚Äôd argue pumping one boob at a time is actually a time SAVER rather than a waste of time.

**tl;dr:** hands-free pumps should not be your main pump, replace parts when needed, check and recheck flange size, switch from hard plastic to silicone flanges, forgo the pumping bra and pump one boob at a time!",2,1746546717.0,ExclusivelyPumping,2,0.75,False

* Issaquah hiker has close call with black bear family:Alexander Polt spotted a mother black bear and her cubs while hiking the Puget Power Trail in Issaquah, documenting the encounter in a video that gained significant attention online. He described the moment as adrenaline-inducing, noting the bear's non-aggressive behavior. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife reported nearly 1,500 bear-related calls last year, highlighting concerns about bears scavenging in populated areas. Local mountain biker Vince Haag emphasized the importance of being aware of wildlife in the area, particularly during spring. Officials warn that bears losing their fear of humans due to access to food sources can become a public safety risk. Residents are advised to secure garbage and take down bird feeders to mitigate these risks.[(info)](https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/hikers-black-bear-issaquah?utm_source=seastside.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=seastside-newsletter-68)
* Ten Years Without McNugget:A decade has passed since Issaquah lost its quirky rooster, McNugget, who was known for roaming the downtown area and charming locals. He became a community mascot, often seen at a coffee stand where residents fed him and shared fond stories. Tragically, McNugget died in an accident involving a neighborhood dog in April 2015, prompting widespread mourning in the community. A makeshift memorial filled with flowers and notes appeared at the coffee shop, reflecting his impact on locals. Today, his legacy continues through shared memories and a statue in his honor. The community takes a moment to remember the personality that brightened their days.[(info)](https://www.issaquahwa.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=6089&utm_source=seastside.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=seastside-newsletter-68)

""We don't control the battlefield, Colonel. We just observe it. Until now.""

The subterranean complex was silent, but not still. Beneath the weather-worn Air Force proving ground in the Nevada desert, the command center of the Orbital Surveillance and Threat Response Command (OSTRC) pulsed with quiet urgency. Monitors tracked hundreds of orbital assets‚Äîcivilian, military, foreign, and compromised. The air held a faint electrical hum, as if the servers themselves were tense with anticipation.

Technical Sergeant Wade Manning rubbed his bloodshot eyes as he stared at the monitoring station. Third shift always felt the longest, especially when nothing happened. He reached for his coffee mug‚Äîlukewarm and bitter, just like his ex-wife's goodbye.

""Another quiet night,"" he muttered to himself. ""Thank God for small mercies.""

The words had barely left his lips when the perimeter alert flashed. Manning straightened in his chair, suddenly alert. An unauthorized vehicle had just passed the outer checkpoint.

""Security breach at Gate 7,"" announced the automated system.

Manning's fingers flew across the keyboard. ""Identify vehicle.""

""Unmarked government sedan,"" replied the system. ""Clearance code: Gibson-Alpha-Seven-Niner.""

Manning froze. Everyone in the facility knew that code. It belonged to the commanding officer‚Äîa man who rarely made appearances before noon, and never without advance notice.

""Alert the watch officer,"" Manning said, already reaching for the secure line. ""Colonel Gibson is on site.""

In the middle of the command center stood a slowly rotating hologram of the solar system, scaled to include a perimeter extending just past Saturn. Glowing red anomalies drifted like dying embers among the celestial bodies, each tagged with tracking numbers and threat assessments.

Colonel Russel Gibson entered with the unhurried confidence of someone long accustomed to bad news. In his mid-fifties, his features bore the lean, weathered precision of a man carved by decades of classified wars. His short steel-gray hair was combed in a no-nonsense military part, the sharp creases in his uniform offset by the faint lines etched beneath his deep-set green eyes. A scar ran just behind his left ear‚Äîan artifact of an incident never filed in any known service report.

As he approached the command center entrance, Gibson paused momentarily, his hand unconsciously rising to the back of his neck. His fingers pressed against a spot where his hairline concealed a nearly invisible scar. Within microseconds, his classified implant activated, interfacing remotely with the facility's security systems.

The security panel beside the door flickered as it detected the unique quantum signature emanating from the implant. A secondary scan analyzed Gibson's biosignature, comparing it against stored parameters before confirming his identity. The heavy doors slid open silently, recognizing him on a level beyond conventional identification.

Born in Bakersfield, California, to a second-generation military family, Gibson had served in three branches, transferred through four different intelligence programs, and still managed to make himself indispensable. His voice was low and deliberate, the kind that made people lean in to listen. He carried no rank insignia. No one here needed reminding who he was.

Lieutenant Dwayne Phillips scrambled to his feet as Gibson entered the monitoring station. ""Sir, we weren't expecting you until‚Äî""

""Save it, Phillips,"" Gibson cut him off without breaking stride. ""Where's Khan?""

""Analysis Section, sir. She's been there all night.""

Gibson nodded once. No surprise there. Specialist Amina Khan rarely left her post these days, not since they'd detected the first anomalous readings near Jupiter three weeks ago.

As he moved through the facility, personnel straightened at their stations. Some saluted. Most simply nodded, knowing Gibson preferred efficiency to formality. The Colonel had never been one for military pageantry. Even his uniform‚Äîmeticulously pressed but devoid of ribbons or decorations‚Äîspoke to his preference for substance over show.

The Analysis Section was separated from the main command floor by a series of security checkpoints. Each one recognized Gibson biometrically‚Äîretinal scan, gait analysis, even the unique electrical signature of his neural implant, a classified piece of tech that fewer than fifty people in the world knew existed.

 The Analysis Section looked more like a university physics lab than a military installation. Holographic displays filled the air with swirling data patterns. Quantum processing stacks hummed along the walls, their cooling systems creating an artificial breeze that ruffled the papers scattered across the central workstation.

Specialist Amina Khan was already standing when he approached the central table. Slender, sharp-featured, with high cheekbones and intense dark eyes, she wore her uniform with a meticulousness that bordered on obsessive. Her black hair was tied into a tight bun, and her caramel skin caught the dim light of the displays like bronze under glass. She moved with crisp, deliberate control‚Äînever fidgeting, never second-guessing. At just twenty-eight, she was one of the youngest analysts ever cleared for Tier-2 operations, but her resume read like a DoD myth: top of her class at Georgia Tech, a brief stint at JPL, followed by three years in DARPA's quantum modeling division‚Äîuntil Gibson personally recruited her. She'd broken OSTRC's object occlusion algorithm on a bet, then redesigned it over a weekend. Gibson trusted her instincts as much as her code.

""Talk to me, Khan,"" he said, stopping beside her.

She didn't seem surprised by his early arrival. In fact, she looked as if she'd been expecting him.

""Sir, I was about to call you."" She tapped the console, bringing Jupiter into focus. ""Another spike, sir. Third this month. Same signature‚Äîgravitic displacement, cloaked in cosmic noise.""

""Where?"" Gibson's eyes narrowed as he studied the display.

""Callisto. Same triangulation we saw before, lined with Ganymede and Europa. Look.""

She layered the signals and phased them to real-time. Three subtle disruptions appeared in orbit. Barely perceptible distortions‚Äîbut repeating, deliberate. Patterns only machines could detect. Or Khan.

Gibson folded his arms. ""You run it through the correlation net?""

She nodded. ""Cross-checked with civilian astronomic stations, recon birds, even that old Russian grav-lens platform in decaying orbit. Everything confirms it's artificial."" Her voice dropped slightly. ""They're not moving. Just... parked.""

""Capital ships."" Gibson's tone was flat, matter-of-fact, but his knuckles whitened as he gripped the edge of the console.

""That's my read."" Khan pulled up a three-dimensional rendering of the anomalies, highlighting their consistent positioning relative to Jupiter's moons. ""The gravitational footprint matches what we'd expect from vessels of significant mass.""

Gibson remained silent for several long seconds, jaw tight. Then he turned to her. ""You remember why I recruited you?""

Khan blinked, momentarily thrown by the apparent non sequitur. ""Because I always win my bets?"" A few of the team quietly giggled.

He gave the faintest smirk. ""That, and you don't talk nonsense."" He looked around at the team. Many of them looking slightly confused by her explanation. ""Can you translate for the Earthlings?""

Khan straightened, switching smoothly to what her colleagues called her ""classroom mode."" She tapped the display, enlarging Jupiter and its moons.

""Okay, here's what we're seeing in simple terms,"" she began. ""Normally, gravity around a moon creates a predictable pattern ‚Äì like ripples in a pond when you drop a stone. What we're detecting are disruptions in these patterns that don't match natural phenomena. It's as if someone placed invisible objects in orbit around three of Jupiter's moons.""

She highlighted the anomalies with bright markers that made them more visible. ""These disturbances are too regular to be natural and too consistent to be sensor ghosts. They're maintaining fixed positions relative to each moon, which requires propulsion ‚Äì natural objects don't just 'park' in orbit and stay there.""

Khan gestured to the data streams flowing along the side of the display. ""We've confirmed this with multiple independent systems, including civilian telescopes that wouldn't recognize what they're seeing. Whatever's causing these gravity wells has the mass of a large vessel but isn't reflecting light or emitting normal radiation. They're using active camouflage ‚Äì bending light and other energy around them.""

She zoomed in on one of the anomalies. ""And here's the clincher ‚Äì they're communicating. The energy patterns we're detecting show clear signs of deliberate transmission, complete with encryption patterns we've seen before in Grey technology. These aren't asteroids or sensor glitches. They're ships, they're hiding, and they're talking to something deeper in space.""

Gibson's eyes narrowed. ""Show me.""

Khan's fingers danced across the display, calling up a visualization of signal patterns detected over time. ""Here's the first anomaly we detected four months ago. Sporadic, seemingly random emissions. But look at the pattern now‚Äî""

The display shifted, showing the current readings. The emissions had become rhythmic, organized into distinct clusters with regular intervals between them.

""It's a conversation,"" Gibson murmured.

""Or orders,"" Khan suggested. ""Commands being relayed from somewhere beyond our detection range.""

Gibson straightened. ""I need to make a call. Keep digging. I want to know everything about these signals‚Äîdirection, frequency patterns, energy signatures. And Khan?""

She looked up from her console. ""Sir?""

""This stays in this room. Classification level: Midnight Black.""

Khan nodded, understanding the implication. Midnight Black was a classification level so restricted that even acknowledging its existence was grounds for immediate detention. Whatever they had discovered, it had just become one of the most closely guarded secrets on the planet.

""Yes, sir. Midnight Black.""



[October 15, 2037 | 0830 Hours | Secure Communications Vault, OSTRC Complex]

Gibson stepped into the secure transmission vault, sealed behind layers of biometric locks. The walls shimmered slightly with quantum-field encryption, air recycled every twenty seconds to avoid signal bleed. This was where the most sensitive communications in the complex took place‚Äîwhere decisions that might alter the course of human history were made without public knowledge or consent.

He approached the communications terminal, his implant once again interfacing with the system before he physically touched it. The neural connection allowed him to prepare the transmission parameters with unprecedented precision, establishing security protocols that would make the communication virtually untraceable.

He keyed in the priority code and dictated his report, his voice steady despite the implications of what he was about to relay.



""This is Colonel Russel Gibson, Director of OSTRC. We've identified three anomalous gravitational fields in synchronous orbital positions around the Jovian system‚ÄîGanymede, Callisto, and Europa. Predictive telemetry and matched signatures indicate high probability of concealed Grey vessels, most likely heavy cruisers or staging platforms.""

He paused, choosing his next words carefully. The ""Greys""‚Äîthe classification term for the non-terrestrial entities first confirmed in 1947 following the Roswell incident‚Äîhad maintained a pattern of observation and occasional abduction for years. But this was different. This was coordinated military positioning.



""Requesting immediate assessment and clearance for defensive asset mobilization. Recommend activation of Gen 6 interceptor protocols, NORAD elevation, and surface-to-orbit readiness drills. This does not appear to be a probing maneuver. Pattern suggests staging. They're preparing for a full breach.""

Gibson studied the holographic rendering of Jupiter hovering before him. The gas giant seemed peaceful, serene even‚Äîits swirling storms and bands of color betraying nothing of the potential threat lurking in the orbits of its moons.



""Recommend orbital watch status be raised to Tier-2.""

He paused before closing the channel. His tone shifted slightly‚Äîgraver, quieter.



""We're not ready. Not for this. But if we don't act now, we may not get another chance.""

After sending the transmission, Gibson remained in the vault, his reflection ghostly in the polished surface of the communication terminal. He thought about the implication of his request‚Äîthe resources it would divert, the panic it might cause if word leaked to the civilian population. But the alternative was unthinkable.

His hand unconsciously rose to the back of his neck, fingers tracing the nearly invisible scar where the Grey implant had been inserted eight years ago. The implant that might still be monitoring him, reporting his activities to those distant vessels orbiting Jupiter's moons.

The same implant that UDI scientists had modified, transforming it from a surveillance device into humanity's most classified technological advantage.

For a brief moment,  Gibson's mind flashed back to eight years ago‚Äîthe night everything changed.



He had been on routine patrol at a remote military installation, the stars unusually bright overhead. His comms had suddenly gone dead, cutting him off from headquarters. Strange lights had appeared in the sky, hovering silently before descending.

Then the paralysis had hit him‚Äîan invisible force that locked every muscle in place as a beam of blue-white light engulfed him. He'd felt himself lifted, floating helplessly upward into the waiting craft.

Inside, bound by forces he couldn't see or comprehend, Gibson hovered suspended in mid-air. The chamber was clinically sterile, lit by a diffuse glow that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere.

A Grey had entered‚Äîtaller than the ones in popular depictions, with elongated limbs and six fingers on each hand. Its large, black eyes had studied Gibson with cold intelligence as it approached.

Without speaking aloud, it had begun questioning him, the words appearing directly in Gibson's mind with painful clarity.

""Your evolutionary divergence. Explain.""

Gibson had been confused, disoriented. ""What divergence? What are you talking about?""

The Grey's frustration had manifested as a spike of pain behind Gibson's eyes. ""The alteration in your species' development pattern. The anomalous neural structures. Where did you acquire them?""

""I don't understand,"" Gibson had managed through the pain. ""We evolved naturally on Earth.""

The alien's annoyance had been palpable. ""Deception is futile. Your brain contains structures inconsistent with your evolutionary timeline. You will reveal the source.""

It had moved behind Gibson then, something metallic and cold in its six-fingered hand. A searing pain had exploded at the base of his skull as the implant was inserted where his spine connected to his brain.

""This will monitor. This will extract truth.""

The mental invasion that followed had been excruciating‚Äîthe Grey attempting to pry apart his thoughts, searching for information Gibson didn't possess. In desperation, he had fought back the only way he could, flooding his own mind with memories of his worst combat experiences‚Äîthe pain, the fear, the trauma he'd spent years trying to forget.

The Grey had recoiled, screeching in unexpected pain as Gibson's traumatic memories transferred through the newly established connection.

Before leaving, it had planted one final thought in Gibson's mind: ""I will watch you. You will lead me to it.""



The comms officer's voice came through the speaker. ""Message sent, sir. Encryption protocol Shadowcast engaged. Estimated response time: two to three hours minimum.""

""Acknowledged. I'll be in my office.""



[October 15, 2037 | 1130 Hours | Gibson's Office, OSTRC Complex]

Gibson sat at his desk, surrounded by the trappings of a career spent in the shadows. The walls held no photographs, no personal mementos‚Äîonly framed maps of various celestial bodies and a single abstract painting that depicted what might have been a solar flare, or perhaps a mushroom cloud. The ambiguity seemed fitting.

A knock at the door pulled him from his thoughts.

""Enter.""

Khan stepped inside, a data tablet clutched in her hand. ""Sir, I've completed the signal analysis you requested. There's something you need to see.""

Gibson gestured to the chair across from his desk. ""Show me.""

She sat down and placed the tablet between them, triggering a holographic display. ""The communication patterns weren't just regular‚Äîthey were building. Increasing in frequency and complexity over the past week. And then...""

The hologram showed a sudden spike in activity, followed by complete silence.

""They stopped?"" Gibson frowned.

""Eighteen minutes ago,"" Khan confirmed. ""All three vessels simultaneously ceased emissions.""

Gibson leaned back in his chair. ""They received their orders.""

""That's my assessment, sir. Whatever they were waiting for... it's happening now.""

Before Gibson could respond, his secure communication terminal chimed. ""Incoming transmission from Strategic Command. Priority Alpha.""

Gibson glanced at Khan. ""That was fast. Too fast.""

""Sir?""

""They should still be debating my recommendation. A response this quick means‚Äî""

""They already knew,"" Khan finished, her eyes widening with realization.

Gibson nodded grimly. ""Exactly. Stay here.""

He activated the terminal, and the screen flared to life. The seal of U.S. Space Force Strategic Command hovered for a moment, then faded to reveal General Renata Halvorsen.

She was in her early sixties, but looked younger‚Äîsharp jawline, silver-streaked auburn hair cropped to regulation length, and striking ice-blue eyes that missed nothing. Her posture was flawless, her shoulders squared in a matte-black general's uniform with no unnecessary ornamentation. Her voice was calm, clipped, and steel-edged‚Äîlike a blade sheathed in velvet. A first-generation immigrant from Norway, Halvorsen had been one of the architects behind the reformation of the U.S. military's orbital doctrine. She rose through Air Force Intelligence before being tapped for Space Force leadership, and her fingerprints were on nearly every black-budget space program in the last twenty years. She didn't speak unless there was a reason. And when she did, people listened. Presidents included.

""Colonel Gibson,"" she said without preamble. ""You were right. They're not staging‚Äîthey've been in position longer than we realized. And we weren't going to tell you this yet, but given your findings... it's time.""

Gibson's expression remained neutral, but Khan noted the slight tensing of his shoulders‚Äîthe only outward sign of his surprise.

""Time for what, General?""

She tapped a control. A three-dimensional schematic unfolded between them. Gibson's brow furrowed.

What he saw was not a satellite array. Not a ground-to-air defense grid.

It was a warship.

Sleek. Dark. Angular. Its hull bore a name: USS DEIMOS.

""My God,"" Khan whispered, momentarily forgetting protocol.

Halvorsen's eyes flicked to her, then back to Gibson. ""Project Aether has been in development since 2019. A joint effort between NATO and a few of our less-official partners. We've been retrofitting orbital platforms using salvaged Grey tech since the early 2000s. Deimos is the first destroyer-class vessel capable of deep-space maneuver and autonomous combat coordination. She's armed with advanced interceptor wings, drone deployment bays, and a dedicated AI warfare system.""

Gibson's expression didn't change, but his silence was telling.

""You're to relocate your entire OSTRC command team to the Deimos,"" Halvorsen continued, her tone brooking no argument. ""Effective immediately. Your operations will shift to orbital deployment. You're no longer just observing threats, Colonel. You're going to help neutralize them.""

""What's the payload?"" Gibson asked, his military mind immediately focusing on offensive capabilities.

""Classified. But I'll give you a name: Hyperion torpedoes. The Deimos is carrying six. That's all you get unless R&D gets a miracle.""

Gibson nodded once, absorbing the information.

""Report to Falcon Station within twenty-four hours,"" she added. ""Transport is en route. Congratulations, Colonel. You've just been reassigned to the first warship in human history designed for space-to-space combat.""

The transmission ended, leaving Gibson and Khan in stunned silence.

""Sir,"" Khan finally said, her voice barely audible. ""Did you know about this?""

Gibson shook his head slowly. ""No. Not about Deimos."" He turned to face her fully. ""But I suspected something was in development. Too many resources disappearing into black projects. Too many brilliant minds being recruited and then vanishing from public view.""

""And now we're being deployed to space."" Khan's voice held a mixture of awe and apprehension. ""On a warship.""

""Not just deployed,"" Gibson corrected. ""We're being activated. There's a difference.""

""Sir?""

Gibson's eyes were distant, calculating. ""OSTRC was never just an observation post, Khan. It was always intended to be the nerve center of something bigger. We weren't watching the stars just to catalog threats‚Äîwe were gathering intelligence for the day we'd have to fight back.""

""And that day is now,"" Khan said quietly.

""That day is now,"" Gibson confirmed. He stood, decision made. ""Gather the senior staff. Priority recall for all off-duty personnel. We have twenty-four hours to prepare for orbital deployment.""

""Yes, sir."" Khan rose to leave, but paused at the door. ""Colonel... do you think we're ready for this? For what's coming?""

Gibson considered the question for a long moment. ""No. But neither are they. They've been watching us for decades, studying our weaknesses. But they've never seen us fight back. Not really.""

A ghost of a smile crossed his face‚Äînot warm, not reassuring, but determined. Predatory.

""Time to show them what they've been missing.""



[October 15, 2037 | 2345 Hours | OSTRC Hangar Bay] 

Later, as the first of his analysts packed up data cores and long-range telemetry nodes, Gibson stood alone in the OSTRC hangar, reading over the Deimos' partial spec sheet on his secured tablet.

Three interceptor wings. AI-assisted flight and targeting. Drone swarm integration. Hyperion torpedo launch system. Everything he didn't know Earth was ready to build‚Äîand everything the Greys never expected them to.

It was more than he'd dared hope for.

Staff Sergeant Elena Martinez approached, carrying a stack of secured hard drives. ""Sir, the last of the data cores are being prepped for transport. We'll be ready to move out at 0500.""

Gibson nodded. ""Good work, Sergeant. How's the team holding up?""

Martinez hesitated. ""Nervous, sir. Excited, but nervous. Most of them joined OSTRC to monitor threats, not to... well, engage them.""

""And you, Sergeant? How are you feeling about all this?""

She straightened slightly. ""Ready to serve, sir.""

Gibson studied her for a moment, then nodded. ""Honesty, Martinez. That's what I need from my people right now.""

She relaxed slightly. ""Honestly, sir? I'm terrified. But also... relieved, in a way. We've been watching these things for so long, knowing they were out there, wondering when they'd make their move. At least now we're doing something about it.""

""That we are, Sergeant. That we are.""

After she left, Gibson looked up through the massive hangar ceiling, where the stars hung invisible above tons of concrete and desert. For thirty years, he'd watched them. Tracked shadows. Interpreted whispers. Wondered what war might look like when it finally came.

Now he knew.

He thought of his father‚Äîcareer Air Force, who'd told him stories of cold war standoffs and the constant vigilance required to maintain peace through strength. He thought of his grandfather, who'd flown bombers in World War II, facing an enemy whose technology had been roughly equivalent to his own.

This would be different. They were outmatched, outgunned, dealing with technology so advanced it sometimes seemed like magic. But humans had one advantage the Greys might not have anticipated: the stubborn refusal to go quietly into extinction.

And perhaps another advantage‚Äîone he couldn't share even with his closest colleagues. The modified Grey implant at the base of his skull, transformed from surveillance device to interface technology that might prove decisive in the coming conflict.

""We watched the sky for too long,"" Gibson murmured. ""Now it's time they watched us back.""

He closed the file and headed toward the personnel transport area. In less than six hours, he would leave Earth's surface, possibly for the last time. The thought should have troubled him more than it did. But as he walked through the corridors of the facility he had commanded for nearly a decade, what he felt wasn't regret or nostalgia.

It was purpose.

I've seen a few posts mentioning it but not much else. For background info, I've had Covid confirmed 4 times and presented with Parosmia during og Covid after a brief period of being unable to smell. Things like coffee, vinegar, garlic etc all started to taste and smell like rotting garbage. Couldn't stomach the stuff. It's been this way up until around September of 2024 when it had largely gone down to a bearable level, it was manageable. 

Then, about 2ish months later I started smelling this burnt tobacco/cigarette smell that no one else could smell. I don't smoke and it's a clear difference from ""fresh"" cigarette smoke that you smell when near a smoker. At first I thought it was maybe just me smelling my sweat, or a food, or something tied to my parosmia, but the smell of things affected by parosmia largely stayed unchanged, still the same garbage smell. I just wrote it off and tried to move past it, but I've continued to smell these phantom smells at greater frequency, and with some variety. Just the cigarette smoke smell turned to sickly sweet bad-perfume smells, burnt rubber, the likes. It's been driving me crazy and I have tried to eliminate things from my diet, I've searched around the house frantically trying to look for a potential source of the smell (which in hindsight was pretty irrational considering I smell this outside of the house as well, but oh well) to no avail.

Twelve years. For twelve years Ahmad had suffered. From being the top detective and the centre of attention of the town to now handing out parking tickets. The case of Clara still haunted him.  
She was the bank manager's secretary. The poor woman's body was found in a ditch 30 miles away. The people demanded a scapegoat... Ahmad.  
Everyone abandoned him. His detective partner Mahd left him. The mayor did not even bat an eye.  
For the past twelve years he collected every shred of evidence he could find.  
He even interviewed the bank manager. Although the manager did not speak, there was a fear in his tone. The kind that eats you from the inside out.  
Out of options and desperate, Ahmad decided to break into the mayor's office. After searching through coffee-stained files, and various monotone laws, he finally discovered what he wanted. An unmarked file. The file contained the order to silence all those who had been compromised. Alongside this it also contained property records. What could they have in common?  
The realization hit him harder than a hammer. The property records, the secretary's mysterious death, and the mayor's recent extravagant purchase of a new mansion. It all pointed to Abdullah.  
Ahmad filed a formal case against Abdullah for his corruption.  
He was scared, his heart was beating so fast he thought It would jump out and run away.  
He couldn't back down, not at the last moment. He knew that he had to overcome his fear in order to win.  
Inside the courtroom, Ahmad's gaze met Abdullah's. There was fire in his eyes. Abdullah sat cramped in the middle of his posh legal team while Ahmad sat with his state-appointed lawyer.  
  
""We would like to call Mr. Abdullah for questioning."" Said Ahmad's lawyer with a smug smile.  
  
""Mr. Abdullah where were you on the night of 27th April 2013?"" Ahmad's lawyer questioned the mayor.  
  
""I was sleeping on my bed, you can ask my wife.""  
Abdullah chuckled slyly.  
  
After a series of irrelevant questions, the judge freed the mayor due to lack of evidence. No evidence. No case.  
  
""Why didn't you show them the documents I had discovered?"" Ahmad inquired. Anger evident in his tone.  
  
""It's better that you forget this. Dispose of all such documents. It's for your own good."" He answered as he disappeared into the distant crowd.  
  
Rage possessed him, it overtook his body, and his soul to the very core. He would reveal the truth.  
  
Ahmad printed these proofs and published them online. He plastered posters outside every shop, restaurant, street pole, and house. Wherever there was an empty space you would find a detailed explanation of the mayor's corruption.  
  
The public began to gossip.  
They began to whisper.  
  
Then... silence.  
  
Everyone chose to forget.  
  
The mayor resigned. His son took over. Young, charming, and promising change.  
Ahmad was just... Gone. Ahmad was just another madman, mumbling about a tale as old as time under the traffic lights.  
He accepted his destiny. A man forgotten by time itself.

For many nursing graduates, forming a study group becomes the secret sauce to success.

After nursing school, I, Maria and Emily faced the daunting NCLEX RN. We had our strengths, I aced pharmacology, Maria excelled in pathophysiology, and Paloma was a pro at care plans but we all struggled with test anxiety and the sheer volume of material. Instead of studying in isolation, we formed a study group, meeting three times a week at a local coffee shop. Our mantra? Teamwork makes the dream work.

We set clear rules, each session had a focus topic, like cardiovascular or pediatrics, and one member would teach the others, reinforcing their own knowledge. We used saunders for content, Naxlex Qbank for tailored nclex questions to simulate the real test. By pooling resources,we accessed more study tools than any one of us could afford alone. We also held mock exams, timing each other to build stamina for the adaptive test‚Äôs unpredictable length.

Our group‚Äôs biggest strength was accountability. If someone slacked, the others gently nudged them back on track. When I bombed a practice test and doubted myself, Paloma and Emily reminded me of my strengths and quizzed me until i regained confidence. We celebrated small wins like mastering delegation questions, with high fives and coffee runs, keeping morale high.

Each member brought unique insights. Maria's knack for mnemonics helped us memorize lab values (e.g., ‚ÄúCreatinine: 0.6 to 1.2, like a quick sprint!‚Äù). Emily‚Äôs real world clinical stories tied theory to practice, making abstract concepts stick. By teaching each other, we filled knowledge gaps and deepened our understanding.

Test day came, and all of us passed on our first attempt, my computer shut at 85 questions, Paloma at 92, and Emily at 120. We  credit our  study group for keeping us  focused, reducing stress, and making preparations feel like a team sport. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt just studying,‚Äù Emily says. ‚ÄúWe were building each other up to become RNs.

In conclusion our study group wasn‚Äôt just about passing the NCLEX, it was about proving that together, we could achieve anything. Our story shows that with teamwork, the NCLEX isn‚Äôt just a test; it‚Äôs a victory waiting to be claimed.",10,1746546171.0,NCLEXsuccessStories,4,1.0,False

I've also had frequent urination after consuming sugary foods over the past 3 years, but it wasn't constant.

Is this diabetes? Or what am i dealing with?

so we spent the whole day together too and it really was just the sweetest and most natural thing, where we kept talking, brushing arms against each other, and even though my grasp of the local language isn‚Äôt perfect, he was patient with explaining words I didn‚Äôt know and he understood me when I supplemented with english, and he matched my humour and vibe so nicely‚Ä¶ He was super gentlemanly too, even paid for most of the things we did that day, even going so far as to pay for the lunch bill while i was going to the toilet, but still super respectful and checking in on me frequently, and acting cute about getting spoiled when i paid for coffee and snacks even though i was the one being spoiled all day‚Ä¶

when he missed the bus he was supposed to take home and my plans for the next day were cancelled due to bad weather, i decided to do it for the plot and just suggest we stay together for one more night in that city, and i‚Äôm glad that he agreed to it too‚Ä¶ At some point he was calling his best friend to let him know about the change of plans and even the best friend and his wife were really nice to me, they invited me to get dinner together, and the wife who is also a foreigner, even told me on the phone in english how ‚Äúthis guy is so nice, he has a heart of gold, he‚Äôs like a little brother to me, i hope you enjoy your time‚Äù, and somehow i could really just imagine sitting there, grabbing dinner together with his friends, and continue to have a great time‚Ä¶ 

in the end we were both so nervous when we got back to the hotel room, because both of us have never really experienced something like this before, but we took it slow, put on some music that we sang along to, and then when we got more intimate it was still kind of funny and awkward and we stopped halfway through because we were both tipsy and tired, but it still felt so lovely and safe and comfortable that i didn‚Äôt want the next day to arrive, and when we woke up i didn‚Äôt want our alarms to ring even though i know we had places to go‚Ä¶

i‚Äôm not even usually the type of person to fall for someone or get a crush quickly, i‚Äôm usually more cynical about relationships, and i know that i will have to go back to my home country, and now we live like 3-4 hours apart, which isn‚Äôt too bad but it‚Äôs not exactly close either, and despite all that at my proper adult age of 25 im giggling into my pillow and kicking my feet like i‚Äôm in a cheezy highschool romance just thinking about him because we texted and affirmed to each other that we want to visit each other and i‚Äôm already planning when i could take the bus to his place to see him again. i‚Äôm scared and nervous but excited and i‚Äôm not sure i‚Äôve ever felt this way about someone before but im willing to try and see how it foes

Went to school‚Äî4 hours of constant dread, tolerating the most mundane tasks while side-eyeing the clock after every second. Had an exam, trivial matters. What‚Äôs ironic is: why do we engage in activities where the main reason to go is to leave? Hasty, almost with a tired excitement.

After school, I went to the cafe, same spot, my sanctuary,

Where almost all my ideas are born and written. A sweet home for existential dread, where the smell of coffee reigns and the smoker's cloud drifts. I went there tired after a long week filled with exams I barely studied for. I had one last test‚Äîit was math, a subject very dear to me.

Perhaps... perhaps my eyes gave up. Heavy, exhausted from staring at screens late into the night, reading prompts about philosophy. My brain‚Äîmy best friend, my everything‚Äîfailed me.

Disappointed, I left my war luggage at the caf√©.

My pen, the scalpel that dissects my emotions; the agenda where the blood flows with no judgment or fear from being taxed by spelling mistakes or grammar. I went to take a nap on the grass next to the sidewalk near the busy traffic. I landed with a loud thud on the surface, a resignation to my fate. I fell asleep under the watchful gaze of the passers-by, wondering what this odd piece of meat is doing here‚Äîor perhaps what happened to the knight, shiny and bright once, now reduced to this miserable state. But perhaps, perhaps I trusted the sky to watch over me for once.

After a long while, I woke up, stretching under the warm sun,

Forgetting the weight of existence for once. I opened my eyes and saw cars racing against time. Then a thought crossed my mind‚Äîsuicide. I contemplated it for a moment: to crawl lazily toward where the cars are and lay down in silent sight. Instead, I just laughed and bought some random snacks. Went back to my beloved sanctuary with newfound energy‚Äîbut perhaps, perhaps, as soon as I said it, my hopes evaporated like the morning mist. I sat down in silence, contemplating defeat, counting the dead stars of my dreams.

I packed my belongings, almost reluctantly.

The despair was intense, my body shook, hiding my tears. I walked, each step heavier, carrying a crushing weight unbearable for me alone. Being alive was too much. I sat under a tree near the road, my fingers shaking, desperately longing for some comfort. I bit them to make them feel something. Refusing to go home, not falling for the illusion of fake comfort, knowing very well that under a blanket, I would freeze anyways. So instead, I searched desperately for comfort around me‚Äînature, but in vain. The only answer I got was the freezing gust of air, trying to freeze what‚Äôs not already frozen by dread. The trunk of the tree, my only support, was digging into my back, trying to scratch away the crumbs of hope I had left.

My name is Anaiah Ross. I'm the most hated wolf in the pack because when I shifted into my wolf for the first time, I killed Tomas Rivers, our Alpha's brother, who attempted to rape me.

Tomas Rivers was a pedophile who used to touch me in the most inappropriate way when no one was watching. That's why I'm not sorry I killed him.

Since that day, the pack has been mistreating and bullying me. They beat, starve me and make me clean the pack house day in and day out. I tried to tell them that it was only self-defense but they didn't believe me. Tomas's wife, Leah, who denied all the accusations and said that her husband was the perfect man, but I know she knows the truth.

Even my parents turned their backs on me because, after the murder, they were demoted from their Gamma status to Omegas. Omegas are considered the weakest link of the pack, others are strong, but most of them are just cleaners and help out around the pack. They have no major role to play, like fighting in wars or any important pack political business.

""Where is that bitch!"" Leah sneers. I roll my eyes because of everyone here, she makes my life a living hell. I was supposed to be banished after I killed Tomas but my parents pleaded and asked on my behalf, saying that it was my first shift and just lost control.

I get out of my tiny room, it is very small and has almost an old walk-in closet, next to the store room on the second floor. There is a mattress and an old broken mirror. I only have a few clothes, shoes, and a collection of my favorite books.

I get out of the room, mentally preparing myself for all the insults and beating I'm to receive. I groan. Once in the main room, I see Leah standing elegantly in a long dress and heels, one hand on her hip as she taps her feet against the floor in impatience, the other hand holding a yellow fabric that she throws in my face as soon as I'm at arm's reach. I remove it from my face and throw it on the floor, annoyed.

""Um..."" I trail pointing at the dress on the floor. Leah looks livid now and I didn't expect her to slap me, no, I did. She slaps me hard across my face and blood splatters from my nose as I fell to the ground from the impact of her slap. She kicks me once again in the stomach and I grunt.

""I told you to hand wash it!"" She yells. I cover my face with my arms as my face blow after blow. It has been like this since her husband died and I'm here to take all her hate.

I picked myself up from the floor after Leah was tired of beating me. I go to the Omega bathroom to clean my body, the cold water hits my body and I shiver. Slowly, I clean my body and leave the bathroom, using the lotion I left there and wearing the clothes I wore earlier. I am going to get started on breakfast. The packed house has over 100 people staying here, they live in luxurious suites with their families, while others who are unmatched or without families have designer rooms.

With only a few other Omegas to help me, I prepared breakfast. There are sausages, bacon, toast, eggs, and beans, they eat a full English breakfast every morning. I start to serve when I see him, Amos, he's our future Alpha and one of the strongest wolves there is, he's a big player and a Cassanova. But I still have a small crush on him.

Keyword; Small.

He mostly irritates me and bullies me like others. The last time I spilled coffee on his girlfriend Eunice, he slapped me. My wolf wanted to fight back but I knew he could end our lives in an instant.

Amos's eyes met mine and he visibly stiffened and widened his eyes. I ignore his weird behavior and continue serving breakfast. Ignoring all the snarky comments they are throwing my way. I look at my parents but they only look at me with disgust and hate in their gaze. I swallow and inhale, walking away sadly. Tears were well in my eyes but I didn't cry. I can't be weak. I need to leave this place once I'm eighteen and start a new life for myself, so I promised myself to be strong. I will survive, I will take all the beating.

'Don't worry, our mate will love us,' beams my wolf, Chalo.

A mate is a soulmate that completes a wolf's life. Once they are in pain, it is felt by the other and my wolf has been wanting to get one since we learned what mates are, and she believes he will save us from all the pain and torture. He will love us forever and we will have a beautiful family I didn't have.

I see a few students going to school and I smile. I miss school even though all they did was prank me, but my teachers were good to me because I was a straight A student and would win most competitions. The Alpha and Luna stopped my education in my sophomore because they said they can't waste their resources on me when all I'm good for is cleaning and cooking, plus, let's face it, I wasn't going to get into a good college.

After I was done with my chores, I decided to get some vitamin D outside as my skin was too pale due to being indoors. I smile when the sun hits my skin and my wolf purrs. I hid in the bleachers while watching the warriors of the pack train. I like to observe them while they train so that I can know some basics about defending myself.

The Dawnrise is not the strongest there is and has survived thus far by maintaining a good relationship with other strong packs like the Lycans who are royalty to us. The Dawnrise's worst fear is angering a stronger pack. Hence, every year, they hold a ceremony to renew their treaties where they feast and celebrate alliances that were made many years ago.

I feel a hand roughly grab my hair from behind and I fall on my back facing the sky. Eunice is standing over me, her arms crossed over her chest with a triumphant smile on her face. I scowl and try to get up, but a kick in my stomach stops me. She and her two bimbos hit me several times and she snarls.

A1c in feb 2025 5.2

Never taken insulin, on metformin and spironolactone from 2016 to 2020

Possibly experiencing reactive hypoglycemia. Since WLS, blood sugars drop low suddenly. Blurred vision, trembling, arms are heavy, feel as if I have been carrying bricks

I went to Endocrinologist last month, he told me to do keto diet. My wls surgeon said not to do keto diet. Only advice I'm being given is to eat more protein and drink more water.

My lowest record of blood sugar was 55 thus far


Typically when I check my morning blood sugar it is between 70-80. I forgot to check it this morning, drank a quest protein coffee and ate a protein yogurt. Very few carbs this morning between the 2. That was at 7:30 am. Took my blood sugar 10am and it was only 86. While that seems OK for fasting I dont know if it is OK for after eating

I am currently having the onset of blurred vision and trembles (10:30am) so im about to eat.

But this has been going on for over a year every day regardless of what I eat. At work I am constantly eating things such as nuts, jerky, peanut butter crackers, protein bars, granola bars. I work retail so the only thing I can carry is room temp stuff that fits in my apron pocket. Boss told me I'm not allowed to eat on sales floor, but I basically need to eat every hour at this point. Thought of trying to get documentation to say I need to either be able to eat on floor or take 10 min every hour. Have to eat slow because of my surgery, I can't swallow this stuff whole.

I dont know what to do or what doctor to go to.

I apologize in advance if this isn't the right place to post this. 

I'm looking for a female friend with whom I can find friendship, understanding, and support while going through divorce. The heartbreak is immense, the pain comes and goes, and I know there are others like me who are suffering the lack of support groups in our great city.

Not online please. There are many online groups that I did not exactly benefit from. It isn't for everyone. I'd like to meet-up and chat, have coffee, take a walk at the park or beach. We can even sit in the car and cry our hearts out. I only ask that you're compassionate and understanding. I promise to be the same for you. 

I'm in therapy, which is very helpful, but also costly for a 50 minute session, and my therapist won't be my friend that I can talk to whenever I need to. 
Although my therapist gave the green light to start dating, I find dealing with the triggers rather difficult. Today someone sent me a picture that sent me back to square one!

I work but we can meet after work hours or on the weekend. I have an office job and I'm an academic if that's a factor in meeting like-minded people. But truly I'm just looking for a genuine human connection. 

Feel free to DM me.

1kg7ivj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shudder/comments/1kg7ivj/movie_reviews_from_the_last_week_8_total/,Movie Reviews from the last week! (8 Total),"I watched a few movies this past week, wanted to share some of my ideas and thoughts. Let me know what you think! Marked Spoiler due to some not have seen them yet. These are solely my opinion, please do not hate!

Pyewacket - I thought this was cool, I wish the girl summoned the demon earlier and maybe had more of a haunting period before ultimately turning it over. The ending was very good, I liked the twist and honestly it's one of those things where.... what would you even do and no one would believe you anyway!

The Dark and The Wicked - Overall great movie, gets to the point as well. Has a solid tone for timeframe too, unsettling and kept me watching!

Fr√©waka - I'm glad they mixed some conversations in English, but it gave a Midsommar feeling at the end. I thought it was beautifully done and leaves you stuck on the screen to see what is going to happen next.

The Coffee Table - The trailer gave 0 evidence of what was coming. I'm happy it wasn't a possessed table or something. I had to hug my kids after, such a sad tragedy movie and to me, the most unsettling out of this list!

The CloveHitch Killer - It didn't give off the normal slasher/killer movie. You basically knew from the beginning, it didn't have any weird twist to it and it was just well done. I enjoyed the movie start to finish. 

Dead Mail - they had solid character stories but just didn't really zone in on them. The overall movie was great, I just wish it was either longer or a part 2 could come out that gives more backstory into everything. I think a part 2 might never be, because of how it ended and all but I liked the 80's vibe too!

Starve Acre - Too slow for me, nothing in this movie was worth the wait. I watched it because of Matt Smith and even though the acting was good, just the plot was anticlimactic.

The Demon Disorder - It wasn't the worst movie i watched, I wouldn't watch it again. I'm glad i did watch it to cross off my list but it was okay at best. Just a decent horror type movie if you're looking for something different, but not entirely different.

I feel like a shadow; someone pushed into the background of a movie I‚Äôm no longer part of. But I still breathe. I still think. And as long as I do, I‚Äôm someone.

I miss simple things: a roof, a hot shower, a conversation without judgment. But I‚Äôve also learned to value the little things. A warm coffee given to me by a kind stranger. A dog that comes close without fear. The open sky above me every night, vast, as if reminding me that there is still something beyond this moment.

I don‚Äôt know what tomorrow will bring. But today, I write this to remember that I am still me.

I‚Äôm a 29-year-old guy trying to make sense of life, one existential dread at a time. I‚Äôm an introvert with a resting ‚Äúwhy so serious?‚Äù face, but around the right people, I can be the loudest one in the room (or at least the one with the most awkward jokes).¬†¬†

Here‚Äôs the deal: I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I‚Äôm looking for, but I know I could use a friend right now. Someone to talk to about the big things (life, art, mental health, why Arsenal refuses to win the EPL) and the little things (what you cooked today, that song you can‚Äôt stop looping, or how you survived Monday without caffeine). If we vibe, I‚Äôm open to seeing where it goes‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs a deeper connection, a relationship, or just someone to share memes and comfortable silences with.¬†¬†

A bit about me:¬†¬†

- Music: Kendrick, JID, and the new Carti album on loop. If you‚Äôre into music that hits the soul, we‚Äôll get along.¬†¬†
- Health: 2023 taught me that health is everything. I‚Äôm into gymming, eating clean, and sleeping like it‚Äôs my job. But I also enjoy getting high occasionally (once or twice a month) to just *exist* without overthinking.¬†¬†
- Hobbies: Cooking is my therapy, coffee is my fuel (the darker, the better), and I have a soft spot for psychedelic art and deep conversations.¬†¬†
- Humor: Dark, witty, and sarcastic. If you can handle awkward jokes and existential rants, we‚Äôre golden.¬†¬†
- Travel: Long hikes and spontaneous trips are my mood boosters. Bonus points if you‚Äôre into deep, emotional, or spiritual conversations during sunsets.¬†¬†

### What I‚Äôm looking for:¬†¬†
- A nurturing, affectionate, and witty person who‚Äôs okay with my occasional shutdowns (I‚Äôm working on it, I promise).¬†¬†
- Someone who‚Äôs passionate about *something*‚Äîart, poetry, music, or even their morning coffee ritual.¬†¬†
- A two-way connection where we can talk about our days, dreams, and everything in between.¬†¬†
- Bonus if you‚Äôre a football fan or if you can teach me to appreciate something new.¬†¬†

I‚Äôm not here to rush into anything. Let‚Äôs start with a conversation and see where it goes. If you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs kind, patient, and maybe a little lost too, hit me up. Let‚Äôs figure this life thing out together.¬†¬†

P.S. If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre already cooler than 90% of people I know. Slide into my DMs with your favorite song, a random fact, or just a ‚Äúhi‚Äù if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Worst case? We have an awkward conversation. Best case? We create something real. Your move. üòä

So my family and I were staying with some of my husband's relatives for a while in between moves. At one point they had to leave for a family emergency, and we were essentially house sitting during that time. We were trying to tackle some of the bigger cleaning jobs for them before they came home so they wouldn't have to worry about it and found out the majority of their pantry was infested with weevils, and I started finding roaches around the house. Turned out they had a nest in their coffee maker üò¨ We unfortunately had to stay there because our money was tied up in the move, and were trying to help his relatives manage the infestation because they were going through a tough time.

I already have some issues with anxiety but this created an all new fear for me, as the only time I've ever had to deal with a bug disaster was a fruit fly problem in my first place, which stopped when I learned how to clean my drains properly. When we got our new place we started only buying food as we think we'll eat it and got a bunch of enclosed food containers for any packaged stuff we open to keep weevils isolated if any are accidentally brought home and I switched to using a French press instead of a coffee pot (probably extra but I can't look at a regular coffee pot without thinking of roaches now...)

We've been at our new place for a year, and my husband has a bad habit of coming home after second shift and making himself food, and leaving his dishes in the sink or small food messes on the counter, so now I'm terrified of getting ants... We also had an issue with book mites last year because I brought home a secondhand book and we live near water. I deep cleaned, started freezing secondhand books when I bring them home and got a dehumidifier and am obsessive about keeping my shelf dusted and routinely checking my books and keeping our kitchen mess-free.

I tried explaining to my husband how much the food messes stress me out and to please wash dishes when he's done instead of dumping them in the sink and leaving them overnight, but he says I'm just being paranoid, that the roaches weren't even our fault, that I need to stop worrying, etc. I know the house isn't going to be spotless at all times, but waking up to crumbs or a spill on the counter and dishes in the sink makes me feel itchy and stressed. I probably sound crazy but if I see so much as a single ant or spider I feel super anxious. 

I'm sorry that was so long, but has anyone gone through anything similar? I feel so insecure in my own home after dealing with multiple infestations the past couple years.

This is also really embarrassing to post because I feel like we must sound like really dirty people even though we're not... Please be kind üôè",1,1746545288.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

I followed the link and it took me to a page which didn't seem to make any sense. (I'd not had my coffee yet)

A call to BA confirmed that there was nothing available.

Observing. Being the Grim Reaper. All around him, the Akashic Records exists in perpetual eternity, past, present and future. In a corner housed all that is of the Harry Potter world. From angst fics written by teenagers to Coffeshop fanfics. To even the crackfics that truly tickled the funny bones.

Just to the corner where an otherworldy coffee shop is being tended to by a spectral Luna Lovegood, sat two other figures locked in eternal chess battle, the board another Potterworld, the pieces? The Dark Lord and his Minions against Albus Dumbledore and his followers. The pieces are different each game, but the struggle remains, who gets to lead Wizarding Britain at the dawn of the 21st Century.

""I told you.."" Luna began with a detachment in her voice to a Tom Riddle who just wanted to open a flower shop, ""Basilisks just need hugs once every century or so.""

The players on the board? Even more amusing. They play on either side. Never one or the other, for they were beyond such divide.

Lady Time, or Hermione Granger as she had been against Lord Fate, Ron Weasley as he had been. Locked in eternal banter and moving pieces beyond human comprehension

Eternity was well.

Lady Time, adjusted her spectacles and moved the **Remus pawn** diagonally, capturing a **Crabbe bishop**.

Her opponent, **Ron Weasley**, Lord Fate (begrudgingly so), scratched his chin.



""You always play Order of the Phoenix-era,"" he said.

""It has better midgame control. Plus, you're still using Fourth Year pieces like it's 1995."" Time scolded him.

""Shut it. My Viktor Krum knight has *style.*"" Fate bemoaned again.  


They bickered like only people who had grown beyond time but not past their marriage could.

And then, **Time shuddered**.

A scraping of chains, forcing him to turn his gaze to a figure who broke through a crack in the greater universe. A figure in black, held down by chains which had pieces of time turners on both ends. And one on her neck that was assembled through scraps and the unwritten ink of millions of *Drarry* drafts that will never see the light of day was a bigger Time Turner. The Dial of TIme.

Lady Time froze mid putting down a Dobby Bishop.

Lord Fate mumbled something as his hand hovered on a Pansy Parkinson Pawn.

**AND HERE I THOUGHT WE WERE FINISHED.**  Death sighed in a way that echoed throughout all of Eternity.

Delphi Riddle, Delphini Bellatrix Black-Riddle snarled as she twirled her chains. The Dial of Time glowing on her necklace in an eerie mix of blue and green

""I have long since waited for the day to face you again, *Harry Potter*.""

**OUR BATTLE ENDED IN 2020.**  Death declared as he got up from his throne, Elder Wand in hand.  **THE WORLD SEES YOU AN ABOMINATION. SENTENCED TO THE RETCONIAN.**

""Well now? Now I'M HERE FOR THE REMATCH!"" She howled in fury and in delight. A paradox, just like her own existence. ""I have destroyed worlds, fanfics, editorials, spin-offs, so called *remakes disguised as alternate universes*, even one poor soul's PowerPoint presentation where Cedric Diggory was Minister of Magic!""

**HOW MONSTROUS OF YOU.**  Death glowered

""AND I WILL DO IT AGAIN!"" Delphini cackled as she got out her wand. Yew and Hawthrone. A truly disgusting mix of her parents. ""I have trampled over Hadrian Potters with many names, destroyed the spines of countless Violet Potters including one who was pregnant with Daphne Greengrass's child! I have ensured not even *Mattheo Riddle* can claim to be father's sole heir!""

Delphi let out a Bellatrix like laugh, no doubt broken by countless universes since her time in Azkaban after  the Sacred Timeline forgot about her, forgot she existed until she escaped out of pure spite and into the depths of fanfic hell.

""I will rewrite canon again and again until even the *Author* herself will acknowledge me at long last!""

**AND THUS, YOUR FOLLY HAS BEEN SHOWN.**  Death declared.  **GO BACK TO THE SHADOWS WHERE YE BELONG, CHILD OF CURSED LOINS AND BROKEN DREAMS.**

Delphi fired snarled yet again, summoning pamphlets of broken ships and tragedies like missiles aimed towards Death.

Death summoned a shield charm composed of Coffee Shop AUs and fluff oneshots.

In the background, Lady Time and Lord Fate continued their game.

""Should we intervene?"" Hermione as she once was asked.

""Nah, this is what? Like the hundredth time already?"" Ron said as he sipped his tea. ""Harry's got this.""

Flowershop Tom Riddle watches the battle unfold, and asks for another treacle whose taste never fails to make one happy.

""I am sure you can find some place to settle down, Tom."" Luna said with a smile, her tone still detached as ever.",1,1746544761.0,HPFanfictionPrompts,0,1.0,False

* Crisp text with Mac zoom feature, no pixel hunt.

My wife and I (early 30s) and both our parents (late 50s) will be sailing on the Nieuw Amsterdam with Holland America on May 18th. It‚Äôs the first cruise for me and my parents, and second for my wife and her parents (they've done one Caribbean cruise, but this will be everyone's first time in Alaska). We're really excited‚Äîand also realizing how much we don‚Äôt know, especially as our parents start asking detailed questions!

We‚Äôre hoping to tap into your experience and wisdom‚Äîespecially for:

Packing tips (things we might overlook for an Alaska cruise)

Must-dos on the ship or in ports

Cool breweries, bars, or local eats in any of the stops

General tips for a mixed-age group of mostly first-timers


Our itinerary:

Ketchikan ‚Äì No excursions booked yet. Planning to explore town and maybe check out the Lumberjack Show. Open to suggestions for activities, food, or hidden gems.

Juneau ‚Äì We rented a Turo and plan to visit Mendenhall Glacier, Tracy's, Douglas Island, Auke, Eagle Beach, and the Shrine of St. Th√©r√®se. Any great local food or drink spots we should hit either in town or while we‚Äôre out? I know it's a lot in 1 day but we have like 12 hours and a van.

Skagway ‚Äì We have the White Pass train booked for the afternoon. The morning‚Äôs open‚Äîwould love recommendations for coffee, light hikes, or cool local spots to check out. Half looked at Grizzly Falls zip line. Any thoughts there?

Ship questions:

Are the hot tubs actually hot and is there usually room?

What‚Äôs the deal with the Lido pool - too chilly?

Does anyone know what casino games are typically offered? My dad is especially hoping for Ultimate Texas Hold‚Äôem or poker cash games/tournaments.


Post-cruise:

We‚Äôll be spending five days in Anchorage and using it as a base for day trips. We already have a Kenai Fjords boat tour booked, but aren‚Äôt planning to drive up to Denali this time. Any other must-dos from Anchorage? (Scenic drives, hikes, food, wildlife, cultural spots‚Äîwe‚Äôre open!)

Thanks so much for any tips, stories, or advice. This community has already been super helpful in planning, and we want to make the most of the trip without overpacking or overbooking ourselves.",1,1746544660.0,HollandAmerica,3,1.0,False

Daily use of this compact and stylish lamp has proven its usefulness for grey, overcast mornings and lethargic work-from-home afternoons alike. Featuring a 10,000-lux brightness setting, this device provides a mood-enhancing light that mimics natural sunlight, helping combat feelings of seasonal gloom or lack of vitality. The product feels carefully engineered, offering customization and excellent features, though it does come with a few quirks worth noting.

**Design and Aesthetics**
The simplicity of the design caught my attention immediately. The Light Therapy Lamp‚Äôs sleek vertical tube style doesn‚Äôt just fit in my home‚Äîit genuinely adds to the overall decor. Unlike some functional products that scream utility, this lamp boasts a minimalistic white and faux wood base aesthetic that enhances rather than detracts from a room‚Äôs ambiance. However, it didn‚Äôt take long for the shiny plastic wood finish to give away its lower-end material. While functional, the base could have benefited from a more premium touch.

**Customizable Brightness and Color Temperatures**
Here, the lamp really shines‚Äîpun intended. It offers three distinct color temperature settings ranging from a warm 2700K to a cooler 6000K, making it versatile for all times of the day. I use the warmer hues in the evening as my bedroom nightlight and shift to the brighter cool tones in the morning while sipping coffee or journaling. On top of that, its adjustable brightness, spanning from 25% to an eye-popping 100%, ensures there‚Äôs a setting for everyone‚Äôs preference or task. However, I don‚Äôt deny wishing for an even lower dim mode during pre-sleep routines.

**Timer and Remote Functionality**
As someone prone to forgetting things running, the built-in automatic timer is a categorical lifesaver. You can pick from 10-, 30-, 60-, and 90-minute increments. Once, I spent hours reading beside the lamp without even realizing it was on its lowest brightness‚Äîit‚Äôs that unassuming at times! Plus, the remote control adds convenience; I didn‚Äôt have to reach for touch buttons every time I wanted to tweak settings. Personally, I found the remote indispensable, though a magnet to secure it to the base would improve usability for forgetful souls like me.

[Grab the Vusihoo Light Therapy Lamp right here.](https://agegene.com/link/b0bjl2g85y/)

**Performance**
Performance-wise, this device stands tall among its competitors. The 10,000 lux genuinely brightens a room in seconds. Its omnidirectional lighting creates an even distribution rather than glaring directly‚Äîa small but impactful detail that makes it an excellent candidate for light therapy. Using it every morning positively affected my mood, particularly during dull wintery days that paint the sky endlessly grey. There‚Äôs no discernible heat emanation even during prolonged use, which is perfect given its LED composition. I even tried it while working remotely in my dim basement office‚Äîit‚Äôs a definite winner.

**Good Points**
- Adjustable brightness allows tailor-made settings for any environment.
- Multiple color temperatures (warm to cool) range from 2700K‚Äì6000K.
- Stylish modern design integrates beautifully into home decor.
- Includes a timer feature and handy remote control for increased ease.
- Energy-efficient LED emits no additional heat.

**Areas for Improvement**
- The faux wood-look base detracts from the overall build‚Äôs perceived quality.
- Brightness levels could include one softer setting for ultra-lowlight needs like sleep routines.
- Remote isn‚Äôt magnetized or attached to the product, increasing chances of getting misplaced.

**Competing Products**
In terms of similar offerings, brands like Verilux and Circadian Optics dominate light therapy conversations. Compared to those, this lamp holds its ground, especially with its budget-friendly take on so many premium features. Verilux lamps, for example, tout high-quality builds but lack some adjustability, like the multiple color temperatures offered here. Circadian Optics often come across as simpler or less customizable, though they‚Äôre aesthetically grand. The key advantage of the Light Therapy Lamp lies in its combination of programmability, remote functionality, and stylish understated look, which makes it standout even in premium-heavy competition pools.

**Smart Spending**
Value‚Äîor bang for your buck‚Äîdescribes it aptly. For all these features packed into a lightweight and portable package, the product certainly competes with more expensive options. The remote control isn‚Äôt something you encounter often in similar lamps. You won‚Äôt need to continually replace batteries or worry about cumbersome cords outside its initial plug-in requirement. However, it's irritating that the lamp cannot operate without being tethered to an outlet. Though minor gripes can‚Äôt entirely undermine the spectacular cost-to-quality equation intersecting here, it still has moments that clearly remind users about its positioning as a more affordable alternative.

Just wanted to share my recent experience in hopes it helps someone out there avoid the same trap.

I matched with a guy, on Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB) who claimed to be from the UK, complete with a UK number +44 7436 526290. We moved our chats to Viber, and he was very consistent, messaging and calling daily. We had one video call. I asked for more, but he claimed his phone screen cracked while doing site rounds as an engineer, so he couldn‚Äôt do video anymore.

He seemed sweet, intelligent, and emotionally available. Within two weeks, he was already professing his love. He even sent me flowers and said he will to fly to my country to meet me.

After a week, he suddenly had a major project that needed fulfillment within three weeks. He said he had to fly to China to meet suppliers. He claimed he was gathering money to cover the initial payment for his project. However, he is ¬£80,000 short and starts asking for money or else he will be stuck in China. He said he will pay me back once the project is done. To make everything seem legit, he sent me a video of a container van being loaded with supplies, supposedly for his construction project in China. He also sent me a detailed itinerary with his airline, but something felt off. When I contacted the airline directly, they confirmed the ticket was fabricated.

That‚Äôs when I started digging. I found five different TikTok accounts using his photos, all under different usernames, same with Facebook and in CMB. Eventually, I found the real person ‚Äî a Mexican Influencer guy, clearly not the scammer I have been talking to.

Thankfully, I caught on just in time before sending any money. I nearly fell for it.

So please ‚Äî trust your gut. If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it probably is. And if anyone asks you for money online ‚Äî no matter how convincing they seem ‚Äî don‚Äôt fall for it.

The video is really sad and disappointing. Oma compliments Gavin on his hair and k1 immediately pipes in and says he looks like Kevin (from despicable me) and you hear krusty in the background just laughing. As someone else said, I thought making fun of someone‚Äôs hair was ‚Äúgrounds for burning it all down.‚Äù But krusty is the classic ‚Äúrules for thee and not for me.‚Äù But Gavin gets visibly upset. It‚Äôs really sad. And fucking krusty is in the background just laughing. Doesn‚Äôt say anything to k1 or to Gavin to reassure him his hair looks nice.

Aside from the lack of discipline and very clear bullying that krusty and k1 are doing to poor G, I don‚Äôt have a problem with the video being up. I do think Oma should have a private acct if she wants a TT at all though. Because the second video to the top that is posted I have a huge problem with.

K2 is sitting/standing in C‚Äôs lap and leaning over to drink his coffee which whatever. I don‚Äôt agree a child of 18 months should be drinking coffee (even tiny sips) but that‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is that the camera continues to zoom in on k2 while she is drinking or trying to drink out of the mug. And it makes me nauseous to think of the pedos online who have definitely saved that video. The video shouldn‚Äôt be up. But I don‚Äôt think Oma is even aware of or thinks about things like that. Which brings me to why she shouldn‚Äôt have an account in the first place or if she really does want one then it should be private. Shame on C & K for letting that video be posted and not educating Oma. 

By no means am I shaming Oma other than her naivety. But she‚Äôs been sucked into content creation just like Ms. D was with these two fucking shitty adults & parents. TikTok (and honestly all of the internet nowadays) isn‚Äôt like Facebook where you post your kids and grandkids for your friends to see. But I doubt she is aware of any of this because those children have been exploited for years and some since literal birth.

1kg6x46,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatioParadise/comments/1kg6x46/does_rattaner_patio_furniture_set_offer/,Does Rattaner Patio Furniture Set Offer Durability and Comfort? Detailed Review,"Rattaner B0982Y9PRH Patio Furniture Review: Is it Worthy of Your Outdoor Space?

Purchasing patio furniture has always been a tricky balance between aesthetics, durability, and functionality. I recently got my hands on the **Rattaner B0982Y9PRH** patio furniture set, and after weeks of testing it alongside my morning coffees, family barbecues, and spontaneous summer gatherings, I can confidently share my thoughts on this highly-rated furniture set.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, this patio set exudes sophistication with its light grey cushions and dense HDPE wicker wrapped around its anti-rust steel frame. The stereo arcuate stripe pattern introduces a visually textured appearance that feels cozy yet modern. Its sturdy construction isn‚Äôt just for show ‚Äì the steel and wicker combination makes it resilient against wear and tear. My kids (and their friends) have run their tiny trucks across the ottomans, and this thing hasn‚Äôt flinched.

What I particularly appreciate is the smart use of high-quality wicker, which not only adds a traditional charm but also ensures exceptional durability. The light grey color blends seamlessly with various decor themes, and it particularly stood out against the bright greens of my garden. I wasn‚Äôt too worried about spills, thanks to the breathable 250G polyester fabric that‚Äôs easy to clean and maintain. The set even includes furniture covers for added protection during bad weather.

**Comfortable Seating Experience**

Comfort often makes or breaks outdoor furniture, and I‚Äôve had my fair share of testing here‚Äîliterally lounging for hours on the armchairs and couches. The seat cushions are 4 inches thick, loaded with high-resilience sponge material, offering excellent comfort and support. The bottom dotted plastic fabric works wonders to keep cushions in place, eliminating the constant annoyance of repositioning. Meanwhile, the back cushions are filled with PP cotton, incredibly soft yet firm enough to maintain shape even after continuous use.

I love how the seating arrangement accommodates everyone from kids sprawling on the ottomans to friends perched on the loveseat. While some outdoor furniture can feel stiff and unwelcoming, this set genuinely invites you to relax and unwind.

[Check Rattaner B0982Y9PRH price on Amazon.](https://patioboutique.com/p/b0982y9prh/)

**Adaptability and Storage Features**

The sheer adaptability of this furniture set stole the show. Whether you‚Äôre hosting a small family dinner or a large outdoor get-together, the modular design caters to different layouts effortlessly. It includes armchairs, a loveseat, a couch, ottomans, and even a storage table, which offers a level of versatility that I found refreshing. 

The storage table is a genius addition! From storing outdoor throw blankets and board games to holding snacks and beverages during gatherings, it‚Äôs become a favorite feature in my household. It‚Äôs a practical enhancement, saving me constant runs back to the indoor kitchen. Everything‚Äôs right there ‚Äì organized and accessible.

**Assembly Process**

Being a self-proclaimed ""terrible assembler,"" I approached setup with some hesitation. Thankfully, the package arrives in four boxes, each labeled clearly with components and corresponding instructions. Every piece came with the necessary hardware, and an assembly demo video was provided, which I found particularly helpful. While it did take me two hours to complete everything (solo effort here), it wasn‚Äôt overly complicated. 

If you‚Äôre assembling as a team, it will undoubtedly go faster‚Äîpossibly slice the time in half! Though some screws required extra elbow grease to tighten, the final result was worth the effort.

**Key Benefits**

- Durable anti-rust steel frame and weather-resistant HDPE wicker ensure long-lasting quality.
- Comfortable 4-inch thick cushions with high-resilience sponge for exceptional comfort.
- Modular design suitable for various layouts and small or large spaces.
- Stylish light grey color and textured pattern fit modern and traditional settings.
- Convenient storage table for optimized organization.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The hefty 230-pound total weight makes moving the pieces slightly challenging once assembled.
- Assembly time can feel daunting for individuals doing it alone.
- The cushions, though comfortable, feel slightly thin for the backrests when compared to the plush seating.

**Product Rivals**

While the Rattaner set holds its ground, other options like the Devoko Patio Sectional and Best Choice Products Conversation Set offer competitive choices. The Devoko boasts slightly thicker cushions and similar modular adaptability, but the style leans more casual and lacks Rattaner's standout design elements. Best Choice Products, on the other hand, comes at a lower price point but falls short in build quality, especially when compared with the sturdy HDPE wicker of Rattaner. 

Rattaner‚Äôs biggest competitive edge lies in its smart storage and overall sophisticated finish. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone looking for long-term investment and functionality rather than a budget-friendly temporary setup.

**Value for Money**

Given its robust materials, high comfort levels, and unique storage features, this product delivers incredible bang for the buck. Is it a splurge? Sure, but with the adaptability and aesthetic appeal it brings to your outdoor space, you‚Äôre sure to recoup value over the years. I‚Äôve already hosted several successful gatherings using it, and my yard has never looked more elegant‚Äîmaking it feel entirely worth the expense.

We also have a cook that handles a small sandwich menu and all kitchen cleaning.

Our second location opened, and a year later, two baristas are now expected to (on top of make drinks and clean) make sandwiches, bake pastries, hand wash all dishes, keep inventory of everything, deal with our rodent issue, and deal with rowdy customers since the area isn't the best.

I've been looking for a new shop for many reasons, but all the job applications I see are for similar positions where we're juggling 4 different jobs in one shift!

1kg6vky,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunningTrainingShoes/comments/1kg6vky/does_runmaxx_walking_shoes_combine_style_and/,Does RUNMAXX Walking Shoes Combine Style and Comfort? In-Depth Review for Men,"Testing out the RUNMAXX Men's Fashion Walking Lace Up High Top Shoes Stylish Running Athletic Casual Sneaker over the past few weeks turned out to be an interesting experience. The shoes deliver a distinct mix of fashion-forward design and everyday functionality. For someone like me, who puts a good pair of sneakers through the wringer with constant walking, casual outings, and even the occasional jog, I was eager to see how these high tops performed both style-wise and practically.

**Stylish Design and Versatile Looks**  
The standout feature of these sneakers is their striking design. With graffiti-style aesthetics and a high-top structure, they aren‚Äôt shy about making a statement. I‚Äôve worn these to casual hangouts, weekend coffee runs, and even to work on dress-down Fridays, and they‚Äôve earned their fair share of compliments. The breathable fabric and the patterned design make them a perfect eye-catching piece without being too loud. I especially liked how they easily paired with jeans, joggers, and even semi-casual trousers.

**Comfort and Fit**  
Initially, I was skeptical about the comfort level because of the high-top style, but surprisingly, these shoes were pretty comfortable. The padded interior and ergonomic molded sole did a great job of absorbing impact during my walks and light runs. However, the wrapping performance from the high-top design felt slightly restrictive the first couple of days. Once broken in, it became more snug and secure rather than tight. This might not be ideal for someone who prefers a looser fit around the ankles.

[Check RUNMAXX B088JWPL59 price on Amazon.](https://crosner.com/p/b085l797fy/)

**Lightweight Build and Rubber Sole**  
The lightweight build impressed me. Despite wearing them for the entire day, my feet didn‚Äôt feel exhausted. The top-quality rubber sole wasn‚Äôt just durable but also provided excellent grip, which was particularly reliable during rainy days or on slippery surfaces. The sole design performed well, though it isn‚Äôt ideal for intense physical activities like hiking or heavy gym sessions due to the lack of advanced support. 

**Durability of Materials**  
The breathable fabric outer material added an edge of comfort and airiness to the sneakers, though it appeared quite susceptible to stains and scuffs‚Äîthanks to its light tone. While the shoes have held up reasonably well through basic wear and tear after three weeks, I doubt they‚Äôd survive extensive outdoor rough use. Another aspect I noted was the water resistance level being non-existent. Accidental spills soak through pretty quickly, so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them for wet climates or watery paths.

**Merits**  
- Fashion-forward graffiti design with high-top style.  
- Lightweight construction for all-day wear.  
- Shock-absorbing rubber sole delivers solid grip.  

**Pitfalls**  
- Fabric prone to stains and marks.  
- Non-water resistant‚Äîunsuitable in rainy or damp conditions.  
- High-top style may not suit individuals preferring low-ankle designs.  

**Competing Products**  
Several sneakers on the market rival these shoes, especially in terms of style and function. For instance, footwear brands like Converse or Vans offer high-top sneakers with classic designs that appeal to a broader audience. While they may have the edge in iconic looks, they sometimes fall short in cushioning and ergonomic features compared to these RUNMAXX sneakers. On the premium end, brands like Nike and Adidas deliver better grip and water resistance but at double or even triple the cost. That said, this product from RUNMAXX strikes a neat balance between affordability and bold style. Its only real shortcoming compared to competitors is its lack of versatility in wet or rugged terrain.

**Smart Spending**  
Considering the features, the craftsmanship, and the wearability of these sneakers, I‚Äôd say they offer solid value within their price range. They‚Äôre not the cheapest, nor do they carry an over-inflated brand premium that‚Äôs all about the logo. If your aesthetic leans bold and you need a stylish yet functional sneaker for urban settings, these fit the bill. However, factoring in slight limitations like water resistance or the fabric‚Äôs upkeep requirements, you might want to weigh them against alternatives if durability is non-negotiable.

</div>Tips for Making the Most of Your $20 Daily Budget While Enjoying Vietnam‚Äôs Beach Destinations
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Stretching Your Budget at Vietnam‚Äôs Stunning Shores

Traveling on a tight budget doesn‚Äôt mean you have to miss out on the breathtaking beaches of Vietnam. With just $20 a day, you can enjoy sun, sand, and local culture without breaking the bank. The key is to plan smart, focus on essentials, and dive into experiences that cost little or nothing. Vietnam‚Äôs beach destinations offer plenty of affordable options that let you savor the natural beauty and vibrant lifestyle without splurging.

### Finding Affordable Stay Options Near the Beach

Accommodations often take up the biggest chunk of your daily spending, but in Vietnam, budget-friendly places are abundant. Look for basic guesthouses, hostels, or homestays close to the beach. These options typically cost between $5 to $10 per night, leaving room for food and activities within your $20 daily limit. Booking ahead through local platforms or even walking in to negotiate your price directly can lead to even better deals.

### Eating Well on a Shoestring at Coastal Eateries

Vietnamese street food is world-famous, and beach towns have tasty options that won't empty your wallet. A bowl of fresh seafood pho, grilled fish, or spring rolls at roadside stalls can often be found for $1 to $3. Enjoying meals from local markets or little beachside cafes lets you savor authentic flavors and keep your spending low. Picking local fruits and snacks from markets is also a great way to stay nourished between meals.

### Free and Low-Cost Activities to Enjoy the Beach Life

If you think a good time on the beach means expensive tours or fancy rentals, think again. Many beaches in Vietnam are public and free to access, so you can spend your day swimming, sunbathing, or playing beach volleyball without paying a dime. Bring your own snorkeling gear or rent it cheaply to explore underwater life without pricey guided trips. Walking or cycling along coastal paths reveals charming fishing villages and scenic viewpoints at no cost.

### Getting Around Without Extra Costs

Transportation can quickly eat up your budget if you rely on taxis or tourist buses. Instead, renting a bicycle or motorbike for a few dollars a day lets you explore at your own pace while keeping expenses minimal. Public buses can be a good option in larger towns, often costing less than a dollar per ride. Walking is also great in smaller beach areas and allows you to soak up the local atmosphere personally.

### Shopping Smart: Souvenirs and Essentials

Buying souvenirs or beach gear doesn‚Äôt have to mean dipping into your daily funds heavily. Look for small, handcrafted items from local artisans, which tend to be affordable and meaningful. Bargaining politely at markets might help you score better prices, saving money for food or activities. For essentials like sunscreen, bottled water, or snacks, purchasing from neighborhood shops rather than tourist traps will stretch your budget further.

### Timing Saves Money and Enhances Experience

Visiting beaches during off-peak times or weekdays often means lower prices for accommodation and fewer crowds. Early mornings and late afternoons are perfect for enjoying the beach‚Äôs beauty while avoiding expensive rental peak times. Some beaches may also have free community events or local festivals that offer rich cultural experiences without extra charges‚Äîkeeping your days full and your wallet happy.

### Stay Connected Without Costly Data Plans

Wi-Fi is widely available at cafes, hostels, and public spots along popular beaches, so you can plan your day or book cheap deals online without expensive roaming fees. Download maps and travel apps that work offline before your trip to navigate easily without using data. Staying informed on local transport schedules or weather forecasts helps you avoid last-minute, costly changes.

### Prioritizing Experiences Over Extras

To get the most from your $20 daily budget, focus on the beach‚Äôs natural gifts: the sun, the sea, and the scenery. Skip expensive water sports or luxury dining in favor of exploring local fishing piers, joining community volleyball games, or simply relaxing with a book and the sound of waves. These simple pleasures create lasting memories without a big price tag.

### Practical Tips to Keep Your Spending in Check

- Carry a reusable water bottle to stay hydrated and avoid buying many plastic bottles.
- Use cash carefully: small bills help with small purchases and bargaining.
- Choose sleep options with kitchen access to cook simple meals when needed.
- Ask locals for insider advice on cheap eats and free events.
- Keep daily expenses recorded to avoid overspending.
 
With these strategies, enjoying Vietnam‚Äôs amazing beaches on just $20 a day becomes not only possible but truly rewarding. You‚Äôll discover that authentic local experiences, stunning nature, and vibrant culture don‚Äôt require big budgets‚Äîonly a little creativity and an open mind.

</div>### Conclusion

1kg6ttm,https://macsources.com/dreo-ro-countertop-water-filter-wf511-review/,DREO RO Countertop Water Filter WF511 REVIEW,"# Clean design, high filtration power, and simplicity in setup make the DREO RO Countertop Water Filter a strong pick for households that want better-than-fridge water.

For many years, we‚Äôve struggled with getting clean drinking water from our tap. We‚Äôve filtered our water through our refrigerator and tried basic water filter pitchers (like Brita), but no matter what we‚Äôve tried, bottled water just tastes better and less dirty. When the opportunity to try [Dreo‚Äôs](https://macsources.com/?s=dreo) Countertop Water Filter came up, I jumped at it because of the recent increase in grocery prices and the results of an environmental study done on our local drinking water.

# About RO Countertop Water Filter¬†WF511

Its 170 oz tank and dual removable 50 oz pitchers provide ample capacity for daily use.

# Pricing & Availability

The DREO RO Countertop Water Filter has a list price of $299.99 USD from [dreo.com](http://dreo.com/). It‚Äôs also available on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/4jIbrJe)and is currently (at the time of publishing) being offered for $218.99.



# User Experience

Getting the water filter set up was super simple. The main unit was all one piece, and all I had to add was the non-slip coaster for drinking glasses and the pitcher. Aside from that, I just had to remove the packaging tape from the filter unit and plug it in. Even though an app would be nice to monitor stats from the filter, I have to admit that it was nice to set up a device that didn‚Äôt require any extra bells and whistles.

Once you have filled the tank with tap water, the filter does the rest of the work. It automatically fills the pitcher, and you can fill your cup by using the water dispenser. So, how is this different from a filter that might be on your refrigerator? A standard refrigerator usually uses an activated carbon filter, which helps to remove chlorine, some heavy metals, and it can trap sediments and particulates. It‚Äôs better than no filter, especially when you have water like we do.



Because I wanted to make sure that our drinking water was as healthy as it could be, I looked up the quality of our local tap water on [ewg.org](http://ewg.org/). I found out that six different contaminants exceed EWG‚Äôs health guidelines.

* Chromium (hexavalent)
* Haloacetic acids (HAA5)
* Haloacetic acids (HAA9)
* Nitrate
* Nitrate and nitrite
* Total trihalomethanes (TTHMs)

Upon learning this, I was even more appreciative of the Dreo filter. According to EWG, each of these contaminants can be filtered from the water using reverse osmosis. An activated carbon filter will remove 60% percent of those contaminants, reverse osmosis will remove 100% of them. The Dreo filter system utilizes reverse osmosis to remove those types of chemicals from tap water and that method of filtration covers all the contaminants listed above‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand then some.



When the water finished its first two filling cycles, I dumped them both out as the instructions direct you to flush the system twice before using the water. I then filled a 16-oz Tervis tumbler using the dispenser. I selected 16oz as the size and then tapped the dispenser button. Water started filling the cup, and when it got close to the top, I noticed that it wasn‚Äôt slowing down. Unfortunately, the cup ended up overflowing and made a watery mess on the counter. I discovered that it was operator error and not the fault of the filter. After cleaning it up, I tried again, and this time I selected 12-oz. It filled the cup comfortably, and there was still some space left for ice.

I was shocked at how good the water tasted when I tried it for the first time. It reminds me a lot of what we get from most bottled water. It tastes fresh and clean, not heavy like the unfiltered tap water tastes. The only complaint I have is that the water is room temperature. I can add ice, but it‚Äôs only filtered through the refrigerator‚Äôs filter. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out the best option for ice. I did however, start using the Dreo water for my morning coffee, and it‚Äôs SO much better. I didn‚Äôt even notice how much better my coffee could taste with filtered water until I added the Dreo filtered water.

# Conclusion

The DREO RO Countertop Water Filter WF511 offers a significant upgrade from traditional carbon filters used in refrigerators and water pitchers. It‚Äôs a solid choice for anyone serious about removing harmful contaminants and improving the taste of their tap water. With an easy setup, sleek design, and noticeable performance benefits, it provides a long-term solution that feels practical and worthwhile. While it‚Äôs not perfect, like the room-temperature water and the occasional overflow issue, the Dreo filter succeeds where most filters fall short. It delivers peace of mind and water you‚Äôll actually want to drink.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The dough bowl candle boasts several features that contribute to its appeal and performance.

**Material:** The quality of the wood used for the dough bowl is paramount. Look for bowls crafted from hardwoods like maple, oak, or walnut, which are less prone to cracking and warping. Many manufacturers use reclaimed wood, adding an eco-conscious element to the product. The wood should be properly seasoned and treated to prevent moisture absorption and ensure longevity.

The type of wax used significantly impacts the candle's scent throw and burn time. Soy wax is a popular choice due to its clean burning properties, biodegradability, and ability to hold fragrance well. Beeswax is another natural option, offering a subtle honey scent and long burn time. Paraffin wax is a less expensive alternative, but it may produce more soot and release potentially harmful chemicals.

**Size and Dimensions:** Dough bowl candles typically range in size from 10 to 24 inches in length, 6 to 12 inches in width, and 2 to 4 inches in height. The specific dimensions will influence the candle's burn time and the amount of fragrance it releases. Larger bowls generally accommodate more wax and wicks, resulting in a stronger scent and longer-lasting candle.

The size of the dough bowl also dictates its visual impact. A smaller bowl may be suitable for a side table or bookshelf, while a larger bowl can serve as a centerpiece on a dining table or coffee table. Consider the size of your space and the desired aesthetic when selecting a dough bowl candle.

**Number of Wicks:** Dough bowl candles typically feature multiple wicks, ranging from three to five or more, depending on the size of the bowl. Multiple wicks ensure even burning and prevent tunneling, which can occur when only the center of the candle melts. They also contribute to a stronger scent throw, as more wax is melted simultaneously.

The spacing of the wicks is crucial for optimal performance. They should be evenly distributed across the surface of the wax to promote uniform melting and prevent hot spots. A well-designed dough bowl candle will have wicks that are appropriately sized for the bowl and the type of wax used.

**Scent Profile:** The fragrance of a dough bowl candle is a key factor in its overall appeal. Manufacturers offer a wide variety of scents, ranging from fresh and floral to warm and spicy. Popular options include lavender, vanilla, citrus, sandalwood, and seasonal blends. The scent should be well-balanced and not overpowering, creating a pleasant and inviting atmosphere.

The quality of the fragrance oils used significantly impacts the scent's longevity and intensity. Look for candles made with natural essential oils or high-quality synthetic fragrance oils that are phthalate-free. These oils will provide a more nuanced and long-lasting scent experience.

**Burn Time:** Dough bowl candles are known for their long burn times, which can range from 50 to 100 hours or more, depending on the size of the bowl and the type of wax used. Soy wax and beeswax typically burn slower than paraffin wax, resulting in a longer-lasting candle.

Proper candle care, such as trimming the wicks before each use and allowing the wax to melt completely across the surface, can further extend the burn time. Avoid burning the candle for more than four hours at a time to prevent overheating and potential safety hazards.

 ## Core Benefits

The dough bowl candle offers several practical benefits for homeowners and gift-givers.

**Aesthetic Appeal:** The rustic charm of the wooden dough bowl adds a touch of farmhouse chic to any home decor. The unique character of each bowl, with its natural variations in grain and texture, makes it a one-of-a-kind statement piece. It elevates the ambiance of a room, adding warmth and visual interest.

The natural materials and handcrafted aesthetic of the dough bowl candle align with current trends in home decor, which emphasize sustainability and authenticity. It is a stylish and eco-conscious way to enhance the beauty of your living space.

**Enhanced Ambiance:** The soft glow of multiple wicks creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, perfect for relaxation and entertaining. The gentle flickering of the flames adds a touch of romance and tranquility to any setting. It transforms a house into a home.

The comforting scent of the candle further enhances the ambiance, creating a sensory experience that promotes relaxation and well-being. Whether you prefer a calming lavender scent or a refreshing citrus fragrance, the dough bowl candle can help you create the perfect mood for any occasion.

**Long-Lasting Fragrance:** The larger size of the dough bowl candle and the use of multiple wicks ensure a long-lasting and consistent fragrance throw. Unlike smaller jar candles that may lose their scent over time, the dough bowl candle continues to release its fragrance for hours, filling your home with a pleasant aroma.

The even burning of the wax, thanks to the multiple wicks, prevents the candle from tunneling and wasting wax. This ensures that you get the most out of your candle, maximizing its burn time and fragrance output.

**Versatile Decor Piece:** Once the candle has burned completely, the wooden dough bowl can be repurposed as a decorative accent piece. It can be used to hold plants, potpourri, or other decorative items. Its rustic charm adds character to any space, even after the candle is gone.

The versatility of the dough bowl makes it a sustainable and eco-friendly choice. Instead of discarding the container after the candle is finished, you can continue to enjoy its beauty and functionality for years to come.

 ## FAQs Section

**Are dough bowl candles safe to burn?**
    Yes, dough bowl candles are generally safe to burn as long as you follow basic candle safety precautions. Always trim the wicks to ÂΩï inch before each use, and never leave a burning candle unattended. Place the candle on a heat-resistant surface away from flammable materials, and keep it out of reach of children and pets.

**How do I clean the dough bowl after the candle is finished?**
    Once the candle has burned completely, you can remove any remaining wax by placing the bowl in the freezer for a few hours. The wax will shrink and become brittle, making it easy to chip away. You can then wipe the bowl clean with a damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as they may damage the wood.

**What type of wax is best for dough bowl candles?**
    Soy wax and beeswax are generally considered the best options for dough bowl candles due to their clean burning properties, biodegradability, and ability to hold fragrance well. Paraffin wax is a less expensive alternative, but it may produce more soot and release potentially harmful chemicals.

**How do I prevent tunneling in my dough bowl candle?**
    To prevent tunneling, it's important to allow the wax to melt completely across the surface of the candle each time you burn it. This may take several hours, especially for larger dough bowl candles. Avoid burning the candle for short periods of time, as this can lead to tunneling.

Just wanted to share my recent experience in hopes it helps someone out there avoid the same trap.

I matched with a guy on Coffee Meets Bagel (CMB) who claimed to be from the UK, complete with a UK number. We moved our chats to Viber, and he was very consistent, messaging and calling daily. We even had one video call. I asked for more, but he claimed his phone screen cracked while doing site rounds as an engineer, so he couldn‚Äôt do video anymore.

He seemed sweet, intelligent, and emotionally available. Within two weeks, he was already professing his love. He even sent me flowers and said he will to fly to my country to meet me.

After a week, he suddenly had a major project that needed fulfillment within three weeks. He said he had to fly to China to meet suppliers, and things escalated quickly. He claimed he was gathering money to cover the initial payment for his project. However, he is ¬£80,000 short and starts asking for money or else he will be stuck in China. He said he will pay me in 2 weeks. To make everything seem legit, he sent me a video of a container van being loaded with supplies, supposedly for his construction project in China. He also sent me a detailed itinerary with his airline, but something felt off. When I contacted the airline directly, they confirmed the ticket was fabricated. 

That‚Äôs when I started digging. I found five different TikTok accounts using his photos, all under different usernames, same with Facebook and in CMB. Eventually, I found the real person ‚Äî a Mexican Influencer guy, clearly not the scammer I have been talking to.

Thankfully, I caught on just in time before sending any money. I nearly fell for it. 

So please ‚Äî trust your gut. If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it probably is. And if anyone asks you for money online ‚Äî no matter how convincing they seem ‚Äî don‚Äôt fall for it.

1kg6imm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1kg6imm/death_becomes_her_mum/,Death becomes her (Mum),"Since the inception of the universe Death has served as the silent shepherd of the dead, ferrying them towards whatever fate their belief system had in store for them, to some death was a blessed release from pain or torment a shining light, to others a figure of dread and foreboding, but one consistent across all races was Death appearance, a towering skeletal figure clad in black robes and an aura of eternal indifference.

For Death did not feel your trauma, did not care about your sins, he just did his job.

But that all changed when the humans came on the scene, and for Death, humans changed everything.

Death knew of the emergence of human, a curious bipedal mammalian species on the 3rd planet from the star known as Sol

Deaths first interaction with humanity was relatively normal, well for a Tuesday at least, a young human male, butt naked as the day he was born decided it would be a good idea to pet a sabre tooth tiger, not for food, not for defence, but just for fun or because his last two brain cells were busy arguing over which colour rocks taste the best.

The tiger responded as you would expect a violent killing machine with knives for teeth would react and mauled the human savagely, the human bleeding out and grinning like a man who had not just mistaken a murder machine for a house cat lay on the blood-soaked ground.

Death appeared, hand outstretched to perform his duty and usher the human to his next destination when the human blinked up at death ‚ÄúUgg‚Äù the human stammered.

Death blinked, well not exactly blinked due to death hot having eyelids, but spiritually death blinked, and before Death could move, the human reached out his hand and petted Death on the head.

Death sidestepped, Death actually sidestepped, Death hadn‚Äôt actually sidestepped since the dinosaur meteor incident a few hundred thousand years previous.

Then as the human expired Death did something completely alien to him, against all logic and the rules, Death shoved the human soul back into its broken body like a sock into a sock draw, made some rudimentary repairs and shooed the tiger away.

The tiger, who was slightly confused and mildly disappointed that his meal had just gotten up and ran off, wandered away to climb a tree and wait for his next meal, Death shrugged and that should have been the end of it.

But then, the very next day another human climbed the steepest hill it could find, took a long run up and then jumped into the void off the cliff, screaming ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bird‚Äù flapping his arms like a penguin hyped up on coffee.

Death already watching and shaking his head in disbelief with scythe in hand paused, instead of guiding the poor deluded and homicidally stupid soul into the next realm, Death manifested a glowing celestial safety net instead.

‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Äù Death muttered, which was even more alarming to Death, because Death didn‚Äôt mutter, swear, curse or speak period.

And that is when it started, and Death began to change.

At first it was small subtle changes, Death‚Äôs robes began shrinking and turning into something suspiciously resembling a cardigan, stickers began appearing on his scythe saying, ‚ÄúUniverses Best Reaper‚Äù and ‚ÄúWash your hands, Avoid death by plague‚Äù.

One day, as death was patiently waiting the expiration of another life form, he suddenly caught sight of his reflection in a river and where once a proud skeletal icon of death stood proud, now there was a tired, exasperated woman wearing galaxy print yoga pants and holding a mug with the words ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs best mum‚Äù emblazoned across it.

Death had become a mum...specifically a human mum.

The natural and unnatural forces of the cosmos reacted in confusion and horror, some even with amusement, Angels looked on in disbelieve, Demons sent Death scented candles and Eldritch Horrors held a five-day emergency conference titled ‚ÄúWTF is going on with Death, should we be concerned‚Äù.

The centuries past and Death came into her own as humanities overprotective mother, showing infinite patience to even the dumbest of humans.

But then came the Glorthaxian incident.

The Glorthaxian weren‚Äôt by nature evil, nor were they sadistic, they were just mildly unethical with two many arms and a tendency to catalogue and experiment on species by abducting them and over enthusiastically probing them in the name of science and then writing boring academic papers which were so smug they were often met with the universal phenomenon known as the galactic eye roll.

They had stumbled across a back water planet after a particularly boring mission to research a particularly uninspiring nebula, the planet which was spewing out transmissions into the galaxy with reckless abandon merited a look as it might with luck give them the chance to undertake some serious probing after months of boring study.

They found the planet inhabited by a bipedal species which according to galactic records had never been encountered before, so they decided to carry out some scientific research on these bipedal‚Äô s as they were in the area after all, and it would be rude not too, so they picked up Travis.

Travis was just 23 years old and had the maturity of a toddler, his diet consisted of petrol station hotdogs and diet Pepsi, his greatest accomplishment¬†¬†¬† to date was winning a fist fight with a folding chair and had the self-preservation instincts of a Vegan at a Texan BBQ, he was in the Glorthaxians view, perfect.

Travis was transported aboard their research vessel without anyone noticing, or so they thought.

They had barely begun the ‚ÄúWelcome to Science, with probing‚Äù slideshow when the ships internal temperature dropped to minus 50 in a heartbeat, the lights dimmed, and the walls groaned.

The ships internal AI screamed ‚ÄúWarning‚Ä¶ Reality has been breached, Cosmic entity incoming, she is MAD.!‚Äù and immediately shut itself down.

‚Äú**PUT HIM BACK**‚Äù resounded through the corridors, rooms and spaces of the ship sending a chill down the already frozen spines of the Glorthaxians.

A vortex open in the lab, a maelstrom of maternal rage with the faint smell of butterscotch and through the portal stepped Death, a look of furious anger that made the Glorthaxians pee themselves, a feat even more spectacular when you take into consideration that Glorthaxians don‚Äôt have the ability to pee.

Death, wearing a planetary pattern cardigan, had her hair up in a messy bun that glitched reality for anyone in close proximity and swinging a tote bag with the logo ‚ÄúLive, Laugh, lobotomize‚Äù glared around the room.

‚Äú**WHO, DECIDED TO KIDNAP MY BOY**.!‚Äù Death thundered, in a voice which cracked open 7 dimensions and gave sentience to a nearby potted fern.

Three interns immediately broke down crying and calling for their mummies, whilst Travis suspended butt naked in a glowing status pod waved at Death ‚ÄúHi, Mummy Death‚Äù

Deaths renowned infinite patience was at an end.

Death placed a hand on her hip, the universal mum hand on hip, universally feared and which made galaxies shiver.

Professor Blorp‚Äônax moved forward with a clipboard and a smug confident look on his face, the smug confidence of someone about to make a terrible mistake without knowing just how bad it was going to be for him.

‚ÄúGreetings, we are currently undertaking non-lethal anatomical analysis on this specimen for educational and scientific research‚Ä¶‚Äù

SLAM‚Ä¶before professor Blorp‚Äônax could continue a 400-page glowing consent form appeared on his clipboard, the weight of which made him buckle.

‚Äú**DID HE SIGN IT.!!!**‚Äù Death asked, the tone of the question indicating that the answer was already known.

Blorp‚Äônax blinked all seven of his eyes and stammered ‚ÄúWell, No, but we assumed‚Äù

‚Äú**OH, YOU ASSUMED, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ASSUME**‚Äù Death leaned in close to Blorp‚Äônax ear ‚Äú**YOU AND YOUR SPECIES GETS PUT INTO UNIVERSAL TIME OUT UNTIL THE END OF THE UNIVERSE‚Äù**

One intern whispered ‚ÄúI want to go home‚Äù

Death glared at him, causing the intern to instantly regret his life choices ‚Äú**YOU WILL GO HOME WHEN YOU HAVE CLEARED UP THE MESS YOU HAVE MADE AND WRITTEN OUT 5 MILLION TIMES ‚ÄúI WILL NOT KIDNAP HUMANS‚Äù‚Äù**

Death then turned towards Travis, clicking her fingers the electrodes instantly vanished and Travis was no longer in the status pod but standing beside Death, wearing sweatpants and wearing a t-shirt which read ‚ÄúUniverses Greatest Species‚Äù

‚Äú**TIME TO GO SWEETIE**‚Äù Death cooed, not taking her eyes off of the scientists, the temperature lowering even further ‚Äú**DON‚ÄôT KIDNAP ANY MORE HUMANS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND**‚Äù

Blorp‚Äônax trembled ‚ÄúYes, Ma‚Äôam‚Äù

With that Death and Travis vanished, leaving behind the faint smell of butterscotch, judgment and parental anger and the Glorthaxians, they universally banned species abduction and probing, and somewhere out there is a sentient fern, writing poetry.

I feel like I'm doing something wrong just by existing and feel like hiding under a blanket. I do feel better if I manage to get up very early and go for a walk, but especially if it's still dark and cold, I feel so vulnerable and afraid. I just have so much to vent and so much anger to let out EVERY day, and I can't just get up, get a cup of tea and get to work calmly like everyone else.

 My ideal morning routine would be like:

\- Get up at 5, punch a punching bag and scream

\- Drink coffee/matcha and eat breakfast if I'm hungry

\- Go for a walk and run while being invisible so no one can judge me

\- Read a book with the entire house locked so no one can attack me while I'm vulnerable

\- Shower and put on my ""functional adult"" costume and be able to pretend this crazy world is okay

But right now it's more like:

\- Get up at 9 after only falling asleep at 3 am even though I wasn't on my phone

\- Drink too much coffee cause I'm used to it

\- Too afraid to go out for a walk and it's too late now

\- Feeling too guilty to read

\- Anxiously working while feeling guilty about not taking care of my needs properly yet again because I'm too afraid and ashamed

the unborn sovereignty 
that was placed upon me
just a broken crown
shining in the icy sunrise

there is no surprise of my demise
I saw it coming with my own two eyes
and I watched it engulf
the last of my untainted mind

like leaves drifting in the breeze
carefree of the coming daylight 
and carefree of the dimming daytime 

and what falls in between
is a bitter version of me
my coffee I brewed too strong
then overcompensated, too sweet

I sip away at the broken medicine
chip away at the fossilized me
I see now a kingdom come
but the high horse starts to sink

there‚Äôs no room here for a young voice
my ears are already full of old echos

unrecognizable

there‚Äôs fire in their souls
cold winds from the delta
and they won‚Äôt meet

too high strung
too cocky
too low barred
too insecure

I use the tears of my fellow human
to stick the pieces back in place
and claim my stake at the top of this space

The fifth floor is empty. No desk, no computers and no account managers. It was a bare office, grey walls, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere like no one was ever here.

It was Saturday night, John and Seymour argued louder and faster. Other bar goers were staring at us. I was getting bored of their conversation after three beers in, my news feed becomes more interesting. My boredom and alcoholism lead me to the job app NOW HIRING.

At one point the jobs became too weird or had little to no information. I sent my resume to a few entry level jobs, not expecting to hear back from any of them.

The next day I was hung over, and very hungry, my roommates were cooking. I staggered to the bathroom with my towel and loofa. The warm shower woke me up.¬†

RING!

An unknown number. I let it go to voice mail.

RING!

I silence it.

RING

I angrily turned off the water and answered.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúHi is this Austina?""

‚ÄúYes. Who is calling?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Brian!‚Äù He sounded positive and chirpy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm with New York Bankers. We saw your application on For Hire and we‚Äôd love for you to come to the office for an interview. We‚Äôre having a interview event today and we can squeeze you in.‚Äù Brain said with much enthusiasm.

‚ÄúToday is Sunday. You guys work Sunday?‚Äù

He chuckles lightly. ‚Äú Yeah. When the banks close, New Yorkers are open! We pride ourselves on filing, account managing, and book keeping for New Yorkers any day of the week. Holidays and weekends!‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, today isn‚Äôt great for me. Can we reschedule for tomorrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúTomorrow?‚Äù He sounded hurt. ‚Äú Tomorrow we won‚Äôt be doing interviews, today is your only chance. We‚Äôre gonna be here till 3pm.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to get out of this conversation.

‚ÄúLook Austina. You‚Äôre probably having second thoughts right now. It‚Äôs a Sunday you probably want to stay in bed all day right. I would too, but I wouldn‚Äôt be in the office right now, if I knew there wasn‚Äôt money to be made here. NY Bankers is a fast paced work environment we work closely with our clients and they‚Äôve come to trust us. We offer paid training and large commissions. If you want to start making a lot of money this is your chance.¬†

‚ÄúSure. I can come in at 1:30pm.‚Äù I caved to Brian‚Äôs sale. He gives an address. It‚Äôs by Union Square park. He tells me how lucky I am to get this opportunity and what it means to be apart of New York Bankers. I hang up and return to my shower.

I finished my shower, quickly dried myself, put on my pjs, grabbed my laptop and typed New York Bankers.

I found a website of a stock photo slide of New York City. Each photo had blurbs about their company. They were all vague and meaningless attributes of their performances. Quotes of their accomplishments from random ‚Äúclients.‚Äù Whenever I clicked on anything outside of the home page it lead me to a construction page. I‚Äôd seen enough. These guys are scammers, I closed my laptop and laid on my bed. I decided not to go. I looked at the job posting on my phone. I was thinking about reporting the post until the idea came to me.

I grabbed my suit jacket, put my phone in the front chest pocket, camera facing out. It was a perfect fit, the camera was above the flap. I hit record and did some test shots. The footage is good, but the sound wasn‚Äôt.

Found my good tape, cut out little squares and taped a LAV mic cable on my chest. I connected it to my phone via a small hole behind my chest pocket, hide it well. It looked really discreet, no one could tell I was recording them. Finally I moisturized, dried my hair, picked out the rest of my outfit and left confident in this interview.

There was a farmer‚Äôs market happening, I bought coffee and doughnuts and went across the street to NY Bankers. It was a corner glass building, 12 stories tall with a balcony patio. The building reflected the blue sky from every angle like it was apart of the sky. Beautiful, reflective and bright.

There was one banner inside, it hung behind the front desk. Despite the people walking around me, no one seemed to notice that this building exists. There was no one in the lobby, it was empty. I went through the revolving door.

An empty black marble room, cool A.C, one long red mat that lead to a hallway. The banner had an outline of the five boroughs with the word ‚ÄúBankers‚Äù spelled across it.

Down the carpet was an elevator.

DING!

Inside there was only one glowing button. Five.

DING! Men and women in suits sat on black cushion seats against a white wall. A male receptionist looked at me.¬†

‚ÄúYou must be Austina! I‚Äôm Brian.‚Äù He had the same cheery personality she heard on the phone.

‚ÄúAm I late?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôre right on time.‚Äù He points to the large lobby room where men and women were sitting. ‚ÄúTake a seat with the rest.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt matter where.""

There was one seat open in the middle. I had a clear view into the office, I got a pan shot of the office as discreetly as I could.

Four rows of desks with men and women hunched over typing, reading, talking and calculating. Few were silently arguing in their phones, trying not to disturb the peace. Others had small talk by the water cooler, few were at the patio. They all looked middle aged and most of them were large and tall. Most of them were white, few were black and brown.¬†

It seemed like another world, I had so many questions.¬†They all ignored us and looked into their computer screens. Some were happy, others had no expression at all.

‚ÄúHey. How long have you been waiting?‚Äù I whispered to the tall black women to my left.¬†

‚ÄúTen minutes.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this strange?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, It‚Äôs an off market trading company. Large accounts making their next move.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds illegal.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook at that man, in the red shirt, in the back.‚Äù She nods her head to a man with a red shirt and grey pants. ‚ÄúHe never puts the phone down. He‚Äôs making calls. To who? Families that rest on Sundays.‚Äù

‚ÄúShady. All of it‚Äôs shady.‚Äù

‚ÄúMoney is money if it‚Äôs dirty or clean.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can call me Patrica.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Austina.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs such a white girl‚Äôs name.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHey, this is my city. I ain‚Äôt getting scammed by these idiots. Think about what they‚Äôll make us do?‚Äù

‚ÄúLearn to take the money. People with gold don‚Äôt let go.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are something you know that?‚Äù¬†

She chuckles. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the whole package.‚Äù¬†

We waited for fifteen minutes. The office seemed to be in a loop. One conversation begin, another ends, when that one ends, a new one begins. They were lively for a Sunday.¬†

‚ÄúHey Brian?‚Äù I walked up to the desk. He looks up from his desktop. ‚ÄúWho are these people? When you said you work Sunday, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect.‚Äù

He chuckles at the question. ‚ÄúSo these guys are our senior staff. They‚Äôve been with us longer and have clients that require special attention.‚Äù Brian said. ‚ÄúThink of us as an accounting firm, but you don‚Äôt have to worry about working weekends. New hires have regular hours. Today is the only time our hiring manager can conduct interviews.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow long have y‚Äôall been open?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe opened at 2020. We began working remote but are slowly letting senior staff in.‚Äù

An older man with a large stomach and a tucked in blue shirt. ‚ÄúHello Brian. Is this everyone?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes. They are all accounted for.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you one of them?‚Äù The older man looks at me.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù I say proudly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Austina.‚Äù

He holds his hand out, we have a firm handshake.

‚ÄúGreat! Join your colleagues, we‚Äôre moving on soon.‚Äù He said. I sit back down. He pulls up his pants and steps forward to the line of people. ‚ÄúThank you for arriving, especially on a Sunday. I‚Äôm Alexander, the hiring manager. If you all follow me, I‚Äôll lead you all to another waiting room.‚Äù¬†

We all chuckle.¬†""Please have your resume ready.‚Äù He announced.

The hairs on my arms raised, my shoulders shivered. Keeping my smile and composure, I stayed cool. I was so focused on my outfit, I forgot to print my resume, I was racking my brain trying to figure how I can do this.

Alexander lead us to another waiting room. This time the seats were across from three conference rooms. We had a clear view of the conference room and interview. The walls and door were glass. Three men sat at the far left end of the conference table. They looked like Alexander. Big gut and tucked in dress shirts.

‚ÄúOkay everyone grab a seat. The first interview will take about twenty minutes, afterwards we‚Äôll ask a couple of people to stay for a second interview. Thank you for your patience.‚Äù He pulls the door open. ‚ÄúOkay let‚Äôs start from the left side.‚Äù He point at a young man with a blue shirt and black suit. He follows Alexander inside.¬†

Sweat runs down my temple. Other applicants have their printed resume on their laps.¬†

One by one we go into the conference room. Alexander does most of the talking while the applicant listens. They do ask for the resume. The other men only ask one question then Alexander talks a bit more.¬†

It was my turn. Alexander points to me, welcomes me in the conference room. My heart races, avoiding his blue eyes. He closes the door behind me. He joins the rest of fat old men.¬†None of them introduced themselves, they all nod at me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Austina?‚Äù the first large man asks.

He gestures to the seat, but I don‚Äôt sit. ‚ÄúYup that‚Äôs me! I applied last night and got a call from Brain this morning! I‚Äôm very curious about this place. I‚Äôm excited to learn from y‚Äôall.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have your resume?‚Äù Alexander asks.

My heart beats like crazy. My back stiffens, I clenched my fists, cleared my throat and answered truthfully.¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need my resume.‚Äù They share a look of confusion. ‚ÄúA good saleswoman doesn‚Äôt need references or experience. All that we need is ourselves and a friendly attitude. My pervious jobs won‚Äôt tell you anything that will satisfy you.‚Äù Unbuttoning my suit jacket. ‚Äú Let me repeat that, nothing I say can satisfy you. What matters is the thick of my skin and my smart head. Every New Yorker has gotta be tough. So let me tell you about me. Stuff I‚Äôm proud of. I was born and raised in New York City. I went to college for two years and returned to the city to build my net worth. Currently I‚Äôm working in Macy‚Äôs selling perfume. A very high commission job with a lot of competition.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat were you studying?‚Äù¬†The second large man asks.

‚ÄúCommunication and Media. Social Media skills.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a very popular field. Why did you leave college?‚Äù Alexander follows up.¬†

‚ÄúThe college didn‚Äôt have a great communication department. There weren‚Äôt enough courses for people in my major. It didn‚Äôt live up to my expectation.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you plan to go back?‚Äù The third large man asks.¬†

‚ÄúNo. I believe the greatest learning tool is first hand experience.‚Äù I stood up. ‚ÄúYou see before I worked in Macy‚Äôs I interned at Buzz Feed. I learned a lot from them, how to manage social media and SEO. One thing I learned is the value of an image.‚Äù

I stepped closer to the large men.

‚ÄúYou see presentation matters, sure. But what‚Äôs really important is the substance. If we aren‚Äôt authentic to ourselves and others then how can anyone believe anything that we are selling? Consistency and Communication are the most important traits for entrepreneurs. In our modern age anyone can be anything with a instagram post. Who we are is a front, what counts is what we're selling.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúHow are you in accounting and filing?‚Äù The second large man asked.

‚ÄúI have the memory of an elephant. I had great experience working with analytics and data sets. One of my tasks at Buzz Feed was predicting our engagement.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long did you work at Buzz Feed, why did you leave it for Macy‚Äôs?‚Äù The third large man asks.

‚ÄúSimple. My goal is to own and operate my own social media app. Buzz Feed was a great experience for me to see how a media company operates. Macy‚Äôs is a way to support myself as I build my own app from my room.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very ambitious. Does anyone support you?‚Äù Alexander asks.

‚ÄúNope. I live alone, I‚Äôve dumped all my savings into this project. I‚Äôve been doing this for the past two years.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow. What attracted you to this job?‚Äù The first large man asks.¬†

‚ÄúSimple, the management experience. I would love to learn how you all work with clients and meet their need. I know my company will have difficulties and hiccups, but a good leaders needs to work under strenuous circumstances. A good leader will make it work. I can‚Äôt wait to get started and prove to you that I‚Äôm an exceptional saleswomen and leader.‚Äù

‚ÄúAustina. Thanks for your time. Return to your seat. Please stick around.‚Äù Alexander says as he opens the door for me. He points at Patrica, she goes inside.

My heart calms down. Breathing in and out, the blue sky from the patio calms me.

I take my seat and rest my head against the wall. I wipe the sweat from my brow and the watch the other applicants go in the conference room, one by one. After the last one, Alexander steps in front of us. ‚ÄúThank you for waiting. We appreciate everyone for spending their Sunday with us. I‚Äôm gonna go through a list of names, these are people who we believe aren‚Äôt suited for the job. We‚Äôre looking for people who have certain skills that we believe can improve our company.‚Äù¬†

Alexander goes through a list of names.¬†‚ÄúUnfortunately I wish I could hire you all. Please leave your resume at the front desk.¬† We appreciate you coming here, but we‚Äôre going with the other candidates.‚Äù My name wasn‚Äôt called.

‚ÄúEveryone who is staying please stay here. We‚Äôll have lunch ready soon.‚Äù

Half of the applicants leave. Patrica stays.¬†

‚ÄúWhat did y‚Äôall talk about?‚Äù She asks me.

‚ÄúNothing. I just told them about background.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too. Nothing about the job.‚Äù

The last of the people left.

Alexander and the other interviewers stood in front of us.¬†The light go out, everyone puts away their phones.

‚ÄúWell lunch is served.‚Äù¬†

Suddenly they began unbuttoning their shirts. All the office workers stood up, doing the same.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I yelled.

Alexander ignored my objection, he kept unbuttoning.¬†Their stomachs aren‚Äôt stomachs. A lip? A seam like a long scar, but it had a different skin tone. Alexander‚Äôs stomach was opening. It was happening everywhere. The office workers began changing. Everyone burst out of their clothes, naked and wide open. Their skin changed to a pale color. Their stomaches unfolded, their ribcages are teeth.¬†

A mouth opens, wider and taller than Alexander. I didn‚Äôt scream or run, the red flesh of the mouth-stomach opened up and licked its ribcage-teeth.

A wide slimy red tongue latches on me and pulls me inside its mouth. In a matter of seconds the mouth closes on me, it's pitch black. Its teeth pierced my ankles, it tries to bite my head but I dodged the canines. I scream, writhed, kicked and punched everything I could. Nothing freed me from the tongue.

I saw the sharp tooth from the corner of my eye. I swerved my head left, barely missing it. I could feel the teeth crunch down on my ankles. Everything kept getting tighter, it wanted to finished its meal.

With sheer force I pushed my left arm against the tongue to give myself some space. With my right arm, I reached for my suit pocket. I grabbed my phone and pull out the LAV mic wire. I balled it up in my left hand.

I tied the wire around the tongue, luckily it was long enough, and strangled the muscle with all my strength, I screamed ‚ÄúLet me out!""

Suddenly something echos, a scream from deeper inside. Gurgles of flesh and monstrosity. Real light peeked from behind me. I didn‚Äôt let go until I saw the office ceiling. The gurgles turned to a monstrous scream.

It spat me out on the floor, I scramble to my feet and I ran towards the exit. I ignored the pain as much as I could but my left ankle was like a dog‚Äôs chew toy. I hid behind an office desk and bandaged my foot with a cloth from my suit. I looked at the office and I didn‚Äôt know what I was looking at.

They were all large, tall, and wide, there was nothing human. It was like a Venus flytrap but with arms and a tongue. A large set of teeth and a pair avian arms like a bat. It‚Äôs jaw rested on the floor along with some lumps of fat.

Their mouth-stomaches were gnawing and chewing on the applicants. Few were pulling apart their limbs. Others chewed with their mouths open. Chucks of human flesh were minced by the sharp teeth of their mouth-stomaches. Patrica was gone, I looked for anyone alive. The red shirt was backed in a corner, they surrounded him, three monsters ripped him apart. His clothes and blood flew everywhere.

Saliva drooled down their lips. The munching and gnawing filled the room. It smelled foul. I kept moving towards the hallway, sticking to the desks. They ignored me, too busy with their food. I came to the elevator, I kept pushing the button.

I finally looked back at the monster that I came out of, it writhes in pain. Others attended to the injured one, they helped him stand up, they rubbed his mouth-stomaches. They turn around to the patio and climb up a ramp?¬†

They walked past the patio railing, on the blue sky. Each step they took revealed an invisible ramp. A bright light appears just above them. Another room. I caught a glimpse of a grey room with long reflective panels. Alien letterings and icons. In the center, the creatures laid on their side, their stomach mouths eating huge plates of meats. They only wore gold necklaces.

Before the injured monster enters the invisible room, it yells something, a word, a sentence? I don‚Äôt understand it but everyone stops. Their yellow eyes stare at me. They all finish chewing their food and get up.¬†

They run towards me!¬†

DING!

I step in and hold the close button.¬†

It closes just before one of them reached me.

I put my back against the wall.

DING!

I run across the lobby. I push through the rotating door and bolt out of there. I run across the street, but the park was empty. I ran into the subway and tried to find a cop.¬†

Finally I see a cop, a human, waiting by the subway gate. I grabbed his arm and yell ‚ÄúI need your help!‚Äù I leaned on him, start to heave and cry. Frantically explaining what happened to me and why I‚Äôm covered in red slime. He tries to calm me down, I know I sounded insane, but I had to show someone the monsters posing as bankers. He might‚Äôve believed me, but he talks into his radio and calls for a medic. He brings me back outside where an ambulance arrive. I frantically tell them to check the building and go to the fifth floor. The cop assures me that he will, but I know he won‚Äôt. Medics surround me, they rest me on their stretcher and treat my ankles.

Detectives are the first to greet me, I tell them everything that happened. They can‚Äôt search the building unless they have a warrant. They ask me how I got in. ‚ÄúIt was unlocked.‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúI went inside and took the elevator to the fifth floor.

‚ÄúThat building hasn‚Äôt been leased in years. We called the owner, no one has been inside.‚Äù The detective said.

‚ÄúBut I applied to a job on Now Hiring. Their receptionist called me and asked me to go there for a job interview.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did an interview with Human-eating alien monster?""

‚ÄúI FORGOT MY RESUME! I SAT ACROSS A WORKING OFFICE FULL OF PEOPLE! THERE WERE OTHER APPLICANTS! PATRICA IS MISSING! NEW YORK BANKERS! WHEN BANKS ARE CLOSED, NEW YORKERS ARE OPEN! THEY CALLED ME! I SAW THEM TURN INTO MONSTORS! THEY TRIED TO EAT ME!‚Äù¬†",6,1746543126.0,nosleep,3,0.88,False

So I stumbled on this book called ‚ÄúManifestation Journal ‚Äî 30 Days to Abundance‚Äù by Luna Hart while browsing Kindle, and wow‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been a total mindset shift.

I‚Äôve always wanted to be consistent with journaling, especially for manifesting, but I never stuck with it‚Äîuntil now. This book makes it super simple. Each day gives you a prompt and a bit of mindset coaching‚Äîno fluff, just focus. The prompts aren‚Äôt cheesy like some other ones I‚Äôve tried. They really push you to reflect and get clear about your goals, your limiting beliefs, and what abundance means to you.

I‚Äôm on Day 14 now and I‚Äôve already:
	‚Ä¢	Shifted my mindset from scarcity to opportunity.
	‚Ä¢	Attracted a surprise freelance gig (wasn‚Äôt even actively looking!).
	‚Ä¢	Been waking up with way more motivation.

Highly recommend this if you‚Äôre into LOA, journaling, or just want to refocus your energy for a new month. It‚Äôs only like 3 bucks on Kindle. Totally worth skipping a coffee for.

Every single game these two squads have played against each other this season has cashed the Over. To boot, 4 of Cal Quantrill‚Äôs (8.10 ERA) last 5 starts have seen final scores of at least 12 runs. On the other side, Tony Gonsolin‚Äôs (4.50 ERA) last start against the Marlins saw a final score of 19 runs. Honestly friends, today's game total should go to the moon. I‚Äôm on the Over to hit.

He was the one who initiated all our conversations. First I had no idea he was gay. On Saturday, he asked me to grab a coffee after workout, and I agreed. We ended up chatting for about an hour, and it went really well.

Today, he texted to ask if I was going to the gym. Eventually, we agreed to meet at the same coffee place around 2 pm. I got there on time and texted him, but he said he had been aimlessly hanging out at the gym for the past 30 minutes without even starting his workout. When I asked when he‚Äôd arrive, he said in 40 minutes. I was surprised, but figured maybe there was a miscommunication. So I stayed and did some work on my laptop.

At 2:45, I checked in again and he said he‚Äôd be there in 5 minutes.

By 3:07, I still hadn‚Äôt seen him, so I texted that I was leaving. He called a few minutes later and said he didn‚Äôt realize I had limited time. He thought I‚Äôd be willing to hang out for hours. He even said that if he‚Äôd known I‚Äôd leave around 3‚Äì3:30, he would‚Äôve come to see me first before going to the gym. That was quite odd to me. He asked if I could return and stay 20 minutes at least, but I declined.

He then asked if I wanted to meet again tonight at the same place. I didn‚Äôt want to say yes right away, so I told him I‚Äôd check and get back to him. An hour later, I asked if his offer still stood. He replied, ‚ÄúBaby, I‚Äôm still at the coffee place. I won‚Äôt feel like going out again once I get home.‚Äù

I'm now using the term aroace lesbian as it feels a bit more accurate. I have experience random crushes on girls since I was around 14, but there would be YEARS between them. And looking at them now, it seems like a consistent factor is there was at least the potential that they liked me back.

1) First crush when I was 14; we were joined at the hip besties who sprinted to hug each other, were very physically affectionate (held hands and cuddled). I did wonder if it was a crush at the time (baby's first gay panic) although the fact that she might like me back too wasn't something I picked up on at the time. Mainly because I was busy having a ""omg am I gay?"" panic. 

2) First girlfriend; I very much remember realising I liked her/starting to like her because she confessedt o me first. To this day, I don't know if it was actually liking her or the excitement of having a girlfriend, but I felt like I did like her. We dated for three months before I broke it off because I worried she was putting more into the relationship than me; she had dropped the L word and was talking about us moving in and having kids together and it panicked me. Then realised I was aro.

3) Close friend; I have a friend who is very physically affectionate with me (often greets me with a hug, we sat with our knees touching, will touch my shoulder/back as she passes). It was literally this week I joked to myself ""oh, if anyone saw that they'd think we were dating-OH WAIT"". And I went back and forth wondering if I did like her like that and started daydreaming about dating her. Then she brought her girlfriend to an event I was working (LMAO-I was more upset about this than I have any right to be). 

There have been other little sporadic crushes, cute girls in uni lectures and one cute barista (who again, made a point of chatting to me and remembering my order and brushed my hand when she handed me my coffee). Can this be a part of aromanticism, feeling attraction when you know or at least know it's possible it can be reciprocated? Or should I just give it up and work on accepting I'm aro?

He was the one who initiated all our conversations. First I had no idea he was gay. On Saturday, he asked me to grab a coffee after workout, and I agreed. We ended up chatting for about an hour, and it went really well.

Today, he texted to ask if I was going to the gym. Eventually, we agreed to meet at the same coffee place around 2 pm. I got there on time and texted him, but he said he had been aimlessly hanging out at the gym for the past 30 minutes without even starting his workout. When I asked when he‚Äôd arrive, he said in 40 minutes. I was surprised, but figured maybe there was a miscommunication. So I stayed and did some work on my laptop.

At 2:45, I checked in again and he said he‚Äôd be there in 5 minutes.

By 3:07, I still hadn‚Äôt seen him, so I texted that I was leaving. He called a few minutes later and said he didn‚Äôt realize I had limited time. He thought I‚Äôd be willing to hang out for hours. He even said that if he‚Äôd known I‚Äôd leave around 3‚Äì3:30, he would‚Äôve come to see me first before going to the gym. That was quite odd to me. He asked if I could return and stay 20 minutes at least, but I declined.

He then asked if I wanted to meet again tonight at the same place. I didn‚Äôt want to say yes right away, so I told him I‚Äôd check and get back to him. An hour later, I asked if his offer still stood. He replied, ‚ÄúBaby, I‚Äôm still at the coffee place. I won‚Äôt feel like going out again once I get home.‚Äù

I just said ‚ÄúGot it.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm honestly just confused. Either he‚Äôs really bad at communication, or this whole thing is just toxic. I have no idea how to move forward from here.",1,1746542700.0,askgaybros,6,1.0,False

Have never made a box, but have plenty of tools and am handy enough to do so. Help?","Originally posted this in /r/babyloss, but it is probably more fitting here. For context, my wife and I lost our baby girl Hadley to a stillborn birth at 20 weeks last October.

We have a 2.5 year old son, and are expecting another son now in September. It will be a boy, and we just had an in-depth 20 week scan that went perfectly (huge emotional milestone for us).


I recently read a book that was specifically geared towards men and their grieving process, and how it differs from women. One thing it recommended is to use creative energy to ""give"" something to the baby.

To make a long story short (full explanation on my post in /r/babyloss), I have been struggling recently. Through therapy, reading books, and deep reflection, I've found that I need to direct some of my energy in a positive, creative way- making this box is a perfect way to do that. I got very emotional last night just thinking about it.

I'm fairly handy- my Dad is a savant Jack-of-all-trades, and I've learned from him steadily over the years. This won't be my first woodworking project- I've built picture frames, coffee tables, a mud room, and reboarded my back deck recently. I have a great Miter saw, nail gun, drill set, electric sander and various grit sanding paper, hammer/nails, etc. But I've never made a box.

Is there anyone here who can guide me in the direction of where to get started? Maybe a site that has blueprints for projects like this? I want this to be beautiful and very special, so while I could definitely figure it out from scratch, having a blueprint or at least starting point would be really beneficial. Also what other tools would be necessary- I figured a Kreg pockethole kit may be nice to have for this, but unsure of what else I may need. Also unsure of where to source great wood for this- again, I want it to be really nice, so a nice cherry, maple, or walnut with a nice stain is what I would be looking for I believe. but I don't think your standard hardware stores have these.

I really appreciate any feedback, thanks for reading.",2,1746542662.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,1,0.75,False
1kg69ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1kg69ct/i_feel_like_mb_doesnt_deserve_a_mothers_day_gift/,I feel like MB doesn't deserve a Mothers Day gift,"Hi everyone! Usually with my former families I always had the kids do a cute little craft to give to their Mom‚Äôs on Mother's Day. I always look forward to it and happily spend my own money on the supplies. Now, this might sound harsh but I don't think my current MB deserves my time or money to create a Mothers Day craft. 

Here‚Äôs why.. She doesn't work at all but avoids her kids like its full time job. She is literally home all day every day unless she has a beauty appointment, out shopping for herself or on a coffee/lunch date with a friend. When she is home she sits on her phone, watches tv or works out. She literally has nothing to do but manages not to spend a moment with her kids. She has me on full time, a cleaning crew, laundry lady & grocery shopper/assistant. The kids are pretty used to being ignored by her and really have no connection with her. They always look for me and will only hug me, they refuse to hug Mom which is super awkward.

Like I said Mom doesn't work yet she has me take care of the kids M-F  7 am to 6 pm and Saturdays 1 pm until 9 pm. Side note: As much as I complain about the long hours I do need the money. I just can‚Äôt believe anyone needs that much childcare. It also makes me angry for the kids because they deserve loving, attentive parents. When I arrive in the mornings both kids are awake, crying and in soaked diapers. MB and DB have white noise machines outside their bedroom and the kids to muffle the cries so THEIR peace is ruined. At the end of the day I have to give them baths, put them in their pajamas and feed them dinner because MB can't be bothered to do so. I leave at 6pm and MB puts the kids in their rooms at 6:15 for the night even though they don't fall asleep until 8-8:30 p.m. MB basically refuses to be alone with the kids because if I‚Äôm not there then her Mother in Law is. On the very rare occasion she is completely alone with them she sits them in front of the TV and they watch movies all day. MB basically acts as if they‚Äôre my kids, the other day after I gave her several warnings that the kids were low on diapers she told me that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more than welcome to go out abd buy some‚Äù. Also DB is just as bad, he technically works but I swear he doesn‚Äôt do a damn thing all day because he is usually just hanging out with MB. 

So yeah I might sound petty don't plan on having the kids do anything for her. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Last month I was just about to give my notice then MB told me they‚Äôre moving to Florida. Luckily that happens in 2 weeks! I literally have a countdown. ",12,1746542655.0,Nanny,7,0.77,False

***Wednesday***

Lar‚Äôee sat at the kitchen table of Rory‚Äôs home, watching one of the senior staff putter around the kitchen in search of something to do. Lar‚Äôee was willing to bet this man was the head servant rather than the cook. The way he carried himself said he was more than a guard‚Äîcertainly no kitchen help since he didn‚Äôt know how to use half of the items in the kitchen ‚Äîbut far from just a security chief.

After Lar‚Äôee had introduced himself and Rory had vouched for his presence over the phone, the man made Lar‚Äôee a mediocre coffee, which appeared to max out his culinary range.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to wait with me if you don‚Äôt want to,‚Äù Lar‚Äôee said, sipping on the drink just to be social. ‚ÄúAs soon as Rory gets in, we‚Äôll be heading out for the day anyway.‚Äù

The man gave a formal dip of his head. ‚ÄúAs appreciated as that offer is, sir, it wouldn‚Äôt feel right going back to bed while a guest of Mister Nascerdios waited for him.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you worried I‚Äôm going to steal things?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo one steals from this family, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know. I don‚Äôt know if you saw me here the other day talking to Rory, but since then I‚Äôve changed my surname back to what I was born with.‚Äù He held out his hand, as if he were meeting the man for the first time. ‚ÄúLar‚Äôee Nascerdios.‚Äù

The man‚Äôs eyes widened, even as he took Lar‚Äôee‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúHe said you were Larry Laffer.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was. After I became Larry Laffer, one of the other family members came up with that insidious game to try and drive me back into the fold. I‚Äôm not that easily intimidated.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou would be a rare breed then, sir,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúThat game series was horrendous.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you know I‚Äôm not about to steal anything, right?‚Äù

A wry smile ghosted over the man‚Äôs lips. ‚ÄúMaybe so‚Äîbut I still wouldn‚Äôt leave a distinguished guest to his own devices. What if you need a refill on your coffee?‚Äù

Lar‚Äôee looked at him, trying to figure out if he was joking or not, especially when the coffee pot was right there, still full of coffee. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said, reaching into his pocket for his phone. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if I can‚Äôt light a fire under your boss, and then you can be free to find your bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs you say, sir.‚Äù

Lar‚Äôee tapped Rory‚Äôs name in his ‚ÄòMystallian‚Äô list and brought his phone up to his ear. It took four attempts that rang out before the racer picked up. ‚ÄúWhich do you think is faster, lad? You, your motorbike ‚Ä¶ *or me?‚Äù* Lar‚Äôee allowed his voice to drop to sub-zero, his mood plummeting just as fast after the run-around.

‚ÄúYou, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you‚Äôd better wrap up whatever the fuck it is you‚Äôre doing and get your ass back here! You‚Äôve got three minutes after I hang up. One second after that, and one of your limbs will become my protein source for the day, capiche?‚Äù

Rory hung up instead of answering.

Exactly two and a half minutes later, he appeared between Lar‚Äôee and the living room, huffing and puffing. All he wore was the lower half of his riding armour. The rest was folded over at his hips with the arms down near his bare feet. The zips halfway down his shins that allowed his feet to fit were both open. Although the armour was dry, Rory was saturated, reminding Lar‚Äôee of a pissed off cat after a bath. He straightened up with his phone still in his right hand.

Lar‚Äôee couldn‚Äôt help but raise a critical eyebrow at him.

‚ÄúOh, get fucked, y‚Äô prick. It was a long day, and I went for a quick swim across the Paterswoldsemeer and back to loosen up. I was a good two hundred meters offshore when you called, and I had to leg it before someone else heard my phone and came looking.‚Äù

Lar‚Äôee squinted, taking in the dry armour once more. ‚ÄúYou normally do that naked?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen it‚Äôs dark and no one‚Äôs gonna to see me, mate, yeah. It‚Äôs relaxing. After that, I realm-step straight into my bathroom ‚Ä¶ unless my phone‚Äôs getting blown up by some nameless dickhead hell-bent on threatening me. Thanks for that.‚Äù

Larry huffed out a breath and stepped back from his previous stance. ‚ÄúOkay, in my defence, I thought you were blowing me off again.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you thought wrong, so why are you here now?‚Äù His gaze slid to the left as if he‚Äôd only just realised they weren‚Äôt alone. ‚ÄúMorning, Lyle. Why don‚Äôt you go back to bed? I‚Äôve got this.‚Äù His thumb rolled in Lar‚Äôee‚Äôs direction. ‚ÄúThis arsehole doesn‚Äôt know that some people enjoy sleeping at night.‚Äù

‚ÄúVery well. Goodnight, gentlemen,‚Äù the servant/butler/whatever he was said, and vacated the room.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt act surprised, Rory. I said I‚Äôd come and get you this morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly! I waited half the morning for you to turn up, and you didn‚Äôt show! I wasn‚Äôt going to waste any more time than that. Some of us have got shit to do, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said I‚Äôd be here Wednesday morning, New York time. It‚Äôs five AM over there. If anything, I‚Äôm early.‚Äù

Lar‚Äôee knew Rory had internalised to review the conversation, no doubt hoping for something he could use to win the argument. His smug smile a moment later said as much. ‚ÄúYou said I had until eight‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI said Charlie would expect you at eight. You and I need a plan of action before we get over there. This is going to be a fully enclosed garage that will need superior soundproofing and ventilation to make sure no one dies or gets a noise complaint. If that‚Äôs not currently available to humans‚Äîand you‚Äôd know better than me, you need to think about exactly what you need to achieve that result. Then I need to figure out what living entities I can draw on to produce it. All of which is going to take time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never agreed to all of that!‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. This is the game plan, and you need to get with the program.‚Äù

Rory bared his teeth. ‚ÄúFirst things first, I‚Äôm gonna have a fucking shower, and if you‚Äôve got a problem with that, you can kiss my immortal ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you eaten yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could grab you something to eat while you‚Äôre in the shower. Consider it a peace offering, since this will be a collaboration between us.‚Äù

Rory polished his upper teeth with his tongue. ‚ÄúI could go a pizza or two while we discuss our options.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave it with me.‚Äù Lar‚Äôee nodded and realm-stepped away‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and appeared in the alcove of Llyr‚Äôs apartment in New York City. He walked through the living room and into the kitchen, arrowing in on Voila. His inner radar for his wards put them both asleep in their rooms, but he searched the kitchen anyway, his faith in Robbie‚Äôs innate growing by the day.

He wasn‚Äôt disappointed when he saw the note on the electronic pad of the double door refrigerator. It was a list of three different pizzas, along with the message, *‚Äò6 bottles XXXX Gold on the bottom shelf of the fridge. Enjoy. R.‚Äô*

*Six?* Lar‚Äôee opened the door and found the bottles on their side in a plastic bag with a man‚Äôs face and Dan Murphy‚Äôs printed on the sides, right where Robbie said it would be. He‚Äôd never heard of the beer or this Dan Murphy character and had to assume they were bought with Rory in mind. Ironic that Robbie probably had no idea who he was putting this together for, just that it needed to happen. That boy needed his likeness carved onto a monolith!

After he removed the beer, he shut the door and went to Voila, scoping his sight to re-read the list of pizzas from across the room, picturing each one before lifting Voila‚Äôs lid.

Two minutes later, Lar‚Äôee was back at Rory‚Äôs, spreading out the dinner plate-sized pizzas and putting three beers on either side of the table. Rory appeared a short time later, freshly dressed in jeans and a button-up shirt. He breathed in appreciatively as he entered the room. ‚ÄúThat smells fantastic,‚Äù he drooled. ‚ÄúAnd I was literally eating authentic Italian pizza on the weekend.‚Äù He came over and slid into his seat, reaching for the beer first. He swallowed two deep mouthfuls, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, then cast his eyes over the options.

Without further ado, he took a slice from each pizza, stacked them so that the crust was on the outside top and bottom, and took a bite out of all three. ‚ÄúHoly fuck,‚Äù he moaned, torn between chewing and melting into his seat. ‚ÄúWho the fuck do I have to kill to get my hands on whoever made these pizzas?‚Äù He ate as he talked, demolishing those three slices in seconds and reaching for another ‚Äòsandwich‚Äô of pizza slices.

‚ÄúA chef who‚Äôs way out of your league.‚Äù Wondering if he was missing out, Lar‚Äôee tried the stack himself. As the flavours exploded and blended together in his mouth, he licked the sauce off his lips. ‚ÄúOh, hell yeah. This is the bomb.‚Äù

‚ÄúLord Takumi?‚Äù

‚ÄúNope. His protege.‚Äù

So, let me share a little experiment I dove into last week that's honestly too wild not to talk about... **Nasal Breathing**! Heard of it? 

I stumbled upon some research suggesting that **breathing through your nose can boost energy and focus**. ü§Ø Skeptical yet curious, I decided to commit to it for 7 days. Here's what happened:

- **Day 1-2:** I won't lie, it felt weird. I caught myself mouth-breathing 100 times a day. Like, why is this simple thing so hard? üòÖ But as I consciously closed my mouth and focused on breathing through the nose, something unexpected happened...I felt calmer. Less fidgety.

- **Day 3-4:** My energy levels started shifting. Still had the 3 PM yawns, but felt more sustained focus. I wasn‚Äôt bouncing off the walls, but I wasn‚Äôt ready to crash either. Steady is the game!

- **Days 5-6:** This was the *aha* moment. By now, nasal breathing was almost automatic. Noticed I was reminiscent of a Zen monk‚Äîokay, slight exaggeration, but you get the point. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- **Day 7:** Afternoon slumps? Reduced. Focus? Sharper. Overall mood? Chilling with the Dalai Lama vibes. 

What science says: **Nasal breathing can improve oxygen circulation, increase nitric oxide production (hello, brain boost!), and enhance relaxation all at once.** Who knew airways could work magic?

Alright, so maybe I'm not ALL the way sold on ditching coffee breaks. ‚òï But, there's definitely something transformative about this nasal venture. Feeling more grounded, less frazzled in the chaos of daily grind? Worth the effort.

Anyone else tried this? Or maybe you've got another quirky habit that keeps you going when the afternoon drags? ü§î Would love to hear your stories/thoughts!

**1. Ditch the Tie (Most Days):** A well-fitted blazer and button-down with no tie instantly feels more relaxed. Add a pocket square for polish without being overdressed.

**2. Swap Dress Shoes for Loafers or Minimal Sneakers:** If your workplace leans casual, crisp leather sneakers (think Koio or Oliver Cabell) can modernize your look. Otherwise, go for suede loafers or brogues.

**3. Mix Suit Pieces:** Break the monotony by mixing your navy blazer with grey trousers or vice versa. It still looks intentional but feels less rigid.

**4. Play With Layers:** Try adding a merino wool turtleneck or a fine-knit polo under your blazer for a fresh take, especially in fall or winter.

**5. Fit Is Everything:** You don't need a designer label ‚Äî just make sure your suit is tailored well. Even a mid-range suit can look like a million bucks if it hugs you right.

Once I play one of these pre-recorded live shows I get 2-3 acoustic performances by the artist, but then it starts playing random coffee house music that isn't by the artist. The timeline shows about 5 hours total for the show. So...I'm not sure how to listen to more than just a couple of songs and instead get the full hour.

For local businesses in Melbourne, SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is one of the most powerful tools to attract nearby customers and grow consistently. üìà

Did you know? ü§î

  
üëâ **46% of all Google searches are looking for local information**  
üëâ **88% of consumers who do a local search on their smartphone visit or call a store within a day**

That means if your business isn‚Äôt showing up in local search results, you're missing out on a huge chunk of potential customers in your area. üò±

Melbourne is a bustling, competitive city filled with cafes, retail stores, tradies, healthcare providers, and more. Local SEO helps your business rank on Google Maps, appear in ‚Äúnear me‚Äù searches, and get more reviews ‚Äî all of which build trust and visibility. üåê‚≠ê

Whether you‚Äôre in Carlton, South Yarra, or Footscray, SEO ensures that your local audience finds **you** before your competitors. It also allows you to target keywords like *""best coffee shop in Melbourne""* or *""emergency plumber in Brunswick""*, driving real traffic that converts. üíº

Unlike paid ads, SEO gives you long-term results without recurring costs. It‚Äôs an investment that keeps paying off! üí∏

As someone who thrives on early-morning coffee rituals, I was eager to put this compact coffee machine to daily use. While my overall experience has been positive, there are some nuances that stood out.

**Compact Design Perfect for Small Spaces**

The first thing that caught my eye was its sleek, stainless steel finish paired with a modern design that complements any kitchen aesthetic. It's small enough to fit snugly in my limited counter space, yet functional enough to deliver a full coffee experience. The removable water reservoir and compact size feel purposeful, saving both space and effort when refilling water. However, despite its thoughtful design, I did notice a slight wobble on my counter because of its lightweight structure.

**Efficient Brewing Made Simple**

Nothing beats the efficiency of this coffeemaker on rushed mornings. Its fully automatic operation gets my coffee brewed in minutes without requiring constant attention. The Brew Pause¬Æ feature comes in handy when I can‚Äôt possibly wait until the full pot is done‚ÄîI can easily sneak a quick cup mid-brew! I‚Äôve tested this feature repeatedly, and the result has been consistent: no spills or drips, just a warm cup of coffee waiting for me.  

[Check Cuisinart DCC-5570NAS price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0b3g5z7dr/)

**Keeps Coffee Warm But Briefly**

One of the standout aspects is the 30-minute warming plate. I appreciate that my second refill stays almost as hot as the first, though it‚Äôs not a game changer for slow drinkers like me. After half an hour, the warming shuts off automatically, which I suppose is a safety feature, but it can be inconvenient if you like to sip your coffee over an hour or two.

**Reusable Filter: A Nod to Sustainability**

The permanent nylon coffee filter is another feature I‚Äôve come to appreciate for its eco-friendly appeal. Unlike having to replace paper filters repeatedly, this reusable option saves both money and hassle. It‚Äôs relatively easy to clean, but finer coffee grounds can get stuck, which might frustrate those who prefer a perfectly smooth cleanup process. 

**Not for the Caffeine Gluttons**

With its capacity limited to 5 cups (measured with smaller coffee cups), this model is ideal for one to two people or a small household. I personally found the size just right for my solo morning indulgence, but might not recommend it for gatherings or homes with multiple coffee drinkers.

**Highlights**

- Compact, space-saving design fits small countertops.  
- Brew Pause¬Æ allows you to pour a cup mid-cycle without a mess.  
- Nylon reusable filter is budget-friendly and eco-conscious.  
- Designed for simple operation with an easy On/Off switch.  

**Critiques**

- Lightweight build may feel less stable on certain surfaces.  
- The warming plate shuts off after 30 minutes, limiting prolonged use.  
- Cleaning finer bits from the nylon filter can require extra patience.  

**Product Contenders**

Compared to other models, such as the BLACK+DECKER 5-Cup Coffeemaker, this product's stainless steel carafe feels more premium and durable. However, the BLACK+DECKER offers a longer warming plate time, which is a bonus for those who dislike reheating coffee. On the high-end spectrum, the Breville Bambino Plus offers more brewing customization, though at a much steeper price. The Cuisinart appliance strikes a balance between affordability and practicality, making it a perfect entry-level choice for compact homes.

**Worth Every Penny?**

This product sits in a reasonable pricing tier for drip coffee machines, especially considering the stainless steel carafe, programmable features, and convenient design. Compared to high-end coffee makers with complex functionalities, it provides ample value without complicating things. While it may not suit a coffee aficionado searching for barista-style espresso, it fulfills the daily caffeine fix for casual coffee drinkers effortlessly.

1kg5rzq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kg5rzq,Tried coffee break and by the fireplace decants and..,"So I finally got my hands on By The Fireplace and Coffee Break by Replica/Maison Margiela and I have to say it‚Äôs very unexpected from what I thought of. 

1) Coffee break - Well it was one of the WORST scents I have ever smelled. I don‚Äôt even understand how people are liking but that‚Äôs just my opinion (and skin). 
So it was strong for a cologne that‚Äôs for sure because I washed it off right after spraying vigours might I add and its been more than 5 hours and its till sitting on my skim that if my hand is near my face , I can smell it well. 
On first spray, smell of lavender just blasted into my face and there was almost no vanilla on me. I can smell it if I sniff up close. 
There‚Äôs definitely woody smell , some kind of spice which is oddly non irritating , somewhat of a lactonic note and no coffee at all. I would never buy this or recommend but if you are a lavender lover maybe you can give it a try. I would personally give it 1/10 .

2) By the fireplace - This one was interesting and really does remind of warm feeling when you sit by a fireplace. You can definitely smell both wood and vanilla at once but wood is pretty prominent with that slight smokiness to it. For first 10 mins I was mainly able smell wood with a hint of vanilla in background. After that I was able to appreciate spicy smell and vanilla a little more but the vibe is very different kinda indescribable. It creates a feeling of sitting by the fireplace but more like in jungle than home because it has mild earthiness to it as well but that maybe because of my skin chemistry and weather as it‚Äôs raining here today. It‚Äôs a good smell but not a safe blind buy or a regular wear for me even in winters. I would get myself a mini maybe. 
I would rate it a 6.5-7/10

I recently decided, after being put on disability due to severe arthritis, that sitting on my ass is getting boring, and unhealthy. So I have decided to change up my backyard to get me off my widening ass and get busy.

My backyard is huge for a townhouse, I'm an end-unit next to a walking path. The lawn is 650 square metres that slopes towards the path abruptly leaving me with approximately 500 square meters of mostly flat backyard to play with. An arborist told me that my backyard is mostly clay and non-draining, and that's the problem. My wife and I need (because of a city by-law) to plant some trees to replace a couple of unwanted trees which we're having removed (I will not miss you, Austrian Pine).

So! My question revolves around my idea for making my soil drain better with a 'soil lasagna'. I have dug 2 spots in my backyard and added H√ºgelkultur/farmers drain style trenches towards the sloped hill. I stripped the sod and topsoil, dug down approximately 50cm, dumped in each a yard waste bag full of mulched leaves I kept from last fall into both holes, grass clippings, a bunch of old stale dry cereal, coffee grounds, etc. and topped that all with recently cut twigs, sticks, and branches up to 30-40mm, then refilled the hole. I refilled it first with the sod and topsoil, then the rest of the dirt that I dug out.

The trees need to be planted within 1 year of having my existing trees removed. I've spoken to the arborist and I'll be keeping the chipped trees to add on top of these dug spots.

So to finally ask my question, did I just do all of this work aggravating my arthritis for no reason? Or do I have a chance?

Thanks!

If anyone is wondering, we plan on putting in a few Eastern Redbuds (Pansy and a Flamethrower, with a couple Rising Sun's eventually), all of which are pretty much non-existent in my area.",1,1746541409.0,arborists,0,1.0,False

You know how it is, right? Anyway, the barista suddenly called out my name with a big smile and said, ""You know, your vibes are great. Keep rocking them!""

The first one was from her phone of a misunderstanding we had 4 months ago of which I was confronting her on a subject where I felt hurt. When I talked to her in person about it she said she had no idea of how it happened and I should of called her on the matter instead of sending her question mark texts. 

 The second was this morning from MY phone about keeping her schedule open in regards to meeting her for meeting her for coffee after she got back from her vacation when her schedule opened up more..that was a over a month ago.

My friend and I have a long and fairly good personal relationship. We text and message often on a variety of subjects. So accidently replying like that is highly unlikely.",1,1746541031.0,techadvice,1,0.99,False

I have been diving deep to reach out to manufacturer of this product to import it bulk.
However it is hard to research anything if you dont speak the native language and the vietnam is especially harder on this matter

You know, woke up late, spilled coffee on myself right before an important video call, and just a string of other little disasters. I was feeling super overwhelmed and kinda on the verge of tears.

My sister stopped by unexpectedly, and she could probably tell I wasn't doing great. Without a word, she just wrapped me in this big, warm hug. It was one of those hugs that felt like she was holding me together when I felt like falling apart. Somehow, that simple gesture of just holding onto me meant everything.

We just stayed like that for a bit... and honestly, it was like a reset button. I felt calmer and more grounded after, and it reminded me how powerful physical touch can be for comfort and support. She's not usually a super touchy-feely person unless it really matters, so it really hit home for me how much she cares. It's amazing how something so simple can make such a big difference.",1,1746540885.0,LoveLanguageStories,0,1.0,False
