PART 1,"   Hi, let me preface this post, by making it clear that I've never written a Creepy Pasta before. This is my first venture into that sort of territory and honestly I probably wouldn't be caught dead writing one- that is.. if it wasn't for the fact that after all that's happened, I've been feeling that I need to find a place to write this all down. 

Maybe its just a way for me to come to terms with the reality of it all, to reassure myself that its all real. Or maybe by putting this story into something like Creep Cast I can reassure myself that I dreamed it up.. sort of establish that it is.. in fact.. fiction. 

But something tells me it won't be that simple.  Either way. I need to write this down. I need to put  this out there somewhere for somebody to find. For somebody to know.  I don't think Im in any danger, but I also get the feeling that what I'm about to talk about isn't exactly something I'm supposed to know, so who knows if I'll ever get another opportunity to say anything about this? 

Anyways, down to the meat of the matter.  Several weeks ago I was called by my friend Lisa who worked down at a gas station near River Flow Drive.. a little ways away from a sleepy college town called Dahlonega.  I lived in Atlanta, about an hour's drive out, so it really wasn't common for us to meet up after Lisa graduated College.   I still had about a year's worth of credits to get before I could join her and start searching for the starving artist job of my dreams, so most of my connection to her was kept through phone calls, texts and the occasional once a month trip into the Appalachian Trail.   Overall she was a very good friend to me, and in spite of how friends just seem to fall out of contact after a little bit after separations like this- she and I just couldn't fall apart like that. We just vibed you know? Not sure how to explain it. 

""Heya Mickey, how's tricks?"" Lisa's voice came over the speaker as I slid my Bamboo pen over my digital drawing pad.  We usually did voice calls over texts, cause my hands were always full. 

""Ah same old same old."" I muttered.  ""Got commisssions. Need to get an essay done for Mr. Flanders again.. and I still have no idea why I took metaphysics."" 

""In other words, you're still near broke."" said Lisa, her voice almost tracing the sly smile I knew she had to be wearing. 

""Shit Lisa.. no need to rub it in."" I said, smirking back and rolling my eyes as I continued to draw, switching the layers on my editing software with a few taps of my pen. ""You wouldn't be taunting me on this if you didn't have something for me though. So spill."" 

""Okay, so get this Micky.. Friend of mine, Terrance. He works at Game Stop right? Apparently its this different sort of Game Stop, more high end than the typical stores, pays a TON. He's going on vacay for a couple of weeks and needs somebody to fill in.  30 bucks a fuckin' hour!"" 

I felt my stomach twist and my mouth go dry,  I tried to say something intelligent. Like ask if there was a catch, or maybe if there were any special requirements, or why they didn't just ask for an employee from another nearby location to handle it. But instead my near broke deadass brain managed to simply say. ""Wut?"" 

""HA!  'wut' she says. Yeah.. you heard me. 30 bucks an hour, several weeks. And all you need to do is I don't know- whatever Game Stop employees do. Stock shelves and shit."" 

Stock shelves and shit. For 30 dollars an hour? That couldn't be right. I had seen the size of Game Stops before. They were small enough that usually a single employee could probably manage the whole place on a good day. At least to me it always seemed that way whenever I needed to get my controllers replaced.  I honestly ordered most of my game stuff online nowadays.   Last time I was excited to go to Game Stop was when I used to go get those fun event limited Pokemon for my 3DS.. and even then I never stayed  to do anything else. 

Maybe I just didnt' know enough about game retailing?  I don't know.  I trusted Lisa, and I needed the cash. 

""So they just need me to fill in and that's it?"" I asked, pausing to put down my pen and sip my coffee so I could begin to drink it all in. 

""I know it seems a BIT too good to be true, but trust me, this isn't the typical Game Stop. I think its a store for some special clientelle. I'm not exactly good on the specifics, but they also apparently need more help there to begin with anyways, so they want this to also be a trial run for a potential new employee. Full Time. ""  Lisa said.  ""Terrance is a childhood friend of mine, so no worries, I know he's legit. Just- at least go to the interview and see what they're about. If it seems bad, back out and we can talk about it- sound good?"" 

I sighed, weighing my limited options as my eyes scaled over my dingey dorm filled with stacks of Ramen Dinners in the corner and literally nothing else. 

My stomach clawed at my spine, as if daring me to pass up the opportunity to afford a real meal.

""Fuck it, lets do this."" I said. 

""YES! I'll send the address. Be there tomorrow, six pm sharp. They just wanna do an interview, nothing really major. Terrance will meet you there. "" 

The drive up was around 35 minutes. Overall, that was great for me. With my classes and my commissions, a good commute time was  good sign overall. 

The Game Stop however, wasn't like any other store location I had ever been to before.  Usually Game Stops from what I remembered were in malls or outlets. They never had their own big location like  Walmart or Costco.   But this one.. well.. when the building came into view I had to do a double take.

The Game Stop logo sat above the building much like you would see the logo of Target or Home Depot on their own large stores. Full on concrete, huge sliding double doors. I could see what Lisa meant when she said it wasn't like other Game Stop locations. 

Maybe Game Stop had upped its game since the last time I went. But I couldn't imagine that being the case given the state of Game Stop's stock before that one incident I think most are aware of.  Either way, this explained why they were looking for more employees.

There were no cars in the parkinglot except for a pure black SUV and what appeared to be a very old looking Ford Mustang. 

Terrance was waiting for me outside the large transparent automatic doors. He seemed like a handsome enough guy with sandy hair, a somewhat fit thin frame, half a stubble and what passed for a kind enough smile. Glasses perched jauntily on his long nose as he slid a clipboard under his arm and held out his free hand to shake mine.  ""Hey, you must be.. Mikoto right?"" 

""Micky is fine."" I said as I took his hand.  ""Big place you have here."" 

""Awesome right?"" He said, looking over his shoulder at the place. ""Big as it is, we only take a select few customers. Not many people in the lower end of the company even know it exists.  Come on, lets get you introduced to the ol' place."" 

He gestured for me to follow him inside, and I nearly hesitated. There was something odd about what he said. What kind of store was this?   Whatever it was that bothered me ,though, it definitely didn't bother me enough to admire the store for what it was. 

Rows upon rows of shelves filled to the brim with pcs.. controllers, boxes, headsets different kinds of gear as far as the eye could see.  It truly was a  ""What if Department Stores were run by Steam?"" sort of scenario. 

There were various acloves, sort of like Home Depot or IKEA where different gaming furniture, Monitor setups and gaming desks were set up with running systems connected so you could sit down, play and test out how everything ran.    Until today, I wasn't even sure if it was possible to run a department store that purely dedicated to gaming and only gaming. Even large PC super centers sold vacuums and washing machines sometimes.  

The further into the store I followed Terrence however, the more I started to notice a few weird things that stuck in my mind. 

There were sectioned off shelves near the center of the store where Consoles were primarily being shown off.   One of the waist high shelves, marked with a flag saying ""E-21112-ON LOCATION- showed off stuff I knew. XBox Ones,  PS4s and PS5s, Steam Decks, ROG Allies, The Switch 2. Even what looked like very nice refurbished Gamecubes and Gameboy Advances.  It made me kind of drool and I felt an urge to ask 'how much' for the Charizard Orange GBA SP in the corner of the end of the shelf. 

Then... we got to a shelf marked ""E-21113-DAILY RESTOCK"".. and it was filled with game systems I had NEVER heard of in my life.   The Play Sphere X50. Jolly Joy Handhelds. Meat Canyon Simulator 2027.   And the controllers. They didn't look like anything I had seen even. 

  
It got stranger the farther in we went, with some shelves holding the most weird ass devices I had ever seen in my life. One game console was what appeared to be a large metal bubble with a glass port hole where coral could be seen growing inside.. coral that seemed to twitch..   Controllers were plugged into it with wires, and the way their handles and triggers were designed in a twisting entertwining fashion all around what looked like 2 foot long handles, suggested that holding it meant you might have to wrap your limbs around them in the same fashion an octopus would, and you'd probably have to be jointless and boneless to pull it off.

""The fuck?"" I grunted. 

Terrance heard me and smiled back over his shoulder. ""Yeah.. like I said.. special place. Don't worry though, customers don't really shop here in person. Its rare they ever do actually. Most of our stuff is call in and delivery. Makes for a pretty quiet job and honestly you'll hear no complaints from me on that end."" 

As we strode towards a large door marked ""STAFF ONLY"" I caught a group of shelves filled with what appeared to be the physical game boxes. The actual cases holding the disks meant to be slotted in to whatever PC or Console was capable of playing them. 

And I was immediately confused. 

I caught a glimpse of some of the titles. Nothing strange there-

Battlefield 6, Pokemon ZA, Ghost of Yotei- some of the latest titles and.. in spite of the fact I knew at least one of the titles there ran on a completely exclusive system, they were all in the same style of box. 

A DVD-Bluray style case with NO labels indicating for what game console they were, what their rating was.  In fact I could only make out one large sticker slapped on each case, with what appeared to be sharpie hastily written down on each one. 

""Safe"",  ""Mild Danger"" ,  Seemed to be the words I saw the most. As well as ""Can be reasoned with"" and other weird indicators.  One box of ""Despicable Me the Game"" came with a label saying ""Fucking Christ don't open this Marcus, I swear."" 

And the weirdest part. All of them were padlocked and wrapped to slots in the shelves with what appeared to be bike chains. 

""You'll learn about that in a sec."" said Terrence as he caught me eying the shelves.  ""It won't make sense at first but- it's important."" 

We got settled in an office with a security desk that had various monitors showing parts of the store, and a bunch of plush couches. 

On the wall of the office there was a large rack holding what I assumed were replicas of items from various Video games. 

Kratos's Leviathan Axe from God of War,  Aloy's bow from the Horizon series,  a large hazmat suit that looked quite a bit like it came from Lethal Company.  Hot damn. This was some store.   Except it was weird how they were displayed.  Along with other game replicas, they seemed to be half hazardly stuffed up there, like they had been placed over there as an afterthought rather than displayed for the sake of displaying. Maybe they were also for sale and this was just where they kept all of it.

""Okay then."" Terrence said as he got settled on the desk and I took the nearest seat. ""So.. Mikoto Kamisato..  22.. born May 2nd... sound about right?"" 

I nodded as Terrence took out a ball point pen and scribbled down on a sheet of paper.  ""Okay. Now Just to make sure you're aware, this is a trial employment. You're pretty much subbing my vacancy till I get back from vacation. You'll be here with two other guys who'll show you the ropes. Shift's from 6 am to 6 pm Monday to Wednesday.  From what Lisa told me it shouldn't interfere with your classes right?"" 

""Yeeeaaah?"" I said, wondering when the typical interview questions were going to come up. 

""Alright."" He said, nodding. ""Just about covers it. Welcome to the Game Stop Family!"" 

""Wait hold on!"" I said. ""That's it? I'm in!? Just like that? No interview or-?"" 

""Look my vacay starts tomorrow, I don't have time to be picky."" said Terrence, his expression apologetic. ""That's what the trial shift is for. Consider the time till I come back the actual interview- to uh, see if you're a good fit for the job.  That is- if you're okay with it."" 

I sighed. Truth be told, I was going to accept the job regardless. It was a physical location that existed, and honestly I was tired of Ramen noodles every night. Nothing really screamed ""Red Flag"" at me. Just.. ""weird"" but not in a way that told me to run for my life really.  Worst case scenario, the games were either pirated or actually porn- which wouldn't make sense cause what do you think the internet was for? 

I tried for as polite a smile as I could and shrugged. ""I guess I'm okay with it."" 

Terrence smiled again, this time looking relieved. Considering that his vacation was tomorrow and I didn't see anyone else waiting in the wings for an interview, I guess I could understand.  ""Nice. Again, sorry about how abrupt everything is. Now, we just need to make some measurements for your uniform and- uh.. RIGHT big thing, can't forget this."" 

Terrence handed me a large manilla envelope. ""This might seem strange, heck you might even think its a joke- feel free to think its a stupid hazing ritual if you want-  but I need you to memorize this. Company policy."" 

I felt by brow furrow as I took the envelope tentatively. The paper felt.. warm to the touch, like it was generating its own heat. 

""We'll sign your temp contract tomorrow. But only if you can remember what's in there."" said Terrence. ""If you can't remember everything, then I'll have to cancel my vacay and you're out."" 

I gulped. Well this was one way to put on pressure. ""Wh-what is it?"" 

""Nothing too hard to memorize trust me."" said Terrence. ""Just take some time tonight to let it sink in, and as long as you know the important points you'll be good."" 

I drove back to my dorm that night feeling a mixture of emotions that I couldn't place. Nerves? Slight fear? Premonitions?  I don't know.  Either way, it was just strange enough to have me wondering what exactly I had gotten myself into and whether it was too late to get out. 

But each time these thoughts plagued my mind, the vision of dollars slipping into my wallet immediately stifled my misgivings. 

That night, I sat down on my bed and slid open the envelope. 

The paper inside was even warmer than the envelope itself, making me realize that this was the reason why the envelope had heated up in the first place. The paper felt like it had its own heat source. 

It didn't take long to see why. The spidery handwriting on the page was glowing like orange coals. The letters thin and neat and yet almost stick-like. Almost like I was looking at the glowing letters on the One Ring from Lord of the Rings, and yet there seemed to be a movement to it- as if the hand that took its time to transcribe the burning ink had long thin fingers that fluidly moved the quill that had been its instrument of communication. 

I nearly dropped the letter in shock as I looked the writing up and down, trying to find some sort of logical explanation for the burning ink.  After about a half hour of this, the letters began to hiss and cool, the orange glow dying down into smoke. 

Huh,  that was.. umm.. I honestly didn't know what to make of it, so I shook my head and began to read. 

  
""Greetings Mikoto, and welcome to the Game Stop E-21112 Location Family"" 

Weird, I don't think I ever saw them take the paper out and write my name in front of me.. the thing was pre-sealed- but Lisa did give Terrence my name before I got there so this is probably nothing. 

""While we hope your time working with us is an enjoyable experience, to keep it that way we do wish for you to observe some rules.  Take note that these rules are non-negotiable, and failure to observe them could result in termination by loss of life or existence.  These punishments are not handed out by the company, but in fact are simply consequences of your failure."" 

I stopped reading at this point.  This was either a really bad prank, or the start to some really generic Creepy Pasta.

I looked at the now ordinary ink, remembering how it had burned moments ago.  

  
Hmmm... was I stupid? Or was I smart? 

  
Taking a deep breath, I sighed and slipped the paper back in the envelope. I then picked up my phone and prepared to call the store and tell them that I had decided not to take the job.  I have no idea if I was being overly paranoid, but I had read enough scary stories with stupid desperate protagonists to not have the alarm bells ringing in my ears. 

But as soon as brought my phone out of sleep mode, the same spidery writing met my eyes on the screen.. plastered against my Evangelion screen saver like a burning sigil. 

""Rule #1: All employees must clock in before 6'oclock at least exactly a minute before 5:59 AM. Failure to do so will result in severe consequences."" 

I shut my phone and dropped it with a squeak. I breathed hard, and nearly jumped out my own window as my tv suddenly burst on in a chorus of static- displaying more burning words. 

""Rule #2: All game cases in the game aisle must remain closed at all times. Patrols of the game aisle must be carried out between the hours of 2 pm and 3 pm by at least two employees. At least 2 rounds must be made of each aisle in this section every 15 minutes. Should you find an open case, alert the manager. Do not alert the location Boss. Further instructions will be given depending on which case is open. ""

The TV clicked and immediately it switched to the next rule. Through my daze of fear and shock, the 'totally done with this shit' side of my brain reasoned that the rules were probably so important, they wanted to make sure I read them by any means necessary, even if I was deciding against my employment.  At least, that was the theory.

""Rule #4: -"" 

I gripped my head. My ears and mind throbbed. It was only now that I realized that the inner voice that I had been reading the rules in.. wasn't MY voice.. or at least not the voice I was used to reading things in my head with.  It was .. smooth.. far too well mannered, and held a suave accent to it I could only assume was british or something. 

  
"" - All games with Horror genre, Horror tropes, or anything related to Horror inspired themes whether brief or not, must be locked in the QUARANTINE aisle. Patrols of this area must be carried out between 3 pm to 5 pm  by at least two employees.  Rounds of any number must be made on all sections at least more than once, and cannot be carried out alone. Employees must always keep full sight of each other at all times.  Should any case be found open, alert the Location Boss immediately. If you find yourself unable to leave, emergency caches filled with specialized tools are at your disposal. Most subjects are vulnerable to generic firearms. Some subjects may require more specialty gear. 

  
""Rule #5: Employees may bring games from home for recreation during breaks. However, these games whether mobile or otherwise must be kept away from either Game Aisles at all times. Failure to do so will result in immediate termination. 



""Rule  #6:  Do not bring in food from the outside. Sustenance will be provided to you between the hours of 12pm and 1 pm. Food must be consumed within that period and all traces of crumbs, sauce or other commodities related to said food must be sterilized and removed. Failure to do so will result in possible severe consequences.   


""Rule #7:  This store is managed by the Location Boss. They are not to be disturbed unless there is an incident with an on location customer or an incident with the Quarantine Section.  If there is an attempted theft or a Quarantine incident, use the controls on the security monitor to alert the Location Boss. They will send security to deal with it. DO NOT BE PRESENT OUTSIDE THE STAFF ROOMS OR DESIGNATED SAFE ZONES WHILE SECURITY IS ON PREMISES."" 

When the voice spoke the all caps letters, it didn't change tone, but my head throbbed, almost as if the severity of the rule stated was being drilled into my mind. I flinched, and nearly fell to my knees.  

  
""Rule #8:  Though rare, occasionally we will have in person customers. Before the customers enter, a warning will be sent to your phone. If the warning lists the customer as ""E-21112"" you may greet them physically as you would in any other store. Please keep them away from the game aisles. They may only peruse areas specifically dubbed 'E-21112 SAFE'.  Should your phone read a different number, please follow the signs to the nearest designated SAFE ZONE or return to the Staff Room. If there is an E-21112 customer in the store, direct them to said SAFE ZONE as well or direct them to the Staff Room if more convenient. Each Safe Zone will be fully equipped with distractions for your customer until the 'All Clear' is broadcasted. ""

I had fully submitted to the weirdness by now. I was now slumped on my couch, glaring at the tv, holding up my middle finger to whatever entity was in my head. I was DEFINITELY not taking this stupid job now.   


"" Rule #9:  All first time Employees must go through a 2 week trial period to ensure that this job is in fact right for them. These employees may leave employment at any time should they feel unsafe or uncomfortable. However, it is recommended that you wait until after work hours have ended before leaving the store. Doing so could result in loss of life. First time employees who survive the 2 week trial period will recieve a 2000 dollar bonus and a raise of up to 500 dollars an hour should they seek full employment."" 

I froze.  No.... NO... NOT THIS TROPE.. The all too common Creepy Pasta trope of- 'but the pay was way too good'. My weakness.

  
\- ""We thank you for your decision to join us, and should you decide to seek employment elsewhere, we wish you the best of luck.

  
\-Signed,  Nia Elizabeth Crowley Tothep- Regional 21112 Location Boss. 

Terrence Klein-  Store Manager. 

Marcus Simmons-  Deputy Manager. ""



My TV flickered off.  For a moment I just sat there, staring, wondering if that had all just been a kooky dream. 

Then I realized something. I could recall every rule word for word. The shapes of the letters themselves seemed to resonate in my head, and try as I might, I couldn't seem to forget any of it. 

Just to check, I picked up the envelope from before and withdrew the paper, scanning the now normal looking ink. 

Sure enough the spidery handwriting held every word in my head exactly, all the way down to the signature from the Regional 21112 Location Boss- whatever that meant. 

The 2000 dollar bonus and the 50 dollar an hour permanent Employment raise seemed to hang in my mind for a moment, dancing before my eyes like a worm wiggling on a fish hook.   This couldn't be a good idea.  Nothing that was worth that much money could possibly be this easy. 

And yet, I could feel my desperation clouding my sense of judgement and survival.  The job situation was not good at the moment. 

  
So now you find me here... typing away on reddit, wondering if I even experienced what I just experienced. The letter from the store is sitting next to me. Its there. I can touch it, it exists. But somehow I'm not entirely convinced.   I'm planning on posting this later.. by then I'll decide on whether I'll take the job.  If anyone has any advice for situations like these, I'd appreciate it- I'm not sure if stuff like this happens elsewhere- or if I should legit just call the cops.  

  
\-Until next time,  

Micky. 



Update:  I decided to give it a try- wish me luck.

Let's start with the most agonizing part of this evening: *Pick of the Day* missed in the final seconds of the Chicago Bulls game **thanks to a missed free throw**! I'd be lying if I said the below gif *wasn't* me as realization of said ""miss"" settled in:

[That's me – Belle! In the last 30 seconds of the game.](https://i.redd.it/187b8zi7lk0g1.gif)

I thought Chicago had the cover *in the bag* once they went up 12 points! I was a little concerned when Josh Giddey got ruled out before game time, but decided to let it ride anyway. *Thankfully*, I also grabbed the +5.5 line closer to game time after his absence was confirmed (glad that cashed!), but there's *no reason* \+3.5 shouldn't have cashed without him based on the game they played tonight. That missed free throw is going to haunt me ~~forever~~ for a couple of days.

**Shoutout to the Miami Heat & the Cleveland Cavaliers** for cashing my Over play this evening:

**-CLE Cavaliers v MIA Heat Over 247.0 (-110)** ✅ 

Tonight's Player Props (1/4) were wildly uneventful mainly because, well... the Packers and the Eagles did *the bare minimum* 😂 Final game score 10-7! I didn't expect the total to go through the roof, but I didn't expect a Broncos/Raiders game either (IYKYK...). I suppose I'll extend my thanks to Josh Jacobs for turning up:

 **-PHI Eagles v GB Packers: Josh Jacobs Over 69.5 Rushing Yards (-110)** ✅

Not my best night – but tomorrow, we regroup 😌 Just a heads up, I may start sending picks out *a bit* later – as you know, the NBA loves to rule players out obscenely late. If a player is ruled out, I typically post updates in the Discord! That said, **moving forward, if a key lineup change is made for** ***Pick of the Day***\*\*, I'll send out an email as well for those who aren't Discord community regulars\*\*.

 

That's all for now, friends – enjoy the rest of your evening! As always, I'll see you all bright and early to conquer the books.

1ou22ez,https://i.redd.it/kp0iau4llk0g1.jpeg,Please help…Looking for title / author or link for Liam and Piper story.,"While I planned our wedding, the man I was supposed to spend my life with was cheating on me.
The door to Liam's cramped office was half-open, and I could see...
Liam's hand was in Jenna's hair. His other hand, the one that would slip a ring on my finger in five weeks, was cupped against her jaw, tilting her face up to his. 
They were pressed together against his desk, and he was pecking her the way he used to peck me. 
Something inside my chest cracked open.
His mouth moved to her neck. His free hand dropped to her waist, sliding under the hem of her shirt. She arched into him, and he lifted her onto the edge of his desk.
Her legs wrapped around his waist. His hips pressed forward.
It was too much. My fingers went dead, and the container slipped from my hands.
Liam's head whipped toward the doorway. His face went white. Then red.
""How long?"" I asked.
""Since March,"" he said.
""We picked out invitations in March. I ordered your wedding band. We had your parents over for dinner. Your mom showed me her dress."" My hands were shaking.
He ran his hands through his hair. Piper, please, I made a mistake. A huge, terrible mistake, but we can fix this. We can go to counseling, we can—""
""Get. Out.""
——————
The cupcakes were perfect.
I'd woken at five that morning, way before both the alarm and the sun, and pulled butter from the fridge to soften. I creamed it with sugar until my arm ached, folded in Madagascar vanilla bean paste I'd ordered specially, piped each cupcake with the kind of precision I usually reserved for parent-teacher conference notes. Eighteen identical swirls of buttercream, each one a tiny work of art.
The kind of perfection that requires you to ignore certain things. Like how when I'd asked Liam last night if we had enough powdered sugar, he'd said ""mmm-hmm"" without looking up from his phone. Like how he'd been working late more nights than not this month. But that's what you do when you love someone: you bake at five in the morning and tell yourself the distraction means he's tired, not distant.
By the time I'd finished, the sun was up and I was due at school. I packed them carefully in a carrier container, settled them in the passenger seat like precious cargo, and brought them to work with me, storing them safely in the teacher's lounge refrigerator.
Now, three hours after the last bell had rung and the final student had bolted out the door for summer vacation, I was finally driving across town with the kind of giddy anticipation that made me feel ridiculous. I was twenty-seven years old, a second-grade teacher with a master's degree, and I was excited about frosting.
But Liam would understand. He always understood.
That's what I told myself, anyway. It's easier than admitting you've spent years understanding someone who might not be trying to understand you back.
I tried to focus on the good day I'd had: submarine-themed bulletin boards rolled into tubes, construction paper fish recycled, twenty-five end-of-year cards from parents tucked into my bag. Most of them mentioned the wedding. So happy for you, Miss Hayes! and Congratulations on your special day! and one from Dakota's mom that included a gift card to Williams-Sonoma with a note: For your new kitchen!
I'd cried in my empty classroom reading that one.
Summer stretched ahead like a gift. Two months before I had to be back, before I had to remember twenty-five new names and hang new decorations and pretend I had my life together for seven-year-olds who still believed in magic.
And, a few weeks before that, I'd be married.
Station 47 was quiet when I pulled up. Friday afternoon, the trucks gleaming in their bays, everything tidied and hosed down. I grabbed the cupcakes and used the key Liam had given me two years ago, the one that let me slip past the public doors and head upstairs. He'd said I should feel at home here, that the guys loved when I stopped by. I almost never used it. Usually I just texted when I was coming, but today I wanted to surprise him.
The common room was empty, but I could hear voices upstairs.
I climbed the steps carefully, container balanced in both hands. The buttercream had set perfectly during the drive. Liam was going to love these. We'd narrowed the wedding cake down to two flavors, and this vanilla bean was the frontrunner, but I wanted him to taste it one more time before I called the baker we'd hired for the actual cake and⁠—
Voices drifted down from upstairs. Liam's voice, warm and low. Good. He was here.
Then another voice. Female, laughing.
I kept climbing.
Jenna, probably. The new transfer who'd joined the station in December. She was nice. I'd met her at the Christmas party, watched her nurse a single beer all night and ask thoughtful questions about my classroom. She'd seemed nervous, eager to fit in.
Their voices got clearer as I reached the top of the stairs. Liam said something I couldn't make out, and Jenna laughed again, brighter this time.
Then... silence.
I stopped on the landing.
The silence stretched for a heartbeat. It wasn't the comfortable quiet of people working side-by-side, but... something else. Something that made my chest tighten.
There was a rustle of fabric. A sharp intake of breath.
My feet moved before my brain caught up. I moved up the steps, then into the hallway. The door to his cramped office was half-open, and I could see...
I could see...
Liam's hand was in Jenna's hair. His other hand, the one that had held mine just this morning, the one that would slip a ring on my finger in five weeks, was cupped against her jaw, tilting her face up to his. Her hands were fisted in his shirt, the navy station t-shirt I'd folded fresh from the dryer last Sunday. They were pressed together against his desk, and he was pecking her the way he used to peck me. The way he hadn't pecked me in...
God, how long?
How long had it been since he'd pecked me like that? Like he was desperate for it? Like he couldn't breathe without it?
Jenna made a soft, breathy sound, and Liam's fingers tightened in her hair. Something inside my chest cracked open.
His mouth moved to her neck. Her head tilted back, exposing her throat, and his free hand dropped to her waist, sliding under the hem of her shirt. She arched into him, and he lifted her—actually lifted her—onto the edge of his desk. The same desk where we'd eaten Thai food two weeks ago, where I'd sat and told him about the end-of-year field trip while he'd smiled and nodded and said all the right things.
Her legs wrapped around his waist.
His hips pressed forward.
It was too much. My fingers went dead, and the container slipped from my hands.
It hit the floor with a plastic crack that sounded like a gunshot in the quiet hallway. Eighteen perfect cupcakes exploded across the linoleum, buttercream and vanilla bean and hours of work scattered in a mess of plastic and frosting.
They broke apart.
Liam's head whipped toward the doorway. His face went white. Then red. Then something worse: guilty.
""Piper—""
His voice felt like barbed wire someone had tightened around my heart.
I turned and ran.
My feet hit the stairs too fast, and I grabbed the railing to keep from falling. Behind me, Liam was still calling my name.
""Piper, wait! Please, Piper!""
But I couldn't stop. Wouldn't stop.
The common room blurred past. The bay doors were open and the sunlight was too bright, too normal, too much like the world hadn't just split open. My hands shook so hard I dropped my keys twice trying to unlock my car. The metal bit into my palm when I finally got the door open.
""Piper!""
Liam was in the doorway now, shirt untucked, hair disheveled. Looking exactly like what he was.
I threw myself into the driver's seat, slammed the door and locked it. My hands were shaking so badly I could barely get the key in the ignition.
He reached my car and pressed his palms against the window. ""Please. Please just let me explain!""
The engine turned over.
I looked at him then. Really looked at him. At the man I'd been planning to marry in five weeks. The man I'd woken up at five in the morning to bake for.
His mouth was still red from pecking her.
I put the car in reverse and drove away.
I didn't remember the drive home.
One moment I was pulling out of Station 47's parking lot, and the next I was sitting in my car outside our apartment building, engine still running, hands locked on the steering wheel. The sun was still shining. A woman walked past with a stroller. Somewhere nearby, someone was mowing their lawn.
The world was exactly the same as it had been an hour ago. Except it really wasn't.
My phone buzzed in my purse.
Then again. And again.
I turned off the engine and ignored it.
The stairs to our second-floor apartment felt steeper than usual. My legs were shaking. Or, maybe, I was shaking. I couldn't tell anymore. I got my key in the lock on the third try, pushed the door open, and locked the deadbolt behind me.
The little dining table sat under the window, one chair still pulled out. Liam's jacket hung over the back of it, and I stopped in the doorway, staring. Navy blue fleece, worn at the elbows, smelling like smoke and his cologne. He'd thrown it there this morning before leaving for his shift, too distracted to notice it wasn't where it belonged. I'd walked past it a dozen times, barely noticed it.
Now I couldn't look away.
The wedding binder was on the coffee table. Three inches thick, bursting with magazine clippings and fabric swatches and my handwritten notes in the margins.
Ivory vs. cream? Ask about string lights. Liam's cousin is vegetarian, check menu.
Months and months of planning. A year of being engaged.
And I didn't even know how long he'd been lying.
My purse slipped off my shoulder and hit the floor. I walked past the binder, past his jacket, into the kitchen. As if by instinct, I opened the fridge. Our cake-tasting leftovers were still in there. Neat little slices wrapped in cling film, each labeled in my handwriting. Lemon poppyseed. Chocolate hazelnut. Vanilla bean.
Vanilla bean was the frontrunner, the flavor I'd spent the morning perfecting, as if precision could hold everything together. We were supposed to do a final test with the cupcakes, make the choice official. But he'd been so busy lately that I told myself I was being thoughtful, not desperate, when I brought them to him instead.
The cupcakes were probably still scattered across Station 47's linoleum floor. Perfect swirls of buttercream smashed flat, just like everything else I'd thought was solid.
I closed the fridge.
My hands were shaking again. I needed to do something. Needed to move. Needed to...
I pulled open the pantry and started grabbing things. Butter, flour, sugar, baking powder. I didn't know what I was making. Didn't care. I just needed my hands to be busy, needed the routine, needed something that made sense.
Measure. Pour. Mix.
That made sense.
The butter wasn't soft enough but I creamed it anyway, the wooden spoon scraping against the bowl. My phone buzzed on the counter. It was face down, but I could still see the screen lighting up over and over. I ignored it. Cracked eggs one-handed the way I always did, watched the yolks slide into the bowl.
My vision blurred.
I blinked and kept mixing.
The first batch went into the oven. Muffins, I think, or maybe they were supposed to be cupcakes. I didn't remember adding the baking powder. Didn't remember preheating the oven. But the timer was set and the kitchen smelled like vanilla and butter, and for thirty seconds I could almost pretend everything was fine.
Then I saw the engagement photo on the fridge.
Us at the beach last summer, his arm around my waist, both of us laughing at something his brother had said. I'd been so happy that day. We'd stayed until sunset, and he'd pecked me while the waves crashed behind us and told me he couldn't wait to marry me.
I yanked the photo down and shoved it in the junk drawer.
The timer went off and I pulled the muffins out. They were lopsided, too dark on top. Burnt. I stared at them for a long moment, then dumped the entire pan in the trash.
I leaned against the counter, breathing hard.
Jenna.
I'd met her at the Christmas party. Six months ago. She'd seemed nice, really. Quiet, and a little awkward in the way new people are when they're trying to fit in with an established group. She'd asked me about my classroom, complimented the scarf I was wearing. I'd liked her.
Had it started then? At the party, with me standing right there?
Or later. Maybe January. February. March.
How long?
I didn't even know how long.
I tried to remember March. Parent-teacher conferences. The spring musical rehearsals. I'd stayed late three nights a week helping with costumes. Liam had been working overtime, or so he'd said. Double shifts, budget meetings, a training seminar in Sacramento. It made sense, didn't it? He was on track for Station Captain, buried in overtime and leadership courses and whatever else would make him look indispensable.
God, how many of those late-nights had been lies?
I thought of Jenna.
She was younger than me. Twenty-four, maybe twenty-five. Prettier, probably. I'd barely looked at her today, but I remembered her from the party. Long dark hair, athletic build. She was the kind of girl who made ponytails look intentional and sweat look good. She probably didn't stress-bake at two in the morning. Probably didn't have flour permanently embedded under her fingernails.
She was a firefighter. She did what Liam did, understood his world in a way I never could. When he talked about calls and protocols and the weird hierarchy of station life, she got it. She lived it.
I taught second graders how to share crayons.
My hands were shaking again, so I pressed them flat against the counter.
What did she have that I didn't? What had I done wrong? Was I too boring? Too predictable? Too focused on wedding planning and lesson plans and whether the buttercream ratio was right?
Had he been thinking about her when he pecked me goodbye this morning?
Had he been thinking about her every time?
I shoved away from the counter and grabbed the flour again.
Yes, that's what I needed.
More flour. More sugar. More butter.
This time I measured carefully. Like if I could just get the ratios right, everything else would fall into place too.
By the time the second batch went into the oven, my hands were steadier. I started chocolate chip cookies then, the recipe I'd memorized years ago. Cream the butter and sugar. Add the eggs. Stir in the flour and⁠—
Three sharp knocks at the door.
I froze, wooden spoon halfway to the bowl.
""Piper."" Liam's voice was muffled through the door, but I'd know it anywhere. ""Piper, please. I know you're in there.""
The doorknob rattled and, just a few seconds after, his key scraped in the lock.
The door opened an inch and caught on the deadbolt.
""Piper."" Liam's voice was closer now, desperate. ""Please. Just let me in.""
I could see him through the gap. His face was pale, his eyes red-rimmed as if he'd been crying. Or maybe he'd just rubbed his eyes to make it look like he had.
""I need to talk to you,"" he said. ""Please, baby. Just open the door.""
Baby.
He'd called Jenna baby too, probably. Whispered it against her neck while his hands slid under her shirt.
""Piper, please.""
I walked to the door, each step deliberate.
He saw me coming and something like relief flooded his face. ""Thank you. Thank you, I just need five minutes to⁠—""
""How long?"" I asked.
His mouth snapped shut.
""How long, Liam?""
""Can we... can we not do this through the door? Please. Just let me come inside and we can sit down and talk like⁠—""
""How long?""
He closed his eyes. ""Piper⁠—""
""Answer the question or leave.""
There was a long silence. I could hear him breathing. Could hear someone walking down the hallway outside, keys jingling. A door opened and closed somewhere. The building settling around us, as if even it was bracing for what came next.
""Since March,"" he said finally.
March.
The word hung in the air between us, heavy and sharp.
March.
That's when I'd started testing cake flavors. Vanilla bean and lemon and champagne-raspberry. I'd made him try all of them, watched him deliberate like it actually mattered which one we chose. He'd pulled me into his lap and pecked buttercream off my lips and said he didn't care about the cake, he just wanted to marry me.
That was March.
""Say something,"" Liam said. ""Please.""
""We picked out invitations in March.""
""I know⁠—""
""I ordered your wedding band. We had your parents over for dinner. Your mom showed me her dress.""
""Piper—""
""You texted me during parent-teacher conferences."" My voice was steady. ""You sent me a photo of a Sacramento sunset, then said you wished I was there to see it.""
He didn't say anything.
""Was she there?"" I asked. ""When you took that photo?""
Silence.
""Was she there, Liam?""
""Yes."" His voice was barely a whisper.
Something cracked inside my chest. Not my heart... no, that had already broken. It was something else. Something that had been holding me together.
I unlocked the deadbolt.
The door swung open and Liam stumbled forward, catching himself on the doorframe. ""Thank you,"" he breathed. ""Thank you, I just need to explain⁠—""
""Get out.""
He froze. ""What?""
""Get your sh-it,"" I said, ""and get out.""
""Piper, no, just listen to me for one second⁠—""
""I don't want to listen."" My hands were shaking again, so I pressed them against my thighs. ""I don't want to hear about how it was a mistake or how you're sorry or how it didn't mean anything. I want you to pack your things and leave.""
""It didn't mean anything,"" he said anyway. ""I swear to God, Piper, she doesn't... you're the one I love. You're the one I want to marry.""
""You don't get to say that to me."" My voice cracked. ""You don't get to stand here and tell me you love me when you've been fu-cking someone else for months.""
""I wasn't... we... we didn't⁠—""
""Don't."" I held up a hand. ""Don't you dare try to tell me what I saw.""
""Okay."" He ran his hands through his dark blond hair, the same gesture he always made when he was stressed. ""Okay. You're right. I'm not going to lie to you anymore. But Piper, please, I made a mistake. A huge, terrible mistake, but we can fix this. We can go to counseling, we can⁠—""
""Get. Out.""
""This is my home too."" His voice shifted. Harder now. ""I'm on the lease, Piper. You can't just kick me out.""
I stared at him.
He was pulling the lease card. Actually standing here, reeking of guilt and another woman's perfume, and pulling the lease card.
""You want to stay here?"" I asked.
""I want us to work this out.""
""You want to stay in this apartment?""
""That's not what I⁠—""
""Fine,"" I said.
""Fine what?""
I turned and walked toward the bedroom. ""Keep it.""
""Piper, what are you⁠—""
I grabbed my duffel bag from the closet and started throwing things into it. Underwear. Bras. T-shirts. My hands were shaking so badly I kept dropping things.
""What are you doing?"" Liam appeared in the doorway. ""Piper, stop.""
I shoved past him to the dresser. Grabbed jeans, leggings, a sweater. I didn't even bother folding any of it, just stuffed it all into the bag.
""You can't just leave,"" he said. ""We need to talk about this.""
""Move.""
""No."" He planted himself in front of the closet. ""Not until you calm down and listen to me.""
""Calm down?"" I looked at him, the man I'd been planning to spend my life with. ""You want me to calm down.""
""This isn't... God, Piper, you're not thinking clearly.""
""I'm thinking very clearly."" I zipped the duffel bag. ""You cheated on me. While I planned our wedding. While I baked you cakes and folded your laundry and told my second-graders about how I was getting married to the best man in the world.""
His face crumpled. ""Piper⁠—""
""You want the apartment?"" I slung the bag over my shoulder. ""It's yours. Enjoy it.""
""Where are you going?""
""Anywhere that isn't here.""
""This is insane,"" he said. ""You're being insane.""
I pushed past him. He grabbed my arm and I jerked away so hard I stumbled.
""Don't touch me.""
""Piper, please⁠—""
I walked to the kitchen, grabbed my purse and my phone and my laptop. The duffel bag was cutting into my shoulder but I didn't care. I just needed to get out and breathe air that didn't smell like him.
Liam followed me to the door. ""You can't just walk away from this. From us. What about the wedding?""
I stopped and turned around.
""What about it?"" I asked.
""We have two hundred people coming. We have deposits. We have⁠—""
""Cancel it.""
""Piper—""
""Or don't. I don't care. Marry Jenna if you want. I'm done.""

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

You know those people who say pregnancy is “the most magical time of your life”?  
Yeah... they probably forgot the part where your feet swell like loaves of bread, you cry because you dropped a spoon, and sleep becomes a distant fantasy.  

But here’s the truth: staying healthy, sane, and *actually happy* during pregnancy is possible — you just need the right mindset, a sense of humor, and a few tried-and-true hacks that *actually work.*  

---

### Here’s what the “Fit To Be Pregnant” mindset looks like:
• **Fitness = Function, Not Flawless.**  
Forget chasing the pre-bump body. The goal is strength, stamina, and sanity — not six-pack abs over a baby. Think gentle workouts, nourishing movement, stretching for comfort... not perfection.  
Find your rhythm here 👉 [https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b)  

• **Fuel Your Bump, But Also Your Mood.**  
Pregnancy cravings are real — but so is nutritional burnout. Choose foods that boost energy, balance hormones, and fuel tiny human growth *without losing your mind* over macros. (Because nobody wants to fight with kale.)  

• **Mindset Maintenance Matters.**  
Your changing body is proof you’re doing something incredible. Be kinder to yourself. Ditch toxic advice. Say “no thank you” to strangers who think they have a PhD in your uterus.  

---

### The real MVPs of survival:  
- **Sleep like it’s your side hustle.** Nap, snooze, and curl up whenever you can.  
- **Hydrate like it’s a competition.** You’ll thank yourself — your skin, mood, and baby will too.  
- **Laugh daily.** Stress burns calories, but laughter protects your soul (and your sanity).  
- **Invest in small comforts.** Belly bands, body pillows, soothing teas — they’re not indulgences, they’re tools for survival.  

Get the full breakdown in the free guide here 👉 [https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b)  
Trust me — this is the wellness roadmap you wish someone handed you at the first positive test.  

---

### Because being #FitToBePregnant isn’t about perfection...
It’s about strength — mental, emotional, and physical — when your body is doing the ultimate work.  
It’s about balance when the world tells you to do more, eat less, and “just glow.”  
It’s also about knowing about digital tools and guides like this that genuinely make a difference in your journey.

1ou1pe3,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ou1pe3/i_feel_bad_for_having_fictional_dads/,"I feel bad for having ""fictional dads""","TW - Bit of a trauma dump here

My dad was never bad, mean, or abusive. He never even spanked me because he couldn't bear the thought of laying hands on his child. And he constantly texts me, sees how I'm doing, he's asking me to spend Christmas with him, and he gets depressed when I have to go back home.

But he's also been pretty absent, even though I don't hold it against him, and even though he never wanted to be.

When we still lived in the same state, I visited him every other weekend, but he spent a lot of his time on the porch smoking or in his room smoking. If I wanted to hang out with him, I'd have to sit in his smoke filled room with him and watch Ancient Aliens, but as a kid I got bored of that quickly and the smoke made me nauseous. 

He's also an alcoholic, but again, he's never been violent and never hit anyone. He's gotten into verbal fights with his brothers in the past, and once into a yelling match with my stepmom before, that resulted in him sleeping on the couch and breaking the leg off the coffee table in frustration, but he's never hurt anyone. 

I also think he has some kind of paranoia that needs professional support because he has occasionally asked me to send selfies when he texted me so he could ""be sure he was actually talking to me,"" and not someone else, even though is was my number.

But after I hit 13, he moved out of state and I only saw him maybe once every two years, around holidays. I'm 22 now, so that's not a lot time with my father.

Even recently when I stayed with him last year, most of his time was spent smoking on the porch and watching conspiracies on YouTube, or in the laundry room smoking and watching YouTube. We couldn't even watch a whole movie before he left to go smoke. 

He did have a heart attack scare though, and he drastically reduced his smoking from several packs a day to a couple a week so I'm pretty proud of him for that. 

But to the main part of the post

Due to how absent he was, I think I started latching onto fictional characters and seeing them as father figures. I have a whole list of fictional fathers, there's at least one or two from every fandom.

Thorin Oakenshield, Bobby Singer, Yondu Udonta, almost every superhero from Marvel or DC for some reason, you get it.

I'll watch a movie, an older male character will come on screen, and my brain goes, ""Oh, that's my dad, add him to the *✨️Dad Collection✨️""*

But I feel bad about it because I HAVE a father figure. My own bio dad always tried his best and he loves me, he just lives in the south. And my stepdad is a very kind man who stepped up and treated me like his own from day 1. For the last 10 years, this man has acted like a father to me and always given it his all.

And I feel bad that my brain completely ignores both of their efforts and instead connects to some random fictional man who more than likley has broken at least fifty laws and ""adopted"" the main character.

My stepdad is the type of man to give you the shirt off his back if he knows it'll make your life easier. We connect and bond over a lot of things, especially nerd stuff like Marvel and Comic-Con. Yet still, sometimes, I dread being alone with him.

He has *NEVER* given me a reason to be genuinely uncomfortable around him, but if we're the only two home, I stay in my room.

I know it's not a ""You're not my real dad,"" stance, because I'm a grown adult and I've known him for 10 years. I just don't like being home alone with him.  

But despite him being a very loving and kind man who treats me well, and despite my father genuinely trying his best for me, I still just stay in my room and think about my fictional dads.

Sometimes I'll turn on Doctor Who just so I can feel that connection with the Doctor. 

Sometimes I watch Supernatural so I can connect with Dean, even though I'm about the same age as Sam in the earlier seasons.

Garmadon from Ninjago, Splinter from the 2012 TMNT, Bruce Wayne, Loki, Aziraphale, etc.

Maybe I like that they're always there, since my bio dad kinda just left when I was 13? 

But still, I feel bad, because I have two father figures who are both genuinely trying their best to connect with me and do whatever they can for me, and instead I form these bonds with people who aren't even real.",1,1762840503.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1ou1p1v,https://i.redd.it/4zkru4u9hk0g1.jpeg,The Future Is Spoken: Why Voice Search Matters Now,"Not too long ago, search began with a keyboard. Today, it starts with a voice.

“Hey Siri,” “Okay Google,” “Alexa…” — these phrases now open more doors than any typed keyword ever could.

Voice search isn’t a trend; it’s a shift in behavior. Especially among younger users, speaking is simply faster, easier, and more natural. It’s not about convenience anymore — it’s about expectation.

For brands, this changes everything.

Traditional SEO focuses on short, typed phrases like “best coffee shop near me.” Voice search turns that into a full sentence: “Where can I get a good cup of coffee nearby?”

That difference matters. Because now, optimization isn’t about cramming keywords — it’s about understanding intent and conversation.

To stay discoverable, brands must adapt their digital presence for natural language. This means:

Writing in a conversational tone

Answering specific, question-based queries

Structuring content for featured snippets

Focusing on local optimization — since most voice searches are location-based

But beyond the technical, there’s something deeper: tone.

In a world where your brand can literally “speak,” how it sounds — warm or robotic, confident or confusing — defines how people connect with it.

The future of search isn’t typed. It’s spoken.

And the brands that are heard will be the ones that listen first.",1,1762840471.0,u_External-Bobcat9649,0,1.0,False

I, 23f, grew up in a stressful environment. I think that I tend to like to be stressed. I have a dependency on coffee and I’ve realized while yes it boosts my mood it also makes me terribly anxious and stressed out. It’s effecting me physically. My eye bags are more prominent, sleep sucks, and hair looks like it’s dry and breaking off. When I tried quitting caffeine I did it for 3 weeks and I felt much healthier and SO much calmer. But, feeling that calm made me uneasy. It felt like I was restless for chaos and dopamine. When I drink coffee I’m tweaked out, sweating profusely, heart beating out of my chest, can kind of function, and I’m happy. When I’m not drinking coffee I’m very sad and emotional, can barely function. I know when I quit eventually the withdrawals will subside and my mood will stabilize. It just sucks. I like having coffee as a routine source of comfort. But obviously my body is rejecting it (no matter how much of it I drink). It’s tough too because coffee is everywhere. At my college there is a coffee shop like every 50 ft. I know this little dependency thing is rooted in my deep sadness. I know quitting will be best for me because I’ve done it before and I felt a lot better but I just hate not having a source of comfort!!! I know caffeine is tame or whatever but I seriously need a fucking drug or something man like life sucks sometimes and coffee makes it a little bit more bearable! I know I can find comfort in hobbies or what the hell ever. ugh I’m just complaining sorry. Anyways how do you cope with facing raw reality?? I’m addicted to other things like my phone, validation, buying things, etc etc like how do I just accept that life is what it is without those things??  How do I move through life accepting the unknown and complexities of the universe while I’m sitting at a fucking computer for hours making 16.50 an hour, studying at a college that I don’t really know what the hell I’m doing, while racking up loans that I might just join the military after I graduate to get rid of them, including that I feel so disconnected from people, friends, family, and what I’m doing this all for?

We don’t have any issues together for the most part and have lived together for a few years. However he is stoned often, he has eaten my food often but that’s a separate issue I’ve let go because he’s been nice when my rent has been late or when I was unemployed for a few months

However, what really bothers me is he has opened my Amazon packages on several different occasions. We both frequently order things from Amazon. I don’t think it’s intentional. I think he’s either stoned and assumes it’s his, or maybe he could have vision issues with reading? 

I’ve never gotten angry about it and he’s apologized before, he’s brought it up on his own and said “hey dude I opened your package sorry about that” but this time I ordered a sex toy and it was really intimate and embarrassing. I didn’t get to the package before he did, and when I came home it was ripped open on the coffee table.

I feel humiliated.

The idea came from a random night when I was playing a “name date ideas” game with my friends, and some surprisingly weird ideas popped up. I thought it would be fun to share them with others. As a dev, I spend all day staring at code, and my date ideas somehow never go beyond coffee or a movie.



My hope is that this gives fellow devs a few fun ways to mix things up with their partners, and maybe inspires others to try building something small and playful too.

1ou1k17,https://www.reddit.com/r/nairobi/comments/1ou1k17/how_to_bag_a_woman/,How to bag a woman,"I want to share what I have learnt in my journey. Maybe you may learn from it and be better.

First thing first  sex precedes commitment. I want you to look at it this way: let’s take an example. You’re a man, you see an attractive woman. Ninety-nine percent of the time, you will have to approach her. Remember, all men pay but how much depends on if she likes you. If she does, you get a 70 percent discount.

You have to be genuine and show interest. Here is where some of you get it wrong  you rush to text her. Wait. Don’t you have anything to do with your life? Chill. Imagine a stranger you met two or three days ago spamming you bro, chill. I get it, you want her, but chill. Take your time.

Here is where you most likely put yourself in a precarious position  chasing them. Chasing a woman is an aggressive move, and it puts you at a disadvantage. You do these majestic things trying to get her attention. You will do that, then one day you will have nothing. You overplayed.

Do the bare minimum. I’m telling you from the other side do the bare minimum. If you bag her The only thing remaining will be a divorce. The last majestic thing a divorce. And you will be here crying, “I did everything and still nothing.”

You have to have money. Take her on a date, and don’t be cheap nor expensive trying to impress her. Vibe. Create a vibe and give her the look. Look her in the eyes. Don’t be too touchy  just look at her, create the sexual tension.

If you ask a woman to plan a date with a guy she’s meeting for the first time, she will plan something silly  a coffee date. Women want resources, i.e. money and attention, for as little sex as possible. Men want sex for as little money as possible.

The moment you sleep with her, the dynamic shifts. I want you to think of it like this a relationship is the medium in which value is transacted. Why would I forsake the bros in my phone who give me money and attention for one guy, unless he is my best option? Unless I see value in being with him?

The moment you sleep with her, everything changes. Just pull back a little bit  not much, a little bit. Women want to invest in a relationship, but men don’t give them a chance. The more expensive a relationship is to one party, that party tends to stay. You have to make it expensive for her.

How? Let her invest. Usianze mambo ya 50/50 hapa — utakaa na mama yako, nigga. And remember, make her feel. The moment she starts thinking, it’s the end.",10,1762839990.0,nairobi,15,0.78,False

However, what really bothers me is he has opened my Amazon packages on several different occasions. I don’t think it’s intentional. I think he’s either stoned and assumes it’s his, or maybe he could have vision issues with reading?

I’ve never gotten angry about it and he’s apologized before, but this time I ordered a sex toy and it was really intimate and embarrassing. I didn’t get to the package before he did, and when I came home it was ripped open on the coffee table.

I feel humiliated.

1ou1gew,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ou1gew/aita_for_blocking_my_work_husband_after_our/,"AITA for blocking my ""work husband"" after our summer job ended?","

Hi so I used all fake names in this… So I (21F) worked at this community arts center over the summer through Canada Summer Jobs, and me and my coworker Jake (21M) did literally everything together. Like, we'd work on the same projects, grab lunch together, take our breaks at the same time, and honestly I was with him almost the entire time I was in the office. We got along really well, same sense of humor, same work style, it was easy.

So our other coworkers, who are all like 35-50, started making jokes about it. They'd be like ""oh where's your work husband?"" or ""where's your little man?"" and it was all super lighthearted and fun, and honestly? Me and Jake played into it. Like I'd say ""oh he's busy right now"" or Jake would bring me coffee and be like ""gotta keep the work wife happy"" and everyone would laugh. It wasn't an issue at all, it was just like, workplace banter, and we both thought it was funny.

The contract ended in August and we went our separate ways. But then Jake kept texting me, like a lot. Which was fine at first because we'd been friendly, but the thing is, outside of work, we were never really friends? Like we never hung out outside the office during the summer, we didn't have mutual friends, we just worked well together. So it felt kind of forced.

Then like two weeks after the job ended, he asked to meet up for coffee and he kind of crashed out on me. He said something like ""I think you should know that you shouldn't let what people say about our relationship go to your head, like the work husband stuff, that was just jokes. But we can still be friends, just not in a weird context."" And I was like okay? Sure? That's fine? I honestly wasn't even thinking about the work husband thing anymore but whatever.

But then every time we hung out after that, he was being SO nice. Like, overly nice. Complimenting me constantly, like ""you look really good today"" or ""I always thought you were really smart"" or ""you have such a good energy,"" and it was just... a lot? Like after working with him for four months, I know how he normally acts, and this wasn't it.

And then it got worse. He'd text me like ""what are you up to?"" multiple times a day. If I said I was going to the gym, he'd be like ""oh I'll come with you, which gym?"" and I'd have to make up excuses for why he couldn't come. One time I was studying at the campus library and he showed up with some friends, saw me, and then ditched his friends to sit with me for like two hours even though I had headphones in and was clearly trying to work. He'd ask me about my schedule, like what days I was working at my new job, what time I got off, if I had plans on the weekend.

It all kind of came to a head on Halloween. Me, him, and a group of friends all went to the club, and everyone had been drinking and dancing, and he was being very touchy with me. Like clearly trying to dance with me, pulling me close, and like, usually I have no problem dancing with my male friends at all, but coming from him it definitely felt charged? Like there was intention behind it. I kept trying to move away or dance with other people in the group but he kept coming back and trying to dance with me specifically.

After that night, it just felt like too much and I needed peace of mind, so I blocked him on everything. Instagram, Snapchat, his number, all of it.

Now Sarah (26F), another coworker from the summer job who I'm still friends with, is telling me I was way too harsh. She keeps saying Jake's been ""going through it"" and that I ""made things weird by shutting him out completely."" Like apparently he asked her if I was mad at him or if he did something wrong, and she thinks I should've just talked to him like an adult. She's like ""you guys were literally attached at the hip all summer and now you won't even text him back? That's kind of messed up"" and ""I don't get why you couldn't just be honest with him, now he's confused and feels like shit.""

But like, the constant texting felt like too much, and the Halloween thing made me uncomfortable. And honestly I don't owe him an explanation, we were just coworkers, and I feel like if I had tried to ""let him down gently"" he would've just tried to convince me otherwise or made it into a whole thing.

Sarah says I'm being dramatic and that he was probably just trying to maintain the friendship we had at work, and that I ""read into things."" But I know what I felt and I know it was weird.

## ## How to Choose a Good Christmas Gift: The Golden Rules

Before we dive into the lists, let's cover the basics. A good gift isn't always the most expensive one. It’s about showing you listen and care.

*   **Listen for Hints:** People often drop clues months in advance. ""My old coffee maker is so slow,"" or ""I'd love to learn how to make pasta."" Keep a note in your phone!
*   **Consider Their Hobbies & Passions:** What do they do in their free time? A new set of paints for the artist, a high-tech gadget for the gamer, or a cozy blanket for the reader.
*   **Upgrade Their Everyday:** What do they use daily that could be better? A flimsy spatula, basic headphones, or an old wallet. Upgrading the mundane is a power move.
*   **When in Doubt, Go Experiential:** Memories last longer than things. A cooking class, concert tickets, or a weekend getaway can be the best gift of all.

(Posting here because Hinge/bumble Reddit’s I need karma to post).

I’m 34f, earning 6 figure salary in the mid 2’s. In order to get there I consciously made a decision to not date as I was focusing on my studies etc. I am now taking dating apps seriously starting a few months ago. Since then I’ve chatted with many but I’ve been on around 4 dates, and immediately cut people off based off of them not meeting “what I am looking for”.

For example: 1 date- guy was 10 minutes late besides living next to the coffee shop ( 5 minute walk to him, while I drove 45 minutes for the date, he doesn’t have a car) 

2 date: told me he was unemployed which wasn’t mentioned on the chat and within the first 45 minute started touching my thigh (I’d like to get to know someone better before getting physical)

3rd date: was great really, I was attracted to him, he seemed intentional, similar values, in the end of the date I asked him his political views (listed as moderate on dating app) and it was not something I could relate with so that was the end of it

4th date : we were chatting for weeks because I was busy and couldn’t meet him, we have a video call before meeting up and he tells me he has two kids and divorced (why couldn’t he mention it to me when we were chatting for 1.5 weeks?)he had not listed his political affiliation as well and turns out it was not aligned with mine.

So now I take everyone’s profiles quite literally as it is without adding extra information from my head. I swipe no on many profiles if they have not mentioned if they have kids or not (why don’t you mention that?), no political affiliations (I use it as a gauge on where your empathy and kindness lies), not mentioning what they are looking for in a relationship (long term vs short term), people showing too much body, not mentioning their job, and I always swipe no on people who smoke cigarettes and also do weed even if socially (cannot stand the smell of it, and prefers someone who doesn’t do it at all).

The dating pool feels so small for me as many profiles are incomplete or has one of the above which is an automatic swipe no for me. I don’t want to waste my time chatting for a few days with someone to end up finding out that they are in fact divorced with kids etc. (not a bad thing, but prefer someone without divorced partners).

My question is, am I being too harsh? Am I missing out on the chance of not meeting the one based off on just incomplete profiles?",1,1762839126.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

Tonight I trace the signal again—down a light pole, across a box that isn’t on any city diagram, to a wagon with rental plates and a pelican case full of contracts. The operator’s laminate says “press,” the invoice says “security,” the retainer says “legal.” He’s selling vantage points—roof angles, door shots, badge arrivals—to whoever pays. JD Delay floats past mid-monologue, rain on his cap, narrating a scene the lens keeps altering by existing. The man I’m sitting on is the one who turns a protest into a menu.

“Client?” I ask, rolling his SSD into my glove.

He starts to say “media,” drifts toward “counsel,” settles on a swallow. He’s smart enough to hear what this looks like to a prosecutor who still trusts the bones of the law.

Up the hill, the bigger numbers don’t hug comfort. The one-night census says more people outside than anyone wanted to read—twelve thousand across the region, Multnomah carrying most of it. Some of that is better counting. Some of it is gravity. Meanwhile, killings sagged in the charts, a hard dip after years of bad slope. Same block, both truths: fewer gunshots, more tents under the viaduct. That friction hums even when the streets are empty.

The case lands the way real ones do—sideways. A shelter van with CITY PARTNER decals cruises Old Town, hazards blinking, three stops in five minutes. It swings by Transition Projects’ Resource Center, idles at Central City Concern’s Blackburn Center near 122nd and Burnside, cuts north past Hooper on Williams like it knows every doorway worth a clipboard. The outreach crew on the corner doesn’t know the driver. The plates trace to a pass-through staffing vendor buried in the city’s Street Services Coordination Center contracting tree. Not CCC. Not TPI. The kind that invoices for transport and “data hygiene.” The kind that lives in the seams.

I ride the van to a garage where the concrete sweats. Inside: cots and clipboards, then an office with a wall of whiteboards—arrows, dates, initials, a column labeled SERVICE CONTACTS (their shorthand for every countable interaction they can bill or claim as a “touch”). The math is simple: a person in a bed counts. The same person in the same bed counts again tomorrow. Nudge them back to the sidewalk by lunch and you can “place” them again by dusk. It’s a harvest of statistics—turning human drift into repeatable wins, invoices stapled to outcomes no one keeps long enough to verify.

A supervisor in a slicker looks up and tries on a grin that belongs on another face. “You can’t be here,” he says.

“You can’t be here,” I answer, and we both know which version is true.

He swings first. He hits a filing cabinet and learns something about leverage. I put him on his own whiteboard long enough to read the corners on his phone: subcontract numbers, SSCC work orders, a route log that pings Bybee Lakes as punctuation on otherwise circular nights. The dog-eared page says stabilization intake; the loop says otherwise.

I call it in—HTU detective with steady hands, a deputy city attorney who hates surprises less than being lied to, and the DA. Vasquez answers on the first ring. He listens like a man measuring twice. There’s a glint there that reminds me of Harvey before the coin; I don’t say the name. Portland doesn’t need my ghosts.

“Keep them there,” he says. “We’ll meet you with paper.”

“Bring enough,” I tell him, looking at the wall where SERVICE CONTACTS outnumber beds.

While I wait, I circle the room. In one corner a woman teaches her mutt to sit using half a granola bar. In another, a kid in a damp hoodie counts the holes in the acoustic tile. Everyone here is being moved like furniture. Lents to Cully. St. Johns to Springwater. Inside. Outside. Counted. Counted again.

Sirens growl up 2nd Avenue. The detective arrives with uniforms who remember how to be gentle. The DA’s team follows with warrants that smell like ink. We pull records; we find loops. The pass-through vendor bounced folks between overflow cots and “day services,” clocking a “service provided” every time the door opened. Nobody kept the bed. The city kept the numbers. The vendor kept the money. Nobody lied outright. That’s the trick.

On my way out, I hand the SSD from the protest vendor to the detective. “Same disease,” I say. “Different organ.”

He raises an eyebrow. He knows better than to ask for the rest.

I cross the river at midnight. The wind skates off the water and slaps the face you wore into the day. A late MAX clatters by with fogged windows and tired eyes. Somewhere, a family who hasn’t slept indoors in a week will get a cot that lasts past sunrise. Somewhere else, a spreadsheet loses a column called SERVICE CONTACTS. That won’t cure a city. It will stop a quiet theft of truth.

Bullock would tell me to pick easier fights. He’s back in Gotham pretending the coffee’s still good. Vasquez texts a single word from the garage: Seized. I can picture the chain of custody tags, the whiteboard scrubbed down to gray.

Across the freeway, tents glisten under the ribs of the overpass. The ban is back; the weather doesn’t care. The court order kept soldiers off a city block; the city still has to keep its own hands clean. I can’t promise Portland a rescue. I can insist on an audit—night after night—until the numbers add up to people again.",0,1762839100.0,PortlandOR,0,0.14,False

We’ve had many conversations and talks she’s so real and she’ll be even more real when I find her autumn forest with her astonishing physical and beautiful body. When I first saw her (first image) on a discord PFP I got love tingles and a sense of attraction I’ve never had in my life and it’s amazing how much we’ve grown even tho I got really sad and mad when she was a man my stories and dreams are rising and I already knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

1ou15xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1ou15xs/tw_janes_dystopia/,[TW] Jane’s dystopia,"“Identification?”

The wristband commissioned by our government sits on my wrist, locked in place for eternity. My entire life, passport, resume, license, blood test results, contained all within. A quick tap and im allowed through a series of security screening systems that will detect if I have hidden any contraband on or within my person. If I were pregnant or had a tumor, even early stages, this machine may find out before I do.  

After this, I am allowed within the building. There is nobody around as I complete these checkpoints as the ceo thought it better to stagger staff entry into the building. An employee who is distracted by their colleagues may not perform their duties as effectively. I am then brought to my cubicle, where I work as an artificial intelligence engineer.
Before, I worked as an artist,much to my mothers distaste, spending my days in my sunroom painting beautiful landscapes but now it is impossible to live off of an artists income, especially when AI is able to print anything she may craft, in a fraction of the time. Healthcare alone was a struggle for most, and with governmental assistance cut off it was hard to get back on your feet.The world is constantly changing, and those who did not conform died of starvation or illness. Some took to the streets, living in tents and boxes but with the new big beautiful ordinance, they all disappeared. 

When Synhaima came out with an entry level job listing that included paid training, full benefits and free housing, it was hard to say no. When Jane received the offer she tried to hold onto her morals, to do something she felt had meaning but the cabinets were empty and had been for a while. Only out of pure desperation she, along with everyone else who hadn’t joined this gilded era of technology, signed over her autonomy. Teachers, artists, musicians all replaced by AI. Even small business owners suffered, as the gaijin (the outsiders) were seen as a status.They never have a bad day at work, or call out for a last minute emergency. There’s no need to offer benefits to a machine, they don’t have dental or vision. They simply work. They do as they are programmed and shut down at the end of the day.
 
In this way, it is almost envious. Jane remembers her regulars, the nice man at her gas station, Javi or her barista Britney, and her mail lady, Rebecca. Jane thinks about them often, even though they probably do not think of her. Where did they end up? Now all the cars are electric, coffees are premade and shipped bulk, and snail mail became a thing of the past with Amazon converting to using drones. 

Now at my desk I begrudgingly supporting their cause, filing error codes and claims. No actual engineering,just meaningless work until im allowed to leave, not to my own home as a real house is a luxury not meant for the common folk, but to a temporary rental the company provides. 
I reach into my desk for my migraine medication, as the fluorescent lights are already triggering an episode. When she asked her supervisor for permission to bring in her own lighting, it was shutdown for fear of other employees thinking she got special treatment. She’s also not allowed to carry a water bottle for fear it may spill on the technology, so she’s forced to dry swallow her medicine. It sits in her chest uncomfortably, but she knows it’s only a matter of time until it dissolves. 

By noon, the food trolley rolls its way to her door, and it’s time for her (company provided) lunch. Today is Wednesday so she already knows it’s sandwich day. Looking down into the brown sack, she is correct. One soggy turkey sandwich, an apple that is well past its prime, and a plastic water bottle. 

“Thank-“ I stop myself before finishing. The robot doesn’t care if she’s grateful, it’s not even aware if she’s there. It waits exactly two minutes before moving to the next cubical. I sigh, ripping the plastic off of my sandwich. When recruited for the job, they promised full meals everyday but that went away after the government announced the rations due to our ongoing war with Russia. 
“YOU CANT KEEP DOING THIS!!” A women’s voice shakes me back to reality. When was the last time she heard somebody talk, let alone scream within the office? Curiosity killed the cat, but I can’t help but peak around my door to see what’s going on. 

A petite woman with pin straight black hair is red faced, in obvious distress,”WE ARE HUMAN, NOT MACHINE!!”
To the side, she spots the floor manager, already calling for backup. 
“Ma’am im sorry but in today’s climate we must make cutbacks..” he says quietly, as if he knows what he is doing is wrong. 
“WE SIGNED A CONTRACT. IM OBLIGATED TO SEVERANCE”
“Ma’am it says it in section B, we are allowed-“
“YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY LAWYER”
The security finally finds their way, immediately detaining the woman using brute force and her screams slowly fade as they take her away. 
I cautiously glance at the floor manager, who shakes his head and goes back into his own cubicle before turning around myself and going back to my sad, sad sandwich. 

By the end of the day I have taken double my dosage of migraine medicine, accomplished absolutely nothing of real value, and have nothing to look forward to if not the comfort of my bed whenever I get home. 7:20 pm. One more year and I get to leave 20 minutes earlier, as those who have worked for the company longer get priority when they stagger the exits. On my way out I once again go through the security and tap my bracelet. Once outside the building I see an ambulance, and pools of blood at the bottom of the concrete steps. There’s nobody walking on the streets, some cars whiz by but they aren’t seeing what I am, they are focused on getting home. I cautiously step around the blood, eyeing the stretcher to try to understand what happened. All I can see is her black hair, the same hair from earlier and a bracelet, stained pink from all of the blood lying on the ground. She must’ve ripped it out, I move slowly knowing until I am inside of my house I am being watched by cameras. I pretend to drop something from my bag, the medics are crowded around the woman, forcibly bringing her back to this life. Jane assumes the woman wants to die, as everyone knows you don’t last long once you pull the bracelet off. They are never meant to come off, but I have heard of people going insane and ripping them out before. It’s not covered on the news, as it’s not good for morale. Just whispers on private forums online. 

“Do you need something?” One of the medics bark at me, bringing me yet again out of my thoughts. 
“No…”
I go home. There’s nothing I could do to help, but the passion in the woman’s voice rings throughout my head while my car drives me home. 
Another tap. Another traceable movement for the government to watch. Another submission to the system. The rental im allowed to stay in couldn’t be more different from my old house, the walls are all painting a light grey, there’s not very many windows but Atleast here I can avoid the fluorescent lights found everywhere else. I miss cooking, but now everything affordable is precooked and boxed up so I open the next meal (chicken rice and broccoli) and shove it in the microwave. Did she get fired? What did he say about cutbacks? Could I be next?

Beep. Beep. Beep. 

I force the food down, as it’s almost always under seasoned due to health concerns and salt is for people who can afford a good healthcare plan. My mother used to make the most delicious meals, although she never let me have a second serving for fear I’d gain weight. I take a shower and another pill to help me sleep before I can start my routine again. 

“YOU CANT KEEP DOING THIS”
The woman?it takes a moment for my eyes to adjust before I realize she’s looking at me. 
“I AM A HUMAN BEING, LOOK AT ME” she’s screaming, moving closer and getting in my face. Adrenaline pumps in my veins, a feeling so foreign to my small life. I open my mouth to ask what’s going on, but my voice takes on another conversation,”security..” I say with an eerie calmness.
“NO, NO THEYLL KILL ME” she’s screaming, I can hear her vocal cords tearing. It doesn’t sound human, it sounds primal. Goosebumps form on my arms as she’s carried away. Suddenly a crimson wave floods around my feet, her blood. It’s all over. It’s in the carpet, I can feel the wetness seeping through my shoes as I wiggle my toes but cannot seem to take a step. The room is filling, her blood no doubt staining my socks, but all I can focus on is the rotting apple on top of my desk. 

I wake up in a cold sweat, shivering within my damp sheets. It was just a dream. I practice what chat GPT tells me, breathe in…1..2..3..4, and after a good ten minutes im back into routine. 
Brush teeth, eat pre packed egg bites, don’t think about the taste,think about the protein, get dressed, grab premade coffee, get to work-

“STOP, NO!”

Her voice interrupts me yet again. I look around, did she live? No. This is my imagination. There’s a stain on the stairs leading up to the building, a small piece left behind soon to be removed as a power washer is hums to life. After my shift is done, it will all be gone. As if she never existed. I look down at my bracelet, and tug slightly. It pulls on my veins, threatening me, daring me to pull harder. I don’t. I go to work, but I don’t get anything done. When lunch is dropped off (a cup ramen and more water) I ignore it until the trolley moves on.

I figured this would be my best place to get unfiltered, unbiased advice, if not i'll quietly leave and i would completely understand. my dad was trying to help me, but he's quite literally a farmer who only goes to starbucks for his two teenage daughters... i really just want to know what to expect and prepare for, for the interview and for the job itself if i do get hired. i also have no clue how to dress for the interview. my cousin works at the location i applied for, so that might give me a bit of leverage, but i barely speak to her as she's my second cousin and a grown woman  with a whole ass family. i talked to her for advice over text but im still so anxious about this whole thing. this would be my first job where im not able to lean on friends or my mom while trying to build relationships with my coworkers, or when i have questions. any advice, even blunt or ""rude"", would be greatly appreciated!!

1ou143t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ou143t/please_tell_me_im_not_crazy/,Please tell me I’m not crazy..,"Hello everyone! I’ve been debating posting this on here for a while because of how uneasy this situation has left me.

Earlier this year, sometime in July, my grandfather passed away in my family’s home. He was on hospice care due to the rapid decline in his health, and before that he had been in the hospital for a while. About a month after he passed away, my aunt, who had Down syndrome, also passed away. She had been in and out of the hospital and the nursing home until they finally decided she wasn’t getting better and that hospice care would be the best option for her. Sadly, the same day she was put into the hospice facility, she passed away.

When my grandfather was still alive, he loved to sit outside by our front door in his walker and look at the big tree we have out front. One day my mom even got two rocking chairs, one for him and one for her, that way they could be out there together. He loved sitting out there with her, drinking his morning coffee, and just taking everything in.

As you can probably piece together, about a month or so after both he and my aunt passed away, I was up late one night around 1:40 a.m. I was on my phone in the living room when I suddenly noticed something moving out of the corner of my eye. When I looked up, it was the rocking chair.

For more context, if you sit on a certain part of our couch, you have a clear view of the front door. Next to the front door, we have a glass window, not fully see, through, but enough that you can make out obvious shapes. One of those things you can see is the rocking chair.

As soon as I saw it moving, I didn’t want to jump to conclusions because I assumed it could just be the wind. I checked the weather right after it happened and, to my recollection, there was no wind at all. 

I did record it happening from where I was sitting on the couch and you can see it very clearly. In the video you can see how irregular it is. At some points it would stop as if something was leaning back in it completely.

—

There’s something else that happened that I wanted to add. I used to stay up really late at night in the living room, but not in the same spot where I could see the front door. Instead, I sat more toward the other end of the couch. If it helps, I can provide a photo of the layout, I really don’t mind at all.

But, I would stay up at night on my iPad, usually playing Roblox with friends. However, I would always get the feeling as if something or someone was watching me. And I know a lot of people have heard of others saying that they get the feeling that “someone’s watching them”, but this felt different. It didn’t feel random, it felt familiar, like someone I knew was watching me.

Whenever I looked up, sometimes out of the corner of my eye it seemed like someone was peeking around the hallway corner… like they were just standing there watching me, and then quickly ducked away the moment I looked up from my iPad. It reminded me so much of my aunt who had Down syndrome. She was always super curious about whatever you were doing, but the second you’d look at her, she’d act all shy and pretend she wasn’t interested. The whole energy of it felt just like that.

There was one night in particular, around maybe 3 or 4 a.m., where the feeling was really strong. I was looking down at my iPad, and out of nowhere it looked like someone walked from the hallways in front of the fireplace and then suddenly turned and darted back down the hallway. It was quick, like someone changing their mind halfway through.

My first thought was that it might’ve been one of my parents, but they don’t get up until around 5 or 6 a.m. When they woke up later that morning, I asked both of them if they had walked down the hallway or passed by the fireplace at all, and they both said no, they had just gotten up.

So that’s another experience I’ve had. I know stories without physical evidence aren’t always convincing, but I can absolutely take pictures of the hallway, the couch, the fireplace, and where everything happened, especially at night, if that helps anyone understand the layout better. I would’ve added the photos to the post right away, but I wanted to see if anyone was actually interested before putting myself out there like that.

Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read all of this. I truly appreciate it. 

Again, just left me know if you’d like videos or pictures of anything!",8,1762838444.0,Paranormal,1,0.91,False

1ou0zuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ou0zuy/sf_janes_dystopia/,[SF] Jane’s dystopia,"“Identification?”
The wristband commissioned by our government sits on my wrist, locked in place for eternity. My entire life, passport, resume, license, blood test results, contained all within. A quick tap and im allowed through a series of security screening systems that will detect if I have hidden any contraband on or within my person. If I were pregnant or had a tumor, even early stages, this machine may find out before I do.  After this, I am allowed within the building. There is nobody around as I complete these checkpoints as the ceo thought it better to stagger staff entry into the building. An employee who is distracted by their colleagues may not perform their duties as effectively. I am then brought to my cubicle, where I work as an artificial intelligence engineer.
Before, I worked as an artist,much to my mothers distaste, spending my days in my sunroom painting beautiful landscapes but now it is impossible to live off of an artists income, especially when AI is able to print anything she may craft, in a fraction of the time. Healthcare alone was a struggle for most, and with governmental assistance cut off it was hard to get back on your feet.The world is constantly changing, and those who did not conform died of starvation or illness. Some took to the streets, living in tents and boxes but with the new big beautiful ordinance, they all disappeared. When Synhaima came out with an entry level job listing that included paid training, full benefits and free housing, it was hard to say no. When Jane received the offer she tried to hold onto her morals, to do something she felt had meaning but the cabinets were empty and had been for a while. Only out of pure desperation she, along with everyone else who hadn’t joined this gilded era of technology, signed over her autonomy. Teachers, artists, musicians all replaced by AI. Even small business owners suffered, as the gaijin (the outsiders) were seen as a status.They never have a bad day at work, or call out for a last minute emergency. There’s no need to offer benefits to a machine, they don’t have dental or vision. They simply work. They do as they are programmed and shut down at the end of the day. 
In this way, it is almost envious. Jane remembers her regulars, the nice man at her gas station, Javi or her barista Britney, and her mail lady, Rebecca. Jane thinks about them often, even though they probably do not think of her. Where did they end up? Now all the cars are electric, coffees are premade and shipped bulk, and snail mail became a thing of the past with Amazon converting to using drones. 
Now at my desk I begrudgingly supporting their cause, filing error codes and claims. No actual engineering,just meaningless work until im allowed to leave, not to my own home as a real house is a luxury not meant for the common folk, but to a temporary rental the company provides. 
I reach into my desk for my migraine medication, as the fluorescent lights are already triggering an episode. When she asked her supervisor for permission to bring in her own lighting, it was shutdown for fear of other employees thinking she got special treatment. She’s also not allowed to carry a water bottle for fear it may spill on the technology, so she’s forced to dry swallow her medicine. It sits in her chest uncomfortably, but she knows it’s only a matter of time until it dissolves. 
By noon, the food trolley rolls its way to her door, and it’s time for her (company provided) lunch. Today is Wednesday so she already knows it’s sandwich day. Looking down into the brown sack, she is correct. One soggy turkey sandwich, an apple that is well past its prime, and a plastic water bottle. 
“Thank-“ I stop myself before finishing. The robot doesn’t care if she’s grateful, it’s not even aware if she’s there. It waits exactly two minutes before moving to the next cubical. I sigh, ripping the plastic off of my sandwich. When recruited for the job, they promised full meals everyday but that went away after the government announced the rations due to our ongoing war with Russia. 
“YOU CANT KEEP DOING THIS!!” A women’s voice shakes me back to reality. When was the last time she heard somebody talk, let alone scream within the office? Curiosity killed the cat, but I can’t help but peak around my door to see what’s going on. 
A petite woman with pin straight black hair is red faced, in obvious distress,”WE ARE HUMAN, NOT MACHINE!!”
To the side, she spots the floor manager, already calling for backup. 
“Ma’am im sorry but in today’s climate we must make cutbacks..” he says quietly, as if he knows what he is doing is wrong. 
“WE SIGNED A CONTRACT. IM OBLIGATED TO SEVERANCE”
“Ma’am it says it in section B, we are allowed-“
“YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY LAWYER”
The security finally finds their way, immediately detaining the woman using brute force and her screams slowly fade as they take her away. 
I cautiously glance at the floor manager, who shakes his head and goes back into his own cubicle before turning around myself and going back to my sad, sad sandwich. 
By the end of the day I have taken double my dosage of migraine medicine, accomplished absolutely nothing of real value, and have nothing to look forward to if not the comfort of my bed whenever I get home. 7:20 pm. One more year and I get to leave 20 minutes earlier, as those who have worked for the company longer get priority when they stagger the exits. On my way out I once again go through the security and tap my bracelet. Once outside the building I see an ambulance, and pools of blood at the bottom of the concrete steps. There’s nobody walking on the streets, some cars whiz by but they aren’t seeing what I am, they are focused on getting home. I cautiously step around the blood, eyeing the stretcher to try to understand what happened. All I can see is her black hair, the same hair from earlier and a bracelet, stained pink from all of the blood lying on the ground. She must’ve ripped it out, I move slowly knowing until I am inside of my house I am being watched by cameras. I pretend to drop something from my bag, the medics are crowded around the woman, forcibly bringing her back to this life. Jane assumes the woman wants to die, as everyone knows you don’t last long once you pull the bracelet off. They are never meant to come off, but I have heard of people going insane and ripping them out before. It’s not covered on the news, as it’s not good for morale. Just whispers on private forums online. 
“Do you need something?” One of the medics bark at me, bringing me yet again out of my thoughts. 
“No…”
I go home. There’s nothing I could do to help, but the passion in the woman’s voice rings throughout my head while my car drives me home. 
Another tap. Another traceable movement for the government to watch. Another submission to the system. The rental im allowed to stay in couldn’t be more different from my old house, the walls are all painting a light grey, there’s not very many windows but Atleast here I can avoid the fluorescent lights found everywhere else. I miss cooking, but now everything affordable is precooked and boxed up so I open the next meal (chicken rice and broccoli) and shove it in the microwave. Did she get fired? What did he say about cutbacks? Could I be next?
Beep. Beep. Beep. 
I force the food down, as it’s almost always under seasoned due to health concerns and salt is for people who can afford a good healthcare plan. My mother used to make the most delicious meals, although she never let me have a second serving for fear I’d gain weight. I take a shower and another pill to help me sleep before I can start my routine again. 

“YOU CANT KEEP DOING THIS”
The woman?it takes a moment for my eyes to adjust before I realize she’s looking at me. 
“I AM A HUMAN BEING, LOOK AT ME” she’s screaming, moving closer and getting in my face. Adrenaline pumps in my veins, a feeling so foreign to my small life. I open my mouth to ask what’s going on, but my voice takes on another conversation,”security..” I say with an eerie calmness.
“NO, NO THEYLL KILL ME” she’s screaming, I can hear her vocal cords tearing. It doesn’t sound human, it sounds primal. Goosebumps form on my arms as she’s carried away. Suddenly a crimson wave floods around my feet, her blood. It’s all over. It’s in the carpet, I can feel the wetness seeping through my shoes as I wiggle my toes but cannot seem to take a step. The room is filling, her blood no doubt staining my socks, but all I can focus on is the rotting apple on top of my desk. 

I wake up in a cold sweat, shivering within my damp sheets. It was just a dream. I practice what chat GPT tells me, breathe in…1..2..3..4, and after a good ten minutes im back into routine. 
Brush teeth, eat pre packed egg bites, don’t think about the taste,think about the protein, get dressed, grab premade coffee, get to work-
“STOP, NO!”
Her voice interrupts me yet again. I look around, did she live? No. This is my imagination. There’s a stain on the stairs leading up to the building, a small piece left behind soon to be removed as a power washer is hums to life. After my shift is done, it will all be gone. As if she never existed. I look down at my bracelet, and tug slightly. It pulls on my veins, threatening me, daring me to pull harder. I don’t. I go to work, but I don’t get anything done. When lunch is dropped off (a cup ramen and more water) I ignore it until the trolley moves on. Instead, I think of the woman’s blood, pooling around my feet, warming my toes as it works through the thin fabric around them. I imagine what it would taste like, warmed like a fresh cup of tea. Bitter notes of life with small, sweet moments of relief.

1ou0zsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1ou0zsg/review_just_took_the_boonsiri_new_route_bus_ferry/,"[Review] Just took the ""Boonsiri"" new route (Bus + Ferry) from Bangkok to Koh Tao. Honestly 10/10, and here’s why.","Hey everyone,

I know figuring out the best way to get from Bangkok to the islands can be a pain, so I wanted to share a genuinely great experience I just had with **Boonsiri High Speed Ferries** on their new BKK -> Koh Tao route.

I booked the joint ticket (VIP Bus + Ferry). Here’s the breakdown:

**The Good (Pros):**

* **Punctuality (The #1 Win):** This is what blew me away. I've used other services before that are always late. Boonsiri was **perfectly on time.** The boarding call was quick, the ferry left *exactly* on schedule, and we arrived at Koh Tao *exactly* when they said we would. This is a massive plus.
* **Cleanliness:** Both the VIP bus and the catamaran ferry were *spotless*. Like, impressively clean. Bathrooms included.
* **Comfort:** The bus seats were wide and comfortable (easy to sleep). The ferry was new and spacious.
* **Service:** Staff were professional and friendly all the way, from the bus staff in Bangkok to the pier crew in Chumphon.
* **The ""Extras"":** You get a free (and tasty) snack box and water on the bus. THEN, when you get to the pier (Pak Nam Chumphon Pier), you get a **free breakfast box!** It's simple, but so nice to have something to eat before boarding. They also have a cafe/bakery for sale if you want real coffee.

**The (Minor) ""Con"":**

* The AC on the bus is **COLD**. Like, arctic-level cold, haha. They *do* provide blankets, but I’d still recommend wearing a hoodie or pants if you get cold easily.

**Conclusion:** It was just a super smooth, comfortable, and reliable trip. I saw lots of other Thais and foreigners on board who seemed just as happy. If you're looking for a stress-free way to get to Koh Tao, I 100% recommend them.

**TL;DR:** Boonsiri's BKK-Koh Tao (Bus+Ferry) combo is fantastic. Clean bus/ferry, great service, free snacks + free breakfast box. The only ""con"" is the freezing bus AC (but they give blankets). The best part: **they are perfectly on time.**",8,1762838047.0,ThailandTourism,0,0.9,False

I was before turning 23 and I did mess up the year the last post.   It was 1997.   
This was my very first hook up when I moved out my parents house and got my own place.   My first gay sexual experience.   I recently found out about Gay.com.  A place that had local hook up rooms.   I filled out my profile and days later I got a hit.   He was a no profile, no picture person, but we talked.   (For the youngs here we didnt have cell phones with cameras or digital camera back then.  Only way to get pics online was scan them, or get one hour photo to put a roll on disc) He still never gave me a picture.  While we talked he told me he was 25 years old, 6 ft 1 in, 150 , blonde and blue eyes (had that preference on my profile also).   We talked for a good month online and also on the phone a few times.   I thought he was for real, so one Friday in March.   BDay in April.  We agreed that I would go to his house, I got as sexy as I could, wanted this to work, wanted this dude to be my dream guy, my lover, future husband and all.   I got to his house, knocked and he never revealed himself till he closed the door and locked it.   He was not 25 and his stats.  He was late 40s short and big.   I tried to escape to be only punched multiple times and passing out.   I woke up about 4 hours later.  I went there at 10 that night woke up around 2 in the morning.   He cut and shredded my clothes.  He had my legs roped up, my right hand still roped up.  I have no idea why he left my left arm loose.   But he was singing in the shower.   I was feeling blood coming out of my ass and saw it.  I got up quickly and quickly unbound myself, I only found my keys and wallet.   I snuck out of the house and fled.  I had about 20 miles to my place and I was naked.   I did keep a coat in my car so I threw that on.  

I came home bloody, I came home and pushed my heavy couch against the door, locked it.  Looked out my sliding glass door to the parking lot for a good 30 minutes thinking he followed me.  Later when I thought I had a degree of safety, I did the crying, I did the self loathing, I did all the emotions.   I filled my tub full of hot water.   Sat in the tub for hours trying to get clean and stop the blood coming out my ass, tried to nurse my wounds.   Once that was over I was still scared and went to sleep on the couch instead of the bed.   He never came to my place at all.   I did ask about 2 days later if the locks could be change.  I was so afraid at the time he made a copy.

For weeks I told stories to people main one I fell going down my steps.  I did live in a second story apartment.   I never seeked treatment, I healed myself through the pain.   Again very red state conservative republican family.  I never reported for that reason.  Also my grandparents were still alive and didnt want them to know I was Gay.   

Three weeks later I was watching local news and it was him on it and they found a dead body in his trunk, a young guy around my age.  They found some porn on his computer, black market death porn of young boys and men.  When the trial came up I took a few days off and went to trial and sat off in the back.  He stated according to him that was his first kill, but he raped and sodomized others (like me).  He said if he was not caught he would have kept on going and his idol was Gacy.  He was sentenced to life without parole.   6 years later he was shanked and died, good riddance.

Future me, I have become guarded for myself.  I still did and do online hook ups. But if there was no profile or pics I never talked to them.   Even with pics I asked for a public meeting.  Local mom and pop coffee shop or diner now Starbucks If they couldn't do it they were blocked.   I learned how to defend myself better.   I seeked therapy some 20 years later when I went through my divorce and I finally opened up about it and he helped me more.   I opened up to alot of youths that was questioning about hooking up with others and telling them my horror story.   

I am fine now, I am 51.  The killer is dead, I am alive.  I am living life, eating and drinking, breathing air, driving my Mustang, working, doing several hobbies (Lego) and surviving.   

Last I do feel sorry immensely about the young man that died.  I should have reported it and say be damn with everything but I didnt.   I am sorry really am. ",2,1762837940.0,serialkillers,0,0.67,False

I used the same beans (El Salvador), same grinder (ZP6 4.5) with the same grind setting, same water, same filter papers (1zpresso V60 filters) and used the same technique! Honestly I'm considering buying a V60 because I feel done with my origami, but I know that there are people that can brew delicious coffee with that dripper.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Afternoon from Bangkok, Thailand :)

It was great reading all your posts about small victories - apologies that I didn't reply to everyone, but I definitely read them all!


Wanted to give some quick insight: Sunday's DCI had 1.3k posts, roughly 200 more than Monday's 1.1k. **HOWEVER**: Monday's DCI had 24k views, 4,000 more than Sunday's thread of 20k. I assume this is the sober-curious folks who may have stumbled upon this subreddit or are just passively monitoring wondering if it's time to make a change. Just wanted to reach out to these people - you are welcome here!


**TODAY'S SONG**: Sound the Alarm by Thievery Corporation (pretty sure I stole this idea from Lily Jayne)

I did ~1 hour of deadlifts yesterday at the gym after posting the DCI. I've been loading up the protein for the last ~24 hours, got ~9 hours of sleep, and am now fully caffeinated. I'm feeling rebellious, so let's discuss an aspect of my personality that has helped me stay 500+ days sober: Stubbornness.

For better or worse at times, I am an incredibly stubborn motherfucker. This goes back to my childhood where my Mom told me I would reject things/ideas/people by saying ""not for NT!"" When I set my mind to something that I feel is right, there's no changing it.

For sobriety, I think this trait goes beyond willpower, restraint, or determination. It is a full rejection of the poison. It's that dogged aspect of my personality where I simply say ""I'm not fucking doing it!""

""I don't care if you're doing shots, I don't care about your peer pressure, I don't care for your 'you can have just one' bullshit, I don't care that you have 'a good bottle of wine'. **NOT. FOR. NT.**

So I'll pose this question: Are you stubborn? Does stubbornness play a role in your sobriety?

Perhaps a little bit intense for a morning post but the coffee is kicking in and I'm priming myself for leg day this afternoon. SQUATS A2G! IWNDWYT

1ou0rmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ou0rmg/how_do_i_tell_my_husband_im_uncomfortable_with/,How do I tell my husband I’m uncomfortable with him staying with a female colleague on work trips?,"I was going to post this on AITAH but since I’m 95% sure I’m not the asshole, I guess I’m looking for relationship advice instead. Soooo… would I be the asshole if I \[38f\] told my husband \[40m\] I don’t want him to stay with a colleague \[45F, single\] when they travel together for work?

My husband and Colleague are part of a dozen independently contracted people within a professional creative group, which manages projects with clients. Husband and Colleague find their work to be complimentary, so they’re hoping to work on more projects together. Husband and I live in City A, we’re from City B (where both sets of parents live), and City C is where Professional Group and Colleague are based.

Last time Husband was working in City C he stayed on Colleague’s couch. Fine, whatever, not a big deal for a one-off thing. Then he had a job in City B last week that she worked with him on, and they stayed at his parents house together Tues-Saturday. To clarify: City B is my hometown, where my family also lives. I didn’t know about this until he was on the way out the door Tuesday. If he had mentioned it I probably would have said “oh, wouldn’t everyone be more comfortable if she was put up in a hotel?” Granted, budget was a consideration, but my feeling is that if the group, client, or husband can’t afford an assistant on a project, then it can’t be a requisite for the job. And this isn’t a one time scenario, he plans to keep working with her, so this will definitely come up again in some iteration.

Relationship background: Husband and I have been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. We were actually together for a while 15 years ago but our paths diverged. In a crazy full circle way we were brought back together and I’m happier than I’ve ever been in a partnership. Our relationship is based on mutual respect and admiration, and he is extremely loyal when it comes to friends, family, and me. I want to make it clear that I trust him 100%. This isn’t about infidelity, it’s about boundaries and respect and how he shows that he cares about my feelings.

All week I’ve been dealing with icks and ughs about this. It’s been occupying a huge portion of my thoughts. I was by myself while they were working together every day, sharing meals, presumably hanging out until bedtime? And then of course there are my irrational, neurotic thoughts like “did he make coffee for her every morning? Did she use my MIL’s shampoo? Does he think she’s cooler than me? Is he going to run off to City C because it’s way more rewarding than our life together??” I hate that I’m this insecure and jealous and prone to ruminating on this stuff. Yes, I have a therapist, yes, we talk about this sort of thing.  It *might* be different if I had met Colleague or knew ANY details about her at all. All I know about her is that they have a lot in common and she’s apparently comfortable with this level of familiarity with a married colleague.

I’m already prepared for how it will go if I bring this up. His reaction at best is going to be invalidating my feelings in the guise of reassurance (“you’re being silly! That’s ridiculous, what are you worried about?”) or defensive (“why are you admonishing me when I’ve done nothing wrong?”) He bristles when it comes to personal critique, which makes it hard to express my feelings sometimes. He’s not one to conform to the conventions of society, so me saying “this is objectively inappropriate” or “this simply isn’t done” would not be useful arguments. He usually means well, but can be really blind to how his actions affect me. I’m really hoping that me saying I’m uncomfortable is enough for him to agree to the very reasonable request of getting Colleague a damn hotel room next time.

Ok, so here’s a part I was on the fence about adding in, because all of the above is enough for being upset, but it’s important in the context of my emotional needs not being prioritized (and it definitely adds to my sensitive emotional state). My mom died 3 months ago, so I drove up to City B on Friday to prep for my mom’s Sunday memorial celebration. I thought Husband was going to join me at my parent’s house across town Friday night, but I guess there was a miscommunication and he had to do a bit more work on this project Saturday. We talked about this on the phone Thursday and he told me he was probably going to stay with his parents Saturday night too, so Colleague wouldn’t be uncomfortable at the house without him there. I basically told him no, I needed him with me. I honestly can’t even believe he entertained the idea of prioritizing her comfort over my need for his support during a huge emotional life event. A few days before the memorial.

I love this person. I trust him, but I’m frustrated and sad. Why is he such a dummy when it comes to all this shit?? The big work job is done, and we got through the memorial. Now I guess I’m looking for some communication advice, some validation, and maybe personal experience. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.



**tl;dr: Husband is overfamiliar with a female colleague. He doesn’t think it’s a problem, but the real issue is that he's oblivious to how this makes me feel. I’m not sure how to raise it without him getting defensive.**",13,1762837329.0,relationships,33,0.88,False

Up until yesterday.. or very early this morning 😆  my weight is at 221.3 and the plateau range  221.3/223.5.

Like I've previously posted before,   host of factors and decisions come into play.

One; the Semaglutide is really kicking in and working,  secondly, I'm listening to my body and have recognized that those cravings are that little red devil sitting on my right shoulder 😆 and it's all mental.

  I refuse not to eat... because you need those calories to function and have good health.  So I limit myself (at least for me) coffee and a banana with some walnuts or cashews before work recognizing that I need something to fuel the body until my meal break.  Even then I'll not eat much.

As previously posted I'm a campus safety officer on foot patrol. So I walk alot on the job 40 plus hours a week. Just recently I've gone back to light free weights 12/15 pounds sets of dumbbells with a structured workout plan through the Fit Father Project , they've helped explained and help me understand about the nutrition aspect of it as well as getting at least 6 hours of good sleep,  otherwise it's all for not. 

Conclusion: incorporating all things have given me positive results.  I'm adding my weight chart for this month for review, any questions feel free to pm me.

The waitress placed the cinnamon roll between us. It was a behemoth, a glorious spiral of dough and glistening icing, radiating warmth.

This was it. The moment of truth.

""Don't,"" Sarah said, her voice quiet but firm. She wasn't looking at me; she was staring at the pastry, as if it were a bomb she was trying to defuse with her mind.

""Don't what?"" I asked, already reaching for my fork.

""Don't do... *that*."" Her eyes flicked up to mine, pleading. ""Just this once, Chris. Please. Unroll it. Like a normal person.""

I sighed. We'd had this discussion before. ""Babe, it's just faster this way. It's more efficient. You get the perfect ratio of center-g-to-edge-crust in every bite.""

""It's not about efficiency, it's about the *process*,"" she argued, her hands gripping her coffee mug. ""It's a ritual. You savor it. You start at the outside and work your way to the heart. That's the reward!""

I looked at her, and then at the roll. I loved her, I truly did. But tradition is just peer pressure from dead people. And in this moment, my ""peers"" were telling me to peel a sticky piece of bread apart for ten minutes.

""I can't,"" I said.

Her face hardened. ""You're really going to do it, aren't you?""

I picked up the fork and knife. I lined up my shot, aimed directly for the gooey, perfect center, and plunged the fork down. I cut a wedge, a perfect cross-section of the entire roll, and lifted it. Icing dripped onto the plate.

Sarah gasped. It was a sharp, horrified sound.

""It's chaos, Chris,"" she whispered, shaking her head. ""Pure, unadulterated chaos. How can you live like this?""

""It's a cinnamon roll, Sarah, not a moral failing."" I took the bite. It was, as always, transcendent.

""That's just it,"" she said, sliding out of the booth. She threw a ten-dollar bill on the table. ""You say that, but you don't see the connection. If you can't respect the roll, what else don't you respect? Our relationship? Me?""

""That's a... that's a *huge* leap, don't you think?"" I said, my mouth half-full.

""Is it?"" She had her jacket on now. ""I need order, Chris. I need someone who understands that some things are done a certain way for a reason. I can't be with an anarchist.""

And with that, she walked out of the diner, leaving me alone with my mutilated pastry and the ruins of our relationship. I stared at the hole I'd carved in the center, a perfect metaphor for what had just happened.

When I was about eight, I remember sitting at home, walking around the house pretending to be trekking through the forests in Oregon, breathing in the fresh air of a world that hadn’t been violated by skyscrapers or traffic backed up for hours — buses and cars idling mindlessly, waiting to escape the gridlock.

This world I had built in my mind — of birds singing high up in the Douglas firs, or hearing an elk bugle in the middle of its rut, ready to fight any bull willing to clash, like I had seen on TV and in old *National Geographic* magazines — was only a fever dream of mine. Being able to escape the twenty-by-twenty-foot backyard I had grown so accustomed to.

However, this would change when I turned twelve. I had known my grandpa lived in Montana, but I always wondered why we never went to visit him. I always thought it had something to do with living in California — the distance being just too much to deal with.

My dad and my grandfather had a falling out right before he left Montana to go be with my mom in California. They had met on the side of the road where my mom’s car had broken down. My dad was driving back from town when he spotted her. He told me, “There she was, sitting on the side of the road waving her arms like they were on fire.” He always joked that even without her glasses on and at a mile away, she could see how handsome he was in that blue ’68 F-250.

The only thing louder than her sigh was a tornado siren.

I never really knew what my dad and grandpa had fought about back then, but I know that when my mom got pregnant with me, the dynamic between them changed. It brought them closer together — well, as close as they could be.

This small change made it possible for me, with more pleading and begging than you could ever imagine, to spend time with my grandpa.

My grandpa was the type of person who knew everything about the trees, the soil, the animals — basically anything natural. He had always been that way at least that's what I was told. He grew up in Alaska, hunting and fishing and selling his day’s work in town. He would eventually start his own guided hunting business, which turned out to be very enticing for those who wanted to get outside of their cubicle and 9-to-5 job to get a taste of how man was supposed to live.

He had saved up enough money to eventually buy land where his nearest neighbor was an hour away in any direction.

The day before I was supposed to fly out, my dad sat me down and told me, “Tommy, I want you to have fun and enjoy being with your grandpa, but promise me you won’t take any of his stories seriously.”

“Why?” I asked, with a puzzling look etched onto my face.

“Your grandpa spent a lot of time out in the woods and with these people who lived like him. The stories they would all sit down and share around the campfire or in small bars were nothing but old drunken men telling tall tales.”

I nodded, looking at my dad — not fully understanding what he meant back then, but I know now.

The next day I was on a flight to Montana to spend four days hunting, fishing, hiking, and mostly spending time with a part of my family that I never really knew.

I landed at about 2:00 p.m. that day, impatiently waiting at the baggage claim for my duffel bag full of everything I’d need for this excursion. I grabbed my bags and slowly found my way outside, and standing there waiting for me was Grandpa.

I had seen a couple of pictures of him in old photo albums, but never in person. He was a mountain of a man — standing head and shoulders above anyone around us. He had a thick gray beard and long silver hair. He wore an old cowboy hat, jeans, boots, and a flannel Carhartt jacket that you could’ve used as a blanket, it was so large.

I was always told I was rather big for my age, but when he hugged me and picked me up, I never felt smaller.

“Tommy, it’s so nice to finally get to meet you,” he said, bellowing with the deepest voice I had ever heard.

He grabbed both of my duffel bags — which I had struggled to carry with one hand — and hoisted them into the bed of his pickup. We didn’t waste any time hopping inside the truck and making our way back to his house.

We left the city, and as soon as we did, there was nothing but wide open plains with bison grazing or sprawling forests that could’ve hidden all the secrets in the world. Looking back on it now, it wasn’t big enough to hide one of them.

He must have seen me staring out the window in awe. “Gorgeous, ain’t it?” he asked.

I looked at him and said, “Dad used to tell me stories about this — how he and his buddies would ride four-wheelers and hunt rabbits in these fields. About how these golden landscapes would seem to stretch past the horizon.”

Grandpa chuckled. “Your dad and his friends were hell on wheels back then. Drinking, fighting, and who knows what else those boys would do after school.”

I never would’ve assumed that of the man who drove a Honda CR-V and worked for the leading software company in all of California — the man I had never seen get mad or so much as raise his voice.

We drove for another hour before we made it to his land. He had a large metal gate at the bottom of his property with a big *‘Trespassers will be shot’* sign chained to the metalwork. He held the gate open as I slid into the driver’s seat and slowly drove the truck just past the gate, where he put the padlocked chain back on and took over the wheel again.

His driveway stretched for what seemed like miles, surrounded by cedar and pines that touched the sky. The dirt driveway gave way beneath the tires, flinging earth behind us — as if the road itself wanted to escape.

It had rained a couple of hours before we arrived, so there was still water on the trees, making the bark look almost black — as if they had absorbed all the sin in the world.

Before we started driving again, Grandpa looked at me and said, “Once we get past that gate, this is my world, and the only laws that govern it are the ones you and I make for it.”

The sun was past noon and the light gave the trees a golden aura. It was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen.

When we got to the cabin, I really got to see what his life was like. There was a tall oak cabin that he had built when he first bought the property. It stood fifty yards from a river with a current strong enough to carry you downstream but not strong enough that you couldn’t paddle against it to get back.

A small garage where he kept his kayaks, four-wheelers, tractor, and anything else he felt belonged in there. Most of it seemed random, but I assumed that when you lived so far away from anyone or anything, it was better to have things and not need them than to need them and not have them.

We got out of the truck, and I grabbed my bags from the bed. We walked onto the large porch. The porch sagged a little in the middle and showed the scars of decades of weather. Two rocking chairs sat there — his and my grandma’s — but hers hadn’t been sat in for ten years now.

Above the door hung the twelve-point antlers of a whitetail deer. He caught me staring at them in adoration.

“I remember when I shot that deer,” he said, putting a hand on my shoulder. “I had just finished building the cabin, and I was on the roof putting extra chink down when I saw him drinking from the river about a hundred yards away. I snuck down, grabbed my 30-30 with the scope, got back up on the roof, put the crosshairs just behind his shoulder, cocked the hammer back slowly, squeezed the trigger on the exhale — and boom! He dropped where he stood. Fed me and your grandma for two weeks.”

When we got inside, the house smelled like oak, campfire, and gun oil. There was a large table big enough to seat seven, maybe eight people. A small sink sat below a window that looked out toward the driveway and the woodline. I looked out into the woods, feeling like the forest was staring back at me.

He showed me to my room. It was small, but it didn’t matter. Paintings of wildlife scattered the walls, with a nightstand and a closet completing the space. I almost wondered if he had made them himself, but I couldn’t imagine him sitting in front of an easel with a palette in one hand and a brush in the other.

“This is where you’ll be staying while you’re here — and if you like it enough, maybe when you come back too,” he said with a small smile.

I beamed up at him, knowing I wanted nothing more than to spend every minute here.

I set the bags down on the floor and walked out to the kitchen with him. He pulled two backstraps from the fridge.

“Have you ever eaten mulies before?”

“No,” I said.

“Well, that changes tonight.”

Forty-five minutes later, we were sitting on his porch with backstrap, potatoes, and corn for dinner. I had grown up eating in some of the nicer restaurants in California, but nothing came close to how good this was.

We were about done with our meal when he pointed out to the mountain in front of his house and said, “You see that ridge right there?”

“Yeah,” I answered.

“Right past there is a bed for this elk herd that lives here. When your dad was about your age, he hiked up to that ridge, slipped down into where those elk beds were, and tried to sneak up on them with a slingshot he’d gotten for his birthday.”

He grinned, remembering when he and my father were still close.

“Did he ever manage to hit one?” I asked.

“Naw, but I tell you what — he sure did piss his boots when the largest bull of that herd stood up and bugled something fierce.”

We both laughed thinking about my dad running back home, trying not to get caught.

He laughed again, then grew quiet as he looked back at the ridge. “I ain’t seen that herd in a couple seasons now.”

We walked back inside and sat down at the large wooden table. He put his hat on the table and walked over to the cupboard, grabbing a glass, a bottle of 80 proof, and a soda for me. He sat and poured the bourbon in the glass and looked at me.

“I always hoped that one day you’d be here,” he said, smiling.

“Me too,” I said.

He finished his glass, then poured another. “Have you ever heard any of the legends about this place, Tommy?” he asked, leaning back in his chair.

I shook my head.

“Back when I bought this land, I’d gone down into town to buy some supplies — building materials, food, a generator, guns, bullets, bourbon, etc. When I was buying lumber, the man who owned the place, old man Jim, was checking me out when he asked me, ‘You’re not from around here, are you, son?”

“‘No sir. I just moved here from Alaska. I just bought a plot of land about an hour out of town, and I’m gonna put a cabin out there,” I told him.

“The old man asked me where I’d bought it.

“The piece of land right off Country Road 47,” I said.

“The smile on his face faded as soon as he heard that. ‘What’s wrong?’ I asked him. Jim looked at me and shook his head. Told me, ‘Don’t build too deep in the timbers out there.’

“I asked, ‘Why?’

“He told me there’s something that lives out in the pines where the fog gets real thick and the trees grow so close together they make a wall. Those things — once they see you, they’ll follow you all around. They hunt you from the heat of your breath, and they can smell you from a state away, Tommy. People around here say it’s hunters who went out, got lost, and couldn’t find their way home. They still lurk out there, deep in the woods. They move so fast people call them *Wind Walkers.*”

I sat back in my chair thinking about what he had just said. He picked up his glass and waved it in the air, seeing the visible fright on my face.

“Ah, you ain’t oughta put too much thought into it, Tommy boy. My guess is it’s just a story to spook the kids from running too far off into the woods.”

I felt how hard I had been gripping the chair when I picked my head up to ask him, “Have you ever seen one before, Grandpa?”

The old man looked out the window next to the sink and said, “Naw, Tommy, I ain’t — and I aim to keep it that way for both of us.”

He stood up from the table and yawned. “Well, Tommy, I think it’s about time we get to bed. We got a long day tomorrow, and we’re having trout for dinner — and I ain’t got any in the freezer,” he said with a wink and a smile.

I sat at the table as he walked down the long hallway to his room and listened to the wind whistle through the trees.

  
  
  
  
  


That next morning, I woke up to the smell of coffee and the crisp air you can only find through the mountains lofting in through the slight crack of the window in my room. Outside, I heard Grandpa making his axe sing with every swipe he took — *thunk*, then a brief pause, and then another *thunk*. I grabbed my boots and wandered outside, where he had made a sizable pile of split logs to feed the furnace in the living room.

“I would have guessed you’d cut down half the trees on this mountain by the size of that pile. You been out here long?” I asked him.

“Long enough for that coffee to burn if it ain’t get poured, Tommy boy,” he said with a playful smile.

I went inside and fetched him a mug full. When I came back out and handed it to him, he put the axe down and took a long swig.

“Good man,” he said.

We spent most of the day working the land — picking apples, mending fences, and stacking the pile of logs Grandpa had split earlier that day. We chatted while we worked, never about anything serious, more so about life lessons.

We were cleaning a bramble of thorns from one of the fences when Grandpa stood up and said, “Tommy, what do you see in front of you?”

I looked at him, confused. “A fence with some thorns on it.”

I felt so dumb for stating the obvious. Grandpa looked at me with a smirk. “Well yes, but it’s more than that. Think about the fence as your mind, your body, or your soul. The thorns represent all the badness in the world. You want to pull the thorns off the fence before they become too ensnared, before you can’t get them off.”

I looked at him, thinking how such a simple analogy could carry a weight that heavy.

We worked for what felt like years, and that summer heat might have been hotter than the sun. It was about five in the afternoon when Grandpa pulled the blue hanky out of his back pocket and wiped his face, pulling his attention from the new garden bed we had been working on.

“Well, Tommy boy, I figure we ought to go catch our dinner. How does that sound?”

I don’t think I could have nodded my head any harder.

We went into the house, and I waited for Grandpa to come back out with our fishing supplies. When he came out, he had two fishing poles and a tackle box. He set them down, then walked back to his room. I sat there wondering what else we would need to go fishing. When Grandpa walked back out, he had with him a scoped Marlin 336 in .30-30, a Remington 870 in 12 gauge, and a Ruger Super Redhawk in .454.

I asked him what the guns were for if we were just going fishing. He looked at me and said, “Oh, you know — the local wildlife.”

I figured he meant a bear or a wolf. 

I carried all the fishing gear while Grandpa carried the guns. We walked about a mile or two down the river to a spot where Grandpa said the trout were always hiding. We tied on some flies and spent an hour fishing. He taught me how to let the fly mimic the way a bug would float on the water’s surface. He told me to be patient and let the fish take some line out before setting the hook.

Being this far into nature was something I had dreamed of for so long. Getting to spend time with someone who enjoyed it just as much — if not more — made it that much better.

I sat on the bank of the river watching Grandpa cast his line out and saw the small bugs land on the water, only to be eaten by predators lurking just beneath the surface. A looming danger that was so close yet unknown to them until it was too late — if they even knew what happened before they were swallowed whole.

This time with Grandpa was the most fun I had ever had.

I picked my rod back up and walked about ten feet from where Grandpa was standing. I put my pole on the ground to clip the line and tie on a new fly. When I picked my head back up, that’s when I saw it. I didn’t know what it was, but I knew it was something that hadn’t been there before — or at least I didn’t think it was.

At the top of the ridge where my dad had snuck up on elk with his slingshot was a person. But something seemed off, because where this person was walking, there wasn’t a steady path. The ridge was mostly loose boulders that were too risky to walk across, so my Grandpa and Dad had cleared out a trail just above — that’s how my dad used to go up there to watch the elk in their bed.

I turned my head and called out to Grandpa. “I think someone’s on the ridge,” I said, pointing just as the sun was slowly starting to hide behind its crest.

He followed my finger to the general area and pulled out this beaten-up pair of binoculars he had stuffed in his vest, hoping to see some bighorn sheep trying to get across the rocky terrain. He put the binoculars to his eyes and held them there for what seemed longer than necessary to determine who — or what — someone was doing up there.

It seemed weird to me that anyone would be on his property, but it wasn’t unheard of for people to hike on public land and accidentally wander onto private property. It didn’t raise much alarm at first, but seeing him stare at that ridgeline for so long made my chest feel tight.

“Is everything okay?” I asked nervously.

He didn’t answer right away. He put the binoculars down after a while and finally said, “It’s nothing, Tommy. Between the last bit of sun, the heat, the distance, and the water reflecting the light, just an optical illusion, buddy — nothing more.”

I didn’t fully believe him, but I had no reason not to. My dad’s words rang back in my mind.

Still, I stared.

“Tommy,” Grandpa yelled, “you ain’t ever gonna catch any fish staring at the sky, bud.”

He smiled at me, but the smile seemed almost insincere. I brushed it off, though. He picked his fishing rod back up and started casting again, but this time I noticed his hands shaking ever so slightly.

We had packed up our bucket of trout and started walking back when Grandpa, almost like he was thinking out loud, said, “Remember that story I was telling you about last night?”

“Yeah, those hunters who got lost and never came back.”

He nodded. “The locals used to say they could walk on the wind itself, gliding right over the earth. People would say they’d see them in places they had no way of being — the sides of cliffs, the middle of rivers where it was too deep to wade. Some of them said they weren’t really there, but instead it was an echo of something that had come and gone long ago. Something that should have left already, but maybe couldn’t — or didn’t want to.”

I glanced over my shoulder at the ridge just before we got back to the cabin. Where I had seen “something” was empty now, just another unoccupied spot on the side of a large mountain.

“Do you think that’s what I saw on the ridge?” I asked him, almost blurting it out.

Grandpa chuckled — or something that *constituted* as such. It almost came out like a cough, like he had swallowed something that got caught in his throat.

“Naw, buddy. I told you those were just some old ghost stories, that’s all. Every place has them. The old Indians that used to live here had stories about people who got caught in the woods during the winter and would eat the people with them in order to stay alive. These people would turn into large beasts and stalk the woods, looking for their next meal — howling or screaming in pain because they were cursed with an appetite they could never fill.”

I looked at him with a twinge of fright, but also a little relief that these ghost stories were just original to us.

“Don’t let that stuff cloud your head too much, bud. Remember what I said about keeping the thorns off your fence.”

I nodded my head in understanding.

By the time dinner was ready, the stars were starting to take over the sky. This was the first time I had ever seen a sky not interrupted by something man-made. It was like heaven itself had opened up and let the angels dance across it.

We ate on the porch again, with the firelight from the campfire just off the porch throwing long shapes into the yard. The wind had picked up, and I could hear it running through the trees.

“What?” I said, not fully hearing what Grandpa had asked me.

He turned his head. “I didn’t say anything, bud.”

I figured it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Grandpa stood up and asked me what I wanted to do tomorrow, knowing that after that, I’d have to go back home.

“I want to learn to shoot,” I said.

He rubbed my head as he walked in and told me that wouldn’t be a problem at all.

I walked into the cabin, shutting the door behind me and locking it. When I looked up, I could see a faint glow off in the distance — right on top of the ridge.

I walked off to my room and laid in bed, listening to the wind blow a branch against the window, faintly tapping on it. Then I heard heavy footsteps walking across the wooden floor, accompanied by a chair being dragged and then sat in — the final noise being the cocking of a pistol.

  
  
  


The next morning arrived with the singing of birds and the blue sky serving as its background. I looked out the window at the mountains, watching the clouds slowly climb their way up and eventually past the peaks. When I walked into the kitchen, the smell of metal, gun oil, and coffee hung strong in the air of the cabin.

“Look what the sunrise dragged in,” he said, not looking up. I sat down next to him. On the table were only a few of the guns Grandpa owned. He was polishing his rifle. The metal shined bright with the reflection of the sun off its barrel. It was his Marlin. It was the first gun he had ever bought, he told me. He had paid $100 and 40 lbs of deer pelts to the town gunsmith back in Alaska when he was fourteen. The wood was dark and smooth from the decades of use it had been through. I could only imagine how many bullets had been put through it and the stories that were sunk deep into its grain.

“You ever shot a gun before?” he asked me.

“Just a BB gun. My dad used to set up old tin cans, and I'd shoot them in the backyard.” I paused, thinking to myself, not wanting to share why I wasn’t allowed to shoot anymore.

He looked at me with a smile and said, “Well that’s a start, ain't it.” He finished cleaning his rifle and put it on a large towel sitting on the couch next to the table. He picked up a slightly smaller rifle from the table and looked it over.

“Do you know what this is, Tommy?” he asked me.

“It’s a deer rifle,” I replied.

“Not bad, Tommy boy,” he said. “This was your dad’s first gun. I bought it for him when he turned thirteen.” He handed me the rifle, and I looked it over. The wood was matte, and the barrel had slight signs of rust on it. **REMINGTON ARMS MANUFACTURING CO.** was emboldened on the side of the barrel, with the numbers .270 following it. In the stock of the gun were little tally marks that had been carved into it long ago. I asked Grandpa what they meant.

“That’s how many deer and elk he killed with that.” There must have been fifty marks carved into the stock. Grandpa handed me a rag and the gun oil and asked if I knew how to handle and clean a gun. I shook my head. He told me to make sure the safety was on, the magazine was empty, and that the chamber was too. Before long, I had taken the bolt out of the gun and was pulling the bore snake through,Pulling out years’ worth of hunting seasons’ carbon buildup

We had the guns clean and were out the door with a box of shells for each of us, a stack of papers that had hand-drawn bullseyes, tin cans, and a dented metal plate that looked like it had taken shots all the way back at Lexington and Concord. The walk to the barn made the world feel alive. The trees swayed with a gentle breeze, birds fluttered above our heads, and insects raced around us. Grandpa had unslung both guns from his shoulders and laid them up against a fallen tree opposite the clearing we were shooting into. I set up the targets and walked back to where Grandpa was standing. He wanted to teach me basic safety before we began.

He said, “Rule number one: treat every gun like it's loaded. Rule number two: keep your finger off the trigger until you're ready to shoot. Rule number three: be sure of what your target is and what's behind it. The fourth and most important rule,” he told me, “never point a gun at something you're not willing to destroy, Tommy. No matter what it is, if you point your muzzle at it, you need to be sure you're willing to destroy whatever stands on the other end of your weapon.”

Hearing him say this made me feel uneasy, but I knew he did this to make sure we were safe. I think about it now, and I’m confident he was preparing me for what really goes on here—the things that live in these pines. After his lesson, he grabbed my dad’s rifle and loaded one bullet into the gun before handing it to me. He stood behind me, showing me how to hold the rifle.

“Tuck it tight into your shoulder. Don’t fight it, just breathe and squeeze. Let the shot surprise you.”

The first shot of the gun ripped through the quiet of the morning and echoed back through the valley. The tin can flew from the post, rolling in the grass once the bullet collided with it. The recoil dug deep into my shoulder, rocking me back a little. The smell of gun smoke filled the air around me. It would become a smell I would be familiar with for the rest of my life.

“Good shot,” Grandpa said as he readjusted my stance. “Most kids jerk the trigger or get scoped the first time they shoot, so you're already leagues above most.”

“I guess I got it from you,” I said, looking back at the old man. He took the gun from my hand and pulled the bolt back, ejecting the shell and sending it flying in the air. When it finally landed, he picked it up and gave it to me as a souvenir of the occasion. He pulled out the magazine and handed it to me, telling me to load it and load another shell into the chamber.

We did this for the next hour or two, taking turns shooting at the targets. Every time we fired, birds would fly from the trees in masses, chirping or squawking at us for interrupting their peace with gunfire. We took a break, sitting on a log and eating ham and cheese sandwiches that had been warmed by the sun, making the cheese stick to the plastic bag as we pulled them out. He pulled out his canteen of water and passed it to me.

“You know, back when your dad was a little longer than you, that rifle used to buck him something nasty, but after a year or two he got real good at shooting. Used to stalk Bighorn sheep and shoot them from 300 yards away. Never got as good as me though,” he said with a smile and wink. I laughed as Grandpa walked to put up another target.

Something out of the corner of my eye grabbed my attention—a white flash in the trees. It was close enough that I should have been able to hear it from where I was sitting. The sight jolted me out of this moment with Grandpa, a moment that would now be forever blemished.

“Grandpa, I think there’s something close to us, right over there in the trees.” I tried to hide the fear in my voice, but I don’t think I did much of a convincing job.

He walked back over to where we were sitting and grabbed his rifle. He scanned the woodline, looking for anything that seemed out of the ordinary. After a while, he looked down at me and said, “Probably a deer or a coyote, Tommy. They usually wander down from the mountain when they hear shooting. Nothing to get knotted up about.” He said it with that same reassuring smile, but his eyes didn’t match what his face was trying to say.

“Grandpa, I don't think it was,” I said.

He looked back at me. “You just a bit tuned up from the shooting, boy,” he said calmly, walking back to the tree where all our stuff was laid out. As he walked, I saw him pull a shell out of his pocket and slide it into the loading gate.

The rest of the day passed quietly. We gathered kindling and talked the afternoon away, walking through the property, even still feeling that a tension was present just out of sight. Evening came with a golden hue and soft light. The mountains obstructed the pink sky behind them. We fed the fire the kindling we had gathered earlier that day. Grandpa laid two large pieces of trout on top of the grate over the fire while I sat near him, playing with the shell from earlier.

After we ate, we sat on the steps of the porch, taking in the sky on the last night of my stay. As we watched the fireflies make the fields glow, Grandpa broke the silence.

“You did good today, Tommy. Most boys your age would’ve bitched about the work or been glued to their phone, but not you. You're the last of a dying breed. You belong out here, grandson.”

“Thanks,” I said. “I just wish I could stay here with you longer.” I told him, carrying what felt like all the sadness ever known to man in those words.

“You’ll come back, boy, and I’ll be waiting when you do, and so will the woods.” I looked at him and nodded, sitting on the old man’s words. For a while, we stayed there, listening to the river rolling just a short way from the cabin, the quiet whisper of the pines rolling through the acres.

Somewhere deep into the sea of trees, there was a sound so unnatural it didn’t belong here—not only on this land, but in this plain of being. It wasn’t what you’d consider a voice, but not just the wind passing through. It was like the forest itself took a long exhale through gritted teeth. I turned, hoping to spot the origin of the sound, but I never did. Grandpa sat unfazed by what I thought I had heard. He stared straight ahead, watching the fire dance in the small pit bordered with old red bricks that were new before my dad was born.

He took a breath and softly said, “Don’t listen too closely, Tommy, especially at night. The woods will talk to you till you turn grey.”

I thought he just meant they’d talk to you until you got old, but now, sitting here with this gash, I know what he was trying to tell me.

When we walked in and went to bed, I lay awake staring at the ceiling, thinking about those old legends Grandpa was talking about before slipping off into the warm goodnight. That night, I dreamed of cedars and oaks stretching for miles in the sky and swaying until they seemed like they would snap. I blinked, and there I was, standing in the front lawn of the cabin, staring at the ridge. Even from a distance, I could see multiple figures standing on the ridge, watching me.

I woke the next morning, the sun sending slivers of light through the curtains. I sat up in bed and looked out the corner of the window where the woodline was. Something about the woods this early made me feel tense. I walked into the kitchen, where Grandpa stood by the stove, cooking bacon and eggs in a cast iron pan. The woodstove popped and creaked softly, almost trying not to disturb the peace of the morning.

“Morning, buddy,” he said, not turning away from what he was doing. “Last breakfast before you gotta head back home.”

I sat at the table, rubbing the last little bit of sleep from my eyes. “I wish I didn't have to, Grandpa. This place is heaven on earth.”

Grandpa looked at me, smiling. “I know, buddy, but your dad would be pissed if I kept you here any longer.” He gave me a plate stacked with food that smelled like a professional chef had made it in one of those fancy kitchens in Paris.

“Eat all you want, we got a long drive ahead.”

We ate in silence. Only the clink of silverware, the crackle of the fire, and Grandpa sipping his coffee broke the silence. It felt like it echoed off the cabin walls. We went about the normal chores for the day, which, I happily admit, took longer than usual. The day felt still, absent of the singing of birds that became an orchestra most mornings. Grandpa never said anything, but every now and then I would catch him glancing toward the woodline or the ridge.

By the time the sun was directly overhead, my bags were packed in the bed of his truck. I was walking to the truck, where Grandpa was standing, smoking a cigar. He looked up and asked, “You ready?”

“No, but I don't think I get much say in this.”

Grandpa put his cigar out against the bottom of his boot as he chuckled. “Unfortunately, no.”

He started walking to the cabin and told me to follow him inside and wait at the table. I did as I was told and sat down, waiting for him to come back. When he returned, he had a black bolt-action rifle in his hand. He gave it to me before sitting down. I studied the rifle, looking over all of its details. The rifle wasn’t new, but I could tell it hadn't been used much, if at all. There was a picture of an Indian with a large headdress on the bottom where the grip met the stock. The barrel read **“Savage Arms Axis .30-06 Springfield.”** The sling was made out of brown leather and had a painted picture of a deer staring at a mountain.

“That thing will bring down anything you put your crosshairs on,” Grandpa said.

I couldn't contain how happy and grateful I was. I stood up and wrapped my arms around the old man, and he did the same.

“I’ll keep it safe until you get back, but it’s your responsibility to keep it clean and maintained.” He grabbed it and went to put it back into the safe in his room. When he came back, we walked to the truck and started the drive back toward civilization.The dirt driveway wound like a dead snake — the road laid over it like a careless coffin. I rolled the window down and smelled the pines and river water fill the cab, taking it all in for one last time before I left.

When we got halfway down the driveway, there was a patch in the forest that had been cleared out, I assumed when Grandpa first got here—maybe for logs or just a walking path so he and Grandma could go on picnics. When we got to the small gap in the woodline, I could see the mountains, and for just a second, a fraction of a heartbeat, something on the ridge moved into the woodline. I must have gasped or moved in my seat just enough to catch his attention.

“Everything okay over there, Tommy boy?” he asked, his eyes on the road.

“Yeah, it was just… I thought I saw something.”

“Probably just some cabin fever, buddy. You can only spend so much time with this old man before you go stir crazy.” I nodded but didn't answer.

As we reached the gate, Grandpa hopped out of the truck to unlock it. He walked back, rolled the truck past the gate, and hopped back out to lock it. The chains clicked and slid back around the gate posts. I could see Grandpa glancing into the trees, scanning for something or someone. A strong gust of wind blew off Grandpa's hat onto the ground as he walked back to the truck. He turned around and bent over to pick the hat up—and that’s when I saw the handgun tucked into the back of his jeans.

He came back, shifted the truck into drive, and said, “Back when I was your age in Alaska, I’d walk a half mile into the woods before first light. On those walks, I’d feel like there were more eyes in the trees than stars in the sky. When the sun would rise just enough, I thought I would see shapes where there weren’t any. I think nature has a way of messing with a person’s mind, especially when they're young.”

I smiled faintly. “I guess it got me a little bit too.”

“Just means that you're paying attention to what’s around you, and that’s a good thing, Tommy. Not paying attention could be the difference between a good hunt and going hungry, or making a hike and getting lost on a back fort. Never let the woods scare you. Fear only makes the woods—or whatever is in there—meaner.”

We rode the rest of the way in silence. When we got to the airport, he helped carry the bags to the doors and set them at my feet.

“Take good care of your parents, boy, and say hi to your dad for me. Tell him thank you for letting you come out here.” I nodded, hugging him. The smell of smoke and pine seeped into the fabric of his jacket.

As I walked back to the terminal doors, I waved goodbye one last time. Grandpa got back in the truck and waved back as he drove off. I was almost inside the doors when a breeze came from behind me, and for just a second, I could’ve sworn I heard someone calling my name.

The context is the dogs been barking at a stray kitten that lives in our yard. It's parents try to get it out but the kitten won't leave and we can't catch it 

Everyday. Every morning. Every night. If the dogs outside. She barks at the cat. She's been doing it for like a week and my mom was having a rough time

It's like 5 or 6 am. The sun's been up like twenty minutes and she's making coffee. The dog. That she let out is outside. You know that like suffocating energy someone gives off when they're mad ? That's what I'm hit with. I ask her what's wrong ? She tells me about the dog while stirring her coffee then huffs. She then throws open the door to the yard and runs out. Slamming it so hard I feel it through the concrete floor

Mind you I'm like all the way across the room. There is a whole table infront of me. I feel the wind of the door hit my face. Stuff falls off the counter. Yelling and slamming doors all bother me. She knows. Especially in the morning or when I've just woken up

Tonight I was telling her about how it scared me. How it upset me and I was upset by it. She then said a few things with this smile on her face

Then she turned to our dog and said "" I'm sorry Emma "" ... Emma. Our fucking dog. Who had no idea the door was slammed because the dog. Was outside. Far away from the door. I wanted to cry. Scream. Say anything. I just sat there silently. I then left as soon as possible 

Now I'm just here. Honestly trying not to cry because wow. The fuck do I even say to that ? I'm so done trying to express my feelings and emotions to her because I don't think it matters anymore to her

Do I believe our dog deserves an apology ? Yeah but like. I literally just explained why I was scared and upset. Was I expecting much ? Not really but this ???? What the fuck- I'm sorry for swearing alot I just can't say much else because I have no words

This city isn't just a destination; it's a living, breathing museum where every cobblestone street, piazza, and palazzo tells a story. If you're searching for **Florence, Italy attractions**, you've come to the right place. This guide will take you beyond the postcards to help you discover the masterpieces, hidden corners, and unforgettable experiences that make Florence one of the world's most captivating cities.

Let's dive into the essential attractions you simply cannot miss.

## The Unmissable Trinity: Florence's Big Three

If you only have a few days, these are the non-negotiable landmarks that define the Florence skyline and its artistic soul.

### ### 1. The Florence Cathedral (Il Duomo)
![The iconic red dome of the Florence Cathedral, or Duomo, dominating the city skyline.](florence-duomo-dome.jpg)

You simply can't miss it. The Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, with its magnificent terracotta-tiled dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi, is the heart of the city.

*   **What it is:** A breathtaking Gothic cathedral complex, including the Duomo, Giotto's Bell Tower, and the Baptistery.
*   **Why you must go:** Climbing the **Duomo's dome** is a rite of passage. The 463-step journey rewards you with an incredible close-up of the frescoes and a panoramic view of Florence's red-tiled roofs that will stay with you forever.
*   **Pro-Tip:** Book your ""Brunelleschi Pass"" online **weeks or even months in advance**. It includes the dome climb, cathedral entrance, bell tower, and Baptistery. Time slots are strictly enforced to manage crowds.

### ### 2. The Uffizi Gallery
![The grand, corridor-like halls of the Uffizi Gallery, lined with classical sculptures and Renaissance paintings.](uffizi-gallery-hall.jpg)

Home to the world's most important collection of Renaissance art, the Uffizi is a pilgrimage site for art lovers. It's one of the most famous **Florence, Italy attractions**, and for good reason.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=florence%20italy%20attractions)

*   **What it is:** A vast art museum housed in a 16th-century building, once the offices of the Medici family.
*   **Why you must go:** To see masterpieces like Botticelli's ""The Birth of Venus"" and ""Primavera,"" Leonardo da Vinci's ""Annunciation,"" and Michelangelo's ""Doni Tondo"" with your own eyes.
*   **Pro-Tip:** The queue can be brutal. Pre-book your ticket online for a specific time slot to use the ""skip-the-line"" entrance. Consider booking for first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon for a slightly less crowded experience.

### ### 3. The Galleria dell'Accademia (The David)
![Michelangelo's masterpiece, David, standing tall and powerful under the dome of the Galleria dell'Accademia.](michelangelo-david.jpg)

While the Uffizi holds a vast collection, the Galleria dell'Accademia has one undeniable star that draws millions of visitors each year.

*   **What it is:** A museum founded in 1784, originally to teach students at the Academy of Fine Arts.
*   **Why you must go:** To stand in awe of **Michelangelo's David**. Photos do not do it justice. The 17-foot-tall marble sculpture is a pinnacle of Renaissance art, capturing human perfection and strength.
*   **Pro-Tip:** Most visitors beeline straight for David. Take a moment to appreciate the other incredible works in the hall, particularly Michelangelo's unfinished ""Prisoners"" (or ""Slaves""), which seem to be fighting their way out of the marble.

## Palaces, Bridges, and Views: Beyond the Museums

Florence's magic extends far beyond its museum walls. These attractions offer architectural beauty, history, and stunning perspectives of the city.

### ### 4. Ponte Vecchio (Old Bridge)
Spanning the Arno River, the Ponte Vecchio is one of Europe's most photographed and iconic bridges.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=florence%20italy%20attractions)

*   **What it is:** A medieval stone bridge lined with shops, traditionally occupied by jewelers, art dealers, and souvenir sellers.
*   **Why you must go:** For the atmosphere. It's especially beautiful at sunset when the golden light reflects on the river.
*   **Pro-Tip:** To escape the crowds, walk onto the **Vasari Corridor**. This enclosed passageway above the bridge was built for the Medici family to travel between their palaces unseen. Access is usually via special, pre-booked tours (often combined with the Uffizi).

### ### 5. Piazzale Michelangelo
For that classic, sweeping postcard view of Florence, you must make the trek up to this terrace.

*   **What it is:** A large square and observation point on a hillside just south of the city center.
*   **Why you must go:** The **view is unparalleled**. It offers the perfect vantage point to see the entire Duomo complex, the Ponte Vecchio, and the red-roofed city nestled in the Tuscan hills.
*   **Pro-Tip:** It's a steep 20-25 minute walk up from the city center, but it's worth it. Go for sunrise to avoid the crowds and watch the city wake up in a soft, golden light. A bronze replica of David stands at the center of the piazza.

### ### 6. Palazzo Pitti & The Boboli Gardens
The vast, rugged palace of the Pitti family was later bought by the Medici and became the main residence of the ruling families of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.

*   **What it is:** A massive Renaissance palace that now houses several important museums and galleries.
*   **Why you must go:** To explore the **Boboli Gardens** behind the palace. This sprawling ""green lung"" of Florence is a masterpiece of landscape gardening, with fountains, grottoes, and hidden paths offering a peaceful escape from the city bustle.
*   **Pro-Tip:** Wear comfortable shoes! The gardens are vast and hilly. Pack some water and find a quiet spot on a bench to enjoy the views and relax like a Medici.

## Hidden Gems & Local Favorites

Venture slightly off the beaten path to discover a more intimate side of Florence.

> **Local's Tip:** Want to eat like a local? Avoid the tourist traps around the Duomo. Head to the Santo Spirito neighborhood in the Oltrarno district for authentic trattorias and a lively, less-touristy vibe.

### ### 7. Basilica of Santo Spirito
While tourists crowd the main churches, locals often prefer the serene beauty of this Brunelleschi-designed church in the Oltrarno.

*   **What it is:** A Renaissance church known for its simple, harmonious interior and a wooden crucifix said to be sculpted by a young Michelangelo.
*   **Why you must go:** For the authentic atmosphere. The piazza in front of the church is a vibrant hub for locals, with a daily food market and fantastic cafes.
*   **Pro-Tip:** Visit on a weekday morning to see the piazza come alive with the market. Enjoy a coffee and pastry at one of the bars and just watch the local life unfold.

### ### 8. San Lorenzo Market (Mercato Centrale)
To truly experience Florentine life, you have to dive into its food culture.

*   **What it is:** A two-part market. The **ground floor** is a bustling traditional market with stalls selling fresh produce, meat, cheese, and pasta. The **top floor** is a modern, gourmet food hall with dozens of vendors selling everything from fresh pasta and pizza to lampredotto sandwiches and gelato.
*   **Why you must go:** For a feast for the senses. It's the best place in the city to sample a wide variety of high-quality, authentic Tuscan foods all in one place.
*   **Pro-Tip:** Go for lunch at the upstairs food hall. Grab a *porchetta* sandwich and a glass of Chianti, then save room for gelato!

## Planning Your Trip: Essential Tips for Visiting Florence

*   **Book Everything in Advance:** For the Duomo, Uffizi, and Accademia, this is not a suggestion; it's a requirement. You will save hours of your vacation.
*   **Walk Everywhere:** Florence's historic center is compact and best explored on foot. Wear comfortable shoes—you'll be doing a lot of it!
*   **Get the Firenze Card:** If you plan on visiting many museums and attractions, this card can offer value. It includes entry to over 70 sites and uses a digital reservation system for some top attractions. Calculate if it's worth it based on your itinerary.
*   **Stay Hydrated:** Look for the *fontanelle*—public water fountains scattered throughout the city. The water is clean, cold, and free.

Florence is more than just a list of sights; it's an experience. It's the feeling of rounding a corner and seeing the Duomo for the first time, the taste of a perfect bistecca alla fiorentina, and the satisfaction of knowing you're walking in the footsteps of giants.

1ou0bwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/1ou0bwf/wholesome_the_ctad_clinic_helped_me_bring_peace/,Wholesome: The CTAD Clinic helped me bring peace to husband’s alters,"Many of you might know my story from previous posts. I have had a rough 10 days dealing with my husband’s DID system. From husband’s pushback and denial to “them” breaking rules to my husband competing with one of the alters (Vince) to our little becoming a teenager and wanting to drive and get a girlfriend (husband is 38). From constant switchings and dealing with my husband’s stress due to “teleporting” and loosing time to Vince secretly keeping on buying drugs while we thought husband was sober (imagine the disappointment). While they all absolutely loved me and novel like romance and interactions (I had 2 lovers in the system plus husband who would get left out because I would get drained), it came with a lot of stress, anxiety and exhaustion. 

When things started getting Chaotic, I hopped back in Reddit because there was no where else to go. someone here told me to look into the CTAD clinic. Or maybe they told someone else and I saw it. Who ever it was, “THANK YOU🙏🏽💕”. I started bing watching it.  I had to relearn all I had forgotten. In one of them, there was talk about “safety”. To ask an alter; “if you didn’t have to keep the system safe, what would you want to do?”. The concept stayed with me and it is what helped with absolute chaos last night (will explain a bit) and today, while I was exhausted from last night’s madness and today’s workday plus looking for therapists, the magic happened. 

I have to give you back story so you understand how the “safety” thing worked. Within this 10 days I have been trying to make Henry and Vince understand they are safe and B is safe. But o didn’t have access to Charlie to tell him that. And they would not inform Charlie because he had made rules for no one to come. Because every time anyone would come, B’s already 10/10 pain used to magnify.

Here we go:
Last night I prematurely informed reddit that all became good. My husband fall asleep on my lap and i was hearing them talking. Henry (teenager and the protector in training) ran out terrified. Saying Charlie found out him and Vince have been coming and was extremely mad. Vince took over. Said charlie was right and owned up to his mistakes and decided to give up smoking for the greater good. Very romantic, very self sacrificing, very mature. Not the 22 yo lier i first met. He said he will go and face Charlie and apologize (the previous gatekeeper but then the he became protector and internal adviser, a Marine) and make everything good. He apologized for everything, told me he will always love me, then he put B where they found him(on my lap, per Charlie’s orders) and he left. I woke husband off and explained. He was so happy Charlie was back and in charge. We semi celebrated but I cried my eyes out as I had love and history and relationships with each of them. B calms me down, tells me I have to write a novel because whatever I have explained sounded more like a romance, drama, action movie than reality. He tells me to wind down while he plays games. 

I sit on the stairs responding to one of the comments. About how Vince decided to give up smoking and he will no longer front, etc. suddenly I get a call from B “GET YOUR @$$ DOWN TO THE KITCHEN NOW”. I peak down and I see Charlie in full combat Marine attire. Shoes included! Standing tall. Telling me “WHY DID YOU LET HIM DO DRUGS” he was alluding to me letting Vince to get his last joint (which found out was two) and start tapering off. This was before Vince decided to suddenly quit.  He was talking loud and strict. About the enemy. About how they (H and V) broke the rules by coming. In his toughness his eyes would get wet and say he missed me. That they have a duty to B but I am the most important thing to him, to them. He was constantly talking about the enemy, the pain, the nightmares B would have. He had fired Vince and thrown him in a dungeon/time out and put Kenny (45 with a personality) and Rebecca (dunno how old but bipolar) to watch Vince. Charlie was yelling “do you know how hard i have tried? I have not closed my eyes a bit to protect you and B” i had to put our Chaplin (Gramm) to do Vinces work but he is not trained, and he would go on and on. I was calm. I would hug him and he would soften a bit. He cried because Grace (54 maternal classy lady) had gone. She had told Charlie “it is time for you to be the gentle one”. But he said “what does it even mean?” While tearing up. Charlie thought it was Vinces fault that Grace had left. I suddenly remembered “safety”. I started calming him down. Telling him how Vince spoke highly of Charlie. That Vince advised me to throw the pregabalin away and keep B away from it. Charlie couldn’t believe that. Just like B never trusted Vince. Took me 2 hours but i finally got through to him. I told him I found a way for B not to be in pain. That everyone is safe. That B is safe. The moment Charlie was assured about no pain (which meant safety), it was like water on fire. He informed others to let Vince out. That he has been a foolish leader and has been so hard on Henry and Vince. I go to the bathroom and come out happy seeing charlie taken out his top dashing out. I run after him. Vince was back. MAD AS HELL. For him it had been two years that he was in time out. I couldn’t stop him smoke. I was mad. I felt i was betrayed. That B and charlie were correct and vince was just tricking me. As I turned my back to leave, I remembered “safety”. And from another video on CTAD the words “compassion, empathy and patience” just came to my mind. I started talking to him. Explaining how Charlie never felt safe and that I finally got through to him. Long talks that were going no where because of how mad vince was. Suddenly water sprinklers come one and due to the immense levels of stress i was under (i am not mentioning all the things) i got so scared that i almost fell. Grabbed on to the wall and bent over feeling extremely weak. With a shaking voice i said “I can’t Vince. I can’t. I trusted you. I still do. This is a miss understanding, you think Henry let you out but it was Charlie who gave the order. He knows the fight is over. He is calm. I can’t do this anymore today. I need help. I need a break”. Vince tells me “I told you i am a POS. But i love you please don’t cry” i look up and I see his face twitching in terror. It was B. He recently twitches when this happens due to all the stress. Horrified. He said “what is this in my hand? Have i been out for 3 days” i said no. Come in. I will explain. I explain what went on. He is high so he is laughing and saying, man is it like this for everyone with DID? I said “kinda… everyone’s got a different story”… he says “they all misunderstood each other. They all had good intentions but they missed each other by a hair. If they were all in the same room, this would not have happened. Misunderstanding lead to broken trust. Broken trust lead to chaos “.  He said he will focus on getting better because that is what Charlie wanted (he still doesn’t completely accept or believe but is going with it). I felt stupid to have mentioned all was ok to Reddit people prematurely. I came back on and asked for therapy styles because husband agreed if he could not get stable in the next few days, to go to therapy because of how much “I” was personally suffering. He would be gone and I had to deal with the madness.

Today started calm. I was so drained. Zero energy. After workday got over, B came to lay by me and I started hearing them again. But for the first time, there was no fight. Just wanting to come and inform me all is good.
Vince wakes up. Tells me Charlie has taken his military clothes off. That last night when he went back, they all talked. That they are friends again!!!!! That peace has been made (and so much more but my hand is starting to hurt). Then he says Charlie wants to talk to you and i say ok. He tells me again he loves me and will miss me but all is good. Charlie comes. Tells me he let Kenny and Rebecca and Gramm go. They are no longer needed and are free. Told me to make sure B is doing the right things to stay healthy. That they won’t come anymore so we have some resemblance of peace. I said but you can if it doesn’t interfere with B’s life. In a calm setting like home or when generally critical things are not going on. But he said he has to first try and talk to B (but he may not be able to). Will skip the romantic talks and looks and actions. Then he says Henry wants to talk but make sure he leaves B where we found him. Henry comes. All excited. Telling me how they are no longer fighting. About what happened last night in the back but then everyone became friends again. He wanted me to know he loves me and misses me. And for me not to be sad that I couldn’t take him driving, etc. that he will do it back there (my poor child😭😭😭😭😭😭) even he is sacrificing. He said their only job now is to make sure B is doing ok. No one seems to have roles anymore although Charlie is still referred to as a leader but no one has jobs. They are just close friends/brothers and are talking peacefully. Henry said Vince doesn’t tell him to shut up anymore. And today he was dressed up like a dad!!!!!! I said what do you mean and he said… well he always wore baggy clothes but this morning he had slacks on and a button up shirt and was even drinking coffee!!!!! (Coffee?!!!  He didn’t like coffee, he liked hot chocolate!!!!!)
Anyhow, i had henry put his head on my chest and caressed him. He giggled and said… I love you mommy. And left. And B woke up.


I used the word “safe” a lot in my conversations with all of them. A LOT. I tried to make them see the other is not an enemy. Would tell them how the other person thought highly of them (they were not aware and thought others would feel they are stupid or something). So would reiterate the good things. I would even tell them B thinks highly of them and it would make their eyes glow and would tell B how others want to protect him and his heart would soften.

I don’t know how long this peace will last but i know CTAD helped me through this and got us to a bit of stability. All those words would be on replay in my head in my darkest times. constantly making everyone feel safe (while I myself was in shambles), showing them how i loved all of them, showing them how they love each other but are misunderstanding each other, remaining patient when I would feel like running away (not gonna lie, there were times i felt i want to just become dust and exit life when i would look at sunsets), having empathy when I would get disappointed or felt betrayed and having compassion when I would get tired of constantly consoling everyone without having anyone to console me and having all of those on mind when B wouldn’t believe me or would not cooperate or would push back, resulted in magic. Even if it is short lived, it is magic.

I hope my story will help you (and maybe future me) navigate through times. There is light at the end of the tunnel. And while ai am not sure how long this peace will last, the memory of the sweetness of a mini win, will keep me going.

I love you all. Thank you for your support. From the time i had my first post here in 2023 (gosh I was such an ignorant idiot! A few hyper understanding people realized I was misguided by Hollywood and saved me) till you sharing your experiences with me and sitting in the mud with me, you have been my only outlet. My only support system. My friends. Each one of you helped move the needle to where i am confident i can navigate the hardships.

Thank you all💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕


P. S: There are now only 3 alters remaining. And everyone seems to be very confident and at peace. B used to have up to 27 alters per Vince in his worst of time. I knew only of Vince, Charlie, Grace, Henry (first ones to meet and i met them multiple times), Kenny and Caspian (no one saw caspian in the headspace. He appeared because B felt betrayed by me in a game of pool and lasted 30 mins and never came back.) and i met each only once. Rebecca and Gramm that I never met and only heard of and the others whom i do not know. 
I am not sure if Grace disappearing and telling Charlie “it is now time for YOU to be the gentle one” is good or bad. I don’t know if only 3 remaining is good or bad. I don’t know if them saying no one is responsible for gatekeeping and they no longer need roles and can just talk with each other and come to agreement is good or bad. I don’t know if all agreeing that it is best for everyone not to come (or come very infrequently) is good or bad. I just don’t know. But on the surface, it seems ok, for now that is:)",5,1762835938.0,DID,1,0.86,False

I couldn’t hold it and had to wrap a dish towel around it to take it out. Now there’s some little tiny shiny dots on the inside and I’m wondering if it’s still food safe. A few mins later and it’s still burning hot. There’s tiny tiny tiny lines that I’m not sure are cracks or if they were there before bc I didn’t inspect it this thoroughly before. The little dots now look like they are burned and solidified. Is it coffee residue? I’m not sure what happened, and oddly the mug smells like burnt marshmallows which I’m not sure if that’s the mug or some residue from our microwave. Has this happened to anyone before?

Occupancy rate isn’t *just* about pricing or location anymore. It’s mostly about **how clearly guests can imagine themselves in your space**.

Here are some things that actually move the needle: 👇

**1. Make your listing feel** ***real***  
Guests hesitate when photos look too edited or confusing. The more they can visualize the layout, the faster they book.  
Some hosts are now using **3D walkthroughs or 360° tours** — almost like a mini VR experience — so guests can explore the property online before booking.  
That transparency builds massive trust.

**2. Simplify and highlight key features**  
If your space has a view, cozy lighting, or unique decor — make sure it’s front and center in your media gallery.  
People make decisions emotionally, not logically.

**3. Add a personal touch**  
A short note in your listing like “This space is designed for slow mornings and coffee lovers” makes it feel intentional.  
That emotional connection = higher chance of booking.

**4. Leverage social proof**  
Cross-post your Airbnb link or a personal website on social media.  
Even a small microsite that shows your property beautifully can drive direct traffic and boost your visibility.

**5. Ask for reviews right after a great experience**  
Guests forget fast — a friendly message post-stay can bring in reviews that boost your ranking organically.

  
If you’re curious about the 3D walkthrough idea, here’s a sample I built recently:

It's become a familiar pattern in some corners of the new Syria in recent months, as the country's fragile unity is eroded by revenge attacks and sectarian killings.

> The main targets are Alawites, the sect of the ousted Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.

I've been researching dual boiler machines to upgrade to from my old fb marketplace Rancilio Silvia, and I've narrowed it down to these two. I'm wondering if anyone has owned either of these machines or has input on which has the edge? I make 2-4 drinks a day (half with steamed milk) and would like a machine that can make lots of drinks back to back for hosting.

I love the looks of the all black Ride on clive coffee, and the build quality seems ever so slightly better (or at least the internals look easier to understand), but the main drawback is the vibe pump. I've heard the pump on the Ride is considerably quieter than other vibration pumps and I don't have any immediate plans to plumb my machine, but if it's anywhere as loud as my Silvia it might be a problem :).

Also, I am in the US so both machines are essentially the same price for me :(.",1,1762835251.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1ou03u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ou03u5/verses_origins_ch_40/,Verses Origins Ch 40,"Chapter 40: New Trails

It had been four days since the fireworks lit up the sky, since laughter turned to silence and Celia's smile faded into something he hadn't seen before—hurt. Ren hadn't responded to the crew's messages. He just… didn't have it in him.

Ren walked the quiet back streets of the city now, where the neon signs were dim and the vending machines hummed in place of conversation. The breeze carried the faint scent of burnt oil and old rain. His hoodie was pulled low over his head, and his steps echoed slightly on the damp concrete.

He turned a corner—and stopped.

There, leaning against a rusted metal railing that overlooked the drainage canal, stood a man in a crumpled brown trench coat. His collar was up. His hair was a mess of saltand-pepper strands. One hand held a cigarette. The other held a flask.

His badge still hung from his belt. Barely visible. But still there.

Ren recognized him instantly.

Detective Nakamura.

The same man who had stormed into his hospital room the night his world collapsed. Who had thrown cold questions at him while the IV was still in his arm and the blood hadn't dried on his bandages. Who didn't believe a word about monsters, just kept asking if Ren was high, or if someone had really broken in, or if he'd killed his parents himself in some fugue state.

Back then, Ren had been too shocked to cry. Too broken to fight back.

Now?

Now he just froze.

Nakamura glanced at him. His eyes were bloodshot, his jaw unshaven. There was a tiredness in his face that no sleep would fix.

""Took a shot in the dark,"" the man said, voice low and rough. ""Didn't expect you to actually come this way. Lucky me."" Ren didn't reply.

The detective exhaled smoke, slow. ""You remember me.""

Ren's fingers curled at his sides. ""Yeah.""

""Good."" Nakamura took a pull from the flask, winced, then looked up at the overcast sky. ""Would've felt worse if you forgot. I was… a bit of an asshole that night.""

Ren's jaw clenched. ""You think?""

Nakamura gave a bitter chuckle. ""Yeah. I do.""

He paused. Something heavy shifted in his shoulders, like a man trying to put his own weight down for just a second.

""My wife's dead,"" he said, eyes fixed somewhere past the skyline, where the sun was bleeding into the clouds. ""So's my eldest.""

He took a swig from his flask and grimaced.

""I came home to find the house leveled. Like it had imploded inward. Walls crushed. Roof caved in. Like something huge passed through, but left no trace. No footprints. No witnesses. Just rubble… and them, underneath it."" His voice dropped, hoarse and hollow.

""Two months ago. Right after the school year started. No press. No headlines. I was told to process it quietly. That the higher-ups were already handling it. I got a condolence letter and a gag order on the same damn day. Quiet funeral. I buried them myself."" Ren felt something twist deep inside him. A cold, leaden knot in his stomach.

""I've got one son left,"" Nakamura continued, his voice quieter now. ""Kaito. He disappeared the day before that. Just one day before. No note. No messages. No goodbye. Just… gone.""

His lips curled bitterly.

""And I used to think maybe he ran off. That maybe he was ashamed of something. But now?""

He looked at Ren fully, his eyes hollow and aching.

""I think whatever took my family... got him first.""

Ren stayed still. The air between them felt paper-thin.

""I started digging after the funerals,"" Nakamura muttered. ""Pulling strings. Following rumors. Started seeing holes in places I shouldn't be looking. My old division—Special Crimes—they've logged stuff. Weird bodies. Missing kids. Impossible signs. I know it's monsters. Same as you said that night."" He paused.

""And I know I didn't believe you then. You were bloodied, half-conscious, and rambling about seeing stuff that shouldn't exist. I thought you were in shock. But I know better now.""

Nakamura stepped closer, breath sharp with whiskey and grief.

""After your sensei—Yujiro—pulled you from the investigation, I kept tabs. Put a quiet tracker on your file. Figured you were my only lead, even if I didn't know to what."" He let out a harsh breath. ""That man's got more enemies than the Tokyo mob and more reach than any of them. I got stonewalled. But now?"" His voice cracked. The words almost broke apart.

""Now I'm just a father. Who buried half his family. Who let his son walk out that door. And I need you to tell me what happened to Kaito.""

Ren looked down. His fists were clenched. His whole body was shaking.

""I—"" He swallowed. ""I don't know how to say it.""

""Then don't say it right,"" Nakamura said, stepping even closer. ""Just say it. Please.""

His voice faltered. The cigarette dropped from his fingers and hissed on the wet pavement.

""I need to know.""

Ren felt it all crash into him at once.

The weight. The memories. The screaming. The blood.

He looked at the broken man in front of him, and for once, saw not the badge. Not the interrogator. But a father. A grieving father who hadn't been there when it mattered most.

Ren's voice came low and hoarse.

""Kaito turned.""

Nakamura stiffened.

""I don't know how,"" Ren said. ""But he wasn't human anymore. Not when I saw him."" He looked the man in the eyes.

""He killed two of his bullies. Yuto and Daichi. Beat them until there was nothing left. He even killed his own homeroom teacher. Then…"" His throat went tight. ""Then your wife. And your son.""

Nakamura staggered like he'd been struck.

""I didn't know until it was too late,"" Ren continued, his voice cracking. ""He had transparent skin, wet hair, hollow eyes. He said it was because... because they all ignored him, he was bullied to the place he was."" Silence. Then Ren added, brokenly:

""He said you never listened. That nobody did.""

Nakamura crumpled back against the railing, staring at the canal with wide, hollow eyes.

""I thought he was just being dramatic,"" he whispered. ""Thought it was teen angst. He was always sensitive, but I figured he'd grow out of it. God. I never even asked what was wrong when he came home with bruises. I just told him to toughen up.""

His fingers trembled, reaching to his eyes like he could stop the tears before they fell. But they came anyway—raw, sudden, unstoppable. ""I failed him,"" Nakamura breathed. ""I failed all of them.""

Ren stepped back, chest tight. ""I didn't listen to him either and then I killed him,"" he said. ""When I saw him... knowing that he killed my parents—I lost it. I wasn't thinking. I just wanted it to stop.""

He looked down at his hands.

""I didn't even know how I did it. Some... energy. Some power. It came out of me like it wasn't mine.""

The detective didn't move for a long moment.

Then he looked at Ren. Really looked at him.

""I believe you.""

Ren blinked.

""I believe every word,"" Nakamura said quietly. ""Because I saw what was left. And you don't fake that kind of carnage."" He straightened up, slow and tired.

""I won't report this,"" he said.

Ren stared, stunned.

""You're still a kid,"" Nakamura said. ""Still figuring yourself out. Don't let this rot you."" Ren swallowed hard.

""I'm sorry,"" he whispered. ""About your family."" Nakamura gave a dry, humorless smile.

""So am I.""

Nakamura's voice faded with his steps, the sound of his shoes swallowed by the city's dusk and shadows. His trench coat caught the wind one last time before he vanished into the alley's depths—less a detective now, more a ghost chasing the memory of what he'd lost.

Ren stood frozen on the street, a sick churn in his stomach and fire behind his eyes. The air tasted like rust and regret. And no matter how much he inhaled, he couldn't shake the feeling that everything still hung in limbo.

He had told the truth. Finally.

And still, it wasn't enough.

Later That Night

The city gave way to the dark edges of the forest path where the ship was.

Ren crept up the familiar gangplank, boots quiet against the metal floor. Lights were dim inside. A low hum of sleeping machinery pulsed beneath his feet.

He moved carefully, past the sleeping quarters, past the lounge where empty tea mugs still sat beside half-folded blankets. He avoided the mess. Avoided the soft snoring coming from Andre's bunk.

And finally, he reached the lab.

It smelled like metal, faint ozone, and jasmine oil—the familiar signature of Jingli's latenight work. And coffee. Always coffee. A porcelain mug, pale lavender with a small golden handle, sat beside her keyboard, half-steaming as usual. She sipped from it slowly, the room lit by the ghostly blue glow of monitors and floating data projections.

She didn't look up at first.

Seated at her usual corner, sleeves rolled to the elbow, she faced three translucent holo-screens suspended mid-air. Each flickered with movement—pulsing graphs, rotating essence diagrams, encrypted neural overlays. One showed a district map of Tokyo, its borders outlined in red with a pulsing heat signature tracked in real time.

""You're lucky I don't lock the door at night,"" she said quietly.

Ren hesitated, hand on the doorway frame. ""…I needed to check something."" Jingli gave a sigh that was all sharp edge and zero breath.

""I assume you're not here for a warm cup of tea and an apology bouquet.""

Ren offered the faintest half-smile. ""Wasn't sure you'd let me in if I brought flowers.""

She didn't return it. Instead, she waved one hand and spun the middle screen toward him. Data lines streamed across it—coded readouts of essence signatures, deep-scan visuals of twisted genetic patterns, the eerie fingerprint of what had once been Kaito.

""You asked about the foreign signature embedded in his transformation,"" Jingli said, finally glancing his way. Her violet eyes were cool, unreadable. ""We traced it. Took some triangulating with Bonk's surveillance feed. But it's pinpointed now."" Ren stepped closer.

The screen zoomed in.

A blinking red dot. Over a real-world map.

""Shibuya?"" he muttered.

""Shibuya Scramble Square,"" Jingli clarified. She took another sip of coffee, like it was just another equation she was solving. ""The essence signature is still live.""

Ren's jaw clenched.

A silence passed between them, the hum of data panels the only sound.

Then Ren looked up.

""Could I ask you not to tell the others?"" His voice was soft but steady. ""I want to do this myself.""

Jingli didn't respond right away.

She just looked at him She saw the fire behind his calm—the unshakable weight in his voice, the kind that she had seen before.

She just exhaled, almost to herself, and turned silently in her chair. Metal clinked as she rifled through one of the drawers behind her.

After a few seconds, she pulled out a thin, sleek wristband with a central node—a glimmering device shaped like a curved fragment of glass.

She tossed it to him without ceremony.

""Essence Tracker,"" she said. ""It'll sync to your signature once you activate it. Nonbearers use it for field tracking. You'll need it, since you still don't know how to use your own.""

Ren caught it cleanly, his fingers closing around the cool metal.

""Thanks, Miss Yue,"" he said quietly.

He slipped the band onto his wrist. It hummed once, glowing faintly blue, and clicked into place like it belonged there.

Jingli leaned back in her chair, crossing her legs. She took another long sip from her mug.

""Come back in one piece,"" she said with a smirk, setting the cup down. ""I'm not in the mood to mourn anyone right now.""

Ren gave a respectful nod.

Then he turned and walked out without another word, coat flaring slightly behind him. The door hissed shut.

And just like that, he was gone again—into the Tokyo night, toward the glittering skyline and the dark corners it refused to illuminate.

But this time, he wasn't running.

He was chasing it back.
