No NSFW right out of the gate either please.

Good morning/afternoon/evening/whenever this post may find you, and may it find you well! Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text.

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 25-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* Childfree (non-negotiable)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and made you want to reach out

  
If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?
4. Would you rather live in 24 hours of daylight or darkness?

I'm using the Breville Bambino Plus with a DF54.

Dose is 16.5g consistently.

Using the pre-programmed double shot, I get 12s pre-infusion and about 13s of extraction, for 42.5g yield. So total of 25s extraction time with \~1:2.5 ratio. Is this okay? Should I coarsen my grind size? Coffee taste is nice, for me. Not a connoisseur..

Quick note: I had shared something similar here recently but ended up deleting my account, so I lost all the chats and invites. Re-posting in case we missed each other 😊 And if you reached out on my previous post, feel free to re-invite or message again. I would love to reconnect.

I am in my 20s, working in IT by day, but when I’m not busy working, you will probably find me baking up a storm in the kitchen as there is just something about fresh bread or pastries that instantly makes life better.

I am pretty into sports (any), whether it’s a casual game or just staying active, and I genuinely enjoy long walks (great for clearing the head or having a good, deep conversation). When I am indoors, I’m usually watching movies or geeking out over architecture. Always happy to swap movie recommendations.

I am keen to meet new people who enjoy sports, gaming, chatting about architecture or careers, or simply having meaningful conversations over coffee or a walk. I am big on personal growth and becoming a better version of myself every day, so if that vibe resonates, feel free to reach out.

Happy to share pic once we’re chatting — I promise I won’t disappoint 😉

Looking forward to meeting some like minded people and seeing where the conversations go 🙂",1,1766019250.0,BrisbaneSocial,1,1.0,False

1ppdgqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ppdgqm/i_need_advice_on_my_cousin_roommate_who_now/,I need advice on my cousin (roommate) who now treats me awfully.,"For context, I am 20 years old (f) and she is 22 years old (f). We are cousins and didn’t get close until I was 15 and she was 17 when our grandma passed away. We lived in different states and we were so close that she would drive every other weekend to come spend the night at my house and hang out. We would talk everyday on the phone, do all kinds of fun stuff together and she was the person I talked to about everything. She moved to the state I live in for college and then did a year studying abroad during my freshman year. After she got back from studying abroad we decided to live together because we always talked about it when we were younger. Since living together I am fully regretting this decision because she now walks all over me and has an awful boyfriend that I’m tired of hearing about. Here are some of the things she’s done/ said to me. Recently we decided to do a gift exchange for Christmas and she told me she didn’t know what to get me so she told me she was going to get me this specific item that is around $40. After she told me that, I wanted to match the price so I got her something for $45 that she’s been saying she wants for a while. Gift exchange comes and she hands me this plastic cat toy that still has a $4.99 tag on it and is not the item she said she was going to get me. I don’t know if this is crappy of me but this honestly pissed me off. Another massive thing is she treats my boyfriend like crap and walks all over him as well when she has no reason to (it’s hard for him to say anything because she’s my family and he wants her to like him). She has gone out to eat with us, ordered the most expensive thing while he’s paying and then wasted the whole meal. We’ve gone out for coffee and she gets the most expensive thing every time he pays. One time he made a large purchase that he was extremely proud of and when he brought it over she said it was ugly and she didn’t like it and went back to her room. She has also made him feel bad for not going to school even though he works full time and pays all of his own bills just fine (she has never worked a day in her life at 22). There’s a long list of crappy stuff she has said to him but that’s too long to type out. Any time she and I make plans she flakes on me last minute to hang out with other people or stay on the phone with her boyfriend who makes her cry every other night and even made her cry on her birthday (they’re long distance). She is constantly breaking stuff in the apartment and then expecting me to pay for it (i have a job and pay for everything of my own and her parents send her $600 a month). Anytime I talk to her about an issue I’m having she completely disagrees with me and is a debby downer. She genuinely just acts like she hates me now and she has never expressed that I’ve done something to upset her. This last thing is the final straw and I don’t know what to do. So right now she is in her home state for winter break and I’m still at the apartment because I’m working. I texted her yesterday about an issue and she didn’t react well to it. This is the issue: My boyfriend texted my dad about a job opportunity from someone my dad knows. He basically just asked my dad about the details and my dad sent him a long text basically implying that my boyfriend doesn’t look professional (he has one visible tattoo on his arm), my boyfriend would actually need to show up on time to the job (my boyfriend has worked full time since he was 17) and he basically implied that he thinks my boyfriend would be a shitty employee (my dad is very overprotective of me and is rude to no matter who i date). Anyways, this extremely hurt my feelings and my boyfriend’s feelings and I texted my cousin about it. She replied with saying my dad is right and that my dad was just giving him sound advice. This is one out of many times she has disagreed with me just to disagree. This made me so upset and i sent her a text about how she constantly disagrees with me makes me feel like crap when im upset and she just never answered. Anyways I’m sick of her and I still have 6 months on the lease :(. Not sure how to deal with her at all especially because we are family. ",1,1766019199.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Tom pulled up in front of Ralph Dietz’s house and cut the engine.

Ralph had been a widower for more than ten years, ever since the death of his beloved wife, Mafalda—an old Italian name that meant strength. She had been exactly that to him. Mafalda was the mother of his two sons, the only woman he had ever known, ever since the afternoon they were sixteen years old, standing barefoot in her father’s field outside Catania, Sicily.

She was the light of his world.

Cancer took her slowly. Three hard years of fighting a demon that never tired. When she finally lost, Ralph lost too. What it left behind was a man hollowed out and lonely. He stopped socializing, pulled away from people, even from his own sons. They still spoke every day, but the conversations were strictly business—numbers, territory, collections. Anything else felt unnecessary to him.

He was disgusted by what he saw as their weakness, especially when it came to dealing with George Zap. In Ralph’s day, a man like Zap would’ve either paid up or watched his shop burn to the ground. No negotiations. No delays. Bobby and Johnny’s hesitation disappointed him, and Ralph never missed a chance to remind them of it.

The only person who still brought him genuine joy was his granddaughter, Annie.

Lisa brought her by a couple of times a week. Ralph would always slip her some cash, press it into her hand, and say, Buy her something nice. Something that’ll make her happy. Then he’d smile softly and say Annie reminded him of her grandmother.

Lisa had grown close to Ralph over the years. He was steady. Someone she could trust. He didn’t approve of the way Johnny had treated her, but he stayed out of it, saying it was between husband and wife. Still, his disapproval lingered unspoken in the room whenever Johnny’s name came up.

⸻

Lisa happened to be there that afternoon, Annie sitting cross-legged on the living room rug with her dolls, when the doorbell rang.

Lisa answered it.

Tom Hart stood on the porch, his face tight, his eyes carrying the kind of weight that didn’t need explaining. She stepped aside and let him in.

Ralph looked up from the couch, Annie beside him, and met Tom’s gaze.

Lisa led Annie into the kitchen, poured her a glass of milk, and set out a plate of cookies.

“Mommy and Grandpa need to talk grown-up talk with the man,” she said gently.

Annie smiled and dove into the cookies without a second thought.

Lisa returned to the living room.

“They booked Richie Libby for Johnny’s murder,” Tom said, direct and without softening it. “We picked him up at Louie Burro’s club. Earlier that morning, Rosemary Dole was found dead in her bed—a bullet to the head. Same as Johnny. While we were questioning Libby at the precinct, one of the officers found a hot gun in his car. Ballistics say it matches both killings.”

Ralph sat motionless on the couch, eyes fixed on the floor, his face carved from stone. He didn’t ask a question. He didn’t react. He wore the look of a man who didn’t care what happened next.

“The bitch ruined my marriage,” Lisa said bitterly. “She wrecked my family. Johnny liked whores, but he always came home—until she got inside his head. Good riddance.” Her voice shook, but the anger was pure and focused, all of it aimed at Rosemary.

Tom let the silence hang for a beat.

“I’ve gotta be honest,” he said finally. “Nothing about this sits right with me. Libby seemed genuinely surprised when we told him about Rosemary. She was his biggest earner. And he’s not stupid enough to leave a murder weapon sitting in his car like a gift-wrapped confession.”

Ralph didn’t look up.

“But the evidence is ugly,” Tom continued. “Ugly enough to satisfy the department. They’re turning it over to the DA. As far as they’re concerned, it’s a closed case.”

Ralph rose from the couch without a word. He cleared his throat, gruff and tired, and headed into the kitchen where Annie was already working on her cookies.

Tom watched him go, then turned to Lisa.

“I should get going,” Tom said. “I’ll find Bobby and fill him in.”

Lisa hesitated, then nodded, like she’d made up her mind about something.

“Tom… you asked me to tell you if anything strange came up.” She lowered her voice. “Johnny kept a gun in our dresser drawer. For protection. He even showed me how to use it—just in case.”

Tom’s eyes stayed on her, steady.

“I saw it there the morning Johnny was killed,” she went on. “Last night, I heard something in the yard. I got scared and went to get it. The gun wasn’t in the drawer. I searched the whole house. It was gone.”

Tom felt the first real chill of the night.

“You’re sure it was there that morning?” he asked.

“Yes. Positive.”

“And nothing else missing? Jewelry? Cash?”

“No. I checked everything. Annie’s room too. Just the gun.”

Tom nodded slowly. “Anyone else have access to the house?”

“Bobby,” she said, after a beat. “He’s got a key. But we barely speak. I didn’t want to accuse him of anything without knowing.”

“I’m glad you told me,” Tom said. “That gun—was it registered?”

“Johnny bought it years ago. I don’t think it could be traced back to him.”

Tom exhaled through his nose. “That makes it harder. The gun they found in Libby’s car can’t be tied directly to Johnny without a match.”

“So what does that mean?” Lisa asked.

“It means the road just got narrower,” Tom said. “And darker.”

“Unless…?” she pressed.

Tom shook his head. “Nothing yet. Just thinking out loud.”

Lisa walked him to the door. The house felt quieter now, heavier.

“Be careful,” she said.

“You too,” Tom replied.

He stepped outside and pulled the door shut behind him. He still had to talk to Bobby—but first, he needed to see Steve.

And suddenly, Richie Libby didn’t feel like the end of this thing at all.

Chapter Seven

George Zap had finally had enough.

He sat in his antique shop, arms folded, watching the glass man replace his front window—for the third time. The air smelled of dust and fresh putty. This one came with a message the others hadn’t. An unlit Molotov cocktail lay on the sidewalk outside, cradled in broken glass like a threat that had learned how to spell.

Next time, it said without words, we burn you alive.

Bobby Dietz wasn’t a mobster. He was a bully with a last name and a little borrowed muscle. Johnny had been no better—just another spoiled brat riding his old man’s reputation. They were kings to men like Henry Leong and the other Sepulveda merchants, shaking them down while they nodded and paid out of fear.

Zap wasn’t built that way.

The anger had been simmering for months. Now it was boiling over.

When the bag man showed up the next morning, Zap didn’t bother with talk. He stepped out from behind the counter and swung a billy club across the man’s face. Bone cracked. The thug went down hard.

Zap dropped a knee into his throat and pressed until the man gagged, eyes rolling. He racked the shotgun and slid the barrel under the man’s chin.

“Where’s Bobby?” Zap asked, calm as Sunday mass.

“The office,” the man croaked. “Please—please—”

Mercy came in the form of two quick blows from the butt of the shotgun. Zap dragged the man outside like trash, left him bleeding on the pavement for someone else to deal with.

Then Zap started walking.

Up the block. Slow. Deliberate.

The sun caught the edge of his glasses as he squinted ahead, jaw clenched tight enough to grind teeth to powder. Each step carried him closer to the Dietz storefront, closer to the men who thought fear was ownership.

This time, Zap wasn’t paying.

And he wasn’t asking.

⸻

Tom called Steve at the precinct to let him know he was stopping by. He wanted to run a theory past him—something Lisa had said that wouldn’t sit still in his head—but it was the kind of thing you didn’t trust to a phone line.

He pulled up out front and took the stairs two at a time.

By the time Tom stepped into Steve’s office, the case had already flipped on its back and bled out. Whatever Tom thought he was bringing in with him didn’t matter anymore. Steve beat him to it—and then some.

“George Zap’s being brought in on murder one,” Steve said, flat and tired. “His shop window got busted last night. This time it came with a message—unlit Molotov cocktail. Weak warning, if you ask me.”

Tom stopped cold.

“Collector shows up this morning,” Steve went on. “Zap snaps. Beats the hell out of him. Goes full tilt. Then he marches up the block, kicks in the front door of the Dietz storefront with a shotgun, and kills two of their guys—point-blank. No hesitation. Bobby Dietz had stepped out a couple minutes before it went down.”

Tom felt the room tilt.

“When patrol arrived,” Steve said, “Zap drops the gun and surrenders. Guess he realized he’d had his shot at Bobby—and missed.”

“Where’s Bobby now?” Tom asked. His voice didn’t sound like it belonged to him.

Steve shook his head. “Don’t know. We expect him to circle back. Probably running an errand. Cigarettes. Something small. He’s got a habit of showing up right after the smoke clears.”

Steve studied Tom for a second, then added, “So—what was it you wanted to tell me?”

Tom didn’t answer right away.

The pieces were moving now. Fast. And not in the direction he liked.

⸻

Steve’s phone rang, snapping Tom back to the present.

“Bobby’s at the sister-in-law’s house,” the voice on the other end said. “His car’s in the driveway. We wanted you to know before we go in.”

“Tell them to hold tight,” Tom said. “Don’t make a move till we get there. I’ll explain on the ride.”

They piled into Steve’s car, the red bubble light screaming against the morning, tires howling as they tore through traffic. Tom stared out the windshield, the city blurring past in sun-washed streaks. Lisa had told him she barely spoke to Bobby. Now he was parked in her driveway in the middle of the day, while Annie was in school. Nothing fit. Least of all the neat little bow they’d tried to tie around Richie Libby.

The squad car sat across the street when they arrived, engine idling, the smell of exhaust hanging low.

“He’s still inside,” the uniform said.

“Stay put,” Steve ordered. “Don’t move unless you hear from us.”

They crossed the lawn together. Steve knocked, hard and official.

“Police. Open the door, please.”

No answer.

He knocked again, then leaned on the doorbell, his voice rising.

“Everything okay in there?”

Four long minutes passed. The kind that stretch thin and tight.

Lisa finally opened the door. Her blouse was half-tucked, half-forgotten. Her hair looked like it had been brushed in a hurry—or not brushed enough.

Steve’s eyes swept the room.

“What the hell’s going on here?” he asked, already knowing the answer.

Bobby stepped out of the kitchen. His suit jacket lay draped over the loveseat like a confession. His shoes sat by the door, neat and unmistakable.

Tom felt something cold settle in his gut. In this line of work, believing anyone was a luxury—but he’d believed Lisa when she said Bobby was out of her life. He knew better now.

“I want answers,” Steve said, his voice flat and dangerous. “How long has this been going on? Did Johnny find out? Is that why he’s dead?”

“I want my lawyer,” Bobby snapped. “Lisa, don’t say a word. I just came by to talk.”

“I asked you a question, Dietz,” Steve said. “And you’re sounding like a man without a good answer.”

He waved in the uniforms. They moved fast, hands on Bobby’s arms, metal clicking shut.

“Don’t say anything,” Bobby called as they took him out. “Lisa, we weren’t doing anything. It was innocent.”

The door closed. The house felt smaller now. Quieter. Like it was holding its breath.

Tom turned to her.

“All right, Lisa,” he said softly. “You told me you and Bobby barely spoke. Start talking.”

She folded her arms, jaw tight.

“I was furious about Johnny and that whore. I wanted to hurt him back. Sleeping with his brother felt like revenge. Bitter revenge. I hated myself for it—but it was something I had over Johnny, even if it was only in my head.”

“Then why was Bobby still here?” Tom asked.

“I told him it was a one-time thing. He wouldn’t let it go. He threatened to tell Johnny. Ralph too. Even Annie. He thought we’d end up together once Johnny left. I told him it was never happening. After today, I was done.”

Tom nodded slowly. The pieces were shifting again.

“I don’t know what to believe anymore,” he said. “Bobby’s got motive. So do you. And it wouldn’t take much for one of his guys to slip a gun into Richie Libby’s car. This case just blew wide open.”

⸻

Outside, Steve was waiting. Tom caught him up in low tones, then added one more wrinkle he’d been carrying around like a loose tooth.

Steve told Lisa it wouldn’t hurt to call a lawyer. She said she’d call her brother first.

Tom’s eyebrows lifted as he stepped back into the sunlight. The air felt heavier now, like a storm deciding where to land. Whatever came next wasn’t going to make things cleaner—only darker.

Chapter Eight

Meanwhile, Tom’s secretary Beth arrived at the LA City Records and Archives Department at 222 North Hill Street. She carried a briefcase and a short list of instructions: research anyone connected to Johnny Dietz and Rosemary Dole—any name that might matter.

She pushed through the heavy doors of the Los Angeles County Hall of Records, the air stale with old paper and dust that never quite settled. It was late afternoon. The light came in low and tired through high windows, stretching long shadows across the floor.

Beth signed in, exchanged a few clipped words with a clerk, and was directed toward the reading room. Metal cabinets lined the walls. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, uneven and unforgiving.

One by one, the files were brought out. Names. Dates. Addresses. A few arrests that went nowhere. Incidents that never quite made sense. She worked steadily, making quiet notes, her expression giving nothing away.

Most of what she read confirmed what Tom already suspected—or feared. Nothing jumped out. Nothing clean. Just fragments and loose ends.

Then she reached the last file.

Beth paused longer this time. She reread a page, then another. Her pen hovered before she finally wrote something down, careful and precise.

She closed the folder, slipped her notes into her purse, and returned the file without a word. When she stepped back outside, the city was already shifting into evening, the air thick with noise and unfinished business.

She headed back to the office knowing one thing for sure: whatever Tom thought he knew, it wasn’t the whole story.

⸻

Lisa Dietz called her brother Phil the second she locked the door behind the last of them. He came right over, no questions, jacket still on when he stepped inside. They sat at the kitchen table and she poured him a cup of coffee—black, strong—then told him everything. The whole sordid tale, start to finish.

Phil slammed his fist down on the metal tabletop with the force of a hammer. If it had been wood, it would’ve split clean in two. As it was, the dent sat there like a scar.

“Why, Lisa? Why, damn it,” he said, his voice tight. “You told me you had as little to do with Bobby as possible. Now this. I tried like hell to keep you out of this mess, and now you’re standing dead center.”

“You don’t understand what it was like,” she said. “The humiliation. What Johnny put me through. I had to get back at him—had to. I chose the most personal way I could. I know it was a mistake. I see that now. But what do I do?”

“They found the murder weapon in Richie Libby’s car,” Phil said, forcing himself to slow down. “That’s damning. Your thing with Bobby—it’s ugly, sure. The papers’ll chew it up. But it doesn’t tie you to the murders.”

Lisa looked at him sharply. “How did you know about Richie Libby?”

The question hung in the air longer than it should have.

“We hear things on the docks,” Phil said finally. “Guy I work with—his brother’s a cop. That’s all.”

“Phil… what are you going to do now? What am I supposed to do?”

“You call a lawyer,” he said. “Not one of Ralph’s fixers. Call the guy you used when you bought the house—have him recommend someone solid. And until you do, you don’t say another word to anyone.”

She nodded. “Okay. I will. Now go back to work. Let it lie. Don’t get yourself into trouble, Phil. Like you said—everything points to Richie. Let it go.”

Phil didn’t answer. He just sat there, staring at the dent in the table, his jaw clenched. He’d thought Johnny’s death meant his sister was finally free—free of a bad marriage, free of the Dietz grip.

But Bobby changed that.

Nothing was finished. Not even close.

⸻

Nothing was going right for Bobby.

Police tape sealed off the door to his storefront office, fluttering in the afternoon breeze like a bad omen. The place was a crime scene now. No collections. No meetings. No control. Two of his most trusted men were dead, sprawled cold on the floor, and the one man he wanted revenge on—George Zap—was already in custody. Out of reach. Untouchable. Justice, if you could call it that, had stolen his satisfaction.

With nowhere else to turn, Bobby drove to Ralph’s house.

The old man was retired, at least on paper. He’d handed the family business to his sons years ago—an operation he’d built from nothing, brick by brick, threat by threat. It had made him rich, along with a few well-timed stock plays that proved he understood numbers as well as fear. But lately the business was bleeding. Johnny’s weakness for women and Bobby’s talent for screwing things up had turned a slow decline into a free fall. It was only a matter of time before the whole thing collapsed in on itself.

When Bobby stepped inside, Ralph was sitting on the couch, eyes locked on a flickering black-and-white Jimmy Cagney movie. The volume was low, but the violence still came through loud and clear.

“Hey, Pop,” Bobby said, forcing confidence into his voice. “We need to talk. Teddy Boy and Mario were killed this morning. Cops locked up the office—crime scene. I’m in trouble.”

Ralph stood slowly and turned to face him. The look in his eyes wasn’t anger. It was worse. Disappointment. Pure and settled. He slapped Bobby hard across the face. Even at seventy-five, Ralph’s hand still carried weight.

“With your brother’s widow,” Ralph said coldly. “Your dead brother’s widow. What the hell were you thinking? Do you ever think?”

“She came on to me,” Bobby said, rubbing his cheek. “Lisa’s a beautiful woman. I think I’m in love with her.”

Ralph shook his head. “Then maybe it’s better you don’t think at all. It’s over. You stay the hell away from her, you hear me? I’ll cut you off so fast you won’t know what hit you. Streets. Soup lines. That’s where you’ll end up if I hear otherwise. You understand me?”

“Yeah,” Bobby muttered. “Yeah. I understand.”

Ralph exhaled, the edge dulling just a little. “As for the business—I’m putting Tony Shacks in charge. He’s smart. He listens. You do what he tells you. Lay low until the mess you made dies down. Stay in your apartment. Don’t talk to anyone. I got you a lawyer. He talks for you. You got that?”

“Loud and clear.”

Ralph turned away. “You’re a big disappointment to me. Both my sons. Now get out.”

Bobby left with his head down, the sting of the slap still warm on his face. He walked back into a future that no longer belonged to him, knowing the worst part wasn’t what he’d lost—it was that someone else was now deciding how much more he was going to lose.

Chapter Nine

Tom went straight back to the office, the late afternoon light slanting through the blinds like prison bars. He wanted to know what Beth had turned up—really wanted to know. In this business, answers had a way of arriving late, wearing bad shoes.

Beth didn’t waste time. She handed him a single sheet of paper, her expression careful.

“Most of it’s old news,” she said. “Except one name. Read it slow and draw your own conclusions.”

Tom leaned against his desk and read.

Phil Anzalone.

Years back, when Phil was barely shaving, he’d run errands for a low-level mobster named Vinny Bop—nothing glamorous, nothing brave. Stealing cars. Breaking ignitions. Hot-wiring beaters and leaving them cooling in alleyways. When Phil finally got pinched at eighteen, the judge gave him a choice: prison or the Marines.

Phil chose the Marines. The war followed.

He came back changed. Quieter. Sharper. A man who knew how to wait, how to aim, how to finish what he started. And a man who still knew his way around a car lock.

Tom set the paper down gently, like it might explode.

Johnny’s murder wasn’t random. And Rosemary’s wasn’t personal—it was staging. Misdirection. A setup to frame Richie Libby, gift-wrapped with a gun Phil had planted in his car using skills he’d learned years ago on the streets.

Rosemary hadn’t been silenced for what she knew. She’d been silenced because she fit the story Phil needed to tell. Johnny died for what he’d done to Lisa. Rosemary died to close the book on Richie.

Tom felt the pieces lock together, cold and final.

Phil Anzalone had killed them both.

“Good work, Beth,” he said. “There’ll be something extra in your check Friday.”

She nodded. “Are we too late?”

“I hope not,” Tom said—and meant something else entirely.

⸻

Steve was at the precinct when Tom burst in, breath still riding high in his chest.

Steve Foley looked up. “You look like hell.”

“Phil Anzalone,” Tom said. “Car thief as a kid. Marines after that. He had motive for Johnny—what Johnny did to Lisa—and Rosemary was just cleanup. A frame job to bury Richie Libby and close the book. He planted the gun in Richie’s car. Used the same skills he had when he was stealing cars at sixteen.”

Steve didn’t argue. That scared Tom more than if he had.

“Where’s Bobby?” Tom asked.

“Try his apartment. Hopefully laying low.”

Tom was already moving. “We’ve gotta get there. Now.”

⸻

They didn’t know if Bobby would be home. They just took the shot. Sometimes instinct was all you had left.

They heard the shouting before they hit the door.

Bobby’s voice—cracked, panicked. Begging.

The door was unlocked.

Inside, Phil stood too close, a switchblade pressed tight under Bobby’s jaw. His hand didn’t shake.

When Phil saw them, his eyes went flat.

“Back off,” he said. “Both of you.”

Steve and Tom spread slightly, guns drawn, the room thick with sweat and fear.

“It’s over, Phil,” Tom said, steady. “Put the knife down. Walk out of here breathing.”

“He destroyed her!” Phil shouted. “Johnny humiliated Lisa. Treated her like garbage. Threw her away for a whore. Bobby’s no better—using her, threatening her. They’re all the same. They deserved it.”

“Maybe they did,” Steve said. “But killing them doesn’t bring her peace. It just puts you in the ground next to them.”

Phil’s jaw tightened. His grip shifted.

Bobby flinched—and that was enough.

The blade slipped just an inch.

Two shots cracked the air almost as one.

Phil Anzalone dropped hard, the sound final. The knife clattered across the floor, harmless now.

Bobby slid down the wall, alive. Again.

Tom holstered his weapon and stared at the body on the floor. Phil had been a soldier once. A protector. A brother who loved his sister too much to let her suffer alone.

But love twisted into vengeance was still murder.

And murder, in the end, always came with a bill.

Steve called it in. The sirens started wailing in the distance.

Tom stepped outside and lit a cigarette, the smoke curling up into the fading Los Angeles light.

Luck, he thought, was running thin—but it was still holding.

Chapter Ten

Three weeks later, the rain finally came to Los Angeles—like it had been holding a grudge and decided to collect all at once. It hammered the rooftops, turned the gutters into brown rivers, and washed the city clean enough to pretend it had never been dirty.

Tom Hart sat in his office with the lights low and the door locked. The Dietz file was closed, stamped, and shoved into a drawer he wouldn’t open again unless someone paid him to. Richie Libby walked out of county jail with an apology from the DA and a chip on his shoulder the size of City Hall. George Zap took a plea—manslaughter on the two collectors—and would be breaking rocks upstate for the next fifteen. Bobby Dietz vanished quietly; rumor said he’d taken a one-way bus ticket to somewhere east of the Mississippi where nobody knew his last name or cared.

Lisa Dietz sold the house on the quiet, packed Annie into a battered Ford, and headed north. Word was she had family in Oregon who didn’t ask questions. Phil Anzalone got a military funeral—flag on the casket, three-volley salute, the works. The Marines take care of their own, even when their own go wrong.

Tom poured two fingers of bourbon into a coffee cup because the glasses were dirty and he didn’t care. The radio played something slow and sad—Billie Holiday, maybe, or just the ghost of her.

He thought about Phil, standing in that apartment with the knife at Bobby’s throat and nothing left in his eyes but the echo of a war that never really ended. He thought about Lisa, trading one kind of cage for another because revenge felt like freedom until it didn’t. He thought about Johnny and Rosemary, two people who reached for something better and got bullets instead.

Most of all he thought about Annie—five years old, clutching her dolls while the adults around her tore the world apart with their bare hands.

Beth knocked once and came in without waiting. She dropped a thin envelope on his desk.

“From Lisa Dietz,” she said. “Came general delivery. No return address.”

Tom slit it open. Inside was a photograph: Annie on a porch swing somewhere green, smiling like the sun had come out just for her. On the back, in careful handwriting:

Thank you for seeing it through.We’re safe now.Tell him I’m sorry it ended the way it did.—L.

Tom stared at the picture a long time. Then he slipped it into his wallet, behind the private investigator’s license he sometimes wished he could tear up.

Beth lingered in the doorway. “You going to drink that alone?”

He looked at the bourbon, then at her. “Not tonight.”

She nodded once—the same nod she’d given clients, cops, and liars for years—and turned off the outer light as she left.

Outside, the rain kept falling, washing the blood off the streets and carrying it down to the sea. In Los Angeles, that was as close to absolution as anyone ever got.

Tom raised the cup anyway.

“To the ones who get away,” he said to the empty room.

And for once, he almost believed it.",1,1766019061.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1

Bobby Dietz pushed through the frosted glass door of Tom Hart, Private Investigations, like he owned the joint. He planted himself in front of Beth, Tom’s secretary, and talked at her the way a man talks when he’s never been told “no” and doesn’t plan to start now.

“I wanna see Hart. Got work for him.”

Beth looked him over, slow and unimpressed—like the grandmother who’d rap your knuckles with a wooden spoon just for thinking about giving her lip. She picked up the phone.

“Mr. Hart, there’s a gentleman here who’d like a word.”

She hung up, gave Bobby a look that said try anything and I’ll make you regret it, and waved him toward the inner office.

Tom Hart sat behind his desk, feet planted, eyes alert. Benny Goodman’s clarinet drifted from the radio, soft and easy. When Bobby shut the door behind him, Tom reached over and turned the volume down.

“What can I do for you?” Tom asked.

“My name’s Dietz. Bobby. I need you to find out who killed my brother Johnny.”

“Sit,” Tom said. “Start talking.”

Bobby lowered himself into the chair like it might bite. “Johnny worked for our old man, Ralph. So do I. We keep the stores along Sepulveda from having… accidents. Someone put holes in my brother. I want the name of the hand that held the gun. You give me that, I handle the rest.”

Tom nodded once. It wasn’t much, but it was enough. When a job smelled this sour, he went straight to his best nose on the street: Rusty. A man who lived in alleys, drank like he was allergic to daylight, and knew every whisper worth hearing.

⸻

The Stardust Lounge was baking under the midday sun. Tom pushed inside, grateful for the blast of air conditioning that hit him like a cold hand.

Rusty was at the far end of the bar, coaxing luck out of a one-armed bandit. When he spotted Tom, he jerked his head toward a booth in the corner. They slid into opposite sides, the table between them like neutral ground.

“I need intel,” Tom said. “Fast. Johnny Dietz. Murder. What’ve you got?”

Rusty kept his mouth shut until a twenty landed on the table. Then he snapped it up like a hungry dog.

“A Jane came in yesterday,” he said. “Some off-duty cop was with her—the one who hangs around. She told him Dietz caught a couple slugs in the head for sniffing around where he wasn’t wanted.”

Tom’s eyes narrowed. “The Jane got a name?”

Rusty’s lips twitched. He waited. Another twenty slid across the wood. He grabbed it.

“Rosemary. Rosemary Dole.”

“And the cop?”

Rusty smirked. “Your buddy Foley. Homicide. Guess he found her without my help.”

Tom leaned back. “Forty bucks oughta get me more than two names, Rusty.”

Rusty shrugged. “She said she’s Richie Libby’s girl. Jealous type. Libby’s a loan shark—one of the nasty ones. Foley jots it all down and walks out like it’s Tuesday.”

Tom pushed himself out of the booth. “Keep your ears open and your eyes wider. If I need you again, you’ll know.”

He left Rusty counting his money and the Stardust’s neon buzzing like an angry wasp behind him.

⸻

Tom went back to the office and shut himself in. He told Beth not to disturb him unless it was about the Dietz case. She nodded once—the kind of nod that meant she’d guard that door like a bulldog.

He thumbed through the white pages until he found Rosemary Dole: a second-floor apartment off Vine. If Foley was already sniffing around, Tom would have to move fast.

He pulled up in front of her building—a tired, low-rent flat perched above a drugstore. One look at the block told him Rusty hadn’t given him the whole song. This stretch of Vine was known for women who worked nights and slept through their mornings. Rosemary wasn’t living here because the rent was good.

He climbed the narrow stairs and rapped on her door. Eleven o’clock—too early for a trick, but late enough for her to be awake.

Footsteps. The door cracked open as far as the chain would allow.

“Another cop,” she sighed. “I told Foley everything I know.” She started to shut it.

Tom slid his foot into the gap and eased the door back. “I’m not a cop. Private investigator. Working for Bobby Dietz. You know the name. So… you wanna talk to me, or you wanna talk to him?”

She looked him over slowly, then unhooked the chain.

She wore an old silk robe that had seen better decades. Her hair was bleached blonde in a Marilyn Monroe style, trying hard to shave a few years off the forty-plus she carried in her face.

She crossed the room, poured herself a vodka on ice, and said, “Cops don’t drink on duty.”

“I told you—I’m no cop. Haven’t been one in fifteen years. I’ll join you if you don’t mind.”

She gave him a sly, practiced smile and poured a second glass.

“So,” Tom said, settling onto the threadbare sofa, “who killed Johnny Dietz?”

“Damned if I know.” She took a long pull from her drink. “He was a client for about a year. Richie’s my agent—and my protection. Very possessive type. Once you start with Richie, you don’t get out. Johnny got attached. Happens more than you think. He said he’d take care of me, get me out of the life. Said he’d talk to Richie. Next thing? He’s dead.”

“Did you feel the same way about him?” Tom asked.

Rosemary laughed—a dry, brittle sound. “Take a good look at me. I haven’t been in love since my first abortion at sixteen. But if Johnny was willing to get me out of this life? Yeah, I’d listen.”

“So nothing that pins the murder on Richie?”

“Not a thing. And if Richie did kill Johnny, he sure as hell wouldn’t tell me.”

Tom finished his drink, stood, and handed her his card—folded around a twenty. “If you hear anything, call me.”

She smirked. “For another twenty you get another drink… and an hour in my bed. How about it?”

Tom hesitated only long enough to recognize the familiar tug in his gut. If he had a weakness, it was for professionals—something quick, hot, and meaningless. He dropped another twenty on her dresser.

She took him by the hand and led him toward the bedroom before he could think twice.

⸻

Chapter Two

That night at Johnny Dietz’s wake, Tom showed up in the newest of his three gray suits, hair combed back, white dress shirt buttoned clean under his tie. He looked like a man paying respects, not digging for answers.

Bobby played it that way, too—kept things casual, like Tom was just someone who’d known Johnny in passing. He brought him over to meet Johnny’s widow, Lisa, and their five-year-old daughter, Annie.

Lisa wore a plain black dress, her hair pinned up in a tight bun. She was weeping softly, the kind of quiet grief that seeps into a room more than it sounds in it. On either side of her sat Ralph Dietz, the family patriarch, stiff and stone-faced, and Phil Anzalone—Lisa’s brother, a longshoreman—who held little Annie on his lap, her small hands gripping his shirt.

The room was thick with cigarette smoke and whispered condolences. Tom nodded respectfully, taking in every detail. In a family like the Dietzes, mourning and menace often shared the same pew.

Aievoli Funeral Home was packed wall to wall. The coffin was closed; the gunshot wound between Johnny’s eyes was too messy for even the best mortician to hide.

Bobby worked the room like he was emceeing the Oscars. Tom stayed back, watching faces, reading reactions as Bobby shook hands and accepted condolences. Mob funerals drew all kinds—family, friends, enemies dressed up like friends. Odds were good that whoever put a hole in Johnny Dietz’s head was in the room right now, keeping their mask on.

When Richie Libby walked in with his brother Milo, Tom felt the air shift. The Libby brothers got in line to kneel at the coffin, whispering to each other and chuckling like they were trading jokes. Maybe they found the irony funny.

Bobby didn’t miss it either. His face tightened just enough to show displeasure, but not enough to hint at hostility. If he thought Richie had anything to do with Johnny’s murder, he wasn’t letting it show.

Richie and Milo knelt, crossed themselves, and then moved down the line—Ralph, Lisa, Phil—offering the appropriate murmurs of sympathy. Then they drifted over to Bobby in the corner and spoke with him for a long five minutes, laughing, clasping hands, even hugging him before they headed out the door.

That’s how it was done. You paid your respects, you kept up appearances, and you left—clean, polite, and without telling the truth.

Tom sat in the back, watching and taking mental notes. He was there mainly to see the reaction when the Libby brothers arrived. Richie was a solid suspect early on, but there was still a lot of digging to do.

Two hands suddenly clamped down on Tom’s shoulders. He looked up to see Detective Steve Foley of the LAPD grinning down at him.

“Funny seeing you here,” Steve said.

“Just paying my respects.”

“Didn’t think you ran in this circle. Full of surprises, you are.” Steve’s tone was teasing but edged. “Come on—let’s get out of here. I’ll buy you a cup of coffee. We should talk.”

Tom glanced toward Bobby and gave him a nod. He’d gotten everything he could out of the wake. Whatever Steve wanted to say was bound to be worth hearing.

⸻

They drove to Pan’s Diner off Ventura Boulevard and slid into a window booth, each of them casually scanning the street to see if anyone had followed. As far as they could tell, no one had.

A pretty young redhead approached, pad in hand. Her name tag read Molly.

“What can I get you gentlemen tonight?” she asked, her throaty voice sounding intentionally alluring.

“Two coffees,” Steve said, giving her a slow once-over.

“Sure thing. Must be cops—only cops take up a whole booth for nothing but coffee.”

“Maybe you should be a cop. You’re very observant,” Tom said.

“My dad’s a cop in New Orleans. He told me that’s how you can tell.”

“Let me guess,” Steve added. “You’re out here to be an actress?”

“I’m acting right now,” she said with a wink, heading to the counter for their Joe.

“Who’s paying you, Tom?” Steve asked once she was gone. “From the way you and Bobby Dietz were exchanging glances, my money’s on him.”

They paused as Molly set their coffees on the table and walked off.

“That’s confidential,” Tom said. “But your instincts are usually correct.”

“Tell me some of what you know, and I’ll do the same,” Steve offered.

“I know you were talking with Rosemary at the Stardust. I saw her yesterday. She’s pointing the finger at Richie Libby—called him her agent, not her pimp.”

“Yeah, she told me the same. Definitely a person of interest. I talked to the merchants on Sepulveda who pay protection to the Dietzes. George Zap—owns Zap’s Antique Furniture—tough bastard. Refused to pay since he opened six months ago. Sleeps in the back with a shotgun a couple nights a week. Had his windows smashed twice, last one just last week. Got into a street blowout with Johnny—Zap was shouting he’d kill him if he didn’t back off. Johnny yelling right back that he had to pay. Scared the hell out of the other store owners.”

“So you think it’s Zap?” Tom asked.

“I don’t know. I checked him out. Did time in his early twenties for burglary—second-story man. Doesn’t trust cops. Maybe he’ll talk to you. Just don’t say who you’re working for.”

“I was planning on seeing him tomorrow anyway. Glad you mentioned him—I’ll be sure to turn on the charm.”

“Just make sure you tell me if you find anything that helps my investigation,” Steve said. “You scratch my back, I scratch yours.”

“That goes without saying, pal.”

They talked Dodgers baseball until Steve took the check from Molly and paid at the counter.

“We’ll keep in touch,” Steve said out in the parking lot as they headed for their cars.

Tom nodded. Two suspects now—but still no answers.

⸻

Chapter Three

The next morning the sky was a flat sheet of gray, the kind that made Los Angeles feel borrowed from another city. It was unseasonably cold, the kind of chill that crept under a collar and stayed there. Before heading to Sepulveda Boulevard to talk to the merchants—especially George Zap—Tom parked across from the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels to watch the funeral procession spill out of the church.

Nothing about it seemed unusual at first. The pallbearers moved slowly down the stone steps, carrying Johnny Dietz’s coffin with the solemn coordination of men who’d done this before. They slid it into the waiting hearse, shutting the door on his final ride.

Phil Anzalone came next, cradling little Annie in his arms as if she might break. Behind him, Lisa clung to his arm for balance—her plain black dress and pale face giving her the fragile look of a widow from an older, sadder time. Phil wore a black suit and sunglasses, rigid as a Secret Service agent guarding a head of state.

A photographer from the LA Times tried to edge in for a better shot. He got too close—close enough to annoy the wrong man. Phil threw out a stiff arm like an NFL fullback, knocking the photographer down to one knee. The man didn’t even get out a protest. He just packed up and backed off.

They were a tight family, Tom thought. A bruised one—but tight. Thankfully, they still had each other.

⸻

After the funeral procession pulled away, Tom made his way from Temple Street to Sepulveda.

It was eleven a.m. Dietz Trucking—the corner shop fronting for loan-sharking, narcotics, and extortion—was shuttered tight for the funeral. The extortion end of the business was the reason Tom was there.

He stepped into Leong’s Chinese Laundry, a cramped room that smelled of starch and steam. Henry, the proprietor, was behind the counter working an abacus like he was trying to solve the national debt.

“Mr. Leong,” Tom said, flashing his license. “Name’s Hart. Private investigator.”

Henry didn’t even look up. “No,” he snapped in broken English, eyes wide with alarm. “Leave me alone.”

“I just want to ask if you saw the argument between Mr. Dietz and Mr. Zap.”

“No see. No hear. You go now! I call police!”

Henry was shaking, pale as rice paper. Tom knew fear when he saw it—and this was the kind that came from long-term intimidation. He wasn’t getting anything here.

The butcher and the smoke-shop owner gave him the same cold shoulder.

The Dietzes had put the fear of God into every merchant on the block—every one except one.

⸻

When Tom stepped into Zap’s Antique Furniture, the air changed. It smelled of old wood, dust, and defiance.

“Lousy bums,” Zap barked the second Tom mentioned the Dietzes. “They can all go to hell—especially that fat bastard Johnny. Scumbag got what was coming.”

Tom kept his tone flat. “Talking like that could make you a prime suspect. So let me ask you straight: did you kill him?”

Zap laughed—a sharp, bitter sound. “If I did, you think I’d tell you? I keep a shotgun in the back and sleep here a couple nights a week. Nobody knows when. Let ‘em try something. They’ll be picking buckshot outta their asses. All legal.”

“You’re a tough man,” Tom said. “But the Dietzes don’t fight fair.”

“Neither did the Japs at Okinawa,” Zap shot back. “The Dietzes would’ve shit themselves if they saw what I saw. They want my money? They can damn well come and take it.”

Tom shook his hand. The grip was hard, calloused, and unafraid. “Just be careful, George. And don’t do anything stupid. Here’s my card. Call if you need me.”

“I don’t see why I would,” Zap muttered, pocketing it. “But I’ll keep it.”

⸻

Tom stepped back outside.

The clouds had burned off, and the sudden sun made him squint like it was aiming for his eyes.

Six months in business and Zap hadn’t paid a dime in protection.

Did he kill Johnny Dietz?

Tom hoped not—but he penciled the name in anyway.

⸻

Chapter Four

Tom let a couple of days pass before making his move on Lisa Dietz.

Bobby had told him about her routine—9 a.m. walks in the park after putting Annie on the kindergarten bus. A good time to catch her, a better time to catch her off guard.

She came around the quarter-mile track in sweatpants and a white T-shirt, hair tucked under a Dodgers cap. She walked at a steady clip, the kind of pace people keep when they’re trying to outwalk their thoughts.

Tom stepped toward her just as she finished a stretch.

“Mrs. Dietz? I’m Tom Hart. Bobby introduced us at your husband’s wake.”

“There were a lot of people there,” she said. “I wasn’t in the best frame of mind. I’m sorry—I don’t remember you.”

“That’s understandable, ma’am.” He showed her his badge. “I’m a private detective. Bobby hired me to find your husband’s killer. I just want to ask a few questions.”

She nodded. “If I can help, I will.”

“Did Johnny have enemies? Anyone threaten him? Anything in his life that might’ve gone sour?”

“Detective, if you want to ask about my husband’s affair with that trollop, you can come right out and say it.”

“That would be helpful, ma’am.”

“I confronted him about three or four weeks ago. He didn’t deny it.” Her jaw tightened, voice rising from a simmer to a boil. “He told me they were in love. That he planned on leaving us. Said he hadn’t loved me in years.”

She shook her head, furious at the memory.

“I told him, ‘You’re leaving your family for a prostitute?’ I slapped him. He punched me in the mouth, threw me on the floor, kicked my leg. Screamed that she was giving up the life and they were moving in together. That he’d kill me if I caused trouble. Me—cause trouble.” Her breath hitched, the words breaking loose from someplace she’d kept locked too long.

Tom’s voice softened. “I’m sorry, ma’am. I don’t want to upset you.”

“No. Let me finish.” She wiped her eyes and steadied herself. “A couple days later a man knocks on my door looking for Johnny. When I said he wasn’t home, he asked if he was with ‘that whore.’ I told him I didn’t know where Johnny was. He said she was his property, and he’d kill her if Johnny didn’t back off. He wanted me to know. To be scared.”

“Was he at the wake?”

“He was. Richie Libby. He and his brother Milo—pimps. I hate the life Johnny chose. A lot of phonies. They hug you one minute, shoot you the next.”

“Does Bobby know any of this?” Tom asked.

“I don’t talk to Bobby,” she said sharply. “When I married Johnny, Bobby made a pass at me. I threatened to tell Johnny if he didn’t knock it off. We stayed out of each other’s way ever since. Johnny always called him a backstabber—but they were still brothers.”

Tom knew he’d taken the well as far down as it would go. He handed her his card.

“If you remember anything—anything at all—call me.”

“I will.” She hesitated, then added, “Just remember this: Bobby, Richie, all of ’em—they’re low-life backstabbers. Annie and I… we only have my brother Phil. He’s the one who looks out for us.”

“I’ll keep that in mind,” Tom said.

He tipped his hat, stepped back onto the path, and let her walk off the rest of her ghosts.

⸻

Tom went back to his office.

“Any calls, Beth?”

“Just Steve. Said to get back to him. He’ll be at the precinct until two. Said it’s important.”

“Thanks, Beth,” Tom said, closing his inner door behind him.

He dropped into his chair, slid open the top drawer, and pulled out the flask of bourbon he kept tucked beside old case notes. He took two long swallows, felt the burn settle, and turned the radio on low. Tommy Dorsey’s I’m Getting Sentimental Over You drifted through the speaker like a memory you don’t want but can’t shake.

He dialed Steve’s line.

“Foley,” the cop’s voice came through, rough as gravel.

“It’s Tom. Beth said you called. You got anything?”

“Yeah. Rosemary was found dead in her apartment this morning. Someone put a pillow over her head and shot her through it. Coroner figures around two a.m.”

“A john robbing her?” Tom sat up, tapping a pencil against the desk.

“Ballistics came back. Same gun that killed Johnny Dietz. Everything’s pointing to Richie Libby.”

“You pick him up yet?”

“I’ve got a guy watching him. He’s at Louie Burro’s club on Ventura. Meet me out front in fifteen minutes if you want to be there for the pinch. We’ll question him together.”

Tom hung up, grabbed his coat, and headed for the stairs.

“I don’t know when I’ll be back,” he told Beth as he blew past her desk.

Moments later he was in his sedan, engine running hot. Richie Libby being the one had always been the easy answer.

And Tom had learned long ago—in murder, the easy answer was almost never a sure thing.

Chapter Five

It was a typical Los Angeles morning—the sun already firing on all cylinders, the air warming fast. Seventy-five degrees and climbing, the kind of heat that promised sweat before noon and trouble before dark.

Tom spotted the unmarked cars as he pulled up outside Louie Burro’s social club on Ventura Boulevard. Steve Foley stepped out of a black Chevy Bel Air with two uniformed cops flanking him, faces set, hands already restless.

“We’re ready to collar that scumbag Richie,” Steve said. “Just him. Get him in the car and straight to the precinct. We’ll give him our own brand of TLC.”

The two uniforms and Tom drew their pistols and moved across the street in a controlled jog, adrenaline buzzing just under the skin. The uniforms hit the door first.

“Police! Don’t move!”

Steve and Tom were right behind them.

The room smelled like cheap cigars, stale beer, and desperation. A half-dozen men froze around card tables, eyes darting, hands hovering over chips and glasses.

“We’re only here for Richie!” Steve barked. “The rest of you can go back to playing gin rummy once we leave. Hands on the table until then.”

Richie Libby barely had time to stand. The uniforms yanked him out of his chair and slammed him against the wall, his nose cracking hard enough to draw blood. He yelped as the cuffs cinched tight behind his back, cutting into flesh and killing circulation.

A patrol car screamed to a stop outside.

They dragged Richie through the door and tossed him into the back seat like laundry. The car peeled away, tires squealing, siren cutting through the morning noise.

“What’s this about?” Richie asked, either playing dumb or still catching up.

“Shut up, lady murderer,” Officer Dylan snapped. “You’ll get your say soon enough.”

⸻

At the precinct, Steve hauled Richie out of the car and shoved him forward every ten steps, steering him like a stubborn mule. They took him straight into an interrogation room that smelled of disinfectant and old fear.

Steve shoved Richie down onto a cold metal chair behind a scarred gray steel desk, its paint layered thick from years of abuse.

Steve shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on the hook by the door, rolling up his sleeves. Tom did the same.

They stood over Richie Libby in silence—two men who already knew the ending—while the uniforms posted up by the door, nightsticks loose in their hands, waiting for permission.

The room hummed.

Richie swallowed.

“Okay, Rich. You can make this easy or you can make it difficult. You threatened Johnny Dietz to stop seeing your property, and he ends up shot in the face. You slap Rosemary around, tell her you own her like she’s livestock, and now she’s found dead in her bed with a .38 slug between the eyes. Same gun, I’ll bet. You’ve been busy.”

He slid a confession across the desk.

“Sign it. Avoid the pain. Otherwise, you’re gonna earn every inch of it.”

Richie’s eyes widened. “Wait—someone killed Rosemary? When was this? I saw her yesterday morning. What the hell happened?”

Steve answered with his fist.

The punch landed hard on Richie’s jaw, Steve’s high school ring biting into flesh.

“Don’t play dumb with me, Libby,” Steve snarled. “There’s a dead woman on a slab with a bullet in her head—and you put it there.”

“No, I didn’t!” Richie shouted. “Why would I? She was my biggest earner. Like a machine—twenty tricks on a good day. It wasn’t me, Foley. You got the wrong guy.”

Crack.

Another punch—this one caught his eye, swelling it fast and ugly.

“I can do this all day,” Steve said calmly. “Save yourself the pain. Sign the paper.”

Tom stepped in, easing his voice down a notch.

“Richie, if you didn’t do it, help us find who did. What do you know?”

Before Richie could answer, there was a knock.

Officer Bryce entered, holding a handgun sealed in a plastic bag. “Found this under the passenger seat of his car. Breech smells like burnt sulfur—recent use.”

Steve nodded once. “Looks like you’re avoiding any more damage after all. Book him for murder one—Rosemary Dole. Get him out of here.”

“That’s not mine!” Richie yelled as they hauled him up. “You’re framing me! I didn’t do it!”

They read him his rights, locked him in a holding cage, and left him bruised, bleeding, and dialing his lawyer with shaking hands.

⸻

Steve buttoned his cuffs and slipped his jacket back on. “That was easier than I expected.”

“I’m heading to the Dietz house,” Tom said. “Break the news.”

He didn’t say what was gnawing at him—that it felt too clean, too sloppy. Richie Libby had been in this game a long time. He didn’t make amateur mistakes.

But the evidence was there.

Maybe it was better to let it go.

1ppdcan,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1ppdcan/who_killed_johnny_dietz_chapters_15/,Who Killed Johnny Dietz? Chapters 1-5,"Chapter 1

Bobby Dietz pushed through the frosted glass door of Tom Hart, Private Investigations, like he owned the joint. He planted himself in front of Beth, Tom’s secretary, and talked at her the way a man talks when he’s never been told “no” and doesn’t plan to start now.

“I wanna see Hart. Got work for him.”

Beth looked him over, slow and unimpressed—like the grandmother who’d rap your knuckles with a wooden spoon just for thinking about giving her lip. She picked up the phone.

“Mr. Hart, there’s a gentleman here who’d like a word.”

She hung up, gave Bobby a look that said try anything and I’ll make you regret it, and waved him toward the inner office.

Tom Hart sat behind his desk, feet planted, eyes alert. Benny Goodman’s clarinet drifted from the radio, soft and easy. When Bobby shut the door behind him, Tom reached over and turned the volume down.

“What can I do for you?” Tom asked.

“My name’s Dietz. Bobby. I need you to find out who killed my brother Johnny.”

“Sit,” Tom said. “Start talking.”

Bobby lowered himself into the chair like it might bite. “Johnny worked for our old man, Ralph. So do I. We keep the stores along Sepulveda from having… accidents. Someone put holes in my brother. I want the name of the hand that held the gun. You give me that, I handle the rest.”

Tom nodded once. It wasn’t much, but it was enough. When a job smelled this sour, he went straight to his best nose on the street: Rusty. A man who lived in alleys, drank like he was allergic to daylight, and knew every whisper worth hearing.

⸻

The Stardust Lounge was baking under the midday sun. Tom pushed inside, grateful for the blast of air conditioning that hit him like a cold hand.

Rusty was at the far end of the bar, coaxing luck out of a one-armed bandit. When he spotted Tom, he jerked his head toward a booth in the corner. They slid into opposite sides, the table between them like neutral ground.

“I need intel,” Tom said. “Fast. Johnny Dietz. Murder. What’ve you got?”

Rusty kept his mouth shut until a twenty landed on the table. Then he snapped it up like a hungry dog.

“A Jane came in yesterday,” he said. “Some off-duty cop was with her—the one who hangs around. She told him Dietz caught a couple slugs in the head for sniffing around where he wasn’t wanted.”

Tom’s eyes narrowed. “The Jane got a name?”

Rusty’s lips twitched. He waited. Another twenty slid across the wood. He grabbed it.

“Rosemary. Rosemary Dole.”

“And the cop?”

Rusty smirked. “Your buddy Foley. Homicide. Guess he found her without my help.”

Tom leaned back. “Forty bucks oughta get me more than two names, Rusty.”

Rusty shrugged. “She said she’s Richie Libby’s girl. Jealous type. Libby’s a loan shark—one of the nasty ones. Foley jots it all down and walks out like it’s Tuesday.”

Tom pushed himself out of the booth. “Keep your ears open and your eyes wider. If I need you again, you’ll know.”

He left Rusty counting his money and the Stardust’s neon buzzing like an angry wasp behind him.

⸻

Tom went back to the office and shut himself in. He told Beth not to disturb him unless it was about the Dietz case. She nodded once—the kind of nod that meant she’d guard that door like a bulldog.

He thumbed through the white pages until he found Rosemary Dole: a second-floor apartment off Vine. If Foley was already sniffing around, Tom would have to move fast.

He pulled up in front of her building—a tired, low-rent flat perched above a drugstore. One look at the block told him Rusty hadn’t given him the whole song. This stretch of Vine was known for women who worked nights and slept through their mornings. Rosemary wasn’t living here because the rent was good.

He climbed the narrow stairs and rapped on her door. Eleven o’clock—too early for a trick, but late enough for her to be awake.

Footsteps. The door cracked open as far as the chain would allow.

“Another cop,” she sighed. “I told Foley everything I know.” She started to shut it.

Tom slid his foot into the gap and eased the door back. “I’m not a cop. Private investigator. Working for Bobby Dietz. You know the name. So… you wanna talk to me, or you wanna talk to him?”

She looked him over slowly, then unhooked the chain.

She wore an old silk robe that had seen better decades. Her hair was bleached blonde in a Marilyn Monroe style, trying hard to shave a few years off the forty-plus she carried in her face.

She crossed the room, poured herself a vodka on ice, and said, “Cops don’t drink on duty.”

“I told you—I’m no cop. Haven’t been one in fifteen years. I’ll join you if you don’t mind.”

She gave him a sly, practiced smile and poured a second glass.

“So,” Tom said, settling onto the threadbare sofa, “who killed Johnny Dietz?”

“Damned if I know.” She took a long pull from her drink. “He was a client for about a year. Richie’s my agent—and my protection. Very possessive type. Once you start with Richie, you don’t get out. Johnny got attached. Happens more than you think. He said he’d take care of me, get me out of the life. Said he’d talk to Richie. Next thing? He’s dead.”

“Did you feel the same way about him?” Tom asked.

Rosemary laughed—a dry, brittle sound. “Take a good look at me. I haven’t been in love since my first abortion at sixteen. But if Johnny was willing to get me out of this life? Yeah, I’d listen.”

“So nothing that pins the murder on Richie?”

“Not a thing. And if Richie did kill Johnny, he sure as hell wouldn’t tell me.”

Tom finished his drink, stood, and handed her his card—folded around a twenty. “If you hear anything, call me.”

She smirked. “For another twenty you get another drink… and an hour in my bed. How about it?”

Tom hesitated only long enough to recognize the familiar tug in his gut. If he had a weakness, it was for professionals—something quick, hot, and meaningless. He dropped another twenty on her dresser.

She took him by the hand and led him toward the bedroom before he could think twice.

⸻

Chapter Two

That night at Johnny Dietz’s wake, Tom showed up in the newest of his three gray suits, hair combed back, white dress shirt buttoned clean under his tie. He looked like a man paying respects, not digging for answers.

Bobby played it that way, too—kept things casual, like Tom was just someone who’d known Johnny in passing. He brought him over to meet Johnny’s widow, Lisa, and their five-year-old daughter, Annie.

Lisa wore a plain black dress, her hair pinned up in a tight bun. She was weeping softly, the kind of quiet grief that seeps into a room more than it sounds in it. On either side of her sat Ralph Dietz, the family patriarch, stiff and stone-faced, and Phil Anzalone—Lisa’s brother, a longshoreman—who held little Annie on his lap, her small hands gripping his shirt.

The room was thick with cigarette smoke and whispered condolences. Tom nodded respectfully, taking in every detail. In a family like the Dietzes, mourning and menace often shared the same pew.

Aievoli Funeral Home was packed wall to wall. The coffin was closed; the gunshot wound between Johnny’s eyes was too messy for even the best mortician to hide.

Bobby worked the room like he was emceeing the Oscars. Tom stayed back, watching faces, reading reactions as Bobby shook hands and accepted condolences. Mob funerals drew all kinds—family, friends, enemies dressed up like friends. Odds were good that whoever put a hole in Johnny Dietz’s head was in the room right now, keeping their mask on.

When Richie Libby walked in with his brother Milo, Tom felt the air shift. The Libby brothers got in line to kneel at the coffin, whispering to each other and chuckling like they were trading jokes. Maybe they found the irony funny.

Bobby didn’t miss it either. His face tightened just enough to show displeasure, but not enough to hint at hostility. If he thought Richie had anything to do with Johnny’s murder, he wasn’t letting it show.

Richie and Milo knelt, crossed themselves, and then moved down the line—Ralph, Lisa, Phil—offering the appropriate murmurs of sympathy. Then they drifted over to Bobby in the corner and spoke with him for a long five minutes, laughing, clasping hands, even hugging him before they headed out the door.

That’s how it was done. You paid your respects, you kept up appearances, and you left—clean, polite, and without telling the truth.

Tom sat in the back, watching and taking mental notes. He was there mainly to see the reaction when the Libby brothers arrived. Richie was a solid suspect early on, but there was still a lot of digging to do.

Two hands suddenly clamped down on Tom’s shoulders. He looked up to see Detective Steve Foley of the LAPD grinning down at him.

“Funny seeing you here,” Steve said.

“Just paying my respects.”

“Didn’t think you ran in this circle. Full of surprises, you are.” Steve’s tone was teasing but edged. “Come on—let’s get out of here. I’ll buy you a cup of coffee. We should talk.”

Tom glanced toward Bobby and gave him a nod. He’d gotten everything he could out of the wake. Whatever Steve wanted to say was bound to be worth hearing.

⸻

They drove to Pan’s Diner off Ventura Boulevard and slid into a window booth, each of them casually scanning the street to see if anyone had followed. As far as they could tell, no one had.

A pretty young redhead approached, pad in hand. Her name tag read Molly.

“What can I get you gentlemen tonight?” she asked, her throaty voice sounding intentionally alluring.

“Two coffees,” Steve said, giving her a slow once-over.

“Sure thing. Must be cops—only cops take up a whole booth for nothing but coffee.”

“Maybe you should be a cop. You’re very observant,” Tom said.

“My dad’s a cop in New Orleans. He told me that’s how you can tell.”

“Let me guess,” Steve added. “You’re out here to be an actress?”

“I’m acting right now,” she said with a wink, heading to the counter for their Joe.

“Who’s paying you, Tom?” Steve asked once she was gone. “From the way you and Bobby Dietz were exchanging glances, my money’s on him.”

They paused as Molly set their coffees on the table and walked off.

“That’s confidential,” Tom said. “But your instincts are usually correct.”

“Tell me some of what you know, and I’ll do the same,” Steve offered.

“I know you were talking with Rosemary at the Stardust. I saw her yesterday. She’s pointing the finger at Richie Libby—called him her agent, not her pimp.”

“Yeah, she told me the same. Definitely a person of interest. I talked to the merchants on Sepulveda who pay protection to the Dietzes. George Zap—owns Zap’s Antique Furniture—tough bastard. Refused to pay since he opened six months ago. Sleeps in the back with a shotgun a couple nights a week. Had his windows smashed twice, last one just last week. Got into a street blowout with Johnny—Zap was shouting he’d kill him if he didn’t back off. Johnny yelling right back that he had to pay. Scared the hell out of the other store owners.”

“So you think it’s Zap?” Tom asked.

“I don’t know. I checked him out. Did time in his early twenties for burglary—second-story man. Doesn’t trust cops. Maybe he’ll talk to you. Just don’t say who you’re working for.”

“I was planning on seeing him tomorrow anyway. Glad you mentioned him—I’ll be sure to turn on the charm.”

“Just make sure you tell me if you find anything that helps my investigation,” Steve said. “You scratch my back, I scratch yours.”

“That goes without saying, pal.”

They talked Dodgers baseball until Steve took the check from Molly and paid at the counter.

“We’ll keep in touch,” Steve said out in the parking lot as they headed for their cars.

Tom nodded. Two suspects now—but still no answers.

⸻

Chapter Three

The next morning the sky was a flat sheet of gray, the kind that made Los Angeles feel borrowed from another city. It was unseasonably cold, the kind of chill that crept under a collar and stayed there. Before heading to Sepulveda Boulevard to talk to the merchants—especially George Zap—Tom parked across from the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels to watch the funeral procession spill out of the church.

Nothing about it seemed unusual at first. The pallbearers moved slowly down the stone steps, carrying Johnny Dietz’s coffin with the solemn coordination of men who’d done this before. They slid it into the waiting hearse, shutting the door on his final ride.

Phil Anzalone came next, cradling little Annie in his arms as if she might break. Behind him, Lisa clung to his arm for balance—her plain black dress and pale face giving her the fragile look of a widow from an older, sadder time. Phil wore a black suit and sunglasses, rigid as a Secret Service agent guarding a head of state.

A photographer from the LA Times tried to edge in for a better shot. He got too close—close enough to annoy the wrong man. Phil threw out a stiff arm like an NFL fullback, knocking the photographer down to one knee. The man didn’t even get out a protest. He just packed up and backed off.

They were a tight family, Tom thought. A bruised one—but tight. Thankfully, they still had each other.

⸻

After the funeral procession pulled away, Tom made his way from Temple Street to Sepulveda.

It was eleven a.m. Dietz Trucking—the corner shop fronting for loan-sharking, narcotics, and extortion—was shuttered tight for the funeral. The extortion end of the business was the reason Tom was there.

He stepped into Leong’s Chinese Laundry, a cramped room that smelled of starch and steam. Henry, the proprietor, was behind the counter working an abacus like he was trying to solve the national debt.

“Mr. Leong,” Tom said, flashing his license. “Name’s Hart. Private investigator.”

Henry didn’t even look up. “No,” he snapped in broken English, eyes wide with alarm. “Leave me alone.”

“I just want to ask if you saw the argument between Mr. Dietz and Mr. Zap.”

“No see. No hear. You go now! I call police!”

Henry was shaking, pale as rice paper. Tom knew fear when he saw it—and this was the kind that came from long-term intimidation. He wasn’t getting anything here.

The butcher and the smoke-shop owner gave him the same cold shoulder.

The Dietzes had put the fear of God into every merchant on the block—every one except one.

⸻

When Tom stepped into Zap’s Antique Furniture, the air changed. It smelled of old wood, dust, and defiance.

“Lousy bums,” Zap barked the second Tom mentioned the Dietzes. “They can all go to hell—especially that fat bastard Johnny. Scumbag got what was coming.”

Tom kept his tone flat. “Talking like that could make you a prime suspect. So let me ask you straight: did you kill him?”

Zap laughed—a sharp, bitter sound. “If I did, you think I’d tell you? I keep a shotgun in the back and sleep here a couple nights a week. Nobody knows when. Let ‘em try something. They’ll be picking buckshot outta their asses. All legal.”

“You’re a tough man,” Tom said. “But the Dietzes don’t fight fair.”

“Neither did the Japs at Okinawa,” Zap shot back. “The Dietzes would’ve shit themselves if they saw what I saw. They want my money? They can damn well come and take it.”

Tom shook his hand. The grip was hard, calloused, and unafraid. “Just be careful, George. And don’t do anything stupid. Here’s my card. Call if you need me.”

“I don’t see why I would,” Zap muttered, pocketing it. “But I’ll keep it.”

⸻

Tom stepped back outside.

The clouds had burned off, and the sudden sun made him squint like it was aiming for his eyes.

Six months in business and Zap hadn’t paid a dime in protection.

Did he kill Johnny Dietz?

Tom hoped not—but he penciled the name in anyway.

⸻

Chapter Four

Tom let a couple of days pass before making his move on Lisa Dietz.

Bobby had told him about her routine—9 a.m. walks in the park after putting Annie on the kindergarten bus. A good time to catch her, a better time to catch her off guard.

She came around the quarter-mile track in sweatpants and a white T-shirt, hair tucked under a Dodgers cap. She walked at a steady clip, the kind of pace people keep when they’re trying to outwalk their thoughts.

Tom stepped toward her just as she finished a stretch.

“Mrs. Dietz? I’m Tom Hart. Bobby introduced us at your husband’s wake.”

“There were a lot of people there,” she said. “I wasn’t in the best frame of mind. I’m sorry—I don’t remember you.”

“That’s understandable, ma’am.” He showed her his badge. “I’m a private detective. Bobby hired me to find your husband’s killer. I just want to ask a few questions.”

She nodded. “If I can help, I will.”

“Did Johnny have enemies? Anyone threaten him? Anything in his life that might’ve gone sour?”

“Detective, if you want to ask about my husband’s affair with that trollop, you can come right out and say it.”

“That would be helpful, ma’am.”

“I confronted him about three or four weeks ago. He didn’t deny it.” Her jaw tightened, voice rising from a simmer to a boil. “He told me they were in love. That he planned on leaving us. Said he hadn’t loved me in years.”

She shook her head, furious at the memory.

“I told him, ‘You’re leaving your family for a prostitute?’ I slapped him. He punched me in the mouth, threw me on the floor, kicked my leg. Screamed that she was giving up the life and they were moving in together. That he’d kill me if I caused trouble. Me—cause trouble.” Her breath hitched, the words breaking loose from someplace she’d kept locked too long.

Tom’s voice softened. “I’m sorry, ma’am. I don’t want to upset you.”

“No. Let me finish.” She wiped her eyes and steadied herself. “A couple days later a man knocks on my door looking for Johnny. When I said he wasn’t home, he asked if he was with ‘that whore.’ I told him I didn’t know where Johnny was. He said she was his property, and he’d kill her if Johnny didn’t back off. He wanted me to know. To be scared.”

“Was he at the wake?”

“He was. Richie Libby. He and his brother Milo—pimps. I hate the life Johnny chose. A lot of phonies. They hug you one minute, shoot you the next.”

“Does Bobby know any of this?” Tom asked.

“I don’t talk to Bobby,” she said sharply. “When I married Johnny, Bobby made a pass at me. I threatened to tell Johnny if he didn’t knock it off. We stayed out of each other’s way ever since. Johnny always called him a backstabber—but they were still brothers.”

Tom knew he’d taken the well as far down as it would go. He handed her his card.

“If you remember anything—anything at all—call me.”

“I will.” She hesitated, then added, “Just remember this: Bobby, Richie, all of ’em—they’re low-life backstabbers. Annie and I… we only have my brother Phil. He’s the one who looks out for us.”

“I’ll keep that in mind,” Tom said.

He tipped his hat, stepped back onto the path, and let her walk off the rest of her ghosts.

⸻

Tom went back to his office.

“Any calls, Beth?”

“Just Steve. Said to get back to him. He’ll be at the precinct until two. Said it’s important.”

“Thanks, Beth,” Tom said, closing his inner door behind him.

He dropped into his chair, slid open the top drawer, and pulled out the flask of bourbon he kept tucked beside old case notes. He took two long swallows, felt the burn settle, and turned the radio on low. Tommy Dorsey’s I’m Getting Sentimental Over You drifted through the speaker like a memory you don’t want but can’t shake.

He dialed Steve’s line.

“Foley,” the cop’s voice came through, rough as gravel.

“It’s Tom. Beth said you called. You got anything?”

“Yeah. Rosemary was found dead in her apartment this morning. Someone put a pillow over her head and shot her through it. Coroner figures around two a.m.”

“A john robbing her?” Tom sat up, tapping a pencil against the desk.

“Ballistics came back. Same gun that killed Johnny Dietz. Everything’s pointing to Richie Libby.”

“You pick him up yet?”

“I’ve got a guy watching him. He’s at Louie Burro’s club on Ventura. Meet me out front in fifteen minutes if you want to be there for the pinch. We’ll question him together.”

Tom hung up, grabbed his coat, and headed for the stairs.

“I don’t know when I’ll be back,” he told Beth as he blew past her desk.

Moments later he was in his sedan, engine running hot. Richie Libby being the one had always been the easy answer.

And Tom had learned long ago—in murder, the easy answer was almost never a sure thing.

Chapter Five

It was a typical Los Angeles morning—the sun already firing on all cylinders, the air warming fast. Seventy-five degrees and climbing, the kind of heat that promised sweat before noon and trouble before dark.

Tom spotted the unmarked cars as he pulled up outside Louie Burro’s social club on Ventura Boulevard. Steve Foley stepped out of a black Chevy Bel Air with two uniformed cops flanking him, faces set, hands already restless.

“We’re ready to collar that scumbag Richie,” Steve said. “Just him. Get him in the car and straight to the precinct. We’ll give him our own brand of TLC.”

The two uniforms and Tom drew their pistols and moved across the street in a controlled jog, adrenaline buzzing just under the skin. The uniforms hit the door first.

“Police! Don’t move!”

Steve and Tom were right behind them.

The room smelled like cheap cigars, stale beer, and desperation. A half-dozen men froze around card tables, eyes darting, hands hovering over chips and glasses.

“We’re only here for Richie!” Steve barked. “The rest of you can go back to playing gin rummy once we leave. Hands on the table until then.”

Richie Libby barely had time to stand. The uniforms yanked him out of his chair and slammed him against the wall, his nose cracking hard enough to draw blood. He yelped as the cuffs cinched tight behind his back, cutting into flesh and killing circulation.

A patrol car screamed to a stop outside.

They dragged Richie through the door and tossed him into the back seat like laundry. The car peeled away, tires squealing, siren cutting through the morning noise.

“What’s this about?” Richie asked, either playing dumb or still catching up.

“Shut up, lady murderer,” Officer Dylan snapped. “You’ll get your say soon enough.”

⸻

At the precinct, Steve hauled Richie out of the car and shoved him forward every ten steps, steering him like a stubborn mule. They took him straight into an interrogation room that smelled of disinfectant and old fear.

Steve shoved Richie down onto a cold metal chair behind a scarred gray steel desk, its paint layered thick from years of abuse.

Steve shrugged out of his jacket and hung it on the hook by the door, rolling up his sleeves. Tom did the same.

They stood over Richie Libby in silence—two men who already knew the ending—while the uniforms posted up by the door, nightsticks loose in their hands, waiting for permission.

The room hummed.

Richie swallowed.

“Okay, Rich. You can make this easy or you can make it difficult. You threatened Johnny Dietz to stop seeing your property, and he ends up shot in the face. You slap Rosemary around, tell her you own her like she’s livestock, and now she’s found dead in her bed with a .38 slug between the eyes. Same gun, I’ll bet. You’ve been busy.”

He slid a confession across the desk.

“Sign it. Avoid the pain. Otherwise, you’re gonna earn every inch of it.”

Richie’s eyes widened. “Wait—someone killed Rosemary? When was this? I saw her yesterday morning. What the hell happened?”

Steve answered with his fist.

The punch landed hard on Richie’s jaw, Steve’s high school ring biting into flesh.

“Don’t play dumb with me, Libby,” Steve snarled. “There’s a dead woman on a slab with a bullet in her head—and you put it there.”

“No, I didn’t!” Richie shouted. “Why would I? She was my biggest earner. Like a machine—twenty tricks on a good day. It wasn’t me, Foley. You got the wrong guy.”

Crack.

Another punch—this one caught his eye, swelling it fast and ugly.

“I can do this all day,” Steve said calmly. “Save yourself the pain. Sign the paper.”

Tom stepped in, easing his voice down a notch.

“Richie, if you didn’t do it, help us find who did. What do you know?”

Before Richie could answer, there was a knock.

Officer Bryce entered, holding a handgun sealed in a plastic bag. “Found this under the passenger seat of his car. Breech smells like burnt sulfur—recent use.”

Steve nodded once. “Looks like you’re avoiding any more damage after all. Book him for murder one—Rosemary Dole. Get him out of here.”

“That’s not mine!” Richie yelled as they hauled him up. “You’re framing me! I didn’t do it!”

They read him his rights, locked him in a holding cage, and left him bruised, bleeding, and dialing his lawyer with shaking hands.

⸻

Steve buttoned his cuffs and slipped his jacket back on. “That was easier than I expected.”

“I’m heading to the Dietz house,” Tom said. “Break the news.”

He didn’t say what was gnawing at him—that it felt too clean, too sloppy. Richie Libby had been in this game a long time. He didn’t make amateur mistakes.

But the evidence was there.

Maybe it was better to let it go.

Tom wasn’t convinced.

Tom pulled up in front of Ralph Dietz’s house and cut the engine.

Ralph had been a widower for more than ten years, ever since the death of his beloved wife, Mafalda—an old Italian name that meant strength. She had been exactly that to him. Mafalda was the mother of his two sons, the only woman he had ever known, ever since the afternoon they were sixteen years old, standing barefoot in her father’s field outside Catania, Sicily.

She was the light of his world.

Cancer took her slowly. Three hard years of fighting a demon that never tired. When she finally lost, Ralph lost too. What it left behind was a man hollowed out and lonely. He stopped socializing, pulled away from people, even from his own sons. They still spoke every day, but the conversations were strictly business—numbers, territory, collections. Anything else felt unnecessary to him.

He was disgusted by what he saw as their weakness, especially when it came to dealing with George Zap. In Ralph’s day, a man like Zap would’ve either paid up or watched his shop burn to the ground. No negotiations. No delays. Bobby and Johnny’s hesitation disappointed him, and Ralph never missed a chance to remind them of it.

The only person who still brought him genuine joy was his granddaughter, Annie.

Lisa brought her by a couple of times a week. Ralph would always slip her some cash, press it into her hand, and say, Buy her something nice. Something that’ll make her happy. Then he’d smile softly and say Annie reminded him of her grandmother.

Lisa had grown close to Ralph over the years. He was steady. Someone she could trust. He didn’t approve of the way Johnny had treated her, but he stayed out of it, saying it was between husband and wife. Still, his disapproval lingered unspoken in the room whenever Johnny’s name came up.

⸻

Lisa happened to be there that afternoon, Annie sitting cross-legged on the living room rug with her dolls, when the doorbell rang.

Lisa answered it.

Tom Hart stood on the porch, his face tight, his eyes carrying the kind of weight that didn’t need explaining. She stepped aside and let him in.

Ralph looked up from the couch, Annie beside him, and met Tom’s gaze.

Lisa led Annie into the kitchen, poured her a glass of milk, and set out a plate of cookies.

“Mommy and Grandpa need to talk grown-up talk with the man,” she said gently.

Annie smiled and dove into the cookies without a second thought.

Lisa returned to the living room.

“They booked Richie Libby for Johnny’s murder,” Tom said, direct and without softening it. “We picked him up at Louie Burro’s club. Earlier that morning, Rosemary Dole was found dead in her bed—a bullet to the head. Same as Johnny. While we were questioning Libby at the precinct, one of the officers found a hot gun in his car. Ballistics say it matches both killings.”

Ralph sat motionless on the couch, eyes fixed on the floor, his face carved from stone. He didn’t ask a question. He didn’t react. He wore the look of a man who didn’t care what happened next.

“The bitch ruined my marriage,” Lisa said bitterly. “She wrecked my family. Johnny liked whores, but he always came home—until she got inside his head. Good riddance.” Her voice shook, but the anger was pure and focused, all of it aimed at Rosemary.

Tom let the silence hang for a beat.

“I’ve gotta be honest,” he said finally. “Nothing about this sits right with me. Libby seemed genuinely surprised when we told him about Rosemary. She was his biggest earner. And he’s not stupid enough to leave a murder weapon sitting in his car like a gift-wrapped confession.”

Ralph didn’t look up.

“But the evidence is ugly,” Tom continued. “Ugly enough to satisfy the department. They’re turning it over to the DA. As far as they’re concerned, it’s a closed case.”

Ralph rose from the couch without a word. He cleared his throat, gruff and tired, and headed into the kitchen where Annie was already working on her cookies.

Tom watched him go, then turned to Lisa.

“I should get going,” Tom said. “I’ll find Bobby and fill him in.”

Lisa hesitated, then nodded, like she’d made up her mind about something.

“Tom… you asked me to tell you if anything strange came up.” She lowered her voice. “Johnny kept a gun in our dresser drawer. For protection. He even showed me how to use it—just in case.”

Tom’s eyes stayed on her, steady.

“I saw it there the morning Johnny was killed,” she went on. “Last night, I heard something in the yard. I got scared and went to get it. The gun wasn’t in the drawer. I searched the whole house. It was gone.”

Tom felt the first real chill of the night.

“You’re sure it was there that morning?” he asked.

“Yes. Positive.”

“And nothing else missing? Jewelry? Cash?”

“No. I checked everything. Annie’s room too. Just the gun.”

Tom nodded slowly. “Anyone else have access to the house?”

“Bobby,” she said, after a beat. “He’s got a key. But we barely speak. I didn’t want to accuse him of anything without knowing.”

“I’m glad you told me,” Tom said. “That gun—was it registered?”

“Johnny bought it years ago. I don’t think it could be traced back to him.”

Tom exhaled through his nose. “That makes it harder. The gun they found in Libby’s car can’t be tied directly to Johnny without a match.”

“So what does that mean?” Lisa asked.

“It means the road just got narrower,” Tom said. “And darker.”

“Unless…?” she pressed.

Tom shook his head. “Nothing yet. Just thinking out loud.”

Lisa walked him to the door. The house felt quieter now, heavier.

“Be careful,” she said.

“You too,” Tom replied.

He stepped outside and pulled the door shut behind him. He still had to talk to Bobby—but first, he needed to see Steve.

And suddenly, Richie Libby didn’t feel like the end of this thing at all.

Chapter Seven

George Zap had finally had enough.

He sat in his antique shop, arms folded, watching the glass man replace his front window—for the third time. The air smelled of dust and fresh putty. This one came with a message the others hadn’t. An unlit Molotov cocktail lay on the sidewalk outside, cradled in broken glass like a threat that had learned how to spell.

Next time, it said without words, we burn you alive.

Bobby Dietz wasn’t a mobster. He was a bully with a last name and a little borrowed muscle. Johnny had been no better—just another spoiled brat riding his old man’s reputation. They were kings to men like Henry Leong and the other Sepulveda merchants, shaking them down while they nodded and paid out of fear.

Zap wasn’t built that way.

The anger had been simmering for months. Now it was boiling over.

When the bag man showed up the next morning, Zap didn’t bother with talk. He stepped out from behind the counter and swung a billy club across the man’s face. Bone cracked. The thug went down hard.

Zap dropped a knee into his throat and pressed until the man gagged, eyes rolling. He racked the shotgun and slid the barrel under the man’s chin.

“Where’s Bobby?” Zap asked, calm as Sunday mass.

“The office,” the man croaked. “Please—please—”

Mercy came in the form of two quick blows from the butt of the shotgun. Zap dragged the man outside like trash, left him bleeding on the pavement for someone else to deal with.

Then Zap started walking.

Up the block. Slow. Deliberate.

The sun caught the edge of his glasses as he squinted ahead, jaw clenched tight enough to grind teeth to powder. Each step carried him closer to the Dietz storefront, closer to the men who thought fear was ownership.

This time, Zap wasn’t paying.

And he wasn’t asking.

⸻

Tom called Steve at the precinct to let him know he was stopping by. He wanted to run a theory past him—something Lisa had said that wouldn’t sit still in his head—but it was the kind of thing you didn’t trust to a phone line.

He pulled up out front and took the stairs two at a time.

By the time Tom stepped into Steve’s office, the case had already flipped on its back and bled out. Whatever Tom thought he was bringing in with him didn’t matter anymore. Steve beat him to it—and then some.

“George Zap’s being brought in on murder one,” Steve said, flat and tired. “His shop window got busted last night. This time it came with a message—unlit Molotov cocktail. Weak warning, if you ask me.”

Tom stopped cold.

“Collector shows up this morning,” Steve went on. “Zap snaps. Beats the hell out of him. Goes full tilt. Then he marches up the block, kicks in the front door of the Dietz storefront with a shotgun, and kills two of their guys—point-blank. No hesitation. Bobby Dietz had stepped out a couple minutes before it went down.”

Tom felt the room tilt.

“When patrol arrived,” Steve said, “Zap drops the gun and surrenders. Guess he realized he’d had his shot at Bobby—and missed.”

“Where’s Bobby now?” Tom asked. His voice didn’t sound like it belonged to him.

Steve shook his head. “Don’t know. We expect him to circle back. Probably running an errand. Cigarettes. Something small. He’s got a habit of showing up right after the smoke clears.”

Steve studied Tom for a second, then added, “So—what was it you wanted to tell me?”

Tom didn’t answer right away.

The pieces were moving now. Fast. And not in the direction he liked.

⸻

Steve’s phone rang, snapping Tom back to the present.

“Bobby’s at the sister-in-law’s house,” the voice on the other end said. “His car’s in the driveway. We wanted you to know before we go in.”

“Tell them to hold tight,” Tom said. “Don’t make a move till we get there. I’ll explain on the ride.”

They piled into Steve’s car, the red bubble light screaming against the morning, tires howling as they tore through traffic. Tom stared out the windshield, the city blurring past in sun-washed streaks. Lisa had told him she barely spoke to Bobby. Now he was parked in her driveway in the middle of the day, while Annie was in school. Nothing fit. Least of all the neat little bow they’d tried to tie around Richie Libby.

The squad car sat across the street when they arrived, engine idling, the smell of exhaust hanging low.

“He’s still inside,” the uniform said.

“Stay put,” Steve ordered. “Don’t move unless you hear from us.”

They crossed the lawn together. Steve knocked, hard and official.

“Police. Open the door, please.”

No answer.

He knocked again, then leaned on the doorbell, his voice rising.

“Everything okay in there?”

Four long minutes passed. The kind that stretch thin and tight.

Lisa finally opened the door. Her blouse was half-tucked, half-forgotten. Her hair looked like it had been brushed in a hurry—or not brushed enough.

Steve’s eyes swept the room.

“What the hell’s going on here?” he asked, already knowing the answer.

Bobby stepped out of the kitchen. His suit jacket lay draped over the loveseat like a confession. His shoes sat by the door, neat and unmistakable.

Tom felt something cold settle in his gut. In this line of work, believing anyone was a luxury—but he’d believed Lisa when she said Bobby was out of her life. He knew better now.

“I want answers,” Steve said, his voice flat and dangerous. “How long has this been going on? Did Johnny find out? Is that why he’s dead?”

“I want my lawyer,” Bobby snapped. “Lisa, don’t say a word. I just came by to talk.”

“I asked you a question, Dietz,” Steve said. “And you’re sounding like a man without a good answer.”

He waved in the uniforms. They moved fast, hands on Bobby’s arms, metal clicking shut.

“Don’t say anything,” Bobby called as they took him out. “Lisa, we weren’t doing anything. It was innocent.”

The door closed. The house felt smaller now. Quieter. Like it was holding its breath.

Tom turned to her.

“All right, Lisa,” he said softly. “You told me you and Bobby barely spoke. Start talking.”

She folded her arms, jaw tight.

“I was furious about Johnny and that whore. I wanted to hurt him back. Sleeping with his brother felt like revenge. Bitter revenge. I hated myself for it—but it was something I had over Johnny, even if it was only in my head.”

“Then why was Bobby still here?” Tom asked.

“I told him it was a one-time thing. He wouldn’t let it go. He threatened to tell Johnny. Ralph too. Even Annie. He thought we’d end up together once Johnny left. I told him it was never happening. After today, I was done.”

Tom nodded slowly. The pieces were shifting again.

“I don’t know what to believe anymore,” he said. “Bobby’s got motive. So do you. And it wouldn’t take much for one of his guys to slip a gun into Richie Libby’s car. This case just blew wide open.”

⸻

Outside, Steve was waiting. Tom caught him up in low tones, then added one more wrinkle he’d been carrying around like a loose tooth.

Steve told Lisa it wouldn’t hurt to call a lawyer. She said she’d call her brother first.

Tom’s eyebrows lifted as he stepped back into the sunlight. The air felt heavier now, like a storm deciding where to land. Whatever came next wasn’t going to make things cleaner—only darker.

Chapter Eight

Meanwhile, Tom’s secretary Beth arrived at the LA City Records and Archives Department at 222 North Hill Street. She carried a briefcase and a short list of instructions: research anyone connected to Johnny Dietz and Rosemary Dole—any name that might matter.

She pushed through the heavy doors of the Los Angeles County Hall of Records, the air stale with old paper and dust that never quite settled. It was late afternoon. The light came in low and tired through high windows, stretching long shadows across the floor.

Beth signed in, exchanged a few clipped words with a clerk, and was directed toward the reading room. Metal cabinets lined the walls. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, uneven and unforgiving.

One by one, the files were brought out. Names. Dates. Addresses. A few arrests that went nowhere. Incidents that never quite made sense. She worked steadily, making quiet notes, her expression giving nothing away.

Most of what she read confirmed what Tom already suspected—or feared. Nothing jumped out. Nothing clean. Just fragments and loose ends.

Then she reached the last file.

Beth paused longer this time. She reread a page, then another. Her pen hovered before she finally wrote something down, careful and precise.

She closed the folder, slipped her notes into her purse, and returned the file without a word. When she stepped back outside, the city was already shifting into evening, the air thick with noise and unfinished business.

She headed back to the office knowing one thing for sure: whatever Tom thought he knew, it wasn’t the whole story.

⸻

Lisa Dietz called her brother Phil the second she locked the door behind the last of them. He came right over, no questions, jacket still on when he stepped inside. They sat at the kitchen table and she poured him a cup of coffee—black, strong—then told him everything. The whole sordid tale, start to finish.

Phil slammed his fist down on the metal tabletop with the force of a hammer. If it had been wood, it would’ve split clean in two. As it was, the dent sat there like a scar.

“Why, Lisa? Why, damn it,” he said, his voice tight. “You told me you had as little to do with Bobby as possible. Now this. I tried like hell to keep you out of this mess, and now you’re standing dead center.”

“You don’t understand what it was like,” she said. “The humiliation. What Johnny put me through. I had to get back at him—had to. I chose the most personal way I could. I know it was a mistake. I see that now. But what do I do?”

“They found the murder weapon in Richie Libby’s car,” Phil said, forcing himself to slow down. “That’s damning. Your thing with Bobby—it’s ugly, sure. The papers’ll chew it up. But it doesn’t tie you to the murders.”

Lisa looked at him sharply. “How did you know about Richie Libby?”

The question hung in the air longer than it should have.

“We hear things on the docks,” Phil said finally. “Guy I work with—his brother’s a cop. That’s all.”

“Phil… what are you going to do now? What am I supposed to do?”

“You call a lawyer,” he said. “Not one of Ralph’s fixers. Call the guy you used when you bought the house—have him recommend someone solid. And until you do, you don’t say another word to anyone.”

She nodded. “Okay. I will. Now go back to work. Let it lie. Don’t get yourself into trouble, Phil. Like you said—everything points to Richie. Let it go.”

Phil didn’t answer. He just sat there, staring at the dent in the table, his jaw clenched. He’d thought Johnny’s death meant his sister was finally free—free of a bad marriage, free of the Dietz grip.

But Bobby changed that.

Nothing was finished. Not even close.

⸻

Nothing was going right for Bobby.

Police tape sealed off the door to his storefront office, fluttering in the afternoon breeze like a bad omen. The place was a crime scene now. No collections. No meetings. No control. Two of his most trusted men were dead, sprawled cold on the floor, and the one man he wanted revenge on—George Zap—was already in custody. Out of reach. Untouchable. Justice, if you could call it that, had stolen his satisfaction.

With nowhere else to turn, Bobby drove to Ralph’s house.

The old man was retired, at least on paper. He’d handed the family business to his sons years ago—an operation he’d built from nothing, brick by brick, threat by threat. It had made him rich, along with a few well-timed stock plays that proved he understood numbers as well as fear. But lately the business was bleeding. Johnny’s weakness for women and Bobby’s talent for screwing things up had turned a slow decline into a free fall. It was only a matter of time before the whole thing collapsed in on itself.

When Bobby stepped inside, Ralph was sitting on the couch, eyes locked on a flickering black-and-white Jimmy Cagney movie. The volume was low, but the violence still came through loud and clear.

“Hey, Pop,” Bobby said, forcing confidence into his voice. “We need to talk. Teddy Boy and Mario were killed this morning. Cops locked up the office—crime scene. I’m in trouble.”

Ralph stood slowly and turned to face him. The look in his eyes wasn’t anger. It was worse. Disappointment. Pure and settled. He slapped Bobby hard across the face. Even at seventy-five, Ralph’s hand still carried weight.

“With your brother’s widow,” Ralph said coldly. “Your dead brother’s widow. What the hell were you thinking? Do you ever think?”

“She came on to me,” Bobby said, rubbing his cheek. “Lisa’s a beautiful woman. I think I’m in love with her.”

Ralph shook his head. “Then maybe it’s better you don’t think at all. It’s over. You stay the hell away from her, you hear me? I’ll cut you off so fast you won’t know what hit you. Streets. Soup lines. That’s where you’ll end up if I hear otherwise. You understand me?”

“Yeah,” Bobby muttered. “Yeah. I understand.”

Ralph exhaled, the edge dulling just a little. “As for the business—I’m putting Tony Shacks in charge. He’s smart. He listens. You do what he tells you. Lay low until the mess you made dies down. Stay in your apartment. Don’t talk to anyone. I got you a lawyer. He talks for you. You got that?”

“Loud and clear.”

Ralph turned away. “You’re a big disappointment to me. Both my sons. Now get out.”

Bobby left with his head down, the sting of the slap still warm on his face. He walked back into a future that no longer belonged to him, knowing the worst part wasn’t what he’d lost—it was that someone else was now deciding how much more he was going to lose.

Chapter Nine

Tom went straight back to the office, the late afternoon light slanting through the blinds like prison bars. He wanted to know what Beth had turned up—really wanted to know. In this business, answers had a way of arriving late, wearing bad shoes.

Beth didn’t waste time. She handed him a single sheet of paper, her expression careful.

“Most of it’s old news,” she said. “Except one name. Read it slow and draw your own conclusions.”

Tom leaned against his desk and read.

Phil Anzalone.

Years back, when Phil was barely shaving, he’d run errands for a low-level mobster named Vinny Bop—nothing glamorous, nothing brave. Stealing cars. Breaking ignitions. Hot-wiring beaters and leaving them cooling in alleyways. When Phil finally got pinched at eighteen, the judge gave him a choice: prison or the Marines.

Phil chose the Marines. The war followed.

He came back changed. Quieter. Sharper. A man who knew how to wait, how to aim, how to finish what he started. And a man who still knew his way around a car lock.

Tom set the paper down gently, like it might explode.

Johnny’s murder wasn’t random. And Rosemary’s wasn’t personal—it was staging. Misdirection. A setup to frame Richie Libby, gift-wrapped with a gun Phil had planted in his car using skills he’d learned years ago on the streets.

Rosemary hadn’t been silenced for what she knew. She’d been silenced because she fit the story Phil needed to tell. Johnny died for what he’d done to Lisa. Rosemary died to close the book on Richie.

Tom felt the pieces lock together, cold and final.

Phil Anzalone had killed them both.

“Good work, Beth,” he said. “There’ll be something extra in your check Friday.”

She nodded. “Are we too late?”

“I hope not,” Tom said—and meant something else entirely.

⸻

Steve was at the precinct when Tom burst in, breath still riding high in his chest.

Steve Foley looked up. “You look like hell.”

“Phil Anzalone,” Tom said. “Car thief as a kid. Marines after that. He had motive for Johnny—what Johnny did to Lisa—and Rosemary was just cleanup. A frame job to bury Richie Libby and close the book. He planted the gun in Richie’s car. Used the same skills he had when he was stealing cars at sixteen.”

Steve didn’t argue. That scared Tom more than if he had.

“Where’s Bobby?” Tom asked.

“Try his apartment. Hopefully laying low.”

Tom was already moving. “We’ve gotta get there. Now.”

⸻

They didn’t know if Bobby would be home. They just took the shot. Sometimes instinct was all you had left.

They heard the shouting before they hit the door.

Bobby’s voice—cracked, panicked. Begging.

The door was unlocked.

Inside, Phil stood too close, a switchblade pressed tight under Bobby’s jaw. His hand didn’t shake.

When Phil saw them, his eyes went flat.

“Back off,” he said. “Both of you.”

Steve and Tom spread slightly, guns drawn, the room thick with sweat and fear.

“It’s over, Phil,” Tom said, steady. “Put the knife down. Walk out of here breathing.”

“He destroyed her!” Phil shouted. “Johnny humiliated Lisa. Treated her like garbage. Threw her away for a whore. Bobby’s no better—using her, threatening her. They’re all the same. They deserved it.”

“Maybe they did,” Steve said. “But killing them doesn’t bring her peace. It just puts you in the ground next to them.”

Phil’s jaw tightened. His grip shifted.

Bobby flinched—and that was enough.

The blade slipped just an inch.

Two shots cracked the air almost as one.

Phil Anzalone dropped hard, the sound final. The knife clattered across the floor, harmless now.

Bobby slid down the wall, alive. Again.

Tom holstered his weapon and stared at the body on the floor. Phil had been a soldier once. A protector. A brother who loved his sister too much to let her suffer alone.

But love twisted into vengeance was still murder.

And murder, in the end, always came with a bill.

Steve called it in. The sirens started wailing in the distance.

Tom stepped outside and lit a cigarette, the smoke curling up into the fading Los Angeles light.

Luck, he thought, was running thin—but it was still holding.

Chapter Ten

Three weeks later, the rain finally came to Los Angeles—like it had been holding a grudge and decided to collect all at once. It hammered the rooftops, turned the gutters into brown rivers, and washed the city clean enough to pretend it had never been dirty.

Tom Hart sat in his office with the lights low and the door locked. The Dietz file was closed, stamped, and shoved into a drawer he wouldn’t open again unless someone paid him to. Richie Libby walked out of county jail with an apology from the DA and a chip on his shoulder the size of City Hall. George Zap took a plea—manslaughter on the two collectors—and would be breaking rocks upstate for the next fifteen. Bobby Dietz vanished quietly; rumor said he’d taken a one-way bus ticket to somewhere east of the Mississippi where nobody knew his last name or cared.

Lisa Dietz sold the house on the quiet, packed Annie into a battered Ford, and headed north. Word was she had family in Oregon who didn’t ask questions. Phil Anzalone got a military funeral—flag on the casket, three-volley salute, the works. The Marines take care of their own, even when their own go wrong.

Tom poured two fingers of bourbon into a coffee cup because the glasses were dirty and he didn’t care. The radio played something slow and sad—Billie Holiday, maybe, or just the ghost of her.

He thought about Phil, standing in that apartment with the knife at Bobby’s throat and nothing left in his eyes but the echo of a war that never really ended. He thought about Lisa, trading one kind of cage for another because revenge felt like freedom until it didn’t. He thought about Johnny and Rosemary, two people who reached for something better and got bullets instead.

Most of all he thought about Annie—five years old, clutching her dolls while the adults around her tore the world apart with their bare hands.

Beth knocked once and came in without waiting. She dropped a thin envelope on his desk.

“From Lisa Dietz,” she said. “Came general delivery. No return address.”

Tom slit it open. Inside was a photograph: Annie on a porch swing somewhere green, smiling like the sun had come out just for her. On the back, in careful handwriting:

Thank you for seeing it through.We’re safe now.Tell him I’m sorry it ended the way it did.—L.

Tom stared at the picture a long time. Then he slipped it into his wallet, behind the private investigator’s license he sometimes wished he could tear up.

Beth lingered in the doorway. “You going to drink that alone?”

He looked at the bourbon, then at her. “Not tonight.”

She nodded once—the same nod she’d given clients, cops, and liars for years—and turned off the outer light as she left.

Outside, the rain kept falling, washing the blood off the streets and carrying it down to the sea. In Los Angeles, that was as close to absolution as anyone ever got.

Tom raised the cup anyway.

“To the ones who get away,” he said to the empty room.

And for once, he almost believed it.",1,1766018649.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

Tons of images at the link

So I finished this a whole lot faster than I expected.  Didn’t think I’d post the final till tomorrow or Friday… it’s amazing how quickly it all comes together at the end.

Anavrin… what can I say about this inaugural venture into your products?  This is my first of them and there are som many design decisions that I absolutely adore.

\* double wall exterior that hides connections

\* internal hidden paints and details for the pleasure of assembly

\* the mirror… only thing that would make that mirror better is if I could somehow have an aged scratchiness or something incorporated into the reflective surface

\* the glass chandelier

\* the tower… omg, the tower

\* the drinking glasses!

I have 2 mods that I’ll boast specifically about.  Both are surface replacements.

\* the underside of the balcony I layered gold leaf foil onto. I aged the foil with a brown water based marker and it added a huge amount of character to the room. Not only the ceiling itself but it has a steamy reflective quality to it right out of the 40s

\* I painted and stained the bottom of the nook.  I layered a black acrylic first then a coffee wood stain on top of it to seal it all together.  I know a strange thing to call out but I think it makes the entire package feel more like a trunk

Now on to the full list of mods

\* painted edges and undersides

\* drum sticks on the drummers seat

\* greenery added to the trellis

\* lights added to the balcony

\* gold foiled the back of the elevator door panel, the light in there isn’t really bright

\* set the red wire “rope” into the wall rather than the wine bottle

\* added an additional speaker wire to the shelf and wall ground floor on right

\* shaved the dust cover by a 1/4 inch as it was too tall for some reason.

\* replaced a number of pictures with my own

\* added additional custom stickers to the exterior

\* colored the band stand poles silver

\* added an external touch sensor (silver circle on top pic) as I carved halfway into the top to get it to work and it still worked wasn’t working….

There will be one additional mod of replacing the battery pack with a wired version, just waiting on the hardware to get here",2,1766018564.0,booknooks,0,1.0,False

1ppd3uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ppd3uq/bookoo_themis_ultra_broken_when_ultra_means/,Bookoo Themis Ultra Broken: When ‘Ultra’ Means Ultra-Frustrating,"I bought the Bookoo Themis Ultra because it’s an expensive coffee scale with a massive following and nonstop influencer love, so naturally I expected basic things like accuracy and durability. Instead, the scale broke within the first 15 days. The weight drifts every time it’s used, sometimes by as much as 5 grams, which completely defeats the purpose of a “precision” espresso scale. Bluetooth connectivity is a joke — it often refuses to connect to my espresso machine at all. To make things worse, Bookoo quietly downgraded the product by replacing the glass top with a plastic one that scratches easily, and they removed the time + weight mode, which is literally how most people use a coffee scale. Paying premium money for a product that loses features and can’t do basic math is honestly impressive in the worst way.

Customer service somehow manages to be even worse than the hardware. In one case, I was asked to provide proof of shipment for an item that was never shipped — apparently I’m now responsible for documenting Bookoo’s packing process. When the scale started failing, support told me to recalibrate it using a 100g calibration weight, as if normal coffee drinkers keep lab-grade weights lying around at home. When that didn’t magically fix their defective product, they offered a refund or replacement but insisted on charging shipping and handling fees for a $100 scale that failed in under a month. Nothing says “premium brand” like making customers pay extra because your product couldn’t survive two weeks of normal use.

The overall attitude from Bookoo is condescending and careless, and it’s clear they do not stand behind their products. This company relies heavily on hype and influencer marketing, because the actual quality and customer support don’t hold up at all. If you’re considering the Bookoo Themis Ultra, learn from my mistake and look elsewhere. A coffee scale should measure weight, not your tolerance for bad hardware and even worse customer service.",1,1766018205.0,espresso,0,0.6,False

She never looks at him. Never speaks to him.

His brother comes over more. Always holding her. Always whispering.

He watches. Jealous. Angry.

But also, relieved. She's not alone.



One evening, they're on the couch. His brother stroking her hair.

She stops crying. Sits up.

""It's been months,"" she says. ""You think people are buying it?""

His brother shrugs. ""I think so.""

She nods. ""Good. We need to wait a bit longer. Then we can…""

His brother kisses her.

She kisses back.

He stands there. Frozen.

They planned this. Together.

He’s shaking now. Rage. Betrayal.

He closes his eyes.

When he opens them, the room is empty.

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

If any of this sounds like your style, feel free to reach out and tell me a little about yourself. I am always open to a conversation.",1,1766018053.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

She has a routine. Same coffee shop every Saturday morning. Same stool at the counter. I never went with her because it was her quiet time and I respected that.

A few weeks ago I tagged along. That’s when I noticed the barista.

He didn’t ask her name. He didn’t ask her order. He didn’t even look at the register. They picked up a conversation mid-sentence like it had been paused, not started. Inside jokes. Light teasing. Comfortable silence.

On the walk back I asked how long she’d known him. She said about a year. I asked if they talk every week. She said yes. I asked why I’d never heard about him. She said it never came up and she didn’t think it mattered.

That answer didn’t sit right.

I asked if they talk about personal stuff. She hesitated. Then said sometimes. Work stress. Family. Relationships in general. She said she mentions me. She also said she avoids talking about our problems because that would be inappropriate. That was supposed to reassure me. It didn’t.

I told her it felt like a gray area. She got defensive. Said not every meaningful interaction is a threat. Said I can’t police her conversations. Fair point. I agreed with that part.

What tipped it for me was when I asked a simple question. Would she be comfortable if I had a weekly one-on-one coffee ritual with the same woman for a year and never mentioned it?

She didn’t answer right away. Then she said she’d “need context.”

Now she says I’m reading into something that’s innocent and punishing her by being distant. I say I’m recalibrating because something feels off and I need time.

I’m not accusing her of cheating. I’m not asking her to stop going. I just don’t feel great about it.

My original hope was to get some part or full time temporary work here to cut my teeth before getting a contract with Gr 9 or up with Socials and English.

In order for me to move up from the TTOC list (which has no hiring rights) I need to have a 6-month temporary position with another one to follow, and an evaluation that is not sub-standard.  I've spun my wheels here (while getting valuable experience) and am ready to find work teaching elsewhere unless I get an interview offer for Jan-Feb for something part time / temporary.  

Moving up the hierarchy to being owed a temporary / continuing job is next to impossible.  I was told that outside of volunteering, finding observations from admin who can speak to your specific teaching standards and experience is the key.  This starts with relationships and establishing rapport.  I spoke with my advisor this morning and he said the same thing;  when I showed him my applications for MakeAFuture for other districts (the majority which were ""no reply - rejected""), he said that despite the collective agreement to publicly post teaching openings, many of them are either spoken for or already promised to those with seniority.  

  
Here's the issue:  I've never been crazy about volunteering at a school or making coffee dates (where I buy) to schmooze or ""kiss a--.""  I'll admit that this is pride talking here - a fair critique.  I just don't want to be tied to a school community outside of my work to the point it drags me from other things that matter.  

I've tried to get observations and people to connect with who could do that in the future, but it really is a crap shoot where it depends 1) if you're in that day - and at the school frequently enough to be observed and engage and 2) is the VP / Principal open and free to observe and evaluate your style to be willing to pass on word of mouth as a referee?

I'm aware that when a situation becomes unsustainable, we can either accept it, change it or leave it.  I can't change it.  I am not hating all aspects of sub work (or the lifestyle), but I'm ready to move on to another district / province / country - and possibly switch career fields where doable if this can't be improved the slightest after I've done all I can in my power.

I graduated in June 2025 at Rotman U of T, and over 8 month of full time experience, did decently well with school, after graduating in finance/Economics and have gotten one interview at one of the big 5 through an internal referral. And almost any Big firms had 0 interviews 0 contact, just constant rejections every single day.

  
I would say I almost did everything I can, except I didn't do grad school nor did CFA level1/CSC. I genuiely have no idea what I could do to possibly get better, I am an international student, and I don't have so many local network, even though I coffee chat/ cold calls/emails and tried to network a lot, just not getting anything back. I just want to have a positions that pays decent and my more than satisfied, and just getting a position is much more important to me than monetary benefits. 

Every single position has hundreds of applicants and I’ve been consistently rejected every week although I’m an M&A analyst at my position right now. But I felt like I will get laid off and just planning to get a better job. 

What can I do more? I sincerely want some advice. 

Sorry I’m just ranting and getting fed up with rejections from positions that I strongly believe I have the qualifications for (and more).

1ppckxe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ppckxe,"an extremely in depth review of all of ariana's fragrances pt. 7: thank u, next ♡̷","hello! i hope you all are doing well <3 i hope everyone is enjoying Wicked season & the holidays too 💚🩷 

here is part 7 of my review of ariana's fragrances! today's scent is the controversial - the polarizing - yet from an iconic and truly unforgettable era: Thank U, Next!

Thank U Next by Ariana Grande (2019)

\* Top notes: white pear, wild raspberry 

\* Middle notes: crème de coconut, pink rose petals

\* Base/bottom notes- macaroon sugar, velvet musk

{for context ........

♡ top notes= light, initial scent of the perfume/""first impression""

♡ middle notes= the heart/core of the fragrance

♡ bottom notes = the overall foundation of the fragrance and lasts the longest}

time of year/season this scent reminds me off: summer 

i'm really excited to talk about this one (i know i say that for every perfume lmfao - but i mean it everytime) but the thank u next fragrance is so polarizing that this one is always so fascinating for me to talk about and to just .....smell 

I remember going into Ulta smelling this when it first came out in 2019. I remember i hated it lol. at the time allllll i could smell was rose. and rose is one of the very few notes i personally struggle with a lot. rose has to be done in a very specific way in order for me to enjoy it. so i steered clear of this fragrance for quite a long time. i actually didn't even own the body mist till last year and just bought a full size of this perfume this year. so i've definitely had quite a journey with this girlie. 

One the most common critiques of this perfume is the scent being reminiscent of pickles/dill. first and foremost i promise you that if you wear this fragrance you do NOT smell like pickles. the pickle vibe only really appears at first sniff when you smell it straight from the bottle, not after it's been sprayed/applied. My theory is that pear and raspberry are such a drastic fruit scent compared to coconut. i think the mix of a tropical fruity note (coconut) with more forest-y fruits (pears and raspberries lol) is a combination that is not typically done. This is in my opinion where that sourness that many describe as pickle-y comes from. anyways, that's why this scent comes across as ""odd"" for a lot of people when they smell it at first.

i actually didn't even smell pickle/dill at all in this for a very long time until people started pointing it out- it always just smelled like a perfume i personally had mixed feelings even before i heard the opinions of others. 

i only really truly started enjoying this scent a couple years ago. I remember it coming out in 2019 and gagging (like gag gag not like purrrr period slay gag) when i first smelled it haha. This was mainly because of the rose note - and rose is a scent I have an extremely complicated relationship with (I will get more into that in future reviews haha). So for yearssss I never even owned this perfume nor did I have any interest in ever buying it. solely because of the rose note and the rose alone. 

Over the years, whenever I would stop into Ulta for whatever the reason was, I would always head over to the ariana section - because it's ariana. lol. So from time to time when I would go and explore Ari's fragrances in store I would still spritz Thank U, Next on me because i WANTED to like it. I wanted to like it sooooo bad, because it was Ari!, because the packaging is pink & pretty , and because i was trying sooo hard to force myself to enjoy rose notes (lmfao). So basically every few months or so I would walk out of ulta smelling like thank u, next and trying to decide for the millionth time how i felt about it.

Finally one random day, this perfume did not smell terrible to me. Lol. at first spritz, my wrist suddenly smells like sour gummy fruity candy covered in gritty sugar crystals. then it smells like coconut sunscreen & a summertime fling, nights at the club in Miami, sweetheart candies and sugar covered rose petals on Valentine's Day. it just finally smelled GOOD. I couldn't commit to a full bottle just yet- so i bought the body mist version and used it as a room spray and ofc as a perfume. this quickly became a summer staple for me. The juicy raspberry and coconut notes blends the vibes of summer out in the country and summer at the beach. the macarons add this flirty, girly, glamorous, sipping coffee outside a pastry shop in Paris vibe to it. 

all in all, thank u, next perfume is a diva- and the people that choose to wear this scent are divas themselves. it's not for everyone- but that is literally given in its title- thank u, next!

if you want to smell like a spoiled, rich princess with a walk-in closet full of hot pink bedazzled clothes - thank u, next is for you. if you also want a perfume that's unique, not commonly worn, and slightly mysterious, thank u next is for you. 

not many people get this scent - but if you get it you get it , and if you don't you don't.

thank u thank u as always for choosing to read any of this at all- especially if you make it to the end!

1ppcg63,https://www.reddit.com/r/EchoesOfFlesh/comments/1ppcg63/chapter_one_emily/,Chapter One- Emily,"*September, 2001, 2:00am*

Emily dreamed, and all around her she saw the turning of some hideous black machinery, wet and organic somehow. She stared across a vast expanse of emptiness and saw Laura, her body shining in the dark like a pale candle. In every dream her form was wrong, frayed around the edges somehow and hard to focus on. She usually appeared as a child, the age she had been when she disappeared, but this time she was the older version of herself she never had a chance to become.

They stood together now, and Emily did not remember closing the distance between them. They were identical except for Laura’s hair, which had turned white in the months before she disappeared, and was now so long it looked as if it had been growing for all the years she’d been living inside Emily’s dreams.

Emily put her arms around her sister and felt the terrible fragility of her body, soft and pliable as if nothing under her skin was where it was supposed to be. She clung to her as if she could hold tight enough to bring her out of the dream with her. She felt her absence as a deep pit in her center, a polished obsidian mirror which reflected only the spiraling void inside of her.

“Where are you?” She cried into Laura’s hair, the soft curls smelled of sickness and something else, terrible and sweet like milk. Laura did not reply, and when Emily pulled away to look at her, her face was gone, replaced by a ruined mound of gore, and her body began to dissolve and fall away in ribbons of flesh.

She awoke with a choked scream, the scent of something antiseptic lingering in the air around her as if the dream had followed her into her bedroom. The smell triggered some far away memory of a doctor’s office, but the thought disappeared almost as soon as it came. She was dimly aware of another smell, a sour metallic stench that she didn’t want to think about.

She sat up in bed, sweaty and disoriented. Putting her hands over her eyes, she tried to remember the last time she slept through the night. Her nightmares began In 1989, the night Laura disappeared from their bedroom without a trace. At age five, the first dream was disjointed and hazy; A flash of empty houses under a strange moonless sky, the silhouette of a tall figure in front of a wall of flames, the feeling of hands pulling her apart, of something under her skin. Now it was 2001, and at sixteen years old the dreams had worsened over time into a vivid and sinister spectacle. 

She sighed and picked up the corded phone on her nightstand, lit a cigarette, and called Elias .

Elias picked up on the first ring, he knew there was only one person who’d be calling this late.

“The dream again?” He asked, though he already knew. Emily had been telling him about the nightmares since they were children.

She tried not to cry. “I don’t know how much longer I can take this shit, Eli, it just keeps getting worse and I’m getting these headaches now too.” She listened to the sound of Elias hitting a bong in the background, it was comforting somehow.

“Fuck, was your sister there again?” He coughed and opened a can of Surge.

“She’s always there now, ever since I started taking those sleeping pills it’s like she’s coming through clearer than before, but she looks wrong and…” She paused as the horrible image came into her mind, “Sometimes her face looks like…how my dad looked when I found him.”

Elias remembered that Emily had told him her father used his shotgun to off himself a couple years after Laura disappeared. He tried not to imagine a pile of ground beef. “That’s so fucked up, man-” He burped and suddenly remembered something, “Hey, that thing you told me you saw in your last dream, I actually found it.”

The light from his computer screen gave his otherwise dark room a soft glow. He clicked around until the image popped up, and the face of a happy smiling cow on the side of a water tower looked back at him.

“Holy shit, the tower is real?” Emily felt dizzy, her sister’s spectral form had pointed to the tower many times in her dreams over the past few weeks.

“Yep, I guess your sister really wants you to find this place. It’s actually not far from here, crazy right? This is some spooky X-files shit for real, man.” He paused and listened to a creak that came from the floorboards somewhere downstairs, and he hoped he hadn’t woken up his grandmother. His parents had lost custody of him when he was a child and he had lived alone with Gram Gram ever since. He continued in an excited, hushed tone, “Get this, the town has some sorta’ geological phenomena that messes with radio signals and other weird shit around it, and back in the ‘70s so many airplanes malfunctioned flying over it that they had to start redirecting all the air traffic to avoid it, and about ten years ago the town was completely evacuated and quarantined due to an environmental hazard.” He said this last part while doing air quotes with his fingers. “Sounds pretty suspicious if you ask me.”

Emily stared into space as she listened, and some faint recognition scratched at the back of her mind. Had she heard of this place before? She didn’t think so. Her cigarette burned in her hand, forgotten.

“The town is called Moonbeam, sounds like some hippy dippy bullshit. We should ditch tomorrow and go there, Jimmy can drive, he’s already here.” Elias looked over at his friend who slept soundly on the floor of his bedroom, he had come over earlier after a bad fight with his father. These sleep overs happened often, but Elias felt like this time was worse.

“Fuck it, let’s do it. I’ll see you guys in the morning, I’m fading.” Her eyes were closing even as she said it, “Thanks Eli, you’re the best.”

He said goodbye and she hung up the phone, falling asleep again as soon as her head hit the pillow. She did not dream again for the rest of the night.

In the morning, she packed her bookbag and tiptoed downstairs, hoping to make it outside without waking her mother. She realized she didn’t need to worry about that, however, as she walked by the living room and saw that she was nodded out on her usual spot on the couch. Emily paused at the front door with her hand on the cold knob, taking one last look at her mother. She was far too thin, and lately her skin had a grey tint that didn’t look good at all. The coffee table in front of her was strewn with beer cans, a lighter, a photo of Laura, and a burned spoon. Emily sighed and opened the door, closing it softly behind her, and made her way down the steps to the van that idled in front of her house. Jimmy and Eli smiled at her through the windows. She smiled back and the image of her mother on the couch was mercifully washed from her mind.",3,1766016409.0,EchoesOfFlesh,0,1.0,False

A NAS, 100.2 proof, bourbon finished in French oak. 2025 seems to be a huge year for French oak finishes, and as a fan of French oak, it’s been pretty awesome for me. Let’s get into it 🥃

👃Nose: maple crème brulee, dark red fruit, currants, vanilla oak - 4/5, Very Good

🥃Palate: first sip is a spike of tannins, but subsides into rich sweet oak. Further sips open into cherry cola and vanilla syrup with some chocolate shavings sprinkled in, late punch of baking spices - 4/5, Very Good

🏁Finish: maple syrup, vanilla cream / mascarpone, berry jam, sweet coffee (like a cafe cubano) - 4/5, Very Good

This is much better than I remember. The first time I tried this (at a bottle share), it felt like drinking whiskey through a rotten wood straw. Finally sitting down with a pour is really letting it shine. This is bold and dark, definitely for fans of DO whiskies, French oak, and Dettling / Glenn’s Creek. ",18,1766016211.0,bourbon,2,1.0,False

So here I am, bravely asking the internet for an accountability buddy.

What I’m hoping we keep each other honest about:

Mind - no incense required ;)
Positive mindset check-ins, swapping book/podcast recs, occasional “wow Mondays are whack” conversations, aiming for progress, not toxic positivity.

Body (fun > punishment)!!
Yoga (vinyasa fan)
Running (trail jogs at Shoreline Park? 10/10)
Healthy food vibes…meal prep, farmers’ markets, new recipes that don’t involve kale every single time (but I love Kale)

Accountability that doesn’t suck! 
Weekly check-ins via text/DM, virtual high-fives for wins, gentle nudges when motivation disappears. Open to occasional in-person things like yoga, a run, or coffee/green juice while we recap our heroic efforts.

I watched 1 from a year ago, about 6 months ago and her last video. 

The common denominator in all 3 videos was the exact same. The main points of the videos have to do with her saying 100 times that she wants to be better about time management and more disciplined. Every video she mentioned many times she wants a stricter routine and to stay on top of her responsibilities. She talks about looking for a new car, actively working with interior designer and being aware of time management. Every video is filled with self pity and excuses along with she forgot equipment to literally do her job. Her MacBook “broke” she went to coffee shop to edit and forgot all her editing stuff. She talks about someone she would never be and it’s the exact person she is today. She seems to make a lot of excuses for herself and have ZERO discipline. She also says in every video she’s going to “start” doing a million things she needs to get better at and how she’s so excited to see her progress. Absolutely nothing has changed in a literal year. 

She talks about the hate she gets multiple times in every video and how much it affects her. She says people are soft and take things wrong. 

I have so many thoughts and I wasn’t going to make a post but this has actually made me do a lot of self reflection. I don’t want to be like that where I say 10x daily I’m going to do better and never do it.

1ppc53b,https://v.redd.it/vfm714qzqu7g1,"Review of Nekajui, November 2025 | An incredible property with the potential to be absolutely world class once service struggles are resolved","Finally have some downtime so getting to lots of reviews I've been delayed on. Thanks for your patience!

I went to Ritz Nekajui for 3 nights in early November ahead of the Four Seasons Preferred Partner Insider Event which was hosted at FS Papagayo (will also do a review on my 5 nights stay there).

The tl;dr on Nekajui is that the hard product and grounds are absolutely phenomenal - it's the highest quality physical product I've seen all year by a mile. That being said, the service really is still struggling and needs investment with the new GM coming in. 

*In my view Nekajui has the potential to be the gold standard of a luxury resort product outside of the Maldives but they have to figure out the service.*

**Background on Peninsula Papagayo and Nekajui**

Of the three hotels located on Peninsula Papagayo, Nekajui, sitting on its prime clifftop perch overlooking a dramatic fall to the ocean below, is the crown jewel. While Four Seasons is a beloved property offering a high quality, family-friendly atmosphere, it's product doesn't begin to match the breath takingly expansive views, dramatic design aesthetic and incredible engineering feat of Nekajui.

—

**Property Information**

Similar to One & Only Mandarina, what makes Nekajui so impressive is it's precarious cliffside perch. But unlike Mandarina, Nekajui has much less land to work with, so to meet the impressive design plans, complicated engineering work was required. Some of these engineering highlights include the amazing suspension bridge that connects the north and south side of the property. As you walk across the bridge, you're at the level of the jungle canopy and below you is a 50 foot drop to the jungle floor. Another is the funicular that runs up from the top of the cliff with the guest rooms and residences down to the beach and beach club offering an incredible view of the ocean and beach as you descend. There's also the Jurassic Park-esque 30 foot rock wall on either side of the path that supports the south side of the resort which feels like you're almost on a movie set as you walk through it. Nekajui also has so many small surprises and hidden areas to explore like the Goonie Caves out by the beach, the hidden lookouts on the hike (featured in my video), the secret jungle pool, the speakeasy and the tented experience.

*Views*

I can't overstate how incredible the views are at this property. Whether you're at the main pool, the spa pool, in your room, walking across the suspension bridge or going down the funicular - the views everywhere are just so fantastic.

—

**Rooms, Suites & Residences**

Nekajui has 107 hotel units: 78 rooms, 26 suites and 3 tents. They also have 36 Residences from 2 - 5 BRs and that one [insane 10 BR that I showed you all that goes for $100,000/night](https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1ozjuxj/come_with_me_to_have_cocktails_in_the_most/).

The biggest takeaway from the rooms and suites is that they are all an identical layout but the difference is the view and location.

*Room Views*

In terms of view, right now there's technically only two view types which are Ocean Vista and Ocean Reserve. Ocean Vista is the direct ocean view with no obstacles and Ocean Reserve is still an ocean view but it has obstacles like trees or part of a building and are more of a partial ocean view. But even within that, there are Ocean Reserves with much better views than others. For example, some of the Ocean Reserve rooms are on the side of building one and basically face the lawn with a teeny sliver of ocean. So they need to recategorize that room. Don't worry, if you're my client - you won't ever get those rooms haha.

*Room Location*

In terms of room location, there's 9 buildings. The closest buildings to the main resort area are 1, 2 & 3 - those are the ones that are more walkable to everything. Then you have 4, 5 and 6 which are on the west side over by the spa and are still mostly walkable. 7, 8 and 9 are the least walkable and you pretty much need to rely on a buggy to get around. You can't guarantee a specific building but for my clients, I'll always make sure we get you in a close one if that's your preference.

*Tents*

The three tents are one of my favorite things at Nekajui. These tents are on the far west end of the resort past the spa and on it's own area of cliff totally secluded from the rest of the resort. The architects of these rooms are is the same group that did the Naviva tents, so there's a lot of similarities. I'll do a separate post on the tents but they are awesome to do for a part of your stay like 2-3 nights. It's a great way to truly disconnect and have a nature-forward experience that feels totally secluded but still have access to the resort. A lot of people will do 2-3 nights there and the remainder of the time in a standard room. This area has a ton of wildlife including the family of howler monkeys living in the trees right - so if you're an animal lover, this is your jam. Everything here feels very Swiss Family Robinson. It's a very special part of the resort. It also has its own beach access.

*Residences*

There are residences of various sizes. The 2 and 3 BR residences are set up in shared buildings with one residence on the bottom and one on the top. The 4 and 5 BR Residences are free standing homes. Both types come with full butler service and a dedicated golf cart. You can't wait from the residences over to the main resort, you have to take the cart. I have specific videos of the Residences that I can share separately if you're interested.

—

**Amenities and Inclusions**

I actually felt good about the included offerings at Nekajui. It doesn't feel nickel and dimey, which is a nice departure from hotels these days. There's a lot of included rotating daily activities with: kayak tours, snorkeling tour, sunset sips with free food and drink on the lawn, they had a huge hospitality suite open with free food and drinks all day during our stay, ceviche making class, mixology class, coffee class, cooking class, yoga, sound healing and meditation sessions. And they are even generous on food and drink options with large portions and random stuff like lattes and cappuccinos coming with free refills (small thing but indicative of a broader theme IMO), and obviously all spa facilities are free to use anytime.

*Spa*

The spa area as a whole is really special. It's absolutely gorgeous as shown in my video with the spa pool, the spa facilities, the gym and everything is so top notch. The treatment rooms for the massages are mini treehouse huts jutting out over the canopy with magnificent ocean views. The actual therapists are incredibly good - I had the best massage of my life there. The gym is fantastic as well. 10/10 no notes.

—

**Sustainability and Build Practices**

One of the things I love most about this property is it's investment and commitment to sustainability and protecting the ecology of the area as much as possible. I'm not going to sit here and say that Nekajui being built was good for the plants and animals of the area. Any new development is incredibly destructive and disruptive to the habitat of the area. But Nekajui went above and beyond in the development process and now in the operational phase to minimize its impact with both deliberate and costly decisions.

*A Few Examples*

\- During development, as they dug up the very rocky, stone-rich cliffside, they took every piece of that stone from the earth and used it back in the building of the resort. In fact, 60% of the materials used to build Nekajui were from the land the hotel sits on. If you look around at the stone used, it has tons of fossils from animals and plants that once lived on Peninsula Papagayo. 

\- They keep everything extremely dark at night. Pretty much all exterior ambient lights are out by dusk. This greatly helps preserve the natural cycles of the bird, monkey and sea turtle populations. 

Other sustainable practices include the fact that they literally have zero plastic at the property. They only use biodegradable materials and enforce that on anyone coming into the property too whether it be a vendor or employee. They also don't do the buffet style breakfast. Instead they have a very robust a la carte menu and have a great ""tray to table"" set up where you can effectively choose a buffet style option but that is still made to order in small batches.

**Tips & Tricks to Making Nekajui Memorable**

Like I've said, I love all the inclusions and options and fun surprises and hidden stuff at Nekajui. Here are my recs for things you have to try:

\- Make sure to book a sunset drink at Ámbar the treetop bar jutting out over the canopy. Do this in advance! You have to get a seating from 5pm-5:30pm for the best sunset view. There's only like 6 tables so reserve before you go!

\- The Piri Piri Chicken Sandwich for lunch at Niri Beach Club is the best thing at the resort (per my bf, I don't eat meat)

\- Go find the secret jungle pool and spend some time there 

\- Do a hike or nature walk to see the howler monkeys

\- Do the kayak tour - it's so awesome to see the resort from the water up on the cliff and to get an expansive view of the peninsula's shore line

\- Reserve a spot at the speakeasy for an after dinner drink one night. It's fun and really well done. But it's super small and intimate so you need a rez. 

\- If you're a couple, definitely go check out the spa pool - it's next level and perfectly tranquil

**The Service**

Ok so...based on everything I've written thus far you must be thinking ""*Alex, this place is a total slam dunk, let's go next week*"". But we still haven't gotten to the elephant in the room: The Service. That's where we run into some legitimate challenges. This is a hard topic for me because I truly love so much about this resort, the team there is fantastic - they have done such a great job in so many ways and I want to support them. But all that aside, I need to be honest and transparent about issues or else I'm not doing my job either as a TA nor as a moderator sharing my luxury travel experiences.

The biggest issues really come down to 1) timeliness, 2) mistakes and 3) an overall service demeanor that at times is incongruent with price point and caliber of the property. It's clear that Nekajui has had trouble finding service talent because there simply aren't enough staff and many of the staff they have don't seem to have the ultra luxe service experience you'd expect. Their service is also in sharp contrast to Four Seasons Papagayo which has impeccable service via their long standing and dedicated staff.

For whatever reason they had some GM turnover and I got to meet the brand new GM, Christian, his first day on the job who I spoke to extensively about the service issues and my concerns - both while I was on property and several times since. He is very proactive and the first one to admit that there are very real issues that he is addressing aggressively. I have strong hope that we will see significant improvements in the next couple of months but I do predict that Festive week is going to be difficult.

Examples of service issues were things like incredibly long wait times for basic table service despite there being few others in the restaurant, forgetting requests repeatedly to the point on one occasion that I ended up getting up and going to the kitchen to get a basic condiment before my food got fully cold, making me the wrong dish from what I ordered on two separate occasions, having to track people down for beach service and poolside service at the spa pool, issues with housekeeping thinking the room was empty and trying to service it twice in the middle of the night (they seem to service some rooms super early in the morning).

All of this being said, there absolutely are highlights with great staff and many cases where the service was good. I also have had numerous clients who stayed here before I went and didn't complain of service issues (some have even written reviews for us in this sub). My brother and sister in law were even there the week before I was and while they had service issues, it was manageable and didn't really negatively impact their experience. But I've also had clients who had much more trouble with the service and who I had to intervene for on more serious issues. So I want to present the full picture. Service can be good, the team is really trying and the energy is there but it's inconsistent and when it's bad it's rough.

—

**Final Thoughts**

I truly believe that Nekajui has the potential to be one of the best luxury resorts on the planet. They already have the location, the hard product, the views, the WOW factor, the amenities, the inclusions, they have it all except that the service isn't honed in. So I'm hopeful that with the new GM they are going to dig in and get the right staff in the door and trained up so that the property can really sparkle as the diamond it is.

*PS if you're a client reading this and you're booked here, I promise I've already talked to the team extensively about your specific stay, ensuring you get prime butler support and we have time for the service to tighten up because I intentionally didn't do any Festive or early winter bookings.*",16,1766015606.0,chubbytravel,5,1.0,False

As he broke the eggs into the skillet, Jim got a look at Caitlyn.  He could tell something was on her mind.  And it wasn’t breakfast.  He wanted to ask her what was on her mind.  But instead, he asked her, “Caitlyn, how would you like your eggs?”

Caitlyn gave Jim a blank look.  He said to her, “Caitlyn, honey.  I was never good at reading minds.”

“I don’t know, Dad.  How should a little girl of six eat her eggs?” Caitlyn asked.

Jim thought of something.  He asked her, “How about scrambled?”

Caitlyn asked Jim, “What’s scrambled?”

Jim let out a laugh.  Then he said, “That’s how I like them.  I fed you eggs before.  They were scrambled.  Remember?”

Then Caitlyn said, “Okay.  I guess I want my eggs scrambled.”

Jim gave Caitlyn a kiss on her cheek.  Then he went back to the stove to tend to the eggs.  In another skillet, bacon.  Chelsea and Lindsay were the next two up.  Jim asked them, “Girls, how would you like your eggs this morning?”

Chelsea answered, “Scrambled will be okay with me.”

Then Lindsay answered, “Scramble mine as well.”

Then Jim asked, “Are Lauren and Valerie still in bed?”

Lindsay answered, “Valerie’s still sleeping.  And I guess Lauren’s still in the bathroom, taking her sweet time, as usual.”

Jim stepped away from the stove as he said, “Lindsay, that’s not funny.  Not funny at all.”

Jim shouted from the bottom of the staircase, “Lauren and Valerie!  Breakfast is ready!  Eggs and bacon and toast for you!  Make your way downstairs, now!  Three girls are already downstairs, and I want to see two more in the next three minutes!”

The radio was on a soft rock station, although there was now a classic country song playing.  Alabama.  *Take me down tonight!*  Right away, Chelsea asked, “Dad, don’t Alabama have a theater down in Myrtle Beach?”

Jim answered, “Yes.  But I’ve never been to it.  I never was much for those kinds of places.  Just the golf, miniature golf courses, fishing, and most of all, the ocean.”

“Have I ever been to the beach, Dad?” Caitlyn asked.

Jim answered, “Yes, honey.  But that was a few years ago.  I don’t know if you remember too much about it because you were a baby.”

Chelsea said, “I do.  It was about a year after…well, you know.”

Jim nodded in agreement.  Then Lindsay said, “I remember.  I found a starfish.  Believe it or not, I still have it.”

Chelsea added, “And a lot of seashells.”

Jim put scrambled eggs and bacon on three plates.  Then he put them on the counter.  Three of Jim’s daughters were at the table.  But there were still two more girls yet to show up.  Jim shouted from the bottom of the staircase, “Lauren and Valerie!  Come on, let’s get moving!  Your food’s gonna get cold.”

Right then, Lauren ran past Jim and said, “Morning, Dad.”

Jim said, “Morning, Lauren.  How would you like eggs?”

Lauren answered, “I don’t know.  Over easy, I guess.”

Then Jim asked Lauren, “Is Valerie still in bed?”

“I guess,” Lauren answered.

Jim made his way upstairs.  He went into Valerie's room (Valerie and Caitlyn had their own bedrooms).  He knocked on the door, even though it was slightly ajar.  When he stepped inside, he saw Valerie.  She was still on the bed, but she was not asleep.  But she was staring out the window.  Like Caitlyn, she seemed to have something on her mind.  Jim said to her, “You heard me call you.  Breakfast is almost ready.  We’re having eggs, bacon and toast.”

“Am I still going to the park today with my sisters?” Valerie asked.

Jim answered, “Yes.  That’s the plan.”

Jim got a look at Valerie, and he asked her, “What’s on your mind?”

Valerie answered, “Dad, I’ve been thinking about Mom lately.”

“What about her?” Jim asked.

Valerie answered, “I keep wondering what she was like.  She died when me and Caitlyn were just babies.” 

Jim said, “Caitlyn was a baby, but you weren’t.  You were four years old.”

Right then, Jim and Valerie heard the doorbell ring.  It seemed like Valerie was hoping no one downstairs would answer it because she was about to find out about Candi.  When Candi was killed in a plane crash, Caitlyn was the only one of Jim’s daughters still in diapers.  As for the subject of that beach trip, it took place the summer after Candi’s death.  Jim took the girls to Myrtle Beach.  Jim took the girls to see his Uncle Bob Claiborne (Wendy’s brother).  He took them on a ride on his charter boat.  Jim did some fishing, but he only caught one fish.  He threw it back into the ocean.  Chelsea and Lauren even fished some, but they did not catch a thing.  On the seashore, Lindsay found a starfish, as well as some interesting seashells.  She kept them.  But more than anything, Jim and the girls were cheered up, which Jim felt was about the most important thing about the trip.

Valerie asked, “Dad, will you tell me about Mom?”

Jim said, “Valerie, when I feel the time’s right, I promise I’ll tell you about your mother.  Caitlyn, too.”

“Okay, Dad.  But can you make it soon?”

“Sure, Valerie.”

Then Caitlyn screamed from downstairs, “Dad!  April Lynn and Julie and Toni are here!”

“Thanks a lot, Caitlyn,” April Lynn said.  Jim could hear it from Valerie’s room.

“Okay, Valerie.  What’s say you and I make our way downstairs, okay?”

Jim and Valerie both got up, and they went downstairs.  Sure enough, April Lynn, Julie and Toni were in the kitchen.  Julie said, “Jim, I can see you all are having breakfast.”

That was when he saw Lauren behind the stove.  She was frying the bacon.  Lauren said, “Dad, I got everything under control.  I can finish if you’d like.”

“Thanks, Lauren.  That’ll be okay.”

As Lauren put the bread in the toaster, Jim said, “Hi, Julie and Toni and April Lynn.  I can make some breakfast for you ladies if you’d like.”

April Lynn said, “Thanks, Jim.  But I had mine.”

Then Julie said, “Thanks just the same.”

Then Toni said, “Thanks, Jim.  But I’ll just have some coffee.”

Jim handed Toni a cup.  He said, “Toni, I’ll have your coffee ready for you in about a minute.”

Jim put a little K-cup of coffee in the Keurig coffee maker.  It was given to him as a Christmas present by Wendy four months earlier.  Jim would never forget that Christmas.  It snowed.  It was the first “White Christmas” for Charlotte since 1947.  It was also the first time Jim made deep fried turkey.  And it was good.  Everyone in attendance liked the turkey.

In about a minute, Toni’s cup of coffee was ready.  Jim asked Julie and April Lynn if they wanted a cup, but they said they didn’t.  Lauren was taking stuff out of the refrigerator to make sandwiches.  Just as Lauren was putting the sandwich stuff on the counter, April Lynn said, “Jim, there’s a change of plans.  Ryan won’t be joining your girls today.”

“How come?” Jim asked.

April Lynn answered, “Ryan said he was going to a friend’s house.  I’m sure they’ll be playing some basketball and hanging out some.”

Jim looked at April Lynn and his daughters.  Then he said, “Okay, April Lynn.  No biggie.  Girls.  I got some eggs and bacon ready.  And I just saw the toast pop up.  I’ll put some on your plates.”

Caitlyn was the first one up from the table.  She made her way to the stove.  She said, “Dad, April Lynn woke me up last night.  I wanna break her neck.”

Then Jim said, “Caitlyn Elizabeth.  We don’t break necks around here.  She woke me up, too.  Don’t feel too bad.”

April Lynn said, “Caitlyn, honey.  Please don’t break any bone in my body.  I am so sorry to wake you up.”

“It’s okay, April Lynn,” Caitlyn said.

Then April Lynn said, “And that goes for the rest of you.”                                  It seemed everyone forgave her.

Then Jim asked April Lynn, “Would you be interested in having lunch with me again today?”

“No thanks, Jim.  I’ll be at my office until one o’ clock.”

“Something up?” Jim asked April Lynn.

April Lynn answered, “I got a doctor’s appointment today.  Just a check-up and some other stuff.”

“Okay, April Lynn.  I hope things are okay,” Jim said.

 

😊

 

There was a reason for that.  April Lynn’s son was born in 1999.  Ryan’s father abandoned her after she found out she was pregnant.  April Lynn dated many men, only to have them leave her.  Her father, Luke Holbrook, died of cancer in 2004.  Those events drove April Lynn out of her mind.  Since childhood, April Lynn had numerous episodes of depression.  When her father died, April Lynn fell into one of the worst episodes of depression she ever had.  She cried uncontrollably.  She kept to herself for about a couple weeks.  She ate little, and she did lose a good amount of weight.  One night, Audrey Holbrook (her mother) found her passed out on the floor in the bathroom.  Those events led her mother, her brother and her sisters to figure something was quite wrong.  It was.  Audrey told the doctors about those traumatic events in April Lynn’s life.  The doctors finally concluded that April Lynn had bipolar disorder.  For years, April Lynn had seen a psychiatrist.  But in recent years, it seemed like April Lynn had done a pretty good job of keeping things under control.  She had not needed to see a psychiatrist for the past year or so.  As for the weight she lost, she got it back, and ate better as well.  Now all she had to do is take medication.

 

😊

 

Lauren had ready some bread and some cold cuts and cheese and the bowl of chicken salad, along with the jars of pickle spears, mayonnaise and mustard.  Jim said to her, “Lauren, honey.  Don’t forget Ryan will not be joining you.”

Lauren said, “Okay, Dad.  How many sandwiches do you think I should make?”

Jim answered, “There’ll be you and your sisters.  There’ll also be Amy’s four kids, that’ll make it nine.”

At that moment, the doorbell rang.  Chelsea answered it.  It was Amy, and all four kids were with her.  Mackenzie, Donnie, Christie and Tiffany Courtland.  Jim said hello to them, and then he asked them, “Kids, what kind of sandwiches would you all like?”

Tiffany, the youngest, was the first to answer.  “Chicken salad’s my favorite.”

Then Jim said, “Okay.  Lauren, make a chicken salad sandwich for Tiffany.”

Then Jim asked, “Christie, how about you?  What kind of sandwich?”

Christie was carrying a canvas shopping bag from Walmart.  The pretty blue-eyed blonde girl said, “Jim, with all due respect, I brought my own lunch.”

Christie proudly pulled her lunch out of the canvas bag.  She said, “I made a salad, and I also brought an orange, a bag of cheese flavored Sun Chips and a Diet Dr. Pepper.”

“Sounds good, Christie,” Jim said.

Then Mackenzie said, “I brought a ham sandwich and Fritos.”

Then Jim asked, “Donnie, how about you?  What kind of sandwich would you like?”

Donnie said, “Lauren, I see you got peanut butter out.  That’s okay with me.”

Lauren said, “Caitlyn likes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  I’m making her one, and I’ll make you one as well.”

“Sounds good to me,” Donnie said.

Then Lauren said, “Donnie, I hope you like orange marmalade.  That’s the only jelly we got.”

Donnie said, “Orange marmalade sounds good to me.”

Then, all of Amy’s kids said altogether, “Thanks, Jim and you girls!”

Jim said, “You all are most welcome.  And I know you are all gonna have a good time at the park.” 

Then Caitlyn said, “Dad, I’m gonna get the cooler out and get the drinks ready.”

“Okay, Caitlyn.  You do that,” Jim said.

Jim and Amy went into the living room.  Julie, Toni and April Lynn were waiting for them.  Julie said, “I want to set up a meeting at the church.”

“Concerning what?” Amy asked.

Julie answered, “I am prepared to supply info about our new associate pastor.”

Amy said, “Good thing, Julie.  We’re dying to know who she is.”

April Lynn added, “And we want background info and other stuff like that.”

Julie said, “You will all find out.”

Then Jim asked, “Julie, when do you want to set up this meeting?”

Julie said, “I got an E-mail from her last night.  She’s leaving Pennsylvania tomorrow morning.  Her son and sisters will be moving here with her.  She probably won’t be in Charlotte until Friday.  We best meet tomorrow evening.  Seven o’ clock be okay with you all?”

Jim said, “Sounds good.  I’m gonna be at the dealership until six tomorrow.  My girls can send out for pizza.”

Then April Lynn said, “Yeah.  Ryan can do likewise.”

Then Amy said, “My kids will be okay.  I’m sure Mackenzie will be glad to work at the bread store some tomorrow.”

Then Toni asked, “Julie, who all will be at this meeting?”

Julie answered, “You all will be there, I hope.  Along with Jeremy, Kurt and Hannah, Vince and Marissa, maybe Randy and Lori, Mark and Kendra, Ashley, Renee, Rachel and Walter, and some more of our friends, I hope.”

Jim asked, “Julie, should I ask Mom and Emily and Charlie to attend?”

“Jim, I think you should.  That’ll be great,” Julie said.

Then Chelsea stepped into the living room and said, “Dad, we’re leaving for the park.”

Jim said, “Okay.  You kids need a ride to the park?”

Lauren answered, “Thanks, Dad.  But I think we’ll be able to manage.”

Jim saw Donnie carry the cooler.  Lauren was carrying the picnic basket.  “You all got everything you need?” Jim asked.

Chelsea, carrying her book bag, said, “I believe we do, Dad.”

Mackenzie and Donnie were also carrying their book bags, and Christie was carrying her canvas bag.  Donnie had to carry the cooler, so he had to carry his book bag on his shoulder.  All the kids stepped out the back door.  Jim walked behind them, followed by Amy, April Lynn, Toni and Julie, in that exact order.  After the kids left, Kristyn Cavanaugh, Mark and Kendra’s youngest daughter, showed up at the house, riding her bike.  Kristyn said, “Morning, Jim.  And morning to you ladies also.”

The ladies waved.  Jim said, “Morning to you, Kristyn.”

Kristyn took off her bike helmet, nearly messing up her reddish-brown hair.  She said, “I may be getting a part-time job soon.”

Amy said, “Really?  That’ll be good, Kristyn.  What kind of job?”

Kristyn answered, “I don’t know yet if I’ll get it.  It’ll be a cashier job at Food Lion.”

“That’ll be good experience,” Toni said.

“I hope you get it,” Jim said to Kristyn.

Kristyn said, “Thank you all.  I hope so”

Then Amy said, “Kristyn, if you don’t get it or if things don’t work out, I can always use some help at the Sunbeam Bread Store.  Please keep that in mind.  I’ll be glad to have you.”

“Really, Amy?  Okay.  Let me see how things work out at Food Lion.  I may come by the bread store later this afternoon.”

“Okay, Kristyn.  I’ll be there until six when I leave the store for a meeting at the church.  Come by the store around five if you can.”

“Okay, Amy.”

Kristyn put back on her bike helmet, and she said, “I better get back to my bike

ride, and try to get into shape.  I’ll talk to you all later.  And Amy, I’ll try to make it to the bread store around six.”

Amy said, “Okay, Kristyn.  You do that.”

Before Kristyn could take off on her bike, Julie asked her, “Kristyn, before you leave, could I ask a favor?”

“Sure, Julie.  What is it?”

Julie answered, “Please have your parents call me as soon as possible.  It’s very important.”

Kristyn said, “Okay, Julie.  I got my cell phone with me.  I’ll call ‘em, and I’ll be sure to tell ‘em to call you.”

“Thanks, Kristyn.  I appreciate it.”

And with that, Kristyn continued her bike ride.  Jim said, “I best get to work.”

Then April Lynn said, “I guess I better go, too.  I got a doctor’s appointment.”

Jim locked up the house, and they all left.

 

😊

 

That afternoon passed without much fanfare.  Jim sold a couple vehicles.  Mark sold a new Chevy truck, which seemed to make him proud.  April Lynn finally closed on that house on Selwyn Avenue she showed yesterday, just before her doctor’s appointment, which she said went well when she spoke to Jim later in the day.

Jim's daughters were home when he got home after work.  Jim decided on spaghetti for dinner.  And with it, salad and garlic bread.  Jim made his spaghetti sauce (something he was very good at), Chelsea and Lauren cooked the pasta and put the garlic bread in the oven, and Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn made the salad. 

They sat down at the table.  Jim allowed Lauren to say grace, and they all started eating.  Jim asked the girls how their day at the park went.  The girls said it went well, and they had a lot of fun with Amy’s kids.  Chelsea, Mackenzie and Donnie spent most of the time studying.  The others played on the swings and slides and playground equipment, and they also walked on the trail some.  Everyone ate all their lunch.  So much so that both the picnic basket and cooler were completely empty when they brought them home. 

Jim said, “Girls, I’m gonna allow you to order pizza for dinner tomorrow night.”

“How come?” Lauren asked.

“Because I won’t be here for dinner tomorrow evening.”

“What’s going on tomorrow evening?” Chelsea asked.

Jim answered, “I gotta meet with Julie at the church tomorrow evening.”

“Anything you and Julie need us for, Dad?” Lindsay asked.

Jim answered, “No.  You girls will be staying home tomorrow.”

“Oh, I see,” Lindsay said.

Then Chelsea said, “I saw Kristyn today after she left this house.  She sure is looking prettier these days.”

“She sure is,” Jim said.

“Why did she stop by the house this morning?” Lauren asked.

Jim answered, “Not much.  Just stopped by to visit for about a couple minutes.  She’s trying for a part-time job.”

“Where?” Chelsea asked.

Jim answered, “Food Lion.  Or maybe the Sunbeam Bread Store.”

Chelsea said, “Either place sounds good for a first job.”

Then Lauren said, “I hope Kristyn does get a job.”

Just as Lauren said that, the phone rang.  After Jim checked the caller ID, he picked it up.  Julie was on the other line.  Jim said, “Hi, Julie.  What’s up?”

Julie said, “Hi, Jim.  I managed to get a hold of everyone.  It looks like we’ll have everyone on hand for our special meeting tomorrow evening at seven.”

Jim said, “That’ll be good.  I just got through telling my girls that I won’t be home tomorrow evening for dinner.  I told them to order pizza.”

“Good, Jim.  I am more than anxious to get the ball rolling on this.”

Then Jim asked, “Did Mark and Kendra get a hold of you?”

“They sure did, thanks to Kristyn,” Julie answered.

Then Jim said, “Okay, Julie.  Then I’ll see you tomorrow evening at seven.”

Julie said, “Okay, Jim.  Please pardon me for interrupting your dinner.”

Jim said, “It’s okay, Julie.  It’s good you called and told me all this.”

“Okay, Jim.  See you tomorrow at seven.”

Jim and the girls watched some TV before they went to bed.  Jim watched the news to see if the weather would still be bad for tomorrow.  The weather said it would rain for the next two days.  After he checked the weather, he went to bed.

 

😊

 

Jim woke up at eight o’ clock the next morning.  Sure enough, it was raining.

Jim ate some toast and drank some coffee before he left for work.  Before he left, he went upstairs.  He went to Chelsea’s bed.  He gently tapped on her, and he softly asked her, “Chelsea, can I speak to you for a minute?”

“Sure, Dad.  What is it?” Chelsea asked.

Jim said, “It’s okay, Chelsea.  We won’t wake up your sisters.  It’s raining outside.  We’ll just let them sleep as long as they like.”

“Okay, Dad.”

Jim took out his wallet.  He took out two bills, a twenty and a ten, and he said to Chelsea, “Listen, here’s thirty dollars.  That should get you girls three pizzas.  There’s a coupon on the fridge for three pizzas for the price of two from Papa John’s.  Get whatever toppings you like, okay?”

“Okay, Dad.  Thanks for the pizzas,” Chelsea said.

“You’re all welcome.  You all be good, okay?  Go back to sleep if you want to.”

Jim went to work.  Business at Queen City Chevrolet was rather slow, probably because of the rain.  And the temperature was not warm at all, around sixty.

Jim left work around six o’ clock.  He went on to the house.  When he got there, he saw Chelsea, Lindsay and Caitlyn watching TV.  Lauren and Valerie were upstairs listening to some music.  “Hi, girls.  I just came by to freshen up some,” Jim said.

Lindsay said, “Hi, Dad.  Chelsea and Caitlyn and I are watching some TV and Lauren and Valerie are upstairs listening to some music.”

Jim said, “Okay.  Have you girls ordered your pizzas yet?”

Chelsea answered, “Not yet, Dad.  But we’re about to.”

Jim said, “Sounds good.  Get pizzas to satisfy all five of you.”

Lindsay said, “Sure, Dad.  You gonna eat after you get home from whatever’s going on at Salem Church?”

Jim answered, “Yes, Lindsay.  I just might.”

Then Chelsea said, “We already talked about it with Lauren and Valerie.  We all agree on three different pizzas.  A supreme, one with pepperoni and hamburger, and one with pepperoni and mushrooms and green peppers.”

“Sounds good,” Jim said.

Chelsea got up and said, “Okay, then.  I guess I better call it in.”

While Chelsea called the nearby Papa John’s to call in the order, Jim went upstairs to freshen up.  After Jim got done, he went back downstairs.  When he got to the kitchen, the pizzas had arrived.  Chelsea and Jim went to the door to get the pizzas.  Chelsea gave Jim the thirty dollars he gave her that morning.  The total cost turned out to be about a quarter shy of twenty-three dollars.  Jim gave the Papa John’s driver twenty-five dollars (the twenty he gave Chelsea and a five he still had in his wallet).  The change was the driver’s tip.  The girls thanked Jim for the pizzas.  Before he left, Jim ate a piece of the pizza with pepperoni and mushroom and green peppers, and he also drank a can of Coke. 

Jim decided to drive the Impala to the church.  When he got there, he saw an assortment of vehicles.  In addition to Jim’s 1968 Impala, there was also Mark and Kendra Cavanaugh’s 1969 Impala, Julie’s Volvo SUV, Ashley’s cute little Mini Cooper, Walter and Kate Faulkner’s classic Mustang, Amy’s Audi, Wendy’s BMW, Vince’s El Camino, Kurt and Hannah’s Mercedes (Jeremy rode with them) and April Lynn’s Dodge Challenger.  But there were two other cars in the parking lot, cars familiar to Jim.  Renee’s late-model Mustang and Rachel’s Lexus were also in the parking lot, with April Lynn’s Dodge between them.  Jim thought, *Oh no!*

Jim parked his Impala next to Walter and Kate’s Mustang.  He went inside the church.  Everyone met in a small room in the Sunday school wing.

Julie started off the meeting.  She was wearing a white blouse with a scarf around her neck, tied to one side, and she was also wearing a black skirt.  Julie pretty much looked like an airline stewardess.  She said she had three announcements.  First off, “I am thinking about starting off some singing groups.  I am thinking about calling them the Salem Church Singers.”  Just the thought of that sent Jim back to one thing…The Salem Church Youth Ensemble.  Julie said, “Details will come later.”

Julie gave the second announcement.  “I am proud to say this.  The next payment to the bank will officially pay off our mortgage.  And I will want to do something special, a ‘mortgage burning’ maybe.”  Everyone seemed to agree.

And the last announcement was the main reason for this meeting.  “Folks, the moment you’ve all been waiting for.”  Julie handed everyone some sheets of paper.  “Folks, this is the info about our associate minister.  There’s also a photo of her.”

Jim got a look at her.  Very light brown hair, blue eyes, about a couple feet shorter than him.  He thought, *Oh my!  She’s pretty!*

 

😊

 

All along, Jim knew about two words.  *Friends and Family*.  And he would always find those two words to be very important to him.  And to those around him.

1ppbs1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Levedence_journal/comments/1ppbs1x/marketing_in_times_of_crisis_companies_are/,Marketing in Times of Crisis: Companies Are Falling Fast (Did You Lay Straw Before You Fell?),"Most companies aren't preparing for the crisis. They're already in it.

If your marketing looks like 2021, your business is already on a countdown. The crisis didn't kill demand. Your targeting did. While you're shouting into markets that will never convert, your competitors are quietly buying out the only audiences that can still pay.

Our sect of marketers has navigated every major crisis of the past two decades. The pattern is always the same: survivors know exactly who can still buy from them. Everyone else burns money reaching nobody and wonders why revenue disappeared.

This is your last warning.

# Part I: You're Already Dying

**The 2025-2026 reality:**

* Consumer spending: contracted
* Ad costs: rising while returns collapse
* Credit: tightening
* Your buffer: gone

The ""spray and pray"" era ended. Companies that waste 60% of their marketing budget won't make it to Q3. Your competitors won't tell you they're struggling. They'll just quietly disappear.

**The fatal mistake:** You're advertising to people who cannot buy from you.

Not ""might not buy."" Cannot. Mathematically impossible.

Like selling winter jackets in equatorial Africa. Nobody laughs because it's too obvious. But here's what's actually happening right now:

**European luxury furniture brand:** $40K/month on programmatic ads reaching students with $200 in their accounts, retirees on fixed income, people in countries where shipping costs more than furniture. Reaching 1M people. Maybe 5,000 could ever buy. They're bankrupt.

**B2B SaaS company:** Selling $50K enterprise software on Instagram and TikTok because ""that's where engagement is."" IT directors buying six-figure software aren't scrolling TikTok for vendors. $25K/month = 3 qualified leads in 4 months. That's $33K per lead for a $50K product. Dead.

**Portland coffee roaster:** Running Google Ads nationally. Shipping kills margins. $85 to acquire customers who buy once for $120. Meanwhile, 300,000 potential regulars live within 10 miles. Almost dead.

The pattern? Marketing to everyone. Reaching nobody who matters.

# Part II: The Two Truths

**Truth #1: Money still exists.**  
Even in crisis, some people have it. Your job isn't hoping you randomly reach them. Your job is finding them deliberately.

**Truth #2: Needs still exist.**  
People in Minnesota still need winter jackets. Mid-sized businesses still need accounting software. Parents still spend on children. The crisis doesn't eliminate needs—it eliminates waste.

Every marketing dollar must pass one test:

**""Is this reaching someone who needs what I sell AND can afford it right now?""**

If the answer is ""no"" or ""maybe,"" you're dead. You just don't know it yet.

# Part III: Cut This Now

Most of your marketing budget is killing you. Here's what to cut immediately:

# Cut #1: Broad Programmatic (NOW)

Unless you can prove—with data, not hope—that your programmatic reaches your specific audience with under 20% waste, kill it today.

Reality check:

* What % of impressions are viewable?
* What % of traffic is fraud?
* What % of real humans could ever buy?

If these numbers aren't exceptional, you're funding the platform's profits while your business dies.

# Cut #2: Wrong Social Platforms (TODAY)

""Being everywhere"" is a branding fantasy from cheap-money years. In a crisis, every channel you keep has to earn its place with profit, not vibes.

B2B selling $50K+ solutions? Cut TikTok and Instagram. Your buyers are on LinkedIn.

Selling to under-30 consumers? Cut Facebook. They're not there.

Local business? You probably don't need any of them.

One question: Is your target audience actively using this platform in a buying mindset?

No = cut it now.

# Cut #3: Geographic Waste (THIS WEEK)

Local business advertising nationally? Stop.  
National business advertising equally everywhere? Stop.

Find where your best customers actually are:

* Highest lifetime value by location
* Lowest acquisition cost by market
* Best conversion rates by region

Everywhere else gets cut or minimized.

# Cut #4: The Rolls-Royce on the Bus Problem

You're reaching millions. Great. How many can afford to buy?

If under 10%, you're wasting 90% of your budget reaching people who will never, ever become customers.

Luxury hotel was advertising on city buses and pop radio. Cut it. Moved to NPR and targeted digital. Cost per lead dropped 70%. They survived.

# Cut #5: ""Brand Awareness"" Theater

In crisis, brand awareness without immediate revenue is suicide.

Every dollar must work now. Cut anything focused purely on impressions, reach, or awareness metrics. Redirect to direct response campaigns with clear ROI.

You can build brand after you survive.

# Part IV: Where Your Money Goes Instead

After cutting waste, you have 40-60% of your original budget. Here's the three-tier allocation:

**Tier 1: Bull's-Eye (60% of budget)**  
People who need what you sell right now AND can afford it.

Channels:

* High-intent search (they're literally searching for you)
* Retargeting engaged visitors
* Email to qualified prospects
* Hyper-targeted social with narrow parameters

This tier generates 80% of revenue.

**Tier 2: Strong Maybe (30% of budget)**  
People who probably need it soon AND probably can afford it.

Channels:

* Content targeting specific problems
* Social to engaged audiences only
* Strategic partnerships
* Educational resources

This tier builds short-term pipeline.

**Tier 3: Future (10% of budget max)**  
Everyone else. Minimal investment. Cut entirely if budget is tight.

# Part V: Real Survival Examples

**Boutique Hotel, Charleston**

* **Before:** $15K/month broad Instagram, Facebook, Google competing with Marriott. 11% occupancy from paid.
* **Fix:** Cut broad ads. Focused on couples 35-55 within 3 hours, romantic getaway searches, Pinterest presence. Budget dropped to $8K.
* **Result:** 34% occupancy from paid. Survived.

**B2B HR Software**

* **Before:** $35K/month to ""HR professionals"" globally. 15 leads/month. 2 customers per quarter. Dying.
* **Fix:** Cut display, Facebook, global targeting. LinkedIn only to HR Directors at 200-1,000 employee companies in 15 metros. Budget $22K.
* **Result:** 8 leads/month but 6 became customers. Profitable. Thriving.

**Phoenix Plumbing**

* **Before:** $8K/month citywide Google, radio, billboards. Low-margin emergency calls.
* **Fix:** Cut citywide. 5-mile radius targeting, specific zip codes, maintenance focus. Direct mail to high-value neighborhoods. Budget $5K.
* **Result:** Lower call volume but higher revenue. Better margins. Survived.

Pattern? Cut broad. Focus narrow. Allocate to where actual customers exist.

# Part VI: Your 4-Week Survival Plan

# Week 1: Audit Everything

* Pull all marketing data
* Calculate real cost per customer by channel
* Make the cut list

If you can't calculate cost per customer for a channel, that channel is automatically guilty until proven innocent.

# Week 2: Know Your Customer

* Analyze your top 20% by revenue
* What do they have in common?
* Where do they actually spend time?

# Week 3: Reallocate

* Pause underperforming campaigns
* Cancel channels that fail the test
* Build Tier 1 (60%), Tier 2 (30%), Tier 3 (10%) campaigns

# Week 4: Launch Focused

* Tier 1 first (highest priority)
* Monitor daily
* Cut anything that stops working immediately

After Week 4: Review weekly. Optimize ruthlessly. No sentiment. Only numbers.

# Part VII: The Hard Truth

**Your metrics will look worse:**

* Lower reach
* Fewer impressions
* Less ""brand awareness""

Good. Those metrics never paid your bills.

**Your competitors won't change:**  
They'll keep advertising broadly. Keep burning money. Keep pointing to vanity metrics.

Until they disappear.

**This feels risky:**  
Cutting channels and focusing narrowly feels dangerous.

You know what's actually dangerous? Continuing to burn money on marketing that doesn't work while hoping it magically starts working.

# The Economic Law

In every crisis throughout history, the gap between efficient and inefficient marketing becomes fatal.

**Good times:** The market is forgiving. Even mediocre marketing survives because money flows freely.

**Crisis:** Only excellent marketing survives. The money stops flowing. Waste becomes death.

The math:

**Broad Marketing (Dead):**  
Reach 1M people → 1% are potential customers (10K) → 2% convert (200) → Cost $100K = $500 per customer

**Focused Marketing (Alive):**  
Reach 50K people → 100% are potential customers → 5% convert (2,500) → Cost $50K = $20 per customer

Half the cost. 12x more customers.

The only difference? Focus.

Companies doing broad marketing in 2021 survived because the economy was growing. In 2026, that inefficiency is fatal.

# The Final Word

In this crisis, 80% of companies will die because they refuse to face the math.

Not because their product is bad. Not because demand disappeared. But because they'll keep marketing to everyone—reaching nobody who can buy—until the money runs out.

Every crisis in history has punished waste and rewarded precision. This one is no different.

Your business can survive. But only if you stop selling winter jackets in Africa and start finding the customers in Minnesota who need jackets right now and can afford them.

Cut the waste. Focus the budget. Survive.

The companies still here in 2027 will be the ones that made this decision in the next 30 days.

*Economic crises don't kill businesses. Unfocused marketing does. If you're still advertising to people who can't buy from you, you're not marketing—you're subsidizing platform profits while your business dies. Stop. Today.*",1,1766014651.0,u_Levedence_journal,0,1.0,False

I drive different routes most days, dealing with HS and screaming MS students.

My district ""rents"" out the busses and drivers to other towns that either don't have enough drivers or don't have busses at all. My district is usually less expensive then contracting with an outside bus company, so we get a lot of trips.

Well today I had the privilege of transporting a HS team to an awards breakfast.

Two of the young lady's hadn't been on a school bus since middle school and were overjoyed with nostalgic, it was pretty heartwarming hearing them speak about it.

Once we got to the venue, which was a hotel, I dropped them off and parked with all the other busses.

After about an hour of being parked the hotel GM came out and invited all of the drivers in to have some breakfast! A full buffet with both hot and cold food. Pastries, cut fruit, doughnuts, eggs, bacon, sausage, bagels, home fried potatoes, coffee, juice, I'm sure I'm missing things, but you get the idea. 

On the way home everybody on the bus was singing holiday/ Christmas songs, including the coaches/ chaperones.

I need to get in better shape and have all ready adjusted my diet as of late hopefully I’ll be in shape in no time!

I enjoy good deep conversations because it’s how I bond with people in general especially someone I have romantic interests in! I am also a very abled bodied independent person so I am not diagnosed with absolutely anything, have my own car, and disposable income. 

You should only consider me if you live in the USA, are ok with me being an atheist/liberally minded person, and I NEVER want children in my life including your own. Otherwise, just understand that I am concrete on what my stances are on those subjects.

1ppbhhy,https://i.redd.it/spqg07ezlu7g1.jpeg,Janna and the Age of Paradox ✦ [SVTFOE s5 / AU] | Episode 8 • Standard Deviation,"***

Angie Diaz talked to her calendar like it was a person who needed reassurance. ""Mariposa to daycare, nine. Swing by La Tienda y Pan—pan dulce for Rafael, always. Marco, mijo, I left you a list on the counter. Don't forget the detergent. The good one, not the itchy one.""

""Copy,"" Marco said, already in shoes and the red flannel he wore when he needed to feel put together.

The cardstock list sat under a paperweight shaped like a little bull. He pocketed it with the seriousness of someone taking a sacred oath and tried not to show how wrecked he still was inside.

The house smelled like cinnamon and soap. Mariposa zipped past with a backpack twice her size, shouting something triumphant about stickers. Angie kissed her hair and shouldered her own bag. ""Text me if you need anything,"" she told Marco, which in Diaz meant: *I trust you and I'm worried.*

He nodded. ""I'm good.""

Janna was already at the counter with a mug, sleeves past her hands, watching steam. She had the compact weather of someone who'd learned to take up less air than she needed. When she looked up, her eyes were easy on him in a way he felt all the way down.

""I'm tagging along,"" she said, no question mark. ""Civics duty. Also I want churros.""

Angie smiled, because Angie always saw what people meant when they didn't say it. ""Watch for carts in the parking lot,"" she said. ""They're wild today.""

The front door closed. Silence reset. The house took a long breath.

Marco glanced at his phone. Star's name stacked down the screen like a deck of cards you keep pretending you're not shuffling. Thirteen missed calls. Twenty-four unread. A few voice notes. He didn't open them. He didn't *not* think about opening them.

Janna slid her beanie down a centimeter and bumped him with an elbow that knew exactly where the edge of him was. ""Panic later,"" she said, gentle by Janna standards. ""We have capitalism to defeat.""

***

In the car, Holly hair clung to the passenger seat like a tiny loyal curse. The sky was a flat plate of November. They fell into the kind of quiet people use when they don't have to prove anything. Traffic moved. Marco's fingers tapped the wheel in a rhythm he didn't recognize until he noticed Janna's thumb spinning the ring he'd seen last night—thin silver band, black track inset, a tiny permission machine disguised as jewelry.

""Tom's,"" she said, catching him looking. ""It spins."" She turned it once. *Whirr.* A soft thread of sound. ""Good for when life is stupid.""

He smiled without meaning to. The muscle of it felt new. ""Copy.""

The sliding doors at La Tienda y Pan sighed open like the store was relieved to see them. Heat puffed out carrying cumin and sugar and the loneliness of produce misters. The automatic welcome chime said *Welcome* in three languages and then a fourth that sounded like an apology.

""Remember the list,"" Marco told himself, and then immediately took a scenic detour in the cleaning aisle because he couldn't remember which blue bottle was the one that didn't make Angie itchy.

Janna walked sideways beside him like a crab, reading labels aloud in a monotone that somehow made even marketing copy sound like a threat. ""Sage mist. Ocean breeze. Hypoallergenic lie.""

He snorted. ""You're not helping.""

""I'm hilarious,"" she said, without inflection. She hooked the right bottle with a fingertip and dropped it in the cart. ""And correct.""

They reached produce. A toddler shrieked at a stack of apples like they'd insulted a relative. Janna hovered her hand above a pyramid of limes as if checking their aura. ""Green,"" she pronounced. ""Very round.""

Marco checked the list. Milk, check. Eggs, check. Detergent, check. The world was doable if you kept it to nouns and checkboxes. He could do nouns. He could not do the texts thrumming in his pocket like a caught fly.

His phone buzzed in a staccato that meant: *Star again.*

""You can answer,"" Janna said, not looking at him, examining tortillas like they were poetry.

He swallowed. ""If I answer, I say something I can't unsay.""

""Then don't answer."" She plucked a pack of corn tortillas with the show-off thumb trick she did when she was pretending not to be anxious. ""Buy carbs. Live a little.""

***

On the other side of the store, in the snack aisle, Star walked between Pony Head and Jackie like a ghost trying to be considerate. She looked at her phone the way you look at a closed door you used to own a key for.

""Girl,"" Pony said, nosing a bag of popcorn that insisted it was healthy. ""You're still texting him? I thought we were in the 'he'll crawl back' chapter.""

""I can't just—"" Star swallowed. Her voice went thin. ""We were us for six years. I don't know how to be me without him.""

Jackie's hand hovered at her shoulder. Kelly put a box of cereal in the cart and then took it back out and then put it back in. Starfan13 narrated a TikTok under her breath. The music overhead tried to be cheerful and failed.

Star typed another message and erased it. Typed again. A voice note, then panic delete. She sent a heart and wanted to die. She sent nothing and wanted to die more.

""Deep breath,"" Jackie said. ""In. Out.""

Star did it badly. ""I'm fine,"" she lied. ""We're fine.""

""And I'm a minimalist,"" Pony said, flipping her hair. ""He's not answering because he's not ready. That's not a crime. Let him marinate.""

""He's angry,"" Star whispered. ""At me. At everything. I can be calm. I can be cool.""

""You are literally vibrating,"" Kelly said.

""I'm fine,"" Star repeated, and looked down into her cart, where a ring ad had planted itself in the corner of her brain and refused to leave.

***

Back by the spice aisle, Marco's phone buzzed again. He flinched. Janna watched the flinch, clocked it, didn't say the thing she could have said. He was a person, not a problem to solve.

""Give me your phone,"" she said.

He blinked. ""What? No.""

""You're going to stare at it and suffer. You're going to answer and suffer. You have not unlocked door number three, which is: let the gremlin do triage.""

""Janna—""

She reached and took it anyway, clean and quick. He let her, which surprised both of them. She looked down, thumb flicking across incoming messages with the calm of a bomb tech. Then she typed.

He craned to see; she turned a fraction, blocking him with an economy of motion that was not unkind.

""What did you say?""

""Don't worry about it."" She hit send. ""Selecting: airplane mode."" She held the power button until the screen went dark. ""Selecting: peace.""

Relief hit him like warm air after a freezer. He let out a sound he didn't know how to categorize and leaned on the cart.

""Okay?"" Janna asked.

He nodded, eyes burning for no good reason. ""Yeah. Thank you.""

""Churros,"" she said. ""Now.""

***

She hooked his sleeve and steered him toward the exit like a tow boat guiding a ship. They cut past the registers into November. The food truck lot across the street glowed in gloaming neon, all steam and tin and the kind of smells that make your body remember you're alive.

Janna put two dollars and a quarter on the counter with a confidence that suggested she had just stolen them from somewhere he would never prove. The vendor twined dough around a stick and dropped it into oil. *Sizzle. Sugar. Paper sleeve.* The world shrank to something manageable.

They sat on the low curb that pretended to be a bench. The sky leaned closer. The first bite burned in the right way; cinnamon hit the back of the throat like Christmas and poor decisions. Sugar dusted Janna's lip like she had tried glitter and found it more useful.

Marco stared at nothing until nothing softened. ""I keep replaying it,"" he said, voice gravel. ""The breakup. What I said. What she said. It's like my head won't stop chewing on glass.""

""Neurotic gumball machine,"" Janna said. ""Checks out.""

""I'm the jerk,"" he said. ""Right?""

""You're a person who reached your limit,"" she said, even. ""Star is a person who doesn't believe limits apply to love. Both can be true.""

He let that sit. The quiet filled them. Traffic hummed. Somewhere a car alarm declared war and lost.

Marco's shoulder relaxed a degree at a time until gravity noticed and did what it does. Without looking at him, Janna slid her hand across the small no-man's-land on the curb and found his. He didn't make a sound, but he let their fingers settle into each other like they'd been practicing offscreen.

Under the truck's awning, Pony Head angled her phone like a pro and framed the two of them: Marco and Janna on the curb, a paper cone of churros between them, heads bowed close. She didn't mean to be cruel. She meant to be messy. She hit FaceTime.

Star's face popped up, too bright through the glass. Pony turned the camera, a little too triumphant. ""Girl, look,"" she said.

Star looked. She went very still. The sound dropped out of the world for a second; the only thing left was the picture: their hands, the sugar, the soft angle of Janna's head tipping toward his.

""Oh,"" Star said, small. ""Okay.""

""Star—"" Pony started, telegraphing an apology she didn't know how to make.

Star hung up. The buzz of the store returned like a punch. She set the phone face-down in the cart and grabbed the handle with white-knuckle hands.

***

Back on the curb, Marco tried to laugh and turned it into a cough. ""We're ridiculous.""

""We're humans,"" Janna said.

""You're... good at this,"" he said, gesturing at air like it would supply a noun. ""Sitting. Not fixing.""

""I'm lazy,"" she said. ""It's a lifestyle.""

He looked at her then. Really looked. The witch-light smirk he expected wasn't there. Something softer was. Something that made a part of his chest he hadn't used in years open like a window.

Her eyes went doe-wide for a second and then narrowed like she'd been caught. Her fingers flexed under his. She didn't pull away.

Something slipped.

He leaned in and kissed her.

It wasn't choreographed. It wasn't even smart. Noses bumped. Sugar granules pressed between lips with a tiny grit that somehow made it better, because nothing perfect survives. She made a surprised sound that opened into him and the second kiss happened because of gravity, because of something older than both of them, because of all the times she had said *smell his butt you'll thank me later*, and all the times he'd rolled his eyes, and because this, when it arrived, didn't feel like a trick.

It felt like a door.

They broke for air. He forgot whatever apology he had queued. She was staring at him with a look he didn't have a map for. He reached up and with the back of his knuckle brushed a streak of sugar from the corner of her mouth.

The curb under them remembered to be concrete.

""Oh,"" she said softly, not a joke. ""Okay.""

The world remembered itself all at once. Someone wolf-whistled from the burger stall and then apologized. The light changed. The churro sleeve collapsed in his hand. They both laughed, shaky and new.

""Marco,"" someone said, and the name came out warped because Star's mouth couldn't decide if it was a cry or a shout.

She stood ten feet away, phone in her hand, hair a little wrong like she'd run. Jackie and Kelly were behind her, Pony Head a guilty moon. Star looked from Marco to Janna to their hands and then back again and something fractal broke behind her eyes.

""You—"" she said. ""You're— I came to get ingredients for a party and you're you're—""

""We were sitting,"" Marco said, uselessly, because what else do you say when the past collides with the present under string lights.

""You were kissing,"" Star said, and the word cracked right down the center.

Janna didn't move. She could feel Marco's pulse in his fingers like he'd handed her a small animal to protect. She made her face blank. It was how you survive.

Star threw her palm out without meaning to. ""Janna, I thought you were my friend!""

""I am,"" Janna said, calm in the way that makes people angrier.

""Then why are you with him— why are you—"" Star's voice turned high and thin. ""Were you waiting? Is this a game?""

""No,"" Marco said. ""Star, no.""

He stepped forward and the look she shot him was so bright and hurt that he stopped. He had never learned how to walk toward pain without making it about him. He didn't know how to start tonight.

Pony touched Star's elbow. Jackie said her name in the voice you use when someone's too close to the edge of a pool. Kelly took a step between them and didn't. Everyone waited to see if the ground would give.

It did.

Marco's face crumpled the way faces do when you run out of rehearsed lines. ""I can't do this,"" he said, and the *I can't* shook. ""I'm sorry.""

Star blinked like someone had splashed cold water into her eyes. ""Okay,"" she said, and it meant nothing and everything.

She turned and walked. Not fast. Not dramatic. Just away. Pony went after her, talking fast and wrong. Jackie and Kelly followed. The parking lot swallowed them.

Marco stood in place a full ten seconds after they were gone, as if that would rewind time. Then his hands went to his hair. Then to his face. He made a sound like a person underwater.

""She hates me,"" he said. ""She hates me, she hates me—""

""She's hurt,"" Janna said.

""Which is worse,"" he said, and started to cry like he was surprised his body could do that. He sat without deciding to, right back on the curb. His shoulders hitched. He put his face in his hands. He was very twenty-something and very young.

Janna's first instinct was to leave him alone because touching people is complicated and she had spent years training herself out of wanting. Her second instinct shoved the first one aside like a mom grabbing the wheel. She moved in, slow, telegraphed, one hand on his back at the safe place between shoulder blades where you can say *I'm here* without demanding anything.

When he leaned into her, she let him. It put his face to her jacket and her cheek to his hair and she did not explode. That seemed noteworthy.

""It's... okay,"" she said, robotic because sincerity always sounded like a script to her. ""I'm here.""

He made a noise that sounded like *thank you* if you translated it.

They sat until crying turned to the hiccup-breathing that always follows. The food trucks dimmed their lights one by one. The sky went from November to night. Heat radiated up from the concrete in tired waves.

""Come on,"" she said at last, and pulled him up with both hands. ""Let's go home.""

***

Inside Star's room the light was the kind that turns everything honest. The photo on her nightstand of three kids pulling faces—Star and Marco and Janna with marker mustaches—stared up at the ceiling.

Star flipped it face-down like that could cancel a spell. She was already crying in the pathetic, angry way where you hate yourself for making noise and make noise anyway.

The group chat was a monster with too many eyes. She typed with thumbs that kept forgetting the alphabet.

Star's chest rattled like an old closet. She typed, fingers with no brakes.

> **STAR:** she's so creepy.
>
> **STAR:** she always has been. poking him. being weird. he could NEVER love someone like her.

The three dots appeared, then vanished. The screen felt hot in her hand. She wanted to pull the words back and couldn't. Before anyone could answer, a little gray bar dropped in like a trapdoor: *Janna has left the chat.*

Star's heart fell through her and hit tile.

> ""Wait,"" she typed, frantic. ""Janna I didn't mean I'm sorry—I just please—""

No reply. A silence shaped like a person who had finally put down the weight they'd been carrying.

Star hit call. The first ring was a lifeline. The second made her panic. Janna picked up on the third, the line filling with the sound of a street.

""Where is he?"" Star said. ""Put him on.""

""No,"" Janna said, even. ""He's tired.""

""What do you mean no? You don't speak for him.""

""He's tired,"" Janna repeated. Not cruel. Not anything. A flat truth you could cut yourself on.

""You're supposed to be my friend! You're horrible! You were always—"" Star's voice broke on the word creepy. She said it anyway. ""You were always creepy and weird and poking him and now you suddenly know what's best for him?""

Silence. Just air. Star heard Janna inhale like she had a hand on the phone and another over her own heart.

""We're done,"" Janna said softly, and hung up.

Star stabbed call again and got voicemail so fast it felt like a slap. She tried to text and the message sat there with a tiny red exclamation point next to *Not Delivered*, as if the phone were being very polite about the end of the world.

Her chest went tight in a way that was medical. She flipped back to the group chat with fingers that couldn't hold onto anything.

> **STAR:** she blocked me
>
> **STAR:** can one of you please
>
> **STAR:** please ask her to talk to me

She opened her Stardrops payroll app without thinking. The ring ad had been living behind her eyes all day. It was stupid. It was something. She put the tiny circle in her cart. She put her whole paycheck in the box that said *Pay*.

She pressed the button like a person jumping from a roof who believes in wings.

When the confirmation screen bloomed she curled around the phone and the space it lit on her pillow.

""Please don't leave me,"" she whispered to no one who could hear it.

***

Marco's front room was the kind of tired that keeps a couch warm even when no one sits on it. They came in with not enough groceries and too much night. Rafael said something about soap operas that translates to *I'm not asking if you're okay because I know you're not*. Angie put a blanket down like she was setting a table and then retreated to the kitchen where teacups live.

Marco ended up exactly where he always seemed to end up this month: on the couch with gravity doing too much and not enough. At some point his head found Janna's shoulder. At some point her hand left its guard position over her sternum and drifted up to his shoulder without permission from any committee.

The TV murmured. The Diaz house hummed the song of houses that want you here.

On the coffee table, her phone lay face-up next to his. The blocked contact at the top still wore an old picture of three idiots being happy. The last words Star would see tonight were the ones Janna had given her: *We're done.*

Janna stared at the ceiling like it had a test she hadn't studied for. She could feel the words Star had thrown at her rattling around, looking for a place to land: *he could never love someone like you.*

It wasn't new. It was just the first time someone had said it out loud in a voice Janna had spent years trying to believe. The sting didn't surprise her. The small, stubborn light under it did.

Marco made a small sound, the kind you make when you're not crying but your body hasn't gotten the memo yet. He edged closer in his sleep. Her cheek found his hair. The ring at her thumb made its small, private sound.

*Whirr.*

""Kalma lang,"" she told herself, the old Tagalog habit fitting her mouth like home. *Keep still. Keep steady. Keep.*

The living room dimmed itself. The night carried on with or without them. In the quiet, the two of them breathed, and the house believed them.

My best friend from college has this one guy friend who is her best friend from high school. I’ve had a crush on him ever since we met years ago but one of us was always in a relationship. Fast forward to last weekend I go out with my best friends’ friend group and he’s there! He lives in NYC (basically) so it’s rare that he’s in our/my area. We hit it off immediately, danced together all night he bought me drinks and we hooked up. In the morning he brought me with him around town and we watched some tv together then football with friends and then I headed home.

The following weekend my best friend and I have plans to go to NYC for a concert and to stay with the guy. He and I both were neutrally excited leading up to this weekend, and the whole time we hung out it was sooo much fun (all 3 of us). The second night we go bar hopping in the city and find ourselves making out again haha. It’s late so he rushes to bring me home… running the streets together, making out every second we could, I slept on his shoulder on the subway and got a couple cute selfies… he looks so happy to be with me. We’re holding hands and everything it felt like a movie. We get home, hook up and pass out.

Next day was kinda weird we all were so crashed out from the night before. We go to the concert, go home and sleep. On the last day when we were supposed to leave the weather was messy so my friend and I decided to stay another night. Mind you at first I told him I COULDNT stay any longer and he was bummed! I said it didn’t matter cuz he had to work anyway. He agreed. Then he CALLED OUT of his shift so I decided hey I’ll stay another night. We held hands and cuddled ALL NIGHT. It was soo cute. Then hooked up one more time. 

In the morning our mutual friend had left and I layed around for just about an hour before heading out. That morning he had come back with a coffee and asked if I wanted a sip, then explained that he had “ordered me one but only had a gift card that didn’t cover both so he canceled mine”… idk if that was him trying to say something. I asked if we could hookup one last time and he said no? That was kinda crazy to me. He carried my bags out and got the snow off my car which took him forever. I said he didn’t have to and he said “oh if I didn’t wanna do it I would have gone in by now”. We kissed a couple times and I left. He told me to let him know that I made it home safe. I did that, and asked for his number which he gave to me. (We were communicating on snap text this whole time, mostly just logistics and 1-2 word flirty texts, nothing big) I then texted him 12hrs later “hi, it’s me, so when we going skiing together?” It’s been 2 days and nothing. He’s active on socials, viewing my story, etc.
 
Mind you all weekend he was saying I was welcome to come back anytime, and multiple times I said we should do this again and he agreed strongly. Not a single moment did I feel he wasn’t interested. I was very expressive of my interest in him.

I fear I have the biggest crush of my life and that he simply isn’t interested, even though his actions up until the texting via phone number had said otherwise.

Any POV is helpful, as well as how I can emotionally detach in a situation like this. It feels incredibly mean of him, and I want to think he gave me the wrong number but I mean, the chances of that are like 0.

Thanks in advance (: looking forward to the thoughts.

1ppbfsi,https://i.redd.it/cl96hc4mlu7g1.jpeg,Trip Report: 12/14 - 12/17: All the Christmas things! (Long),"My wife loves Christmas time. I do too, but I could never love it as much as her. We've gone to Vegas once a year for our industry convention for the past decade in February, but next year they are moving it to Orlando and we are not feeling that. However, we thought Christmas time must be fun in Vegas, so let's do that instead! I watched plenty of YouTube videos and scoured this subreddit for things to do and this is what we put together!


Let's start with the typical stuff.

Hotel: Flamingo 

- I had Caesar's Rewards comps for the room from last trip, so we only paid resort fees and taxes. We got a ""renovated"" room, but honestly it's already due for another renovation. The sink and the shower were pretty ratchet. There were cracks in the bathroom tiles and lots of damage to the corners of the walls, doors, and furniture. View was nice, right across from Ceasars, but that was probably the best part. We only slept in the room though, so it wasn't worth letting it ruin our spirits. However, I don't see myself staying there again, tbh.

- The casino atmosphere was alright. It was never crowded, but they were replacing the carpet every day so there was always a section of it closed off. Bad timing of course, but it smelled like glue in there so it wasnt the most ideal casino to be in.

- I only gambled at the flamingo, and only played craps and slots. Craps was a miss, but I couldn't lose in slots. All the ones I played paid out (Top Dollar, Cash Machine, Phoenix & Dragon Link) and I left Vegas ahead almost about 800, and that was playing lower spins (1-5 bucks). 


Walking the Strip: 


- Overall I felt it was pretty lively. Surely not as crazy as the week before, but there were still a good amount of people walking around day and night. 

- They had pretty much taken the scaffolding down from F1, but that side of the crosswalk in front of the foutains is still closed. Nice to see it going back to normal.

 - Unfortunately, it was sad to see how many unhoused people were on the sidewalks center strip. Way more than I remember seeing in the past. They kept to themselves, but still, its definitely gotten worse and a bit jarring if you aren't used to it.

- The weather was gorgeous in the day time, so it was perfect for walking around and not feeling too hot or cold. But it got cold at night for sure. 

Food: 

Oh man. The foooood. We had 3 reservations for the trip. Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast, Best Friend and Carbone Riviera for dinner and damn, they were good. We also got donor wraps from the Turkish shop in the Grand Bazaar shops. Those things SLAP!

- Mon Ami didnt hold a candle to the other two restaurants but still very solid. 3 drinks total, Crab Benedict, Ham & Cheese Omelet. The bloody Mary was pretty bland, everything else tasted good, but nothing was spectacular, imo. Total after tip was $175. I felt it was a little high for the qualty, but whatever. Great way to start the day.

- Best Friend was fantastic. We ordered the Banchan samplers, Lumpia, Kalbi BBQ, short rib tacos, kimchi fried rice, sake and soju. Honestly way too much food for 2 people - the portions were huge! We got the Lumpia for free, and the total was $160 after tip. I loved the vibe in there, and definitely want to go back again sometime.

- Carbone Riviera was the star though. I got reservations 90 days in advance for a Riviera Deck table at 5pm when they opened. There is a $175pp minimum on the deck (which is really not difficult to achieve given the prices) but they still informed me twice of the minimum anyway. When we arrived we kindly asked for the closest table to the water possible and they did not disappoint. Front and center for the fountains - completely unobstructed view. Getting that table might not have been as easy later in the night, so if you want a prime fountain viewing experience, have an early dinner. It was so close to the fountains, that we could feel a little mist coming down. Probably not a good spot on a windy night, but it didnt bother us.

Now, I will admit, perhaps we went a little overboard, but we followed their suggestions on how to navigate the menu. Here's what we had with my rating (if you ask my wife, it was all 5/5): 

Tuna Calabrese - 4.5/5
Maine Lobster (salad) - 3.5/5
Calamari Fritti - 4/5
Caesar Salad made tableside 5/5
Cappellini Crab AOP - 4.5/5
8oz Filet al Funghi - 4.5/5
Shrimp Parmigiana - 4/5
Complimentary table service and dessert - 4/5
Two glasses of white, then one bottle of red, plus some port for dessert. 4.5/5

Total after tip $720

They have several options on the menu that are better suited for 4-6 people, so if we ever go again, we are bringing friends. I definitely need to try that Lobster Fettuccine 🤤

We skipped the rigatoni. Multiple waiters pointed out that Carbone is famous for it, but said they suggest sticking with seafood because thats what this restaurant is all about. The service was impeccable - quick, informative, and super friendly. The vibe was beautiful, and we left completely and utterly stuffed and satisfied.

Onto the festivities!:

We didnt see any shows or anything like that on this trip, because we were fully entertained by doing all things Christmas! 

As you can see in the photo, we planned quite a bit. I really wanted to squeeze in as much as possible, and somehow, some way, we achieved all the things (aside from Here Kitty Kitty, but it was always a maybe). Here's the highlights: 

We flew in late, checked in, and immediately went to our first stop: Mas Por Favor. They have a speakeasy and its Nighmare Before Christmas themed. The atmosphere was great, and the drinks were too! Our favorite drink was Jack's Hot Buttered Rum. Cocktails were all 18 bucks at there was at least 8 options. We couldn't stay long because they closed, so we walked down to Sand Dollar Lounge. They really, and i mean reallyyyy decked the halls. Easily the best bar we went to. Drinks were so festive (there like 10 options, similarly priced), decor was amazing, and the live band was great! You can buy the mugs that they serve the drinks in. Everyone was having a grand ol' time. We woulda shut that place down if we didnt have so much to do on Day 2. 

The next day, after Mon Ami we walked to the Linq Promenade to check out the Christmas tree and do a little shopping. After that we went to Bellagio and poked our head into the Conservatory. Beautiful on first glance (no surprise) and packed. This was about midday. We agreed to come back before Carbone and took a nap.
We went to Ethel M's next, and that was super fun too! We walked the garden, which was so pretty with all the lights, and then did a chocolate and wine tasting. So so good. Highly recommend. Make sure to show your tasting reservation when you go into the garden because the admission is included AND you get to skip the line. By the time we left it was insanely packed. Going right when they opened was the move for sure. 

After that we booked it to Park MGM for Best Friend, followed by the Mariah Carey holiday pop up bar at On The Record. Honestly, it was very underwhelming. It cost 25 bucks to enter and included one drink. It looked hastily put together, the drinks were ass and in plastic cups, not even full, and there wasn't much to do other than take some photo ops. Disappointing for sure. We didnt stay long and went to our final spot for the night, the Oasis Ice Rink at Foutainebleau.

So I had heard that there was a hack to get free entry for ice skating if you signed up for the players card at FB. I did that and asked the rewards desk if that was true and they said, going up there is free, but you still have to rent the skates. So, the YouTube influencers were wrong on that one. The whole place is really pretty though. Couldn't find any lockers, so you just put your shoes and belongings on the ground and leave em. Not ideal if you are carrying expensive stuff but it wasnt a problem. Skate rentals were 30 bucks. A canned craft beer and a glass of wine was 40 bucks at one of the bars. A good, but imo, pricey experience. The silver lining was that we both got 10 bucks in freeplay for signing up for the card, and we turned it into 30 bucks on a slot so we technically got bogo on the skate rental. 

We started our last day kinda late, and after some holiday coffee drinks, walked to Aria and Cosmo to check out their decorations. Aria Lobby was great as always, Cosmo was not as festive but had some nice trees. We stopped at the chandelier bar and got the famous verbena cocktail. It lived up to the hype. 

Carbone was next, and one of the reasons we wanted the foutain view was because they play Christmas music for the fountain show. Prior to dinner we got a better look at the Conservatory and man, its so pretty!! Truly astounded by how they go all out in there. 

After dinner that was our final stop, Enchant! Im sure you've heard about it enough but it was incredibly fun, incredibly busy even for a Tuesday, the ice skating loop was a nice touch, and the vendors had some great things to get as gifts. My wife did the ice sledding while I recorded her, and also watched a handful of other people eat shit pretty hard, so hang on! Your cash is no good here. Cards only. 

And that was a wrap. By the time we got back to our hotel, it was time to crash out and get up early today and go back home. But we left with plenty of gifts and lots of memories. If you like Christmas, Vegas is a great place to celebrate!!",2,1766013763.0,vegas,4,0.67,False

Current menus here:

You can buy some on Amazon or Ebay!

My menu predates the current menus listed above, that's why it's different!

Pics 1-2 show packaging and contents.

Pic 3 shows the orange beverage base while it was ""reacting"" with the water. No concerns as it tasted great!

Pic 4 is the coffee with creamer and sugar. A great blend and combo!

Pic 5 shows the main! Rehydrated perfectly with about 14 oz of water instead of 16. I let it sit for 15 min, mixing halfway through. This was hearty, beefy, and creamy! Simply a delightful meal! Small bits of mushroom were unnoticeable.  

Pic 6 shows the PB dessert bar! My kid ate this one and loved it. I've had them before and they are great! 

Pic 7 shows the Fig Newtons! You get 2 of them. I love these things so this was a perfect snack!

Pic 8 shows a real surprise item, the vanilla dairy shake! Folks, this thing was 300 kcal of glorious sugar, creaminess, and wonderful sweet vanilla taste! It's not trying to be a protein drink, and it shows. Solubilized easily and was truly one of the best things I've had from a ration. Very sad it's been replaced in newer menus. 

Like I said, a wonderful meal and experience! I wouldn't change a thing about this menu! If you've never tried a MCW, pick one up,  they are great!

I got fired from my job, then my landlord evicted me because I couldn't pay rent for the past two months. I just finished packing all my belongings into my car when my phone started to buzz. I grabbed it out of my pocket to see my friend Colby was calling me. He must've seen the rant I put all over social media. I casually answered ""Yo, whatsup?"" as I attempted to not sound bitter. ""I heard about your situation. I wanted to say you can stay at my place. I'll be on vacation this week, but you can make yourself at home there while I'm out of town."" He explained seemingly in a rush to spit out the words. ""Awesome! Thanks so much bro, I'll head over there in a minute then."" I said with a sigh of relief. ""Also sometimes the power to the main floor will go out and you can find the electrical box in the basement. Just flip the breaker and it should come back on."" He continued ""anyway I'm on the road right now I'll talk to you later man"" his voice followed by a monotone beep. 



	I got into my car and decided I should head to Colby's house so that I can unpack and try to relax after all the stress I had been through lately. I started up the engine and backed out into the road. As I made my way down the road, I thought to myself ""Colby's house should only be a few minutes away."" However, traffic was terrible and nearly doubled the amount of time it should have taken me to get there. Finally as I pulled into his driveway, I felt some relief as I parked my car and got out with a few bags. As I opened the door, my mind goes to memories of the near past. Of college parties and get-togethers things that I found myself longing for again. Closing the door behind me I placed my bags down and started to unpack my chargers and my laptop. I set up everything on a coffee table in the living room at the time. As I sat down to boot up my laptop, I saw the TV mounted on the wall across from me. I got up and started digging the HDMI cord out of my bag, because what's better than watching DBZ on my computer? That's right, watching DBZ on my friend's flatscreen. After I got all that set up I grabbed a quick snack and started watching. I resumed from where I left off. Episode 205, it opens to Sayaiman protecting some civilians from giant flying dinosaurs along with a scene of Videl confronting Gohan about his secret identity. It flashed to the title page saying ""I'll fight too!"" on it. That's when the lights flickered and then went out. Only then had it occurred to me that I'd never actually been in the basement at Colby's place. 



	I paused the episode and decided that it's time I found the electrical box in the basement. I stood up and made my way to the kitchen. On the back wall there is a door opening to a set of stairs which leads into the basement. I shined my phone flashlight into the dark room and quickly found the electrical box stuck to the back wall on the left of the basement. I looked around with my phone and stood there a moment confused. There's a wooden door plastered on the concrete wall across from the electrical box. By the looks of it, it surely didn't lead anywhere. I walked up to it to take a closer look. Despite where I found it, the door seemed quite normal. As I opened it I found a long hallway. Above me were shaded lights that hung from the tall ceiling and spread a low yellow light into the dry dusty hall. The air felt like sand on my skin, a rhythmic echo reverberated through the hall that had slammed into my ears like a wave. It washed away all my pre-conceived notions of my life, all that existed was the desert like hall and my stupified expression. Just as the hall had overtaken all of my vision I snapped back to remembering why I came down here. My whole life flooded back to me like a broken dam. I whipped around expecting to see the basement, yet all that lay before me was more hall. The echoed tune returned in waves, as it waxed and waned. 



	I used all the strength I had left in me against the lull of the rhythmic tone. I urged my muscles to bend to my will as I ran. I was slow and sluggish at first but got used to it. As I was running and running all I could make out was the dusty scent around me and my footsteps under me, yet as I listened my footsteps seemed to double. While I looked behind me I saw a hulking man, he carried a boulder in his arms. He strutted at me slowly with a wide proud smile. I continued to run but it didn’t seem to serve to separate us much, he stood atop no shadow while mine danced behind me. As I ran down the hall another hall appeared out of one of the wall segments, in a quick decision I took off down the side hall. I can still hear that things steps thudding behind me.  Turn after turn the hulking creatures' steps remained consistent behind me. I've heard that in a maze you should follow the left wall so that's what I did. 

	

	Up ahead I could see a boundary separating the part of the hall I was in and one in which the lights are dimmed and the wall and floors a darker color. Just before the boundary line a small, bald and saggy fleshed hag with marbled eyes is crouched facing the left wall. It traces its fleshy stub of a finger across a bloodstained P on the wall mumbling, all I could make out were the words. ""The mount under virtuous stars”. Just like the hulking man behind me the ground under this hag was missing its shadow. As I crossed the border line I looked back to see the hulking man's smile somehow grow wider, impossibly wide. The moment he stepped over the boundary the boulder dropped from his hands shaking the ground. In one awful split second he lunged, faster than before he bound down the darkened hall slowly gaining on me. I took another left turn, looking back as soon as the hulking man turned the corner behind me. Two creatures jump upon the hulking man similar in shape to the hags, but their skin is missing leaving large spaces on the surface of their bodies as exposed flesh. Patches of skin and features dot their bodies seemingly slapped on in a stable but mangled manner. Overtop their faces one wears a mask made from the skin of a woman's face their eye holes sown shut with copper wire. The other bore a skinless and bleeding face bearing the same copper wire holding its eyes firmly shut. Just as the first fleshy hand wetly made contact with the man the two creatures proceeded to tear the skin off the man and slap the skin onto their own bodies. The one without a face mask slaps the man's prideful smile onto its own previously exposed face. I continued to run as fast as I could down the halls, left turn after left turn. A small scuttling noise followed quietly behind me. The two creatures from before leap from shadow to shadow in the light they lack their own. They slowly trace my path behind me like how a wolf hunts a deer. Keeping my eyes in front of me, left turn on left turn I noticed something repeating on the ground written in dried blood stains were the repeated words ""Turn away from your desire"". The words only served to add an extra layer of confusion to all of this on top of the nauseating state of my mind. Up the hall crouched down by the left wall just before a wall of blackish ash-like fog sits another hag tracing another P onto the wall. It seems that the other creatures in this fucked up complex pay no heed to the sagging hags. 



	As I crossed the boundary the fog carried the stench of iron mixed with dry ash. I could only see a matter of feet in front of me but I couldn't stop running. I stuck my hand out to the left wall and continued to run down the left halls. I could still hear their scuttling behind me, but now they carried on with frustrated grunt-like noises. Their grunts mix in with murmurs that seep through the foggy walls words like, ""The lamb of god, the bloodied sacrifice"" lined behind the growing noises of angry grunts and sobs followed by flesh tearing like fabric. As the hopelessness of my situation set into me, I pushed it out of my mind. I had no way of knowing how or why this had happened and I could feel my memory slowly vacating my mind. I decided that in my current state the best  thing I could do is keep turning left so that's what I did. I didn’t know if it would lead me out but anywhere would’ve been better. Just as I could feel my mind giving way to the horrible groaning and sobbing whispers, I see the hag in front of me. It's the first and only time I've been happy to see something so ugly drawing another bloody P on the left wall. I crossed the border line with no hesitation. 



	Being out of the fog did nearly nothing to fix the damage it had done to my mind. Continuing my desperate sprint down the halls my shadow looked lighter than before but it still stood in contrast to the creatures that now dotted different halls and areas I passed by. They all bore a great resemblance to a regular person unlike the things following me. These things had fully regular human bodies, their eyes sown open as they dead sprinted down halls never stopping for a moment. The ones that passed by me seemed to have only supplied the creatures following me with more skin and faces to work with. They ran and ran and so did I. My brain could only handle focusing on one thing, the stench. It stinks of rot and body odor mixed with salt, with every breath came a subsequent gag. The sounds of the running steps echoed all around me and mixed with the scuttling of the creatures behind me. For but a moment the echoing lullaby that led me into that first hall rings through the halls. Granting my mind a short reprieve from reality as the tonal rhythm rung through my mind erasing all my senses before dunking it back into the cold stenchfull nightmare. I had to keep running, no matter how tired I was I couldn't stop. A wave of relief flowed through my legs as a portion of the tiredness fled my body, as I passed another hag tracing another bloody P on another wall and I crossed another boundary. 



	The material makeup of the walls and floor seemed to change into a pasty tannish colored substance. It squished giving way as I stepped down onto the floor under me. Ahead of me lying embedded into the fleshy floor were mouths and eyes and noses, twitching and writhing they murmured of lost treasures and standings. They begged God to remember a promise never made. The things still scuttling behind me had amassed piles of pieces of skin that they carried on their backs. As they tore more pieces off the floor and walls, stripping away whatever these formless faces might have had left. The mouths on the floors and walls screamed in agony filling my mind at the same time that the scent of their mangled flesh and blood hit my senses like a truck. The whole hall shook like an earthquake as the gargled screams of one of the mouths formed into words ""Your own Virgil has led you down the mountain!"". Another question for if I ever got out of that place and another haunting memory for my collapsing mind. Just keep turning left, Just keep turning left. Repeated in my mind consuming all my thoughts but one, “I can't remember how I got here”. I saw the hag as always crouched by the left wall before another boundary. I gained no sense of relief from knowing I'm moving forward but all I knew was I needed to keep going. The scent of a pigsty and animal hair slammed into me as I crossed the boundary line. 



	The walls are no longer made of flesh here. I ran past Hogs with sagging and bulbous fleshy bodies, the nape of their neck bore a red fruit. One of the hogs uselessly struggled to try and fail at eating the fruit that grew from its own neck and head. As another ran into it tearing the fruit and flesh from the nape of the hogs neck and greedily devoured the blood and flesh covered fruits. The creatures behind me took the fruits off the dead hogs they killed and ate them as I passed by more and more hoards of hogs. The creatures bit into the fruits and for a moment they spoke the words. ""do not heed the beast, do not heed its call to the pit"" before returning to their usual posture and incessant tracking of me. I was starting to get tired of the cryptic language that place spoke. I don't understand anything about that place, all I knew was the path ahead of me. The tonal rhythmic echo reverberated its way through the walls and into me yet again it sounded now like a beckoning urging me forward, I thanked it for the extra strength. Before my mind returned to its hellish surroundings, sanity can't exist in that godless place. Only the recollection of a crouched hag and a fleshy border on the floor.  



The hall was flesh again and it reeked of rotting flesh and moldy ball sweat. The putrid smell infected my mind, placing another crack in whatever could've been left of my sanity. Whatever was left was crushed under foot as I passed by a decaying nut sack stuck to the wall turned half to black particles that released into the air. The stench of the rotting inner fluid leaking out poisoning the already abominable air. More and more line the walls and floor kept company by uteros and vaginas in varying states of decay into the black rot. Out of their openings in the fleshy walls and inside the exposed uterus dotting the walls alongside them, lay mangled skinless but living fetuses also with varying states of decay. The ones that popped out of the wall wandered around in their near blindness, parts of them falling off due to the mold that clung to their already rotting flesh. They squelched with every step and more as their pieces inevitably fell off before they died and piled up around me in little moldy pieces of exposed flesh. They coo-ed just like a child would before it learns to talk. My mind was frozen from the sights and wiped by the scents, my legs kept moving under me. My mind was blank but my body still understood one thing. Run. More vile than ever the hag crouched tracing her bloody P into a massive tit that hung from the left wall. The boundary ahead of me was a deep red flame cloaked in black smoke and dust from the rotting sexual organs and molding fetus creatures all around me. As I ran through it I felt every atom in my body being coated with its horrid stench bathed in its abomination. I was born again. On the other side lies an empty concrete hall that seemingly stretched on forever. The lights now embedded into the ceiling dotted the darkened hall with spots of light no more turning left. Two men in prison guard uniforms approached me, they looked normal. I call out to them. ""H-hello! Where the hell am I? Please tell me how I got here!"" They approached me with closed eyes and calm hardened expressions. In one quick motion the guard on the left struck the side of my head. As my vision faded to black for my last moment of sanity all I could hear was the sound of handcuffs being placed over my wrists before they closed shut.

1ppaz3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ppaz3w/aio_because_husband_ignored_me_on_my_50_th_bday/,AIO because husband ignored me on my 50 th bday?,"I literally turned 50. I dreaded it as I was really scared that my husband will make me feel bad as per usual on my birthday.  
Well the day before he started nitpicking at me that he can sense my attitude will change soon and he doesn't like it. 
He also started picking at our dogs and that he doesn't want them because they leave hair everywhere.  Even though I asked him not bring that up as there is nothing I can do and Im not getting rid of them, they're 14 years old now too. I literally told him every can go to his mothers condo , no pets there.

So he slept on the couch and woke up late. Made me coffee - but when he saw I didn't drink it he dumped it in the sink in front of me. He then proceeded to paint a washroom. 

End of my birthday and  there is some flowers on the table but thats it. NOT even a Happy Birthday literally nothing not a word, hug nothing.  

He saw I worked physically on out homestead. Didn't bother to help in any way. 

I feel like he managed to ruin yet another birthday ",69,1766012550.0,AmIOverreacting,90,0.88,False

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

If my signal created resonating vibes with you, send me a short message about yourself or the things that make your life up. Let’s see where our conversation takes us.",1,1766012411.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
