""NO! Don't start off the story like this! A simple fade in would do the trick.



Thank you.""

Thanks, Captain Scarlet, now for the rest of the story.



Every quiet evening in the heart of Sydney, Captain Scarlet would relax in a comfy chair with no TV on, still wearing his uniform, smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee whilst reading the newspaper. When the sunset was as beautiful as it was, He would walk out onto the balcony and gaze out at the neighbourhood's activity getting slower and quieter. On this afternoon, he gazed out into the distance, his short hair blowing in the chill wind.



It was then that he started to cry. He was crying, but what for? It was in what he said next that he realised. ""Why? Why am I indestructible? Could it be that they injected me with a special formula to make me indestructible? Am I...a robot?"" Captain Scarlet was crying so much that he immediately thought indestructibility was a bit too much for him, so he decided to go to bed. He brushed those indestructible fangs of his, put on his pyjamas and climbed into bed, switching off his light and falling fast asleep, as the sky got dark and the neighbourhood stood to a silent standstill.",1,1730636080.0,ThunderbirdsEra,0,1.0,False

I'll be landing on 16 November, but picking up a hire a car and leaving straight away. I'm flying back out of LAX on 01 December, so planning on coming back to Los Angeles on the Wednesday or Thursday to spend some time there before heading home. I've been once before, about twenty years ago and didn't like it, I'm more of a east coast, walkable city person, but want to give it another try. I'm a foodie and love craft beer, so I'm excited about this part of it, wasn't it this when I visited last time. Thinking of maybe staying downtown, seems like some good craft beer places there, plus Japan town, Chinatown and Korea town all relatively close by. Is downtown a good place to stay, or would you recommend staying in another part of town. I'll have a car, although rather not spend my days being sat on traffic. As I'll be drinking in the evening, then obviously won't be driving, which is why I thought that downtown might work with proximity of craft beer places to drink being walkable, or at least a short Uber ride away. Would like to go up to the observatory and take in the view, maybe check out the Gehry and also Venice beach. I like hipster neighbourhoods with cool bars and restaurants and coffee spots. Enjoyed street arts and cool architecture. Also have a weird thing for visiting rundown/rough places, enjoyed seeing the abandoned houses when I stayed in Detroit one time. So contemplating visiting a hood. Or is this asking for trouble. 

I like American football, so would like to check out a game of I get chance. I've been watching a lot of college football this year and enjoy it more than the NFL with the crowds. I've liked to go to USC Vs UCLA, but won't be back in Los Angeles when it is taking place. 

I'm a big fan of soccer and my team are playing in the premier league on 01 December and I try to watch every game. The thing is that it will be kicking off at 05:30 local time, will there be any places that would show a game that early in the morning.

If anyone has any craft beer recommendations, please shout out. Monkish is top of the list. Would love to find somewhere that does good barrel aged stouts or barely wines.

I like my natural wines, so any good food places that serve natural wines would be great.

Also just general food places in general, especially Mexican and Asian food and your typical American food places, be it burgers, hot dogs or breakfast.

During the week, she naps at daycare. They pat her to sleep like we do (~20 minutes they said), and her schedule is very consistent.

On the weekend, we try to follow the timing, but I've been rocking her to sleep and letting her contact nap on me. 

Frankly, I miss her and I like it. I'm just drinking coffee and watching TV anyways. If we really try, we can put her down for a nap in the crib still. I've only done this for one weekend so far, but will probably do it next weekend.

Am I really shooting myself in the foot though? Will it eventually undo her training? I don't want to mess her up, she's just such an active baby and doesn't ever want to cuddle.",1,1730635582.0,sleeptrain,0,1.0,False

Basically, you do surveys to earn points, and you can cash out once you have enough. Plus, they have a few bonus features to boost your earnings, which makes it a bit more interesting!

**Earn Money by Taking Surveys**  
The main thing here is the surveys. They’re usually pretty quick and straightforward, and you earn points for each one you complete. I’ve been doing them during coffee breaks—it’s a nice way to feel productive and earn a little something on the side! ☕💸

**Earn by Playing Games: A Mix of Fun and Frustration 🤨**  
Prime Opinion actually lets you earn by playing games too, which is cool, but fair warning: some of these games can be a bit unpredictable with rewards. Some are worth it, while others make you work a little harder than I’d like. But hey, if you like gaming, it’s another way to earn while having fun. 🎮🕹️

**Weekly Raffles: Win Up to 1,000 Points! 🎁**  
If you’re consistent and do at least one survey every day for seven days, you get entered into a raffle. Last time, I won 500 points (roughly $5), which covered my coffee costs for the week! ☕ Not a bad deal, so I try to keep up with the streak.

**Leveling Up: Unlock Extra Perks 📈**  
There’s a level system too, which makes it feel a bit like a game. Each time you level up, you unlock features and earn extra points. Maybe one day I’ll hit level 99 and be the ""Survey King""! 👑😂

**Quick Bonus: Use My Link for an Extra +10% on Surveys 🎉**  
If you use my link, you’ll get a 10% bonus on surveys for your first 24 hours, which means you can boost your points right from the start! It’s a win-win for both of us. 🎉

**Leaderboard System: Serious Effort Needed 😅**  
There’s also a leaderboard, but I’ll be honest—it’s a bit intense. I haven’t made it up there yet because you need to fill out a ton of surveys to stay on top. Maybe one day I’ll reach ""survey warrior"" status!

**Create Virtual Credit Cards with Your Points 💳**  
One of the coolest features: you can actually create virtual credit cards with your points. I made one for Amazon, and it worked perfectly. It’s a fun way to treat yourself with what you’ve earned!

If you’re looking to make a little extra in your free time, Prime Opinion is worth a shot. I’ve been using it while commuting or waiting around, and those points start adding up.

1gikzke,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gikzke,The Art of Being Your Own Best Company • [Click to Expand],"# Finding Peace in Solitary Moments

You know that feeling when you're sitting alone in your favorite coffee shop, watching people rush by through the window? There's something magical about those moments. Being alone isn't just about the absence of others – it's about discovering who you are when no one's watching.

I've spent countless hours walking through parks, headphones in, lost in my own thoughts. That's when the real conversations happen – the ones between me, myself, and I. Sometimes these solo adventures lead to the most incredible breakthroughs. It's like your mind finally has the space to stretch its legs and wander.

Think about those quiet Sunday mornings when you're the first one awake. The world feels different, doesn't it? There's a certain power in choosing to be alone, in embracing those moments of solitude rather than running from them. It's not about being antisocial; it's about being comfortable enough with yourself to enjoy your own company.

Let's be honest – we live in a world that's constantly buzzing with notifications, meetings, and social obligations. Being alone has become almost revolutionary. It's funny how we've started seeing solitude as something to fix rather than something to cherish. But here's the thing: those moments when you're cooking a meal just for yourself, reading a book in perfect silence, or taking a solo road trip – they're not empty spaces to be filled. They're opportunities for growth, creativity, and self-discovery.

Remember when being alone felt scary? Maybe it still does sometimes. That's okay. Like any skill, being comfortable with solitude takes practice. Start small – maybe with a solo lunch or a quiet afternoon in the park. You might be surprised by how refreshing it feels to be completely yourself, without any pressure to perform or please others.

And let's talk about productivity for a moment. Have you noticed how some of your best ideas come when you're alone? There's science behind that. When your brain isn't busy processing social cues and conversations, it's free to make new connections and explore creative pathways. Some of history's greatest inventions and artworks were born in solitude.

But here's what I've learned: being alone doesn't mean being lonely. In fact, developing a healthy relationship with solitude can make your relationships with others even stronger. When you're comfortable with yourself, you bring a different kind of energy to your interactions. You're not hanging out with people because you're afraid to be alone – you're choosing to spend time with them because you genuinely want to.

The beauty of solitude is that it's entirely yours to shape. Maybe for you, it's about meditation and self-reflection. Or perhaps it's about dancing like nobody's watching (because literally, nobody is). Whatever form it takes, embracing these moments of solitude isn't just okay – it's essential for your mental and emotional wellbeing.

So next time you find yourself alone, try seeing it as a gift rather than a gap to be filled. Use it as an opportunity to reconnect with yourself, to pursue your passions without judgment, or simply to enjoy the peace that comes with being completely, unapologetically you. After all, sometimes the best company you can have is your own.

The long weekend isn’t over yet.,"I understand that everyone (well most of us) is going back to work tomorrow, and we’re all dreading it. Most would prefer staying in tonight, to rest for tomorrow- but I was one of the few who got left in Metro Manila, while everyone went to their hometowns. 

If there’s someone out there who is into night drives, good conversation, and great coffee/food, then I would love to see the city lights with you. Perhaps we could drive around Metro Manila or go to Tagaytay. 



Also there are some basic things you might want to know about me 

- I’m 27 years old
- I’m a biological female
- I live alone
- I weigh around 148lbs, and my height is 5’3 
- I live in Quezon City
- My skin is fair in color, my hair is jet black
- I don’t have my own ride yet (will get one soon). 

What I’m looking for

* Someone who knows what they’re looking for.

* Someone nice, sweet, perhaps cocky

* Someone who is stable (mentally, financially, emotionally, physically). 

* Someone who IS NOT BROKE. 

* Someone who isn’t confused about their feelings. 


* Someone who is a foodie

* If you love cars, then plus points for you

* Someone who loves dogs and cats

* Someone medium built 

* Someone taller than me (5’9 or taller)

* Someone who is clean (this is a must)

I think that’s all for now. ",4,1730634076.0,PHR4Rhookups,0,1.0,False

1gikxoh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gikxoh,The Art of Being Your Own Best Company • [Click to Expand],"# Finding Peace in Solitary Moments

You know that feeling when you're sitting alone in your favorite coffee shop, watching people rush by through the window? There's something magical about those moments. Being alone isn't just about the absence of others – it's about discovering who you are when no one's watching.

I've spent countless hours walking through parks, headphones in, lost in my own thoughts. That's when the real conversations happen – the ones between me, myself, and I. Sometimes these solo adventures lead to the most incredible breakthroughs. It's like your mind finally has the space to stretch its legs and wander.

Think about those quiet Sunday mornings when you're the first one awake. The world feels different, doesn't it? There's a certain power in choosing to be alone, in embracing those moments of solitude rather than running from them. It's not about being antisocial; it's about being comfortable enough with yourself to enjoy your own company.

Let's be honest – we live in a world that's constantly buzzing with notifications, meetings, and social obligations. Being alone has become almost revolutionary. It's funny how we've started seeing solitude as something to fix rather than something to cherish. But here's the thing: those moments when you're cooking a meal just for yourself, reading a book in perfect silence, or taking a solo road trip – they're not empty spaces to be filled. They're opportunities for growth, creativity, and self-discovery.

Remember when being alone felt scary? Maybe it still does sometimes. That's okay. Like any skill, being comfortable with solitude takes practice. Start small – maybe with a solo lunch or a quiet afternoon in the park. You might be surprised by how refreshing it feels to be completely yourself, without any pressure to perform or please others.

And let's talk about productivity for a moment. Have you noticed how some of your best ideas come when you're alone? There's science behind that. When your brain isn't busy processing social cues and conversations, it's free to make new connections and explore creative pathways. Some of history's greatest inventions and artworks were born in solitude.

But here's what I've learned: being alone doesn't mean being lonely. In fact, developing a healthy relationship with solitude can make your relationships with others even stronger. When you're comfortable with yourself, you bring a different kind of energy to your interactions. You're not hanging out with people because you're afraid to be alone – you're choosing to spend time with them because you genuinely want to.

The beauty of solitude is that it's entirely yours to shape. Maybe for you, it's about meditation and self-reflection. Or perhaps it's about dancing like nobody's watching (because literally, nobody is). Whatever form it takes, embracing these moments of solitude isn't just okay – it's essential for your mental and emotional wellbeing.

So next time you find yourself alone, try seeing it as a gift rather than a gap to be filled. Use it as an opportunity to reconnect with yourself, to pursue your passions without judgment, or simply to enjoy the peace that comes with being completely, unapologetically you. After all, sometimes the best company you can have is your own.

This particular excerpt, titled:

“Michael, Why Art Thou Gay?”

Meant, of course, to introduce some levity, but there’s also a more formal title: 

“An Explanation to a Friend Beginning on the Reason Why I Figured the Angel Michael was Queer”

“Beginning on,” I’ve said in particular, because my explanation took form another way—and maybe appropriately, because is it right to out an angel? The Angel—a god—even? As a choice amongst other creative choices, that is at the very least questionable of me, to me … and even if this character wouldn’t mind it of me, it’s maybe then inappropriate for my hospitality to the unacquainted reader, a stranger, thereby entering His realm of influence again—this time giving me strife with gods (His acquaintance) and men (mine). And I have long abandoned my wrestlings … 

I much rather prosper than prevail. 

Again, if I should add this for the more serious and ruminating crowd: though honest, I’m only introducing levity here, and with icebreaking wit 😂 

Frozen solid? Okay. Well, anyway, here we go: 

The conversation:

My friend: “No worries, it made me chuckle,” she replied to something not-so-relevant to everything that follows this—maybe (and her own discourse explores that maybe) … 

Myself: “There was an innocence to it (an inappropriate joke I made, still irrelevant 😂), actually: wait till I tell the story how, if in any precise way I'm able to substantiate it to par, my impression of the Angel was that He was gay.”

And so it went … 

»
Well I probably won’t share that with like, everyone 😂 unless you, mutual reader, come across this note—and for you I will explain. Here we go. Know that it was an argument posed to myself in defense of a universal love; a divine love met with a divine ethic that is at once two things: 1.) good, and impartial to that effect, being therefore supreme in its metaphysical position (holy and sacred regard), its metaphysical descent (to all humanity), and metaphysical ascent (among all divine beings), altogether these in its being relayed; and I want to make a point of this first statement, because we may imagine that an ethic like this sounds like certainty about something like sexual orientation, and to the Christian’s defense, I do mean certainty, and not condemnation, but certainly ‘certainty,’ about what characteristic describes a Heavenly Father and His male Logos (see her note); I would also posit, in my assumption of the faith I once held, that any certain kind of orientation of an individual describes a primary orientation of the soul; but also, as far as the ethic goes, again, 2.) unbinding on that universal love, because of love’s perfection as a nature—not even a concept, nor even an ever-present and unyielding reality, but a rare, fluid, resilient, dynamic, and even yielding, nature. I would even question myself for trying another word for the category of what love should be. But this love that I figured had to be, had to be so perfectly boundless that in its translation into a discipline, it was completely and utterly lawless: “Be fruitful and multiply, fill the Earth and subdue it.” Just partake in sex, basically. This command of course was in pursuit of an end of earthly population, but as I tried to articulate in the earlier part of this message, its claim to divine order is not only with the supreme ethic, which as an ethic always serves to RIGHTLY (capitalized because this is literally ethics’ main priority) accomplish something set in mind by the particular nature of whatever ethic it is; to bring about some kind of chosen end, but in the love itself, because of a plasticity and strength and agreeability that the divine needs for its being, identity, and satiation.” 

As for the plasticity and ‘dynamicy' of love that prevails over an ethic:

“For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon. The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' But wisdom is justified by all her children."" Luke 7:33-35 NKJV

And then, the necessity for things of love to be tried against actual, unethical lawlessness—to be refined, and to claim back their justification—which justification can maybe only be communicated by grace: unchecked, un-appended, salvific grace, in which He needed to be learned, and in the presence of a great demon: 

“Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.” Matthew‬ ‭4‬:‭1‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

And as for the Ruach, the Holy Spirit, who I believed was most closely oriented towards or most upholding of this universal and collectively actualized love—particularly in a sanctifying and 'exactifying' sense—I believed that righteousness and personal holiness required breaking points at the extremes of grace; of liberality:

""Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: ""Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, In the day of trial in the wilderness, Therefore I was angry with that generation, And said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they have not known My ways. So I swore in My wrath, ‘They shall not enter My rest."" Hebrews 3:7-8, 10-11 NKJV

I believed that It was a Woman, a ""Ruach;” and that She was a great and holy demon; a God deemed to be mostly unknown, because of what both of those, especially the last, meant for a divine order of human understanding; one posited and ordained by the family of Yahweh that the Angel shared in (""for My Name is in Him"") but also somehow pridefully remained sure of Himself in His role, which was no slight to God being a fair-natured god existing in fairness or fair circumstance (I believed that things around God were good, and not just that He was good in a Heaven or unseen world of extreme strife 😂😂—like having ALL beings originate by your craftsmanship or something and ALL subservient). I believed that, in fact, this God was someone of whom something somewhat like this was spoken to another, “And the Lord said to her: “Two nations are in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; One people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger.” Genesis‬ ‭25‬:‭23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ And that that great mystery of persons and origins explained how the Angel and Yahweh could in biblical text share of the same name, as of a divine namesake, as of a family of great beings. 

“Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Beware of Him and obey His voice; do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions; for My name is in Him.” Exodus‬ ‭23‬:‭20‬-‭21‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

The latter verse is as if God was to say, “My name in your tongue, ‘I will be to you,’ as it is set forth before Me, ‘Yahweh,’ is a promise within Him.” This tells of either an appetite or an innate possession, as of a birthright. And yet, the Angel defers, even as one who serves His younger brother—a concept biblically familiar. 

But to not detract from my main point—the Ruach Hakodesh, a holy Demon; and this attested to by our traditional observation of the being’s characteristic to activate humanity’s senses in a kind of sacred sensuality in our experience, inquiry and pursuit of existential and divine discovery. 

So you could say I was a very liberal Christian? 😂 but I feel like I was faithful to what things could really be, and I was most definitely inspired; inspired by what I read and what was around me. I would always knowingly screenshot secularly inspired things I saw on the internet that I felt like spoke to this liberal divine that had its pervasive and respective and nuanced effects on humanity. 

Also, a disclaimer for the context of my first thought: I’m cis straight 😂 so I have no particular preference of interpretation besides consistency across reading, and truly, any available information (say the Tao Te Ching) as well as correspondence to an apparent or possibly metaphysical reality. 

•• In response to my friend’s reply that followed my “wait till I tell you” text and preluded this discourse of mine, taking place during its writing: ••

And/But to your reply to me: Yes! I actually considered the same; that some of that imagery and expression of a consummative archetype—while it is indeed unclear if Christ is that quintessential reality of marriage (a truly sterile view in my opinion, either that or a dissolution of His unique and distinct person) or if, as the Church (of men and women, without partiality), we are simply to understand our relationship to Christ in the picture and even context of marriage, as a great allegory of real metaphysical, essential, or spiritual substance—again, I considered that the theological imagery was a testament to a true divine ontological reality; true copies of the truer; a reality of at least 3 beings: the Father, the Angel (who is His older brother) and the Holy Ghost—which I’ll briefly explain, too: 

I also imagined that Jesus, in assuming and actualizing into His role as a member and comprehensive representative of the family of the LORD—which I thought to be a real family of comparable beings of old, however deep and broad and communicable it was, but mostly, as far as we are concerned, a ‘genetic’ or generative line culminating in 2 LORDs, and with even more concern to us, a line producing the viable One’s dual-natured Heir; a Son who embraced both images of orientational love—and orientational, yes, but truly just ‘universal love’ in its honest and shameless expression—in His divine ministry. 

A universal love. 

And I I thought this to be a testament, even, and as I said I would explain, to a divine tension with another god whose own family or heritage embraced more liberal essences of things; another god who, in Christ’s realization of not only His own divinity but assumption of all that can be said to be divine according to the divine tension of ‘big-G Godhood,’ required Him, this Son of Yahweh, to learn Her ways and Her ministry for the sake of all of Her children, as She did those who came before Him. 

“For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by all her children.” Luke‬ ‭7‬:‭33‬-‭35‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

Left a whole note in your replies, but 😂 It may have never been shared otherwise, because of my restraint. 

I don’t know how much your coffee shop Christian would take to—or feel courtesy by—my interpretation of theology within the biblical narrative. I’m challenged in my faith, or lack thereof, because I see it as hidden by intention; separate from every individual biblical claim, but realizable within the details of all, especially the inspired inclusions and exclusions in what are markedly writings that became so through the limitations—all of the unique preferences and idiosyncrasies—of humanity; moreover, in addition to all these things, realizable yet again by a certain realism about other existential and even natural studies. Though I am of no particular faith nowadays, besides my own that is in and within our apparent reality, and no longer believe in a god-reality generally, I still find a lot of passion in this interpretation of mine—which is mine only inasmuch as that word can regard the fact that I don’t feel it fitting to take ownership over anything I’ve realized about ‘the God’ over the years—and also within the intellectual honesty and self-authenticity I embraced to suppose everything I’ve believed. Also, especially, and on account of that, I’m somewhat charmed by the fact that maybe no one else has come to the same conclusions. If I was right, there was a veil, which I had somehow entered through, and I never once considered myself wrong or delusional about God. I thought it all to be quite mysterious when I was Christian, and telling even of my own ontological metric. And then I let it go.",0,1730633545.0,theology,0,0.33,False

1gikswo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalNomadTurkiye/comments/1gikswo/culture_and_etiquette_for_digital_nomads_in/,Culture and Etiquette for Digital Nomads in Türkiye 🇹🇷,"For digital nomads, blending into local culture isn’t just about enjoying the journey; it’s about creating meaningful connections and respecting the country you’re living in. Türkiye’s rich culture blends Eastern and Western traditions, offering a unique environment with its customs and etiquette. Here’s a guide to help you navigate Türkiye’s social norms and ensure a respectful and enjoyable experience.



1. Understanding Personal Space and Greetings

\- Handshakes and Greetings: A friendly handshake is common in business and social settings, but it’s best to wait and observe in more traditional settings. Sometimes, a nod or a slight bow may be more appropriate.

\- Gender Differences: Traditional norms can sometimes mean a more reserved approach in interactions between men and women, especially in rural areas. Follow cues, and when in doubt, offer a respectful nod or a simple ""Merhaba"" (hello).

  

2. Dining Etiquette and the Importance of Sharing

\- Invitations to Dine: Hospitality is a big part of Turkish culture. If you’re invited to someone’s home or out for a meal, it’s a sign of warmth and friendliness. Bringing a small gift, like sweets or flowers, is a thoughtful gesture.

\- Dining Norms: Meals are often served family-style, and sharing is common. Avoid using your left hand to eat, especially in more traditional settings. Also, it’s polite to wait for the host to begin eating first.

\- Tea and Coffee Rituals: Expect tea (çay) and Turkish coffee (kahve) to be part of your day, whether at a café or someone’s home. Accepting a cup shows appreciation and hospitality—turning it down can sometimes be seen as impolite.



3. Respect for Religion and Tradition

\- Mosques and Sacred Spaces: When visiting mosques, dress modestly and remove your shoes. Women may need to cover their hair, and both men and women should avoid shorts and sleeveless tops.

\- Calls to Prayer: The call to prayer (ezan) occurs five times daily, and it’s a reminder of Türkiye’s rich spiritual heritage. Although no one expects silence during prayer times, showing respect by lowering your voice in nearby areas is appreciated.

4. Dress Code: Blending In While Staying Comfortable

\- Casual Yet Modest: In major cities like Istanbul and Izmir, dress codes are more relaxed. However, dressing modestly—especially in rural areas or when visiting religious sites—shows respect. Opt for comfortable but conservative clothing when exploring beyond the big cities.

\- Swimwear at Beaches: Swimwear is appropriate at beaches and resort areas, but outside these settings, it’s best to cover up.



5. Social Etiquette and Public Behavior

\- Public Displays of Affection: While cities are more lenient, Türkiye leans conservative on public displays of affection, especially in rural areas. A discreet approach is usually the most respectful.

\- Photographing Locals and Public Spaces: Before taking photos of locals, especially in rural areas, ask for permission. Respect privacy, particularly around mosques and places of worship.



6. Communication Style: Direct, but Respectful

\- Respect for Elders: Elders are highly respected in Turkish culture. If you’re in a group with older individuals, greeting them first and showing deference is appreciated.

\- Hospitality and Conversations: You may find locals genuinely interested in conversing with you and offering advice or help. Accepting their hospitality and engaging in conversation (even if brief) can go a long way in building goodwill.

  

7. Invitations to Homes: What to Expect

\- Entering a Home: When invited to a Turkish home, it’s customary to remove your shoes at the door. Slippers are often provided.

\- Guest Etiquette: Offering a small token of gratitude, like chocolates or a local souvenir, is a warm gesture that your hosts will appreciate.



Key Phrases to Help You Blend In

\- Hello: ""Merhaba""

\- Thank you: ""Teşekkür ederim""

\- Yes / No: ""Evet"" / ""Hayır""

\- Goodbye: ""Güle güle"" (when you’re leaving) / ""Hoşça kal"" (when others are leaving)



Understanding Turkish culture as a digital nomad can make your experience far more rewarding. It’s a chance to connect with locals, build friendships, and show respect for the traditions that make Türkiye unique.

""Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: ""Today, if you will hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, In the day of trial in the wilderness, Therefore I was angry with that generation, And said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they have not known My ways. So I swore in My wrath, ‘They shall not enter My rest."" Hebrews 3:7-8, 10-11 NKJV

I believed that It was a Woman, a ""Ruach;” and that She was a great and holy demon; a God deemed to be mostly unknown, because of what both of those, especially the last, meant for a divine order of human understanding; one posited and ordained by the family of Yahweh that the Angel shared in (""for My Name is in Him"") but also somehow pridefully remained sure of Himself in His role, which was no slight to God being a fair-natured god existing in fairness or fair circumstance (I believed that things around God were good, and not just that He was good in a Heaven or unseen world of extreme strife 😂😂—like having ALL beings originate by your craftsmanship or something and ALL subservient). I believed that, in fact, this God was someone of whom something somewhat like this was spoken to another, “And the Lord said to her: “Two nations are in your womb, Two peoples shall be separated from your body; One people shall be stronger than the other, And the older shall serve the younger.” Genesis‬ ‭25‬:‭23‬ ‭NKJV‬‬ And that that great mystery of persons and origins explained how the Angel and Yahweh could in biblical text share of the same name, as of a divine namesake, as of a family of great beings. 

“Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Beware of Him and obey His voice; do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions; for My name is in Him.” Exodus‬ ‭23‬:‭20‬-‭21‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

The latter verse is as if God was to say, “My name in your tongue, ‘I will be to you,’ as it is set forth before Me, ‘Yahweh,’ is a promise within Him.” This tells of either an appetite or an innate possession, as of a birthright. And yet, the Angel defers, even as one who serves His younger brother—a concept biblically familiar. 

But to not detract from my main point—the Ruach Hakodesh, a holy Demon; and this attested to by our traditional observation of the being’s characteristic to activate humanity’s senses in a kind of sacred sensuality in our experience, inquiry and pursuit of existential and divine discovery. 

So you could say I was a very liberal Christian? 😂 but I feel like I was faithful to what things could really be, and I was most definitely inspired; inspired by what I read and what was around me. I would always knowingly screenshot secularly inspired things I saw on the internet that I felt like spoke to this liberal divine that had its pervasive and respective and nuanced effects on humanity. 

Also, a disclaimer for the context of my first thought: I’m cis straight 😂 so I have no particular preference of interpretation besides consistency across reading, and truly, any available information (say the Tao Te Ching) as well as correspondence to an apparent or possibly metaphysical reality. 

•• In response to my friend’s reply that followed my “wait till I tell you” text and preluded this discourse of mine, taking place during its writing: ••

And/But to your reply to me: Yes! I actually considered the same; that some of that imagery and expression of a consummative archetype—while it is indeed unclear if Christ is that quintessential reality of marriage (a truly sterile view in my opinion, either that or a dissolution of His unique and distinct person) or if, as the Church (of men and women, without partiality), we are simply to understand our relationship to Christ in the picture and even context of marriage, as a great allegory of real metaphysical, essential, or spiritual substance—again, I considered that the theological imagery was a testament to a true divine ontological reality; true copies of the truer; a reality of at least 3 beings: the Father, the Angel (who is His older brother) and the Holy Ghost—which I’ll briefly explain, too: 

I also imagined that Jesus, in assuming and actualizing into His role as a member and comprehensive representative of the family of the LORD—which I thought to be a real family of comparable beings of old, however deep and broad and communicable it was, but mostly, as far as we are concerned, a ‘genetic’ or generative line culminating in 2 LORDs, and with even more concern to us, a line producing the viable One’s dual-natured Heir; a Son who embraced both images of orientational love—and orientational, yes, but truly just ‘universal love’ in its honest and shameless expression—in His divine ministry. 

A universal love. 

And I I thought this to be a testament, even, and as I said I would explain, to a divine tension with another god whose own family or heritage embraced more liberal essences of things; another god who, in Christ’s realization of not only His own divinity but assumption of all that can be said to be divine according to the divine tension of ‘big-G Godhood,’ required Him, this Son of Yahweh, to learn Her ways and Her ministry for the sake of all of Her children, as She did those who came before Him. 

“For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon.’ The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by all her children.” Luke‬ ‭7‬:‭33‬-‭35‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

Left a whole note in your replies, but 😂 It may have never been shared otherwise, because of my restraint. 

I don’t know how much your coffee shop Christian would take to—or feel courtesy by—my interpretation of theology within the biblical narrative. I’m challenged in my faith, or lack thereof, because I see it as hidden by intention; separate from every individual biblical claim, but realizable within the details of all, especially the inspired inclusions and exclusions in what are markedly writings that became so through the limitations—all of the unique preferences and idiosyncrasies—of humanity; moreover, in addition to all these things, realizable yet again by a certain realism about other existential and even natural studies. Though I am of no particular faith nowadays, besides my own that is in and within our apparent reality, and no longer believe in a god-reality generally, I still find a lot of passion in this interpretation of mine—which is mine only inasmuch as that word can regard the fact that I don’t feel it fitting to take ownership over anything I’ve realized about ‘the God’ over the years—and also within the intellectual honesty and self-authenticity I embraced to suppose everything I’ve believed. Also, especially, and on account of that, I’m somewhat charmed by the fact that maybe no one else has come to the same conclusions. If I was right, there was a veil, which I had somehow entered through, and I never once considered myself wrong or delusional about God. I thought it all to be quite mysterious when I was Christian, and telling even of my own ontological metric. And then I let it go.",1,1730633455.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False

I had planned to meet a friend for coffee, nothing out of the ordinary. But as I stood at my front door, keys in hand, a wave of dread hit me out of nowhere. My chest tightened, my heart raced, and suddenly the thought of walking out that door felt insurmountable. I wasn’t facing danger, but my mind convinced me otherwise.

I sat down, trying to catch my breath, battling the urge to cancel. I thought about how my friend would feel if I didn’t show up and how I’d beat myself up later for giving in. But at that moment, it felt like I was fighting an invisible enemy that had full control over me.

Eventually, I forced myself out, but the walk to the café was like walking through a storm. Every step felt heavy, every noise amplified my anxiety. By the time I reached the café, I was exhausted. My friend greeted me warmly, but I couldn’t shake the tension.

That day wasn’t about coffee. It was a battle—a battle I didn’t choose but had to fight. Anxiety doesn’t announce its arrival or explain itself. It just shows up, turning the simplest moments into mountains. And while that day was tough, it reminded me of my resilience, of the strength it takes to face anxiety head-on, even when it feels overwhelming.

Was standing before the mirror and noticed these dark stripes on the side of my upper abdomen. Turns out I am starting to see the vague outline of my rib cage. Can even start to see the under edge of it on the front. It's quite weird to discover that you have a ribcage: You know it's there but to actually see its structure is another thing. My BMI is 23.6 so I'm still in the upper range of normal BMI so this is not a problem.   


60+ hours fast report:   
I do TRF to rest my digestion system against inflammation and have been working on going from 85kg to below 70 kg. I usually don't do anything other than 'first meal of the day is at noon' along with LC/Keto diet, but this weekend I am on my first 3 days fast as well. Currently at 62 hours!  
  
It's going ok. I make sure to hydrate (Routine: cup of cold water with salt first, then a liter of coffee, then refill/dilute with hot water over the day and take in sea salt/himalayan salt mix. I'm alone these 3 days so no disturbances or temptations. My mind is clear, extremely calm? But there's an undertone of fuzziness and the inclination to find food is present. It's not a big thing, just simply there, but I wouldn't choose to do anything that requires intensive thinking right now. I see a link between all my usual thoughts having nigh-on disappeared and the focus on finding food being a constant, so I just keep reminding myself that there's food right over in the supermarket. This makes me not stressed.  
The worst point was between 18 and 24 hours, since that is usually when I'd have eaten normally and when my brain really started complaining. Now it's just 'ok'. Not euphoric. But ok. Which I can see as normal considering this is quite an undertaking. This is a big ask of the body!   
But it's taking the ask well. Better than I expected. I sectioned the days off with sleeping in, do some light work in the morning/afternoon, then draw a hot bath around 1600 and soak until 1800 (Don't need to prepare dinner anyway, hah!). Hydrate well, but the hot bath solves water retention. Then the evening is just resting and lounging and binging series (getting the best rest ever, actually. I'm usually always doing things). A thing I noticed is that around 2200 I'm just done for the day: there's nothing I want. But I do have trouble falling asleep. But I sleep through the night once I do and wake up feeling rested. So that's not ideal but not problematic.   
  
I think that 'not ideal but not problematic' is a good report on this. I am 100% in on keeping this up today and I am not unhappy with keeping up this fast. But it is an effort. We can't deny that fact. I did wake up with 68.2 kg on the scale, while I went to bed on a 68.9 kg. This was very unexpected: I know you burn a lot during the night, but I did not expect this rate of burn-down.  
Wouldn't plan it, but would do an extended fast like this again. ",4,1730632280.0,intermittentfasting,0,0.83,False

1gikhnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gikhnd/bean_mixing_grinding_brewing_at_home/,"Bean Mixing, Grinding & Brewing at Home","I've been in a battle with caffeine over the past \~10 years, since I was introduced to that damned delicious coffee in independent cafes and have gotten myself in the habit of chronically overworking (doing my best to stop this seperately).

I have been making coffee at home too using a French Press and eventually an AeroPress, and even started buying nice decaf beans I would grind. However first thing every morning I would find myself strongly urged to go to a nearby cafe and get the real deal. I tried getting nice beans at home etc. but I could never really get it to stick. What I was making at home was fine, but it wasn't replicating what my body wanted.

Recently I decided to get a espresso machine, a grinder and some nice beans from a local roaster. After a small learning curve this is producing equal if not better coffee than I can get in cafes and has killed my urge to crawl on hands and knees to some poor barista at 8am.

Anyway, one of the advantages has been that I can mix my decaf beans with my caffeinated beans. I am measuring to 17g each time anyway, so it's no extra bother. Doing this has allowed me to gradually but effortlessly wean myself to 5g caffeinated + 12g decaf at the moment. I can imagine even on a day where I've slept badly and would have a greater urge I could control the blip to say 10g of caffeinated, and even then I can see myself getting to fully decaf in the mornings as it is, or just stabilise at something like 3g caffeinated.

The total control makes this process so much easier. I remember asking cafes for decaf and being unsure if they actually did follow through.

Another bonus for those of us addicted to cafes, is the money saved. The machinery and accessories have cost me \~€500. Each 17g of beans costs me \~€0.70. Meanwhile I was probably on average spending €6 on a coffee + a treat every morning. If you do the maths that's a payback period of 3 months  for the machinery, never mind the time saved and reduced sugar consumption. Beyond that I'll be saving \~€2k per year- which really adds up over a prolonged period.

Thanks for reading my propaganda. Hopefully useful for anyone who just finds themselves keeping all the local cafes in business single handedly. Hard not the stress that the beans and grinder are probably the most important thing.",1,1730632189.0,decaf,0,0.67,False

I picked them because I can go there and see the diamonds in person. If I were in the US, I would do review of US brands similar to this.

\-----------------------

**DIAMOND REVIEW**

**Summary: Rainbow everywhere. Just look at any video above.**

After seeing all the round-ish special SIC in person (decagon, round 8/10 HA, octagon nova), I notice a few things:

0. HUGE difference between a random average GIA 3Ex diamond, and a ideal/super ideal cut diamond (will make another post about this).

1. Decagon/Round 10HA has much better scintillation (small diamond fire) thanks to having more facets. You can see more rainbow spots and much fewer dark spots, compared to traditional round 57 facets.
2. JP's 10HA diamonds shoot more rainbow rays (again, thanks to having more facets).
3. Traditional 8HA diamonds produce bigger individual light ray (bigger facets). However, decagon 10HA produces so many rays that they sometimes ""merge"" together, effectively creating a bigger light ray.
4. Decagon 10HA performs better than any other diamonds when looking from an angle. I'm not sure how, but regular round diamond look ""darker"" when looking from an angle (imagine looking at someone's hand while both are standing), but the decagon is still sparkling.

When looking directly from above (like in review videos), the round 10HA looks best. But in practice, we look at the diamonds from an angle all the time. So the decagon is better.

5. Octagon nova diamond look worse than round 8HA SIC (personal opinion). I feel like they don't produce as much long light rays.

6. When face up, DEFG diamonds from JP all look very white. When faced down, I can distinguish D-E-F-G diamond next to each other, with F looking noticeably yellow (personal opinion, I think most won't notice). But when faced up, I can't distinguish any of them (tested under office white light, white sunlight under shade, LED light).

Personally, I think G color is perfectly fine for solitaire; or F color in case your ring has a bunch of DEF color melee.

VS1 clarity is more than enough. All JP's diamond are guaranteed to be eye-clean anyway.

\---------------------------------

**PRICING**

**Summary: VERY EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY FOR LAB DIAMONDS**

When compared with LooseGrownDiamond (online retail), prices are like 6 times more expensive. BUT it's a bit unfair, because JP's products are SIC diamonds, while LGD sells regular diamonds.

Compared with USA retail vendors that sell SIC lab diamonds (Whiteflash, Brian Gavin, ...), JP decagon is 1.4-1.5x more expensive.

Compared with GCAL 8x diamonds on Adiamor (online retail), JP is 2-2.5 times more expensive depending on sizes. For example, with 2000$ (tax included) you can get a 1.2ct E VVS2 decagon from JP, or 1.9ct E VVS2 GCAL 8X from Adiamor.

Prices change with time, you can check them here: [https://www.jannpaul.com/diamond-price-guide](https://www.jannpaul.com/diamond-price-guide)

Prices might be outdated, so you should contact them directly on Whatsapp. Do not email them (they will miss it lol). Note that Singapore time is \~12 hour different from USA time.

\---------------------------------

**TIPS ON SELECTING DIAMOND**

As a prosumer that prioritizes looking for the best deal, here's my opinion for someone looking to buy from JP:

1. DO NOT SACRIFICE SIZE

\- A 1ct JP decagon will not outshine a 2ct gcal 8x diamond (but it can definitely outshine a bad ""excellent""/""ideal"" cut diamond from GIA/IGI).

\- DO NOT get traditional round 8HA from JP. It's much more expensive than GCAL 8X diamond, while performing pretty much the same (all SIC vendors use Tolkowsky diamond cut for 57 facets diamonds)

\- Use a GCAL 8x diamond with the size you want as a baseline. If you still have more budget, then look at JP's special cut.

2. Diamond color / Clarity are overrated

\- All JP diamonds are eye-clean, so VS1 will look exactly the same as Flawless (afaik). Paying for VVS and above is purely for mental reason (i.e you want to KNOW that it doesn't have inclusions, even if you can't see any).

\- When put into a ring, it's extremely difficult to distinguish DEFG color.

Logically, F VS1 will provide the best value. Personally I went for E VVS2.

3. Personal opinion

\- If you're wondering between a 1.8ct SIC and a 1ct JP decagon, get the 1.8ct (assuming they have same prices).

\- After some sizes (personally it's 2ct, for many it's 1ct), diamonds can look ""too big"". Personally, 2ct JP decagon > 3ct round SIC 8HA > 6ct generic GIA excellent/IGI ideal diamond.

\-------------------------

**OTHERS**

After you order, it can take 4 months to make the diamonds (applies to both natural or lab). If you're lucky and they already have the rough diamonds, it will be faster (idk how much). If you want to get one immediately, you need to pick from a few sizes/clarity that are currently available (usually because someone abandoned their orders).

JannPaul Youtube channel is very educational, and they have a variety of unique fancy-shape SIC diamonds. You should check them out.

1gikeom,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1gikeom/sleep_stopped_feeling_refreshing_adhd/,Sleep stopped feeling refreshing & ADHD?,"Hello, 
M21 here. I'm quite in a confused state figuring out what's going on. Decided to write this post to learn from people experience and hopefully in the long run help those who suffer the same.

I'll start by telling my issues, giving some background information and finally the theories I have.

My issues :
- Not waking up refreshed despite sleeping 7-8-9-10 hours
- Constant daytime fatigue
- Inability to focus without ADHD meds anymore
- Lack of motivation
- I usually wake up during the night but I can fall asleep fast so it's not really an issue BUT I didn't have that that much before.
- Working out doesn't feel as refreshing as before
- Massive drop in sport performances as I always feel tired in gym
- All of this started showing up 1-2 years ago.

A little bit of background: 
- I don't remember having sleep difficulties in childhood and during my teenages (15 - 18)

- The first time I complained to my doctor about waking up during the night was at the beginning of my 3rd year in Gymnasium. Her answer : ""You are a bit stressed"". I got prescribed some plant based pills for calming and forgot about them and finished my year well. I also started working out and it was a blessing - I felt amazing everytime and I was so motivated. I worked out 6 times a week and never felt forced. I finished Gymnasium with the best grades of the surrounding schools and have been awarded several prizes.

- After Gymnasium, I did a one year internship in the financial sector in another city. I had to wake up early compared to Gymnasium (5h30 vs 7h00). THAT'S when things became difficult.

> September 2022 : I would often be tired and I knew I wasn't doing good with my sleep schedule but managed to be a top performer in my department and took more responsibilities. 8 coffees a day helped.

> October 2022 : I noticed huge differences in gym performances when I had a good sleep vs when I had not.

> November 2022 to February 2022 : Caught a weird flu that caused me to cough in the evening a lot and absolutely obliterated my sleep. I was clearly sleep deprived and felt bad.

> February 2023: ""Hello doctor I sleep bad."" Her answer : ""Here's melatonin my son"". So I took melatonin for 1 month and I could feel how sleeping well felt. I woke up refreshed and it was amazing. My energy was so high and every problem was gone.

Then I continued with an unstable schedule between work parties finishing at 3 AM, waking up early for work. Melatonin didn't work anymore - it caused(?) me to wake up at 2 AM and not find sleep.
I always had severe bedtime procrastination especially when it meant I had to get go to bed at 8 PM...
I would start skipping gym because ""If I feel tired then I won't perform well"" so I'd tell my gym friend ""Sorry I'm not coming today I'm tired.."" and it became normal. Waking up feeling refreshed was less and less common and I started ""accepting"" this new life. I always told myself ""The day you get a good sleep schedule it'all be fixed"". Finished internship on august 2023.

- First university year in comp.sci
Had to wake up at 5.30 some days of the week, could never keep with a fixed stable schedule. I'd have a hard time falling asleep before those days to meet the minimum amount of sleep.
Noticed congitive impairements, I could tell I was slower and had pain focusing more than before.

ADHD diagnosis :
In December 2023, I decided to do an official IQ test as I always ""felt different"" and I definitely felt slower mentally those times. I remember not being able to tell if I had slept well the day of the test and I got a normal score like 110 however the psy noted a slowed processing speed and said that I should check my attention.
I went to a different psy and gave the IQ report and we proceeded with all the tests including on my childhood and I really recognized myself in many of the questions. Boom I have inattentive ADHD however I always felt like I might be misdiagnosed. Also I finished my first semester at uni with great grades but coming to exams with that kind of mental fatigue that became usual definitely made things harder.

Visited a first psychiatrist to get treated. His answer : "" I think it's dumb to give stimulants to a young boy who is successful like you."" and he sent me to another one because he barely knew adult ADHD and this one had the same reaction and gave me medication. 
The meds really made me feel alert and all and whenever I didn't sleep well (under 8hours) I'd still be alert but felt like a reanimated zombie. 


Sleep schedule :
I also managed to fix my sleep schedule : 
8 PM in bed, at 8.30 PM I sleep and I wake up at 5.30 AM every day even on weekends. It's been like that for 2 months now and I get 8h45 of sleep everyday (based on Sleep Cycle app). I never feel refreshed when I wake up! What's going on ? Why do I need to take stimulants to feel normal while I would feel normal before when I just had enough sleep like qhat I'm doing now for 2 months straight?!

I have that bedtime schedule. I take 1 hour before bed in my dark room to wind down - no screens no light (helps a lot)
I eat 3 meals a day and I don't snack inbetween.
I don't eat fast food. I try to avoid processed food as much as possible and I eat a lot of vegetables.
I only drink water. No alcohol, no coffee.
I take my medication in the morning and it never disturbed my sleep so far.
I still go to gym 4 to 5 times a week despite feeling completely fatigued these 2 last years.
I avoid going to gym close to bedtime and I don't eat huge meals atleast 2 hours before bedtime.
I sleep with a window open, air purifier on, completely dark room with sleep mask and sleep earbuds.

My theories :
1) I was sleep deprived for too long and now my body can't catch up anymore.
2) ADHD could be a misdiagnosis in addition to any of the other points here
3) I have depression ? Each psy said they doubted I have it and I still do many things during the day - I don't feel especially sad. Jusr very fatigued.
4) I have developped sleep apnea recently.

I am extremly confused and I can't bare with this situation anymore. The fatigue and inability to feel as energetic as before is heavily impacting me. 

I really hope this post can help people in similar situations including myself based on the comments.

1gikavu,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1gikavu/todays_the_day/,Today's the day!,"Morning all! 

I've woken up today and given myself a kick up the bum somehow. I had to have stern words with myself and tell inside me that if I threw yesterday's clothes on (for the third day, or maybe fourth) to go and get a new vape coil from my car then I would end up back in my house playing Animal Crossing with my kid all day. Which, to be fair, sounds like a pretty great day (although probably a bit stinky). 

But I'd  still need a shower and still have a messy mind that's stressing about all the stuff I need to do but isn't written down anywhere so it keeps just popping into my head and giving me a pang of guilt and shame and all the stuff that's really not helpful when you need to actually do something about all of the things. And yes that was a long sentence and rambly but this is how my brain is, all the freaking time.

So. I decided that I would go to the car for my vape coil. But only after I'd taken my meds, had a short shower and put some clean clothes on.

Today, just that has helped me shift up a gear. And I know that it doesn't always work out this way, but I'm taking the win.

While I was making my coffee, I had a lightbulb moment. I've read before on this sub about 'costumes' for certain things and it makes sense but has never stuck for me. This morning though, I got that Tiktok reel sound 'It's time to cosplay as a grown up who has their shit together.' So now I've decided I'm going to 'cosplay as a neurotypical person' for the day. 

Brief background to this because I need to be compassionate with myself (HARD) and remind inside me that my circumstances aren't easy anyway. Which doesn't help the ADHD brain because I'm constantly putting myself last. 

Anyhoo... single parent to disabled kid who's not been to school since Dec 23 so now 24/7 carer/educator/cosleeper. Bought a new house a couple of months before the school refusal so hadn't fully unpacked. Still haven't, and am on about my fifth way of organising rooms because kiddo's needs change and house stuff ain't my bag at the best of times. Then we have all the admin involved with kiddo. Again, not my strongest area. And now there's so much of EVERYTHING and I'm going to have to give up work so now all the things that might possibly result in more money or less expenses are shouting at me and shaming me. 

But not today, Satan.

For I am cosplaying as a neurotypical mum who is in control. And I'm posting here to help me be accountable. I have started my list of things so they are not stuck in my head (have tried to attach a pic but Reddit doesn't often like me doing such outrageous things). 

Proceedings have stalled slightly because kiddo needs cuddles at the moment. But when he's sorted, I want to keep cosplaying. And I'll update throughout the day with progress. If anyone wants to join in with a cosplaying, kind of body doubling accountability day, I'd really love to read about it.

I had surgery about 5 weeks ago. Simple decompression without transposition. 

My orthopedic and general physican refused to give me physical therapy treatment which really enrages me because I have no clue with what weights I can stress the arm. 

My orthopedic just recommended to use the arm normally after 2 weeks..... 

So some days ago I started with some light weight training with 1 lbs. And some days ago with 2 lbs. Just some lateral raises and isometric biceps and triceps. Iam not sure if this is right because on the internet I read things about not lifting more than a cup of coffee for about 6 weeks.

What did your doctor/physician say about the allowed weights after surgery? ",1,1730631345.0,CubitalTunnel,0,1.0,False

I paid $382 today at the biggest carwash in town to add on: wheel clean, interior window clean, leather conditioning and a carpet shampoo on a hatchback. I can see why reviews can't be left with this company...
The carpet come up ok but smells like wet socks after being aired properly, maybe something was drawn up that wasn't evident in the car before, but if done long enough with clean or perfumed water, then that wouldn't happen. You would also see the water being drawn back out as dirty and work that area.
The windows weren't cleaned properly. Also there was still sticker residue from a national park sticker that maybe isn't covered in the small print that remained.
The interior plastics only had a quick wipe, so dust was still on many surfaces and along seams. A coffee drop was still evident on the door trim from the last owner among other marks.
The leather conditioning was average. It was nothing more than a quick wipe of the seats, no deeper or more intense than that
The wheels and tyres were clean as paid for.

I realize this is a fight or flight response and that he has little control.  This year his triggers seems to have increased ten fold...me typing on my computer, me unloading/loading the dishwasher, me using a spoon to stir my coffee.  I try hard to be aware of these things, but as the triggers keep increasing it feels like it is every sound and action I take.  Even my voice seems to trigger him at times. Honestly, while it makes me super sad I am ok with not sharing meals.  But now he often is closed up in another room and I am feeling lonely in my own relationship.

I am 21 weeks and my sleep schedule even before being pregnant sucked. Normal for me would be falling asleep at 1am waking up at 3am snd then falling asleep at 5am to 9am.

Since I got pregnant this schedule has continued with the difference that I wake up at 6 am full of energy and cant go back to sleep so I clean.

Tonight was awful. I i went to bed and tried to fall asleep from 1am till like 6:30 to no avail. I am not uncomfortable, I don’t have to pee its just that my brain is in overdrive and wide awake. I managed to fall asleep at 6:30 and woke up again at 7:30, 8, 9 fully awake. At 10:10 am I called it a day and now I am up.

Is this normal? Anything I read its like “its normal you are uncomfortable bla bla” I am not. I don’t go to pee during the night, my baby kicks I don’t feel as they are very delicate and Im neither hot or cold.
