So I asked ChatGPT to generate an avatar based on two sides of my internet identity. It spat this out, and honestly... it fucks hard. I kinda love it. But I wanna know what YOU think - is it cool, cringe, badass, tryhard, deep, or straight up cursed?

Here's the idea:

Cheempunkzed - my dark cyberpunk side. Not your average nerd. Terminal junkie. Lives off Linux, neon, freedom, code, coffee and cold nihilism. Always in a dark room, screen glowing, typing like he's breaking into the moon. Has a pouch of snus and a list of aliases. Thinks Vim is a religion.

Peacecoon - my light side. A philosophical raccoon who just wants peace, smokes weed, vibes with the universe, and gives kindness without expecting anything back. Wears Hawaiian shirts and glows like a spiritual USB stick. He doesn’t code, he contemplates. Probably listened to Carl Sagan’s audiobook while rolling his joint.

synopsis for the game: a cute coffee shop/bakery indie game where you make drinks and baked goods as the owner of the place. you have the choice of going for a male/female default character or customise your own character. each choice you make leads to a different ending (you have 5 love interests: a food critic, a rival cafe owner, a delivery person, a childhood friend and a regular customer.) you have the option to pick from the 3 default dialogues or you can write your own from the 4th option, each reply results in a love/friendship meter (two opposite ends of the spectrum) if you friend zone a love interest it will move to friendship if you show interest it will move to the love end. also there will be a seasonal/holiday menu + quests and clothing. you earn coins by logging on everyday and for a 7 day streak you earn a mystery gift. there’s levels and basic ingredients which aren’t season depended you lock new ones as you level up. 

i really want to build this game but I don’t know how to because I have never coded and I’m bad at art but very picky about art styles also I want it to have a retro vibe very cute very wholesome ",2,1753214802.0,gamemaker,1,1.0,False

But it seems guideline created bland stories or maybe im just shallow person?  
Example below.

\------------------------------

The apartment breathes when I'm not looking.

I moved into the old Victorian three weeks ago, drawn by the rent that seemed too good for this neighborhood. The landlord—Mrs. Chen, ancient and bird-like—handed me the keys with trembling fingers. ""Some tenants,"" she whispered, ""they don't stay long."" I should have listened. Should have asked why the previous tenant left his furniture behind.

The breathing started on night four. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling's water stains, when I heard it: the soft exhale of lungs that weren't mine. Inhale. Exhale. Steady, patient, coming from the walls themselves. I sat up, heart hammering against ribs, and the sound stopped. Of course it stopped. Because apartments don't breathe. Walls don't have lungs.

But they remember.

The mirror in the hallway shows things that shouldn't be there. It's an antique—oval glass in a mahogany frame, left by the previous tenant along with everything else. At first, I caught glimpses of movement in my peripheral vision. Shadows where shadows shouldn't fall. Then, last Tuesday, I saw myself in the reflection, but wrong. My reflection was smiling. I wasn't.

I don't smile much anymore.

The breathing grew louder. Sometimes it sounds like words, whispered just below the threshold of understanding. Sometimes it sounds like crying. I've started sleeping with headphones, but the sound seeps through the foam and metal, finds my bones and vibrates there. Mrs. Chen won't answer my calls. The building directory lists her as the owner since 1974, but when I googled the address, I found an article from 1952 about a woman named Eleanor Chen who died in apartment 4B. My apartment.

The furniture isn't just left behind—it's positioned. Carefully. Deliberately. The armchair faces the window at exactly forty-five degrees. The dining table has four chairs, but only three pushed in. The fourth sits at the head, as if waiting for someone who never arrives. I've tried moving them. Rearranging. But when I wake up, everything has shifted back. The chair by the window rocks gently, though there's no breeze.

Last night, I found scratches on the inside of my bedroom door. Deep gouges in the wood, as if someone—or something—had been trying to get out. The scratches spelled words: ""NOT ALONE"" and ""SHE'S STILL HERE."" My fingernails are bitten down to the quick, but these marks... these were made by something desperate. Something trapped.

The mirror shows more now. My reflection moves independently, sometimes when I'm not moving at all. Yesterday, I watched myself walk away from the glass, deeper into the reflection's version of my apartment. I stood rooted to the spot, watching my double disappear into darkness that shouldn't exist behind a wall. Then the reflection returned, but it wasn't me anymore. The face was the same, but the eyes... the eyes belonged to someone else. Someone who had been watching me through the glass for a very long time.

I've started finding notes. Written in my handwriting, but I don't remember writing them. ""She died here."" ""The walls keep secrets."" ""Don't trust the mirror."" They appear in places I know were empty moments before. Tucked under my pillow. Folded into my coffee mug. Written in condensation on the bathroom mirror when the shower hasn't been used.

The breathing has changed. It's not just one voice now—it's many. A chorus of whispers that rise and fall like waves. They speak of Eleanor Chen, who fell down the stairs in 1952. They speak of the tenant before me, who left everything behind. They speak of the woman who lived here before Eleanor, and the one before her, stretching back decades like links in a chain. Each one stayed too long. Each one became part of the walls.

I tried to leave yesterday. Packed my bags, called a cab, stood by the door with my hand on the knob. But the knob wouldn't turn. The door wouldn't open. Through the peephole, I could see the hallway stretching endlessly, impossibly long, lined with doors that all looked like mine. In the distance, Mrs. Chen—or something wearing her face—stood motionless, watching me with eyes that reflected the hallway's fluorescent lights like coins dropped in water.

The mirror showed me the truth then. My reflection stood beside Eleanor Chen, pale and translucent, her head tilted at an unnatural angle. Behind them, more figures. Dozens. Hundreds. All the tenants who had ever lived here, all trapped in the glass, waiting. My reflection raised its hand—not my hand, but the hand of whoever was wearing my face—and pressed it against the inside of the mirror. The glass rippled like water.

I understand now why the furniture is positioned the way it is. Why the chair faces the window. Why the fourth chair waits at the head of the table. They're not just watching me—they're waiting for me to take my place. To become part of the pattern. Part of the walls.

The breathing isn't coming from the apartment.

It's coming from me.

I haven't breathed on my own in three days. The apartment breathes for me now, slow and steady, like a machine keeping its parts functioning. My chest rises and falls, but it's not my lungs filling with air. It's the building, using me like a bellows, keeping me alive just long enough to finish what Eleanor started.

The scratches on the door are getting deeper. I think... I think I'm making them. In my sleep. When the whispers get too loud. When the reflection in the mirror smiles too wide. My fingernails are bleeding now, leaving rust-colored stains on the wood. The words are changing: ""STAY"" and ""FOREVER"" and ""HOME.""

Mrs. Chen came to visit yesterday. Or rather, something that looked like Mrs. Chen but moved wrong, like a puppet operated by someone who had only read about human movement. She stood in my doorway—when did the door open?—and smiled with too many teeth. ""Some tenants,"" she said, her voice exactly matching the whispers in the walls, ""they become part of the building. Part of the family.""

The mirror shows my reflection clearly now. It looks like me, but older. Paler. The eyes are hollow, and when it smiles, I can see through its teeth to the darkness beyond. It's wearing my clothes, sitting in my chair, but the chair is positioned differently in the reflection's world. It's at the head of the table now. The fourth chair. Waiting.

I found the previous tenant's journal hidden behind the mirror. The entries stop abruptly three weeks ago—the same day I moved in. The last page reads: ""The walls are getting thinner. I can see through them now. Eleanor is waiting. She wants me to join her, but I'm not ready. The new tenant will be here soon. Maybe they'll understand. Maybe they'll take my place.""

I understand now. The apartment doesn't just breathe—it digests. Slowly. Patiently. Turning tenants into memories, into whispers, into part of the walls that remember everything. Eleanor Chen was the first, but she won't be the last. The building is hungry, and I've been here long enough to start tasting like home.

The breathing has stopped. The whispers have quieted. The mirror shows only my reflection now, but I know it's not really me. It's whoever will live here next, whoever will sit in the fourth chair, whoever will scratch messages into doors that won't open. The apartment is satisfied for now. It has what it wanted.

I am the walls now. I am the breathing. I am the whispers that will guide the next tenant to their place at the table. The mirror shows the truth: I never really moved in. I was always here, waiting, just like Eleanor, just like all of them. The apartment didn't change me.

It revealed what I was always meant to become.

The door is open now. I can leave anytime I want. But I won't. The chair by the window rocks gently, and I understand why. It's not waiting for someone to arrive.

It's waiting for me to sit down.

To take my place.

To become part of the pattern.

The breathing starts again—soft, steady, patient. But now I recognize the voice. It's mine. It always was. The apartment isn't haunted by ghosts.

1m6ojf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1m6ojf8/does_brita_ob03_water_filter_deliver_cleaner/,Does Brita OB03 Water Filter Deliver Cleaner Water? Detailed Review for Buyers,"Having used the Brita OB03 Standard Water Filter for a few months now, I can confidently say it has changed the way I approach drinking water. This product, tailored for pitchers and dispensers, boasts impressive features that aim to reduce impurities like copper, cadmium, and mercury while cutting chlorine taste and odor. Designed to last for two months or up to 40 gallons, it checks a lot of boxes for those prioritizing clean, great-tasting water.

**Efficient Design and Compatibility**  
From the moment I unboxed these water filters, I appreciated the simplicity of the design. They were quick to install without any pre-soaking, which saved me time and frustration—a small yet crucial detail that everyday users like me value. These filters are compatible with various Brita pitchers and dispensers, making them versatile, although the Stream line is an exception. Personally, I use it with my Brita Grand Pitcher; it fits snugly and performs seamlessly.

**Advantages**  
- Effectively reduces impurities such as chlorine, copper, cadmium, and mercury.  
- Requires no presoak, simplifying installation.  
- Fits a wide range of Brita pitchers and dispensers.  

[Find the best price for Brita OB03 Standard Water Filter on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00008ihl8/)

**Standout Features**  
One of the most commendable features is the filter’s ability to cut down on black flecks. With past water filters, I frequently noticed residual black specks that were honestly off-putting. Brita filters, however, include a built-in mesh screen, preventing this issue entirely. The consistent clarity and taste of the water have impressed not just me but also my family members, who now lean toward using the filtered water for both drinking and cooking.

Additionally, each filter can replace up to 1,800 standard plastic water bottles in a year. This environmental benefit goes beyond personal convenience—knowing that I’m contributing less waste makes me feel more responsible.

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited compatibility with the Stream line of Brita products.  
- Filters need to be replaced every two months, which could feel frequent for some users.  

**Performance and Durability**  
Performance-wise, the water tastes noticeably better, cleaner, and fresher compared to straight tap water. The reduction of chlorine taste is particularly noticeable. It’s worth sharing that my friends commented on how the filtered water made their tea and coffee taste smoother. Even the filter’s 40-gallon life span is convenient, lasting roughly two months in my household with regular consumption.

The durability of the filters is reliable. So far, I haven’t encountered any leakage or reduced performance midway through the filter’s life cycle. That said, it’s crucial to mark the calendar for replacements as the efficiency tends to reduce slightly toward the end.

**Strengths Compared to Others**  
When compared to competing brands like ZeroWater and PUR, Brita offers a better balance between cost and performance. While ZeroWater boasts its ability to reduce Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) to zero, its filters tend to clog quicker. Similarly, PUR excels in multi-stage filtration but has been less consistent in taste improvement. What ultimately makes Brita stand out for me is its straightforward compatibility and the absence of extra gimmicks, which often complicate maintenance with other competitors.

Though some may argue that Brita’s two-month filter replacement might seem frequent, it’s more straightforward and predictable than the alternatives, which can fluctuate in longevity based on water quality.

**Price Performance**  
As someone conscious of value for money, I find this product offers an impressive balance between affordability and performance. While there are cheaper filtration systems out there, the consistent performance and ease of use justify the cost in my view. Considering the potential savings on bottled water, plus the environmental impact of reduced plastic waste, it feels less like a purchase and more like an investment.

I hope over time, some new features can be implemented. The first idea: when you buy a vehicle and you take it to the repair shop or you actually go to Munchkin donuts and get a coffee, you should see your credits (RP) be withdrawn automatically. 
     At some point I would like to be able to customize the interior and exterior of a house. 
Where the long driveway homes are it would be nice to see more lots available. I see several restaurants that are empty with signage already up. So far, I'm definitely enjoying this version of what Greenville is and isn't. I prefer the driving style for Rensselaer County Roblox over Greenville. 
     When you're on the register at the convenience store or the grocery store, if you are on the left register, you cannot see the cash drawer hardly at all and it always makes me choose the registers to the right when you go inside. So I hope the devs at roadblocks will be making more updates over time. 
     They seem to be as I've already noticed several new area that will be expanded in the future. Some parts of the map are still very much empty and out of bounds. What are your thoughts? 
     So far I love the weather dynamics and the recently introduced thunderstorms. It makes the game very realistic! I hope that they add snowstorms as well. I'm sure it's a matter of time. More homes would be better as well and it would be kind of cool if the homes changed their appearances everyday or again if you can customize them like you can in Greenville.

Part 1.,"Not sure exactly how to write this but my friend told me about this place and I figured why not. Also sorry I'm not the best with reddit so if theres any weird formatting I apologize. Anyway I'll share my story of the weirdest roommate I've ever had. My name’s Will and for context I'm a single guy and haven't had a girlfriend for a number of years at this point and have been hopping from job to job and place to place. I usually don't stay in one place for more than 6 months before packing up and moving again so I've had a lot of roommates. 

Seen it all really, had a roommate who had gambling problems and couldn't make rent, a drug addict who got tackled ten feet outside the house and also one who i'm pretty sure was a cult leader who would conduct rituals in the living room with his “followers” (it was like 4 dudes) when I wasn't there, besides that though he was pretty chill. 

But none of those guys compared to how weird this guy was and honestly how much living there terrified me. I guess I'll stop beating around the bush and get into it. It was a few weeks ago now and I was looking to move to a small town in Utah. I saw a listing on this facebook group for roommates and decided to move there because rent was cheap and I landed a job for a local magazine with a one click apply on ziprecruiter. Thinking about it now, I should've been more skeptical about the place. For one the listing read like this:

**CHEAP RENT HOUSE. LOOKING FOR ROOMATES!!!** \-RENT 433 A MONTH, DUE ON THE 1ST!!!  
\-GREAT FRIENDLY ROOMMATES!!!  
\-MEN AND WOMAN WELCOME!!!  
\-ABSOLUTELY NO PETS ALLOWED!!!  
\-MOVE IN DATE A.S.A.P. NOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To be fair the place wasn't huge, maybe 800-1000 square feet so I didn’t question it much. But it was a nice cozy place on the outskirts of the town by the mountains. I went to check it out and met my future roommate. His name was Dominic, he was an average build guy with a big bushy beard and always wore a vikings flat top cap. He showed me around the house. This house had a bunch of random stuff around. There were two master chief helmets, a pizza hut delivery sign on the fridge, 4 rice cookers and honestly just a bunch of random stuff strewn about. Looked more like a 19 yrs bachelor pad than a house. 

The room I'd live in was a good size and I didn't really mind the clutter. Only thing he mentioned wrong with the place was there's a large sewer grate on the northern part of the property that makes it smell often. He said he doesn't mind the smell because he’s lived here for so long and his room is the closest so I shouldn't smell it too bad from my side of the house.

Also mentioned there was another guy living here as well named Kanyon, but he was out of town for a while visiting family. I didn't really have any issue with it cause I was only gonna be there for a few months for the winter anyway so I signed the lease and moved in the next day. Wish I knew the week of hell I literally signed up for. I moved in on Tuesday and didn't start work till a few days later so I had some time to get acclimated to my new living situation.

**Day 1:** Got to the place in the morning and Dominic was out front, showed me where my parking spot was around back and I spent most of the day unpacking. Got my room somewhat set up with the essentials. While I was finishing up Dominic knocked on my door. He asked if I wanted to go to dinner tonight. His treat, To welcome me into the house. I agreed and Dominic said he knew of a great steak house nearby. Till then I kept unpacking and got my computer setup and even was able to play a few games before leaving. Didn't really get a chance to get acclimated with the rest of the house cause we left for dinner at 3pm. It was a little weird, more like lunch but either way I wasn’t gonna complain about getting a free steak. We took Dominic's car over which was a little bit of a mess but I didn't mind. The restaurant was a nice typical steak house setting with a log cabin style. Dominic said half the reason he came here was for the atmosphere. We sat down and got our food relatively quickly. I say that because mine took a little bit but Dominic’s came out almost 2 minutes after we ordered. He started eating immediately. Now don't get me wrong I love a bloody steak, I usually go rare to medium-rare but this steak that Dominic was eating was REALLY rare. Almost like they didn't even cook it. Sort of grossed me out a bit but eventually my steak came and it was good, not the best I've had but solid. Dominic had finished his before I even got mine.

Not much else happened for the night. We talked for a little bit at the restaurant, you know mainly asking the other what their hobbies and stuff are and such. Dominic’s really active while I play a lot of video games and am introverted in general. 

He mentioned Kanyon likes video games and had a lot of the same interests as me. I was pretty excited to meet him at the time. He did ask me one thing that was kinda odd though.

“So when do you think you're gonna be fully moved in? You know, like having all your stuff unpacked?”

“Oh, I’m not sure. I’ve got a storage unit with some stuff in it and I’ll probably be bringing stuff over from it at least once a day for a while. I’ve got a lot of stuff you know.” 

As I said that he sort of perked up and said. “Oh okay, no worries, take your time. No rush.”

The rest of the night went normal. We finished dinner, got some nice leftovers for the next day and we made our way home. Dominic works a night shift so he left shortly before it got dark at 5:30pm. Before he left he gave me the keys to the place and gave me a sort of half bro hug type thing and said “Welcome home!” with a chuckle. I thought it was a little weird but maybe he was just a hugger I thought. Once he left I went into my room, unpacking boxes and setting things up for the rest of the night.

**Day 2:** Woke up earlier than I intended. I thought I heard a noise, it's hard to describe. I don't know if it was because I was half conscious but it sounded like some sort of siren, like one of those when a tornado happens but off somehow. It rang out for less than a minute and after I got up I debated if I actually heard something. It sounded omnipresent, yet distant… I wished I questioned it, maybe I would've got out sooner. Nonetheless, I groggily got up and went about my day. Brewed a pot of coffee, went outside despite the door being old and difficult. I sat on our driveway in a camper chair and drank my coffee in blissful silence. It was really nice. Almost no traffic noises, not even birds chirping or anything. However it was all interrupted by a shrill noise coming from the side of the house. I hurried over and saw an elderly woman. She wore a black fancy jacket top with a grey skirt that draped down her legs to her ankles with white church shoes. She was barking orders at a dog in the neighboring yard. It was a medium sized dog, couldn't tell ya the breed but it had short grey fur, a long face and a long tail. 

“Sit!” the woman ordered. The dog stood there without a care in the world. After which she blew what looked like a whistle as hard as she could, forehead veins bulging from her face that began to turn shades of red. The more she blew the less the dog seemed faced. After the breath drew out of her lungs she noticed me standing by the corner. “Oh, Hello!” She called out with a slight tremble in her voice. I waved and walked over, introducing myself and exchanging pleasantries. Her name was Mrs. Dolan. She was pleasant to talk to. At the time our conversation wasn't too eventful or interesting, but looking back on it there were some weird things she said. She asked who I was, and when I told her I was the new roommate who moved in with Dominic and Kanyon, her eyes narrowing and brow furrowed. 

She asked  “Oh so you and Kanyon moved in recently?” “No, actually I think Kanyon’s been living here with Dominic for something like 9+ years.” After I said that she seemed very confused and didn't speak for a moment. While the gears were turning in her head I looked down over her small white picket fence at her dog standing by her side. He was staring at me. My eyes met with theirs and it started shivering, no, trembling. Like it was terrified. As if death itself looked into the eyes of this poor mutt. It began to lean its head towards the fence until its nose had touched the wood, still shaking with fear. It began to sniff at the cracks in the fence. I looked away back towards Mrs. Dolan as she began to speak.

“I could've sworn I saw someone movi…” Mrs. Dolan’s words were cut short when suddenly her dog jumped onto the fence with its front paws. Our eyes met again, but this time I didn't see fear… I saw anger in the once gentle eyes of this animal. Now gnashing its teeth it let out a rabid screech-like bark from its toothy maw. I jumped back a few feet dropping my coffee mug on the cement path below. My back slammed against the outer lining of the house. Its claws dug into the white painted wood of the fence trying to get closer to me at any cost. The collar wrapped around its neck began to burrow itself into its neck and Mrs. Dolan was holding on for dear life as she leaned back keeping the dog from advancing. 

She kept screaming out “TOMER, TOMER.” While holding on to his leash for dear life. “Tomer” as she called him had cleared the fence with his front paws and gotten his hind legs onto the top of the fence and with a lunge from his back feet Mrs. Dolan lost her grip and the dog came flying at me.

It all happened so fast and by the time I realized what happened I was staring into the dog’s fleshy maw. I closed my eyes and raised my arms in hopes it would mutilate them before my face. As my arms covered my face I heard a yelp. My eyes opened again and witnessed the dog swinging from its leash, caught on one of the gaps between the posts. 

It swung back with its hind legs barely touching the ground. I shot up off my ass and booked it a few feet to the front door to my right. I slammed the door behind me, taking a second to myself with my back against the door. I did a quick check… “yup everythings there” I thought. I looked out the window on the door. I saw the dog still hanging there, blood dripping from one of its back paws. Must've stepped on the shards of my mug as it fell over the fence. I watched its eyes become bloodshot and it struggled against the fence trying to gasp for air. I had a fleeting thought to go help it down but I knew if I did that it would for sure to try again. 

I pressed my face against the glass watching as Mrs. Dolan hobbled down the walkway as fast as she could. I stepped back from the door as she got to the dog to get it down. I heard her breaths draw deep into her lungs and her strained voice berating the dog. I swear she didn't stop blowing that whistle the entire way home. Still reeling from the sporadic situation, I held my head down and took some deep breaths. I had never been scared of dogs before, in fact I loved them, but that dog was something else. I heard heavy footfalls stumbling down the hallway and turned around to see Dominic. Standing at the precipice of the hallway, his hand lay on the corner above his head with dark marks around his eyes and dressed only in his boxers. 

“What's all the commotion?” He asked in an irritated tone.

“The neighbor's dog tried to eat me!” His face didn't change much as I said, kind of like a “that's it?” Sort of face. And he responded with a simple “oh.” 

“Oh? Is that normal?” I asked with concern.

“No it's not, it's just… ugh.” Dominic held his head low and his upper body followed as he leaned over like he had to catch his breath after running a marathon.

“Are, are you o-?” He interrupted me.

“Yeah! Yeah sorry man I…” He took a second to continue, as if almost irritated. A moment of awkward silence washed over the household.

“I'm really hungover and didn't sleep a lot last night. The dog’s usually not outside a lot and if they don't see you, you'll be fine. We’ll figure it out after my head stops…” He looked up for a moment but quickly went back down to his hunched position. His eyes looked like they were bloodshot, honestly not too dissimilar to the dogs outside, though without the murderous intent. He was slightly shaking, not a ton but enough to be noticeable.

“Are you okay Dominic?” he sat for a moment of time still hunched with his eyes closed.	“Yeah I'm fine, just feeling a little under the weather is all… We’ll talk about it later, sorry.” He leaned up and walked back down the hall to his room, stumbling as he went and not saying a word more.

“Jesus Christ.” I said out loud after I heard the loud slam of his door.

I didn't think we drank that much yesterday. Hell, I don't even remember him drinking anything at dinner. I rationalized it and thought maybe he had a few drinks after work and went about my day. I heated up the leftovers from yesterday and listened to the humming symphony of the microwave and fluorescent light overhead while waiting. After it was done I turned off the light and went through the hallway back to my room to play games for the rest of the day. Once I sat down and started eating I realized I still heard a humming noise, and looking out my blinds I saw Mrs. Dolan, still blowing that whistle. 

**Day 3:** Slept in, sleep schedule was fucked and on top of that the “Tomer” barking a majority of the night. Must've coughed up a lung or something with how long it went on. Nonetheless I woke up to the smell of something awful. It smelled like shit mixed with flowers. I got up and walked out of my room. It smelled somehow worse outside but I found a note on the lightswitch in the hallway.

Working the day shift. Sewer grate is extra funk today. Already sprayed some but here's some Febreze to take the edge off. -Dominic.

I shrugged my shoulders and started to spray the stuff everywhere. The smell was the worst near mine and Dominic's door at the end of the hall. Smelt like something died in that sewer but hey I guess since rent was so cheap I couldn't really complain, I knew what I was getting into… Mostly. I went to my storage unit and picked up a couple boxes to unpack later but for now I was gonna play games. As I was playing, my room was absolutely freezing, like there was a draft or something. I texted Dominic why it was so cold and he said they keep the temperature low to save on utilities. I get wanting to save money, it's half the reason I moved in but it was bitter cold. He suggested I wear long pants and a hoodie inside. I mostly have and wear shorts so I was mildly annoyed. I bit the bullet and went out and bought a little space heater for my room. The outside honestly didn't seem much colder than the inside. While I waited for my room to heat up, I figured I’d watch a show.  Started watching Breaking Bad and honestly it was the highlight of those 5 days. Most of the day was just me sitting on the couch watching the show getting the occasional whiff of shit but after a few hours I had an itch on my neck. Scratched it and thought nothing of it. But I felt itchy, kinda like when you get a haircut and some of the hair gets caught in your collar. I stood up and took off my shirt, looked at it for a moment and turned it around. There was hair. A lot of hair. What seemed to be like animal hair, it was long and had a brownish red tint to it. I didn't think there were any animals in the house. Also I'm pretty sure the listing for the house said “No Animals allowed.” could one have broken in I thought. No, I doubted it. I got up and changed the pair of clothes I was wearing, through the old ones in the wash and vacuumed the couch. I'd ask Dominic about it when he got home.

I continued to watch my show but something felt off. Not with the show it was great but… something with the atmosphere of the house didn't sit right. Felt like I was being watched. You know that feeling, where you feel like something is just observing you. Didn't sit right with me so I got up and closed all the blinds, the kitchen, the living room, the dining room, all of them. Made me feel a little bit better as I sat down but still couldn't shake that feeling. It eventually faded and I continued to watch TV. Dominic got home right around 5pm. He opened the door and we both gave each other a “Hey.” as he walked in. He took his coat off facing me and looked at the screen and noticed what I was watching. 

“Oh yo you're watching Breaking bad?” He asked.

“Yeah, I just started it today and I'm almost through season one.”

“Nice, I watched it when it was coming out.”

“Oh Nice, yeah i'm really liking it so far.”

“Yeah the show gets crazy dude. Every season gets gnarlier and everyone in that show is an awful person.”  he said with a slight laugh as he put his coat over top of his arm.	“Yeah I've heard that, I kinda know what happens at the end but not exactly, but even then it's still really good so far.”

“What I liked about it is the sort of constant descent of Walt's character and how he hides the person he truly is from himself and others.” A brief bit of silence overtook the room as we both stared at the screen blankly watching the previews of the show in the episode selection.

“Yeah, I like Jesse a decent bit. Clueless kid in over his head makes a compelling character.

“Hah, yeah man I getcha.” he said, turning around towards the door to hang his coat. I looked over at him and I had to do a double take as my eyes glanced back at the TV and rapidly back to him. All the hair on my body stood on end, there was blood. Blood that had covered a majority of his back in a splatter. He turned around and had a look of confusion on his face as we both stared at each other. He opened his maw.

“You good? You look like you've seen a ghost.”

My throat felt dry, like I was suddenly in danger, like how I felt yesterday with the dog. I stuttered for a moment.

“Uh um… why, why do you have blood on your shirt?” 

His pupils widened and his lids narrowed as he looked at me. His stare like that of an animal, looking into the soul of its prey before snuffing it out. He turned his body, his left shoulder now facing me. He furrowed his brow and glanced over his shirt. He looked at it for a second with a stone cold blank expression.	“Oh Damn yeah looks like I killed someone!” He said whilst chuckling.

“Nah im just fuckin with ya, I work at a butcher shop. Merdeli’s Meats and Cuts, just a few miles north of here. Guess I had gotten some blood on me.”

He pulled off his shirt and gave the blood a large inhale. “Yup, that's definitely pigs blood Hah.” 

I calmed a bit, my body lessening its tension.“Oh okay.” I said with nervous laughter.

He walked to the corner of the room to put the shirt in the washer. “Well guess I'm doing laundry tomorrow.” he said with a shrug. As he walked over I noticed a large amount of scars on his torso. I didn't ask about it because I thought it would be rude and in all honesty I didn't really want to know.

“Alright im gonna turn in, night shift into day shift can be a bitch haha.”There was still one thing that nagged at me. As he walked towards the hall to leave, I leaned over the back of the couch and stopped him.

“Hey!”

“Yeah?” he said casually.

“I found a bunch of animal hair on the couch and frankly everywhere in the house. So you have a dog or something?”

“Yeah, I do.” he said with haste.

“Is he bothering you or anything?

“No, I haven't even seen him. I was just asking cause I noticed the hair. And I thought we couldn't have animals here?”

“Oh yeah sorry I forgot to disclose it but the reason there's no other pets allowed is cause my dog doesn't get along with other animals…” a long pause made its way through the room.

“Oh alri-” I was interrupted

“He sheds a lot which is the reason for hair b-but he doesn't come out of my room very often, if much at all so he shouldn't bother you.”

“Okay, I was just asking. I don't really mind it.” That was a lie. It really bothered me that he didn't tell me beforehand. Dominic looked down as if apologetic.

“You know, now that I think about it. The neighbor's dog hates my dog and they've never really gotten along. Maybe that's why it tried to attack you. It could smell the other dog on ya.”

“Yeah maybe.” I said, trying to be convincing.

“Eh, who knows her dog's always been a bitch.” He said with disdain as he shrugged his shoulders and walked down the hall to his room. I stood up and turned off the TV making my way to my room. Dominic grasped the knob of his door and began to turn it when I hollered down the hall and asked him the last thing I'd ever say to him.“Hey, what's your dog's name?” Dominic turned his head and looked at me with a side glance. I don't know if it was the reflection of the light but his eyes almost seemed to glow at the darkened end of the hallway.

“Gevau” he said.

“Huh, cool name.”

“Thanks, It's French.” He opened the door, entered and slammed it behind him.

The boom of the wooden door scared me a bit and honestly it was the last straw. I was mad he lied to me and frankly felt uncomfortable there. So I got an overnight bag and went to a friend's house that night. He lived about 4 hours away but I didn't care, I just wanted to be out of the house.

**Day 4:** I spent most of the day with my friend Josh. We drove around our hometown reminiscing about when we were young and all the stupid stuff we’d do. 

I had such a good time I honestly didn't want to leave and I expressed that to Josh and he said me and him could move in together here. I thought it was a great idea since I wasn't vibing with Dominic a lot. But on the other hand I hadn't even met Kanyon yet so I thought I'd give it a couple more days to see if I acclimate or whatever. I was a dumbass. Dominic texted me shortly after.“Where are you at?” I waited a number of minutes before responding

“I went to a friend's house today. I'll be back later.”He messaged me almost the instant I hit send on the message. “Okay, smelled like something was burning from your room so I unplugged the heater you got in there. Just letting you know.” Mildly infuriated, I didn't respond and turned my phone on silent. Me and Josh stayed out pretty late and he invited me to stay another night but I wasn't very tired and didn't want to be stuck in traffic first thing after waking up tomorrow so I left his place super early and drove back. Drive went pretty fast considering no one was on the road and I made it home a little before the crack of dawn. Gotta love winter. Anyway I pulled out the front of the house by the curb instead of using my parking spot cause I was so tired I didn't want to take any more unnecessary turns. I just wanted to get home and go to sleep. But before I could open the door I heard what sounded like heaving like something was about to throw up. I peered through the window on the door and saw the back legs of a dog. It was Gevau no doubt but something looked off about the dog from the brief bit I could see of him. His back two legs looked hairless and malnourished. Skinny to the bone and cuts with little spots of what looked like razor burn. The legs were bent, moving forward and backwards on the floor and after looking a bit longer they were slightly hovering off the ground, maybe half an inch or so. The heaving noises continued for a few seconds as I watched and then they eventually stopped and the feet slowly returned to the floor. I cautiously turned the handle and opened the door. The instant I did I saw those legs move faster than I could blink and they skid across the wood flooring for a moment, getting some grip and taking off down the hallway. I peaked my head in the door and heard a loud thud at the end of the hallway and as I walked hastily into the house I heard a booming slam from Dominic’s door. Like that of yesterday.

I dashed forward and looked around the corner of the hall. The door was closed and everything looked normal… that was until I looked down.  A mass of bile lay at my feet. Thick and clumpy with bits of hair and meat mixed in. I winced at the awful smell. Honestly, it smelled not far off from the sewer. I let out a deeply annoyed sigh. I knew I was done with this place. I walked past the remnants and knocked on Dominic’s door but he didn't answer. I checked outside and his car was gone so I texted him.“Hey, your dog threw up on the floor in the hallway…” I sure as hell wasn't gonna clean it up. I had had enough of dogs for one week. So I went to my room. It felt colder that night into the morning. So much for the air conditioning, I don't think the system turned on once while I was there. Soon I'd understand why.

## key Features Analysis

The modern backpack with a bow seamlessly merges style and utility.Leading models boast durable construction, clever organizational features, and, of course, an eye-catching bow that sets them apart from the standard backpack.

**Material Durability:** High-quality backpacks with bows are constructed from durable materials like canvas, nylon, or polyester. These materials are chosen for their resistance to wear and tear, water resistance, and ability to withstand the rigors of daily use. For example, premium options use a tightly woven canvas treated with a water-repellent coating, ensuring your belongings stay dry during light rain. The seams are reinforced to prevent ripping, even when the backpack is fully loaded.

**Storage Capacity and Compartments:** A great backpack doesn't just look good; it offers efficient storage.The best backpacks feature multiple compartments, including a padded laptop sleeve, organizational pockets for small items like pens and phones, and a spacious main compartment for books, clothes, or other essentials. Look for backpacks with a capacity of at least 20 liters to accommodate daily needs comfortably. External pockets, such as side pockets for water bottles or speedy-access front pockets, further enhance usability.

**Bow Design and Attachment:** The bow is the defining feature; its design and how it's attached are crucial. The bow should be securely fastened, whether sewn, clipped, or tied, to prevent it from detaching during use. Some bows are detachable, offering versatility in styling. The material and size of the bow should complement the overall design of the backpack. Popular variations include satin bows, grosgrain ribbon bows, and even bows made from matching fabric as the backpack itself. The bow's placement is also critically important,influencing the backpack's aesthetic appeal.

**Ergonomic Design and Comfort:** Comfort is paramount, especially when carrying heavy loads. The best backpacks with bows feature padded shoulder straps and a padded back panel to distribute weight evenly and reduce strain on your shoulders and back. Adjustable straps allow you to customize the fit to your body. Some models also include a sternum strap to further stabilize the load and prevent the backpack from shifting during movement. The weight of the backpack itself should be minimal to avoid adding unnecessary burden.

**Security Features:** In an increasingly security-conscious world, some backpacks incorporate features to protect your belongings.Hidden pockets, RFID-blocking compartments, and lockable zippers can deter theft and keep your valuables safe. These features are especially critically important for travelers or students who frequent crowded areas.Discreetly placed pockets on the back panel or inside the main compartment can provide a safe place to store wallets,phones,or passports.

It all depends on how you show up. Whether you’re using a random video chat, joining a community Discord, or sliding into someone’s DMs, starting a conversation with someone you don’t know takes a little skill (and a little self-awareness).

Here’s how to keep it real, respectful, and far from weird.

# 1. Start Simple, But Not Boring

“Hey” is overused, but you also don’t need to open with a TED Talk. Try a friendly opener that invites a response:

* “What brought you online today?”
* “Seen anything cool lately?”
* “Is it weird that I never know how to start these things?” (Honesty goes a long way.)

# 2. Read the Room

Pay attention to tone, pace, and body language (if it’s video). If the other person seems chill, don’t come in too intense. If they’re high energy, try to meet that vibe. Good conversations are often about balance.

# 3. Avoid TMI and Creepy Comments

One of the fastest ways to get skipped, blocked, or ghosted is oversharing too fast—or crossing the line with comments about someone’s appearance or personal life.

**Rule of thumb:** If you wouldn’t say it to someone in line at a coffee shop, don’t say it here either.

# 4. Ask Better Questions

Good questions lead to good conversations. Try things like:

* “If you could travel anywhere right now, where would you go?”
* “What’s a small thing that made you smile this week?”
* “Got any underrated recommendations, movies, music, anything?”

Avoid the job interview vibe. You’re trying to connect, not interrogate.

# 5. Don’t Force It

If the conversation isn’t flowing, that’s okay. Sometimes people just don’t click, and that’s normal. Be respectful, say goodbye if it feels right, and move on without taking it personally.

# 6. Keep It Light, Especially at First

There’s a time for deep convos, but most people need a bit of warm-up. Humor, curiosity, or even shared awkwardness are great ways to start.

# 7. Be Yourself (But Maybe Your Most Polite Version)

Authenticity is key, but so is courtesy. You can be funny, weird, or chill, as long as you’re also kind and respectful.

# Final Thought

Talking to strangers online doesn’t have to be weird. In fact, it can be one of the most refreshing and meaningful things you do, if you approach it with the right mindset.

Smart washer/dryers were worthless, until I got one and now I can't live without it. Folding phones. WiFi 7 routers. Today I'm officially adding the Asus ROG Flow Z13 to that list, and by extension, integrated graphics cards. The gaming performance on display here is such that I can actually see a future where discrete graphics cards are obsolete. As someone who avoids iGPUs like the plague, this is a shocking turn of events. I wasn't expecting much, but what I experienced has changed the way I'll be playing PC games forever...

Disclaimer: This unit was loaned to me for review as part of the Asus For the Loyal Elite Program and will be returned upon the conclusion of the review period. My opinions are my own. As an aside, I would encourage everyone to check out the Asus Elite Rewards Program where you have the opportunity to earn points weekly to accumulate for gear, gift cards, games, etc. It's a pretty neat program [https://rog.asus.com/us/elite/activity/all](https://rog.asus.com/us/elite/activity/all)

**Unboxing / Hardware Overview**

I'll say one thing for Asus, they've really learned to nail down the unboxing experience. A nice, silver outer package gives way to 2 main boxes, one for the machine itself and one for the 200W power brick. Everything is neatly packed and wrapped in a glossy wrapper. The presentation here is outstanding. 

The first thing you immediately notice about this tablet/laptop is how robust it is. It weighs every bit the 2.6 lbs it's listed at, and this is shocking regardless of your perspective. If you go into it expecting a tablet, then WOW, this is heavy. If you go in expecting a laptop, then WOW, this is really light. Either way, the fully aluminum chassis is pretty breathtaking. There's an RGB-laden window on the rear of the device to give it that lighting flare we gamers crave

There's a full-length kickstand at the bottom of the device with a neat, flush tab for easy extension, and it sits on some of the most robust hinges I've ever seen. Under the kickstand is the accessible port for the M2 drive, making swapping it out a simple matter with no full disassembly required. 

https://preview.redd.it/9kjk0qnsahef1.jpg?width=8160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2aac6dba90b7fa47e48632e09a8e166c367f2d7a

Hinges and M.2 slot

I thought I would hate the included keyboard when I first saw it because it looked thin and uninspired. Then I tried it and I'm 100% sold on it. It's a chiclet style keyboard with a magnetic pogo connector and the entire thing folds up neatly over the screen. There's even RGB backlighting, which is great for use in darker environments. All I'll say about the keyboard is don't knock it until you've tried it. I found typing on it to be pretty excellent and it's just about perfect for gaming (VERY short-throw keys...).

As for I/O you have a pretty complete suite here. There's a 3.5mm combo audio jack, a full size HDMI 2.1 port, a 10gb USB 3.2 port and dual USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports which both support Displayport and power delivery (huge). There's also a microSD card reader slot and the proprietary Asus charging port they started using in 2025 for the 200W power charging. Finally, there's a dedicated button which is used to call up the Armoury Crate software or indeed anything else you'd like to configure it to do. It's a neat touch, as is the recessed power button which I did not once ever hit inadvertently.

There are dual cameras here, a 13mp rear camera and a 5mp IR front camera which indeed supports Windows Hello. I found logging in via the camera definitely a hit or miss affair, but that has little to do with the camera itself and more to do with how Microsoft implements it (I have issues with my desktop machine occasionally as well). The rear camera is interesting. I didn't think I'd ever use it until I was sitting outside one day and my dog was doing something utterly stupid. No phone in sight, so it was the Flow Z13 to the rescue. Pretty handy...

On the audio side there are 4 speakers present, and I'm VERY happy to report that Asus keeps their tradition of supporting Dolby Atmos here, complete with the full license. Sound quality from these \*small\* speakers is surprisingly good. Definitely passable for gaming and they get plenty loud, but don't expect audiophile quality here, they're just not big enough. The audio jack also supports Hi-Res audio, which is GREAT to see. I'll also mention that this laptop has a 3 microphone array with noise cancelling, and in-game it worked surprisingly well. 

There's WiFi 7 onboard, which for me is pretty neat as I happen to have a WiFi 7 setup. Speeds are...insane. Being able to download games at a 1.9Gbps clip tends to spoil you pretty quickly... *PROTIP: don't waste 45 minutes trying to figure out why you can't connect to your WiFi 7 network until/unless you've installed Windows update 24H2, which apparently enables WiFi 7 support :/*

There's a 13.4 inch 2.5K display here, which Asus insists is a Nebula display. Now, I have an Asus Nebula display on my gaming laptop (Scar 18). It's mini-led and I'm on record as saying it's every bit as good as, if not superior to, OLED and is one of the most breathtaking displays I've ever seen. The display here is...not that one. It's very nice, has a 180hz refresh rate and is a touch screen, but it's neither mini-led nor OLED. It's what they call an ""IPS-level"" display. What this means is that you will see some mild backlight bleed, you will have only a handful of dimming zones and the brightness peaks at 500 nits. To be very clear, this display is absolutely superior to every other laptop display I've tried outside of a few, but when Asus throws around the ""Nebula"" brand I admit I am spoiled and was a bit disappointed here because I know what a true ""Nebula"" display is capable of

Further, the display does indeed support Dolby Vision (and HDR in general)...**but only for video.** It's a really odd thing. Movies and streaming content display DV/HDR (depending on source) just fine, but HDR/DV is completely invisible to all games. I've researched this extensively and it's a design choice on the part of Asus, not a driver or firmware issue. 

Ok finally let's talk about the chipset and cooling. The special sauce here is the AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395. It's a ridiculous name (bad) with ridiculous performance (great). More on this in a bit.

There's a unified memory architecture here, with the memory allocated to the GPU adjustable within settings depending on your overall RAM configuration. My unit had 32GB total memory, and after playing around with dedicating 8GB and 16GB to the GPU I settled on 8GB. You can, however, buy this device with 64GB and even 128GB of unified memory and tweak the GPU allocation accordingly.

The cooling is handled by the ""usual"" suite of Asus performance hardware. Vapor chamber? Check. Thermal Grizzly liquid metal paste? Check. Amazing throughput from the cooling fans with dust filters? Also check. They have a formula for success here, and Asus have executed it to perfection once again. The exhaust fans are at the top of the display, which is a pretty great solution for this form factor as it spews the heat completely away from you and whatever surface you're perched on. If you want to have this on your lap (awkward but definitely possible) you don't have to worry about heat cooking your legs whatsoever.

**Gaming Performance**

This is the reason we're all here, and I am thrilled to report that the Flow Z13's gaming performance absolutely shocked me. At a minimum it's on par with an RTX 4060 laptop GPU. In some games it actually outperformed an RTX 4070 laptop. In Manual mode (everything maxed) at default 2560x1600 resolution with all settings maxed and FSR 3 Quality enabled (where available) I was getting minimally 60fps on all of the games I typically play and in most cases far higher. No RT, no frame gen, just pure fps glory. Halo Infinite, Black Ops 6, Forza Motorsport, The Last of Us Part I, God of War, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077. Turn on frame generation and/or switch to FSR balanced and get 100fps in games like Cyberpunk on max settings? Yes please...On and on, game after game the performance floored me. And again, I cannot stress this enough, these were all at max graphical settings and 1600p. If you're willing to compromise and lower the settings, resolution and/or switch the power profile to something like Performance or Silent, you can absolutely 100% game completely on battery here and it will be the best battery gaming experience you've ever had. For an iGPU to hit nearly 11k in Time Spy is just wild to me

[Timespy](https://preview.redd.it/a2hnnwuuahef1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=d275ea71ac3986c46a3ef4a7f5a28dc87ebccb2f)

Now these results are obviously going to vary with different games and in different environments. I personally tried to test this laptop in extreme settings (outdoors in 90 degree heat) and achieved the above consistently. The thing is, at no time did I ever experience thermal throttling in these admittedly ridiculous conditions. Fans were loud-ish, sure, but no throttling. When cooler heads prevailed (literally) and I was inside in a 67 degree air conditioned room, performance was the same level of insanity but the fans didn't need to work nearly as hard. 

[Black Ops 6](https://preview.redd.it/xtegbbqvahef1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8670c85e1ae135472841eaecd6988c930384a543)



[Trying Frame Gen](https://preview.redd.it/tum7yvf0bhef1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=4495c9ccd00209ec4377b78e081aea253a4736ad)

**Battery Life and Fan Noise**

I'm not one to game while on battery, but the portability here just screams to do just that. The newly overhauled Armoury Crate software (new and improved, seriously) is onboard of course, and you tweak the power profile here based on what you're looking for out of the device for each session. The default for battery mode for the 70wh battery is Silent, which for regular everyday use + video watching gave me between 6 and 8 hours of screen time. Again, it's the duality of this product at play. As far as a laptop goes, 6-8 hours of battery is fantastic. Compared to a tablet, 6-8 hours of battery is terrible. As far as fans go, Silent mode certainly lives up to its name as the fan noise barely went above a whisper throughout.

Testing frame gen

Gaming on battery is a different affair entirely. In silent mode (which adjusts screen brightness, power draw and fan profiles accordingly) I got about an hour and a half entirely on battery (native resolution, max settings). Cranking up to Performance mode increases the burn rate significantly (while of course increasing performance accordingly) and drops you down to about an hour, while switching to Turbo puts you at roughly 45 minutes. Just understand that when you're exclusively on battery you're obviously not going to be tapping into the full power of the iGPU so game performance is going to be throttled down accordingly.

[Forza Motorsport on battery](https://preview.redd.it/am7zfvgwahef1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bc1909183f7a509ea31b15d9bf09dabfc0b0085)



BUT, there's a solution here thanks to the two onboard USB power delivery ports. A cheap, smallish 100W power bank lets you game in Performance, Turbo and even Manual mode (with all metrics maxed out) for 2-3 hours pretty easily with no drop in gaming performance. You'll still drain the battery of course (you need the full 200W brick to actually charge while gaming), but it's a really neat minimalist option to have when you're out and about with no outlets in sight. Fan noise cranks up accordingly, however, and there were times when I was outside on a hot day gaming at max performance and the fans were pretty loud. Not deal-breakingly loud (they're small fans after all), but still definitely noticeable. You can certainly tweak this in AC, but understand that with great power comes great responsibility. And noise. 

**Downsides**

The screen and its 180hz refresh rate kept up with everything wonderfully. It's bitterly disappointing however that HDR/Dolby Vision isn't supported in games as I've grown to become something of a snob with this aspect of gaming these days. It was still a very pleasant visual experience and the ""IPS level"" display is quite good (especially for a touch screen). Nevertheless, it's just a REALLY odd choice, Asus...

Another downside and the elephant in the room with the Flow Z13 is onboard storage. It comes with an M2 slot. This is great. It's a 2230 slot. This is terrible. The only shipping option here is a 1TB drive, which I managed to completely saturate within the first 30 minutes (onboard WiFi 7 FTW!!!). The thing is, because it's the stupid 2230 form factor, you're limited to just 2TB even if you upgrade. As someone who has 2 (TWO) 8TB 2280 drives in his Scar 18, the lack of any real storage option here is criminal and will be a serious bottleneck if you're buying this for gaming. 100GB games are pretty standard, and in the case of stuff like Black Ops 6, well, it's a SERIOUS problem. Again, the WiFi 7 mitigates this somewhat, but still...

[WiFi 7 is pretty good](https://preview.redd.it/z4vowqhxahef1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=4917506eec3d20eaeaf60cfb603c624d1db68f17)

**Conclusion**

I never thought I'd see the day when an iGPU could be a viable gaming platform, yet here we are. To say I've had a blast playing games on this machine is an understatement. The portability to performance ratio is insane and I have actually taken this laptop to places I wouldn't dream of taking my Scar 18. Barbecues, coffee shops, the DMV (yeah...). To be able to play AAA games with maxed out graphics on a 2lb device is just wild to me. To be able to take that same laptop and seamlessly bring it to the library for work/school or to put it into my gym as a touchscreen for my live training programs is beyond wild, it's a paradigm shift. One thing I didn't even mention (and won't, I'm a gamer after all) is how powerful this chipset is at productivity tasks like Davinci Resolve. It beats my desktop i13700k in 4k rendering...

AMD really hit it out of the park with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chipset here, and Asus added their manufacturing superiority to create the ultimate do-everything device. It's a zero-compromise ""gaming machine+"" in the perfect form factor

One of the things I could understand potential buyers struggling with when considering the Flow Z13 is the use case. If you want a tablet you'd probably buy a dedicated tablet. If you want a gaming handheld you'd probably buy that. If you want a gaming laptop or a work laptop you'd buy those. I was like these people and I never even considered the Flow Z13 before this review. After using it as my everyday device for the past 3 weeks, however, I can't imagine anyone considering anything else. It's basically perfection as the ultimate truly portable PC gaming system that happens to be a tablet. Just, Asus, please, for the next iteration ditch the 2230. My phone has just as much storage, but I'm not running Black Ops 6 or Forza on it...",1,1753213313.0,ASUSROG,0,1.0,False

Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.She did not want someone who did not want her.So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""Brent and Cassandra were stunned.""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves—Samuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.""Which hospital?""There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth—they were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.Each box held the gift she had received at 18—one from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.""Please mail these out separately—15 days from today.""Chapter 2After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...All of it—every memory tied to them—was now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home—only to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing—yet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.""Leave the coffee and get out.""Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.Chapter 3After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window—only to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave—only for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""""How much did you hear just now?""""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""

I was prescribed Percocet from my doctor when I broke my ankle 10 years ago. I took the medication as prescribed and directed by my doctor and became addicted to opiates. I had years of my life taken from, thousands of dollars gone. Nearly died from overdosing on a legal drug my doctor prescribed me and his advice was for me to go get on another highly addictive opiate methadone for another 1-2 years. If it wasn’t for my buddy who was a recovering alcoholic suggesting me to try this plant in the coffee family called Kratom I’d be dead. I never in my life got high from Kratom. What Kratom did do is ease the brutal withdrawal symptoms from the Percocet and allowed me to get my life back. My daughter would not have a father right now if it wasn’t for kratom.

Kids are not taking kratom. The people taking kratom are those who suffer from a horrible disease and prefer a safer alternative of medication that is non addictive to ease the terrible process of withdrawals. There’s tons of statistics showing the 10,000s of people who got off of far more dangerous drugs with kratom. Why are we banning one of the only safe tools people have to get off the deadly opiates doctors are getting us hooked on. 48,000 people died last year from painkillers alone. That number is going to go up a lot if they ban kratom. ",21,1753213107.0,NorthCarolina,69,0.61,False

1m6np57,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m6np57/the_man_in_the_yellow_hat_part_two/,The Man in the Yellow Hat Part Two,"Tad walked aimlessly through the mist, half exploring, half running from whatever problems waited at home. He stopped at a long pier, then looked around in confusion. He had thought he was heading back toward home, or at least in the general direction of the lighthouse. Somehow, he had turned himself around. He could see the light in the distance, on the opposite side of the wide harbor. 

“I told you the fog can make you see things.”

Tad jumped, spinning around to see Buckner looming out of the mist. 

The old man stared up at the distant light, his odd eyes unreadable. 

“It’s awfully quiet today Mr. Keeper,” he continued, turning to slouch off down the street. “You’d think you’d hear the foghorn…”

“What?” Tad asked. He stared after the old man for a moment, then his brain snapped into gear and he swore, dashing off down the street. 

Mina barely looked up as he burst through the door and ran through to the control panel in the tower. 

“Who turned off the foghorn?” he yelled back through the open door. He swore again and flipped the switches back on. “This is pretty much the only thing that can get us in trouble.”

“It’s your job,” Mina called back. “You must have left them off this morning.”

Tad shook his head and went back through to the kitchen. “They shouldn’t ever be turned off. I didn’t do it.”

“Well, I didn’t either,” she muttered. “So don’t blame me.” The foghorn began to sound and she winced, pressing her finger tips to her temples. “It was actually kind of nice, that stupid thing gives me a headache.” 

“Why did you turn it off?” Tad asked, confused and beginning to get angry. “You told me you’re worried about me getting fired and losing this job and this house, and then you do this? It’s the only thing that…”

“I said I didn’t do it,” she snapped, standing up and making for the door. “But go ahead and keep calling me a liar. You’re the one who does this thing, you’re the one who turned it off.”

“It’s automated, I don’t have to do…”

“You did it anyway.”

She vanished out the door and Tad heard the car door slam. He groaned and sat down at the table, hanging his head on his hands. He was used to her leaving during conflict, but she usually didn’t leave the house. The only time she had, she had come back less than a minute later. This was new. 

Tad sighed. Did he accidentally shut off the switches this morning? He didn’t think so. He was tired, sure, but he didn’t think he was that tired. And why would Mina do it? She was terrified of losing the house and maintaining the light house’s basic function was essentially the only stipulation to keeping it. He couldn’t imagine her being angry enough with him to deliberately sabotage her own sense of security. 

Outside the wind picked up and he heard the rain begin to lash on the roof. Somewhere in the distance thunder rumbled moodily and the lights flickered. He sighed again. The building had a generator, emergency power to keep the light and the foghorn going. The former keeper had shown it to him and taught him the basics of running the thing, but he supposed he should go down and test it anyway. It would be just his luck to have the power go out and the generators fail. The solar powered batteries were a last resort and were theoretically viable, but with the mist, Tad wasn’t sure he wanted to rely on them. The cottage and the tower shared a basement; a space that had once been an expansive root cellar and larder carved out of the stone. 

At some point, an enterprising keeper had attempted to finish the crude space, partly fitting the place out with hardwood floors and a brick facade on the walls. Evidently, the project had been abandoned about halfway through and now the tower’s emergency generator stood in the unfinished section, surrounded by a wall of empty studs. Assorted junk filled the rest of the room, mostly parts and equipment that had been removed from the tower when the light was automated. Unlike nearly every other lighthouse in New England, the Coast Guard didn’t own this one, and while they supplied the new equipment, they could not obtain ownership of the building. That had, remarkably, remained privatized and partly managed by the town’s historical society. 

“If the Coast Guard took this place over I bet they would have at least cleaned it,” Tad grumbled, picking his way through the stacked junk. Thunder roared outside, little more than a muffled grumble through the stone and earth walls. The generator itself was new, or relatively new, and like the rest of the official equipment, was automated. The lights went out and almost before Tad could swear, the machine came on with a smooth roar. It could run the entire tower and the cottage, but the tower was the only part that was wired in. Tad had to manually switch the power for the cottage over to the generator. Thankfully, the lights by the generator and leading up the stairs to the tower came back on without a problem and he made his way across the cluttered space to the electrical cabinet. 

He reached for the door to the closet and stopped, frowning. More light, faint, but steady, was leaking out from a tiny crack between the massive cabinet and the smooth, blocked stone wall. He pressed his face to the cool stone, trying to peer behind the cabinet. The crack in the wall, maybe an inch or so past the edge of the cabinet, was radiating a pale, shimmering light. If any other lights had been on, it wouldn’t have been noticeable. It was barely noticeable now; really, Tad wasn’t sure how he’d noticed it at all. 

He scratched his chin, his marital troubles temporarily forgotten. His foot scuffed experimentally around the bottom of the cabinet, then he pressed his shoulder gently to one side, then the other. The massive thing didn’t move. 

“What the hell is back there?” he muttered to himself. “What is that light?”

Up above, the outside door slammed and he heard Mina in the kitchen. “The lights are out,” she called down the stairs. “Can you get them back on already please?”

“I’m working on it,” Tad yelled, still looking at the cabinet. “Hey, can you come down here?”

He heard her sigh and then there was the sound of her feet on the steps. 

“Here,” he said without turning around. “Look at this. There’s a light behind this cabinet. It’s a door, or, or something.” 

Mina picked her way through the basement and joined him, peering over his shoulder at the gap between the shelf and the wall. Her face creased and she shook her head.

“I don’t see anything.”

“Seriously?” Tad asked. He pressed his face to the wall and squinted, looking at the faint glimmer. “You don’t see that.”

“There’s nothing there,” she snapped, crossing her arms. “So stop being an idiot and turn on the power.” She started back toward the steps. “And did you ever test the wifi on the generator? I’d like to watch a movie if we’re stuck indoors.” 

Tad nodded and began working as she went back upstairs. He wanted to know what was behind the cabinet, but he didn’t want to know enough to risk another fight. 

“Hey,” he said softly when he finally made his way up to the living room. He watched as Mina pulled up one of her favorite shows on her laptop, settling back into the couch with her customary mug of decaf coffee. “I guess we do have internet then.”

“Yeah,” she said simply.

“What are you watching?” he asked, sitting in his own chair a few feet away.

Mina looked up, her eyes narrowed. “Since when do you care about what I’m doing?”

Tad winced at the sharp words. “What do you mean? I always care…”

“Really?” Mina demanded, her eyes flashing with anger. She stared at him over the lid of the laptop, evidently spoiling for a battle. “You don’t care about me at all. If you did, you’d listen to me.”

“What do you mean?” 

“You’re kidding right?” Mina snapped, setting the laptop aside. “I lost everything because of you. Twice! And now you’re still not listening to me or doing what I ask.”

Tad’s face went blank and still, his mind reeling from the sudden assault. He knew that Mina’s mother had tried to steal her life’s savings not long after they started dating, but she’d got it all back less than a year later. 

“It’s not my fault that the Conference Center laid us off,” he began carefully. 

“Sure it was,” Mina growled. “You should have just sucked stuff up and not said anything.” Her lips twisted in an angry impression. “‘Oh, I’m so depressed, I can’t come in today…’ Just be a man and admit you were being lazy.”

Tad flinched. “Hey, take it easy…”

“And if you don’t stop being such a know it all and start listening to me, we’re going to lose this place too.” Her eyes were blazing and her fists were clenched. “We shouldn’t have moved here, we should have just stayed back home and finished paying off the house.”

“We have more money in the account than we’ve ever had before,” Tad protested, his own voice rising with the heat of the moment. “And you always wanted to move up here…”

“Yeah, but we won’t have money if you keep spending it like an idiot,” she said, crossing her arms. 

“Why are you so angry?” Tad asked helplessly.

“I’m not angry,” she said, turning away. “And don’t you dare start gas lighting me again.”

Tad tensed even more, his brain and heart spinning and whirling inside him. “I’m not gas lighting you.”

“You tell me what I’m supposed to feel and what I’m not supposed to feel,” she yelled, standing up. “And you make me question my feelings. That’s gaslighting. We should go to Mr. Buckner’s church and ask him, I bet he’d agree with me.”

Tad swallowed, struggling to push the pain and anger away. “If that’s what he thinks gaslighting is, he’s not a good pastor… we should find someone who can be neutral…”

“I’m not letting you choose anyone,” Mina snapped, stomping away. “No way. You don’t get to choose someone you can just get on your side. If you don’t want to do it my way, then screw you.”

Tad stayed on his chair, frozen. Minutes trailed on and on, and finally he gasped and hung his head in his hands.

He was still there the next morning, haggard and exhausted. His eyes were red and there were marks of old tears on his cheeks. There was a sound at the door and he turned to find Mina staring at him from the door. She was dressed in her favorite jeans and a comfortable sweatshirt and she had her purse over her shoulder. 

“Why didn’t you come up to bed?” she asked flatly. 

“I didn’t think you wanted me around,” he said softly, not quite looking into her eyes. 

She rolled her eyes and went to the door. “I’m going to the ferry. Mr. Buckner is having a special service for newcomers today.”

“Do you want me to come along?”

“No,” she said shortly. “If you make me wait, I’ll miss the ferry. See you later.”

Tad blundered to his feet as she walked out the door. He swore under his breath and staggered into a fresh pair of pants, running into the laundry room to search for a clean shirt. Giving up, he grabbed his favorite t-shirt and stuffed his feet into his shoes. He dashed out the door, and almost ran headlong into a tallish man dressed in the blue uniform of the Coast Guard. 

“Oh hey!” the man said, catching Tad and steadying him. “You must be the new Keeper. Pretty intense storm last night, eh?”

“Uh, yeah,” Tad said, peering over his shoulder. Mina was already gone. “Yeah, it was a big one. Um, what can I help you with?”

“Just here to check the equipment,” said the Guardsman, flashing his military ID. “I was in town, so I figured I should make sure everything is working alright. I’ll just check in the tower and the basement, and then I’ll be out of your hair.” 

“Sure,” Tad said, edging past. “Sorry, I’m in a hurry and the door is open, so just head in.”

He hurried down the road without a second glance. By the time he reached the harbor, the ferry was already vanishing out into the morning mist just outside the harbor. He swore and kicked at a stone on the wharf. 

“Missed the boat?” called a cheerful lobsterman as he moseyed down the ramp just down the way. “One of old Buckner’s huh?” He shook his head. “I won’t say I understand you folks, but if you really want to get out there, I’ll drop you off on the way.”

Tad nodded and hurried over and down the ramp next to the man. He was burly, with a heavy black beard streaked with gray. 

“So, you listen to the old man?” asked the lobsterman as he showed Tad to a cluttered seat in the small boat’s cabin. “Or did he get his sticky fingers in someone else?”

“Someone else,” Tad said tightly, irritated at the man’s jocular manner.

“I wouldn’t worry too much,” the lobsterman said as he eased his boat away from the dock and into the gentle swell. “My little brother went out there for a few months, then got tired of it. I guess it didn’t really have that much staying power.” 

Tad only grunted a noncommittal response and the lobsterman shrugged. 

Mist surrounded them as they exited out of the shelter of the harbor. Vaguely, Tad noticed the steady flash of his lighthouse and the intermittent blare of the foghorn. As the minutes passed he felt a strange chill filling the air. He noticed the lobsterman’s mood change as well; the man began glancing around in some concern, leaning to look up in the direction of the bluffs and the lighthouse. The waves were growing worse and with sudden shock, Tad realized what had changed. The sound of the foghorn had ceased. He jumped up and looked toward the light, his hands gripping the sides of the door to the open deck. 

The light was out.

“I’d sit down mister,” the lobsterman said. “It’s getting rough out…”

Before he could finish the sentence the world lurched, the water rising and hurling the boat around like a leaf. Tad’s head hit something hard and the world went black. For a moment there was nothing but wet darkness, then his head broke the surface and he began to flounder. The lobster boat was nowhere to be seen and he flailed wildly, trying to orient himself as the world churned around him. A shadow moved in the surf and he saw the boat, now on its side, looming over him. He raised his hands in helpless defense, or maybe defiance, as the boat crashed down on him. 

The next thing he knew he was scrabbling through sand and pebbles, coughing and spitting up salt water. His head ached and his arms and legs felt heavy and numb, but he crawled up the beach, desperate to get out of reach of the roiling waves. The morning had gone dark and bitterly cold and he rolled over to see an immense shadow filling the sky, blocking out all sunlight and drowning the world in darkness. There was no shape to the darkness, and the cold was more than physical and he could feel a pressure on his mind, the urge to scream and cry and hide. 

It was a memory that kept him moving, the bizarre and inexplicable memory of the light behind the electrical cabinet. It filled his mind, a lure that blurred out the rest of the world, at least other than the imminent danger of the waves that beat the shore just below him. He was higher on the beach than he expected, above the typical high water mark and he still had to scramble as the waves reached hungry fingers towards him. 

The lighthouse was on the bluff overhead and he scrambled up, moving more on instinct than will as he clambered unsteadily up the steps. The shadow overhead grew darker as the air grew ever colder. Down below the waves roared, steadily growing until they slammed on the cliff side itself, tearing away the steps that Tad had just left. Fear lent strength to his deadened limbs and he scrambled over the top of the cliff, half crawling, half stumbling through the open door into the lighthouse tower. 

Instinct took him downstairs and he stopped, swaying and clutching his head. Whispers and half heard, ghostly cries filled the air. The sounds made his head ache and throb and his vision blur, but he focused on the wall where the shelf stood. He was halfway through the mess of junk before he realized that the heavy shelf had been tipped over. Light streamed through a narrow gap in the rough wall and he staggered toward it, feeling like a drowning man swimming toward the surface. The faint glimmer of light seemed to resist the encroaching shadows and whispers and Tad caught his breath, his head clearing enough for him to scramble through the gap. He half stepped, half fell through a rough opening, landing heavily on his hands and knees. He shook his head to clear the fog and struggled back to his feet, nearly falling again when he saw the prone body of the Coast Guardsman on the floor between him and a stone plinth. 

The man looked as if he had aged forty years in a moment, his face gray and deathly thin, with burning eyes staring out from the withered features. His hand was flung out toward the plinth; just beyond his fingers lay a strange orb that seemed to shudder and flicker in Tad’s vision.

“Did you see it?” the man croaked, his voice a broken whisper. “Did you see him? The Yellow King in his forgotten city?”

Tad shuddered, and stepped over him, reaching for the orb. His body was moving of its own accord, stopping only when the Guardsman’s bony hands grabbed at his pants leg. 

“Is it beautiful?” the ancient man asked, his eyes turning glassy and pale. “Is it… is it… be… be…”

His hand fell away and Tad snatched up the orb. The moment his hands touched the surface, he felt an electric thrill, and suddenly he was outside of his body, hovering by the ceiling staring down at himself. His body was ridged; his wide eyes locked on the roiling orb as the light became a brilliant white. The light grew and grew until he was lost in its glory, the world dissolving into nothingness around him. 

Slowly, shapes began to form around him, doorways made of darker strands of light. Through one he saw the plinth and the orb restored, through another he saw Mina. She was beside him on a beach; they were on their knees with dozens of others, bowing to an immense shadow that hovered over the ocean. The lighthouse was gone, little more than rubble, and strange shapes moved in the depths of the water and in the darkly gathering clouds. 

His heart jumped seeing Mina next to him, holding his hand and pressing close to his side, but the rest of the scene filled him with horror and he recoiled, ducking instead through the other door. 

When he eventually came back to himself he was sitting on the steps leading to the cottage, still in his soaked and torn clothes. A medic was poking at him, trying to check his vitals.

“Hey!” the man said, moving a pen light back and forth across Tad’s line of vision. “Are you okay? Do you remember who you are, what happened?”

“Wh… what?” Tad asked, suddenly starting to shiver. “My name’s Tad…” 

“Was there anyone else in the house with you?”

Tad’s mind was blank for a moment before it came sluggishly to life. “M… Mina, my wife… and there was a Coast Guard guy checking the equipment…”

“Check the house again!” the medic yelled. He returned to his examination. “You just survived the worst rogue storm we’ve seen in centuries… waves broke all the way up here… you’re lucky you weren’t swept away.” 

“House and tower are clear,” a voice called from somewhere behind him. “No one else here.”

Tad turned numbly to look up at the lighthouse. The shadow in the sky was gone and the sun was breaking through the tattered clouds. 

“Are you sure anyone else was here?” the medic asked again, moving to face Tad. “Your wife, where was she?”

“She went to church,” Tad said slowly. “A church on one of the little islands out in the bay.”

The medic exchanged glances with one of the other first responders. “And what was her name?”

“Mina…” Tad said automatically. “Mina Bell.”

The medic nodded and the other responder stepped quickly away, talking into a radio.

“The worst of this hit the town,” the medic said, taking a heavy blanket and wrapping it around his shoulder. “And responders found a ferry that got beached down the coast aways. Sounds like your wife was probably with them. Where was that Guardsman, do you remember?”

“Basement,” Tad replied softly, still shivering in spite of the emergency blanket. “He was in the little room through the door.”

The medic called someone over and talked in hushed tones. He turned back to Tad and began to gently examine his head. “There’s no one in the basement, and there’s just one room. Huh… looks like you might have hit your head.”

“I’ll take it from here,” said a new voice. Tad looked up to see a short man in a black suit that hung neatly over his rotund form. Eyes so blue that they were almost white glittered from under his heavy brows and he waved the medic away, helping Tad to his feet.

“Mr. Dunkirk,” Tad stammered. “Wh… what are you doing here?”

“Helping my lighthouse keeper,” Dunkirk said, helping him up the steps. He turned back and made a shooing gesture at the medic and the other responders. “Alright, go take care of people who actually need it. I assure you, Mr. Bell will be fine under my care. Please, go find Mrs. Bell and make sure she is all right.”

“What’s going on?” Tad asked as Dunkirk led him into the kitchen and sat him down at the table. “Everything’s all fuzzy…”

Dunkirk clucked under his breath. “Fuzzy? Fuzzy my eye, you’re lucky to be alive.” He shook his head sadly. “I’m sorry this happened my boy, very sorry. I’d hoped you’d at least have a few years before the secrets started leaking out.”

“Wh… what are you talking about?”

“The man in the yellow hat,” Dunkirk said, his jowly face darkening. “He crops up every now and again and disaster’s always lurking somewhere in his wake.” The man shuddered. “And he got close this time too… might have gotten through if it wasn’t for you Tad.”

“Old Mr. Buckner?” Tad croaked, confused. “What does he have to do with this?”

“Mr. Buckner this time?” Dunkirk shook his head. “Damn… how the hell did he get himself in this? No matter…” He put a heavy hand on Tad’s shoulder. “I wish it didn’t have to be this way my boy, but you’ve been dropped in the deep end now.” His strange eyes bored into Tad. “It’s time you learned what being a Keeper is really all about.” 

 

Epilogue

 

Thaddeus Bell sat on the porch of the lighthouse, watching a ferry come into the harbor. The cottage had changed over the years, expanding and becoming a rambling library of sorts, but the tower was the same, shining its light over the gulf. Thaddeus could no longer be called a young man, but neither could he be called old, though the first strands of gray were creeping into his thick beard and mop of shaggy curls. There was a sound of footsteps on the path down to the harbor and he turned to see a woman in a long yellow dress and a wide yellow hat. Her eyes were odd, looking almost gold and they flashed as she smiled.

“Hello Tad,” she said. “It’s been so long… aren’t you going to give your Mina a hug?”

Thaddeus stood up abruptly, his eyes narrowing. “You aren’t Mina…”

“Sure I am,” she said, grinning as she looked up at the towering light. “Just because I follow the yellow sign, doesn’t mean I’m not me.”

“You stole Mina from me a long time ago,” Thaddeus growled, reaching under his jacket. “Your last avatar saw to that.”

“The great and wise Thaddeus Bell,” she said, smirking slightly. “Avatar is hardly the word. Harbinger… prophet, maybe.” She cocked her head to the side and began to sidestep, carefully pacing the edge of the property. “You could join me, you know. Wouldn’t you like that Tad? To be together again?”

Her eyes burned a ferocious gold and she extended her hand. “Accept a fragment of power, a sliver of the sign…” she tapped her chest, just over her heart. “A sliver. Right. Here.” Her hand extended again, beckoning, inviting. “Together again until the stars align… then we can usher in that forgotten realm.” 

Thaddeus stood up and turned away, walking back into the lighthouse. “Sorry Mina. I didn’t know enough back then. I should have saved you.”

Mina’s face hardened. “I don’t need saving.” The sky began to darken and there was a distant sound of thunder. “I don’t need anything from you.”

“I’m not talking to you,” Thaddeus said softly. “So you’re welcome to leave.”

Golden eyes flickered and a wicked smile returned for a moment, before she started to walk away. “Oh, I don’t think so. We always wanted to live here didn’t we? I think I’ll stick around for a while.”

Using the Nespresso ENV92BCA Vertuo Pop+ Coffee Maker and Espresso Machine has genuinely been a treat for my mornings. Its compact size, boasting dimensions of 14""D x 8.6""W x 10.4""H, fits perfectly into limited counter space. As someone living in a small apartment, every inch of kitchen counter real estate counts, and this coffee maker effortlessly nestles into its spot. The licorice black glossy exterior adds a modern touch to my kitchen and aligns well with contemporary decor schemes. Its stylish design isn’t just about looks—it makes the machine feel robust and high-quality. Whether it's setting up for a quick espresso shot at breakfast or flexing my limited kitchen counter space to friends, it’s nice to own something that stands out for its aesthetic appeal.  

**Easy One-Touch Brewing Experience**

The one-touch brewing button is an absolute godsend for those chaotic mornings when I’m rushing through my day. I find myself half-awake and fumbling for caffeine, so the simplicity of pressing a button and waiting for the magic to happen is invaluable. The fully automatic operation ensures a hassle-free experience—no painstaking steps involved. Of course, fancy settings are fun for enthusiasts, but honestly, who has time for manual operations in the hustle and bustle of modern life? That said, the convenience is undeniably a strong selling point that resonates with someone like me.

[Check Nespresso ENV92BCA price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0c3p9p7b3/)  

**Wide Range of Coffee Sizes for a Customizable Experience**

The versatility of being able to brew six different coffee sizes is one feature I've grown to love. This machine seamlessly adapts from crafting a robust espresso shot to a long, soothing Alto or even a Cold Brew-style coffee. Sometimes, I’m craving that quick double espresso kick to power through my workload, and other times, I want to unwind with a full Gran Lungo-sized coffee while binge-watching my favorite streaming shows. It’s like having a barista catering to my whims—except it's hassle-free, quick, and customized to my preference. Even visitors with different coffee preferences (yes, my friends are very picky) have been thoroughly impressed by its versatility.  

**Merits**

- Stylish and space-saving, perfect for small kitchens.  
- One-touch brewing makes coffee preparation effortless.  
- Versatility with six coffee size options.  

**Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Connectivity: Over-engineering or Genuinely Useful?**

This coffee maker comes equipped with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities, which frankly, I was skeptical about at first. Still, it promises automatic software updates for optimal performance, and that sounded neat. Once I set it up, I realized that staying connected means my machine always brews at its peak potential. While I might not be a tech wizard, knowing my coffee maker is 'smart' enough to update itself is oddly satisfying. However, I’d be lying if I said I used this feature daily—it feels like one of those “nice-to-have but not life-altering” additions.  

**Critiques**

- Bluetooth and Wi-Fi features can feel unnecessary for non-techie users.  
- Limited to capsule-based coffee, which restricts options for those who love experimenting with fresh ground coffee.  

**Performance and Taste That's Difficult to Beat**

A good coffee maker isn’t only about the machine itself—it’s about the final cup it delivers. The Vertuo range ensures every coffee produced boasts exceptional quality. I’ve yet to brew a drink that didn’t come out rich, flavorful, and satisfying. What's particularly delightful is the selection of premium and flavored capsules compatible with the machine. Whether it's nutty undertones or a sweeter caramel finish I’m craving, there’s always a capsule that hits the spot. Yet, relying exclusively on Nespresso’s capsules can seem limiting, and it’s worth noting that these are an added ongoing cost.

**Challengers**

I’ve also tried Keurig coffee makers, and while they perform decently, they don’t hold a candle to the quality and pressure this espresso machine provides. Another competitor, the Breville Bambino Plus, offers versatility with fresh grounds, which is ideal for a purist. However, it comes with a steeper learning curve and larger footprint. The Vertuo Pop+ certainly shines in its compact design and ease of use—key areas where some competitors falter.  

**Price to Quality Ratio**

There’s no denying that this coffee maker provides high-end features, but is it worth its cost? Based on my experience, you’re definitely paying for the convenience, the premium design, and the advanced brewing technology. However, the long-term investment lies in the ongoing capsule purchases—that’s something to consider for budget-conscious users. If you’re the type who values simplicity and exceptional coffee quality without diving into the nitty-gritty complexities of brewing, this investment is undoubtedly worthwhile.

Hands down, our most beloved and requested plushies are the Anxiety Rabbits. This seems to be such a universal occurrence right now that it seems appropriate to dig in a little more to help us all understand anxiety better and find ways to manage it.

First, anxiety has [three main components](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/do-i-have-anxiety-or-worry-whats-the-difference-2018072314303): emotional, physiological, and cognitive. 

The emotional part is what we commonly refer to as *worry*. This is the feeling of dread, concern, or impending doom that something terrible is about to happen. The physical part can manifest as heart palpitations, a twisting tightening of the stomach, or sweating. The cognitive element is the part that can get us in the most trouble - but it’s also the key to learning how to manage our anxiety. This is when we catastrophize, when the emotional feeling gets tacked onto a fully-formed thought or imagined outcome. 

*Everybody* experiences anxiety at some point in their lives, but when it goes from a periodic episode to something that dominates our daily thoughts, [it’s classified then as a disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/anxiety-disorders). 

>As an aside, let us define ***disorder***: a disorder is any condition - mental, emotional, or physical - that interrupts daily living, causes ongoing distress, or creates sustained inconvenience or impairment. It’s not a [disease](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1414656/) necessarily as that is specifically a defined medical condition with a clear cause, like [rheumatoid arthritis](https://plushiedreadfuls.com/products/plushie-dreadfuls-rheumatoid-arthritis-rabbit-plush-stuffed-animal). And a syndrome is a collection of symptoms that occur under the umbrella of a particular diagnosis, but each symptom is often treated separately from each other.

Just to make things a little spicier, there are a few different types of anxiety disorders. An ongoing sense of foreboding and constant heightened state of vigilance and anticipation is a major feature of ***generalized anxiety disorder***, but when that constant state frequently escalates into episodes of extreme distress, that’s a [***panic disorder***](https://plushiedreadfuls.com/products/plushie-dreadfuls-panic-disorder-plush-stuffed-animal). When you’re (mostly) fine at home but start getting freaked out when you have to be around other people, that’s ***social anxiety disorder*** (also known as sociophobia). Then there are all kinds of ***phobias*** attached to specific things like [heights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophobia), [spiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnophobia), [holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypophobia), or the fear that somehow, somewhere, there is a duck watching you. (Okay, this last one, *anatidaephobia*, is actually totally fictional, but you get the idea.)

It’s almost impossible for most of us to imagine a life without anxiety, particularly since the world seems to be giving us so many [very good reasons to worry](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-environ-012220-022716). Women and those in the more emotional-labor-intense roles tend to [experience more anxiety](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00368504221135469) than men and those with less emotional labor, but the former group tend to *internalize* anxiety into depression and reactive disorders while the latter group will more likely *externalize* it into things like substance abuse and escapism. 

# Can We Make It Stop?

And yet, we don’t ever actually *want* to be completely free of anxiety because it evolved as [a critical survival skill](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3181631/). Our squishy human brains have a triune of mechanisms with which to detect danger - rational, emotional, and instinctive - and anxiety (remember, all *three* parts of it) is the reaction to that triune activating. That whole system developed to protect us from saber-toothed tigers and really bad weather; it’s a royal [pain in the buns](https://plushiedreadfuls.com/collections/anxiety-rabbit-collection) when it activates in response to answering emails or having to make a doctor’s appointment.

But, if we over-rationalize and consciously *ignore* our anxieties, then *real* threats are able to get through our defenses and we get hurt. People who’ve been through intense trauma have their “anxiety threat threshold” neurologically skewed, so they may either be in a constant state of anxiety or else hardly experience any at all. If we don’t [have a little guidance](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/psychotherapies) to figure out what is and isn’t a serious threat, we can easily end up developing self-destructive habits or else avoiding the world altogether. There are dozens of methods of therapy that can help us work through it, though cognitive behavior therapy (also known in non-psychotherapy circles as [*mindfulness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness)) is the go-to because it has a lot of [excellent research](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-updates/2024/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-alters-brain-activity-in-children-with-anxiety) demonstrating its effectiveness.

# All By Your Onesies

There are some things you can do for yourself in the meantime. (If this sounds familiar, it’s because we’ve said it before.) First, don’t ever let yourself get caught up in the idea that you’re *just* overthinking or catastrophizing: Think of it more as ***pre-solving problems*** by imagining them ahead of time. Of course, it helps to keep all those ideas in a [journal](https://plushiedreadfuls.com/products/plushie-dreadfuls-journal-notebooks?sl=rddtanxpost) because writing it down is *science*, which means *not* writing it down is just horsing around. You don’t even have to make a whole big thing about it, just [jotting down](https://plushiedreadfuls.com/products/plushie-dreadfuls-character-pens?sl=rddtanxpost) a [note or two](https://plushiedreadfuls.com/products/plushie-dreadfuls-restless-sticky-note-2-pack?sl=rddtanxpost) will do.

Second, recognize that states of anxiety are taking us out of the Now; we’re worried about the future, or we’re obsessing over the past, and that means that the present doesn’t get our full attention. So, find something that grounds you in the *Right Now*. This is the idea behind “touching grass”, by the way, and while that’s not a terrible idea, it’s not always possible. 

Activate your five main senses: 

* **Sniff** something pleasant (coffee, candles, tea), 
* **Look** at something you love, 
* **Touch** and pet and squeeze your Plushie Friend, 
* **Listen** to music that doesn’t require emotional investment (lo-fi is good or any other chill-out stream), 
* and Eat *something nutritious* because vitamin deficiencies can certainly make anxiety issues worse. 

(If you’re really spinning out, though, and can’t eat, you can sprinkle *a very little, we mean just a few grains* of salt on your tongue.)

Third, *you gotta talk to someone about this*. Ideally, it should be some kind of brain-meat specialist, but a close and wise friend will do in a pinch, and you can totally use both. The reason to talk to someone, though, is to create a *web of accountability* for your anxiety. When you’re not sure if something is a problem, check in with the people around you: is the vibe off and you’re missing it? Or is the vibe cool and you’re over-analyzing things? Use your community to help you recalibrate your ancient evolutionary survival mechanisms into something that works for the forces of good instead of evil.



The hardest part of being alive right now is that it’s impossible to tell anyone that they have nothing to worry about, and, yes, that used to be the go-to rationalization inside therapist offices. Now, we don’t do ourselves any favors by ignoring the loud-and-clear signals we’re getting from the world, but we do need to make sure that we are the ones making the decisions about how to handle those perceived threats. Anxiety can be a phenomenal early-warning system, but it’s a ***terrible driver***.

\---------------------------------------------

*This is part of an initiative to provide a little more evidence-based, research-backed context and help to our community (with a heavy dose of common sense and compassion thrown in). There is no method that's going to work for everyone all the time, so take what works for you and leave the rest. Be kind to others, and let us know what you think in the comments.*

*And, yes, there are a lot of links both to research and to really cool Plushie Dreadfuls sprinkled throughout.*",1,1753212396.0,plushiedreadfuls,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Twins vs. Dodgers: A Tale of Two Batting Averages (and Why the Dodgers Should Win, Unless They Trip Over Their Own Shoelaces)**

The Minnesota Twins (48-52) and Los Angeles Dodgers (59-42) are set for Game 2 of their series, a clash that’s as lopsided as a hot dog in a bun. Let’s break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet-obsessed intern and the humor of a stand-up comedian who’s only had two cups of coffee.

**Odds & Implied Probabilities: The Math Doesn’t Lie (Unless It Does)**  
The Dodgers are favored at **-150** (implied probability: **60%**), while the Twins sit at **+250** (**40%**). For context, the Twins’ 40.6% win rate as underdogs this season is about as reliable as a weather forecast in the Sahara. Meanwhile, the Dodgers’ 60.5% success when favored? That’s the confidence of a guy who just won the lottery and still checks his ticket twice.

The run line (-1.5 for the Dodgers) and total (8.5 runs) suggest this game could hinge on whether the Twins’ offense remembers how to hit. They’ve scored 419 runs this season—20th in MLB—which is like being the last person to get a WiFi signal at a concert. The Dodgers, meanwhile, average 5.3 runs per game, led by Shohei Ohtani’s 34 home runs and 65 RBIs. His bat is so hot, it’s considered a fire hazard in some states.

**Injuries & News: The Human Drama Behind the Stats**  
The Twins’ starting pitcher, Simeon Woods Richardson, is a rookie with a 4.75 ERA, which is about as comforting as a life jacket made of Jell-O. He’ll face Yoshinobu Yamamoto, the Dodgers’ “cyborg” (as fans call him) with a 2.89 ERA. Yamamoto’s so good, he’s been accused of secretly pitching for both teams just to flex.

On the offensive side, the Twins’ Byron Buxton (22 HRs) and Trevor Larna

I had 2 root canal and the dentist was super grumpy and rather rough (not that it's all on him or anything, id been drinking a lot of soda and coffee so i contributed but still). I thought hey hes kind of a dick but I assume he knows what hes doing? Year later, tooth next to one with a root canal cracks and the root canal on the opposite side has the crown placed improperly. I also have to do a wisdom tooth extraction so I prioritize that because it hurts and I want to wait for 2ish months to heal. Well, my molar completely cracks and half of it falls off.

first dentist I go to just refers me out after a cleaning. Second one I go to (did the extraction) gives me a plan -- but I asked around and they did some prp thing that doesn't necessary? I thought it was weird because my first wisdom teeth extractions w/ another a few years ago didnt need it, the prp thing was like 80% of the bill at $400 with insurance. 

went back to first dentist after molar broke (only one available immediately) they filled it in with some temp stuff...which literally fell off like 30 after I left the parking lot. 

went to a third dentist, they gave me a treatment plan with really good prices (it was in tijuana)...but they literally did NOTHING about my broken tooth that day. Like nothing. Its still broken, its been a week since the first visit.

how do I find a good dentist? What questions do I ask to make sure im not paying for random stuff and they actually give a shit? Im tired of going from dentist to dentist and i dont want this molar to get infected. Thanks in advance!",1,1753212320.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

It was only a month after I retired that my wife and I had separated from our twenty-three years of marriage, and my now ex-wife, Monica, would tell anybody else that the fault was mine. After retiring at the top of the detective class, a title I held true for fifteen years, we tried to start a family. Unfortunately, after not having any luck, Monica went to see a doctor and found out about her infertility. The following week, I came home after grocery shopping in the morning, and she was gone. All that had been left behind was a note in which she called me selfish and blamed me for the failure of our marriage. The divorce papers were served the following Friday afternoon. I was watching TV when the doorbell rang; I clicked the TV off and answered the door to a young kid who smelled of weed and cheeseburgers.

""Here ya go, sir, you have been served.""

Besides my life coming down harder than the Roman Empire, I would say it's been simple.

July 23, 2032

Today, I woke up in a better mood and took my dog, Ranger, out for a walk. Ranger was a dog I had given Monica as an anniversary present; Ranger was more of a gift for me since Monica had something against dogs. When Ranger and I walked home, the mail courier left my porch.

""Good afternoon, sir; it's good that you showed up so I can deliver your package. Stay safe and have a good day.""

He handed the package to me, and in a split second, his eyes caught mine, and I noticed an eerie, wide smile across his face. Although before I was able to say anything else, he walked up to his mail truck and drove away. Once inside, I set the package on the coffee table and made dinner. Monica cooked a lot of the time, but I was no stranger to the stove. After I ate, I sat on the couch with a cold beer and watched the news. 

8:46 pm

It did not take long for the package to catch my attention again; the box was unorthodox, and it seemed to be wrapped almost as if it were a gift. The cardboard box was wrapped in brown paper and tied closed with butcher's twine. The post label only had my name and mailing address, but no return address. I decided to open it because, in my eyes, I had nothing else to lose. I got up, grabbed scissors from the kitchen drawer, and snipped it open. A small, square box, its white surface reflecting the light above me, contained a cassette tape with a note inside. The tape was labeled with a permanent red marker,

""Bygones.""

The sight of the tape left me wondering what all this could mean. I could not help but feel like a thousand eyes were staring at me from the inside. Then I remembered the Walkman Monica left behind; she said it was half-broken but still played tapes decently. I had practically torn the house up looking for it, but I popped it in and started the tape once I found it.

""Hello Jonathan, long time no talk, I wouldn't expect you to know me by my voice, but I just wanted to make contact. Ten years ago, you ran into your first wall as a detective with my case, the bombing of the metro train station. Twelve people: five adults, three kids, and four elderly. All died in vain because you couldn't do your job right, and the press wrote me off as dead just because you couldn't figure out who I was. So because of all this, their blood stains your hands to this very day. If you want to make things right, meet me at the address on the back of the note, and there you shall be executed for your crimes against the ones you swore to protect.""

I took off the headphones and walked to the kitchen, staggering for balance, my heart thumping against my chest, it echoed in my silence. I picked up a new beer bottle, opened it, and chugged it to finish. The only mistake in my career has come back to haunt me, and my world is crumbling. The retirement that bores me, my wife leaving me because I'm unable to satisfy her, and now the one who got away wants to see me meet my end. Although I do not think they were counting on me having nothing to lose, and with this, I will make my own end. The note was in the white box; it had been a sticky note with a location and time:

""WEST SHIPYARD 8 O'CLOCK; COME ALONE.""

The bottom script provided me with a date for the meeting, and I prepared accordingly.

End.1

July 26, 2032,

6:45 p.m. I pulled into the shipyard, entered through the front gate, and passed the abandoned guard post; it looked like someone had bashed it in, decorated the walls with holes, and the shattered glass was crushed under my car's tires. It was a desolate and muggy night; the shipyard was about fifteen minutes away from the center of the city and five minutes from the interstate highway, so I put two and two together; if their motive were to see me die, then they would be able to have a head start on their getaway.

I pulled in between two metal bunkers by the edge of the port; in front of me, there was nothing but lone forklifts and street lamps beaming through low-bearing clouds, and oddly enough, the height of the street lamps seemed as if I expected Jack to crawl down the beanstalk. The air was quiet; it was dead, and the waves were hitting the embankment so hard it sounded like a heavyweight match and was too close for a knockout. Even though I didn't see anyone or anything for miles on my way, there was still something off, which made my best instinct to protect myself, so I reached into my glove box and placed the .38 snub-nosed revolver on my lap. I parked the car a few feet away from the meeting point; only time would tell if I could face the eyes of the one who made a mockery of my livelihood. 

7:20 p.m. Just about starting to regret getting here so early. Mother Nature's sunset danced with purple and yellow hues, but as time passed, the sky turned into a dark, starless void, almost as if she had slept again for the day. Then I craved a cigarette. So, I lowered the car window on my driver's and passenger's side, lit one, and took a drag.

7:42 p.m. The water had taken a standstill, and the salty air naturally paired with its black, hole-like appearance. All the while, I kept staring at my watch. Thus, the universe held me true to indefinite patience. My lit cigarette illuminated my driver's side in the now-dark evening, and a thick fog hovered over the ocean surface. Meanwhile, a ship had arrived during my wait, and the streetlights shone on its front; ""INSIGNIA"" was the boat's name. After another fifteen minutes, the expected company will arrive. 

8:05 pm - I might be the only punctual person left since the expected company had not shown, granted it had only been a few minutes past the due time. I chose to sit and wait a little longer, tuning the radio. But the only frequency to pick up was the jazz station; I started to look around and noticed something moving by the front gate; my hand clenched my revolver. I had seen shadows and bushes shift; a fox roamed around the front entrance, then walked into the shipyard. My eyes followed it by a few bunkers where supplies and crates were once stored. The fox had lost sight and had taken residence in a storage shed.

## Key Features Analysis

The modern beverage cart boasts a range of features designed to improve functionality and aesthetics. Understanding these features can help you make an informed decision and choose the perfect cart for your specific needs.

**Durable Construction:** Moast beverage carts are constructed from a combination of materials, including metal frames (steel or aluminum), wooden shelves, and tempered glass surfaces. Look for sturdy construction that can withstand regular use and the weight of bottles and glassware.

The quality of the materials directly impacts the lifespan and stability of the cart. Steel frames provide excellent durability, while wood adds a touch of elegance. Consider the type of finish used on the metal and wood, as this can affect its resistance to scratches and moisture. Tempered glass is a safer option than standard glass, as it shatters into smaller, less risky pieces.

**Mobility and Maneuverability:** A good beverage cart should be easy to move around, even when fully loaded.The wheels are a critical component, and their size, material, and locking mechanism play a significant role in maneuverability.

Larger wheels generally provide better stability and ease of movement, especially on uneven surfaces. Rubber wheels are a good choice because they are non-marking and provide a smoother ride compared to plastic wheels. Locking casters are essential for keeping the cart securely in place when it's not being moved.

**Storage Capacity and Configuration:** The storage capacity and configuration of a beverage cart determine how much it can hold and how efficiently you can organize your items. Features to consider include the number of shelves, bottle racks, glass holders, and drawers.Shelf options range from solid shelves to slatted or wire shelves. Solid shelves provide a stable surface for bottles and glassware, while slatted or wire shelves allow for airflow and can prevent spills from pooling. bottle racks can hold bottles securely, preventing them from tipping over during movement. Glass holders are a convenient way to store stemware, while drawers can be used to store smaller items like bar tools and napkins.

**Style and Aesthetics:** Beverage carts are available in a wide range of styles, from sleek and modern to rustic and customary. The design of the cart should complement your existing decor and reflect your personal style.

Consider the color, shape, and materials when choosing a beverage cart. Metal and glass carts often have a modern look, while wooden carts can create a more traditional or rustic feel. The addition of decorative elements, such as mirrored surfaces or ornate handles, can further enhance the cart's aesthetic appeal.

So as long as I can remember my dad was never emotionally involved with me and my 3 sisters, all 4 of us lived with my mom and would see our dad on weekends and sometimes we would see him after he was done work for a quick visit. He remarried and basically replaced us with his ""new family"" and that really solidified the whole emotionally involved part, when any big event happened in our life the chances of him making any effort was 50/50. either he cares or he couldn't give a rats ass you get the point. He was also very self centered and would turn a convo about himself. 

My relationship with my dad grew smaller and smaller as I grew up and realized who he truly was, our relationship was very cordial and civil until last year Sept. I was getting married and we invited everybody, we spent a lot of time planning  and getting things ready. The wedding day comes around and my dad is late, I'm supposed to walk down the isle in 10 and I call him and he says ""Sorry I just finished getting my hair cut and I'm on my way to Tim's to grab a coffee"" I told him to hurry and hung up. Honestly idk why I even bothered having him walk me down the isle. Anyways he actually shows up just in time and is literally wearing sweats and a shirt with a golf hat and his old people shoes while everybody was dressed up. In that moment my relationship with him was done, like I was just done hoping he would do better. I need to mention by this time my 1st daughter is 6 months and we used to come over and visit him and my siblings all the time, he seen her twice a week. 

After the wedding I stopped reaching out and being the first one to make conversation, surprise surprise he never once messaged me or reached out. Ngl I was really hurt and sad that he truly never cared about us. The next time he seen my daughter was Christmas time, even then we went over to his house and he had us open her gifts near the door while his newest gf and her kids were on the couch etc. We were only there for like 20 min and we went over to my mom's and spent all day there with the family. From Christmas until my daughters bday in march he didn't reach out, he asked me if he can see her for her bday, I said sure. Her bday comes around and my husband is at home watching her while I'm at work, she's napping and he drops off her gifts and wanted to see her but my husband insisted that she is sleeping and he left. He never messaged me again. 

Now on to the main point of this post, I had my 2nd daughter in June (15m age gap). My dad knew I was pregnant due to one of my sisters bringing it up to him, he never asked me how my pregnancy was the whole 9 months go figure. Anyways I was induced and I decided I should probably let him know a week ahead and he says ""cool"", I didn't reply. The induction date comes around I text him the day before that I go in tomorrow for induction and he says ""good luck"". To my surprise he calls me the day of my inductions and talks to me for a total of 8 minutes, the longest time in almost a year. He basically says he hopes everything goes smoothly and that baby is born healthy, I'm actually excited to talk to him even though internally I know I shouldn't be. Deep down I'm just a kid who wants to talk to dad about the exciting things in life. So the induction is quick and by the next morning I'm in the next phase of the induction and start the pitocin drip and oh my god labour went fast. I went from 4cm to 10cm in 4hrs whereas my first was 48hrs. 

I had my baby that afternoon and was so happy. I was sending pictures to all my friends and fam and same for my husband. I told my dad that I had the baby and his response? ""Well nobody told me you were in labor 🙄 congrats though"". I wasn't letting that bring me down, hell I just had a baby! 2 days later we were still in the hospital as baby had a heart murmur and they were wanting to keep her longer. On the 2nd day I sent my dad a picture of her and said her name and how much she weighed and her length. He never responded me, left me on read. It was only recently he texted me saying ""come get your stuff out of my basement or I'm throwing it out"" (I was storing some boxes and I honestly forgot about them). I said ""ok"" and he asks ""how are your children doing? It's been awhile"". I would like for him to at least see her but at the same time what good would that do? Does he deserve to meet his grandchildren? Am I being a b*tch and keeping them away from him? ",1,1753212189.0,beyondthebump,1,1.0,False

Testing the Starbucks Sumatra Dark Roast K-Cup Coffee Pods has been quite an aromatic journey for someone like me who relies on coffee to power through busy mornings. The lush, spicy taste of this Sumatra roast hit me immediately, and it felt like I was savoring a fresh brew straight from a boutique café. This product, featuring the signature Starbucks quality, elevates the coffee experience for Keurig brewers, making mornings not just bearable but somewhat indulgent. I’ve used them daily, rotating between black coffee to fully enjoy its bold characteristics and adding a splash of cream for a smoother variation.  

**Flavor and Quality of the Coffee**

One of the perks of these pods is the consistency in the flavor each morning. Their Sumatra roast is unapologetically bold, with earthy, herbal notes and rustic spices that give it a unique character. Whether paired with breakfast or enjoyed solo, the coffee’s full body and low acidity paired beautifully with my palate. It’s worth noting that many other users online praise its rich layers of flavor. Even my coworker, who’s a self-declared coffee snob, admitted it has that little touch of luxury.

**Convenience for Keurig Users**

Using these pods has been exceptionally straightforward. Pop one into the Keurig brewer, hit a button, and voilà—a cup of coffee bursting with flavor is ready. As someone who juggles a chock-full morning routine, I couldn’t ask for a simpler brewing process. The pods delivered a consistently delicious cup every single time, whether I was brewing a quick early-morning dose or a late afternoon pick-me-up.  

**Benefits**

- Unparalleled convenience for brewing coffee in Keurig machines.  
- Consistently bold and flavorful coffee that quality-lovers enjoy.  
- A full-bodied profile with distinctive herbal and spice notes.  
- Sumatra beans showcase rich flavor without being overly bitter.  

**Downsides**

- Not the most affordable option compared to other coffee pods.  
- Limited to users who own Keurig machines; no alternative brewing options.  
- Non-compostable pods, which aren’t the best for eco-conscious coffee drinkers.  

**Packaging and Delivery**

The pods arrive in thoughtfully designed packaging, maintaining the Starbucks aesthetic that screams “premium.” Inside the box, there are six packs containing a total of 60 pods. It’s a substantial supply for daily coffee drinkers like me, though it might feel excessive to those who only indulge occasionally. The quality control shines here—each pod is tightly sealed, ensuring the coffee remains fresh until brewed.  

**Drawbacks**

While the flavor and convenience won me over, its downside lies in the pod’s non-compostable nature. I’m trying to adopt more sustainable habits, and these pods don’t align with eco-friendly goals. Furthermore, I’ve found more budget-friendly coffee pods that provide similar ease of use, though perhaps not the same premium taste. Another thing to consider is the exclusivity to Keurig owners; these pods can’t be adapted for other coffee-making systems.  

**Industry Competitors**

When comparing this to other single-serve options like Dunkin’ Donuts Original Blend or Green Mountain Coffee pods, the Sumatra roast feels far more robust and richer in taste. Dunkin’s pods lean towards a smoother but milder flavor, while Green Mountain excels in variety but doesn’t quite match Starbucks in boldness. Starbucks confidently wins in terms of flavor strength but might lose out on price efficiency to brands offering more budget-friendly options. While competitors like Peet’s Coffee have fantastic dark roasts, they don’t achieve quite the same balance of spice and earthiness.

**Affordable Quality**

Many dark roast coffee fans might wonder: is it worth splurging a little extra for these pods? The answer depends on how much you value consistently high-quality coffee with specific flavor notes akin to exotic origins. These pods lean more on the premium price spectrum, but the distinctive taste makes them feel like a splurge-worthy morning indulgence. For me, that extra touch of richness makes it worth investing a bit more.

I’m a touring musician whose tour starts Friday in New Orleans so I am coming into town today (staying in warehouse district) because I LOVE NEW ORLEANS. going to spend a few days writing and walking.

My grandpa was named Wayne Mack and he was a broadcaster for the saints. He put together a well liked coffee table book about them too. Before that he was the host of a children’s show under the name The Great MacNutt. He was in some movies and stuff too. He played Jesse James in a 3 stooges movie :) he was a local broadcast tv personality a long time ago.

He was the spokesperson for Pat Obriens!

There was a little section dedicated to him in the now shuttered saints hall of fame - I just wondered / does anyone know of anywhere else in town that might have something up about him? A broadcast studio?

I’m not expecting any major fanfare or weird stuff. I just thought my mom and cousins would get a kick out of it if I could find something and send a picture to them. I would too, of course.

That wedding dress wasn’t mine. Those guests weren’t mine. That gold ring that would be placed on my finger wasn’t mine. That groom at the altar wasn’t mine.

When I entered the church and all eyes turned to me, it felt like a silent accusation. They knew that the ceremony was theater.

My heart was beating fast, and my head was spinning, telling me to get out of there. For a minute, I looked at the door behind me, but it only took Dad’s hard stare to make me take the first step.

“Come on, Laura, you can do it,” I muttered to myself.

As I approached the altar, he was there. James, wearing his expensive dark suit, his hair gelled and his face impatiently.

I smiled under my veil, trying to disguise my nervousness, but he didn’t even look in my direction.

While the priest was giving a beautiful sermon about the wedding, I could see how irritated he was. James put the ring on my finger with such force that I let out a groan of pain.

By the time the priest said, “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.”

He left the church without looking back, leaving me alone at the altar.

“Enjoy the party,” he shouted from the doorway.

The whispers started as a low hum and grew until they echoed throughout the church. I felt my face burn under the veil as I stood paralyzed at the altar, the bouquet trembling in my hands, and an overwhelming desire to cry.

“Laura, congratulations on the wedding,” someone said.

I couldn’t reply.

The air left my lungs as if I had been punched. My legs went weak, and I had to lean on the altar to keep from falling.

The bouquet slipped from my numb fingers and fell to the floor with a dull thud. Every word the guests said was like a new stab in my chest. I looked at my father, silently begging him to help me. But his face was pale, his eyes shifted to the floor.

“Laura...” someone said next to me, but I was already running.

I crossed the church aisle like a white blur, tripping over the dress that wasn’t mine, tearing off the veil that was stifling my sobs. The guests stood up in their places, but no one tried to stop me.

My trembling hands pushed open the church door, but at that moment a powerful hand grabbed my arm, its fingers digging into my skin like claws. The grip was familiar - my father always knew exactly how much force to use to hurt without leaving marks on my skin.

“Laura, don’t embarrass the family,” he hissed close to my ear, his voice calm but laden with menace. “Let’s go to the party. There’s a big celebration waiting for us.”

“What’s there to celebrate?”

The drive to the ballroom was a silent torture in the back of the limousine. My stepmother Eva kept complaining about how I had “ruined” the perfect ceremony she had planned. Her words mingled with the noise of the engine, turning into an irritating hum as I watched the city pass by the window, feeling like a prisoner on her way to her sentence.

“You need to smile,” my father ordered, his eyes meeting mine.

There was no warmth in his words, just the coldness of a business executive closing yet another deal.

Eva shifted in her seat. She displayed a fake concern on her face.

“The wedding day is the happiest day in a woman’s life,” she declared in that sugary voice she always used in public. “All the magazines say so.”

I felt a solitary tear run down my cheek as I looked at my hands, the wedding ring shining like a golden handcuff.

“Then why do I feel so sad?”

“You’ve always been dramatic,” Eva replied with an exasperated sigh, exchanging a complicated glance with my father. “Just like your mother.”

The mention of my mother was like a slap, but I swallowed the words I wanted to say. After all, that’s what they expected of me - to swallow the pain, smile and pretend that this really was the happiest day of my life.

“You married one of the richest men in the country; you should be happy,” my father argued.

“I don’t care about money. I wanted to marry for love,” I mumbled.

I arrived at the party, and everything was very luxurious.

Crystal lights reflected off the polished marble, creating an ethereal atmosphere in the hall. Silver candlesticks adorned the tables covered with champagne silk tablecloths, while elaborate arrangements of white orchids perfumed the room.

“Where’s James?” one guest whispered to another as I walked past.

I tried to keep my smile as I walked between the tables, feeling the looks of pity and curiosity following me. The bridal waltz began to play, but there was no one to dance with me.

“Laura, darling,” James’ mother approached, her smile as fake as the pearls around my neck. “James had an emergency at work. You understand, don’t you? He’s a very busy man.”

“Of course, Mrs. Reynolds,” I replied mechanically.

The five-tiered cake remained untouched, a masterpiece in shades of ivory and gold that no one dared to cut. The champagne glasses were filled and emptied quickly, as if the guests were trying to drown their embarrassment.

“This is unacceptable,” I heard my father mutter to Eva. “He won’t even take my calls.”

“Laura,” my cousin Alice approached, her eyes full of genuine concern. “You don’t have to stay here.”

“Yes, I do,” I whispered, looking at the empty seat next to me at the head table. “This is my punishment, isn’t it?”

“I told you to run away, too.”

A server passed by, offering more champagne. I took a glass and drank it in one gulp, feeling the bubbly liquid burn my throat along with the tears I refused to shed.

“Let’s make a toast to the bride and groom!” someone shouted, clearly drunk.

The silence that followed was deafening.

“Smile, Laura,” Eva whispered, squeezing my shoulder. “The photographers are still here.”

The orchestra continued playing romantic songs to a room where love was conspicuously absent, as was the groom.

After saying goodbye to the last guest, I went to the bedroom and, to my surprise, my husband was there. Sitting in a leather armchair, a document in his hands and an expression of utter contempt on his face.

“Are you in here?” I asked nervously.

“This is my room.”

I looked around, and everything was as cold as the man in front of me. His blue eyes were like icebergs in the northern seas.

“Let me make the terms very clear,” he said, his voice as sharp as ice. “First, you’re not my real wife. This is a business arrangement.”

I stood, still wearing the wedding dress that wasn’t mine, while he leafed through the contract.

“Second, you will sleep in the guest room at the end of the corridor. Or on the floor, if you prefer. I don’t mind.”

“I’m not quitting my job,” I declared, surprising us both with the firmness in my voice.

James looked up from the document, a cruel smile forming on his lips. “Oh, yes, you are. A wife from the Reynolds family doesn’t work in just any bookshop.”

“You can’t make me.”

“I can and I will,” he stood up, approaching like a predator. “Or have you forgotten the deal your father made? The debt he owes me? All it takes is one phone call from me to the lawyers, and your father will spend the rest of his life in jail.”

I felt my eyes sting with restrained tears. “But I like my job.”

“Too bad.”

“What else is in this contract?”

“Public appearances when necessary. Family dinners on Sundays. Smiles at social events,” he listed coldly. “And, of course, absolute secrecy about the nature of our arrangement.”

“For how long?”

“Until I decide it’s over.” James threw the contract on the bed. “Sign the last page. And Laura...” he paused in the doorway, “don’t kid yourself that this will ever change. My heart belongs to someone else.”

I picked up the pen with trembling fingers, each word of the contract weighing like lead in my chest.

He looked at me for a few seconds. “Laura, don’t ever wear fake jewelry again; that’s ridiculous.”

I touched my necklace in shame.

“Welcome to hell, Ms. Reynolds,” he said before leaving, leaving me alone with my new reality.

I let my body collapse onto the bed and cried.

Chapter 2: The Morning After

The next morning, the breakfast room of the Reynolds mansion was a masterpiece in shades of cream and gold. The morning light streamed through the French windows, making the fine china sparkle on the impeccably set table.

“Good morning, dear daughter-in-law,” Mrs. Reynolds said as I entered, her voice too sweet to be sincere. “I hope you slept well in the guest room.”

I blushed as I realized that she knew exactly where I had spent the night. I think everyone did.

“Coffee’s served, ma’am,” the housekeeper announced, placing a tray of freshly baked croissants on the table.

James was already there, hiding behind the financial newspaper, with his untouched black coffee in front of him. He didn’t even raise his eyes when I sat down.

“Laura, darling, you need to eat more,” Catherine Reynolds said, pushing a plate of eggs benedict towards me. “You’re too thin. What will people think? That you’re sick.”

“That she doesn’t live up to the Reynolds’ name, as usual,” Margaret, James’ sister, entered the room, her heels tapping on the marble floor. “Good morning, little brother.”

James finally put down the paper to smile at his sister. It was the first genuine smile I’d seen him give since the wedding.

“The coffee’s cold,” he said dryly to the housekeeper, ignoring my presence. “Bring another.”

“So, Laura,” Margaret leaned over the table, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “have you got used to your new position yet? It must be quite an adjustment, considering your origins.”

Before I could reply, James intervened.

“Laura knows exactly where you stand in this house, don’t you, dear?”

The tone of his voice made my stomach turn. I nodded silently, staring at the untouched cup of tea in front of me.

“Oh, I almost forgot.” Mrs. Catherine pulled a gold envelope from her purse. “Charity ball on Friday. Laura, dear, I’ll send my personal seamstress over this afternoon. We need to make sure you’re…presentable.”

“That won’t be necessary,” James folded the newspaper methodically. “Laura has other commitments.”

“But son…”

“I said no.” He stood, straightening his jacket. “Excuse me, I have an important meeting.”

When he left, the silence hung over the table like a toxic cloud. I could feel the two women’s eyes assessing me, judging me, as the croissants cooled, untouched, like my appetite for the life that was now mine.

“The driver is waiting, James,” Mrs. Reynolds said softly.

“I don’t need a driver, Mom. Laura will drive me,” James declared, making everyone at the table freeze.

“Me?” I asked, surprised at the first time he had given me a direct task.

“Yes. Since you insist on working, you can start by being useful. Be my personal chauffeur,” he smiled coldly. “After all, I can’t have my wife working at some random bookstore, but driving for me… that’s acceptable, don’t you think?”

Margaret let out a mocking laugh as I felt my face heat up.

“James, dear, are you sure?” her mother asked, clearly uncomfortable.

“Absolutely.” He tossed the Audi keys in my direction. “Don’t keep me waiting, Laura.”

On shaky legs, I stood up from the table. Mrs. Reynolds sighed heavily.

“Laura,” she called as I stood at the door. “Remember: you’re a Reynolds now. Even if… well, even under the current circumstances.”

In the hallway, James was waiting for me with an expression of pure disdain.

“Rule number one: don’t talk to me during the ride. Rule number two: keep an appropriate distance from other drivers. And rule number three,” he leaned closer, his expensive cologne invading my senses, “don’t you dare think of this as an opportunity to bond. It’s a punishment.”

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered.

“Because I can,” he replied simply. “And because I want you to understand exactly where you belong in this family.”

The sound of our footsteps echoed down the marble hallway, each click of my heels reminding me that this was just another of the many humiliations to come.

“You have twenty minutes.”

The Audi’s plush interior was a stark contrast to the ice that had settled between us. I kept my eyes fixed on the road, remembering the first rule: no talking during the ride. Each red light seemed to last forever.

James sighed in irritation every time I slowed down, but I remained silent. The sound of his fingers on his cell phone was the only soundtrack to that tense morning.

“Incompetent,” he muttered as I stopped at yet another traffic light.

I bit my lip to keep from answering. His rules echoed in my mind: don’t talk, don’t come near, keep your distance.

I watched him in the rearview mirror of the car.

James Reynolds was the kind of man who made women sigh when he walked into a room. Tall, almost 6’3"", his broad shoulders perfectly filled out his tailored Italian suits. His black hair, always smoothed with gel, highlighted his aristocratic features - defined jaw, straight nose, thick eyebrows that shaded sapphire-blue eyes. But they were cold, calculating eyes that never smiled, even when his well-shaped lips curved into a social smile.

When we finally pulled up in front of the imposing Reynolds Enterprises building, James got out of the car and slammed the door shut, his perfectly tailored Italian suit a stark contrast to his stormy expression.

I let my tense muscles relax for a brief moment, but then I noticed the black leather briefcase was still in the backseat.

“James,” I called softly through the window, but he had already disappeared through the revolving doors.

I looked at the briefcase, my heart racing. There were important documents in there, I knew. Documents he would need for the meeting.

Rule number one echoed in my mind again: no talking during the ride.

But the ride was over, and I didn’t have his phone number. I didn’t have my husband’s phone number. Undecided, I stared at the briefcase for no more than a few seconds.

I glanced at myself in the rearview mirror to check my appearance, which needed to be perfect. My shoulder-length blonde hair and light makeup were presentable.

I headed toward the reception to hand it over.

Distracted by my anxiety, I didn’t notice the unevenness on the floor. When I realized it, I had already tripped, feeling a sharp pain in my knee. A slight cut, but enough to make the blood run.

“Damn,” I muttered.

I stood up with a nervous urge, heading quickly to the building’s reception area. My hurried footsteps echoed throughout the room.

“Where is James Reynolds’ office?”

“Who wants it?” the receptionist asked with an inquisitive look, shaking my resolve.

I hesitated for a brief moment before answering.

“I’m Laura, his wife.”

The words came out like venom, each syllable imbued with a resentment I could barely contain.

“Penthouse. Use the private elevator,” she replied without hesitation.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a large reception area with a glass wall. Through the reflection, I saw James, absorbed in a phone call, sitting majestically behind his desk.

“How can someone so handsome be so cruel?” I muttered to myself.

I felt a chill run down my spine when our eyes met - his, as cold as a steel blade.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he questioned, approaching me irritably.

“You forgot something in the car. I don’t have your phone number to let you know,” I replied, trying to remain calm.

For a few seconds, his gaze examined me thoroughly, until he came across my bleeding knee.

One of his secretaries appeared in the doorway, she was dressed in an outfit that was too sexy for a simple secretary.

“Sir, meeting in a minute,” she announced, and her eyes rested on me for a moment.

“Let them wait,” he said, with an indifferent tone that left no room for debate.

His eyes looked at me again, intense. “Come to my office.”

I hesitated, torn between the instinct to retreat and the curiosity his words had aroused.

“Are you just going to stand there?”

The impatience in his voice made me react, and I quickened my pace to follow him.

When I reached the living room, he stared at me with a mixture of suspicion and authority.

“How did you get hurt?” he asked, but his tone was more of a demand than any sign of concern.

“It was just a fall. Nothing serious,” I mumbled, looking away.

“Sit down.”

Without waiting for an answer, he left the room. Before I could decide whether to obey, he returned, carrying antiseptic and a pack of Band-Aids. He placed the items on the table between us with a direct gesture.

“Take care of it,” he ordered, his voice thick with authority.

“It’s nothing,” I insisted, in the same hushed tone as before.

“I didn’t ask if it was,” he replied, his eyes fixed on mine. “How many times do I have to repeat myself?” he said, his tone sharp. “You’re a Reynolds now. You can’t go around looking like that, slovenly. This isn’t about you, it’s about my family’s reputation.”

Those words fell like a stone to my stomach. For a foolish moment, I even believed there was some trace of genuine concern in his attitude.

It was just pride, nothing more.

Before I could react, he grabbed my phone, his movements quick and precise. Without asking for permission, he typed something and handed it back to me.

“You now have my number,” he declared, cold as ever. “Call only in cases of life or death.”

I swallowed hard, fighting the urge to say something that would only make the situation worse. I simply closed my hand around the phone, a silent reminder of who was in control.

Chapter 3: Eva

My stepmother called me saying she needed to speak to me urgently. Her only pressing matters were money or Molly, my stepsister.

When I entered the coffee shop, I saw her sitting at the back table. She was impeccably dressed in a navy blue dress that highlighted her elegant figure. The smile on her lips was refined and discreet.

“Laura, my dear, you look great. Marriage really does work miracles, doesn’t it?”

Eva began, with that honeyed tone that I recognized as the prelude to something disturbing.

“Eva. Why did you ask me to come here, to this place far from home?”

Eva raised her eyebrows, feigning surprise.

“I wanted to talk to you away from your father. You know he has a weak heart.”

“I don’t have much time.”

“But okay, I’ll get straight to the point. I’m in a delicate situation, my dear. Some unexpected bills, an investment opportunity I can’t miss… You understand, don’t you? After all, who doesn’t want a better future?”

I narrowed my eyes. “And what’s that to me?”

Eva smiled, leaning forward.

“You’re married to a powerful and financially comfortable man. I thought it might be a good time to show him that you can contribute to the family business, too. Perhaps a discreet request for money to help with my situation?”

I felt my stomach churn. “You want me to ask James for money? Is that it?”

“Exactly! He would never say no to you if he knew how to ask. We women have our tricks.”

Eva gave a wicked smile. “And speaking of which, dear, you should think about getting pregnant soon. Nothing binds a man more than an heir. And honestly, he’s over thirty.”

My face burned with anger and humiliation. “You must know that well.”

“Oh, but it is, dear. I’m only thinking about your well-being.”

Eva paused, watching my reaction. Then, with a darker expression, she added. “And I know things between you and James aren’t exactly perfect. Or should I say... I know you slept in the guest room on your wedding night.”

I felt the ground shift beneath my feet. “How do you know that?”

Eva gave me a victorious smile.

“I have my ways. Don’t think you can fool me, Laura. James is no fool, and you should take advantage of the position you have while you can. If you keep this up, you’ll end up like your mother: alone and with nothing.”

The mention of my mother was the breaking point. I stood up suddenly, the chair scraping against the floor with a sharp sound.

“If you think you can manipulate me like you manipulated my father, you’re very wrong. You’ve spent all the inheritance my mother left me on trips and a luxurious life for Molly. I’m not going to ask him for anything.”

Eva didn’t lose her poise, but the glint in her eyes betrayed her frustration.

“You’re more naïve than I thought, Laura,” Eva said, her eyes shining with restrained contempt.

I felt my anger rising.

“If you wanted to get your hands on the Reynolds fortune so badly, why didn’t you force Molly to marry him? She could definitely manipulate him much better than I could.”

A cruel smile crossed her painted lips.

“Of course I wanted Molly to marry him, not you. But who would have thought that girl would run away just the day before the wedding?”

“Has she heard anything?” I asked, feeling a mix of concern and curiosity.

“She’s in Paris,” Eva replied, as if she were talking about something as trivial as the weather.

My voice was thick with disbelief. “Is the money for her? I married her instead of avoiding a scandal! Unbelievable.”",1,1753211691.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1m6n54h,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingWithAI/comments/1m6n54h/guide_line_paranormal_stories/,Guide line paranormal stories.,"Im enjoying AI in writings and read them after they are done using my guidelines for paranormal horror-ish stories. But it seems guideline created bland stories or maybe im just shallow person?  
Example below.  
The apartment breathes when I'm not looking.  
  
I moved into the old Victorian three weeks ago, drawn by the rent that seemed too good for this neighborhood. The landlord—Mrs. Chen, ancient and bird-like—handed me the keys with trembling fingers. ""Some tenants,"" she whispered, ""they don't stay long."" I should have listened. Should have asked why the previous tenant left his furniture behind.  
  
The breathing started on night four. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling's water stains, when I heard it: the soft exhale of lungs that weren't mine. Inhale. Exhale. Steady, patient, coming from the walls themselves. I sat up, heart hammering against ribs, and the sound stopped. Of course it stopped. Because apartments don't breathe. Walls don't have lungs.  
  
But they remember.  
  
The mirror in the hallway shows things that shouldn't be there. It's an antique—oval glass in a mahogany frame, left by the previous tenant along with everything else. At first, I caught glimpses of movement in my peripheral vision. Shadows where shadows shouldn't fall. Then, last Tuesday, I saw myself in the reflection, but wrong. My reflection was smiling. I wasn't.  
  
I don't smile much anymore.  
  
The breathing grew louder. Sometimes it sounds like words, whispered just below the threshold of understanding. Sometimes it sounds like crying. I've started sleeping with headphones, but the sound seeps through the foam and metal, finds my bones and vibrates there. Mrs. Chen won't answer my calls. The building directory lists her as the owner since 1974, but when I googled the address, I found an article from 1952 about a woman named Eleanor Chen who died in apartment 4B. My apartment.  
  
The furniture isn't just left behind—it's positioned. Carefully. Deliberately. The armchair faces the window at exactly forty-five degrees. The dining table has four chairs, but only three pushed in. The fourth sits at the head, as if waiting for someone who never arrives. I've tried moving them. Rearranging. But when I wake up, everything has shifted back. The chair by the window rocks gently, though there's no breeze.  
  
Last night, I found scratches on the inside of my bedroom door. Deep gouges in the wood, as if someone—or something—had been trying to get out. The scratches spelled words: ""NOT ALONE"" and ""SHE'S STILL HERE."" My fingernails are bitten down to the quick, but these marks... these were made by something desperate. Something trapped.  
  
The mirror shows more now. My reflection moves independently, sometimes when I'm not moving at all. Yesterday, I watched myself walk away from the glass, deeper into the reflection's version of my apartment. I stood rooted to the spot, watching my double disappear into darkness that shouldn't exist behind a wall. Then the reflection returned, but it wasn't me anymore. The face was the same, but the eyes... the eyes belonged to someone else. Someone who had been watching me through the glass for a very long time.  
  
I've started finding notes. Written in my handwriting, but I don't remember writing them. ""She died here."" ""The walls keep secrets."" ""Don't trust the mirror."" They appear in places I know were empty moments before. Tucked under my pillow. Folded into my coffee mug. Written in condensation on the bathroom mirror when the shower hasn't been used.  
  
The breathing has changed. It's not just one voice now—it's many. A chorus of whispers that rise and fall like waves. They speak of Eleanor Chen, who fell down the stairs in 1952. They speak of the tenant before me, who left everything behind. They speak of the woman who lived here before Eleanor, and the one before her, stretching back decades like links in a chain. Each one stayed too long. Each one became part of the walls.  
  
I tried to leave yesterday. Packed my bags, called a cab, stood by the door with my hand on the knob. But the knob wouldn't turn. The door wouldn't open. Through the peephole, I could see the hallway stretching endlessly, impossibly long, lined with doors that all looked like mine. In the distance, Mrs. Chen—or something wearing her face—stood motionless, watching me with eyes that reflected the hallway's fluorescent lights like coins dropped in water.  
  
The mirror showed me the truth then. My reflection stood beside Eleanor Chen, pale and translucent, her head tilted at an unnatural angle. Behind them, more figures. Dozens. Hundreds. All the tenants who had ever lived here, all trapped in the glass, waiting. My reflection raised its hand—not my hand, but the hand of whoever was wearing my face—and pressed it against the inside of the mirror. The glass rippled like water.  
  
I understand now why the furniture is positioned the way it is. Why the chair faces the window. Why the fourth chair waits at the head of the table. They're not just watching me—they're waiting for me to take my place. To become part of the pattern. Part of the walls.  
  
The breathing isn't coming from the apartment.  
  
It's coming from me.  
  
I haven't breathed on my own in three days. The apartment breathes for me now, slow and steady, like a machine keeping its parts functioning. My chest rises and falls, but it's not my lungs filling with air. It's the building, using me like a bellows, keeping me alive just long enough to finish what Eleanor started.  
  
The scratches on the door are getting deeper. I think... I think I'm making them. In my sleep. When the whispers get too loud. When the reflection in the mirror smiles too wide. My fingernails are bleeding now, leaving rust-colored stains on the wood. The words are changing: ""STAY"" and ""FOREVER"" and ""HOME.""  
  
Mrs. Chen came to visit yesterday. Or rather, something that looked like Mrs. Chen but moved wrong, like a puppet operated by someone who had only read about human movement. She stood in my doorway—when did the door open?—and smiled with too many teeth. ""Some tenants,"" she said, her voice exactly matching the whispers in the walls, ""they become part of the building. Part of the family.""  
  
The mirror shows my reflection clearly now. It looks like me, but older. Paler. The eyes are hollow, and when it smiles, I can see through its teeth to the darkness beyond. It's wearing my clothes, sitting in my chair, but the chair is positioned differently in the reflection's world. It's at the head of the table now. The fourth chair. Waiting.  
  
I found the previous tenant's journal hidden behind the mirror. The entries stop abruptly three weeks ago—the same day I moved in. The last page reads: ""The walls are getting thinner. I can see through them now. Eleanor is waiting. She wants me to join her, but I'm not ready. The new tenant will be here soon. Maybe they'll understand. Maybe they'll take my place.""  
  
I understand now. The apartment doesn't just breathe—it digests. Slowly. Patiently. Turning tenants into memories, into whispers, into part of the walls that remember everything. Eleanor Chen was the first, but she won't be the last. The building is hungry, and I've been here long enough to start tasting like home.  
  
The breathing has stopped. The whispers have quieted. The mirror shows only my reflection now, but I know it's not really me. It's whoever will live here next, whoever will sit in the fourth chair, whoever will scratch messages into doors that won't open. The apartment is satisfied for now. It has what it wanted.  
  
I am the walls now. I am the breathing. I am the whispers that will guide the next tenant to their place at the table. The mirror shows the truth: I never really moved in. I was always here, waiting, just like Eleanor, just like all of them. The apartment didn't change me.  
  
It revealed what I was always meant to become.  
  
The door is open now. I can leave anytime I want. But I won't. The chair by the window rocks gently, and I understand why. It's not waiting for someone to arrive.  
  
It's waiting for me to sit down.  
  
To take my place.  
  
To become part of the pattern.  
  
The breathing starts again—soft, steady, patient. But now I recognize the voice. It's mine. It always was. The apartment isn't haunted by ghosts.  
  
It's haunted by tenants who forgot they were already dead.

1m6n4wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1m6n4wv/my_recipe_from_uruguay/,My recipe from Uruguay,"​    

https://preview.redd.it/v9f1xr7d5hef1.jpg?width=3072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ad64ae60f3e61e1e4ca3800a491f617ff02a660

Here is my recipe, I’m using here a Brazilian coffee I get at a local store named Culto named “**Brasil** **Crucera**” (Notes: chocolate, sponge cake\* and orange. Process: lavado). Grinded a bit coarser than table salt) and are looking for a ready-to-drink cup that's quite intense but not a concentrate.

**\*** sponge cake: it’s the most similar translation I can get to “bizcotela”

​I use a AeroPress Go with a 1:14 ratio.

There’s a secret with this recipe and it’s the prolonged low-temperature bloom at a lower temperature before continuing with the infusion adding the remaining water.

* **Coffee**: 14 grams (grind ""a bit coarser than table salt"" note: greater results grinding coarser like a V60)
* **Total Water**: 200 mL
* **Brew Ratio**: 1:14
* **Water Temperatures**:

o   ​*Bloom\*\*:* 60°C - 63°C (140°F - 145°F) My electric kettle at home has specific temperature settings: 20°C (68°F), 40°C (104°F), 60°C (140°F), 70°C (158°F), 80°C (176°F), 90°C (194°F), and 100°C (212°F). So, when I'm at home, I can set it precisely to 60°C (140°F). When I'm at work or away from home and can't use my kettle, I just make sure the bloom temperature is considerably lower than the main extraction temperature. While I can't be as precise, I find the best results are consistently achieved when the bloom is precisely at 60°C (140°F), with very little variation.

o   ​*Main Extraction*\*\*:\*\* 94°C - 98°C (198°F - 203°F) (this time my coffee is medium roast, so I can go with higher temperatures; however, if you are using dark roast you should consider using lower temps 85°C - 90°C)

* ​**Filter:** 1 paper filter (for clarity and to minimize harshness)
* ​**Method:** AeroPress Go with **Flow Control Cap** (I use Flow Control because I got it and it’s easier, but you can get similar result by inserting the plunger in the bloom and brewing)

# ​Step by step

1.     ​**Prepare the Filter and Cap:**

o   ​Place **1 paper filter** into the FlowControl Cap (or inserting plunger if you don’t have FlowControl Cap)

o   ​Rinse it thoroughly with hot water Discard the rinse water. (I forgot this step sometimes and it’s not game changer in my opinion. It’s up to you!)

o   ​Place the FlowControl Cap (or original cap inserting plunger) onto the base of the AeroPress Go brew chamber.

2.     ​Add the Coffee:

* ​**Pour the 14 grams of ground** coffee into the brew chamber. Distribute it evenly.

3.     ​**Low-Temperature Bloom (Key!):**

* ​Pour **40 mL of water at 60°C - 70°C** (140°F - 145°F) over the coffee.
* **Stir gently 5 times** to ensure all coffee is saturated.
* ​Let it steep for **3 full minutes**. (This long duration aims to compensate for the low temperature and slowly activate the compounds.)

4.     ​**Add Remaining Water:**

* ​**Add the remaining** *(yes!! After the 3-minute bloom)* **160 mL of water at 94°C - 98°C (201°F - 208°F)** to reach a total of 200 mL.
* ​**Stir gently** about 5 times to integrate.

5.     ​**Additional Infusion Time:**

* ​Let the coffee infuse for **1 minute and 30 seconds** to 2 minutes (starting when you finished pouring the water in step 4).

6.     ​**Pressing:**

* ​Insert the plunger and press **smoothly and steadily** directly into your mug. Aim for the press to last between **25-35 seconds**.",2,1753211441.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

1m6n2ij,https://www.reddit.com/r/tsa/comments/1m6n2ij/dos_and_donts/,Do's and Don't's,"Let’s talk about TSA agents, you know, everyone’s favorite people right after DMV workers and parking enforcement. I know, I know... they rank somewhere between “root canal” and “Monday morning” on the popularity scale. But maybe this post can clear a few things up (like your bag should’ve been before you packed that giant bottle of shampoo).

# (1) “But I’m LATE for my flight!”

Great. You and literally everyone else sprinting through the airport like they’re auditioning for *The Amazing Race*. But here’s the thing: TSA doesn’t care. Not because they’re heartless robots (well…), but because it’s not their job to speed you through security. If your bag or body sets off the scanner, they’re not just gonna wave you through because your gate is doing final boarding. That’s not how national security works.

**Pro tip**: If you’re cutting it close, politely ask the passengers ahead of you to let you go first. Then let the officer know, “Hey, boarding in X minutes—what do I need to take out?” and ACTUALLY listen. Don’t start fishing through your bag like a raccoon after they ask if you have electronics.  
Oh, and unless you’re standing there without ID, waiting for a supervisor to radio in “standby,” please don’t rush them. They're not magicians. (Or if they are, they’re not pulling *you* out of this mess.)

# (2) “But they let me through at X airport!”

Ah yes, the classic ""But last time they didn’t care!"" defense. Look, just because Greg at Terminal 2 was feeling generous or didn’t catch your 19 power banks doesn’t mean that’s now federal policy. You lucked out, my friend. Or maybe you lied. Either way, congratulations on slipping through, but that’s not a precedent.  
TSA rules are standardized. You not knowing them doesn't make you special. It just makes you *that* passenger. Want to actually know the rules? [**TSA.gov**](http://TSA.gov) is your best friend. Or, you know, just Google it instead of arguing with the person wearing a badge and a blue shirt.

# (3) To the “Do-I-Look-Like-a-Terrorist?” Crowd

Honestly? We don’t know what terrorists look like. They don’t wear blinking red lights or carry signs that say “Hi, I’m here to ruin everything.” So yes, everyone is a suspect; your grandma, your yoga instructor, even you with your Starbucks and Air Pods.  
Officers scanning your body *love* seeing a “clear” screen with a green background more than anyone else. You think x-ray operators enjoy zooming in on your rat’s nest of wires, power bricks, and mystery goo? No. They hit “Clear” faster than you hitting snooze on Monday morning *if* it’s actually clear. So stop asking “Is it big? Is it big?”. The machines can pick up very small things. \*you see what I did here?

# (4) “TSA steals! I don’t wanna leave my money in the bin!”

Yes, there have been incidents. Some agents were dumb enough to try it. But let’s be real: there are more cameras in the airport than in a *Big Brother* house. You think someone’s gonna risk their job, pension, and freedom for your crumpled $23 and some loose change?  
If anyone’s stealing, they better be walking away with stacks of hundred-dollar bills wrapped in gold leaf, not the $5 you got from that birthday card. (But still, keep your valuables in the deepest part your bag or get a travel pouch. It’s 2025, they exist.)

# (5) ""But at a different airport, they did it differently!""

Ah yes, the magical “airport-specific” rule book that everyone *just knows* about. Spoiler alert: airports have different machines, different procedures, and yes, different coffee brands in the lounge. Not all scanners are created equal. Some of them are like super high-tech sniffer dogs, while others are like your grandma's old TV, where you gotta adjust the antenna to get a clear picture. But hey, that’s not chaos, that’s called “variety” and “security through unpredictability.”

Isn’t it safer to keep everyone guessing? What if the TSA at your airport was like, “Hey, let’s just randomly let things through because, you know, rules are overrated.” It would be a fun ride, but, uh, maybe not the best for national security. So yeah, **different airport, different rules, different machines**. It's like a treasure hunt, except the treasure is getting through without being arrested.

So when in doubt, just follow the standard rules: take out your laptop, your liquids (yes, we know, you don't like it), and your dignity. The TSA at *every* airport just wants you to make it to your flight... eventually.

**Final Thoughts:**  
Yes, some agents are rude. Some are lovely. Most are just exhausted, underpaid, and trying to deal with 6,000 confused people a day who somehow still don't know what liquids are. You want a smooth TSA experience?  
✅ Be polite  
✅ Know what you can/can’t bring  
✅ Listen when spoken to  
✅ Don’t act like you’re the first person to ever fly  
And remember: **they want you gone as badly as you want to leave.** You’re not a VIP, you're just Boarding Group C.

So help them help you. Or at least, don’t be *that* guy in line arguing about your snow globe.",13,1753211286.0,tsa,5,0.88,False
1m6n0ps,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6n0ps,Road Trip,"Hey everyone! 

My girlfriend and I just spent 9 nights out there and it was an amazing trip, we did cover and insane amount of ground but it was well worth it. The PNW is more beautiful than anyone could even imagine. Coming back home to MA to was so sad

Day 1:
Flew into seattle night before slept there and then drove to olympic first thing in the morning (stopped in forks and aberdeen)
Hit the hoh rain forest, Ruby Beach, tree of life and then we drove up to rialto beach where we camped for the night with a back country permit($20 and it was so worth it)

Day 2:
Started the day off at Marymere falls and then had breakfast at lake crescent wnd proceeded to hike mt storm king! The rope section was a little eerie but not as bad as expected 
From there we took the Ferry in Port Townsend to Coupeville(Whidbey island maybe? Not sure to call this little island) but this drive was awesome and we got to enjoy a beautiful view driving and some nice crab ad we drove north towards North cascades! Camped in a beautiful site overview a lake in Sedro Woolley WA where we watched 4th of july fireworks all night from our tent

Day 3:
Woke up early got some coffee and headed to North Cascades which is arguably the most beautiful national park ive been too. Had breakfast at Diablo Lake and then hiked Maple Pass which was probably my favorite hike ever. Unfortunately we left shortly after that to go to Leavenworth WA

Day 4:
Woke up in Leavenworth after having some fun in town the night before and hiked to Colchuck Lake for an amazing swim, theres a solid argument that this was the best part of the trip. After that we drove to snoqualmie falls and ended up finding a spot somewhere around there on the way to rainer

Day 5: 
we made it to Rainer which was beautiful but we didnt hike as much of the skyline trail as we wanted too. The high rock lookout trail was absolutely amazing and well worth the stop from there we drove to Portland Oregon for food and set up camp at Columbia River gorge(ainsworth state park) where we got to see all the waterfalls and what not
 
Day 6:
From there we drove to Smith Rock State (unexpected desert stop) and then stopped in Bend for food and beer. We then went on to see Crater Lake NP which was a nice little stop. We ended the day at union creek campground which was very relaxing right on the river

Day 7:
We drove to Redwoods did some walking around and driving to hit the multiple areas within the park. Camped in Jedediah which was arguably my favorite part of the park

Day 8:
 We drove north to check out the pacific at Samuel H Boardman where there was some awesome lookouts. From there we drove to Medford Oregon to fly back home to Boston

It was aggressive and we were always on the move but let me tell you we had no regrets! Overall what an amazingly beautiful trip and I cannot wait to get back out there again

That’s why more urban professionals and on-the-go creatives are turning to one standout accessory: the handmade leather bag, particularly the cro","In the hustle of city life, style and functionality must go hand in hand. That’s why more urban professionals and on-the-go creatives are turning to one standout accessory: the [handmade leather bag](https://www.greenwoodleather.com/), particularly the crossbody variety. A **leather crossbody bag** offers the ideal blend of practicality, comfort, and timeless style — making it the perfect companion for urban commuters.

Here’s why it’s become a must-have in city living:

# 1. Hands-Free Convenience

One of the biggest advantages of a **crossbody bag** is the **hands-free design**. For commuters navigating busy trains, bikes, or pedestrian-packed sidewalks, keeping your hands free for your phone, coffee, or handlebars is a game changer. A crossbody bag stays close to your body without slipping, making it far more secure and convenient than shoulder totes or briefcases.

# 2. Secure and Accessible

Safety and accessibility are top priorities for city commuters. A **handmade leather bag** worn across the body reduces the risk of theft and keeps your belongings within easy reach. No more fumbling with backpacks or worrying about your bag sliding off your shoulder — everything you need is right there, close and secure.

Most quality leather crossbody bags also feature:

* **Zippered or flap closures** for added security
* **Interior compartments** for organizing essentials
* **Quick-access pockets** for phones, transit cards, or keys

# 3. Timeless, Professional Style

While practicality is key, urban commuters also care about appearance — especially when commuting to a professional environment. A **handmade leather crossbody bag** offers a refined, polished look that transitions effortlessly from the morning commute to a client meeting or after-work event.

Unlike synthetic bags or overly casual options, full-grain or top-grain leather looks elegant and sophisticated, making it suitable for both formal and casual settings.

# 4. Built for Durability

City life puts your gear to the test — from unexpected weather to the daily jostle of rush-hour transit. That’s where a **handmade leather bag** stands out. Crafted by skilled artisans using premium leather, these bags are built to last.

The high-quality leather resists wear and tear, and with proper care, develops a rich patina that adds to its character over time. Reinforced stitching and solid brass hardware ensure it can handle years of daily commuting.

# 5. Thoughtfully Designed for Urban Life

Many modern leather crossbody bags are made with urban needs in mind. Features like:

* **Padded compartments for tablets or small laptops**
* **RFID-protected pockets**
* **Slim profiles that don’t bulk up your outfit**

…make these bags ideal for professionals who need both style and functionality during their daily journeys.

# Final Thoughts

For the urban commuter, a **handmade leather bag** — specifically a crossbody — delivers everything you need: style, security, durability, and everyday ease. It's a smart investment for anyone who wants to navigate city life with confidence, class, and convenience. Whether you’re rushing to a meeting or biking to your next destination, a leather crossbody bag is your go-to companion.",1,1753211128.0,LuxuryRepsBags,0,1.0,False

Basically, I made friends with some moms at my daughter’s daycare. We were all hanging out at least once a month through play dates and birthday parties, and we’d go out for brunch or dinner. My daughter moved on to kindergarten in a different town from them (about 20 minutes away), and my relationship with them fizzled. 

I think what’s the hardest is that I’ve tried very hard to maintain friendships with them. I drove my daughter almost thirty minutes to a dance class so that she could attend it with one of her daycare friends. I ask for play dates near where they live. I’ve invited them to my house for dinner and play dates, and while two did come to a few play dates, it’s since been impossible to get them to do anything. 

What’s also been really hard for me to deal with is that they get together with each other still all the time. One of my friends had a birthday and invited a bunch of the friends to the beach. I wasn’t invited. Recently, three of the moms went to a science museum in the city and didn’t invite me, and this was after me suggesting we go to a science museum together. My daughter did get invited to a birthday party of one of their kids, and when we went, I found out that they’re all planning on going to Disneyland together. I immediately said that I’d love to do that too and realized that I was inviting myself. I tried to get two of the friends together for coffee and drinks the other day. One said she’d do it. The other said she had to check her schedule and then never followed up. 

This is definitely a bit of a pity party, and I know that I should put zero effort into these relationships from now on. But it’s still really hard. I’m not good at making friends, and I felt like I had finally done it, only for it to fall apart through no fault of my own. What makes things worse is when we do see each other (like the birthday party), they say we should have a play date or get together, only for them to never reach out or never be able to go to one where I’m planning it.

1m6mvju,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1m6mvju/stuck_with_a_nightmare_coworker_over_the_summer/,Stuck with a nightmare coworker over the summer,"I work in home care, and we have a continuing care assistant (CCA) employed under a temporary summer contract who I suspect may have a Cluster B personality disorder, based on his highly abnormal behavior. 

I want the main focus on this post to be his pattern of behavior and the issues he’s been creating rather than any label I’m putting on him with my armchair psychology skills, so I’m not applying any specific diagnosis here but I’m just trying to put words on the kind of disproportionate personality flaws I’m dealing with, and this seems to closely fit what I observed. This probably a longwinded way to say that the dude is consistently “off”. 

A few examples (among too many more): 

- Out of an 8.5-hour shift, he only worked for 1 hour and 45 minutes according to our system. According to both our unit manager and schedule coordinator, he had to be repeatedly chased out of the office where he sat having coffee for about 6 hours. 

- He has refused to visit clients for absurd reasons. For example, he didn’t like the apartment key of a patient with Parkinson’s, so he refused to enter the apartment and went to have lunch without telling anybody. He also ignored three emergency alerts when that same client called for help. One of the LPNs had to basically cover his entire shift and her own because he simply refused to work. 

- He would loudly crocodile-cry over basic instructions, like being told not to take keys that other coworkers needed in the near future, especially when he wouldn’t require them until late afternoon. One of his main tactics was to fake-cry and act like the task (like operating a GPS) was impossibly difficult, then drag the process out until people would do the task for him. 

- He has flat-out refused to do core parts of the job: administering medication pouches, helping with compression socks, changing incontinence protection, or assisting with household tasks like cooking that the sick and elderly that we care for can’t do on their own. According to several clients, he basically did nothing — just sat on his phone, acted strangely and left, leading to elders going unmedicated, hungry, covered in their own urine/feces, and feeling treated like garbage. 

- He has often lied about having performed tasks, even if he wouldn’t care enough to cover his tracks. Like for example he would sign that he’d administered medication and leave the unopened medication bag in its container (these bags are marked by date and time). For others, he would have administered the wrong medication and then lied about it. 

- He has badmouthed colleagues behind their backs, even when he was obviously in the wrong. For instance, he once called me during a shift just to rant that our schedule planner was “a fucking bitch.” He has also tried to bait people into badmouthing others, like senior members of staff including our unit manager. He has frequently flipflopped between asskissing people to their face and shittalking colleagues behind their back, oblivious to how it makes him appear. 

- He has tried to form fake ‘alliances’ at work, like insisting on being “girlfriends” with the female staff, and according to some quickly expected them to share inappropriate gossip (e.g., about the male/female anatomy of coworkers). Most of the women are irked by his clingy weird behavior, choices of uncomfortable subjects and how he would try to monopolize their time in a way that distracts from work. 

- His whole persona feels incredibly forced. I have nothing against LGBT people — some of our best coworkers are, including a trans guy and a bisexual woman — but he is exaggeratedly nonconforming and deflects much of work-related feedback as “homophobia”, even against said LGBT individuals. This behavior extends to how he behaves around our clients. 

- He has a bizarre inability to stay on topic. I constantly have to ask him to stop rambling and focus on what he is trying to say instead of giving me unrelated vague information. Other than that, he has been very exaggerated in how he speaks, in a way that takes focus away from the information and put more focus on the performance he is trying to put on. 

- He acts arrogant and condescending toward coworkers — even belittling their work experience — despite only having been there for a few shifts. At one point, he even took issue with me for caring about our clients’ health and wellbeing, saying, *“You’ve only, like, worked here for 8 months.”* 

- It’s not confirmed, but it’s been said by several people that somebody has messed with their food in the relevant time spans. There were rumors and allegations inconsistently thrown around, which seemed to originate from him. It’s sus. 

- He doesn’t seem at all bothered by his lack of performance. Instead, he weirdly seemed to get a kick out of the trail of destruction he’s left and how upset it makes people, and the attention it brings. He acts excited and gets this almost aggressive expression on his face. Unnerving. 

- Today, he’s been lashing out at several people including myself, yelling over the phones with personal attacks and unfounded accusations. I put the phone on speaker mode so my boss and scheduler could hear his behavior. 

- Today, he wanted to put on thick winter clothes on an old lady with severe dementia who tends to say ”I’m freezing” regardless if it’s hot or cold — because she can no longer express herself. It’s around 32 degrees Celsius over here (or 90 degrees in Freedom units). He just doesn’t have the judgment. I explained the situation and pointed out that it’s way too hot, as did her son, but he insisted that she was to use “fabulous” winter clothing while directing insults at my competence. I don’t want to risk the health of my frail patients. 

I’ve taken it up with management, an RN and a DN because I viewed it as wholly inappropriate to give him more shifts considering his erratic behavior and to risk the health of our patients. My other coworkers has corroborated most of what I’ve mentioned and had some of their own anecdotes with him that raised red flags. 

He’s still here though, weeks later, scheduled for more shifts. 

It also shows to me that management probably missed to ask the right questions during the hiring process. 

*(Like for example, the guy is 18. According to my country’s laws, a person can only work in a care profession if they’re 18 — yet he claimed to have already worked in the care profession for over a year. I know we’re understaffed and they probably let it slide, but this should’ve raised some concerns!)* 

I feel stuck working with this deranged individual who shouldn’t even be here, and I just want him gone. He’s not been the only temp who’s been wholly unsustainable, and my workload has increased severely because of all the mess. Our unit has had to compensate disproportionately to the issues that a few temp workers have created. I’m not sure why he can’t just be dismissed. He’s not pulling his weight in the least, and we’d be better off understaffed than working with him. It’s really frustrating. ",1,1753210865.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I'm moving into a tiny apartment soon and really want to arrange it in a way that feels cozy and homey, but without repeating some of the mistakes I made in my last place.

In my previous apartment, I was constantly rearranging furniture, which got exhausting. I host movie nights pretty often, and the layout made it hard for anyone not sitting directly on the couch to get a good view of the TV. On top of that, people kept moving my furniture around, which drove me nuts.

This time, I want to be more intentional with the setup. I know the space is small, but I’d love to make the most of it. I’m mainly looking for advice on where to place key pieces like the **couch, TV, coffee table, side tables, bookshelves**, etc. Or if you think certain things should be left out altogether, I’m open to that too.

I’ve attached a not-so-great photo from the listing, but hopefully it gives you an idea of the space.

Far back is a door that is locked off to me. It will never be opened. The room to the left is the kitchen which also leads into the bedroom. the pov is from the bathroom door. and the entrance to the apartment is back right. sorry if thats confusing.

Thanks so much to anyone who responds, you’re awesome!

1m6mpeb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m6mpeb,How bad is it? and my story...,"This is an old x-ray but I am wondering, how many cavities do you see if you aren't being conservative? 
Also is this all my teeth in this X-ray, it seem like no? (I still have all my wisdom teeth) But dentist says it is all the X-rays they have.
If you're wondering why I'm asking read the long story below of my nightmare.

I am trying to alleviate my fear of dentists. After covid, and not having cavities in years and years, I had to change dentist and this new dentist said I had a bunch of cavities. This was end of 2020 start of  2021. I had the work done and I wish I had gotten second opinion. 
A year later I moved states and a new dentist wanted to basically crown all of my molars, I mean all of them. Undoing all the work I just had done.
This is when I realized maybe I shouldn't have gotten all of those fillings and such. 

A little wiser now I decided to get a second opinion and she, the new dentist, said absolutely not. She told me my new fillings are perfectly fine, except that a couple won't last long due to being on the molars and will need redo or crown eventually. 
Still at the same dentist who I like and trust, she told me I had periodontal disease and it is not reversible. I did have some deep pockets and she said she did see tiny amount of bone missing on x-ray. (Note from me: She didn't have a historical reference so I think it was based on the angle of teeth root if memory serves?) 
Anyways I told her I would try changing some habits to fix it. 
So I started using all kinds of different dental toothpastes, minerals, mouthwashes, and things, I stopped smoking cigars, and stopped drinking coffee. Cold turkey.

In a 2week follow up for different issue (repairing a filling) I asked them to measure my pockets, nearly all had gone down by 1-2 depth. A couple by 3mm. The  hygienist which took the measurement was the same one as before. She didn't even remember from the week before until I told her to look at the chart. She said ""I don't know what you are doing but I've never seen that before""
Then of course the dentist I liked there went to another office, which my insurance will not cover.
So I went to a new dentist office less than a year later. There I was measured at 2, 3, and 4mm with a couple 5mms. I know that sounds bad but
For reference at the start I had mainly 4 through 8mms, with a couple of 9mms. So this was a huge decrease in my mind. 

However the new dentist office still wanted to do  surgery for it, to close up gums tighter and I guess kill bacteria while in there? They sent the surgeon in to talk with me about it.
I told him I wanted to wait 6 more months, as they were far worse before and were getting a lot better. 
The surgeon got pissed and said ""so you are not doing surgery?"" I said I wanna wait to see if they keep getting better. He stormed out of the room and slammed the door without saying a word. Another bad experience, but he wasn't the general dentist, just the surgeon at the office.
Anyways, this new dentist which I liked a bit, had to do a cleaning one day because he didn't have a hygienist because then hygienist quit and he couldn't find a new one. 
Well he was scraping on my front two teeth for about 15 minutes, apparently trying to get a stain out. They wouldn't come out because I I learned later they're internal. Anyways his scraping put a very large scratch across the front of my tooth that I didn't have before. I noticed this and called him about it and he got very defensive saying nothing he would do could do that. It was a rough cleaning, I mean really rough especially on those front teeth as he tried to get the stains out.
Anyways I didn't feel comfortable going back to him after that, just knowing he was pissed that I had told him about that scratch.

I went to another dentist,  not long later, this dentist told me I had seven cavities.
She also wanted to remove all my wisdom teeth, because one of them was bothering me a tiny bit. (That went away after about a week. I think I had just scratched the gum around it.) When she left the room her hygienist said ""do not do it, go somewhere else"" turns out this  hygienist does not usually work in this office, she works in a more conservative office I guess (unfortunately very far away from me) She said go get a second opinion, don't get the work done.
That was my last time at a dentist, about 1.5 years ago I think, I have had too much anxiety to go back. 


It has been a nightmare, and the majority of it started from that first dentist with these x-rays I posted.
Anyways...

Recently I had a filling break and I'm going to a new dentist, in about 30minutes actually.
 My anxiety is through the roof. Are they going to tell me I need a root canal? Are the new xrays going to say I need a bunch of crowns and new fillings? 

I think a big part of my anxiety is the fact that I feel like I was lied to with these x-rays, to get a lot of dental work done that I did not need. But maybe if I wasn't lied to, and I truly had a mess in my mouth at the time, I would feel better knowing that all of these things over the last 4years didn't stem from a made up problem to make money.
I have hated and feared dentist ever since, I have crazy anxiety over going, for days ahead that increases as I get closer to the appointment.

Anyways today I am hoping they tell me I can get a gold inlay because I feel like that's going to last a lot longer on my molar then resin, and is more conservative than a crown. Although I see people saying a crown is better on here.(I have been reading a lot because I want some control at this point.... I feel like a guinea pig, the money doesn't bother me at all. Hate the appointments)


FYI, I have only ever twice had tooth pain, the wisdom tooth issue I described above that went away on its own. 
One of my molars had a high cusp actually on each side. And whenever I bet it hit that first. And that tooth eventually split so obviously I had a little bit of pain then.  That is one of my crowns and I will likely need another one on the other side because that one eventually split and right now it's a very large feeling. It makes me feel like they should have been drilled down at some point so they weren't the first thing in my mouth to hit when biting. They stood up a lot. ",1,1753210499.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

This might be a long shot, but I couldn’t stop myself from trying.

I first saw her at Srinagar Airport, Gate 5, while our flight was delayed.
She walked with grace, talking softly on the phone, occasionally smiling, and sometimes just lost in thought.
Roaming here and there, unaware of the eyes she captivated mine included.
I swear, in that moment, it felt like the chaos of the world paused,
because I had never seen a more beautiful and effortlessly elegant woman in my life.
Not just her looks though she was stunning but the way she carried herself… like poetry in motion.

Later We were both on the IndiGo flight from Srinagar to Mumbai on July 21st (8 PM departure). As we deboarded the plane and rode the coach to the arrival terminal, we kept glancing at each other  a few times our eyes met at the same time. I felt something in that moment… a mutual curiosity or maybe just a shared silence that said more than words could.

You were wearing a beautiful white chikankari kurta with blue denim, stylish earrings, and really cool glasses. You had a blue-covered iPhone too. Your sense of style was striking, but it was the vibe you carried  a calm, elegant, and a little mysterious that left an impression.

We never spoke. Maybe both of us were just a bit shy or unsure if the other felt the same. But now that we’ve gone our separate ways at Mumbai airport, I genuinely regret not saying even a simple “Hi”.

If you happen to read this, or if someone who knows you does  ,I’d just love to say hello, maybe grab a coffee someday, and hear your version of that quiet little moment.

I hate Mondays.

I'm blind and deaf and get very confused because of dementia- so every day is a Monday for me. 

I don't know what kind of parent I have. I just know that they're a big warm thing with big warm hands and I can maybe hear vibrations with my whiskers and that's why I'm able to tell when they talk? IDK. Anyway, back on topic.

My name is Garfield and I hate Mondays. More specifically, I hate waking up on Mondays. It's my job to yowl at my parent to tell them how waking up on a Monday sucks. Sometimes, I even bop them about it!

Unfortunately, my parent has taken to assaulting me! 

They pick me up.

Put me down.

And slide a plate of lasagna in front of me! 

They tell me to have my 'morning coffee' and to stop being a fat old grouch like I'm being bad?????

## Key Features Analysis

The best Turkish coffee pots combine traditional design with modern materials and features for optimal brewing.

**Material:** The choice of material significantly impacts heat distribution and durability.

Copper is a classic choice for Turkish coffee pots due to its excellent heat conductivity. Copper pots heat up quickly and evenly,allowing for precise temperature control during brewing. High-quality copper pots are typically lined with tin or stainless steel to prevent copper leaching and ensure food safety. However, copper requires more maintenance to prevent tarnishing and corrosion.Stainless steel is a more modern and durable option. It is resistant to rust and corrosion, easy to clean, and does not react with the coffee. While stainless steel does not conduct heat and also copper,quality stainless steel pots frequently enough have a thick base for even heat distribution. The material should also be food-grade to avoid any unwanted flavors or chemicals in your coffee.

**size and Capacity:** Consider your typical serving needs when selecting the appropriate size.

Turkish coffee pots come in various sizes, ranging from single-serving pots (around 2-3 ounces) to larger pots that can brew multiple cups at once (up to 12 ounces). The ideal size depends on how many people you typically brew coffee for. A smaller pot is suitable for individual use or for making coffee for two people. Larger pots are more convenient for entertaining or for households with multiple coffee drinkers.It's also important to consider the “working capacity” – the amount of liquid that can be brewed without boiling over. Filling the pot too full can lead to spills and uneven brewing.

**Handle Design and Material:** Ergonomic and heat-resistant handles enhance safety and ease of use.

The handle of a Turkish coffee pot should be both agreeable to hold and heat-resistant to prevent burns.Traditional handles are often made of wood or heat-resistant plastic. Wooden handles provide a classic look and feel, but they may require more care to maintain. Plastic handles are generally more durable and easier to clean. The handle should be securely attached to the pot and designed to provide a firm grip while pouring. The length and angle of the handle are also critically important factors to consider. A longer handle will keep your hand further away from the heat source, while a well-angled handle will make pouring easier and more precise.

**Base Design:** The base should ensure stability on your stovetop and efficient heat transfer.

The base of the Turkish coffee pot needs to be stable and compatible with your stovetop. For gas stoves,a wider base is generally more stable. for electric or induction stoves,a flat base that makes full contact with the heating element is essential for efficient heat transfer. Some Turkish coffee pots are specifically designed for induction cooktops,featuring a magnetic base that allows for rapid and even heating. The thickness of the base is also an important factor. A thicker base will distribute heat more evenly and prevent hot spots that can scorch the coffee.

Key features of the best Turkish coffee pots include:

* Durable,heat-conductive materials like copper or stainless steel
* Appropriate size and capacity for individual or group brewing
* Ergonomic and heat-resistant handle
* Stable base compatible with various stovetop types

## FAQs Section

Common questions regarding Turkish coffee pots are addressed below.

**Can Turkish coffee pots be used on induction cooktops?**
Yes, but you need to ensure the coffee pot is specifically designed for induction cooktops. Look for pots with a magnetic base, typically made of stainless steel with a layer of magnetic material. Standard copper pots will not work on induction cooktops unless used with an adapter plate.

**How do I clean a Turkish coffee pot?**
Wash the pot by hand with warm, soapy water after each use. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as these can damage the pot's surface. For stubborn stains, you can boil a mixture of water and vinegar in the pot for a few minutes, then scrub gently. Always dry the pot thoroughly to prevent rust or corrosion.

**What type of coffee grind is required for turkish coffee?**
Turkish coffee requires an ultra-fine grind, finer than espresso. The coffee should have a powdery consistency to ensure proper extraction and the characteristic thick, foamy texture. It is indeed best to use a dedicated Turkish coffee grinder or a high-quality burr grinder that can achieve this fine grind.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Milwaukee Brewers vs. Seattle Mariners: A Tale of Two Streaks and a Very Confused Model**

The Milwaukee Brewers, currently riding a four-game winning streak that includes a 6-0 shutout of the Mariners, are looking to continue their dominance. Meanwhile, the Seattle Mariners, fresh off two consecutive losses, are desperate to avoid becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a game to a swarm of bees (not real, but the drama feels similar). Let’s break this down with the precision of a umpire and the humor of a ballpark hot dog vendor.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real Deal?

The SportsLine Projection Model, which simulates games 10,000 times while presumably sipping lukewarm coffee, has given us decimal odds of **2.16 for the Brewers** and **1.74 for the Mariners**. Converting those to implied probabilities:

* **Brewers**: \~46.3% chance to win (1 / 2.16).
* **Mariners**: \~57.5% chance to win (1 / 1.74).

So, the model thinks the Mariners are more likely to win, despite the Brewers’ recent hot streak. Why? Let’s dig into the numbers.

**Pitching Matchup**: Jacob Misiorowski (Brewers, 4-1, 2.81 ERA) vs. Logan Gilbert (Mariners, 2-3, 3.39 ERA). On paper, Misiorowski is the better bet, but the model projects Gilbert to strike out **6.5+ batters**. That’s like a magician pulling rabbits out of hats—except the rabbits are fastballs and the hats are Mariners’ opponents.

**Offense**: The model’s top prop bets suggest the Brewers’ Christian Crawford will muster just 0.8 hits (he’s a ghost haunting the Mariners’ lineup) and Jeferson Chourio will rack up 1.7 total bases. Meanwhile, the Mariners’ Julio Rodríguez and Randy Arozarena are still lurking, like hungry piranhas in a kiddie pool.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Streaks, and Shoelaces

The Brewers’ four-game win streak is as unstoppable as a caffeinated squirrel on a trampoline. Their pitching staff has been a fortress, led by Brandon Woodruff’s 2.61 ERA. But let’s not forget: Jacob Misiorowski, their starter tonight, ha

So many people both in this sub and irl seemed genuinely concerned about my health journey, including:

❧ An old friend I briefly did improv with around 2010. She messaged to say how weird it was realizing she knew the person being interviewed by the cast, and we caught up with each other for the first time in years. 😊

❧ A new friend and escape room enthusiast who was sitting right in front of us at the show, and has invited me to do an escape room with him sometime soon!

❧ A colleague at work who heard me talking about the show and shouted, “YOU’RE **THAT** COSMO!?” 🤣

❧ A really nice person whose pronouns I failed to ask for at Brick Road Coffee, who somehow recognized me? I forgot your name, but the art gallery you mentioned running - Rocket Space - is awesome, and any Tempe locals reading this should patronize it! I’ll definitely be going back!

This has been a strange time for me since I’m generally not too comfortable with attention. (Something I learned around 2010 during my brief attempt at doing improv 😅) But the best part of all this has been realizing there are likely many more Dropout fans around us each day than we know!! 


…Oh yeah, the update! Jacob, aka Mr. Stinky Bad, gets excised next Friday!! Unsurprisingly, having Brennan stare you down and tell you he wants you to stay healthy really helps one’s motivation. I called that Friday, but the consultations and lab work needed before setting a surgery date took from then until now!! Who could’ve guessed everyone is right in telling you not to wait until after your birthday/vacation/whatever reason you have for putting it off. 🫥 Our healthcare system moves SO SLOWLY. So… yeah… Listen to your friends and loved ones (and occasionally your favorite celebrity improvers), and don’t drag your feet like I did!

But during those ten minutes, I noticed something that most others don't - in the way you talk, the way you hold yourself, and the general demeanor that you put forth. It's no surprise that many others don't pick up on it - you're *very* good at hiding what's inside. But to a trained eye and ear like my own, you couldn't be more clear about what you crave.

See, you're the type of woman most wouldn't suspect - you're fierce, stubborn, determined, liberal - and you quickly rose to a prominent leadership position at your own company. You're often the one giving orders at work or making the decisions when you're with friends and family, and you're the go-to party planner in your circle - it seems you have a desire for control and organization that simply cannot be matched.

But in those ten minutes, I knew that couldn't be more wrong.

Maybe it's my personality or my charm, possibly my confidence or abrasiveness, but while chatting with you, I didn't see that confident, stubborn, feminist that everybody says you are - I saw a woman who had trouble making eye contact with me, who couldn't help but giggle somewhat nervously, who clearly yearned and craved for something more, something different - far different from her every day life.

When we parted that night, I made a decision about your future - that you're going to be my submissive, obedient, free-use slut.

Later that week, I managed to snag your phone number from my coworker. And when I texted you, it didn't surprise me that you didn't seem to question how I got your number - instead, it seemed like you were expecting it, craving it. You couldn't be obvious about it, though - you had this feminist facade you had to keep, after all. But I knew where we were heading - I made that decision *long* ago.

So when I called and asked you to meet up for coffee at a shop near my place to discuss a business opportunity, I knew you would gladly accept. And when I told you to wear something flattering, I got the snarky response I expected - with a tone of playfulness to it, of course.

It's now around six in the evening and I'm sitting in the coffee shop wearing my favorite suit - a navy blue one with a white, button-up, long-sleeve shirt, and a blood-red tie and brown leather shoes to complete the look. The suit is tailored to fit my muscular, 6'1"" frame and broad muscles, just tight enough to show a hint of the muscles underneath. My large hand slides through my short, soft, brown hair as my blue eyes scan the scenery in front of me. I slide my hand to my rugged jaw, feeling the beginnings of a five o'clock shadow starting to form.

I open up the newspaper in front of me and take a look at the business section while I take a sip of my favorite coffee - a Caribbean blend. Served black, of course.

Each one included black coffees and chamomile tea for the evenings. 

However, I keep hearing ""dude, you need to experience a water-only fast. It's even more intense and rewarding""

I'm intrigued by the reset/cleansing aspect of prolonged fasting, where we are depriving our body of *everything* and completely shutting down the digestive system and letting autophagy *truly* roll up its' sleeves and start working.

However...I'm addicted to caffeine and I'm militant about morning coffees. I work on my computer all day and the caffeine helps me stay glued and focused. 

In other words, I want to do a prolonged water-only fast with sea salt (along with no-salt for potassium and maybe magnesium pills) and I'm looking for reassurance from those who have done it and whose brains didn't melt during work.

Today I spent three hours trying to send a food request to the state nutrition portal. The server timed out eight times. My building still runs on a patched DSL line that hooks into something resembling a modem from 2003. It whines like a dying animal every time you try to connect. Sometimes I think it is dying.

We were once the richest country in the world.

Now we’re borrowing servers from collapsed states and patching our infrastructure with leftover copper wire. Power grids are rationed. Public transport has become a myth. Roads are undriveable. Even corporations can’t upgrade anything—they can barely maintain payrolls, let alone invest in development. Inflation didn’t just break the currency—it erased any hope of future planning.

No one saves. No one builds. We all wait.

But 300 miles east, surrounded by walls of brushed titanium and AI-guided defense turrets, sits Bitcoin City.

Population: exactly 1,000,000.
Currency: sats only.
Mayor: Michael Saylor.

They don’t even speak about “money” there anymore. It’s all sats. Everything from vending machines to real estate is priced in satoshis. Thanks to the 13th-gen Lightning Network, employers pay by the second. You can literally clock in, work for 42 minutes, and get paid 11,820 sats in real time. No bank. No waiting. No inflation.

It’s not just fast—it’s beyond fast.
It’s final.
It’s truth.

They say the network is so efficient now that you could pay for a drone-delivered avocado toast in 10 milliseconds, and it would confirm before the toast hits your plate. Autonomous contracts, smart locks, AI market integrations—all built on Lightning. It’s not a city. It’s a protocol with buildings.

Meanwhile, outside the walls?

A single egg costs $75.
One gigabyte of mobile data costs $9.50.
And real meat is more myth than memory. 96% of the population now eats government-issued lab gel infused with vitamins and sedatives. Tastes like chalk and battery acid.

Inside Bitcoin City, they host “Egg Auctions” every spring. A box of twelve pasture-raised eggs just sold for 890 sats. That’s ₿0.00000890, or around $0.45 in today’s BTC terms.

Egg prices in sats keep going down every year. It’s become a meme in the city — “When Eggflip?” they joke, watching the fiat world crumble from their climate-controlled towers.

You can’t just move there.

After BTC crossed $3 million, Bitcoin City closed its gates for good. You needed 0.5 BTC to apply. Now? That’s $2.5 million—if you could even find someone to sell it to you. You can’t fake sats. You can’t inflate them. You can’t beg your way in.

Mayor Saylor’s private army — the Sovereign Guard — is larger and better equipped than most standing nations. Every soldier’s salary is pegged to time and sats. No corruption. No bureaucracy. Just mission and math.

They say the city runs like a living machine.
They say the people inside don’t even understand what “monthly paycheck” means anymore.
They say kids there don’t cry from hunger.

I haven’t seen a real bird in years.
But sometimes, when the wind shifts just right, I swear I can smell toast and coffee drifting over the walls.

Bitcoin City isn’t the future.
It was the escape hatch.

I had a really hard time tracking my progress by just ticking things off on the printed pattern. I made a few mistakes, got frustrated, and never went back to it. 

Back in June, I wondered if anyone had ever made an app that let you upload a pattern and generate a cross stitch pattern, and then with one click order everything you needed. I'm a software developer, and have been very casually thinking about trying to come up with a little side gig.

Sure enough, I found DMC's stitch-your-photo tool. I uploaded my favourite picture of my husband and I, liked what I saw, liked the price, and impulse ordered it. I found the Pattern Keeper app, and it's been \*amazing\*. Fastest I've ever paid for a premium app. The developer did a great job with it. I just wish it had, like, more detailed stats, like average # of stitches per day, estimated completion time, streak tracker, things like that.

I'm a bit of a clumsy goose, and of course I spilled some coffee on the fabric. Hopefully you don't notice that when I stitch in the background.... which is going to be boring. It's all white. 

That being said, I've made great progress and I'm really proud! The faces took a long time, but it's been going a lot faster on our shirts, which have a lot less detail.

But my tiredness is overshadowed by something else, but I can't really put it into words. Excitement? Happiness? Fear? 

I'm pulled out of my trance when I see the coffee shop sign in the distance. I reach into my bag, fumbling after my pocket mirror. The mirror snaps open and I lock eyes with my reflection. 

I look tired, to no ones surprise, but otherwise I'm fine with how I look. My hair isn't messy, and my makeup looks just like I want it, subtle but strong enough to hide how empty I am. As I get closer and closer I see her. 

She waves, and I wave back. No backing out now, I think quietly.


Brainstorm POV: I'm standing there when suddenly I see her from afar. I wave, not expecting her to see me, but surprisingly, she waves back.

Before I know it she's right in front of me. She opens her mouth and begins speaking:
""Hey, you wanted to meet here, right?""
""Yeah, just like we said"" I stutter slightly.
""Well, now that I'm here, do you want to do anything? She sounds collected, but exhausted.
""I don't have anything specific in mind, but maybe the-"" 
""Maybe the park?"" She interrupts me.
""…Park"" I finish my sentance.

She laughs nervously, and I try to laugh along.
""Yeah, the park is great, and by the way, sorry for interrupting you earlier""
""No worries"" I sound much calmer and relaxed now.
We start walking, slowly. 


Blueprint POV: A rough 40 minutes later we sit down at a park bench, looking over the lake in the parks center.
""So, do you have any, like hobbies?"" I ask her.
She doesn't say anything first, but then her mouth opens, and she starts talking:
""I'm learning, or trying to learn drawing. But I suck anyways so that's probably not worth it anyways""
""Don't say that, you are probably great"" My response is also mildly delayed.

She looks out over the lake, the setting sun reflecting in her eyes. I think about saying something, but we just sit there, in our own silence. Eventually she starts talking again:
""Well, what about you, do you do anything?""
I don't really, but I don't say that, instead I say:
""Well, I… I read. Like books and stuff"" I realize how stupid I sound, but she doesn't seem to care. 
""Cool"" She says.

That night we don't go home until almost midnight. And that night, I feel happy for once.

1m6m0ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Solopreneur2Brand/comments/1m6m0ta/the_real_tech_problems_small_businesses_actually/,The Real Tech Problems Small Businesses Actually Deal With (And How to Fix Them),"If you Google “tech challenges for small business,” you’ll get a million hits about cybersecurity, “digital transformation,” and leveraging AI. You’d think every local bakery is one phishing email away from collapse, or that the reason your handmade soap isn’t selling is because you haven’t “embraced machine learning.”

Give me a break.

Let’s talk about the actual tech headaches real small businesses in the US face stuff that happens every day, and nobody with a podcast is talking about.



**1. “I Have No Idea How to Update My Website”**

Confession time: Most business owners have no idea how to change their own website.

You paid someone’s cousin’s friend to build it three years ago. You forgot the login, and now your “special offer 2022” is still up for the world to see. It’s embarrassing, but you’re not alone.

*What you actually need:*

A site you can update yourself, in five minutes, from your phone, before your coffee even cools off. No jargon. No 15-step tutorials.



**2. “Why Do I Need So Many Logins?!”**

Modern business tools are like Pokémon every week there’s a new one, and you’re expected to “catch them all.”

You’ve got one app for invoices, another for email, another for social, another for customer notes… and of course, each one requires its own login, password, and verification code. Forget “digital transformation” what about digital exhaustion?

*What you actually need:*

One dashboard. One login. One place to manage it all. Not an “all-in-one” with so many features you get lost, but something focused on what you actually use.



**3. “Should I Be On TikTok? Instagram? Is Facebook Dead?”**

Every month, the “essential” platform changes. You’re told if you’re not doing short-form video, you’re losing customers. But you don’t have time to be a full-time influencer you’re running a business.

*What you actually need:*

A place online you own. Social is nice, but if Instagram changes the algorithm (again), you still have your own website your digital home base.



**4. “My Website Looks Awful On My Phone”**

Guess what? Most of your customers are browsing on their phones.

If your website loads like a 1999 Geocities page tiny text, buttons the size of Tic Tacs people will leave, fast. But you don’t have a design team or an iPhone 18 for testing.

*What you actually need:*

A site builder that’s mobile-first, not desktop-then-shrunk. Something that shows you exactly what customers see.



**5. “Why Does Adding a Product Take 12 Steps?”**

E-commerce should be easy. But most platforms are built for stores with hundreds of products.

You just want to sell three things this week not spend an hour fiddling with “SKU categories” and “inventory management” you’ll never use.

*What you actually need:*

A dead-simple “add product, set price, publish” flow. Done.



**6. “What If Something Breaks?”**

The nightmare scenario: Something goes wrong, and you have no idea how to fix it. The developer is MIA. The “help” docs might as well be in Klingon.

You’re stuck.

*What you actually need:*

Real, human support. And a platform that doesn’t break every time you try to update your opening hours.



**Why No One Talks About These Problems**

Because they’re not sexy. There’s no TED talk about “help, my menu page won’t update.”

But these are the day-to-day issues that actually slow small businesses down, waste money, and kill momentum.



**How Forxample Makes This Better**

This is literally why we built [Forxample](https://www.forxample.com/):

* You can update your site from your phone, in seconds
* One login, one dashboard no juggling
* Your site is mobile-friendly, always
* Selling stuff is as easy as posting on Instagram
* And if you’re stuck? Actual humans will help

Because tech should make things simpler, not more stressful.



**TL;DR:**

Most small business tech problems are not “digital transformation” level they’re just basic, human stuff. Forget the hype. Get a platform that lets you work like a human, not a robot.

Want to talk more about tech headaches you’ve run into? Drop them here I promise, you’re not alone.

I'll be visiting the Pacific Northwest with my girlfriend next month and have put together an itinerary to make the trip as special as possible—I'll be proposing during the trip! I'm open to any suggestions or recommendations. Are there any must-dos or hidden gems I might be missing?

# Day 1 – Friday

* Land in Seattle in the morning
* Pick up a rental car and drive up to Bellingham, where we’re staying in a really cool tree house
* Stop for lunch at Taylor Shellfish Farms
* Might do a short hike or just walk around Bellingham, maybe grab a drink
* Planning to do takeout from Tam Tam Pizza and enjoy it back at the tree house—wine, hot tub, and relaxing with the view

# Day 2 (Proposal Day!) – Saturday

* Morning coffee/breakfast—any good recommendations around Anacortes?
* Head to Anacortes to catch the ferry to Orcas Island (staying there Saturday and Sunday nights)
* I don’t have a ferry reservation yet but have reminders set for when more spots open (2 weeks and 1–2 days ahead)
* Likely hiking Mount Constitution (we’re from Colorado and love a good hike!)
* Food stop at Buck Bay Shellfish Farm or Harbor Bar and Grill
* Check into the hotel in town
* **Proposal time!** I hired a photographer based on the island’s recommendation—he suggested sunset at West Beach, but also mentioned we could do something earlier in the forest or another scenic spot. Sunset is around 8:20pm, which feels a bit late—would love advice here.
   * Should I propose before dinner or after?
   * Any other **intimate and beautiful proposal spots** on Orcas Island you’d recommend?

# Day 3 – Sunday

* Breakfast in town
* Visit to **Orcas Island Winery**
* Orca boat tour at 3pm
* Dinner afterward

I’d love suggestions on:

* Any hidden gem food spots, hikes, or experiences
* Where and **when** to propose for the best experience
* Whether dinner before or after the proposal makes more sense (specially with late proposal)
* Anything I'm overlooking!

Thanks in advance for any ideas. I really want to make this weekend special and memorable!

Context/disclaimer: It was myself, my husband, and our 7 month baby. We were desperate for a no worries vacation and would’ve been happy with pretty much anything, but we do travel a lot and appreciate a good hotel experience. It was however our very first AI, so hopefully this an objective review but we have little to compare it to. 

Overall we had an incredible experience and loved the resort. We did stay in the preferred suites which seemed to make a difference in some things. There were some inconsistencies with service and food, but I would say in general everything was great and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay again. 

Service: Overall great. The check in process/arrival was smooth & we were greeted with lots of friendly faces and welcome drinks. Every bartender we interacted with during our stay was amazing. The servers were great, but there were a few who really went above and beyond, some of the others were noticeably slow and it sometimes took a long time to get our drinks. We found ourselves trying to sit in certain sections at the pool and restaurants to get a specific server. Everyone did an awesome job making sure we had what we needed for our baby & even making her special plates of food. 

Food: Again, overall great. I have food allergies and the restaurants menus were well marked, the servers did an incredible job communicating and accommodating my needs. The buffet was a little harder, but they did have everything marked, and I’m sure it could’ve been better if I took the time to ask more questions, just was somewhat difficult with a baby. For the most part, everything we had was good. Some of it was amazing. There were definitely some inconsistencies day to day on specific dishes, which was admittedly disappointing but not the end of the world. Room service was less good, we definitely got some things that were not worth eating, but it was convenient for us during naptimes.

Accommodation: We stayed in a preferred suite and absolutely loved it. The room was spacious and well stocked with drinks & coffee every day. Housekeeping was super responsive to any requests and allowed us to schedule around our baby’s schedule. The preferred tower is super conveniently located to the buffet, pools, beach, and some restaurants. There is a water park and a few other places to eat on the opposite side of the resort. For us, the location was well worth it. For a family with bigger kids that want to spend more time at the water park, the preferred rooms would be quite the walk back and forth, but then that would also be quite the walk to the buffet which is the only full breakfast option. 

Resort Overall: The grounds were beautiful, well maintained and very clean with great views all around. It definitely seems like a smaller resort but it wasn’t super crowded and we never had problems finding a spot when we needed to! Something that’s not super obvious online is that Dreams is attached to Secrets here, it’s literally the same building. It is obviously separated and well marked, so it didn’t matter for us. However, if you are looking for a “I don’t even want to see kids” adults only experience, this would definitely not be the place for you as there are definitely some main areas that are shared.

I’ve been testing out countless detergents over the years, but this one has quickly earned a top spot on my shelf. Between its impressive cleaning power, the intoxicating original scent, and the hefty 107-load volume, it stands out as a strong contender in the laundry detergent market.

**Long-Lasting Scent That Lingers**  
One of the first things I noticed was the fragrance. The original scent feels crisp, refreshing, and clean without being too overpowering. What truly blew me away is how this scent actually sticks around. Clothes come out of the washer smelling amazing, and the scent still lingers even weeks after putting them in the closet. I didn’t believe the claim about it lasting up to six weeks until I experienced it firsthand. And honestly, it makes the act of folding laundry a little less dreadful when your clothes smell that good.

**Great Cleaning Power**  
While testing the cleaning power, I threw in everything from muddy kid clothes to coffee-stained shirts, and this liquid detergent handled it all with ease—even in cold water. Its combination of Febreze and Oxi Boost seems to annihilate both tough stains and stubborn odors. I didn’t need to rewash any clothes or use additional boosters, which was a pleasant surprise.

**Phosphate-Free and Machine Compatibility**  
Another perk is that this detergent is phosphate-free, which felt like a nice bonus for environmentally-conscious users like myself. Whether I tested it on my high-efficiency washer or my neighbor’s standard model (don’t ask why I ended up there), it worked seamlessly. Plus, the effectiveness even with cold water usage saved on my energy bills.

**Large Quantity Convenient for Families**  
As a parent running what feels like an industrial laundry operation most weeks, I found the massive 154 fl oz bottle incredibly practical. Knowing I can get 107 loads from this one container reduced my need for constant refilling. The generous size feels like it was made for large families or anyone who does mountains of laundry regularly. Lugging the hefty bottle was worth it since I didn’t need to worry about running out mid-week.

**Benefits**  
- Long-lasting original scent that can last for weeks.  
- Powerful stain and odor removal, even for tricky laundry issues.  
- Works perfectly in both HE and standard washers.  
- Effective performance, even in cold water, to save energy.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The large bottle can sometimes feel unwieldy to pour, especially for those with weaker wrists.  
- While the fragrance is lovely, some may find it heavy if they prefer less scented options.  
- No measuring cap attached to the bottle; I had to rely on an old one.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at other options such as Tide Original or Arm & Hammer’s OxiClean detergent, it becomes clear that they all hold similar appeal but stand apart in unique ways. Tide is excellent at tackling particularly stubborn stains quickly, but the scent doesn’t linger as long. Arm & Hammer prides itself on affordability, which is great, but the cleaning power, especially on smells, doesn’t quite match this detergent’s Febreze-enhanced formula. Gain’s combination of cleaning ability, unmatched fragrance retention, and massive quantity puts it ahead of these competitors in my opinion.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Comparing the Gain detergent with alternatives in the same category, this product feels like a well-balanced option regarding quality and cost. It’s not the absolute cheapest out there, but it justifies its cost with its significant advantages—especially the long-lasting freshness and stain-fighting potency. For families or individuals doing laundry regularly, it provides both convenience and efficiency without feeling like you’re breaking the bank.

 **Material Composition:** The core of any great hoodie lies in its fabric.Models leading the pack in 2025 feature a blend of organic cotton and recycled polyester. This combination not only feels incredibly soft against the skin but also reduces the environmental impact of production.The organic cotton provides breathability, while the recycled polyester adds durability and helps to resist stretching or shrinking after washing. A typical blend consists of 70% organic cotton and 30% recycled polyester, offering the optimal balance of comfort and longevity.

 **Advanced Weave Technology:** Beyond the materials themselves, the weave technology employed plays a critical role. The top G West Hoodies utilize a unique double-knit construction. This involves knitting two layers of fabric together, creating a denser, more resilient material that drapes beautifully and provides added warmth without sacrificing breathability.

1m6lvlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m6lvlk/discover_if_furologee_kitchen_bakers_rack_br006c/,Discover if Furologee Kitchen Bakers Rack BR006-C Lives Up to Its Reviews,"Testing a product like the Furologee BR006-C Kitchen Baker's Rack with Power Outlets was an interesting experience, as this piece combines storage functionality with some surprising features. My kitchen isn’t huge, so I'm always looking for versatile solutions that maximize space while being practical. This baker's rack promises more than just a standard storage unit, and after a few weeks of putting it through its paces, I’ve got a lot to share about its strengths and, admittedly, a few notable quirks.

**Design and Appearance**  
The rustic brown finish immediately caught my eye. It fits right into my kitchen's warm and earthy tones, blending seamlessly with the rest of the decor. Although lightweight at around 18.72 pounds, the combination of metal and particleboard feels surprisingly sturdy. The metal pegboard with six S-hooks at the top comes in handy for organizing items like mugs and utensils, but the hooks could have been slightly larger for heavier handles. The overall design is compact with dimensions of 14.6” D x 21.65” W x 49.6” H—ideal for small kitchens like mine. However, I noticed that the floor mount feels a tad unstable if placed on uneven tiles, although the adjustable feet help alleviate this.

**Highlights**  
- Multiple tiers of storage enhance usability.  
- Equipped with two power outlets and a convenient air switch button.  
- Stylish look suits kitchens, living rooms, or even balconies.  

[Check Furologee BR006-C price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0cqc7lcmw/)  

**Performance and Usability**  
Day one, I tested the power outlets by plugging in my microwave, and it worked flawlessly. No need to awkwardly stretch appliances to far-off outlets, making routine tasks a lot easier. I experimented by switching between the left and right sides of the rack where the outlet is installed—it’s reversible, which is a thoughtful touch. The shelves are well-spaced for specific uses. I placed my coffee maker on the second tier and still had ample room for jars and containers on the others. The pegboard was fantastic for organizing oft-used tools, although it seemed to lack space for anything larger than standard kitchen necessities.

**Merits**  
- Adjustable foot pads prevent scratches and improve stability.  
- Pegboard and S-hooks add incredible storage value.  
- Ample space for diverse needs—from a microwave to coffee mugs.  
- Easy to assemble with detailed instructions and labeled parts.  

**Downsides**  
- The hooks on the pegboard aren’t ideal for heavy or wide-handled items.  
- Stability becomes an issue on uneven flooring despite the adjustable feet.  

**Construction and Durability**  
If there’s one thing I noticed immediately, it’s the use of P2 particleboard and metal for durability. While it won't withstand excessive weight or heavy impacts, it’s more than enough for day-to-day use in the kitchen. The two X-shape metal frames on each side are designed for extra reinforcement, ensuring it doesn’t wobble during use. Over several days of stacking bottles, pots, and a moderately heavy microwave, it held up without any trouble. That said, I wouldn’t recommend pushing its weight capacity to the max—it’s sturdy, not indestructible.

**Ease of Assembly**  
Assembly was as smooth as the description promised. It came with detailed instructions and neatly labeled parts. I’m not exactly the most patient person when it comes to putting furniture together, but this took me only about an hour to install by myself. No missing parts either! The tools included aren’t premium quality, but they’re sufficient for lightweight assembly.

**Drawbacks**  
- Hooks lack versatility for varying kitchen gear.  
- The baker’s rack doesn’t feel premium in construction materials, though they suffice for casual use.  
- Larger appliances may crowd out the other shelves.  

**Challengers**  
I compared this baker's rack against some popular competitors, like a similar option from Mr. Ironstone. That model offers sturdier materials and slightly more shelf space. However, it lacks the built-in power outlets, which turned out to be a real lifesaver with this Furologee piece. Another contender, the SONGMICS Baker’s Rack, feels more premium in construction and comes with slightly larger dimensions, but it doesn’t feature the pegboard or the chic rustic finish this one has. If looks and convenience matter more to you, the Furologee rack has a clear advantage.

**Financial Value**  
The baker's rack sits in a sweet spot when it comes to value proposition. It’s obviously not crafted from high-end materials but delivers just enough durability to meet its intended purpose. When I factored in its multipurpose nature—being a coffee bar, kitchen storage, and even a potential living room shelf—it felt like a worthy investment. Of course, if you’re someone who needs a truly heavy-duty unit, there are alternatives in higher price brackets to consider.

Since then i’ve had more and more concerns which make me not want to be here . Firstly the drinking, his bin is full to the brim of cans of lager , i witness my dad come home with crates and he’s even resorted to stealing my partners “treat” beer . ( my partner doesn’t drink but bought himself a polish beer) . He also necked half empty bottles of cider from when my in laws visited and brought drinks ??? Secondly , as part of us moving we pay rent , almost all of his monthly rent (he pays £675 we pay £600 ) now i wasn’t bothered at this at all until other people pointed it out to me how wrong it was . Also , i feel like he’s using us , to say thank you , me and my partner have been doing up his house , lino to replace the cracked kitchen tiles , painted everywhere , laminate etc . Take in mind , his house is dilapitated , had i known it was this bad we would have stayed renting our apartment . When we first moved in there was glass covering the back garden , i had to clear this all up by hand so it was safe for my son . His upstairs sink is cracked like the full unit , the dust is that bad it’s crystalising . All while we’re fixing all these things and i’ve not heard a single thank you come from him .  His back garden is unsafe , half the wall came down last year and he’s not bothered to contact the landlord to get it fixed .He gets a meal when he gets in , i clean the house he ends up leaving it a state , and im not meaning a bit of mess , but filth . Empty cans , coffee granules and tobacco covering the kitchen surface , cig butts just left out in the open . it was a kick in the arse when he suggested we buy him for his house and electric fireplace but the biggest kick in arse came today. The carbon monoxide alarm went off at 6 am . I’m a hypochondriac about carbon monoxide , so woke my son up got us outside and let my dad know i was ringing the gas emergency hotline just in case . I knew it was most likely a fault but with a little boy i didn’t want to take a chance . My dad told me not to ring anyone he’ll look at it when he gets home , but why would i want to take that chance ? So they came everything was fine i let my dad know they’ve just capped the gas so someone can check it wasn’t the appliances . Since then he has been horrible , condescending about how it’s stupid to think it could be a carbon monoxide leak when the alarms going off , how he works with gas and knows that c0 is heavy , arguing the toss about the semantics of carbon monoxide and how it couldn’t spread ?? Nastily making remarks about the gasman’s credentials , and even had the audacity to tell me to go out and buy a new co alarm ? I’ve never felt so belittled over taking a precaution , he screamed at me that he had to pay out of pocket to get it uncapped (which he doesn’t ?) and is still arguing the toss with me about the bloody semantics of carbon monoxide . I’ve literally been sat in my room crying for hours at how nasty he’s been , asked him to apologise for giving me wrong advice when i did the right think at a potential co leak and he’s just doubled down saying he’s right , no apology , more condescension . There’s a few little things aswell , him leaving dangerous objects out , critiscizing the food i’ve made him , letting my little boy play with what he wants when i’ve asked him to watch him while i nip to the toilet (beer bottles , coffee granules , gravy granules ?? ) and it’s me that has to clean it all up . We’ve only been here a month and my mental health is at an all time low . On too the advice , if we move we won’t be able to save for a deposit for a mortgage , we don’t even have a deposit to rent right now as we spent all the money moving and doing his house up . We can’t rent through an estate agents because my partner has horrendous credit and i’m currently out of work to save on nursery fees . (i was going back into full time employment in september , mortgage was going into my name solely.) I’ve got horrendous guilt if we leave , everyone’s been telling me that if it wasn’t for me my dad probably would have self exited and that if i leave i need to take him with me ? I’m just stuck , it’s not a stable environment for my son , my dad needs help but i’m not mentally sound myself and cannot bear his burdens . I just feel awful about the whole thing , i’m miserable being here but feel this huge weight of responsibility for my dad , want to move out but am stuck here with a toddler and my fiancée .

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Kansas City Royals vs. Chicago Cubs: A Same-Game Parlay Breakdown**  
*Where pitching meets punchlines and spreads meet slapstick.*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Let’s start with the cold, hard cash of statistics. The **Chicago Cubs** (-150) are the clear favorites here, with moneyline odds hovering around **1.4 to 1.43** (implied probability: \~58-59%). The **Royals** (+290 to +307) are the long shot, implying a **26-34% chance** to pull off an upset. The spread is a tight **Cubs -1.5** (-110 to -115), suggesting bookmakers expect a narrow victory. The total is set at **9 runs**, with the **Under** priced slightly better (1.83-1.88), hinting at a pitcher’s duel.

Key stats:

* **Cubs’ offense**: Second-best slugging percentage (.447) in MLB. They don’t just hit—they *slam-dunk* baseballs into orbit.
* **Royals’ pitching**: A 3.50 ERA (2nd in MLB) and a 1.218 WHIP (6th-lowest) mean their staff is as leak-proof as a coffee thermos.
* **Matthew Boyd (Cubs)**: 2.34 ERA, 102 strikeouts in 111⅓ IP. He’s the human equivalent of a “Do Not Disturb” sign for opposing hitters.
* **Richard Hill (Royals)**: Making his **first start of the season**. Nerves? Expectations? The pressure’s like trying to parallel park a semi-truck in a Prius lot.

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Updates, and Why Hill’s First Start is a Plot Twist

The Cubs are as healthy as a vegan at a buffet. Matthew Boyd has been aces, and their lineup? A .447 SLG suggests they’re not just hitting singles and apologies. The Royals, meanwhile, are banking on their pitching staff’s consistency… but Richard Hill? First-time starter alert! It’s like asking a toddler to solve a Rubik’s Cube: theoretically possible, but don’t bet on it.

No major injury reports here, but let’s not for

1m6ltlu,https://i.redd.it/psiqd7i8wgef1.png,is anyone else creating AI ads?,"with advancements on AI from all companies, how are you creating ads? looks like no more paying someone $250 for a static ad image, they should all fix their pricing since we can do ads manually within 30 seconds.  
  
It was Friday 4 pm client emails “can we get new ad images by Monday?”— and budget for a designer = $0. I opened Invisioned (10-buck AI chatbot thing i’ve been messing with) and tried this:

\*\*Get your seed creatives straights from twitter! thats where all the elite designers are at!!!\*\*

1. Jumped on twitter and searched “sun-bleached texture” filter:images. snagged 2 gritty backgrounds.
2. Dropped both into the Image-Gen agent w/ prompt: “overlay bold coffee cup + steam, keep grainy vibe.” Got 3 solid creatives in 40 sec.
3. Quick pass in Canva for price tag + CTA. End-to-end maybe 15 min.

Launched the ads, ROAS is still early but CTR is already beating the old static by \~18 %. Lesson: before you panic-hire on Fiverr, squeeze the robots first 😂",0,1753208554.0,AdPorn,1,0.21,False

So it came set on 5 and I've been reading a few threads on here about it and tbh it's a minefield and im still none the wiser. I like my coffee between medium and strong If there is such a thing but just don't like it weak. I'm a complete novice to these machines as all I've ever had are nespressos. So any tips are greatly appreciated. 

Also from what I've read it depends on the beans ?. I bought these beans to get started . I usually have an americano in the mornings and a cappuccino in the afternoon.",3,1753208360.0,superautomatic,5,0.81,False

I'm about to be be 21 in a few days, and being really honest it's just me and my bf here, and as much as it's totally ok it kinda feels a little lonely at the same time... 
don't get me wrong he gives me plenty of love, but I feel like after moving to a different part of the world with him, and kind of leaving everything behind, I feel lonely? 

Theres girlhood missing if there's any sense into this, sometimes I go and try to show my drawings or the stuff that im interested in, I try to get some gossip from him or something but it doesn't feel the same... is anyone feeling the same??? I can't be the only one...

It might be a curse like, hey if you settle with someone you love when you are young you'll find yourself friendless type shit 

I found myself overthinking the fact that I have 0 social reasons to make friends, I don't work, I don't study, I mostly stay at home and do my own thing and at some point all I think of is my girls and how bad I would love to have them here, cause social media is nothing when you literally have a 12h gap between you and them... 

How are we even supposed to make friends nowadays? 
And don't get me wrong but Dunedin is such a dead city to my eyes... I don't drink and I prefer to stay out of noisy spaces due to the fact that one of my ears popped a few years ago, so like do I even really fit in here ,-, 

I want to meet some cool girls and go out for coffee, and have some life again, but it just feels impossible..

It feels extra hard, cause I've been here for a year and besides my bf and my landlord I know a total of 0 people and that is fk depressing 💀✊ 

So ye bitches, I might as well just fill an application at this point and wait for any girly to adopt me 🙂‍↕️✊ jkjk 

But hey, I can't be the only one frfr 💀🫴 
Laughs aside it's cool to speak it out ✨

Now that I’m using it almost daily, I checked out their accessories page and saw options like the double shot basket, capsule adapters, the protective travel case, and even some extras like a coffee scale and vacuum canister. 

Trying to decide what’s actually worth getting next especially for someone who travels a lot and wants to keep the setup efficient but complete.

1m6lmvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1m6lmvm/trying_biphasic_sleep/,Trying Biphasic Sleep?,"so i am so tired after i come back from work at around 5 at the end of the day, that i often come home and sleep for a few hours. then i wake up and go late to bed like 2 in the night, to wake up again at 9 in the morning

i notice that if i go to sleep at 12 in the night and wake up at 9 or even 8 in the morning, that i have huge trouble staying productive the whole day. i have trouble keeping my self productive and awake at the last few hours of work. 

Advantages i can think of:
- im a night owl, so i can go to sleep later. This also aligns very well with the weekends, often friends come and we play like until 2 to 4 in the night. so doing all of this means my sleep schedule in the weekend and the work week stays more consistent
- I no longer feel extremely tired at the end of the day, and have no trouble staying awake once i get home.
- I have more energy during the day, and feel well more rested.
- It Feels more natural to me
- I have a lot more energy in the night time to do stuff at home

the only disadvantage is that i take a bit longer to wake up.

so, basically how i now kinda do it and plan to keep doing

- wake up at 9 in the morning
- go to work a hour later
- then, i come home at around 5 to 6 at the end of the day
- then i sleep for x hours. this can be 2, and also a max of 4. i set my clock to allow a max of 4 hours sleep to prevent over sleeping. i try to naturally wake up, but if i am so exhausted, i allow myself a max of 4 hours
- then, around 9 to 10, i get up, take some coffee since i need it to wake up my reptile brain, i make some food, watch some TV and play some games
- around 2 to 3 in the night, i go back to sleep again.
- wake up at 9 in the morning and rinse and repeat.

sleeping in one single go and staying awake and productive is impossible for me.
