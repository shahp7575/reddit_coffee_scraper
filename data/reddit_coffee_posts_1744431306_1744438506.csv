1jxas8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jxas8e/asking_about_coffee_mills_im_a_newbie/,Asking about coffee mills - I‚Äôm a newbie,"I am new to the pour over coffee and have started brewing 2 months ago, at work I have joined a coffee club where they buy different coffee beans for the members to taste. When asked what mill I used and I mentioned I was using a spice blender I was looked at in a bit of disdain. 

Now I have 4 exciting types of coffee to taste and i dont dare spoil them in my spice blender. So what are some good coffee mills both manual or electric below 120$?

Thank you from the spice blender newbie",1,1744438463.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

We don't need to always keep chasing and chasing

Sometimes you gotta pick a side and stick to it 

I know my body and my mind and I know too much stress or too many changes or too many to - do's is definitely gonna give me anxiety and make me fumble

I can definitely push myself and by hook or crook do it

But I choose to be a bit laid back and stay in my comfort zone and push it slowly and steadily at my own pace 

The first position can be taken by only one person 

Instead of running a marathon, I some times wanna take a detour and be spontaneous, even if it is going to a coffee shop and just sitting in silence. I love that. Being by myself at present. ",1,1744438123.0,u_Chaltahaikoinahi,0,1.0,False
1jxap4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1jxap4p/23f_im_confused_situationship_or_fubu_hewlp/,"23F i‚Äôm confused, situationship or fubu? Hewlp","Problem/Goal: Is it leading to situationship because, he keeps me posted 24/7. He kissed me sa noo and lips when we parted ways or every-time na mag kikita kami. Also, he managed to hatid sundo ako from apartment ko to terminal ng jeep so wala akong hassle sa pag uwi ko sa province namin every weekend even it would cost him additional 2 hours sa pag uwi nya. But, one thing I noticed he seems excited kapag mag checheck in kami and super clingy after that I always felt na nawawala yung pagiging clingy. Which made me think, maybe he‚Äôs a only looking for fubu? AHHH I‚Äôm so confused talaga. Enlighten me guys :< 

Plus. It‚Äôs been months yet I haven‚Äôt received any I love you. Or am I expecting it too early? 

Context: 

I‚Äôm a 23F single, I met someone at work 30M. At first crush ko lang sya as he is someone who has this very bad boy look na type na type ko. So every-time na pupunta sya ng office I would stare at him from afar and admire him. I have no intention at all to talk to him since happy crush lang naman ito. So my admiration was on going for 3 months na when suddenly last January 15, he followed me via IG and he kept liking my stories. I was confused at first kase as far as I know he never looked at me, so how come na he knows me and followed my social media accounts. Fast forward, we talked as he reached out to me, syempre as a girly na crushie sya na surprise ako since his personality were different from what I actually expected. We hang out for the first time after 3 days talking, it was just coffee and chismis sinundo nya ako from my apartment and we end up talking until 2am then hinatid nya ako pauwi. So after that night, the admiration grow kase we clicked, considering our age gap. 

Up to this day, we‚Äôre still talking but the thing is, may nangyare na samin twice. Now can you guys help me if this is leading to situationship or fubu? Because I have never been into one prior to this guy. All I have were serious relationships that last for 1-2 years.

1jxap1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/fabricmc/comments/1jxap1b/custom_modpack_server_crash_exception_ticking/,Custom Modpack server crash (exception ticking world),"Sorry to bother anyone with this, I have a server up for my friends, where we're using a mix of Cobblemon related mods, Farmer's Delight, Better End, Biomes O'Plenty/Oh The Biomes We've Gone, and Eternal Starlight among some other odds and ends (something for everyone's needs). It's been running fine for well over a week now but it seems that something's now causing it to close and restart. I'm not sure what's causing it, and even more so how to fix it. I'd say it's due to my building a better spawn but it was just fine when I finished it yesterday. 

I first noticed it when I went fishing, but it's still happening even if I stay still. I'm the only one on the server at this time of night. It's about 20 minutes in between crashes. Any help would be greatly appreciated, and if any other information is needed I'll be happy to provide.

The brown leather sofa, the star of the space, invites you to sink into its soft embrace with its vintage lines and inviting warmth. The combination of wooden furniture and green plants fills the room with a natural aura, as if the sunlight filtering through the blinds has cast a soft glow over everything.The small framed pictures on the wall and the books on the shelf tell stories of the owner‚Äôs taste and memories. A book, a cup of coffee, and a bouquet of flowers‚Äîthese simple elements weave together to create a sense of everyday happiness. The pendant light and chairs around the dining table add a touch of warmth and ceremony, as if every meal is a conversation with oneself.This home is more than just a living space; it‚Äôs a sanctuary for the soul. Here, time seems to slow down, and life‚Äôs rhythm becomes gentle and healing.

So grateful for this subreddit as I‚Äôve learned so much.

I cut out coffee & chocolate and all spicy foods. I also cut out high fat dairy and switched to low fat or dairy alternatives.
I sleep with my head elevated and on my left side, I started taking daily walks & doing my best to lower stress levels. 

I take one Pepcid daily. Half in the morning and half before dinner. I also take 1 Zyrtec daily (adding this helped tremendously)
I was diagnosed with stage 4 TMJ last week, so I‚Äôm hoping treating that will give my GERD symptoms some relief or even take them away completely. I was feeling so hopeless just a month ago but making these changes has made a huge difference. ",1,1744437408.0,GERD,0,1.0,False
1jxah1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jxah1c/i_have_been_diagnosed_with_trigeminal_neuralgia/,"I have been diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia, and I don't care at all","So for the past 7 weeks, I have been having a headache that was waking me up at night. At first I thought nothing of it, thinking that it would pass by and that it was caused by stress due to work. 

However, last Monday it affected me on an afternoon and the pain was so unbearable that I had to go to the hospital. 
I usually can deal with lots of pain as I have pretty good tolerance towards it, but this time it went too far. 

Long story short, the diagnosis of the ""suicide disease"" as it was called in the past was positive, and now I have to take more pills for the rest of my life, as it can be treated but not cured. 

Why do I say that I don't care?

Since I am 24 years old;
- I have fought against chronic depression (my family is genetically sensible to it);
- I am dealing with alcoholism - some downfalls took place since then, but I have been able to recover;
- While skiing, I dislocated my L5 vertebrae, that is pinching my sciatic nerve and thus, have occasional sciatica symptoms;
- Got in a fight once and my supraorbital nerve on my left side is cut and my sensibility at that side of the head is off;
- Got a cut on my pinky finger, where the tendon, nerve and arteria got sliced - I cannot fully extend or contract it, and sometimes I miss the control/shift/alt keys as I cannot feel the pressure or relief. 

I am 32 years old at this time and I am overall satisfied with my life. I have become an IT engineer (sysadmin, networking) in 10 months of hard work (knowing nothing of it when I started), I am in pretty good health and I believe that many good things are to come.

It has come to a point where I live day by day. Some may be hard, and some may be a breeze; some may be stressing and others can be relaxing; a few can be sad, and many can be filled with joy; and some can feel lonely, and others can feel fulfilling. 

I know that many are having a much more difficult time and health issues than me, and others, on the contrary are fully healthy. But this is my current situation that affects me and I'll have to go by the ""it is what it is phylosophy"", where I can only accept what affects me, but cannot define who or what I am. 

There's always, somewhere things that you can use for your own betterment, and someone that you can lean on and at the end of the day, waking up to a nice cup of coffee to do the best that you can during the day, and going to sleep knowing that you've done your best is what counts. 

Thanks for the read, and have a great weekend. ",2,1744437195.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

Aimbots and cringe sickening electronical cues 

I am half human with a it addicted to infinite truths 

An escape that's so dense it makes all of us choose 

Oh have you found a way out of what my mind is about 

Either I'm all in and crawling or swimming in clouds 

The swirls of the milk getting turned into coffee
 
Shirley knows more than collective philosophy

Oh it's so bore when the door is economy 

Just the thought that there's more then reality

is enough to make dreams turn into memories 

Is enough to make angels sing a symphony 

Oh evolution how official you seem
 
I pray to the Buddha of infinite being 

Revolution with the sting of karmicol rings 

The sound of the sea the site of just me 

Honest and free attached to the leaves

When it is notice it all is a lotus 

Piercing through mud pushing through reads 

A bud that will blossom when the sun rises up 

Sinking in visions of mystical crud 

Destined to clean the mess of the mind 

It's got to be real the blooming out of this grime 

Words that still echo into this time 

Surely contain the fruit of the vine 

The juice of that substance that makes us all kind 

Open my eyes to more signs of divine 

These lids weighed by the normal where people decide 

Consistently choosing to sway from the light 

Disgustingly chronically flawed 

Peace is not fed by rivers of red
 
Engineered dead pumped by masters of war 

Oh evolution how official you seem 

I pray to the Buddha of infinite being 

Revolution with the sting of karmicol rings 

The sound of the sea the site of just me

This morning, I wake up and find my hair covered with my satin bonnet, a blanket wrapped around me, and my head still resting on his chest. He literally watched over me the whole night.

1jxafoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticSpouses/comments/1jxafoo/do_they_love_to_sabotage_your_efforts/,Do they love to sabotage your efforts?,"My husband always tries to sabotage my efforts. Especially when it comes to losing weight. I feel like he does it so he can constantly taunt me about my weight. 

I've been successfully losing weight and getting ready for my exit! LOL! The years of abuse made me pile on the pounds and struggle to lose any weight. He always insisted on taking me out t eat, and giving me hell if I refused to go. But now I'm taking back control and he is fighting me in every way he can. He will make nasty little digs and comments, like today we went to the supermarket and he showed me a stuffed toy of a piggy, pointed at it and said ""that's you"". He never likes to spend any money whatsoever, but today we went for a walk, there was a shop selling ice creams and coffees etc, he told me that I wanted an ice cream (imagine that) and I explicitly said NO I don't. Whilst I went to the toilet he went into the shop and bought two ice creams. One for me, and the other for him. I told him I didn't want the ice cream. He was mad! He said I only wanted to do something nice for you and proceeded to storm off, having a tantrum, saying he was going home! But I had told him prior that I did not want the ice cream! The ice-cream also contained an ingredient that I'm allergic to!

Okay, friends, let‚Äôs spill the tea on morning routines! ‚òï Ever wake up feeling like a zombie, stumbling through your day, only to realize half your tasks are still waiting like that pile of laundry you‚Äôve been ignoring? *Yeah, we‚Äôve all been there.* 

But let me share a little gem that flipped my mornings upside down and made me feel like I could conquer the world (or at least my to-do list). **Enter: the 10-Minute Power Plan!** üí•

So, here‚Äôs the deal:

1. **The Power of Intention**: Before you even hop out of bed, take a moment to visualize your day. üß† What‚Äôs one thing you want to achieve? Get into that mindset and let it simmer. It‚Äôs like setting your phone to ‚ÄúDo Not Disturb‚Äù mode‚Äîcue the focus! 

2. **Hydrate Like Your Life Depends On It**: Seriously, chugging a glass of water first thing is like giving your brain a jumpstart. üö∞ *Consider it coffee for your cells.* It wakes you up faster than an alarm clock in a horror movie! 

3. **Get Moving**: No, I don‚Äôt mean a full workout (though if that‚Äôs your jam, go for it!). Just a few minutes of stretching or a quick dance-off to your favorite song can get those endorphins flowing. üíÉ Plus, it works wonders for those early-morning brain fogs!

4. **Ditch the Phone (for 10 minutes at least)**: Now, I know this is a tough one. But instead of scrolling through social media or checking emails, spend those first moments in silence or with a book. üìñ (Shocking, right?) It‚Äôs like giving yourself a mini-retreat before the chaos kicks in.

5. **Write It Down**: Jot down 3 things you‚Äôre grateful for and 3 top priorities for the day. üôè This little practice grounds you and gets you focused. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt want to start their day on a positive note?

Look, I‚Äôm not claiming that this is the Magic Formula to success, but I‚Äôve definitely noticed my productivity soar. *It‚Äôs just a blend of small actions that *made a huge difference!* 

Now, I‚Äôd love to hear your morning hacks. What little rituals get you fired up and ready to tackle the day? Let‚Äôs swap our winning strategies‚Äîwho knows, we might just create the ultimate morning routine list together!",1,1744437023.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jxadot,https://i.redd.it/eyqrwkh9ecue1.jpeg,Darsh mittal experience & Decant review,"Note: I'm not a professional perfume reviewer ‚Äì just sharing my honest experience.

There are two points I‚Äôd like to talk about:

1. Experience with Darsh Mittal
I noticed in a few earlier posts that some people had concerns about the originality of perfumes from Darsh. So, I decided to give it a try and ordered 5 decants.

The whole process was smooth, and the pricing for the decants was quite affordable. I've smelled a few of these perfumes before, and I can say the decants I received smelled pretty much the same. Based on that, I‚Äôd say it was a good overall experience with Darsh.

2. Do Perfumes Smell Different in Decants vs Original Bottles?
Yes, I did feel a bit of a difference. I‚Äôve smelled the same perfumes from original bottles, and they seemed slightly better in terms of richness and performance.

This could be due to the decanting process, where exposure to air might slightly alter the scent profile. Transportation could also have a minor impact. So, while decants are a great way to sample fragrances, original bottles still have the edge in quality and consistency.

Basic Decant Reviews (from a Newbie)

‚ÄîBest

A. Versace Eros EDP
Best among the ones I tried ‚Äî fresh, fruity, long-lasting with strong projection. It‚Äôs somewhat similar to Beardo Godfather, but richer.

B. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa

Great for winters or nighttime. It starts with a bit of an alcohol blast, but settles into a warm gourmand scent with vanilla and coffee notes. Longevity was moderate.

C. Cammero Homme Intense
A good buy at its price. It‚Äôs a clone of Dior Homme Intense, with a nice blend of iris and vanilla. Best suited for colder weather. Longevity and projection were average, but the scent profile is solid.

‚ÄîAverage

CDNIM PP (Club de Nuit Intense Man Pure Parfum)

This one came with a lot of hype ‚Äî people saying it‚Äôs a ""panty-dropper"" and whatnot. But honestly, I found it average across the board ‚Äî smell, longevity, and projection. Not as mind-blowing as I expected.

‚ÄîDisappointing

Versace Dylan Blue

Heard a lot of good things, but it smelled like a shower gel or aftershave to me. Not my vibe. That said, if someone likes that fresh-sharp profile, they might enjoy it. Performance-wise, it was okay ‚Äî nothing special.


‚Äî My Favorite Perfume So Far

Gucci Flora ‚Äî just a beautiful, addictive scent. Easily the best I've smelled till now.

***His humanity restored, his battle satisfied.***

‚ÄúWith 2 wins and 1 loss, the Gods have taken the lead for the first time since a millennium! The winner of the third round of Ragnarok is‚Ä¶**LORD YU HUANG!**‚Äù *Heimdall‚Äôs voice boomed across the arena, his announcement echoing in every corner. The gods roared in triumph, their voices merging into a deafening chorus of victory, while others chanted Yu Huang‚Äôs name with overwhelming reverence.*

*On the other hand, humanity‚Äôs side was eerily quiet. A second consecutive loss pressed down on them, casting a heavy gloom over their faces. Many lowered their heads, fists clenched in frustration, while others exhaled in disappointment. Yet, amidst the sorrow, their resilience stirred. Slowly, their gazes lifted, their eyes filled not with despair, but with hope. Nobunaga was still alive, still breathing. That alone was a small but crucial hope. It was two losses. But it was not the end. They could still recover.*

*From the entrance hall of humanity, a voice rang out, its echo carrying through the vast expanse.* ‚ÄúNobunaga!‚Äù *Mitsuhide and the assembled retainers surged forward, their footsteps pounding against the stone floor as they rushed out of the hall and into the massive arena.*

‚ÄúFinally...I can rest now‚Ä¶‚Äù *Yu Huang muttered, his weary eye swept over the daimyo‚Äôs remaining supporters before he collapsed onto the bloodstained ground. Upon seeing this, the Chinese gods leaped from their seats, rushing toward the emperor.*

‚ÄúUncle!‚Äù *Erlang cried out in alarm, his hands trembling as he reached for his wrist. Pressing his fingers against the skin, he held his breath, desperately searching for any sign of life. A wave of relief washed over him when he finally detected a faint but steady pulse.* ‚ÄúThank goodness‚Ä¶He‚Äôs still alive, he‚Äôs just unconscious.‚Äù *The Chinese gods let out a collective sigh of relief. Erlang and Xiwangmu then moved swiftly as they bent down to lift him onto their shoulders.*

*From a distance, Mitsuhide observed the Chinese gods working together to aid Yu Huang. Meanwhile, Mitsuhide was occupied with carefully supporting Nobunaga, ensuring that the daimyo was safely handed over to the retainers. Only after Nobunaga was in capable hands from the retainers did Mitsuhide turn his attention back to the gods. Gathering his composure, he took a deep breath and began making his way toward them.*

‚ÄúYu Huang‚Ä¶‚Äù *Mitsuhide called out, immediately drawing the attention of the Chinese gods. His sharp eyes flickered with emotion as he hesitated for a moment, then, with great reverence, he stepped forward and bowed deeply before the emperor.* ‚ÄúThank you for sparing Nobunaga‚Äôs life! Though we stand on opposite sides, I offer you my deepest thanks!‚Äù *He declared, his voice filled with both relief and gratitude.*

‚ÄúLord Mitsuhide‚Ä¶! What are you doing‚Ä¶!?‚Äù *One of the retainers cried out, their voice filled with shock and disbelief as they tried to take a step forward. Before the retainer could say anything further, Yu Huang swiftly stepped in, his expression calm yet urgent.*

‚ÄúLift your head. Please, provide Nobunaga with immediate medical care before it‚Äôs too late,‚Äù *The Chinese gods moved as they carefully carried the wounded emperor away from the arena and made their way toward Lyfjaberg. As they ascended the steps, Yu Huang stole a final glance over his shoulder, his eye following Nobunaga‚Äôs retainers as they carried their lord through the opposing entrance. Their figures grew smaller with each step, vanishing into the dimly lit corridors. A quiet sigh escaped his lip before muttering.* ‚ÄúFarewell, for now.‚Äù *Without another word, he turned forward. They stepped into the Gods‚Äô entrance hall. The massive gates of both entrances groaned as they began to close.*

*As the Chinese gods strode down the entrance hall, a sudden disturbance caught their attention. From the shadows at the far end of the corridor, a lone figure emerged, stepping forward. The gods halted as the stranger advanced, positioning themselves directly in the center of the passageway.*

‚ÄúOh dear, what brings you here‚Ä¶**Lord Huitzilopochtli?**‚Äù *Yu Huang asked. The war god stood with his muscular arms crossed firmly over his chest. His face was shadowed by an intense, stormy expression, his jaw clenched so tightly that his teeth ground against each other.*

‚ÄúYu Huang‚Ä¶! How dare you try to forfeit that fight!?‚Äù *Huitzilopochtli snarled. The Chinese gods stiffened, sensing the war god's aggression, their hands instinctively moving as they prepared to shield the emperor from sudden attacks. Yet, Yu Huang raised a hand to stop them.*

‚ÄúPlease, it‚Äôs a common decency to not yell at an injured person, Lord Huitzilopochtli. Has nobody ever told you that before?‚Äù *Yu Huang let out a long, weary sigh. Huitzilopochtli‚Äôs muscles tensed, jaw tightening as if suppressing the urge to lash out. The mere act of Yu Huang's sigh felt like an insult that only fueled his simmering frustration.*

‚ÄúShut up! Don‚Äôt act like you know everything about me. What are you scheming about forfeiting, or even worse, letting that human survive!?‚Äù *Huitzilopochtli growled. His grip tightened, fingers curling as he took another step forward, the floor beneath him seeming to tremble in response.*

‚ÄúScheme? Well‚Ä¶What need is there to scheme? I love‚Ä¶**Humanity.** I was suspicious of Nobunaga‚Äôs roots. So I only joined to purge the evils inside of him. If he wasn‚Äôt, then I would have given up my spot in Ragnarok.‚Äù *Yu Huang explained. The ground trembled beneath them, sending vibrations up through their feet. Cracks splintered across the floor beneath Huitzilopochtli, jagged lines spreading like lightning through stone. Dust and debris tumbled from the fractures as the floor groaned.*

‚ÄúWha-What the hell are you even saying? I don‚Äôt understand, nor do I care about whatever nonsense you‚Äôre blathering! But if there‚Äôs one thing I gathered from your pitiful words, it‚Äôs that you are truly soft, pathetic, even! You lack brutality, the sheer will to dominate! And, most of all, you lack divinity! To forfeit? That is nothing less than a disgrace, a vile insult to those who came before you! Do you not understand the significance of those who died, the gods who carved their names into Ragnarok with their blood and sacrifice? You spit upon their memory with such weakness! You are nothing but a disgrace, unworthy to be called a god, unworthy even of calling yourself a king!‚Äù *Huitzilopochtli‚Äôs words struck Yu Huang like the beat of a war drum, reverberating through the air with such force that, for a moment, all else seemed to vanish. The Chinese gods stood frozen. Speechless, Yu Huang could only stare, his mind reeling, as he grasped for a response to the Aztec god.*

‚ÄúLet me tell you then, even though they lost their lives in battle, why would they blame anyone else for choosing a different path? They fought because they chose to because their hearts led them to that fate. No one forced them, and the same goes for me. My will is to‚Ä¶save humanity. But‚Ä¶Nobunaga got the better of me, and in the end, I was compelled to follow his words instead of my convictions.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, don‚Äôt be mad. You should be glad because the gods are a step ahead this time. But this isn't the end. Humanity has always risen from the brink of despair, and they will rise again. Soon enough, the tides will turn in their favor.‚Äù *Huitzilopochtli‚Äôs expression darkened, but before his anger could erupt into something far worse, the Chinese gods quickly intervened. They walked away, cutting the conversation short before it could spiral any further, leaving behind the simmering fury of the war god.*

*From the Greek Gods' VIP Booth, Ares let out a sigh of relief, his tense shoulders relaxing since the fight began. However, his expression shifted from relief to utter bewilderment. His brows furrowed, and he leaned forward, gripping the edge of his seat.* ‚ÄúI'm glad Lord Yu Huang won, but I don't understand how he won!‚Äù *He glanced at the other gods in the booth, searching for some explanation.*

*Scratching her right cheek in thought, she carefully deduced the Cat Zodiac, piecing together the information in her mind. Her brow furrowed slightly as she weighed the possibilities, searching for the most logical conclusion. After a brief moment of contemplation, she finally spoke, though her tone carried a hint of hesitation.* ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôve figured it out, but don‚Äôt take my words as the truth. This is just my interpretation. From what I can gather, I believe that the event between Lord Yu Huang and Nobunaga was reversed.‚Äù

‚ÄúReversed?‚Äù *Ares asked while Athena gave a firm nod in response, with the goddess continuing her deduction.*

‚ÄúIndeed. For example, when Lord Yu Huang suffers a grave injury during his battle against Nobunaga, he reverses the course of events that transpired between them. In doing so, the damage he sustained would instead be transferred to Nobunaga, leaving him to bear the injury.‚Äù *Athena finished, leaving Zeus to giggle before he finally spoke.*

‚ÄúHoho\~ That is truly a terrifying ability, indeed. But we should be glad, right? With that power, we have finally taken the lead.‚Äù *Zeus said, his voice carrying amusement as he stroked his beard. A murmur of agreement spread through the booth as the gods nodded in satisfaction.*

*Suddenly, a sharp ringing noise echoed through the VIP booth. All eyes turned toward Athena as she reached into the folds of her robes and retrieved her phone. The goddess held the phone to her ear before turning to Zeus with a nod.* ‚ÄúPlease excuse me, Lord Zeus.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre excused.‚Äù *He replied, watching as Athena stepped away to take the call.*

‚ÄúHello? Seriously‚Ä¶You don‚Äôt have any spare employees available? I‚Äôm swamped right now, you know that‚Ä¶Fine. I‚Äôll see what I can do.‚Äù *Athena let out a long, weary sigh before finally hanging up her phone. She lingered momentarily, rubbing her temple in frustration, before slipping the device back into her robe. Taking a deep breath, she straightened her posture and turned her attention back to the gods before her.*

‚ÄúLord Zeus‚Ä¶I beg your forgiveness for my selfish request. I ask for your permission to withdraw from Ragnarok temporarily.‚Äù *Athena lowered herself into a deep bow before Zeus. A ripple of shock passed through the room, none were more visibly stunned than Ares. His eyes widened in disbelief, his jaw dropping so dramatically that it seemed as if it might hit the floor.*

‚ÄúHmm. And what do you plan to do should I see fit to grant your request?‚Äù *Zeus asked, his gaze fixed upon the goddess as he leaned forward.*

‚ÄúAll I can say is that I have a personal matter, one that is mine alone to handle, and no one else can interfere with it. Rest assured, I won‚Äôt be a burden to you. If you summon me for my round, I will appear, but beyond that, you won‚Äôt have to concern yourself with me until the end of this Ragnarok. That, I can guarantee.‚Äù *Zeus hummed briefly, slowly stroking his beard, deep in thought, before a chuckle rumbled from his mouth.*

‚ÄúHoho\~ I find these terms agreeable. Athena, you may withdraw until I summon you. Have fun, dear!‚Äù *Zeus waved his hand as Athena gracefully lowered herself into a bow. Without another word, she turned on her heel and strode outside of the VIP booth.*

‚ÄúI wonder‚Ä¶What could be so urgent that she needs to leave so suddenly?‚Äù *Hermes said, his gaze lingering on her even as the doors creaked, slowly inching shut behind her.*

‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs just a big, cowardly chicken? Look at her trembling in fear! Bok, bok, bok!‚Äù *Dionysus cackled, his voice dripping with amusement as he flapped his hands like wings in mockery. His laughter echoed through the room. Ares, standing nearby, clenched his jaw as his irritation flared. The war god‚Äôs fists tightened, his patience wearing thin with each passing second. His glare darkened as he turned toward Dionysus, clearly unamused by the wine god‚Äôs taunts.*

‚ÄúShut up! Athena is not that kind of person!‚Äù *Ares snarled, his eyes blazing with barely contained rage.* ‚ÄúI know her business is just as important as anyone else'!‚Äù *He leaned forward, muscles tensed as if preparing to lunge, his body casting a shadow over Dionysus. His hands curled into fists at his sides, the tendons in his arms tightening as if resisting the urge to grab hold of the wine god.*

‚ÄúNow, now. There‚Äôs no need to get upset. I‚Äôm sure that Dionysus was merely jesting. But whatever business Athena has, it must be important for her, so just let her be.‚Äù *Zeus said in a calming tone. He stepped forward, placing his hands on both Ares and Dionysus. With a so-called gentle touch, he pressed down on Ares‚Äô shoulder, urging the war god to ease his stance.*

‚ÄúCome now, let‚Äôs focus on the matter and decide on our next **representative**.‚Äù

**\[Arena Corridor\]**

*The two Valkyries strode down the long, dimly lit corridor that led to the rooms of the Einherjar. Aslaug‚Äôs face was tight with concern, her brows furrowed, lips pressed into a thin line. Her fingers curled into fists at her sides. Beside her, G√∂ll walked with unwavering composure, her expression as serene as still water. The contrast between them only deepened Aslaug‚Äôs confusion.*

‚ÄúAunt G√∂ll? Aren‚Äôt you upset? The gods took the lead‚Ä¶They...‚Äù *She hesitated, shaking her head.*

*G√∂ll exhaled softly, the corners of her lips twitching.* ‚ÄúIs that what troubles you?‚Äù *G√∂ll remained silent for a moment, letting the younger Valkyrie‚Äôs frustration settle in the air between them.*

‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt be mad. A part of me is relieved that Nobunaga survived. It means he still has a role to play someday.‚Äù *The older Valkyrie's fingers twitched slightly.* ‚ÄúBut still, we lost the lead.‚Äù

*Her gaze drifted back to Aslaug, eyes gleaming with something filled with curiosity, amusement, and perhaps a touch of challenge. A small, knowing smirk began to play at the corners of her lips, curling upward with quiet confidence.* ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs only the third round. There‚Äôs still a long road ahead.‚Äù

*Aslaug tilted her head, her brows knitting together as she studied her aunt‚Äôs face.* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶not worried?‚Äù

*G√∂ll chuckled softly.* ‚ÄúI have the perfect fighter lined up for the fourth round. I‚Äôve anticipated a situation like this.‚Äù *She reached out, taking Aslaug‚Äôs hand in a show of warmth. Together, they resumed their stride until they reached their destination.*

*A gate adorned with an intricate fleur-de-lis design loomed ahead, its metal gleaming under the faint glow of lights like a beacon in the dimming light. She swallowed hard, her fingers instinctively clenching at her sides.* ‚ÄúSo, this is it?‚Äù *she asked, her brows furrowed as she studied the gate. Then, with a tilt of her head, she added,* ‚ÄúYou seem to have a lot of confidence in this next fighter, huh, Auntie?‚Äù *There was no response right away, only a knowing smirk that made her pulse quicken.*

*G√∂ll slowly released her grip, allowing her hand to fall to her side as she took a deliberate step forward. A chill radiated from the cold metal as she reached out, pressing her palm against it.* ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù *she muttered. Her fingers traced the intricate engravings etched into the steel before she lifted her chin and exhaled.* ‚ÄúAnd behind this gate,‚Äù *she continued, her breath ghosting against the frozen surface,* ‚Äúawaits our next champion!‚Äù

*As they stepped into the room, the hallway they entered was flanked on both sides by tall, sweeping walls adorned with rows of white flags. Each flag was crafted from a soft white fabric, its surface delicately textured and shimmering faintly under the soft glow of the overhead lights. Sprinkled across the fabric were intricate patterns of white lilies meticulously embroidered with threads of silver and pale gold. On either side of every flag stood an angel. High above the entrance to the main chamber, a single word was emblazoned on the white flag in bold, elegant script:* ***‚ÄúEINHERJAR‚Äù.*** *The letters gleamed with a silken fringe, catching the light like starlight woven into fabric.*

‚ÄúWoah‚Ä¶It's so beautiful‚Ä¶‚Äù *Aslaug exclaimed, her eyes widening in awe as she took in the breathtaking sight before her. The way the light shimmered made her momentarily forget to breathe. Beside her, G√∂ll let out a soft giggle, amused by Aslaug‚Äôs reaction.*

‚ÄúIf you think this is beautiful, just wait until you lay eyes on our champion,‚Äù *G√∂ll said. Finally, they arrived at the entrance to the main room, where an enormous gate adorned with a fleur-de-lis loomed before them. G√∂ll paused for a moment before placing her hand against the gate.* ‚ÄúGet ready.‚Äù *Then, with a push, the final gate began to open.*

*After the gate creaked open, the two Valkyries stepped forward with anticipation, expecting the champion waiting on the other side. Instead, they were met with‚Ä¶nothing. There was no fancy decoration, no humanity's representative, it was just an ordinary room, plain and unremarkable. The walls were bare except for a framed fleur-de-lis flag hanging neatly in the center. No other items, nothing extravagant. It was disappointingly mundane. Aslaug furrowed her brow, glancing around in confusion.* ‚ÄúUhh, Aunt G√∂ll?‚Äù *She ventured, her voice breaking the eerie silence.¬† She turned to look at the older Valkyrie, only to be startled by the strange expression on G√∂ll‚Äôs face.*

‚ÄúWhere‚Ä¶in the actual hell‚Ä¶**IS SHE!?**‚Äù *G√∂ll‚Äôs voice rang out, thick with frustration, her words broken by sharp pauses as if she were struggling to contain the sheer force of her anger. Aslaug, standing nearby, winced at the volume, her hands instinctively flying up to cover her ears before her aunt could even finish her exclamation.*

**\[Somewhere in Valhalla\]**

*After the previous Ragnarok, an alliance between a handful of gods and the very humans they had once viewed as insignificant, was formed. While most gods still harbored a deep-seated grudge against humanity, a few among the pantheon saw something different in them. To preserve this fragile bond and protect it from the other gods, the gods and humans constructed a hidden sanctuary within Valhalla, built over decades. Its size rivaled that of a small town, with winding streets, vibrant gardens, and buildings designed with a mix of mortal practicality and divine elegance.*

*Within this clandestine sanctuary, there was a kindergarten nestled near the center of the town. Unlike any other school, this place welcomed both humans and godchildren alike. In the middle of the playground, laughter echoed like bells on a summer morning. A teacher darted between the laughing children. She had fiery red hair tied in a bun and bright blue eyes. Her glasses slid slightly down her nose as she ran, but she paid them no mind.*

‚ÄúYou're not getting away that easily!‚Äù *She called with a laugh, her voice ringing with playful mischief as a group of giggling children scattered in all directions. The kids shrieked with delight, some tripping over their tiny feet while others tried to hide behind low bushes and benches. One by one, she caught each of them, gently tapping their shoulders and declaring them ‚Äúcaught‚Äù with a playful grin. Only one child remained. She narrowed her eyes at them and crouched slightly. Then, with a sudden burst of energy, she sprinted toward them.*

*The child squealed, turned, and bolted away as fast as possible. They glanced over their shoulder to see how close she was. But suddenly, their foot caught on a small divot in the ground, and they tumbled forward with a yelp. The teacher's eyes widened. Without thinking, her instincts took over. She dove forward, arms outstretched, aiming to catch them before they could hit the ground.*

*But just as the two of them were about to collide with the ground, a blur of motion entered the scene. Seemingly out of nowhere, a tall figure appeared, towering and almost impossibly muscular. It was another kindergarten teacher, but unlike any most people had ever seen. Her blue hair flowed and her abs and biceps rippled. She wore a sleek black facemask over her face and mirrored shades that glinted under the sun.*

*With her immense speed, she intercepted both the child and the lady mid-fall. One strong arm cradled the child, the other wrapped around the lady‚Äôs waist, absorbing their momentum effortlessly as she dropped into a perfect landing, knees bent.*

*Then the child giggled again, the lady looked up at the muscular teacher, still stunned, breathing heavily. The kindergarten teacher said nothing, just gave a slight nod. And with that, she gently set both of them back on their feet.*

‚ÄúAh, thank you so much!‚Äù¬† *The red-haired teacher exclaimed as she stepped forward, inclining her head in a polite bow to her colleague.*

*The blue-haired teacher offered a modest nod in return.* ‚ÄúNo worries at all. I‚Äôm just glad you‚Äôre safe.‚Äù

*The red-haired teacher straightened up slowly, brushing a loose lock of hair behind her ear. There was a moment of silence before she spoke.* ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶are you new here? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen you around before.‚Äù *She asked, her head tilting just slightly to the side.*

\*The other woman chuckled softly. ‚Äú\*I‚Äôve been here for quite a while now. Years. I suppose it‚Äôs just one of those things, we must‚Äôve been circling each other without realizing it. Different schedules, different classrooms...you know how it is. Entire years pass without ever bumping into someone who‚Äôs been just down the hall. Funny, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù *She said, tilting her head slightly to insinuate that she was smiling.*

‚ÄúAh, I see,‚Äù *The red-haired teacher murmured as she inclined her head slightly. Then she gave a small nod.* ‚ÄúThat makes sense. Well, either way, I just realized we haven‚Äôt had the chance to introduce ourselves yet properly, have we?‚Äù *She continued with a friendly chuckle. With that, she extended a hand toward the blue-haired teacher.* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jeanne d‚ÄôArc, it‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you.‚Äù

*The blue-haired teacher paused for a moment, her expression softening as if the name was familiar to her.* ‚ÄúJeanne d‚ÄôArc, huh‚Ä¶That‚Äôs a beautiful name.‚Äù *Jeanne‚Äôs cheeks flushed with a gentle pink at the unexpected compliment, catching her off guard. Still, she held her smile steady, though a flicker of surprise danced behind her eyes.* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶**Minerva**,‚Äù *The teacher continued. Accepting Jeanne's hand.* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pleasure to meet you as well.‚Äù

*After the children were tucked into their beds, Jeanne stepped outside and raised her arms above her head in a slow stretch. Behind her, Minerva approached her while carrying two cups of coffee.* ‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù *Minerva asked, holding one out.*

*Jeanne looked at her, then at the cup.* ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù *She murmured, accepting the cup with both hands.*

*As the two sat in the quiet corner of the kindergarten, Minerva watched Jeanne with a soft expression. The goddess' lips curled into a gentle smile as she leaned back in her chair. After a moment of silence, she tilted her head slightly.* ‚ÄúSay, why did you choose to become a kindergarten teacher?‚Äù

‚ÄúHm? Oh. Funny question, really,‚Äù *Jeanne said with a short, breathy laugh, though there was a strange undertone to her voice that made Minerva glance up more sharply.* ‚ÄúThis isn't my first job, no. I‚Äôve been moving around for a while now, just wandering through Valhalla. Trying to see what‚Äôs out there, what kind of people live in different corners of this place. It‚Äôs fascinating.‚Äù

*She trailed off, her smile dimming slightly.* ‚ÄúEventually, I ended up here. I didn‚Äôt mean to stay long at first, but something about this place felt‚Ä¶safer. Or maybe I was just tired. And somewhere along the way, I guess this journey allowed me to start finding pieces I was missing during my life.‚Äù

*Her eyes fell to the ground, shoulders subtly sinking with a weight Minerva hadn‚Äôt noticed.* ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù *Minerva asked softly, but Jeanne didn‚Äôt immediately respond.*

‚Äú‚Ä¶Oh? Yeah, I'm fine.‚Äù *The martyr let out a quiet sniffle. Sensing her distress, Minerva gently reached out and placed a comforting hand on her back. They stood together in a shared pause until the silence was abruptly broken. Without any prior warning, the gate to the kindergarten creaked open with a loud, jarring clatter, the sudden noise cutting through their moment and startling them both.*

\*From the gate, three figures entered. G√∂ll, Aslaug, and...\****Nike.***

‚ÄúJeanne‚Äôd Arc, the fight is about to begin! It‚Äôs your turn to fight in the fourth round!‚Äù

‚ÄúMistress Athena, the fight is about to begin. It is your turn to fight in the fourth round.‚Äù

**\[Nike (Greek Pantheon) - Zeus/Athena‚Äôs Subordinate/Goddess of Victory\]**

*G√∂ll and Nike exclaimed in unison, drawing startled glances from the teachers. At that moment, Athena became acutely aware of her hand resting against Jeanne‚Äôs back. The goddess quickly withdrew her hand before Nike noticed.*

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶they found us,‚Äù *Athena murmured, her eyes narrowing as she glanced toward the women.* ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk later,‚Äù *she added.* ‚ÄúAfter my round.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶I‚Äôll be back as soon as I can‚Ä¶‚Äù *Jeanne replied before turning slightly. Athena's words gave her pause. The martyr raised her brows in surprise before turning her head toward the goddess.*

‚ÄúHm?‚Äù *The teachers hummed in unison, turning to look at each other, eyes widening slightly as the realization settled over them like a sudden gust of wind. Slowly, they realized they were the ones chosen to face off in the fourth round.*

‚ÄúHuh‚Ä¶?‚Äù *Aslaug and Nike exchanged bewildered glances to each other, momentarily stunned by the sudden possibility of a solution they hadn‚Äôt even considered, two fighters meeting each other before their round. Neither of them knew quite what to say.*

*However, rather than reacting with indifference simply because her opponent now stood directly before her, Athena reached up and removed her facemask, followed by her shades, revealing her full face to Jeanne. Her eyes met the human champion's as she extended her other hand in a gesture of sportsmanship.* ‚ÄúI want to apologize for lying about my name, my real name is Athena. I hope we can fight with mutual respect and keep things professional between us.‚Äù

*Jeanne followed up with a soft smile, she stepped forward and firmly clasped Athena‚Äôs hand.* ‚ÄúAnd I am Jeanne d‚ÄôArc. I wish you the best of luck, you‚Äôll need it...‚Äù *Her tone shifted slightly as a subtle smirk tugged at her lips.* ‚ÄúBecause I am going to win this. For **humanity.**‚Äù

‚ÄúOh? Is that so?‚Äù *Athena‚Äôs lips curled into a playful grin.* ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a challenge.‚Äù *With a glance toward Nike, she exited the kindergarten alongside Jeanne, preparing for their fight.*

**\[Valhalla Arena\]**

*The entire arena below had now transformed into a massive stone bridge and was anchored on both ends by two enormous stone castles. Each castle faced the other directly and served as the champions' gates.*

‚ÄúRagnarok Round Four. The gods have two wins and humanity has one. And now we‚Äôve reached a turning point in the opening rounds!‚Äù *Heimdall declared through his Gjallarhorn, booming across the arena.*

*In the VIP booth of the Greek Gods, resided Zeus, Hermes, Ares, and Dionysus. Watching, the war god turned toward Zeus.* ‚ÄúLord Zeus, I can‚Äôt believe that you chose Athena, even after she told you she was busy‚Ä¶‚Äù *Ares sighed deeply.*

‚ÄúHoho\~ Sorry about that. But if we‚Äôre serious about keeping our winning streak alive‚Ä¶then we have no choice. We need Athena.‚Äù *Zeus said with a mischievous grin before Dionysus, lounging with a goblet in hand, rolled his eyes and scoffed audibly at the Supreme God‚Äôs statement.*

‚ÄúThat's funny because deformed Hel and old man Perun are right there.‚Äù *Dionysus drawled with a smirk, gesturing lazily as he tilted his wine cup and took a slow sip. The jab wasn‚Äôt subtle, he just wanted a reaction. Ares' jaw tightened slightly, the only sign of the irritation flickering beneath the surface. But he didn‚Äôt rise to the bait. At least, not in this round to respect Athena.*

‚ÄúWe will now move on to our next fighter! Fighting for humanity...is this woman!‚Äù *Heimdall exclaimed, humanity's crowd erupted into a chorus of gasps and murmurs, stunned into disbelief.*

‚ÄúA‚Ä¶woman?‚Äù *Someone whispered.*

*All of a sudden, a wave of angelic music rolled across the arena. From high above, beams of radiant light cascaded down in columns, illuminating the gate on humanity‚Äôs side with an ethereal glow. Feathers resembling angels‚Äô wings fell from the sky as it gratefully landed on the stage, forming a small bridge for the fighter. The stone doors began to shift with a deep rumble. Slowly, they creaked open.*

*Emerging from the gate was the red-haired teacher. Wearing a gleaming suit of silver armor that shimmered under the light with two badges attached with a pair of ribbons colored red/white and blue/white on her upper chest area. A finely crafted long sword on the side of her hip, its hilt wrapped in worn leather, wrapping around leather belts. In her right hand, she held a chain, coiled around her arm with a large log attached.*

‚ÄúIn the year 1412, a miracle child was born from the kingdom of France during the Hundred Years' War! Defeat after defeat at the hands of the English robbed the French of nearly all their lands! And the one who saved France from such dire straits was a peasant girl who heard the voice of god speak to her! She fought for the sake of France, and guided her motherland to victory! A single girl, not even trained in combat, winning battle after battle! Her actions were nothing short of divine inspiration! However‚Ä¶In the end, god abandoned her. A national hero who suffered a tragic fate, known as ‚Äú**La Pucelle d'Orl√©ans**‚Äù, ‚Äú**Holy Maiden of Salvation**‚Äù, ‚Äú**Humanity‚Äôs Sainted Maiden**‚Äù, her name is‚Ä¶‚Äù

**JEANNE D‚ÄôARC!**

**Representative of Humanity for Round 4**

**\[Jeanne d‚ÄôArc - French\]**

‚ÄúT-That witch! Why is that wicked woman the one who represents humanity!?‚Äù *John of Lancaster, the person most responsible for her trial and death cried out. Murmurs of outrage and disbelief from the English rippled through the crowd, their faces contorting into grimaces at the very sight of Jeanne. To them, her presence was disgusting, stained with dark magic. However, a snicker could be heard near the English. A king in a royal red robe sat with his arms crossed and cackled at the English's murmuring.*

‚ÄúHah! Pathetic English swine! Still pissing your pants over her, are you?‚Äù *The king sneered, mockingly laughing at the English knights. The courtiers and knights around him laughed uproariously, Some of the nobles laughed while pointing at the English, and others simply smirked with a smug expression.*

**\[Charles VII - French\]**

‚ÄúJeanne‚Äôs the most valuable of them all! After all, even when we were overwhelmed. Only she could motivate us to victory.‚Äù *The nobleman sitting beside Charles exclaimed, looking toward Jeanne, his expression softened with awe, and gave a small, respectful nod.*

**\[Jean II (Jeanne‚Äôs comrade-in-arms) - French\]**

‚ÄúExactly, she isn‚Äôt so weak to lose against a god. There is a reason why she is chosen for this after all.‚Äù *A military commander sitting beside Charles said firmly. His eyes turned toward Jeanne, and a proud expression lit up his face.*

**\[√âtienne de Vignolles (La Hire) - French\]**

‚ÄúJeanne‚Ä¶Please, don‚Äôt lose. You need to crush that god.‚Äù *A knight muttered from upfront, his voice hoarse. He squeezed his eyes shut and his hands curled into fists so tight his nails bit into his flesh until blood welled beneath his fingertips, as if it could give her the luck she needed.*

**\[Gilles de Rais (Jeanne‚Äôs companion-in-arms) - French\]**

‚ÄúAnd now, fighting for the gods, is none other than her!‚Äù

*From the gate on the side of the gods, she entered. The goddess of wisdom, draped in a full set of armor. Upon her head sat a Corinthian helmet. In her right hand, she wielded a spear with a protrusion shaped with wings like those of an owl. In her left hand she bore her shield, the aegis, and at its center, affixed an emblem, was the face of a gorgon. The clanging noise of her armor echoed as she advanced further into the arena.*

‚ÄúThe goddess who protected legendary heroes such as the King of Ithaca, Odysseus, Slayer of Monsters, Perseus, Tamer of Pegasus, Bellerophon, Leader of the Argonauts, Jason, and even the Indomitable God, Heracles! She is‚Ä¶the heir to Zeus, rival to Poseidon, family to Hades!‚Äù

*Before Heimdall could finish his introduction to the fighter, the goddess raised her spear above her head. She then brought the spear down, slamming its shaft into the stone floor. The impact rang out like a crack of thunder, silencing and sending a shiver through the gods.*

‚ÄúA goddess with unparalleled wisdom!‚Äù

**ATHENA!**

**Representative of the Gods for Round 4**

**\[Athena - Greek Pantheon\]**

‚ÄúLady Athena, huh? I mean, sure, she‚Äôs powerful, but wasn‚Äôt Lady Nemesis originally chosen to be the representative candidate before Athena took her place?‚Äù *One god whispered, and a ripple of murmurs spread through the audiences of gods. Seated a short distance away, another goddess sat with her arms crossed tightly over her chest, watching Athena.*

*‚ÄúAthena‚Ä¶You better win‚Ä¶‚Äù The goddess mused.*

**\[Nemesis (Goddess of Retribution) - Greek Pantheon\]**

‚ÄúMom! Please win this!‚Äù *A man with brown hair, streaked with vivid green highlights, shouted.*

**\[Erichthonius (Athena‚Äôs son) - Greek Pantheon\]**

‚ÄúSo, we meet again, Miss Athena,‚Äù *Jeanne said. Despite having to fight each other, she found herself genuinely relieved at the sight of the goddess.*

‚ÄúJeanne d‚ÄôArc, I remember you from before our round,‚Äù *Athena proclaimed, her words made Jeanne pause as she raised her brows in surprise.*

‚ÄúYou do?‚Äù *The maiden asked, Athena nodded slowly in response.*

‚ÄúA woman who can hear the voice of god that impacted two countries. But, no matter how much glory she has, that didn‚Äôt change her demise‚Ä¶Tell me, why do you still fight for humanity despite their betrayal?‚Äù *Athena asked, Jeanne‚Äôs fingers tightened around her chain, the cool metal biting into her palm as hesitation rooted her in place. She looked down, lips parted slightly, as if on the edge of speaking.*

‚Äú...I was raised to see the good in people, to accept them despite their flaws. I was taught that the mistakes of one do not condemn the many, and that must never be clouded by bitterness or vengeance. And I have carried those lessons with me, even into Valhalla. Though my life was taken unjustly, I cannot, I will not allow that to poison my heart. I do not blame humanity for the actions of a few. **I will not let hatred corrupt my heart, nor will I surrender to resentment.**‚Äù *Jeanne‚Äôs voice rang out. Her words echoed across the battlefield, the French soldiers smiled in delight. Athena stood still before the corners of her mouth lifted.*

‚ÄúWonderful‚Ä¶You are truly wonderful, Jeanne d‚ÄôArc. Now show me...show me the fire that still burns in your soul! Show me your hope for humanity!‚Äù *With those words, Athena‚Äôs fingers tightened around the shaft of her spear as she raised it. She stepped forward and lowered into a battle stance, Her shield rose before her and from behind it, the tip of her spear peeked out, resembling the stance of a Spartan defending.*

‚ÄúI was going to echo those words back to you like a mirror, Miss Athena.‚Äù *Jeanne grasped the heavy log firmly at its midsection as she hoisted it overhead. She brought it crashing back down in front of her, the thud echoing through the clearing like a war drum. She reached for the chain coiled beside the log and her arm. Planting her feet, she shifted into an offensive stance, a contrast to Athena‚Äôs defense.*

‚ÄúNow, are you ready? Ragnarok, Round Four‚Ä¶**BEGINS! FIGHT!!**‚Äù

***The saint of the battlefield versus. The queen of the battlefield.***

As a proud American WordPress developer deeply rooted in Cape Coral, I've witnessed firsthand how locally-developed websites consistently outperform those outsourced overseas.

# The Cape Coral Advantage: Local Insight Delivers Results

What makes Cape Coral's business environment unique? We're a rapidly expanding market with distinctive customer demographics‚Äîseasonal residents, retirees, tourists, and a growing young professional population. Generic website templates simply can't capture the nuanced understanding needed to connect with our diverse community.

I've built custom WordPress solutions for businesses throughout Cape Coral, Fort Myers, and Naples, each carefully crafted to resonate with our local market psychology. From waterfront restaurants in Cape Harbour to real estate firms along Pine Island Road, my WordPress developments reflect authentic Southwest Florida character.

# American Development: Practical Benefits Beyond Patriotism

Choosing an American WordPress developer in Cape Coral delivers tangible advantages that directly impact your business's success:

**Local Accessibility**: Face-to-face meetings at your convenience‚Äîwhether at your office or over coffee at a local Cape Coral caf√©. No overseas communication delays or frustrating language barriers.

**Community Understanding**: I intimately understand Cape Coral's unique business ecosystem, seasonal fluctuations, and competitive landscape‚Äîinsights that offshore developers simply cannot match.

**Florida-Compliant Development**: Your website will be built with full awareness of Florida business regulations and American privacy laws, reducing your compliance risks from day one.

**Economic Strength**: Your investment stays in our Cape Coral community, supporting local families and businesses rather than flowing overseas.

# WordPress Excellence for Cape Coral Businesses

With WordPress powering over 40% of websites worldwide, it's the ideal platform for Cape Coral businesses seeking the perfect balance of flexibility, power, and user-friendliness. My implementation approach ensures your WordPress site delivers the following:

* Lightning-fast performance‚Äîcrucial for impatient mobile users in our on-the-go Florida lifestyle
* Outstanding visibility in local Cape Coral search results
* Flawless display on all devices‚Äîessential for our mobile-heavy tourist demographic
* Rock-solid security protecting your business from increasingly sophisticated threats

# Cape Coral Custom Development: Standing Out in a Competitive Market

The true competitive edge comes from custom WordPress development tailored to your specific Cape Coral business objectives. I don't just install themes‚ÄîI build custom solutions addressing your unique challenges.

Recently, I developed a specialized reservation system for a Cape Coral boat tour company that integrated with their existing operations software, dramatically reducing booking errors and staff workload. Off-the-shelf solutions simply couldn't deliver that level of customization.

# Local Security Focus for Cape Coral Businesses

In today's threat landscape, website security demands proactive local expertise. With an American WordPress developer in Cape Coral, you gain:

* Regular security updates are performed promptly
* Continuous monitoring for suspicious activity
* Secure backup solutions with redundancy
* Immediate local response to potential security issues
* Accountability that overseas developers simply can't match

# Real Results for Real Cape Coral Businesses

A Cape Coral marina recently saw remarkable improvements after I rebuilt their WordPress site with an America-first approach:

* 58% increase in online bookings
* 3.1x improvement in mobile conversion rates
* Dramatic visibility increase in ""Cape Coral boat storage"" searches
* 45% reduction in abandoned form submissions

These metrics translated directly into increased revenue and market share in our competitive Cape Coral marine industry.

# Investing in Cape Coral Quality

Yes, working with a local Cape Coral WordPress developer typically requires more investment than overseas options. However, consider the true cost of a substandard website:

* Lost business from frustrated visitors
* Potential security breaches affecting your reputation
* Ongoing fixes for poorly implemented features
* Missed opportunities in our competitive local market

When you invest in American WordPress development right here in Cape Coral, you're securing quality, reliability, and results that will benefit your business for years.

Your Cape Coral business deserves a website built by someone who understands our unique market, shares your commitment to quality, and remains accessible whenever you need support. Let's create a WordPress presence that truly captures the essence of your business and delivers measurable results in our Southwest Florida community.

I cooked up a coffee fueled idea the other day and wanted to run it by you. (Also to be clear, I‚Äôm trans and this is a t4t project idea.) (Also to note that I‚Äôm NOT trying to start a business to make money myself. *The goal is to make money for specific causes and to provide positive representation in personal spaces for trans people, especially those who might be closeted, eggs, but also anyone.)*  
  
**TL;DR it‚Äôs a poster company of famous trans people marketed to college aged audience.**  
  
Longer simple version: Ask for free image rights from famous trans people to release posters (thinking via meta label or something like this that allows for money distribution directly in the platform) with the sales money going towards some sort of community focused initiative/wherever money is needed.  
  
Thought of this bc when I was that age, I would have benefited from more positive representation and something that I could hang in my bedroom or dorm room.  
  
Candy Darling is a hero of mine since before I knew I could even be trans, so she‚Äôs certainly my inspiration for such a project.  
  
I think I could get in touch with some of the people who could be the subjects of the posters to ask and give it a jump start. I think I might be able to be in touch with an estate or two of some of us who are no longer with us.  
  
Then it would need to be print on demand to start I think, just because I don‚Äôt have the cash to order inventory. But with posters the production seems both flexible and scalable from a manufacturing and distribution perspective.  
  
The blue sky/scaled up version would be that these could be carried where ever posters are sold (or at least whatever tourist shops in Time Square or canal st, collage bookshops etc)  
  
Maybe there could be signed special editions that cost more to help fund the project, or to make promotional events, or offered by each of the celebrities via their channels.

If you‚Äôve ever felt this way, you‚Äôre not broken. Here‚Äôs what helped me start thawing

1. The Body Check-In: Numbness often starts as a survival tactic. Try pausing 3x/day to ask: What‚Äôs one tiny sensation I feel right now? (e.g., ""My coffee is warm."" ""My foot itches."") It sounds stupid, but it rewires your brain to notice feelings again.  

2. Anger Is a Backdoor: I couldn‚Äôt cry, but I could rage at minor things. My therapist said anger is often the first emotion to return. Instead of judging it, I started asking: What is this anger protecting me from?

3. Safe Boredom: Numbness thrives on distraction (doomscrolling, overworking). I scheduled 10 minutes a day to just sit, no phone, no music. At first, it was agony. Then, flickers of emotion crept in.

Since you seek to know me better, understand me as I am now, I will share my spicy state of mind. 

Right now, I‚Äôm moody. 

Not in a ‚Äòspoiling for a fight‚Äô sort of way, but in a softer way. The way a spirit feels unrest when there are things weighing on the heart. I seek silence and quiet contemplation when I feel this way. Sometimes a somber mood doesn‚Äôt need to be defined beyond the identification of the emotion being experienced. 

I find seeking the quiet, letting the emotion wash over me, till the wave recedes back into the ocean the most effective in letting go of the immense weight I like to carry around and hide from the world. 

I don‚Äôt always understand it, as I no longer feel like I need to understand things to experience them the way they are. Being in the present and enjoying the small moments that life offers in a whisper, not on a silver platter, those are the ones I crave. 

The quiet whisper of life that spring is on the way and all this winter has been a cold and harsh lesson I‚Äôve been striving to learn for too many years now. 

It‚Äôs nice to see the tulip shoots in my front yard, to feel the gentle hum of the Earth as she wakes to a new season of being. To feel myself start to come alive in a way that has me stretching my limbs for the first time in too long has me feeling somber for the ways I have used other to get to where I am now. 

I have many regrets. One day I will share those with you, as we learn to experience each other as we are now. My regrets weigh heavy on my heart this evening. 

Perhaps I will reach for the whiskey after all. 

Not to get drunk, I seldom drink to reach inebriation. But maybe a glass or two to help me sink into my darker feelings and experience the pain I have both caused and received in these many wintry months falling behind us.

Looking at the stars on a warm evening,

Pinkie with a brain

I met R(28M) at a social event in Dec last year. We exchanged IG handles and continued talking on DMs when we realised that we had similar interests. R invited me out for coffee and the rest was history. I was intrigued by his confidence and charisma and later came to understand that he had went through a lot to become the version of himself now. I resonated with his struggles deeply because I have a traumatic past too and I‚Äôm still healing from my wounds.

Talking to R is easy and we quickly showed our vulnerabilities to each other within weeks of our first meeting. During our first date, he told me that he was a few months fresh out of a 5-year relationship with someone he thought he was gonna marry. He admitted that he was partly to blame because of his busy schedule and his avoidant tendencies. His ex always complained that he spent too much time volunteering and didn‚Äôt think about their relationship enough. He wanted to salvage the relationship but the damage was done. While he was healing from his break-up, he unexpectedly met me.

Our relationship moved quite fast within 4 months and we both try to be as open as possible about our unhealed wounds. I felt so cared for and supported. There was finally someone that I could rely on and he made me so happy. I have an anxious attachment style, made worse by a previous bad situationship, but I tried to be less needy of him since I knew that he was involved in multiple activities. R also tried to be less avoidant by actively communicating with me and initiating date nights. We support each other‚Äôs healing journey and try to do monthly check-ins on how and where this relationship is going.

I thought things were going alright until yesterday. He said that he had something to share so we went for a drive. He asked me about how I think the relationship was going and I said that it‚Äôs unexpected but nice and I enjoyed the time I spend with him. I also told him that being with him had healed parts of me that I didn‚Äôt know needed healing. He then said that he spent too much time on his activities and that I was being too patient with him. I assured him that I understood his busy schedule and even encouraged him to focus on himself since he had a lot of things he wanted to achieve. I could also focus on myself and do things that I wanted to do ‚Äì things I didn‚Äôt feel confident about doing until I met him.

R then told me that he felt that he still had big emotional wounds from his ex and it would be detrimental for the both of us if we continued on since we both weren‚Äôt emotionally secure. He told me that he didn‚Äôt know how long it would take for him to fully heal and that I deserved someone who was more emotionally stable.

I was upset and hurt that he didn‚Äôt think I would stay with him while we figure things out but he said that it‚Äôs selfish of him to want that and unfair for me to do so.

R said that we could still be friends but I really couldn‚Äôt see him any differently at this point because I like him too much. He said he has also fallen so deeply for me and that‚Äôs why he had to do this so that we don‚Äôt hurt each other more in the long run. I told him I needed time to think about it and he complied. He sent me home but I think we both found it hard to let the other person leave. It‚Äôs scary not knowing what‚Äôs going to happen next for the both of us.

I haven‚Äôt talked to him since and he‚Äôs given me space to process my feelings. I‚Äôm the type of person that has to bury someone (metaphorically) if we stop seeing each other because it‚Äôs just easier to get over my feelings when they‚Äôre out of sight. But R is a great guy even with flaws and all and I really don‚Äôt want to lose him. I know that if I agree to be just friends, I‚Äôd have to draw my boundaries with him but I‚Äôm scared if it‚Äôd cause me to regress instead and undo all the growth I‚Äôve gone through‚Ä¶

I thought this kind of thing only happens in dramas‚Ä¶ I try to deal with my problems myself but I‚Äôve learned that I don‚Äôt always come up with the best solutions‚Ä¶ Meanwhile therapy is expensive and I‚Äôve had some bad experiences with the therapists I‚Äôve gone to :( 

I really need real-life advice on how to go about this. Thank you! ü•∫

TL;DR Met a really great guy but he‚Äôs just fresh out of a 5 year r/s. We understand each other very well and have been dating for 4 months. He thinks that he‚Äôs not healed enough to be a good partner and tells me not to wait for him. I like him too much to keep him in my life and be just friends. But the past 4 months made me grow so much as a person and I don‚Äôt want to lose him.",1,1744433863.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

So yeah Hello everyone how you guys are is everything alright? I hope so I would like to tell you one short feel good story about a compliment that was not even a compliment so let's begin the story

So around 3-4 days back I went to school attended and It was a usual routine day for me so We have a school bus for our transportation but that day Something happened to the bus so we had a small school van(yeah the van which is for small children) that day so we were around 15 people jampacked in the school van adjusting and somehow seating ourselves so after school we were just talking about some random stuff so I'm a huge Telugu Movie Buff who keeps track of each and every upcoming movies and it's updates & I'm that type of a guy who is shy to talk to girls and doesn't talk so much so I have a friend who has a female friend not much close but at a surface level talking so He and she both were talking about something and They stopped for a bit of time (like there is nothing else to talk) so I told him about the details of a newly announced movie which had a bit of inside information(for them not for one's who follow Telugu Cinema regularly) that I knew also so she heard it and she was like ""Wow You know so much about everything in the movie industry do you have a plan to get into it"" and he was like ""it's his hobby to collect info about movies"" and he also said her like ""It's like not just hobby but like a Proper Cult fanism and love for movies and TFI"" and She was a bit of impressed by my knowledge about Telugu Cinema(I don't even know but I'm assuming) and Meanwhile me avoiding eye contact at her and looking somewhere else outside and A Sense of Prideness is inside me I was proud of myself and happy he also compared Some kind of  my similarities with her he was like ""How you know much about coffees it's the same about cinema to him"" & Inside I'm just happy and that feeling like I'm the wisest and knowledgeable from you all and after that she got out of the van because her stop had arrived and after that we discussed about some Stuff about upcoming movies and all & I also got out because my stop had arrived 

That compliment which was not even a proper compliment is still running in my mind I might never forget this in my whole life 

Yeah It was actually intended to be a short story but yeah I wanted to express my wholesome feeling

It has been an unbearably painful few months with daily panic attacks and nightmares and flashbacks and ptsd. But for the first time, I‚Äôm actually feeling SO much better.

I want you all to know it gets less painful. It‚Äôs still there but it hurts much less. This week has been the first time where I don‚Äôt actually miss him one bit. I‚Äôm just coping with the residue in my body, and confronting the pain that had also existed before him stemming from severe childhood neglect and a history of other abusive relationships. 

Your guidance has been instrumental in my ongoing recovery. I am so beyond grateful for this community. 

Things that have helped me over the last few weeks:
- getting right out of bed 
- going for a nature walk every morning
- freedom tapping 
- crying and crying and crying. Then saying it‚Äôs ok, and then hugging myself
- putting my hand on my heart and saying I‚Äôm safe 
- drinking green juice and taking ginger shots
- weekly massages 
- nightly epsom salt baths
- biweekly EMDR
- being a good friend to your closest friends when all you want to do is talk about your pain 
- no contact - I changed my number
- not mentioning ex to anyone but my therapists 
- drive through Starbucks every morning because I didn‚Äôt have the strength to go into a coffee shop but this helped
- going to a coffee shop in the evenings to work on my laptop and try to organize my life or just read about abuse recovery 
- reading about manifestation and positive thinking to understand that rock bottom and pain is meant to push you to your next level and heal what needs to be healed

Let me know if I can provide any other tips. I know I‚Äôll likely still wake up with a panic attack tomorrow, but I want you all to know there will be progress.

1jx9gfj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx9gfj,Ugly teeth / Braces / Extra tooth,"I'm 16 if that matters.. sorry if this is poorly worded, I'm in a bit of a rush rn.
All of my teeth, minus my front ones, are pointy.  WHY? No one else's teeth that I've seen are like this.  They're so ugly!! Is there a reason for this? 

Next, I have an extra wisdom tooth coming in, on top of my top left one. My dentist said that if it grows in enough, she'll just pull it out like a regular extraction. But if it causes too much pain before then, she'll refer me to a specialist to have it surgically removed. It's only been coming in for 2 months that I've noticed and it hurts to chew on the back left side of my mouth completely already.  I was just wondering if it would be best to tough it out as long as possible and have my regular dentist pull it? Or go to a specialist?  Also, I'm just terrified to have it pulled out tbh. The dentist didn't believe me at first when I asked her why my tooth was coming in differently then the others and said that she wouldn't have even known about the extra tooth being there? But she worked on the tooth right in front of it? Idk, maybe that makes sense to professionals..? 

Alright and now,  I obviously have a gap in the top front of my teeth. I've always had it. My dentist keeps on mentioning that she wants to put braces on to fix it / fix my bite. I didn't think there was an issue with my bite because no other dentist has mentioned it? So idk what's going on.  
Also, with that bump of gum between my two teeth, how would that disappear with braces?

Is it normal for the first course of action to extract a tooth before attempting a root canal? My 12 yr old moler had a huge chunk rot out a couple years ago, when I was 12. (My teeth all came in a bit early.) And the dentist at the time did a filling. Well, the filling was causing me lots of pain. The dentist looked at it and told me it was infected inside and was coming loose, so the only option was extracting it. They had my mom come in the room and she had to plead with my dentist for any alternatives to pulling it.  The gal eventually told us that she could attempt a root canal but it wasn't guaranteed since the tooth was young. Anyways, she attempted it,  and wasn't able to finish. She told me she pulled 2 roots out but the last one (the big one) wasn't fully grown and was bleeding so she just put some medicine in it and did, what I think,  is a filling? I'm not sure on that. 

BTW I may be incorrect with some of what I claimed that the dentist said, we have a slight language barrier so sometimes it's hard for me to fully understand everything.  And sorry for it being a lot,  I'm not very educated on this stuff so.. but thank you!

Also, idk why my teeth are so yellow, sorry about that. I brush twice a day and floss every evening before brushing. I don't drink coffee or soda and eat moderately clean.

I‚Äôm 24M working at a big company. There‚Äôs this woman (30F) I‚Äôve gotten to know over the past few months. We don‚Äôt work together directly ‚Äî she‚Äôs in a completely different department, and we only really run into each other at the coffee machine or on the train (we live in the same area, not together, don‚Äôt get too excited).

We had casual convos now and then, but one time after a work event, we grabbed dinner together. At the time, I didn‚Äôt think much of it ‚Äî just two coworkers grabbing a bite. I filed it under ‚Äústandard post-event survival meal.‚Äù

Now here‚Äôs where things started to get interesting (and where I become an idiot):

During a random chat one day, I said something like, ‚ÄúWe should grab lunch or dinner and catch up properly,‚Äù ‚Äî the kind of polite, empty promise you make without meaning to follow through.
But plot twist ‚Äî a week or two later, she actually brought it up and asked, ‚ÄúHey, what happened to our dinner plans?‚Äù I was caught off guard, but I played it cool and invited her to this restaurant she had mentioned wanting to try.


Time for a side quest (and emotional revelation):

By this point, I‚Äôd already developed a bit of a crush on her. She talks a lot ‚Äî like, a lot ‚Äî and I absolutely enjoy it. She always has something to say, tells the best stories, and just has great energy. She‚Äôs beautiful, smart, and generally just a good person.
Honestly, I don‚Äôt catch feelings easily. My past relationships didn‚Äôt last long, and when they ended, my friends thought I‚Äôd be heartbroken ‚Äî but I was completely unbothered. Looking back, I think it was because I never really enjoyed being around those people the way I enjoy talking to her.


Back to the date (yes, I think it was kind of a date?):

We went out to dinner, talked non-stop for 2‚Äì3 hours ‚Äî she spilled the tea about her coworkers, past jobs abroad, made jokes, shared stories ‚Äî the works.
Then she asked if I wanted to go somewhere else. I didn‚Äôt even pause before saying yes. She took me to her usual chill bar, and we stayed there for another hour or two.
At the end of the night, I walked her back to her place and said, ‚ÄúI had a great time, thank you,‚Äù and she gave me a quick hug ‚Äî the kind you sometimes get at the end of a date.

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm conflicted:
I like her. I want to ask her out.
But I‚Äôm also overthinking everything.

I mean, I think she might be into me ‚Äî the fact that she remembered and followed up on our dinner plans, wanted to keep hanging out afterward, and gave me that hug (especially since I know hugging a guy in her culture isn‚Äôt super common).
Also, things like her tapping my hand or shoulder during convos seem like signs‚Ä¶ but maybe that‚Äôs just how she interacts with people? I haven‚Äôt really seen her talk to other guys the same way, but again, I don‚Äôt see her much at work since she‚Äôs in a different department.

I‚Äôm worried about messing up the vibe or getting rejected and then it becoming awkward ‚Äî not just between us, but with work being involved. That said, we don‚Äôt work together directly, so it‚Äôs not like it would impact our jobs. Still, office crushes can be messy.

Also, I‚Äôve never been great at expressing emotions ‚Äî I tend to keep things to myself and come off robotic sometimes. I‚Äôm actively working on it, trying to show more emotion so people can actually connect with me (and not just see me as the guy who says ‚Äúyea okay, thank you‚Äù when someone calls him smart).

So here‚Äôs what I need advice on:
	1.	Is it okay to ask her out, even with the age gap? (I don‚Äôt care, but I think she might.)
	2.	Do you think she might be interested in me based on what I‚Äôve shared?
	3.	Is it okay to date someone from the same company, even if we‚Äôre in completely separate departments and have no work overlap?

Appreciate you if you made it this far. I know I sound like I‚Äôm spiraling, but I‚Äôm just trying to be real here. Any thoughts would help a lot!",1,1744433103.0,Life,1,1.0,False
1jx9ei1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1jx9ei1/reality_check/,Reality check,"This post is made with absolute love, but it‚Äôs going to contain some hard truths, that may be tough to read when you‚Äôre in the depths of an episode, but please return to read if you think some kind yet firm perspective might help.

As someone with BPD, I know how hard it can be to fly the plane when we lose control and REALLY split. We become belligerent, rude, needy, angry, and a million other things. The pain we feel is real. There is no question about it. We have faulty tools in our brain that make it much more difficult to regulate and differentiate between right and wrong in the heat of an episode. 

Which is why when we are calm, we HAVE to put in the work to protect ourselves and others: build internal tools such as mindfulness, lowered expectations on ourselves and others, and a serious look at the consequences of our past actions. 

I‚Äôve put all my partners through hell. We may tell ourselves we want someone gentle and kind that always thinks of us and is as obsessed with us as we are with them. We want someone who understands and will stand with us in the fires of our worst moments. 

Of course everyone deserves a kind and loving partner, but let me tell you‚Ä¶ no amount of goodness can quell our rage and misconceptions if WE don‚Äôt put the work into ourselves first. 

Yes, we feel wretched pain. But no one should be free of the consequences of the actions and words we can be capable of in dark times. We may have BPD, but screaming insults, threatening ourselves and others, saying we hate our loved ones‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not ok. No matter how you slice it. 

Here‚Äôs a hard truth: we have a bad habit of playing the victim. Our childhood trauma shaped us and we just need to find someone that can withstand our storms, right? Then we won‚Äôt split anymore once someone shows us we are safe with them, right? Wrong. Obviously a good partner who is understanding and empathetic is important, but that alone won‚Äôt stop us from acting like complete douches because we make up scenarios in our heads. 

But all is not lost. It just takes a bit of toughness. We have to believe we aren‚Äôt made of glass. Do you really want your partner to walk on eggshells? Do you really want people to hold their breath around you because they are afraid of setting you off? 

I‚Äôve been a terrifying person for a lot of my life, and finally taking accountability, and most of all, ACCEPTING MYSELF has made all the difference. 

The end goal isn‚Äôt to stop having emotions or stop getting triggered. That‚Äôs going to happen. I‚Äôm human. But what I am no longer going to tolerate from myself is disrespecting my partner, my loved ones, and my own damn self. I‚Äôm not going to tolerate saying disgusting and horrible things to the people I love. I‚Äôm not going to tolerate devaluing my partner when he slightly annoys me. I‚Äôm not going to analyze his behaviour and watch for any signs of danger. I‚Äôm going to live. And care for his needs and perspective. 

Guess what. We are going to disappoint and annoy people sometimes. That‚Äôs life. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be black and white. If I find myself panicking that my boyfriend hasn‚Äôt woken up and showered me with love in the first 20 minutes of the day, instead of assuming he doesn‚Äôt love me anymore and become a needy, sad girl who picks an unnecessary fight, I‚Äôm going to breath, remind myself that he‚Äôs probably thinking about what he is going to do today, and then start myself what I‚Äôm going to do today too. 

If it‚Äôs a particularly sensitive day, I‚Äôll ask for a hug. He will give me one, ask me if I‚Äôm ok, and I‚Äôll say ‚ÄòI am now.‚Äô And then go to write in a journal, watch silly cat videos, or do some self care. 

Yeah, we were dealt a shitty hand with the emotional roller coaster we ride, but we also have a huge opportunity. We can overcome and become stronger than people give us credit for. Because we know what it is like to feel the way we do. But we can also know what it‚Äôs like to gain control and never let anyone have power over our emotions again. 

Keep on truckin. If you find yourself sinking into unhealthy patterns that haven‚Äôt helped in the past, relax. Take a breath. Do something good for yourself. Take time. 

BPD can make little things feel so urgent. Your partner say something small and seemingly hurtful but it sticks in your head? Have a weird gut feeling that they are falling out of love with you? TAKE TIME! Don‚Äôt rush to text or call or run to the other room to beg for reassurance. Reassure yourself.

Saying that, a good conversation with a partner being completely honest about your condition and how it affects you can go a long way. ‚ÄòHey babe, sometimes I feel really insecure about our relationship. I just need a bit of reassurance that we are ok and then I‚Äôll be fine. I‚Äôd also like to hear about how my condition affects you, if it has. I will sit and listen without judgement.‚Äô Now that last part, you really have to mean. They might say something that hurts, but if they are being vulnerable and honest, honour your word the way you expect them to honour yours.

And if they say ‚Äòbabe, of course I love you. You have nothing to worry about.‚Äô BELIEVE THEM. And keep those words in a safe place in your mind to call upon again. And trust that if they do fall out of love, they will tell you. Nothing kills love faster than never believing it is real. 

I have really hurt my partners in the past by questioning whether they still love me or not. Because it basically disrespected and disregarded all of the beautiful ways that they were showing me their love everyday: 

Making me coffee in the morning
Sharing stories about their day
Kissing me goodnight‚Ä¶

Love isn‚Äôt always grand gestures.

Anyway. I just wanted to vent and share and I hope this has helped someone. I‚Äôve just been seeing a ton of success in my personal wellness journey lately and you can too. It‚Äôs taken years, but by golly I am fucking proud of myself. And I‚Äôm proud of all of you. Keep on keeping on. ",4,1744433041.0,BPD,4,0.83,False

only within the past year did it occur to me that i may have said something i don‚Äôt remember that made her mad but since i basically blacked out, i will never know. i would love to hear any outside perspectives. for a long time i felt like i‚Äôd done something to deserve that.

Lots and lots of spirits both benevolent and not.

I've recently started up the tapes again after doing the first wave a few years ago. Even then I could tell they have a rather noticeable effect, such as the vibration and general sense of being physically asleep but mentally aware, I did not get far enough along to really reap any real progress. My reluctance to be confronted with malevolent entities is a big factor why I stopped the first time. 

So last night, I started the tapes up again. This is after doing a lot more research, reading the manuals/books and this subreddit. I'd like to thank everyone for helping me to realize that fear is counter productive and that by eschewing calm, loving radiance both inward and outward, there really isn't anything to be concerned about.

Starting with the first two tapes (intro and first tape) it all came rushing back. There were no vibrations, but I was most definitely mind alert, body asleep. My forehead felt like the pressure was painlessly increasing outward and still feels a bit ""inflated"" today. A general sense of calm washed over my after finishing the two and I went to sleep shortly after....

At some point in the night I awoke from a dream and I was mind alert, body asleep. I could tell my physical body was exhausted, but I also felt light which is absolutely opposite of how I feel waking up. There was a ""flush"" feeling all within my body, physically similar to when you're suddenly embarrassed and heat feels like it's radiating from within. At the same time, behind my eyelids was ""bright"" with waves and ripples of what looked like fog in a light blue, moving around in the way that milk does in coffee or food colouring in water. This is when I remembered the same milky effect happening last time I did the tapes too.

I laid there for a minute (?) and the visuals/sensation would not stop. I opened my physical eyes and I found it incredibly hard to peel them open, as if from a dead sleep, all while being mentally on edge. The intensity of the unrelenting experience made me uncomfortable so I reached for my phone to put something on to distract me (Golden Girls, if you must know). Even then, after having moved around etc., the feeling persisted. 

I finally fell asleep after who knows how long but I woke up utterly exhausted. In the moment it felt like if I had just leaned into it that something would have happened but fear of the unknown got the better of me. I don't think being yanked out of a deep sleep helped üòÖ.

But I **am not a quitter.**

So, I decided it was time to **break your mind.**

This is the story of **The Great Mirror Heist.**

# Step 1: Laying the Groundwork

Samantha has **one personality flaw** that I could exploit:

**She is obsessed with mirrors.**

Not in a vain way, but in a **‚ÄúI need to glance at my reflection at all times or I feel weird‚Äù** kind of way. Like, this woman checks her hair in any reflective surface‚Äîwindows, spoons, the back of her phone, car mirrors, even **my glasses** if she‚Äôs desperate enough.

**So I made them disappear.**

# Step 2: The Disappearance Begins

It started with **the bathroom mirror.** I took it down while she was sleeping. When she woke up, she went in to brush her teeth and came out looking **visibly disturbed.**

‚ÄúDid the mirror‚Ä¶ fall?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, pretending to yawn. ‚ÄúYeah. It shattered last night. Super weird.‚Äù

She frowned. **Suspicious, but not panicked.**

Next, I took **the hallway mirror.**

She came home from work, stopped, stared at the blank wall for a full **thirty seconds,** and then turned to me.

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the mirror?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat mirror?‚Äù I said innocently.

She **squinted** at me. She knew. **She KNEW.** But she had no proof.

# Step 3: The Psychological Breakdown

One by one, **every mirror in the house vanished.**

Bedroom? Gone.  
Handheld mirror in her makeup bag? Gone.  
The **tiny mirror in her wallet?** Replaced with a **photo of me smirking.**

At first, she was just **annoyed.** Then, as the days passed‚Ä¶ she started to **crack.**

**She tried to use her phone camera.** I set the screen brightness to 0% every time.  
**She tried to check herself in the TV reflection.** I taped a giant **poster of Nicolas Cage‚Äôs face over it.**  
**She tried to use a spoon.** I swapped all the spoons with matte black ones that **reflected nothing.**

**She was going insane.**

# Step 4: The Grand Finale

One morning, she snapped.

She **stormed into my room, wild-eyed and disheveled.**

‚Äú**WHERE ARE THEY?!**‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, the mirrors?‚Äù I said, sipping my coffee. ‚ÄúI threw them all away. You didn‚Äôt need them.‚Äù

She **lost it.** Screaming, waving her arms, full **feral mode.** She didn‚Äôt even have a **mental image of herself anymore.**

Then, as she stood there in peak **existential crisis mode,** I pulled out my phone and **showed her a live video feed of herself.**

‚ÄúCongratulations,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been living in a reality show this entire time.‚Äù

**She collapsed onto the floor in defeat.**

**I have never felt more powerful.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coffee is a beloved drink for many, but what if there‚Äôs a way to enhance your daily brew? Mushroom-infused coffee is gaining popularity, and it offers unique benefits worth exploring. If you‚Äôre curious whether this trend is right for you, here are seven signs that you might benefit from switching to mushroom-infused coffee.

### 1. You Struggle with Energy Levels

If you often find yourself reaching for multiple cups of coffee to stay awake, mushroom-infused coffee could be a game-changer. Many mushroom varieties, such as lion‚Äôs mane and cordyceps, boast energy-boosting properties. Unlike the typical caffeine crash from regular coffee, these mushrooms provide a more stable energy release, keeping you alert and focused throughout the day.

### 2. You're Looking for Immune System Support

Your immune system works hard to keep you healthy, and certain mushrooms can give it a boost. Chaga and reishi mushrooms, found in some mushroom-infused coffee blends, are packed with antioxidants that can strengthen your defenses. If you catch colds often or feel run down, considering a switch to mushroom-infused coffee might be beneficial for your overall health.

### 3. You Experience Digestive Issues

If you often experience bloating or discomfort after drinking coffee, mushroom-infused coffee might be easier on your stomach. Many mushrooms contain prebiotics that support gut health and digestion. This means you can enjoy the taste of coffee without the typical distress that can accompany caffeinated drinks.

### 4. You're Seeking Stress Relief

Stress affects many people, and if you‚Äôre looking to reduce it, consider adding mushroom-infused coffee to your routine. Adaptogenic mushrooms like reishi have calming effects that may help you manage stress better. Drinking a cup can not only warm you up but also help you unwind and cope with daily pressures.

### 6. You‚Äôre Interested in Better Nutritional Benefits

Mushroom-infused coffee isn‚Äôt just about taste; it's also about nutrients. Many mushroom blends provide vitamins and minerals that traditional coffee lacks. You‚Äôll get the benefits of antioxidants, vitamins, and immune-boosting compounds while enjoying your morning pick-me-up. Making the switch could enhance your overall nutrient intake without adding calories.

### 7. You Wish to Reduce Your Caffeine Intake

- If you‚Äôre sensitive to caffeine or trying to cut back, switching to mushroom-infused coffee can be a smart choice. These coffees often have lower caffeine levels while still giving you that familiar taste of coffee.

Here‚Äôs what stands out:
	‚Ä¢	Same burr set as the Mischief M40, so expect great clarity and acidity-forward brews
	‚Ä¢	Incredible grind consistency with minimal fines, especially for pour over and filter brews
	‚Ä¢	Doesn‚Äôt have a built-in battery, but it runs via power bank, which is super handy for small setups
	‚Ä¢	Think of it as the electrified sibling of the M40 hand grinder

What to note:
	‚Ä¢	The motor isn‚Äôt the most powerful‚Äîtakes its time and has a manufacturer-recommended grind-rest cycle (3 mins on, 2‚Äì3 mins rest), but honestly, that feels more like a precaution
	‚Ä¢	Not ideal for back-to-back heavy grinding sessions

I understand that this post is a lot to process and take in, pero mas maigi na maging selective sa taong plano mong maging life partner than settling for just anyone. After all, mahalaga pa din na intact ang mental health natin while we love.

Am I making everything up? Is it just in my head? Is everyone almost always in some kind of pain or discomfort? 
I'm really close to giving up on being alive. I just need to know if I'm supposed to suck it up because everyone else is, or if there's another explanation to my symptoms.

My labs come back within normal range, usually. Even when I have other physically presenting symptoms, my labs are still usually all within the norm or testing negative (for example, ana). If they are ever out of range, it's just ever so slightly and doctors won't look for more. I understand that blood tests aren't the only diagnostic tool. The feedback makes me believe I could just be making it up since everything comes back normal, but I'm still in pain. 

I have had pain all over my body (knee joints, hips, hands, neck, shoulders, and back are the worst offenders, itching on legs, thighs, and back) since my teen years and was told it was growing pains. I cracked and popped all over like a glowstick. The growing pains never stopped and eventually I was told they were normal because I was getting older (late 20s). If everyone including my doctor told me it was normal, then it was normal, right?

I get episodes of weird symptoms that would last anywhere between a few days to months and then disappear for years, or would be a one off thing. For example, between 13 and 14 I had grey/purple-ish discoloration on my thighs/legs. It lasted for months and started to itch. The pediatrician I was with said it looked like no concern and it would go away. It did go away after suffering through that itch, but I never found out what it was. No diagnosis was made. 
At 15 I had a black out. I felt normal all morning, suddenly I  felt a weirdly anxious (kind of like impending doom) so I stood up to head to the restroom and within 10 steps I was out. I had only a couple of full blackout/fainting spells since. 
In my teens I had my first episode of vertigo, which we didn't know of at the time. I was told I just needed to eat more. So my mother, just short of force feeding me, made me eat more.  

In my early 20s I admit I didn't go to the doctor's regularly. After hearing the pain that I was experiencing was normal or everyone felt some pain, I just coped. I'd wait longer to call in for appointments to see the doctor because eventually the symptoms would go away. My reasoning here was that it was probably not concerning since it does go away, and I can go back to my regularly scheduled programing.
I started getting pain in one foot, after three episodes of this pain I finally went to the doctor. It didn't hurt to walk on it, it would swell just a little bit, but it hurt when I moved my leg more than anything. During the worst episode I couldn't move my leg at all because of the excruciating pain it caused down my foot. Doctor suspected gout, we checked my uric acid and it wasn't elevated. We didn't check for anything else (pseudogout) but doctor put me on a course of steroids. I ate a balanced diet of animal protien, whole grains and plenty of vegetables including dark leafy fibers, didn't drink or smoke (ok, one time puff as a kid but never again since). I was working a job that kept me active and on my feet all day, as well as going to school. I was not living a sedentary lifestyle. Anyway, I immediately removed most of the red meat and offal from my diet after learning what gout was (doctor told me my foot and symptoms sounded and looked like gout), and adapted a low to medium purine diet. He said if diet changes didn't manage it, we could try sterioids. I didn't get another attack until I turned 30. It was mild.

I've had shingles three times in my 20s, without a rash. I always have a tingling/burning sensation on one side of my head and face and made sure to call this one in within 48 hours after learning what this was. Each time I was treated with antivirals.

Still in my 20s, I started to get migraine headaches but it ""wasn't as bad"" as my father's, so it couldn't be migraine, is what I was told. I found out when I was 31 that I did in fact have them.

I have horrible coat hanger pain, with at least two instances a year where I couldn't turn my head side to side for weeks (1-3). I went to physical therapy four years ago and I learned some exercises to manage my pain. I'm not sure it helped but I still do them a couple times a week on my own now. I had imaging done on my neck and back (no ct, no mri) and they all came back unremarkable. My dentist is the one who clocked the migraine headaches and suggested PT, she also asked me if I have any connective tissue disorders. I told her I have no clue what those are and she mentioned a couple. I told her I did have, what we as kids would call it, some ""double jointedness."" I was meaning to ask her for a referral the next time I went in but she ended up moving. I asked my pcp instead and they said ""nah, you don't have any of those."" Which I can accept because to be fair, I only know what I read in a few journals. I'm on the edge here of confirmation bias and feeling dismissed about chronic pains now. I don't want something to be wrong but I do want an explanation of my symptoms, even if there's no treatment.

I started getting positional vertigo (diagnosed as BPPV) in my early 20s. For months I just coped with the symptoms before going to the doctor because I kept missing classes. I failed a couple classes over the next couple of years because of these episodes, and I couldn't keep a regular job either. I felt guilty because it looked like I was faking it. I looked fine, and after finding the right position to lay in, I felt fine. I couldn't drive, I couldn't even stand straight during these episodes. 

The episodes of vertigo were coming exactly one month apart for the first year, all lasting at least 12 hours, up to 48 hours. The second year they came exactly two months apart, the third year three months apart, the fourth year six months apart, the fifth year I had only one episode, and from then the episodes have been unpredictable and without consistent triggers. I forgot to mention that year 1-6 99% of the time I just woke up with vertigo and nothing triggered the episodes. The latest episode happened when I bent over to put my shoes on, when I stood up I had vertigo. It lasted 12 hours. The worst episode lasted five to six days and I had a family member drive me to the doctor's office. They gave me two injections. I don't remember what they gave me, I did ask a few years later but they didn't tell me. Whatever it was it almost instantly alleviated my nausea. This episode made me throw up for three days, couldn't eat or drink anything because it just kept coming back up. BTW, I was prescribed meclizine all those years and it never worked. It made me sleep all day, and then I was groggy the day after. A couple of years ago my pcp said it sounds like I have meniere's disease rather than just vertigo. My doctor offered no additional treatment or support. From what I read, it seems that treatment and support is minimal to none anyway. 

Recently, I experienced a new symptom. This one was really difficult. I had extreme ear fullness for three months. I called for an appointment with my pcp because I couldn't take it anymore after a week. I couldn't hear certain sounds that well, but others (cars driving by, idling, the furnace, bathroom vent fan) were SO loud. I felt like I was on the edge of ending it. Before calling the doctor I took 5 days of antihistamines because I thought maybe it was an allergy related thing. The morning of the appointment the fullness was GONE. Doctor checked everything and didn't see anything wrong. Nothing in my ears, no redness in my throat, no draining, nothing. My nose wasn't plugged, no fever, no coughing, no fever. It was the same for the pervious week while I had the fullness. He said it might be an infection or eustachian tube dysfunction. Doctor prescribed me a course prednisone. The fullness came back two days later so I took the prednisone, it didn't help the ear situation but it did relieve my knee pains and eczema on my hands. I finish the course and went back two weeks after the first visit. Nothing changed so doctor suggested trying antihistamines again. I do that, didn't help. I gave up. It took three months for it to go away, but now I feel like my hearing isn't what it was before. I no longer hear the loud low sounds, but I noticed some people's voices are more muffled. I still experienced the feeling of fullness but nowhere near as badly as those three months. I've also had tinnitus since I was a kid. I asked doctor if the fullness and tinnitus was related to the meniere's during the second visit and they said ""no, probably not."" I asked if I needed to see an ENT or someone else and was told no. 

I went to see an immunologist to get allergy testing done a few years ago. This doctor was amazing, I didn't know I could get such detailed feedback from a healthcare provider. I went in for just something skin prick tests but came out with some explanations to other symptoms. Doctor said I had symptoms of MCAS, but testing for this is long and a difficult road. I accepted my fate and said I would bring it up to my pcp and see what happens (labs were normal). PCP also did some workups for autoimmune diseases and said something autoimmune would explain a lot. The autoimmune tests came back negative or without significant values.

I had a strange rash that would start on my chest and spread up to my face and down to near the bottom of my ribcage. I call it a rash but they looked like tiny pimples, singular in form, raised, and would start off not itchy. Sometimes they would itch, sometimes they didn't. It lasted exactly two weeks, went away for a week, and then came back. It repeated four times. I went to the doctor during the 4th time. I had told the doctor that I have a sensitivity to dairy, and I had also been taking clindamycin at the time. I asked if the rash could be from either of those, since I was eating a lot more dairy yogurt than usual with the clindamycin. Doctor shrugged it off, said it's possible but not sure. Did routine annual labs at this appointment, everything normal except some slightly above and below numbers that didn't concern doctor. 

I had a really bad case of covid three years ago and I've been really poorly since. I was diagnosed with dysautonomia (POTS, no specific type) half a year afterwards. I had episodes (couple times a week) of low blood sugar (I think) for a few months afterwards. Symptoms were feeling shaky, cold, confused, general weakness and unwell, sometimes clammy. PCP only said ""oh, weird."" so maybe no concern. After finding out what dysautonomia was it explained a lot of things I experienced before, but now it's way worse and more frequent (almost constant). The palpitations out of nowhere, low bp, heat intolerance, exercise intolerance??, and the presyncope...I sweat so much at inappropriate times. I have a really hard time doing daily tasks still, 2.5 years after infection. Climbing stairs in my home on a good day leaves me breathless and resting for a while. On good days I can take walks for light exercise. Some days these walks are easy, and some days I struggle to complete my trail (about 3 miles). When the weather is too cold or too hot (above 75-80F for me) my symptoms flare up and if I ignore them I will be in bed for days afterwards. I haven't been able to work for two years now and it's really getting to me. I'm not able to support myself financially anymore. I was able to work after the vertigo episodes became infrequent but now I can't even do light lifting without huffing and puffing. Last summer I was starting to gaslight myself into thinking I made it all up, that it was in my head. This dysautonomia thing, the chronic joint pain, the brain fog or w.e it is, etc. I tried to push myself and live normally but ended up in really bad shape.
Since the acute covid infection I've been severely fatigued. On the worst days I can barely wake up. It takes considerable effort to open my eyes. Sometimes it feels like my brain is on and working, I'm aware of what's going on but my body will not rise, my eyes refuse to stay open. Doctor told me no caffeine because of the dysautonomia and GERD. I do eat foods that contain caffeine such as chocolate, but I don't drink coffee, tea with caffeine, or energy drinks.

I think I had a series of unlucky happenings that put me in a weird spot for diagnosis. Now that I'm older the pain is just because I'm getting old. I don't think I'm a medically complex patient, I think I just missed the timing to ask about a lot of my symptoms and now it's so expensive and piling up so heavily (mentally) that the only reason I'm still here is because I have to take care of my relatively young dog.

Additional notes: There are no rheumatologist within an hour drive of me. Teaching hospitals are also over an hour away from me. I don't know that much of my parent's medical history.
I had one ENT referral, which was canceled for reasons I don't remember (early 20s). PCP doesn't think I need another one. I was ordered an echocardiogram at the time of the POTS diagnosis and everything was normal except for ""Tricuspid valve not well visualized. Mild tricuspid Regurgitation. Pulmonic valve not well visualized."" Doctor did not comment on this, and I did not see this report until just now. I'm assuming it wasn't alarming? I'll attach the measurements in the links.

I had one cardiologist referral, which I'm still waiting on 1.5 years later. My vit d dips under the normal levels in the fall and winter so doctor suggested to take 5,000iu throughout the season. I've been prescribed low dose muscle relaxers for the cost hanger pain but it didn't help so we stopped those. I'd say it made it harder to function because of how drowsy it made me. I've also been prescribed very low dose amitriptyline for migraine and I'm not sure if it worked, but I had the same issues with the drowsiness after waking up in the morning, if I could wake up in the morning. We also stopped these after a three month trial. In the last year my nails have become very thin. My feet are usually cold (since a kid), I wear socks almost all of the time. They turn grey/purple when I'm seated or standing in one spot longer than 30 mins. They even sweat when they're cold. This also persisted before the dysautonomia diagnosis. My hands aren't as bad. My eyes and nose are almost always dry. I use lubricating drops/artificial tears for my eyes. My ears have started to itch a lot this past year. Pcp didn't comment when he checked them three months ago. 
I am vaccinated. I get my flu and covid shots. I mask fully in public because I cannot get sick again, I can't afford it. I drink around 1.5-2L of water a day, with salt, as told for the POTS. Any more water and I will pop. Urine is pale yellow to clear in the bowl, sometimes cloudy, stool is normal and regular. 
On a normal day, I have about 4-8 hours of life in me. My body still feels extremely heavy and I need to take breaks between w.e I do on these days. I usually have 3-4 hours of activity, sleep for 4-6 hours, then another 4-6 hours of activty before going to sleep around 11pm-1am, waking up again at 7-8am.  On the rare GREAT days I can do all most of my housework and light exercise. My weight doesn't fluctuate even when I'm having flare ups and not eating as much for a few days, or a week-ish. 
Immunologist said I might be allergic to amoxicillin due to some symptoms I had when I had it before (only 1 or 2 doses). He said we could do a trial to be sure but suggested against it. This visit was months after the ""rashes"" while on clindamycin. PCP said we can try clindamycin again or use an alternative drug class when I need it. There are other pains but I'm not sure if they're a concern or relevant information at all so I'll mention them briefly. Eye twitch off and on lasting 1.5 years now. I don't think my stress level has increased, just the source of stress has changed. Again, no caffeine and I sleep a lot. Heavy and regular periods changed after getting covid, now light and off by a couple of days every month. Increased acne since getting covid. Limbs feeling extremely uncomfortable where the sensation wakes me up. It feels like when your leg or arms fall asleep and the blood returns, that tingling sensation but x10 worse. It only happens when I sleep on my back, and maybe only up to two times a year. 


I'm located in the US so I don't qualify for MAID. I think don't look unwell enough for more help but I also don't feel well enough to keep going. Coping was easier before the long covid stuff. Now I feel like I'm barely able to function. Any activity takes the breath out of me but resting for long periods of time also make me feel unwell. 
Can any healthcare professionals here can suggest anything else to look into? I have access to my labs and can post numbers if you need them, but like I said, they're pretty much in range. 


Edit: to clarify, I'm not necessarily looking for treatment for the chronic pains but if there is something then I will bring it up to my doctor. I think what I want is an explanation or something to come back saying ""yeah, you feel this way because of xyz"" or ""it's in your head and we have some pills for that.""

1jx900k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx900k,"Loco moco + chicken teriyaki plate @ Tak's Coffee Shop (Crenshaw, $$)","[**Tak's Coffee House**](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taks-coffee-shop-los-angeles) is a remnant of when Crenshaw was one of the [biggest postwar Japanese American neighborhoods in L.A.](https://www.pbssocal.org/shows/lost-la/where-to-find-remnants-of-crenshaws-japanese-american-history) The coffee shop is located in Crenshaw Square, designed by Nisei architects in the late 1950s but these days, Tak's is the only place left that carries a trace of that history. To be clear, the coffee house doesn't date back to the Square's early years; it[ was opened in the 1990s by Mary Shizuru, a former server at Holiday Bowl, up the street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaG9EQo0V54). It's now run by the Bravos who had been staff at both Holiday Bowl and Tak's but they've maintained various elements of the restaurant's original Nikkei influences, least of all in the menu which includes a slew of Japanese American/Hawaiian-influenced dishes like saimin, char-siu rice, spam plates, plus the dishes me and Ms. SS ordered. 

To keep this real: this is classic, old school, diner/coffee shop fare. No one's trying to ""elevate"" anything *but* neither dish felt that generic to me either. 

**The loco moco**: the burger patty was a little overcooked but that gravy, especially with the onions, was proper. Better than the typical brown sauce I've had with more loco mocos than I can count. Comes with eggs though, surprisingly, no potato salad which I'm used to seeing on loco moco plates. Then again, after trying the potato salad (see below), I'm fine without it. *Rating: 8/10*

Ms. SS's **chicken teriyaki plate:** the chicken was properly cooked and the teriyaki sauce wasn't the same ol same ol. I wish I had paid more attention as to what exactly was different about it but it wasn't my dish so I wasn't spending quality time deciphering it. The potato salad was a bit too sweet for my taste. *(No rating since I only tried a couple bites)*

I'm glad we went. I like this place's backstory. The food was fine. Total for our two plates plus a soda was $41 after tax, before tip. If I'm being honest though, for this same style of food, I'd sooner go to [Gardena Bowl Coffee Shop](https://gardenabowlcoffeeshop.com/menu/) (bigger menu).",20,1744431565.0,FoodLosAngeles,1,1.0,False

(I‚Äôm Hopeful, Maybe it‚Äôs just the Drugs)","Day one post op and I already feel like someone turned the difficulty slider on my body down from ‚ÄúElden Ring with a blindfold‚Äù to just ‚Äúmildly haunted meat suit.‚Äù That alone feels surreal.

Also, weirdly? My jaw feels different. Like my overbite backed off a little. I‚Äôm not saying I walked out with a new face, but something shifted. There‚Äôs less yellow under my eyes and for the first time in ages, coffee didn‚Äôt wreck my stomach. Not medically significant maybe, but spiritually? Huge.

Still no idea how much of this is post op meds vs actual decompression magic, but I woke up feeling more refreshed than I have in forever. Which, again, could just be the hospital grade sedatives, but hey, I‚Äôll take it.

Small update from the surgeon:
Apparently, the fascia tissue around my left IJV was insanely thick, you could say it‚Äôs like cling wrap layered 200 times. So on top of the bony compression, everything was being shrink wrapped and tensioned to hell. They released that too, so it‚Äôs likely my vagus nerve (aka the anxiety highway) is also breathing a little easier now.

That gives me hope.
Real hope.
Not the Pinterest version. 
The slow, cautious, ‚Äúmaybe I can live like a person again‚Äù kind.

I know day 3-4 swelling is going to hit like a truck, and then it‚Äôs months of scar tissue drama and ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt recompress‚Äù prayers. But for now, day one feels like a win. And when you‚Äôve been living in a body that feels like it‚Äôs shutting down, even a small win feels revolutionary.

I‚Äôm still planning for a second surgery on the right side in 6 months, but right now I‚Äôm just letting myself believe the next 12‚Äì18 months might actually be different.

If you‚Äôre still in the thick of it MECFS, long COVID, compression, whatever this broken body limbo is just know there is a way forward (maybe just maybe there‚Äôs something out there, I understand everyone is different and unique). 

It‚Äôs slow. Messy. Expensive. Unfair. But real.

1jx8y4v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jx8y4v,BEHOLD - the waterwraith cake!!,"SO!! I posted the other week, asking for advice on how to make this waterwraith creature from pikmin for my brother's birthday cake. Unfortunately I could not take everyone's advice and do a silicone mold, because I did not have the budget for the silicone üòî so I did pulled sugar instead!! My very first go at pulled sugar. 

The base cake is just a standard chocolate sheet cake! The filling icing is loosely based on https://www.sugarologie.com/recipes/american-dreamy-buttercream this recipe, with a homemade invert syrup flavoured with oolong tea and creme brulee coffee. I also added cocoa (don't ask me how much, I just eyeballed lmao), Turmeric, ginger, and a little bit of cumin - My brother's request was, and I kid you not, ""can you make it kinda dirt flavoured?"" And so I made it dirt flavoured.

The sickly green outer icing is semi-vegan imbc, with the majority of the meringue being aquafaba (+ one egg white. because it wasn't whipping up and I was annoyed. Who knows if it actually helped ü§î), pound of salted butter, and a little bit of vanilla bean paste c:

As for the waterwraith and it's rollers, he's made of rose pulled sugar, and his rollers are mini icebox cakes made w oreos and rose/citrus/vanilla whipped cream. Rose was the flavour he wanted the wraith to be if I had made it jelly, so I wanted to have a more accessible rose flavoured aspect other than the giant amongus-shaped lollipop LMAO

We put candles and dripped wax to look like the pikmin/their blood (from getting run over)! Obviously this is not my cleanest work BUT it made my brother happy and it made us laugh a lot XD tbh I think it's a perfect likeness, don't you? üòÇüòÇ

I'll be back in a few weeks with my birthday cake, which will be much much different from this one LMAO
