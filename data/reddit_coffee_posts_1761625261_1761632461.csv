1oi20ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/StocksTool/comments/1oi20ch/copper_nears_record_on_supply_squeezes_gold/,Copper nears record on supply squeezes; gold hiring booms; coffee stays hot,"**Copper is back near its record, gold desks are hiring, and coffee‚Äôs rally still isn‚Äôt cooling.** Rate-cut hopes and a softer dollar are giving commodities a broad tailwind.

Chart: [Commodities snapshot](https://s3.smartdeer.de/images/genai/mha63q3nlhbpkjpg9dc.png)

**Snapshot:**
- **Copper:** +1.2% to $11,094/ton, nearing its May 2024 peak; up ~25% YTD amid disruptions in Congo, Chile, and Indonesia.
- **Gold:** Trading firms (Trafigura, Gunvor) ramp up hiring and pay as demand climbs.
- **Coffee:** Up ~40% in August, holding near ~$4; November has been seasonally strong (+14% avg).
- **Macro:** Fed cut expectations and a weaker USD are lifting commodities broadly; US‚ÄìChina trade optimism adds support.

> Sentiment: üöÄ Copper = strong bullish | üìà Gold = bullish hiring momentum | üìà Coffee = bullish seasonality | ‚ö†Ô∏è Copper supply risk | ‚öñÔ∏è Policy mix adds volatility

**Why it matters:**
- **Copper** underpins EVs and grid buildouts; tight supply could keep prices elevated. Beneficiaries may include miners like **BHP (BHP.AX)**, but outages raise volatility.
- **Coffee** costs can squeeze or enable pricing power for **SBUX**, **BROS**, and **KDP** depending on pass-through and promotions.
- **Gold** desk hiring signals deeper liquidity and active hedging as investors position for potential rate cuts and currency moves.

**Backdrop/Context:**
- **BHP** projects global copper demand could rise ~70% by 2050.
- Coffee‚Äôs strong November seasonality meets already elevated prices‚Äîa recipe for choppier retail margins.
- A hawkish data surprise or policy twist could reverse parts of this commodity bid.

My boyfriend's clingy family is wealthy but depend on him for everything. I want him to set boundaries so that he can focus on our future and his peace.

Full post :

Throwaway because duh. I (24F Indian) am an analyst at a tech startup. My boyfriend (28M) is the director of operations at the same company. He‚Äôs smart, driven, and has a lot of charisma. He rolls up in a fancy SUV, his fits are on point and I have been told by other colleagues that his watches cost more than annual salaries of some working here. He‚Äôs private about money, but the office gossip swears his family‚Äôs loaded based on his mom‚Äôs FB posts about their holiday homes(yes, plural) and his sister‚Äôs hospital Insta flexing their charity PR. Nobody knows the full story I dont even know how these guys are getting readind these posts but the rumor mill‚Äôs always buzzing.

I grew up middle class but I always had big dreams. When I joined the company, I was crushing on him since day 1. He and I are both from the same part of a different state so I broke ice with that. I‚Äôll admit, I put in work with my best sarees, coffee break chats, asking about his startup ideas. It was subtle but it worked. We‚Äôve been dating fiveish months, and it‚Äôs electric. We stay up late debating tech trends, travel destination and business ideas. I‚Äôm falling hard, and I want to think he is too but I cant tell. We havent posted 'us' on socials yet.

Here‚Äôs the problem: his family is relentless. Everybody depends on him for everything but I dont think they need to. His mom calls constantly to talk about her socialite friends drama or family drama or redecorating dilemmas or investment questions on him. His sister (34F) who is married has her own hospital with her husband (34M) still needs him to weigh in on a lot. Why are you depending on my man for for planning YOUR fancy charity events and calling him on OUR date night to ask for updates. I mean, girl do something on your own and while you are at it ask your husband to do something too. Both of you are doctors who own a god damn hospital ffs!! Or just hire helpers like normal rich people and dont bother my man. His teenage cousins treat him like a substitute dad and they keep texting for homework help or expecting him to show up at their school events because their parents are 'not there'. I dont even know what this means cuz this is all that he'll tell me. I am guessing they are partying or travelling or both but your guess is as good as mine. It‚Äôs not just about money it‚Äôs emotional labor. He feels personally responsible for all of them. They are adults who should be managing their own lives and cleaning up their own mess. He invited most of the office to his house for a Holi party. His house is amazing, legit huge and decorated so tastefully. We were not yet dating. I saw him step away to take a 15-20 minute call from his mom. I saw him talking on the phone and he looked pretty upset and shaken. He quickly went back to stioc but now I wasnt sure if he was the same guy I see in the office. I mean hes a director managing a massive company, but he can‚Äôt manage his family. It shows zero boundaries and poor people skills which I believe is a huge red flag for our future marriage.

Here‚Äôs where I screwed up. At that party, I asked to borrow his phone to book an uber pretending that mine was dead. I was crushing hard and wanted to see if he had any other girls so I snooped a bit and I checked his messages. No girls as such all the names were too formally saved but I saw messages from his sister and her husband thanking him for the new Porsche he gifted her husband. Yep, a fucking Porsche as a gift to the already filthy rich. There were also messages from his mother and the cousins but he came back quickly for his phone and I had to pretend I was browsing uber for options. But I assume he bought them wildly expensive gifts too. I felt lowkey jealous because they all were chilling while I had to share my flat with 2 other people. At that moment it hit me. His top priority is his overly clingy family. I felt awful for looking but I realised he‚Äôs carrying their weight for some reason. All of them are independently rich, tech savvy and highly educated. Why do they need him for gifts or venting or for running stupid errands ?

I‚Äôm 24 and dreaming of a life with him in a big home with kids and financial stability. But if he‚Äôs bankrolling and babysitting his family then where do we fit? I‚Äôve been nudging gently by asking like dont their calls ever wear you out? I‚Äôll say it softly while cuddling making sure it sounds as concern. I‚Äôm just empowering him to be his own man. He pushes back with pointed questions like why does it bother me so much but I pivot to his work stress or how his family‚Äôs neediness drag him down and drain him emotionally. I even floated moving to the US, where he could build his amazing startups in Silicon Valley. I‚Äôve always wanted to live abroad and I found an attorney through a friend that mentioned the investor visa. He has the money for it and I am okay with moving so I feel it will be a great step for our future and his sanity so why not ?

But he‚Äôs getting testy now. Yesterday I hinted about his mom‚Äôs calls again, and he snapped. He yelled at me in the car and asked me why do I care so much. He said he will deal with this and doesnt need me to handle his family or feelings. He‚Äôs been distant since with shorter texts and no date nights. I try to dial up the romance, but I can feel him slipping. I‚Äôm not trying to cut him off from his family I just want boundaries so we can build something great together. He says that this is his family and they have helped him through rough patches so he feels loyal but this co-dependency is a dealbreaker. I‚Äôm not being ruthless I‚Äôm just protecting my heart. If he can‚Äôt see that his family‚Äôs reliance will sink our marriage before it starts then maybe he‚Äôs not the high-value man I thought he was.

Do you guys think I am pushing him too much ? I want him to be at peace and I feel he wont get there unless he is pushed towards it.",1,1761632235.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

Life has a quirky way of changing in front of you, sometimes for the better, sometimes the worse. You have so little control over so many things that it leaves a constant and pressing feeling in the hearts of everyone at some point in their life. It‚Äôs toxic yet also intoxicating. It can be the force that drives you to self-destruct, or break and go mad. It could even drive you to run. And perhaps then, as you run, an ornate grand wooden door swings wildly open in front of you. Suddenly! A hand the size of a bear‚Äôs claw, with the strength to match, grabs you and pulls you inside.
You are faced down a hall that seemingly never ends. You look around, only to notice that the grizzly hand and the door it pulled you through are no longer there.
Now here you stand, totally and utterly alone with no way back. As you stand in the humming silence of the dimly lit hall, in the distance you notice a red hue. You begin to head ever so slowly toward the faint light, your left hand gently brushing the lightly textured pattern on the wall. It helps you, gives you something physical to hold onto. It makes each small step closer to that crimson glare a little easier.
With each breath and step made farther down the hall, the silent hum from the entrance ever so slowly turns into a faint murmur, an inaudible whisper. You stop for a moment, digging your nails into the plaster as if to mark the rest point. You lean in, ear toward the hum, trying to hear the whispers a little more clearly. You close your eyes and listen to the whispers. You hold your breath to drown out the sound of your own breathing. You open your eyes; the brief added darkness lets the soft red brighten ever so slightly. You can almost see, almost, only just if you look right. What seem to be curtains? The hum, as you lean in, sounds like the soft whipping flutter of light fabric caught in the soft airstream of a ceiling fan. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I move once more toward it. I breathe, in and out. I blink.


Coffee?

A bright light shining in through the windows peeks and catches you in a blink, almost blinding you. Was that all a dream? As you shake off the sleep and try to escape from the comfort of your king-sized bed and organic silk sheets, you peer over your shoulder to see the digital clock say 9:08 AM. My eyes go wide, body leaping out of bed. You rush over to the blinds and open them. ‚ÄúI need to take a shower; I need to get ready for work.‚Äù
I hear myself say the words, but I don‚Äôt recall thinking them. I shake off the feeling and quickly run to the bathroom to take a fast shower. I try to halt my feet‚ÄîI wanted to look at that flower in the tree‚Äîbut instead, I get dressed rapidly and look at the clock again: 9:28 AM. ‚ÄúExcellent, I‚Äôve got time for breakfast.‚Äù I do feel hungry, but did I think those words, or did they just come? I feel uneasy. ‚ÄúShake it off; we‚Äôve got this! We need some coffee now.‚Äù I‚Äôm right; we‚Äôve got this. I walk down the hall toward the banister, looking out past a large chandelier of bronze and crystal shining a spectrum of colors. Pictures of my partner and our family‚Äîa little girl standing between my wife and me, our parents and siblings, our nieces and nephews‚Äîline the wall, a pictorial history of my life from college to today.
Looking at the pictures, in my body, I know them; they are normal. This is life. But why is there an eating feeling, like something impossible and important is being missed or forgotten? Am I going insane? ‚ÄúNo, I just need coffee.‚Äù I‚Äôm right; yeah, I just need coffee. Going downstairs toward a grand open kitchen covered in marble and redwood, everything seems to gleam and shine like a room made of pearls and diamonds, but again, coffee has yet to be had. I sluggishly creep to my beloved K-Cup coffee machine, quickly managing to bring myself somewhat to life with the strongest coffee and tallest setting I can set. After a few sips, I feel a little bet‚Äî‚ÄúWow, this Max caffeine from Maxwell House really hits the spot. I‚Äôm ready to take on the day!‚Äù ‚Ä¶tee, and I‚Ä¶ what the fuck was that! Shout! Scream! I think as commandingly and loudly as possible.
‚ÄúI think I might need some of the decaf for work.‚Äù
What the fuck is happening!? is all I can think as I try to will my body to do what I want, but I can only watch helplessly as my body moves through the front door. As I pass through to the outside, this shallow surface rips, a fissure in the center like torn paper. Into the deep black, I trip down.


Marks.

I catch myself. I open my eyes; around me is only complete darkness once more. A musky noir permeates the air, heavy and still as I stand and feel around. I can feel that I‚Äôm next to a wall. I run my hands up and down the cool, lightly textured wall, noticing an ever-so-slightly deeper indent with my left index finger. I move my right middle finger to the indent and feel that the nail matches it like a missing puzzle piece. I‚Äôm in the hall again, but this time with no faint glows or hidden whispers. No, this time I‚Äôm left to feel around in an eerie, placid abandon.
I hold on to the wall with my left hand and reach out with the right. I move and stretch out until I‚Äôm able to hold my palms on both walls at the same time. I can at least guide myself up and down. I can leave marks to note if I‚Äôm backtracking.
The absolute silence leaves an unnatural feeling in your mind; you hear all of you: every pulse, every breath, every gurgle and pop. Silence isn‚Äôt peace; it‚Äôs a reminder of how truly loud we all are. I can almost hear every crack and sparking fire of each nerve ending and brain cell with each movement and every thought.
‚ÄúFocus on moving, just focus on one foot in front of the other.‚Äù I have to motivate myself past the unnerving feeling of hearing the blood move in my veins and arteries. ‚ÄúJust step and slide!‚Äù I narrate my actions to myself with each new step and proceed forward, leaving a new indentation every five steps exactly.
Hours blur as I scratch mark after mark, each nick a futile plea for progress. Tedious, but at least it‚Äôs something to cling to.
As I feel for a spot to indent, I notice a line deeper than the other normal, textural grooves of the wall. I feel over it, back and forth. They‚Äôre all my indentations, each one from the beginning, hours ago. I run the length of the hall for as long as I can, my fingers flinging over the seemingly never-ending string of marks cut into the wall by my own hand, over and over, and over again and again. I run, and in my panic, I forget the simplest and most instinctual thing. I forget to breathe.
My heart beats at the pace of a drum roll. A shrill, piercing whistle cuts the noisy silence. I feel a warm liquid run from my nose, and I can feel myself in the throes of passing out. I stumble and find myself acquainted with the floor, almost drunkenly; we embrace like long-lost friends.
My head and chest are the first to contact. Maybe that‚Äôs why I see sparks of blue and white fill the darkness, like fireflies. The sound of my heartbeat and blood rushing fills my ears, a ringing‚Äîsharp, piercing, personal. My breaths shallower, heavier, I feel my hands shake, my pulse in my fingertips, a trickle of thick wet from my nose. I lie and fade into darkness, helpless, alone. I think one thought, not happy or sad, really, just curious: Will I dream?
Experience.
Everyone always hears about how when you die, your life will flash before your eyes. What they don‚Äôt tell you is that it‚Äôs like every event of your life is a movie, and they are all playing on the same projector in an overlapped mess.
I see my birth play out in all its messy glory, layered with my wedding, all my birthdays, and the births of my children, all at the same time. It‚Äôs impossible to keep straight. More than that, it all seems to play in reverse with a shrill sound on repeat, reminiscent of a skipping record and nails on a chalkboard. I want to cover my ears and turn away.
My eyelids feel stapled, my neck rigid. I am forced to watch this dilapidated recounting of my subpar life‚Äîmy mediocre birth and numb indifference to life played out before me on repeat. My hell deserved?
My sins, so benign yet so plentiful, that I should sit in judgment of myself with no witness to bear my testimony. No demons or mongrels to rip me apart or feast on my remains for eternity. Rather, I sit in silence and lament what should be said of a life wasted.
No, this can‚Äôt be my life unfolding or my hell eternal. No, this is my fear and panic.
I need to wake up. I must wake up.
Rip, tear, fight, FUCK! No! I can, I must!!
WAKE UP!!!
Break.
I gasp, my eyes opening to nothing. The musk from before is heavier, vaguely ammoniated and metallic, almost coppery. My mouth, acidic, dry, salty. The taste of blood and sickness causes me to cough and spit. My head, heavy, the ringing dull, fading in my ears. I come to in a puddle under and around me, of my personal messy design. Still pitch black but now cold, wet, and smelling of puke and piss. I wipe my face as best I can.
I slowly pull myself upright and feel the wetness squish with each small motion. As I sit, disgusted with myself for this whole new line of issues, I decide to get naked because it‚Äôs dark and I‚Äôm alone, which doesn‚Äôt need to be made worse by walking around in clothes I‚Äôm inevitably going to burn when I get out of here. The air is still and stagnant, and cold, only just cold.
‚ÄúI AM ALIVE!‚Äù I exclaim.
You‚Äôve no need to bleed or feel cold when you die. And I passed out, had a bloody nose, and a piercing headache. Alone, bothered, confused, and stark naked‚Äîall of these things I am, but also alive! I decide to myself.
The notion of not being dead overtakes me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive.‚Äù I sink and swell to tears, finally a rest from the dread that permeates waking life. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so happy to know this fact, one I‚Äôve often taken for granted without thought of the alternative.
Then a heaviness fills me. Yes, I am alive, but if I‚Äôm alive, then where am I? Who has done this to me? Why have they done this? What‚Äôs the point? My mind becomes crowded with questions I scream into the darkness.
Naked and afraid, I crawl to the opposite side of where I passed out to contemplate my next moves.
I sit in silence and wonder how to escape in a room where my most reliable sense is made obsolete. I decide to try and walk again, figuring the motion might help release some of the tension building in my shoulders and back. I stand up and stretch out as much as I can, standing on the tips of my toes to not let a single tendon remain unextended. I begin to walk, opposite the direction from before, I think, somewhat hoping the door I was pulled through would magically reappear.
‚ÄúWhat is this!‚Äù I say loudly, as if the darkness would respond, granting me some password to release me from this nightmare. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a room that goes in a loop but never corners? This is a dream? Hell? Right?‚Äù I say aloud again, hoping for a response from the nothing. The silence lingers; the hint of an echo whispers back. I scream and curse nonsense in vain hope of release.
I frantically hug the wall nearest to me, running my hand over every square inch of wall I can in hopes of feeling a button, a release, or a hidden door. I pace each side up and down for an eternity, feeling around in the dark.
‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù No lever or button, no push door or mirror. Just a never-ending line of repeating, lightly textured plaster over what I assume is wood or particle board? I knock on the wall heavily. ‚ÄúYeah, particle board.‚Äù I answer my own question, tired of no response back. My fingers deftly brush a seam in the wall‚Äîa door? Moving my hands over a small space, back and forth, for a knob, another seam. No, just more plaster.
Frustrated, I begin to slump down, sliding my bare back down the cool, lightly textured wall. I‚Äôm so tired now, and hungry, and thirsty.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here, but it‚Äôs been too long!‚Äù I speak to myself, finding comfort in the echo of my words, like another voice speaking in solitude. Excruciating pain in my stomach forces me to grip it and retch in agony. It‚Äôs more than just hunger; it‚Äôs dehydration, it is madness. The pain begins to subside. I blink; I begin to see, I think, light?
A weak but present light, only when I blink. I hold one eye closed and see the light. It‚Äôs not in this godforsaken hall. The light is in my eye. I focus on it and close my eyes, cover them, and press in lightly; a cascade of shapes fills the light, enhancing it. I feel myself get lost in it.


Famish.

I‚Äôm consumed with light, surrounding and beaming me away from the dark hall. As I open my eyes and lower my hands, before me is a great table draped and covered in white linens and lace, carefully choreographed with carafes of wine and water, with chafing dishes covered but billowing with steam that lightly falls from the tableware, as if to wave me over, enticing me to greedily clear the whole table.
Around me, the setting of a pasture clearing with oak and cedar and willows spread across the distance, tall, thick grass tickles the spaces in my toes as I take each step closer to the table. The sun sits low in the sky, giving the scene a romantic melancholy from behind the long, branching curtain of the closest willow.
Approaching the table, soft jazz begins to play around me. I remove the lids to the dishes: a scene of perfectly roasted chicken with skin crackling and golden brown atop a bed of glazed carrots and pearl onions, permeating with the smells of thyme, sage, and lemon. Below, another dish holds a slow-braised beef shank sitting in a pool of rich demi-glace, paired with roasted fingerlings and vibrant wax beans, and a carafe each of icy water and rich, aromatic wine to wash it all down.
As I eat, the scene of romance quickly becomes a gruesome horror. With every bite, I feel my hunger deepen. A consuming drive to eat all before me becomes a mission, a need. My lungs do not want air; my only desire is to consume all I see, ripping flesh from bone like a ravenous wolf.
The sounds of my gluttony drive me more, but with each bite, a scream, ever-present and louder, grows around me. Mindlessly, I lift a handful of chicken and bite down. The screams grow louder, more directed. With each bite, each chew, the screams overtake me. It clicks in me, and I can‚Äôt care; my hunger won‚Äôt allow me to. The food is screaming and crying to not be eaten, but I can‚Äôt stop. The chicken, whispering pleas of my name to spare the rest: ‚ÄúWas the breast and leg not enough?‚Äù it bleats.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my mind; it isn‚Äôt real,‚Äù I tell myself, unsure if it‚Äôs a lie or the truth. My heart weighs heavy with guilt as I lift a carrot, hoping the screams will subside. Please, don‚Äôt do this! We are alive! I hear one glazed baby carrot feebly say just before being chewed.
The water stays untouched, silent, but present. I can feel it watch my slaughter, judging, seething in its hate for being the only witness to the genocide of its family. I stare at it with each new bite and chew. The guilt quickly becomes malice and intolerance for the judgment of this odd life. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault I‚Äôm hungry; I needed to eat.‚Äù
The water does not respond.
‚ÄúSit there in silence, then! You didn‚Äôt beg me to stop or wish for it to be over, did you?‚Äù
The water does not respond.
SPEAK!!
The water does not respond.
Upon this final display of intolerance, I grab the carafe and pour the water on the grass at my feet. But still, the water does not respond.
With the table clear, the twilight lighting of this fairy-tale forest turns to night; the wind blows cold, and the trees wither and die. Dark, ominous clouds cover all but a sliver of light. The sharp crack burns through me, a clap and roar sound, and I am engulfed in shadow and fog, thickening like hot black oil, sludge, butt-matted, void of sheen. It fills my lungs, my sinuses; it‚Äôs so cold but burns my eyes. It swallows me. I sink, deeper, and suffocate. I feel my chest convulsing. I sink, I fall.


Rage.

I ooze slowly, then fall to a soft plop, like being shit out or born again from an asshole. I hack out the disgusting sludge, wipe my eyes as I gasp and cough, shaking the heavy air with every outburst, only to have it echoed back, almost mockingly. Lightly tapping the wall with my knuckles as I reach back, cracking and creaking my bones back to my desired level of comfort, most days.
As I regain my normal posture, I realize I feel full. My hunger and thirst, ravenous before, now feel satiated, stifled by the feast that appeared in my mind.
I can still taste the wine and meat with every breath. ‚ÄúHow!?‚Äù I cry into nothing. I begin to run down the hall, desperately trying to make sense of this nonsense place. With every seventh step, I feel the puddle I left from my panic before. With each crossing, a splash and squeak.
Though alone, each crossing brings me shame and disgust, coupled now with the perplexing guilt of feasting on sentient food that existed in my mind. With each crossing, a splash and squeak.
Though void of reason or physics, each crossing intensifies the feelings of loathing I bear upon myself. I question my reality, testing my sanity, testing my patience. With each crossing, a splash and a squeak.
Without sense, and within madness, I run, perpetually dripping sweat from every pore of my naked body, only increasing the noise of every pass, deepening my guilt and shame, but at least it is a sound outside of my own voice, a dreadful yet reliable racket. With each crossing, a splash and a squeak.
Upon this last crossing, the puddle, now pooled with a mix of visceral fluids, makes that fastidious, tingly noise as I step into it. I slip and fall, my head lying now within this pool of disgust and petulance.
‚ÄúMurderer‚Ä¶‚Äù
I faintly hear a whisper, not like before, yet somehow familiar, all the same unsettling. I shoot up, curious about the source of this new inhabitant that has entered my endless hall.
‚ÄúWho is that? Who‚Äôs there?‚Äù
As quickly as the words leave my lips, all remnants of the whisper are gone. Clearly, some joke my unconscious is playing on my subconscious, trying to convince it I‚Äôm conscious. Disappointed, I lie back down, forgetting the puddle of‚Ä¶ of ick.
‚ÄúYeah, I deserve this,‚Äù I say to myself, resigned to this purgatory.
‚ÄúYou deserve death, murderer‚Ä¶‚Äù it whispers.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real! You‚Äôre in my head. Leave me alone.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am as real as you, as real as the family you slaughtered before me in our pasture. You did not leave them‚Äînot one morsel, and hardly a bone. You drank my sister as you glared at me, unable to hear my screams and pleas. And when my time had come, I, ready to welcome my fate, was spared and poured at your feet into the ground‚Ä¶‚Äù it whispers.
‚ÄúNo!? How are you here with me? How is this possible?‚Äù I question through tears and fears of loathing and hate for my accuser and myself.
‚ÄúYou ran. I fell through the ground, through your mind, bone, flesh, and skin. I fell through you to hold you to your guilt and to hold you in place‚Ä¶‚Äù it whispers.
With that, the whisper becomes a banshee‚Äôs scream, and I can feel the liquid quickly cool and freeze to my hair and head, gluing me to the floor, unable to even move. I scream and shout and try to twist, but with every tremor, the ice hardens and cools, tighter and deeper, like a brain freeze but only in the back of your mind.
‚ÄúNo! No! I already have nothing here‚Äîno light, no clothes, and nobody else. I will not give away my‚Ä¶ my anything else!‚Äù I shout, trying to leverage back and punch the puddle of ice.
Nothing works for several hours until, in my desperation, in my stubbornness, I refuse to lie here in perpetual nothingness. I try one last thing, one last option that may kill me, but at this point, I‚Äôd welcome a death, but only on my terms. Those in no way include being murdered by sentient-sweat-water-ick seeking revenge!
I pull, trying to lift out of the ice. I pull hard, scrunching my body tight, trying to add more leverage with every yank, slowly and agonizingly yanking harder and harder.
The sound of hair ripping away is tolerable; the pain, though unpleasant, is all but a warm-up.
The sound of fresh skin tearing is faint‚Ä¶ soft. The tissue absorbs most of the sound before it vibrates outward. But as I pull harder and harder, I can hear each of my nerve endings snap like tension wire. I hear a soft gushing and feel a warm, viscous liquid deep down my neck and back. The faint smell of copper and musk begins to fill the air as blood slowly pools, warming the ice to release my head a little more, enough to add just the right amount of leverage to cut away the last inch of skin holding me to my prison. As I sit up, I feel faint and dizzy. I can‚Äôt see how much blood I‚Äôve lost, but I can feel it now by my legs. I decide to stand.
I lean on the wall to pick myself up, slowly inching myself to standing, wobbly but standing. I try to take a few steps forward, unable to keep any motion straight or even predictable. As I take a third step forward, I feel myself falling and compensate by moving my fourth, fifth, and sixth steps all at once. I crash through the particle board wall, head first.
Falling‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ so much more. I am escaping‚Ä¶ I feel warm, no, numb. I feel like I‚Äôm spinning, no, rolling. So free.


Truth.

Tumbling through the noir chasm, the farther I go, the less real it feels. The black becomes speckled. The speckles become brighter and dance a starlight‚Äôs waltz. As I shift in posturing, I see orbs of my blood falling together next to me. I watch these dancing vermilion spheres as they fade in and out; they break and form again and again and again, never quite the same as before, yet not really any different.
I posture to face away and am encased in a sanguine cocoon. The stars dance and observe me as I‚Äôm tumbling down the void, slowly drenching me and encasing all but my eyes.
My eyes are allowed to see, and oh, the wonders they witness! The stars before me rapidly approach as I sit still in time. My body gone! All that is left is the mind and eyes in stillness as I watch the universe rapidly age and decay. Through the decay, a new horizon, bright and loud, flashes in an instant. It looks like a sunrise; it encircles the horizon without making a sound: in an instant, around me and within me. Unfazed, I remain still and motionless in time. I see the universe again retreating away, the cosmos rewinding time and space in reverse. All is opposed from before; it becomes a point of infinity inversely set. Then, once again, bright and loud without making a sound, it blankets everything as the cosmos exhales. Time moves now forward, then inhales and retreats in reverse, again, and again, and again.
I look around at the stars and sky‚Äîdead, alive, neither, both. And I close my eyes, at peace at last. Beauty, no pain. No agony. Just clarity, awareness. Presence.
Bliss, yes, that‚Äôs the word. Bliss‚Ä¶


Lies.

The loud and jarring buzz of an alarm clock. I feel my feet and shoulders flinch defensively. As I peer from under my pillow, I look at the time on the digital clock: 7:00 AM. I uncover my face and stare at the ceiling, trying to remember what I dreamt. But as soon as I think I have it, it‚Äôs gone, like I had something but lost it. I think it was pretty‚Ä¶ A knock on the door catches my attention. ‚ÄúWhat!? Yeah!?‚Äù A woman‚Äôs voice answers from the other side of the door. ‚ÄúSweetie, are you up yet? You don‚Äôt want to be late. Better start getting ready!‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay, thanks, Mommy!‚Äù I yell as I jump out of bed and run to the bathroom to get ready, nearly pushing my mom down the stairs as I quickly turn the corner. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run in the house, Melissa! You know that‚Äôs dangerous!‚Äù my mom says sharply with a cutting glare, her hazel eyes seeming to turn black. I feel a chill in my spine every time I see those warm eyes turn cold. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I respond meekly.
I enter the bathroom and step up to see myself in the mirror. I smile at the reflection of a 7-year-old with short brown hair, hazel eyes, and teeth that need a good brushing. I lean closer to look at them more closely while feeling for the faucet. As I turn the water, I think I hear a faint whisper, but I can‚Äôt make it out. Daddy says it‚Äôs just the pipes begging to get fixed. I think it‚Äôs a monster trying to get out.
I run my toothbrush under the faucet, apply a dot of strawberry toothpaste, and brush my teeth‚Äîup and down, side to side, and all around. I make a little tune in my head and look around my reflection. In the back, near my room, it looks like there‚Äôs a faint red light‚Äîno, not a light, maybe a hue in the dark.
I shake it off. I spit, I rinse, I wipe my mouth.
I blink..

Hi reddit, I've been contemplating wether to post this or not, but now I think I'm ready, so I'm Female (25) and my family has been annoying me and asking if I have a boyfriend yet for the past few years, and every occassion the condescending comments would always come, that honestly pissed me off, every ""Oh Sweetie women like us should already be married by this age"" or ""I want to have my grandbabies before I go to heaven"" would honestly make me go insane.

My mother especially has been introducing me to men from her church, or any child of her friend, and I would usually just brush it off, but 7 months ago, something happend that was my last straw, we had a family barbecue and I was incharge of bringing the sweets and desserts, but cause of my job I could only buy store bought cupcakes and cookies, and my mother told me ""if you had a boyfriend you would learn stuff like baking you know"" and that made me say something I really regret, I said ""I already have a boyfriend mom, and for the record this is exactly why I haven't told you for 3 months""

The moment I said that I could see my mom's face drop, and my dad who was usually out of these conversations looked like he just saw a ghost, but then soon my aunt's and uncles started asking me so much questions like ""When did you meet"", ""When was Your first date"", and I answered all of them nervously, and I even had to go home early out of embarrassment.

The moment I got home, I then hurriedly told my best friend what happend, and she could clearly tell that I was anxious and nervous, so she comforted me but did tell me that it was a bit stupid, and to be fair it was 

Then the next Sunday my mom texted me at like 9:45 in the morning asking ""Sweetie, could we meet your boyfriend? I promise we won't embarrass you please"", I didn't reply to that message, but in the middle of the day she called me, and she asked the same thing but in the voice that so obviously meant we need to meet him now or else you'll be in big trouble, so I pancickedly said yes.

I then call my best friend half nervous half crying telling her what happend, and she then comforted me, but then she recommended one of her co-workers named Sebastian who needed some extra cash in the moment who would be willing to act the part, and I obviously said yes.

So on a Wednesday afternoon I met with him in a coffee shop, discussing what I needed and I also described my situation, and he just laughed it off saying ""I got this, just give me a storyline first"", so we did plan one out and I made sure to include some details I lied about to my family

And soon on a Friday night we were entering my parents house, I was half anxious and I was practically half sweating because of the nervousness I felt, but Sebastian told me it would be alright and I honestly can't lie, it went great, it felt real and my aunt's and uncles were convinced, even my dad who used to be all over my ex boyfriends seemed calm about him.

After the dinner, we drove home and we talked about how funny and dumb everything was, he then dropped me off home and we called it a night

And about 3 weeks later my mom planned a family camping trip and asked me to bring Sebastien, so again I texted him and asked if it was alright and he responded just telling me ""yeah don't worry""

So now fast forward at the family camping, Me and Sebastian Show Up, and once again everyone loved him, and after that I really thought everything would finally be okay and my parents would stop nagging me about him,

But oh boy I was wrong, my mom then planned an every Sunday tradition where we would do a ""Pot Luck"", and in my mind I wanted to die.

The first 4 Sundays were good, but by the 5th Sunday Sebastian told me he couldn't keep on acting for every Sunday anymore, and to be honest it was fair, but we just brushed it off, but is it wrong to say I started feeling a little bit of butterflies whenever he was there

But yes I know that it's wrong to feel things for him, so I invited him to a bar to settle things and just talk, but both of us got drunk, and the moment I woke up I was laying in a hotel bed with no clothes on with him next to me.

I quickly tried getting ready but he woke up, and he looked arround and he connected the dots, we akwardly tried agreeing that we would never speak of it again, but come on now I couldn't stop thinking about him

And one night after a Sunday Pot luck on our way home,he was a bit drunk and he kissed me on the lips randomly, and we did it again, so now my mind is in shambles, I don't know if we should make things official or maybe he was just drunk and I shouldn't think of it, reddit help me out please",1,1761631862.0,AITA_Relationships,0,1.0,False

Twice.","Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been thinking about sharing my story for a few days now, and I finally decided to do it.

On October 10th, I found out that my girlfriend - let‚Äôs call her¬†***A***¬†\- had been cheating on me. For the second time.

**Some context:**

Back in 2019, I went through a really bad breakup. It ended ugly, with self-harm I barely remember. I just remember waking up covered in blood with paramedics around me. Yeah, it‚Äôs messed up, but I honestly blacked out and never wanted to do that. After that, I spent about 8 months in therapy. It helped a lot. I started feeling alive again, and later covered my scars with a tattoo.

I met¬†***A***¬†on November 2nd, 2021, in Russia. We were living in different cities but met by chance while I was on a business trip. At that point, I already had a job offer from a company in the US, which I had accepted. I told her about it right away so she‚Äôd know my plans. She said something like, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how things go.‚Äù

A week later, she had already moved in with me in Moscow. Everything was great. Actually, more than great.

September 2022, when the mass military draft started, the company that hired me suggested I leave the country for safety. I did. For almost a year I was moving between different countries, working remotely and preparing for my move to the US.¬†***A***¬†would visit me every now and then for a week or two. Whenever I could afford her tickets, I did it without hesitation. Even though life was unstable, those short trips together made everything feel like a small vacation.

Finally, in May 2023, I arrived in the US. The rest of the team joined over the next couple of months, and by September, we opened our business - a food startup, based in Chi-town. Not sure i can post brand names here, so let's just skip it.

At that time, our whole team was living together in a big apartment. Later, I started thinking about how to bring¬†***A***¬†here too.

If she had been my wife, things would‚Äôve been easier. But since she wasn‚Äôt, I decided the best option was to get her an F-1 student visa so she could learn English and stay with me. I paid for everything - the visa fees, interviews, flights, Airbnb, you name it.

I met her at the Chi-town airport in March 2024. We lived with my colleagues for a while, then moved into a nice convertible apartment of our own.

**The first time she cheated.**

I never promised her some fairytale life here. I always tried to make it as good as possible, but things turned out way harder than I imagined. While I was in the States alone, I told her about every struggle I was facing, how tough it was to start something from scratch, to deal with money, papers, stress, everything. I never hid it from her.

We planned to spend New Year‚Äôs Eve together - fireworks, dinner, just us. But I couldn‚Äôt make it. Everyone from the team left town, so I had to do the yearly stock count alone. I finished at 3 AM. I texted her, apologized a hundred times, and she said it was fine. But after a week, I started noticing her location pop up in strange places. She said things like ‚ÄúI was out at a bar, bored at home.‚Äù (while I was at the office)

Once, I walked up behind her to hug her and saw some messages on her screen. She blocked the screen. I didn‚Äôt say anything - I trusted her completely.

Then, on January 27th, I was home alone while she went shopping. She left her old phone at home, which she barely used, but that day an iMessage popped up. It was from a guy named¬†***D***.

For the first time, my brain overpowered my heart. I didn‚Äôt open the message. I just texted her:

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs¬†*D*? Come home, let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù

She came home and said she‚Äôd been ‚Äúseeing‚Äù a guy from her English school - going to bars with him, hanging out, kissing him.I asked if they‚Äôd had sex. She said no.

I asked to see the messages or his number, she refused. And while refusing, she deleted the chat right in front of me. Then admitted there were nudes and dirty messages. She said¬†***D***¬†had a a luxury car and a business, and that it was ‚Äúsexy.‚Äù That she wanted to go to Tennessee in February because he invited her, and she‚Äôd tell me she was ‚Äúgoing on a trip with a friend.‚Äù

I completely broke down. But I had to leave for work, so I took some meds to calm myself down and drove off. I texted her, telling her she needed to think and decide what she truly wanted - not what her therapist, or I, or¬†***D***¬†wanted.

That hour at work felt like forever. Everyone was smiling, talking, and I felt like a ghost. When I came home, she read me some ‚Äúspeech‚Äù she‚Äôd written down, full of fancy words that meant nothing. I snapped. I yelled that I didn‚Äôt want essays, I wanted the truth, from her, in her own words.

She got offended that I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúrespect‚Äù her written speech. I said I was done and went to sleep on the floor in the living room, doped up on anxiety pills. I cried the whole night.

The next morning, I asked how long she needed to move out. She said a week. I told her I couldn‚Äôt handle being in the same space with her for that long, I‚Äôd give her two days. Then she said she could give me¬†***D‚Äôs***¬†number. I called him, he picked up.

He was shocked. Said she never mentioned me, that she was the one who initiated everything, and that his own wife had cheated on him once too - so his advice was to leave her. He even said, ‚ÄúIf you ever want to grab a beer, man, I‚Äôm down.‚Äù

When I came back home, I told¬†***A***¬†everything he said. Then I broke down again. She hugged me. Then she started crying too. She told me (and this is important later) that she¬†***‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know how to talk to guys without it turning into flirting.‚Äù***¬†Somehow, and I honestly still don‚Äôt know how, we decided to start over.

For a couple of months, I had nightmares every night, woke up in a cold sweat, barely slept. But things slowly got better. We made some rules: she‚Äôd switch to another English school campus so she wouldn‚Äôt run into¬†***D***¬†again. She agreed. But when the semester break ended, she told me she was actually staying at the same campus, just in a different class. She said the other campus had too many classes per week, and she wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle it with her remote job (she worked for a company abroad). I said I was against it, but it was up to her.

**The second time she cheated**

After that whole situation, things started to look better. I bought a car, and we‚Äôd go for drives around Illinois. Short road trips, little escapes from the routine. In August, we moved into a new apartment, closer to the lake, just like she‚Äôd always wanted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll finally get to walk by the water with my love every evening,‚Äù she said. I painted the walls myself, set up a cat net on the balcony for our two cats, and slowly bought furniture. I was spending more time at home, less time in the office. Honestly, it finally felt like we were settling down.

In early September, her classmate from school offered her a part-time job at a coffee shop. Since she only has F1 Visa (you can't work with this type), It wasn‚Äôt legal work, just cash, off the books, but she said she wanted to save up a bit and maybe we‚Äôd go on a small trip somewhere. It was important for her, and I supported it completely. She worked three times a week, usually in the mornings. I¬†drove her there every morning and picked her up after her shifts.

Even one day, the coffee shop was doing a big cleaning day, so I came to help. I met everyone there, including the manager. I usually like to meet owners or managers anywhere related to food, since that‚Äôs the business I‚Äôm in too. She also made a new friend at work. Let‚Äôs call her¬†***N***. At first,¬†***N***¬†seemed nice. I even drove them both to hangouts a few times or dropped them off at¬†***N‚Äôs***¬†place.¬†***N***¬†knew about the company I worked for, and she even wanted to apply as a cook. I helped her with that, introduced her to people.

Everything seemed fine. Sure, we had some small arguments here and there, mostly about money or future plans, but nothing unusual. Like once, I was talking to an immigration lawyer about whether it‚Äôs better to get married first and then start the paperwork or do it the other way around. I told¬†***A***¬†about it, and she got upset, saying ‚ÄúMarriage isn‚Äôt about documents, it‚Äôs about love.‚Äù Which was ironic, because I wasn‚Äôt questioning marriage at all, I was literally figuring out the most efficient way to make her stay here long-term. There were other moments too. I hinted about proposing to her soon, but she‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄúHow can you even think about that? We‚Äôre not financially stable yet.‚Äù I brushed those moments off. I really thought they were just normal disagreements. Foolish, I know.

Then came early October.

She told me she was going to the coffee shop on her day off, said she‚Äôd be helping them film some content for their Instagram. I said okay, see you later, we‚Äôll bake that apple pie tonight.

At 5 PM she sent me a quick video message on Telegram, saying she was hanging out with¬†***N***, they grabbed sushi, and she‚Äôd text me later. Around 8 PM, she said she was still with¬†***N***¬†and would call me in about an hour or two.

By 10 PM, I started to worry. I saw she was online, but not responding. At midnight, I finally called. She picked up and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at¬†***N‚Äôs***¬†boyfriend‚Äôs place, just chatting. I was about to head home.‚Äù But I could clearly hear more than one male voice in the background.

I started asking questions, trying to stay calm, but she brushed me off, saying, ‚ÄúStop overthinking, don‚Äôt start a fight.‚Äù She sent me her location and said she‚Äôd call me later.

An hour and a half passed. No call.

When I tried again, her friend¬†***N***¬†answered, saying, ‚ÄúA‚Äôs in the bathroom.‚Äù I asked why she wasn‚Äôt home yet, and she said, ‚ÄúWell, she was going to leave, but changed her mind.‚Äù

When¬†***A***¬†finally answered, she said she wasn‚Äôt coming home at all because she didn‚Äôt want me to ‚Äústart drama.‚Äù I told her, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad, I‚Äôm just worried, because¬†***you don‚Äôt know how to talk to guys without it turning into flirting***.‚Äù She laughed and said that there are only three of them at the apartment right now - she,¬†***N***¬†and her boyfriend. That i have to believe her and stop imagining things.

At that point, I couldn‚Äôt sit still. I drove to the address she sent.

Both of them came out -¬†***A***¬†and¬†***N***.¬†***A***¬†smelled like alcohol, eyes glassy. She got in the car, and before I could say a word, she said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre imagining things again. You always make up stories in your head.‚Äù I asked for her phone. She gave it to me, pretending to cooperate. There were no videos from the ‚Äúcoffee shop content‚Äù she said she was filming that morning. I checked her deleted messages, there was one chat with an unknown number. Before I could open it, she snatched the phone out of my hands.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt matters to me,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúIf you refuse to show me, it‚Äôs over.‚Äù

She said, ‚ÄúThen I guess it‚Äôs over.‚Äù

I said I‚Äôd move out from the our apartment within a week. She looked surprised that I was the one leaving. Then she shrugged and said ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù and got out of the car.

I was shaking. Angry, broken, humiliated. I slammed the gas, drove a few blocks, then stopped. I caught myself thinking that I don‚Äôt want to go down that same dark road I once did. I want to live. I want to move forward, no matter how much it hurts.

I drove home, took some sleeping pills, and passed out for a couple of hours.

The next morning, I checked her Instagram. She had followed a tattoo artist, and he followed her back. Let‚Äôs call him¬†***P***. So I texted him:

‚ÄúHey, I think we should talk.‚Äù

He called me. On the call were both¬†***P***¬†and¬†***N's***¬†boyfriend. I told them I wasn‚Äôt trying to start drama, I just needed to know the truth. That i'm not a mad person that imagine things, that what I suspected was real.

And it was.

They told me¬†***A***¬†had been saying for weeks that I was her ex-boyfriend, even though we were still living together, sleeping in the same bed, and she was still telling me she loved me.¬†***P***¬†admitted that yes, they‚Äôd been together that night. They slept together.

While I was still on the call,¬†***N***¬†started calling me nonstop. I picked up once, and she started yelling, accusing me of stealing¬†***A‚Äôs***¬†passport. I ignored it and asked her why they‚Äôd been telling everyone that I was¬†***A‚Äôs***¬†ex.‚Äù She mocked me, laughed, called me names. What was I even expecting? I pulled myself together, told her I had no idea where her passport was, and wished her a good evening. And for the record - I really hadn‚Äôt seen¬†***A‚Äôs***¬†passport.

I packed up everything within three days. I bought three months‚Äô worth of food for the cats, took everything that I‚Äôd ever bought, and left.

Now I‚Äôm staying in my office. My friends offered me to stay at their places, but I want to go through this alone. I don‚Äôt want anyone to see me like this. Numb, drained and hollow.

I blocked¬†***A***¬†everywhere. Haven‚Äôt texted her, haven‚Äôt checked her social media. I‚Äôm doing therapy online.

It‚Äôs been two weeks now. I still feel completely empty.

I can‚Äôt eat. I can‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt focus.

*You do everything to bring someone to a new life, forgive them once, love them anyway. You even save up for a ring in secret, plan to propose on your anniversary - November 2nd. You pick the perfect place, the one she always dreamed about.*

And the one question that keeps spinning in my head is:¬†**how**?

How can someone you gave everything to - your heart, your trust, your home, just switch off and destroy it all overnight? How can you ""not care"" like there was nothing between us? Like I'm a stranger? How can someone call this love? How do you pull the knife out of your back and move on?

I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ completely out of strength.

**I wish we'd never met.**

Friends stuck in transitions. Coworkers questioning their careers. Gen Zs drowning in infinite scrolls. Millennials quietly panicking in decent jobs that feel meaningless. And almost everyone I know is feeling kinda lost. The scary part? They‚Äôre not lazy. They‚Äôre smart and motivated. But they feel stuck.

What‚Äôs worse, most of the ‚Äúadvice‚Äù out there is either spiritual fluff or hustle culture nonsense. TikTok is filled with unqualified influencers giving surface-level tips like ‚Äúwake up at 5am‚Äù or ‚Äúcut off toxic people.‚Äù Sure, sounds cool. But nothing changes.

So I went deep. Books, podcasts, neuroscience lectures, psychology research. What actually helps people rebuild clarity, motivation, and direction? What‚Äôs the smallest step that *actually* changes your life trajectory?

The simplest answer: **one chapter a day**. Seriously. One good chapter a day can rewire your brain more than most coaching programs.

Here‚Äôs everything you need to know to make it work.

*Start with high-quality input. Because your mental diet shapes your identity.*

* **Neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman** explained in his podcast that regular exposure to structured learning (reading, lectures, deep podcasts) increases dopamine baseline. Basically, your brain starts craving effort and complexity instead of noise and distraction.
  * Reading just 10 pages a day of a challenging book activates your prefrontal cortex more than passive scrolling, according to Columbia University‚Äôs Learning Lab reports.
  * Learning builds *agency*. Dopamine teaches your brain, ‚ÄúMy actions make the world change.‚Äù That‚Äôs the opposite of depression, which silently trains, ‚ÄúNothing I do matters.‚Äù

* **Start with identity-shaping reads. Not escape books.** You don‚Äôt need fluffy productivity porn or life-hack TikToks in book form. You need books that change how you *see yourself*.

  * *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. Not just about routines. It teaches you identity-based habits: act like the person you want to become. 
  * *Deep Work* by Cal Newport. If you‚Äôve been feeling dumb, scattered, or fatigued, this book will explain *why* and how to rebuild your focus in a world that profits off distraction.
  * *The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest. If your self-sabotage is quiet but strong, this one hits deeply. It‚Äôs not preachy. It‚Äôs clarifying.
  * *The Psychology of Money* by Morgan Housel. For anyone who feels lost around adulthood, stability, or building something long-term.

*Try the ‚Äúgolden hour‚Äù habit stack*

* Best time: 30 to 60 minutes after waking. Your cortisol is naturally high, your brain is alert, and your subconscious is still active. Perfect time to shape direction.
* Stack the habit with something locked in. Coffee? Morning commute? Gym warmup? Choose one brain-friendly book and promise to read one chapter *before* any social media input.
* According to a Stanford research summary, activating intentional thought early in the day sets your brain‚Äôs ‚Äúdefault mode network‚Äù into reflective mode instead of reactive mode. That‚Äôs huge. You stop auto-scrolling through life and start *choosing*.

*Use content that teaches you how to think, not what to think*

This is controversial but important. Most people are overdosing on bite-sized motivation. They need *cognitive frameworks*, not quotes.

* Listen to the *The Knowledge Project* podcast by Shane Parrish. He interviews world-class thinkers, mental models experts, and decision-makers. It‚Äôs rich. It‚Äôs slow. And it makes you smarter in a sustainable way.
* Read *Thinking in Bets* by Annie Duke. It changes how you approach decisions. Most people confuse outcomes with good decisions. This book helps you separate logic from luck in your life.
* Listen to *Lex Fridman Podcast* selectively. Long-form conversations with thinkers like Sam Harris, Naval Ravikant, or even Ray Dalio quietly teach you the power of curiosity and humility in learning.

*Routinize your exposure to long-form thinking*

You don‚Äôt need to finish a book a week. You just need to *touch* your future self daily.

* Use *Readwise* or *Notion* to collect and review highlights. This reinforces neuroplasticity through spaced repetition. (A 2020 study from the National Training Laboratories showed that revisiting notes boosts retention by up to 70%.)
* Schedule ‚Äúreading anchors.‚Äù Every Sunday morning? During lunch break? After gym? The less emotional friction, the better.
* Don‚Äôt over-plan. Just track your streak. 1 chapter a day = 365 chapters a year. That‚Äôs 20+ solid books. That‚Äôs more than 99% of people.

*Don‚Äôt chase motivation. Build standards*

One of the biggest lies on the internet is that lost people need motivation. They don‚Äôt. They need structure and frictionless access to better input.

* Set a ‚Äúminimum viable dose.‚Äù 1 chapter. 1 podcast. 10 minutes daily. That‚Äôs it.
* Environment beats willpower. Put your book by your coffee. Preload podcasts into your queue. Delete apps that suck your attention before you‚Äôre fully awake.
* Neuroscience from Dr. Ethan Kross (author of *Chatter*, University of Michigan) found that ‚Äúmental time travel‚Äù via reflective reading lowers cortisol and sharpens future planning. Lost people don‚Äôt need a 5-year plan. They need to imagine tomorrow with more clarity.

*Avoid self-improvement bloat*

Too many people read 100 books and change nothing. That‚Äôs not wisdom. That‚Äôs digital hoarding. You need *integration.*

* After each chapter, journal 3 lines:  
  * What surprised me?  
  * What belief did this challenge?  
  * What can I try today?  

* Take 1 idea a week and test it. Just one. Don‚Äôt try to rebuild your personality in 7 days. Let the books work *through you*, not *on you.*
* Re-read the best books annually. The first read teaches. The second read transforms. As Naval Ravikant said, ‚ÄúIf you understand it the first time, you didn‚Äôt read a hard enough book.‚Äù

‚Äî

You don‚Äôt need therapy-grade breakthroughs every day. You just need better input. And with 1 chapter a day, you stack identity, cognition, agency, and clarity over time.

Knowledge scales. Mental strength compounds. And the smallest inputs shape the biggest shifts.

You don‚Äôt have to be perfect. You just have to stop scrolling and start reading.

So‚Ä¶ I did a little experiment.  
For 30 days, I committed to testing the **Fit To Be Pregnant Plan** ‚Äî and yep, I was skeptical too.  

But plot twist: halfway through, something wild happened.  
My energy didn‚Äôt just *improve* ‚Äî it **tripled**. Like, *suddenly booting up at 7am without the need for coffee* tripled.  

Here‚Äôs what surprised me most üëá  

- **No crazy workouts or kale smoothies.** It was mostly simple, science-backed habits that made sense once you stopped rolling your eyes.  
- **Built-in flexibility.** As someone juggling deadlines, cravings, and constant ‚Äúdid I reply to that email?‚Äù guilt, having a plan that fits instead of fights me? Game-changer.  
- **Noticeable energy spikes.** Around day 10, I started feeling steady energy. By week 3, I was running errands in a single swoop instead of needing naps between Target aisles.  

By the end of 30 days, I felt lighter (mentally, not just physically).  
What clicked most: it wasn‚Äôt about restriction ‚Äî it was about alignment.  

I realized energy isn‚Äôt something you ‚Äúfind.‚Äù It‚Äôs something you **build**, brick by brick, decision by decision.  
And this plan gave me the *blueprint*.

- Stop chasing extremes. Small, consistent action works.  
- Your body knows when you‚Äôre being kind to it ‚Äî it rewards you.  
- Energy is contagious. When you have more, the people around you notice.

What do you think about adding a small hook/loop just under the collar of the lab coat, designed so you could temporarily hang your safety goggles or mask there when you take a short break (e.g. stepping out to the office, grabbing a coffee, etc.)?

Recently started tracking water intake because my new endo mentioned dehydration can compound thyroid related fatigue. I was skeptical but figured why not try.

Been using a hydration app for three weeks, aiming for 70 to 80oz daily. Previously I was probably drinking 30 to 40oz max (mostly coffee, which doesn't count).

What I've noticed:

Days where I hit 75oz+: Fatigue is still there but less crushing. I can usually make it through the day without a nap.

Days where I fall short (50 to 60oz): Back to needing 2 or 3 hour afternoon naps, brain fog is worse.

This could totally be placebo or coincidence. But the timing correlates enough that I'm curious.

Questions for you:

Do you track hydration? If yes, what's your daily target?

Have you noticed any correlation with fatigue levels?

Does anyone's endocrinologist actually talk about this or is it just the generic ""drink more water"" advice?

I finally agreed and I went out of my way I clean the whole house, fresh sheets, bought men body wash so he wouldn‚Äôt have to smell like a girl.

I‚Äôm not sure this will work and he said I promise I will do anything to reassure you and fix this. Instead he talked to me less and I took the hint.

I told him he did the opposite of fixing it and he just sorta disappeared and came back. Long story short he said I was harsh and that he was going through something. I told him he should have communicated that, his excuse I don‚Äôt want to tell you family problems. I stuck to my guns and said the time has passed but I‚Äôm glad he is making things work. After 4 months of living in my city he tried the entire time, trying to get with me. Week where he would talk non stop than nothing from him. He ask for help while moving in a tried to help but made it clear only as a friend, but he didn‚Äôt give up. And after the 4 months I decided to look pass the past and give it a chance. After all my feelings for him never left and couldn‚Äôt stop thinking of him and how he was doing. We went out to eat hang out and after 2 weeks of that he ask me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. He was thrilled, the relationship was amazing so I thought. He brought things that wouldn‚Äôt happen till very far In The future but good to discuss and we just align very well. We had difference in religion but honestly I wanted to learn more about his before I tell him ‚Äú I‚Äôll convert in The future‚Äù but I never got the chance to say that. Like I said everything was great the sex, the communication, small disagreement were talked over and fix, what we wanted in life. And I will go into detail but not this first post. So imagine my surprise when one Tuesday around 2 pm I get a text saying ‚Äú I love you but we need to talk‚Äù . I couldn‚Äôt work so I left work talk to him the entire way trying to understand.

Diwali time, and Delhi as usual was buzzing with lights and stores that sell sweets and all. It was usual for such a time to see new people and new stores mushrooming all around. So, at first, I didn't think much about a chaacha (a septuagenarian wearing a faded white baniyan and lungi) who opened a makeshift stall just outside the gates of Lodhi, just an odd 200m or something from my place. 

I had bought a packet of sweets from him. I don't like sweets, but I bought nonetheless and shared it among my house staff. 

Diwali came and gone. Lights were coming down from offices and houses, people were returning back from the holidays, their faces sullen. 

Chaacha was still there, trying to sell his Diwali sweets. Nobody had bought anything from them. The people of Delhi, at least those of my neighbourhood prefer the legacy shops over at Gole market. Maybe he needed to sell them all before he could go home to his family for Diwali. But Diwali had come and gone, and he was still there

So the other day, I bought two more packets of sweets from him. I gave him some extra too. You can call it a prick of privilege or something. He smiled and said he doesn't need that. I insisted. He refused. As I was leaving he raised his hand and said ""jeete raho beti""...

As I reached my home, my maid while giving my usual evening coffee asked: ""ma'am, should I arrange for the lights to be taken down?""

Would I have been pretending if I had said no?

hey, I am looking for someone to go out on the Halloween night in Bangalore

about me: early 30s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. into photography, 3d design and small web/homelab projects. i‚Äôve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i‚Äôm new to dating but ready to try.

why i‚Äôm here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i‚Äôm looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i‚Äôm like:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk

loyal, not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills

what i‚Äôm looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don‚Äôt have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i‚Äôll respect your worldview and i‚Äôm looking for someone who‚Äôll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won‚Äôt match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm after.

last thing: i‚Äôd rather hear ‚Äúhey this isn‚Äôt a vibe‚Äù than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion.

if this feels like your vibe, say hi and tell me one of these: fav cafe, ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can‚Äôt stop replaying. reply or dm, no pressure.

When I first started drinking green coffee, I thought it would work like magic; just swap my regular coffee, and the weight would melt away. But over time, I realised that how you use it matters just as much as using it at all. Green coffee isn‚Äôt a quick fix; it‚Äôs a support tool that works best when your lifestyle aligns with it.

One common mistake is expecting instant results. Green coffee helps improve metabolism, but only when paired with balanced meals and movement.¬†

Another is overconsumption; drinking it multiple times a day can cause acidity or disrupt sleep. I also learnt not to rely on it right after heavy meals; it works better on a light stomach, ideally in the morning.

Skipping hydration is another trap green coffee mildly detoxifies, so drinking enough water is essential to avoid fatigue. Most importantly, consistency matters more than intensity.

Once I started using it mindfully, alongside clean eating and walks, it actually made a noticeable difference not just in weight but in energy.  
Green coffee isn‚Äôt the hero of the story; it‚Äôs the quiet support that amplifies your healthy habits.

Anyway I‚Äôve been using my age and health issues as an excuse to slack off and get special treatment.

Nothing serious, I‚Äôm just looking to make to retirement without going insane.

So as far as they know, I‚Äôm deaf, blind, and on death‚Äôs doorstep. 

Well I inadvertently discovered another instrument for my repertoire‚Ä¶ 

Over the weekend, I messed up my regular DIY crew cut and ended up shaving my head clean.

Not what I wanted but not terrible but I never considered what people would infer from me showing up on Monday as a total skinhead.

On the clock doing my humdrum reports I overheard my boss saying to her assistant ‚Äúno wonder he‚Äôs been seeing the doctors so often‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got cancer and doesn‚Äôt want anyone to know!‚Äù 

I choked on my coffee when I heard that and they realized that I had overheard them. I had to to go to the bathroom before I lost my composure, I went in, closed the door and turned on the faucet and muffled my hysterical laughter with paper towels for a good five minutes.

They must have thought I was upset and crying because there was an awkward silence after I came out. Neither would look me in the eye.

After a while my boss asked if I would like to go home, I said yes because I I was feeling a little under the weather.

Now I know if I lie and try to say that I have cancer, I am committing fraud, but if I let them believe that I‚Äôm being stoic and not asking for time off, they can‚Äôt ask about it. 

But I can let them believe it and accept their largess when offered. The cannot ask about it so if it gets discovered that I don‚Äôt actually have cancer. I can honestly say that I never claimed to have cancer. They couldn‚Äôt say anything to me.

We were very excited to have a place of our own again (we have lived on our own for 5+ years other than living with parents for a few months between houses)

A few months in (we weren‚Äôt even fully unpacked) and our friend calls my partner saying he will be homeless if he doesn‚Äôt find somewhere to live ASAP. They assure us they will only need to stay for ‚Äúa couple of months.‚Äù My partner agrees to let them stay on the grounds that they 1.) get a better job because the one that they currently have, they do not make enough to live on their own. 2.) they save $ to get their own place 3.) it is only going to be a couple of months. 

We had lengthy discussions upon them moving in about keeping their room and bathroom clean, we live in the country and bugs and mice are a concern. They have been giving us a couple hundred dollars every 2 weeks to contribute to groceries and their usage of the utilities. They eat the dinner we cook every night, snacks we buy, etc so it‚Äôs fair and works out. 

Here are the problems:

1.) They are a slob. They don‚Äôt wash their hands unless prompted to do so and then touch everything in the kitchen, their bedroom trash can is constantly overflowing onto the floor with food trash, they leave food open in their room, spilled coffee on the carpet, there are empty wine and liquor bottles everywhere etc. We have addressed this gently multiple times and they promise to ‚Äúdo better‚Äù and never do. 

* We live in an old house with a 20+ year old AC unit so we leave the doors at least cracked during the day and I am the only one at home, I have said multiple times they can shut it if they wish, and obviously shut it whenever you need private time or whatever but if they don‚Äôt mind to just leave it open especially when not home so the air can flow it puts less stress on the unit.*

2.) They leave their s-x toys out where you can see them just walking past their room. Today, you could just plainly see a bottle of ‚Äúrelaxing an-l lube‚Äù on their desk and a pl-g on a napkin by the laundry. I am a very s-x positive person, do whatever you wish, yunno? However, I feel like just leaving these things out in the open is disrespectful- if they want to leave them out they have full power to shut their door. I have to walk past their bedroom to get to my office and for any guests that come over to get to the guest bathroom so it‚Äôs very uncomfortable. 

To add, they also leave their en-ma in the shower floor of the guest bathroom and leave the shower curtain open, so I am constantly rushing to shut the shower curtain when people come over. 

3.) They have been saying they will get a better job/put in apartment applications but never do. The question is always dodged, they say they put in applications but never call to check on them, will tell me they put in an online application to apartments that only accept paper, etc. 


My question is, WIBTA if I asked them to leave? We have no formal agreement or anything- they are not on our lease, they‚Äôve been giving grocery money very specifically not rent money we have specified to them multiple times that we are not room mates we are just helping them out, etc. 

I just feel like they are not holding up their end of the bargain at all and they are disrespecting our home and our boundaries.

Ever feel like you're running on an old, buggy operating system?

You wake up, and the startup sequence is slow. Apps (tasks) keep crashing. You've got a million tabs open in your brain, and your mental RAM is maxed out before lunch. You know you have the potential‚Äîthe hardware is good!‚Äîbut the software just feels... outdated.

I've been thinking about life in these terms lately, and it's been a game-changer. We're not just trying to ""be better""; we're actively debugging and upgrading our personal **Life OS**.

Here are a few ""patches"" I've been installing that have made a huge difference.

**1. The Morning Boot-Up Protocol.**
Instead of grabbing your phone and letting a flood of notifications dictate your system's priorities, try a new boot-up sequence. It doesn't have to be a 90-minute miracle morning.

*   **Hydration first:** Before any data (coffee, emails), input some water.
*   **One conscious minute:** Just one minute of sitting in silence or staring out the window. No agenda. It's like letting your OS load properly before you start clicking everywhere.

**2. Single-Tasking to Free Up ""RAM"".**
We glorify multitasking, but in reality, it's just switching between tasks very quickly and inefficiently. It drains our mental processing power. The fix?

*   **Embrace the ""One Window"" rule.** When you're writing that email, just write the email. When you're reading a report, close the other 27 tabs. Your focus is a powerful resource; stop spreading it thin.

**3. Install a Stronger Emotional Firewall.**
Life is going to throw ""malware"" at you. Setbacks, negative feedback, self-doubt... they're like pop-up ads for anxiety. Protecting your internal state is non-negotiable for peak performance *and* happiness.

*   **Recognize the trigger, don't just react.** When you feel that spike of frustration or doubt, just notice it. ""Ah, there's that 'I'm not good enough' virus trying to run again."" Acknowledging it is the first step to neutralizing it.
*   **Run a 'system scan' on your thoughts.** Not all of them are true. Which ones are helping you and which are just bugs? For anyone who feels like their emotional ""malware"" is particularly stubborn, having a guided plan to identify and re-route those negative thought patterns can be a lifesaver. I found **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** incredibly helpful for building that structured emotional resilience.

**4. Schedule Regular ""Software Updates.""**
Your OS becomes obsolete if you never update it. An ""update"" can be anything that expands your capabilities.

*   Read one chapter of a book.
*   Watch one educational YouTube video on a skill you want.
*   Listen to a podcast on your commute.

It's not about a total system overhaul overnight. It's about small, consistent updates that, over time, create a radically new and improved version of your operating system.

What's one small ""patch"" or ""update"" you've implemented in your own Life OS recently? Would love to hear what's working for you all.",1,1761628786.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

‚Ä¢and triggers in the present causing her to relive the past~quite litterally having flashbacks from things in present day



This causes there to be a huge theme in Georgias story being the innability to escape her haunting past.

‚ÄúI took all the darkness, and I ate it. I became it‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a lot of demons,a lot of nightmares in my past.And I had a choice.I could live in the past,drown in it,feel it everyday,be there.
But you have to live in the future 'cause the past will eat you. There is more to life than that hell.""

‚ÄúI survived this long by staying one step ahead‚Äù



She has a desperation for financial stability and absolute control over situations because her entire life,she‚Äôs never had it.
She‚Äôs been molested,abused,homeless 
and groomed her entire life and she wants to now be the one to ‚Äúcontrol the game‚Äù.

‚ÄúI wanna be secure enough to be truly free. I have always been fighting for what‚Äôs mine, running from things, just surviving. I wanna feel safe enough that I can just‚Ä¶ be free.‚Äù¬†

Her mom,her stepdad,her husbands and Gil are meant to be taking care of her and loving her unconditionally yet they don‚Äôt.There taking advantage of her when she‚Äôs vulnerable in ways that benefit their own means and not out of the kindness of their hearts.

reminds me a lot of Joe Goldberg and Love Quinn from YOU albeit a MUCH MUCH lower degree.
She treats everything in life as though it‚Äôs a battle that requires strategy,bravery and the ability to take action because her whole life has been nothing but a war and it‚Äôs all she knows.
You either the fight the battle or take off first chance you get.

Shes obsessive and calculated in trying to get what she wants (like Joe).

Pretty much anything to do with gaining money  and status like:
‚Ä¢the illegal poker game
‚Ä¢her committing robberies of stores and for cars
‚Ä¢her skill in shoplifting clothes and cafe tips
‚Ä¢convincing Gil to teach her about embezzling invoices
‚Ä¢organising Kenny‚Äôs will
‚Ä¢actively seeking out a ‚Äúdate‚Äù with Paul to get a job
‚Ä¢blackmailing Joe to impress Paul
‚Ä¢using the kids credit cards
‚Ä¢stealing from the school,the casino night and the mayors office
‚Ä¢gaslighting Cynthia in front of the entire town when nearly caught for embezzlement
‚Ä¢framing Zach for stealing to get into the neighbour hood club
‚Ä¢swaying the court with a DIY attire and relating as much as possible to the Judge
‚Ä¢and managing to easily get ahold of a phone in prison.


And likewise she‚Äôs possessive and impulsive in trying to keep what she already has (like Love).
Pretty much anything to do with the kids including:
‚Ä¢leaving Zions in the middle of the night over the guardianship issue
‚Ä¢marrying Anthony to get Ginny back from DSS
‚Ä¢giving Ginny the vinegar
‚Ä¢lying to Zion about the car camping
‚Ä¢cutting the breaks of off Ginny‚Äôs bully‚Äôs bike
‚Ä¢convincing Austin to punch Zach
‚Ä¢not holding Austin accountable for stabbing Zach,vandalising the classroom and dumping the coffee
‚Ä¢refusing Austin to go to therapy
‚Ä¢slapping Ginny
‚Ä¢opening Ginnys letters before she can read them
‚Ä¢calling the police on Ginny (a mixed race 16 year old) over a party
‚Ä¢throwing away food to spite Ginny despite not thinking about Austin
‚Ä¢and leaving town without speaking to Ginny and Austin despite Ginny having abandonment issues from Zion and Gil likely raising Austin to be an abuser like him (with him also doing the love bombing technique he did on Georgia to get Austin to trust him)



Furthermore her philosophy towards murder is that it should only be done to married men if divorce supposedly isn‚Äôt an option.
She married Anthony to get DSS to leave her alone and thus couldn‚Äôt divorce him due to the blackmail he has over her with them.And likewise she married Kenny for his money and thus couldn‚Äôt divorce him due to losing out on his will.
This is compared to her stepdad and Gil who were the worst yet she wasn‚Äôt in contact with them for a specific reason and thus could deal with them in alternative ways.

Honestly if it came down to it I really do think she would have killed Paul eventually.One wrong move from him and she likely would have taken him out in order to avoid a divorce and thus losing access to his mayor resources.Hell if she wasn‚Äôt on trial for Toms murder and the topic of divorce came up anyway I really do think she would have killed him before it went any further.

The exception to this is Tom as Georgia wasn‚Äôt married to him however Cynthia was.
As mentioned before Georgia‚Äôs entire life has been the people that are required to look after and love her unconditionally don‚Äôt and instead take advantage of her in her vulnerable moments.
This is the complete opposite to Cynthia. Cynthia actively intervened when Gil was assaulting her,checked up on her later that day and went out her way to blacklist Gil‚Äôs apartment application throughout the town.
Cynthia doesn‚Äôt owe Georgia anything,doesn‚Äôt get along with her at all and yet still went to save her,expecting nothing in return.
It was unconditional love and protecting.
Everything Georgias ever wanted in her life and everything she was meant to get and deserved was handed to her in one go by one women.
She felt EXTREMELY in debt to Cynthia because Cynthia had just given her,her LIFES wish.She see‚Äôs Cynthia‚Äôs main issue at the moment being Tom and comes to the conclusion to help Cynthia in the way that Georgia herself would deal with it if it was her.
You can‚Äôt divorce your husband? Murder.
She knows Cynthia would feel too guilty and would face public backlash over divorcing Tom and thus she tries to save her.
And even when Cynthia is mad at her for this throughout the trial she is still loyal to Cynthia,refusing to pin Tom‚Äôs murder on her even if it means Georgia herself would go to jail.
Georgia LOVES Cynthia on a LIFE level because Cynthia gave her the one thing that SHE wanted her ENTIRE LIFE.



Furthermore,Georgia has received teachings from Janie in the blood eyes being ‚Äúyou win more flies with honey; but if you get yourself a bee, sting first"".
Essentially be pretty and sweet and you get what you want from the world,albeit be ready for any possible consequences.
This is re-iterated through other lines such as
‚ÄúMen are visual creatures, so give them something to look at‚Äù and ‚ÄúFor a woman, life is a battle. And beauty is a goddamn machine gun‚Äù.
And as stated before,Georgia is DESPERATE to conquer the world and thus will play by its ‚Äúrules‚Äù if that‚Äôs what she needs to do.


This results in some heavy narcacistic traits as evident with:
‚Ä¢switching between Ginnys mom and friend when convenient
‚Ä¢ruining Ginny and Austin‚Äôs credit scores
‚Ä¢not giving up Ginny to Linette despite that stopping her from a life of poverty and ‚Äúcar camping‚Äù
‚Ä¢having constant conversations in front of young Ginny about not having money for bills
‚Ä¢dressing as Scarllet O Herra
‚Ä¢not keeping her guns locked away when there‚Äôs a 9 year old in the house
‚Ä¢invalidating the idea of therapy to her kids
‚Ä¢moving a man she‚Äôs known for less than 2 months into her home with her kids
‚Ä¢placing the burdens and responsibilities of her choices on everyone else (telling Ginny the kills were for her,constantly moving around etc)
‚Ä¢invalidating the kids feelings by saying she did hard things so they would have a good life despite the fact they did have a hard life
‚Ä¢cheating on Paul with Zion
‚Ä¢consistently keeping secrets from Paul throughout their engagement and marriage up until the last possible minute
‚Ä¢murdering Tom with two 9 year olds in the house
‚Ä¢not actively considering if Cynthia or Tom wanted the euthanasia/could say goodbye to one another
‚Ä¢overestimating her capability in covering up a murder seeing as how it‚Äôs never her who cleans it up always the blood eyes thus leading to her getting caught for Toms murder
‚Ä¢saying to Ginny ‚Äúyou think I never wanted to run away from you? 16 tethered to the house with a one year old‚Äù-‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my fault‚Äù-‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little your fault‚Äù
‚Ä¢lying to Paul about the pregnancy to convince him to drop the divorce and help with her freedom
‚Ä¢and sleeping with Paul through unprotected sex all via DECEPTION which is sexual assault

1oi0wdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/1oi0wdb/i_cant_get_over_this_crush/,I can't get over this crush,"First, for context, I'm 28 and never had a girlfriend, that's why I'm posting on this sub specifically. I also hope this isn't considered a ""relationship advice"" post, as there is clearly not a relationship here.

I started going to college nearly 3 years ago, at first I wasn't talking to anyone because I have always been very shy, but over time some people noticed me and started to invite me to hang out with them.

This has been my social life through most of my first year, just talking to this few guys and girls who were nice enough to include me, but during the last few months I began to take notice of a girl who I have only spoken to a couple of times, she messaged me once asking me for help with something about a subject and we didn't talk much beyond that.

I noticed that she didn't seemed to have any friends and was always by herself, and also she was wearing a shirt from a metal band which draw my attention, as I'm also into that type of music. So I began talking to her, and she seemed to actually enjoy talking to me, which made me really happy. Over time as I got to know her more and saw how similar our interests were and how well our personalities seemed to mesh together, I noticed how I was starting to like her romantically, but then summer break came (I'm in the southern hemisphere) and we didn't see each other for a couple of months, but I had her number so I kept texting her.

The thing though is that she stopped responding to my texts, in fact she wasn't even reading them. I thought it was weird and felt pretty bad about it, because even if she would turn out to not like me back I was still happy to have her as a friend, but I moved on, stopped thinking of her and even started to talk to someone who I met through an app.

Fast forward a couple of months summer break was over and we were about to start the next year, and out of a sudden she texts me again, asking me something about college. I responded politely but didn't think much of it, as I had already made my mind and thought that if she ghosted me through all of summer I wasn't going to let myself get attached to her again. She messaged me again a couple of days later, asking me if I was still going to college because she hadn't seen me, and I told her that I was going to skip the first week because I was still on vacations, but would return to classes after that. I also remember a friend from college told me about how he saw her all alone and I felt pretty bad for her, but I was still hurt about being ghosted so I was still firm on my decision.

When I finally saw her I acted pretty cold, I didn't even said hi to her. The next day though, she texted me asking if I wanted to sit with her, to which I agreed, though still a little skeptical, and although I sat with her I didn't hang out with her during recess. My friend however who was unaware of her having ghosted me and knew of my old crush on her, convinced me to spend more time with her so I began also spending the recesses with her, and I ended up quickly forgiving her without even bringing it up or even asking her why she ghosted me, I just brushed it off as us not being too close yet and her being shy, and because now she was going out of her way to spend time with me, well, it felt nice to feel wanted by a woman for the first time in my life, even if it was probably only as a friend I didn't cared.

It goes without saying that I once again began to crush on her super hard, way harder than before, even going as far as to stop chatting with the other girl because I didn't felt comfortable with it anymore when I only wanted to be with this girl from class.

Through the first half of the year we were together basically all the time, as we saw each other 5 times a week, would sit together in class and during recess we'd hang out and would drink a coffee and eat something.  Outside of class we would text each other and we'd hang out in Discord to play games or study together. I also got the impression a few times that she may like me back, but i was never sure if she did or only saw me as a friend, and I enjoyed her friendship so much that I couldn't bring myself to push for more than that and end up ruining it.

Through the second half of the year we were seeing each other a lot less, but wherever our classes happened to coincide we were still hanging out. She however began to respond to my texts a lot less often, it remind me a lot to when she ghosted me through the first year's summer break, but wherever we saw each other in person she was being super nice so I assumed there must be a reason for it.

The last day of class we spent all day together, and when we were done instead of saying bye and going our respective ways she wanted us to hang out for a bit more, so we went for something to eat and spend a good amount of time chatting about a bunch of stuff, then I followed her to her stop and we made plans to watch a movie through Discord in a few days.

There has been a few moments where I felt like I should have tried to kiss her, one was when I took her home on my motorcycle, and this was another one of them. I didn't because I wasn't sure about how she felt about me, and I assumed I'd get another chance, but this was the last time I saw her, it has been nearly a year since then.

After that she began to respond to my texts less and less, eventually reaching a point where she'd go for months without texting back. The next year I didn't saw her anymore, and later after a few months of silence she texted me again to tell me she dropped out of college for economical reasons, and that she hopes to continue eventually. This was followed by a few more months of silence, until she messaged me again to ask for advice with something, and then radio silence again to this day.

Yesterday I went to see a band that I was introduced to by her, and it made me think of her a lot, how much she meant to me through those two years, how much I wished she were there with me, and how I'm unable to let go of her. I'm also a bit ashamed to admit I kept looking at the crowd from time to time, hoping to see her there.

Honestly not even a single day has passed where I haven't thought of her at least once, and as much as I know it's unhealthy to keep this obsession going, I'm still clinging to the possibility that maybe she has a good reason for acting the way she does and some day she'll want to hang out with me again.

However what I regretted the most is not having told her how I felt, I felt like if I got rejected right away I would have gotten over it by now, but being left hanging like this not knowing if I had a chance or not makes it so much worse. When I think of how perfect this last day was to confess to her and how that thought crossed my mind, and I dismissed it thinking I'd have another chance not knowing that was the last.

Hell, I even dream of her from time to time. Most of my dreams only consist on me randomly stumbling across her, usually in college, and just hanging up and talking like in the old times. Yesterday I dreamed of her again but this time was a bit different, I hardly remember anything other than her being on it, but I'm pretty sure I kissed her in my dream. I think it's kinda sad how not even in my dreams we are dating, except for this last one I guess of which I don't remember anything of.

I don't even know what to think of all this, I know she has issues of her own since she had to drop out, but I feel like if she cared about me and trusted me she would talk to me about it rather than soft ghosting me. And I also can't figure out if she liked me but got bored of me treating her like a friend, if she only ever liked me as a friend, or if she never liked me in any way and only hanged out with me because she had no one else to talk to.

I don't even know what to expect out of making this post, I guess I just want to vent, that's why I choose that flair, because I have never been able to talk about all this with this much detail with anyone, and I feel like that may make me feel better. Honestly I feel really pathetic for still being so attached to someone who may not even care about me.",6,1761627977.0,ForeverAlone,4,1.0,False

Morgan, the Alpha's Daughter. Book 1

Morgan

I wake up with a smile on my face‚Äîyesterday was the best day ever. Last night, I had my Sweet Sixteen party, and Mom had organized it to perfection. I‚Äôm not a girly girl, so pink was out of the question. Instead, Mom used a few of my favorite colors: indigo and maroon.

From the tablecloth to the decorations, everything was in indigo and maroon. Only our Pack-members were invited, just like every other year. That‚Äôs how it has always been for any party we have‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs for me, the Pack, or one of my six older Brothers. Mom and Dad never invite members of other Packs. It‚Äôs an unspoken rule in our pack, one that has been in place for centuries, and I doubt it will change anytime soon.

The best part of my Sweet Sixteen was the gift from my family‚Äîa Harley-Davidson Fat Boy, custom-ordered in my favorite colors: black, indigo, and maroon. Even the outfit, helmet, and boots matched‚Äîblack with indigo and maroon accents.

The jacket fits me like a glove, and the same goes for the pants, both made of a sturdy material‚Äîno doubt at Mom‚Äôs insistence. My helmet is my favorite next to the bike because Declan made sure our Pack‚Äôs crest was airbrushed onto it, using indigo and maroon. A Wolf lying near a water shore.

The boots have a two-inch heel with every possible protection feature, and again, I know Mom was behind it. But I don‚Äôt mind at all. Dad made me promise not to ride my bike until Ashton taught me how to ride safely. I had to keep a straight face when I made that promise. If only he knew I‚Äôd been riding Ashton‚Äôs bike for six months already.

My name is Morgan, and I am the youngest Pup of Alpha Tate and Luna Giselle. Like I mentioned before, I have six older Brothers. Don‚Äôt ask me how our parents managed it, but there are exactly two years and one month between each of us. To make it even creepier, we were all born on the first of the month.

We all spent our first year in the same room since Mom wanted the nursery close to their bedroom. But on our first birthday, we each got our own room. Everything was prepared weeks before my Brothers were born‚ÄîDad made sure of that.

The day before I was born, Ashton asked Mom why he didn‚Äôt have a baby Sister. Mom told him, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt always get what we want.‚Äù He then asked her if she wanted a baby girl. She said, ‚ÄúIf I get a baby girl tomorrow, I‚Äôll be over the moon.‚Äù

Ashton and Dad had laughed their asses off, knowing for a fact that Mom wasn‚Äôt pregnant. Mom and Dad had been trying for another Pup ever since Landon was born, and Mom had been devastated when she found out she wasn‚Äôt pregnant a few months before that day. After that, she didn‚Äôt want to try again.

The next day, just after breakfast, Mom collapsed. Dad rushed her to the infirmary, my Brothers running behind him. From time to time, Dad felt the excruciating pain Mom was going through, and it took hours before our Pack-doctor finally came out to see him.

You can imagine the look on Dad‚Äôs face when Doc told him he had a baby girl. Mom panicked because nothing had been prepared for me, but she didn‚Äôt have to worry. Everyone in our Pack helped our Beta and Gamma females get everything ready. To this day, Mom still calls me her little miracle.

With Ashton being born in January, you can do the math‚ÄîI'm a summer Pup, born in July.

So, I am the youngest of seven Pups and the only female, but my Brothers never treated me any differently. I might be Daddy‚Äôs little Princess, but I‚Äôm not a spoiled brat. Mom and Dad provide us with everything we need, but if we want anything extra, we have to work for it‚Äîsomething we‚Äôve always accepted without argument.

I get out of bed and take a shower. As I wash my hair, I think about what to do today. Dad gave me the day off, figuring I‚Äôd sleep in after my party. And while I did wake up later than usual, it‚Äôs still early. First thing on my list‚Äîbreakfast. My stomach rumbles in agreement.

I grab my training outfit from my closet, even though I don‚Äôt have training today. I‚Äôll go through my routine on my own, since our Gamma probably isn‚Äôt expecting me. As I step out of my room, I realize something‚Äîit‚Äôs too quiet.

This is usually the time of day when everyone is rushing around. Dad hurrying out the door for his morning meeting, Ashton trailing behind him, and Mom calling after them to be on time for lunch. My other Brothers scrambling to make it to training, with Mom yelling for them to be back on time for lunch. The only one who never rushes anywhere is me.

But today, it‚Äôs eerily silent. Even our Omega isn‚Äôt in the kitchen. I am glad I can make my own breakfast.

I sit at the kitchen island with my meal and coffee, still wondering why no one is around. After finishing my coffee, I rinse my dishes and place them in the dishwasher before heading downstairs to the training grounds.

Every Pack-member I pass looks a little confused. I have to stifle a smile‚Äîlooks like everyone thought I‚Äôd be sleeping in today.

As I walk down the last flight of stairs, I see that Dad‚Äôs office door is closed. He‚Äôs probably in his usual morning meeting with his Beta and Gamma. It‚Äôs one of the few times during the day when his door is shut. I walk towards the back of the Pack-house‚Äîthe fastest way to get to the training grounds.

Again, I‚Äôm met with confused looks. And now, it‚Äôs starting to annoy me. Why is it so strange to see me up and about? Other than my party last night, nothing unusual happened and that means I wake up at a decent hour.

I shrug it off and get to training. The only difference today‚Äîour Gamma is a no-show. It doesn‚Äôt bother me. By the time I‚Äôm done, I‚Äôve worked up a sweat. Grabbing my now-empty water bottle, I head back to the Pack-house. This time, I‚Äôm greeted with smiles and ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äùs from those I pass.

The door to Dad‚Äôs office is closed, and this time I wonder what is going on. Normally, the door would be open by now. As I pass the Beta floor, I hear a lot of commotion, but I ignore it because I am in desperate need of a shower and want to be downstairs in time for lunch.

After my shower, I blow-dry my hair before braiding it. I decide to put on my light blue, high-waisted skinny jeans with an off-the-shoulder black shirt. I grab my boots to go with my outfit and apply a little mascara before heading out of my room. Again, I am met with silence.

I decide to check the kitchen, and when I walk in, I smell that no one has been here since I left. This really worries me because Mom usually comes up here to change before lunch. I walk back toward the bedrooms and I can smell that no one has been here either in the past few hours, which is odd because my Brothers always take a shower after training.

Right now, I wish Dad had initiated me into the Pack yesterday, but I understand why he didn‚Äôt‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt want me to have a splitting headache during my party. Still, it would make things easier if I could link Mom or Dad. I‚Äôll find out what‚Äôs going on at lunch, and I feel a little better knowing I‚Äôll see my family in a few minutes.

I decide to check my agenda on my way down to the main dining room to see when I have my Mother-Daughter day with Mom, and I nearly lose my footing when I don‚Äôt see it scheduled for this week. I go through the agenda for the next three months, but I don‚Äôt see any Mother-Daughter days planned.

This is so unlike Mom. She loves our Mother-Daughter days and always plans them ahead. It‚Äôs her way of spending time with me, and even though I was reluctant at first, I now look forward to them just as much as she does.

I hear chatter coming from the dining room and slip my phone into my back pocket as I enter the room.

Every conversation halts for a second, but soon the room is filled with chatter again. When I turn toward our table, I notice my family isn‚Äôt there yet. I walk over to the buffet, place my favorite foods onto my plate, and grab a cappuccino before heading to my seat.

I smile when I hear Mom‚Äôs voice getting closer, but the moment she walks into the dining room, she switches to the mind-link as she looks at our Beta female. It doesn‚Äôt take long before I realize that all of them are talking through the mind-link.

Chapter 2 Sleepless Nights

Morgan

It has been three months since my Sweet Sixteen, and I‚Äôm not sure if I should scream or cry. Every morning, I wake up on an empty Alpha floor. My entire family is already out the door by the time I wake up, and no matter what I try, they either ignore me or tell me they‚Äôre too busy.

For as long as I can remember, I was always with one of my Brothers when I wasn‚Äôt in school, helping in any way I could and learning a lot over the years. During my first year in school, I learned quickly that girls only wanted to be my friend in hopes of meeting one of my Brothers. They‚Äôd find no excuse to leave if none were around.

Some people didn‚Äôt want to be my friends because of who I was but because of who I knew. Because of my lack of real friends, I would help my Brothers however I could‚Äîfiling papers or getting coffee as a young Pup, and when I got older, I would help them with more important things. Dad let me sit at a small desk of my own in his office as long as I was quiet. I‚Äôd just sit there reading, writing, or drawing.

Mom always said that by watching my Father and Brothers work, I‚Äôd understand the kind of work my Mate would have to do on a daily basis. She said that‚Äôs something most Lunas don‚Äôt understand anymore‚Äîthey‚Äôre too busy with their parties and dinners.

By spending so much time in Dad‚Äôs office or my Brothers‚Äô offices, I know every nook and cranny of our Pack-house. I know every position of our Warriors that are not running patrol and I know every route our patrols run. They never run the same route twice in a row, and our hidden Warriors serve as extra security.

I know which Packs we have an alliance with, which ones are friendly, and which ones we need to avoid. I also know who the Wolves and Lycans are in each Pack's leadership and who is set to take over in the future.

I know more about our Pack than all my Brothers combined. Sometimes, I‚Äôd hear Dad talk about other Alphas spoiling their Pups rotten, giving them everything they asked for. Dad wasn‚Äôt like that‚Äîhe made us earn our ‚Äúextras,‚Äù as he called them, which were usually things we didn‚Äôt really need.

I earned them by spending time in the kitchen, helping prepare meals throughout the day. I love being able to cook or bake. At first, I would measure the ingredients for the Omegas. When I got older, I helped cut fruits and vegetables. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve been helping with the cooking and baking for our Pack-members, and Mom is really proud of what I‚Äôve accomplished so far.

Spending so much time with Dad and my Brothers made Mom decide that we‚Äôd have a Mother-Daughter day once a week. It could be a day at the spa, a shopping spree, or just sitting in the garden talking about significant events in my future.

I‚Äôd rather spend my days on the training grounds with my Brothers and the Warriors than with Mom and the other Lunas talking about whatever it is they talk about. As I‚Äôve already mentioned, I‚Äôm not a girly girl, and this was her way of bonding with me. I think she secretly wrote down everything I told her so she‚Äôd know how to organize every event to my liking. I really enjoyed my days with Mom‚Äîso long as it was just the two of us. If other females joined us, the conversation would always end up as a discussion about parties and their do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts.

But we haven‚Äôt had a Mother-Daughter Day in the past three months. After about two weeks, I tried to bring it up with her during lunch, but she brushed me off, saying she was too busy. She‚Äôs always off somewhere with our Beta and Gamma females. She even stops talking when I walk into the room.

I tried to talk to my Brothers and Dad during those first two weeks, but I got the same response from them. Dad barely says a word to me‚Äî even a simple ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù or ‚ÄúHello‚Äù seems too much. All I get from my Brothers are ‚ÄúNot now,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have time,‚Äù and other remarks like that. Even my training has stopped since our Gamma never shows up anymore.

Breakfast, lunch, and dinner are spent in silence, even though I know they talk to each other through the mind-link. I can‚Äôt use it since Dad still hasn‚Äôt initiated me into the Pack and every time I try to bring it up, he cuts me off. Every Pup gets initiated into the Pack on their sixteenth birthday, but for some reason, Dad forgot to hold the ceremony after my Sweet Sixteen party.

After a month, I stopped going to the dining room for meals, but I doubt anyone has noticed. 

About a month ago, I was wandering around the territory, just contemplating what to do with my life, when I found a small cottage near our northern border.

If I‚Äôm not on the training grounds, I‚Äôm at the cottage, trying to find a new purpose in life‚Äîand I think I‚Äôve seen it. I will sign up for the King‚Äôs Army, but I am not sure yet what kind of position I would like to get. 

Over the past month, I‚Äôve moved quite a few things to the cottage, and I spend my days there taking tests.

I hope those tests will help me determine what I‚Äôm good at and which positions in the King‚Äôs Army best suit me. 

Today, I‚Äôll head to our Archive before going to my sanctuary. I‚Äôll take my file out of the Archive and update it myself.

I doubt anyone has looked at it in the past three months, or someone would have noticed that I wasn‚Äôt initiated into the Pack. 

As every morning, I make my own breakfast. Once I‚Äôm done, I erase every trace of having been there. I place a few items from the pantry into my backpack before heading out the door.

Walking down the stairs, I notice that even the Pack-members are too busy to greet me. No one stops me when I enter the Archive. It only takes me a few minutes to find my file. As I expected, the last entry is from my sixteenth birthday, written by Dad. It just states that I turned sixteen that day.

I slip the file into my backpack and head out the back door toward my cottage. I don‚Äôt run into anyone on the way, and a week ago, it would have made me sad‚Äîbut not anymore. I‚Äôm going to live my life the way I want and stop hoping my family will finally notice me. Those days are behind me.

I‚Äôve cried enough tears and had enough sleepless nights. I‚Äôll focus on my future‚Äîa future away from this Pack and my family. 

Chapter 3 New Life

Ashton

During Morgan‚Äôs Sweet Sixteen party, Dad told us we had an early morning meeting in his office the next day‚Äîthere was something significant he and Mom needed to discuss with us. He mentioned that he had given Morgan the day off so she could sleep in, which would give them time to tell us what they needed to say.

I had checked on her before we all went down to Dad‚Äôs office and was surprised to see our Beta and Gamma couple present as well.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm about to tell you never leaves this room. If this gets out, it will cause many problems, and we will get attacked for it,‚Äù Dad stated, and I knew he wasn‚Äôt kidding.

‚ÄúMost Pups born into our bloodline are males, and once I‚Äôve told you everything, you‚Äôll understand why most will think that‚Äôs a good thing. A hundred and fifteen years ago, the last female was born into our bloodline, and despite all the precautions her family took, it ended badly for her.

Like every other female in my bloodline, she received her gift on her seventeenth birthday at the exact time she was born, and a year later, she found her fated Mate. Her Father asked him to stay with them for a week, and they got to know her Mate during that week. He was a well-respected Alpha of a large Pack.

They felt they could trust him with their Daughter and her secret. They told him about her ability, and he promised them he would protect her with his life. Everything was fine for a few years, but as time passed, he realized what she could do for him and started forcing her to use her ability. The punishment for disobeying him worsened over time, and in the end, she saw no other way out.

When she found out she was pregnant with a female Pup, she took her own life. I know that his Pack is still waiting for the day another female Pup is born.‚Äù

Dad‚Äôs words left us in stunned silence. Fletcher was the first to break it.

‚ÄúIs that why you called her Morgan?‚Äù

We had always wondered why she had a male‚Äôs name, but with this information, it made sense. Mom nodded in response to Fletcher‚Äôs question.

Dad had called the meeting because he wanted our help to prevent the same thing from happening to Morgan. After that, we met every morning to discuss the best course of action.

Yesterday, Hudson asked Mom the question that‚Äôs been occupying all our minds‚Äîwhat kind of ability Morgan will have. On her seventeenth birthday at three minutes past eleven in the evening, she will receive her gift from the Goddess.

No one knows what kind of gift it will be since it‚Äôs different for every female. Mom had researched the Pack‚Äôs Archive and discovered that seven females had been born into Dad‚Äôs bloodline. Two of them could hear thoughts, two could sense Werewolves and Lycans from a mile away, one could listen to sounds from a mile away, and one could read the memories of places as long as they had happened within twenty-four hours.

Mom started planning Morgan‚Äôs seventeenth birthday from the day she was born, adjusting the list as Morgan grew. Landon made a huge printout of the list and taped it to the wall‚Äîa reminder that we still had a lot to do. I feel relieved every time we cross something off the list.

There‚Äôs a clearing near our western border where we‚Äôll celebrate her seventeenth birthday. It's easier to keep it a secret from her. Right now, my office is covered with indigo and maroon fabrics. We need to decide which ones to use for the party.

I smile as I think about our little spitfire. At only 5'5"", she‚Äôs a force to be reckoned with. If she gets pissed at you, there‚Äôs nowhere to run or hide. I learned that the hard way when I tossed a few of her papers in the bin next to her desk‚Äînot only did she kick me, but she also refused to talk to me for two days.

We all have stories like that. As she got older, her tantrums got worse. Mom and Dad always say she‚Äôs worse than all of their Sons combined. If you heard every story my Brothers and I have, you‚Äôd know they‚Äôre right.

Some might think we fear our parents, but there‚Äôs only one person we all really fear in this world‚Äîand that‚Äôs our baby Sister. At first, she‚Äôll be pissed at us for keeping this a secret, but once Dad explains everything, she‚Äôll be grateful.

Hudson asked Dad why no one ever informed the King‚Äôs Council or invited witnesses. Dad thought about it for a few days before telling us that it might prevent Morgan from facing the same fate as our ancestors. Mom and Dad will leave tomorrow morning to visit an old family friend, and I will contact the King‚Äôs Council.

I‚Äôll also ask them to send witnesses. The more people who know, the safer Morgan will be.

Declan holds up two pieces of fabric. Even though they‚Äôre her favorite colors, I doubt she‚Äôd like them. He tosses them in the bin after I shake my head. Landon has been watching him for a while now, and I wonder when he‚Äôs planning to put Declan out of his misery.

Landon slowly walks over to Declan and looks at all the fabrics spread out on his desk. He grabs them one by one and tosses them into the bin without saying a word, steadily clearing the desk until only a few fabrics remain.

Declan sighs in relief as Landon makes his life a little easier. Both of them eye the pieces that are left, reaching for the same one at the same time. Looks like we‚Äôve finally tackled that task. I see Michael smile as he checks off another box.

Morgan

After I completed all the tests, I received an email from the King‚Äôs Army stating that I had been accepted. I didn‚Äôt have to go through any extra trials or tests. I‚Äôve already planned my departure to reach the King‚Äôs Army on the day I turn seventeen.

I moved my bike from the garage to the cottage, and so far, no one has asked about it missing from the garage. I ordered a more oversized backpack so I can take a few things with me. The rest I sent to the Academy a week ago‚Äîit‚Äôll be waiting in the room I‚Äôll call home for the next few years.

I wake up in the middle of the night to soft singing in my head. For a moment, I think I‚Äôm in my room at the Pack-house‚Äîuntil I realize the voice is unfamiliar.

‚ÄúHappy Birthday, Morgan,‚Äù I hear the voice say.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a week too early,‚Äù I answer automatically, only to be met with laughter in my head.

‚ÄúSilly girl, I‚Äôm in your head. My name is Amra, and I am your Lycan,‚Äù she responds.

Again, I tell her she‚Äôs early, but then she tells me I was born a week late‚Äîmaking today my birthday instead of a week from today. I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs possible, and Amra doesn‚Äôt want to explain it.

I let Amra go through my memories, and she becomes furious when she reaches the past year. She understands why I want to leave but asks me to give her one chance to discover why my family started ignoring me. I reluctantly agree to join my family for dinner tonight.

We spent the rest of the day talking about my childhood, our family, and everything I learned over the years from following my Dad and my Brothers. She likes looking at my memories of the Mother-Daughter days I spent with Mom, but she gets angry when she can‚Äôt find one from the past year.

When I walk into the dining room, I mention to Amra that our family isn‚Äôt present yet, and I sit down in my usual seat; it takes a few minutes before everyone is present. An Omega places my plate in front of me, but she doesn‚Äôt look surprised to see me at the table and I wonder if anyone ever noticed I hadn‚Äôt been here in nearly a year. 

I concentrate on my food and let Amra do what she wants to do. I don‚Äôt try to start a conversation with my family. When I‚Äôm finished eating, Amra tells me that our parents‚Äô Lycans didn‚Äôt acknowledge her‚Äînot even Ashton‚Äôs Lycan.

That‚Äôs it. We are done with them.

We leave the dining room before dessert and return to the cottage to grab our backpack. I take one last look around the cottage I‚Äôve called home for the past ten months.

I start my bike's engine, and it roars to life in the silent evening. I know exactly where our patrols are, and I waste no time crossing the border of our territory.

Leaving Blue River Pack behind in pursuit of my new life. 

Chapter 4 Instincts

Luna Giselle

For the past week, my Lycan has been acting strange, but she can‚Äôt recall anything happening during the past week to justify her feelings. Well, nothing out of the ordinary, that is, and we both decide it has to do with our little miracle‚Äôs birthday. 

Today we will spend the day on our own floor while our Pack-members organize the final details for the party.

Tate walks out of the bathroom as I walk out of our closet. He smiles at me before asking if I have everything under control.

‚ÄúOf course, I have everything under control. I can‚Äôt wait to see her face when she sees what we have organized for her seventeenth birthday party,‚Äù I answer as I wrap my arms around his waist.

I walk into the kitchen to start preparing breakfast. I am going to make Morgan all of her favorite dishes. Colton and Landon are already setting the table as I pull everything I need from the pantry and the fridge. Ashton walks into the kitchen with a strange look on his face, and I ask him what is wrong.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Mom. Titan feels as if he missed something major. We‚Äôve gone over the past week, but we can‚Äôt figure it out,‚Äù Ashton answers, and I tell him that Sage has the same problem.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been so busy organizing everything. We had to reconfirm that the King would send witnesses, and I think we‚Äôre just worried that something might go wrong.‚Äù

Tate tells us that Roman has been going through the same thing, and I think it‚Äôs safe to say that we are all worried that something might blow up in our faces. We talk about tonight‚Äôs party as the boys help me get breakfast ready. As they bring everything to the dining room, I walk toward Morgan‚Äôs room to wake her up.

As I walk down the hall to her room, something feels off, and I start to feel anxious the closer I get to her room.

‚ÄúIs something wrong?‚Äù Tate asks from behind me, and I tell him that something doesn‚Äôt feel right. Ashton pushes past me to open her bedroom door, and then it hits me.

I can barely smell the scent of my Daughter, and Sage starts to whimper in my head. Ashton is running around her room, saying that her stuff is missing. Her closet is nearly empty, as is her bathroom. Tate sends out a Pack-wide mind-link to get everyone to the Pack-house, and within seconds I can hear footsteps and paws pounding the stairs and the ground.

Everyone is quiet when we step onto the front porch.

‚ÄúMorgan is missing, and with how faint her scent is in her room, she‚Äôs been gone for a while. I want the entire territory searched, and if anyone can think of anything strange, I want to hear about it. No one will get into trouble. We just want to know what happened. We need to figure out why she‚Äôs missing and if she left on her own accord,‚Äù Tate says, and in seconds, everyone takes off in different directions to search for our Daughter. Her Brothers rush off as well, and Tate holds me in his arms as I quietly break down.

After two hours of searching, Fletcher informs us through the mind-link that he found a cottage at the north border that holds her scent. Tate sends all her Brothers toward him, but an hour later, they still haven‚Äôt found her. One of our Omegas who works in the main dining room walks up to us with a worried look on her face.

My Sons have just returned, and I ask her if there is something she wants to tell us.

‚ÄúLuna, I mean no offense with what I am about to say. Morgan hasn‚Äôt been to the main dining room for breakfast, lunch, or dinner for months. I didn‚Äôt say anything because none of you seemed to be worried when she no longer showed up.

A week ago, she came in for dinner again but left before we served dessert. I noticed her bike missing from the garage about a month ago, but I thought she might have gone for a ride, as she has done it quite often in the past few months,‚Äù she says, and I just look at her as Tate thanks her for telling us.

Once we are all back on the Alpha floor, I break down and start sobbing as Tate wraps his arms around me.

‚ÄúMom, if she left the territory, we would have felt the Pack-bond snap. She still has to be in the territory,‚Äù Landon says as he places his laptop on his lap, and Colton runs out the door.

A few minutes later, Colton walks back into the room, and his face doesn‚Äôt predict much good.

‚ÄúHer file is gone, and I can‚Äôt find her initiation papers,‚Äù he states as he sits down on the couch.

Tate mutters, ‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù as he jumps off the couch. ‚ÄúWe were supposed to initiate her the night after her sixteenth birthday, but we were too busy going over the gift she might get,‚Äù Tate mumbles.

I try to remember the last time I spoke to her, and for the life of me, I can‚Äôt remember.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a Mother-Daughter day with her once since she turned sixteen,‚Äù I say, and one after the other remembers that they brushed her off after we told them about her seventeenth birthday.

‚ÄúShe left on her bike. She crossed the border not far from the cottage,‚Äù Landon says, and Tate calls off the search for our Daughter. She left the territory, so there‚Äôs no use. I spend the rest of the day in a daze, and at dinner, I get the worst news I could have gotten.

Ashton tells me she hasn‚Äôt been in the dining room for nearly a year. They even saw footage of her trying to talk to one of us, and it always ended the same way. We would tell her we were too busy or cut her off by walking away from her. We pushed her away from us by forgetting how much she meant to all of us.

Morgan

Ever since I left Blue River territory, I have been noticing a change in myself. I can‚Äôt explain it yet as it is very erratic, and every time I think I have it figured out, it changes again. One thing I do know for sure ‚Äî my hearing has increased a lot, and I‚Äôm not talking about being able to hear things close to me.

I was riding along a forest when I heard whimpering, and I stopped because I thought it came from beside the road. But I had to walk over a mile before I found the source. A female about my age was lying on the forest floor, cuts and bruises all over her body. I took her back to my bike to attend to her wounds.",1,1761627614.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1oi0q97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1oi0q97/toy_boy/,Toy boy,"A toy boy in a toy house
wrote about toy love.

The toy boy wanted to believe
in toy feelings.

Toy feelings filled his chest so deeply.

Girls love toys,
so such love is always welcome.

But toy love has one flaw,
it‚Äôs toy.

Toy in meaning, in essence, and in nature.
Toy in form, and even in expression.

The girls played,
and then the boy had to live with it.

Only for a boy who loved
just a few times in his life,
this love wasn‚Äôt a toy.

‚ÄúToys are for children,‚Äù
the boy thinks.

But when you sell love
in a toy store,
it‚Äôs hard to tell it apart from a toy.

When love comes with a bright sticker,
it can always be returned within 14 days.

In another 14 days, you can forget it.

In another 14, you might not even remember
that you‚Äôd ever been in that store.

You might recall the trip, the emotions,
the new shoes.

The coffee and the carbonara,
and everything else will fade away.

Forgotten boy, I pity you so much.

I pity everyone - the buyer and myself.

I‚Äôm sorry I bought that plane ticket,
that I missed the signs,
ignored the meaning behind them.

My dear boy,
I‚Äôll be grateful to you all my life.

I truly regret that in toy stores,
inexperienced souls keep looking
for adult toys.",6,1761627372.0,Poems,4,1.0,False

I am a bit upset with myself that I didn't do more in the morning... I woke up around noon (which I was prepared for because I was super tired) and then proceeded to not do my schoolwork for like 2 and a half hours before kind of helping clean up the studio, but not nearly as well as I should have.  I think Im in a much better place now than when I was in school before. Like I'll actually get stuff done and not miss assignments. My schooling for basically all of highschool was treated like college anyways, little to no actual supervision or support, but now I'm actually old enough to deal with it. I also probably won't let it make me suicidal this time. Yippeeee 

Anyways, I'll be going to the coffee shop tomorrow, which is good because I like the coffee shop!

I (29) have this friend, let's call her J. J has been my best friend and family for 15 years. She's someone I love and care about deeply. J also has a wife, L, that I also considered myself friend's with. Now that the main players are in place let's move on to the issue. My partner and I major had a major falling out last year, to the point of separation. Cue J offering me a temporary place to stay. That went well, at first... I was able to keep up on helping with the house, we hung out often, ect. But then shit started to happen. I, in my grief and ever growing burnout (bad job), stayed out more and more in desperate craving of solitude that wasn't possible in their space. I will admit that I wasn't good at communicating when or how long I'd be gone, which naturally became a source of frustration for J and L. I had also confided in both J and L about some rather raw and personal concerns I had about myself. One of which being concerned about inheriting some bad habits from my family.  L took this to heart and began getting even cagier around me. One of the many heads of conflict was that I was supposed to go on a trip with them to help out a friend. I had a panic attack day of and could not go. I spent most of my weekend at home, but met up with a different friend for coffee briefly so that I would get some sun. I was told by L and J that I was morally wrong for this, that if I'm home because I'm too burnt out to go on a trip I needed to stay home. More occasions like this happened. During an attempted conversation to resolve our issues L used some of my vulnerabilities against me. I was labelled flakey for saying ""maybe"" to plans and then not being able to make them. It was not made better when I just said no or I need to think about it outright. There were many more of these kinds of goings on. I was morally wrong for x thing or y thing. More and more labels about my character. And when I finally resolved to move out before It totally squashed our friendship L would not allow me in the home without them present while I moved my things out.

This is not to say I was a perfect roommate. As stated before I stayed out late and often, I let my depression get the better of me and did not clean as much or as often as I should have. I was frequently late to things and struggled to keep plans without feeling overwhelmed or spiralling.

J and I talked it out shortly after my moving out, but I haven't talked to L yet. I'm having a hard time trusting them again, and I'm not sure of it's right of me to do so. It's been over 6 months since I moved, I should be able to move on, right? Neither J nor I have talked to each other much since then. I've tried to reach out a couple of times but the conversation just... Fizzles. Plans are loosely talked about but never had. And now with the holidays coming up and the usual parties happening I just feel conflicted. I both desperately want to go and be with my friend and enjoy our holiday traditions and am also wary about being mistreated. Is this friendship taking a new form? Do I need to let go and let this thing evolve as it will? Am I holding on to grudges too much or being too naive? I am so lost on what in the hell to do, my internal compass definitely not telling me where due north is.


Tldr; Massive falling out with best friend and their wife while living with them. Wife said some crappy things while best friend stood by. Worried that these things are both A) accurate to my character and B) not worth holding a grudge over. Deeply concerned about how to move forward, especially with the holidays coming up.

It prides itself on views, family friendly accommodations, and high service. The complimentary coffee/tea, pastries and fruit (at Sottovento Cafe) may also play a part...Sweets are just loved all around the world, aren't they?

Traditional, sophisticated, minimalist design, from the drapes to the decorative lamps! There are several elegant rooms to pick from, and different views (Boston Public Garden, dome of the state house) to behold.

There's also the Four Seasons Hotel One Dalton Street, housing afternoon tea at the Trifecta! It is also a verified five-star hotel, with an entire floor dedicated to wellness. With two FS hotels, which would you pick? Unless you preferred a hotel housing the tea--Then Four Seasons Hotel One Dalton Street would be your pick!

It appears the restaurant has tea from their local supplier, J‚Äôenway Tea Co! (Moonlit Orchid Oolong, Lychee Rose, Lady Blue Earl Grey, etc.) Reservations are highly recommended and afternoon tea is Saturdays and Sundays from 11:00 am/12:45 PM to 2:30 pm.

[There's also a 'spiked' tea option, as such as been growing popular in certain circles. As well as the option of having hot chocolate rather than tea!](https://preview.redd.it/7g7fqtb3htvf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=488972a66197c055567cbe8e23b11ac732c86516)

Feel free to correct me about the times, they were updated over the years it seems--It would be unfortunate if someone adjusted their schedule for tea at the wrong time.

I'm a young (31m) working professional. I started professional work when I was 23, as an analyst for a government military contractor. I did that for about 4 years and it was a very weird working experience that I dount I could ever get again.

I got out of that industry and moved into private sales as a data strategist. That was something I was excited about and thought I'd be super good at - lo and behold, it was insanely stressful and difficult and my coworkers were fake as hell, everything about that job stressed me out and sucked, despite a big pay increase and great benefits. I did that for about a year before I couldn't do it anymore.

Now I'm a data engineer, but I had NO training on how to do that, so I took a pay cut and have effectively started over since getting this new job. Work here has been easy. Like really easy. I am 24/7 wfh with okay benefits and occasional travel. My pay is effectively what I made when I first started working, plus some for a single raise I got a few years ago. I don't care about this company and their really cringe culture, but I like my boss and my senior developer co-workers. They've taught me a lot. But, my day to day is generally super empty. Like I can check emails in bed at 830-9, eventually roll out of bed at like 930 in my pj's, get coffee and start the day. My coworkers don't know that I do that, because they're usually swamped with work- work that I can't really do. I've asked them if I could help them, but a lot of the time they say that this work is beyond my capability and that I should still be learning. Which is fine. But it feels weird to be so free. I feel like if I ever lose this job I won't know how to function at any other job now. Like I'm spoiled. I've learned a lot of stuff here, but all of that came in the pretty early phases of the job, like the first year and a half.

Right now, I'm trying to teach myself stuff on the side (like python) so that I can hopefully develop some skills to be used in the future if this job doesn't pan out. I'm a little worried that when the seniors start to retire, I'll be up s*** creek without a paddle.

TLDR;
I guess what I'm asking is, should I keep this job and enjoy the freedom and just work on myself in the time between tasks? Or should I look for a job that's more active and helps me develop, maybe a job that I really love, instead of this one that I just don't care about but have loads of free time with.",1,1761626385.0,makemychoice,1,1.0,False

Bellevue/Redmond were talked up by friends but out of our purchasing price range & seem.. closer in nature to the suburban hell we‚Äôre yearned to escape? Capitol Hill/Ballard would‚Äôve been great in our 20s but may now make us cranky on weeknights. West Seattle seems the best of both worlds: cozy living with the rest of the city a short ride away. Is there anything I‚Äôm missing?

Would love to hear your recommendations!

1oi0e2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Professors/comments/1oi0e2u/why_do_you_even_care_about_cheating/,Why Do You Even Care About Cheating?,"I‚Äôm experiencing a severe episode of burnout following some grieving in my personal life, as well as financial troubles that I‚Äôm sure all other lecturers experience, but after stressing constantly over designing lessons in such a way to measure participation and minimize cheating, I‚Äôve started to wonder: Why Do I Even Care?

If a student submits an AI generated essay, they harm their potential for learning. They violate whatever moral standings they had. They risk failing because the bot produced shoddy work. 

But what incentive do I have to prevent that? 

Do I lose money if too many students fail?
No.

Do I get money for catching cheaters?
No.

Will promoting academic honesty and citizenship help me obtain promotions in my department?
Nope. 

In fact, my department has made it clear that nobody is getting promoted for years.

At this point my only incentive to promote academic honesty is my own conscience and my own values regarding education and the respect I have for my field. Except, failing them won‚Äôt make them suddenly try. They‚Äôre cheating either because they lack the fundamentals to complete an intro to college writing course themselves or because they don‚Äôt value anything except the degree. In either case, failing them won‚Äôt wake them up or suddenly fill the years of gaps in their education. 

So *who* exactly am I helping but myself? What is my end goal in this crusade against ChatGPT except to ingratiate my own self-importance that completing the assignments I designed is some valuable experience? The students don‚Äôt think so and the university doesn‚Äôt think so. The people paying me don‚Äôt care and the people I‚Äôm teaching don‚Äôt care.

So neither will I.

Maybe if in a few years there‚Äôs some education revolution and the vibes shift towards values that reflect mine I‚Äôll start caring again. But as of right now, they can defer their entire college experience to the robots and I‚Äôll just sip my coffee and focus on spending time on things that make me happy. Anyone who wants to be taught, I‚Äôll teach. But the drones, the kids who are really just a proxy to AI, I‚Äôm done with them.

Some things I‚Äôve learned the hard way:

* **Everyone wants a ‚Äúsimple website‚Äù** until you ask what they actually want then it turns into a 15-page vision board.
* **Marketing myths are everywhere.** People think one Instagram post will go viral and pay rent.
* **The real MVP? Communication.** You can code fast, but nothing fixes a client who changes their logo every Tuesday.
* **Small wins feel big.** Seeing a client get their first sale online is still the best dopamine hit.

Still figuring it all out, but it‚Äôs wild how every project turns into a mix of tech, psychology, and stand-up comedy.

1oi0b0l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diary/comments/1oi0b0l/66m_sharing_reflections_of_this_weekend/,66/M Sharing reflections of this weekend,"I experienced a very thought provoking 36 hours over this past weekend and wanted to take the time to share some thoughts.  


It started on Friday morning when I went on a bike ride.  I had reached my turnaround point and a young woman asked me where I rode from. She then made a positive comment about being physically active and in that same breath shared that she was struggling with mental health.  This was not a homeless person.  She was well dressed and was spending the day with her friend and her friends dog.  I learned through the course of the conversation that ensued that she had a child and a reputable professional career (I won't share specifics here).  She asked me what piece of advice someone my age would share and I told her to always look forward.  Dwell on the positive and the future.  Don't ignore your failures, but rather learn from them.  We engaged in a meaningful conversation and I shared very raw and personal experiences from my life that I would never think to share with a complete stranger.  We talked about the importance of physical health to mental health.    


I went outside and had my coffee but I felt that I wanted to give her a hug and tell her that she was going to be ok.  I knew she was with a friend and was doing what she need to do for her mental health.  As I sat and had my coffee out on the back patio I thought about the conversation.  I looked for her after I left to give her a hug and tell her how much the conversation meant to me but she and her friend were gone.  
On Saturday I attended a ""gathering"" for a 24 year old who lost a 9 year battle with a rare form of cancer. There were close to 300 people who attended.  I didn't know him well but know his parents.  I was moved by the comments by family and friends about what a special person he was.  He never gave up until his dying breath, even through the pain of multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation.  The tributes were nearly 2 1/2 hours and what stroke me most was this young man's impact on everyone he met.  
That evening I went and saw the biopic ""Deliver Me From Nowhere.""  I'm a huge Springsteen fan and I knew the movie wasn't really a showcase of his music but rather a story of Springsteen's writing of his Nebraska album.  The movie shone a light on Springsteen struggling with depression.  I've read his autobiography but didn't have an appreciation for what he went through.

The 3 events over a span of 36 hours caused me to pause and reflect how fortunate that I am.  I think we all need to pause periodically and reflect.  We all struggle and face our challenges, it's how we confront those challenges.  

For those who are struggling I am sending out hugs.  People are inherently good.  Reach out and as Jelly Roll says.
