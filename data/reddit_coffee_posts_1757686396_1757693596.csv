Thinking of opening a business in my town -- one that would be the perfect hangout spot for the athletic community. We have been seeing a huge rise in fitness over here (CrossFit, Hyrox, triathletes, or even avid gym-goers). 

I would love for it to have an area that has contrast therapy (cold plunge + sauna), a lounging area to hang out. And even partner up with our local meal-prep company so you can meet your macros (protein coffee / sweet treats too). 

  
Can have day-passes or membership fees for contrast therapy. Still trying to think of what else to include.

1nf78ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1nf78ew/should_i_let_my_resident_cat_enforce_boundaries/,Should I let my resident cat enforce boundaries or keep separating?,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôve read literally every post under the introduction flair and I just want some advice/reassurance that I‚Äôm going in the right direction here.

A few weeks ago I started foster-to-adopting a 6 month old male kitten and I already have a ~8 yr old female cat. I‚Äôve had the resident cat for about 2 years now, before me she was a street cat who lived in a feral colony (I live in nyc). She‚Äôs a very sweet girl who loves pets and is affectionate in her own way, but doesn‚Äôt like being picked up and retains some of her formerly feral skepticism (understandably).

She‚Äôs a very timid cautious cat, so I‚Äôve been going through a very slow introduction process. She doesn‚Äôt seem to be bothered by his scent at all, but I‚Äôve been scent swapping religiously, brushing him then her with the same brush and vice versa, no problem. I started feeding them first at the opposite side of the door, but we‚Äôve progressed to where they can eat basically nose to nose with the door completely open without her hissing or growling, they will watch each other groom themselves after eating, and I will play with each of them while the other watches so they get a sense for each other‚Äôs body language. I let these positive interactions happen for about a week. They even both shared a churu treat without issues by just passing the tube back and forth between them. She will sometimes come to the closed door of his base camp (probably looking for food but sometimes I think just out of curiosity), but when he mews and tries to get a glimpse of her through the cracks she will hiss.

Over the past few days I‚Äôve started encouraging the kitten to come out of his base camp into the rest of the apartment while she is there. Most of the time she will pick a ‚Äúsafe spot‚Äù to watch him from, like under the coffee table or a desk, but not completely hidden like under the couch. She isn‚Äôt entirely comfortable, but not incredibly stressed either, her ears will be forward and she‚Äôll just quietly observe. She never stalks or chases him.

 I try to keep the kitten as engaged as possible with toys, but he is so desperate to interact with her he will always eventually try to approach. If he gets within a few feet of her, she‚Äôll start hissing and growling at him (her ‚Äúaggro range‚Äù). I always try to distract him with a toy, but there have been a couple times he‚Äôs gotten too close to her face and she‚Äôll hiss and swat at him, bopping him in the head. He‚Äôll retreat, but without fail try to come back for more within a few minutes. I don‚Äôt think her claws have ever been out. Usually after this I will pick him up and hold him for a while and he will be constantly mewing. One time after she hit him and I let him go, he flopped over on his side, I guess trying to signal that he is non threatening. One thing I think is encouraging is that she will stand her ground and not run away from his advances, even after she hits him it‚Äôs only to push him away from her but they haven‚Äôt chased each other at all. I let these sessions where they‚Äôre both in the same space last generally for a few hours until I feel my resident cat needs a break from the hyper vigilance.

From what I‚Äôve read here, it seems like this is just a normal part of her enforcing her boundaries and establishing a hierarchy. I‚Äôve never had two cats in the same household before (and this resident is my first cat) so it‚Äôs hard for me to judge what is normal besides just watching videos and reading the posts here. I know the Jackson Galaxy guide says to try to keep early interactions as positive as possible, and I know it takes time. I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not pushing it too far because I would really hate to have to start from square 1 (I love the kitten but keeping him engaged in my room full time has been a ton of work), and I know the kitten is so eager to have more and more time outside my room and keeps trying to escape.

Should I keep separating him and holding him for a ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù session after she swats at him? Or let him figure it out on his own? Am I doing the right thing? And should I be constantly trying to engage the kitten at this point, or can I just be in the same room supervising while he‚Äôs there with her?

POV Location: Alaska, USA. TV Base.

My name is TV-04, also known as Energized TV Man, I am an elite unit of the TV Men race, the invasion of the astro toilets have caused the alliance to ‚Äúteam‚Äù up with the toilets, forming a union. I was in the TV Men base, watching Titan TV Man and Scientist TV Man have a discussion, the large tv on the wall went into the POV of a Cameraman at the Cameramen base.

POV Location: Auckland Islands, New Zealand, Cameraman Base.
 
The POV-Cameraman watched over the entrance of the Cameramen Base, watching various agents leave the base, including a Work in Progress Large Cameraman 3.0, having a blue camera, a advanced jetpack, and a handheld blaster taken from a Astro Specialist. The POV turned around, past a Camera Strider 2.0, and a Plasma Tank. A ton of Skibidi Toilets were coming towards the base, some scientists discussing with some Cameramen Scientists, they were coming in peace, not to attack, I thought the Cameramen would attack the toilets but they didnt? Just then a arm came in front of the POV‚Äôs camera. ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù A voice said, The POV turned to his side to see a Female Mutant with a set of four claws on her back, a orange visor on her helmet, and two astro laser cannons on her shoulders, the toilets were also taking samples. ‚ÄúYour friends‚Ä¶‚Äù the mutant said, pointing to her right, two toilets came down carrying containers. ‚ÄúYou did not bother saving them‚Ä¶‚Äù the mutant said as the containers opened, revealing tons of the fodder cameramen and speakermen. ‚ÄúWithout our help, they would die‚Ä¶‚Äù the mutant said before grabbing the POV. ‚ÄúNow, lil bro‚Ä¶ your base.. is OUR base‚Ä¶‚Äù she said with a smiling face. The POV then began to change. ‚ÄúDumb bitch!‚Äù Polycephaly yelled as the POV changed. ‚ÄúWhy are we allying with the shitheads?! Are we this desperate?‚Äù The POV changed to Khabarovsk, Russia, where a group of cameramen and toilets were hiding in the destroyed city. A Astro Obliterator and a Astro Trooper raced by, not noticing the POV. ‚ÄúThis is necessary, if we want to survive..‚Äù The Scientist TV Man said as the POV looked forward, seeing a Cameraman wearing a sweater ‚Äúdrink‚Äù vodka whilst sitting next to a toilet wearing a hat that had a laser cannon mounted on one of his arms. The Cameraman threw the bottle of vodka to the side whilst standing up, preparing his laser cannon, so did the toilet. ‚ÄúWe must organize a meeting with their hiding leader.‚Äù The Scientist TV Man said, the POV readied his laser cannon as a Astro Troop noticed them, the POV then changed once more. ‚ÄúHe knows something that can help us‚Ä¶‚Äù The Scientist TV Man said as the POV changed to Amsterdam, Netherlands. Where the Astro Toilets were destroying the city, agents were running in all directions alongside toilets. ‚ÄúTHE ONLY THING I‚ÄôM ORGANIZING IS HIS FUNERAL, HOW CAN YOU TRUST HIM?!‚Äù Titan TV Man roared as the POV ran through some smoke, the POV then changed yet again to Birmingham, United Kingdom, where a Cameraman was mourning his dead brother, walking back with his paralyzer laser rifle in his hands, dead agents, toilets, and even a astro trooper all around. ‚ÄúAfter all the Genocide‚Ä¶‚Äù Titan TV Man said as the POV turned to face the sky. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve seen what the invaders can do‚Ä¶ their weakest units.. wipe out entire legions.‚Äù The Scientist TV Man said as the POV faced back down and began walking towards a garage, dead agents all around. ‚ÄúThey kill everything in their way‚Ä¶ do you think we have a choice‚Ä¶‚Äù Scientist TV Man said, just then, a orange glow emerged from the garage, the POV prepared to fire, but the glow disappeared, he fired into the garage, to no avail, a noise coming from the POV‚Äôs right, he looked right, the Astro Specialist emerging, ripping him in half, the POV laid on the ground, looking up at the sky. The POV began to change once more. ‚ÄúWe do‚Ä¶‚Äù Titan TV Man said, the POV changing to Osaka, Japan. The POV looking up at a roof top where a Samurai Cameraman stood, carrying a blue plasma tipped blade. The POV began to look down. ‚ÄúAcquire bigger samples‚Ä¶‚Äù Titan TV Man said, The POV looking at various upgraded troops developed in Japan, including a toilet. ‚ÄúDevelop stronger upgrades..‚Äù Titan TV Man said. ‚ÄúJust like before‚Ä¶‚Äù The POV watched as a Large Cameraman ripped off a Astro blaster off of the corpse of a dead astro troop, the POV turned around into the alleys of Osaka, fire all around, the POV looked behind him, more fire. ‚ÄúThis is not just like before.. the Scientist TV Man said, a Astro Troop appearing, facing away from the POV, the POV pulled out his own blaster, firing it directly at the Astro Troop as the POV changed to just above our base in Alaska, a Cameraman making it there. ‚ÄúOur advantage is being underground, in secrecy, but we have to be cautious and slow‚Ä¶ If they find us, access our technology.. this will be the end of the world‚Ä¶‚Äù the Scientist TV Man said, the POV changing to Halifax, Canada. The POV looking up to see a Astro Impactor, Destructor, and Obliterator destroying the city. ‚ÄúOUR WORLD HAS ALREADY ENDED‚Ä¶‚Äù Titan TV Man said as the Obliterator noticed the POV, the POV changing once more, to Denver, USA, where the work in progress Cameramen 3.0 were killing various fodder astro toilets, seemingly with ease. The Normal agents welding blasters similar to the Astro Troops, the POV faced foward, seeing multiple Camera Striders, Plasma Tanks, and Orbital Cameras marching forward. ‚ÄúTHAT IS NOT ENOUGH POWER. THEY‚ÄôVE LOST THEIR GUIDANCE‚Ä¶ MARCHING TO THEIR IMMINENT DEATH.‚Äù Titan TV Man said as the TV cut off, I zoomed my portable Camera out, I turned to Titan TV Man, who turned the TV off with his remote, the newly upgraded Polycephaly standing on a platform above, Titan TV Man changed his tv‚Äôs emoticons to a ‚Äú>:(‚Äú face. ‚ÄúARE WE GOING TO STAY, AND WATCH THEM DIE??‚Äù He roared. ‚ÄúIt takes sacrifice to achieve progress‚Ä¶‚Äù the Scientist TV Man said with a ‚Äú-_-‚Äú face, ‚Äúdrinking‚Äù coffee whilst TV-07, also known as Larry, stood beside him. ‚ÄúBetter safe than sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù the scientist said. ‚ÄúI learned it the hard way‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYOU IMBECILE!!!‚Äù Titan TV Man roared as he lowered down towards the scientist. ‚ÄúSOON NO PLACE WILL BE SAFE!‚Äù Titan TV Man continued. ‚ÄúThe Speakermen were preparing their armada this entire time, they are ready now‚Ä¶ all thats left is their titan, but they dont need him, they have a trump card‚Ä¶‚Äù Scientist TV Man said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be too late to save the Cameramen!!!

Humans are aggressive creatures, prone to rage at many situations.

While this is good when they are attacked, it‚Äôs not so good in everyday life when no threat is present.

Road/void rage and bar fights are a major example of human rage manifest.

However, they are also prone to rage in infuriating situations that aren‚Äôt seen as bad by more patient species like traffic or waiting for berths to open.

I can‚Äôt think of a better bounce back spot for the Brewers. With the home and pitching advantage, Milwaukee should pull off a win.

Cardinals starter Andre Pallante (5.28 ERA) is one of my favourite fades (sorry bud!) and 4 of his last 5 starts have resulted in a loss for St. Louis. With Pallante having allowed 27 hits over his last 4 starts, my money‚Äôs on Milwaukee‚Äôs offense to redeem themselves and score at least 5.¬†

1nf71yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1nf71yq/explore_why_soilove_laundry_stain_remover_is_a/,Explore Why Soilove Laundry Stain Remover Is a Game Changer for Clothes,"Testing out the Soilove SLLSR11PK4AMZ1 laundry stain remover for my laundry was more intriguing than I had anticipated. With a household that consists of two kids, a dog that somehow constantly finds mud, and a partner who loves cooking with colorful spices, you can imagine the challenges I face keeping clothes spot-free. I decided to give this enzyme-based stain fighter a try, curious to see if it truly delivered on its claims of tackling tough stains like grease, ink, grass, and even red wine.

**Packaging and Initial Impressions**  
Unpacking the Soilove SLLSR11PK4AMZ1 was straightforward. It comes in a set of four 16oz bottles, which is great because having this much stain remover on hand feels practical, especially for a busy family like mine. The bottles themselves are lightweight and fit neatly in my laundry room cabinets, which is a plus in terms of storage. The instructions printed on the label are simple to follow: just apply, rub, and let the solution do its job. Something about the way it‚Äôs marketed‚Äî‚Äùpowerful prewash enzyme stain remover‚Äù‚Äîreally makes you feel it‚Äôs worth giving a serious shot.

**Application and Ease of Use**  
What stood out when I first used this product was how versatile and user-friendly it is. You apply a small amount of the liquid directly onto the stain and rub lightly. It clings nicely to the fabric, which made me think it was actually penetrating deep into the fibers. I found it especially convenient that I could leave it to sit on the fabric, and even if I didn‚Äôt wash the garment for an hour or so, it still managed to tackle the stain effectively.

[Check Soilove SLLSR11PK4AMZ1 price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b0845rv6zg/)

**Target Users**  
In my opinion, this product is perfect for households juggling frequent laundry with different stain problems. From the stubborn pen ink stains on my child‚Äôs school uniforms to the grass stains from weekend soccer practice, this remover handled each challenge surprisingly well. Even my husband‚Äôs grease-laden barbecue apron saw improvements after pretreatment with Soilove. Since it‚Äôs safe to use on colorfast fabrics and compatible with both high-efficiency (HE) and standard washing machines, I think it caters to nearly everyone with a washing machine at home.

**Positives**  
This laundry stain remover has several winning points that made it stand out to me.  

- Tackles a wide variety of stains like blood, grease, and makeup.  
- Works well on diverse fabrics and is safe for colored clothes.  
- Prewash enzymes really seem to penetrate deep without damaging fabrics.  

It‚Äôs impressive to have something so versatile in my laundry arsenal. The convenience of not needing a different product for each type of stain means a lot to me.

**Potential Weaknesses**  
Still, there are areas for improvement that I noticed during my testing.  

- The liquid consistency is a bit thin, and if you dispense too much, it can drip onto unintended areas.  
- While effective on fresh stains, older, more set-in ones might require multiple treatments.  
- The lack of a fresh or pleasant scent felt like a missed opportunity for enhanced user experience.  

These shortcomings are worth noting, especially for users who might be looking for an all-in-one magic solution that handles even disasters like set-in coffee stains effortlessly in a single go.

**Competing Brands**  
When thinking about alternatives, OxiClean stands out as a big competitor. I‚Äôve used their stain remover spray in the past, which also works well for prewashing. However, one edge the Soilove product has over OxiClean is how concentrated it feels on impact; you don‚Äôt need to soak your stained garment, and it doesn‚Äôt foam excessively like some other products. Tide pens and sprays are another go-to in the market, especially for portability, but they don‚Äôt offer such consistent results for larger garment sections like Soilove does. With this enzyme-based solution, you have something both powerful and cost-effective for home use.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For the price point, this stain remover is an affordable quality product, particularly considering you get four bottles in the package. I calculated that my household could go at least 4‚Äì6 months without needing to restock, which is excellent. While there are cheaper alternatives out there, such as generic supermarket brands, they don‚Äôt deliver the same level of performance as this. It‚Äôs safe to say this product provides true value for what it offers.

1nf70sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1nf70sm/i_setup_everything_and_then_barely_do_anything_at/,I setup everything and then barely do anything at work,"A year ago, I landed a fully remote job as a project coordinator for a MNC. The interview process was tough - behavioral rounds, a case study, and a final interview where I had to outline how I‚Äôd manage multiple projects at once. It made the job sound fast-paced, and a little intimidating.

But today, I‚Äôm sitting in my home at 10.30am, sipping coffee, staring at my calendar, and realizing I have‚Ä¶ nothing urgent to do. Again.

My first month was crazy. I set up project timelines, created dashboards for tracking, and streamlined how our team updated weekly reports. My manager was impressed and called me a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù because I set up automated reminders for overdue tasks.

Then things slowed down. Once the initial setup was done, my daily workload shrank to some emails, occasional check-in meetings, and ‚Äúurgent‚Äù requests.

For meetings, I barely pay attention. I recommend people to start using AI (fathom) to summarize and get action items. My 50-year-old director called me a ‚Äútechie‚Äù for doing that. Man, I don‚Äôt even like tech that much.

Last week, my manager asked if I remembered a decision we made two months ago - I typed a keyword into my second brain app (saner) and had the answer for him right away. And he asked me whether I have ‚Äúphotographic memory‚Äù. Sir, I don‚Äôt even remember my friends‚Äô birthday.

Most of my time is now spent appearing busy. I keep a detailed GDoc page open during Zoom calls so it looks like I‚Äôm working hard

I schedule slack message to send later in the days, while I actually finished them in maybe, 20 minutes

Sometimes, I feel guilty about how little I actually do.

I‚Äôve picked up hobbies. I‚Äôve learned to make fresh pasta. Started decorating my house. I‚Äôve read more books this year than in the last two combined.

Every now and then, I panic that my manager will catch on and fire me during these silent layoffs, but last week, she told me I‚Äôm doing ‚Äúan incredible job keeping everything on track‚Äù So yeah...",4,1757692684.0,confession,0,1.0,False

hey yalll i‚Äôm 21 and im in nursing school, these past 3 months ive been on campus and basically there‚Äôs this boy M22 in my class who‚Äôs been talking to me. i usually sit in a different row but he started sitting near me, like two chairs down and talking to me. i thought he was friendly but didn‚Äôt think anything more of it. anyways he‚Äôs funny and bubbly and genuinely thought we were just friends. anyways a few days ago he asked for my number so we can go ‚Äústudy‚Äù for an upcoming exam and so i agreed. i gave it to him and he confessed that he also wanted to ask me out so i said yes. we got coffee yesterday or he got coffee, i got water cuz i was so nervous and we talked for a while and then went to my car and made out a bit... i wasn‚Äôt planning it but it kinda just happened, i enjoyed it.

he‚Äôs nerdy and cringe to say so the least but we both had fun and i found out a lot about his childhood and his ex gf. which only reason why i brought her up is because she‚Äôs in our class. they haven‚Äôt dated in over a year but live with each other out of convenience (both of their parents are kinda abusive and they didn‚Äôt want to move back in with the parents/find other roommates) i think it‚Äôs important to mention that she has a lot of health issues so going to the er is a regular occurrence and he usually takes her. so i think he feels obligated to take care of her? i dont have an issue with him living with her SHORT TERM because he doesn‚Äôt like her, the issue is she‚Äôll still hold his hand because of her ‚Äòanxiety‚Äô or ask him to kiss her to comfort her but will also invite men over to their apartment but doesn‚Äôt allow him the same. he told me about how he came home with hickeys one day and she screamed at him. 

anyways i can‚Äôt tell him to move out, esp this early on in the relationship but he‚Äôs planning on staying there till he graduates sooo june 2027. but i can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôll be an issue or not. he‚Äôs gotten better at telling her no but you can kinda tell while talking to him that he doesn‚Äôt have the best self esteem, his mom tried choking him when he was younger and he ran away from home, so i‚Äôm not going to pick at his behaviors as a lot of people got into his head and from what i understood it seems like he has worked on himself a lot.

i live at home with my parents who are strict but if i could i‚Äôd have him live with me, at the same time i can‚Äôt move out yet as im still saving up and because of school i don‚Äôt work too many shifts. i told him yesterday that kissing or holding her hand is unacceptable if he‚Äôs in a relationship and he told me it won‚Äôt happen again and hasn‚Äôt in a while. 

is it bad to tell him that at some point i expect him to move out and find a new roommate, im obviously not going to be that roommate until we‚Äôve been together for a while but i want to be able to go to my bfs place. also how do i ask someone i want them to get checked for stds, he doesn‚Äôt have many bodies but his ex gf did and i don‚Äôt want to have sex with him until i know he‚Äôs all good. i‚Äôm willing to get tested as well as i haven‚Äôt gotten tested in months but i don‚Äôt want to come off as rude, i just know a lot of symptoms are asymptomatic and maybe he has something, that‚Äôs just not a game i want to risk. and before anyone says anything about him maybe lying or still being sexually interested in her or yada yada or ‚Äúoh how do you know she‚Äôs his ex‚Äù well. only choice i have is to believe him until i have a reason not to ",1,1757692598.0,WhatShouldIDo,1,1.0,False

1nf6win,https://www.reddit.com/r/shadowhunters/comments/1nf6win/some_notes_on_city_of_ashes/,Some notes on City of Ashes,"I'm rereading the series for the first time in years and I have lots of thoughts.  So, here's my notes on City of Ashes:

(spoilers for all of TMI)

\- The writing is already much better in this book.  Way fewer nonsensical descriptions laden with similes.  The story is much more streamlined and less episodic, and the book very much relishes in not having to explain the world to the reader.  The characters are also much more likeable right from the beginning, particularly Clary, whose internal monologue is way less intense and melodramatic, which I appreciate.  But, woah, this book is *angsty*.

\- I really like following through on his experience at the Hotel Dumort being traumatic for Simon.  I know that it mostly exists to foreshadow him becoming a vampire, but I just love it when characters are actually traumatized by things that would be traumatizing for them.  It also helps establish why he pushes so hard against joining the clan after he's turned.  Why would he *ever* want to go back to that place?

\- The scene where Maryse kicks Jace out of the Institute is heartbreaking and reminded me of Simon's mom freaking out on him in COFA (for some reason that scene stuck better in my mind than this one).  I totally understand why Jace was acting out after this, even though I think he takes it *way too far* in that scene at the werewolf bar.

\- How old is Maia supposed to be?  She says that her brother died when she was a sophomore (age 15/16), then she started dating Jordan a year later (16/17).  They were together for several months, then he bit her, and it took an entire month for her to turn into a werewolf.  Then, she moved to New York and joined the pack and she says that there have been 4 pack leaders since she's joined.  I suppose that pack leaders probably don't last that long (maybe a few months each?), but going through 4 would imply it's been at least a year or so, so she's got to be at *least* 17 or 18 (if not 19) by the time this book starts  Then, when she gets kidnapped by Valentine, she says that she's 15.  The math isn't mathing.

\- I LOVE seeing Luke interact with Maryse.  I find the snippets of the differences between the former Circle members, what their lives were like in the aftermath of the Uprising, and how they handle their guilt about their involvement to be really interesting.  I could have used way more of this.

\- The romance aspect is the worst thing in this book for me.  The Climon romance is really weird (which it's supposed to be, but that doesn't mean I have to like it).  Simon is being really weird and possessive and Clary is alternating between throwing herself into it so that she can get over Jace and being kind of grossed out by the whole thing but still going along with it and it's just icky all around.  Just like the first time I read this, I was super relieved when Simon broke it off.  And the whole Clace thing isn't any better.  Incest grossness aside, I just don't think that their relationship had gone far enough in the first book for either of them to be so torn up about the whole ""we can't be together because we're siblings"" thing (ew).  It's all extremely melodramatic, when I don't think that this book really needs any additional drama.  Though that kiss in the Seelie Court is, of course, iconic.

\- Jace was really put through the trauma gauntlet in this one.  Rejected by his family, imprisoned in the Silent City, being manipulated by his abusive father, imprisoned again in the Institute, having to fight the demon of fear, having someone sacrifice their life to save yours, etc.  Poor guy.

\- Alec is presented as much more competent and less tragic this book.  He is a warrior more-or-less on par with his siblings and this extends to how he behaves in group dynamics, which is much more confident (though his insecurities still shine through) and he is presented more as the leader, whereas Jace was more the leader in the first book.  I like this change, but it's pretty different from how much the first book pitied him for his insecurities and lack of fighting prowess.

\- Jace rooming with Magnus was so hilarious and was my favorite part of the book.  I wish that this had lasted forever.

\- I find the kind-of-pathetic way that Izzy behaves around Meliorn when they visit the Seelie Court (side note: Meliorn is going to jail for dating a 16 year old) to be really interesting.  She's kind of peacocking and waving the relationship in the faces of her friends and it's very teenage.  She does so much innuendo in such a short time that it almost feels like she's lying to her friends that she and Meliorn are together so that they think she's cool (though I think that canonically they are seeing each other).  And absolutely no one is impressed by it and it only makes her push it harder!  It's a rare example of Izzy being presented as immature and pathetic.  She's in this book so little (even less than the last) and I really missed her.

\- I wish there wasn't a time skip after Simon becomes a vampire.  He knew, or at least suspected, that he was turning into one, and I want to know how he reacted.  What did he say?  What did he do for those two days where he couldn't leave his room?  Also, I kind of can't believe they just brought him home and left him there without checking to make sure that he wouldn't hurt his mother.  Obviously we retrospectively know that he doesn't have much bloodlust and wouldn't hurt anyone, but the characters don't know that.  The vampires at the Dumort were borderline feral in the first book!

\- Raphael is such an interesting character and I wish he was in these books more.  He clearly has a strong sense of honor and cares a lot about the wellbeing of his clan and I think that it's interesting how sorry he seems to feel about what happened to Simon.  I don't think that Raphael fits very well with what we know about the vampire clan.  I just can't imagine someone like Raphael living in a falling down building with dozens (hundreds?) of other people.  It also sounds like most of the other vampires really want to kill and eat humans, but that doesn't sound like his style, either.  This is part of a greater issue that I have with the presentation of Downworlders within this series: there is so much messaging about how they are an oppressed group that are wrongfully targeted by Shadowhunters, but most of the random vampires, werewolves, and faeries that we see are literally inhuman and evil.  This is especially confusing when important characters that are Downworlders are extremely human.  Why do most vampires want to kill and eat people when the idea of doing that makes Simon sick?  Why is he (or Raphael or Luke or whoever) different?

\- Clary is a pretty good friend to Simon in this book.  She thinks a lot about his state of mind and is there for him and is genuinely crushed when he gets turned.  Having her act like this goes a long way in making me like her more in this book than I did in the last.  I just really wish that she would push back more on the other Shadowhunters when they treat him like garbage.

\- This book and the previous one both seem to foreshadow that Simon will one day grow to hate Clary, but that doesn't happen.  It's just so strange that this beat gets hit repeatedly and doesn't pay off at all.  Maybe it's supposed to be a mislead and the point is that he could never hate her (thus inverting our expectations and reinforcing how strong their friendship is)?  Or maybe CC just changed her mind.  It would've been really interesting to have him grow resentful of her, but I get why this didn't happen.

\- Though it effectively ruined his life, becoming a vampire is the best thing that ever happened to Simon.  It makes him re-evaluate his life and problems and shifts his primary internal conflict from ""ugh Clary doesn't love me back"" (gross) to ""I literally cannot escape this supernatural world that I already didn't like and I have to figure out who I am now"" (much more sympathetic and compelling).  The spiral he goes on while talking to Clary at Luke's house after the mid-book time skip about *what the fuck he is going to do* but keeps trying to hide his fear behind jokes is so incredibly sad and based on my memories of this series, this is just *such* a Simon moment.  His particular brand of angst really works for me and I can't explain why and it starts here.

\- I don't like Maia freaking out on Simon when she realizes that he's been turned into a vampire.  It makes her seem really unreasonable (especially since he just stands there and tries not to have a mental breakdown while she tries to kill him) and I *really* don't like Clary Shadowhunter-splaining Downworlder politics to Maia after she breaks it up.  There are a couple of other offhand remarks about vampires and werewolves not getting along, but nothing like this.  Before *and* after this, Maia is pretty rational and chill, so this kind of comes out of nowhere, doesn't really serve a purpose, and damages her character.

\- I really like Magnus as kind of a wild card.  He's willing to help everyone because of Alec (most of the time), but he doesn't like any of them and doesn't hide that.  I also really like that he uses his powers for selfish purposes, like stealing coffee or furniture.  It's just so fun.  He's great as a part of the team later on, too, but I love this.  

\- Jace's push-pull relationship with Valentine in this book is so good.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that we ever truly think that Jace would side with him, but Jace spends a lot of time with Valentine, learning about his evil plans and having very conflicted feelings towards his father.  I think that Jace has some degree of genuine love for his father, but his morals and connections with the Lightwoods are strong enough to keep him from turning to the dark side.  It's understandable that he would feel this way, especially after being rejected by his stepmother at the beginning of the book and he is starting to believe that there is something fundamentally *wrong* about him because of his feelings for Clary and his relationship with Valentine.  It's such good angst and drama and I think that this is the most compelling that Jace is in the entire series.  I think that it would have been very interesting if the series had played more with the idea of Jace as an antihero, someone who is kind of morally gray and *could go either way* but that would've been a very different series.

\- Malec is very... intense in this book.  There are so many crumbs sprinkled throughout the first half that hint at their relationship, then Jace blabs to the group that they are dating in the middle, and it seems like the relationship is already pretty serious.  They've been seeing each other since Magnus saved Alec's life at the end of COB (maybe 2 weeks ago?) and Magnus is already chomping at the bit for Alec to come out to his parents, which I think is in extreme poor taste.  Alec lives in a society that is implied to be even more homophobic than general American society in 2007, so coming out isn't exactly safe for him, and Magnus should know that!  Also, the scene where Magnus uses Alec's strength to keep the truck afloat during the final battle is very romantic but it kind of comes out of nowhere.  I get that the implication is that they both have very deep feelings for one another but Alec's repression is preventing their relationship from being what it could be, but they just haven't been seeing each other long enough for that drama to feel organic (in my opinion).

\- Clary is pretty isolated from the Shadowhunters this book.  She spends so much of the book at Luke's house, trying to contact other people to get information.  I like that she gets some distance from them and that she doesn't just fully assimilate right away.  I was almost caught off guard by how little she knows about the world and how little fighting experience she has.  I like that she doesn't immediately go full warrior goddess and has to slowly learn how to live in this world (though, from what I remember, she gets a hang of it pretty quickly after this lol).

\- I really like Alec's conversation with Jace when they are trying to break him out of the Malachi configuration near the end of the book because it puts them on an equal footing, which is so rare, and I love Alec playacting being loyal to the Clave and then going behind their backs to help Jace.  It's such a good display of his intelligence and what sets him apart from characters like Jace, Clary, or Izzy, who are basically chaos agents and do whatever they want.  Alec plays it a bit smarter than that.

\- This is addressed within the book, but Jace has a pretty serious death wish to the point that I would say that, at least in this book, he is suicidal.  He actively seeks out dangerous situations, refuses help, and, multiple times, has moments where he just resigns himself to the idea of dying without feeling conflicted about it at all.  Put this boy in therapy immediately!

\- The scene where Simon bites Jace is literally insane!  CC must have known what she was doing when she wrote it to be *that* homoerotic.  I love how often it comes up later (~~because they both thought it was hot and can't stop thinking about it~~).  I'm a Jimon warrior until I die.  I love how this scene ties in with Jace's death wish.  ""I could have killed you."" ""I would have let you."" \*screams\*.

\- The Inquisitor is kind of clumsily handled, in my opinion.  They go too hard with making her unreasonable in how she handles Jace and his situation and don't justify her last-minute turnaround to sacrifice her life to save his at the end.  I would have much preferred that she found out he was her grandson a day or two before the final battle (they don't need to reveal exactly *what* she learned about Jace, only that she learned something that made her sympathize with him more), and maybe we get a POV of her feeling conflicted about how she treated him, then we do the sacrifice.  Also, I don't care if there is a Herondale family birthmark (a concept that I hate), I don't think that she should have been so sure of who Jace was after she saw the mark on his shoulder.  She should have at least had to think about it.  If I were her, I'd be like, ""Am I *sure* that is the right mark? Is there any way that it could be something else?"" instead of immediately jumping in front of a demon.  The one thing that I really like about her is that she projects her own feelings about her son onto Valentine, believing that Valentine would love Jace no matter what, but that clearly isn't the case.

\- I think that Simon becoming a Daylighter is at least part of why he rails so hard against accepting being a vampire.  Being able to go out in sunlight allows him that little bit of leeway to pretend like nothing has changed and delude himself into thinking that he can just keep having a normal life.  I was surprised at how much he was accepting it at first, then, once we come back to him in the epilogue, he's like ""btw I'm gonna have a normal life now!""  If this hadn't happened, I think that he would have accepted everything a lot faster, though it probably would've caused other emotional problems to replace the whole denial thing.  Also, I love that after he realizes he can go out in sunlight, he goes cat mode and hangs out in every patch of sunlight he can.  It's so cute.",2,1757692413.0,shadowhunters,1,1.0,False

1nf6vce,https://i.redd.it/3tsk9ajp9rof1.jpeg,"A few notes on addiction, aka getting just one more watch...","For people here, me among them, what we are seeking from our watch is a feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction that lasts.  

Beauty often has that effect, but it does not last.

  
The greatest watches are beautiful works of art: the design, the engineering, the movement, the evolution of its mechanism, the perfection of its various parts, the visual delight, the satisfaction at seeing the hands move, ...

  
We admire them, but we cannot afford them, so we get a replica which is very close to the original.  The beauty is unmistakable.  And we are bewitched and entranced and are happy for a few days.

  
But the feeling passes.  And we wish to recapture it.  And we order a new watch.  And the cycle starts and continues.

I think it is a sign of emptiness in other aspects of our lives.  It is likely that our lives are not very meaningful and don't provide us with a healthy does of fulfillment.

I also think it is worthwhile to want to end this addiction to these surrogate means of fulfillment.  But that can only happen if we understand it, and why we seek it.

A new work of beauty, or of art, in our hands, is like a drug that lasts only so long.  Soon the emptiness consumes us again, and we again need to have a shiny new thing.

Just be aware.  After getting one or few of these, stop wasting more of your money on these trinkets.  Go on a hike, cook a great meal and invite your friends or neighbors to taste it, write a nice letter, have a nice cup of coffee in an outdoors cafe while watching the sky, ... Don't be a slave to these urges.",2,1757692337.0,RepTime,2,0.75,False

Kung gagawin mo lang ako pang feed sa mga fantasies mo, wag na please parang awa niyo na hindi ko kaya maging pang fubu lang grabe ang attachment issue ko.

I'm looking for someone na older than me (max 39) na who loves playing pc or mobile games (hindi deal breaker kung di ka into gaming) na pwede i-stream sa akin sa discord or kung kaya ay magkwento rin about sa nilalaro.

Huling game na napanood ko ay sa Arena Breakout, di ko maintindihan pa pero hopefully may naglalaro non na kaya ipa-intindi sa akin. Mahilig din ako manood ng Valo, Leauge, Dota, Kingdom of hearts or any multiplayer/rpg/survival games. I don't mind if you are single father, nasa 30 plus na, nag-uumpisa pa lang, malaki ang tiyan, 5'4 ang height or kung anuman yan.

I just wanted someone na I can grow, laugh and cry with,  kaya akong intindihin, protektahan in public at i-korek in private, can listen and answer sa mga rants ko, ready akong mahalin ng tama, handa ako makinig sa mga kung ano ik-kwento mo, if gusto mo ng coffee pagtitimpla kita; kung gusto mo ng food, ipagluluto kita; kung gusto mo hilot, hihilutin kita.

1nf6od7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1nf6od7/my_unpopular_opinion_the_greeks_s02_were_badly/,My unpopular opinion: The Greeks (S02) were badly portrayed,"I'm now on my 5th or 6th watch of The Wire, and something that bugged me about three viewings in ‚Äî and now bugs the hell out of me ‚Äî is the *hacky* portrayal of the Greeks in season 2. You have Vondas, played by Paul Ben-Victor, and of course, ""The Greek,"" played by Bill Raymond. Both are veteran character actors, but the horrendously fake accents that come and go in each line of dialogue, together with the goofy props (Vondas' ever-present coffee cup and cigarette, the ivy hat like he just got off the boat, the Greek's beads) made their portayal feel caricaturish. 

To me, their portrayal stands in stark contrast to the rich character building of the Polish-American stevedore roots of the Sobotkas and the rest of the International Brotherhood. And of course, especially in contrast to the incredible accents and stories of all them boys slinging dope on the corrners. 

I thought Chris Ashworth did a much more convincing job of playing Sergei Malatov.

Flame away. I know everyone loves the Greeks. Any other characters feel unconvincing to you?",0,1757691887.0,TheWire,24,0.38,False
1nf6o4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nf6o4u/being_a_nightmare_to_get_out_of_eating/,Being a nightmare to get out of eating,"This is an open letter to my parents. One they‚Äôll never read, since they don‚Äôt use reddit and I‚Äôm never going to send it to them. I was briefly considering setting up a dead man‚Äôs switch but God knows I have enough anorexia related memory issues that I‚Äôd end up forgetting to reset it. This isn‚Äôt a conversation I‚Äôm planning on actually having with my parents any time soon and certainly not by accident. While I no longer live with them, that‚Äôs still a special kind of embarrassment I‚Äôd rather not experience.



When I was fourteen-ish, I developed an eating disorder. Specifically anorexia subtype restrictive, which evolved into a mix of restriction with the occasional binge and some semi-frequent purging. But the details aren‚Äôt super important and besides, I‚Äôve gone into so much detail on every aspect of my disordered eating everywhere else. Shiny labels aside, I was skipping meals and losing weight. Skipping breakfast and lunch was easy enough. I could get away with an unfortunately sweetener-free black coffee for breakfast and throw away my lunch when I got to school. Occasionally, I‚Äôd have an apple or sneak something from my friends and wash it down with a Monster Ultra Zero or a Gatorade Zero from the vending machine. Anything I could get away with burning during gym or track.



Skipping dinner was, unfortunately, a lot harder. My parents had this bizarre concept called ‚Äúfamily dinners,‚Äù where once they got off work, we (them, me and my sister) would all eat dinner together ‚Äúlike a family.‚Äù What kind of Brady Bunch shit is that, right? I would‚Äôve been totally fine with sitting at the dinner table and watching my family eat. I did that all the time with my friends at lunch if I wasn‚Äôt hiding in my English classroom. But nope! Crazily enough, my parents actually wanted me to eat my dinner, as well as hold a halfway coherent conversation with them and my sister. Which is for the most part impossible when your declining brain power is entirely fixated on exactly how fucked you are after each bite. One night, I was dissecting an overly large piece of lasagna or casserole (I remember the layers) on a day that my mother had a particularly bad day at work. This annoyed her and she snapped at me when she told me to eat my dinner. As a teenager that hadn‚Äôt eaten in hours and hours as well as the inheritor of her temper, I was angry too. So I snapped back that I wasn‚Äôt going to eat something like this, something that disgusting. Which, understandably, further pissed off my mother who told me that if I was going to talk like that, I could spend the rest of the night in my room.



I might barely remember what I learned in school at that grade, I‚Äôll never forget what I learned from my mother that night. If I pissed off my parents enough, I would never be forced to eat dinner again.



Nearly every night afterwards (because let‚Äôs face it, sometimes I was really hungry and sometimes the food was really good), I was a fucking nightmare. As a child, I had some emotional issues growing up but nothing like this. I did everything in my power to make dinner as hellish as possible for my parents in the hopes that I would be sent to my room without finishing. And it worked, like really well. Call the food disgusting? Sent to my room. Say that I hated ‚Äúall of this bullshit?‚Äù No dinner that night. Complain incessantly about something my parents did? I‚Äôd better clear my plate and disappear until morning. All this complaining, cursing, snapping, arguing, yelling, crying and fighting with my parents was a complete 180 of how I had behaved with them my entire life. I loved (and still love) my parents but as exhausting and intense as this was, it was working and I couldn‚Äôt stop. Not with how well it was working and how much weight I was losing.



So yeah. I did this nearly every night we had dinner together for upwards of two years, from age fourteen to sixteen-ish. Eventually, my parents seemed to decide that I was old enough to fend for myself at dinner time and occasionally make dinner for the whole family. This was mostly due to my parents working harder and longer hours than any meal related meltdowns but it was a welcome change either way. As soon as I wasn‚Äôt being forced to eat while I was sitting at the dinner table or could just eat what I wanted, my behaviour completely changed. All the intense anger and general unpleasantness of my moods at dinnertime evaporated like they had never existed at all. I was fine, almost like that happy kid I hadn‚Äôt been in years, comfortable to be around my family if I didn‚Äôt have to eat.



And yeah, that‚Äôs pretty much it. I was horrible to my parents nearly every night for two years in the hopes of getting sent to my room without dinner. They never caught onto why I was such a fucking nightmare all the time either. Which is definitely feeding some weird, unexplainable guilt deep inside me. In the moment, I was only focused on doing whatever I could to avoid every calorie and bite I could. Eight years later, there‚Äôs this strange weight in my chest about the whole thing. I never wanted to actually upset my parents or anything like that, but I did and that was shitty of me.¬†



So mom and dad, if you‚Äôre reading this, I was never actually pissed at either of you. I just had (and still have) a deadly mental illness that makes me irrationally afraid of eating food and gaining weight or ‚Äúlooking fat.‚Äù Which is especially aggravating, since I have a level of body dysmorphia that makes it impossible for me to have a rational view of my own body. I love you both so much, I just hate myself and my body with just as much feeling and intensity.

1nf6nc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1nf6nc0/just_started_yesterday_wish_i_started_way_sooner/,Just started yesterday!!! Wish I started WAY sooner,"It was sitting in my fridge for about 3 weeks before I started it. I was nervous from reading about everyone‚Äôs side effects (but in my last post I made y‚Äôall were *very* reassuring that it probably won‚Äôt happen) and I‚Äôm also super scared of needles. I suck it up and deal with it at the doctor‚Äôs but doing it myself???? Nope! But I did it :)

I‚Äôve had no negative side effects so far (like nausea) thankfully. I felt not hungry at all yesterday it was such a strange feeling, and I didn‚Äôt even really want to stuff my face either! 

Before I took the dose around 1pm, I was drinking a protein coffee I made and that kept me feeling full for like the WHOLE day. Even at 9 when I finished making soup I wasn‚Äôt even that hungry, I just knew I should eat something lol. I only ate maybe 3/4 cup before I tapped out and couldn‚Äôt eat anymore. 

I even had a mini chocolate chip cookie and when my bf offered me another one, I didn‚Äôt want it! If this was two days ago I probably would‚Äôve had five of those. This is so awesome!!!!!! 

To go from being such an emotional binge eater to tapping out after one mini chocolate chip cookie makes me really happy. I like how this makes me feel and I‚Äôm excited to fix my relationship with food, lose weight, and get healthy!! I wish I started as soon as I got it",8,1757691819.0,Zepbound,7,1.0,False

I‚Äôve lived here the longest, so most of the furniture and d√©cor in the living room and dining area is mine, I furnished it when I first moved in. I'm a Hellenic Polytheist and I have a small altar set up on a bookshelf against the wall near the kitchen/dining space. I pray there, leave offerings, and it‚Äôs an important part of my routine. I don't interact with it in front of others. Recently, one of my roommates (23F) messaged our group chat asking me to move my altar into my bedroom. She said the living space ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt feel neutral‚Äù and that she wants it to be a neutral space for everyone ‚Äúenergy-wise.‚Äù 

She's been living here for months, and I even pointed the altar out to her when she first toured the apartment. I explained that it was there before she moved in, that it‚Äôs important to me to keep it near the kitchen, and that it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs taking over the space, it‚Äôs just a small bookshelf. I offered to remove specific things if they made her uncomfortable (like certain statues), but I said moving the whole altar would be a huge deal for me. She then said she feels unwelcome in the common space in general, that there‚Äôs too much of my stuff, she can‚Äôt use the coffee table or sit on the couch because of ‚Äústuff on them,‚Äù and that she feels like she‚Äôs interrupting private conversations when she comes out of her room. I told her the coffee table just has trays that can be moved, and the plushies on the couch can literally just be shifted aside. These are decorations that I bought specifically for these places in the apartment. I said that she‚Äôs welcome to add whatever d√©cor she wants until she feels comfortable.

She also claimed that she avoids touching any of the kitchen appliances because she is afraid we will ""yell at her,"" however no one has yelled at her or made her unwelcome intentionally, so I fear she might be projecting past roommate trauma onto this situation. I stayed firm on the stance that until she can give me a more concrete reason, the altar is staying where it is. I offered to move it to a different part of the living room, but she refuses to come to any sort of compromise. I asked her to explain what exactly the problem is, and her text was ""you have no right to demand I explain my every thought to you,"" but I don't want her every thought. I'm happy to hear her out, but she just isn't explaining why the altar is suddenly a problem or what she wants me to do about it other than get rid of it completely. She has now stated that she won't ever speak to me again because I don't respect her. 

I feel like she‚Äôs asking me to give up something that is deeply meaningful to me just to make the space ‚Äúneutral,‚Äù when she could just add her own things and make it shared. I really don't want to be an AH or ruin my relationship with her, but I can't put my practices on pause because one day she said so.",5,1757691660.0,AmItheAsshole,52,0.6,False

Crazily enough, my parents actually wanted me to eat my dinner, as well as hold a halfway coherent conversation with them and my sister. Which is for the most part impossible when your declining brain power is entirely fixated on exactly how fucked you are after each bite. One night, I was dissecting an overly large piece of lasagna or casserole (I remember the layers) on a day that my mother had a particularly bad day at work. This annoyed her and she snapped at me when she told me to eat my dinner. As a teenager that hadn‚Äôt eaten in hours and hours as well as the inheritor of her temper, I was angry too. So I snapped back that I wasn‚Äôt going to eat something like this, something that disgusting. Which, understandably, further pissed off my mother who told me that if I was going to talk like that, I could spend the rest of the night in my room.



I might barely remember what I learned in school at that grade, I‚Äôll never forget what I learned from my mother that night. If I pissed off my parents enough, I would never be forced to eat dinner again.



Nearly every night afterwards (because let‚Äôs face it, sometimes I was really hungry and sometimes the food was really good), I was a fucking nightmare. As a child, I had some emotional issues growing up but nothing like this. I did everything in my power to make dinner as hellish as possible for my parents in the hopes that I would be sent to my room without finishing. And it worked, like really well. Call the food disgusting? Sent to my room. Say that I hated ‚Äúall of this bullshit?‚Äù No dinner that night. Complain incessantly about something my parents did? I‚Äôd better clear my plate and disappear until morning. All this complaining, cursing, snapping, arguing, yelling, crying and fighting with my parents was a complete 180 of how I had behaved with them my entire life. I loved (and still love) my parents but as exhausting and intense as this was, it was working and I couldn‚Äôt stop. Not with how well it was working and how much weight I was losing.



So yeah. I did this nearly every night we had dinner together for upwards of two years, from age fourteen to sixteen-ish. Eventually, my parents seemed to decide that I was old enough to fend for myself at dinner time and occasionally make dinner for the whole family. This was mostly due to my parents working harder and longer hours than any meal related meltdowns but it was a welcome change either way. As soon as I wasn‚Äôt being forced to eat while I was sitting at the dinner table or could just eat what I wanted, my behaviour completely changed. All the intense anger and general unpleasantness of my moods at dinnertime evaporated like they had never existed at all. I was fine, almost like that happy kid I hadn‚Äôt been in years, comfortable to be around my family if I didn‚Äôt have to eat.



And yeah, that‚Äôs pretty much it. I was horrible to my parents nearly every night for two years in the hopes of getting sent to my room without dinner. They never caught onto why I was such a fucking nightmare all the time either. Which is definitely feeding some weird, unexplainable guilt deep inside me. In the moment, I was only focused on doing whatever I could to avoid every calorie and bite I could. Eight years later, there‚Äôs this strange weight in my chest about the whole thing. I never wanted to actually upset my parents or anything like that, but I did and that was shitty of me.¬†



So mom and dad, if you‚Äôre reading this, I was never actually pissed at either of you. I just had (and still have) a deadly mental illness that makes me irrationally afraid of eating food and gaining weight or ‚Äúlooking fat.‚Äù Which is especially aggravating, since I have a level of body dysmorphia that makes it impossible for me to have a rational view of my own body. I love you both so much, I just hate myself and my body with just as much feeling and intensity.

1nf6h1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nf6h1t/it_can_change/,It can change,"Since 2023, I was a shell of my former self. I had severe panic attacks almost every day and it was truly awful. Driving to work? Panic attack. Grocery store visit? Panic attack. Sitting in my living room watching a harmless YT video? Panic attack.

I had health anxiety, and if I felt weird, I‚Äôd convince myself I was having a health incident. It started when I took Wellbutrin for about three days then convinced myself I was going to have a seizure. After that, I spiraled. I‚Äôd go through some short periods where I‚Äôd feel a bit better, but I mostly felt awful all the time and had a very small life. 

One major thing that, I think, contributed to my health anxiety was that I was very pre-diabetic and I didn‚Äôt know it. I think I‚Äôd feel a bit weird because my blood sugar would drop, so I‚Äôd have a panic attack because I didn‚Äôt understand why I felt weird. I‚Äôd get pale and feel dizzy, it was fucked up. Fortunately, I was able to mostly correct the pre-diabetes by having a strict diet and exercising. Of course, this wasn‚Äôt the only factor.

I was working a high-pressure, long hours job in television. I still work that same job, but in a different role. I was the hands-on video production lead, but now I‚Äôm more of an admin who does some editing. I also convinced my boss to make my job remote. Though I think in-person might have been better for my mental health, remote work helped a lot in my early recovery because, if I had a panic attack, I could just deal with it in the comfort of my own home rather than having it in public.

I moved in with my mum to help take care of her. She‚Äôs very sick herself. Before, I lived alone so all the bills were on me, but living with her we split everything, so less pressure. Also, my mum and I are quite close so we help each other out. I feel like a loser sometimes, but I have a social life and she feels more like a roommate and less like a parent so it‚Äôs fine.

Like I mentioned, my diet is really solid and I get a lot of exercise. This helps me clear my mind and process my emotions in a healthy way. I must say, though, that at the height of my panic disorder I don‚Äôt think I could have gotten a lot of exercise because I was so inhibited. I remember every time I went for a walk, I‚Äôd need to stop because I‚Äôd feel so nervous that I‚Äôd almost pass out.

I did some therapy last year, but I couldn‚Äôt continue because I had to move. It was enough to get over the hump, though.

One major change is that I stopped having caffeine altogether. For a morning coffee, I just put in one scoop of regular coffee, and the other four scoops are decaf. It might be placebo, but I used to notice that I‚Äôd have more panics if I was over caffeinated. Regardless, caffeine sets me off so I won‚Äôt have it.

I have not used any medication. I was prescribed zoloft and xanax, but I only used half a xanax in severe scenarios. I know medication helps some people, but I didnt want to deal with the side effects.

I feel at peace for the first time in years. I have a life. I do things and I‚Äôm not just barely getting by. Nothing about this post is prescriptive, I‚Äôm just sharing that things can get better. Around this time last year, I thought I‚Äôd need to be in a mental health facility for the rest of my life, but I‚Äôm finally doing well again. Sometimes, I‚Äôll be on the verge of a panic attack, but I‚Äôm able to sort of switch it off.

This is my first ever Reddit post. I‚Äôve been reading this subreddit for a while, because I‚Äôve been eager to upgrade my coffee set-up.

I‚Äôm based in the EU, so I‚Äôve eliminated some options, because I don‚Äôt want to pay tariffs, VAT and deal with the shipping.

Currently I have a 1Zpresso K ultra and a basic Hario V60. I‚Äôve been rocking this set-up for 2-3 years and it‚Äôs been great thus far.

However I‚Äôm missing some good espresso and basic milk drinks. I got a Wacaco Picopresso for a recent trip to test myself with espresso.

I pulled shots that both me, my wife and my friends liked quite a lot. Both medium-light and dark roasts. 

I found that I prefer lighter roasts more than darker ones and on I‚Äôve been researching thoroughly for 6+ months.

Right now I‚Äôm considering the Quick Mill Pop-Up with a Lagom Casa grinder. 

Based on my research this should be a solid option for light roasts quite and a machine that‚Äôs quite capable and versatile.

Here are the questions:

1. Is this a good set-up for an espresso newbie? I‚Äôm not very handy so modding is not an option (Gaggiamate, Gagguino and etc.)

I‚Äôm willing to spend more on the grinder, because it will probably last longer and make a larger impact. It‚Äôs just that the lagom Casa seems like a great steal for the price, and right at the point of diminishing returns (for a non-expert).

2. Is a flat burr grinder really a must for lighter roasts? If so what‚Äôs a good flat burr grinder? 

Based on what I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs not so clear cut and conical grinders can also be great for lighter roasts, but given I‚Äôve only read and never used a grinder, apart from the K Ultra, I prefer asking.


3. What accessories and tools would you recommend? I intend to get the cheapest WDT tool, a good self-levelling tamper, a basic knock box. I haven‚Äôt researched baskets and scales though

Anyway, every feedback is welcome and I‚Äôm sorry if the post is not formatted all that great - this I my first ever Reddit post and I wrote it on my phone üòÖ

1nf64jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nf64jy/what_fall_scented_candles_fit_perfectly_in_cozy/,What fall scented candles fit perfectly in cozy rooms?,"Hey everyone! As someone who's absolutely obsessed with making my home feel cozy during fall, I wanted to share my experience with fall scented candles and how they've completely transformed my living space.

I recently went through a major home makeover phase, focusing on creating that perfect autumn atmosphere. You know that feeling when you walk into a room and instantly feel warm and comfortable? That's exactly what I was going for.

After trying countless fall scented candles (seriously, my credit card was giving me concerned looks), I've discovered some amazing combinations that work wonders. The key is to match the candle's scent with your room's purpose.

For living rooms, I've found that pumpkin spice and vanilla combinations work incredibly well. They're not too overwhelming but still give that classic fall feeling. You can find some amazing options here: https://athometouch.com/fall-scented-candles

In bedrooms, I prefer lighter scents like apple cinnamon or maple. They're subtle enough not to disturb your sleep but still maintain that cozy autumn vibe. My recent favorite has been a maple bourbon scent - it's sophisticated without being too heavy.

For those who love spending time in the kitchen (like me!), try cranberry or apple pie scented candles. They complement cooking smells perfectly and create this amazing harvest atmosphere. Speaking of which, I recently discovered some great kitchen-friendly options at https://athometouch.com/fall-scented-candles that really hit the spot.

Here's a pro tip: Layer your scents! Place different fall candles in connected rooms to create a subtle scent journey throughout your home. Just make sure the fragrances complement each other - you don't want your house smelling like a perfume shop explosion!

And remember, placement is key. Keep candles away from drafts, but where their warmth can spread easily through the room. I like putting them on coffee tables or mantels, somewhere central where they can work their magic.

Price-wise, I've learned that expensive doesn't always mean better. Some of my favorite fall candles have been surprisingly affordable, and they last just as long as the fancy ones.

Safety note: Always keep an eye on burning candles and use proper holders. Nothing ruins the cozy vibe faster than a fire hazard!

1nf5y45,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEarReviews/comments/1nf5y45/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_cuisinart_brew/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Cuisinart Brew Central Review Worth It,"The Cuisinart LK6565000C has quickly become a staple appliance in my kitchen. As someone who can‚Äôt function without a good cup of coffee in the morning, I gave this coffee maker a try, and it‚Äôs been an interesting experience. The first thing that stood out to me was its sleek, silver and black design, which blends seamlessly with the aesthetic of my kitchen countertops. I could tell Cuisinart wasn‚Äôt messing around with this one, emphasizing both style and functionality.

**Ease of Programming and Settings**  
The 24-hour programmability feature is a game changer for anyone like me who wakes up groggy and half-asleep. I‚Äôve set it the night before, and the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafts through my kitchen just as my alarm goes off. It‚Äôs like having an extra pair of hands in the morning. The adjustable auto shutoff has also saved me more than a few face-palm moments. You know, those times when you leave the house and wonder if you turned the coffee maker off? Problem solved here. That said, programming it took a bit of trial and error the first time, but once you get the hang of it, it's smooth sailing.  

[Check Cuisinart LK6565000C price on Amazon.](https://sohdu.com/p/b0bpc31zdf/)

**Brew Strength Options Make a Difference**  
Whether you prefer your coffee on the milder side or bold enough to wake the dead, this machine caters to both. The adjustable brew strength button is simple to use, and my household has definitely tested the regular versus bold brew options on more occasions than I can count. Regular strength seems to meet the general crowd's preference, while bold is my choice when a long day looms ahead. If there‚Äôs such a thing as brewing the ‚Äúperfect cup,‚Äù this machine might have just cracked the code.  

**14-Cup Capacity and Heating Plate Functionality**  
Let‚Äôs talk capacity: 14 cups! Yes, you read that right. Whether you‚Äôre fuelling a team working from home or simply pacing yourself through endless conference calls, this carafe size has your back. While I don‚Äôt often need the full capacity, I do love knowing it‚Äôs available. The heating plate is a lifesaver, especially for my spouse, who always pours a cup long after I‚Äôve had my share. It keeps the coffee warm for up to four hours, which sounds excessive until you realize how comforting it is to sip hot coffee at any point in the morning without reheating.  

**Build Quality and Design**  
From the stainless steel finish to the sturdy glass carafe, this coffee maker feels premium. The easy-grip handle on the carafe was an underrated perk I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd care about until my hands were full, and I could pour without fumbling. While I think the backlit LCD display is a modern touch, it‚Äôs worth noting that, depending on your angle or lighting, the screen can sometimes be a little tricky to read. The water window is clear and straightforward, so filling the water reservoir is relatively foolproof.

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Coffee makers can be a hassle to clean, but this model simplifies things with its self-cleaning mode. When that little indicator light signals it‚Äôs time to decalcify, I just run the self-clean cycle, and voil√†‚Äîback to brewing fresh coffee. It‚Äôs definitely not the most exciting chore, but kudos to the engineers for minimizing my elbow grease obligations. I did find, however, that the reusable filter can occasionally stain easily, so giving it a proper scrub every so often is necessary.

**Merits**  
‚Ä¢ Large capacity, perfect for families or heavy coffee drinkers  
‚Ä¢ Programmable brewing ensures a fresh cup when you need it  
‚Ä¢ Adjustable settings for brew strength and hot plate temperature  

**Areas of Concern**  
‚Ä¢ LCD backlight can be challenging to read in less-than-ideal lighting  
‚Ä¢ The reusable filter requires occasional scrubbing to prevent discoloration  

**Product Rivals**  
Compared to other drip coffee machines, like those from brands such as Keurig or Breville, the Cuisinart LK6565000C holds its own. Keurig machines, while offering the speed of single-cup brewing, lack the capacity to cater to larger groups or busy mornings where cup after cup is needed. Breville's options often come with a hefty price tag and a focus on premium espresso, which means this coffee maker is a better fit for those seeking simplicity paired with high capacity. Features like the brew pause option and strength adjustment give it an edge over simpler machines, though competitors often include similar programmable features. If you‚Äôre looking for a balance of functionality and capacity without breaking the bank, this machine stands strong among its peers.

**Bang for the Buck**  
If you‚Äôre wondering whether this coffee maker offers enough to justify the purchase, my answer is a resounding yes. It checks a lot of boxes for people who value convenience, performance, and style. While it isn‚Äôt the cheapest model out there, what you‚Äôre paying for is quality, versatility, and thoughtful features like brew strength personalization and a 4-hour heating plate. Cheaper models may lack that extra layer of finesse, making this one a worthy investment for coffee enthusiasts.

Like forever was something we could tuck
under pillows and promises.

You left your love in the small things
coffee steam curling like morning prayers,
showers running like clockwork hearts,
aftercare folded into skin like lullabies.

You loved me in ways that echo.
Echo like old songs in quiet rooms,
like inside jokes that laugh themselves
into empty spaces.

One day, I‚Äôll be older.
Maybe sipping sake with a stranger,
chopsticks paused midair
and you‚Äôll slip in
uninvited
like muscle memory.

Flashbacks in the flavor.
The wasabi won‚Äôt be what stings.

I‚Äôll remember how being yours
felt like exhaling after years of holding breath.
How I handed you my chaos
and you rearranged it gently,
like furniture in a house you planned to stay in.

You didn‚Äôt just calm me.
You rewired me.
Turned my triggers into tea lights,
rage into rooms I could walk through barefoot.

You didn‚Äôt stay.
But you stayed in. 

Real love never leaves clean.
It stains. It lingers.
It leaves Tupperware emotions
stacked in the back of the fridge of your chest
you meant to throw them out,
but some days,
you just open the door
and stare.

So if this is the goodbye
if this is the soft fade to black
then let it be velvet, not void.

Let me hand you this
‚ÄúI loved you loudly.
Save some for later.‚Äù

But my question is when that happens, how many of the initial ingredient do you get?  The reason for the question is because the number of Ingredients is different between Plusle and Toxtricity:

|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Plusle (Rousing Coffee)|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|
|Toxtricity (Moomoo Milk)|6|7|9|10|12|13|14|

After level 2, the number of ingredients diverge, so I was wondering how it works with Metronome and Mimic

* Is there a secret ingredient count for Fancy Apple, Snoozy Tomato, Fancy Egg, and Pure Oil?
* Does Mimic just use the values of the Plusle or Toxtricity it is copying?
* Does the game just have two versions of the Main Skill and Metronome can trigger either?  (And if so, does that mean Metronome triggers Plus twice as often as Minus?)
* Something else?
* Or was the part where I read that they can trigger the secondary ability just a dream?

*""It starts with a hum, but ends with a choice""*



**1\] The Encounter :**

A normal day, Ethan goes to college by metro. He boards the usual 7:45 AM train, and the compartment is empty, there are 3 people on that side of the compartment. There was a lady seated opposite to him, she starts humming. Ethan thinks that she was wearing AirPods, but she wasn‚Äôt. He felt kinda weird and avoided it, she stopped humming. Later, again she started humming, but this time it was loud‚Ä¶ like loud, and then she stops it, he just looks at her, and to his horror that lady was staring right into his soul. He looked away, and later once again looked at her, and this time she was staring at him, now this scared him. He doesn‚Äôt know what to do, and by that time she took her phone out, Ethan knows that it wasn‚Äôt a good sign and he gets off of the train. Now, he started thinking about how the lady appeared, because he was traumatised. She was wearing a purple top, with black pants, pink handbag, a green phone, hair carelessly done, and she looked like she was in her forties. Ethan just tries to forget about it, and tells his experience to his friends and they laugh it off. He never knew what awaited him next.





**2\] The Mark :**

Eventually Ethan forgot about this lady and carried on with his college stuff, but all changes when he starts receiving weird texts from unknown numbers. He just avoids them because he doesn‚Äôt wanna take the risk of losing his data. He initially thought that they were some scammers trying to steal his data, he was so traumatised by that lady that if he hears someone hum he would go into ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mode. Eventually, the text messages were no longer messages but just ‚Äúna‚Ä¶na..na..‚Äù Ethan is disturbed now. He gets weird dreams in the night. He realised that he has fallen into some sort of trap.





**3\] The Pursuit :**

He was no longer imagining it. There were people watching him, not overtly but subtly. This disturbs him completely, random men smiling at him like they were familiar with him, women looking at him and whispering at each other. Then comes one night, Ethan left his college little late, and it‚Äôs twilight now, he was walking his way back and he hears someone humming, the same way the lady was humming, his heart started pounding faster, he looks back and sees no one. He reaches his house and his doorbell goes off. He comes out to find an envelope that had a black note written in silver ink which said

*‚ÄúJoin us or disappear‚Äù*

He doesn‚Äôt tell his parents, instead takes it to his room and keeps it on his table.





**4\] The Resonant Thread :**

He started searching, he found out that this envelope was sent by an organisation called ‚ÄúThe Order Of The Six Tones‚Äù it was basically an underground cult founded decades ago, no known location. He eventually learned that they recruit people based on how they react to the Leader‚Äôs hum, i.e., they recruit through resonance. They usually target the ‚Äúgifted‚Äù, musicians, empaths, dreamers or just people who are fractured enough to hear something others can‚Äôt. The Humming wasn‚Äôt music, it was Manipulation. He knew that he wasn‚Äôt chosen, he was claimed. There were 10 council members in the cult, and 50 members, but not all 60 showed up, only 7 were active in the cult‚Äôs activities. The cult‚Äôs main day was on September 13 of every year, where all the members and new people who were recruited by others would gather, Ethan was expected to attend that Grand Feast, which was just 2 days later.





**5\] The Gathering :**

Ethan decides to show up, he told his parents that he has special classes till 5 PM and goes to the meeting, he reached the building where the feast is supposed to happen, and he goes inside. The volunteer looks at him and nods, like he was expecting Ethan‚Äôs arrival. He goes to the hall, and finds the Council members seated in a semi circle, when he entered all the attention was towards him. The leader stood up and welcomed him. All of them wearing a purple shirt with a black overcoat, they eventually said that purple signifies royalty and rarity, hence purple is their cult‚Äôs uniform. Without further delay, the leader makes Ethan sit right next to her, and they begin their rituals. It was a dark setting, with candle lights, faint blue light, with strong humming. Ethan standing cluelessly, looks at the rest of the people. The ritual only lasted for an hour, and the leader asked everyone to be seated. They were given a grand meal, only time Ethan was thankful for what had happened that day, because the food was too good and he never had eaten food like that before. After the meal the leader goes up to him¬†

*‚ÄúTake two days,‚Äù she said, her tone neither threatening nor pleading. ‚ÄúListen to the world. If it sings to you‚Ä¶ come back. If it doesn‚Äôt, walk away.‚Äù*





**6\] When the World Sings :**

The first day, he wakes up in the morning feeling better than ever. He goes to his college, a teacher who never knew about Ethan started praising about how attentive he was during the class. His friends are being nicer to him, on his way back home, he meets his friend after a long time, and she offers to go out and have a coffee with him. He thought of telling this to her, but he just didn‚Äôt. They had the best conversation so far, he feels incredible and goes to his house. Second day, he finds some money in his pocket which he doesn‚Äôt remember having. He goes to college, spends that money in the canteen and that day they had a surprise test, where he had done exceptionally well, again another teacher praises him for his marks. Everything felt so good, and tomorrow was the day, he is now unsure whether he has to be a part of it or not.





**7\] The Decision :**

He got ready, went to that place and the leader stood right there, almost as if she had been waiting the whole time. The leader stepped forward and hugged him.¬†

*‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said softly, almost like a mother speaking to a child, ‚ÄúTell me, Ethan‚Ä¶ did the world sing to you?‚Äù*

¬†Ethan stood there, frozen. He thought of the past days: The praise, the test, the coffee, the laughter. Everything had been perfect‚Ä¶ maybe too perfect. Was this destiny, or was it a trap? Would he ever know the difference? The leader‚Äôs hand rested gently on his shoulder, waiting. The entire council stared at him in silence. Ethan took a deep breath. When he finally spoke, the hum stopped. Whether he stayed or walked away‚Ä¶ only the walls of that room knew.

But, it was almost exactly 10 years ago when I quit after having been in the organization for close to 12 years.  
I am one of those people who did the Art Excel then moved¬†up to do Yes and then Yes+, many Part II courses, DSN and VTP. I really believed¬†in Guru's magic and heck I was called a Guru's child.¬†  
I came across this thread accidentally and I read many posts here and then rekindled my memory when I had first read good ol' SKywalker's and Klim's blogs in 2014 and 2015.¬†  
I read almost all posts here and several articles and comments on the blogs and it rekindled the journey after my exit.¬†¬†

The series will be for fence sitters and not the ones deeply involved in the movement.  
Let me warn, the first thread will be kind but I will not promise that the expression cannot be visceral in the subsequent posts. So, cry a river elsewhere if you are a bhakt.  
Like we present on our CV, let me go chronologically backwards.

**Why did I leave? What was my trigger point? What led me to deep dive their activities?**  
2015 was the year of upheavals that led me to slip into depression.  
I lost someone very dear to me, some friendships ended, my career plans failed.  
I took part in Upanayanam by AOL with a Swami.¬†  
I come from a South Indian household and I had only seen men perform this.  
I remember sharing this with my grandmother and she was not at all pleased and warned me of its consequences.¬†I dismissed it off as her old schooled dogmas and took pride in how AOL is making things democratic.¬†However, I never really practiced it but wore the janeu. I did not drop my caste to invoke casteism but to give reference to context.

After my world seemed to be crushing down, I sought solace in meditation, SK, doing sandhyavandanam including sameetadaanam and chanting Lalita Sahasranamam.  
But, I often used to have a restless mind after the practice. Not only that, I used to have unpleasant and paranormal feelings.¬†¬†I have had moments of¬†foreseeing some events unfolding¬†during some part II courses too.¬†  
Every time I took a break due to my menstrual cycle, I felt better.¬†  
When I researched a little and sought advice from an actual Shastri, I understood that it is abnormal to experience like this and requires initiation and most often not open to anybody.¬†

It is also around the same time, I was privy to financial embezzlement within VVKI trust, the schools they run. Do not ask me for evidence. But, it was first hand information.¬†  
While we all have seen politics and dismissed it as 'common to any institution', I kept telling myself that Guru is separate from the institution.  
Furthermore, I knew of a case¬†where young girls had an unpleasant experience within the B'luru ashram (including Mr Nitin Limaye's escapades) and the complaints were brushed¬†off.¬†  
I came across the blogs by Skywalker and Klim and realised that my doubts were not misplaced.¬†  
I witnessed the sudden expansion of the ashram too corroborated with the doubts.¬†  
Around the same time we had WCF celebrations and with a lot of ruckus around, but, I was still a fence sitter. But, after that event, I was sure that I was out.¬†  
I began to see through the layers, that, Guru is the institute and nobody can be this naive.  
If a reader here is in the corporate world, we all know how people are hands in gloves when it comes to these activities and CEO and the chairman are almost never kept in the dark.¬†  
It was clear that Narasimhan and family were benefactors and the facilitator was Sri Sri.  
A person with black money will have assets in the family's name so that enquires are not raised.  
If someone tried busting AOL, this man can still walk scot-free because the assets are not in his name at all.  
I pushed myself to do a silence course too but I was restless because I could not wrap my head around how they maintain silence over misdoings.

But, the final nail in the coffin was their constant denial to call their practices Hindu.  
I knew that I cannot relate to an institution that  
\- calls itself to be associated with Adi Shankaracharya's (Shankara BhagavatpAdal's) lineage and teach practices to anyone and everyone without due diligence,  
\- dissociation with Sanatana Dharma and celebrating Christmas.  
The neo-Hindu attitude did not sit well with me.  
How could one feel ashamed of their roots and spread it at the same time?  
I initially ignored thinking that calling oneself Hindu organization will invoke criticism from the media that is largely anti-Hindu which is true but can a man not have the audacity to call oneself Hindu? Why was it? For foreign funding? To fleece innocent foreigners and non¬†Hindus?¬†

Thus, a lot of events had unfolded - financial irregularities, bad behaviour by teachers, and Sri Sri's silence over these matters.¬†

**Breakup aftermath journey**  
It was more hurtful than a breakup. I felt conned and cheated. No human had cheated me to this degree until then.  
I was in denial for a long time, and I spent many nights reading the blogs, trying to make sense.¬†I turned atheist and I did not want any ideal dictating terms.¬†  
I tried finding an alternative but fortunately did not Guru shop because I was done with Gurus of this kind.¬†

But after many months of heartache, I sought faith in God and Acharyas of the sampradaya that I was born into.¬†  
I understood and experienced that one does not have to do long one hour of complex practices to feel spiritual.  
Unfortunately, SK often becomes a process to 'feel high', the one that we feel in the first few times of SK and what use is spirituality if one holds Adho Mukha SvAsana in the morning but behaves like a m\*\*on rest of the day and loots people in the name of seva?  
Bawa claims that NAma japa has no effect without meditation.¬†  
Well, meditation can aid the japa process but¬† worshipping the wrong Guru with meditation can be more catastrophic.  
A simple nAma, lighting the lamp twice a day and even a meditation can be sufficient.  
Dharma has rituals that bring a sense of discipline and most importantly character should reflect the practices.¬†  
Let me reveal something here -  
there are many parts in our scriptures that will be racist and sexist when viewed with modern lenses. It may not be palatable to me to this day but democratizing and diluting practices is no different from how Trupti Desai of Sabarimala¬†fame behaved.¬†  
Therefore, I choose to respect it although I may not fully subscribe.¬†¬†

I started going to my native town almost every year and visited our Grama Devata and temples in my town, celebrated our festivals at home with my family.  
I used to listen to Peethadipathis of¬†our¬†Maths such as Sringeri,¬†Kanchi, Madhwa and even some upanyasakaars. They are doing yeoman service without the bling and the glamour.  
Some of these men and women live a¬†very humble life.¬†  
I returned to classical dance class and music. I was trained for many years as a kid and when I went back I met good teachers too.¬†¬†  
I still like things native - handloom, classical music and dance, temples, traditional food.¬†I began to expand my horizon and picked my childhood habit of reading vast genres of books and music.¬†I took therapy eventually because the parts of me that required fixing cannot be fixed with holding one's nose, breath or course registrations.¬†Weren't we often told in courses- *if you are feeling miserable, do seva!*  
If a tap breaks, you will fix the tap instead of checking the weather. Duh-huh!

**Do I regret my time there?**  
I do not regret my time completely because I derived pleasure and it met my emotional needs.  
I truly wanted to serve society.  
But, like Jordan Peterson says - take care of yourself like you'd take care of someone you love or your pet.¬†  
I hold myself accountable for being naive and gullible. I will never blame them or accuse them of using me.¬†It is like how one gets hypnotized - momentarily, you drop your guard.  
I am glad that I left the movement but I learned my lesson the hard way and I am not particularly happy about it.  
I met some wonderful amazing people in AOL who are my closest friends till day.  
I came across many people whose hearts are in the right place and want to truly serve.  
I came across many who do not have the courage to fix their homes so this is their safe space and meets their emotional needs. There are many other needs too that get met but that is not the intent of today's post.  
Luckily, I was always sure that I do not want to be a teacher because if I cannot fix the broken panes in my own backyard then I have no right to preach.  
And fortunately, I focused on my career as that was the need of the hour.

Honestly, I wish that I had taken therapy and adopted a Faustian spirit sans losing morals before joining any spiritual movement but therapy was not as common as it is today.  
*I often hear this from AOL teachers who are in deep mess that Guru has given us all the gyAn and it is the individual that is incapable of applying knowledge.*

**My message for the fence sitters and those who are heart broken** \-  
Hang in there, not inside AOL but where you are. Nobody wants to feel miserable but there will come a moment when you want to snap out of the depression and pain.¬†¬†  
Feel the pain, there can be no escape. It will change you, it changed me and we have to be open to change. You will not be the same person that walked into the basic course.The innocence is shredded into pieces and I realised that life is grey and for most part, we choose it.¬†¬†I could not rush through the¬†pain with SK because for the longest time I had been escaping from reality, working on myself with my head but instead chose to breathe rhythmically.¬†  
Should you need help like therapy, take it. Sadly, India does not have post cult specialists.¬†  
I cannot promise how alcohol can help, it may numb your pain but we do not want to be ostriches, do we?  
There are wonderful self help books, read a bunch, pause, reflect and with time you will learn to heal.  
Skepticism is key although¬†stoicism and cynicism seem most tempting.¬† ¬†I cannot promise you how fully and deeply you can forgive yourself or Sri Sri, because it depends on the magnanimity of the pain.  
My deepest prayers for such people to find their way.¬†  
A motto that keeps me going is - How badly do I want something? Where do I stand? What can I do to salvage the damage?¬†

But, I am almost certain of one thing after the gruesome painful process ends and the spiritually induced coma ends  
\- you change and see through hypocrisy¬†from a mile and most importantly with time you truly begin to trust your instincts. Something no human can ever teach.¬†Reminds me of Jim Carrey in the movie Truman Show where he slowly begins to smell the coffee .¬†¬†

More advanced and DSN sessions will follow including the infamous hot seat.¬†

Quarterly Report for the Period Ended July 31, 2025

Key Financial Metrics:
- Net sales increased 20% to $68.54 million for the nine months ended July 31, 2025, compared to $57.35 million for the same period last year. For the latest quarter, net sales were $23.91 million, up 27% from $18.81 million.
- Gross profit for the nine months was $13.28 million (19.4% of net sales), up from $11.11 million (19.4%). For the quarter, gross profit was $2.91 million (12.2%) versus $3.93 million (20.9%) a year ago.
- Net income for the nine months was $591,898 ($0.10 per share, basic and diluted), compared to $955,979 ($0.17 per share) in the prior year. For the quarter, a net loss of $1,205,413 ($-0.21 per share) was recorded versus net income of $626,796 ($0.11 per share).
- Operating cash flow was a negative $5.4 million for the nine months, compared to positive $5.2 million last year.
- Cash and cash equivalents as of July 31, 2025, were $979,772, down from $1,381,023 at October 31, 2024.
- Working capital was $20.98 million at July 31, 2025, down from $21.53 million at October 31, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:
- Company drew $7.75 million from its line of credit (now totaling $6.25 million outstanding) during the nine months ended July 31, 2025.
- Cash used for investing activities was $1.25 million, including an $800,000 acquisition of Empire Coffee Company.
- No cash dividends declared.
- Debt covenants are in place; line of credit due June 28, 2026.

Operations and Segments:
- Packaged coffee accounted for $39.8 million of sales (nine months) vs. $31.8 million last year. Green coffee sales were $28.7 million vs. $25.5 million.
- Empire Coffee Company contributed $3.24 million in revenue and $694,130 loss since its November 2024 acquisition.
- Commodities trading profits were $686,868 for the period, down from $1.22 million a year ago.

Key Risks and Uncertainties:
- Material weaknesses in internal controls remain, particularly around inventory, contract identification, system access, and journal entry preparation.
- Exposure to coffee commodity price volatility; hedging strategies only partly offset this.
- Losses at recently acquired Empire Coffee Company could impact future profitability.
- Reliant on the effective execution of remediation of internal controls and compliance with debt covenants.
- No significant legal proceedings reported.

Other Notable Items:
- Inventory increased to $21.7 million from $15.7 million in October 2024.
- Lease liabilities rose due to new and modified leases, with total liabilities now $2.74 million (from $1.17 million).
- No stock compensation expense during the period; 5,708,599 shares are outstanding.

Investor Takeaway:
Coffee Holding Co. delivered significant top-line growth, primarily driven by higher packaged coffee sales and the Empire acquisition. However, profitability has declined, notably recording a net loss for the latest quarter and reduced net income year-to-date, due to increased costs and operating expenses. Cash flow and liquidity are under pressure, and there are unresolved material weaknesses in financial controls. Investors should weigh the company‚Äôs ongoing growth initiatives and diversification efforts against challenges in operational efficiency, execution of integration, and financial oversight.

preparing documents for Romanian citizenship (yes, I‚Äôm that guy who actually reads forum guides down to the last comma), opening a futures trade on Binance (started with $5, grew to $100, now I‚Äôm trading with $10 like it‚Äôs my personal Warren Buffett mode), and going on a date with a girl from an app (yeah, from an app, not from the Romanian border üòÇ).

Sounds like three parallel realities, but that‚Äôs literally me.

Things with the girl started great: easy vibe, jokes, coffee, walks. She even said I look like two different people with and without a beard (and that‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs a feature). But here‚Äôs the catch ‚Äî I feel like I want to be exclusive with her, while she‚Äôs still keeping a ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù in her chats.

So here I am: in the daytime I‚Äôve got documents in my hands, in the evening I‚Äôm staring at the SOL/USDT chart, and at night I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äî **is there a way to put a stop-loss on relationships?**

Honestly, I don‚Äôt want to play this endless ‚ÄúTinder beta test.‚Äù I want stability. But pushing someone with an ultimatum like ‚Äúbe only with me or nothing‚Äù feels like something out of the last century.

So my questions for you, Reddit:  
in a world where everything can be optimized and automated, how do you know when a relationship moves from ‚Äúbeta‚Äù to ‚Äúfull release‚Äù?  
is it normal in 2025 to feel like you trust a trading chart more than someone‚Äôs words?  
and are you the type to be upfront and say ‚ÄúI want only you,‚Äù or do you let the process ripen on its own?

P.S. I‚Äôm in profit on my trades, but deep in the red when it comes to emotional peace. And honestly, that might be the weirdest chart I‚Äôve ever seen ü§Øüìâüìà",1,1757689475.0,u_p_sh_md10a,0,1.0,False

*Draconis System, Neutral Zone Bar*

Itrop sat in the back room with the four other commodores that remained. Each was in charge of three ships at the moment. Thirteen ships. Fully crewed, there would be a thousand souls at his disposal. The antics of those bent on revenge had been costly, and he was inwardly cursing the fools and the fools who followed them. Add in to that the recent news from Vilantia, where yet another Greatlord had somehow come up lesser than Gryzzk. It rankled deeply that it seemed as though the nobility of the homeworld was unable to control the commons. One specific commoner to be exact.

Still the news wasn't entirely bad. Fewer ships meant fewer commodores, and his outlay for the weekly meetings was accordingly lesser. In addition, he was able to hire out some of his crew for short-term work, and he himself had established that his knowledge of various trade facets was valuable enough to eke out an acceptable living, for the moment. Their campaigns of truth were slow but steady, and there were daily communications expressing a distaste for the current direction of their respective governments, and ships filled with individuals of a similar mind to his. In front of him was a tablet bearing one of those messages. He looked up at the messenger with a slight frown as he ate.

""So. Commodore Felavi. The anonymous benefactor expects us to go to Antares, a system on the cusp of violence and do what precisely?""

The Commodore in question mopped the edges of his plate with a thick piece of bread. ""Deliver items to those who need them, and get paid well for doing so.""

""They seem nonspecific as to the items, and the particulars of the delivery. Is our mysterious benefactor as cautious with the pay?""

There was a headshake in reply. ""No - the banker was made quite aware that silence and anonymity have their own price, paid upfront.""

""Not exactly acceptable. Are we to be delivering these items without knowing what they are?""

""We are.""

""Increase the upfront price by twenty percent if they don't provide handling instructions.""

There was a tilt of curiosity. ""To what end, Itrop?""

""Our client's anonymity is assured, but their cargo is another matter entirely. If they wish us to transport dark cargo with no safe handling guidance we will treat it with the greatest of care. There is a cost attached to such privilege.""

""They may contract with others in such case.""

""They may. But they risk dealing with others who are less cautious and more curious. If our benefactor wishes to provide transport guidance, the additional twenty percent can of course be waived."" Itrop finished his chicken and settled back a bit. ""Now then, do we have any additional ships coming to the fold?""

Another commodore spoke up. ""A full six of ships are weary of Freelord Uliod's ways. They are en route with their holds burdened and links back to tell their more cautious siblings of our food and work. In addition, there are three Warfreighters who are reconsidering their oaths to the Vilantian War Ministry.""

""Mmm. Make sure we receive them well. Ensure that our Terran engineering group can investigate and make recommendations.""

""To what end? One would think that a Vilantian would have a dark scent of Terrans.""

Itrop spread his hands casually. ""I'm here - obviously I'm not most Vilantians. Plus if the stories are to be believed, a fusion of Hurdop, Terran, and Vilantian technologies is a formidable thing.""

The soft laughter as Itrop referred to the battle holos that had cut and respliced and used in mercenary recruitment flexisheets as 'stories' was warming to Itrop's heart.

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk's eyes fluttered open as he recalled the night. It seemed that the Hurdop ales were easier on his head than Terran ones. The more likely explanation was that he simply hadn't drank as much as he listened to Reilly and her mother have something of a conversation - a great deal of it seemed to be the first steps of an epiphany of sorts for the elder Reilly as she spoke to each of them in turn and found that the younger Reilly wasn't as out of place on a mercenary ship as her mother suspected. The worst of it was that Delia had been constantly petting Gryzzk's arm as if were her own personal Rhipl'i.

Kiole was there next to him, mostly. At some point in the night she had taken possession of both blankets, looking for all the world like a Terran croissant. Gryzzk sat up and attended to most of his normal morning routine, watering the plants and enjoying the slow growth of green as all four planters showed signs of life. Then he leaned back in his chair and took in the sight of Kiole as she slowly divested herself of blankets and lifted her head, fur askew in a pattern only possible after hours of slumber and yawned, rolling her head left and right before pouting at Gryzzk as she emerged from the bathroom.

""You were supposed to wake me before showering."" Her slow stretch was enthralling, and Gryzzk let himself be enthralled by the movement.

""I have glorious news for you lady warrior - I am as of yet unshowered. And you, were not supposed to take both blankets.""

""Our child was cold."" Kiole walked over to nuzzle Gryzzk and left a trail of nightclothes on the way to the shower.

Once the particulars of cleanliness had been sorted, Gryzzk made his way back to engineering where more good news from Tucker awaited him.

""Major - repairs are done, just need you to slap your thumb on the inspection report and we can get this lovely little tub certified ready to move again.""

""Sounds good, Chief. You and the rest of the engineering section put everything on standby, lock the doors and report to the nearest bar on the station for a round of drinks, charge it to my account. XO, recall all personnel from shore leave, advise the station dockmaster. We leave in twelve hours.""

Rosie appeared from behind a corner. ""How'd you know I was here?!""

Gryzzk lifted a brow. ""Do I truly need to dignify that -""

""Huh?!"" Rosie's interruption was brusque.

""Do I truly need to dignify that with an answer?""

""Well...I suppose not.""

""Has the recall been sent?""

""It has, Freelord Major.""

""Good. You are to accompany the Chief and make sure the section gets back here safely.""

""Fer what?!""

""Because you are the only one who won't get drunk."" Gryzzk paused. ""You can certainly pretend to if needed.""

Rosie's scent perked up a bit more. ""Does that mean I get to bounce a holocred off his ass?""

Gryzzk closed his eyes and pinched his nose bridge. ""Use your best discretion, Rosie. Please refrain from further comment, particularly in regard to fanfiction writers. Dismissed.""

The engineering section all but carried Gryzzk out as they left to seal the doors to engineering, leaving him vaguely amused as Gro'zel and Delia went to the dayroom. It seemed a semblance of order was returning to the ship as the company began slowly returning to the ship in threes and sixes.

For his part, Gryzzk paid a quick visit to medical, which was blissfully empty.

The Cottles were laughing at some story or another as he poked his head in. Miss Doc Cottle was gesturing with a small glass of something. ""...so I asked him 'are you sure you don't want an anesthetic' and he said 'I put it there myself, I'd take it out myself if I could reach it'. So I tugged, got three centimeters out, and he made this sound - 'nyunnngrhun' and passed right the heck out."" She shook her head. ""Someday, people will realize that warning labels are not challenges.""

Gryzzk cleared his throat. ""I ah, wanted to make sure that the guests are well.""

Mister Doc Cottle nodded. ""Right as rain. Just another thing for the notebook about exotic cuisine. Apparently Hurdop's version of lemon fish produces flu-like symptoms. Not fun but a few saline IVs and some crackers later, they're resting comfortably in their quarters.""

""Excellent."" Gryzzk paused. ""I have been meaning to ask, but were you able to avail yourselves of some time on the surface?""

They both chuckled softly as Miss Doc spoke. ""I'm sure Hurdop is a fine place, but this is a fine enough weekend spot. We nipped out to the shops one time for a few ales and something to eat, but we're not fond of breaking our hips."" She patted Gryzzk's hand in a matronly fashion. ""But thank you for asking. We'll be taking some time once we hit Terra, there's a few places we've always wanted to go.""

""Do take a few stills for me."" Gryzzk smiled a bit. ""I have a feeling that I may be in demand, after a fashion.""

There was a small amused noise with Miss Doc shaking her head. ""You may want to ask Rosie for more, but it seems Miss Delia has been whipping through the social media.""

""Every time I ask Rosie for unnecessary information she likes to bring me a small amount of grief in the form of the latest fanfiction."" He paused. ""Have you seen any of them?""

Mister Doc snorted. ""For the most part they are biologically ridiculous, thematically juvenile, and serve as a vehicle for the author's personal fetishes. 'Twilight Rose and the Journey to Planet Isekawaii'? What mind writes that?""

Miss Doc flicked a bit of liquid from her tumbler at her ex-husband. ""The more important question is, 'Who reads that fifteen times and rates it five wangs up?', *Leonard*."" She smirked at his shocked expression before explaining to Gryzzk. ""His tablet passphrase has been 'CrusherT'ana' since we met.""

""I'll ah, leave you to it, then.""

Gryzzk shook his head as he went back to the dayroom, where Gro'zel was cheerfully explaining Skyrim to Delia. Or at least her favorite parts.

""...and there's a skeleton horse too - I don't like him very much because he's made of bones but I rescue him anyway because he's in a bad place and horses deserve to be in a pretty place."" She sniffed the air a bit and turned around, running to sit on his foot. ""Hi Major Papa!""

For her part, Delia was wearing dark glasses that complemented her slightly functional iridescent pencil-dress and appeared to be having a small amount of trouble breathing. Despite this, she actually seemed to be in a good mood. ""Ah, Major, I'd hoped to see you here. I had a request, well..."" she paused for a moment before she stumbled a bit. ""Well, I mean, ah, I thought it only fair that since I was able to spend last night with your squad that you and. And.""

Delia doubled over, emitting a series of petite sneezes before she stood up again. ""I apologize, I am rather allergic to cats. I have some medication, but against certain breeds it isn't as effective. As I was saying, I would like to have you and Chastity come to a small gathering in Paris when we arrive on Terra.""

""I suppose I would accept. What of my wife and daughter - would they be along as well?"" Gryzzk noted behind him a light scent of Reilly, and wondered what she thought of this.

The idea struck Delia oddly, as if she hadn't considered it. ""Well, I think...yes, that would be delight...delightf..."" Delia rapidly spun, sneezing again with such force that her hip caught Gryzzk in the stomach, knocking him off-balance and sending him into the grass of the dayroom.

The scene forced a raw laugh from the younger Reilly. ""Oh. My. Gawd. Frame it, frame it right freaking now, hang that in the goddamn Louvre."" She sank against the wall giggling furiously. ""Vilantian Minister of War? Couldn't take the Grizzly down. Hurdop Freelord? No chance in hell. Vilantian Greatlord? Pretty sure his wives do more damage. Mom's ass? The Major is flat on the mat!""

During this Gro'zel scrambled up to lay down with her head on Gryzzk's shoulder. ""I don't think she meant to do that."" She lowered her voice. ""But it was funny.""

Delia scrambled to regain herself, quickly smoothing her dress. ""I...oh, my. Apologies, Major. I'll help you up?""

Gryzzk shook his head. ""No, thank you. It is...I have walked a bit on Hurdop grass, but there is something unique about this blend that is pleasant.""

The younger Reilly quickly scrambled to lay down next to Gro'zel, planting a quick kiss on the child's cheek before regarding her mother. ""See Mom? It's not all...y'know. Business and galleries and whatnot. Sometimes it's just, touching grass.""

Delia paused, before gingerly sitting down next to her daughter. ""It. It doesn't feel right. The last time I sat on grass was...the day your father and I started the band."" Her voice took on a detached sort of tone, and her scent was warm with memory. ""We'd both grown up on Ursae Minor Platform. A scientist's dream and a child's nightmare. They had a day-care section for the children that also doubled as social science and early learning headquarters, and then in the middle of it was this...rigid park. A few tiny hills, and one oak tree. It was our favorite place to be, and we sat there until Quiet Hours when they chased us out.""

""Still, it was where we wrote the one song that people liked - I'd saved enough credits to print an electro-gurdy, and taught myself to play it. A few people liked us well enough, and then we were able to purchase passage on a ship doing cargo runs between worlds. We spent the whole time in R-space playing, and then we realized we'd picked the worst spot to land - New Florence. Not because it was against music, quite the contrary. There were too many musicians, all trying to please one patron or another, and most failing miserably. We picked up Richard and Eilowen when we met at a hostel and we all smuggled ourselves to Neo-London by listing ourselves as musical instruments for shipping.""

""For a year and a half, we lived on the barest necessities and spent all our credits on making ourselves appealing - we covered everything we could and then the Neofolk wave hit and suddenly there was Chardelia along with thirty other groups singing love songs with the electrogurdy, and we were the ones who rode the wave the furthest. We thought it never end - until it did.""

Reilly sat up and leaned into her mother for a moment as Delia paused, a slight tinge of fear in her voice. ""I still...Jenassa, what happens if there's no more mercenary work to be had?""

There was an amused exhalation in response. ""So first, bigass galaxy. As long as there's more than three people in it, someone is gonna want someone's ass kicked. Second, you remember the part where you had your kids genetically boosted? Go back and check the sheet, there's probably something about linguistic savant that you skipped over because it wasn't art. I speak seven languages - eight if you include the Fleet War Language. I'm working on Hurdop and Vilantian, but I may not be able to speak it - too many throat-rumbles and growls; also you didn't ask for super-smell, so I miss nuances.""

""So you'll...translate things?""

""Yeah - and even if that doesn't work out, I'll open up a rum bar on Vilantia. I've got a good retirement portfolio, Vilantians love rum, only way I'd make more money is just straight robbing the banks.""

""I don't suppose you have a name for this bar all thought out?""

""Been thinking about calling in Delia-inquents.""

Delia rose, rolling her eyes. ""Of course. In any event, Paris when we make Terran orbit. Please dress appropriately.""

After Delia left, Reilly stood. ""I think I need mac and cheese. Fair warning, Delia's going to try dressing all of us.""

Kiole snorted. ""I believe I can dress us all, and if the Terrans dislike my choices they may fling themselves from the nearest airlock.""

Reilly leaned down and gave them all a quick nuzzle. ""That's why you're Mom, Mom.""

The three settled in the grass for some time and luxuriated in what was likely the best-kept lawn in the entire fleet before Gryzzk finally sat up. ""The company should begin returning soon. With that, a return to duty. Speaking for myself we have about eleven hours before we are officially returned to duty, and I should like to spend them with my family.""

Kiole slowly sat up herself. ""Indeed. I am told that the one they call the Grizzly is a fierce authoritarian, and I should very much prefer to be at my station when we depart.""

The rest of the day was spent in the commander's quarters - the one message from 7th Command that Gryzzk tried to read was immediately replaced by the image of Rosie licking the tablet screen and telling Gryzzk that work could fuck right the fuck off as the engineering squad was singing a song comparing rain or a rippling brook was a mug of beer inside a Took.

Gryzzk couldn't recall anyone from Clan Took. Or if there even was a Clan Took. Still, he could take a delicate hint in the form of his XO telling him to relax a bit, so he followed it; settling on the bed with Kiole and Gro'zel as she showed off her collection of video game horses until she finally tired for a nap.

The rest of the day was a bliss of calm scent and lounging; it seemed that Terra would bring excitement and anxiety on several levels during their scheduled three-day layover for Delia, so this brief period of calm was to be savored - even if the savoring had to be enforced at times. There was even enough time for a full night's sleep, which was fully taken advantage of.

With the company finally aboard and accounted for the next morning, Gryzzk nodded as he took his place in the command chair, nodding to the morning squad as he confirmed station readiness.

""Corporal Yomios, confirm dock clearance and orbital lane. Captain Hoban, once we clear orbit best speed to the Terran jump-point. XO, we have a message a from command that needs to be read.""

Rosie's form was crisp and clean - it seemed that her day with the engineering team had done her good. ""Colonel says we should be expanding. We got solid profit margins, and looking at the other legions their financials are almost as good - so this little experiment's panning out. We got more jobs than ships, so the obvious answer is that we need more ships. Colonel says we're authorized to expand by four total and Captain Rostin's already shaking the bushes for a couple late-model Warfreighter class vessels that weren't cratered in the War.""

Gryzzk considered during the brief pulse of inertia that marked Hoban pushing the engines from orbital exit to best speed. ""Check the salvage lists for Hurdop. As I recall their number went up recently; perhaps a few of those can be purchased for the cost of towing.""

There was an amused sound. ""Couple of 'em looked sound enough. I'll inquire.""

After that was calm routine, broken by minor course corrections and the occasional coffee break. Finally they neared their jump point, and Edwards broke the calm.

""Major, new contact, ident coming in - "" there was a pause. "" - squawk says it's the *Unification's Fist*, Hurdop registry.""

""Corporal Yomios, hail them and send the standard cautions - Sergeant Major, weapons to standby, shields to seventy-five percent.""

""Hail sent, no response yet."" Yomios was calm, though she activated her crash harness.

""Shields up, weapons on standby."" O'Brien began a fast diagnostic and started a quick tracking sequence.

Gryzzk stood up from his chair, placing his tea in a holder as he straightened his uniform tunic.

""Response coming in now.""

The holo resolved to a rather severe-looking Hurdop woman. ""This is Captain Waniul of the *Unification's Fist*. We are here to liberate Freelady Kiole and the Hurdop of the *Twilight Rose* from unjust bondage.""",20,1757689250.0,HFY,7,1.0,False

*""It starts with a hum, but ends with a choice""*



**1\] The Encounter :**

A normal day, Ethan goes to college by metro. He boards the usual 7:45 AM train, and the compartment is empty, there are 3 people on that side of the compartment. There was a lady seated opposite to him, she starts humming. Ethan thinks that she was wearing AirPods, but she wasn‚Äôt. He felt kinda weird and avoided it, she stopped humming. Later, again she started humming, but this time it was loud‚Ä¶ like loud, and then she stops it, he just looks at her, and to his horror that lady was staring right into his soul. He looked away, and later once again looked at her, and this time she was staring at him, now this scared him. He doesn‚Äôt know what to do, and by that time she took her phone out, Ethan knows that it wasn‚Äôt a good sign and he gets off of the train. Now, he started thinking about how the lady appeared, because he was traumatised. She was wearing a purple top, with black pants, pink handbag, a green phone, hair carelessly done, and she looked like she was in her forties. Ethan just tries to forget about it, and tells his experience to his friends and they laugh it off. He never knew what awaited him next.





**2\] The Mark :**

Eventually Ethan forgot about this lady and carried on with his college stuff, but all changes when he starts receiving weird texts from unknown numbers. He just avoids them because he doesn‚Äôt wanna take the risk of losing his data. He initially thought that they were some scammers trying to steal his data, he was so traumatised by that lady that if he hears someone hum he would go into ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mode. Eventually, the text messages were no longer messages but just ‚Äúna‚Ä¶na..na..‚Äù Ethan is disturbed now. He gets weird dreams in the night. He realised that he has fallen into some sort of trap.





**3\] The Pursuit :**

He was no longer imagining it. There were people watching him, not overtly but subtly. This disturbs him completely, random men smiling at him like they were familiar with him, women looking at him and whispering at each other. Then comes one night, Ethan left his college little late, and it‚Äôs twilight now, he was walking his way back and he hears someone humming, the same way the lady was humming, his heart started pounding faster, he looks back and sees no one. He reaches his house and his doorbell goes off. He comes out to find an envelope that had a black note written in silver ink which said

*‚ÄúJoin us or disappear‚Äù*

He doesn‚Äôt tell his parents, instead takes it to his room and keeps it on his table.





**4\] The Resonant Thread :**

He started searching, he found out that this envelope was sent by an organisation called ‚ÄúThe Order Of The Six Tones‚Äù it was basically an underground cult founded decades ago, no known location. He eventually learned that they recruit people based on how they react to the Leader‚Äôs hum, i.e., they recruit through resonance. They usually target the ‚Äúgifted‚Äù, musicians, empaths, dreamers or just people who are fractured enough to hear something others can‚Äôt. The Humming wasn‚Äôt music, it was Manipulation. He knew that he wasn‚Äôt chosen, he was claimed. There were 10 council members in the cult, and 50 members, but not all 60 showed up, only 7 were active in the cult‚Äôs activities. The cult‚Äôs main day was on September 13 of every year, where all the members and new people who were recruited by others would gather, Ethan was expected to attend that Grand Feast, which was just 2 days later.





**5\] The Gathering :**

Ethan decides to show up, he told his parents that he has special classes till 5 PM and goes to the meeting, he reached the building where the feast is supposed to happen, and he goes inside. The volunteer looks at him and nods, like he was expecting Ethan‚Äôs arrival. He goes to the hall, and finds the Council members seated in a semi circle, when he entered all the attention was towards him. The leader stood up and welcomed him. All of them wearing a purple shirt with a black overcoat, they eventually said that purple signifies royalty and rarity, hence purple is their cult‚Äôs uniform. Without further delay, the leader makes Ethan sit right next to her, and they begin their rituals. It was a dark setting, with candle lights, faint blue light, with strong humming. Ethan standing cluelessly, looks at the rest of the people. The ritual only lasted for an hour, and the leader asked everyone to be seated. They were given a grand meal, only time Ethan was thankful for what had happened that day, because the food was too good and he never had eaten food like that before. After the meal the leader goes up to him¬†

*‚ÄúTake two days,‚Äù she said, her tone neither threatening nor pleading. ‚ÄúListen to the world. If it sings to you‚Ä¶ come back. If it doesn‚Äôt, walk away.‚Äù*





**6\] When the World Sings :**

The first day, he wakes up in the morning feeling better than ever. He goes to his college, a teacher who never knew about Ethan started praising about how attentive he was during the class. His friends are being nicer to him, on his way back home, he meets his friend after a long time, and she offers to go out and have a coffee with him. He thought of telling this to her, but he just didn‚Äôt. They had the best conversation so far, he feels incredible and goes to his house. Second day, he finds some money in his pocket which he doesn‚Äôt remember having. He goes to college, spends that money in the canteen and that day they had a surprise test, where he had done exceptionally well, again another teacher praises him for his marks. Everything felt so good, and tomorrow was the day, he is now unsure whether he has to be a part of it or not.





**7\] The Decision :**

He got ready, went to that place and the leader stood right there, almost as if she had been waiting the whole time. The leader stepped forward and hugged him.¬†

*‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said softly, almost like a mother speaking to a child, ‚ÄúTell me, Ethan‚Ä¶ did the world sing to you?‚Äù*

¬†Ethan stood there, frozen. He thought of the past days: The praise, the test, the coffee, the laughter. Everything had been perfect‚Ä¶ maybe too perfect. Was this destiny, or was it a trap? Would he ever know the difference? The leader‚Äôs hand rested gently on his shoulder, waiting. The entire council stared at him in silence. Ethan took a deep breath. When he finally spoke, the hum stopped. Whether he stayed or walked away‚Ä¶ only the walls of that room knew.

1nf5j5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1nf5j5r/the_name_of_the_game_is_convenience_for_me_any/,The name of the game is convenience for me. Any tips?,"Hi all,

I am in a healthy nutrition and weight loss journey and I've already managed to lose 22 lbs from 302 lbs earlier this year. Currently optimized things more so that I am consistently losing 2-2.5 lbs per week on a 1800-1900 kcal/day low-sugar diet. I do strength training twice a week and not much more exercise than that at the moment.

The name of the game for me is *convenience*. My job and family obligations do not allow me to spend much time on preparing food, nor do I want to spend such time as I recognize it is not indefinitely sustainable.

My current setup for breakfast and lunch is standardized as follows:

Breakfast:

Standard: 2 servings (340 g) of the Aldi 0 fat 0 added sugar greek yogurt with 15 g protein each at 100 kcal each, plus 15 g of salted mixed nuts at about 80 kcal. Sometimes add fruit (apple, berries) but not often. Sometimes replace one greek yogurt with a 160 kcal protein shake, but not often. Coffee with splash of skim milk, minimal calories.

On Saturdays I have instead 2 fried eggs (no oil) and half an avocado.

Lunch:

Standard: 190 g of skinless chicken breast or 2 chicken thighs, plus a rotation of 4 servings of vegetables (broccoli, peas, green beans, mixed, etc.). The vegetables are exactly coming from a full bag of Aldi frozen cooked vegetables. Sometimes add 30 g of salted mixed nuts, but not every day and certainly not on pea days. This lunch at noon is extremely satiating and I do not get hungry at all until dinner time at 7pm or later. I do naturally have plenty of water throughout my work day too, and also an extra cup of coffee most days. This lunch averages around 600-700 kcal. 

Sometimes (once a week or so) I instead have a low sugar protein bar and 30 g of mixed nuts. This lunch is not as satiating for so long as my standard though.

Dinner: on 3 of our busiest weekdays we use a healthy meal delivery service at home (Factor to be exact) to alleviate  our household cooking burden. We have done this now only for a couple weeks but it is very successful. My meals are chosen to be high protein, low sugar, and they never go above 700 kcal. When calories are too low I complement with a fruit and/or a protein shake.

On the rest of the days we turn to a rotation of home cooked meals, such as:
- baked chicken thighs with brown rice and vegetables
- baked salmon with brown rice and vegetables
- chicken taco bowl
- lentil soup with chicken
- spaghetti (whole wheat) with chicken and tomato sauce
- good old sandwiches (whole wheat bread, ham, muenster cheese).

I have been having 1 indulgent meal a week (at most), mostly due to social/family reasons.

Currently with this setup I feel full all day long pretty much, while remaining at 1800-1900 kcal/day on average (this average includes the indulgent meal). 

I would appreciate any tips/constructive criticism/analysis on my nutritional setup, which I believe I can sustain indefinitely. I also hope my setup can help some people looking for convenience and healthy nutrition. If anybody has other convenient healthy tips, please let me know! My only non-negotiable constraint is low sugar overall, but I do not necessarily shy away from higher caloric foods if they have great nutritional benefits.",1,1757689210.0,loseit,0,0.67,False

I‚Äôve been using the Siemens EQ500 for several years now and feel it is time to move to a better semi pro/pro machine

Would appreciate some recommendations based on these demands:

1. No machine with separate grinder.
2. Would like to start having a machine with some Portafilter. that will include the whole show of grinding tamping brewing hence improving and better on trolling my espresso quality.
3. Fill a bit reluctant about the High end machines such as Rocket, La Marzzuco, etc. as I heard the learning curve is a bit ruff.
4. My Better half wont be messing with manually steaming milk tough, so I kind of narrowed the search down to the ‚ÄúLa specialist maestro‚Äù. question is, if it‚Äôs not a fancy gadget that will deliver poor or even similar results like my current siemens machine.

If you have any other machine that meets my requests I would be happy to hear your thoughts.

I've been to plenty of fashion week events (mostly the overwhelming, pretentious kind lol) and tons of Brooklyn comedy shows, but never anything that combines both. The whole concept sounds pretty cool - like fashion week but actually accessible and fun?

Has anyone been to events like this before? Is it worth checking out or is it gonna be one of those things that sounds better in theory? I'm always down for supporting Brooklyn venues and smaller events during fashion week since everything else is usually far.

The intimate coffee shop setting actually sounds kind of perfect for comedy, and I'm curious how they're gonna blend the fashion crowd with the usual Brooklyn comedy scene crowd. Could be really cool or could be really weird lol.

Anyway, figured I'd ask here since this sub usually has good intel on the more unique NYC events. Anyone else planning to go or have thoughts? (lol maybe its my show, who knows)

-Men value what they put effort into.

-Most women, myself included, are a better person and better lover when a man is doing right by them.  
The lower stress of him getting things done also makes us glow. 
Relationships where the man doesn't pull weight often have a dead bedroom. 

-Getting dressed up takes at least an hour (hair, shower, makeup) do not spend an hour and not get treated well. 

-He's going to be spending effort and money and way more time (meeting someone is not easy) if he wants to leave you for wanting to be treated right, he will have to do the same elsewhere too. 
Either way he's going to be putting effort in you or another woman. 
If he wants to say western women are bad and become a ""passport bro"", he will be spending even more money on this process ü§£.

-If he doesn't plan something **don't** waste your energy explaining to him. 
Step away from the phone and use that energy you were going to use as a response on something for you, even if it is a small walk outside, spend it on you, not raising him. 

Maybe you view it as helping the next woman out, but it doesn't because he will view you as crazy and not change his ways.

he‚Äôs nerdy and cringe to say so the least but we both had fun and i found out a lot about his childhood and his ex gf. which only reason why i brought her up is because she‚Äôs in our class. they haven‚Äôt dated in over a year but live with each other out of convenience (both of their parents are kinda abusive and they didn‚Äôt want to move back in with the parents/find other roommates) i think it‚Äôs important to mention that she has a lot of health issues so going to the er is a regular occurrence and he usually takes her. i don‚Äôt have an issue with him living with her because he doesn‚Äôt like her, the issue is she‚Äôll still hold his hand because of her ‚Äòanxiety‚Äô or ask him to kiss her to comfort her but will also invite men over to their apartment but doesn‚Äôt allow him the same. anyways i can‚Äôt tell him to move out, he‚Äôs planning on staying there till he graduates but i also can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôll be an issue or not. he‚Äôs gotten better at telling her no but you can kinda tell while talking to him that he doesn‚Äôt have the best self esteem, his mom tried choking him when he was younger and he ran away from home, i‚Äôm not going to pick at his behaviors. there‚Äôs a lot of people who got into his head and from what i understood he‚Äôs worked on himself a lot. 

i live at home with my parents who are strict but if i could i‚Äôd have him live with me. i told him yesterday that kissing or holding her hand is unacceptable if he‚Äôs in a relationship and he told me he won‚Äôt happen again. anyways any advice or so i just deal with it. also how do i ask someone i want them to get checked for std, he doesn‚Äôt have many bodies but his ex gf did and i don‚Äôt want to have sex with him until i know he‚Äôs all good. i‚Äôm willing to get tested as well as i haven‚Äôt gotten tested in months but i don‚Äôt want to come off as rude, i just know a lot of symptoms are asymptomatic and maybe she gave him something. that‚Äôs just something i don‚Äôt want to risk",1,1757688814.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

I planned to manage this by keeping my vyvanse by my bed to take when I wake up. Somehow, even taking days off, I will be falling a few days short. I live alone, so the only answer is me, I can only assume I‚Äôm half waking and taking my meds and then waking properly later and taking them again. 

An overcorrection if there ever was one, taking the meds out of my room is the obvious first step, but I get carried away whenever I keep them elsewhere. What do I do? What do you do?

He got really angry at this and told me how ungrateful I was and how I disrespected him and that I act like I‚Äôve come from some privileged background to be speaking to him like that.

This compact electric kettle was a game-changer during my last trip, proving itself as an indispensable companion for a quick cup of tea or a bowl of instant noodles in a hotel room. With its sleek design and small footprint, the kettle neatly fit into my suitcase without devouring precious space. Since I like to travel light, finding a gadget both functional and easily portable is a win.

**Design That Works for Travel and Small Spaces**

One feature that stands out is the dual voltage compatibility. Switching between 120VAC and 220-240VAC is super simple with a little button on the bottom of the unit, making it straightforward and versatile for international use. The retractable handle is a neat touch‚ÄîI genuinely appreciated how it folded away neatly, saving space in my already cramped backpack. The capacity of 0.6 liters (about 20 ounces) makes it ideal for solo travelers or quick uses, and the cool-touch exterior ensures I don‚Äôt accidentally scald myself while pouring. The hinged-locking lid, meanwhile, eliminates any risk of accidental spills during the hustle of travel.

[Check Elite Gourmet EKT719 price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0cr6tmxcx/)

**Quick Performance and Functionality**

I must admit, its ability to boil water in roughly three minutes left me pleasantly surprised. Waiting for water to heat up while bouncing between flights or managing a hectic morning can be frustrating. This electric kettle gets rid of that disappointment. The one-touch boiling button is foolproof‚Äîpress and wait. And with an LED indicator light, I didn‚Äôt even need to hover over it while it worked. The boil-dry protection and automatic shut-off provide some peace of mind, particularly when I‚Äôm rushing out the door. Even when I‚Äôve absentmindedly forgotten about it (coffee deprivation, anyone?), this kettle‚Äôs safety features had my back.

**Benefits**

- Dual voltage functionality for international or domestic travel  
- Compact dimensions with fold-away handle for easy storage  
- LED indicator light and one-touch boiling design for convenience  
- Boil-dry protection and auto-shut-off for safety  
- Stainless-steel interior enhances durability and ensures pure-tasting water  

**Areas of Concern**

- Smaller capacity may not suffice for families or multiple users  
- The power cord is non-retractable, which can cause minor tangling issues  
- Changing the voltage requires remembering to flip the switch; could be overlooked  

**Boons of Build and Features**

The double-wall cool-touch feature left quite an impression. It not only retained the water temperature longer but also ensured the exterior remained comfortable to touch, reducing the risk of accidents. For those living in shared apartments or dorm scenarios, this design adds an extra layer of safety. Additionally, the stainless-steel interior convinced me that I wasn‚Äôt going to taste any odd plastic residue in my morning cuppa‚Äîa common headache with older kettles I‚Äôve owned. Cleaning was also surprisingly hassle-free thanks to the wide spout and simple hinged lid.

**Product Competitors**

This kettle faces stiff competition from products like the Bodum Bistro Electric Water Kettle and the Russell Hobbs Travel Kettle. While both alternatives offer slightly larger capacities, they lack the retractable handle and dual voltage compatibility, which I found essential for a travel-focused design. Likewise, they don't emphasize a cool-touch, double-wall exterior, something I think Elite Gourmet nailed for frequent travelers. The Bodum, though modern-looking, doesn‚Äôt fold up as compactly, whereas the Russell Hobbs seems dated in comparison to the matte design of this model. Performance-wise, I‚Äôd put Elite Gourmet on par or even ahead given its ease of operation and safety features.

**True Value**

In terms of cost-effectiveness, this kettle punches above its weight. Its sleek design, functional portability, and reliable performance justify its price. Sure, it‚Äôs not a family-sized appliance, but it shines in niches like dorm living, RVs, and hotel stays. For what it‚Äôs designed to do‚Äîboil water quickly and efficiently‚Äîit delivers outstanding bang for the buck. Spending on this kettle felt like a smart purchase, particularly considering it draws no unnecessary power thanks to auto shut-off.

I‚Äôve just fermented and distilled my first 50 litre molasses wash (14kg) with 3kg of raw sugar added. Bakers yeast, DAP and a teaspoonish of Epsom Salts and a bit of lemon juice. I was able to keep it at 30+ degrees through out. Finished in 3-4 days and I gave it 3 days to settle. 

I have a 65 litre Brewzilla boiler with a 4‚Äù x 4 SS bubble plate column still. I did use (today) an extra 20cm 4‚Äù column with copper scrubbies. I‚Äôm adding this info as I know some members use this to assess and advise. I wasn‚Äôt trying to make a neutral spirit. Just use what I had. 

My first four goes into the sport were sugar washes which I‚Äôve been lucky with and learned along the way.  I looked at today‚Äôs step into a rum distillation as a next step. 

I brought the still up to temp relatively quickly but then backed off the heat. First drips came off at 77 degrees (top of the still) which seemed normal (5th go at it) but I‚Äôm still getting the hang of it. 

I discarded the first 400ml and then started checking/expecting heads. What I got was about 900ml of 90% ABV beautifully sweet spirit. No heads taste of smell. (I guess this is my question). It‚Äôs not what I was expecting. 

Around this time I reduced the heat in the boiler to 2400w and the head temp and off take off speed equalised. Subsequent reduction to 1800w. Again it all equalised. I then got about 2.75 litres of 90-87% ABV spirit. More complex molasses flavour followed but still very approachable. 

About this time I headed off to make a coffee and came back to tails.  98+ degrees boiler and 82* at the top of the column. (Tails)
Yes I dropped the F banger. 

I know this is a bit long winded and i could have just said ‚ÄúHas anyone got super sweet heads at the start of a molasses run and what does that mean‚Äù but I know you guys need and ask for more. 

I‚Äôm happy if this is normal. Blended the (heads) early off take with what I believe is hearts.  It was getting late so I shut the still down. I‚Äôll finish off stripping the rest in the morning for faints.

So is this a happy accident. Is it the 4 plate one and done run (I chose not to do a stripping run) or did I just get lucky. Happy to hear your thoughts. Cheers

Chapter Five: Ember Quiet

PvZ Horror AU ‚Äì CW: Mild Aftermath, Light Humor

The pounding outside grew frantic‚Äîwood splintering, claws scraping against metal.
Our Tall-nut barricade quivered under the weight of the horde.

‚ÄúTime,‚Äù Dave croaked, voice dry as gravel.

I dropped to one knee and cracked open the last crate. Nestled in rich soil, two Cherry Bombs pulsed with a warm red glow, their stems twitching like excited fireworks waiting for a spark.

‚ÄúAlright, cherries,‚Äù I said, brushing dirt from their smooth skins. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make it loud.‚Äù

The cherries bobbed and hummed‚Äîa sound like a tea kettle about to sing.
Dave squinted at them and muttered, ‚ÄúThey look extra spicy tonight.‚Äù

I grinned. ‚ÄúPerfect.‚Äù

Outside, shadows clawed the factory walls. Coneheads scraped helmets along the siding like nails on a chalkboard. Imps clattered over broken glass, their tiny jaws snapping. A Buckethead‚Äôs steel drum screeched across the concrete as it rammed the door again and again.

The Cherry Bombs shivered, impatient.

‚ÄúThree,‚Äù I whispered.
Dave joined in: ‚ÄúTwo‚Ä¶‚Äù
The cherries chimed, perfectly on cue.

‚ÄúOne.‚Äù

I lobbed them through a jagged window.

The night erupted.
Twin blossoms of crimson light bloomed across the yard, shockwaves rippling the factory floor.
Flames rolled outward in a roaring circle. For an instant the fog itself ignited, turning the world into a fiery sunrise.

Every moan, every hiss, every clawing scratch cut off at once.

Silence.

Ash drifted past the window like black snow. A Conehead helmet spun across the ground, smoking.
The Tall-nut barricade stood blackened but solid.


---

The Long Exhale

I sagged against the wall, lungs burning.
Dave wheezed, then let out a crooked grin.
‚ÄúSpicy,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúExtra crispy,‚Äù I replied.

We laughed‚Äîan odd, cracking sound in the stillness‚Äîuntil the last echo of fire faded into the night.


---

A Factory Becomes a Camp

Inside the factory, the emergency lights buzzed overhead, casting the machinery in sleepy red hues. The plants we‚Äôd saved rustled in their pots, trembling from the blast but alive.

Sunflowers tilted toward the faint glow, their faces soft with quiet radiance. A Peashooter yawned‚Äîactually yawned‚Äîsnapping its pod shut with a squeaky pop.

‚ÄúGood work, everyone,‚Äù I said, kneeling beside them.

The Sunflowers answered with a warm pulse of light that brushed against my skin like a hug.
The Snow Pea gave a frosty trill, little ice crystals drifting from its leaves.
The stoic Tall-nut rumbled low, a sound like distant thunder, then gave what could only be described as a slow nod.

Dave whistled. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre talkin‚Äô, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúFeels like it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNot words‚Äîmore like‚Ä¶ feelings.‚Äù

The Tall-nut rumbled again, a clear yes in my mind.


---

Snack Time (Sort Of)

While Dave tended his bandaged arm, I rummaged through an old vending machine near the conveyor belts. The glass was cracked, but inside were bags of long-expired chips and a single dusty bottle of soda.

Dave grabbed the soda and squinted at the label. ‚ÄúPre-zombie fizz. Vintage.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou really gonna drink that?‚Äù

He popped the cap with a grin. The hiss of carbonation startled a nearby Peashooter, which aimed reflexively until Dave raised a finger. ‚ÄúPeace, little buddy. Just a sip.‚Äù

He took one gulp and immediately winced. ‚ÄúFlat. Tastes like angry raisins.‚Äù

The Peashooter let out a squeaky laugh‚Äîno other word for it.


---

Quiet Conversations

We set up a rough camp between silent machines: crates for seats, a lantern propped on a busted conveyor belt. I counted our seed packets aloud‚ÄîPeashooter, Snow Pea, Repeater, Jalape√±o, Tall-nut‚Äîwhile the plants leaned closer, leaves rustling like curious ears.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Dave said, leaning back, ‚Äúgot a plan? Or are we just gonna start a salad bar?‚Äù

‚ÄúFirst we rest,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúThen we figure out if this place has supplies. Maybe seed stock.‚Äù

A Sunflower brightened in approval. A Repeater bobbed its twin heads and fired a playful pea that pinged harmlessly off the Tall-nut‚Äôs shell.

The Tall-nut didn‚Äôt flinch‚Äîthen very slowly pivoted until its blank face stared right back at the Repeater.
Even plants can glare.

Dave chuckled. ‚ÄúTall-nut‚Äôs the strong, silent type. Respect.‚Äù


---

Night Thoughts

The factory settled into a steady rhythm: distant drips of condensation, the soft hum of emergency lights, the gentle breathing of living plants.

For the first time in days, I felt the tension in my shoulders fade. We were safe‚Äîfor now.

I lay back against a crate, the Almanac resting on my chest. The blank Yeti page stayed stubbornly empty, but the plants‚Äô soft rustling carried a wordless promise: Together.

Dave leaned against the Tall-nut like a pillow and muttered, half-asleep, ‚ÄúTomorrow we find coffee. World‚Äôs still gotta have coffee.‚Äù

A Sunflower pulsed a warm glow over him like a night-light.

I smiled and let my eyes close.

Outside, the night held its breath.
Inside, we finally did the same.

First, the music/sound mixing was SO incredibly loud. For a show targeting an older audience, I cannot fathom why you would make the sound so loud. We could barely hear the singing at the peaks of most songs because the music was so loud. I have seen dozens of shows at this same theater and have never experienced anything like it. I said something to house staff at intermission, they said multiple people had said something and/or left and they would say something to the sound guy but it was ultimately up to the show production. Insanely unpleasant experience. On top of that, the lights were way too bright, and just on for no reason. I go to a ton of concerts, including two this week and the most recent large megastar show was Lady Gaga - this blaring lights and blasting music did not make me think of a concert experience at all. BLASTING lights directly into your audiences eyes for whole songs is so dumb. Everyone around me was reacting to the lights every time they came on and no one was enjoying it. Was it like this in every city? 

On top of that, what a horrible show. I know this was basically just designed to be a Neil Diamond tribute concert and the whole point was to make money, but what a joke of a show. Neil Diamond is just...not a good person who apparently has not actually been able to do any introspection on his life despite years of therapy. An over-complimentary telling of a man who is apparently just an ass. You cheated on your first wife when you were starting off performing in coffee shops leading the breakdown of your marriage. Second marriage falls apart because you are a global superstar constantly on the road - common denominator here is you. And this is the sugar coated telling of his life, there was nothing compelling, no real struggle or learning or insights - so no real plot to this show, nothing interesting to follow. No real explanation of how his childhood imaginary friend, being a child of immigrant or Jewish really impacted anything?  

  
So much of the show was over performed, not great acting, bizarre choreography. Fradiani sang about half the songs well, the other half were a miss. Seems like he is over playing Neil. 



I have read the comments about how if you are a Neil Diamond fan you will love it, otherwise skip it - THEN JUST PRODUCE A TRIBUTE CONCERT. Never should be been made into a musical.",2,1757688343.0,Broadway,4,0.63,False

And also it would remineralize your enamel (through flouride I assume) before eating breakfast.

And for years I subscribed to this routine out of convenience.  Wake up, clean up which includes brushing, and head out the door for work - no time for breakfast until the office.

After the pandemic and transition to work from home, I found myself wanting to eat breakst and have my coffee immediately after waking and signing on to work.  It seemed to make more sense to ""dirty up"" my teeth with food and coffee stains first, and then brush this all off after.

Now that I've done a web search, I see supporting arguments for both brushing before and after breakfast - so which one is it?

1nf52o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/random_for_CETECH/comments/1nf52o1/the_strategic_imperative_cultivating_a/,The Strategic Imperative: Cultivating a Professional Network on LinkedIn,"In the contemporary professional landscape, the adage ""it's not what you know, but who you know"" holds more truth than ever, albeit with a modern twist: it's about who you know¬†and¬†how you strategically connect with them. LinkedIn stands as the preeminent platform for this vital endeavor, offering unparalleled opportunities to forge meaningful professional relationships. However, merely possessing a LinkedIn profile is akin to owning a powerful tool without knowing how to wield it. True success lies in the deliberate and thoughtful cultivation of a robust professional network.

The foundation of any successful LinkedIn networking strategy is an impeccably optimized profile. This digital representation serves as one's professional resume, portfolio, and personal brand statement. A compelling, high-resolution headshot immediately conveys professionalism, while a descriptive headline, extending beyond a mere job title, succinctly articulates one's unique value proposition. The ""About"" section becomes a dynamic elevator pitch, weaving a narrative of experience, skills, and aspirations, meticulously infused with industry-relevant keywords to enhance discoverability. Each entry in the ""Experience"" section should detail responsibilities with impactful action verbs and, wherever possible, quantify achievements, transforming mundane tasks into demonstrable successes. Endorsements and, critically, recommendations from former colleagues and managers, lend significant credibility, acting as powerful testimonials to one's capabilities and work ethic. Finally, integrating rich media‚Äîlinks to portfolios, projects, or presentations‚Äîallows for a vivid showcase of one's professional output.

With a polished profile in place, the next crucial step involves a targeted approach to connection. Blindly accumulating connections dilutes the value of a network; instead, focus should be placed on individuals who align with specific career goals, be they job seeking, mentorship, industry insights, or collaborative opportunities. Researching target companies, identifying key personnel, and understanding industry trends can guide this selection process. When initiating contact, personalization is paramount. A generic connection request is often dismissed; a tailored message, referencing a shared interest, a recent article, or a mutual connection, transforms a cold outreach into a warm introduction. Connecting initially with known contacts‚Äîcolleagues, alumni, friends‚Äîprovides a strong foundational layer for the network.

Beyond initial connections, genuine engagement is the lifeblood of a thriving LinkedIn network. It‚Äôs not enough to simply collect contacts; one must actively contribute and interact. Sharing insightful articles, offering unique perspectives on industry trends, and engaging thoughtfully with the posts of others positions an individual as a thought leader and a valuable contributor. Congratulating connections on their achievements, offering assistance when appropriate, and asking pertinent questions all serve to strengthen bonds. These digital interactions, when nurtured, can transition into more substantive offline engagements, whether through a virtual coffee chat or an in-person meeting. The ultimate goal is to cultivate a network that is not merely extensive, but deeply interconnected and mutually supportive, a dynamic ecosystem that propels professional growth and opens doors to unforeseen opportunities.",1,1757688109.0,random_for_CETECH,0,1.0,False

Hey friends! üëã So, let's get real for a second. How many times have you dropped some serious cash on tools that promised to make your life easier but ended up feeling like they turned your brain into scrambled eggs instead? üôÉ If you're nodding your head, you're definitely not alone. 

As creators, we often find ourselves running in circles trying to keep up with the latest shiny tools, and it's easy to feel overwhelmed. But here's the good news: With a few savvy choices, you can actually work **smarter, not harder**! 

**Here‚Äôs the lowdown on the AI tools that are totally worth your investment:**

1. **Content Generation Tools**  
   - **ChatGPT:** Assuming you haven't been living under a rock, you've heard of this bad boy. Perfect for brainstorming ideas or generating content with just a click. Stop staring at that blinking cursor!
   - **Jasper AI:** This one‚Äôs great for marketing copy. You write, it writes ‚Äì you can finish projects in half the time. It's like having your own personal assistant! 

2. **Graphic Design Software**  
   - **Canva Magic Write:** For all my visually inclined folks, Canva just keeps getting better! The AI bits are awesome for generating content layouts or titles. And it‚Äôs super user-friendly!
   - **Adobe Express:** An editor for all those images and graphics you need. Pro tip: you don‚Äôt have to be a design whiz to make amazing stuff with it.

3. **Video Editing Tools**  
   - **Descript:** This tool is a game-changer for video creators! You can edit videos as easily as editing text. Just delete the words you don‚Äôt want, and poof‚Äîyour video is revamped! Amazing, right?
   - **InVideo:** Need to make promotional videos quickly? This platform has great templates and easy-to-use features that won't make you want to pull your hair out. Try it; thank me later!

4. **Social Media Management**  
   - **Buffer or Hootsuite:** These are lifesavers for scheduling posts across platforms. You can plan a week‚Äôs worth of content in one coffee-fueled session. Why stress every day when a little planning can go a long way?

5. **Copy Editing Tools**  
   - **Grammarly:** Seriously, it's like having a writing coach by your side. Helps you catch those pesky typos and gives you suggestions that make you sound like a total pro (even when you're writing at 3 a.m.). 
   - **Hemingway App:** Want your writing to be punchy and clear? This tool highlights complicated sentences and tells you how to simplify. Because who has time for fluff? ü•±

You've got tools that can save you time, money, and a few migraines. And that's just the tip of the iceberg! üåü 

**Now, a little advice to avoid throwing your hard-earned money away:** 

- **Do your research:** Don‚Äôt just jump on the bandwagon because everyone‚Äôs raving about it. Try free trials before making a commitment!
- **Join online communities:** Swapping stories and tips with other creators can lead you to those lesser-known gems.
- **Keep it simple:** You don‚Äôt need every tool under the sun. Identify what specifically improves your workflow and focus on that.

At the end of the day, the goal is *not* to spend every dime on every tool out there but to choose the right ones that empower your creativity and make your life easier. Have you tried any of these tools? Or maybe you had a flop experience with one? Either way, let‚Äôs keep the conversation rolling! üí¨",1,1757687643.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/s/6r9H1ZDJKr

Hey everyone. I know I promised to get back to you, and I really need to. I've been trying to process what I saw all this time, but it just won't leave me alone. It's worse than I thought. Honestly, I'm just disturbed right now.
My night shift yesterday started as usual. I walked through the park, drank my coffee, and had to shoo away some teenagers who apparently had nothing better to do than scream and party. I watched the birds, the squirrels, and even saw some wild boars, just like always. The evening started out calm and peaceful, just like any other, except for the teenagers.

Around 10 p.m., I heard various animals coming from one direction. At first, I didn't think anything of it, but when I heard so many footsteps and animals, I thought I'd take a look‚Äîthough in hindsight, I wish I never had. So I walked quietly and slowly in the direction the sounds seemed to be coming from, being careful not to step on any sticks or leaves so as not to scare the animals away with my presence. With every step I took closer to the animals, I heard more of them. First, it was just the grunting of some pigs and the cracking of leaves and sticks on the ground. Then it was the sound that deer make and the flapping of some birds, even though the wind was practically still.

At some point, I got so close to the sound that I couldn't tell which direction it was coming from. It felt like the noises were right in my head. The cracking of leaves and sticks, pigs, birds, and the splashing of water. I also heard something I perceived as breathing, but it sounded somehow distorted‚Äîas if it wasn't at regular intervals, but more like one continuous breath.

I was now standing in front of a raised area about 3 meters high. The area felt warmer, although I have to admit I still had goosebumps. So I took three careful steps up and lay down on my stomach so as not to be seen directly by the animals. I slid slightly up and still can't believe what I saw. I didn't count exactly, but there must have been about 50 animals standing in one spot. Wolves, rabbits, boars, deer, birds, and I even saw some bears, all creatures that are supposed to be enemies and not having a coffee party together. I watched this behavior for a few seconds and had to first process what I was seeing.

And as shocked as I was, I didn't notice a wild boar approaching the group from my right. I jumped up in surprise, and when the animals noticed I was watching them, they started to tear each other apart. I saw deer ramming their antlers into the bodies of wild boars, wolves biting the heads off rabbits and birds, birds flying in every direction, and bears simply running into the mass, tearing apart whatever they could get their claws on. I was too shocked to move; I was frozen and just watched and listened to what was happening. The sound of torn and shredded flesh, the cracking of bones, and the loud screams of various animals.

In that short minute I stood there frozen, exactly 37 dead animals lay on the ground. Yes, I counted them, and believe me, the taste of iron I had in my mouth and the smell of open guts in my nose were unbearable and an event I will never forget. I stood there for a while longer to process what I had seen. Why didn't they attack me? Why were they standing there? Why did they kill each other as soon as they noticed me watching? All questions that ran through my head, but for which I found no answer.

I threw up into some puddles of blood before I left and called my supervisor to explain what had just happened. ""What is it?"" he asked when he finally answered on the third try. ""I-I-I,"" I began to stutter. ""What, you? Is everything okay?"" he asked with a slightly concerned voice. ""I just watched about 50 animals slaughter each other after they noticed they were being watched by me,"" I described the situation. ""Oh, please, you're calling me at 3 a.m. for this? Don't mess with me, or you'll be looking for a new job soon."" he said before abruptly hanging up.

I went back to my post and called my best friend, who is currently exploring on the other side of the world because he's an archaeologist. ""Your call couldn't be more fitting,"" he said immediately after picking up. ""I just finished exploring a cave entrance, and you won't believe what I found,"" he said without waiting for a reply from me. ""And you probably won't believe what I just experienced either,"" I said quickly to interrupt him. ""I just saw a group of animals, about 50 of them in one spot, brutally slaughter each other after they realized I saw them."" ""Are you making fun of me?"" he asked playfully.

I explained the whole situation to him and convinced him to believe me after telling him every detail. We tried to look for logical reasons for a while, but after we couldn't find any logical conclusions, he told me about his cave. ""I found an entrance to a cave that is older than humanity; at least older than we believe humanity to be."" I frowned. ""I've already seen some cave paintings that are older than we currently assume humanity is,"" he said full of enthusiasm. ""I haven't been able to decipher them yet, but I can definitely make out animals and people with some sort of glow."" He told me three or four more times to please not tell anyone about it, as it would be a breakthrough in his career.

I'm going to go to sleep now after this night and process what I've experienced. In the meantime, does any of you have an idea what I might have seen there? I would really appreciate any messages, and I'll get back to you when I'm ready.",1,1757687548.0,RedditHorrorStories,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve tried all sorts of different brewers/drippers. V60, Kalita, Chemex, Aeropress, French press. V60 always wins out. Others provide more consistent, easier to replicate brews but my best v60 cups are better than the others. 

Aeropress being a close second. But mostly good for smaller cups. Most of the time I want a bit more coffee.  

Chemex with a coffee sock is up there too and gets points for saving paper but it is a hassle to clean. I mostly use it for large 60g brews when I make coffee for me and my partner. 

Kalita never wowed me in any way. Was just rather dull compared to the others. I‚Äôm sure if I added a screen to prevent clogging it would be better but I never tried. That plus it being on the smaller brew side as well just leaves it sitting on my shelf. 

French press is basically just a large Aeropress without a paper filter. Makes good cups but I rarely choose it. 

Enter the Timemore B75. On its own, it‚Äôs a fine brewer. Similar to the Kalita but with much better draw down and no clogging issues. But compared to the v60, to me it comes up short. Good, consistent cups, just no ‚Äúwow‚Äù cups. 
That is until yesterday afternoon. 

I decided to make a quick 15g brew with it and use my Aeropress as a makeshift Melodrip. I did a 50 gram bloom without the Aeropress then placed it on the B75 and zeroed the scale then poured to 200. The resulting cup was amazing. It was without doubt the best cup of coffee I‚Äôve ever had at home. I repeated it this morning with 18g to have just a bit more coffee and the cup was again amazing. Bright, juicy, excellent body. Tasting notes clear as day. 

I‚Äôd definitely recommend picking one up, specially if you have a Melodrip or Aeropress and trying it out. ",1,1757687441.0,pourover,13,0.67,False

The USC Trojans (2-0) and Purdue Boilermakers (2-0) are set to collide in West Lafayette on September 13, 2025, in a game that‚Äôs equal parts ‚ÄúHere comes the cavalry‚Äù and ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs hoping the cavalry remembers how to tie its boots.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break down the numbers, news, and why this might be the most one-sided ‚Äúupset‚Äù since a teapot won a coffee convention.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Math Class You‚Äôll Actually Enjoy

USC is a **21-point favorite**, with decimal odds of roughly **1.06** (implied probability: \~94.3%) to win. For Purdue, decimal odds of **9.5-10.5** (implied probability: \~8.7-10.5%) suggest bookmakers think the Boilermakers have about as much chance as a snowman in a sauna. The over/under is **59.5 points**, with models projecting a **62-point explosion**‚Äîa ‚Äúlow‚Äù of 59.5 in college football terms is like saying a hurricane is ‚Äúa bit breezy.‚Äù

USC‚Äôs offense is **#1 in total yards per play** and features a running back (Waymond Jordan) who averages **10 yards per carry**‚Äîa stat so absurd it makes a cheetah envious. Quarterback Jayden Maiava has already racked up **6 passing touchdowns** and a ‚Äújust for fun‚Äù rushing TD. Defensively, USC has **9 sacks and 4 takeaways**, which is basically a math problem: *How many times can you humiliate a defense before it quits?*

Purdue, meanwhile, is led by new coach Barry Odom, a defensive guru who‚Äôs already shut out Ball State 31-0. Their rushing defense (307 yards allowed) edges out their pass defense (289), which is like saying a leaky faucet is better than a geyser. Purdue QB Ryan Browne has **481 yards and 4 TDs** in two games‚Äîimpressive, but USC‚Äôs defense has allowed just **20 points total**.

---

### Digest the News: A Tale of Two Turnarounds

USC‚Äôs coach, Lincoln Riley, called Purdue ‚Äúmuch improved‚Äù this season, which is generous. The Boilermakers went **1-11 in 2023**, with their lone win a 49-0 drubbing of FCS Indiana State‚Äîa team that probably still hasn‚Äôt forgiven Purdue for this. Now, Purdue boasts **80 new players** via the transfer portal and true freshmen, which is like rebuilding a car while it‚Äôs still moving. Their

*""It starts with a hum, but ends with a choice""*



**1\] The Encounter :**

A normal day, Ethan goes to college by metro. He boards the usual 7:45 AM train, and the compartment is empty, there are 3 people on that side of the compartment. There was a lady seated opposite to him, she starts humming. Ethan thinks that she was wearing AirPods, but she wasn‚Äôt. He felt kinda weird and avoided it, she stopped humming. Later, again she started humming, but this time it was loud‚Ä¶ like loud, and then she stops it, he just looks at her, and to his horror that lady was staring right into his soul. He looked away, and later once again looked at her, and this time she was staring at him, now this scared him. He doesn‚Äôt know what to do, and by that time she took her phone out, Ethan knows that it wasn‚Äôt a good sign and he gets off of the train. Now, he started thinking about how the lady appeared, because he was traumatised. She was wearing a purple top, with black pants, pink handbag, a green phone, hair carelessly done, and she looked like she was in her forties. Ethan just tries to forget about it, and tells his experience to his friends and they laugh it off. He never knew what awaited him next.





**2\] The Mark :**

Eventually Ethan forgot about this lady and carried on with his college stuff, but all changes when he starts receiving weird texts from unknown numbers. He just avoids them because he doesn‚Äôt wanna take the risk of losing his data. He initially thought that they were some scammers trying to steal his data, he was so traumatised by that lady that if he hears someone hum he would go into ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mode. Eventually, the text messages were no longer messages but just ‚Äúna‚Ä¶na..na..‚Äù Ethan is disturbed now. He gets weird dreams in the night. He realised that he has fallen into some sort of trap.





**3\] The Pursuit :**

He was no longer imagining it. There were people watching him, not overtly but subtly. This disturbs him completely, random men smiling at him like they were familiar with him, women looking at him and whispering at each other. Then comes one night, Ethan left his college little late, and it‚Äôs twilight now, he was walking his way back and he hears someone humming, the same way the lady was humming, his heart started pounding faster, he looks back and sees no one. He reaches his house and his doorbell goes off. He comes out to find an envelope that had a black note written in silver ink which said

*‚ÄúJoin us or disappear‚Äù*

He doesn‚Äôt tell his parents, instead takes it to his room and keeps it on his table.





**4\] The Resonant Thread :**

He started searching, he found out that this envelope was sent by an organisation called ‚ÄúThe Order Of The Six Tones‚Äù it was basically an underground cult founded decades ago, no known location. He eventually learned that they recruit people based on how they react to the Leader‚Äôs hum, i.e., they recruit through resonance. They usually target the ‚Äúgifted‚Äù, musicians, empaths, dreamers or just people who are fractured enough to hear something others can‚Äôt. The Humming wasn‚Äôt music, it was Manipulation. He knew that he wasn‚Äôt chosen, he was claimed. There were 10 council members in the cult, and 50 members, but not all 60 showed up, only 7 were active in the cult‚Äôs activities. The cult‚Äôs main day was on September 13 of every year, where all the members and new people who were recruited by others would gather, Ethan was expected to attend that Grand Feast, which was just 2 days later.





**5\] The Gathering :**

Ethan decides to show up, he told his parents that he has special classes till 5 PM and goes to the meeting, he reached the building where the feast is supposed to happen, and he goes inside. The volunteer looks at him and nods, like he was expecting Ethan‚Äôs arrival. He goes to the hall, and finds the Council members seated in a semi circle, when he entered all the attention was towards him. The leader stood up and welcomed him. All of them wearing a purple shirt with a black overcoat, they eventually said that purple signifies royalty and rarity, hence purple is their cult‚Äôs uniform. Without further delay, the leader makes Ethan sit right next to her, and they begin their rituals. It was a dark setting, with candle lights, faint blue light, with strong humming. Ethan standing cluelessly, looks at the rest of the people. The ritual only lasted for an hour, and the leader asked everyone to be seated. They were given a grand meal, only time Ethan was thankful for what had happened that day, because the food was too good and he never had eaten food like that before. After the meal the leader goes up to him¬†

*‚ÄúTake two days,‚Äù she said, her tone neither threatening nor pleading. ‚ÄúListen to the world. If it sings to you‚Ä¶ come back. If it doesn‚Äôt, walk away.‚Äù*





**6\] When the World Sings :**

The first day, he wakes up in the morning feeling better than ever. He goes to his college, a teacher who never knew about Ethan started praising about how attentive he was during the class. His friends are being nicer to him, on his way back home, he meets his friend after a long time, and she offers to go out and have a coffee with him. He thought of telling this to her, but he just didn‚Äôt. They had the best conversation so far, he feels incredible and goes to his house. Second day, he finds some money in his pocket which he doesn‚Äôt remember having. He goes to college, spends that money in the canteen and that day they had a surprise test, where he had done exceptionally well, again another teacher praises him for his marks. Everything felt so good, and tomorrow was the day, he is now unsure whether he has to be a part of it or not.





**7\] The Decision :**

He got ready, went to that place and the leader stood right there, almost as if she had been waiting the whole time. The leader stepped forward and hugged him.¬†

*‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said softly, almost like a mother speaking to a child, ‚ÄúTell me, Ethan‚Ä¶ did the world sing to you?‚Äù*

¬†Ethan stood there, frozen. He thought of the past days: The praise, the test, the coffee, the laughter. Everything had been perfect‚Ä¶ maybe too perfect. Was this destiny, or was it a trap? Would he ever know the difference? The leader‚Äôs hand rested gently on his shoulder, waiting. The entire council stared at him in silence. Ethan took a deep breath. When he finally spoke, the hum stopped. Whether he stayed or walked away‚Ä¶ only the walls of that room knew.

His friends are being nicer to him, on his way back home, he meets his friend after a long time, and she offers to go out and have a coffee with him. He thought of telling this to her, but he just didn‚Äôt. They had the best conversation so far, he feels incredible and goes to his house. Second day, he finds some money in his pocket which he doesn‚Äôt remember having. He goes to college, spends that money in the canteen and that day they had a surprise test, where he had done exceptionally well, again another teacher praises him for his marks. Everything felt so good, and tomorrow was the day, he is now unsure whether he has to be a part of it or not.





**7\] The Decision :**

He got ready, went to that place and the leader stood right there, almost as if she had been waiting the whole time. The leader stepped forward and hugged him.¬†

*‚ÄúSo,‚Äù she said softly, almost like a mother speaking to a child, ‚ÄúTell me, Ethan‚Ä¶ did the world sing to you?‚Äù*

¬†Ethan stood there, frozen. He thought of the past days: The praise, the test, the coffee, the laughter. Everything had been perfect‚Ä¶ maybe too perfect. Was this destiny, or was it a trap? Would he ever know the difference? The leader‚Äôs hand rested gently on his shoulder, waiting. The entire council stared at him in silence. Ethan took a deep breath. When he finally spoke, the hum stopped. Whether he stayed or walked away‚Ä¶ only the walls of that room knew.

Guys. For real. Yesterday I woke up broke and cranky, no coffee in the house, phone on 12% because I can‚Äôt even afford a good charger. Now? I‚Äôm staring at a $100 deposit from ***testing apps on my phone.*** 

Not joking. Not ‚Äúguru-fake-rich‚Äù real, but **actual $100** in my real-life, pathetic checking account.

And now I‚Äôm wondering‚Äîhow have I gone my entire life NOT knowing about this?

Let me lay it out for anyone who‚Äôs as broke and bewildered as me:

- Found this *random-looking* list on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. No weird ads, no 40-minute crypto pitches.
- Picked a few apps that looked chill‚Äîthink silly games, shopping, one of those ‚Äúrate this outfit‚Äù ones.
- Each app had a different ‚Äúmission‚Äù: 5-star feedback, screenshots, or sometimes just poke around and record your screen.
- All I needed was my phone. Literally. Just my janky Android.
- Most apps paid through PayPal or CashApp. Super fast.
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** was the actual gold mine. Like, why does no one ever talk about this?

Before noon, I‚Äôd already sent off, like, EIGHT different app reviews, didn‚Äôt even have to get out of bed. Some paid $2, some $5, and a couple gave me $15 just for giving honest feedback.

At first, I figured: yeah, right, where‚Äôs the scam? I expected to get ghosted after hour one.

Shocker: Money popped RIGHT INTO my account by dinner.

Glossing over the awkward ‚Äúhow do you get money from your phone?‚Äù texts from my mom, here‚Äôs why this is actually working:

- No ‚Äú$250 minimum redemption‚Äù rules
- Actual genuine apps‚Äînot the crypto nonsense or ‚Äúwatch 10 hours of ads‚Äù nightmare
- A legit, regularly updated list (kept refreshing **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** just to be sure)
- Zero upfront fees, ever

So here‚Äôs the million-dollar question‚Ä¶ why the #@%&# have I been doomscrolling Twitter instead of literally getting paid to tap and type?

If you‚Äôre still skeptical (I get it, 2024 internet is just one scam after another), go poke around **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** yourself. 

Worst case? You waste five minutes and move on.  
Best case? You end the day $100 richer with nothing but a semi-functional cellphone and sarcasm as your weapon.

Keeping it real: it‚Äôs not millionaire money. But if you need instant side cash, this is hands-down the weirdest, easiest win I‚Äôve had since free pizza in college.

Check **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** out. Maybe this is your wake-up call too. ü§Øüí∏

Anyone else tried it? Am I crazy or is this an actual loophole in the Matrix? Drop your experience/tips below if you‚Äôve tested apps. Is it just beginner‚Äôs luck??

- ‚úÖ Saving money feels fake when I wasn‚Äôt planning to spend anything in the first place

Why do I, a person with perfectly fine ankles, feel low-key convinced that maybe I *should* have this on standby? Like‚Ä¶ just in case??  

Reddit logic is insane:  
- You read a post about a kitchen gadget, now you *need* it or else dinner will never be the same again.  
- Somebody shares their ‚Äúlife hack,‚Äù suddenly it feels almost irresponsible NOT to buy the thing.  
- And the FOMO thread always lands‚Äîyou might not even like coffee, but now you‚Äôre questioning your identity if you don‚Äôt own that one grinder upgrade.  

It‚Äôs starting to make me wonder if Reddit is more dangerous for my bank account than any advertising feed scrolling app.

This was my first time trying to do piping. I have no idea what happened to my buttercream but there were little flakes of sugar or something that had formed in the buttercream either while defrosting or while whipping. I think I fully defrosted it and I whipped the buttercream again before adding the Bailey's/espresso powder so not sure where the flakes were from...

*""It starts with a hum, but ends with a choice""*



**1\] The Encounter :**

A normal day, Ethan goes to college by metro. He boards the usual 7:45 AM train, and the compartment is empty, there are 3 people on that side of the compartment. There was a lady seated opposite to him, she starts humming. Ethan thinks that she was wearing AirPods, but she wasn‚Äôt. He felt kinda weird and avoided it, she stopped humming. Later, again she started humming, but this time it was loud‚Ä¶ like loud, and then she stops it, he just looks at her, and to his horror that lady was staring right into his soul. He looked away, and later once again looked at her, and this time she was staring at him, now this scared him. He doesn‚Äôt know what to do, and by that time she took her phone out, Ethan knows that it wasn‚Äôt a good sign and he gets off of the train. Now, he started thinking about how the lady appeared, because he was traumatised. She was wearing a purple top, with black pants, pink handbag, a green phone, hair carelessly done, and she looked like she was in her forties. Ethan just tries to forget about it, and tells his experience to his friends and they laugh it off. He never knew what awaited him next.





**2\] The Mark :**

Eventually Ethan forgot about this lady and carried on with his college stuff, but all changes when he starts receiving weird texts from unknown numbers. He just avoids them because he doesn‚Äôt wanna take the risk of losing his data. He initially thought that they were some scammers trying to steal his data, he was so traumatised by that lady that if he hears someone hum he would go into ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mode. Eventually, the text messages were no longer messages but just ‚Äúna‚Ä¶na..na..‚Äù Ethan is disturbed now. He gets weird dreams in the night. He realised that he has fallen into some sort of trap.





**3\] The Pursuit :**

He was no longer imagining it. There were people watching him, not overtly but subtly. This disturbs him completely, random men smiling at him like they were familiar with him, women looking at him and whispering at each other. Then comes one night, Ethan left his college little late, and it‚Äôs twilight now, he was walking his way back and he hears someone humming, the same way the lady was humming, his heart started pounding faster, he looks back and sees no one. He reaches his house and his doorbell goes off. He comes out to find an envelope that had a black note written in silver ink which said

*‚ÄúJoin us or disappear‚Äù*

He doesn‚Äôt tell his parents, instead takes it to his room and keeps it on his table.





**4\] The Resonant Thread :**

He started searching, he found out that this envelope was sent by an organisation called ‚ÄúThe Order Of The Six Tones‚Äù it was basically an underground cult founded decades ago, no known location. He eventually learned that they recruit people based on how they react to the Leader‚Äôs hum, i.e., they recruit through resonance. They usually target the ‚Äúgifted‚Äù, musicians, empaths, dreamers or just people who are fractured enough to hear something others can‚Äôt. The Humming wasn‚Äôt music, it was Manipulation. He knew that he wasn‚Äôt chosen, he was claimed. There were 10 council members in the cult, and 50 members, but not all 60 showed up, only 7 were active in the cult‚Äôs activities. The cult‚Äôs main day was on September 13 of every year, where all the members and new people who were recruited by others would gather, Ethan was expected to attend that Grand Feast, which was just 2 days later.





**5\] The Gathering :**

Ethan decides to show up, he told his parents that he has special classes till 5 PM and goes to the meeting, he reached the building where the feast is supposed to happen, and he goes inside. The volunteer looks at him and nods, like he was expecting Ethan‚Äôs arrival. He goes to the hall, and finds the Council members seated in a semi circle, when he entered all the attention was towards him. The leader stood up and welcomed him. All of them wearing a purple shirt with a black overcoat, they eventually said that purple signifies royalty and rarity, hence purple is their cult‚Äôs uniform. Without further delay, the leader makes Ethan sit right next to her, and they begin their rituals. It was a dark setting, with candle lights, faint blue light, with strong humming. Ethan standing cluelessly, looks at the rest of the people. The ritual only lasted for an hour, and the leader asked everyone to be seated. They were given a grand meal, only time Ethan was thankful for what had happened that day, because the food was too good and he never had eaten food like that before. After the meal the leader goes up to him¬†

*‚ÄúTake two days,‚Äù she said, her tone neither threatening nor pleading. ‚ÄúListen to the world. If it sings to you‚Ä¶ come back. If it doesn‚Äôt, walk away.‚Äù*





**6\] When the World Sings :**

The first day, he wakes up in the morning feeling better than ever. He goes to his college, a teacher who never knew about Ethan started praising about how attentive he was during the class. His friends are being nicer to him, on his way back home, he meets his friend after a long time, and she offers to go out and have a coffee with him.

‚ÄúI would die for you,‚Äù he said again one night, eyes glassy, voice trembling. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôd kill for you too.‚Äù

Christina laughed nervously, brushing it off. But her stomach twisted. That wasn‚Äôt devotion. That was a warning.

She tried to pull away. Blocked his number. Changed her locks. But Michael was persistent. He showed up at her sister‚Äôs baby shower with a gift addressed to ‚ÄúMy Future Wife.‚Äù He left notes on her windshield, quoting Prince lyrics like scripture.
I‚Äôm not your woman, Michael, she told him.
You are. You just forgot, he replied.

The final straw came on a rainy Thursday. Christina walked into her apartment and found Michael sitting on her couch, soaked, trembling, holding a knife‚Äînot pointed at her, but at himself.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo either you come back to me, or I make good on my promise.‚Äù

She froze. Her mind raced. This wasn‚Äôt love. This was a hostage situation wrapped in a memory of affection.

Michael stood, knife still in hand. ‚ÄúYou said you loved me once. That has to mean something.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt does,‚Äù Christina said, voice steady. ‚ÄúIt means I know what love isn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She backed toward the kitchen, heart pounding. Her phone was on the counter. If she could just‚Äî

Michael lunged. Not at her, but toward the door, blocking it. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to leave me. Not again.‚Äù

Christina saw it then‚Äîhis eyes weren‚Äôt pleading anymore. They were wild. Empty. The kind of emptiness that swallows everything whole.

She had two choices.
Give herself over to a man who‚Äôd already erased her boundaries.
Or end it. Blaze of glory. No turning back.

She grabbed the cast iron skillet from the stove. Heavy. Familiar. Her grandmother‚Äôs.
Michael stepped forward.
‚ÄúI would die for you,‚Äù he whispered.

Christina swung.

---

The police report said it was self-defense.
The therapist said it was trauma.
Her mother said it was survival.

But Christina knew the truth.
It was liberation.

She still hears Prince sometimes, playing from a passing car or a late-night playlist.
I‚Äôm not your woman, I‚Äôm not your man, I am something that you‚Äôll never understand‚Ä¶

And she smiles.
Because she finally understands herself.
And she knows now‚Äîlove should never come with a threat.

Michael is doing well at the hospital. They don‚Äôt let him listen to Prince, it agitates him and he scares the other ward patients.

She moved states away just in case, and sometimes still wonders if everything was all her fault. If she should of just surrendered to the type of love Michael had to give‚Ä¶",2,1757686567.0,stories,1,0.75,False

I freshly graduated highschool in 2025,and in the future I want to move to an area near London in a big large estate and have a similar estate near Amsterdam.

A little about me: I‚Äôm a mix of witty + introspective.I love reading, journaling, autumn walks, working out at home, and coffee shop moments with a cappuccino. I‚Äôm very into wellness, routines, and a bit of nerdy hyperfixation energy (ask me about Taylor Swift or my latest book rant and I‚Äôll light up).

What I‚Äôm looking for: someone emotionally intelligent, funny, and aligned with the childfree lifestyle. Someone who can handle banter, support my ambitions, and wants to build a fulfilling life together that doesn‚Äôt revolve around kids ‚Äî but around us.

If this resonates, send me a message with your favorite book, joke, or just a ‚Äúhi.‚Äù Who knows, maybe fate really does work in unexpected ways. üòâ

And would rather have a way to get AI deals to come to you?

Then this is for you.

One of the quickest ways I know to get the attention of business owners and have them approach us

‚Ä¶is to run paid ads to a cold audience.

You don‚Äôt need to be a top media buyer or an experienced lead gen for this to work.

You don‚Äôt even need to have funky ad creatives (our F-UGLY ads work just fine for this)

As long as you have 25-50 bucks per day to tip into an ad account?

And are happy to keep your ads running for at least a week or two?

You could use paid ads to get your AI offer in front of a lot of business owners, super fast.

BUT‚Ä¶

Simply getting their attention isn‚Äôt enough.

If you want to get potential AI partners hitting you up and asking: ""How do we work with you?""

You need a way for ANY interested business owner, in ANY niche, to INSTANTLY demo your AI bot.

Because you need them to experience the ""aha!"" moment on their own terms.

Now, if you've got incredible copy chops, can write ads that practically print money, or have a massive budget to blast your message everywhere?

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be able to book coffee dates with keen biz owners without a ""self-demo"" tool.

But if you'd rather take the shortcut and want businesses coming to you pre-sold, with their wallets half out?
