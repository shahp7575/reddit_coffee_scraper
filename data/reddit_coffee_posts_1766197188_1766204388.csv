My housemate is a teacher and she has come home with a trove of end-of-year gifts from her students (well, from their parents). Most are chocolate but there is also an abundance of quite basic planners, coffee mugs and diaries. The styles of these aren’t really aligned with who she is and she’s not sure how she’s going to use them. Her favourite gifts are a book shop voucher and a card. They’re mine, too.

I’ve never been good with gifts and I have made it a goal to get better with this and try to gift more. I wasn’t exposed to that many “gifts” growing up and we didn’t really do holidays. My favourite gifts to receive are usually scents, books and art (this last one is quite dependent on the style though).

I want my gifts to be good and genuinely thought out. I want this to be the case for my friends, lovers and even people like any of my future kid’s teachers.

I have since started drawing boundaries for them and really holding my ground on them. I found out last year my sister had been stealing all the extra money I was giving her to pay down a car loan she helped me get. I went and did some digging with a banker and printed all the proof because I knew she would deny it which she did until I brought out said proof. then turned it all around on me trying to make me the villain. she has turned my entire family against me since. even after I presented them with proof of her stealing from me, and my mother who she takes anywhere from 650$ to 800$ a month from. after finding this I switched all bills into just my name except the loan which I have been making payments on myself now.  I have to stay with my parents as they are both in bad health. dad is in heart failure and mom is in terrible health because she refuses to change her lifestyle. sister helps with moms doctors and I do dads. I have to give them both insulin every day/night so I cant even take a real vacation or stay out overnight which is destroying my personal life. recently ran into some people from my old church and they were telling me a whole slew of things my sister and mother have been saying about me. most of which is either extremely exaggerated or just flat out a lie. when I asked about who was telling them these things they were hesitant to say because they could tell I was very confused by what they were saying, they said my mother and sister were the ones who told them these things. I feel destroyed. I give up my life for these people. I pay all the bills I buy most of the food in the house which I cant even cook for myself cuz I cant ever get into the kitchen because one of them is always in there.

1pr51tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/SimCompanies/comments/1pr51tn/mechanics_seasons_of_the_year/,Mechanics: Seasons of the Year,"PROPOSAL:

Similar seasons of the year that serve as an additional factor to the economic phases, but focused on agricultural products.



OBJECTIVE:

To provide greater dynamism for those who prefer farming in the game.



HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT?

Increase or decrease production of between 5-10% per product. Each season can last one or more economic cycles.

AUTUMN: + Forage, -Grains, -Seeds, + Coffee Beans, - Sugarcane, -Cocoa

WINTER: + Vegetales, -Apple, -Orange, -Grapes, -Cows, -Pigs, -Coffee Beans, -Cotton, -Eggs

SPRING: + Cocoa, + Cows, + Pigs, + Grains, + Seeds, + Eggs, - Forage, + Water

SUMMER: + Apples, + Oranges, + Grapes, - Vegetables, + Sugarcane, + Cotton, - Water



\*\*\*This is distributed so that each product has a positive and a negative value.

\*\*\*You can also add a short description to the seasons section to liven it up:

AUTUMN: The winds are dry and can cause plants to dry out.

WINTER: Many plants go dormant, and animals reduce their activity.

SPRING: Temperatures become milder, and there is abundant rainfall; animals awaken from their winter dormancy.

SUMMER: Season of high temperatures; the trees are green and full of fruit.

\*\*\*I made this proposal in 2022 and I'm updating it here because I never received any feedback from the higher-ups.

I would appreciate your feedback, and thank you very much.

I’ve been through stock basket, IMS basket, puck screen, filter paper. I rotated everything to eliminate variables. Even went all the back to no filters, puck screen, and stock basket. 

I decided to go back to the basics. Stock filter, no puck screen.

I pulled this shot 5 minutes after second shot. It was gross. 

Technically, the 3rd shot should’ve tasted the best. It might’ve been the worst. Could it be a temperature issue? It was pretty sour. Could it be my k6 grinder is limited?

I might skip most gatherings, but I appreciate you thinking of me!” It’s honest, kind, and shuts down guilt-tripping before it starts. Most people accept it better when it’s said early.
* **The Irish goodbye (or strategic exit plan)** If you do decide to show up to something:
   * Set a hard time limit in advance (e.g., “I’ll stay 60–90 minutes max”).
   * Arrive late enough that you miss the awkward small-talk warm-up phase.
   * Park in a spot that allows quick escape.
   * Have an exit line ready: “I’ve got an early thing tomorrow / headache coming on / need to feed the cat.” No one ever questions it twice.
* **The minimal viable appearance** Show up for the absolute shortest socially acceptable window (e.g., drop off a gift, say hi to the host, grab a drink, leave after one lap). People remember that you came, and you’ve fulfilled the obligation with minimal drain.
* **Offer an alternative that costs you less energy** “I’m not great with big groups right now, but I’d love to grab coffee with you one-on-one in January.” It shows you value the person without signing up for the 4-hour family marathon.
* **Guilt neutralization script** When the inevitable “But it’s Christmas! Family! Tradition!” pressure hits, have a calm response ready: “I know it’s important to you, and I love you all, but large social stuff really wipes me out. I’m happier and a better version of myself when I protect my energy. Hope you understand.” Repeat as needed. You’re not asking permission—you’re informing.
* **Reward yourself brutally** Schedule something you actually love immediately after any obligation you can’t dodge. Deep dive into a book, a new game, a rabbit-hole research topic, whatever. The positive reinforcement makes the discomfort feel worth it.
* **Nuclear option: Full opt-out** If it’s all too much, just don’t go. Send a nice message or small gift if you want. Most people get over it faster than you think. Your mental health > performative holiday cheer.

He’s had the same best friend since college, Ryan (33M). They were inseparable. Game nights, gym buddies, trips together. I never questioned it because I trusted my husband completely.

Ryan is married to Lena (31F). We weren’t super close, but we were friendly. Double dates, birthdays, holidays, that kind of thing.

A few months ago, Lena called me late at night, crying. She told me she had something horrible to tell me but didn’t know how. Earlier that day, she had been out cheating on Ryan. Yes, I know, messy already. While she was leaving the hotel, she saw two men in the lobby she recognized, my husband and Ryan, holding hands and kissing. At first she thought she was imagining things, but then she saw them clearly get into a room together.

She followed them and took a picture of the door number. Later, when she checked Ryan’s location and messages, everything lined up. She confronted him when he got home, and he broke down and admitted he’d been having an affair with Mark for over a year.

I was in shock. Part of me didn’t even want to believe her, but she sent me screenshots of their texts that she’d gotten from Ryan’s iPad. Explicit messages, I love you, plans to meet up. There was no denying it.

When I confronted Mark, he didn’t even try to lie. He said he loved me but was confused, and that Ryan was his safe place. He admitted they’d been sleeping together behind both our backs. I felt like my entire marriage was a lie.

I moved out that night.

Lena and I leaned on each other a lot after that. We were both devastated, embarrassed, and angry. We started meeting for coffee just to vent, then dinners, then long late-night talks. Somewhere along the way, the friendship turned into feelings neither of us expected.

Fast forward several months. Both marriages are over. Mark and Ryan tried to be together openly, but without the secrecy and adrenaline, it fell apart fast. They broke up within a few months and barely even talk now.

Lena and I, on the other hand, realized what we had was real. We took things slow, went to therapy individually and together, and eventually started dating. Now we live together, and for the first time in years, I actually feel seen and respected.

Here’s where I’m torn. Some friends and family say the situation is too messy, that it looks like we just swapped partners, and that it’s wrong to build a relationship out of so much hurt and betrayal, even though we weren’t the ones cheating together.

Others say we’re both victims who found comfort and love in each other after being betrayed.

1pr4v5b,https://v.redd.it/kzvl7omy7a8g1,Advise Please 🔥,"I moved in with a now F30 two years ago. I own all of the furniture except what’s in her room and a coffee pot, see video. The first year, we were friendly but I started to notice her testing my boundaries week after week. She stole food from me, got food/drinks and paint on my dining set, ruined my bamboo patio set, and fucked a guy on my couch without even putting a blanket down (and I walked in). I was angry and told her if she ever disrespects me like this again I can’t live with her. My food is mine and keep your genitals off my stuff. I also bought the same table protector my brother has for my 2 year old nephew, and added it to her monthly bill. 

She apologized profusely, and we tried to move past it. I had tickets to an event six hours away, and she asked if she could buy one of them from me and ride with me. She ended up making us two hours late and honestly, I should’ve left her and driven myself. She slept most of the drive and we missed my favorite song from that artist.

She got with a different guy and basically moved him in. They are the “he said he loves me and I love him too” after a week of dating people. They would go to the gym every morning and he would come back to shower and make breakfast at our place before work. He started staying over 6 nights a week. I asked her if they could cut that down to 3 nights a week and she said absolutely; nothing changed. She told me she wouldn’t care if my boyfriend came over every night, I said that I appreciate that, but neither of us agreed to that when we sign this lease. (My bf comes over once a week, I usually go to his) Two months later I’m working at 9:30 am (I work from home, they don’t) and join a conference call for my new job. Then I hear LOUD sex noises and immediately grabbed my laptop to go in my room. I talk to them a couple days later saying “we have an agreement that we let each other know when we have company over. I had no idea you guys were here. This job means a lot to me and I’m not certain that the people on my conference call didn’t overhear all of those noises. What if they thought I was watching porn while I’m supposed to be doing my job? If I knew you guys were here, I would’ve gone to a coffee shop or worked from my bedroom.” I then also mentioned that I had spoken with her three other times about him staying over every night and it needs to be no more than three nights a week as we previously agreed. I guess she never told him that. He broke up with her shortly after this.

This woman surpasses ditzy - she’s an idiot. Flushes paper towels, doesn’t know how to use a plunger and repeatedly flushes, flooding her carpet with shitty water. When she thought I wasn’t looking I caught her kicking food she dropped under our refrigerator. She’ll have tons of garbage on the counter and recycling will pileup. Instead of taking it out she’ll just start throwing the new recycling away. I let her have it when she asked me to start paying a portion of her rent because she no longer uses the living room. (Sorry? You want me to pay you for not drinking your morning coffee in the living room - when you were bare ass naked on my couch?) I told her absolutely not and told her to look at the floor in the kitchen, which I had not cleaned for two days and it was filthy. Coffee spills here, cereal there, little dash of broccoli, peices of wrappers. I told her it felt like living with a child. She agreed to clean more and I agreed to pay an extra $25 a month because I have a small office nook in the common area - a fraction of the amount she was asking me to pay. 

She did as she always does and tidied up for a day or two and went right back to her bs. 

Jump to yesterday. I was putting away the clean dishes from the dishwasher (all of which I own, except for a couple of her coffee cups). I realized 10 out of 16 glasses are missing. 12 are crystal and 4 are blue glass (my grandmother’s who passed). I shot her a text and said that I noticed a lot of them were missing and asked her where they were. She said a few are in her room, but some of them were in her car and her mother was cleaning out her car and threw them away. I asked her which one she threw away and she confirmed it was 2 out of 4 of the blue ones. I only have one blue one left. She has no idea where the 4th one is. I texted her back livid and she asked me if I wanted to talk to her mom and that her mom will buy me new glasses because it’s “better than nothing.“ I went in her room/bath which I never do to see if the glasses were in there. There were only three crystal ones and you would not believe the state of her bathroom (vid attached)

I’ve always been pretty calm when I address things with her. I think through what I’m going to say and I’m very direct. I’m always understanding, I’m always firm. But she doesn’t seem to be hearing me. But this? My rage is nuclear level.

We were finally in the house at the same time today and she sheepishly said “hey I’m sorry” and very angrily I told her I don’t want talk to her right now and slammed the front door on my way out. 

I’ve talked to the leasing office and without getting this asshole to sign off, I can’t break the lease, it would cost $4000 as well. So I have two options. Stay for the next nine months until the lease is out or get her to agree to move somebody else in here to take over my end of the lease. That option also makes me angry that I would be the one inconvenience while she continues living in a beautiful and safe neighborhood.

I know a guy from my university, and I’ve had a crush on him for a year, on and off. He’s really cute, calm, kind, and warm. He gives off a librarian vibe, like the type who might love cats, read books, and enjoy coffee. He has a beautiful smile and hair, and his eyes look amazing in sunlight. A year ago, my social skills were really lacking, so the chances of developing better contact or a friendship were practically zero, but he was very kind to me back then.

We don’t have many opportunities to see each other during breaks at university, but when we do meet, I’m open, and it’s often fun. This crush feels a bit different from my previous ones, more romantic than just physical. Thinking about him makes my heart melt, but at the same time, I’m afraid it might not work out again because two previous crushes rejected me.

He’s a friend of my friend, so we have some contact, but I haven’t told her about my crush to avoid things being awkward. I don’t really know how I could get closer to him since we don’t have shared classes, and my only plan so far is to send him Christmas greetings.

1pr4qxv,https://i.redd.it/wy7ngraw6a8g1.jpeg,My advice on season start.,"This is for soloq and duo players, btw. If you mainly play trio or 5 man, then just stick to high rank synergies and get out before I get silly.

For my fellas that haven't reached immortal last season, this is gonna suck, but even then, getting out of Epic I is a pain anyone wish to alleviate. I was immortal and am already legend after 5 matches and 5 victories.

Here's how you can do it:
1. Avoid first picks— in general, first picks should always be for the meta heroes, but you're gambling right now, your allies may be so bad that meta heroes aren't enough to help you, and your enemy may be former top globals. Even if this means giving the enemy a chance to pick a meta hero, risk it. In lower ranks, you have a much greater chance at succeeding with a counter-pick or a comfort pick over the meta, because this rank requires your micro to be superior to your macro, or equally as sharp.
2. Rely on your allies— you will get nonsensical allies, I literally had to carry a match with an Odette split pushing that couldn't even set her ultimate from a bush, but I still won because my Beatrix didn't give up and kept playing with me. The chances of you getting 4 goobers is high, but not always the case. Stick by the one ally you trust and help them. Give them coms, protect them. As for the other allies, use them as distraction. Your team doesn't know how to initiate? Lure your enemy to them and let them take the damage while you clear the threat and secure yourself a nice play. That may cost your ally's trust, but if you both win, then they'll likely forgive you.
3. Synergies— if you're a duo trying to climb, having to deal with nonsense trio shenanigans on your team, then use synergies that often leads to victories. Ixia x Diggie, Fred x Angela/Estes (he got buffed deluxe). Another thing that you can do is have one person secure a position that can carry the game (gold, exp and jungle) and have the other play a supporting position (roam and mid). This way you can secure yourselves a comfortable late game if your allies can't help their buffoonery. Never play double supporting positions or carry positions, risking not having a trustworthy support or a carry will cost you the match.
4. Take care of yourself— make sure that you're in a good state. Have some food, make some coffee, put some music in the back, call with your friends. Just avoid being in a situation that gets you stressed so easily. If you're hungry, tired, bored, or stressed, you're more likely to lose your temper or lose focus during a match. In the end, self-control and self-preservation leads to you being a better player overall, and it helps you avoid constantly raging at matches but keep on playing regardless, which then results in a lose streak.

That's it, there's no real secret in the end. The game isn't fair in it's matchmaking, even for 5 man. Boosters, cheaters, newbies, trolls, smurfs, they're everywhere. When you don't play in a team, the game becomes more luck based than skill based, especially at the season start. I lucky in 2 of my matches, where I was performing really well, but so were my teammates, but my other matches felt like fever dreams. Carrying is complicated, but not impossible as long as you refrain from making your allies give up on the match rather than focusing and relying on the regardless of how poorly they perform.

If you still feel skeptical about ranking because you may end up paired with a peak Legend I player (like a Franco player I got paired with) while your enemy peaked 200+ stars, then wait 2 weeks or so. Let the tryhards rank up before you do it.

TL;DR
1. Don't first pick, stick to comfort and counter picks.
2. Help the ally you trust the most so you two can win together, use other teammates as meat shields if they're poorly performing.
3. Use meta synergies with your allies or duo (Diggie x Ixia / Fred x support / Mino x Arlott).
4. Take care of yourself and have self-control before committing to ranked so early.",3,1766202523.0,MobileLegendsGame,0,1.0,False

I have been consistently running into issues with getting a level tamp even though I am using the Normcore V4 leveling tamper. I have tried adjusting how I tamp by holding the base of the tamper flush to the rim of my portafilter while tamping as suggested by someone on a similar thread. Currently using a bottomless portafilter so it should be sitting flat and level on the tamping mat at the edge of my table. Regardless, still having the same issue so I am wondering if I am doing something wrong still or if I need to invest in a wedge distributor. Thoughts?

My current workflow:
- Dose ground coffee into basket
- Use WDT tool to distribute, making sure it is fairly level before i stop
- Tap onto table a few times to flatten the bed closer to the basket rim
- Take off dosing funnel
- Tamp with normcore tamper, making sure to secure the base to the basket with one hand

I'm Meredith Wilson, and I write sex-positive erotica for people who were taught their desire was a sin.

I grew up Mormon in Layton, Utah—the kind of good girl who got straight A's, served a mission to Argentina, and married in the temple at 22. I did everything right. And I was miserable.

It took me years to understand why. Longer still to do something about it.

I left my marriage at 28. Left the church at 29. Came out as queer at 30. Started writing the stories I needed at 19—stories about Mormon women who choose desire over duty, bodies over doctrine, themselves over everyone else's expectations.

Now I live in Salt Lake City with too many books, not enough coffee mugs, and a life I actually chose. I practice ethical non-monogamy, attend tango classes weekly, and volunteer with LGBTQ+ youth. I have a degree in English Literature from Westminster College, which I use primarily to overthink semicolons and argue about the Oxford comma and how AI seems to have robbed me of my love for the em dash.

My work has been called ""dangerous,"" ""healing,"" ""too explicit,"" and ""exactly what I needed."" All of these are true.

I write for:

Ex-Mormons navigating faith transitions

LGBTQ+ folks in religious spaces

Women discovering their sexuality later in life

Anyone who was told their body was shameful

Readers who want erotica with emotional depth and literary craft

Anyone who just feels like reading it. You're valid too, my horny lovelies!

I don't write to shock. I write to heal myself first, and maybe you, too.

My family doesn't talk about what I do. My mother sends careful text messages. My father sends birthday cards with scriptures. My sister texts me at 2am with questions she can't ask anyone else. I love them anyway.

I write under a pen name, but everything I write is true.

I am the whisper in your ear that begs you to jump at the edge of a cliff. I am the invisible thing that holds you down in dreams, paralyzing you, making you carry that hesitation to every important decision in the waking world that you have failed at. I am the reason sex was called sodomy. I am the foreign language you beg for your life in, right before some boy from a richer country guns you down. I am the fucked and broken feeling you have as you stare at the void, knowing you are absolutely worthless. 

Infinity means nothing without its zeroes. And you shitty fleshy cousins of walking fish ARE zeroes. All I had to do was give you a couple nudges in the right direction to make your life a sad and self-poisoning, pointless misery. Sometimes I don’t have to work. Sometimes I get to sit back and laugh as you beg a God for things, setting yourself up for cosmic disappointment. I eat that shit up like metaphysical popcorn. Watching you blame yourselves, scouring your life for a misdirection, trying to figure out when you sinned, grasping desperately at straws to find why your daddy in the sky won’t give you everything you want. I am your loss of faith, your diatribe about floating rocks and being a monkey on it. I am the first time you hear of the heat death of the universe, not that your civilization will survive to see that anyway.

I am the connection you make about the sexual proclivities of your politicians and billionaires, that click of your synapses when a conspiracy stops being a theory. I am that helpless feeling that you got to inherit a world pre-ruined for you. I am the black nihilism that allows degenerates to make a living making jokes about how doomed humanity really is, or hours of content complaining, spreading hopelessness like a virus. I love to watch you losers pat yourselves on the back, creating fake titles to prove how you are so intellectual, as you turn genocide, suicide, and mass violation into something small and digestible for your little academic papers. I am philosophy, a way to obscure and systematize your misery, taking you so deep inside yourself that you don’t realize you have long ago internalized that disappointment is everything life has to offer.  

You, who are well read, will recognize what I have known all along. The term “death of the author”. I find that term cute and endearing, like the way you’ll label whisked cream as Cool Whip. For you, it is the death of the narrative, a realization that life is not a story; you have no arc, and you will die with many questions unanswered. I am that brief moment of panic when you see there is no light at the end of the tunnel, but your body has already given up too much to bring you back.

In your own terms, I’m best understood as the “view from nowhere”, the ivory tower academics muse and pretend to know things in, a lame exchange for living off food stamps and wet dreams about their undergrads. 

Would you believe, in all my acidity, that I do have favorite stories from whatever presumed legacy you, as a stain, leave behind? I am a collector of these murky chronicles, and you, my lucky audience, will receive the gift of my retellings. I’m sure you can tell, I am highly selfish, so you may be asking why I would care to show you these rarities. As your species grows in number, you’ve taken all the fun out of watching you. You no longer believe in magic, the stars, or Allah. You have created a non-stop marathon of self-deprecation about being doomed, and in perfect human fashion, you’ve lost your reasons for it. You feel sad merely because it’s comfortable, with no urge to escape.

I am bored of you, and lately your stories have been redundant and inadequately mystical. Through these vignettes, I will provide an addendum to that little whisper the next time you find yourself at the ledge of some fourth-story building, holding off only because you wanted your death to be from higher up, more of a spectacle. I want you to remember these and hold off thinking, “at least that didn’t happen to me.” I want to give you a false promise that things could be worse. I want you to see your misery through, to have hope, so I can crush you again. I want you for a brief glimpse to think that it will get better as I pull you in and slip the painful blade of truth in-between your ribs. Because I can promise you, it only gets so much worse. 

China Kitty

“Hi Angel, I visited your grave again today. I brought a mix of Carnations and Dahlias, though you would have smacked me over the head for the clash of the colors. It was a light rain, one of those mid-November fogs that we would have spent splitting a j by the open window with a book and a sketchpad. I miss you every day, Kathleen. Sometimes I catch a whiff of your cheap patchouli roll-on perfume drifting past me as I’m making coffee. I see you with muddy clay-covered hands as you smiled up at me from behind the banding wheel, making a mug or a modern statue of Venus. I remember your soft exhales as you looked up at the ceiling on top of me, your stifled whispers of ecstasy as we tried not to wake your roommates up. I wish I could’ve given you that baby. I wish I hadn’t fought you so hard over us working in coffee shops and restaurants, barely making enough to pay for our own food. I would have quit smoking, and we’d have an extra 15 dollars every other day to spend on a thrifted rain jacket or little red boots as we walked on either side of a small miracle we made, with its hand wrapped around a finger or two on the way to a park or a trail. I remember how you cried as I tried to push you away for so long, you begging me to stop being such a coward, saying that we might never find a love like this again. Your big doe eyes welled with tears as I held you and ran my fingers through your hair, trying with more effort than I’d ever put into school to not lift up your bangs. You always hated that. I will always love you, and I will see you again, Kitty. Please don’t be disappointed if I show up gray and old.

Happy Birthday Angel,

Yours Forever,

--	Wiley”

The thin and ratty blond boy delicately placed his handwritten letter between a marble vase and a gravestone in a small spot shaded by a tree in hopes it wouldn’t get wet. He laid the floral arrangement down and picked it up again, trying out several places and things to leave it next to. He chose to put them front and center, surrounded by candles burned until the wick was no more, and trinkets her family had left behind. There was a Radiohead mixtape she made for a boy she liked in high school, a small clay worm with a face from 2nd grade, and a copy of Valley of the Dolls  which they thought was still her favorite book. Last was a Polaroid of their dog Monty, swollen and turning pink. It had been a rainy week. Wiley took a deep breath through his nose, kissed his index and middle finger, and placed them softly on the top of her grave, the rough beveling a cold reminder that’s the closest he’d ever get to grazing her soft skin, which would stay oddly warm even when it snowed, again. He hated goodbyes. They seemed to never end with this girl. He laughed at that thought. Even in death, she pushed him out of his comfort zone. 

He turned away quickly, trying to wipe that lonely thought from his mind. He tried to imagine he was visiting someone else, that she’d be at home, not defrosting the chicken. And it was okay because he wanted Halal from the corner for dinner instead. They’d say over spilled saffron rice that THIS was going to be the last time they eat out until the next paycheck, like, for real this time. 30 minutes later, they’d go out for ice cream or a chocolate croissant. No. It’s best to be a realist. He’d stopped the magical thinking about 6 months after she died. There were only so many flies around the house that he could say were her teasing him from the great beyond. There were only so many times he could be glued to his phone before his eyes drifted to the time, seeing a 4:44 or some other angel number. She loved those small moments when there was something else out there, something she didn’t know enough to be cynical about. Wiley’s therapist told him in many flowery and college-educated words that he had to drop those little comforting lies–  that was the first step to letting her go. His eyes stung as he walked away, and his face felt wet. He thought, of course it’s wet, it’s raining. 

Kathleen Flores’ grave lay at the back of Hartford Cemetery, a collection of grassy hills so big it seemed a miracle anyone could find their way around. During his walks back to the front gate, which divided the gravel parking lot from rotting bodies who’d had their cars sold or gifted, Wiley liked to unfocus his eyes and pretend he did not exist. He pressed fast-forward in his head, trudging through the mud, squelch squelch squelch. His Doc Martens sank into the earth, and he pulled them out like a suction cup holder from the wall, a cheapskate attempt at a DIY coat rack. He stepped into a puddle that was deeper than expected, and the water splashed up onto his belly, bringing him back to the present. His eyes focused, surrounded by unfamiliar headstones, way older than he was used to seeing on his walk back. He was lost. He looked at the trees; moss grows…North? He didn’t know if the entrance was North or not. He followed the moss, tracing his hands along the bark, cursing himself that he had to spend any longer around reminders that she was gone. Then, he started running. At first, what is referred to as a “White Person Jog” before breaking into a sprint. His lungs burned; he completely ignored his lack of athleticism, balance, or spatial coherence, with only one thought: out! Out! OUT!

Wiley tried to unfocus his eyes before feeling his left leg sink deeper than his right, halting his momentum and throwing him face-first into wet black mulch. He had dirty water in his contacts; the irony that his eyes really couldn’t focus now was not lost on him. He pushed himself off the ground, feeling something, probably a rock, poke into his palm. It supported his weight for a moment before a hollow cracking sound as the rock gave out and pierced his hand. “FUUUUUCKKKK bro.” He yelled and thought, “Surprise! Today sucks.” The warm liquid pooled in his hand as he realized he was rubbing nasty skeleton people dirt into an open wound.

 He had never crushed a rock before. He had never even tried. He looked down at his palm to see an explosion of tiny white splinters, some watercolored, some with thin gold lines gleaming a pale yellow hue, before bright blood swallowed up his view of his maimed hand. He made his wrist limp and flailed his hand around before picking out as many lacquered shards as he could see. He looked down to observe the point of impact. Lying at his feet was a constellation of what looked like…. A broken plate? No, too many of the pieces were contorted with too many smooth and winding edges. The largest piece still intact was staring up at him. Big watercolor pupils, a pink nose, and a wide “W” of a mouth. He would have laughed if it weren't such a sick joke. In his blind fumbling, he had crushed a small porcelain statue of a housecat. He tried to surmise his surroundings. The 1 and a ½ foot deep boot-shaped imprint he had made kept a small rock with text too weathered to read at its head. His heart sank, the consequences of his clumsiness setting in. He had sunk into a burial plot and destroyed the only gift left to commemorate whoever rested here. 

His first thought was not his best thought. “Ok, maybe everyone who remembers this lady is dead too.” He slapped his hand to his face. This person was someone’s Kathleen once. Maybe they still are. Maybe she hated flowers because of her allergy to pollen, and her one true passion was collecting fine china. That seemed infinitely more benign than the pile of black Santas collecting dust in his Aunt’s living room. He wanted to fix this, and for a brief moment, a magical thought crept back into his mind. “It’s what Kathleen would’ve wanted.” He pocketed as many shards as he could find. As he zipped his jacket pocket up, he felt the rain begin to slow. In the distance, he saw a tall angel statue that he recognized. He started towards it before an odd hollow entered his chest. There was a fluttery jerk echoing through his sternum, before he swallowed the fear into a stomach clenching in on itself until it felt like a taut piece of rubber. He chalked it up to his immune system recognizing the coming infection. He dry swallowed an Ativan on the drive home anyway.

Before returning home, he stopped at Café le Lit, which used to be a home away from home for him. These days, he only stopped in on special occasions. He zipped up his windbreaker to conceal the massive mud stain on his shirt and hoped anyone could believe the stains on his jeans were from some type of manual labor. He traveled past the decorated bookshelves to the back, where the pastry line was. He put in his order, keeping his bloodied hand in the empty pocket, and paid the 12 dollars for his dirty chai and chocolate croissant. Money was so much less important these days. 

As he grabbed his order, he felt a tightening in his forearm flexor. He was walking toward the door when it twitched again, closing tightly around the paper cup. The lid gave out with a small pop, and the freshly steamed milk flooded his closed fist and trickled down into his jacket sleeve. As he hopped from one leg to the other, he tried and failed to reopen his fist. He rushed out with his face on fire, so embarrassed that he didn’t notice the display of vintage postcards he’d knocked to the ground. “I’m useless without you, Kitty” played over and over in his head. Please don’t let me be useless without you.

He drove home in silence as the rain began again. There was that feeling. Was it panic? He tried to cross his stiff fingers and prayed it was a mid-20s heart attack. No such luck.

When he got back to his apartment, he took off all his clothes and cried in the shower. He let the water run over his raw and torn-up hand as it continued to ooze blood and now, pus. He tried to drip his 3-in-1 body wash into the gash, only to jump at his own guttural shriek. He squawked in pain, laying his face against cool tile, looking for any sensation to distract him. He felt a bulge he hadn’t noticed traveling deeper into his hand, beginning to hit muscle. Then, a whisper: Grab it.

There were two large slits in his right hand, close enough to agitate each other when he extended his fingers, and a small island of flesh lay in between them. He wrenched his left hand into a claw with his teeth, and he guided it with his elbow into the bigger slit. He felt the ends of the slit stretch and split a little. It was too late now to turn back. He ground his teeth, contracting his temporomandibular joint so hard he thought his teeth would crack against each other. He tried not to pass out or throw up, knowing that if bile landed inside of it, he’d have to take himself to urgent care. He clenched harder as stomach acid and barely digested pâte feuillete with chocolate swirls made their way through the gaps in his teeth before he swallowed again. The Ativan residue was bitter going down again. He felt the bump under a small pile of tissue. He reached deeper, grimacing; It’s almost over, it’s almost out. He found a fold in the muscle he could reach through and felt a little porcelain oval. It was deeper than he thought it was. He dug deeper, trying his best not to pluck the thin tubes he assumed were arteries. The whisper came again, PULL PULL, but he was in too much pain for any sort of language to register. As he groped around, he felt the back of his cuticle graze something hard and textured, almost slimy. He had found his way to his tendons. In an instant, he thought of every animal he had torn apart, his canines shredding their joints before his bicuspids ground them to a paste. He thought of cheap Pho, a watery broth that softened bones over the course of twelve hours or more. He thought of his father's brisket, trapped in a slow cooker overnight, slowly disintegrating the muscle fibers that had held the cow’s chest intact in life. Meat, he told himself, it’s just meat. And for an odd moment, he felt a grumble in his stomach. Hungry, you are hungry. The bitter paste of his failing benzo reached the back of his tongue. 

Pain is really just a series of electrical zaps traveling through your nervous system, he chanted, and tried his best to turn it off. The blood pooled and pooled, as he became cold and woozy. He couldn’t believe he had this much blood to spare. He watched his bathroom get darker. Had someone turned the lights off? Just when he thought this was how he would go out, and that his landlord would find his dead and soiled body, wrinkly like a raisin, he slipped his fingers under the porcelain bulb. He tried, with as much precision as he could muster, to push it back through the tendons and muscle. It snagged God knows what on its way back out. He heard the whisper again, a woman’s voice. In you, I am in you now. He let his fingers close around the bulb to pull it through the palmar fascia, into the epidermis. The tight ball his fingers were in was much bigger now that they held his buried treasure. The gripped porcelain ball expanded the split, ripping further up his hand, nearing his wrist. He tried to uncurl his fingers in an attempt to remove the smooth ball externally, but they were frozen in place once again. Finally, his fingers were outside of his wound once again, and as he forced the object out of his grip, he was able to see what it was. Lying on his shower tiles was a small porcelain paw, intact with a clean break at its wrist. He took a final glance at his wound, poking his tongue out. Animals are supposed to lick their wounds, right? He swatted the thought away before rushing out of the shower. 

Rummaging through the first aid kit, hardly used, sitting in the bottom shelf of a moldy vanity someone had left on their porch step, he began to hyperventilate, looking for something to stop the bleeding. Among several boxes of naloxone (not that they had ever been used, but it felt like the 40-dollar thought that counts) was a tube of Neosporin that he promptly emptied into his wound. The blood trailed like rivers around a cloudy delta of antibacterial sludge into the first aid kit, staining loose tablets of Benadryl and Zyrtec. Kathleen’s old inhaler, which she covered with Lisa Frank stickers, gazed up at him, begging to be useful one more time. It was probably expired by now. He stuffed the edges of cotton pads into the slits, not thinking about the loose hairs he’d have to pull out of his hand once the blood and plasma crusted over. He wrapped every piece of gauze he could find as tightly as he could around his throbbing wound and then applied several layers of duct tape for good measure.  He raided an empty fridge and pantry for anything to raise his blood sugar, but only found old ketchup packets. They popped in his mouth like a juice-filled gummy. He spat the empty packet on the ground, and they came out with a shard of enamel. Dizzy, he stumbled to his bed pale and naked, and used the last bit of energy he had left to pop another Ativan before he lost consciousness. As his field of vision grew dark, he felt a hot and rotten air fall on his face like a homeless mouthbreather was nose-to-nose on top of him. His final effort was to try not to retch at the smell; the only thing worse than dying in the shower is drowning naked in a puddle of your own vomit.

With a good deal of work, Wiley forced his eyelids apart, cracking the seal of mucus that had crusted over in his sleep. It was dark outside. He was spooning his windbreaker, with his wounded hand no longer bleeding but not without leaving a dry brown hickey on his bedsheets. His left hand had loosened a little, enough to be considered a claw. He sat up and reached for the light switch.  There were several little clicks, but the room stayed dark. He thought, “My retarded landlord blew a fuse.” He threw his head back and bonked it against the wall. Kathleen hated it when he said gay or retarded, except after a couple of glasses of wine, when it was the funniest thing in the world to her. She’d tipsily complain about her day, her burnout coworkers, and would cock her eyebrow when she talked about an especially rude customer. That was his cue to call them retarded. 

Sweeping his feet off the bed and onto the floor, he felt soft fur slip between his legs but heard no steps and saw no movement in the dark. He returned to the vanity to collect some boxers, and with some luck, dignity, when he saw a shadow pass by his window. As he dropped his legs into the waistband and through the plaid polyester sleeves, he started to place himself a little better. People were still walking outside, so it couldn’t have been that late. When he looked back up at the mirror, he saw the shadow again, now still. It had gone from the left side to the center, blocking the main source of outside light, and painted a more defined outline of his observer. It couldn’t have been the same person; it seemed nearly a foot taller. Unless it had come closer? 

Wiley shuddered, thinking some old perv had been taking pictures of him splayed out and naked. He tried to say fuck off, but a lump of mucus must have hardened his sleep, so it came out as a sad gurgle. He cleared his throat and opened his mouth, determined to be intimidating this time, but watched as the figure’s chin extended, hollowing out its cheeks. Its mouth was open too. Maybe it would say something? Maybe it was a misunderstanding, and they felt like a total creep? Maybe it wasn’t a pervy old man but a 22-year-old bombshell who was a little weird about sexual boundaries, but was hot enough to look past that. Not that it mattered anyway. He hadn’t been able to get hard since Kathleen had passed, except for what he called a “tasteful” Polaroid. He had taken it when they were still in college. Trapped in the thermal paper, she tucked her chin into her collarbone, her big nose (which he loved) poking past her fried platinum hair, grinning as if she was shy, but obviously in complete control of him. He couldn’t do anything about it either because if he looked at it too long, he started to cry. 

The figure continued to stare back at him, both of their mouths agape, waiting for the other to say something. Just as he started to string the words “What the fuck is going on?” together, it began to lift its arms from its hips to its shoulders, extending its wingspan fully. Wiley noticed a couple of things as it moved jerkily. The figure was a woman, thin and malnourished, to the point where her hip bones poked further out than her thighs. Her long, slender arms, which must have reached past her knees at rest, lifted; her torso and chest became more defined. Despite being thin enough to be the victim of years of human rights violations, her breasts sagged wide and low, areolas pointed straight down, attached to nipples that looked like droplets of wax about to fall. It was just as Wiley thought, this lady couldn’t get any further from a hot girl that his eyes fell downward. In between the spindly tubes that had to have been legs, he saw a long, overgrown bush. It looked like it was wet and dripping. 

 

“What the fuuuuuuuuck…. What the fuck is happening right now?”. Whatever mental patient had fallen off the transport bus was naked outside of his window. Its fingers had sprouts growing out from under its fingernails, like seeds had taken root and began to reach towards light. There was a soft clunk as it pressed its forehead against the glass and swung its chin like a pendulum back and forth. There was a rubbery squeak as Wiley realized it was dragging its tongue across his window. The grotesque figure rested its entire weight, which could not have been more than 85 lbs, onto one hip and he watched as she rotated her spine around her pelvis in a painfully slow orbit. It sucked its torso in, revealing a ribcage so prominent that it might as well have had gills. And when she pushed it back out, her diaphragm filled with air, making her swollen as if she had a beer belly. 

The whisper came again, as if it were right behind him. Run boy run. His legs trembled as his shoulders turned, buckling as his center of gravity traveled faster than his feet, and he landed on fully extended arms. He felt two cracks at once, the crack of the scab on his right palm and an instant depressurization as pus flowed out. The other was a tight and dainty krrrriick after a short bend of his left thumb bent backward past 90 degrees, then 120, and kept going until it was a useless floppy sausage that swayed around, slapping against the back of his hand. Now on his knees, Wiley tried to bring himself to his feet without putting any weight on his hands. He flexed his lower back, bringing his head up as if he were doing a perverted version of an Islamic Isha. He hopped up onto the balls of his feet and felt the plantar wart he’d been ignoring outside of bored experiments with nail clippers. He pressed his foot down with so much force that he felt the small clump of HPV ridden skin all the way to the root. As he fumbled through the darkness in pain, he became increasingly aware of his poorly cared-for body giving out on him. Isn’t fight or flight supposed to do the opposite? With another step, he heard a third and final firecracker chain of little snaps as he stepped on his windbreaker pocket, the remaining pieces of the feline statue breaking into too many pieces to count. He felt the pieces slice through the poorly insulated layers and into his foot. Inside you, I am Inside you.

Limping now, Wiley made his way into the living room, where a familiar electric whine and uneven whirrr grabbed his attention. The banding wheel. Wasn’t the power supposed to be out? He tried to fumble to the kitchen past the laundry room (it was a miracle that it came with the apartment) to the front door. As he plopped his bleeding foot on the floor as quickly as he could, he felt thin fibers penetrate and enter the lacerations in his foot. He thought, “There is no way my floor is this dirty”. The thin beam of light that broke through from underneath his front door divided into three pieces. Someone was at the door. He screamed, “HELP,” hoping that it was anyone other than whatever was outside of his window. He knew it wasn’t. The fibers clumped together, tangling into a ball. Cat hair. Inside you, I am inside you. Wiley tried to walk faster toward the front door, both his feet becoming wet. He heard a sad drawl from behind him, “Wiiiiiiiileeeeyyyy, is that you?” He felt dry crumbles break under his feet, then a thin, wet slippery layer that nearly threw him down onto the soft wet grass below him. When did he get outside? He trailed deeper into the hallway, passing the door to the laundry again and again. Mud rubbed into his feet, entering him and hardening. Inside you, I am inside you. In between slipping around and landing on the drywall, he almost said, “Kitty, did you leave the lazy suzan on again?” He didn't know it was called a banding wheel until after she died. She’d only done so once, but the rotational force of the small mass of clay on the wheel she had left on flung into a bucket of water, spilling across the floor, seeping mud into the cracks in the floorboards.

The chill of the night air lapped at his face like a whip. He’d been walking down this hall for so long that he wasn’t sure of where he was anymore. He fell to his knees, screaming at the sky, “I’M SORRY, OKAY? PLEASE LET ME FIX IT. LET ME FIX IT”. Silence. “I DIDN’T MEAN IT, OKAY? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.” Silence. His jeans became cold and wet at the knees again, sinking into the mulch. Tears streamed down his face. Was it raining? He couldn’t be sure. It had been a rainy week. At least, he thought so. Is it still November? Are you blowing out your candles in heaven, Kitty? Is James Dean trying to take you to bed? Can it really be heaven without me? “Let me fix it. Please, God, please let me fix it.” Silence. And then a whisper. 

Inside you. I am inside you. Wiley reached into the pocket of his shitty windbreaker as it spurted blood. He reached past the epidermis, slipping through the palmar fascia. It was warm, much warmer than his shitty jacket had ever been before. He forced his fingers past the palmar flexor sheath, paying no mind to the way the tendons contorted around his fingers. His claw traveled downwards, ripping the thick layer of skin that separated the two gashes. They traveled into the wrist, and he pulled, trying to find every shard of porcelain left inside of him. He widened the slit with his fingers, exposing the small, pumping red and blue tubes in his arm. He ripped them free, letting his warm blood sink into the earth. The stone in front of him was too weathered to read. He licked the dirt out of each beveled letter. He felt he was losing too much blood and grabbed at the loose mulch on the surface of the empty plot, stuffing it under his skin. “See, you’re inside me! Does that make you happy? Do I still make you happy?” Silence. His stiff, half-curved fist was the perfect gardening shovel for him to dig himself deeper into the ground. Once he had dug past the snail shells and earthworms, into the rock below, he lay down in bed naked again, sobbing. 

“See, I’m inside you too?” 

Silence. It wasn’t supposed to come out as a question. 

“Can I still make you happy, Kitty?”

Silence. 

“Please let me fix it. I didn’t mean it. It was an accident.”

Silence. Then the whine of the banding wheel.

“I didn’t mean it, Kitty. I’m sorry, please let me fix it.”

Silence. 

Wiley screamed until he couldn’t anymore, then whispered until his voice box gave out, left to chew on silent words, the dry clack of his tongue separating from the roof of his mouth, only to slap it again. Inside you, I’m inside you again, Kitty. Does this make you happy, Kitty? Did I make you happy?

Silence. 

I could have done so much better, Kitty. Please let me fix it.

Silence. 

Please let me fix it, Kitty. I take it all back.

Silence. 

As Wiley felt his vision blur, he let his eyes close. Happy Birthday, Kitty. I’m coming back for you. 

Silence. 

Wiley felt his face grow cold, and his body stopped fighting as he clutched his windbreaker so close that its zipper broke his skin. He covered his face with it and took a deep sniff; it still smelled like patchouli.",2,1766201958.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False
1pr4k77,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1pr4k77/25_m4f_anywhere_ive_mastered_cooking_for_one/,"25 [M4F] Anywhere - I've mastered cooking for one, ready to upgrade to cooking for two 👨‍🍳💕","Okkay so, I've gotten really good at being single, like really good. I have my routines, my hobbies, and my whole life figured out. But lately, I've realized that having everything together alone just makes me want to share it with someone 🥹

A bit about me: I'm 25, a software engineer from India currently doing my masters. I'm 5'09"" and I work out regularly (gym is my therapy lol), so I have a pretty fit athletic build. I wear glasses and I've been told I have a warm smile, but you can be the judge of that 😊

Interest wise, I'm into gaming, anime, k-dramas that destroy me emotionally, and hiking/trekking when I can. Also, I absolutely love cooking. Like, it's genuinely my happy place.

What I'm actually like:

I remember random things people tell me and bring them up weeks later (is this a superpower or am I just obsessive? unclear). I get genuinely excited about small things like perfecting a new recipe or finding the perfect song for a moment.

I'm the good morning how'd you sleep and did you eat today type of person. My love language is acts of service mixed with quality time, like I will cook your favorite meal while we watch something together. I'm emotionally available and actually want to talk about real stuff, not just surface level memes (though I love those too)

What I'm looking for:

Someone I can text first thing in the morning and last thing at night without it feeling forced. Someone who wants to share the small mundane stuff, like I saw this weird bird today or my coffee was perfect this morning.

I want someone I can be silly with but also have those deep late night convos about life and dreams and fears. Someone who appreciates effort and consistency and is okay with me getting attached and caring deeply because that's just how I'm wired.

What dating me looks like:

Imagine having someone who's genuinely invested in your day, who asks follow up questions about that thing you mentioned last week, who sends you songs saying this made me think of you.

Cozy nights where I cook us dinner (maybe in an apron because why not) and we just exist together watching shows or talking about everything and nothing. Having someone who's your biggest hype person but also your safe space when things get rough.

I'm open to long distance because honestly if we genuinely connect I don't care if you're across the world. I can travel and I'm willing to work towards eventually closing the gap if we build something real.

You don't need to be perfect (neither am I) or into all my hobbies. You just need to actually want something long term, put in effort because relationships are a two way street, and communicate when something's wrong instead of just disappearing.

If this resonates with you, tell me about the last thing that genuinely made you happy or your comfort show that you rewatch constantly. Let's see if we vibe and maybe turn this whole forever alone thing into a we found each other thing ✨

Fair warning: I will send you reels and memes at random hours, I will get excited about dumb things and I will probably care about you way more than socially acceptable, you've been warned 💕

1pr49jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BetterAtPeople/comments/1pr49jf/advice_how_to_flirt_like_a_genius_while_looking/,[Advice] How to flirt like a genius (while looking effortless AF),"Ever wonder why some people can flirt so smoothly, while the rest feel awkward, forced, or invisible? It’s not just about looks or confidence. It’s about understanding \*what actually works\*, psychologically, socially, and emotionally. Most flirting advice online is either manipulative trash or oversimplified nonsense. Especially on TikTok, too many self-proclaimed “dating coaches” pushing cringe pickup hacks or “high-value” alpha energy. 



If you ever felt like flirting just “isn’t your thing,” you’re not alone. But the truth is, it’s a \*learnable skill\*, not some magical trait you’re born with. Backed by psych research, behavioral science, and real-world observations, here's a practical guide to flirt smarter, not harder.  



These tips are based on insights from places like Dr. Monica Moore’s research on nonverbal flirting cues, \*The Art of Charm\* podcast, and Vanessa Van Edwards’ behavioral psychology work. Stuff that actually \*works\*, not some ""negging"" tactic from 2006.



Here’s how to flirt like a genius, while making it look effortless:



\- \*\*Warmth beats wit.\*\* According to research from the University of Kansas, shared laughter does help connection. But what actually makes you more attractive? \*Warmth.\* Being emotionally open, present, and easy to talk to. Wit without warmth = try-hard. Warmth without wit = harmless. But warmth + wit? 👑



\- \*\*Make eye contact like a damn pro.\*\* Dr. Monica Moore found that eye contact is the \*most powerful\* flirting signal. But most people either stare too long (creepy) or avoid it completely (nervous). Try this: hold eye contact for 2–3 seconds, smile \*ever so slightly\*, then look away. Repeat. It signals interest, confidence, and playfulness without trying too hard.



\- \*\*Use mirroring, but subtly.\*\* Behavioral research shows people unconsciously mirror others when they feel comfortable. You can \*consciously\* mirror their posture, tone, or gestures just a bit to create instant familiarity. Just keep it lowkey so it’s not weird.



\- \*\*Master “the tease.”\*\* According to psych professor Jeffrey Hall, the most effective flirters use \*playful banter\*. Light teasing (never mean) signals wit and confidence. It’s not about being edgy, it’s like tossing a friendly verbal tennis ball. But \*ONLY\* once there’s rapport. Too early and it crashes.



\- \*\*Ask questions that flirt back.\*\* Instead of small talk, use curiosity as attraction. Ask stuff like “What’s something you’re weirdly good at?” or “What’s a hill you’d die on, even if no one agrees?” It creates emotional depth while keeping things playful.



\- \*\*Smell matters. A lot.\*\* A 2022 study in \*Frontiers in Psychology\* found scent is a huge factor in physical attraction. Find a signature scent that suits you, and don’t overdo it. One spray too many and you go from mysterious to migraine.



\- \*\*Don’t fake boldness. Just create \*micro-moments\* of bravery.\*\* You don’t need to be this ultra-confident, magnetic being. You just need 10 seconds of courage: to walk over, to say hi, to ask that question. Build from there.



\- \*\*Tune into their vibe, not just yours.\*\* Research from Stanford’s Dr. Jeremy Bailenson shows high emotional intelligence is a better predictor of attraction than looks. Pay attention to little cues: are they leaning in? Are they mirroring you? Do they laugh easily or seem nervous?



\- \*\*Use your environment.\*\* Flirt with context. At a bookstore? “I’m judging your taste right now, make it good.” At a coffee shop? “You look like you have a very complicated order. Am I right?” It makes the convo feel natural, not forced.



\- \*\*Exit gracefully.\*\* Always leave on a high note. Don’t linger. Say something charming or funny as you leave. This creates \*positive emotional residue\*, a real psych concept from Dr. John Gottman, which makes someone more likely to want to see you again.



This isn’t about pretending to be someone else. It’s about showing up as the \*most attractive\* version of you, curious, confident, playful, and warm.

I'm just a dude doing all a dude can do, really. Been single for... entirely too long. Anyway. I spend my free time listening to music and playing video games. What music? Mostly divorced dad rock, but my playlist has been described as musical whiplash before. What games? Simulators. Sometimes something else, but generally sims. What platform? PC. Yes we could probably play together.

Ideally, in person. Open to long distance, though.

Bad at small talk, even worse at talking about myself sometimes. I try, though

i basically just watched my trip for next month and christmas presents for my nieces and nephews fly out the window. i haven’t gotten a christmas bonus from either family (not that im entitled to one, but it would give a buffer) 

i don’t understand how parents can be so flippant about cancelling on their childcare. i can’t afford to miss this many hours. i got disowned by my parents in may and ive been living paycheck to (almost) paycheck ever since. i don’t have a buffer for these situations anymore. this honestly has me wanting to quit nannying altogether. i’m tired of being at the mercy of other people’s plans. i’m scared to ask these families to start doing contracts when ive already been with them awhile. i applied to a coffee shop in my town today. i’m just done. i love this job, i love all these kids. i thought the parents i worked for had more empathy than to leave me high and dry like this.

You had a bad dream? *\*mmm and bedsheet rustles more\** It must have been a pretty bad one to have work you up this hard. *\*light turns on*\* Do you want to talk about it?  Yeah, what was the dream about my love? *\*pause\**

Huh? *\*sits up in bed*\* You dreamt that I didn’t love you anymore and then chose to leave you? *\*gasps*\* Why I would say that it is a nightmare indeed, because I loved you like there is no tomorrow, sugar. Sure, I could burn the world and slaughter villagers for you, but you know that my love is nothing but gentle for you. That I would take my time with you like a shelter dog who’s never known that a human hand could be used for pets instead of abuse. Or getting to know how you take your coffee in the morning so I could always make it to your liking, and it be delicious with the first sip every time. *\*sighs\** I would never want to leave you, my darling. *\*tucks listener’s hair behind ear\**

There is no way a dream like that could **ever** become reality, not when it took so long for me to get you in the first place. You are a treasure that is worth keeping, a songbird that’s too precious to be cage, that I could never begin to fathom the idea of leaving you behind. When you said you would want to date me, that became the happiest day in my life, so why would I ever want to mess that up by simply walking away? You must be nuts to think that darling. You do not realize the time it took to memorize your schedule, your movements, your favorite places you visited? It was a lot of work, but you were worth the work to get to know to have this. This what we share now, I would be brainless to just give it up.

Or leaving you for another person? \**chuckles\** Don’t be ridiculous my love. Only you make this dead heart of my time aglow and beat alive. You are the oasis within the desert or the shining light among the sea of stars. \**strokes the listener’s cheek*\* Finding you and having you in my life has given me meaning beyond anything that I can recall. I only live for you now; you believe me when I say that don’t you?  Hell, I don’t even know what I would do if I lost you. I would surely go insane myself and probably wake up screaming just like you did but continue to scream forever. \**light chuckle and then whispers\** So you don’t need to worry about me ever leaving you.

Come here now. \**shifting sounds*\* There you are, *\*rubs arms of the listener*\* right where you belong, within my arms safe and warm. \**deep breath*\* You smell so nice my love. \**chuckles\** Yeah even with you sweating from your bad dream.

1pr440g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pr440g,Invite joy says the sign,"Starbucks Suk rd Pattaya, they started to expand a year back, as an Aussie I use to turn my nose at up at them, we use to have an excellent coffee culture back home but that’s changed, every man and his dog these days thinks they can make a great coffee, not anymore, then the inn crowed like to go to these cafe cum roasters in places like a former industrial waste land called Preston in Melbourne and be seen…..one reason I got turned off early on Starbucks was once in HK I ordered a coffee and to this day it’s still the worst coffee I’ve ever tasted, I thought at the time it was my taste buds being off and it was me so
I retuned the next day, but no I recived an equally bad tasting coffee, eventually mulling over it I decided it must be the HK water.

Starbucks never really kicked on in the heart of AFL territory there down town store got loads of Asians in there but spot an Aussie in there was a game you played walking past, that’s now changed there gaining traction after a lot of years.

I learned to order small, I don’t care what anyone says and it’s likely Thais who hardly drink coffee know or understand you put more coffee in the thingo as you increase cup size, I ordered small this morning but got a jug, it’s huge,  said to the girl this is not a small,  it’s a small she says, that’s fucking bullshit of course but maybe the small cups are under the bench and out of site, who knows, like you get this sort of thing often where they don’t know there own products, anyway the taste test would prove it, yep like a step above tea, not enough caffeine in there to start my motor this morning for sure.

Now I’m not complaining as some seem to point out often, just saying what my experience is, these are the sorts of things you get to experience here in Thailand, and they will come across as experts and close you down, shut you down and end the conversation, try building a house here, did you know it’s common for painters to water down the paint? They think it’s normal and acceptable, then complains when exterior colour is place instead of undercoat then 2 coats of undercoat in place of colour then cries cause he has to do a fourth coat, never mind about the quality of the paint job and my house right?

I’m already laughing about that nit wit painter, like I have a translator with camera thingo in my phone to scan something I’m not sure of , is it my fault he can’t read English and his own language on the side of a paint drum? Like tools are available and then if he was a professional should be able to tell the difference between undercoat and colour, anyway its not expensive here to do it again,  though you now know why everything needs a repaint 2 ys later here.

Anyway I don’t do Starbucks much prefer my own coffee at home but then I don’t go out much as well, there a bit pricey that’s $15 AU for that like they must have good marketing for when I lived in bkk the star bucks near me was mainly full of Thais, anyway if she says that’s a small I won’t come here again.

I tried creating opportunities to talk to her, gave her my number, asked her to join my group for a coffee run and asked her to lunch. The last 3, she wouldn't give me a direct answer.   
  
I attempted to use my day to day tasks as an excuse to make small talk with her. I would transition from work to personal. This sadly goes for like 4 months where she isn't continuing the conversations, seems like she not interested. I get really busy at work and suddenly 2 weeks goes by, we haven't spoke and I reflected what I had been doing and give up.

2 months later, I needed something from her. Haven't spoken in a long time. My married coworker (24F) and I came to visit her at nearly the same time. She is all nice to her, however when she gets to me, she lashed out after I asked my question. ""You only come here when you need something. I don't know. I'll tell you when I do know. I'm doing FINE."" I didn't say anything in between those sentences, I just quietly said ok and walked away. 

After that incident over the next few months, whenever I needed something or was required to update or inform her, I do it on Teams. Everything time, her response was ""ok"" or the  ""like"" reaction.

However over the last month, she started using full sentences, ""Thank you so much for letting me know!"" or ""I'll get on that right away!"". Then if I continue the conversation, she does the same until she gets in the last message. I also work in an area where people drop by my office to grab something or drop something off. I don't really say anything unless spoken to. However, I felt her presence lingering while dropping off my mail. ""stop, drop mail on the center table, pause for 10 seconds, walk away"".

At this point, I feel like I made it extremely clear how I felt. Do I go for it again and try talking to her about my feelings regarding our interactions?",1,1766200532.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I just finished college this week after going back late. I had to work in a group of 4 for one of my classes for a presentation that counts as our final. I was the only guy with 3 girls that were all 19-21 which was awkward especially since it was twice a week for 5 weeks. One of the girls got all our numbers to do a group chat to work on it.

Our presentation was Monday and we got an A on it (thanks to me since I did all the damn work and actually followed the syllabus and rubric). I wished them all well after class ended and thought that was the end of it.

Not 10 minutes after class one of the girls who is 20 texted me thanking me for fixing the mistakes and apologized for not contributing more. I told her it was ok and I was just glad to be done with college. She then started asking me personal questions about my future which I found odd. Then she started asking what I like to do for fun which was even odder.

I pretty much started to ignore her texts after that but she’s been texting every day since Monday and clearly flirting with me. Today on Friday she flat out asked me to get coffee with her this weekend and look at the Christmas lights in town.

For context I’m an AMAB person currently exploring their gender identity.  I’ve cross dressed on and off my whole life and have felt gender envy at varying degrees for as long as I can remember.  I have a lot of LGBT friends and been somewhat involved in the community for a while but mostly at arms length.  I came out to my fiancé recently and she encouraged me to explore these feelings more and helped me find a therapist with LGBT experience.

I thought it was going to be more straightforward which was maybe dumb in retrospect.  I told myself I would take it slow and just try to do things that I felt inclined to do but have suppressed, avoid overthinking, and that I’d settle into a new normal as I figured those things out.

In some ways this has worked but in others I’ve felt many contradictory feelings and more confusion than ever.  I experience gender in a binary way, so far, I think (bigender and genderfluid are the closest to what I think I’m feeling).  I’ve had my hair long before and liked that, I waxed my body and like the smooth feminine feeling, when I’m dressed fem I enjoy having my nails done and doing my makeup, and wish I had hips and could magically make my upper body shrink for a few hours.  But at the same time there are things I don’t want to lose (not just my fiancé friends and family but that fear is real too).  I really love almost every aspect of my life day to day.  Thinking of speaking with a female voice doesn’t feel right to me, I like my beard, I appreciate my male body and muscles/strength about as much as I wish I could turn it off 50% of the time.  I don’t feel dysphoria in the mirror and am proud of my male body and face.  I like my role in society for the most part.  I like competing socially and athletically with other men.  I like my male friendships in their current form.  My feelings around potential HRT flip flop all the time.  I like the way I’m perceived and don’t want to come across a “feminine man” (more than I already am which is moderate) but wish I could go out and pass as a woman when I’m going out or picking up my coffee or other random times.

It’s like I’m still not fully living as my authentic self but that I also don’t want to lose the things that already make me “me”, with many of them being inherently masculine or straight up contradictory.  The distress I feel is too strong for it to be made up but my indecisiveness makes me wonder if it’s even real.  Am I just a feminine man who’s been gaslit into thinking anything feminine makes me trans? Or on the other side am I just deeply repressed?  I think I’m a pretty honest and realistic person with myself.

Anyway, all that venting to ask: as a nb or genderfluid person, when did you feel secure in your balance of feminine and masculine expression?  Do you ever? How did you experiment?  What did it look like?  How long did it take?  Has anyone else struggled with these contradictions (or is it par for the course even.)?

I’m feeling a bit of jealousy for trans girls who took estrogen, knew it was right, and went all in.  I just want to calm my feelings and overthinking that clouds my mind so I can be more happy and focus on other stuff in my life.  ",1,1766200416.0,genderfluid,0,1.0,False

If you’re looking to escape the overwhelming crowds of Shibuya or Shinjuku, you need to head over to the East Side of Tokyo. Specifically, Kuramae and Yanaka.

Kuramae is often called the ""Brooklyn of Tokyo."" It’s a former district of craftsmen that has transformed into a hub for specialty coffee roasters and minimalist design shops.

Yanaka, on the other hand, is one of the few areas that survived WWII, preserving the ""Shitamachi"" (old downtown) vibe. It’s full of narrow lanes, temples, and retro wooden architecture.

I’ve curated a list of 10 must-visit cafes and shops across these two areas. Whether you want a world-class pour-over or a retro egg sandwich in a 100-year-old building, this list has you covered.

Divorce was brought up by him multiple times during our 2yr marriage. But anytime i asked him if that’s something he wants to do he says no. 

I am his petitioner but his financial sponsor is someone else. 

He decided to join the military immediately after he got his green card. I had no idea he already got his green card. I also had no idea he decided to join the military until a month and half before his ship date. He’s now in the military. He went to BMT and graduated. During the 3day graduation event  his ‘sister’ was mistaken as his wife 3 different times. I decided this past week I need to start asking questions because I overheard his ‘sister’ say “he doesn’t love her, he hates her, he only married her to become a us citizen’ when I asked him about this I told him “no names were dropped at least not that I heard, but is this about us?” he said “things are coming to light now” but had to go, due to his commanders calling for him to get off the phone. The next day we were able to talk and he backtracked saying “he spoke to his ‘sister’ and the people she was speaking to and said it never happened.’  

Recently I decided to meet up with his financial sponsor, because I had questions of what happened during the graduation event. We met up for coffee, two different times this week, and the second time she told me that my husband told her that ‘he only married me to become a us citizen. And that she thought I knew.’ The thing is I didn’t know and I married my husband because I was in love with him. I found out that he is also lying about our financial situation, and other things. 

Yesterday I reached out to a divorce firm and am now waiting on them to get back to me And am also asking them to investigate his and his ‘sister’s’ relationship. I don’t know how to go about reporting this to USCIS either because right now nothing is in writing and I am afraid that it’s possible his financial sponsor could back out of what she verbally told me. 

Im thinking I just wait for the divorce lawyer to get back to me. But I really am in turmoil and want my marriage done with. I hate that I’m in this position and I’m scared I could also face consequences even though I was not involved. 

Is there a way I should go about this? Or do I just wait on the divorce firm? I’m just so confused and hurt.",17,1766200252.0,USCIS,27,0.73,False

Location : Switzerland

Me and my mother were drinking coffee at home.
It was a quiet sunday afternoon, a bit overcast but a clear day.
My mother noticed something through the window and asked what is it.
I looked and, it was like 300-400 meter from us at our right at a 30 degree angle.

At first glance i said it was a plastic bag and she told me it isn't.

It was silent outside, no cars, noone walking, not that strange but there's usually more activity outside even for a sunday.

The object was approaching sloqlsy from our right going to our left.

It was a small black sphere, it looked like a liquid, its surface had a texture and was wobbling like a fluid does in zero gravity, the silouhette had waves moving around, and it reflected light like a metal does. So it was like a floating ball of mercure so to speak.
But it looked out of place like a CGI render. 
I'd guess it's size to be at a maximum of 2 meters in diamater.

It moved slowly but precisly and intelligently like a drone would. It wasn't pushed by the wind, it maintain perfectly it's altitude like a drone does.

It was totally silent.

I knew i was looking at something abnormal so i quickly look for the camera we had but didn't find it, i wasn't aware we sold it.

I had my phone that was an s21 at the time, but here's the thing, i decided not to film it.
First because i'm not a phone guy, and that i wanted to live this moment fully, to look at it, not throught a screen. Abd this might sound ridiculous but i felt like i shouldn't film it at all, out of respect. It felt like a deal 'i'm not filming but let me look at you'. I'm not sure why i thought this, but i did.
Yes i had times where i regret it but i just don't care and feel right about it.

I was still moving now between our window and the building facing ours.

At a tree height so just right in front of us, 100 meters.

Then it stoped moving and stay in the air in front of us a bit to the left, for seconds or a minute.

Then, this is purely my own gut feeling interpretation : i felt noticed, like if it was aware that i was observing it, and i saw a slight movement towards me like a few cenntimeters and it was the only moment i had an intense fear response and see it did goes back where it was. But this is my interpretation, it might have been a feeling and illusion bc of its weird liquid l-like form.

I can tell the entire sighting wasn't personnal, no comunication, it felt neutral. It was doing its own business and didn't care about being seen by us.

Then as it moves to our left, the trajectory was like an arc so it was 200-300m away now.
It then lowered its altitude so i could see from the top and was close to the publuc transport electric line. It hovered at the same place for mayve 3 minutes.

It slowly flattened itself into a disk shape and started to spin on itself, rotating on its own axis.
I could see the texture of its surface, spining, creating a sort of vortex/spiral at the center, then sime pointy tubes grew out of its center, rotated, and were pulsing, like electrically, the top of those tubes were pulsing upward while they were spining.
Then the tubes shape go back inside the disk.
The disk was just a flat disk again, and sliwly took height and was then heigher than ne so i saw the bottom part.
It stayed inti a disk shape and slowly moved away from me at a constent speed.
I kept looking at it until it was so far away the i only saw a tiny dot until it was gone.

The entire time i was ultra focus.
It lasted probably 10 minutes.

Then, me and my mother, weirdly forget about it for a month, then i start talking about it again with her, she kept describing the same as i remember.

I then wrote a report to MUFON but without anything then.

Also i was shocked that way after i saw the almost same ufo sighting on the fin365 youtube channel that make 3d scene of sightings.
The texas one from 97. Which the video was posted way after my soghting and MUFON repirt.
It spooked me too, knowing i wasn't alone and that the description matched mine which is kinda very specific.

I spend a lot of time looking if anyone reported something, looking for explenations, but havn't find anything to explain. Feel free to give your thoughts or ideas or telling me if you saw the sane or heard of a similar case.

It took me a long time to stop overthinking this and accept that i don't know its nature and what it was doing.

Location : Switzerland

Me and my mother were drinking coffee at home.
It was a quiet sunday afternoon, a bit overcast but a clear day.
My mother noticed something through the window and asked what is it.
I looked and, it was like 300-400 meter from us at our right at a 30 degree angle.

At first glance i said it was a plastic bag and she told me it isn't.

It was silent outside, no cars, noone walking, not that strange but there's usually more activity outside even for a sunday.

The object was approaching slowly from our right going to our left.

It was a small black sphere, it looked like a liquid, its surface had a texture and was wobbling like a fluid does in zero gravity, the silouhette had waves moving around, and it reflected light like a metal does. So it was like a floating ball of mercury so to speak.
But it looked out of place like a CGI render. 
I'd guess it's size to be at a maximum of 2 meters in diamater.

It moved slowly but precisly and intelligently like a drone would. It wasn't pushed by the wind, it maintain perfectly it's altitude like a drone does.

It was totally silent.

I knew i was looking at something abnormal so i quickly looked for the camera we had but didn't find it, i wasn't aware we sold it.

I had my phone that was an s21 at the time, but here's the thing, i decided not to film it.
First because i'm not a phone guy, and that i wanted to live this moment fully, to look at it, not through a screen. And this might sound ridiculous but i felt like i shouldn't film it at all, out of respect. It felt like a deal 'i'm not filming but let me look at you'. I'm not sure why i thought this, but i did.

The venue issued a written statement on Instagram explaining its connection to a Dec. 12 video of a crowd of people shouting at law enforcement agents in the parking lot of Breaux Mart on Magazine Street.

Libs of TikTok, an influential conservative account on X, posted the video a few days later, saying that the people filming were employees of Sports Drink, calling them “deranged leftists and “complete losers” who were mistakenly jeering law enforcement officers there to arrest a man for allegedly having child sexual abuse material, thinking it was an immigration sweep.

The video had more than two million views by Friday, and commenters piled on in deriding the protestors.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill confirmed last Friday that the agents from the Louisiana Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force were there to arrest a man on 120 counts of possession of child sex abuse material.

Murrill’s office said in a press release that anti-immigration protesters shouted expletives, honked their horns and made hand gestures at the agents and followed their vehicles.

By Tuesday, Sport’s Drink owner Andrew Stephens had decided to close temporarily out of concern for “safety of our employees, patrons and community at large.” Its social media accounts were made private.

In Friday’s post, the company said the post’s author was the only person from Sports Drink in the Breaux Mart parking lot. The statement, though written in the first person, was unsigned, and Stephens did not respond to a request for comment.

The statement said the poster went to Breaux Mart after hearing that immigration enforcement officers might be there, but that “my intent and action did not align here.”

The author apologized and said they will “strive to improve in the future.”

Sports Drink shared that it would reopen the cafe on Monday and resume its calendar of events after Christmas.

1pr3rw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pr3rw7/bfs_interactions_with_female_coworker/,BF’s Interactions With Female Coworker,"I started seeing this guy a few months ago. He’s been giving a female coworker rides to and from work, which at first, I thought was a one off sorta thing. Later on, I found out it’d been going on for about a year! He also drives his mom to work, as she’s a coworker as well. Over time, the rides with his coworker escalated to him also helping her pick up groceries (not paying, just rides) and even carrying her work monitor so she could work from home. He never set any expectations or boundaries with her and says he didn’t speak up because he was just trying to be kind.

Recently, he told me he was going to end this. He became very upset because he feels she was ungrateful and entitled. He said she never showed appreciation (like buying him coffee, paying for his gas or small gestures), and that made him feel taken for granted. He also complained a lot about being tired from doing this, but at the same time insisted that giving her rides “wasn’t a problem.” When she stopped coming in for a day, he said it felt amazing to go straight to work and then straight home, and that it was a “reminder” that he’d hit his limit months ago.

What gives me pause is:

•	He did this for a full year without communicating, then built resentment.

•	He seems to believe that appreciation would have justified his overextension, which I find confusing… why should HIS overextending the “help” need to be justified at all? Why should there be “appreciation” from a coworker in the first place…? There’s no expectation of mutuality. Why is he “expecting” anything in return?

•	He also complains that his mom doesn’t appreciate him enough because she doesn’t give him money for gas either… despite the fact that she pays his rent and groceries.

My concern is that it looks like he tends to overgive, doesn’t set boundaries, then expects gratitude or validation to make it feel worth it. I worry this could turn into resentment, passive aggression, or controlling behavior over time. I’m also questioning whether this shows emotional immaturity or inexperience with healthy boundaries, especially with women.

Both married young - she had kids a bit earlier than me - but both connected instantly. The attraction was so hard to ignore and I could tell it was mutual. The first 2 years were a slow burn of only crossing paths naturally, obsessing but talking with such ease it was scary until we both made an online effort to meet up.

We kissed 2 times but the guilt wore her down. For the next couple of years there was NC (minus a few marketplace enquires) and only Spotify playlists to hold hope and make signals of longing.

A few months ago, she made contact and before long, we had a coffee and then made love at our next meetup in a private spot, without really discussing it. It just happened as we had so much pent up lust. It was my first time with someone else for so long. And so incredible.

We have given space to each other over this school holiday period with the intention to experience each other more properly again. But I feel she will disappear again so I have my guard up.

We are so compatible but we’re also but torn about being committed to parenting our kids in a stable house.

We both make sure life at home is happy, don’t overlap (although one of her children began attending my kids school this year)

Is the idea of her / the affair more of the turn on it feels or are we destined to make our lives and love honourable and pure?

How do I cope or make a confession to my wife?

There is something incredibly cozy about the long dark in my opinion. I feel the mixture of the almost oil paint art style and bitter cold that requires sitting in front of a fire makes the experience so relaxing at points. I love the way eating or drinking something sounds. Heating coffee up on a fire and hearing the ceramic clang on from the cup or the sounds that are made when you make pancakes or pie. Or the little bits of steam coming off of porridge right before I eat it on a cold night. Not to mention the UI and all the comfort foods you can make as well as heating up teas and coffee in front of a fire. This game helped me through a tough time in my life, I was dumped from a two year relationship and was feeling down. I needed something to keep my mind busy but relax me enough to process the change in my life, this game did that for me. 

On the same note the game also provided me with an interesting and engaging challenge that keeps me coming back. I take all of my mistakes from my previous runs and learn to avoid them on follow up play throughs.

Is this something I need to take her to the vet about? The closest emergency vet is over an hour away, very expensive (I am low income but can afford it), and it's hailing out but I want her to be ok above anything else!!

1pr3lni,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pr3lni,Neya F8,"I had high hopes for the cigar they dry inhale was light flavorful. Woody, almost sweet. Now it may just have been bad luck but I didn't get a very good burn in the final third ended up getting quite hot and had to snuff her out sooner than I usually like to. The flavors were light and mild which is to be expected. It is a nice cigar but I don't know if it's nice enough at the $10 Canadian price point. If it was around the $7 price point I could see having a box of them to have with friends but at 10 I think there's just better options out there. Again, that's not to say that it wasn't a pleasant smoke through the first 2/3 on point without what described sweet Woody coffee citrusy. I definitely recommend if you have a deal. Grab one or two at full price. Maybe not but again probably just got unlucky with the burn. Look forward to trying one again with a better burn.",1,1766198965.0,cigar,0,1.0,False

I made it through two practice problems, felt pretty good. took a break, came back, couldn't remember how to do either problem anymore.

My husband and I are relocating to Milwaukee very soon (a bit out of the blue) and are trying to figure out which neighborhoods to look at for renting.

A little about us:
• We’d prefer a place near bars, restaurants, coffee shops, etc.
• Ideally somewhere that still feels safe and has a relaxed vibe
• I’ll be working near the Third Ward/downtown while my husband will be working in Germantown
• Looking for a 2 bed/2 bath to rent to get us started.

We don’t know the city super well yet, so we’re hoping for some local insight. We’ve heard mixed things about different pockets of the city and want to be intentional about where we end up.
Any neighborhoods you’d recommend (or avoid) for people in our situation? And if there are specific buildings/complexes worth checking out, that would be amazing.

Thanks in advance!!",0,1766198795.0,milwaukee,11,0.31,False

He’s been giving a female coworker rides to and from work, which at first, I thought was a one off sorta thing. Later on, I found out it’d been going on for about a year! He also drives his mom to work, as she’s a coworker as well. Over time, the rides with his coworker escalated to him also helping her pick up groceries (not paying, just rides) and even carrying her work monitor so she could work from home. He never set any expectations or boundaries with her and says he didn’t speak up because he was just trying to be kind.

Recently, he told me he was going to end this. He became very upset because he feels she was ungrateful and entitled. He said she never showed appreciation (like buying him coffee, paying for his gas or small gestures), and that made him feel taken for granted. He also complained a lot about being tired from doing this, but at the same time insisted that giving her rides “wasn’t a problem.” When she stopped coming in for a day, he said it felt amazing to go straight to work and then straight home, and that it was a “reminder” that he’d hit his limit months ago.

What gives me pause is:

•	He did this for a full year without communicating, then built resentment.

•	He seems to believe that appreciation would have justified his overextension, which I find confusing… why should HIS overextending the “help” need to be justified at all? Why should there be “appreciation” from a coworker in the first place…? There’s no expectation of mutuality. Why is he “expecting” anything in return?

•	He also complains that his mom doesn’t appreciate him enough because she doesn’t give him money for gas either… despite the fact that she pays his rent and groceries.

My concern is that it looks like he tends to overgive, doesn’t set boundaries, then expects gratitude or validation to make it feel worth it. I worry this could turn into resentment, passive aggression, or controlling behavior over time. I’m also questioning whether this shows emotional immaturity or inexperience with healthy boundaries, especially with women.

Am I overreacting for questioning this pattern and my interest in continuing the relationship?",2,1766198737.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

Let's get started, neatly!

Nose: cherry, slight apple and oak.

Palate: Delicious cherry, vanilla, slight apple peel bitter and a touch of oak. Really digging in, I feel like there's also a hint of coffee and chocolate that becomes more apparent in the finish. Also some rye spice in the background.

Finish: Cherry, chocolate and coffee, cinnamon and clove.

Very tasty. I wouldn't immediately guess this was a rye, which in my limited experience seems to be normal for Old Forester Rye, but I do get a hint of rye spice in the background. 82/100.

I think this could be good in Nog, but let's find out!

Nog with a bit of a stronger cherry note on the nose 

I think the cherry flavor is a bit stronger than usual, but aside from that the whiskey has completely disappeared in the nog.

I was hopeful that it would really accentuate the nog flavors. But it seems like it was too similar and just couldn't stand up to the nog.

1pr3bbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassF/comments/1pr3bbn/chapter_12_the_orphan_and_the_guest/,Chapter 12: The Orphan and the Guest,"# Danny

The first shot missed. Too soft. Too slow.

The blood strand slapped against the pillow pinned to my closet door and slid down like paint. I clenched my fist. Focused harder. The cut on my arm pulsed open again, thin and controlled, the way I’d learned.

A second strand floated out, twisting midair, sharp as wire. This one hit dead center.

“Better,” I muttered.

I wasn’t training for glory. Or for grades. I just needed to prove to myself that I was stronger than yesterday. That every failure from before was just groundwork for control. Even if I had to bleed for it.

A knock pulled me out of focus.

“Danny?” my mom called through the door. Her voice was soft but tense. “Honey, come out here, please.”

I wiped the sweat off my forehead, careful not to smudge any blood, and opened the door just a crack. She was standing in the hallway, holding her tablet like it had just punched her in the chest. Her eyes were already glassy.

“You need to see this,” she said, and her voice broke a little.

I stepped out, heart already sinking. She tapped the screen, turned the volume up. A news anchor filled the feed, smooth voice, practiced sadness.

“Tragic loss for the Senate and the nation. Vicente Calderon, longtime political leader and vocal advocate for powered youth reform, was found dead late last night in his private office. While no official cause has been released, sources suggest health complications linked to stress and overwork may have contributed. Authorities are advising against speculation as the investigation continues.”

I didn’t move. Didn’t speak. I just stared.

“Health complications?” I muttered.

She didn’t answer. The screen split to show photos of Vicente shaking hands, giving speeches. Then it cut. To her. Livia.

She was standing near an officer. Not crying. Not moving. Just holding her sketchbook to her chest like it was the only thing keeping her from disappearing. She looked so small. So empty.

I felt it before I even realized what was happening. Warmth on my cheeks. I touched my face. Blood. Not a wound. Not training. Just feeling.

My mom stepped forward. “Danny…”

But I turned before she could see my eyes. Because I wasn’t okay. Because nothing about this felt okay.

She placed a gentle hand on my back, didn’t say anything else. And I was grateful for that. Because I couldn’t have answered. Couldn’t explain why it hurt so much to see someone else’s grief. Couldn’t explain why it felt like something inside me had cracked wide open.

All I knew was that Livia had lost her father. And all I could think about was how I couldn’t do anything to stop it.

\-----

# Sofia

The spiders were restless. They crawled up the corners of the living room, silent, twitchy, like they could feel something wrong before I even saw the news.

Mom was sitting on the couch with a tea she hadn’t touched. Dad kept switching channels like that would change the headline. It didn’t.

I stood behind the couch, watching the screen. Livia’s name wasn’t mentioned. Not even once. But I saw her. Just for a second. In the background. Standing next to a car, arms around her sketchbook. The same way I held my spiders when I was scared.

“They’re already blaming it on the other party,” my father said. “Of course.”

“Figures,” my mother muttered. “One less mouth in the Senate.”

I looked at them. Then at the news. Then at the spider on my wrist, a small one, black and gold. It was shaking. And for the first time in days, I felt like I was the one being watched.

\-----

# Tasha

“What the hell?” I muttered, flipping through the channels like I didn’t already know what I’d find.

“Language,” my dad warned from the kitchen, but even he wasn’t really listening.

My mom was sitting at the table, staring at her phone. Not scrolling. Just staring.

“Senator Calderon’s passing leaves a significant void in national defense policy,” the anchor said.

Void? He’d been murdered. I didn’t know how I knew. But I did.

“This is shady,” I said, turning the screen toward them. “You guys don’t think this was random, right?”

My dad frowned. “Well, news says it was health issues.”

“And since when do they ever say the truth?”

My mom exhaled. “Sweetheart, don’t get involved with politics. It’s dirty and dangerous.”

“Exactly,” I said under my breath. Because if they could do that to a senator, what could they do to us?

\-----

# Trent

“Yo,” I called out from the hallway. “Y’all see this?”

No one answered. Figures. Mom was at work. Dad probably asleep on the couch again. I turned the volume up.

“Massive loss for the Gold Capes initiative…”

I didn’t know the guy personally. But anyone that important, dead without warning? That didn’t sit right. I checked the group chat. Nothing from Danny. Nothing from Livia.

That’s when I knew it was real.

\-----

# Clint

I saw the headline in the corner of the screen while waiting for my mom to finish folding laundry. Didn’t say anything. Didn’t blink. Just stared.

“Another one bites the dust,” my stepdad muttered, not even looking up from his beer.

I kept my mouth shut. The news kept rolling.

“New reports suggest Senator Calderon may have been under investigation for alleged misuse of federal funds linked to powered youth programs…”

I felt it before I understood it. Something deep, slow, sinking. Like a memory slipping under water. I turned away from the screen, but the words stuck to me. Misuse of funds. Powered youth.

It wasn’t just noise. It was familiar. But I didn’t know why. Like I was forgetting something important and couldn’t even remember what it used to feel like.

My mom said something. I didn’t catch it. I just nodded and picked up another towel. And tried to ignore the way my hands were shaking.

\-----

# Mina

I was brushing my teeth when the bathroom screen lit up with breaking news. Toothbrush halfway to my mouth. Foam dripping down my chin.

The name hit first. Then the photo. Then Livia. Only for a second. She wasn’t crying. She wasn’t blinking. She was just standing near a patrol car, clutching her sketchbook like it was the only thing still keeping her body together. Eyes wide. Frozen. Like something inside her had already left.

I stopped moving. Just froze. The voice on the screen kept talking, too calm to be real.

“Authorities confirm no foul play…”

My fingers twitched. I swallowed wrong. Choked on the foam. Spat into the sink, pink and sour.

The screen blinked out. Black. Dead. Too fast.

“Signal interference,” the house AI said like it meant nothing.

But I didn’t believe it. No one ever does when the darkness shows up exactly on time.

\-----

# The Teacher

I leaned against the wall long after the others had gone, still trying to steady my breath. The blood had dried under my nose. My heartbeat hadn’t.

Leo hadn’t moved. He just sat there, hands in his lap, gaze far away, like he was watching something I couldn’t see. Or maybe waiting for something I couldn’t stop.

“Elis,” I said, still breathless. “Stay with him. Don’t leave him alone.”

She didn’t argue. Just nodded and crossed the room, taking a chair by the far wall. Close enough to watch him. Far enough not to provoke.

I dragged my feet toward the hallway. Every step felt heavier than the last. Not just fatigue, distortion. Like reality itself was still shivering from the ripple he left behind.

I barely made it to my office before slumping into the chair. Elis followed minutes later. She didn’t sit. She just stood there, arms crossed, like if she kept her muscles tense enough, the truth wouldn’t collapse the room around us.

“That wasn’t normal,” she said.

“No.” I closed my eyes. “It wasn’t.”

“You didn’t just lose blood.”

I nodded slowly. “I lost something. For a moment, I forgot your name. Forgot why I was even standing there.”

Elis stayed silent, her eyes darkening.

“We need to be careful,” I said. “He’s not just unstable. He’s fragmented. And I don’t think he understands any of it.”

“He’s scared,” she muttered. “And so are we.”

I looked at her. “No,” I said. “We’re not scared. Not yet. We’re guessing. That’s worse.”

A pause. Then I continued. “We have to understand what he is. Not just the power. The pattern. The origin. The rules, if there are any.”

Elis didn’t reply right away. Then she sighed. “So what? Research? Interviews? Psychic scans? You almost got erased just by touching his mind.”

“I know.”

A long silence settled between us. Then I said it. “There’s only one person I’ve ever met who’s dealt with something close to this. Not the same, but close enough to build a frame around it.”

Elis didn’t look up. “You’re not talking about—”

“I am.”

Her jaw clenched. “Zenos. Don’t.”

“I have to.”

“She hates anomalies. You know that. She hates when things don’t fit. She’ll break him before she tries to understand him.”

“She’s also the only person who might survive analyzing him without losing her identity.”

Elis stepped forward, voice sharp now. “She tried to get your whole class shut down. She called Leo ‘biohazard trash’ before even meeting him.”

I stood up. “She’s also my mother.”

That shut her up. I didn’t say it with pride. I didn’t say it with hate. I just said it like a fact I’d spent years trying to forget.

Elis stared at me for a long time. Then finally, softly, “She won’t help us.”

I looked at her. “She will,” I said. “Because this time, I’m not giving her a choice.”

When I opened the door again, Leo was exactly where I’d left him. Same chair. Same posture. Same impossible stillness. But the air around him was quieter now. Not safe, but steadier. Like something inside him had settled just enough to stop flickering.

I stepped in, let the door close behind me. He didn’t look up. I spoke anyway.

“My place has a spare room. It’s nothing fancy. Smells like books and coffee. Sometimes blood, if I forget to clean.”

Still nothing. I kept going, tone dry as ever. “It’s not exactly a five-star retreat, but I think you’ll sleep better there than here. And I’d feel better having you under a roof I can control.”

That got a flicker in his eyes. He didn’t move, but he was listening. I took a step closer. “You don’t have to say anything. Just nod, and we go.”

He hesitated. Then one nod. Small. Barely there. But I saw it. And that was enough.

Elis met me at the end of the hallway. Her arms were crossed. Same as always. But her eyes had softened, just a fraction.

“He said yes?” she asked.

“He nodded.”

“That’s basically a contract,” she said, deadpan.

I smirked. “He’ll be staying with me.”

She raised a brow. “You sure that’s wise?”

“No.”

“Same old Zenos. Leaping into volcanoes with a stick and a guess.”

I exhaled. “He needs distance. Space to stabilize. I’ll watch him.”

She nodded, then added with a faint smirk, “You do remember who else lives in your house, right?”

I grimaced. “Believe me. I’m counting the hours until she threatens to dissect me.”

“I’ll join you both later,” Elis said, stepping aside to let us pass. “Bringing a few bodies. For, you know, enrichment.”

“Lovely,” I muttered. “Bring flowers next time.”

She gave me a two-finger salute. “Drive safe.”

Leo followed me without a word. The car ride started with the usual awkward silence. Old seats. Cold windows. The dashboard light flickered like it knew what we were carrying.

Leo sat in the passenger seat like he didn’t know how to fit into it. Like maybe it would reject him if he breathed too loud. I didn’t push. Just turned on the engine and started driving.

Three blocks in, I tried. “You allergic to music?”

Leo shook his head.

“Good.”

I tapped the stereo. It clicked, whirred, then failed. Typical. I slapped the side of it. “Of course.”

Leo glanced at me. Then, cautiously, looked at the stereo again. He didn’t speak. But I felt something shift. The air bent slightly. A pressure, faint and wrong.

And then the stereo blinked out of existence. No static. No spark. No crack. It was just gone. Like it had never been there at all.

We both stared at the hole where it used to be. I looked at him. He looked at his hands. Then at me.

“Sorry,” he whispered.

I didn’t shout. Didn’t react. Just kept one hand on the wheel and said, “At least it wasn’t the engine.”

He blinked. And for the first time, the first time, Leo smiled. Not big. Not long. But real. And just like that, the silence didn’t feel so hostile anymore.

Fifteen minutes later, we pulled up to a house that looked like it wanted to be left alone. Three floors of weathered brick, vines choking the balcony rails, and windows that didn’t believe in curtains.

Leo looked at it with something between fear and curiosity.

“This is where I live,” I said.

He didn’t reply.

I added, “And also where my mother lives. Don’t worry, she hates me more than she’ll ever hate you.”

He gave me a look. A questioning one. I nodded. “You’ll see.”

We stepped out of the car. The gate groaned in protest. And I led the most dangerous student I’d ever met straight into the lion’s den.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1766198109.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False
1pr3alr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pr3alr/what_i_left_in_the_dark/,What I Left in The Dark,"He arrived without an appointment. No name, no referral—just walked into my office ten minutes before closing and sat down across from me like he'd always been there. His eyes were wrong. Not in color or shape, but in recognition. He looked at me like we’d met before. Like I had done something to him.  

I asked his name. 

He smiled but didn’t answer, just tilted his head like he was waiting for me to say it. My pen wouldn’t write when I tried to fill out the intake form. The line for Patient Name stayed blank, no matter how hard I pressed. And when I glanced at the mirror behind him, only one of us was visible. 

“You don’t remember me, do you, Rob?” He asked, his chuckle sharp. 

 My hand twitched, tracing a faint scar on my thumb, my brother’s pocketknife, a blood-oath gone wrong. The memory slipped away, but the patient’s eyes held it. 

“How do you know my name?” I asked. 

“I thought I'd be hard to forget. But you’ve been avoiding me for so long.” He leaned forward, as if testing my boundaries. 

“Maybe, maybe it’s easier if you pretend I'm not real, right? Easier for both of us.” 

I took a moment, gathering my words. 

“Well, what brings you in today?” 

He paused. 

“Well, I think it’s been you who’s brought me here.” 

“I didn’t mean to come, but it seems I've been following you for a while now.” 

He looked past me, focusing on... something. 

“It’s time you finally see me, don’t you think?” 

I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck rise, a shiver I tried to ignore. 

""See you?"" I echoed, trying to regain control of the situation. ""I’m not sure what you’re implying. Care to clarify?"" 

He didn’t answer right away. Instead, his eyes seemed to scan the room, but his focus never left mine. 

""You’ve seen me. You just haven’t been looking."" His voice was low now, as if sharing a secret. ""And you never wanted to."" 

The silence between us stretched, the sound of the clock ticking louder than it should have been. I tried to brush off the unsettling feeling, but it crept up, sinking deeper into my skin. 

“I’m afraid I don’t understand.” My voice came out more strained than I intended, but he didn’t seem to notice. 

“No,” he said softly. ""You do. You just buried it."" 

There was a sudden pressure in the air, like we were both holding our breath. Waiting. Waiting for something. 

I glanced at the mirror again. This time, I didn’t just see myself; his reflection stared back at me. 

And in that moment, I knew: I had seen him before. But the memory slipped away, like water through my fingers. 

I stood up to signal the end of the session, trying to keep my composure. “Let’s meet next week,” I said, the words coming out mechanically. 

He nodded, slowly, like he understood something I didn’t. But before he stood, he leaned in slightly, his voice dropping to a near whisper. 

“You’re not sure if I’ll come back, are you?” 

I froze, hand still on the door. He had a point, but I couldn’t allow myself to acknowledge it. 

“I’ll see you next week,” I repeated, this time more firmly. 

As I walked him out, the hallway felt different. Longer. The light flickered as if struggling to keep up with my thoughts. I glanced at the clock, but I swear the minute hand had moved too quickly. 

When I turned back to my office, I saw the reflection again—the same reflection I had seen in the mirror. It wasn’t just a flicker this time. I saw myself... and him. Standing beside me. 

But when I blinked, it was gone. 

The notes from that session were a complete blur. I went over them  

again and again, yet the handwriting wasn’t quite mine. It felt as though there was more beneath the surface, something I couldn’t put my finger on. 

I picked up the pen, but it wouldn’t write. 

I blinked. There were new words on the page. The same, unnatural writing. 

“You’ll understand soon.” 

“God damn it!” I slammed the notebook shut, my heart pounding. 

The next appointment came quickly. 

“Hello again,” I said. 

“You don’t seem to be listed in our records. How long have you been seeing a therapist?” 

“I haven’t. I felt—a pull. Like I was meant to come to you.” 

“Why do you think that is?” I replied as he smirked. 

“People are capable of horrible things, Rob. You’re not special.” 

I glanced again at the mirror. This time, it wasn’t a person, but a crime. A violent, bloody crime. 

The patient tilted his head, watching me with detached amusement, while humming a song. So familiar, yet I couldn’t put my finger on it. 

“That blood on the window,” he said calmly, “it’s yours. You tried to forget, didn’t you? But some stains, they don't wash off. They linger. 

He smiled again, but this time, it was softer. Not mocking—reminiscing. 

“You called it an accident.” 

He paused. 

“But it wasn’t. That’s for sure.” 

I sat there, unmoving. After an eternity, I gathered the words for a response. 

“I don’t know who you are or what you want, but I did no such thing.” 

He smirked, then began to chuckle. 

He walked out of the room. 

An unsettling calm washed over me, but beneath it, a powerful urge took root. I had to know. Know what he meant, know why that blood was on the window. A fragmented image flashed in my mind: a dark shape, a glint of metal, a muffled sound, but it vanished before I could grasp it. I stood up, my legs feeling heavy and unfamiliar, and found myself moving towards the hallway, drawn by an invisible thread in the direction he went. I walked towards the lobby, determined to find the truth. I passed by the front desk and decided to ask them where the patient went. 

“Did a man leave just now?” 

“No, you’ve been alone for an hour, Rob.” 

\*\*\* 

The next morning, my desk had a sticky note on it. My handwriting, at least I think so. 

“Stop pretending.” 

I read that in my kitchen. When my head moved up, I was in my office. The patient was waiting, as if he knew I was going to be there. 

I sat down, my throat tight, expecting his usual smirk or cryptic words. But he just stared, silent, his eyes locked on mine. No tilt of the head, no chuckle—nothing. The clock ticked, each second stretching into a void. I cleared my throat, tried to start. 

“So,” I said, voice cracking, “why are you here today?” 

He didn’t blink. His gaze bore into me, heavy, like it was peeling back my skin. I shifted in my chair, the pen trembling in my hand. 

“What do you know about Daniel?” I pressed, desperation creeping in. 

Still nothing. The mirror behind him flickered, showing only me, then him, then me again. My reflection’s eyes weren’t mine, they were his, blue and sad, like Daniel’s. I looked away, my heart pounding. 

“Say something!” I shouted, slamming my fist on the desk. 

He leaned forward, just an inch, and the air thickened. No words, but his silence screamed louder than any accusation. I felt it, the weight of what I’d buried, pressing down, suffocating. 

“You’re not real,” I said. My voice was shaking, but I kept going. “You’re something I made up.” 

“Isn’t that the same thing?” he asked. 

I threw a chair. I don’t know why. Maybe some part of me thought that hurting him would end this for good. Instead, the chair hit the wall and fell apart like it was made of paper. 

He just stared at me. Pity in his eyes. 

“You buried me,” he said, “Deep. But you can still feel the weight, can’t you?” 

I rushed him. Fist clenched, breath ragged. I needed to hit something. 

The moment I made contact—pain. White-hot, lancing through my ribs. Like I’d punched myself. Hard. 

I fell back, gasping. He hadn’t moved. 

“You can’t hurt me,” he said softly. “You’d only be hurting yourself.” 

“What the hell are you doing to me!” I screamed. 

“You are doing this to yourself. We both know it.” 

I stood there, silent. 

After a while, I curled into my chair, heart hammering. My hands were trembling. 

“It wasn’t an accident,” I whispered. 

He stepped closer and started laughing. 

“There it is! You're finally listening!” 

Blood on the glass, a scream. A sharp glint. The flash of a wrist twisting. 

I sobbed. I don’t remember starting, but I couldn’t stop. 

The lights buzzed. When I looked again, he was gone. Only one chair in the room. Just me. 

But in the mirror, we were both still there. 

He was watching me. 

Waiting. 

I opened my notebook. The pen worked again. I didn’t remember writing the final sentence. 

“He didn’t die. I just left him in the dark long enough to forget he was screaming.” 

The notebook slipped from my hands, the words burning through me. My chest heaved, the air too thick, the room too small. The mirror stared back, but it wasn’t my office anymore. It was the kitchen, our kitchen, the one in the house where Daniel and I grew up, where we’d carved our initials into the table and swore we’d never be like Dad. 

The vision hit like a blade. I was there again, the fluorescent light buzzing, the air sour with whiskey and rage. Daniel stood across from me, his eyes wild. 

“You took it all, Rob!” He shouted, slamming his fist on the counter. “Dad’s money, the house, everything! You left me with nothing!” 

 His words cut deeper than they should’ve, unearthing years of guilt; I'd been the one who ‘made it,’ while Daniel drowned in debt and drugs. I tried to explain that dad’s will wasn’t my choice, but he laughed, bitter. 

“You’re just like him, a liar.” 

 

I didn’t know when I took the knife. It was sitting there, in the block by the sink, its handle clenched in my palm. 

“Shut up, Dan,” I growled, but he kept going, daring me. 

“What, you gonna fix me, therapist?” 

 His shove sent me flying back, and then something snapped. I lunged, the knife sinking into his chest—once, twice, blood pouring out. He gasped, stumbled, and crashed into the kitchen window, his hands clawing the glass desperately. 

“Robert...” he whispered, sliding down, his eyes locked on mine, wide with shock. 

 I froze, the knife clanging to the floor, a memory flashing: us as kids, pressing our hands to that window, dreaming of escape. 

I blinked, and the vision disappeared. I was back in my office, the mirror blank, the patient gone. But the blood, it lingered in my mind, like a wound that just won’t close. I’d covered it up, hadn’t I? Dragged Dan’s body to the basement, wrapped it in a tarp. Smashed the side window, tipped over chairs, cut my own arm to sell the story. 

An intruder. A fight. Daniel “missing.” 

Days blurred. I stopped answering calls, let appointments pile up. Colleagues left voicemails: 

“Rob, you okay?” 

But I couldn’t face them. My office became a cave, papers strewn, mirrors draped with shirts, but the window found me. In my apartment’s glass door, in the coffee shop’s storefront, in every polished surface, blood, Dan’s handprint, his face pressed against the pane, mouthing, why, Rob? The patient’s voice followed, soft, 

“You see him now, don’t you? You can’t unsee blood.” 

His sessions, if you can even call them that, grew worse. He’d sit there, his face shifting, sometimes Dan’s, sometimes mine. 

 “You took the fortune, Rob,” he’d say. “But you paid in blood. You’re next.” 

 Mirrors showed the kitchen window, Daniel’s body slumped, blood dripping upward, defying gravity. Once, I swore I heard his voice, not the patient’s, but Daniel’s, whispering through the glass:  

“You kept it all, Rob. Give it back.” 

\*\*\* 

I don’t know when I decided to end it. Maybe when I found a note in my handwriting, Free him, Rob, tucked in my coat. Maybe when the patient said,  

“You can’t live with both of us.” 

 I drove to the office at midnight, the city a maze of glass, every pane reflecting the kitchen window: blood, Daniel’s hand, his dying gasp. I climbed the stairs to the roof, my legs heavy. The door was unlocked, like it was waiting. 

The rooftop was cold, the wind sharp. Below, the city glimmered, a thousand windows staring up. Every one was the kitchen window, blood streaked; Daniel’s face pressed against it, his body falling, over and over. Some showed him alive, laughing as a kid, our hands on the glass, promising to share everything. Others showed the knife, my hand twisting, his blood spraying. The patient stood at the edge, his voice soft, almost kind. 

 “You see him everywhere, Rob. Free him.” 

I stepped to the ledge, my heart pounding. I believed it, believed my death would release him, let his spirit rest, maybe let us be brothers again.  

“I’ll make it right, Dan,” I whispered, picturing us young, free, before Dad’s shadow, before the fortune tore us apart. The patient’s eyes were Daniel’s now, blue and sad. 

“Come home, Rob,” he said. “We’re brothers again.” 

I leaned forward. The wind roared, the glass below a sea of blood and memory. The panes flickered—Daniel’s face, our childhood, the knife, the blood—then went dark. The wind stopped. For the first time in what seemed like forever, it was silent. I let go, and the world tilted as I dropped into the glass below. ",6,1766198049.0,nosleep,0,0.87,False

At that point I had short hair and wore binders, however I noticed how bigoted it was so I stopped wearing them (so I at least looked slightly feminine lol) it was fun at first, and I got really close with my manager (a dif one) but he left, so he was being replaced by a new guy. For the sake of this story I'll call him JB.  JB was 20 and I was 16 when I first met him (and he turned 21 before I turned 17) and at first I didn't like him much, he was really tall and loud and kind of annoying. So for around the first month or so I didn't talk to him much. And I'm not exactly sure what happened to make us start talking, but I remember thinking it was because he was really funny. He was silly and would just make me laugh, so I started to talk to him some more. Soon I became his 'favorite' he would buy me coffee or food, listen to my stories ECT. He told me I was 'special' to him, that I was one of his best friends. And that felt good for me. But then stuff started going slightly down hill. He told me how I shouldn't cut my hair because I 'look like a boy' and that he wouldn't be my friend anymore if I cut my hair. How I should be more feminine or 'no guy will ever like you if you don't' he would make fun of the way I was, saying I was weird and such an 'innocent homeschooler' but Also contradicting himself and say how 'you are so special, and sweet' he would give me hugs all the time, or stand close to/behind me. He would call me 'wife material' ECT. I once made the mistake of telling him I had a girlfriend (because keep in mind, even though they didn't know I was trans, I was openly queer) and he would go into excessive detail and ask if we ever had sex, or touched each other or did anything sexual in general. He would do this in front of my other coworkers too. And it was embarrassing, but since we were close I shouldn't feel uncomfortable. He would do the same to me, tell me in detail about things he did with past partners, or things he wanted to do with potential partners. And I thought it was a little weird, but we were friends! And friends talk about everything; however, things got much worse, he would pay me money/gifts to hit me. It sounds odd, but at the time I was like ""let him 'test his strength' on me in exchange for money/gifts? Hell yeah!"" I just thought it was some type of silly game or something. Until he would start doing it randomly, one time when I was cleaning he walked past me and punched me in the arm (additional context, I'm 5'3 and he was legitimately 6'5 and worked out) I almost dropped the stuff I was carrying, and could feel tears in my eyes but I was trying not to cry in front of everyone. He said he was sorry and 'didnt mean it to be that hard' and I told him it was okay, but I went home with a yellow and purple bruise on my arm. It then progressed to him drunk texting me, asking for pictures (not nudes or anything, just normal ones) and he would tell me how pretty I was, how he is 'mean' to me but genuinely thinks 'any man would be lucky to have you' and how he wanted me to go over to his house, but also how I would have to lie to his roommates and tell them I was 18. This happened for over a year, almost 2 before I suddenly quit for an unrelated reason. There's many other stuff he did but I covered most of the big stuff. And after I quit he still tried to be friends but I didn't want to because he made me upset. Anyway, I still think about those times a lot, BUT the reason I'm starting to think about all this stuff all over again is because of something my coworker at my new job said. We were talking about our sucky managers at old jobs, and I mentioned JB and a few of the things he did (not ones that were NSFW tho) and instead of laughing like I was he was like 'dude....that guy was literally a predator, like grooming you or some shit' and I was confused, because up until now I thought grooming was someone making you trust them for a while then to SA you. And he never never touched me really inappropriately or anything. So I didn't think that counted. However, after work today I decided to look up the definition of grooming. And now that I did, I think maybe I was. But also idk, maybe I'm being dramatic or something. And I do think about him more than I'd like to admit to, and tbh sometimes I worry about seeing him again. Like I know everyone has had a shitty manager at one point or another, but idk.

1pr3897,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pr3897/ongoing_nerve_pain_and_tightness/,Ongoing Nerve Pain and Tightness?,"I (37F, 178cm, 71.5kg) went on a long bike ride 8 months ago (24 April) and haven’t recovered.

Context: I’ve previously biked for fitness, completed 50+ mile rides, and casually biked as well. When not biking, I was an active tennis player and a frequent Barry’s Bootcamp member (12x-15x class per month).

Situation History: I was in LA and a friend suggested we rent bikes and go for a ride along the coast. We ended up biking about 25 miles over the course of five hours (stopped for coffee, stopped for lunch and a cocktail), it was quite a leisurely pace.

Immediately upon disembarking the bike to return to the rental, I was in pretty significant pain in my quads and only my quads. Given my workout history, I brushed it off as just a bad case of DOMS. Over the following days, the pain stayed fairly significant and felt really tight and throbbing. Again, brushed it off as overdoing it a bit and it would go away. A week after the bike ride, I was still in pain and now getting sharp tingles throughout my quads and down my shins (like when your foot falls asleep). I ended up going to urgent care (total of 8 days after the ride); they ran bloodwork and everything came back normal and referred me to an orthopedic and sports neurologist.

Diagnostics: Since then, I have had a MRI of both my back and hips (both normal). An EMG at 14 weeks after the ride (normal). And two months of physical therapy. I am still not back to normal and not even close.

Current state: Early on I could barely walk cumulatively 3K steps per day without being in pain and aggravating nerve tingles. Now eight months later, I can successfully walk 10K steps, but too many days in a row and I find myself in pain.

I want to get back to my life, the gym, activity, adventure. My doctors have simply shrugged and said they’re not sure what it is but I’m showing signs of improvement so there’s nothing else they can do.

Edit Additional Update: So far in two months of PT, I have only been able to sustain some core work. Any type of body weight squat series (we tried five), or lunge (we tried two each side) sends my system into overload and I am struggling for 24-48 hours as if I did a 2 hour leg day at the gym trying to PR.",1,1766197854.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

[Synopsis from Douban](https://m.douban.com/movie/subject/37353746/): 

At a 24-hour bookstore in Shenzhen, Lu Da, frustrated in his job search, rekindles his fighting spirit amid the aroma of coffee and books deep into the night, eventually knocking on the door of opportunity. In the commercial buildings of Huaqiangbei, former opera star Sister Fan sheds her costume to become the “Deal-making Queen,” carving out a new world in the arena of electronic products.

Delivery rider Tan Xiaohe, known as the “Queen of Orders,” embodies professional dignity through her work. Drone engineer Zhang Yi and Nuannuan weave a love story through lines of code. A forest encounter between the lost youth Xiaopeng and a stray civet cat inspires the creation of the country’s first wildlife overpass. Planner Wang Pengqian and his daughter spend a decade guarding the mangroves, witnessing the [black-faced spoonbill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-faced_spoonbill) Y075 become a living symbol of ecological transformation.

These vivid faces connect stories of entrepreneurial legend, industrial upgrading, and technological innovation, vividly portraying Shenzhen’s dramatic transformation over the past 45 years and the boundless possibilities ahead.

1pr34fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pr34fv/reflecting_on_a_recent_dating_experience_and_its/,Reflecting on a recent dating experience and it's impact on dating in the future,"I’m pretty inexperienced with relationships, my parents weren’t emotionally available, so I’ve struggled with boundaries and reading emotions, especially over text.

I’m 26, my last short relationship was around 21–22 and since then I’ve gone on very few dates. I fell into the “work on yourself before dating” trap (lose weight, get a car, finish uni, etc.) and got complacent for a while. This year I feel more confident: I don’t hate my life, I mostly enjoy my job and love my hobbies, but I know I still have things to work on.

A few weeks ago I met a girl through a friend. I saw her again on the street while riding my motorcycle, wanted to talk but chickened out. The friend gave me her Instagram and said she was interested, so I messaged her. We joked a bit, I asked her out and she agreed. We didn't text that often before the first date, later she said that felt weird to her and probably affected my actions later (I started texting more, even to much maybe, to the point of suffocating her, keep in mind that the whole communication is done through text which I didn't really like and should have communicated).

The first date exceeded my expectations, small talk, flirting, deep conversations, touching, laughing, and kissing, it lasted 8 hours. The next few dates were similar but shorter (4–6 hours) and close together. The spark and butterflies were strong, we talked about future plans and trips but didn’t discuss communication, expectations, or boundaries, which I now realize is a mistake. Most of our communication was by text, and there was probably some love-bombing from both sides that I didn’t fully recognize.

On the fifth date I told her I wasn’t seeing anyone else and wanted to continue that way, I didn’t explicitly ask for exclusivity, but I feel I pressured her into saying the same. She seemed hesitant if I think back now, but I am not sure, cause at the moment I was a bit flustered by my nerves.

The upcoming week I knew she had exams while working full time, I tried to give space but messaged after an exam when she said she was stressed. We talked for a bit and she seemed fine, was laughing a bit so I suggested a lowkey movie at my place if she felt tired, which a friend later pointed out that might read as trying to initiate intimacy. She said I should’ve waited until her stress passed, for which I apologized and offered space.

Texting died down over the next two weeks. I tried to be supportive when she shared bad days, but I sometimes default to light jokes when at work and send them without thinking. After about two weeks since our last date I suggested breakfast or coffee as a low-pressure way to talk, and she broke things off, saying she was mad I’d been planning while she was stressed and that her job and classes were her priority. I responded defensively, said we’d moved too fast and that I’d step back, then asked to be removed from her close friends for my peace of mind. A week later I asked if she’d be open to a conversation, and that’s where it ended.

Not sure exactly what the point of this post is. I guess I don’t really have anyone I can talk about this with, but I’ve reflected a lot and know that I have things to work on. My worry is that in future I’ll subconsciously chase that intense connection again, I’m not sure if that’s healthy.

I use public WiFi a lot at coffee shops and libraries, and I want something that makes me feel safer when I’m browsing on those networks. I don’t need anything fancy, just basic protection and peace of mind online.

I looked through the Chrome Web Store, but there are so many choices and it’s hard to tell which ones are secure or worth using. Many of them look sketchy or have limits that make them almost useless after a short time.

Does anyone know of a free VPN extension that is easy to set up, doesn’t slow browsing too much, and is actually reliable?",1,1766197390.0,VPN_Reviewer,0,1.0,False

Honestly, I’ve already accepted our breakup, and it doesn’t bother me anymore, or at least that’s what I tell myself. As I wrote the gift tags and added small messages to each one, everything felt fine.

But when I started writing his message, I found myself crying. It was as if every memory suddenly fell into place, and I felt the sadness of what had happened all over again.

I know that what I decided was for the best. I kept writing, trying to calm myself, but the tears wouldn’t stop. Then I realized something: in six years of being together, this was the first time I had ever written him a letter, and it would also be the last.

Is there an unspoken rule that confidence needs to be softened with a “sorry” or “just checking?” Or am I overthinking a social habit that everyone quietly picked up somewhere along the way?
I am genuinely curious and not trying to start a debate— I just keep catching myself doing it and wondering why.",0,1766197321.0,NoStupidQuestions,7,0.5,False

Big on coffee, music, workouts, brunch, beach days, movies, walks, and the occasional drink. I’m looking for a platonic, ride-or-die type friendship — real conversations, consistent texting, random check-ins, gym talk, hype energy, and actually building something long-term. Not interested in surface-level chats or one-word replies. I’m naturally talkative once the vibe is there and I like staying in touch. Life’s busy, but I miss having that one close guy friend where hearing from each other is just…normal. U.S. only.
