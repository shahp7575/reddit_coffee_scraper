*Petrus, you're 48 years old.  You don't have a partner, you haven't reproduced, you have virtually no money, and the only thing left for you is to slowly, continually sink into the abyss of social media, and online hysteria about the supposed apocalypse.  You know very well that consensus opinion would be for you to kill yourself and get it over with.*

I don't care what your circumstances are, or your situation is.  You will only be psychologically destroyed, after you consent to it.  After ***you choose it*** yourself.

So today, ***literally*** the moment my eyes opened, I consciously decided that today was going to be different.  What have I done, you ask?  Nothing groundbreaking, in most people's minds.  But I ate and had water, ***immediately.***  No sitting on the computer for 2-4 hours before food, with a combination of near-zero blood sugar, dehydration, and my endocrine system tanking, soaking up garbage on YouTube about how apocalyptic everything is.  Water, a cheese and mackerel sandwich, and coffee.

I live one day at a time, and most of the time I can be certain that in terms of my range of physical activities, every day will be the same as the last.

But when you are in your cell, wherever that cell is, and whatever it looks like; remember this.  The one thing you can still choose, is how you ***think*** and ***feel.***  ***You alone*** are the one who decides when it's over.

1iuk1qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1iuk1qs/first_crush_and_pursuing_a_relationship_across/,"First Crush, and Pursuing a Relationship Across Grades in Highschool","I’m 15 (turning 16 soon), and there’s a junior at my high school (he’s 16 turning 17) who has caused me to fall head over heels for the first time in my life. We got to know each other through an after-school club, and I was drawn in by how hardworking, kind, and genuinely enthusiastic he is about almost everything. He has this child-like excitement over the smallest things, and I’ve found it impossible not to smile when he does. He also has this sweet, slightly shy side, and tends to get flustered when people tease him, which is all the more endearing to me.

Recently, my school had a tradition where students can write letters to people they appreciate, tied to a broader Valentine’s theme. I ended up writing him a pretty long message—around 400 words—where I talked about how much I admire his dedication, positivity, and the fact that he just makes everyone’s day brighter by being himself. I didn’t explicitly say, “I have a crush on you,” but I did gush about how great I think he is. On one hand, I want him to understand that I see him as more than a casual friend, but on the other, I’m not sure if he’ll pick up on that.

He hasn’t mentioned reading it yet, and I’m torn about what to do next. However, we are on a break this week, so there's a chance he left his letters at school accidentally at the end of last week. Part of me hopes he’ll bring it up, which might open the door for a deeper conversation (though at the same time, I would never be able the be the initiator of anything relationship related, simply due to my absolutely crushing fear of rejection). Another part of me wonders if I should be more direct, like inviting him to hang out one-on-one or at least letting him know that I’d be interested in getting to know him beyond the club setting. But because there’s a grade difference—he’s a junior, I’m a freshman—I’m worried about how people might perceive it. It’s only about a year and a half in actual age, but in high school, these things can feel bigger.

In the gratitude note he left me he said that this year he got to know me better as a friend, enjoyed our talks, and that he wanted to continue talking as there was a lot more of me to get to know (was this a friendzone, or is this leading, or is it neutral???? I’m so lost). 

I’m also scared about making things awkward in our club if he doesn’t feel the same way. We see each other regularly, and I don’t want to create tension or make him uncomfortable. At the same time, these feelings are really strong for me (stronger than anything I’ve felt before), so I don’t think I can sit on them forever—if you ask my friends who I’ve told, it's obvious how much I’m attracted and swooned by everything about him, based on the way I talk about him.

If anyone’s been in a similar situation, I’d love some guidance on what the best “next steps” might be. Should I wait for him to respond to my letter and keep things friendly until I sense a clear sign of interest? Or should I find a casual way to ask him to hang out—like studying together or grabbing coffee—so I can gauge if there’s any spark on his side? If I should, how do I even go about doing that? I’ve never been the one to initiate a hang out, even with my friends (but they KNOW that I am incredibly anxious when asking, and that I will always say yes if they ask). How can I go about gauging his interest? If he is interested, how can I show that I am interested without being the one to really ask him on a first date? (another tidbit of info, he’s never been in a relationship before, so he wouldn’t know anything about this type of stuff either). Any advice, especially from people who’ve dealt with a slight grade gap and those intense early crush feelings, would be so appreciated. Thank you!",1,1740117686.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1iuk0te,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1iuk0te/why_does_this_feel_like_cheating_but_it_isnt/,Why does this feel like cheating but it isn’t.,"To give some context I was living with my ex wife while all this happened so I’m fully aware how it affected things but I can’t make sense of why people cant just be honest. 

So I (M42) was at a music festival when I met a someone (F48), we chatted and got along. The next night at the festival we met up and ended up sleeping together and also the following night. 

A month after the festival I decided to text her, we chatted on and off for a month while she was overseas, on her way back she invited me over to catch up for coffee. I assumed coffe shop but she texted me her address and said I could stay the night as it was 2 hour drive away. When I arrived there wasn’t too much talk, we ended up sleeping together again. 

I felt bad after this so asked her out on a date to dinner and the movies (I’ve never dated before so I’m aware how lame this is now) we seemed to get along well. 

We continued for a few more dates without sleeping together, some good and some just awkward, After about a month of dating we started sleeping together again. 

We continued dating and even hung out on Christmas and we spent the day together for her birthday (not on her actual birthday but it often got missed by her friends being so close to Christmas and I wanted to at least give her a day)

A further two months in she sent me a random text (we only really texted every second day or so, I’m not a big texter) saying that she hadn’t been completely honest with me and that she did have a FWB but called it off after a couple of dates as it felt wrong and understands if I never want to see her again. I said it’s no problem, honesty can be hard to come by in the moment but I’d still like to continues seeing her. She replied with she was crying tears of joy as the outcome matters..

Fast forward two more months and she approached me and said she had decided not to sleep with anyone else but if I wanted to I would have to tell her so we could start using protection. I suggested she needed to know her worth and if I hadn’t agreed she should  moved on but, but I had respected the text Two months prior and was t sleeping with anyone else since.

Another month passes and while talking I tell her I’m starting to get feelings for her. After telling her that same day she wanted to call things off. I said goodbye to her, thanked her for our time together, and left. The next day she sent a text about she did have feeling but their surface level and doesn’t know if they’ll go deeper but can we stop deep conversations (I’m not great with differentiating deep and surface conversation as I’m very open I’m guessing)

We continued dating for another two months,we were drunk one night and I told her I loved her (8 month in at this stage) when she decided to call things off again, this time she cried a lot and kept saying her head says one thing but her heart says another. She also said something about not being rotation, which was a little strange to me. 

She messaged the next day saying she had spoken to friends and she made a mistake and if we could continue seeing each other. 

We continued dating for another month but some things weren’t adding up, as I asked more questions it turned out she was still sleeping with her FWB 5 months into dating even though she had told me she had called it off after a couple of dates. 

I accepted it up to when she first told me about her FWB and the fact she called it off after a couple of dates as we weren’t sleeping together unprotected but the few months after that point when I had thought she had called it off but she really hadn’t really messed with me. 

I kept asking questions like why he deserved the respect and honesty and I didn’t. Why couldn’t she just have told me as I just don’t trust her anymore. 

Her responses kinda made things a lot worse, like paying it off as “you were just in deeper than me”, “you mattered and he didn’t” ,  “I didn’t tell you as I did’t want to lose you”, “you never keep all your eggs in one basket”, “you just have to trust me as it doesn’t count and it is nothing” 

It messed with my head too much so I called it off, but she pleaded saying she’s done nothing wrong, where as I felt mislead, humiliated, disrespected  and almost like she cheated. She disagrees and says nothing counts for the first 6 months and everything she did was normal in dating these days. 

I guess I have two questions, is it cheating and is it normal to mislead people? If this is the new normal for dating I’m out.

Coffee creamer usually lasts between one and two weeks after opening. Always check the expiration date on the packaging for the best results. Understanding the shelf life of coffee creamer helps you enjoy your favorite brew safely. Using creamer past its prime can affect taste and health.

Different types of creamers, like dairy and non-dairy, have unique storage needs. This post will guide you through the lifespan of various creamers, helping you keep your coffee delicious and safe. So, let’s dive into how long your creamer is good for and what to watch out for. Stay informed and enjoy every sip of your coffee!

# Shelf Life Of Coffee Creamer

Ever wondered how long your coffee creamer will last? The shelf life of coffee creamer depends on its type. Understanding how long your creamer is good for ensures you enjoy fresh and tasty coffee every time. Let’s explore the shelf life of both liquid and powdered creamers.

# Liquid Creamer Duration

Liquid coffee creamer comes in different forms, including dairy-based and non-dairy options. The duration they remain fresh varies. Here’s a general guideline:

* **Unopened Dairy-Based Creamer:** Typically lasts for 1-2 weeks past the “use-by” date when refrigerated.
* **Opened Dairy-Based Creamer:** Should be consumed within 1 week for optimal freshness.
* **Unopened Non-Dairy Creamer:** Can last up to 1 month past the “use-by” date when stored in the fridge.
* **Opened Non-Dairy Creamer:** Best used within 2 weeks of opening.

Pay attention to the packaging. Many liquid creamers come with a “use-by” or “best-by” date. These dates are a good indicator of freshness. Always store liquid creamers in the refrigerator to maintain their quality.

|Type|Unopened Duration|Opened Duration|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dairy-Based|1-2 weeks past date|1 week|
|Non-Dairy|Up to 1 month past date|2 weeks|

Remember, always check for changes in texture, smell, or color. If the creamer smells sour or has lumps, it’s time to discard it.

# Powdered Creamer Duration

Powdered coffee creamer has a longer shelf life compared to liquid creamer. This makes it a convenient choice for many. Here’s a breakdown of how long you can expect it to last:

* **Unopened Powdered Creamer:** Often lasts up to 1-2 years when stored in a cool, dry place.
* **Opened Powdered Creamer:** Best used within 6 months to maintain optimal flavor and quality.

Like liquid creamers, powdered creamers also come with “best-by” dates. These dates help you know how long the product will stay fresh. Always store powdered creamer in a sealed container to prevent moisture from getting in.

|Type|Unopened Duration|Opened Duration|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Powdered Creamer|1-2 years|6 months|

Watch for signs of spoilage. If the powder clumps or has an off smell, it’s best to discard it. Keeping your powdered creamer sealed and dry will ensure it lasts as long as possible.

Coffee creamer can make your morning brew extra delicious. But how long does it stay fresh? Knowing the signs of spoilage can help you avoid a bad experience. Let’s dive into the visual indicators and the smell and taste test to see if your coffee creamer is still good.

# Visual Indicators

Checking the visual appearance of your coffee creamer is the first step. **Pay attention to these signs**:

* **Color Change:** Fresh creamer has a consistent color. If it looks darker or yellowish, it’s likely spoiled.
* **Texture:** Spoiled creamer may appear chunky or have lumps. Fresh creamer is smooth and uniform.
* **Separation:** If you see liquid separating from the creamer, this is a bad sign. Separation indicates spoilage.

Here is a simple table to summarize these visual indicators:

|Indicator|Fresh Creamer|Spoiled Creamer|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Color|Consistent, creamy|Darker, yellowish|
|Texture|Smooth, uniform|Chunky, lumpy|
|Separation|None|Liquid separates|

**Always check the expiration date** on the packaging. Even if it looks fine, expired creamer can be unsafe.

# Smell And Taste Test

The next step is the smell and taste test. **Use your senses to detect spoilage**:

1. **Smell:** Fresh creamer has a pleasant, creamy aroma. If it smells sour, off, or has a strong odor, it’s bad.
2. **Taste:** Take a small sip to test the flavor. Fresh creamer tastes smooth and creamy. If it tastes sour, bitter, or strange, it is not safe to use.

Here are some quick tips for the smell and taste test:

* **Smell first**, taste only if it passes the smell test.
* **Use caution**: If in doubt, throw it out.

Smell and taste are powerful tools. They can help you decide if your coffee creamer is still good. **Trust your senses** to avoid any unpleasant surprises.

That if two people truly cared for each other, they’d figure it out. After 10 years of marriage and a divorce I never saw coming, I now know how painfully naive that was. The love was real, but it wasn’t enough.

The first time I realized we were in trouble wasn’t during a big fight. It was on a random Tuesday, sitting across from each other at dinner, and realizing we had nothing to say. Silence, once comfortable, now felt like a void. The little things—like him bringing me coffee in the mornings—had stopped. Resentment quietly replaced gratitude. I felt alone even when we were together. And by the time we acknowledged it, we were already too far gone.

After the divorce, I spiraled. Therapy and working with a relationship coach pulled me out of it. And let me tell you—there’s so much no one warns you about when it comes to love, commitment, and keeping a relationship from dying in slow motion. Here’s what I wish I knew before it was too late:

* **Your nervous system decides who you love—not your logic.** Ever wonder why you're drawn to certain people even when they’re bad for you? That’s not compatibility, it’s familiarity. If you grew up with instability, your body might mistake anxiety for passion. Safe love can feel “boring” at first, but it’s the kind that lasts.
* **Emotional bids are everything.** Every time your partner reaches out—whether it’s a joke, a comment, or a random story—they’re making an emotional bid for connection. Ignoring these (even accidentally) erodes intimacy over time. Dr. John Gottman found that couples who ""turn toward"" each other’s bids 86% of the time stay together. The ones who don’t? Divorce.
* **You’re not fighting about the dishes.** Arguments are rarely about what they seem. That fight about dirty plates? It’s about feeling unappreciated. That argument about texting back late? It’s about feeling unimportant. Dig deeper before you react.

Books were my saving grace post-divorce. My coach had me read so much that I swear I could get an honorary psychology degree. These five changed my entire perspective on love:

 **- ""**[***The 7 Principles for Making Marriage Work***](https://befreed.ai/book/the-seven-principles-for-making-marriage-work-by-john-m-gottman)**"" by John Gottman** \- Written by Dr. John Gottman, one of the most respected relationship researchers in the world and the founder of the Gottman Institute. He can predict divorce with 90% accuracy based on how couples argue. If you want to understand what makes love last, read this.

 **- ""**[***Nonviolent Communication***](https://befreed.ai/book/nonviolent-communication-by-marshall-b-rosenberg)**"" by Marshall Rosenberg** \- Turns out, most of us were never taught how to express our needs without blaming or attacking. This book is a game-changer.

 **- ""**[***How to Do the Work***](https://befreed.ai/book/how-to-do-the-work-by-nicole-lepera)**"" by Dr. Nicole LePera** \- If you want to heal childhood wounds that are messing up your relationships, this is a must-read.

 **- ""**[***The Mastery of Love***](https://befreed.ai/book/the-mastery-of-love-by-don-miguel-ruiz-with-janet-mills)**"" by Don Miguel Ruiz** \- A spiritual and psychological deep dive, it’s one of the best books I’ve ever read on breaking free from fear-based relationships. A must-read for anyone looking to cultivate real, unconditional love.

 **- ""*****Attached*****"" by Amir Levine & Rachel Heller** \- The #1 bestseller in relationship psychology. If you’ve ever wondered why you fall into the same relationship cycles, this book will blow your mind. 

TLDR: I used to think love was about grand gestures. Now I know it’s built in the tiny, ordinary moments—responding to a text, asking how their day was, choosing patience over sarcasm. If I had truly understood this earlier, maybe things would’ve turned out differently.

I presented myself 10 minutes early, she arrived on time. 

She requested for a plain water substituting both food and drink. I ordered a matcha and a sweet treat. 

She anxiously averted her eyes down, her nails grating into her palm. I looked into her directly as if she was clear shards of glass. 

A lingering sickly scent of smoke radiated off her. Violently crawling down my throat as the harsh tar irritated my nose lining. 

My tight corset loudly accentuated my curves, her dark baggy shirt choked itself over her self neglected frail body. 

Her face dull and worn similarly to her clothes. Whereas my products concealed the cutting familiarity we shared. 

She told me I was pretty, I responded the same. Her face distorted to a light discomfort upon the retrieval of my words expressed. 

She had a suppressed fragile voice. My responses echoed from wall to wall in comparison. 

I offered her a spoon of my dessert, holding it to her mouth. Her face soured and she declined with little thought. 

She excused herself for the 3rd ciggerette again, the last one she promised herself. An attempt to pause the overbearing hunger. 

I finished my last bite, the satisfactory sweetness coated my mouth and nourished me. I wished her well and left. 

I pray we never come close to crossing paths again.

1iujqnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1iujqnx/crazy_online_dates/,Crazy online dates,"I’m not pretty. I have been overweight 180LB’s, and very tomboyish. Dress in bagging sweatshirts, t-shirts and jeans. When I was single, I didn’t go out much. I’m very geeky and introverted and I don’t have friends my siblings where and are my only friends. 

So meeting people was hard and difficult for me since I rarely hung out with people and rarely went out places. I feel uncomfortable walking into stores feeling like I’m out of place. I have issues I know. So I tried online dating. Man. Was I not prepared for the crazy people that would message me. I was 23-24 at the time. My profile was simple a female, nerd/geek who also knows how to shoot guns. A few photos of me shooting guns in Alaska, cute selfies, and maybe a group family photos I can’t recall. 

So one day I got a message from this guy, he said he knew some of the people I larp with. (Live action role play) basically renfair clothes and fighting with foam padded sticks. His photos looked off but I thought maybe it was okay to meet. I picked out this new coffee shop close to my apartment. It looked like a bar inside but was cute and cozy. When I got there I ordered coffee and sat in a booth with my notebook. I brought it just in case I got stood up, so I wouldn’t seem out of place or awkwardly sit at the table. The barista came over and told me once they closed they’d be having a game night and invited me to join them. I was surprised and was excited thinking that was nice and sounded fun. 

Immediately I kinda hoped I’d be
Stood up so I could stay and play games make friends. But not my luck. 

My date arrived, to be honest I wasn’t attracted to him, and didn’t find him as my type. He looked nothing like his photos. He was wearing a band t-shirt with holes in it, missing teeth, and had an off smell to him. I tried to be nice and polite as he sat and began to talk about our mutual friends. But soon the conversation started to turn uncomfortable as be began to tell be about horrible trama that happen to him as a kid. I tried politely ending our date, saying I had places to be. Walking out of the coffee house I headed to my car I told him to drive safe. That when he told me he took the bus to get there. I felt bad.
It was late and I didn’t think the buses would still be running so I offered to drop him off at his home. I know not smart but I felt bad and guilty and sometimes I’m too nice. It gets me in trouble. 

He get into my car and starts telling me directions, the sun has set and it’s dark as we pull up to a few warehouse buildings outside of town. My alarm bells screamed at me that this was dangerous and stupid. So as I pull up to one of these buildings there are guys under the outside warehouse smoking. I park and can see a warehouse door slightly opened. I side where inflated bouncy castles, with blankets and pillows inside. My they guy got out of my car thanking me for the ride. I realized then I’d just been on a date with a homeless man, who lived slept in a bouncy castle in the warehouse he worked for with these other men. I noped it out of there quick and sent him a message telling him I thought it better we never meet again. 

I could be an a-hole for that but that was not what I was looking for. 

My second online date story was also unfortunate. He was cute, and seemed nice so we met at the park and took a walk talking. Jurassic World just came out in theaters and we decided to binge watch the other movies at my apartment before watching the new one in theaters. I thought this was a good idea and I kinda like the guy. However our movie afternoon date did not go as planned. He bring over the dvd and We start watching the first movie. Not 10-20 minutes into the movie does he start coughing. I pause looking at him wondering if it’s because of my Dog he shakes his head and tells me he thinks we need to go to the Emergency room. 

I drive him to the ER and he tells the nurse everything, but then his voice is completely gone. The nurse keeps asking him questions and he couldn’t talk. So.. I began repeating what he had said to the first nurse. We eventually are taken into the back where I’ve now become his personal communicator. He had no family in state, his boss was his only emergency contact. I felt bad for him. So soon a third nurse comes in. I speak for the guy. The nurse leaves saying I’m a great girlfriend. I’m uncomfortable since this is only our second date. The doctor comes I again repeat the information to the doctor. Turns out the guys tonsils were swollen making so bad he couldn’t speak. 

They gave him two options a pill to swallow (seemed silly and stupid since the guy can’t barely talk) and then a shot. He chose option two, I tried to leave the room but he grabbed my hand pleading with me to stay. I reluctantly did. For one I am highly needle phobic, I hate hospitals, can’t look at needles I get freaked out. Two this wasn’t a shot in the arm, shoulder leg.. no this was a shot on the butt cheek. We had barely kissed earlier before all of this happened. 

So there ai was holding his hand trying not to watch him get a shot in his butt cheek. Then he falls asleep in a hospital bed, I’m sat in a chair trying to decide if I can afford to leave or not. We drove my car to the hospital and I didn’t want to abandon him. I was at least grateful I had the next day off. Had…. That was until my manager called me at 3 am. I’m still sitting in the chair at his bed side, the morning cashier called out at work. No one else answer or is willing to work. I liked this manager but explain my situation. She begged me to come in whenever I could. I told her I’d try. A few minutes later we left the hospital I drove back and told him I had to run to work. He took off in his truck, I got changed and headed to work tired and sleep deprived. 

Let’s just say I was drained and put off by everything that happened. I met him at a fast food place parking lot gave him back his dvds and told him that it wasn’t probable gonna work out. Just it was a lot to happen and I felt like fates or something was trying to end me a sign. I have a few other bad date stories, from online one of a date with a doctor. Another weird phone call with someone from Texas a little too into his pet. A Marshall arts instructor. 

I have a story of my co-workers trying to get me to date a kind weird/socially awkward guy. That’s including my soon to be fiancee.So let me know if you want to hear more.

I’m easing into it, started doing 12:12 this past Sunday and loving it so far! Goal for me is weight loss, I’ve been in a 500+cal deficit and working out 5+ days a week for 3 months now and am only down ~10lbs. I have a strong inkling that this may be due to insulin resistance which I show multiple symptoms of, and heard IF is a great way to fix this issue. 

I’d like to work my way up to 16:8 (or potentially a 5:2 split, need to read into it more) in the next 2-4 weeks, but wanted to seek guidance and hear about others experience before creating my own structure. 

I work 50 or so hours a week in restaurants. My workdays start between 1 and 3pm usually and end between 11p and 2am. I’ve structured my workouts to come after, so I usually workout from ~1-3am. My current eating window is 3:30p-3:30a. This works well bc it allows me to eat family meal (work food) with my coworkers, dinner at the end of my shift, and then usually a protein source right after my workout. If I move to a 16:8, I’ll likely stop eating at 11:30 instead. 

What is everyone’s experience with working out during their fasting period? I do a Pilates warmup, then strength training, then liss cardio 6 days a week right now. Many have told me strength training while fasting isn’t beneficial and increases stress levels, but I’ve also heard fasted cardio has good benefits. Should I maybe try to limit strength training to days I can do it close to/within my eating window? 

In addition, I know 0cal sweeteners are not counted as breaking a fast on this sub, but does anyone have experience with them causing increased cravings? I’d like to add monk fruit to my coffee/tea if I can but am still definitely affected by hunger. I also read that they can cause a cephalic phase release of insulin, along with smelling/seeing food. As someone who sees/smells food often during my fast period, should I be concerned about this affecting my goal of insulin control? Thanks for any guidance provided!

I took a pregnancy test which I’m not sure if I did it 100% correct cause I tried to do straight on the stream instead of collecting a sample and like 2 hours after drinking two cups of black coffee (which I didn’t considered at the time of the test cause I was feeling anxious) and it went everywhere and I don’t think I peed enough for the whole 5 seconds after dying the strip as the instructions asked.

Should I do another test? If so how long should I wait? 

I’m kinda confused cause I only had to do pregnancy tests twice over my 8yo relationship, one during a high stress moment in 2019 and the other during 2020 cause I was having anxiety induced vomiting (at the time I wasn’t even late, the doctor made tests cause he was sure I was pregnant even tho I was sure I wasn’t lol) because of the pandemic but besides that is extremely rare for me to be late and I’m actually not stressed at all currently but the test say it’s 99% accurate (I thought I bought one of the digital ones but it was a regular one if that makes any difference) so idk

Thank you all for the encouragement I met him kind of last minute planned today ! (We were both busy on the schedule a bit)

Here’s some context I met him at a bar last weekend and only got a quick glance of him then exchanged numbers. We met 3pm for coffee and walked around the beach till 8pm and I ended it since it’s too long.

We didn’t talk anything sexual, there was hand holding, kiss on cheeks and hands ONLY(these are so surprising for me since I’m so used to be sexualized )he waited the uber for me hug goodbye and that’s all, he did not mention anything going back to his place or anything else.

I would assume if we spent from 3pm to 8pm it would mean it’s a good date right ? But he’s also kind of an old soul and very polite, we only stopped once to grab happy hour drinks. 

He’s so fine girls, with tats , good fashion taste has a nice job , polite ! 

He complimented my outfits and he approached me because he thought I was cute and has a good fashion sense and such(again I’m so used to being sexualized and reading the comments I’m giving a big virtual hug to our girlies). But idk I really hope it goes well because to him he keeps mentioning it’s a good date. I hope to stay in touch with him but if he doesn’t text again it’s okay too! I’m just happy that you guys made me take this step out of my comfort zone, I rarely get approached and the only thing I get approached is usually their friend is talking to my friend or they want sex obviously 🥹.

1iujdpq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iujdpq,"OTD in 2008, YV1449, a Santa Bárbara Airlines ATR 42-300, under Flight 518, crashed into a hillside on the side of a mountain northwest of Alberto Carnevalli Airport in Mérida, Venezuela, taking the lives of all 43 passengers and 4 crew members aboard.","The cockpit voice recorder (CVR/""black box"") was successfully recovered from the wreckage. Preliminary information released on 28 July 2008, indicates the crew departed Mérida with inoperative navigation equipment and subsequently became disoriented in the mountainous terrain surrounding the airport, crashing into the side of a mountain while trying to determine their location. Subsequent investigation concluded that the pilots took off without conducting the mandatory pre-flight procedures and used an unauthorised departure route.


A report by LagAd Aviation determined that the cause of the accident was the omission or improper use of the checklists and procedures critical to the operation of the flight, causing the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) to not be initialized prior to the take-off roll. The pilots wanted to meet the schedule after experiencing some delays, including losing track of time while having coffee in the terminal, then finding that the passengers were already on board the plane. 

The time pressure was a factor that led the pilots to omit the use of the checklists and perform the pre-takeoff so fast that it was impossible to perform the necessary verification procedures to ensure safety. The second cause of the accident was the decision to take off when they had already become aware that the AHRS was inoperative, due to the overconfidence of the pilots, as the captain had avoided catastrophe on a previous flight when proceeding without AHRS from the same airport.

 From the moment power is turned on, the aircraft must sit stationary for 180 seconds for the AHRS to synchronize its settings, which is not an issue given how long the pilots will take to complete their checklists; instead, these pilots rushed their checklist, skipped some steps, and knowingly chose to begin their take-off rather than wait an additional 28 seconds for the AHRS to be synchronized. Flying without the AHRS meant that the pilots could not maintain the correct heading in the limited visibility of clouds on their ascent.

1iujcwb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iujcwb,(Ebon Hawk build) The Umbral Kestrel - A Falkland x Stryker Engineering Collaboration.,"Taking inspiration from the Dynamic-class freighters from a universe far, far away. Stryker Engineering have been wracking their collective brains to bring an old relic into the modern day. Known for their unparalleled level of customisation, each dynamic freighter was tailored to the needs of the pilot who commissioned them. Each Dynamic was built with a one-off custom shop mentality. Because of this, what would be considered a “stock Dynamic loadout” was frustratingly difficult to find. 

With the arrival of Falkland Systems, Stryker saw an opportunity to revisit the Dynamic due the striking resemblance of Falkland’s flagship model, the Swift. The Swift’s stock layout closely tallied with Stryker’s own internal research. After a lively conversation over coffee and comparing notes, Falkland offered to collaborate with Stryker to bring this old legend back to life. 

Deep in the bowels of Stryker’s star yard was a derelict Dynamic. Its transponder identified it as the Silver Zephyr, but what was preserved told a different story.

The name of this legendary freighter is lost to history, but the many spot repairs and modifications of the ship told of a storied history. 

Falkland’s own research into this legendary vessel amounted to as much. So much so that Falkland offered to supply their proprietary update habitation units for the cause. 

After much trial and error, the newly christened Umbral Kestrel takes to the skies.

The Kestrel exclusively sports Falkland’s Hab units, with the only change being the removal of the port side botany station for ease of access to the captain’s quarters. 

The Portside entry point splits between the docking bay, crew Hab, and the main hold.

The starboard side sports a workshop Hab next to the armory where the Rev 8 accompanies the various work benches. 

Armaments include the Thrax guns that come standard with Falkland. An addition is the half barrel missile launcher on each side for some extra punch through ship armor. 

Weather it’s charging into a Crimson Fleet battalion, or exploring unknown regions, the Umbral Kestrel will get the job done in style.


——————————————————


The Umbral Kestrel is my latest Ebon Hawk build. Hjalmere did the community a solid with Falkland Systems. This set the bar for what a paid mod should be. 

The call backs to the inspiration are tasteful, and the main hold (the 2x3 living quarters centrepiece) is chefs kiss. It’s like I’m back in the Hawk in KOTOR. 

The edits I made on the wings were mostly a callback to my previous build, the Umbral Dawn. I’ve done my best as usual to keep the layout consistent with the source material. I’ve crammed a number of micro-modules (mod) to supplement the existing shields, grav drive, and reactor output of the ship. Further tweaks (Avontech, and micro modules) were made for a hidden engine and cargo capacity.

Mod list (from what I can remember) are as follows 

Avontech (hidden engine)
Micro modules (practically all ship systems)
Decorative parts (cargo)

1iujc6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Needafriend/comments/1iujc6q/34m_longing_for_intense_and_deep_connection_and/,[34/M] - Longing for intense and deep connection and seeking the casual chat that leads to it,"Hello!

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1740115130.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False

I know everyone to an extent is more confident as a child, that just comes with being innocent to all of the darkness in the world, but I feel like I was on the path to being 1v but had the rug pulled right out from under me. Don't mistake this for a self pitying ""guess theres nothing I can do about it"" post or anything, just more of an introspective one. Regardless of any typology I want to be the best person I can be and do by others of course.

  
I was very happy as a young child, and I never shied from speaking my mind and I was VERY opinionated, completely secure in myself and everything I believed.  My worth has always been somewhat contingent with others view of me (sx/so), but I started out with having a sense of worth outside of others. Most of all I KNEW what I wanted to be in life. From even when I was five I always knew exactly that i wanted to be a ""freelance artist."" I was very ""industrious"" as my mom described. I didn't wait for people to tell me ""yes"" to do things. When I was around 7 I opened a coffee shop in my moms bussiness. (By coffee shop I mean I would sell a cup of over sweetened coffee for a dollar by asking literally person in the building individually if they wanted to buy one, and I drew up posters and put them on the wall.)  My mom said no matter how many times I got told no (which was a lot) it would never deter me or make me any less excited about my ""bussiness"".  And I was always up to something.

 It started going down hill about after I turned eight, my life got a lot more chaotic for a lot of reasons near entirely related to my fathers presence in my life and I became so extremely insecure. Insecure, yet feeling superority about certain things. (example; drawing, and emotional maturity; ironically i wasnt well stocked at either of those skills). I wasn't very nice either. Not one of the worst bullies or sickeningly cruel, but at the same time it did make me feel better to be mean to other kids for whatever reason, even my friends at time. I don't exactly know why but I guess it was all the hatred and lack of control I felt in myself was let out by my treatment of others. Or maybe I was just miserable and mean, idk..  I feared consequences very heavily but not just the punishments but the humiliation that came with them, being seen as a bad person or a lesser person filled me with so much dread because it just affirmed my already negative view of myself.  An example story I have I was very young, likely younger than eight. I was staying over at my fathers, and while I won't say to much he was not a good man. He spoiled me and enabled me but quickly took everythng away if i disagreed with him and constantly fed me lies about the other side of my family, typical narciscistic behavior. A lot more stuff but like I said I won't waste your time. I'm sure I learned deflecting blame from him though. We had a cat at his house, I didn't torture it or anything close to that but I didn't handle it gently. It was like a doll in my eyes, I wanted it to do things with me like it was my friend. Now, this would be really simple to handle if your child does this. Just reprimand them and explain that cats are living creatures and you can't always make them do what you want. But I think my father was scared to, he spent all his time villainizing my mom for being a good parent so if he set any rules he'd lose the only thing he had over her, and he was also the very insecure in relationships type, long story short  he never did. And so when the cat didn't want me to pick her up I'd lie and say she just didn't like me. My brother caught me on this and said something like , ""no, she doesn't want you to pick her up because you handle her too roughly."" I remember in that moment being very afraid and doubling down on my lie, and my father proceeded to back me up on it. And that pattern just got worse.   
As I got older(8-12) the feeling of rejection became so incredibly painful that I would block out the pain by deflecting it on others, lying to myself to ease the guilt, then still hating myself despite it. I've always been fiercly independent but before my life got more hectic I think it came from actual independence and self confidence where as later it became more repulsion at being looked down upon.

I've of course changed a lot sense I was nine, and you can probably tell that I still feel contempt for how I behaved, but even though, now, my first instinct is to intetnalize both my negative emotions and blame instead of casting them to the world; I feel my insecurity about myself has spread. At nine it was mostly contained to my appearance and how others perceived me as a person in all facets, but now I find there isn't one thing I am not doubting my ability in. That is something that originally turned me away from the 3v description because I was just thinking of how I am now rather than the past. Presently there are parts of the 3v description I do not resonate with, \*\*as the person I am currently.\*\*

Examples; I'm not one to blame circumstance/other people for my personal failures. I see myself as completely responsible for my actions and what transpires. One of my brothers went way off the deep end and started blaming my mother for every flaw he had and all the bad things in our family. And even though my mother wasn't perfect, no parent is and she is only human. I promise this isnt just my youngest child privelage speaking, my mother was not a bad mother she's the strongest most selfless woman I've ever met. Despite my inclination to introspect and joy I get from learning why I am how I am, I've don't blame my flaws on my upbringing or people. The closest thing I can think of it being mad at my father, but even then I am justified in that and still recognize where I went wrong, the difference between acknowledging and pointing fingers. - Even though it still stirs a lot of anger inside of me when I am looked down on, I dont think my reasoning for my independence is just that. I feel in my heart that same fire described in 1v to make descisions for myself because I believe its my absolute right and that I know what I want and need more than anyone. I'm an independent thinker and I don't like excessive structure.  - I do have the seven optimism/trust in myself even if I don't feel secure all the time. I feel my true self believes I can do anything, even though other times I feel i will never be anything I still have that passion I feel in my chest that doesnt go away. - Although I doubt my skills I never doubt my sense of morality, justice, how others should be treated, or even opinions I feel strongly. I don't doubt them and I am willing to stand behind them If I need to. - Although I fear for social reputation still I would never throw any of my friends under the bus for social safety, I don't relate to the disloyaly and flakiness in the description. Even when I was younger although for minor things I would pull the ""But teacher I was actually trying to stop them he did it not me!! (lying)"" I was still extremely loyal to certain people, espesially ones I thought to be wrongfully chastized, like my father. (this can be mainly attrubuted to sx instinct probably) - I am not self victimizing and am so disgusted by the idea that I am overly cautious about doing so.  - I also do truly love people and feel a lot of pro social  feeling from helping them. I have always had the desire to be good, even when I wasn't. Thats why I had to lie to myself in the first place, because the guilt of not being ""good"" was so crushing that I was too scared to face it. And being good IS more important to me than being seen as good.

What should I do?,"Some years ago, I did the only occult ritual I've ever intentionally done, just because a pagan channel I followed suggested honoring Thor with a ritual that day, and I figured, why not? I brought a speaker, some black coffee, and went to the foot of my favorite tree in some woods that are in-between my neighborhood and a cemetary. I made a thurisaz rune in the leaves with a stick, poured the coffee on it, and said a little prayer, asking Thor for strength. I started playing some alpha affirmations with the speaker and meditated at the base of the tree as the sun set behind the horizon. Soon, I remembered that I hadn't worked out that day, so I got into pushup position, and as soon as I was about to do a rep, my speaker lost power while a large branch simultaneously broke further down the trail to my left, behind me. The speaker never had a red light indicating that it was at low power, it just shut off. I immediately got up, said that I respect a home for all good things, put my jacket back on and got my belongings, and left. I've had other paranormal experiences there before, usually at night, but ever since then, whenever I go in those woods alone, I hear a large branch snap somewhere, regardless of the time of day.

Is it something I summoned (such as Thor, or a demon), a territorial ghost from the nearby cemetary, or a territorial fae? If I summoned it, how do I dismiss it so it doesn't feel the need to keep haunting those woods???",0,1740115010.0,Paranormal,8,0.45,False

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way.

1iuja1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iuja1g/coffee_inconsistent_and_tastes_bad_breville/,Coffee inconsistent and tastes bad [Breville Barista Pro & DF54 grinder],"Hi, I'm a bit of a novice to coffee making but trying to get better! I've had a breville barista pro for approx 4 years now. I used it on and off through the years but always would give up on it. I've done all the reading and research there is and was still struggling getting decent and consistent coffee from it.

Wanting to get back into making my own coffee and after doing much research, I ended up buying a separate grinder - the DF54. I also got a Normcore calibrated spring loaded tamper incase that was contributing to my issues (I have it set at the pre loaded 25 pound springs). I did find the coffee to be slightly better not using the breville grinder but I'm still not happy with it.

I've dialed in the grinder so I'm getting approx 36g output with 17g of coffee within 25-35 seconds (I find when I do 18g it spills over, is messy and hard to tamp). When I move the grinder slightly either way (even just 1 number or so), it either chokes or gushes out, there's not a lot of wiggle room where I can get a decent flow.

Sometimes I get a coffee that's actually pretty decent, then I'll do everything the exact same the next day and it's terrible.

I'm using local freshly roasted medium beans and store them in a air tight coffee canister. I've gone through so many expensive bags of coffee and still can't get this right. I've watched every YouTube video, read so many threads.. I don't know what I'm doing wrong?? I know coffee can be quite an art form that takes practice, but after spending hours and $$ I feel like I'm missing something here but can't work it out.

I've spent quite a lot on my set up and most days I'm still going out buying coffee because mine is undrinkable for the most part.

Can someone please advise me? Tips, tricks, any help would be very appreciated!!",2,1740114928.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Unfortunately, the company requires a lot of flexibility, which makes it hard for me to get another job, and this barely covers my bills.

Back home in the Philippines, I worked in call centers and the F&B industry, but landing a full-time job here has been tough. 

I’ve applied to several places, but either they’re not hiring full-time or want more experience in the US.

For those who’ve been in a similar situation, how did you navigate this?

 Any advice on finding a stable job or full time.

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.

* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1740114245.0,InternetFriends,0,1.0,False
1iuj2py,https://i.redd.it/2jh7ewxzcfke1.jpeg,"🅲 🅰 🆁 🅰 🅼 🅴 🅻 : A Drizzle of Molten Gold & A Kiss Of Caramel—Theodorous Kalotinis Caramel Oud, A comprehensive review 👇🏼","(Pc: A bit uninspiring, but resonates with the scent) 

 #Theodoros Kalotinis 

⭕️Theodoros Kalotinis is a Greek artisan perfumer from Heraklion, Crete. His journey to becoming a self-made perfumer is a testament to his hard work and skill, ultimately leading him to secure a personal patent for his unique fragrances. With a thirst for knowledge, he refined his craft in Grasse and studied cosmetology at a Greek university. 

⭕️Later in 2014, established the first Greek house of artisanal perfume. There is a story of how Vogue & Elle characterise him as “The king of Gourmand”, rightfully so, he has a knack to capture photorealistic scents of desserts. A title that may be self-proclaimed, but I'll let you decide how fitting it truly is. However, the brand truly blossomed in 2018 when Theodoros had the honor of creating personal perfumes for none other than King Charles and Queen Camilla. This royal endorsement catapulted his reputation, and since then, the brand has gradually expanded its presence around the globe

##Collections 
According to Fragrantica, there are a total of about 28 releases from Theodoros Kalotinis, although I found 24 fragrances currently listed on their website. These fragrances are categorized into two collections:

**+Eau de Parfum Collection** — 17 releases, offering an affordable range of fragrances.

**+Golden Secret Collection** — 7 releases, representing a premium selection.

#Caramel Oud 

This is a photorealistic caramel glazed sweet fragrance with an unconventional oud twist. 

##Packaging & Presentation 

🎁 Just love the minimalistic approach the brand took with the packaging. The 50ml bottle comes in a sleek black paperboard box adorned with white fonts displaying the brand name, concentration, and size details. A sticker seal covers the top of the box, featuring the fragrance name. 

🎁 The bottle itself is a simple cuboidal design made of generic glass, topped with a somewhat flimsy cap, and it features black, minimalistic label. The atomizer works adequately, though its spray and distribution might not match those of many commercial brands.

###Concentration : Eau de Parfum 

##Perfumer  
###☀️Theodoros Kalotinis 

In introduction of this review, we've covered much of Theodoros Kalotinis’s  journey and his work. For those interested in learning more about his inspirations and the habit that kindled his passion for perfumery, visit his website. It may offer a deeper understanding of his vision. 

His most notable fragrances includes 
1. Coffee Addict 
2. Alluring Fig
3. Tobacco Maniac 

##Fragrance Profile 

Think about a cliched mass pleasing sweet gourmand scent, this is exactly that, but what makes this stand out is the use of the medicinal oud accord. 

##Notes Breakdown 

   [x] Caramel✔️        [x] Oud✔️

   [x] Toffee✔️            [x] Saffron✔️

Not a complex breakdown, one can easily identify all the notes that are aforementioned. There are no hidden nuances or facets, everything is kept super linear & simple. 

#How it smells? 

🍮 The opening burst is a bit jumbled & honestly confusing, the synthetic nature of the fragrance doesn’t allow itself to smell close to anything familiar. It takes a brief moment & settles to a stable profile, the oud accord & caramel takes the centre stage. The fragrance doesn’t evolve much, but makes up for it with its photorealistic accords. 

🍮 The oud accord utilised here is quite contemporary, you can find similar accords in many modern fragrances. Not a natural smelling one, it’s the woody—balsamic—faintly animalic accord with a little spiciness thanks to the saffron. Don’t get me wrong, this is not a natural smelling oud at all, but will remind you of medicinal oud cent percent. It’s a generic oud accord we encounter in thousand different fragrances. 

🍮 The caramel, where to even begin, this is the generic caramel accord we would have exposed a million times, but still, it’s more realistic & that’s what makes it more appealing. This is an overdose of Ethyl maltol, vanillin, furfural & more, just like any other basic gourmand, just a touch more real. There is some amount of nuttiness & caramalized aroma, which comes across like toffee, which amplifies the experience. 

🍮 The base is made of synthetic musk, which supports the fragrance pretty well. In the far dry down the oud accord completely dissipates & leaves us only the aroma of a caramel toffee. The fragrance doesn’t display too much complexity or layers of nuances, rather it’s just what it says on the label. 

##Undecorated Breakdown 
A generic oud accord with a little spiciness from saffron, cleverly combined with a photorealistic caramel toffee accord. The fragrance is completely synthetic & doesn’t evolve much. 

###Heres what people of fragrantica think about Caramel Oud :

>One fraghead mentions “its not complicated scent, imagine how caramel smells and add deep oud to it”

>Another says “The oud in this is pleasant and wearable. Caramel seems to take a back seat and I don't get any toffee”.

>One more says “Way too cloying for me”. 

>Another one mentions “Don’t go in believing that this is an edible, caramel dessert because you will be misled” 

>Lastly, one mentions “The most terrible smell. The smell of stomach acid and strawberry yogurt” 

I kinda agree with every review, don’t know about the last one. I don’t even remotely know what that person smelled. 

#Performance 
##Longevity 
🌕🌕🌕🌕🌑 — This has an excellent longevity, the synthetic & sweet nature of it just clings to your skin & garments, just refuses to leave. Less is more with this one, can easily get cloying & suffocating. 

##Projection 
🌕🌕🌕🌗🌑 — This has a moderate projection, envelopes you with a strong scent bubble, you will be noticed even if you don’t want to. 

##Compliment-factor 
🌕🌕🌕🌑🌑 — The oud can be a dealbreaker for some, but honestly if you look past that, it’s just a generic caramel fragrance. It is mass pleasing & can garner a lot of compliments, but the weather/conditions you wear this in plays a crucial role. I can see people loving it for the smell & hating it cuz it’s too cloying & powerful. 

##When & Where, For Whom? 

☃️ Weather / conditions you wear this determines the appeal. Wear it in summers, you may suffocate yourself or the person next to you. Wear it in colder temperatures, people will be asking you left & right “what’s your fragrances?”. 

☃️ It is not a formal smelling fragrance, it doesn’t demand you to dress a certain way, it wears easy & can be worn anywhere. There is no appropriate place for this one, a night time event, celebrations, parties & long walks at the beach, whatever wherever.  As long as the temperature is right, you are golden. 

☃️ This is a unisex fragrance & most of the reviews say that it smells masculine. But I beg to differ, only the opening with that strong oud accord comes across masculine, after it dries down it smells equally feminine. 

##Similarities with other fragrances 

This is extremely similar to few of his other creations, the most striking one is his, ***“Coffee addict”.***

Few other ones includes : 

+  Amore Caffè

+  Khamrah 

And a few more mass marketed gourmands. 

#Verdict 

🏅 This is a synthetic fragrance through & through, but has a certain charm. It smells incredibly photorealistic & can be incredibly appealing. 

🏅 It starts with a strong oud accord, which can be a deal breaker, but dries down to a sweet caramel toffee aroma, it’s so sweet, you might wanna worry about diabetes. 

🏅 It is an excellent performer, don’t even worry about it. Just be mindful of the temperature you are wearing this in, the colder the better. 

🏅 This is flat, doesn’t jump off your skin, just sticks to it. Doesn’t display any level of complexity, it just does what it says on the label, nothing more & nothing less. 


##TL;DR : 

A photorealistic caramel fragrance with a non contemporary oud accord with an amazing performance. ",6,1740114228.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,4,1.0,False

You got stuck in a time loop. Unfortunately, your life is so mundane and boring, that you haven't noticed.

# Story -

*The alarm next to the bed screamed at you to wake up. Every morning it did the same thing. 6:00am on the dot.*

*Rolling out of bed, the familiar cracks and pops of your body echo in the quiet and dark room. Sleep had been difficult, but it always had been difficult. Shuffling across the carpet, into the kitchen where you promptly turn back and grab the slippers you always seem to forget. That floor was cold, shocking your body every morning.*

*You remind yourself to invest in some kitchen rugs as the dark roasted coffee pours into your favorite mug. You smile a bit, reading the quip that had been painted onto the side of it. Something about how rough Mondays were. You used this mug every day, even when it wasn't Monday.*

*The fresh air hits your face, watching the birds that fluttered and flew around the trees rooted in your backyard. You told yourself a long time ago that the best way to start the day was a cup of coffee, and waking up with the sun. So that's what you've done, for years it seems.*

*Once the mug is empty, you look out across the yard and wave to the black cat that makes his daily trek along the wooden fence, always stopping to look over at you.*

*The rest of the morning routine is the same as everyone else's. You nick yourself shaving, again, and pray that your shampoo has just enough left in the bottle until you can go to the store. It always does.\**

*The drive to work is short, you didn't live far from the office thankfully. You chuckle at the kid who falls down as he tries to catch the bus he missed again. Memories of when you were a child flashing through your mind.*

*The work day is easy. A string of numbers flashing across your screen as you input them into the correct spreadsheets. Your boss interrupts you to ask you how those numbers are looking.*

*You smile, and give your usual, 'They are looking beautiful as always!' phrase. Despite using this response ever since you started, he laughs with you still. Turning to walk back to his desk*

*Lunch was easy, you enjoyed a small prepackaged salad from the grocery store. It was your last one of the week, so you had made a note to get more the next time you were at store, always needing to go to the store. You took a bite, the crunch was satisfying to hear. You could listen to that every day if you chose too.*

*The end of the day came to a close, and as you went to get into your car you realized you left your keys in the office. One of these days you'll remember to grab them.*

*Back home again you could finally relax. You were hungry, but decided to wait a bit, choosing instead to scroll mindlessly on your phone before tossing it to the side*

*It was the same stuff as always. Influencers promoting the same boring products, the same news stories over and over, trends that were so similar it wasn't even worth paying attention to.*

*Dinner was supposed to be a bowl of ramen you had been thinking about on the drive home, but you forgot to go the store. The space where the noodles sat was empty. You can't remember the last time you had ramen, so the disappointment was huge.*

*Instead settling for a frozen dinner that had been buried in the freezer before stepping back out on your porch. The sunset was always beautiful, a perfect orange-red backdrop for your favorite bird to fly across\**

*The hawk flew over your head, bringing a smile to your face and you watched it circle and then fly off into the distance. It was a special moment you two shared every evening. He never failed to visit you. You hoped he would visit you every day*

*The rest of the evening was spent cleaning up, putting off the laundry that was always full off, and just turning on your tv for background noise before you crawled back into bed. Your alarm wasn't set, it was the weekend, you smiled at the thought of sleeping in.*

*The weekends always passed by so quickly it's almost like they didn't happen. As you fell asleep, you thought to yourself.*

I have no intention or thought of offing myself, so please, do not worry.

I never had much of a childhood. I am the oldest of 5 young siblings, and raised them all as far as I can remember. I never had many friends, maybe a handful, as I wasn't truly allowed to 'hang out.' I missed school events, prom, trips. Hell. Even my senior photos. I am in a single class photo in my entire yearbook. I really have no fond memories of school. 

I got a job as a barista at 17, working my ass off. I job hopped and after landing better jobs, saved up money and moved from NYC into my own place in VA. I got my first car, and things were alright. Then everything kinda just collapsed. I lost my remote job, couldn't afford rent, or utilities, or my car, or my phone. I lost my beautiful townhome. I fled with my now unpaid leased car, homeless for some time. Thankfully about 3 months ago, I am finally safe within government housing. I have a roof over my head, food stamps for food. My car is still 'stolen' but I haven't heard anything from them, and will simply await the day they come and take it. 

I haven't worked a job for almost an entire year. Sure I do Doordash and Instacart to pay my current phone bill and $20 rent fee, but otherwise, no true job. I don't even know how I'll be able to jump back into work, feeling the way I do. I have no drive. Nothing really surprises me anymore, and I look forward to nothing. 

I got into a rear-end collision on valentines day, and am so thankful the officer did not question if I had insurance; because I don't. Thankfully the at fault driver's insurance will pay total for damages, otherwise, I would have been completely stranded. But I cannot currently drive my car now, and have been housebound.. And the days just.. bleed together. I wake up, drink coffee, get on my laptop, through daylight and nightfall, then sleep anywhere from 4AM-7AM to 5PM. I need to fix my sleep schedule. But I'm struggling. I do yearn to travel; I love driving, I've taken multiple trips from NYC, to VA, to South Carolina's beautiful beaches. I plan to one day visit Alaska, and hike though beautiful, horrifying landscapes. But it just seems like such a dream.   
  
I think I'm depressed.  
I think something is wrong with me, yet I don't really know where to start.   
I feel like, I shouldn't feel this way. That there are people out there who have REAL issues, and that I'm just complaining. I just feel so bland. Unimportant.

Examples; the current cake drama on titkok calling a birthday cake is a luxury and shaming people for buying cheap wallmart cakes and people should be spending $100+ on cakes. 

Recent online argument saying a rice cooker is a privilege.

And several years ago the incident on twitter, where a couple posted about enjoying a cup of coffee together and they were attacked online for being privileged. 


Privilage and luxuries are a thing  but I see the word used many times from lower working class people to people who are also working class but maybe earn a couple of dollars more than them and can afford, something like a sandwich press. 


Why this is propaganda is. You have the top generational wealth at the top. Owning slaves, owning sex rings, owning countries. They control the world because they can afford everything. But in order to stay in control they've manipulated and allowed working class to turn on each other and gone. Your earth is dying because YOU use plastic straws. Not because I'm leaking 50litres of oil into the ocean every day. 

A lot of this comes in green washing and putting personal responsibility of moral or earth failings on the working class person. So we go yeah the earth is dying because my neighbour is driving her 2025 Honda that uses up so much fuel! Then they throw rocks at attack the neighbour because she's making $30 an hour and you're making $20. 

It's become working class people manipulated to turn onto each other. 

Or another example. Somebody getting  angry at their co worker for getting a 15 minute break while they get a 10 minute break. None of these are unfair but all of us are living in terrible conditions. But because we have been conditioned to blame the working class, our attention has turned away from the 5% of the world who are the reason we are stuck in this situation. 

We are all sitting in a volcano screaming at someone for being on a slightly higher rock and are dying slower, instead of the one who pushed us both into the volcano

Yes privileges and luxuries are a thing. But so often what we call privilege and luxuries are not those, and are often basic human rights or small tools to help us to make our life slightly easier. 

And this is all due to a lack of class conciousness. That has been manipulated on purpose by the 5%",1,1740112473.0,Discussion,0,1.0,False

Any existing relevant medical issues: None

Current medications: None

Whenever I am playing a game, on my phone, watching a movie, etc., I start to have a mixture of cataplexy and narcolepsy. I start to uncontrollably fall asleep. My head nods and my eyelids shut for a quick second. After one or two times if that i get conscious about it but I can't control it. I usually let myself fall asleep and it's for like 20ish minutes (give or take 10 minutes). I wake up, sometimes I don't even remember falling asleep, and usually just accept fate and go to bed.

I mainly eat heathly. I drink only water. Coffee is only a few times a week. I sleep solid 7-8 hours a night. I started going back to the gym.

Any other questions, I am happy to answer. I just wanted to get an idea of what to do or what this could be. It's starting to concern me, because I just want to make sure it's nothing crazy as well as it won't get any worse.

I’m curious if anyone else has experimented with this. I was today years old when I learned that caffeine can cause low estrogen in women, and with estrogen already dropping during the luteal phase, I think my levels were just extremely low. Prior to monitoring my caffeine intake I was experiencing severe anxiety/depression/mood swings and was getting terrible sleep 10-14 days before my period. Those symptoms were absent this month and I feel so much more present, calm and rested. That being said, it is my first month in years with no PMDD.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1iuiguh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1iuiguh/crush_on_a_guy_with_a_girlfriend/,Crush on a guy with a girlfriend,"I appreciate any advice!

I, 26 female, met my best friend's cousin, Adam, 5 months ago. The night we met we had the most innocent fun I've had with a guy in years. No direct flirting, just great banter and genuine interest in getting to know each other. I found out the next day he had a girlfriend of 1.5 years. 

4 months later I found out that the night I met Adam, he told my best friend something along the lines of ""damn I have a girlfriend but Hannah was so fun and cute"". (my bff didn't tell me at the time because I was freshly single and she didn't want to add drama my current situation)

A month after finding that out we went to the bar in a big group. His girlfriend wasn't there. It was the most fun I've ever had with a guy I barely know. Adam and I were drawn to each other and our personalities clicked. He didn't outright flirt with me but he did buy me drinks and we were pool partners. Another guy in the group told my best friend that he was interested in me, but could tell Adam and I were into each other so he was backing off. He also said things are rocky in Adam's current relationship.

There's an undeniable connection between us. My question is what should my next move be? Do I try to spend time with him in group settings via my best friend? Do I ask him to grab lunch one day? Do I invite him to the bars with my friends? He lives half a mile away from me and I go on walks by his house all the time. We chatted once about having the same favorite coffee shop that's right next to his house. He has no social media but we have each other's phone numbers because of a past group chat.

I'm not trying to have him cheat AT ALL. I just want to spend time with him so maybe he breaks up with his girlfriend sooner lol.

My dad says to go for what I want in life, my mom says be patient and wait it out.

The alien is here!

I held my arm around my niece’s shoulder, not wishing to let her go for another second. She was leaning into my side as we walked, not wanting to lose me either. Our reunion had her previously in tears, as she nearly squeezed the life out of me. But now, the fear of the unknown had returned to her. Her bright pink sweater was ironic considering her current mood.



The desert seemed to span on for eternity, with several ambiguous grasses and a few hills far into the distance. The sun was setting, meaning we had been in their custody for nearly twenty-four hours. It must’ve been exhausting on Hannah’s part, considering she wasn’t knocked out like me during the ride over. She likely kept herself awake during most of her time here, so I could infer she was ready for bed.



We had been given back our belongings, including my phone, but it seemed they didn’t bother to plug it in, since no matter how many times I pressed the power button it wouldn't turn on. The stuffed animal Mrs. Jones had given Hannah that night for an early 14th birthday must’ve been in good condition, considering Hannah was squeezing it with both of her arms tight into her chest. The fact it was a hedgehog plush just seemed like such a strange coincidence to me.



The agent named Williams opened the front passenger door for me, allowing me to enter the black jeep, but I refused. “I want to sit in the back with my niece, if that’s alright with you.”



He nodded, and opened the rear door behind it instead. I ushered my niece to slide all the way in to the left, before he closed the door on my right.



“Uncle Liam, where are we going?”



From the driver’s seat, the agent named Johnson answered for me. “Williams over there is going to drive your uncle’s truck to the motel. You two will be riding with me.”



“Why can’t I just follow you from behind, or better yet just give me the address?” I asked.



“Because we’re staying there too. We will both take turns watching your door through the night, in the likely case either of you two get any ideas. Mr. Smith, do you have any cash?”



“If you didn’t take any out of my wallet, then yes, I do.”



“Good, because we won’t be covering your expenses outside of the facility. You’re going to need to pay for your room.”



“Seriously?” I said, appalled. “Are you at least going to pay for my gas? It’s like five dollars a gallon here.”



“We paid for the gas on the way here. Anything in the future you will need to pay for yourself.” He said as he started to pull out of the facility’s fenced area and onto a dirt road.



After a few minutes we turned onto the highway, which seemed like a bunch of pavement that stretched on for, you guessed it, eternity. When the environment is as flat as this, the roads can get pretty bland. There aren’t any mountains or trees to make anything interesting, just a set of power lines and a few metal fences along the side of the highway.



Occasionally, we’d see another car drive by, and I just couldn’t help myself from thinking about how much they don’t know. Every soul that drives by has no idea what I've been told. The countless abductions, the attempted extermination, and those… cattle farms. When Agent Brown informed me of them, I refused to believe everything she had previously told me. I just couldn’t accept a reality where an entire Earth's worth of people were just farms of food. She had to show me a video to prove it all, and I just broke down crying. I cried for what seemed like an hour. It made me sick just recalling the video. The screaming…



My niece doesn’t know, my neighbors don’t know, the people driving by us don’t know. They have no clue that such a horrifying world exists out there, with every single breath they take, just continuing to go through their lives as if nothing was going on, as if there wasn’t a deadly war going on right now, because in their minds, it was true, nothing was going on out there. I started to reflect on my experiences.



I’ve lived through a few wars. I did this too, all the time, just going through the motions while people were dying across the globe. I felt sympathy for those who were affected, but I never really did anything, did I? What was I supposed to do, attend a rally or something? It never affected me, so I didn’t do anything. What about the agents, is the same true for them? Do they feel the same way that everyone else feels towards the conflicts on Earth? But those are so small in comparison. Will I begin to feel the same way as they do? Indifferent to all the suffering out there? Am I a bad person, for being so ignorant?



I pulled out the cross necklace from under my shirt and held it tightly. I felt a sense of guilt for the next few minutes. I continued to remain quiet, until Hannah felt the need to break the silence.



“When-” She paused, clearly shy to break it.



“What is it?” I asked.



“When… when are they going to let us go?”



“They have, dear.”



“So, I thought they were taking us to a motel? When are we actually going home?”



“I’m not sure, but I know we’re going to be staying there for a few weeks at least,” I said, quite frankly. I didn’t know how long I’d be employed by them, but I definitely thought it was going to be a long time.



“What?” She said it with surprise, though her voice was still quiet. “I thought you said they let us go?”



I nodded. “They offered me a job at their facility.”



“A-and you said yes?” I nodded once more. “You’re taking the job?”



“It’s not like that. I can trust them, I think.”



“You think?” She put her hands on the top of her head. “A giant meteor starts to fall from the sky, a-and you run up the mountains, a-and disappear for the next three quarters of an hour!” Her voice was starting to get loud. “Then, as I’m panicking on the phone, some freaking men in black appear and abduct me!”



*Hold on, was it really close to an hour? The run to the valley wasn’t long, so most of it must’ve been me performing CPR. Had I really been doing it that long?* I felt a sense of joy for a brief moment, before shoving it away. “I suppose it was a long time.”



She rubbed her face. “Yes!” I could hear tears in her voice. “The whole time I had that feeling in my gut that something had happened to you! You left your phone on the center console and the 911 operator kept telling me to wait in the truck for you! Meanwhile my Uncle Liam was just… gone! The whole time! It’s been an entire day since I saw you, and not once did they let me see you. A-and now they’re just your coworkers?” I could see her tears smeared across her face.



“I’m sorry, Hannah. Had I known that it was going to be that long, I-” I thought of what to say next. “I would’ve had you come with me, but I didn’t know if it was dangerous. You could have gotten hurt.”



“So me losing you would’ve been ok?”



“That’s not what I meant.” I countered.



“You’re all that I have left! After this, I-I’ve got no one!” The tears were beginning to roll down her face freely.



“Come here, my girl.” I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her close. “Last night was rough. But it was just one night. I promise you I won’t let something like that happen again.”



I felt her tears soaking into my shirt. “Please, please I don’t want to stay here.”



I had to agree with her. If I had the option, I would’ve said no to the job offer and had them return us to Colorado. Alas, even if they didn’t offer me the salary, I still couldn’t say no.



“I want to, but I can’t. They need me there.”



She pushed herself away from me. “What could they possibly need you for?”



The alien. It was the only reason I was staying. Yes, the money was a nice add-on, but that poor woman. To her, we are the aliens, people she had likely never seen before. We’re people she can't recognize, who are more interested in keeping her in a cage than making her feel safe.



It reminds me of my father before he passed. I was all he had left, and even then he’d get angry at the littlest things I did. Deep down, though, I knew he was grateful, he just had a hard time showing it. I know what loneliness can do to a person, and I just can’t bring myself to allow her to be alone like that, with those people.



Hannah continued. “It’s… it’s for the salary, isn’t it?”



I shook my head. “It’s much more than that, girl. There’s someone in there who-”



“Ahem.” I heard the driver in front of me interrupt our conversation. He didn't say a word, but the firm look agent Johnson gave me through the rearview mirror said it all.



“Those agents don’t seem so friendly,” said Hannah.



*That just proves my point further. I have to stay… for her.*



I let out a deep breath. “Hannah, I just want to make sure you don’t get the wrong impression. I’m doing this for the greater good. This isn’t just about yo-.” I stopped myself, but it was too late.



*WHY DID I SAY THAT?!*



I instantly regretted saying that last part. Hannah looked at me, like I just said I didn’t care for her.



“Hannah, no, please. I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that.”



She turned away from me and leaned against the window.



“Hannah, please… listen to me.”



“Whatever.” She said with an attitude. I could still hear the tears in her voice. “Just take the stupid money and I’ll be a loser at whatever high school you want it to be.”



I tried explaining myself, but to no avail. “I’m sorry. It’s just… I want you to know that I would never stop thinking about you. You were my number one concern when I was there. I didn’t say a word about what happened until I knew you were ok.”



She wasn’t paying me any attention.



“I love you, Hannah, you’re the best niece an uncle could ask for.”



She squeezed her eyes shut. “Please, just shut up. I don’t want to talk to you anymore.”



I’m only making it worse by talking. *No, I can’t, she needs me.* She needs me to allow her to let off some steam. This whole thing has probably been stressful enough for her. I just… I don’t know. What am I even doing? Why am I here? Why me?



I turned to look out of my right-side passenger window, watching the sun set over the flat, desert horizon to the west. I closed my eyes in thought.



*Please, God, just give me a sign. Tell me that I’m doing the right thing here, somehow.*



I opened my eyes, only to be greeted by the same view as before, only this time, I could see the edges of the city approaching us as we neared, with a big, neon green sign topped with a UFO and a few cow silhouettes. It said only three words.



*Welcome to Roswell*

*This brand of coffee tastes horrible when black. Now I know not to use the green box.*



When I woke up this morning, my head was aching worse than any time I could remember. I felt nauseous, confused, and not to mention Hannah was worried for my health. I wanted to tell her it was just a symptom of the brain reading thing from yesterday, but couldn’t because of the stupid rules. I still feel awful for what I said last night. I never meant it to come out that way. I just wanted to explain that I hadn’t forgotten about her, and there were bigger things out there.



That agent Williams guy is supposed to be watching her right now, but I’m not even sure if I should’ve left in the first place. I feel like a soulless monster, like something barely human. How could I have just driven away like that, after I practically ignored her? Who even am I? I’ve practically ruined her upcoming birthday, and there’s no way her friends’ parents are going to drive all the way down here. Perhaps I can find a place in the middle? No, no it’s no use. Perhaps I can request some time off for a weekend or something. I just need to find a way to make it up for her.



“Are you done with that coffee, Mr. Smith?”



I looked up at Agent Brown. “Yeah, yeah I am.”



“I hope you’ve gotten plenty of sleep, you’re going to need it today.”



I nodded. “Yeah, yeah I do need it.”



She seemed to have caught on to my mood. “Mr. Smith, is something the matter?”



I shook my head. “No, I’m just not a morning person.”



She checked her watch. “It’s one-o-clock in the afternoon.”



I shrugged. “That’s morning somewhere on Earth, and somewhere in the galaxy I suppose.”



She gestured for me to get up. “Come on, we have your first task ready.”



I let out a sigh and followed her out of the break room and into the hall.



“Is it looking at an x-ray or something?”



“No, nothing like that. The paramedics already dealt with that, sorta.”



“Was it even the paramedics my niece called that night?”



“It was, though they were in on the whole thing. The call was redirected to a private line, all under the works of the Office for Kamailehope.”



“What does that even mean, Kamailehope?”



“It’s what the Hawaiians call Alpha Centauri. Back then, the UN thought the aliens must’ve been pretty close, but in reality they were extremely far away. While we now know they don’t live there, the name still sticks. Also, the name has the word ‘hope’ in it when you spell it out in English.”



“I think we could all use some of that these days.”



She smirked. “You could say that again, Mr. Smith.” We arrived at the door when she said that. “Are you ready to see her?”



“T-the alien?” She nodded. “Right, just had to make sure.”



*Come on, Liam, you have to make it right, for Hannah, otherwise she’d be… doing it for nothing.*



*I could just leave. I don't have to stay here.*



“Are you all good, Mr. Smith?”



I took a deep inhale, and then let out a deep exhale.



“As ready as I’ll ever be.” I said with little enthusiasm.



She opened the door to the room, and inside was a… folding table, with two folding chairs to accompany it.



…



“That’s it?” I said in annoyance. “I was expecting a little bit more than that.”



“I think you’d find it helpful to take a peek around the door, Mr. Smith.”



I entered behind her and saw a huge window along the right wall, one of those large ones that was in my interrogation room from yesterday. I walked up to the window to get a better look of the room’s interior. Through the window I could see it was above a countertop setup, with a sink just below it. I could make out a fridge next to it, and a gas oven, oddly enough. Would she even know how to use it? Could she hurt herself? I just pray they disconnected the gas.



“Is that where she’s staying?” I asked.



“Yes, it is.” She started to pull the table over towards the window.



“Here, let me help you.” I grabbed the other end and continued our conversation. “When did you get her room set up?”



“We’ve had it for quite some time, all the way back to the sixties.”



“Really? For that long? What did you use it for before all this?”



“Classified.” She said that as we slid the table to be against the window.



“Heyyy, you said no more secrets!” I said, a bit playfully.



“Sorry, but you’re not ready for that yet, maybe in a few days we could tell you.”



I rolled my eyes and continued to view the room, albeit from a distance due to the table. There was a door on the left wall, as well as one on the back wall towards the left. One of them must be the way in, and the other should be a bathroom, maybe? Honestly, for how active these guys were in watching me, I’m glad they gave her some privacy there. Afterall, I wouldn’t want someone to watch me either if I was taking a-



“There’s also a one-way mirror in the bathroom.” She said, seemingly having read my thoughts. This brain reading thing isn’t a live broadcast, is it? “You can access her quarters from the door on the back wall.”



It made sense that the back one was the way in, considering it had a feed door. To the right of it was a dining table, oddly enough with two seats on opposite sides. Perhaps for two way conversation? “Where is she now?” I expected Agent Brown to tell me she was in a sick bay somewhere else in the facility, considering her heart wasn’t alive for a dangerously long time.



“Over there to the right. You might not be able to see her from your angle. Come over here to see it better.”



I walked down to the left like she said, and looked through what I now knew was a one-way mirror. There was a bed along the far-right corner. She was laying in it on her back, seemingly placed there while she was unconscious. She was wearing a cast on her right leg, all the way from the bottom of her kneecap to the middle of her foot.



“Ok, I have several questions already.”



Brown pulled a chair up to the table and sat down in it. “Go on then.”



It prompted me to do the same. “Why isn’t her heart being monitored at all? She just went through cardiac arrest.”



“That’s not a concern to me.”



I flung my hands in the air and looked around at an imaginary audience. “You literally hired me to be her assigned veterinarian. When I say she needs to be-”



She put her hand up in front of me. “No, we’ve already talked to someone else. He says she’s going to be fine.”



“How? If that was a human they'd still be in the hospital until long after they woke up! She’s not human, and her anatomy is completely different. Shouldn't that mean we monitor her for longer? What idiot said she was alright?”



“Someone who’s been with us for quite some time. We called him over to join us, but it’ll be a few days until he gets here. He’s been out of the field for a few years, but it’ll be helpful to have an experienced linguist.”



“A linguist? You’re telling me the guy is an experienced alien doctor and alien linguist?”



She nodded. “He’s spent most of his life researching these extraterrestrials. If I had to say, he knows more about them than anyone else, well, any human, that is. I’m sure the aliens out there know way more about themselves than anybody else does back here on Earth, but out of us Earthlings, he’s the best one we’ve currently got. He resides in Nunavut as of now, which is why the trip down here’s going to take some time.”



“He’s Canadian?”



She hesitated with her answer, as if she didn’t know what to say. “No, he just moved up there many years ago.”



“I don’t mean to question this guy's omniscience, but are you sure her heart is going to be ok? Like, absolutely positive?”



“He’s pretty credible, Mr. Smith”



“Because if she dies on my watch, I don’t know if I could ever-”



I stopped myself, taking notice of how Brown’s eyes were focussed on something behind me. I turned around to find the alien still lying on the bed.



“Wow, this is some perfect timing here, juuust perfect.” Brown said, rather sarcastically.



“What happened?” I said as I stood up.



“She jerked a little, meaning she’s waking up.” She drove her hands through her hair out of stress. “Welp, I guess we’ve got to skip the tutorial, then. Come on, I'll show you how to get in there.”



*What?!*



“You- you want me to go in there? Like, now? As she’s waking up?”



She guided me out of the room and back into the hallway. She handed me a visor and an earpiece on the way out, things she seemingly got out of nowhere. Were they hidden in her pockets? How’d she fit an entire visor in there? “Put these on, quickly.”



“I can figure out what the earpiece is for, but what’s the point of the visor?”



“Glad you brought that up. Whatever you do, DON’T let her see your face.”



“Why? Shouldn’t we get her used to it?”



She shook her head, rather annoyed by my questions. “Just put it on and get in there.”



She brought me into a separate room, with only the door we came in from and another door that presumably led to the alien’s room. There was also a pair of crutches leaned against it. “This is going too fast. Can you please explain what I’m doing here?”



“Just grab the crutches and put your equipment on.” She closed the door behind me. I tried to open it back up, but it was locked.



“Hey! Let me out!” I screamed, kicking at the door.



She yelled through the door. “Talk through the earpiece! I’ll be in the room from before! I’m watching the two of you!”



*What on God’s green Earth is this job supposed to be? So far literally anybody could be doing this crap, all the while they’re treating me like a wild animal in here. So much for having a ‘special talent’ or whatever.*



I put on the equipment before grabbing the crutches.



“Testing. Testing. One. Two. Three.” I spoke while holding the earpiece.



*“Hear you loud and clear. Go ahead and enter the room.”*



“Can we just stop for a second?”



*“You want to help her, right?”*



“I just think there’s a better way of doing this, you know? I mean, I'm just some thirty-nine year old guy from Colorado who has no experience with any extraterrestrials. You guys have dealt with this kinda stuff for years! Shouldn’t you be the first one to talk with her?”



There was silence on the other end.



“Hello, are you still there?”



*“Yeah, you cut out at that part. Were you saying anything important?”*



I drove my hand into my forehead. “You know what, fine. Let’s just do this.”



I grabbed the door handle.



*Ok, ok, ok, you’ve got this, Liam, you’re about to be the first human this alien sees. No pressure whatsoever.*



 I didn’t realize how long I was hesitating at the door handle.



*“You can open it now, she’s still lying on the bed.”*



*Well, here goes nothing.*



I opened the door carefully and slowly walked inside. I could see my reflection through the one way mirror across the room, just above the countertop. To my immediate left was the dining table set up, and a bit further down the room was… her.



She had noticed me, and pushed herself up in response. Her yellow eyes were staring at mine, and her breaths were audible, and she’s just continuing to stare at me with a seemingly expressionless face. I’m guessing human facial features are a, well, human thing only.



*“Introduce yourself, Mr. Smith.”*



*Oh my God. What do I even say? Why did I even agree to this in the first place? I didn’t even know what I was getting myself into.*



*SHUT UP! Just… introduce yourself, Liam.*



I put a hand on my heart, a bit shakily. “Liam.” I said it slowly so she could hear it correctly. “My name is… Liam.” I gestured to her. “Your name. Your name is…” I waited for a response, but she didn’t answer. It seemed she didn’t understand what the motion was supposed to mean. I walked closer to the bed, and she pushed herself away in response, her back now against the headboard. I stopped moving.



*How do I tell her I mean no harm?*



I slowly crouched down and set the crutches I was carrying on the floor next to me. I slowly stood back up, making sure my empty hands were visible to her. She slowly sat back up and started to move to the edge of the bed. She started to get up.



*Oh no.*



She let out a hiss of pain as she tried to stand up on the fractured leg. I clenched both my fists and my teeth upon seeing that, though I suppose she wouldn't have seen my face underneath the visor. She sat back onto the bed’s edge, shifting most of her weight into her arms, pushing into the bed’s edge. I was unsure as to why she was doing that, and not just putting her weight on the bed normally.



She was watching me with just her right eye now, as her head was turned to face in front of her. I suppose since her eyes are more outwards, she doesn’t have to move her head around as much as we do, to look around that is.



*“Be sure to explain how the crutches work, Mr. James.”*



I nodded, hoping Brown could see me from the other room. I crouched back down to grab the crutches. To be honest, I was unsure as to why I put them down in the first place. I put them into position, preparing to showcase how she is meant to use them. I made sure she was watching, before beginning to move around.



I started to walk with them, lifting up my right leg just like she would have to. I did so slowly, making sure she saw each step. A few laps around the room should let her get the picture. I stopped after that and looked back at her, hoping she’d put the pieces together.



*Well, let’s see what you’ve learned.*



I took my arms out of the crutches and walked to be in front of her, slowly of course. Her eyes squinted a bit, and she slightly leaned forward towards me. I walked closer, extending out the crutches for her to reach. I noticed her arms bending down, shifting her weight further into the bed, almost like they were a spring.



*Why is she so locked in on me? It’s like she’s about to pounce or something.*



…



*She’s not right?*



…



“Oh fuck.”



*Don’t swear! You know you don’t want Hannah to start-*



It was like lightning had struck out of nowhere. She pushed off of the bed with her two arms and left leg, grabbing on to me before slamming me down onto the carpeted floor. All of her weight was on top of me, and I felt immense pain in my back. Almost all of the air was flung out of my lungs, and I was gasping for it through my nose.



*Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckity FUCK!*



She lifted her hand way up high, and I could see just how long and sharp those claws of hers were. Her breaths were heavy, and her eyes seemed to be staring deep into my soul. I could feel my heart about to explode, but I didn’t risk moving a muscle. I could hear Brown calling for someone over the earpiece, but all of my focus was on the near death experience I was currently in.



“\[Who are you?! Where am I being held?! What have you done to the rest of the passengers?!\]” She was screaming at me in some unknown language. All the while I was shaking, in so much pain.



I was panicking. My lungs were out of control. My thoughts were everywhere. My eyes were watering. Then, all of a sudden, they all came back to me. My breathing started to become organized. My mind began to rest. More importantly, my eyes connected with hers.



For that brief moment everything was calm, tranquil. I could read her eyes. I understood what they were conveying to me. I felt… no… I *knew* what emotions were present in them. The undeniable sentience behind her. The pupils in the middle of those yellow irises were signalling a universal language to me. I can’t quite describe this, whatever it is. It awoke something deep inside of me, something I’ve never felt before. I could feel her breaths. I could feel her… soul. She was a person, a human. Her face was so…



…



…*beautiful*.



That moment was drowned out just as quickly as it had arrived, replaced by a need for my survival.



*How could I have been so stupid? How could the Office of Hawaii have been so stupid? No, that’s not important right now. She’s currently on top of me and about to slash my face off! Though, the visor is still on. So she’ll slash my neck instead! FOCUS!*



*She’s scared. I know that’s the reason. How am I supposed to tell her I mean no harm? I can’t speak her language, she doesn’t know common gestures, how am I supposed to do this?!*



I moved my hand up to the side of my head and pointed at it.



“M-m-m-my n-name… i-i-isssss…”



My hand was shaking like a flour mixer. I squeezed my eyes shut. I felt the water squeeze out of them when I did, the tears a mix of both physical and emotional pain. I laid there, bracing for whatever it is she wanted to do to me.



*Hannah, if you can hear me, know that I love you. I have always loved you. I’m so sorry for everything.*



“L-L-Liam… L-Liam Smith.”



…



…



…



“Mairi.”

I currently have a leather coffee table ottoman, but I can't tell if I actually like it or if it just feels too big for the space (and maybe too tall compared to my couch?). The room overall is very light and neutral, so I'd love to introduce a darker coffee table to add some contrast.

Does anyone have recommendations for a coffee table style or color that would help balance the space? I’d love something that doesn’t feel too bulky but still grounds the room a bit. Or am I just overthinking this and the leather ottoman is fine/most practical?? (My boyfriend would like the answer to be yes here - he is sooo against me buying another table 🤣)",1,1740112161.0,interiordecorating,3,1.0,False

The house was quiet—too quiet after the energy of the day had settled. She picked up her phone from the coffee table, her thumb swiping across the screen to unlock it.

There it was. A message from him.

Caius: I’ll be over tomorrow. Can’t wait to see you.

Her heart skipped a beat, the words simple but heavy with meaning. Tomorrow. She could practically feel his presence in the message, but tonight, the silence between them felt thick, filled with everything that went unsaid.

She typed a reply, her fingers moving quickly, but then hesitated. The words seemed inadequate, as if they couldn’t capture the longing she felt. She erased the sentence she started.

Her mind drifted to thoughts of him—of the way his voice sounded when they spoke, the way his hand felt when it brushed hers. The way he made her feel safe, yet made her heart race all at once.

She stared at the screen for a long moment, her thumb hovering over the keyboard, but the words wouldn’t come. The longing she felt was so intense, but she couldn’t find a way to say it. Not tonight.

The weight of her thoughts settled over her like a heavy blanket. She missed him. She missed the way he made her laugh, the way he made her feel seen. But the message felt too small for what she wanted to express.

She looked at the screen again, biting her lip. What could she say?

Finally, she typed, then deleted it.

The emptiness in the words felt worse than no words at all.

She set the phone down, her fingers still tingling with the desire to say something—anything—but nothing felt right. She wanted him here, right now.

Tomorrow couldn’t come soon enough. But tonight, she was left with the silence, the ache of longing she couldn’t put into words.

Her phone sat quietly on the coffee table, and she found herself staring at it. The longing for him felt like a quiet ache in her chest, the kind that swells when you want to say everything but can’t seem to find the right way.

She leaned back into the couch, her eyes drifting over to the empty space where his presence usually filled the room. The house felt just a little bit colder tonight. There were so many things she wanted to tell him—about how much she missed his touch, how his absence left a gap she couldn’t seem to fill.

Her fingers twitched as if they were reaching for the phone again, but she stopped herself. She wasn’t sure what to say. It felt foolish, trying to condense everything into a few words. How could she say how much she missed him without feeling like it wasn’t enough?

The phone buzzed again, pulling her from her thoughts. Another message from him, but it wasn’t what she expected.

Caius: I’m counting down the hours. Miss you, too.

Her heart squeezed in her chest. There it was. The unspoken connection. His message wasn’t full of grand declarations, but the simplicity of it carried all the weight she needed. She didn’t have to search for the perfect words. It was enough just to know that he, too, was feeling the distance.

Her thumb hovered over the screen again, but this time, there was no hesitation. She smiled softly as she typed:

Valyria: I’ll be counting down, too. Can’t wait to see you.

This time, it felt right. The words weren’t grand, but they were honest, and that was enough.

She put the phone down once more, the ache in her chest slowly easing. Tomorrow would come soon enough, and when it did, she’d be with him. For now, the silence between them wasn’t so heavy. It was simply a space, waiting to be filled.",1,1740111990.0,u_Darkness_WithIn6833,0,1.0,False

What interested me in particular is the brewing method. A slow drip manual pour over that surprisingly brings a lot of the sweetness out of the roast. So, I had to give it a try on the rotation!

I went with the DAK Lemon Pearls first, but my grind was too coarse. The cup was still nice, light, milky. But I really dialed it in on my next cup with the DAK Currant Bluff. On the nose it’s very earthy with hints of tobacco. This one is the first of the DAK that seems to ring true to the notes offered. Very strong citrus at the start! I’m not sure yet if the technique did something special for these beans, but I will continue playing around with it. 

One of the tricks is keeping your brew warm while it drips, and I discovered that the aeropress go is a perfect solution!

1iuid4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1iuid4m/need_motivation_from_last_minute_drop_offs_in_am/,Need Motivation from last minute drop offs in AM,"I'm 29M, and for the past 13-14 months, my parents have been looking for a match through a typical arranged marriage process. However, in all this time, l've only met two girls. What worries me isn't the outcome of the meetings but the fact that most girls aren't even open to meeting or having a conversation with me in the first place.
I have a stable job at an Indian MNC, earn well, own property worth 4-5Cr in a Tier 1 city, and am an only child with both parents in government services. Yet, despite these factors, meetings keep getting canceled or postponed last minute, leaving me confused and frustrated.
Here's what has happened so far:
1. First Meeting - We had a decent 30-minute conversation, but our vibes didn't match, so we left it there. No issues with this one.
2. Second Meeting - We met at a coffee shop, but she showed up wearing a mask, saying she had a cold. Later, she told her parents that I hadn't removed my helmet, so she couldn't see me properly-something that didn't happen.
3. Last-Minute Cancellations - A few girls initially agreed to meet, but they backed out at the last moment without any clear reason.
4. December 26 Meeting - A meeting was planned at her house, but on December 25, her father called to say she couldn't get leave from work. He said he'd get back with a new date, but nothir has happened since. Meanwhile, she keeps viewing my LinkedIn profile daily.
5. A Girl I Really Liked - I came across a profile on a matrimonial site and really liked it. Coincidentally, her father saw my profile and reached out to my parents. After 20 days, as per astrology a meeting was scheduled. Her father initially asked my family to visit their home, but as me and parents stay in a different city, my family suggested me to go alone meeting at a restaurant instead. Jus before 2 days, he called to say she had gone to Pune and wouldn't make it on time, so the meeting was postponed. I had a feeling this wasn't the real reason.
• | had connected with her on Linkedin and Instagram, but when I messaged her on Insta, she immediately gave me her father's number and asked me to speak to him instead. She didn't engage beyond that.
I understand that talking and getting rejected (or rejecting someone) is part of the process. But these last-minute cancellations and complete drop-offs without explanation are demoralizing.
I still feel strongly about the fourth girl, but my parents are firm that unless her family reaches out again, they won't take further steps.
At this point, I really don't understand what girls or their families are looking for. Any thoughts? Any DM to motivate or support me morally are welcome 🙏. ",10,1740111832.0,Arrangedmarriage,3,1.0,False

1iuibo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_EstrogenCookie/comments/1iuibo0/a_diary_of_sorts_22/,A diary of sorts [22],"So..... today was, alriight?

It started off pretty well, I woke up nice and early, drove the kids to school, and then went to the coffee shop and got some iced hot chocolate. This time I had them put coffee ice though, where instead of freezing water they freeze coffee. It tasted really good. 

I have a speech I need to write, so I actually got a bit of headway on that. I told someone at speech club id have the script written before the next meeting, so the pressure set in and I was doing well. Due to the snow club was canceled at around 10:30 though, which meant 2 things.

1. Id be able to pick the kids up at 3 and take them back instead of setting of to club at 12:30(club is an hour and a half away and home is 30 minutes away)
2. Id have to teach that day because I wouldn't be gone, which is fine but I just wasn't expecting to.

And then I think because the last minute pressure was off I genuinely just couldn't focus. I even tried shifting to reading a book I had to and I got like 2 pages in an hour. It was really frustrating, because usually if I can't focus i think it's because I just was destracting myself, or I hadn't started the day right, or *something*, anything. But even with nothing wrong and specifically not distracting myself I just couldn't focus.

I would normally go and eat something, but I expected to drop by the house on the way to speech and get a sandwich or something, so I was really hungry.  Sometimes the best thing to do is change of scenery or do something different. So I went to a thrift store and got a cookie(because it was cheap) The tiny bit of coffee I had because of the ice was probably a bad idea though. It maybe had an effect on my focus, but by the time I left the coffee shop my anxiety was not being very nice. 

I decided to go to the library, which id only been to a couple times, but generally libraries are another good place to study. At this point I was super anxious from the lack of work and probably the coffee and I think a little bit of dysphoria (giant dread of anyone seeing me at all) I went in anyways though and figured it wasn't that big of a deal and I could go in and figure it out.... I couldn't. I was so on edge and I didn't feel safe anywhere and I kept walking through the highest shelves and trying to avoid people. I really needed to sit down but all of the chairs were taken or in plain view so I couldn't sit down and panic properly. It was really awful. Luckily I was talking to someone and just typing things to them helped calm me down a little bit and I was able to eventually walk out.

I picked the kids up and got them home. My grandma asked me to call my doctor to get a health thingy set up (I need it in order to enroll in school) I have terrible anxiety around phone calls and today was *not* a good time for it, but I went to do it anyways and then accidentally got lost watching YouTube shorts. She came in and asjed it is called and I said no and she said ""fine then we'll drop by on the way to the studio, how about that"" and I know it was meant as a worse option but I much prefer that so I said yes. My siblings rode with grandmother to the studio while I took the car (since it's my dad's). And I don't think I should be trusted with a vehicle today. I was internally freaking out the entire way there and kept thinking about somehow running off or getting into a deadly crash(don't worry, I know I wouldn't have)

Once I got to the pediatric I parked and started freaking out *again* but the same friend helped me through it.. again, and I avoided the second panic attack. Yippee. I got out of the car and the doctor was closed anyways so I just drove to the studio.

I had to lock in, teaching kids is not something you can do whilste in an episode of anxiety. So I wasn't fully there for the first class, but I got through. Then the second one started and I spent the time freaking out in the back. >!TW:self harm. whoopsies :<!< >! I *did* make a little bit of a small cut.. it only went through maybe half or 3/4 of the skin layers, so.. nothing permanent I guess.. I did a couple more a bit later too, but they just look like slight scratches. It's nothing bad and none of them bled at all.!< I was called back in in like 10 minutes though, and I was alright for the rest of the day.

When we got back home at 9 we had a small birthday  party with cheesecake and ice cream for my grandpa and brother, and that was nice. The everyone went to bed :3 

Sorry about it being so long. I just needed to get it out there. A genuine, heartfelt thank you to you people that read these by the way.. it's silly, but y'all are a big reason I try to stay clean of whatever. *hug*

Goodnight

1iuib5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/1iuib5m/made_this_throwaway_3_years_ago_exactly_to_talk/,Made this throwaway 3 years ago exactly to talk about TA/Student relationships as a TA,"Hiya, coincidentally logged into this acc by accident on my cake day, and I realized I made this acc to respond to a post about the TA side in case of TA/student romantic romantic. Since it seems to be popular once more, let me copy/paste said response:

Not a student, but am TA. This is probably not what you wanted to hear, but I hope it's close enough to give you some satisfaction. First off, while you are our students, at least for me, it's weird as hell to think of you as anything else. There is definitely a power dynamic, and I find this off-putting because it feels like an abuse of my power. Some light flirting is okay, but nothing that makes others uncomfortable. If you ever want to even have a chance, make a move only AFTER your final exam has been marked. I say ""make a move"" because it is probably the case that your TA will NOT reach out to you, even if you felt like there was something between you two. All of this applies to the rest of my reply, so you should read it with this context in mind.

With that out of the way, here is a confession(of mine): As a TA, there is almost always at least one student I would love to get to know better. I'm naturally very outspoken so I have to admit I feel like I flirt mildly with these students sometimes. Sometimes it's just teasing (which I honestly do to anyone that I feel like can take it, it just makes everyone a little more comfortable with one another), or like a compliment on their looks (maybe they did their hair differently today or they have a t-shirt with something on it that I recognize/am a fan of). That said, I try to be very discreet, and will most definitely not give you preferential treatment. I have a job to do, and that is to teach all of you. But still, I'll enjoy helping you a little more than helping others, 'cause you're some mean eye-candy. Now here are some more specific, juicier stories:

1. One time I was asked out: a student reached out at the end of the last week of class (before the final, rookie mistake), and asked to go for coffee. I assumed there was more than coffee to it, and just wanted to see what they wanted (I'm a big fan of communicating expectations before anyone is disappointed), and they sort of dodged the idea of there being ulterior motives but eventually confessed to wanting to possibly date me. I didn't think that was a good idea, but I really loved how ballsy they were so I just told them that I thought they were cool and to just keep in touch on social media (they initially used a service hosted on a UBC server to ask me out, and I thought it was smarter to talk about it somewhere else so there were no UBC records, so I replied to them on social media). This never went anywhere.
2. Another time, there was this student that I thought was super cute. Again, I never went out of my way to talk to them, but every time it happened I was a little more bubbly and flirty, and I really felt like so were they. We bonded over an early in-class activity, where we were the only ones that picked a certain choice so we were chatting alone for a bit and since the other groups were fairly large, our convo was relatively long. The rest of the term, students formed groups and I was assigned their group. Lucky me. I really thought they were lovely and it was a lot of fun being their TA. This was after the first story so I thought I might get a message from them around the end of term, but I never did. I looked them up on social media and found them, but decided not to add them 'cause it felt hella creepy (imagine your Prof starts following you and none of your friends... I would have questions).

Anyway, there are other things here and there but it's basically just me finding a student really cute and feeling like there is some chemistry but nothing coming from it, so not as ""exciting"" (if you could call either of those stories that).",24,1740111647.0,UBC,2,0.96,False
1iui9yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1iui9yd/do_normal_levels_vary/,"Do ""normal"" levels vary?","I've had a few 2 or 3 year rounds of thyroid problems and this is the first time I've had blood tested. I apparently *do* have hashimoto's but my Thyroid is still functioning ""ok"" per the blood work.

Except I am NOT okay at all. I've gained 40 lbs on a near starvation diet, can barely move or function even with 5 coffees, can't feel my hands or feet- ever- and sit next to a space heater with socks, pants, and a blanket even when it's 77* in my house. 

Do I get on dessicated beef or pork thyroid? 

More than anything it makes me insane to have freezing numb extremities, but the weight gain making me unrecognizable isn't awesome either.

The last time this hashimoto's flared up, it got so bad that I went blind and was sleeping 18 to 20 hours a day, maintaining my weight on a slice of bread and a can of green beans, and couldn't function at all. I was a step away from being in a coma. In fact, after the exertion of getting dressed and being driven to a doctors appointment, I would come home and fall down asleep on the floor because I was too tired to make it to my bed.

Since I have used my Fresh Roast SR800 with its extension tube I have noticed first crack does not betide until eight or nine minutes into any roast. Is this typical with any coffee regardless of the process or shall first crack happen more soon than that unconditionally? I lack all eyesight and thus cannot monitor temperature… yet. I have learnt the sequence of the number of times to press the knob and listen to the fan to keep on track. I have not yet let the machine roast for more than fourteen minutes at which juncture I press the Cool button. Yesterday and today I stopped at twelve because I wanted to try to taste the characteristics of these Yemeni varieties before making darker roasts. My process is as follows.

* first four minutes: fan = 9; heat = 1
* next three minutes: fan = 8; heat = 1
* next three minutes: fan = 7; heat = 3
* final two to four minutes: fan = 6; heat = 5",1,1740111416.0,roasting,17,0.99,False
