I'm 27F.  I'm on my weight loss journey through clean eating and walking. I weighed 68kg on Jan 1, after a week I lost 3 kg. Planning to lower my weight till I'm 58 kg .

I used walk 10k usually 3-4 times a week. Eat clean but also outside junk food. That's the reason I put on belly fat (bulk gone wrong) 

I've been strength training since 2021-22. I've put on enough muscle mass. 

Now, i love to walk, listening to eat tantalizing music nonstop. Taken my weight/fat loss journey seriously since Jan 1. I walk around 17k average daily steps. Will walk 25k average after mid Jan. 

I've prior experience of walking during my first fat loss journey which helped me to reduced my weight from 85kg to 55 kg. So it's not a big deal for me. It takes 3 hours for 20k steps. ( 10k morning, 10k night)

Morning : one scoop of whey with 250g Curd + assorted seeds/nuts

1hxiwlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hxiwlo/ghost/,Ghost,"At 3:07 AM on Tuesday, December 17th, I awoke to a scent‚Äîa memory woven into the night air. It had been more than two years since my soul splintered, since I dragged myself from the wreckage of him. 

And yet, I smelled him still. The musk of alcohol, thick as it oozed from his very pores, still clung to the midnight air. I shot up, terror-stricken, my heart pounding like a drum in the silence of that dark hour.

I sought solace in the rolling thunder and the soft patter of rain, the hum of a YouTube video attempting to quell the storm inside. But even the storm outside could not wash away the weight of him. His presence, the ghost of him, tangled through my veins all day, his essence alive in every fleeting thought. I could not escape him.

By nightfall, the clock crept to 9:00 PM, and I sought refuge in a new distraction‚Äîa Lego set, gifted by a friend, meant to occupy my hands as a sitcom murmured in the background. But the pieces clicked together only to crumble, as flashes of our past began to haunt the edges of my mind. I scrolled aimlessly, and there it was‚Äîa quote about lost love, its words sharp as broken glass. Desperate, I reached for my journal, my heart spilling onto the page in wild, unfiltered cries.

Then, I picked up my phone. I was on the edge of telling a friend that I was being haunted by the ghost of Christmas past when‚Äîthere it was.
9:29 PM.
The notification glowed like a flame that should have been snuffed out. *‚ÄúHow much did you love me?‚Äù*

A muted notification. A silenced one. But my heart pounded as if he stood before me, felt my longing like a tethered pulse. Could he know? Was my apartment being watched, haunted by a presence I could not escape? I had moved three times in two years, and yet here he was, again.

9:38 PM. A link‚Äîa song he knew would pierce me‚ÄîBarcelona Fall in Love. The words twisted in my chest, sharp and cruel.

Shattered.

Sleep was my only refuge. I tried to flee from this relentless tide of memories, but the sobs came. Tears spilled, endless as rivers that refused to dry. My chest heaved, choked on the weight of it all. I fell into an exhausted slumber.
When morning came, I awoke as the undead‚Äîbroken, lifeless. Coffee in hand, heart still in ruins, I logged onto my computer. And then I saw it. A picture of us‚Äîof him kissing my cheek, taken during Christmas, when joy still had a place in our world.
He typed, ‚ÄúI used to be so big lol.‚Äù

I had resolved‚Äîno reply. Nothing. Leave me alone, I told myself. But, instead, I recorded a voice note. Nearly six minutes of sobs, of broken words I never meant to say. I poured my heart out, a raw confession of how he had haunted me, how his absence had carved me out hollow.

But when he replied, his words cut deeper than I could bear:
""I know that message is gonna make me feel bad, so I‚Äôm not listening to it."" Of course. Lord forbid he feels bad, for the things he‚Äôs done, for the mess he‚Äôs left behind.

The final blow‚Äî""I was obviously super lit, which is rare these days. Please just block me and move on. Nothing else needs to be said. I deleted your number.""


I pushed through the day, carrying the weight of his indifference like a stone in my chest. I refused to let him ruin my progress, my peace, my good life. But by nightfall, I was a puddle again, broken. I dragged myself to the gym, to move through the motions, but when I came home, I cried. In the shower, I let the water wash away the tears, but I still felt empty.

This connection, this twisted bond that still thrummed beneath my skin, hurt like an open wound. It was suffocating. We could have been so different‚Äîwe could have been *whole*‚Äîhad he chosen *me*, had he chosen *us*. But he chose the bottle.


I called out to my support system, broken and raw, pleading for help, for understanding. I cried. I threw up. I stayed home from work, a mess of emotions, a soul fractured.

My friends rallied arouned me. They gave their time, their presence, after long, busy days. One stayed for soup. Another took me out to dinner, to a steakhouse where laughter tried to fill the cracks in my heart. Another friend would perform a cord-cutting ceremony, and later, a Mario Kart sleepover awaited.

I knew I was blessed. I knew it.

But even then‚Äîwhy, why does this wound still bleed, so fresh, so deep? Why does his shadow still lurk, when it should have faded long ago?

Movement has been helping my wounds. Having the man you love most out of 8 billion people look into your soul and wish death upon you? No better motivation to push and pull weights at levels that threaten your life.

When will my life feel like it's mine again? All the amazing things that have happened for me. All the stability I have carved for myself. And still, haunted by a man who is *so weak*, *so cowardly* that a simple liquid was worth more than our lives.

1hxipew,https://www.reddit.com/r/functionaldyspepsia/comments/1hxipew/could_my_ppis_be_the_reason_my_symptoms_are_so/,Could My PPIs Be the Reason My Symptoms Are So Extreme?,"**My story in short:** I suddenly started experiencing significant bloating in the upper part of my stomach, accompanied by constant moderate-to-severe nausea, in July 2023. I was prescribed PPIs, which seemed to work fine for the first couple of weeks. However, I never felt they truly addressed the nausea, which remained constant.

**Fast forward to spring 2024:** I experienced a major improvement for reasons I can‚Äôt explain. I stopped taking PPIs daily and only used them occasionally, such as after drinking alcohol, to reduce acid and the resulting nausea. During those eight months, I could eat almost anything, although coffee triggered symptoms that lasted for up to 24 hours, as did fast food or consuming more than a liter of carbonated soda. Still, the symptoms were manageable and resolved within a day.

In November, I started taking omeprazole again because I began working and wanted to manage mild symptoms in the mornings before breakfast. Everything seemed fine at first, but by the end of December, I suddenly experienced the same nausea I had back in July 2023. The trigger this time was a fast-food meal, eerily similar to my earlier experience. What‚Äôs strange is that I had been eating junk food without issue during those eight months without daily PPIs, which makes me suspect the PPIs might be the culprit.

I honestly don‚Äôt remember how I managed PPIs during spring 2024‚Äîwhether I stopped while having symptoms or after they resolved‚Äîbut now I strongly suspect these pills might be contributing to my issues. While I do feel they reduce stomach acid and loosen my stomach slightly, the symptoms persist and even seem to worsen over time.

Could PPIs actually be the cause of my symptoms? My doctor has referred me to a GI specialist, and I‚Äôll have a consultation with them soon for further testing and a second opinion.

I'd really appreciate some advice, especially because I've never had a relationship and only ever had 2 dates. and tips as I (25M) and going to meet a girl (24M) on a first date on Saturday. We met in hinge and have been talking off the app, and it's been good, and I have a feeling that she likes me too, with probably a bit more flirting that I've had ever or I have given from my side, and we match on many things like political opinions, interests, opinions in general and religious beliefs. 
So I've got a few questions that I hope I can get answers for:
1. Is a coffee and walk (with a surprise show that I've planned) a good first date? I don't drink so a date over drinks didn't make sense imo. My plan was coffee and then we catch a show for an event and than have some dessert. 
2. Is it weird to travel with her in the metro to the mall we're heading to for the date? I proposed a cab but she said the metro will atleast not see the crazy traffic that drivers have to, but I feel taking her in the metro might be off-putting?
3. I'm going to be going out of country for a few months, found that recently and haven't spoken about this yet, she plans to move for some experience as well, but she isn't set on it yet, so it's not like it's out of the picture, but how do I talk about this? 
4. And tips on dressing for the date? I suggested she wear comfy shoes to the mall, and she said she isn't wearing shoes on a first date, so the bar is high for me now. 
5. What's the consensus on some gifts? She's a potter head and I was gonna get this bracelet or some pendant(some yellow chimes something, not too expensive) but my friend said that would be too much so stick to flowers. What would you say, flowers/ chocolate and a card(her bday was last week so)? 
6. Any tips additionally might be great, like the touch barrier, I can talk comfortably, but I hesitate to go in for the hug directly with a girl, so how should I navigate that, and in general. 
7. Also, she's smashing it in her career, and I'm still looking for a good position, so mentally that's there too

Our conversations have been amazing, I had issues with unsendjng and editing messages, and she called me out on it and said that hopefully she can get me comfy, so oddly in my head, in having a lot of self doubt for no apparent reason other than just an occasional case of low self esteem.

When it comes to diamond sparkle, understanding the science behind scintillation is crucial. Here are the key takeaways:

* Scintillation is the dynamic sparkle effect created by light interacting with a diamond's facets.
* There are two types: flash scintillation (white light sparkles) and fire scintillation (colored sparkles).
* Cut quality is the most significant factor in determining a diamond's sparkle.
* Proper facet alignment, proportions, and polish are essential for optimal scintillation.

# FAQ

Q: What exactly is diamond scintillation?A: Scintillation is the sparkle effect created by light reflecting off a diamond's facets as the stone, light source, or observer moves.

Q: How does cut affect a diamond's sparkle?A: Cut quality, including proportions, facet alignment, and polish, is the most significant factor in determining a diamond's sparkle.

Q: Are more facets always better for sparkle?

A: Not necessarily. The arrangement and size of ""virtual facets"" are more important than simply having more facets.

Q: What's the difference between brilliance, fire, and scintillation?A: Brilliance is overall light return, fire is the dispersion of white light into spectral colors, and scintillation is the sparkle effect from movement.

Q: How can I ensure I'm getting a diamond with excellent sparkle?A: Look for diamonds with top cut grades, especially those certified by AGS. Consider ""super ideal"" cuts from reputable retailers known for their craftsmanship.

1hxifpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CyclingNutrition/comments/1hxifpu/carb_drinks_help_hydration/,Carb drinks help hydration? ,"I've recently started to take my on-bike nutrition a little more serious and am experimenting with adding a carb drink to my hourly consumption at high intensity efforts. 

Currently I consume the following: Formula 369 \~ 30/60g + SIS gel \~ 22g + SIS bake \~30g 

I start drinking Formula 369 about 15 mins in. I use a gel at the 30 min marks & bake at the hr marks while I drink formula 369 throughout the hr. Separately I have an electrolyte drink in my other bottle. 

My question is, does the carb drink still help with hydration? Or is it like coffee that dehydrates even though its a drink? 

Below is Formula 369 info for context. 

Formula 369 is a simple and cost effective way to give endurance athletes exactly what they need in a drink mix, and nothing more. A lack of calories often holds athletes back from performing at their best, but with up to 90 grams of carbohydrates in a bottle, Formula 369 will keep you going strong until you hit the stop button. With each scoop containing 30 grams of carbs, you can mix 30, 60, or 90 grams of carbs per bottle to suit your needs. Our 1:1 ratio of glucose to fructose utilizes 2 energy pathways, allowing you to absorb the maximal amount of carbs per hour, without stomach discomfort. We cut out everything that doesn‚Äôt contribute to performance, so we can give you more product, at a lower cost.

And then I added a little more information and personality and this is the result.

[Translated by; ChatGPT]

[Day #0]

I just lost my relatives. They went into an alley they shouldn't have, and the cannibals got them. Food is becoming scarce, and I don't feel hopeful anymore.

I found a poster looking for hires. It had no details on what was needed, and when I got to the place, there was no interview. Strange, but it seems promising!

[Day #1]

Today was my first day on the job, and I‚Äôm getting ready. I was assigned to the Control Team, and after a bit of chatting with our ""Leader,"" I learned her name and realized she's very systematic. I think I'll feel safe working with her!

They gave me some new clothes, which make me feel more confident, and also handed me a large cross for self-defense. They told me to use it on anyone who goes insane.

The shift began! I was assigned to work with something called ""One Sin and Hundreds of Good Deeds."" When I entered the containment cell, I felt calm thanks to the manual they gave me‚Äî‚Äújust follow it, and everything will be fine,‚Äù they said. Still, it felt strange, the way it looked at me, almost as if it could see through my intentions.

How can I describe it? Well, it looked like a cross stuck inside a skull with a crown of thorns. I‚Äôll try to paste a drawing I made of it.


It moved slowly while floating‚Äîbizarre.

When I asked it a few questions, I got no answers. It was just too strange! I felt like my mind wandered a bit, but the uniform seemed to absorb... something.

After working with it twice, the day ended. We hit our daily quota, and I headed home. I‚Äôm exhausted, and working alone in this department is lonely. I hope they send colleagues soon.


[Day #2]

Another day. When I went to get dressed and grab the cross, there was another girl in the locker room. I was surprised and embarrassed since I‚Äôm not used to dressing in front of others. I approached her and tried to talk a little, but she just gave me a thumbs-up and got ready for her shift. I felt a bit sad but now want to be her friend!

About the uniforms: I thought mine was standard for the company, but apparently not. The girl wore a blue outfit with fairy-like wings on the back. It looked cute!

The day began, and I decided to chat with the new Control Team member. Since the manager hadn‚Äôt assigned work yet, it felt like a good time. I mentioned how, even after completing the abnormalities management training, I still couldn‚Äôt fully grasp things‚Äîit was such a massive manual! But... she ignored me entirely.

I was sent to work with another abnormality, this time called ""Beauty and the Beast."" It was... horrifying, really. A disturbing mixture of features that unsettled me deeply. It made me nervous.

The best description? A quadrupedal cockroach with ant-like mandibles, multiple eyes, and horns adorned with roses. It seemed like it was looking for someone to carry something. I didn‚Äôt want to get involved!

But I had no choice. They sent me to work with it again.

At least the day ended quickly after that, and I went home to try and forget that disturbing sight.

[Day #3]

I tripped on my sheets this morning‚Äînot great.

Things are a bit better now since they provide us food before shifts, so I‚Äôm surviving!

On my way to work, I bumped into that girl again! I tried to interact, and this time, I got a simple ""Hi."" Slowly making progress.

Later, a new person joined our team. They had long hair, and I thought it was a woman at first, but it turned out to be a guy. He seemed friendly. I started chatting, commenting on how experienced and skilled the manager must be to reach this level. He actually responded! He mentioned how strict the contract guidelines are about obedience, and I agreed. From across the room, I heard that girl muttering something about not having a choice.

The new colleague‚Äôs name is Christopher‚Äîsuch a cool name.

AND THEN THEY MADE ME WORK WITH THAT THING AGAIN!

This time, it seemed scared, like it wanted to die. I feel sympathy for it now. It seems so sad, and I had to work with it twice more today. I feel awful.

To top it off, I approached that girl again. She was muttering about needing to do her best to bring her family to the Nest. I told her she could do it and that her family would be fine. She seemed confused but slightly happy deep down.

Later, Malkuth called me to the management office. I thought I was in trouble, but it was actually a promotion! I‚Äôm so happy‚ÄîI wish I had someone to share this with.


[Day #4]

When I arrived today, I didn‚Äôt expect the news: apparently, a staff member died yesterday, and they were important. It made me question if I really wanted to stay here‚Äîbut the paycheck convinced me.

In the locker room, there was someone who looked like a man at first, but as they undressed, it was clear they were female apart from the head. I decided to socialize and found out her name is Maria. She was cheerful‚Äîunusual for this place‚Äîand that gave me some encouragement to keep going.

When I got dressed, I noticed I had new clothes from the promotion: a beige vest and blue pants. They were plain, so I didn‚Äôt mind wearing them. My cross was also replaced by a staff with horns, resembling those of the ""Beauty and the Beast.""

The day began quickly, and I was sent to work with Beauty and the Beast again. This time, I was happy to see it seemed well. It even appeared glad to see me, which was comforting. Maybe we‚Äôre building some kind of connection?

Back in the room, that girl‚ÄîKim, I learned‚Äîcame to talk to me. She now wore a crown of thorns on her head. She thanked me for my words from yesterday, which I thought were silly at the time. She explained that the skull abnormality gave her the crown, which piqued my curiosity. She introduced herself as Kimhuil and said she hoped working here wouldn‚Äôt become too difficult.

Maria caught me staring at Kim for a moment‚ÄîI think she noticed.

[Day #5]

I‚Äôm starting to get used to this place. I think everything will turn out okay.

When I arrived, I greeted Kim and Maria, and Kim finally gave me a full response! I think I‚Äôm making progress.

Kim talked to me at the start of the day, saying she now felt like she was truly part of the ‚ÄúWing.‚Äù I was happy for her.

This place still feels strange, though.

A new boy joined us today. He seemed brave.

Later, while working with Beauty again, Kim was talking about how much she needed her paycheck. That‚Äôs when I realized I need more than just knowledge to analyze these creatures.

After another session with Beauty, I returned to the room and noticed Maria now had a crown of thorns too. Apparently, the skull is giving those out a lot.

Christopher had a beautiful brooch on. When I asked where he got it, he said it was from another abnormality. Another one?

I chatted briefly with the new guy, who introduced himself as Yui. He seems nice, but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll interact much.

[Day #6]

When I arrived at the locker room today, there was another new girl. Her badge indicated she was from Information. I‚Äôm not sure what department that is, but when I tried to be friendly, she gave me a short, harsh ‚Äúno.‚Äù I left feeling down, but Kim patted me on the back for comfort.

While working, an issue arose‚Äîpurple slimes appeared, and I was sent to help contain one in the Information Team. The manager seemed serious, and I felt uneasy. When I saw my colleagues injured after handling one, my slight unease turned into full-blown fear.

Yui also got a crown of thorns today. Good for him, I guess.

During containment, I saw that new girl badly injured. After dealing with the slime, we talked a bit. Her name is Camilla.

[####]

""One day, she entered the Count‚Äôs room‚Äîthe room she was instructed never to enter during the day. There, she witnessed the Count‚Äôs true form. He was utterly grotesque. Hundreds of eyes, four legs, neither human nor beast.""
F-02-44

[Day #7]

Another day at the corporation. I armed myself, got dressed, and was so distracted I forgot to greet the others.

While heading to work with Beauty, I overheard someone mentioning a new Teth-level abnormality in the Information department. That‚Äôs concerning; we already have four of those!

Christopher came to talk to me, saying he was finally understanding how to handle abnormalities and that he got promoted. I was genuinely happy for him.

The days feel repetitive, don‚Äôt they?

Something interesting happened, though‚ÄîBeauty gave me a hair ornament. It‚Äôs a beautiful red flower, almost spider-like. I was overjoyed and plan to keep it with me always.

I showed it to Kim and Christopher; they thought it was both pretty and strange. I‚Äôm so happy to have this gift.

Another problem arose‚Äîthis time, killer robots. It was horrifying. When we arrived to contain them, there was a pile of bodies that almost made me vomit.

During containment, one of the robots grabbed a colleague and smashed them to the ground before brutally disfiguring them. We hit it nonstop, all while hearing the man‚Äôs screams. He had a family waiting for him‚Ä¶ but we couldn‚Äôt make it so they‚Äôd ever see him again.

After something so horrific, the manager still had the audacity to assign me work with that crucified skull again. I finished the job, and when we were leaving, Camilla was called for something. I‚Äôll congratulate her tomorrow‚ÄîI just need to clear my mind for now.

[Day 7.5]

As we were leaving, Kim invited me for coffee in one of the districts. I was surprised she had money for that.

I'm SO disappointed; even after menopause, my mom was 'very dense,"", but apparently I didn't get her genetics. I have an appointment with my GP in a couple weeks for my yearly, so I'm hoping for a little guidance on how to approach her about things I should have tested and possible medications/supplements I might need prescribed? 

Here's some additional info about me, in case its useful.....

What I'm already doing/already plan on doing:

\* I just started the .025 estrogen patch last month, so that should be protective and even (based on studies I've read) help improve things a little. (I get my progesterone via my IUD.)  
\* I've been doing collagen in my coffee for the past year, and I pay attention to my protein overall; I'll continue to do that.  
\* I'm already a runner, and I do modest weight training at home, but as soon as race season is over in Texas and all the New Years resolution folks leave the gym, I plan to get a personal trainer to help me up my weight training game.  
\* As soon as I got the scan (a week ago), I got an OTC calcium + D3 supplement to use until I talk to my GP. (I have not been on a dedicated calcium supplement, just a women's multivitamin; I had thought a good diet and exercise would be enough.)  


Concerns/Questions:  
  
\* My psychiatrist wants me to start Wellbutrin to deal with some significant depression (life-change related, not entirely hormonal), but I've read that it can contributed to calcium depletion? Is this a huge problem, or something that can be offset by supplementation? This has me concerned, but on the other hand, sitting around and crying constantly is probably not particularly good for my health.  
\* For several years, I've been taking higher dose magnesium (twice a day MigShield) as a migraine preventative, and I'm wondering if that could have contributed? How do y'all juggle supplements and timing?",1,1736443859.0,Menopause,5,1.0,False

#### Investment Thesis
Starbucks is facing a multitude of headwinds. The company's labor issues, tariffs, and increasing competition will be too much for the new CEO to overcome. Starbucks' strong brand has been tarnished, resulting in boycotts. The coffee quality is often criticized as subpar. Increasing debt levels warrant caution, and Starbucks could be forced to reduce dividends.

#### Risks
- **Economic Downturn**: A global economic slowdown could impact consumer spending on premium beverages.
- **Competition**: The coffeehouse market is highly competitive, with numerous players vying for market share.
- **Supply Chain Issues**: Disruptions in the supply chain could affect Starbucks' ability to maintain consistent product quality and availability.
- **Debt and Liquidity**: Starbucks has been increasing its long-term debt, nearly doubling it between 2019 and 2021.
- **Tariffs and Geopolitical Tensions**: Ongoing tariffs and geopolitical tensions, particularly with China, could lead to increased costs and reduced market access, further impacting Starbucks' profitability.

#### Conclusion
Starbucks remains a high-risk opportunity, with dwindling growth prospects and an increasingly competitive market. Based on current analyst ratings and financial performance, a price target range of $75 to $85 over the 12 months.",4,1736443707.0,WallStreetbetsELITE,4,0.84,False

I don't want to make anyone looking to be cleaner to feel bad.}

this is my first post in this space and it is a rant. i get frustrated a lot because my cleaning standards are much higher than my roommates', but i know my standards aren't the common standard, so it's not reasonable to hold my roommates to my standards (they're clean individuals when it comes to commoner standards).

BUT RINSE THE SINK BRO. is it crazy to expect someone to rinse the sink when they left debris in there? If you wash dishes and leave food crumbs n shit, rinse that out! It's GROSS. Even at work, people rinse coffee and other such beverages down the drain but don't rinse the leftover liquid! It's gunna leave a STAIN.

Bruh it takes the least amount of effort/time to rinse the sink if you leave your mark and is basically cleaning up after yourself. That is a golden rule of cleanliness in common spaces - clean up after yourself. We learn that from kindergarten because it is part of being human. Respect the spaces you share with people. (I don't give a **** if you wanna disrespect yourself in your private spaces by neglecting simple cleanly practices like rinsing your sink. It's your space, desecrate it if you want.)

It's not like I'm expecting people to rinse the sink every time they use it - just if there are any foreign substances left in it other than water! Like, why is this not a widely used practice? I know too many people in my own sphere who do not do this and it drives me CRAZY (clearly).",1,1736443669.0,Cleanfreaks,0,1.0,False

1hxi1dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hxi1dn/my_friend_found_an_unfortunate_method_to_cure_his/,My friend found an unfortunate method to cure his writer's block ,"If you ask anyone with a passion for writing what the best feeling in the world is, I would bet money on them saying the feeling they get when writing. But, it's not just the writing that is special. It's the beautiful feeling of putting your innermost thoughts onto a page. Being able to share a mystical world you've created in your mind. It feels vulnerable. Like you are cracking your own head open and putting it on display for anyone to see. To love, to hate, to judge. The moment you feel your thoughts just falling onto the page. It's like you're not even thinking about it. It just somehow falls in place and makes a coherent story that you've put everything into. It's unlike any drug or any other high. The feeling of ideas flowing. Creativity. That is everything to a writer. So, what is the worst feeling in the world for a writer then? I bet that isn't a hard question for anyone. Writer's block. Few things feel worse when you are a writer.



What do you think happens when a writer gets writer's block? It's the complete opposite feeling. Not having any ideas in your head to escape to throughout the day can feel like hell. It's like the drug has been taken from you but you can just get more by buying some. It's not like running to the store to grab a six-pack of beer. That dopamine is blocked until *you* have a new fresh idea. Your own flesh and bone stopping you from pleasure.¬†



That's not even taking into account the pressure from others to write and get something out that will do well.¬†



All that being said, I am here to talk to you all about what happens when a writer is *desperate* for an idea and the lengths they will go to for an idea.¬†



My good friend Thomas went missing last week. He was a writer who found a way around his writer's block through very unconditional methods that led to his disappearance.¬†



To do this whole situation justice, I need to go back. Way back to when I met Thomas.



The two of us met in our junior year of college in a writing class. We were both put in a writing group with three other people. We both had an amazing time with the class and the writing group.¬†



I always knew the reason I enjoyed it so much was *because* of Thomas. After we finished the class, the two of us continued to meet up and help each other out with our writing projects or bounce ideas off of one another. Even on days we just wanted to hang out and play video games or something, it would always end up with us talking about our writing projects. Short stories, screenplays, books, all of it.



Thomas felt like an absolute machine when it came to stories. For the most part, I felt like I could keep up with him, but the guy always had some new idea to tell me about. I've never met someone who has my style of writing like him.¬†



We both liked writing in many different styles. I don't think I have a favorite genre but without a doubt, Thomas liked writing horror the most.¬†



I think people make a lot of assumptions when someone writes horror. Especially if they are a *good* horror writer. They must be really messed up in the head to come up with such terrifying ideas. A murderer, a psychopath, a deeply disturbed individual. The truth is that couldn't be farther from who Thomas was. One of the kindest, gentlest people you'd ever meet.¬†¬†



I remember when he started to act strange. We were at a house party with maybe fifteen old friends from college. I saw Thomas being quiet in the corner. Now, to the average person, this probably looked like normal behavior for him. He wasn't a big party person. Whenever I did convince him to come to one with my extraverted-ass, he would prefer to just observe everyone else and I would do all the talking for him. He said that watching people in conversation helped him with his writing.¬†



That being said, I could tell he was off. He was looking down and just seemed empty‚Ä¶



After knowing him for so long I swore I could tell when he was in his own imaginary world. I could see the gears turning in his head and I'd get so excited to hear all about his new idea later.¬†



I should've gone up to him at that moment. Instead, I just stood at the beer pong table like a damn idiot. There were so many moments when I could've gone over to him to talk, but I didn't. Thomas has never been one to talk about feelings but that doesn't excuse me from not wanting to try. I'm not a guy big on feelings either but I don't try and actively avoid it. The mix of loud music, alcohol, and pretty girls definitely made it hard for me to talk to my buddy about how he felt.¬†



That night ended with him giving me and a few other guys a ride home. He was normally our DD for nights like this. He always said he didn't want a clouded-up head just in case he got an idea. Some might say a shot or two would only help, but not Thomas. He wasn't a religious guy, he just always wanted to be ready for an idea. It was his whole life. Always escaping into his own little world of make-believe and fantasy. It was always more fun to him than the real world.¬†



I sometimes felt like the only reason he wanted to be my friend was because I helped give him ideas to escape into. Sure sometimes we‚Äôd watch a football game or go to a party, but ugh, I don't know. I guess sometimes I felt used. I would push off those thoughts when they pierced my brain because I didn't know if I was using him too. Would I even be his friend if he wasn't a good writer?¬†



I guess we pick our friends for a reason right? Similar hobbies or interests? Maybe we did use each other for our own personal gain, but is it all that bad if we are *both* doing it?¬†



Sorry, I went on a bit of a side tangent there, I'm still processing so much.



Anyway, back to that night after the party.

I was the last person he needed to drop off that night. As he pulled up to my house he said goodbye but I got the courage to ask him if he was okay.



‚ÄúHey man, you good?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, just tired‚Äù he murmured without looking up.



‚ÄúOkay, well are we still good to meet up tomorrow for lunch?‚Äù I asked, accepting that to perk him up.¬†



‚ÄúOh, about that, I think I'm actually busy tomorrow, sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you mean busy? It's Saturday. What else could you possibly want to do other than talk about our projects?¬†



‚ÄúYou know I have other things I need to do sometimes right?‚Äù he responded with annoyance.



‚ÄúDamn dude, chill. I'm just trying to help. We can just skip this week's meeting okay?‚Äù I said, trying to make eye contact.



‚ÄúYeah fine,‚Äù he whispered while facing his body farther from mine.



I got out of the car and he raced off. As I got into my room I felt so annoyed. It felt like he blew me off. I had projects that needed to be worked on. I needed his help and input on things. I knew if it was the other way around he'd be pissed off.¬†



As the morning came along, I started to cool down. If he needed space I should give it to him. Maybe I needed a break too.



The week went by without me hearing from him. It wasn't that out of the ordinary to go a week without hearing from him but after the way he was acting, I was definitely anxious to see him again.¬†



We typically hung out on Saturday afternoon so I texted him on Friday to make sure we were still good to meet up. He gave me a few excuses for why he couldn't meet but I convinced him.



As we met up at our normal place I saw him walk in as I sat at the table. I've never seen him so lifeless. His hair was greasy and his clothes were unkempt. I saw his red eyes and the bags underneath them to match from the other side of the room.¬†



He made eye contact with me and put on the fakest smile I have ever seen in my life.¬†



He walked to the table and sat down with way too much fake enthusiasm.¬†¬†



‚ÄúHey Jake sorry I've been so busy. I want to hear the progress you've made and what new stuff you have going on!‚Äù Thomas stated with Inauthentic cheer.¬†



I paused and squinted my eyes at him. Waiting for it to be a joke or something. Normally I have to fight him to talk about myself but now he is telling me to go first?



‚ÄúUm, no worries. You needed some space. I can respect that. But can I ask again if everything is okay? You can go first if you want, I really don't mind.‚Äù I said but was met with the still-lasting plastic smile of my friend.



‚ÄúPlease, you go,‚Äù Thomas said through his teeth while his smile was starting to break and the tone of voice was flat.¬†



I didn't want to keep pushing him. Him sitting and listening to me talk was way better than him storming out because he didn't want to talk first.



I started to tell him what I was working on and showed him some mock-ups I had. I must've talked for an hour straight without interruptions. That was unheard of from him. We would always bounce back and forth, sometimes interrupting each other with ideas. It never felt rude. It's just how we talked.¬†



In the hour of my talking, I left so many spaces for him to resound to me or give input. The conversation was so bare and boring like an awkward first date where I'm doing all the talking.¬†



For the first time in our whole friendship, I ran out of things to say.



‚ÄúAlright, I appreciate you giving me space to talk but I'd love to hear what you have going on,‚Äù I said with hope but was only met with glossy eyes looking back at mine. He sat frozen looking at me. Looking like he was going to talk but sat for a good minute before responding to me.



‚ÄúWell, this was nice. Thanks for meeting up with me. I think I should get going.‚Äù He said while pushing himself back in his chair to stand up.¬†



‚ÄúThomas please stay and tell me what is going on‚Ä¶please,‚Äù I begged him while he fought the urge to leave that restaurant.¬†



Without making eye contact he slowly sat back down. We sat in silence as I waited for him to speak up. I was only met with brief glimpses that held embarrassment and shame. I started to get even more worried but he finally spoke up.



‚ÄúOkay fine I'll talk, but please don't tell anyone else what I‚Äôm about to tell you.‚Äù Thomas managed to say to me while looking at his shoes.¬†



I was prepared for him to tell me he killed someone with the way he was talking and acting. I dug my fingernails into the side of my thigh to prepare myself to not react to whatever wild thing was about to come out of his mouth.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I have writer's block.‚Äù He whispered with guilt.¬†



‚ÄúWait, what? Writer's block? You scared me!‚Äù I said with relief.



‚ÄúSeriously? I thought of all the people you would get it,‚Äù he said with frustration finally meeting my eyeline.¬†



‚ÄúNo, that's not what I met, I was just trying to say-‚Äù I replied as I got interrupted.



‚ÄúThis isn't just a case of writer's block. This is something so much worse. I have nothing. Nada! That isn't me. I have no place in my mind to escape. No on-going stories I can add to during the day. When I sit down at my desk every night to write I just stare at the screen, mindless. Sometimes sure, I feel stuck or a little lost. Maybe I need some time to map a storyline out. But do you know what I do when that happens? I move on to another story. Or work on a character or‚Ä¶I don't know. I work on *something,* but I have nothing. Nothing at all. My mind is blank. No ideas.‚Äù He sat for a moment thinking. I gave him the space that he needed until he gathered his thoughts ‚ÄúI am nothing if I don't have my ability to create‚Äù He admitted with a deep breath.¬†



‚ÄúListen, this will pass. I promise. Every single writer loses inspiration at some point. You will find a spark again. You just need to push through it. Go on a trip, get away, go do something new.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou don't understand. I've tried everything I can. I feel so empty.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúCome on! I know you got this. How about we go do something fun tomorrow? Maybe you need to stop trying to get an idea. That's how we've gotten some of our best stories, right? While messing around doing something dumb?‚Äù I said as I saw a slight glimmer of hope in his smile.



‚ÄúYeah okay. Let's give it a shot. Why not, I've got nothing left to lose.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúGreat, pick me up at noon tomorrow and we can go ride roller coasters or something?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúSure, I can do that.‚Äù He remarked as I saw the tiniest bit of the old Thomas start to peak through his hard new shell.



That next day, everything started to fall apart.



I was spending the morning just hanging out around my house. Not really watching the time or anything. I was just walking through my kitchen when I glanced at the clock on my oven ‚Äò1:03‚Äô I read as my heart sank. I looked at my phone praying that I had a notification from him saying he was going to be late but I was met with an even worse message.



*‚ÄòOn my way over‚Äô Sent at 11:45.*¬†



The pit in my stomach only deepened as I read the sent time. I thought he just bailed on me, I never imagined something happened to him.



I tried to call him over and over again but his phone went straight to voicemail. I tried to get in contact with other people he knew but didn't have many of their contacts. After what felt like an eternity I got a text from him.¬†



*‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the Newbridge hospital room 501, get here asap.‚Äù*¬†



I jumped in my car and got there as fast as I could.¬†



I finally made it to the hospital. Unsure what I was going to see when I got to his room. It was a good sign that he was the one to text me, but why was he so vague?¬†



The room I entered was filled with the sound of a loud clicking keyboard and a focused Thomas. He had a large bandage on his left forearm with many cuts and bruises covering his whole body.¬†



‚ÄúTom? Oh my gosh, what happened?‚Äù I said in shock but was only met with a bright glowing smile from my very happy friend.



‚ÄúThe best thing ever. That's what happened!‚Äù He replied giddy as a little kid.¬†



‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? Did you crash your car on your way over? How badly are you hurt?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúStop, stop. None of that matters. I'm fine. What really matters is that I got a story Idea. That's what I'm typing up now. Oh man, I feel so alive right now!‚Äù He proclaimed as he passionately typed on his laptop.¬†



‚ÄúWhat? That's awesome, how did you get an idea yesterday?‚Äù I asked as I got closer to my friend in his hospital bed. He suddenly stopped and took his eyes off his computer screen for the first time since I entered the room.



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I flipped my car.‚Äù Thomas said while folding his laptop screen to see me better¬†



‚ÄúYou.. you flipped it? Oh my gosh, are you okay?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes I'm fine, but I don't think you understand, I got my idea when I flipped my car.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúWell is your story about a car accident or something?‚Äù I said while leaning in.



‚ÄúNo that's the thing. It has nothing to do with a car. I just‚Ä¶ I don't know if I can't even explain it. My tire popped out of nowhere. My car did a complete barrel roll. I was in mid-air for maybe five seconds at most. You know how some people say their whole life flashes before their eyes when they think they are about to die? That kind of happened but it was different for me. Those five seconds felt like hours. I remember accepting the fact that I was going to die. I felt it in my bones. I gripped down on my steering wheel and closed my eyes. I thought I was going to see death but I didn't. I saw a complete storyline. A beginning, middle, and end. I saw characters, plot lines, twists, and turns. A whole beautiful story. I don't know how to explain it but when I thought I was going to die, it cured my writer's block. I can't believe that's what it took.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúThat's great man. I'm glad some good came out of it.‚Äù I smiled¬†



‚ÄúNo, no, it isn't just *some good* this is huge I feel better!‚Äù I saw something strange in him at that moment. He looked terrible. Sure, he could have looked way worse considering he flipped his freaking car but It was shocking to see all those cuts. Yet, he had such a fire behind his eyes. At what first seemed like a good passion started to feel like an obsession. Like Gollum holding the one true ring.¬†



I didn't end up staying long as some family showed up soon after me. I didn't want to overstay my welcome.¬†



Fortunately, he wasn't in the hospital for long. I met up with him in person just a couple days later because he seemed excited to talk about new projects.¬†



I was really hoping when I saw him face to face that scary look in his eye would be gone but I was sorely mistaken. I saw him and was met with not only a crazed look in his eye but more cuts and buries.¬†



He slammed down a binder and several notebooks onto the table in front of us. He didn't even look me in the eye or ask me how I was. He immediately started to run through his ideas and talk a million miles an hour. I interrupted him just minutes after he started.



‚ÄúThomas,‚Äù I said as I was met with a glair for interrupting. ‚ÄúSlow down, have you slept since you got in that car accident?‚Äù He blinked at me slowly and glanced around as if he was just coming out of a coma.¬†



‚ÄúNo, I haven't slept much really. But now that I have Ideas, I can't sleep. I don't want to lose them. I can't go back to not having ideas. I'm nothing without them.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúStop saying that.‚Äù We stared at each other blankly for what felt like forever. ‚ÄúCan you tell me how you got more injuries?‚Äù I said as he broke eye contact and tried to go back to his piles of papers on the table. ‚ÄúHey, answer me. I‚Äôm worried about you. Please talk to me.‚Äù He looked around timidly then started to whisper.¬†



‚ÄúOkay, I'll talk. After I crashed my car, I got that amazing idea. I got my first drift down in record time. It was coming together great. But I fell into a depression again after I finished it. I was hoping my writer's block curse was broken. I thought ideas would just start to magically come out of my head. However, that wasn't the case. The accident helped me come up with just that one idea. Then nothing. But then I realized. If a near-death experience gave me an idea, what if I just almost died again? And‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶it worked. I went for a swim in the ocean yesterday to clear my head and got caught in a terrible current. I gave up and started to drown when a surfer grabbed me out of the water. As I started to struggle in the water, pictures started coming into my head. Fully formed stories. I felt like I was dying but I didn't care. Something happens to me when I think I'm going to die.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúOkay, maybe you are overthinking this. What if we tried bungee jumping or something? Something a little bit more controlled?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúNo, I tried that. I have to fully give in to death. I can't be scared. I can't do something that makes my stomach drop, I have to think I'm about to die. Maybe it's my brain's last-ditch effort to try and keep me alive. My brain knows the thing to keep me most motivated to stay alive would be to give me a story idea that I just have to write down. Little does it know it could be the thing that ultimately kills me in the end.‚Äù He said with a chuckle as he sipped his coffee.¬†



‚ÄúThomas, don't say that. This will not be how you die. I won't let you just kill yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúFine, then you tell me how on earth am I supposed to stop doing this? I found a surefire way to come up with amazing ideas and I'm supposed to just stop?¬† I'm sure I can find a controlled way to almost die. And even if I don't, I will die doing what I love most.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúI can not believe you are just accepting this as your fate. It is selfish of you to be okay with just dying one day. Think of how me and your family will feel without you. You have to think of more than just yourself here‚Ä¶please.‚Äù I begged my friend.¬†



‚ÄúJake, I have no plans to die. I will be fine. I'm not going to just throw myself around every day trying to kill myself.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúFine, just please try and be as safe as you can be. I mean, as safe as someone purposely trying to die can be.‚Äù I said with disbelief at what just came out of my mouth.¬†



I walked away from that conversation confused and worried. My friend seemed truly happy for the first time in so, so, long but, I couldn't rest easy knowing at any minute he could be dying somewhere. I always felt like I needed to go to his house or call him just to make sure he wasn't in the middle of trying to escape death.¬†



Every time I saw him he had the best ideas he's ever had. He was also having great success with the things he was coming up with. He was making money from posting stories online and even got a book deal. I saw my friend beaming with joy. It was so hard to be happy for him. His happiness was always in the frame of his injured body. A new cast or bandage appears weekly. One day he barely had his voice left. I saw a mark around his neck where a noose had been. The man escaped a self-induced hanging, all for a short story about a magical car that people disappear into or something.¬†



My friend was fading and he was fading fast. He was a victim to himself. Addicted to almost dying and the high of ideas that came from it.¬†



He got put on suicide watch at one point. Spent a few weeks in a mental hospital. After he got out of course he just started back up again but realized he had to find methods that didn't leave obvious marks on his skin. He couldn't look like he wanted to die. To most people around him, he seemed fine. Just passionate about his writing projects, in reality, he was still almost dying multiple times a week.¬†



Maybe I should have told someone he was still *almost* killing himself. No, I definitely should have told someone. I just knew if I told someone he would just resent me and keep doing what he was doing once they let him go again.¬†



He was actually suicidal. He wasn't mentally unwell. It was the best he had ever been, his happiness just came with an extra cost and risk



I stopped asking him how he was almost killing himself. I knew he did it again when he had a sudden surge of ideas. He got really good at controlling it. He had streamlined ways of electrocution and drowning that seemed to work a lot of the time. Although, I think he was losing brain cells because of it. When I would read some of his work there would be more misspellings than usual. He seemed to have trouble with math and he never did before. He was slowly killing his brain but he didn't care.¬†



This all brings us to a few days ago. As I said at the beginning of this post, Thomas went missing a week ago. Well, most of you probably caught on already, but Thomas was found dead in his car at the bottom of a lake.



It would seem his normal ways of controlling ‚Äò*almost death‚Äô* didn't cut it for him this time. He took the two first ways he almost died and put them together. Almost dying in his car and almost dying in the water. It felt rather poetic.



After I found out my friend died I didn't know how to feel. I felt guilty for not doing more, and then I realized the second Thomas almost died the first time in that car when he was truly gone. That's when I lost my best friend. Writing went from a hobby to an obsession; an addiction. Something clicked in his head or shook out of place when that damn Subaru flipped. It took my friend and gave me something back that was unrecognizable. He couldn't live in reality anymore, he was only happy in his imaginary land that existed somewhere deep within him. A place I couldn't get to.¬†



I miss him dearly. I know he died doing what he loved but that doesn't make it hurt less.¬†



Yesterday in the midst of my grieving, I made a huge mistake. My curiosity got the better of me. Part of me wanted to see what the hype was all about, another part of me wanted to feel closer to him. So I did something dumb.¬†

I went to the same lake he was found in. I tied one end of a rope to a brick and the other end to my leg. I had a knife in my pocket and I jumped into the water.¬†



It was a small brick so I didn't sink fast, but wow was I amazed.¬†



I could feel the pressure building up in my head. My lungs desperately wanted to take a deep breath but I held back as long as I could. I reached for the knife in my pocket right after I hit the water, but it felt like a lifetime before the blade reached the rope that was pulling me to my death. I started to cut my way through with all my strength. I started to see flashing in front of my eyes. A moving picture. It was happening‚Ä¶Time was slowing, my mind was sharpening, and ideas flowing. I couldn't resist the urge to try and take a breath any longer, it felt like my body was splitting into two. One part just wanted air and the other half wanted to stay in the water and keep downloading this idea that was infiltrating my head. Even if it meant that it killed me. At that moment I wanted to live and I wanted to die.¬†



The rope broke and I swam to the top. I burst through the water and gasped for air. I got to the edge of the lake and collapsed in exhaustion. I sat looking up at the sky. My heart was pounding and my lungs felt a sense of relief with every deep breath I took.¬†



I went home to write down the idea I had and couldn't believe the feeling I had. All I wanted to do was almost die again.¬†



Now it's all I can think about. It's not even completely about getting story ideas. I wasn't really struggling with that. But when I was in that water‚Ä¶I don't even know if I can put it into words. It's like something in that water wanted me to die. Like it was taunting me to not live. My body still took over and made sure I lived, but part of me felt okay with dying.¬†¬†



I am terrified that this wasn't just the ending to Thomas, but the end of me too.¬†



I don't think writers are disturbed or messed up in the head. We aren't psychopaths or serial killers. I think we are just desperate. Desperate for that high of an idea. But please, I beg of you. Don't go looking for ideas in desperate places, because one day, those ideas will kill you.¬†¬†

1hxhwnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1hxhwnz/my_house_keeps_moving_when_i_sleep/,My House Keeps Moving When I Sleep,"Last week I noticed something strange, when I woke up from an abnormally long sleep my house wasn‚Äôt where it was supposed to be. I live in the suburbs of salt lake city Utah in a house that‚Äôs pretty old but for some reason when I woke up that day my house was in a field.

A wheat field that seemed to stretch endlessly to the horizon. I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was dreaming or not so I just got in bed and closed my eyes. The next thing I knew my house was back where it was supposed to be.

Though that wasn‚Äôt the last time this happened. About two days later things started to feel off. Everything felt like a dream, as if nothing was real and it was all in my head. But no matter what I did I couldn‚Äôt get rid of the feeling.

Yesterday I noticed that all the plants outside were gone. I looked at doorbell camera footage suspecting they were stolen but from what I saw the plants were never there to begin with. I texted my wife who planted said plants but she claimed she has never brought a plant in or around the house since we moved in.

I called my dad asking him about the plants but he said the same thing. I think im starting to go crazy or something because I could have sworn there was two pots in front of the house with some orange and red flowers and a tree out front. In fact now it seemed that my house was the only one without a tree on the property.

Anyways I have decided to write things down and post them online or where ever I put this for now this Is just a note to myself written on a word document.

1/8/24

I got out of bed this morning and had a donut and coffee for breakfast. My wife leaves for her work earlier than me. It makes the mornings peaceful and quiet. But sometimes, especially times like this it makes me feel quite lonely. When I walked out the front door I looked across the street to see my neighbors didn‚Äôt have and trees or bushes. As I turned my head and looked down the street I realized no one had any bushes or trees. Everyone gardens were empty patches of dirt bricks laid in circles around nothing.

A feeling of uneasiness filled me but I decided to worry because it was probably just a dream. I debated whether or not I should still go to work or take the day off. As I stood on my front porch it hit me, if I was dreaming I could wake myself up or at least become lucid. I did everything I could but nothing seemed to work. I walked inside and went to lay down for a bit when I hit my hip on the counter ‚Äú*FUCK‚Äù*¬†I shouted out loud.

The sharp agonizing pain or bumping into a marble corner was indescribable it hurt a million times worse than it should have. I looked at my hip and noticed I was bleeding. It wasn‚Äôt bad just a small cut but it still hurt enough for me to call it quits for the day.

When I pulled out my phone to call in sick I couldn‚Äôt find my bosses contact. And I couldn‚Äôt remember his number, and for some strange reason I couldn‚Äôt remember his name or hers i completely forgot what they looked like what they sounded like. And then I couldn‚Äôt remember where I worked.

I sat down trying to think but I started to question if I even had a job. Nothing felt real and I had no idea what was happening.

I think I just need to get some sleep.

I woke up to loud bang.

I jumped out of bed dazed and confused I was sweating and I couldn‚Äôt remember what I was doing asleep so late until I saw my laptop open beside me. I heard footsteps that crept closer to the door. ‚ÄúWHO ARE YOU‚Äù I shouted the bedroom door swung open and I saw my wife. ‚ÄúYour home? This early?‚Äù I asked ‚Äúits seven, I‚Äôm late.‚Äù ‚Äúoh shit its seven but that doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I feel like just two minutes ago I was going to go to work but then some weird stuff happened, and speaking of that I need to tell yo‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúwork? You got a job?‚Äù

‚Äúwhat do you mean you got a job?‚Äù

‚Äúyou said you were going to work why didn‚Äôt you tell me that you got a job?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you saying I‚Äôve had this job for ten years I- I don‚Äôt know what else to say.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

‚Äúwell no there‚Äôs a bunch of weird stuff happening and I‚Äôm losing my mind about it‚Äù

‚Äúlike the plants you wont shut up about‚Äù

‚Äúwell yeah but the neighbors don‚Äôt have any plants didn‚Äôt you see?‚Äù

‚Äúhoney you need to get some rest, I don‚Äôt know what has gotten into you.‚Äù

‚Äúwhat?‚Äù

My wife never called me honey before

‚Äúits just you need to sleep‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been sleeping. ‚Äù

‚Äúwell okay then. I need to run to the store and buy some dogfood.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? For who?‚Äù

‚Äúfor us silly.‚Äù

Her voice sounded strange. Monotone and lacking any emotion at all

‚Äúwhile I‚Äôm gone you should really go sleep‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, What do you mean for us?‚Äù

‚Äúfor our dog its hungry‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a dog‚Äù

She looked at me with a blank stare and said

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what your talking about he‚Äôs right outside.‚Äù

I turned around and looked out the back door and saw a small sheep dog running around on a yard full of dirt I couldn‚Äôt remember if there was grass in the backyard and then I started to remember having a dog.

I looked back at my wife and I couldn‚Äôt seem to fully recognize her. Her face felt off. I could recognize her voice even the strange way she was talking to me but her face I just couldn‚Äôt remember even when looking directly at her. I made myself dinner and went to my bed but my wife never came to join. I shouted her name a few times until I forgot what her name was. It was like I had been shouting gibberish I got out of bed and felt lost.

I walked around the dark house that now felt like I different world and couldn‚Äôt find my wife but then it hit me a realization, a fear. I was alone. And I never had a wife. I keep reading this over and over and over again but I cant remember anything I didn‚Äôt type in the last five minuets.

I‚Äôm losing my mind.

I have decided to just go to sleep and figure things out in the morning.

I woke up around 3 ish in the morning I was cold so I got up to turn on the heater but when I looked outside I saw a forest I ran to every window in the house to be met with the same sight. A pitch black forest, one of those it eats you alive forests. I couldn‚Äôt believe what my eyes were seeing I decided to go back to sleep and pray that this was just some weird dream but as I was getting in bed I saw a not on my nightstand it read ‚Äú*don‚Äôt talk to them, don‚Äôt listen to them, don't look at them and never leave the house.‚Äù*

The role primarily involves being an extra set of hands during weekday mornings and evenings. The schedule would be 7AM - 11AM and 5PM - 9PM, with Fridays after 11AM and Saturdays off. The children are in daycare from 9AM - 5:30PM.

In the mornings, two hours are built in for flexible, child-related chores (e.g., tidying up, laundry). On Sundays, we would love assistance taking the kids to explore local areas and engage in cultural activities such as hikes, museums, and festivals‚Äîthings we currently struggle to do due to lack of help.

We live in a small New Jersey town about an hour outside of NYC. There‚Äôs a bus to Newark directly outside our house and a bus to NYC just two blocks away. A train to NYC is also available, though it‚Äôs a 25-minute walk or 4-8 minutes by car or bike. The center of town is a 7-minute walk, with amenities such as a pharmacy, convenience store, library, bank, coffee shop, restaurants, and a salon.

The main challenge is that we do not have a car for exclusive au pair use, as driving is not a required part of this role (no school drop-offs or pick-ups). We‚Äôre considering either providing a used bicycle, along with a transportation stipend of around $75 per week for Uber or Lyft. We imagine that the au pair would use public transportation and focus much of their exploration in NYC, with weekend trips to Washington DC, Boston, and surrounding areas. 

We want to create a mutually beneficial arrangement where everyone is happy. While the cultural exchange aspect of having an au pair feels well-suited to the activities we hope to do, we‚Äôre unsure if the lack of a car might be a dealbreaker or if this setup would be better suited for a weekend nanny or babysitter.

I (18F) and my now Ex bf (18M) dated only a couple months ago and I wanted it to last. I was raised Christian and rejected Christianity during my early teen years when I surrounded myself with people who made me believe the worst parts of myself were true, I was convinced that I was bisexual, I eventually tried to commit su*c*de and only after moving to a new state, letting go of my last relationship (that lasted 1 1/2 years) I found God again and I am now the happiest I have ever been, and I know that this is because I have found Christ and have been spreading love and the word of God. I started dating‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll call him A‚Ä¶ in April 2024 and as our relationship went along we had simple conversations and arguments about serious things and finding a middle ground but consistently throughout our relationship I felt like there were too many people in it, his mom and his sister. Constantly any time I went to his house I would either get the death stare from his sister or his mom asking about every single detail, though his mom was very sweet and welcoming to me she constantly didn‚Äôt understand my boundaries.  I told A that his mom and sister made me a bit uncomfortable and just for him to talk to them, because I saw a future with him and wanted to work it out early on so that there wouldn‚Äôt be any issues later on. That is just one reason why I wanted to break up because even after he ‚Äútalked‚Äù to them it never stopped and his sister never made me feel welcome, of course she is not obligated to, but I feel like she hated me just because I was dating her younger brother and that did not sit right with me. When it comes to the religious aspect. A told me he was Christian before we started dating, when we first met he said ‚ÄúI thought I fumbled because you are such a sweet Christian girl so I thought you‚Äôd never go out with me‚Äù I know that he knew how much of a Christian I was not only that but how much it meant to me. A week before we broke up A and I were on the phone and got into a deep conversation about religion just for him to say ‚Äúyeah, I don‚Äôt believe in god but‚Ä¶‚Äù WHAT?! You are telling me you don‚Äôt believe in God after dating a Christian for several months??? I decided to tell him that we needed a break and though it hurt I needed time to think. I don‚Äôt appreciate being lied to, I don‚Äôt take it lightly. The day we met up to talk things out, I approached him like normal and asked if we would talk inside the coffee shop.

- Tommy lives in poverty with Tubbo

- Tubbo works in a coffee shop? Schlatt is a frequent customer there, but only goes there to meet Tubbo. Tommy warns him that it's too late for him, that they're too old to be adopted or something, discouraging Tubbo from trusting Schlatt. This may or may not be from an entirely different fanfic tho--

- Tommy works for Purpled and gets shady jobs from him, cant recall if Tubbo is aware of this.

- Tommy gets a gig to work undercover in a vampires mansion as a servant to gather intel. I dont remember who the vampire here might be, but could be Dream

- Tommy gets sponsored with a phone and a bicycle
 
- At some point he gets beaten up while cycling home

- The person he is gathering intel for is Wilbur (who is secretly also a vampire)

- Sam works in the vampire mansion as a engineer or something of sorts. theres a robot?

- There's a moment in the story where the other servants really try to get Tommy to eat some sandwiches and he either refuses or something i really can't remember this part but it really emphasizes how underfed Tommy is and how sad it is that he considers food so valuable

But few have managed to capture the attention of Generation Y like Madison Zhao. If you've spent any time scrolling through her feed, you know exactly why she's become a trendsetter for millions. It's not merely about the clothes or the air travel; she can tell an inspiring story in line with what a generation looks forward to living.

Madison Zhao's Instagram is a reflection of a life of excess and beauty and aspiration, but what brings her to my attention is just how authentic she feels in that space that tends to be lambasted for excessive staging. Her posts are aspirational and relatable at the same time. From exotic beach vacations to cozy coffee shop moments, Madison balances high-end living with a down-to-earth personality that feels accessible. That is why many of her followers, especially in their 20s and 30s, look up to her as a role model.

It's not just about the aesthetic appeal, however. Madison's social media presence is also empowerment. She has also openly shared her journey from having to fight hard in a very competitive industry just to establish herself and to this day enjoy such great success. Her story resonates with a version of success for many of us that isn't born out of privilege or luck but is hard work, self-belief, and resilience. Most of her posts contain captions about personal growth, mental health, and the importance of staying true to one's dreams. It's a message that resonates so deeply with Generation Y, who are navigating work, relationships, and self-identity complexities.

If you‚Äôve found inspiration in Madison Zhao‚Äôs Instagram life, it‚Äôs not just because she‚Äôs living a lavish lifestyle, but because she‚Äôs doing it with a sense of authenticity and purpose that makes her feel real. For many, she‚Äôs not just an influencer; she‚Äôs a reminder that it‚Äôs possible to create your own version of success‚Äîone that reflects your values and aspirations.",1,1736442516.0,u_wavemaker7,0,1.0,False
1hxhmkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hxhmkn/aio_or_is_this_controlling/,AIO or is this controlling? ,"I‚Äôm 27 (almost 28), my boyfriend is 28 (almost 29) and the other night I spanked our dog on the butt because she tries to act tough with our neighbors huge German shepherd and I‚Äôm afraid one day he‚Äôs literally going to eat her lol. So after I spanked her (did not hit her it was a spank) and told her no bad girl, she came in and I tried to shut the door and she tried to get back out and I didn‚Äôt see it fast enough and kinda closed the door on her, but it didn‚Äôt hurt her. 
Beside the point my boyfriend wanted to argue about it and said I was abusing our dog? I just kept quiet, and he went to bed. Didn‚Äôt have supper or anything and had a ton of groceries to put away and he just left me to scroll on his phone. That night he cuddled me all night until I fell asleep. 
The next morning he‚Äôs taking me to work hasn‚Äôt said one single word to me, didn‚Äôt make me coffee, anything which is highly unlike him. So I brushed it off until we got to my job and I asked if there was a reason he wasn‚Äôt speaking to me. He still wouldn‚Äôt talk and I asked if he would tell me why. He said ‚Äúbro I‚Äôm about to blast music get the fuck out‚Äù and I told him he needed to grow up and I left the car. He didn‚Äôt talk to me until about 5:30pm and I asked what was going on and he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having new internet installed‚Äù and then proceeded to bring up the part of our dog and so on. Eventually he just hung up on me while I was trying to explain to him about something I was upset about. The rest of the night didn‚Äôt go well. 
He went to sleep pretty early, and woke up at 5am just scrolling watching videos on his phone ‚Äî this really gets to me. Every single morning he just endlessly scrolls, reads posts on twitter, fb, etc. I tried to find my phone and at this point I figured he went through it (which is fine I have nothing to hide, he has my password but I do not have his) but I found it and looked at the time and went to the bathroom and when I came back he started accusing me of hiding and deleting stuff on my phone? I wanted to just go back to sleep so badly but he made it literally impossible. 
He finally went to his office to work, I wanted to break the tension and ask if he was hungry and he said no. I just laid back in bed but then he came back when I was comfy relaxing just chilling by myself and proceeded to just scroll endlessly on his phone. Then pulls out a package of crackers. I was so irritated at this point and I grabbed them and I said no I was going to make breakfast and he was fighting to get the crackers back and they spilled everywhere. He said ‚Äúif you make me anything to eat I‚Äôm throwing it right on the floor I don‚Äôt give a fuck‚Äù and I said over some damn crackers?! And he got up to leave (he does this a lot, and it bothers me too ‚Äî he also has my location 24/7 but I don‚Äôt have his. If I turn mine off then all hell breaks loose ‚Äî and he‚Äôll go on DND) and asked where his truck key was. It‚Äôs 27¬∞ outside and we‚Äôre about to be in a snow storm and the truck has no heat right now so why would I take it anywhere? I gave him the key and said do whatever you need to. He took the key, his computers, and left in his car. Before he left he told me that I will have to start getting an Uber to work and I have to figure out how to get my child (from her gma‚Äôs an hour away). He uses this against me every time there‚Äôs a little inconvenience for him. I tried talking to him and I was crying asking if he just wanted to experience other girls, if that‚Äôs what he truly wanted (watches weird porn, talks about being with ‚Äúbadder bitches‚Äù, tells his buddy on discord he‚Äôs gonna be with all these women in different countries) because why the hell does this happen at least once a month‚Ä¶? I thought since the new year, things were gonna become a fresh start at least that‚Äôs what it seemed. He literally just laughed while I cried. 

My car was totaled by a hit and run last may and it‚Äôs been hell since. But I‚Äôm hoping to get a car again soon. He constantly leaves me at the house, I never have access to the vehicles, I work my ass off at a full time job, I work my ass off at home, I take immensely great care of him.

I‚Äôm MVL passer who took the test in UP. Since college, I‚Äôve always been one of the last to finish an exam and I‚Äôm also so easily distracted when it comes to noise and movement. The bar exam isn‚Äôt a silent exam. You can hear everyone else in the room as well as the bar staff walking and talking in the halls. Malas din ako since I was always either near the doors to the hallways or the windows next to the road. Since I was always one of the last to finish, I could hear the other test takers one by one packing up and leaving after they finish. I could hear the proctors talking to them as well as the other examinees talking to each other. Sometimes, di mo talaga mapigilan and you‚Äôll end up listening to their conversations especially if may issue yung katabi mo with their examplify lmao. 

If you get easily distracted like I do, I would really recommend using loop earplus!! Rubber earplugs have been allowed the past few years and it really did make a world of a difference. I liked my experience with loop since it was the noise counseling is just enough so that you can still hear the bells and instructions of the exam proctors!

After my last post about dopamine depletion resonated with so many of you, I wanted to share the practical steps that actually helped me rewire my brain. No theoretical fluff ‚Äì just real, tested methods from someone who's been in the trenches.

Let me be real with you: implementing these changes wasn't smooth sailing. There were days I fell back into old patterns, moments of frustration, and times I questioned if it was worth it. But looking back now, these strategies fundamentally changed how I approach life and productivity.

Here's what actually worked for me:

* Morning Sanctuary: I replaced the instant phone grab with 30 minutes of peace. Just water, window gazing, and letting my mind settle. The first week was torture ‚Äì my hand would literally twitch toward my phone. Now? It's the most peaceful part of my day. The urge to check notifications eventually fades, I promise.

* Movement Medicine: Skip the intense workout pressure. I discovered that simple movement ‚Äì like walking without podcasts or dancing badly while making breakfast ‚Äì gives me a more sustainable dopamine boost than endless doomless scrolling ever did. Your body literally rewards you for basic movement, no gym membership required.

* Real Connection Reset: Having coffee with friends, phones face-down, felt weirdly uncomfortable at first. Those silent moments where we'd usually hide in our screens? They turned into the deepest conversations I've had in years. The human connection hits different when you're fully present.

* Analog Joy: Found myself picking up origami (of all things). There's something deeply satisfying about creating something physical with your hands. Whether it's drawing, writing in a journal, or building something ‚Äì tangible activities give you that dopamine hit without the digital drain.

* Single-Task Revolution: Turns out, my brain wasn't designed for constant task-switching. When I work, I just work. When I rest, I actually rest (revolutionary, I know). It felt impossible at first, but like training a puppy, my mind gradually learned to stay focused.

* Evening Rituals: Created a proper shutdown sequence for my day instead of streaming until my eyes blur. Sometimes it's reading an actual book, sometimes just sitting with my thoughts. My sleep quality skyrocketed, and morning-me is way less grumpy.

Here's the real talk: this isn't about becoming some digital monk or never enjoying Netflix again. I still use technology, but now I'm in control, not the other way around. Some days are better than others, and that's completely okay.

Remember, these changes took months, not days. Start small, be patient with yourself, and know that every tiny victory counts.

Drop a comment about which strategy you're going to try first ‚Äì let's keep supporting each other on this journey.

Edit: Since some of you asked ‚Äì yes, this is all from personal experience. The struggles, the setbacks, and the small wins are all real. Thanks for creating this space where we can have honest conversations about something we all face.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",197,1736442118.0,selfimprovement,16,0.97,False

1hxh8l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1hxh8l8/balancing_bpd_attachment_and_a_potential_new/,"Balancing BPD, Attachment, and a Potential New Relationship","I‚Äôm working on understanding myself better and unpacking some deeply rooted attachment issues. For as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve struggled to differentiate between physical intimacy and genuine emotional connection. Most of the people I‚Äôve dated, I hooked up with on the first day we met. Looking back, I don‚Äôt think I truly liked any of them in the way I thought I did. Even something as simple as a kiss has the power to make me feel attached, and I often confuse that attachment with actual feelings.

My last relationship officially ended in March 2023, though we had been in and out of contact for a while before fully cutting ties. It took me until September to finally get over him. Since then, I‚Äôve had very little in the way of romantic interactions. I did meet someone recently, and though I didn‚Äôt want anything to happen, we ended up hooking up, and I became attached. But deep down, I know he‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm looking for in a partner. He reminds me a lot of my ex, and I‚Äôve realized I have a pattern of being drawn to people who don‚Äôt offer what I need in a healthy relationship.

Then something random happened. I saw an ad on Instagram for my favorite coffee shop‚Äîthey were running a promotion where you could get a free coffee if you showed them your Bumble profile. I hate dating apps, but I love that coffee shop, so I downloaded the app just for the free coffee. While swiping, I ended up matching with a few people and having a surprisingly good conversation with one of them. He suggested grabbing breakfast, and since I was having a rough time, I figured, why not? Afterward, I deleted the app.

We had breakfast together, and I was pleasantly surprised. He‚Äôs older, mature, logical, and very humble. Honestly, it feels different because I‚Äôm not used to being around healthy, secure people who actually want to get to know me. We went on a second date last night, and I‚Äôm finding myself drawn to him.

Here‚Äôs the thing, though‚ÄîI‚Äôm not ready for a relationship. I‚Äôve told him that, and he seems to understand. He‚Äôs very kind and incredibly smart. He mentioned that his last relationship was with someone who had bipolar disorder and DID, so he‚Äôs familiar with mental health struggles. He told me he sees a difference in me because I‚Äôm actively working on myself, I‚Äôm medicated, I have friends, and I genuinely want to improve.

What‚Äôs surprising to me is that I haven‚Äôt rushed into anything physical with him, which is very unlike my usual patterns. I think I like him, but I also know that I‚Äôm still navigating my BPD. I‚Äôve noticed that I feel ‚Äúhealed‚Äù when I‚Äôm single, but once I enter a relationship, my toxic tendencies tend to resurface.

He‚Äôs expressed that he‚Äôs hesitant because of my mental health, given his past experiences, but he‚Äôs also told me he knows how to navigate things if they come up. I think he likes me too, but I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. He‚Äôs a good person who‚Äôs already been through a lot, and I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm in a place to be what he needs right now.

I‚Äôm conflicted because I enjoy many things about him, but I don‚Äôt want to ruin something before it even starts or impulsively jump into a relationship. I also don‚Äôt want to set myself back when I‚Äôve been working so hard on my growth. Has anyone been in a similar situation, or do you have advice on how to approach this without causing harm to either of us?",1,1736441548.0,BorderlinePDisorder,1,0.67,False

Cimbali M29 Select from 2006, this was always my dream machine from when I started drinking espresso. 

I really appreciate the engineering of the replacable heat exchangers and their group heads. Left side is piped ""hot"" and will hold pretty steady with maybe 1-3 temp drop curve during extraction. Right side has the cooling pipes added and will drop 5-10 degrees during extraction. The cold incoming water flows through the group head, this is normally for 2-3 group selectrons but I wanted each side to have a different profile. This is measured by the temp probes inserted into the small infusing chamber.

-Dual pressure gauge with hydraulic pressure T line in between flowmeters (post check valve)

-Ceramic Boiler insulation

Motto tamp with perfect fit base. I have the spinner and WDT tool with dosing ring but usually just use the side of my finger to adjust a little if needed. AWS scales.

Water filtration is a small Watts system with pressure tank. Permeate pump and 90%ASOV. Omnipure calcite and corosex remineralization to bring TDS to a consistent 50ppm. Additional accumulator and Carbon/KDF post filter setup as a switchable bypass for a couple aquariums we have.

Prior to coming to France I studied French in high school and up until my GCSEs. I then practised it at university for 2 hours a week (during term time) for 3 years. This was 2 years of b1 study. 

Since being here I‚Äôve taken more lessons. I take 6 hours a week. I also am an au pair here, with two young children who only speak French. 

However I really feel stuck at about an a2-b1 level. I struggle having conversations with others. 

To try and get over this I‚Äôve tried to do different things. I keep a note of new words and phrases I find and add to my anki flashcards, which I do daily. I watch about 2 French movies a week, I read in French (at the moment I‚Äôve been reading Harry Potter in French). 

I also listen to podcasts. I‚Äôve listened to a lot of coffee break French and Languatalk. I have also spent a lot of time watching YouTube videos such as Simple French, Frenchpod101, Piece of French. 

I also try reading in French. I like reading opinions, subreddits and even Wikipedia articles on topics I like such as movies or books I‚Äôve read. 

I am trying to get more into the habit of going to language cafes to try to speak to adults in French but the difficulty I have is that I just don‚Äôt feel confident enough to do this. 

I don‚Äôt know how to really start a conversation with someone or what to even say. I want to improve and add some other things to do. I also struggle to think in French.

1hxh31r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1hxh31r/healthy_adult_male_just_diagnosed_with_pots_and/,Healthy adult male - just diagnosed with POTS and looking for guidance ,"Hey all, I (M, 28) have been struggling with debilitating brain fog, dizziness, and fatigue the last year or so, ever since a nasty covid infection. 

Before this bout with covid, I lived a very healthy lifestyle. Exercised five days a week (alternating cardio and weightlifting), took frequent walks, ate well, good social circle, lots of time in the sun, etc. However, a few months after covid kicked my ass, I suddenly noticed I had days where I felt ""drunk"" when I was lifting weights or running. Eventually, my symptoms worsened to the point that most days I feel tremendously out of it. If I stand upright or even sit up for short amounts of time, I get dizzy. Eating or drinking coffee makes me pass out and lowers my IQ by like 30 points. Many days, I don't feel safe driving because of sluggish decision-making and slowed reaction times. 

These symptoms have made my life hell for the past year. I can't think deeply about anything (my thoughts are fuzzy and scattered), I can't concentrate, and worst of all, I can't write. I'm a writer working in marketing for a living, and my supervisor has definitely noted that I'm not nearly as sharp or present as I used to be. I feel like I'm permanently stuck on the edge of a dream, unable to fully wake up and be present. 

I saw many doctors over the course of the past year. Allergists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, neurologists, etc., and have undergone a hundred tests. My blood is normal, no mono, no celiac, no allergies. I have no issues with anxiety or depression. I just wanted someone to answer my questions about why I suddenly can't drink coffee without becoming cognitively impaired. 

Finally, I discovered POTS as a potential cause. Symptoms seemed to check out. Got a tilt table test done a month back, and my PCP just let me know that it came back positive. I have POTS. Honestly, it was a huge relief to hear that. 

I just want to know: where do I go next? 

My PCP suggested psychiatry or neurology, but his neurology office just called me and said that POTS is more a cardiology issue than neurology. 

I want to get this treated ASAP. I have a life I want to get back to, and I've spent too long house-ridden because of my bad days. 

My PCP is getting me started on 150mg Wellbutrin to hopefully provide me some more energy and pick me up a bit. However, last year a neurologist was open-minded enough to prescribe me Adderall to combat my symptoms. The Adderall was great---for the first time in forever, I felt like myself again. I could think, write. However, I've since moved away and my prescription has run out. 

Do y'all think the Wellbutrin will be enough, or should I strive to get on Adderall again?

I mainly use a specialty roast coffee (used 2-6 weeks after roast date), however I also want to get into using a decaf specialty coffee later in the day as well as potentially a third, cheaper coffee (using specialty coffee 4-5 times a day is expensive!).

My main question is: do I have to (even slightly) re dial in each coffee as I switch between each coffee type?

For example, the coffee I use now is on 18 on my DF54. Let's say I buy a decaf that needs 16, and a grocery store coffee (in which case I'd switch to a pressurized portafilter cause the beans are not fresh) that needs 14. Is the DF54 able to ""remember"" these grind settings? I.e. once I have successfully dialed in say 18g in, 40g out in 28-32 sec for each type of coffee at each grind setting, can I switch between these grind settings and get the same results? I swear I have switched to another coffee to quickly dial in and when I go back to my grind settings of 18 for this certain kind of coffee, that 18 no longer works as it did just moments ago and I need to (slightly) re dial the coffee, implying that the grinder doesn't do a perfect job at remembering which settings work for each coffee, and that switching between grind settings slightly changes the stepless grinder mechanism.

Any advice?

**EDIT/TL:DR:**  should have phrased this better. I know you of course have to re dial in for each coffee type at the beginning of using it. I mean to ask if you can return to a previous grind setting and still get good results without re dialing in for the same coffee. For example, say I dial in coffee A perfectly at grind setting 16. Then, later in the day I want to drink decaf coffee B which after dialing in it uses grind setting 19. If I want to *go back* to making coffee A, do I need to re dial it in or can I just simply go back to 16 cause I already dialed it in at that setting? ",2,1736440821.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

1hxgw22,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hxgw22/the_worst_crime_scene_of_my_career/,The Worst Crime Scene of My Career,"I‚Äôve been a police officer in a small town for about 15 years. It‚Äôs not a big city, so most of the calls we get are about neighbor disputes, speeding, or occasionally about burglaries. Nothing too heavy. But this night was something different.

That night, I was on duty with a colleague when we got a call about persistent nighttime noise. A woman complained about muffled screams and loud sounds coming from a neighboring house, almost every night for a week. A routine noise complaint, but repeated enough to warrant attention. I volunteered to go alone, my partner was covering another area, and it sounded simple enough.

The house in question was on a quiet residential street, well-lit and unassuming. A modest home with an overgrown garden. The windows were closed, and not a single curtain covered the panes. Everything inside was dark.

I approached and knocked on the door. Once. Twice. Nothing. I was about to head back to my car when the door suddenly swung open.

A man stood there, shirtless, his hair disheveled, and his face slick with sweat. He stared at me with wild, feverish eyes. He looked to be in his forties, wiry but tense, like a coiled spring. Dark stains covered his chest and arms, irregular and some still wet.

""Good evening, sir. I‚Äôm here responding to a noise complaint"", I began calmly, trying not to react to his disheveled appearance. ""Is everything all right ?""

He didn‚Äôt answer at first, just stared at me. His lips quivered slightly, and his eyes darted past me, as if he was expecting someone else to show up.

""There‚Äôs no noise here"", he finally said, his voice raspy and uneven.

I couldn‚Äôt help but notice the stains on his body. They weren‚Äôt just sweat; they were darker, messier. I had to ask.

""Are you injured ? That stuff on you, it looks like blood.""

He glanced down at his chest, then let out a dry, nervous laugh. ""No. Nothing. You should leave"".

His tone shifted abruptly, from hesitant to aggressive. I took a step forward to get a better look at him, and he stepped back quickly, trying to close the door. I blocked it with my foot.

""Wait a second. I need to ask you a few questions. If everything‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll be on my way.""

""There‚Äôs nothing here ! Get out !"" he suddenly shouted, slamming the door harder. The force made me step back, and before I could react, he turned and bolted inside the house, disappearing down a hallway.

I started after him but stopped at the threshold. Instead, I called for backup. Dispatch confirmed a unit would arrive in about ten minutes. In the meantime, I decided to stay at the door, hoping the man would calm down or come back, but something felt wrong.

The air in the house was heavy, thick with an acrid smell I couldn‚Äôt quite place. It wasn‚Äôt just stale, it was deeper, more organic. I shone my flashlight into the hallway and took a tentative step inside.

The walls were dirty, scratched in places. A few dusty frames with faded photos hung crookedly. And somewhere deeper in the house, I could hear faint noises, whispers or low muffled groans.

I reached what looked like the living room. That‚Äôs when things took a dark turn.

In the center of the room was a wooden chair with straps attached to the armrests and back. The floor was covered in old newspapers, soaked with what looked like dried blood. On a small coffee table sat an array of tools, knives, pliers, and other implements, all rusted or stained. And the smell... It was overwhelming now, a putrid mix of decay and iron.

Behind me, I heard a creak. I spun around, and there he was, standing in a doorway. He held something metallic in his hand, something heavy.

""No... No... No... You shouldn‚Äôt have come inside"", he muttered.

I drew my weapon and ordered him to drop whatever he was holding. He didn‚Äôt. Instead, he smiled, a twisted, deranged grin. Then, he threw the object toward me and darted down another hallway, disappearing through a door I hadn‚Äôt noticed before.

I chased after him, my pulse pounding in my ears. I couldn‚Äôt let him escape, but every instinct screamed at me to turn around and wait for backup. Still, something drove me forward.

The door led to a staircase descending into the basement. The wooden steps creaked under my weight as I descended. My flashlight flickered slightly, or maybe it was just my shaking hand.

The basement was a nightmare.

It wasn‚Äôt large, but every inch of it was used for something horrifying. Meat hooks hung from the ceiling, some still occupied by‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even want to describe it. A table held a pile of clothing, likely belonging to the victims.

And in the corner was a cage. Inside was a woman, curled up and trembling. Her eyes were wide open but lifeless, like all hope had drained from her.

That‚Äôs when I realized the truth. This wasn‚Äôt his first time. This man was a predator, a monster in human form. And this house was just his latest stage.

When backup finally arrived, he was gone. We searched the house, the neighborhood, but it was as if he had vanished into thin air.

Investigators later discovered that the house didn‚Äôt even belong to him. It belonged to a family that had been missing for two months. Their fate remains a mystery.

To this day, I can‚Äôt forget his face, or the smell of that basement. But what haunts me most is the thought that he‚Äôs still out there, somewhere, ready to start again, and that this house was just one of many.",6,1736440678.0,nosleep,0,0.88,False

Our last development blog was in December, right before the team took their holiday break. Now we're back at work with some updates on our progress!

[Some new PFP options that have been designed by our Cult supporters](https://preview.redd.it/s57nmag1wzbe1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a5fc6045a4fc4eb50c26d23a7747dffa32839a6)

# General progress towards next update

Let's start off with how things are currently looking with the next update! Before we went for the holidays, things were already looking quite good on the new update, but there are still some known issues we need to fix before the engine rework update alongside gear sets is ready for release. We're all hoping that the rest of this process will be rather quick. The main issue we have to solve has to do with older Android devices, which are having issues, but hopefully we'll get that fixed soon.

From our testing, we're also confident that the step-counting issues when having the game in the background or having poor connection (especially on Android) have been finally fixed. We haven't had any issues in that regard anymore, even while trying all kinds of things to encounter that issue.

We're aiming for the update to be released this month. While it's been the longest time probably in the game's development history without new updates, the improvements we've been making here mean that we've finally paid off most of the technical debt that has accumulated throughout the development, and that most of our systems are now way better prepared for bigger scale and the future features for the game.

When this update is done and we've released some more QoL updates and features, we really want to finish our work on the new development tools for the game. Our content-delivery bottleneck currently is that we can't deliver new content while we've been working on this engine rework, and with the increasing complexity of the game content, our previous development tools are quite outdated. When we have the new development tools ready for use, releasing content updates to the game will no longer be bottlenecked by our other updates and should enable us to have a much more stable release schedule for bringing new content to the game.

# Anti-cheat improvements

While our main focus has been the engine rework and optimizing things, we've also started to scale most of our services to be more prepared for the eventual open beta release. One of the things that has seen serious improvement in the upcoming update is our anti-cheat systems. We'll stay tight-lipped about what kind of improvements have been made specifically, but the systems overall have been scaled significantly, making it easier for us to run more sophisticated and accurate anti-cheat, and the systems should easily scale to support even hundreds of thousands of players.

Our anti-cheat systems so far have already shown good promise, and this upgrade will definitely not be the last. We're committed to keep upgrading the anti-cheat systems continuously in order to make cheating in the game as hard as possible.

# WalkScape Wiki & Weblate improvements

[New items coming in the next content update](https://preview.redd.it/x79cx9q5wzbe1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb9047fad4c9d03e2585196ec12e6beaa6221fbc)

Our overall server infrastructure has now been scaled up significantly as well. With these changes, we've migrated the WalkScape Wiki from Miraheze-hosted service to our own server, which the Wiki Community team has access to. This has enabled them to start doing some changes which were previously impossible:

* WalkScape Wiki is now available as a PWA (Progressive Web App), so you can have it as its own web application on your phone.
* WalkScape Wiki has been prepared for the upcoming Gear Sets. If you check out Forest Foraging article, for instance, you now see a guide and Gear Loadouts. These gear loadouts are something you can copy and import as a gear set to WalkScape itself. If you feel like helping out creating guides & gear sets, please do!
* It should run significantly faster.

Weblate (or WalkScape Translate) has also been migrated to our own, beefier server. The previous server wasn't powerful enough to run it, but now it's blazing quick. If you'd like to help us translate the game to other languages, please join the Discord server and contact #bwuhbwuhbwuh and join the localization channels. We've also updated it to a newer version.

# Comments from Wiki Team‚Äôs Bonez565

Hello everyone, Bonez565 from the Wiki Team here. With a note on the new Community Guides and Gear Sets. If you'd like to help to create a guide or gear set, you can get started by going to the wiki and creating an account with a verified email address. There are currently two places that are open to community edits in what Mediawiki calls ""Namespaces"". Those are any pages that start with the prefix ""Guide:"" or ""Gear:"".

The Guide: namespace is, as the name suggests, the place for any kind of guide. All achievement pages have had their existing guides ported to a page at ""Guide:Acheivement\_Name"". If you visit an Achievement page, you'll see the contents of the Guide page with a button to edit it or a link to create a new page. The activity guide pages are set up to act as a directory of related guides and should use the sub-page structure.

https://preview.redd.it/g65h7z0ewzbe1.png?width=847&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e636c308a9e982f4e382af12f631b6ccd992320

For example, if you go to the ""Butterfly Catching"" page and want to make a guide to maximize wheat drops. You would click the link under the guide heading to go to the corresponding page at ""Guide:Butterfly Catching"" and follow the instructions in the preloaded comment to start the directory page. You can then create your new guide at the sub-page name you choose ""Guide:Butterfly Catching/Awesome Wheat Guide"" and there you can format add images or text as you wish. We intend to be relatively hands off with the structure of the guides themself and allow for the formatting that works best for you.

This works the same for the ""Gear:"" namespace. You can go to any activity to find a link to make a directory and use the template in the comment to nicely display your gear set. You can add text or links to corresponding Guides as well. In the future we'll have the ability to click a button and get a code that can be imported into the game for easy in-game use.

For both namespaces you can also make a freeform guide for a specific goal or section of the game. These can be created at ""Guide:Guide Name"" or ""Gear: Gear Set Name"" If you create a larger or more general guide please link it to the main [Community Guide Page](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Guide:Community_Guides) or [Community Gear Sets Page](https://wiki.walkscape.app/wiki/Gear:Community_Gear_Sets) so people can discover it from the sidebar links to those pages. These pages also host an automated set of all pages that have been created in their namespace. It should go without saying that names need to be appropriate or the guide will be rejected.

# The end of Wave 3.5

Wave 3.5 has ended on January 7th, and I want to thank everyone who supported and joined us on this wave! Thank you so much!

This wave, even though it happened during the holidays, was the smoothest one we've had so far. One of the main reasons why we have the wave system in place is that we usually get a lot of customer service emails during that, which takes a significant portion of our development time. This time, however, things were much smoother than before ‚Äî finally our integrations, especially with Patreon, are working more smoothly.

Buy Me a Coffee still has some issues, some of which aren't really things we can easily fix from our end. BMAC's API is one of the worst I've ever seen ‚Äî their API is rate-limited so that we can only fetch data on 10 supporters every five seconds. This is why it takes hours until your BMAC status updates.

We've also migrated our emails to our own email server two days ago. If you have sent us a customer support email but haven't heard back from us, please resend your email and tell us it wasn't delivered. During the migration, there were a few hours when mails didn't deliver.

Once again, thank you all for joining and being patient! With the engine & server upgrades, we‚Äôre able to support a lot more players after these changes go live - and we‚Äôre looking forward to having a lot more players join us on Wave 4!

# Until next time

That's all for today!

In the next development blog, we're hoping to have the update ready to go, or at least very close to that. In the next couple of weeks, we'll focus on just finishing up things to finally get this released, so we can start working on more exciting updates.

1hxgsoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Myfitnesspal/comments/1hxgsoz/strategy_for_reducing_evening_snacking_and/,"Strategy for reducing evening snacking, and factoring in exercise.","My goal for 2025 is to get my bodyfat down a bit, and I need some help. For context, I'm 6'3 about 200-202lbs with about 18-19% BF. I'm committing to lifting weights 3x weekly for 30-45 mins, and cycling daily(or at least 6x weekly - not a problem), and then switching out a cycling session or two with an indoor rowing session. I want to take the slow approach in reaching my goal, as I think that will give me the best chance of success - .5lbs lost per week. I should be adding some muscle too(changing up my macros a bit - more protein - at least 30% of my calories). My goal is to get to around 12-14% and maintain. So that will be a good 10-14lbs of fat to lose. I don't want to get a LOT bigger as I want to try to keep my w/kg ratio relatively close to where I'm at now.

So the main challenges I'm having: 

1)I can burn a LOT of calories cycling - anywhere between 750 for a recovery ride, to 2,000+ on a tough weekend workout. With that said, obviously I need to factor in some additional calories to complete these workouts. I can do the recovery rides with a bottle of water, adding in some Tailwind to keep energy levels up. For harder, longer workouts, I will add in some Gu gels too. How do you properly account for calories consumed in workouts? Also, if I'm cycling 6x a week, I would say only 1 of these efforts is VERY hard, at least 3 are more of a recovery ride(1hr'ish at light zone 2), and maybe 1-2 medium to hard efforts. Is this a too much?

2)Where I really struggle is evening snacking. I tend to wake up pretty early - usually around 4:15am, where I have a coffee and sometimes add an RXBar. Then I workout. I usually go to bed around 8:30-9pm. I tend to eat dinner around 5pm, but then I'm wanting to snack, and I consume extra calories. What are your strategies for avoiding this pitfall? I'm thinking that I should have more snacks leading up to this, like lunch around 11:30am, snack about 2-2:30pm, snack at 4pm, then dinner around 6 or 6:30pm with lots of water? Does this work for other folks? Other approaches?

1hxgsam,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoreyWayne/comments/1hxgsam/need_advices/,Need advices !,"I'm a 22-year-old man and I met a girl my age at the beginning of the year with whom I'm costiagiary at the hospital (I'm a medical student). I immediately saw that she liked me, but I wanted to take my time after being out of a year-and-a-half relationship. We're getting to know each other in a professional setting in the mornings, but I make her laugh, take coffee breaks with her, and so on. This thing went during 2 months during which I left my girlfriend of 1 year because I wasn't attached enough to her. I asked this girl to go to work with me at the library one Sunday and we spent the day together. 2 weeks later I proposed a date after our midterms, which she gladly accepted, and by chance I managed to kiss her the night before at a nightclub where we'd gone with my friends to celebrate the end of exams.

I'm a reserved kind of person when it comes to relationships and I try my best to keep calm and distance so I don't get too involved at first. The following week we continued to see each other at work placements and a mutual friend informed me that she ‚Äúreally liked me‚Äù without me asking for any information and that she (my date) wanted to know if I did too. I took that as an advantage knowing that uncertainty creates desire. I asked her out at the end of the second week on another date, which went very well again, and we kissed a third time at the end of it, she was laughing nervously and excitedly which was very sweet.

Finally, the following week I changed internships and went into oncology, which is pretty tough for a 4th year student. My little sister, whom I adore, also taught me that she was bulimic and that she scarified herself. I've kept this to myself all week, she doesn't want me to tell my parents. Monday and Tuesday go by, and I get a message from this girl asking me when I'm coming back to work with her at the library. I reply that I'll be back at the end of the week. The days I come are going extremely well, she wants to do all her breaks with me and I'm starting to see that she's becoming attached, maybe more than I thought and it's almost starting to make me develop budding emotions

She's already told me about her family and some of her stories, some of which are quite shocking (bullying at school, fighting with her little brother when she was a child), but which she tells me in a joking tone, as she's quite anxious which I take without any worries.

I receive a message from my sister on Thursday morning, explaining that my parents have spotted her cigarette pack and that she would like me to cover it up and tell the story to my date in jest. We laugh about it all day, and in the evening she sends me a message to find out how the evening went with my sister and my parents. Not really at ease, I decide to tell her that it's actually more serious than what I thought and that my sister is suffering from psychological problems. I explain the situation to her and ask her for advice as she is also a girl and a med student (should I tell my parents? has she ever had friends who did this?) She answers me kindly and the next day we talked about it, but I felt that it was a sensitive subject so I didn't force the issue and maintained a positiv attitude.

She continues to send me messages in the afternoon, I make her laugh again during the afternoon break and everything goes well. I didn't ask for any date for the third week as I had to work on some stuff and knowing that Saturday we have an evening together for the birthday of a common friend. I felt she's more distant than usual, but don't make it personal and don't really push for anything. Some of her close friends even come up to me and tease me that I'm going to end up in a relationship with the girl, but I laugh it off without making a fuss.

Sunday and Monday go by and I decide to ask this girl out again by message Tuesday for a third date at the end of the week.

I receive a long message in which she explains that she's no longer in the mood to continue and that she's sorry she's been so distant lately. I reply that I appreciate her honesty and that there are no problems, but ask if I might have frightened her or done something in particular that she wouldn't have liked? She replies that not at all, that she's just had a fright all on her own this weekend and that it's nothing to do with me. We haven't spoken in 6 weeks, but I know I'm going to see her again for our exams in 1 month.

She had never had a long or serious relationship, and some people had warned me about her ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù character, her best friend even advising me to ‚Äúnot give a damn about her‚Äù if I wanted to ‚Äúhave her‚Äù.¬†

Personally, my love affairs have always helped me to improve, even when they didn't lead to anything. I've taken up the gym, BJJ, philosophy and medicine, and my life has only gotten better. The problem here is that I don't know what lesson to draw from it. Was she the problem? Was it me? Was it both of us? What could I have done differently or should I avoid in a future relationship?

At first I thought she was attracted to another men, but a mutual friend recently told me that she felt I was more invested in her than she was in me. It's still hard for me to understand since I've always refrained from sending her messages except to make an appointment and I've always let her come to me plus the fact that I never talked about anything serious and just let myself go with the flow.

I don't want to chase and didn't sent anything after and I imagine that if she hasn't sent me anything it's because she simply doesn't want to talk to me anymore.

1hxgq4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ponderingwbu/comments/1hxgq4z/ever_wonder_about_the_environmental_impact_of/,Ever Wonder About the Environmental Impact of Coffee Appliances?,"This morning, I pondered about the impact that coffee appliances have on carbon foot printing, wasting products, and money. If outspoken environmentally conscientious people are concerned about the impact they have on their environment, why don't they just buy a moka pot or a French press? 

1. None of them require disposable filters.

2. They do not rely on electricity.

3. They are nowhere near as expensive as $100+ coffee machines.

4. They do not generate waste like disposable pods.

5. You choose how much you make and do not generate nearly as much excess coffee waste as you would with regular coffee pots. 

6. Moka pots and French presses do not require you to buy ""special"" cleaning products from the company nor company-specific parts. They also do not require you to buy coffee pods, which can cost a lot of money over time.

7. There is a significant difference in coffee flavor.

8. 0% chance of BPA in your coffee (unless you pour it in a plastic tumbler).

9. It is fun to watch moka pots brew coffee, and French presses look fancy on your kitchen shelf.

10. They are great if you are tired of the Americanized, hasty coffee brewing methods.

 I don't mean any disrespect or shame to anyone who uses coffee machines. I am just pondering. I am curious to hear your side!

I work at a large retail chain in Canada within the e-commerce department making $17.50 an hour. I actually just got my 10 cent raise in September after hitting my one year anniversary.

I am constantly burnt out, this job has given me an anxiety disorder and I have taken 4 sick days in the last 3 months due to this. I stay up crying all of Sunday night because I dread starting the cycle over again the next week.

I know *something* needs to change. While this company does have a corporate side to it and some may suggest moving up to store management, not only does it take years to get to a living wage (supervisors only make $20-22 hr and all upper management has had to work at the company for 8+ years before getting to a $70k salary) but I constantly hear management complain of how overworked they are, i‚Äôve had my supervisor come in crying on multiple occasions before due to stress. it‚Äôs disheartening and alarming.


My partner and I‚Äôs dream has always been to run our own cafe. He has a business and marketing background and I previously worked at a bakery/cafe, we also discussed him taking care of the financial aspect of the business and me running the day-to-day. We live in a large city so there‚Äôs no shortage of people who had these dreams as well, there‚Äôs likely a coffee shop on every street corner here - if not more.

Lately he has seen how overwhelmed i‚Äôve been with work and has been pushing me to quit and apply to one of our local cafes. A part of me is interested and I know experience in the industry is essential before we even consider our own business plan, but I still feel so hesitant in jumping to job that others wouldn‚Äôt consider stable or mature. 

I have a degree in history, graduated with honours and a 3.9 gpa, sometimes I feel as though I went through those studies for nothing but I also don‚Äôt regret the experience at all. 

 I guess i‚Äôm just looking for someone to rationalize this idea, or share their own similar experience and how it worked out in the end. ",1,1736440168.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share my game with you all again because I‚Äôve made some updates and would love to hear your feedback!

First, a quick recap:[ Donut Clicker](http://donutclicker.net) is, as the name suggests, a ""clicker"" game where you click on a donut to boost your production. The goal is to max out your production using upgrades, quests, and new features.

Now, onto the updates:

* I‚Äôve added an auto-buyer, so you won‚Äôt miss out on progress even if you‚Äôre on another tab.
* Bakers now have a recipe book! Bakers make donuts for workers in other buildings, and this gives you a nice production boost. There‚Äôs more to come here, but I‚Äôd love some early feedback!
* New upgrades are in‚Äîcursors get more powerful late-game.
* I‚Äôve reworked quests: They‚Äôve been nerfed a bit because reward multipliers were stacking too much.
* The UI has improved a lot on mobile! (But don‚Äôt open the baker panel on mobile yet‚Äîit‚Äôs bugged, and I just realized I need to fix it. üòÖ)
* I removed the cursors circling the donut to move away from the ‚Äúclone‚Äù look.

Prestige is now a big feature! When you prestige, the game resets, but you gain x2 production and start with 5 cursors every time‚Äîit‚Äôs worth it as you progress.

What‚Äôs coming next?

* Achievements are on the way!
* I‚Äôm planning to add a ‚Äúnews‚Äù section to make it feel like you‚Äôre living in a little donut town or city.
* In the Factory, you‚Äôll eventually produce robots to unlock new mechanics.
* The Portal will take you to a whole new world‚Ä¶ literally.

If you‚Äôd like to support the project, you can do so through [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/donutclickernet), and feel free to reach out there too! Also, don‚Äôt forget to join our r/donutClicker to share ideas and connect with the community!

I‚Äôm open to all feedback seriously, I consider every comment.

How Do I Navigate This? ,"My (20F) boyfriend (39M) and I have been together for a few months. Any hiccups have been pretty minor and the relationship has been going very well up until this point. 

For some backstory, I had a solo trip to Spain planned before we got together, and now the time has finally come and I‚Äôve left. He already didn‚Äôt love the idea of me traveling to another continent by myself, but I‚Äôd already booked and paid for everything so there wasn‚Äôt any cancelling the trip.

Anyway. While here, I had gone one evening to find ice cream. I stumbled across one of those places that serves coffee, ice cream and drinks and grabbed some gelato. There was only 1 person working in the shop, so he served as the ice cream scooper, bartending, barista, etc. This made him the only person I dealt with.

I stayed awhile, ate my ice cream and texted my boyfriend and my family. When I was getting ready to leave, I said goodbye to the bartender and then he asked if I didn‚Äôt want just one cocktail or something of that nature before I left. I asked how much cocktails were and he told me 8‚Ç¨, to which I proceeded to tell him probably not then and proceeded to get up. The bartender then told me he‚Äôd only charge me Happy Hour pricing which was 4 euros, so I agreed to that and stayed and got a cocktail and just did a bit more texting and small conversation with the bartender. After I finished, he asked if he could get me one more, this time on the house, and I said yes, thanked him and had a second drink. 

After that, I was feeling quite buzzed (I don‚Äôt drink much and have a low alcohol tolerance) and I left. On the metro back to my hostel, due to jet lag and the alcohol, I fell asleep. 

I woke up still on the train, slightly panicked and called my boyfriend because I was not in a clear state of mind and he was the first person I wanted to talk to. He talked with me briefly, and then had to hang up because he was at work, but told me to keep texting him until I got back and was in bed. I did, as well as sharing my ETA, and I went to bed feeling stupid and irresponsible.

The next afternoon, I was talking with my boyfriend after he had woken up (time difference) and he told me that he was beginning to feel himself put a wall up with me, and that he didn‚Äôt like that I (his words not mine) ‚Äúhad been flirting with the bartender for free drinks.‚Äù 

 I would also flirting cheating, so a big no-no in our relationship, and my boyfriend has been nothing but distant since. I hadn‚Äôt even thought about it in a flirtatious way when I said yes to the drink and the bartender never tried to make any other moves on me and just had a conversation about past travels each of us had had. 

I am beginning to think I should not have accepted the drink. I deeply care about this man and I don‚Äôt want to ruin this relationship over something like this. I have already fully explained my side to him, what else can I do to make sure this is as well-handled as possible?",0,1736439988.0,relationship_advice,7,0.33,False

1hxgcnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/JimmyJoyFood/comments/1hxgcnm/mildest_plenny_flavor/,Mildest Plenny Flavor?,"I'm a former Soylent drinker who is trying Plenny shakes for the first time. 

My first impressions are that Plenny is more satisfying for me than Soylent. I feel more full and have less gas. I thought I might have trouble with the texture, but it's fine: a bit gritty but not unpleasant. The original Plenny shake is a little thicker than I like, but that was solved with some extra water. 

My only issue with Plenny shakes is the flavor. My first order was chocolate and vanilla in original Plenny shakes, and chocolate in Plenny Active. I could not drink the vanilla at all. It has a weird, artificial flavor. I tried to cover it up by adding some brewed coffee instead of all water and a little cocoa powder, but I can't get past that artificial flavor. I didn't really like either chocolate either, although I found the Plenny Active chocolate to be slightly milder in flavor. I'm not sure I can get used to this chocolate flavor in either shake, though. I can drink it, but it's a chore and I don't enjoy it so far. I'll drink it for a few more days to see if my opinion changes.

Is there a more neutral, milder flavor of Plenny shakes? I'm afraid to try the banana because of the mixed opinions on the flavor: Some say it takes like real bananas, others say it tastes like banana candy (which I'm sure to hate.) 

Hoping I can find a Plenny flavor that works for me.

1hxgcaa,https://i.redd.it/w8zhihyktzbe1.jpeg,Do motion graphics work well for ads?,"
""First, Let‚Äôs Address the Elephant in the Ad Room""
Ads are everywhere. You can‚Äôt even scroll for five seconds without being hit by one. Some are so dull they make you wonder if they were created in a pre-coffee haze. But then, BAM! A motion graphic ad appears, and suddenly, you‚Äôre staring at your screen like it just revealed the meaning of life.


---

""Motion Graphics: The Eye-Candy That Pays Off""
Imagine you‚Äôre scrolling through social media. Regular ads are like the person who hands out flyers on a busy street‚Äîignored. But motion graphic ads? They‚Äôre the street performer juggling flaming swords while singing your favorite song. They grab attention, hold it, and make you ask, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù


---

""The Silent Ninja: Motion Graphics Do More Than Look Good""
Sure, they‚Äôre visually stunning, but motion graphics are also sneaky. They simplify complex ideas faster than your coworker skips meetings. Got a product that needs explaining? A snappy motion graphic can break it down in seconds, leaving viewers saying, ‚ÄúOhhh, I get it now!‚Äù


---

""ROI, AKA Really Outstanding Impressions""
Let‚Äôs talk money‚Äîbecause ads aren‚Äôt just about being pretty. Studies show motion graphic ads have higher conversion rates. They‚Äôre like that friend who not only gets you to RSVP for a party but convinces you to bring snacks. They work.


---

""But Wait, Isn‚Äôt It Expensive?""
Ah, the budget question. Motion graphics might seem like a big investment, but compare that to throwing money at ads no one clicks on. It‚Äôs like buying a fancy coffee machine. Sure, it costs more upfront, but think of the returns‚Äîless waste, better results, and coffee so good it converts you into a morning person.


---

""So, Should You Motion Your Way Into Ads?""
Absolutely. Motion graphics are the extroverts of the advertising world‚Äîcharming, vibrant, and impossible to ignore. If your brand isn‚Äôt using them yet, the real question is: what are you waiting for?


---

""Drop the Static; Go Dynamic!""
Next time you‚Äôre planning an ad, think about the audience scrolling away on their phones. Give them something worth stopping for‚Äîa motion graphic that turns their ‚Äúmeh‚Äù into ‚Äúwhoa!‚Äù
