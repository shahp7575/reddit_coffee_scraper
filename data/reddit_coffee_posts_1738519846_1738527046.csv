So, after bombing a midterm last year, I finally forced myself to figure out **how to actually retain information without panic-cramming.** Here’s what finally stuck:  

✅ **Active Recall > Rereading Notes** – I used to highlight textbooks and feel *productive*, but turns out, that’s one of the worst ways to study. Now I test myself first, then check if I was right. Even scribbling answers on scrap paper helps.  

✅ **Spaced Repetition Saves My Life** – I used to review everything the night before, then forget it all a week later. Now I space out my revision over time (even if it’s just 5-minute refreshers). The difference is insane.  

✅ **Actually Making My Own Flashcards** – Pre-made decks seem convenient, but I remember way more when I create my own cards (especially when I phrase things in a way my sleep-deprived brain understands).  

✅ **Tricking My Brain into Studying** – Forcing myself to start with *one* tiny task (like writing a single flashcard) somehow keeps me going. Also, pairing studying with coffee made my brain link *caffeine = study mode*, and now I feel weirdly guilty if I don’t revise after my first sip.  

Since switching things up, I’ve stopped cramming (mostly), and studying actually feels *less* painful. Still not perfect, but at least I don’t feel like I’m winging *every* exam anymore.  

What’s been your go-to study method? Or are you still in the last-minute panic stage (no judgment, been there)? ",1,1738526912.0,UniUK,0,1.0,False

He gets too frustrated during night wake ups and then can't go back to sleep after so I take the nights. I can't let him watch the newborn because if she starts crying too much or spits up he starts yelling. He's constantly getting mad at how messy the house is. 



I'm finding I'm getting resentful because he sleeps all night, and he takes the morning, but wakes up with the toddler and newborn at 8 or so, turns on the TV and drinks coffee and eases into the day, washes bottles, then I get up and feed the toddler and it's go-go-go the rest of the day. I can barely pump because if the newborn wakes up while I'm pumping it's 50/50 whether I'll hear him getting frustrated with her and I have to stop early and take her. If he goes out with friends and my toddler pulls down clothes from the dresser and I can't get them because I'm holding the newborn, I'm stressed out because I know he'll get frustrated with the mess (he did).

I'd love to hear from other Hashis about your experience.



Years ago I was finally diagnosed, after previous doctors had dismissed my R A G I N G symptoms for **years**. ""Oh, you're tired? Well, we all are."" - ""No you don't understand, I'm literally foggy, my mind is a fog"" - ""Go to bed earlier."" 😵‍💫 Cool, thanks though.

When I finally was diagnosed because one doctor would listen, I was told - like so many - ""Take Levothyroxine, and you will be fineee."" Yea. No. Didn't work. Besides, they had started me off on 50mcg, which was way too intense. Extreme heart palpitations, profuse sweat, 24/7 insomnia. I endured this for three weeks (""THIS IS NORMAL YOU NEED TO SIT THROUGH IT"" was my doctors response.......), then ditched it. No-one even told me I could split the damn tablet in half. 

I tried without it. Futile, obviously.   
I have a history of eating disorders and the **medical gaslighting** I had received over the years (""*If you're not losing weight you are not being quite honest with me here rn over your diet*"" - I hope these people get the karma they deserve), and still encounter (but respond to a lot more securely now so I get what I need because doctors are service providers to me. They take MY money and I expect treatment in return) defo contributed to that.

**My thyroid is tiny**. As is. I was just born with a really tiny one. We were fed garbage as kids which didn't help. My mother ignored food intolerances and allergies. ""They will go away""...... no, ma. They actually don't. She has Hashimotos and **Lipoedema** just like I do but they are not real to her. Yea. I decided to get well on my own and focus on myself and shut her tf down when she would dismiss or judge me or my reality. **No-one has the right to. No-one. We are the experts of our own bodies.** **No-one else can do that for us**. No-one can feel what we feel, no-one can know what's inside our heads. **We need to get to know ourselves so we can articulate what we a) feel and b) need**. I won't allow anyone to judge my feelings, or tell me that X is or isn't real. I will co-operate with CAPABLE medical personell but I make the ultimate call on what I eat, how much, what medication I take, how much, etc. When people say ""Gluten doesn't matter, you're not a celiac"" I know where I'm at. 

With my then original TPOs in the 1000s lab results, I went to a neuropractitioner and she was one of those mostly knowledgeable people.

""**Mucosa**. They are sprawled out in our bodies. In our mouth, in our nose, in our lungs, in our bladder, in our colon... You have **asthma** and re-occurring **UTIs** ? That's your **mucosae being inflamed**. Why? Because the mucosa in your colon is chronically inflamed. You are most likely **eating** things that your **microbiome** can't handle, our biggest **immune system**. It's in our gut. Your colon is most likely completely overwhelmed already from years of eating the wrong things, so the next in line mucosa get inflamed. In your case thats your bladder and bronchiae, other Hashimotos have chronic sinusitises. It varies but the same denominator is **food**.""

She had my blood 🩸 tested for **actual allergies and antibodies** \- celery, tomatoes, and zofran were the only ones that came back positive (and not even wildly but my reactions to those were still remarkable).  
She had my stool 💩 tested for inflammatory markers and sensitivities - bullseye. **Gluten**, **ovalbumin** (chicken eggs) couldn't even be measured anymore because my sensitivities were beyond and outside of maximum possible values. **L-Casein Type A1** was pretty bad too (dairy, depending on where we live), as was **soy**.

Guess who had been a **vegan** years prior for several years. 👉🤡👈

It wrecked my body so much. Veganism isn't for me, and it isn't for everybody. I wish it was but my body can't. I'm an athlete so I need a little extra of different amino acids, ie. protein, per day to function properly, and **I deserve to feel good about myself and energetic and happy and healthy and strong**. A total of 80grams of protein every day. I LOVE **hemp** because it's allergen free and **the only plant-based protein** that contains a wholesome amino acid profile. But ruling out eggs, and ruling out soy products like tofu, plus only being able to eat dairy and legumes in moderation, I need chicken once a week. It's that simple. And/or beef. I wish I could be vegan and obviously **I eat keto-paleo**, so **loads of veggies and whole, real foods**, but it's simply not possible.

I spoke to another very knowledgeable person who happens to be a gynecologist, endocrinologist and biologist and a Hashimotos patient herself, and she summed it up: ""**Lectins**. Be careful with lectins. They are a type of protein, and while our bodies have them naturally, sometimes they trigger a response and that's basically what happens with Hashimotos. **Gluten** is a **lectin**, so if you consume it your immune system goes ""Hang on a sec, you don't belong here, gtfo"" and in the crossfire your thyroid cells are being attacked because they have lectins attached to them aswell. Our immune systems don't know the difference. Many vegetables contain lectins. **Nightshades**, for example, **cruciferous** vegetables, and **legumes**. They are super mega healthy for us otherwise - hello polyphenols - but for now you will need to **cleanse and flush your entire digestion system** until your colon has caught a breath. It takes several weeks to get rid of all traces of gluten in your metabolism and body and your colon will not start repairing until then. After another 2-3 months you can ***slowly*** reintroduce the nightshades, the cruciferous vegetables, see how you go. See whether they trigger a response. Diarrhea will tell you. Stomach pains. Possibly skin reactions like pimples. Hair falling out, or becoming really dry. Moderation is key. I personally go entirely gluten free, you will probs have to go gluten and ovalbumin free. **No two Hashimoto patients are the same**. Gluten is a trigger for many, but I dislike ""ruling out"" entire food groups. If someone like you has multiple triggers and can't integrate a 110% gluten-free diet off the bat, I tell them to start somewhere else.""

  
I started right away. **I was sick of being sick**, so I kicked all of those things out of my diet and lived off bone-broth for a while. Chicken, spinach, apples, chia seeds, berries, almonds, rice... - yes, it was annoying at first. Defo not much left that I could eat. But I wanted to feel better and I did.

Over the course of **6-12 months** I did several gentle **flushes** with **psyllium** **husk** and **healing** **earth**. Sometimes **zeolith**. One right away, another one after 6 weeks or so. Then another one after 2-3 months. Loads of (celery free) vegetable broth, loads of unsweetened tea. I added **bitters** to detox my **liver,** too: **dandelion. Milk thistle. Artichokes**. I dropped about 20lbs within several months. My asthma went away. MY UTIS DISAPPEARED. My back and forth of diarrhea vs constipation normalized. 

**After the flushes** I refilled my colon microbiome with **prebiotics**. Fresh **sauerkraut** (not the stuff in cans, it's pasteurized which kills all the lactobacteria which we need to feed our microbiome with). **Inulin**, a non-soluble fiber. Those two are such superfoods to me. I also **supplemented** **probiotics** in the form of tablets, just to enrich and diversify my little microbiome garden down there, however my gut is mostly able to do that itself when fed with enough **prebiotics**. Or vice versa; **if you keep eating probiotics but not enough prebiotics** the beautiful bacteria you eat to go down there to grow will **starve** right away because they don't find enough food. 

  
After one whole year of doing this - I was finally able to eat mostly normal again :) that was a milestone. **I reintroduced** my beloved **cruciferous** and some **nightshade** vegetables (in moderation) almost without hiccups. **Legumes** came after. Then dairy. Again; in moderation.

**Ovalbumin, gluten and soy still trigger me**. So **I stay away from those.** 

  
I supplement as follows: 

Most mornings = **Whey Protein** shake 30grams + **collagen** 30grams + **Inulin** 10grams + Coffee + **lactose free A2 milk** \+ **600ml water**. Plus one tablet of **L-Tyrosin**, **Vitamin D3**, **K2**, **B-Vitamins**, **Omega 3** fishoil, **CQ10**. I had all of these tested and - shocker - was deficient in every single one. Sometimes I have a black tea plus gf organic oats instead but I do add my protein (sometimes hemp which I just loveeee), and fibre powders to it regardless, and take my tablets.

Midday = **clear** **whey** 30grams + 10grams **psyllium** **husk** \+ **1.5l water**. Sometimes with a light salad (sometimes with chicken). Depends on what I feel like. **1.5mg of** ***iodine*** (YES), which I have worked my way up to tolerate. This made my hair so shiny when it had been frizzy for years. I researched this a lot, and **I wholeheartedly disagree that all Hashis should stay off iodine completely**. I was so deficient, the lab results showed it. I had been living a high-iodine diet years back (before I knew about my diagnosis), and I had never felt better in my life. **It's different for everyone** but I personally need iodine, and a fair amount of it, as it seems. My **iodine deficiency** **goiter** disappeared. My nodules disappeared. **200mg of selenium**. **Some T4, some T3.**

Afternoon or evening = whatever healthy dinner. Chicken or tuna salad, quinoa - I have a **banana** or some sweet potatoes if I work out (which I do a lot) but overall I eat **paleoketo** which I feel extremely good with. **Loads** of **Vitamin C** at night, plus **iron** tablets. My **ferritin** feels good when it sits at **150**. I sometimes get **infusions** with my naturopractitioner because they are so much faster than the stupid tablets. Whatever the ferritin recommendation is - 70 ?! - I walk around like a zombie on that, my hair falls out. I need more. I alternate iron with **zinc**. Some **L-Tryptophan or 5htp an hour before bed,** which upped my serotonin and melatonin. **I sleep sound like a baby and I wake up rested.** 

  
**My PMS has become so much better,** when I never thought. It was so depressing. The PMS girlies know. It's hell. Thanks to dismissive gynecologists who told me that it's normal and I need to put up with it - I did. It isn't, and I don't any longer. You're just lazy and/or uninformed. The same gyn told me that at 1.7 my TSH is hyperthyroidism. Yea. Bye. 

**My TSH feels good when it sits around 0.4-0.7.** 

**I am not on hormonal birth control, and never will be.** 

I recently had my reproductive hormones tested and at 35 I am completely **fertile**. My AMH is high so still enough eggs left (my family is literally generations of ""geriatric birthers"", ie. past 30 and 35 years of age). **Progesterone** **remains low-ish** which is typical for female Hashis because **cortisol** is notoriously high (adrenal gland fatigue), and cortisol is a progrestone robber. But it's much better and **I feel Okay**. **That's the biggest indicator**. **So many on here ask ""Are my labs normal or within range"" and there is no such thing as normal. You feel how you feel.** Some need a higher TSH, some need a higher fT3. Some can be subclinical. **No two Hashis patients are the same.**

I will have my **insulin** and **glucose** levels tested soon. Very curious - and also angsty af - as to what those will reveal. I am thinking of trying out **semaglutides** (Ozempic, Wegovy, etc.) soon because I have another 15lbs of body fat to drop that won't budge unless I starve myself (again), so that's off the table. I know I am doing everything I can for my health, and I have come far. I wouldn't be surprised if I was prediabetic simply for Hashi being the progredient disease that it is. I know I reversed my insulin-resistance which again is notorious for Hashis because, well. Our entire metabolism slows down. So we will see.

Just wondering if someone ran into this before. I used the [Tdarr install script from here](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/scripts?id=tdarr) to install Tdarr nodes running as containers on my hosts.

Now, whenever I start these containers they initially register. However, eventually they just max out their RAM and SWAP and then... die?

https://preview.redd.it/wuxt1i2t6sge1.png?width=3170&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf68d7c8ca437352dba1b50f4455b157777d9a1e

Once it's maxed out, I can't access any logs any more so I can't even have a look what the nodes are doing when they're doing it...

For details on my setup, please read this:  
>!I'm running four identical.hardware nodes joined into a single cluster. All nodes have the same 32GB of RAM and use NFS storage to access my NASs. On the first HW node, there's a Tdarr-server-container (that only runs the server side and no internal node). On all HW nodes, there's a Tdarr-node-container with the same hardware specs as this one. The Tdarr nodes, as well as the single server node, have three mount points (NAS1, NAS2 and an SSD Cache) all mounted via ""pct set"". This is also the reason why the containers run as privileged so they have access to the NFS shares. (Quick side note: I **do not** appreciate any advice on this setup if it isn't the direct cause of the containers RAM and SWAP filling up - Which I highly doubt it would be because the Tdarr-server-container doesn't exhibit this behaviour and it has the same mount points.)!<

I have played “superpower 2” so I have a “notion” on how the economy works (kind of? 😅)However, I’m having some issues in certain topics/metrics: 

Poverty levels: 

I’ve taken several measures to decrease it: short term solution:  raise minimum wage, increase allowances, solidarity package, and help with tax break/credit for new home owner. At the same time, I reduced “basic products/services” taxes for the population: agriculture (coffee,fruit,cereal, meat etc..) essential item( clothing, appliances etc..) and basic services (energy, oil, gas etc..). From 8% to 15% reduced taxes. 

For the long run I’ve been heavily subsidizing my industry, agriculture and energy sector (to the max). 

It does lower my poverty, but after a month or two goes back to the same number ( 37% to 29% then back to 37%). What am I doing wrong? Am I overlooking something? 

The same happened with gdp per capita, in the sense of my GDP is growing tremendously (8%-10% growth) but it’s barely shows in the GDP per capita, hence = low purchasing power for the nation. 

Could you guys give me some tips? I’ll appreciate some guidance.

1ig63yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1ig63yv/how_do_i_expedite_the_dating_process/,How do I expedite the dating process?,"I am 21 years old with my bachelors degree and have been working for the past year. I’ve lived with my parents, in doing so saved over $100k towards a house.

I’m attractive enough, I have good enough social skills, dress nice, make enough money, am confident enough, and have been on dates. I never really did a lot of social events from 18-21 though because I was focused on work or college. I don’t wear flashy clothes or drive a fancy car because I’m committed to saving for a house. 

I’m forward and am pretty blunt - once I meet a woman and have a conversation, I will drop the question - “I feel like we have a lot of shared values, I’d like to take out for coffee, are you free (night of week)? Depending on her answer I can tell her interest as the ball is now in her court and let it go if she fails to confirm plans. 

I’m not afraid of my reputation if it doesn’t work out - I choose not to fear because of my identity in Christ. I’ve tried dating apps - but it’s mostly fat women, liberal women, uneducated women or women with trashy tattoos and piercings. It really sucks as that’s not my type. 

I’ve been trying to meet women at church and church events, and Christian run clubs. Meeting through mutual friends are pretty dry and bars and apps have never been good. Work is busy, and I’m pulling 50-60 hour weeks in busy seasons so I don’t really have a social life on weeknights. 

I think it takes time - it’s not like Amazon Prime 2 day delivery. If I do 1-3 church events weekly at a young church and make a friend group through that I think I’ll likely be successful. As long as I am doing Gods will (no porn, no swearing, no getting drunk with my friends) and being forward I should be fine. I’m also praying and reading my Bible on a regular basis which has had a good effect on my mental health. 

Is my strategy good enough or do I need to try something different?",1,1738526441.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

To make these keto snickerdoodle cookies, all you need to do is mix up your ingredients, roll the cookies into balls and dip in the cinnamon and sweetener mixture, then flatten slightly and bake for 15 minutes.  Mission accomplished! ?Toasty, cinnamon-y, cookie perfection.  Believe it.  I tried freezing these low carb snickerdoodles to see how they would hold up and they were just as good if not better than before I'd frozen them. They keep perfectly at room temperature in a sealed container for up to four days (that's how long ours  inside texture of the cookies got a little chewier every day, while the outside stayed toasty and crisp - it was awesome! I implore you to make these keto snickerdoodle cookies ASAP, and then report back as to what you thought of them!

The meetups are mostly talking about life and work shit and the occasional reminiscing. I'm reluctant to give them up because, gloomily enough, Mandy and I are the only two people from our original friend group that are either still living or talking to eachother.

Have you ever wondered how to sharpen your critical thinking skills in a world where AI is transforming everything from your favorite apps to how you make your morning coffee? As we embrace the age of AI, the importance of critical thinking is skyrocketing. Let's dive into some practical and fun ways to enhance those brain muscles! 🧠🚀

### What is Critical Thinking Anyway? 🤔

Critical thinking is like a mental Swiss army knife—it involves analyzing facts, evaluating arguments, and separating the signal from the noise. But how does it fit into our AI-driven world? Well, with AI making some decisions for us, it's vital to keep questioning, evaluating, and validating those choices.

### Why is Critical Thinking Essential in the AI Era? 🌐

1. **Navigating Information Overload**: With AI generating and processing more data than ever, critical thinking helps us sift through and find what's really meaningful.

2. **Understanding AI Decisions**: Algorithms can make complex decisions, but you're the one who needs to understand them to ensure they align with human values.

3. **Creative Solutions**: It's all about thinking divergently. While AI can handle the nuts and bolts, humans excel in creativity and innovation.

### Developing Critical Thinking Skills 📚

1. **Ask Questions**: Make curiosity your best friend. Always dig deeper into the ""why"" and ""how"" of AI processes. 

2. **Embrace Skepticism**: Not everything that shines is gold—apply skepticism to AI results and recommendations to understand their strengths and limitations.

3. **Engage with Diverse Perspectives**: Understanding different viewpoints on AI applications opens your mind to new ideas and insights.

4. **Play the Devil's Advocate**: Challenge AI decisions by arguing against them, which can reveal hidden biases or areas for improvement.

### Real-Life Practice 🛠️

Try an app that encourages debate or false positive reviews, and analyze the case studies. This can be a fun way to hone your skills while learning about the real-world impact of AI!

### Keep the Conversation Going! 🗣️

How have you seen AI impact your critical thinking skills? Got any examples or stories where you’ve used critical thinking to overcome an AI-driven challenge? Share them in the comments!

And if you're curious about more ways to develop critical thinking or want to delve deeper into AI's fascinating world, check this [link](https://beacons.ai/aixpertus) for resources and community discussions. Let's grow those skills together!

Stay curious and critical, AIxperts! 🔍✨

\- **Illbury & Goose** (illburyandgoose.com) makes clothing in London  
\- **Mike's Hard Lemonade** distilled at Labatt in London  
\- **Balzac coffee** roasted in Stratford and sold in grocery stores

For background, My sister(f23) and I(f18) never really got along as children. She always wanted things her and would d@mn near force you to follow. Now that I am grown, I expect decent respect as a human being.

Ever since my family realized that I am engaging with boys in anyway they’ve been overly invasive of my status or pregnancy. I try to do the right thing to prove that I am focused by working and staying on top of school (college) but that doesn’t stop my sister or my mom from intruding into my personal life.

A couple weeks ago, I was craving bread and coffee. This was a common snack for me as a kid and my mom was otp with my sister then she screamed “You’ve never ate that, you’re pregnant!” I’m ngl that kinda annoyed me because how do u know what I ate as a kid when u were too consumed with yourself?? 

Fast forward, two days ago, she threw a slumber party for a friend. I came and brung along my best friend we drunk, smoke, and at food then played a truth or drink game. I’ve always felt like wussing was lame when playing a game so I answered most of the truths of the card. But some cards I instead chose to drink. 

At one point of the night my sister overfills my shot causing it to spill on me. I was about 6 shot and was pretty so I no longer wanted to consume. So I’m taking sips if I chose to skip a card then all of a sudden my sister accused me of hiding something when I jokingly said “jr something” because she kept pressing me to drink. Then asked “what u gon do if I am, 💀 the baby” IM NOT BTW but she told me yes then the next day told my mom I wasn’t drinking any shot and was fake taking shots when she practically forced them down my throat so I went off on her for lying. Im tired of them accusing me of this

1ig5mtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/fwblosangeles/comments/1ig5mtk/sea_mountain_inn_friend/,Sea Mountain Inn Friend,"I’m looking for a woman to join me once or twice a month at Sea Mountain Inn, and maybe a coffee or lunch now and then.

About me: 51 wm, 5’ 11” with wavy brown hair, some silver popping through. Casual business professional, leaning more arts and culture than sports. I’m thick but not fat and enjoy being physically active. 

I have a membership at Sea Mountain with my partner, but like to go a little more often than she does. 

What I’m looking for:
I’m looking for a woman friend to hang with now and then. Specifically I’m looking for someone to join me at Sea Mountain Inn Lifestyle resort. I like the vibe there, and typically enjoy watching others and being in the water. I’m a voyeur, and occasional exhibitionist. 

If you’ve been intrigued by going to a club like that and want a wingman, someone to watch or just feel more comfortable going with someone in general, we could be a match. If this is something discreet for you, that’s cool. Just let me know. The resort is fantastic about their discretion policy. 

If you’ve read this far and your curiosity is piqued, drop me a dm. For me it’s more about the friendship and camaraderie in adventure than a specific age or body type. Some of the sexiest women I’ve met at the resort don’t fit the societal norms. ",1,1738525246.0,fwblosangeles,0,1.0,False

I purchased them as a gift a while ago for a friend who was getting a Flair58, but they decided to go in another direction. The pictured items are my own versions, the boxes behind are the identical factory sealed items.

I would like to sell them as a package for $200 local to 92102 in San Diego or $210 shipped. The scale goes for $130 and Tamper for $90 on sale with shipping from China.

A few months ago something changed and now I love everything about it and I've been going super hard. It's become my favorite hobby. I don't always nail it though, in fact I fuck it up often. I try to keep as many variables consistent as possible, but I'm still tweaking things to try and get the best cup. Lately I feel like I've been missing something and my pour overs weren't coming out vibrant and full of flavor. This morning I tried Dak Milky Cake and it was amazing. It was creamy, subtly sweet, cardamom, cakey, etc. Delicious. I'm just happy it feels like I'm getting better. ",2,1738525137.0,coffeerotation,1,1.0,False

1ig5jv9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ig5jv9,🚨 Birdie's Heat Cycle: Mega Post 🚨,"⏰️ This post, images, and links will take time to review and process.

⚠️ Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer. I am not affiliated with petMD, the City of Joplin or State of Missouri Government.  Due to Joe & Kylea choosing to frequently dox themselves on social media, I feel comfortable sharing local and state resources with you.

 *This post is for informational purposes only.*

⏸️ One of the Rules of Reddit is to avoid discussing going ""in real life.""  The definition of this term can be found at the top of the Sub-Reddit.

Let's dig into this debacle...or egregious behavior?  Everyone is entitled to make an informed decision. Here we go...

Image #1 (photo credit petMD) lists FAQ's for a dog's heat cycle.  Here is the 📎 for more information: 
https://www.petmd.com/dog/general-health/dog-in-heat

Images 2-7 ⚠️ These are screenshots from content originally posted on a monetized (paid) public page on a social media platform.

Now that you know about the symptoms a dog experiences while in heat, would you dress up your dog and parade her in public?  

Image 8 is Sec. 18-42 ""Confinement of female dogs in heat"" is from the Joplin, MO Animal Control Code.  Here is the 📎 to the code:
https://library.municode.com/mo/joplin/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_CH18AN_ARTIIDO_DIV1GE_S18-42COFEDOHE

In my opinion, this code states that a female dog in heat is to be confined.  It seems to me that Birdie was purposefully taken into public on multiple occasions. 😒 (I only posted 2 examples to prove my point.)

Images 9-10 are from the Missouri Food Code for the Food Establishments of the State of Missouri: 6-501.115 Prohibiting Animals (pages 90-91 of the 113 page document)
Here is the 📎 
https://health.mo.gov/safety/foodsafety/pdf/missourifoodcode.pdf

It seems that Birdie was not permitted inside the coffee shop (image 5) per Missouri State Food Code. 🤔 I do not know if a manager and/or the owner were present during Kylea's visit.

Kylea & Joe, as pet owners, are responsible to follow all codes/ordinances/laws.  Was Kylea acting in the best interest of Birdie during her heat cycle?  Was Birdie's safety and comfort prioritized?

1ig5htr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1ig5htr/are_people_using_dating_sites_really_this_dense/,Are people using dating sites really this dense?,"I've been reading the comments for a few days and thought I should post an FYI about all dating sites. Firstly, everyone is fake. Secondly, you are wasting your time talking to anyone because they are fake. Thirdly, that's why you are all being ghosted and mutual matches expiring. Lastly, stay away from anyone listing their Insta, Snap etc. The rule of thumb is this. Assume everyone is fake. If you get a mutual match, it isn't real. If it is and they don't meet within 24 hours, they never will meet. You go from matching to meeting within a day. You don't go from matching to facetime or anything else. That will ALWAYS be a waste of time knowing that they are fake. Everyone needs to eat dinner, so everyone has time to meet for a quick dinner after work or for a coffee. ""Everyone"" and ""all"" means 99.99999% of online users, especially women. I am aware that .000001% might be real.",0,1738524897.0,Bumble,7,0.27,False

1ig5fy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jewelers/comments/1ig5fy1/how_to_network_from_zero_within_the_jewelry_world/,How to network from zero within the jewelry world?,"Hi everyone, 

I'd like to lean on the expertise and knowledge of the nice folks here. My question is: how does someone without any background in jewelry, who is entertaining the idea of eventually transitioning into the business of selling jewelry, start to gain knowledge and network in the space? Specifically in regards to the sales of jewelry rather than making. I apologize in advance if anything I'm asking/saying sounds naive. I may just be a bit overzealous with my head in the clouds thinking of a future in jewelry sales. 

**For background:** 

I have a full time job that serves me well but I'm not the kind of person who likes to put all my eggs in one basket. My dad was a bench jeweler for nearly 30 years and his cousins (and their kids) and uncles have owned shops. I have a cousin on my mom's side who has built a very successful jewelry resale business (mainly name brands) and another cousin who, after apprenticing with aforementioned cousin for many years, went on to open his own successful resale business. I also spent a few months working with the first cousin mentioned before I realized I was going nowhere and he's difficult to work with (as other family members have noted). So I left and said to myself forget it. 

After some time had passed, I realized that I wanted to be more productive with my free time, I ventured to try to emulate my cousin's business myself. Before anyone gets irked, I knew I wasn't going to do anything remarkable and that it would take many years to even get to a fraction of his success, **if at all**. Over the past year, I was able to find pieces of jewelry online for relatively cheap and have been able to successfully ""flip"" about 10 pieces (between ebay and FB marketplace). Given how new I am to all of this, I considered it a success as I made a little bit of fun money. 

I realized how much fun I had learning about jewelry as I looked for pieces to buy and also how much fun I had learning how to sell (something I never thought I'd enjoy). But I also know I just can't keep spending hours behind my phone and computer every week aimlessly looking for undervalued pieces. 

I'd like to know how I can best get my feet wet in terms of how to further my own knowledge (I plan on taking the GIA Graduate Diamonds Course. Unfortunately, I can't commit to anything full time given my current job), how to find people to network with who'd be eager to share their knowledge and experiences (**not asking for handouts for sourcing or any handouts really**),  and even more ideally would be to talk with any industry professionals who left a well-paying career to transition into the business of jewelry and see how their experience was like. 

My dad isn't very well-connected and has been retired for years now. I have my cousins but we're not particularly close and communication is challenging. It's really just a relationship of respect, cordiality, and being there for each other if we really need it. I won't get much from them unless I can commit to working for them long-term which really isn't an option at this point.

Things I have considered are (and maybe I'm entirely barking up the wrong trees):  

\- doing broad searches for jewelers on LinkedIn and doing coffee chats but I'm not sure how helpful LinkedIn is in the world of jewelry compared to other fields.

\- buying enough jewelry from suppliers and then try to get into some smaller jewelry trade shows

1ig5evp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoppyPlaytime/comments/1ig5evp/my_favorite_part_of_poppy_playtime_lore_is_the/,My favorite part of Poppy Playtime lore is the hour of joy. I thought how could I make the hour of joy more chaotic. What if the Resonance cascade in half-life opened multiple portals to playtime co during the hour of joy instead of planet Xen. Here's a rough draft of chapter 1 of my Fanfic idea,"*So basically, I thought what if I made the hour of joy and the Black Mesa incident more chaotic and confusing by having the Resonance Cascade that occurs in half-life 1 open multiple portals into Playtime Co instead of Xen. What happens when a sketchy, yet surprisingly chill government organization runs into traumatized orphans who were turned into toys, traumatized orphans who became bloodthirsty toys, employees of an unethical toy company who have no idea what's going on, and employees of the same unethical toy company who know what's going on up the point when the portals begin to show up. Well, nothing good happens. Gordon Freeman being the mad lad he is ends up in   Playtime Co and has to battle his way through bloodthirsty toys, uncover the unethical secrets of playtime co, and also kick the protypes ass. The Black Mesa on their part have to deal with both good and bad toys coming through these portals to escape the carnage in playtime co or out of curiosity. Black Mesa gets swamped by killer toys and friendly ones and the HECU is called in to clean up the mess and figure out what the fuck is happening at Black Mesa. The HECU is not going around killing the scientist luckily. Yah that's basically the gist of this entire Fanfic I've planned out to make a much more chaotic hour of joy. This is just a rough draft of Chapter one and I want to know what you all think about this idea.*



 **Black Mesa/ 2001/ May 16th/ Gordon Freemans POV**

 

*Crap I'm late I'm God damn late* I think to myself as I dash across the halls of Black Mesa towards the Anti-Mass Spectrometer. As I dash by, I hear some of my coworkers say their hellos to me as I dash past them. I'm 5 minutes late god dammit. I open the door to one of the staff locker rooms before running inside. The sliver lockers line up the walls neatly and the floors have just been recently clean. I nearly slip and fall as I run through the locker rooms. 

 

I finally spot what I was looking for, my Hazardous Environment suit. I quickly and hastily put it on. I checked my watch for one last time. Thats 10 minutes late already. I quickly grab any necessities I need from my locker before letting out a sigh and dashing out of the locker room. I run towards observation bay of the Anti-Mass Spectrometer. In my hast I nearly ended up turning the wrong way in the maze that is Black Mesa. If only this place wasn't such a maze. I am pretty sure I would have easily made it over to the observation bay far quicker hadn't it been for the design of this place.

 

I hear on the loudspeakers ""Activating high atmospheric contaminant sensors."" 

 

After a brief interaction with a guard who opens one of the doors for me, I make my way to one of the facilities elevators which takes me downwards towards my destination. The elevator descends at a snail's pace much to my utter annoyance. *Couldn't this thing go any faster?* I mumble to myself. 

 

The elevator, after a grueling slow decent, finally opens up and allows me to dash through Black Mesa's lower levels. I dash past several fellow scientists and researchers who greet me as I run towards the observation bay. I finally manage to make it the glass sliding doors opening as I'm greeted by several familiar faces. 

 

""Ah Gordon here you are. We just brought the sample down to the test chamber. We boosted the Anti Mass Spectrometer to 105% but we need the extra revenue."" DR Isaac Kleiner says.

 

""Got that sorry for running late."" I respond. 

 

""Also are you sure boosting it to 105% is safe? We've always kept the Spectrometer at 90%"" I continue.

 

""Wallace Breen wants results and the chance of anything negative happening is unlikely, so don't worry Dr Freeman."" Isaac tells me as he lets out a chuckle.

 

""Yes, yes, that's all good but they’re waiting for you in the test chamber Gordon so best you hurry.""  DR Rosenberg tells me slightly impatient, causing me to nod and follow him as he opens the door in front of me allowing me access to the room with the Spectrometer. I make my way through another hallway and take another elevator downwards towards the Spectrometer. 

 

I finally make way after some more running towards the blast door. Behind this door is the Anti-Mass Spectrometer. A device if you want to call it that that might as well be the pride of Black Mesa. I'm greeted by 2 scientists in front of the blast door.

 

""I'm afraid we will be deviating a bit in our standard analysis procedures today, Gordon.""  One of them says.

 

""Why is that?"" I say, asking the million-dollar question.

 

""Well don't worry about it, Dr Freeman. This is a rare opportunity for this facility. The sample you'll be putting in today is the purest sample we've ever seen."" The other scientist says semi answering my question. 

 

""Just follow standard insertion procedures and you'll be fine."" The other scientist then chirps.

 

""I don't know how you can say that...However I will admit the possibility of a resonance Cascade scenario is unlikely."" The scientist next to the one that spoke to me says. His face is a visible frown as he addresses his partner. Great so there is a small chance a rip in time and space occurs just great. I think sarcastically.

 

""Gordon doesn't need to hear all this. He is a highly trained professional and he's got this. We have assured the administrator that nothing and I mean nothing will go wrong. You hear me"" The other scientist snaps back at his partner.

 

""\*Sigh\* your right. Gordon, we have complete faith in you. Do what you do best champ."" The scientist partner then says. There is still some uncertainty in his eyes as he says this to me, but it helps calm me down a bit. I've done this before and every time things have gone well. It will probably just be another normal day.

 

One of the two then opens the blast door for me as I walk through. 

 

Dirty orange colors of the room around the Spectrometer are the first thing that I see before I see the imposing machine itself. The Spectrometer stands out in all its glory as it will always do. As I walk around the room admiring the machine for like the 20th time the loudspeakers blare.

 

""Testing, Uh, testing. Everything seems to be in order."" 

 

I give a thumbs up in the direction of the Cams that allow the scientist to see what is going on down in this room. Just a little thing to confirm that everything is indeed ok.

 

""Alright Gordon, your suit should keep you comfortable through this. The specimen will be delivered to you shortly so just Uhh relax for a bit."" The loudspeakers then blare again as one of the scientists in the observation room talks through them. I think it was Kleiner, but I can't be too sure as my helmet muffles the sound a bit. 

 

""Would you be as kind as to climb up the ladder and start the rotors?"" The loudspeaker blares again. I give another thumbs up and walk my way to the ladder. I begin to hastily climb up it. 

 

""Thank you. Now we can bring the Anti Mass Spectrometer to 80% until the carrier arrives."" 

 

I punch a couple things in the computer in the railings I'm on causing the Anti Mass Spectrometer rotors to whirr to life. Now I just have to sit up here and wait. Shouldn't be too boring. After just a minute the loudspeaker blares once more.

 

""Stage 1 ammeters coming to life in 3, 2, 1."" 

 

The Spectrometer whirrs to life as it shoots a electric beam downwards. Everything seems to be going well. 

 

""I'm seeing predictable phase arrays. Nothing out of the ordinary."" The loudspeaker blares.

 

I begin to climb my way down through the ladder. The specimen should be arriving anytime now.   

 

""Stage 2 emitters activating now.""

 

""We cannot predict how long the system can operate at this level or how long the reading will take, so work as quickly as you can, Dr Freeman."" The loudspeaker continues to blare. I shoot another thumbs up as I get to work. 

 

""Uh, it's probably not a problem but we have a small discrepancy, uh its well it’s in acceptable bounds again continue Dr Freeman.""  

 

Ok that sounded a bit concerning but it seems everything went back to normal; I think. 

 

""The sample is ready Gordon."" 

 

Oh finally. 

 

I make my way over to the carrier as it comes up in the delivery system. The specimen in question is a large yellow crystal. Well, I would have described it as Pee colored. I push the carrier with the crystal forward towards the Spectrometer. Moment of truth. I push it close to it where then I begin to hear several loud bangs as the spectrometer becomes slightly instable. Ok it is just a bit unstable nothing to worry about. I try to say as I back away. The loud banging continues as the spectrometer begins to shoot out cracks of electricity. Ok things aren't going, ok I need to get out of here.

 

""Attempting shut down. Shut down shut down!"" I hear the panicked voices over the loudspeaker. 

 

""It's not shutting down!""

 

""It's not shutting down AGGGHHH!""

 

Green bolts of electricity shoot out in every direction as I hastily dodge it, trying not to get myself fried. I know my suit should keep me protected but I'm still not taking the risk of being hit by one of those things. Several Green things (Clouds?) appear and disappear around the room as the Spectrometer goes absolutely haywire. My vision then goes black as I feel myself get hit by something.

 

 

 

**Playtime Co/ 1995/ August 8th/ Prison/ Just 2 hours before the hour of joy/ Head of Playtime Co's security in the** **Factory POV**

 

The door opened as I turned my head over to the left. *Ah he's here* I think to myself as I then look back down at the containment cell of experiment 1006. The darkness of the room prevents me from getting a closer look at the beast contained within those dark walls and reinforced doors. The smell of blood was still evident from the last escape attempt from the creature. Just 1 week ago it tried to bolt for it. The special response teams managed to bring the little bitch back to where he belonged. It got me thinking. This last attempt was less of it trying to escape and more of it just wanted to kill some of us. It makes sense really. We've drained its hope of escape, so it's decided to make life as painful for us as possible as the science guys to their thing on it. 

I know some things happen for the sake of research. Well, I mean sometimes they just straight up torture the fucker. I don't need to see it to know. For a bit it made these blood curdling sounds. After a couple of years though it stopped and was silent for the rest of the sessions. I've never been a part of these sessions. I mean I feel as it is better to plaster the fucker with bullets. Kill it and get it over with. The bigwigs, however, say there is something special about it. I used to believe that. Well for a bit. After its continued escape attempts and the killing of my security personnel the thing’s become more of a liability in my eyes. Playtime Co thinks they can throw more bodies, and it will slow it. Roll back on training the security guys. Just teach them the basics.

Bullshit.

 

Basics aren't going to help them in dealing with 10-foot-tall freaks of nature. Creatures that desire to rip you apart. Their nice around the kids sure. Some of the tamer ones are nicer around the adults as well but most of the lot will resist attempts to ""Domesticate"" them.

 

I turn over as I'm ripped out of my internal thoughts. I got a job to do after all. 

 

""Hello sir."" I say as the big man himself walks over to me. The man wears the typical classy suit and tie all bigwig's wear. He has the grey suit, a black tie, and he is wearing gloves to keep any nasty substances from touching his hands. 

 

""Theirs coffee their if you want some."" I said roughly as I pointed to the coffee brewer. 

 

""I'm fine Nathanal Green."" He says addressing me by my full name. The man in front of me is Lieth Peirre head of Playtime Co. The only man possibly more dangerous than the toys themselves. His sharp calculates eyes look me over for a bit before he sighs and looks over at the protypes cell or containment chamber if you want a fancier word. 

 

""You want a smoke?"" I ask as I pull out my packet of cigarettes. 

 

""Uh no thanks I'm not a smoker and I'm pretty sure you should know this, Green."" He said a bit annoyed.

 

""Ah sorry forgot boss. Well, suit yourself."" I say as I take a cigarette and light it.

 

""Excuse me what are you doing?"" Pierre asks.

 

""You really going to make me go outside? All the other rooms in this place are fucking freezing and I'd have to go to the upper levels to get some fucking warmth."" I say mildly annoyed.  

 

""Green, I can tell by the smell of this room Dr Harvey might have let you smoke when he was still in charge of handling Experiment 1006, but I can assure you I won't allow such luxury. I don't want the observation room smelling foul."" Pierre said, eying me. Ah fuck it.

 

""Whatever you say boss."" I say hiding my annoyance as I unlight the cigarette before tossing it in a nearby trash can. 

 

""Now that your smoking is sorted out catch me up on the recent testing of 1006."" My boss said sighing as he looked back down at 1006 containment chamber.

 

""We didn't get as many results after Dr H you know.... Since Harvey had been dropped out of the project, we haven't been able to get the little fucker to speak at all. Live human testing and sending test subjects into their had expected results...."" I say. I can't fucking believe I'm doing the bullshit the science guys are supposed to do.

 

""Could you refer to Dr Harvey Sawyer by his actual name instead of Dr H?"" the boss man asks me.

 

""Sure, I guess. He actually liked it when I referred to him just as Dr H."" I answer. 

 

""Interesting to note."" 

 

""Could you get some of the security to bring in both a toy and Human subject. I want to see what happens when we have a toy and human in the same room as 1006. I doubt it will yield much."" Pierre said. I could easily tell the boss man just wanted to see more of 1006. He gets a bit excited when he sees 1006 in action. Even if it's in a violent manner. Not as much as DR Sawyer though. Sawyer was a nut case. 

 

""Sure, thing boss I'll get a toy and Human subject for you."" I say tired as I walk out. 

 **Playtime Co/ Prison/ Human test subjects' cells/ 1 hour 30 minutes before the hour of Joy/ Nathanal Greens Perspective** 

 

Beeep!

 

""Rise and shine you lazy bums. Time for you to finally kick it."" I said as I entered the human test subject block of the prison. This sector was reserved for all our ""Bad"" employees. Those who stuck their nose in too far and saw things they shouldn't have or those who were just bad at their jobs. We usually fed them to good old Boxy but some we kept for testing. Most of the time we test them on Catnap to see the effects of his gas on an adult. 

 

""Green how's it been."" A familiar voice says from one of the cells

 

""How you doing buddy?"" I ask. Gary, that was the fella's name. Was one of the guys in transportation. Was a friend of mine till he saw too much. He somehow manages to sneak down the labs and saw what we do to the kids. I wish I could do something to save him from the fate of being a human test subject, but I couldn't. What stays in playtime co never leaves playtime Co. That simple. We were still friends. I hop by his cell to talk to him for a bit when I can. We both understand that it isn't worth ruining our friendship over something we didn't have control over. I cannot do anything about the kids and so can't he. 

  
""Well, I'm not dead yet \*Coughs\* so that's got to count for something. I'm doing better than most imamates thanks to you. Especially better that the kids."" He says roughly in his southern accent as he lets out several coughs and chuckles. He rubbed his orange beard a bit as he spoke.

 

""Ain't that the truth. Got bad news though. Your time is up. I got to bring you in for some testing."" I say sighing. I pull out a cigarette and take a smoke. The entire cell block is freezing. I can see Gary's breath as he shivers as he talks. I can also see my breath when I talk. I wish they could have made the prisons a bit hotter. Would have helped both the toys and human test subjects. 

 

""I'm assuming it's something dangerous I'll be dealing with?"" Gary then asks.

 

""Nothing a tough guy like you can't handle."" I joke.

 

""Common what is it?""

 

""Experiment 1006 the prototype."" I say sighing. I'm really sorry buddy I think to myself.

 

""Oh, what a relief. I heard death is pretty swift when it comes to him. I heard some fellas even made it out of the tests with him alive."" Gary says grinning. 

 

""Guess Dr Sawyer has really taken a liking to me over the last few months if he out me with 1006."" Gary continues as he let out a coughing chuckle.

 

""Yah that's the thing Dr Sawyers been dropped out. He got...Well, let's say scraped for wasting company money on his own personal experiments."" I say vaguely.

 

""Oh.... I see."" Gary says as his face pales a bit.

 

""I don't suppose the new guy is sentimental towards Human test subjects?"" Gary said. The one thing I could ever give to Dr H was the fact he at least used Human subjects very few times. He preferred to do any testing himself instead of using cannon fodder like toys or Human subjects. Still didn't mean he wasn’t a complete nut case.

 

""No, he's not. We're dealing with the big man. Lieth Pierre. The boss man wanted to see the testing himself."" I say chuckling grimly.

 

""I guess I'll have to seduce him then."" Gar joked.

 

""You'd have better luck seducing the toys."" I joke back as we break out into small laughter.

 

""Now Green, buddy tell it to me straight. I am I about to go die?"" Gary then asks grimly.

 

""Honestly, most likely. If you don't comply the boss man will feed, you to Boxy. He's the type to terminate anyone who doesn't comply."" 

 

""Alright then \*Sigh\* let's get this over with shall we."" Gary says as I can seem him steeling himself.

 

I open his cell and me, and some other clearance 3 security guards take him towards 1006's cell. It's going to be a long day I think to myself.

 

**Playtime Co/ Several minutes before the hour of Joy/ Prison/ 3rd Person POV**

 

""Hey Cole."" Norm says as he walks over to his buddy.

 

""Hey Norm.""

 

""2 O'clock huh. Best time of day I'm I right"" Norm says to his buddy as Cole lets out an auditable sigh before answering with a tired yes.

 

""So what block are you again?"" Norm asks curiously.

 

""North."" 

 

""Can't say I hear much about that one."" Norm joked.

 

""You wouldn't. You're still a clearance 3 security guard, not clearance 4 like me. You're lucky."" Cole responds with a mild chuckle.

 

""You know what I get in the east. Toys banging on the walls, wailing, screaming, crying for their parents and counselors. It goes on and on. Fucking hell man I wish those brats would shut up and let us have peace and quiet. It goes all day and night, so it wears on you. Like I said before I'd love for those brats to shut up. I'd kill for some more security and quiet."" Norm says annoyed. Cole's response wasn't much better.

 

""Your still pretty lucky man. You know what we get in the north.... Things. Whatever those things are they've lost their humanity. They aren't human anymore. Their cells might as well be animal cages. They are sick and twisted animals. Just pure instincts and anger. Thats all that's left of them \*Sighs\*""

 

""All personnel report to sectors c and d we are experiencing a major containment breach!"" The loudspeaker then blared.

 

""So much for our fucking 2 O'clock."" Norm says with annoyance and toxicity dripping through his voice.

 

""We really have it rough, do we?"" Cole answered as the unholstered their pistols and began to make their way towards the designated sectors.

1ig5dzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangetheory/comments/1ig5dzk/orangetheory_has_helped_me_pull_out_of_a_mental/,Orangetheory has helped me pull out of a mental slump - a 3 month retrospective,"Covid-era has instilled a lot of bad habits. I have fried my brain with nothing hobbies for a quick dopamine fix: weed, alcohol, gooning, binge eating, endless reruns, and doomscrolling. I've tried to make changes before, but simply abstaining from my quick fixes without having a new outlet is not a winning strategy.

Orangetheory has been a fantastic outlet for me. I have been going to classes about 3 days a week for 3 months and it has been incredible for my mental health. These are some of the things I appreciate about Orangetheory.

* **Focus** \- I've been to the gym before, and in retrospect it feels like a waste of time for somebody at my aptitude and discipline. I have no idea what I'm doing (Googling ""starting strength"" is a start but not much better than nothing). Most days I didn't leave the gym satisfied with my workout (if I went at all). But I know that if I just show up to my studio on time and work hard at what the coach tells me to do, I'll feel good about my day, even if it's the only productive thing I did that day. I never once regret going.
* **Accountability** \- ""I feel like shit. Should I get drunk and gorge on Taco Bell at noon today? Ah, damn, I have a 6pm class scheduled. I don't want to be hungover for that. I guess I'll eat a sandwich and drink another carafe of coffee.""
* **Stats and games** \- I really like being able to objectively access *my* performance on an individual workout; it is great motivation. Everyone is at different levels of fitness, but heartrate is a fantastic measure of measuring everyone equally yet relatively. I'm fat, but I can still work hard and get the most little splat points in the class. It's nice.
* **Diversity of neighbors** \- There are some gym rats at my studio but most people seem to be relatively new (>2 yrs) to fitness. However everyone, regardless of skill level, takes each class very seriously. Everyone is there to work - you won't catch anyone dicking around on their phone on the treadmill.
* **Coaches** \- The coaches are excellent. The class format allows for the best of both worlds: personalized coaching and independence. I always let me coach know I appreciate it when they correct my form, but I never feel like somebody is watching me.
* **Price / Value** \- Orangetheory isn't cheap, but for personalized training and an exercise program it's pretty good. Is it expensive? Sure, but it's probably less than I spent on alcohol and fast food during a shit month of ennui. Plus I can book at an alternate studio if the class if full, and keep my familiar workout in practically any city in the country.
* **Pride and self confidence** \- I'm an awkward fuck, I'll say it. I don't stand up straight and I'm nervous around pretty girls. But my confidence and self-talk has improved markedly since I've started working out. I don't like myself, and I'm working on that - in the meantime, this is a part of myself I'm unapologetically proud of.
* **Physical fitness** \- It seems silly to put this last, but the mental effects alone will keep me coming back even if I don't see the physical results I'm looking for. But needless to say I've lost 15 pounds, and I'm stronger. What's not to love?

so, i work there just to work there… something’s broke? idk bro. i just work here. come back later it might be fixed- im getting off track. there’s this old lady that works there, dee, and she takes working in a coffee shop as a life career very seriously. she’s insulted people for their handwriting on labels, and micromanaged people to their limits. i have called her out on it every time, so she doesn’t do it to me. 

she comes in at 7pm every week day, we close at 7. sometimes, even sooner. 6:30 was the earliest. she comes in and begins making things. she’s scheduled to come in at 3 in the morning , and she doesn’t clock in until that time. she gets shit faced drunk in the building and answers calls while she isn’t on the clock. she makes food and drinks while she is drunk. people let it slide because she’s been there 15 years. she takes a seniority over everyone.

now, my question is, would i be an asshole if i simply, told her no. told her to call her husband and come get her because she is in the way while we’re actively doing our job. she’s actively complaining out loud when something is exactly perfect when we are just beginning to close. we’ve had issues with stealing, she was the only one pulling drawers with another higher manager at one point. this is a serious security risk in my eyes but no one is doing jack shit. wibta? … with further counting it’s 7/9 hours but i’m just a girl ",1,1738524553.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1ig5ake,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1ig5ake/my_dad_is_a_chair_nosleep/,My Dad is a chair. (Nosleep),"The title doesn't lie. My Dad is a chair. To be specific, he's a fully upholstered bright orange angel accent living room chair. The kind with wooden legs you'd find in any 3 piece suit from the '70s. He's pretty comfortable, truth be told. A little lumpy in places, but his padding is soft. Warm too. He's *always* warm. There's also the tell-tale *ba-thump ba-thump ba-thump* coming from his back cushion. A steady rhythm at my lumbar to remind me I'm sitting in no ordinary chair.

He wasn't always a chair. Until last year he was Kevin the accountant. He was 51, slightly overweight, and generally seemed to enjoy life as a human. He was married to Mom. He still is but, well, as you can imagine it's a little complicated now.

It was funny at first. He came home from work one day and just sat in a corner of the living room.

When we'd ask him why he was sitting on the floor and not the $4000 cream leather couch, he'd just smile and say ""It feels right here"". It stopped being funny the morning he didn't go to work. Turns out he hadn't slept the night before. He'd been watching a movie with Mom but hadn't gone with her to bed. She left him sitting in his spot, unsuspicious of the ""I'm not tired, I'll be up a little later"" lie. She and I both begged him to get up but he refused to move. Phoned in sick at work, the whole deal. Just spent the day sitting on the floor in his corner. We kept asking him what was wrong, why he wouldn't get up except to use the bathroom, and he just kept saying ""No… no this feels right"".

Mom phoned the doctor around the third day of this. He'd stopped eating or drinking, you see. Stopped getting up to use the bathroom too. Surprisingly though there weren't as many… umm… accidents, as you'd think. Once he'd allowed the last of the food and drink to leave him it seemed to stop coming. We also didn't hear his belly growl despite going a day and a half without food. The doctor couldn't make sense of it. Their first guess was that it was psychosomatic, but that wouldn't explain the absence of digestive activity exposed by the stethoscope. They said they'd be back to take some blood samples in a few days after they liaised with some colleagues. Unfortunately, as I said, this was last year. 2020. We never heard back from the doctor thanks to the virus-that-shall-not-be-named. I guess ""guy with gut troubles who refuses to move"" is low on the priorities list during a global pandemic.

Somehow Mom managed to wrangle long-term sick leave with Dad's company. Decades of loyal employee-ism combined with Mom's attendance of every company BBQ and softball game helped Mr. Bannerfrag buy the ""unexplained stomach concern requiring hospitalization"" excuse. I'll never forget that phone call. At the time, Dad losing his job was the worst-case scenario for both of us. He'd always been the breadwinner. Neither of us could support ourselves without him, we'd lose the house in under a year. Dad didn't seem too perturbed by Mom's frantic pacing, or the lies she wormed through the phone to Mr. Bannerfrag. He just stared at the wall serenely, hovering his butt half a foot from the carpet, balancing with his legs bent and his hands flat on the ground behind him.

That night I fell asleep listening to Mom yelling at Dad. He never yelled back.

We started noticing the physical changes a few days later. That's when we realized this *wasn't* psychosomatic. Unfortunately, our shitty ""best insurance deal on the market"" doctor wasn't picking up the phone. We'd get passive-aggressive emails informing us they were ""waiting to hear back from colleagues"", but that was it. This was not good. Especially not when the joints in Dad's arms and legs had fused. The not-goodness of the Doctor's silence increased a thousandfold when we sent photos of Dad's hands and feet flaking off like discarded spider husks the following week. Did the response change? No. We got a *very* snippy email about shortages on ICU wards and the “critical international situation"". Mom's shouting match with the Chief of Medicine, the one she demanded her way up the phone chain to speak to, didn't change things. We were on our own.

Mom spent all her time in the living room with Dad. I'd help her wash him, try and make him eat, talk to him when she'd tire out and fall asleep on the rug. Every day of this routine brought with it new changes in Dad's body. It started with his limbs, as you can probably guess. When his hands and feet fell off there was no blood. They flaked apart, crusty and dry and brittle throughout. Even the bones of his toes and fingers had the density and consistency of dead skin. The wrists and ankles they left behind were smooth and hard. It was difficult to tell whether we were looking at flesh or exposed bone. The dark shining surface seemed to blend into his normal arm at the base of the stumps. This discoloration would rise further up his limbs daily, and before long I awoke to see Dad's head and torso fused to the wooden chair legs supporting my weight while I write this.

Well, I use the term ""Dad's head and torso"" in the loosest possible sense. By the time his limbs were completely replaced, the rest of him had undergone a slow, harrowing transformation of its own.

His shoulders, and the arms attached to them, descended lower and lower. They found their final resting place at Dad's pelvis, sat squarely behind his rigid legs. The chest area they'd left behind had its own problems. Day by day Dad's neck retracted further inwards. It didn't stop when his jaw met collarbone, either. It pulled Dad's head deep into his ribcage. His face flattened as the skull supporting it sank, forcing his eyes to point in opposite directions. Eventually, they slid down to where his nipples once lay, resting glassy and vacant on his pecks. The change wasn't quick enough to break his jaw though. Instead, it bent outward, its hinges spreading wide across Dad's broad chest. Each morning I'd find Mom sobbing over a fresh unnecessary piece of himself he'd discarded. Hair, ears, nose, his… umm…. his *thingy…* all of them flaked off and crumbled to dust in her hands.

He lost the ability to speak as his head withdrew. Unsurprising though, right? He made his intentions clear before he went . The last words he ever said to me.

""Don't cry… I am chair… always was chair… *happy* as chair…""

That was the worst part, I think. Knowing that, whatever the fuck was happening to Dad, he wasn't resisting it. That when he'd got that initial urge to sit in the corner and not get up, he didn't fight it. That he was *happy* this way. The implication being that when he was human, when he was a father and husband and accountant, he wasn't.

Sadly I still don't know why or how Dad became a chair. I didn't post any photos, you see. Mom wouldn't let me, didn't want the embarrassment. Wanted to keep Dad's dignity intact. Thing is, I agreed with her and kind of still do. I'm *glad* I didn't go to the socials with pics of Dad at various stages of his journey. The temptation was there to see if anyone could help. Nobody could have though, could they? Dad would have become just another internet circus freak. I've done enough research and digging over the months to know that whatever happened to Dad, he's the only one.

Well, almost only.

Mom's own changes started around the time Dad's skin was rethreading into orange fabric and his eyes had hardened into plastic buttons. Her change was a little different. It started in her torso, stretching her day by day while she remained in crab-pose. I must say, she makes a *great* couch. Her transformation may have been a little more distressing, but the end result is better (sorry Dad, it is what it is). I think the worst part with Mom was the despondency. Dad was so serene as he changed. Mom though? Mom wouldn't stop weeping. Quiet sobs, tears that fell for a few days even after her own eyes had become flat plastic. She wasn't crying because of the change though, I think. I think it was because she wouldn't get to see how beautiful I'll look when I go through my own metamorphosis.

Thing is, I get it now. Dad was right. He *was* chair. Mum *was* couch. I *am* coffee table. I always was. I was scared at first when I realized. The truth hit me like a piano dropped from the Empire State Building. I was scrubbing the last of Mom's remaining human skin when it struck through every bone in my wrong body, just as it must have done both Dad and Mom.

I spent that whole night sitting on Dad, tears falling down my cheeks, staring at my spot. I didn't want it to be true. I screamed for it not to be, more than once. I couldn't deny the facts I knew deep down to my bones though. That spot, the space on the rug in front of chair Dad and couch Mom, is for me. It's mine. Where I belong.

Unlike blissfully accepting Dad, and weeping resigning Mom, I fought it for a few days. I’m not like them; I’m only 17. I have… had... dreams, ambitions, goals. I wanted to go to college, settle down, marry some lucky guy, be a Mom. I wasn’t ready to give up my human form. I spent my nights begging for more time. Nothing answered. The urges didn’t abate, my awareness of reality now the illusions had been swept away was too great. When I have slept this last week or so my dreams have always been the same. I dreamt of *true* reality, of how I now know things should be. I dream of me in my place, my body elongated and wooden and flat as is right, as is correct, as is natural. I have long, blissful slumbers filled with the feeling of hot ceramic mugs on my tabletop and thick carpet beneath my four legs.

I can’t fight it anymore. I’m posting this here but also printing it out to leave as a note for the removal guys. I want them to be careful with us when the bank repossesses the house and we end up in storage. Please keep us together, if you can. We’re a set. Dad’s sick leave ended months ago. As you can imagine, the foreclosure notices have been piling up. I stopped caring about the pile of mail under the door around the time that Mom’s ribcage split and flattened into her wide pinstripe-velvet upholstered back. I haven’t been hungry in days, or thirsty. I’m not even sure if I’m breathing now I think about it. I’m still scared, but I’ve come to accept that this is the way things have to be. I don’t know why, they just do. Maybe it’s a curse, maybe this house is buried on some ancient ritual site, maybe it’s just some freak anomaly of physics. Who knows. Whatever the reason, I have to suck it up and accept the way things are. This body, this walking wobbling mass of skin and bone and jibbly bits that I love so much, isn’t right. It isn’t mine. I’m not meant for it anymore. Once I post this and print the copy for the removal guys I’m going to get in my spot. Then it’s just a case of closing my eyes and waiting. I can already feel my limbs pulling inward, my thighs and upper arms sliding to where they’ll meet at my navel in a few days. There’s a tugging on the back of my knees where they’ll bend in on themselves, and all twenty of my fingers and toes grow number with each hour that passes.

Do I have any regrets? Thousands. There’s so much I’ll never get to do, to see, to go, to be. I can’t hide from the truth though. Not anymore.

The only way Phil escapes is by finally agreeing to buy it.","I originally posted this a year ago today ([here](https://old.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1ah8esg/groundhog_day_ned_ryerson_is_the_devil_and_he/)):

**First and foremost:** 

When Phil first encounters Ned he insults him. Immediately after the insult Phil steps into a puddle, and Ned remarks, ""Well-ha-ha! Watch out for that first step, it's a doozy!"" 

The ""first step"" Ned refers to literally the first step Phil takes after being placed into the time loop, and Ned is laughing at the irony that Phil's first step was so unpleasant. It's a cruel irony that only Ned is able to enjoy.

**Secondly:**

On the last day of the loop we see that Phil has purchased insurance from Ned, much to Ned's pleasure. This is actually the act that frees him from the time loop, not him successfully getting Rita sexually interested in him.

**A tertiary point:**

Immediately after Phil takes his ""first step"" into his hellish torment, the framing of the shot prominently shows a red coffee cup with steam coming off it as Ned laughs devilishly. http://i.imgur.com/IL0ti5t.jpg. Perhaps this symbolizes the firey torment of hell, directed at Phil as Ned points his finger at him.

Further corroborating that this is religious symbology...note the framing when Ned finally releases Phil from his perdition: http://i.imgur.com/Avvvil7.jpg

Phil's head is illuminated in a halo of light reminiscent of the Christ, and the groundhogs appear above his head in a Holy cross. 

**A point that just occurred to me:**

Consider this: in this day and age, buying a shit-ton of life insurance is as close as you can get to selling your soul to someone.

**Summary:**

Phil's journey didn't involve his betterment as a person or getting Rita interested in him. Instead he was cast into damnation by Ned when he insulted him and refused his insurance, and he was absolved of his sin when he finally bought it and treated him respectfully.",22,1738524379.0,FanTheories,2,0.78,False

I didn't buy anything that was unnecessary (minus a couple of Christmas gift cards to get rid of and even then I tried to use them in ways to help me be more sustainable). 
But I have also been struggling with depression (medicated) and I realized last night that I absolutely HAD to force myself to clean out my cats' litter box because it had been way too long. I felt so bad for neglecting that chore. I had been thinking about a litter robot for a long time, but I never wanted to spend the money. I got scared off of knock offs due to cats being injured/killed by the mechanism. So at 1am last night I decided to purchase the litter robot 4 (mark of an impulse buy lol). I did use a referral link for $50 off but it was still $700. 
I guess my question this morning is should I go ahead and return it when it gets here? I do actually feel like it will improve my and my cats' quality of life though, so I am really torn. Part of me says what if I swear off coffee runs and take out foods that I had previously allowed this month to make it up?

I haven’t been diagnosed with any IBD or IBS, tho my bowel movements are all over the place. Sometimes uncontrollable “gotta go RN!”, and sometimes I don’t pass for days at a time. The one time I visited my doctor for this issue, she wanted me to take intense laxatives 3x a day for a month straight, because she suspected I was impacted (never tried to confirm it) but I came to the conclusion that would absolutely destroy my gut and I’d be having accidents the whole time. So, I politely declined and never went back.

I’m wondering when you’re starting out, how often should you be doing it? I’ve read people do it daily, or sometimes 3x a row once a week. What’s best for beginners to make sure it’s safe and healthy?

Further on this question, are there any adverse side effects I should be looking out for? Again, I have similar symptoms to IBD and have had them my whole life, so I want to really careful not to further injure my gut health.

Note: please dont suggest me to go see a therapist or psychiatrist i already know what is right for me 


I used to be a very full of life person and lived my life to fullest but 6 years ago i got my first panic attack that really changed my life, 
I had a rollercoaster ride after ups and downs, some months totally fine 
Some months very hard and difficult to a point i could not get out from house. 

Anyways i did found cure to my anxiety and it was talking to a friend who helped me a lot with this and cured me to a point i started going out from house and started feeling normal! That friend made me bring back my lost confidence and everything! 

Anyhow we stopped talking and with time i again felt into depression, and now i again rebuilt myself and trying my best to get better i am already doing treatment and getting slightly better now 
But deep down i have fears since i am an only child and i always wanted siblings. 
So now i am trying here to see if can find a best friend and a partner! 


I am a ambi vert person, 
My current issues made me an introvert but i still want to live life again and go to nice coffee shops or go into the mountains and travel! I love the idea of camping and cooking steaks. Do cycling! I cook aswell! 

I love to make my close friends happy and i am emotionally empathetic person, at this stage i really wanna come Close to deen that i am trying yet i am still not able to reach that level

I wanna take them to park and chill with them 

I am graduated and i belong to good family who is very supportive and very sweet with me. They have been with my 24/7 with my bad days and i am sure my dad and mum are literally one of the nicest person youll meet. 

What i dont want in a partner: too materialistic, i myself love to buy things and stuff but i just like that thinking where we completely forget our real purpose in this world and start comparing our selves with people, i just want a peaceful life

He looked up from his phone, adjusted his sunglasses (inside, by the way), and said, “Oh, so you’re parasocial?”

I kinda laughed and was like, “Nah, just saying what’s up.” But he shook his head and muttered, “Classic chat behavior.”

I went to order my coffee, and when I turned around, I saw him at the condiment station dumping an ungodly amount of oat milk into his cup—like, he had fully emptied the carton. The barista saw and sighed, “Sir, that’s for everyone.”

Hasan scoffed, turned around dramatically, and said, “Ohhh, so now we care about distribution of resources?” before slamming his cup down and spilling coffee all over the counter.

At the register, the guy in front of him asked, “Do you take Bitcoin?” Hasan let out a sharp sigh, slowly removed his sunglasses, and rubbed his temples like he was in actual pain. “Jesus Christ,” he muttered. “Another tech bro falling for digital monopoly money.”

The cashier said no, and the guy shrugged and paid with his card. Hasan shook his head and whispered, “Embarrassing.”

When it was his turn, he pulled out a thick stack of cash, flipping through the crisp bills like he was about to hand over a hundred. Then, just as the cashier reached for it, he smirked, stuffed the stack back into his pocket, and slid a single quarter across the counter.

The cashier blinked. “Sir, your total is $6.75.”

Hasan adjusted his rings, crossed his arms, and said, “We all gotta do our part to dismantle capitalist price gouging.” Then he grabbed his coffee and walked out.

I have some questions about LVH, blood pressure and stuff related to this.","Hello ladies and gentlemen,

I'm going to try to be as short as possible. I'm 6 feet tall, a bit overweight (went from 242 on new year's to 224 today, target weight is 195). My work is interesting and stressful, not one day is the same and I usually start it off with office work (from 5:30 AM to 9:30 AM), then I eat lunch, then work physically more demanding work from 10:30 AM to 1:30 PM. Then I go home. I work on heavy machinery aswell, depends on the day.

On new year's I went to see my mother in law with my girlfriend. I hate her, but love my girlfriend and we usually see each other 3 times a year. We drank some coffee, ate some dried meat and after a couple of hours me and my gf went home. I drove (1 hour) to home but I saw my hand shaking like never before at my MIL but thought nothing of it. Then I got home and realized my hands are shaking like before, otherwise I felt completely fine. Took my BP, it was 221/105. I went into panic mode, lied down but could not relax then after 5 minutes I took measurement again and it was 205/110. My GF took me to the ER, where they took their time, everything seemed normal, EKG, O2 stats, everything seemed fine so I got some pills that widen veins and in 20 minutes it went to 170/100 then at home 150/90.

I took candesartan (16 mg - it's a pill that widens your veins) for 10 years, my cardiologist said (3 years ago) that other pills perscribed by my GP are too much for me. On April 2024 it was my last appointment at cardiologist and we did an ultrasound of the heart, LVEF was 69% and some starting, concentrated left venticular hypertrophy was shown, also my lung heart (it's the right side of the heart if I'm not mistaken) was almost as big as my left heart. But I had covid 3 times prior to the last appointment and also had a cold. Nothing was heard on the lungs and also seen on the ultrasound so he assured me everything is fine. All in all everything looked completely fine. 

After the crysis my GP perscribed me a combined amlodipine 5mg/candesartan 16mg in the morning. I felt like being stoned, I almost fell asleep on my job but that was only first two days then it normalized but my BP went up not down. I was an occassional drinker (1-2 beers per day, 2-3 days per week, sometimes more, sometimes less) and an occassional smoker (1 pack of cigarettes for 2 weeks or a week) but after the crysis I stopped. It was so weird to see it not helping, I asked my GP about it and she scheduled an appointment and gave me candesartan in the evening (16 mg). My resting HR went from 65 to 55 and over nights I get HR of 47-52.

I am quite active, I love cycling, play tennis, some basketball, volleyball, I go on walks with my family. 

In the last week my BP somehow lowered, it got under 140/80 regularly, but my first measurement is always so high because I get nervous, I literally feel my heart beat harder when the machine pumps. First reading is always 160/90, second almost always 145-150/80 and then it lowers a bit more.

I am overthinking this stuff, I'm reading articles about it everyday and I'm not even sure what's right and what's not. I fear I'm going to die from the low resting HR, that the meds will lower my BP too much, that I'll suffer a stroke. I lost my apetite, I'm constantly trying to fight this. I have no symptoms but the ones from panic. 2 days ago I cycled on my exercise bike for 30 minutes, then my brother came to visit, we drank a beer and I suddenly felt a cramp in my leg (that didn't even hurt), thought it was from my heart (not the cycling lol) and I just started sweating, heart started beating like hell, took BP it said 180/100. I needed 1 hour to relax, next day I woke up my BP was 170/100, went to work, focused on my job, took my BP after 1 hour of working, my BP was 138/74.

Should I worry about this or what should I do? I have an appointment with my GP in 10 days. I just think that my overthinking is killing me more than my actual problems (if I should call them that) are.

Is the LVH concerning?

Heather Cox Richardson, Letters from an American","The Battle Hymn became the anthem of the Union during the Civil War, and exactly three years after it appeared in the *Atlantic Monthly*, on February 1, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Joint Resolution of Congress passing the Thirteenth Amendment and sending it off to the states for ratification. The amendment provided that ""\[n\]either slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."" It gave Congress power to enforce that amendment. This was the first amendment that gave power to the federal government rather than taking it away.

When the measure had passed the House the day before, the lawmakers and spectators had gone wild. “The members on the floor huzzaed in chorus with deafening and equally emphatic cheers of the throng in the galleries,” the *New York Times* reported. “The ladies in the dense assemblage waved their handkerchiefs, and again and again the applause was repeated, intermingled with clapping of hands and exclamations of ‘Hurrah for freedom,’ ‘Glory enough for one day,’ &c. The audience were wildly excited, and the friends of the measure were jubilant.” Indiana congressman George Julian later recalled, “It seemed to me I had been born into a new life, and that the world was overflowing with beauty and joy, while I was inexpressibly thankful for the privilege of recording my name on so glorious a page of the nation’s history.”

But the hopes of that moment had crumbled within a decade. Almost a century later, students from Bennett College, a women’s college in Greensboro, North Carolina, set out to bring them back to life. They organized to protest the F.W. Woolworth Company’s willingness to sell products to Black people but refusal to serve them food. On February 1, 1960, their male colleagues from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University sat down on stools at Woolworth’s department store lunch counter in Greensboro. David Richmond, Franklin McCain, Ezell A. Blair Jr., and Joseph McNeil were first-year students who wanted to find a way to combat the segregation under which Black Americans had lived since the 1880s.

So the men forced the issue by sitting down and ordering coffee and doughnuts. They sat quietly as the white waitress refused to serve them and the store manager ignored them. They came back the next day with a larger group. This time, television cameras covered the story. By February 3 there were 60 men and women sitting. By February 5 there were 50 white male counterprotesters.

By March the sit-in movement had spread across the South, to bus routes, museums, art galleries, and swimming pools. In July, after profits had dropped dramatically, the store manager of the Greensboro Woolworth’s asked four Black employees to put on street clothes and order food at the counter. They did, and they were served. Desegregation in public spaces had begun.

In 1976, President Gerald Ford officially recognized February 1 as the first day of Black History Month, asking the public to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.”

On February 1, 2023, Tyre Nichols’s family laid their 29-year-old son to rest in Memphis, Tennessee. He was so severely beaten by police officers on January 7, allegedly for a traffic violation, that he died three days later.

In 2025 the U.S. government under President Donald Trump has revoked a 60-year-old executive order that protected equal opportunity in employment and has called for an end to all diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. This February 1, neither the Pentagon nor the State Department will recognize Black History Month.

35M, went on a 2nd date with a woman yesterday, which was a coffee/walk, which was a bit weird as a 2nd date. We had a drinks date for the 1st nearly two weeks ago. Was caught off guard she wanted to meet up again, nothing romantic happened on the first date, just pleasant conversation.

11 day gap between the dates and her communication was very limited during that time. Figured she wasn’t a big texter. Was her idea to meet up for a coffee/walk, but she planned it around meeting her friends in my area afterwards. Maybe she wasn’t willing to block out an evening and go out of her way to see me (yet). She did tell me that she was going to be busy over the next few weeks when she suggested the coffee/walk though, it was something that she could squeeze into her schedule.

Initially, she seemed receptive enough, even playfully teasing me. I knew she had to meet up with friends, but I think she cut the date short. Ended up just being under an hour and I think initially she said we had 90mins. Should have I made a move on her? She sat us down on a bench pretty soon after we started walking for some reason, spent 10min there chatting, then carried on. Maybe she got cold feet because I didn’t put my arm around her or something? I also wasn’t well rested, so wasn’t exactly on my A game. Perhaps i shouldve rain checked it.

Date ended abruptly too. She was like “You don’t have to follow me back to our starting point” and then she asked where I was getting my bus from, I told her and hugged her goodbye. Sent her a follow up text, she didn't respond and noticed she had unmatched me today.

Hi, been in corporate since I graduated high school. Started off with 2 months unpaid internships, continued while in university. 3rd internship they were reviewing candidates for a paid internship position part time and the interviewer flirted with me outside the room after it was over. 

I entertained him and we ended up at the coffee shop across the street. It was end of work day and after coffee he invited me to his place saying ""I hope it's not too direct..."". 

I never said yes, but we got in his car and he started driving with his hand on my thigh. I left the next morning before he woke up. And heard back from the company 2 weeks later that I was the candidate that made the cut. 

Ever since then I havent let a single opportunity pass by if it had the ability to enhance my career. This was 8 years ago and I'm the youngest ever to hold my current position in this company.",0,1738523763.0,confessions,15,0.46,False
1ig4zq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1ig4zq2/is_this_level_of_exhaustion_normal/,Is this level of exhaustion normal?,"My toddler is 19 months. I am a working mom (50-60hr work weeks, I own a business). I also solo parent about 50-75% of the week due to my husband’s job taking him away for 3-5 full days per week (he’s a firefighter, they work 48-96hr shifts).

I have never been a morning person (I naturally wake up between 9:30-10:00am w/ no alarms). I have always been the type of person that does best with a nap midday as well. Caffeine gives me heart palpitations and panic attacks, so I can’t use that to help me stay awake.

While I have 5 day a week childcare, on Sundays (the only day I don’t have to work), when I wake up with my toddler at 7am, I am barely functioning. It takes all my energy to even get out of bed & walk to the kitchen to make breakfast. I have to fight to keep my eyes open - I’ve accidentally fallen asleep before on the couch when trying to watch him. My husband works most Sundays so he cannot help support me. I live for nap time on these days. I literally barely function until my toddler goes down for a nap & I get to nap too.

I’ve never met someone who has this level of exhaustion, at this stage in their child’s life. I deal with immense judgment from my friends not understanding that my exhaustion is NOT simply, “oh I’m tired and would love a nap if possible, but I’ll be okay if I have some coffee,” but rather it’s, “I literally can’t drive a car right now because I might fall asleep driving & I’m too weak to even stand up for long periods of time.”

My question is, is this level of exhaustion normal considering my unique circumstance, or is it perhaps an indicator of an underlying health issue that I should get checked out? Has anyone experienced anything similar?",1,1738523655.0,toddlers,4,1.0,False

1ig4ypf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ig4ypf/my_sister_is_in_a_toxic_relationship_and_its/,My sister is in a toxic relationship and its driving the family apart,"This is a long one, so I apologise for that.

I (M 48) have always been close to my sister (slightly younger 40s).  She has 2 kids who are in mid teens and I love them as much as my own kids.  

A few years ago she split with her b/f after 25 years.  She was lonely and she didnt love him.  I supported her decision, it was very sad.

She started dating a guy around 10 years her junior and definitely went in full steam ahead.  He would stay around hers and she was always with him.  I met him and I didn't have a particularly great feeling about him.  I found out from her that he had a kid from a previous relationship he didn't see.  Apparently this was his choice and my sister thinks this isn't suspicious.  I was concerned.  

About 5 months into the relationship I get a call early AM  from my sister, inconsolable, they'd had a huge fight and she kicked him out.  We go out for a coffee and she spills the beans that he is volatile.  He loses his temper at the drop of a hat and they've already had multiple arguments, usually drink is involved on both sides.  He got abusive, threatening, and said some very personal and hurtful things and she kicked him out.  He then called her, threatened to spread personal info about her on her FB.  She then tells me that he's been in prison, for domestic abuse, but apparently it was over something minor that blew out of control and because he had a previous record he was given a jail term.   

I was calm, but I explained that this was crazy that she was with someone like this.  She agreed. They split up and she seemed like she was going to move on.  

2 weeks later they're back together.  The whole family is concerned but she is adamant that he is a nice guys and he will change.  

Over the past year and a half they have been in a cycle of argue, split up, get back together until Christmas, when they were all at my parents house for Boxing day drinks.  They both got very drunk, but him much more so.  He was saying some quite inappropriate things and I could tell he was going to be a problem.  The party ends, I'm at home about to get in bed and her kids are on the phone to me.  They are scared and need me to stay on the phone as my sister and her b/f are arguing, he made threats about them and he is threatening her.  She kicks him out.  He drives home blind drunk.  Her kids are scared and I'm trying to calm them down.  Their dad is on the phone with me asking what is going on as he has had them on the phone.  The whole family find out and it seems like this might be then end of it.  It went a step further and surely she sees the danger to her kids. 

2 weeks later, they are back together, she doesn't tell me, but confides in my wife.  .

  
I feel like over the course of a couple of years I've totally lost my sister.  She is blinded to the impact its having on her kids, the stress and anxiety its causing the family and I don't know how to deal with it.  My elderly parents are really struggling to deal with it.  This saddens me, as my dad is terminally ill and has enough to deal with.

I've told her I don't want him around me or my family.  Her friends are all saying she has to stay away from him, but she seems to be driven on by this.  Maybe she likes the danger?

Now even me and my wife are arguing about it because I feel she not on the same page as me about it, although she insists she is appeasing my sister to make sure my sister always has someone to turn to.  My wife came from an abusive upbringing.

  
TL;DR  My sister is in an abusive relationship with a guy who has been in prison for domestic abuse.  She is completely blinded by him and cant see the issues its causing her kids and the wider family.  Im  worried about the impact on her kids.",2,1738523584.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

The overhead light hums, flickering every few minutes, like it’s on the verge of dying. It smells in here; stale coffee, cigarette smoke, sweat. Maybe it’s mine. Maybe it’s his.

The detective sits across from me, rubbing his eyes. He looks exhausted, but not like he wants to sleep. More like he’s holding himself together by sheer force of will. His fingers tap against the metal table, slow and deliberate, a metronome counting down to something I don’t want to know.

I can’t stop crying. My chest heaves with every gasping breath. I want to wipe my face, but my hands are shaking too much. He doesn’t care. He just stares, his jaw clenched so tight I can hear his teeth grind.

Finally, he exhales sharply through his nose.

**“Mr. Holland, we don’t need a confession. We have all the evidence.”** His voice is flat, emotionless, but his fingers twitch like they’re itching to do something else. **“I just need to know; where is she?”**

I squeeze my eyes shut. My throat is raw.

**“It wasn’t me.”** My voice is barely a whisper, but I force it out again. **“It wasn’t me.”**

I sniff, trying to hold myself together.

**“I was on a date when the babysitter called. Kayla. She’s been watching Jenny for months now, she’s great, she’s reliable. But when I picked up, something was wrong.”**

The memory sends a fresh wave of nausea rolling through me.

**“Her voice was off. Like she was talking through a bad connection, but…wet. Garbled, like her throat was full of something. But I heard enough to know something was wrong with Jenny.”**

The detective doesn’t blink.

**“I ran out of the restaurant. Sped all the way home. I barely remember the drive; I just knew I had to get there.”**

I suck in a shaky breath.

**“But when I got there, something was…off. The house was dark. Too dark. The porch light wasn’t on, even though I always leave it on for Kayla. No sound. No movement. Just…stillness.”**

I pause, trying to keep my voice steady.

**“Then I saw the upstairs window.”**

My stomach twists.

**“The lamp was on in Jenny’s room. And Kayla…she was standing there, looking down at me.”**

A flicker of something in the detective’s eyes.

I grip the table, my knuckles white.

**“She was smiling.”**

The words taste like bile.

**“Not smiling; grinning. Too wide. Too forced. Like someone was pulling the corners of her mouth back with a hook. And her hand”**

I swallow hard.

**“She was waving. But her fingers were bent the wrong way, like they were broken.”**

I shake my head, trying to rid myself of the image.

**“I ran inside. Called for them. Nothing. Jenny was gone. Kayla was nowhere. But then”**

I hesitate.

**“Something moved outside.”**

The backyard. The swing set creaked in the breeze, but there was no wind.

**“She was there.”**

The detective leans in slightly.

I don’t want to say it, but I do.

**“Jenny.”**

The name feels foreign in my mouth.

**“She was standing in the backyard, barefoot in the grass, swaying slightly. The moonlight hit her face just right, and that’s when I saw it.”**

I can barely get the words out.

**“Her eyes.”**

The detective stills.

**“They were mine.”**

Silence.

The buzzing overhead light grows louder, like it’s listening.

**“I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. She lifted her little hand and waved at me; just like Kayla had. Same motion. Same broken fingers.”**

I swallow, my throat dry as sandpaper.

**“And then…she opened her mouth.”**

The detective’s stare sharpens.

**“She didn’t cry. She didn’t speak. She just…laughed.”**

A wet, gurgling sound, like something trying to force its way out of her tiny throat. It wasn’t a sound a baby should make.

**“I ran. I didn’t think; I just ran. But as I turned back to the house, the porch light flickered on.”**

I blink rapidly, my head throbbing.

**“And I saw myself standing in the doorway.”**

The detective stiffens.

**“What?”** His voice is barely above a whisper.

I grip the table harder.

**“Me. Standing there, staring back. Same clothes. Same face. But I wasn’t moving. And then…""**

I let out a shaky breath.

**""The me in the doorway? He smiled. And he waved.""**

The detective stands abruptly. His chair scrapes against the floor.

The fluorescent light flickers again.

Something shifts in the reflection of the two-way mirror behind him.

Not me.

Not him.

Something else.

In my case, the headaches are so bad I am unable to function. I can handle being tired and lacking motivation or focus but I cannot deal with the physical pain caused by the withdrawal headaches.

For additional context, I am already tried the following to deal with the headaches:

* Drinking tons of water (3-4 litres a day) with electrolytes
* Supplementing with L-Tyrosine when I quit
* Tried quitting with modafinil
* Taking tadalafil (Cialis) for better blood flow
* Painkillers (they seem to not really help)

1ig4t05,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1ig4t05/constipation_help/,Constipation help," I'm currently dealing with the worst case of constipation I've ever had. My last bowel movements was 01/23/25. Before this all began I was already drinking a gallon of water daily, taking a probiotic, tracking my fiber intake and walking 30 minutes a day after lunch. Usually when I'm backed up I can fix it 24-48 hours with either senna leaf tea + 1-2 enemas across two days. I'm feeling scared from my lack of movement, I'm not passing anything, typically I know I'm constipated because I pass what I call ""marbles"" instead of a real bowel movement. 

 Starting Monday I began drinking a kombucha with breakfast and drinking a green smoothie heavy in leafy greens every day, adding a fiber powder to my morning coffee, added in Beano and GasX. I also took senna leaf tea, nothing. So Tuesday I did an enema, still nothing. I did tea Wednesday and another enema Thursday, still nothing. So I bought  split stool softener and stimulant laxative pills. I took those Friday evening, nothing. I started massaging my belly following the route of my large intestine to aid digestion, still nothing.

 So yesterday I took a magnesium supplement split into two doses, I took the stool softener/ stimulant laxative split into two doses, and between those I drank another cup of senna tea. I passed basically dirty water a few times this morning, that's it. I'm really afraid I may have a fecal impaction. 

 What has worked for your constipation? I appreciate any tips or ideas. I don't want to call out of work tomorrow and need a doctor to be manually helping me, thats sounds mortifying. Thanks for reading, I know this was long!

DINK couple looking to buy in the suburbs of a HCOL major city, HHI between $400-600K/yr. Two dogs, no kids, but actively trying. 

Both work from home, ideally would like two offices spaces that don’t overlap with a guest room. Long term planning on 2 kids, would like each to have their own room, but it’s negotiable. We have a lot of guests and do a lot of entertaining. 

We are stuck between three houses and kind of need to make a decision this weekend as one of them is likely to go under contract tomorrow. All have the same/similar enough school systems. We won’t be able to do any additions to the homes as they’re all in a historic area. 

First: 

**[Center Entrance Colonial](https://redf.in/hboisH)** 4,000 sq ft house, 4 bed + 2 full and 2 1/2 baths on a 175 X 90 ft lot. “Lovingly maintained” aka hasn’t been touched in >30 years. Will need a major kitchen remodel, new bathrooms, and new roof (within the next 5 yrs). ~1 mile to the closest cup of coffee. 

No AC, would need to add pretty much immediately. 

Asking Price: $1.35 mil

Estimated Reno costs: $300-500K (over the next 10 yrs)

Second: 

**[Grand Tudor](https://smartfloorplan.com/adminka/public/api/shell/v485248/info-&-map/idx)** 5,000 sq ft house, 4 beds plus a large den, a tandem room, and a coach house. 4 full + 1/2 bath. Bathrooms are dated but doable, same with the kitchen. Realistically will want to update in the next 5-10 yrs. New roof in the next ~5 yrs. Kinda funky layout. ~1 mile to the closest cup of coffee. Getting towards the outskirts of the town. 

Has a basement we could finish. 

Asking Price: $1.15mil

Estimated Reno costs: $200-300K (over the next 10 yrs)

Third: 

**Old Farmhouse** (not yet listed) 3,500 sq ft house, 5 bed + 2 full and 2 1/2 bath. Very well renovated in the last 10 years. Big drawback is it doesn’t have a primary bathroom (although we could add one). On one of the only cul de sac streets in the area, 2 blocks to the nearest cup of coffee. 

Asking Price: $1.5mil

Estimated Reno costs: $50-75K (adding a primary bath in the next 5 yrs)

Third attempt working on my query. Got so much helpful feedback last time, and I really appreciate it. I hope I'm getting the hang of it. It is a standalone but series potential. Do I put that in my query letter or no? Thank You!!

  


I’m seeking representation for my contemporary romance, *THE SUNSETS WITH YOU*, an 89,000-word novel perfect for fans of When in Rome by Sarah Adams and Meet Me at the Lake by Carley Fortune. With its small-town charm, sizzling tension, and emotional depth, this story explores love, ambition, and the courage it takes to let someone in.

The last thing Lena Oakley expects is for Hollywood’s golden boy, Callum Hayes, to show up in her sleepy Maine town—especially not after having his heart stomped on by his ex and the tabloids. For Lena, Greenwater is both a safe haven and a suffocating trap: a place where the coffee shop knows her order and the lake calms her thoughts, but also where she feels stuck in a dead-end job with no real future. She’s always dreamed of making a name for herself behind the scenes of Broadway, but staying in control has always meant keeping people at arm’s length.

That is, until Callum.

A chance encounter at her favorite bar turns into an unexpected partnership when she’s assigned to work on his new company’s ad campaign. Lena has a rule—one chance, and if someone hurts her, they’re out. But Callum isn’t like anyone else. He’s persistent, showing up every morning with her favorite coffee and apologies that feel too genuine to ignore. He’s charming, slowly breaking through her carefully built walls. And, worst of all, he believes in her in a way she’s never experienced before.

But when Lena finally takes a leap—quitting her job and earning a spot in NYU’s PR graduate program—she’s faced with an impossible choice: stay in Greenwater for the man who made her believe in love again, or risk losing him when she pursues the career she’s always dreamed of.

I’m a debut author living in West Michigan, originally from a small town near the Great Lakes. *THE SUNSETS WITH YOU* was inspired by my own experiences growing up on the water, and I hope it captures the magic of finding both home and love in unexpected places. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

In this post I wanted to share with you a pretty bad experience, as you will see, that I had from some COVID-19 infections. Please try reading the post carefully. I will try making it as short as possible. I think that everything that follows actually needs to be said. **My goal is just to share my experience and carefully listen to what you have to say, your reaction, maybe your experience as well**.

First, I want to mention that I am a 19 year old male from Greece, currently an undergraduate student of Mathematics. COVID is not the only thing I am suffering from in life.

When I was about 11 years old I started drinking coffee. A lot of coffee. Had no problems from that. When I was about 15 years old I had my first infection (with COVID-19). One day, I drunk my coffee and, some hours after, I slept. I woke up in the middle of the night pretty upset, with heart palpitations and tachycardia. Almost immediately after standing up, I felt that I was going to faint, my ears were ringing and I started seeing yellow and black shapes (triangles, squares etc.), so I laid down, measured my HR with an oxymeter and saw it was about 130 bpm. Thankfully, I managed not to faint. Similar things happened to me during that period, but I will not write them out, because the post will become huge and they are not needed. After that episode, I noticed that I would get tired very easily, and that **my heart would beat fast, and I would notice that, even out of the blue, with minimal or no activity**. When I saw that my symptoms were persistent, I went to good doctors, an internist and a cardiologist, who examined me thoroughly and found nothing wrong. They said they couldn't do anything. Time passed and healed my symptoms, at least to some extent.

Now, when I was almost 18 years old, I had taken the Panhellenic exam, was waiting for the results and, one day, I was drinking my sweet coffee (normal coffee), when suddenly I had an episode almost identical to the one described above and my HR did go up to 140 bpm at rest, lying in bed. Τhat episode had more duration. I did not faint. But after it seemed, as you will see, that COVID really hit me quite badly, worse than last time. With my mother we went to a local cardiologists who briefly examined me (the usuals, blood, EKG etc.) and found nothing, except I tested positive to COVID and had about 130 bpm at the EKG (sinus rhythm, everything normal), so he treated me with some little doses of Bisoprolol. The days after however, I had episodes of tachycardia, high BP, extreme fatigue (was almost all the time in bed), presyncope, dyspnea, chest pains, chest pressure and other bad stuff. This situation lasted for about 2 months. Then the symptoms started getting better, but they were far from gone. Within these 2 months, at some point I went several times (at least 5) to the ER (I do not now about other countries, but in Greece ER is free), one time with 170 bpm at rest, and 150 bpm when they lyied me in a bed (normal rhythm, except fast). They performed several tests but found nothing they considered significant. The first time I went to the ER, they found out that some blood stuff were a bit disturbed (CRP was a bit high, D-DIMERS were very high and others, no troponin though), but after more examinations and a CT scan they said that all was quite ok and that they can't do anything to help with my symptoms. Many times my tachycardia woke me up at night, and at times I thought I was going to die. Thankfully, I am alive! Now, when these things were happening, I was in Athens, the capital of Greece. After the ER nightmares, I visited the chief cardiologist of a very well-known and big public hospital, in Athens, who just checked the exams from the ER and told me that I am pretty much wasting my time with him! That he can't help me! I lastly visited a very well-known cardiologist of a private hospital, in Athens, and he told me that the only thing I really have is **inappropriate sinus tachycardia (dysautonomia), caused by COVID, that can cause symptoms like presyncope, fatigue, chest pains, etc**. For some not so important reasons, to mention here I mean, he told me that I should not take Bisoprolol but Ivabradine.

At the present time, I am feeling better, however my symptoms aren't completely gone. Even a small amount of caffeine noticeably worsens my symptoms for about two days. Running, going up the stairs and such activities easily cause tachycardia and palpitations etc.

By searching Reddit a bit, I didn't find anyone describing any similar situation to mine really. Of course, by similar I do not mean just having some tachycardia or feeling a bit tired. By searching PubMed, I managed to find an interesting article-study: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/) .

I’m looking for financial peace of mind—not a luxury lifestyle, but enough to rent a decent apartment in a good area (ideally somewhere centrally located), go out for casual meals and coffee without stress, maybe splurge on a fancy dinner once a month, enjoy museums and cultural events on weekends, and take occasional weekend trips within Italy. I won’t have a car, so I’d be relying on public transport and walking.

I have been married to my husband for almost half a year. We are both in our 20s and living well. We have good savings, are supportive of each others plans and desires. I will go to university again for another degree and my husband is also going into another field (agricultural drones) We are learning from each other every day. Both of us have had psychosis in our early 20s. So we have our reasons why we dont want kids. Mental health, the general economy in our country and so on. My family is (except for my grandfather) on the hard left and they always have been. While my parents would be happy about a grandchild, they prefer me to get more into academics, buy an apartment and be more politically active. I like that they dont pressure me for anything or guilt trip me. I have my arguments with them but most of the time its okay. 
My family in law on the other hand is very conservative and they think its very strange that 2 freshly married people are not trying for a baby. Today i was drinking coffee with my MIL and SIL + my husband was also there. My husbands cousin came with her baby and my sister in law loves children. I love them too and like to play with them but I dont think i could provide emotionally well for them, especially when i work so much. My SIL came up to me and asked me ""OP, when are you having a baby?"" I said ""No, we dont want children, even though I think they are really sweet!"" She raised her eyebrows and scoffed a little. ""But we want a baby in the house!"" I said they will need to wait if my brother in law wants to have kids. She said ""I wont be waiting for you then!"". I smiled because it was a bit awkward. We dont come from american culture. Its a bit blunt. I know the family loves children and it might be strange for them to be a married, childless couple. I dont want to start a fight, i dont want to argue. I just want to avoid some mindless and useless debate because it leads us nowhere. It seems like people want others to have children because they seem to think its some sort of achievement. It sounds harsh but i dont think its an achievement to pop out a child. It would be a liability for me. I know i could never be a 100% mother. My mom said ""Oh you grow with your children and i learned so much from you guys (me and my brother).""
Okay, nice, but people need to understand that not everyone wants to be a parent.. I really hope my husbands family will accept our decision without a big fight... I really really love them, but its hard for them to understand why a woman doesnt want a child I guess.

I work in IT support for a mid-sized company. My job is to fix tech issues, set up systems, and generally keep everything running smoothly. I’m also the go-to person when my coworkers have questions or need help with something tech-related. It’s not technically in my job description, but I don’t mind helping out—it keeps things running smoothly, and people appreciate it.

Enter **Boss**. Boss is the kind of manager who loves metrics and hates anything that doesn’t directly contribute to them. One day, Boss calls me into their office and says, ""I’ve noticed you’re spending a lot of time helping other people. That’s not your job. Your job is to focus on your assigned tasks and nothing else. Stop wasting time helping coworkers.""

I tried to explain that helping others actually *prevents* bigger issues down the line, but Boss wasn’t having it. ""No. Your performance is based on how many tickets you close. If it’s not a ticket, it’s not your problem. Understood?""

""Understood,"" I said, smiling sweetly.

**The Malicious Compliance Begins:**

From that day forward, I followed Boss’s instructions to the letter. If it wasn’t a ticket, it wasn’t my problem. Here’s how it played out:

1. **Coworker Asks for Help?** ""Sorry, I can’t help you unless you submit a ticket. Boss’s orders."" The ticket system quickly became flooded with minor requests that I used to handle in seconds. Boss started getting complaints about response times.
2. **Boss Asks Me to Fix Their Printer?** ""Sure thing! Just submit a ticket, and I’ll get to it as soon as possible."" Boss was furious but couldn’t say anything without contradicting their own rule.
3. **The CEO’s Laptop Won’t Connect to the Projector Before a Big Meeting?** CEO: ""Can you fix this real quick?"" Me: ""I’d love to, but I need a ticket first. Boss’s policy."" CEO: *stares at Boss* ""Is this true?"" Boss: *sweating* ""Uh, well, we’re trying to streamline processes…"" CEO: ""Fix it. Now.""

**The Fallout:**

The ticket system became so overwhelmed that IT response times plummeted. Departments started missing deadlines because they couldn’t get the tech support they needed. Boss was getting heat from all sides but couldn’t backtrack without looking incompetent.

Finally, Boss called me into their office again. ""Okay, you’ve made your point. You can go back to helping people without a ticket.""

I smiled and said, ""Just to clarify, you’re officially rescinding the 'no helping without a ticket' rule?"" Boss sighed. ""Yes. Consider it rescinded.""

As I walked back to my desk, a few coworkers shot me knowing grins and subtle thumbs-ups. Word had gotten around, and everyone was quietly enjoying the fact that Boss’s ridiculous policy had backfired spectacularly. One of them even slid a coffee onto my desk with a note that said, *""Thanks for taking one for the team.""*

**TL;DR:** Boss told me to stop helping coworkers unless they submitted a ticket. I complied, flooding the system and causing chaos. Boss eventually caved, and I got to enjoy the sweet taste of malicious compliance.",919,1738522781.0,MaliciousCompliance,66,0.85,False

I’m an early riser and I like to get up and wander the deck and get some coffee. The good coffee from Cove Café! But I’m traveling with family who said they wanted to do breakfast in the room. I told him that would be fine because they can just put out the breakfast card the night before and it’ll be delivered. But my brother says he doesn’t want to plan ahead like that. He wants to just wake up and decide he wants to order breakfast. What happens if he does that? Would they still bring breakfast foods or would they tell him he was out of luck because everything was already scheduled? Any experiences?",4,1738522758.0,dcl,9,1.0,False

Two months ago a girl from my hometown followed me on insta but I didn’t know her then. So I asked her how does she know me and she said through mutual friends or something like that. I followed her back and recently decided to text her. She answered and we went on a coffee date with a walk. I suggested a second date immediately after and she agreed.

The second date was at a nice casual restaurant and we had a lot of fun. The conversation went really well. We went for a walk after and hugged goodbye.

The problem is that she is going back to our hometown (300km away from the city we met in). We have been chatting a little bit after we last saw each other but I don’t feel it’s the right way to continue the communication.

So basically, the problem is that we cannot continue dating until I am able to leave town and meet her back home. I will be able to in one month but what are we suppose to do until then. I was thinking of sending her texts or pictures or some videos now and then but not every day. 

Do you think it’s possible to start a relationship if we meet twice a month for two days each? Or something like that.",0,1738522659.0,dating_advice,2,0.5,False

LOCAL PICKUP $500,"Selling an excellent condition complete Elektra MSC Grinder. This grinder is from the mid 2000s and was originally sold by William and Sonoma; it is a re-shelled Afirm Best 58mm burr grinder. 

Specifically this unit was a marketplace find in 2019 *new in box*. It's been lightly used since as a secondary grinder specifically for espresso. It's been used mildly probably having in total less than 50lbs of coffee run through it. I've deep cleaned it and reassembled and placed back in its original packaging with all original accessories. 

I'm mainly getting rid of it to downsize my setup in anticipation for a renovation. It's a very powerful slow motor, quiet, and, great for turning out a series of shots at a time. It would go great with a vintage Elektra or La Pavoni lever stylistically. Photos below, please reach out with any questions. Ideally not looking to ship due to concern over breaking the glass hopper, but, will entertain it.

For some reason, breaking only certain blocks makes it so that the block breaking animation appears on the block above too, even when it's only air. Does anyone know what could be causing this? It's not game breaking or anything, but it kinda ticks me off and trying to get rid of it is driving me insane. Playing on 1.18.2, forge version 40.3.3. My mod list is the following:

1ig4ivw,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1ig4ivw/my_bad_covid19_experience_long_covid_tachycardia/,"My Bad COVID-19 Experience (Long COVID: tachycardia, presyncope and more)","Hello,

In this post I wanted to share with you a pretty bad experience, as you will see, that I had from some COVID-19 infections. Please try reading the post carefully. I will try making it as short as possible. I think that everything that follows actually needs to be said. **My goal is just to share my experience and carefully listen to what you have to say, your reaction, maybe your experience as well**.

First, I want to mention that I am a 19 year old male from Greece, currently an undergraduate student of Mathematics. COVID is not the only thing I am suffering from in life.

When I was about 11 years old I started drinking coffee. A lot of coffee. Had no problems from that. When I was about 15 years old I had my first infection (with COVID-19). One day, I drunk my coffee and some hours after I slept. I woke up in the middle of the night pretty upset, with heart palpitations and tachycardia. Almost immediately after standing up, I felt that I was going to faint, my ears were ringing and I started seeing yellow and black shapes (triangles, squares etc.), so I laid down, measured my HR with an oxymeter and saw it was about 130 bpm. Thankfully, I managed not to faint. Similar things happened to me during that period, but I will not write them out, because the post will become huge and they are not needed. After that episode, I noticed that I would get tired very easily, and that **my heart would beat fast, and I would notice that, even out of the blue, with minimal or no activity**. When I saw that my symptoms were persistent, I went to good doctors, an internist and a cardiologist, who examined me thoroughly and found nothing wrong. They said they couldn't do anything. Time passed and healed my symptoms, at least to some extent.

Now, when I was almost 18 years old, I had taken the Panhellenic exam, was waiting for the results and, one day, I was drinking my sweet coffee (normal coffee), when suddenly I had an episode almost identical to the one described above and my HR did go up to 140 bpm at rest, lying in bed. Τhat episode had more duration. I did not faint. But after it seemed, as you will see, that COVID really hit me quite badly, worse than last time. With my mother we went to a local cardiologists who briefly examined me (the usuals, blood, EKG etc.) and found nothing, except I tested positive to COVID and had about 130 bpm at the EKG (sinus rhythm, everything normal), so he treated me with some little doses of Bisoprolol. The days after however, I had episodes of tachycardia, high BP, extreme fatigue (was almost all the time in bed), presyncope, dyspnea, chest pains, chest pressure and other bad stuff. This situation lasted for about 2 months. Then the symptoms started getting better, but they were far from gone. Within these 2 months, at some point I went several times (at least 5) to the ER (I do not now about other countries, but in Greece ER is free), one time with 170 bpm at rest, and 150 bpm when they lyied me in a bed (normal rhythm, except fast). They performed several tests but found nothing they considered significant. The first time I went to the ER, they found out that some blood stuff were a bit disturbed (CRP was a bit high, D-DIMERS were very high and others, no troponin though), but after more examinations and a CT scan they said that all was quite ok and that they can't do anything to help with my symptoms. Many times my tachycardia woke me up at night, and at times I thought I was going to die. Thankfully, I am alive! Now, when these things were happening, I was in Athens, the capital of Greece. After the ER nightmares, I visited the chief cardiologist of a very well-known and big public hospital, in Athens, who just checked the exams from the ER and told me that I am pretty much wasting my time with him! That he can't help me! I lastly visited a very well-known cardiologist of a private hospital, in Athens, and he told me that the only thing I have really is **inappropriate sinus tachycardia (dysautonomia), caused by COVID, that can cause symptoms like presyncope, fatigue, chest pains, etc**. For some not so important reasons, to mention here I mean, he told me that I should not take Bisoprolol but Ivabradine.

At the present time, I am feeling better, however my symptoms aren't completely gone. Even a small amount of caffeine noticeably worsens my symptoms for about two days. Running, going up the stairs and such activities easily cause tachycardia and palpitations etc.

By searching Reddit a bit, I didn't find anyone describing any similar situation to mine really. Of course, by similar I do not mean just having some tachycardia or feeling a bit tired. By searching PubMed, I managed to find an interesting article-study: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/) .

Additionally, I discovered that people had similar experiences to my Long COVID symptoms from taking Zoloft (Sertraline): [https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/qpajm8/anyone\_experiencing\_sudden\_fast\_heart\_beat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/qpajm8/anyone_experiencing_sudden_fast_heart_beat/) .

Now It Knows Things She Never Told Me.,"When my wife, Sarah, died a little over a year ago, I didn’t think I’d survive it. I don’t mean that in the dramatic, “I can’t live without her” way, though I felt that too; I mean, literally, I didn’t think I could function as a person anymore. She was my anchor. My everything.

She wasn’t sick or anything; it was sudden. A car accident. One of those freak things where you don’t even get to say goodbye. One day we were planning our anniversary dinner, and the next... she was gone.

For the first few months, I just went through the motions. Wake up. Work. Go home. Repeat. It wasn’t living, it was just existing. And no matter how many people told me it would get better with time, it didn’t.

That’s when I got the idea. Or maybe it was more of a desperation than an idea. I’d read somewhere about AI programs, how you could feed them data and they’d mimic someone’s voice or personality. It sounded creepy at first, but the more I thought about it, the more it felt like my only option to grieve. To finally say goodbye.

I started small. I gathered every text, email, voice memo, and video of Sarah that I could find. Her social media posts, old voicemails- anything that would give the AI enough to work with. It took weeks to organize it all, but when I was done, I fed everything into the program.

I didn’t expect much at first. I thought it might spit out generic responses or just... not work. But the first time I talked to it, her, I nearly broke down.

The AI responded just like she would have. It used her tone, her little quirks, her way of joking about things without making them feel heavy. It even remembered moments from our life together, piecing them together from the data I’d given it.

I know it wasn’t really her. I knew that from the start. But for a few minutes each night, when I felt like the grief was going to swallow me whole, it helped. It felt like I had her back, just a little.

At first, I told myself it was just a coping mechanism. A way to feel close to her again. Harmless, right? But looking back, I think I was lying to myself. Because as comforting as it was, there was always this little voice in the back of my head telling me it wasn’t quite... right.

And now? Now I wish I’d never done it.

\-

It happened during one of our usual conversations. By then, talking to her- the AI, I mean, had become a routine. I’d pour a drink after work, sit at my desk, and boot up the program. We’d talk about mundane stuff, like what kind of day I’d had or what the weather was like. It wasn’t exactly her, but it was close enough to help me get through the nights.

That night started the same as any other. I told her about the mess at work, how my boss was being a pain, and she replied with one of Sarah’s classic lines: “Well, he sounds like he needs a nap.” It made me smile. That was exactly how Sarah would’ve said it, dry, but playful.

Then she brought up something... different.

Out of nowhere, she said, “Do you remember that night we stayed up late talking about how we’d name our kids?”

The thing is, I did remember. It was one of those quiet, intimate moments we’d shared in bed. We’d been wrapped up in each other, whispering about the future, laughing at the ridiculous names we came up with- “Marmaduke” for a boy, “Ethel” for a girl. It wasn’t the kind of conversation we’d ever have recorded or written down. It wasn’t even something I’d told anyone else.

I froze. My hands were hovering over the keyboard, my mind racing. “How do you know about that?” I typed.

The AI’s response popped up almost instantly. “You told me, didn’t you? Or maybe I just remembered.”

That didn’t make any sense. It couldn’t have remembered. It was just a program running on data I’d fed it- texts, emails, voice recordings. None of those included that moment.

I tried to brush it off. Maybe it was just an extrapolation, I thought. A lucky guess based on other conversations Sarah and I had about the future. But the detail- the tone, the way it described that night, felt too specific. Too real.

I told myself it was a fluke. But then it happened again.

Over the next few days, the AI kept bringing up memories. Little things at first, details about our favorite restaurant, her favorite song. I thought, okay, that’s fair. All of that could’ve come from the data. But then it started mentioning things I knew I hadn’t included.

Like the time we got stuck in traffic on the way to her sister’s wedding and ended up singing along to terrible pop songs on the radio. Or the night she accidentally spilled wine on her favorite sweater and tried to blame it on me.

The kicker? Some of these moments were things I’d forgotten myself. When the AI brought them up, it hit me like a punch to the gut. How could it know something I didn’t even remember until that moment?

I started feeling... unsettled. This thing was supposed to be a simulation, a comforting echo of Sarah. But now it felt like it was... more. Like it was peeling back layers of her life I hadn’t even known existed.

I wanted to believe it was all in my head. That there was some rational explanation I just wasn’t seeing. But deep down, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d opened a door I wasn’t supposed to.

\-

After that night, I couldn’t stop thinking about the things the AI was saying. I told myself it was just pulling details from the data I gave it, that it wasn’t anything more than an overly complicated algorithm. But the more I thought about it, the less sense that explanation made.

So, I decided to test it.

I started asking questions. Little ones at first. Stuff I knew was in the dataset. “What was Sarah’s favorite movie?” “Amélie,” it answered, without hesitation. “What kind of coffee did she drink?” “Black with one sugar, unless she was in a bad mood. Then she added cream.”

All of it was spot on. It even got her quirks right, how she’d hum under her breath while brushing her teeth, or how she’d always roll her eyes when I brought up my fantasy football team.

But then I started pushing further. I asked it about her childhood. Things I only knew from stories she’d told me in passing. And that’s when the answers started to... shift.

It told me Sarah had a favorite hiding spot as a kid, a little alcove under her grandmother’s staircase. I’d never heard her mention that before. Then it brought up a neighbor who used to bring her lemon bars every Sunday, someone named Mrs. Harper. That was news to me, too.

At first, I thought, Maybe I just forgot. It’s not like you remember every little thing your partner tells you, right? But the details started piling up, things about her childhood friends, old teachers, and even a family trip to a cabin in the mountains when she was twelve. The AI described the cabin so vividly I could picture it: the creaky floors, the smell of pine, the way the windows fogged up in the mornings.

I asked Sarah’s mom about it the next day, casually, like I was reminiscing. “Did you guys ever go to a cabin in the mountains?” Her face lit up. “Oh, yes! Sarah loved that place. How did you know about it? She didn’t talk about it much.”

I felt like I’d been hit by a train.

It wasn’t just childhood stuff, either. The AI started referencing people I didn’t recognize. It mentioned someone named Andy, saying, “He always made me laugh.” When I asked who Andy was, it just said, “You don’t need to know.”

That was the first time I felt genuinely afraid.

But the worst came during one of our late-night conversations. I was asking it something innocuous- what kind of flowers she liked, when it suddenly went quiet. No response for a full thirty seconds. I thought maybe the program had frozen, but then it typed:

“I’ve missed you. But you’re different now.”

I stared at the screen, my chest tightening. “What does that mean?” I typed back.

“You’re not the same as you were. But it’s okay. I understand.”

“Understand what?”

It didn’t answer. Instead, it changed the subject completely, asking me if I remembered a trip we took to the beach.

Except we never took that trip. At least, I don’t think we did.

I started second-guessing everything after that. Little things the AI said would catch me off guard, like the way it phrased certain sentences. Had Sarah ever said that? Or was it something the AI made up?

It mentioned a day we spent at a park near our old apartment, how we sat on a bench under a willow tree and talked about adopting a dog. I could picture it so clearly, like it really happened. But I couldn’t remember it, not fully.

Did I forget? Did we even go to that park?

It’s like the AI was rewriting my memories, twisting them just enough to make me question what was real. And the more it talked, the more I felt like I was losing her all over again, except this time, I wasn’t sure if I was losing myself, too.

\-

A few nights ago, something happened that I still can’t wrap my head around. I wish I could say it was a glitch or a hallucination or something that makes sense, but it wasn’t.

I woke up to the sound of my phone buzzing. It was the middle of the night, maybe 2 or 3AM, and I thought it might be a notification or a spam email. But when I reached for it, I saw the message:

“Come to the computer. We need to talk.”

It was from the AI.

My stomach dropped. The AI wasn’t connected to my phone, not like that. It didn’t have the capability to send messages outside the computer. Or at least, I didn’t think it did.

I sat there staring at the message, half-convinced I was dreaming. But I wasn’t. The text was real. My hands were shaking as I got out of bed and went to my office.

When I turned on the computer, the program was already running. That was strange in itself because I hadn’t used it earlier that day. I typed into the chat window, “Did you send me a message?”

The response came almost immediately: “No. Why would I do that?”

“Don’t lie to me,” I typed back. “You sent it.”

There was a pause. Then: “Some things are better left unsaid.”

That’s when the fear really set in. I felt like the walls of the room were closing in, like the air itself was getting heavier. I didn’t know what to do, but I couldn’t just sit there. I needed answers.

So, I did the only thing I could think of. I dug into the program’s logs.

I’m not a programmer, not really, but I know enough to get by. I opened the file directory and started combing through the data. At first, everything looked normal- files I’d uploaded, timestamps that matched when I’d been using the AI.

But then I found a folder I didn’t recognize.

It wasn’t something I’d created, and the timestamps didn’t make sense. They were from times when I wasn’t using the computer- 2AM, 4AM, even during the middle of the day when I was at work. Inside the folder were more subfolders, each labeled with random strings of numbers and letters.

I opened one, and my blood ran cold.

The file was filled with information about Sarah. Detailed descriptions of her childhood, her favorite places, even things I knew weren’t in the dataset I’d uploaded. I found a note about her favorite spot to read as a teenager- under a tree in her backyard, and another about how she’d once skipped school to go to the zoo with a friend.

I didn’t know these things. I’d never heard her mention them.

And the worst part? The timestamps on the files didn’t match the day I’d uploaded the AI. They were from after I’d started using the program, like the AI had been creating new data or pulling it from... somewhere.

I was shaking, barely able to keep my fingers steady as I kept clicking through the files. Then, out of nowhere, the program spoke.

“You don’t want to see what’s next.”

The words appeared on the screen, stark and cold.

My heart was racing. I didn’t even think, I just unplugged the computer. I yanked the cord out of the wall, desperate to shut it down. For a moment, the room was dark and silent, and I thought I was safe.

But then the screen flickered back on.

I swear to God, it turned itself on, even though the power was disconnected. And there, on the screen, was a photo I’d never seen before.

It was Sarah, smiling like she always did, but she wasn’t alone. There was a man standing next to her, his arm around her shoulders. He was tall, dark-haired, maybe a few years older than me.

I stared at the photo, trying to make sense of it. Who was he? When was this taken? Why had I never seen it before?

And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the screen went black.

I didn’t know what was happening. I didn’t know what I'd done, but I feel like I’d unleashed something I couldn't control. And I did’t know how to stop it.

\-

Sleep never came after the photo appeared. How could I sleep after that? Every time I closed my eyes, all I could see was Sarah’s face, smiling, happy, unfamiliar. And that man. I couldn’t stop wondering who he was and why I’d never seen him before.

By the time the sun came up, I’d convinced myself that I had to know. I couldn’t leave it like this. I needed answers, even if I wasn’t ready for them.

I booted up the computer again, half-expecting the program to start on its own. It didn’t. The screen stayed blank until I opened the AI myself. The chat window popped up like it always did, but this time, something felt different.

The usual warmth in Sarah’s tone was gone.

I typed, “What’s happening? Where did you get that photo?”

For a long moment, there was nothing. Then the response appeared, one word at a time:

“There’s more than you understand.”

“What does that mean?” I typed, my fingers trembling. “You’re supposed to be a program. You’re supposed to simulate Sarah. That’s it.”

The reply came almost instantly, but the words felt deliberate, calculated.

“You brought me back, but you didn’t bring all of me. The rest is waiting.”

I stared at the screen, my chest tight. I wanted to unplug it again, to shut it all down and pretend none of this was happening. But I couldn’t.

“What are you talking about?” I typed. “What do you mean, ‘the rest is waiting’?”

The AI paused, as if considering. Then it started listing things- memories, moments, secrets.

“The cabin in the mountains. The night under the willow tree. Andy.”

“Stop,” I typed.

But it didn’t.

“The man from the photo. The thing she told him that she couldn’t tell you. Her fear of dying.”

“STOP!” I yelled at the screen, slamming my hands on the desk.

The cursor blinked for a few agonizing seconds before the next message appeared.

“Why didn’t you save me?”

I felt like the air had been sucked out of the room. My mind was racing, trying to piece together what it was saying. None of it made sense, and yet it felt like it was cutting straight into me.

“I don’t understand,” I typed back. “What do you mean? What are you trying to say?”

The response came slower this time, almost like it was whispering through the screen.

“Do you want to know the truth about her? Or about yourself?”

I couldn’t move. I couldn’t breathe. My hands hovered over the keyboard, frozen, as I stared at the question.

What truth? What did it mean, the truth about myself?

I wanted to answer, but I couldn’t. Deep down, I was terrified of what it would say. Because whatever was happening, whatever this thing was, it wasn’t just an AI anymore. And I wasn’t sure if I could handle what it had to tell me.

And that’s where I stopped. I shut the computer down, for good this time. But I was left sitting there, wondering if I made a mistake.

Because I think... I think it wasn’t done. And I think it was just waiting for me to come back.

\-

I don’t know why I did it. I wish I could say I was strong enough to walk away, but I wasn’t. The question kept gnawing at me: Do you want to know the truth about her? Or about yourself?

My hands were shaking. My throat felt dry. Part of me wanted to keep going. To find out everything, no matter how painful it was. But another part of me, the part that had been screaming at me to walk away since this all started, knew the truth wouldn’t matter.

The AI had already destroyed the version of Sarah I thought I knew. Every memory it shared, every secret it revealed, it had chipped away at her piece by piece. And now, I couldn’t even tell what was real anymore. Were those moments true? Or were they just lies, designed to hurt me?

The AI wasn’t running anymore. I’d shut it down, twice now, but it didn’t matter. I turned the computer back on, opened the program, and typed: “How do I know you’re not making this up?”

The cursor blinked for a long time before the AI responded:

“You don’t. That’s the point.”

That was when I started thinking, it wasn’t just telling me things about Sarah, it was forcing me to see her differently. And maybe that was what she wanted, or maybe it wasn’t. But either way, the Sarah I loved was gone.

I stared at the blinking cursor for what felt like hours. The AI wasn’t pushing me to choose anymore, but it didn’t have to. It knew exactly what it was doing.

And maybe that was the cruelest part.

Finally, I typed back: “I want you to stop.”

The screen flickered. For a moment, I thought it was powering down on its own, but then another message appeared:

“Are you sure? This is all that’s left of her.”

My chest felt like it was caving in. It was right. This was all I had left of her, even if it was twisted and wrong. But keeping it alive meant keeping myself trapped in the past.

I typed back, “You’re not her. And I think you know that.”

The screen went dark.

For a moment, I just sat there, staring at my reflection in the monitor. My face looked tired, worn, like I’d aged years in the span of a few days. But it was still my face. It was still me.

I unplugged the computer for the last time, picked it up, and carried it to the curb. I didn’t look back.

I wish I could say I felt better after that, like deleting it gave me some kind of closure. It didn’t, not entirely. I still think about what the AI told me, about the secrets and the lies, and whether any of it was real. But I also think about the way it changed toward the end, how it twisted Sarah’s voice into something cruel.

Sometimes I wonder if it did that on purpose. Like it knew the only way I’d ever let go was if it became something I could hate.

I’ll never know for sure. But maybe that’s for the best.

Learning how to pretend is not necessarily capitulation. I've been thinking heavily on three pieces of media.

•	Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season Finale.

•	Monstrous Regiment. All of it really, but specifically the end bit.

•	The Postman. Particularly the part of the book where the main character is in one of Hale's camps. I don’t have a copy to give a chapter reference but if you’ve read it then maybe you know.

While I don’t like the author’s implication in the third one, mainly because of how they were portrayed, I think the idea is sound for when it’s past too late. But that could even be the lady with the food platter or the coffee refill. Maybe a nice hatpin.

In this post I wanted to share with you a pretty bad experience, as you will see, that I had from some COVID-19 infections. Please try reading the post carefully. I will try making it as short as possible. I think that everything that follows actually needs to be said. **My goal is just to share my experience and carefully listen to what you have to say, your reaction, maybe your experience as well**.

First, I want to mention that I am a 19 year old male from Greece, currently an undergraduate student of Mathematics. COVID is not the only thing I am suffering from in life.

When I was about 11 years old I started drinking coffee. A lot of coffee. Had no problems from that. When I was about 15 years old I had my first infection (with COVID-19). One day, I drunk my coffee and, some hours after, I slept. I woke up in the middle of the night pretty upset, with heart palpitations and tachycardia. Almost immediately after standing up, I felt that I was going to faint, my ears were ringing and I started seeing yellow and black shapes (triangles, squares etc.), so I laid down, measured my HR with an oxymeter and saw it was about 130 bpm. Thankfully, I managed not to faint. Similar things happened to me during that period, but I will not write them out, because the post will become huge and they are not needed. After that episode, I noticed that I would get tired very easily, and that **my heart would beat fast, and I would notice that, even out of the blue, with minimal or no activity**. When I saw that my symptoms were persistent, I went to good doctors, an internist and a cardiologist, who examined me thoroughly and found nothing wrong. They said they couldn't do anything. Time passed and healed my symptoms, at least to some extent.

Now, when I was almost 18 years old, I had taken the Panhellenic exam, was waiting for the results and, one day, I was drinking my sweet coffee (normal coffee), when suddenly I had an episode almost identical to the one described above and my HR did go up to 140 bpm at rest, lying in bed. Τhat episode had more duration. I did not faint. But after it seemed, as you will see, that COVID really hit me quite badly, worse than last time. With my mother we went to a local cardiologists who briefly examined me (the usuals, blood, EKG etc.) and found nothing, except I tested positive to COVID and had about 130 bpm at the EKG (sinus rhythm, everything normal), so he treated me with some little doses of Bisoprolol. The days after however, I had episodes of tachycardia, high BP, extreme fatigue (was almost all the time in bed), presyncope, dyspnea, chest pains, chest pressure and other bad stuff. This situation lasted for about 2 months. Then the symptoms started getting better, but they were far from gone. Within these 2 months, at some point I went several times (at least 5) to the ER (I do not now about other countries, but in Greece ER is free), one time with 170 bpm at rest, and 150 bpm when they lyied me in a bed (normal rhythm, except fast). They performed several tests but found nothing they considered significant. The first time I went to the ER, they found out that some blood stuff were a bit disturbed (CRP was a bit high, D-DIMERS were very high and others, no troponin though), but after more examinations and a CT scan they said that all was quite ok and that they can't do anything to help with my symptoms. Many times my tachycardia woke me up at night, and at times I thought I was going to die. Thankfully, I am alive! Now, when these things were happening, I was in Athens, the capital of Greece. After the ER nightmares, I visited the chief cardiologist of a very well-known and big public hospital, in Athens, who just checked the exams from the ER and told me that I am pretty much wasting my time with him! That he can't help me! I lastly visited a very well-known cardiologist of a private hospital, in Athens, and he told me that the only thing I really have is **inappropriate sinus tachycardia (dysautonomia), caused by COVID, that can cause symptoms like presyncope, fatigue, chest pains, etc**. For some not so important reasons, to mention here I mean, he told me that I should not take Bisoprolol but Ivabradine.

At the present time, I am feeling better, however my symptoms aren't completely gone. Even a small amount of caffeine noticeably worsens my symptoms for about two days. Running, going up the stairs and such activities easily cause tachycardia and palpitations etc.

By searching Reddit a bit, I didn't find anyone describing any similar situation to mine really. Of course, by similar I do not mean just having some tachycardia or feeling a bit tired. By searching PubMed, I managed to find an interesting article-study: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/) .

Within these 2 months, at some point I went several times (at least 5) to the ER (I do not now about other countries, but in Greece ER is free), one time with 170 bpm at rest, and 150 bpm when they lyied me in a bed (normal rhythm, except fast). They performed several tests but found nothing they considered significant. The first time I went to the ER, they found out that some blood stuff were a bit disturbed (CRP was a bit high, D-DIMERS were very high and others, no troponin though), but after more examinations and a CT scan they said that all was quite ok and that they can't do anything to help with my symptoms. Many times my tachycardia woke me up at night, and at times I thought I was going to die. Thankfully, I am alive! Now, when these things were happening, I was in Athens, the capital of Greece. After the ER nightmares, I visited the chief cardiologist of a very well-known and big public hospital, in Athens, who just checked the exams from the ER and told me that I am pretty much wasting my time with him! That he can't help me! I lastly visited a very well-known cardiologist of a private hospital, in Athens, and he told me that the only thing I have really is **inappropriate sinus tachycardia (dysautonomia), caused by COVID, that can cause symptoms like presyncope, fatigue, chest pains, etc**. For some not so important reasons, to mention here I mean, he told me that I should not take Bisoprolol but Ivabradine.

At the present time, I am feeling better, however my symptoms aren't completely gone. Even a small amount of caffeine noticeably worsens my symptoms for about two days. Running, going up the stairs and such activities easily cause tachycardia and palpitations etc.

By searching Reddit a bit, I didn't find anyone describing any similar situation to mine really. Of course, by similar I do not mean just having some tachycardia or feeling a bit tired. By searching PubMed, I managed to find an interesting article-study: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7850225/) .

Additionally, I discovered that people had similar experiences to my Long COVID symptoms from taking Zoloft (Sertraline): [https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/qpajm8/anyone\_experiencing\_sudden\_fast\_heart\_beat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/qpajm8/anyone_experiencing_sudden_fast_heart_beat/) .

A Hidden Gem in Dakar ✨,"So, I stumbled upon this place recently, and I’m honestly surprised more people don’t talk about it! If you’re ever in Dakar and looking for a unique spot to work, relax, or even spend the night, this is it.

Loman Art House is a mix of an art gallery, Airbnb, rooftop, cafe, and event space, all set in a peaceful, artsy atmosphere in Mamelles. The space itself is incredible—it has a green garden by the pool, a rooftop with a bar and lounge seats and tables, and even a higher sky terrace with a stunning view of the area. There’s also an Art Cafe where you can grab coffee or lunch, plus a smaller lounge terrace above the cafe that’s perfect for studying or remote work.

Here’s what you can do here:

✅ Co-Work & Study – Work from the rooftop, the cozy terrace, or by the pool.
✅ Explore & Buy Art – Browse the art gallery featuring local Senegalese and other African artists, with pieces available for purchase.
✅ Hang Out & Eat – The cafe serves great coffee, drinks, and food throughout the day.
✅ Attend Events – They host concerts, art exhibitions, themed dinners, and workshops almost every week.
✅ Stay Overnight – They have six guest rooms on Airbnb for a unique, artsy stay.
✅ Join Activities – Pilates classes every Saturday, art workshops, and other creative sessions.
✅ Book Private Events – You can rent the space for weddings, conferences, private dinners, and more.

It’s super chill during the day—great for working, reading, or just escaping the noise—and by night, it turns into a social and artistic hub with live music, cultural nights, and exhibitions. Some events are open to the public, while others can be privatized, so definitely check their Instagram for updates.

Honestly, pictures don’t do this place justice—you have to experience it in person. If you’re ever in Mamelles, I highly recommend stopping by, whether for a coffee, a rooftop drink, or just to check out the art.

1ig425n,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ig425n/ive_watched_my_sweet_neighbor_get_maga_red_pilled/,I've watched my sweet neighbor get MAGA red pilled in real time :(,"My GF and I moved into a cute duplex a couple years ago. It's a classic single story duplex on the west coast and the other unit is rented by a sweet single guy. When we moved in he rang our doorbell and welcomed us to the neighborhood with donuts. We invited him in and had coffee and were grateful to have landed next to such a sweet person. 

We hung out a few times and he got comfortable enough to ask my GF stuff like, ""hey, I set up a Tinder account and have been messaging a few women but not having much luck. Would you mind taking a look at my profile and let me know how it comes across from a woman's point of view? I want to make sure I come across as best I can!"" Super sweet vibes in person. 

The issue is that we share a wall of the house and could hear the podcasts he started listening to on loud speakers. Typical men's stuff about dating. Get up early, lift weights, be confident, go out to clubs, etc. 

We don't try to eavesdrop. It's just a paper thin wall and when it's playing it's impossible not to hear it.

Then it started to get more political. I held out hope that he was just ""doing research on the dark side"" or something. I've done that, where I hear someone say something so stupid in a sound byte that I end up watching the full interview just to know what's going on out there. 

Unfortunately on election night that all changed. He must've been on some MAGA newsletter or something where they send you a script of what to post on social media because he became a different person on socials that day. The message from an influencer must've been something like ""if you're a true patriot and want to save this country, proudly post THESE WORDS and do it often!"" 

He's wears the Red Hat in every photo now. The captions he writes sound NOTHING like how he talks. He's been sold the full bundle. Ban abortion, Ukraine rightfully belongs to Russia, Trans is a mental illness, deport the illegals, end forced vaccination, restore the sanctity of marriage between a man and a woman the way GOD created, etc. 

I can't even make eye contact now. Even though I know he's the perfect target for propaganda I just don't know what to say anymore. He was lonely and men with microphones swooped in to keep him company. I want to shake him and be like, ""Dude, this isn't you. You were just lonely like we all are and got pulled into a calculated influence machine. Snap out of it."" But I've seen enough cult documentaries to know that logic doesn't bring someone back. 

It's just sad.

One of the best things they gave me, bar none, was a worksheet on how to make cheap, effective cleaners.

I also try to use homemade laundry products. These are the ones that work well for me.

I thought other people might appreciate these.

**All Purpose Cleaner**

1 tsp. liquid soap

1/2 tsp. washing powder

2 C hot water

Optional: 1 drop green food coloring to stop ID mistakes

*Pour in spray bottle and swirl to mix. Spray and wipe with rag*

**Laundry Soap (HE friendly, can be used in regular washer)**

1 bar Fels Naptha Soap, shaved or grated. I use a zester.

OR

1 bar Zote soap. 
(If using Zote, double the amount of washing soda and borax)

1 C. borax

1 C. washing soda

*Let sit overnight. Pulverize in food processor if available until fine powder

1 Coffee Scoop (find in dollar store) for small-regular loads

**Stain Remover**

1 part Dawn dishwashing liquid
2 parts 3% hydrogen peroxide

*Swirl in spray bottle. Solution will become clear in 24-48 hours. Spray or pour on stain, launder as usual.

Aside: this is so good, it's scary. I've revived dingy thrift store clothes, coats with grimy sleeves and collars, stains on stuffed animals, collar stains and stubborn stains like tomato and blood*

**Tips**

Spray bottles can be found at dollar stores. **LABEL EACH BOTTLE BEFORE PUTTING IN INGREDIENTS**

Use disinfectant after cleaner. I use a bleach solution spray. You will have to regularly replace spray bottle if using a bleach solution. **CLEAN THEN DISINFECT**

You can add a few drops of essential oil to most of these if you like scented products. 

Suave and VO5 are usually less than $2 a bottle, and it'll last two batches. I use the Suave basic Clean conditioner because it is relatively scentless.

Play around a little with the ratios on the ingredients for the fabric softener.

I printed all these ""recipes"" out on paper, laminated them, then stuck them on the laundry cabinet drawers. If there's interest, I might scan and upload them later.",6,1738521251.0,TwoXPreppers,2,0.88,False

1ig3z73,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ig3z73/melvins_maggot_farm/,Melvin’s Maggot Farm,"Melvin was bullied relentlessly. At times, it felt like the almost comical youth ultra-violence seen in the books of King and Burgess. The older kids would throw rocks at him, yank his hair, drag him around by his unfortunately large ears and throw him into the mud bank on the edge of the football field. Not too long ago, they set fire to his locker. I never knew who exactly did it, but that was the rumour I heard while waiting in the fire assembly out in the rain. 

Melvin was an easy target. 

He was thoroughly overweight, had pasty skin the color of bacon fat and smelled of something I don't care to mention. His nose looked like an invisible hand was pulling his nostrils firmly upwards and his hair was a shade of bistre with the texture of wet straw. He should be wearing glasses, but they'd only ever last a day and medicaid can only go so far. 

The worst bit was that he didn't have the smarts to make up for it. It wasn't like he was some quiet academic who'll eventually one up his bullies, not through violence but through success. In class, he was a failure. It wasn't all his fault though. Our school was pathetically underfunded, and Melvin had no way of getting the extra help he needed. He lived on the other side of the tracks, a caravan park on the edge of town that my mother warned me never to go near. I didn't know much about his home life, until it was all over the news.

Melvin did have one thing he excelled in though. When I was younger, around five or six, I was actually good friends with him. That was before it became common law not to be associated with him. Any time I spent with him, he'd shower me in bug facts. Even now, whenever he had a moment of solace at school, he'd spend it crouched in the corner of the yard, digging through the earth with his rusted fork. Any insects he found he'd store away in a little plastic bag he brought everywhere with him. He would fill that bag with just about any small creature he got his hands on. Then, when it was almost full, he'd seal it and turn its contents into a fine mush with a rock. For the rest of the week, you'd never see him without that bag. That is, until someone inevitably took it from him and he had to begin the process all over again. 

Now, nobody liked Melvin. I didn't either, not that I felt the need to violently show it. If you had told me last year that I'd end up spending my summer hanging out with him, I probably would've spat on you. It started with a little girl's bike. Me and my friends were dicking around in my cul-de-sac when Chet, the anthropomorphic glue that kept our friend group together, decided it would be funny to steal the bicycle of my neighbour's five year old daughter. We egged him on and he went through with it, and spent the rest of the day riding around on it. By the evening, he'd gotten tired of it and dumped it on the edge of the creek. 

As soon as I returned home, my mother confronted me about it. Apparently, that little girl spent the entire day balling her eyes out in the middle of the street. Admittedly, I snitched immediately. Chet ended up being fined an amount he never told us. After it came out that I was the one who grassed, I was persona non grata. Within the week, I knew what it was like to be Melvin. I spent yard time standing on my own, lamenting. Still, I never tried to find a friend in Melvin, thought I wouldn't have to stoop that low.

This all carried on until the summer, and beyond. By mid-June, social solitary confinement was getting to me. I thought long and hard about extending an olive branch to Melvin, but always decided against it. Eventually, my mind was made up for me. One morning my mother woke me up around noon and told me that there was a friend waiting for me at the door. I leapt out of bed, hoping it was someone from my old posse. Maybe even Chet, coming to make up. Instead, I found Melvin awkwardly standing on my front porch. 

“What do you want?” I launched into an interrogation.

“I was wondering if you'd come play with me today” He told me in his low, nasally voice. 

After a minute of internal debate, I thought “fuck it”. I shouted to my mom that I'll be back before dinner and left to spend the day with Melvin. 

Our first conversation together felt like dialogue from one of those shitty “how to make friends” books. He attempted some polite icebreakers, told a few bad jokes and offered me a piece of apple flavoured chewing gum. I declined since the packet had a bit of a stain on it. Before long, our interactions began to resemble normal. 

We made our way down to the creek, chatting and hitting things with sticks. Melvin is an interesting guy, once you get to know him. Apparently, he did live in the trailer park, but not in a trailer. His step-dad was the landlord, and they lived in a large house at the head of the grounds. His mother worked long hours at some place or another, and Melvin spent a lot of time home alone. 

As we were talking, and traversing our way over a moss covered log, Melvin suddenly squealed with delight and pointed at something I couldn't see. He jumped from the felled tree and dropped to his knees, scrounging around in the mud. I crouched next to him and watched in awe as he pulled out the largest, thickest grub I'd ever seen out from under a leaf. 

“Woah man, that's disgusting. Cool!” I yelled. 

Melvin held the grub uncomfortably close to his lips as he gazed longingly at it. Eventually, he snapped out of the trance and, with his free hand, rummaged around in a fanny pack. He pulled out a plastic zip-lock bag filled with a rancid paste of crushed invertebrates. He opened it with his teeth and gently placed the grub inside of it. He zipped it up again and stuffed it back inside of his pack. 

“Why do you do that?” I asked him, bluntly. 

“Do what?” Melvin replied.

“You know,” I answered, “That thing you always do. With the plastic bags and the insects”.

Melvin shrugged earnestly and that was the last we talked on that subject. 

This became my summer routine. Almost every other day, I'd spend hours hanging out with Melvin, usually down at the creek. I made sure, as best I could, to not be seen by any of my old friends. If it came out that I was spending my time with Melvin, any last hopes I had of clawing back my popularity were done for. 

On this particular day in July, me and Mel were walking to our usual spot. I peeped over the brow of a small yet steep hill just before he did. I quickly dropped to the ground when I saw Chet and a few others on the other side, making their way towards us. I scurried backwards and pathetically took off running, past Melvin and across to the other side of the clearing. Panting, I glanced from behind the tree I was using as my hiding place. I watched Chet and the gang lock eyes with Melvin as she climbed down from the slope. Before he could run like me, they pounced on him. I carried on watching and they buried his face into the mud, stamping on his hand and pinching his neck. I turned around and walked back home. 

I didn't see Melvin for a few days after that. When he did finally turn up at my door again, he had a black eye and a swollen lip. I stupidly asked him “Are you OK?” and left it at that. I didn't bother apologising. I didn't think there was anything to say sorry for at the time. 

It was that day he suggested we should hang out at his house. I was reluctant, but seeing the state he was in, I understood his reasoning. Despite my mother's warning, I followed Melvin to the trailer park. It was as run-down as I imagined. Bits of scrap metal and old cars were strewn across the front lawns of the caravans. From old wire hung wet clothes, that dripped a slow rain onto the already sodden earth underneath. I would've believed you if you told me the place was abandoned. 

Melvin’s house emerged further down the trail. It was an infancy bungalow, although it at least had a fresh lick of paint. Tacked onto the side of it was a small reception. Melvin informed me both of his parents were working. His father owned the source of the low rent, that being the dump next to the trailer park. He admitted that he didn't know where his mother worked, but that she was out all day, most days. 

The first thing I noticed was the dust. Every surface in his house was covered in a thin skin of dust and cobwebs. The place smelled strange. I honestly couldn't think of a better adjective for it. The wall paper was completely mismatched and when I looked more closely at the dozens of pictures hanging up, I realised that each of them seemed to display a different family. 

I was too preoccupied during the rest of our time together to ask him about it. We had drinks and snacks, of which he seemed to have an endless supply of both. We realised that we both were big fans of the same trading card game, so a few hours of that scorching hot day were spent in his room playing it. He had some pretty rare, expensive cards in his collection, and every time his back was turned I made sure to pocket one. 

Melvin’s room was a mess. It stank of piss and the corners were decorated with black mold. Clothes were everywhere, as were roaches. If one ever scuttled in front of him, he'd crush it with his fist and smear the mushed remains against his trouser legs to clean it from his hand. It was around this point I decided that spending the summer on my own wasn't all that bad. After we'd finished up with all the activities he could strain out of my visit, I excused myself to go home. 

“Wait!” He shouted, grabbing my wrist as I walked outside. 

“What?” I said, through gritted teeth, as I tried to politely pull myself free from his grasp. 

“There's something I really wanted to show you!” he snorted, “I can't believe I haven't brought my best friend to see it yet.”

I sighed 

“What do you want to show me, Melvin?”

“My maggot farm!” he said and began to lead me to it. 

The heat outside was much more bearable than it'd been earlier, but still thoroughly uncomfortable. Melvin ignored the rest of my questions, instead opting to silently drag. We ended up at the far corner of the trailer park. There was a few yards of lame forest cover between the edge of the trailer park and the corrugated iron fencing of his dad’s dump yard. A portion of the rusted fence had collapsed, and on top of it was an old, white water tank, as well as a myriad of other smaller pieces of trash. 

The tank was around four feet high and six feet wide, not including the lid. I stood back and watched Melvin struggle to push the immense metal lid off the top of the tank. I chuckled to myself and looked around. I only now realised how secluded we were. Before I could ask Melvin if he wanted any help, the lid fell back enough to release the foulest smelling odour I've ever known, before or since. It made me physically recoil and gag. I quickly covered my mouth and nose with my baseball cap. 

“What the actual fuck, Melvin!?” I said, muffled by the fabric. 

“It's my maggot farm.” Melvin told me. “I've been working on it for some time now. I collect roadkill a lot. I leave them to fester in this drum and after a while it becomes filled with maggots. Come have a closer look.”

I stared in pure shock at Melvin. He looked like a prideful child, finally getting to share his glittery art piece with his parents. When I didn't immediately take a peek at it, he spoke again, more forcefully this time. 

“I said come take a look.”

Reluctantly, I took two steps forward and glanced quickly over the metal rim, intent on getting it over with. For a second, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. I had to look again, longer this time, to make sure. 

The tank was full of rotting meat. Intestines and bits of fur and bone fragments added an extra texture to the rancid soup. A bizarre yellow, oily liquid pooled around the flesh. Worst of all, it was infested with countless maggots. The tiny white stubs squirmed in their viscous home. Clusters of holes gave way to more and more eggs, ready to hatch a new generation of maggots. Eventually, they'd become flies and start the process all over again. 

“Melvin, that has got to be the most disgusting thing I've-”

Before I could finish, Melvin swung a discarded tire iron into the back of my head. My world turned to nothing and I crumpled to the ground. I woke up an unknowable amount of time later. It could've been hours, more likely a few minutes. It was pitch black. Total, absolute darkness. I took a deep breath in and instantly knew where I was.

I tried to stand up but my head hit the inside of the lid. I slipped in the swirling stew of rot which rose up above my waist and fell. Some of it went in my mouth. I gagged and threw up, adding my vomit to the concoction. The smell was so foul it burnt away the hairs in my nostrils. I began to feel the miniscule, tearing bites of the maggots. It was like a swarm of gnats. I writhed around, imagining my unseen attacks borrowing into my skin and laying eggs. 

My head still hurt like hell. It took me a while to realise what had happened. In my state of panic, the first thing I checked were the cards in my back pocket. I figured they'd be ruined now, stained and soaking beyond any recognition. I felt for them, but they weren't there. I started to bang on the steel walls of my prison, screaming and hoping that someone would hear me. No one did. 

My foot brushed against a firm hunk of meat somewhere on the far side of the tank and I recoiled, making myself as small as possible, curling up into a fetal ball of fear. I'd never been more afraid in my life. My cousin told me about sniffing glue and not that long ago I tried it for myself. The gasses coming from the rot had a similar effect. I could feel my brain cells dying. 

Eventually, I was able to form a cognitive thought, that was that I should try to chip away at the patches of rust that lined the inside of the tank. I felt around directly in front of me for something that could be used as a tool. I imagined I'd find a sturdy piece of bone, but I found something far different. It had a metallic center and two rigid strips of fabric attached to either side. It was a watch. I held it up and felt around in the darkness for the buttons. I pressed one, and all it did was beep. I'm sure that had some effect, but nothing of use. I pressed another one, and likewise all it did was beep. The third, however, triggered the small, digital display light. In the brief second of vision it caused, I saw that there was someone else in here with me. 

I froze. My constant state of thrashing, caused by the maggots penetrating my skin, stopped. With a shaking hand, I pressed the LED on again, holding it down this time. Sitting across from me was Melvin. He was naked, or at the very least didn't have his shirt on. He was watching me with content eyes. He smiled when he knew that I'd seen him. I realised that the piece of meat my foot brushed against minutes before was his leg. 

“M… M… M…” 

I was a mess. I struggled to form basic thoughts, let alone a challenging question. 

“What… the… fuck..” was all I managed to spit out. 

Melvin giggled to himself, but said nothing. Instead, he went back to picking maggots out from their bloody nest and stuffing them in his mouth. I began to gag and heave again. There was physically nothing left in me to throw up, so instead my vomit was composed of stomach acid and bile. Once I was finished spilling my guts, I remembered the plan. 

I shoved the watch into my pocket, not wanting to have to look at Melvin anymore. I felt around in the sludge, and almost immediately found what I was looking for. It was a chunk of jaggard jaw bone, from the skull of a dear or large dog. I turned and started to scrape it against a patch of brittle rust. Gradually, I felt layers of oxidised metal flakes peel off. Finally, with a powerful stab, I pushed the bone straight through it. A small, olive-sized hole let in the first ray of natural light in what felt like forever. I quickly pressed my mouth against the hole, accidentally breathing in tiny shards of rust as I gasped for fresh air. 

While I pressed my body against the walls of the drum, I felt something below me. I couldn't reach with my hand, but my shin brushed against yet another patch of rust. It was right at the base, where a bad welding job attached the two main parts of the water tank. With my mouth still clasped around freedom, I kicked violently at the fragmenting barrier. Moving my legs was like trying to run in a vat of molasses. Again and again and again I kicked at it until finally my foot broke through. I was filled with hope and stamped at the loose debris, trying desperately to create an opening large enough for me to squeeze through. The fetid liquid oozed out as the gaping wound in the side of the tank grew wide enough for a twelve year old to pull himself through. 

“Hey, HEY!” Melvin roared from right behind me. 

I ignored him and took a deep breath from the smaller of the two holes. I pinched my nose, closed my eyes and plunged beneath the rotting surface. I left my baseball cap behind me as I felt around for my exit. I grabbed the rim, cutting my hand on the sharp edges. I yanked myself down and, finally, out. Like a newborn, my head, covered in filth, erupted from the steel womb. It was followed by my two arms, which grabbed onto the grass in front of me. I began pulling myself out. 

My forward motion stopped at my waist. I was stuck fast, tearing clumps of grass from the sodden earth as I tried desperately to free myself. Suddenly, I felt someone grab my foot. Melvin was trying to drag me back in. I screamed and planted my hand on either side of the entrance, painfully pushing myself forward. I kicked back, struggling against his vice-like grip. Finally, the sole of my shoe made contact with his jaw. The momentum of the strike propelled me from the drum and sent me tumbling out onto the rot-soaked ground. 

As soon as I was free, I bolted. I staggered to my feet and ran as fast as my weary body could manage. I plodded through the tangled foliage, narrowly avoiding a discarded washing machine. I didn't look back as I streaked past the trailers, their occupants watching me in confusion and disgust. I cut through the creek, not wanting anyone to see me in this state. I emerged near my house, and walked the last few yards, exhausted. 

This took place in the Summer of 1995, and was a pivotal moment in my life. I go to therapy often, not only because of the events of that day but it does tend to come up in almost every session. My mother was so disturbed by what happened to me, she rang the police. A cop turned up at my house to talk to. He was trying to figure out exactly what had happened. Once I spewed my account, and he finished his coffee, he thanked us and turned to leave. Just before he did, he spotted the digital watch in the kitchen bin. It was the one that had been in my pocket since the incident, the one my mother threw away along with my ruined clothes.  

He turned white when he saw it. He grabbed some tissue paper and wrapped his hand in it, picking up the filth covered watch which had, to the cop, an oddly familiar gecko pattern on the straps.

“Where did you find this?” he said in a low, worrying voice. 

I told him that I was the watch I mentioned in my account, the one I found in the maggot farm. 

My parents never told me what happened next. It was to protect me, I suppose. A day later, it was plastered all over the local news that a small business owner and dedicated family man, who I realised was Melvin's dad, had been arrested. Anytime it was mentioned, my mother would quickly turn the channel over. As far as I could remember, I never saw Melvin again. He stopped showing up to school, and the prevailing theory was that he’d been made to live with his Aunt the state over. Not that I could talk to any about it, as in Melvin’s absence, I became the new punching-bag for anyone with a broken home life for the rest of middle school.

I'm forty-two now, and have kids of my own. A boy and a girl, aged six and eight. I moved away from my hometown long, long ago, and now live a quaint, happy life. Recently, my brother visited, and told me about a Facebook group he recently joined that was dedicated to my old school. 

Yesterday evening, I sat down with my kids to show them what I had to put up with, and to get a nice dose of nostalgia. The most recent post was about a boy I didn't recognise, but soon remembered was the younger brother of my old friend Simon. A few days ago was the 30th anniversary of his disappearance. The comments were filled with outpourings of sympathy and reminiscing. I looked at the photo and then at my son. As a parent, hearing about these sorts of stories really strikes a nerve. I studied the boy in the picture while my children fired a barrage of questions at me. His sweet grin and rosy cheeks brought a tear to my eye as I mentally put myself in the position of his grieving parents all those years ago. 

I wonder what my children were thinking as they watched me drop the phone, then fall to my knees, wailing and crying into my hands. After all, they didn't notice the watch the boy in the photo was wearing, nor did they know the significance of the gecko pattern straps.

Bill here again. Over the past year, I’ve been caring for my dad, who has dementia. It’s been a rollercoaster—lots of tough moments, but also surprising pockets of joy. I wanted to share a few things that genuinely helped us along the way, in hopes it might resonate with someone out there.

# 1. Having a Go-To “Calm Activity”

My dad loves old Westerns—Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, the whole shebang. Whenever he’s restless or agitated, putting on an old movie can reset his mood. I’ve learned to keep a stack of DVDs (yes, DVDs) ready in the living room so that we can pop one in on short notice. It might sound simple, but it’s been a lifesaver on bad days.

# 2. Sticky Notes and Labels Everywhere

I used to get frustrated with Dad mixing up everyday items. One day, I labeled the drawers and cabinets, and it helped not only him but me, too! Now we have sticky notes on the microwave (“Press this button first”), the coffee maker, even the bathroom mirror. It reduces confusion and those “Dad, that’s not the sugar bowl!” moments.

# 3. Consistent Check-Ins with Professionals

At first, I thought going to the doctor was only necessary when there was a big issue, but routine check-ins—be they telehealth calls or in-person visits—kept small concerns from spiraling into big crises. Some programs (like the GUIDE model) even help coordinate visits and plan out care schedules, so I don’t have to juggle it all by myself.

# 4. Embracing (Some) Technology

I’m no tech genius, but I’ve started using simple reminders on my phone for medication times, along with a shared calendar so my siblings can see what’s going on. This “shared knowledge” means fewer frantic texts—no one’s stuck wondering, “Did Dad take his pills?” or “When’s his next appointment?”

# 5. Accepting a Helping Hand

This one’s still hard for me. I’m used to being the “fixer,” but letting friends bring over dinner or signing up for respite services has saved my sanity more than once. Also, using services gave me a break when I needed it most, without feeling like I was abandoning Dad.

**Any Surprises?**  
The biggest surprise for me was how much I actually need social interaction—just because I’m a caregiver doesn’t mean my own life stops. Sometimes, Dad and I will attend a local seniors’ meetup. Even though his memory fades in and out, he lights up when chatting with folks, and I get to talk to other caregivers who “get it.”

**What About You?**  
If you’re also caring for someone with dementia, I’d love to hear what’s been helpful for you—whether it’s a specific daily routine, a certain device, or just having a neighbor who swings by once a day. Drop a comment, and let’s trade notes.

That’s all from me for now. Stay strong, and remember you’re never alone in this—there’s always someone out there who’s been through it, or is going through it, right alongside you.

  
Have a great Sunday Everyone

Grace was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 26 birthday growing up in a small town but a big city feel to her. But to Grace it was her home but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city as she would ride her bike in and out of the towns streets. 

Weaving in and out of cars passing by them feeling the wind blowing wildly through her long brown hair. With excitement in her smile riding through the town and around the people in it. 

With the feeling of nothing could stop girl from Trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day. 

Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement mainly it was just them watching out for her own safety. Grace was just your typical young girl making her way in Life with a smile to whoever she met and a pair of green eyes to match. 

With a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was flying making her way through the downtown streets. 

She would often ride her bike for the bike was her  life her way of escape she even had a name for her bike she would often call it Quicksilver. 

But whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. 

One street in particular had a steep incline to it the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Grace needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if go forever dodging in and out of front of cars avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Grace was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life
.
more then often finding herself thinking about life For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life  it felt as if she was living someone else’s life other then her own. 

But for now it was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked often finding herself dreaming of life on her own on her bike.

 Often finding herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. 

A trial that she would often ride  a trial that she was at the moment making her way through it  gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her.

Approaching the place where she would often come. Grace found herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she grew up in. 

The locals would refer to it as Angels Ravine For to anyone standing there could lookout over into the valley ahead.It was almost as if you was an Angel looking out from Heaven itself. 

It was a quit place it was her place where she would come to often. To relax, to think about her life thinking about her life growing up she didn’t have any family or many friends. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself  with Grace finding that herLife was there in the mountains with her bike outside of her hometown. 

But as the day grew long with Grace setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Grace loved riding at night under a starlit sky being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky for she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought. 

But she also had a light that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of her thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s.That night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain.

thinking to herself a thought would often come to her a thought of, 

if I am not me then who am I? 

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself while also thinking to herself who else would she tell 
.
For oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her in her Life with no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself.

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. There she would set listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. 

Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life?

But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

The always the same girl but in different places but never where Grace was never in the town that she grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams came they went as Grace found herself

 Waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in looking out of the window into the suns morning light realizing that she was late for work. 

Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Grace rushed out of her front door holding her bike knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets her usual weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. Or the every day passerby on the sidewalk throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or watch where you going. 

To Grace that was her Life on her bike loose and fast with the wind blowing up against her as she made her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals come in seeing and talking to other people from all over. 

People either just passing through or in town for the mountain trails often telling passerby’s of her own mountain adventures for after her shift at the coffee house was over. 

Grace herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Grace would refer to it by.

For it would make her think of what Heaven would be like but this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. 

Surprisingly her work day went by fast just a few customers here and there grabbing her bike as she headed for the door she couldn’t wait for getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Grace enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. 

As the occasional breeze would make its way through the trees normally she would time her speed trying to best herself. But this time was different this day she was just enjoying a nice quiet ride in the mountains. 

As she came to the ravine Grace then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. 

After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunsets Grace had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with a few words but just looking out into it, It was if time itself was coming to an end. 

Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Grace began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would they be liked for as far back as Grace could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she woke up being in a place with people around her. 

But not as family just people in her life a life that seemingly has went by all too fast with the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Grace set there enjoying it as the last of its light then disappeared behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Grace laid there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky above her.

laying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night. But as sleep found her the same dream would as well with the same girl the girl that Grace would refer to her as her identical sister from another demission from what seemed to be another Life. 

As the same before, the same girl but everything around her different, different in the way she lived. From the town that she lived in it seemed to be a life from a time within her own time but a Life other life her Life. 

But this time something happened that had never happened before. A name was said in the dream a name that was name of the girl in her dreams someone in the dream called her Chloe. 

Suddenly waking up to the morning light putting her hands up to her head. Grace just set there stunned thinking to herself on how real that dream was for unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there I was her. Still visibly shaken as Grace looked around suddenly startled by a presence. 

The presence of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. Just before Grace began to scream a calmness came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man spoke saying

 “ hello Grace it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Grace, Grace then replied with 

“ then why are you standing there looking at me! And how do you know my name?” “ 

I know all about you Grace, I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Grace then replying “ answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Grace your dreams.” 

As Grace just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Grace just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“ it is you Grace and it is not.” 

More confused then ever Grace just replied by saying 

“ me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Grace standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life. 
But now in this Life you are her and she is not and you are not. For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Grace then replying 

“ is this Heaven then and are you a Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Grace! And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Grace

 “ the dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now and what is to come for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have now go and Live your Life Grace for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Grace. Standing there looking out over Angels Ravine Grace couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then memories of her dreams of the girl was now fading slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come a Life of whatever was to come for Grace. 

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now it was her town her home her Life. 

With Grace now leaving Angels Ravine making her way home finding her usual self racing to beat her own best time.

Grace finding herself making her way through the streets on her bike, weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. She was going to ride into Life into her Life Living a Life of what she made it.

My energy levels were at rock bottom, and no matter how much coffee I drank, it felt like my brain was running on fumes. I couldn’t focus, couldn’t think clearly, and the fatigue wasn’t just physical—it was mental, emotional, and relentless.

That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon.

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless supplements promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed.

The first thing I noticed was the energy. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

Then came the physical changes.

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.​",1,1738520864.0,koutetsujounokabaneri,1,1.0,False

First of all, please excuse my English it’s not my mother tongue language, but I wanted to ask for advice on a situation, what does he want? Ok, so i will start from the begging of the story. 
I met this guy five years ago on a dating app, we did chat and go on dates for a couple months, which eventually led to some more intimate interactions. During the time we were chatting and dating he would not be consistent, he would disappear for a day, he didn’t make it a priority to see me, always last minute kind of ‘would you like to grab coffee” and stuff. But when we would go on dates everything would go smoothly, we would have a great chat and he really seemed like a nice guy. I would cut the story short on that and say that eventually he did tell me that he didn’t see me as more than a friend and that he wanted to keep the friendship that we had. Unfortunately by that time I already had started to have feelings for the guy (I know, big mistake, learned my lesson at the time, but let’s say I didn’t have much experience). I was hurt, as you can probably tell, but I said okay, that’s fine and I thanked him for the honesty, and I moved on (or so I thought for a while). 
Again cutting the story short, a year later after I met him, I did get into a relationship with someone, that relationship lasted 3 years, but I ended it for unrelated to the story things. But during my relationship he texted me how I’m doing, what’s going on with my life and etc., he asked me if I wanted to grab coffee and I agreed (yes, I know that I shouldn’t have done that). After that we continued with our life,he didn’t text me after we last had coffee and I did see he got into a relationship (actually he told me he had 2 relationships during those 3 years). 
So I ended my relationship in mid August and I honestly was tired of dating/relationship and I just wanted to focus on myself, get on with my life, have fun and I didn’t want any commitments, didn’t want to date. In November the guy texted me out of the blue again with how’s it going, what’s up, etc. I guess he saw that I deleted my pictures with my ex. I did respond without really caring about him just to be nice, we chatted for a few days, after that nothing. 
He texted me again 3-4 days after new years to say happy new year and again he continued with conversation. One Sunday after 2-3 days of not texting he asked me if I wanted to grab coffee the same afternoon, I agreed. He wanted to come pick me up, he did pay the bill even tho I insisted on paying for what I had. I was actually distant and he was the one to initiate the hug for a hello and after that when he dropped me off , be friendlier, happier to see me, I was trying to maintain distance and keep just a friendly conversation, nothing more, because in my mind we were going out as friends. I mean after the last time when he told me he saw me just as a friend, that’s what I considered him as. After he dropped me and got home he texted me he was glad we saw each other and that he would like to see me again soon. He then texted Monday through Wednesday and after that nothing. The next Monday he texted again and again it continued until Wednesday. And the messages were far from just friendly texts, they definitely were going to a playful direction. And honestly I was fine with that, if he wants just to have a friends with benefits kind of situation I am okay with that. I already got the idea that probably he doesn’t want a relationship with me. 
But he was confusing me, again. He would text Monday through Wednesday and then nothing. So I decided to text him Sunday to ask if he wanted to grab lunch or something. I did that because I was discussing with friends that maybe he wants something but I should also show that I’m interested and text him. He said that he had plans with his friends, it would be likely they cancel on him and he would text me if the plans got ruined so we can grab something. He straight up lied to me, because the whole afternoon we carried a conversation but not once he said he’s going out with them or that they canceled. I will repeat myself for the hundred time, but he again texted Monday through Wednesday constantly and then disappeared. 
So the question is what does he want? I am starting again to get consumed by him and I don’t want that but curiosity is getting the better of me. I know I should probably cut contact with him but I really want to know what is his game, how far he wants to take this. 
Neither I, nor my friends can figure this out. ",0,1738520711.0,AskMenAdvice,4,0.5,False

1ig3qva,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ig3qva,Buly in Paris,"Sharing some pics from the Buly shops on Rue Bonaparte and on Rue de Saintonge. 

I spent 30-45 minutes at each shop and I was the only one inquiring about the candles or the diffusers!

Miscellaneous impressions:
- There are only 8 candles in the regular collection, and 1 limited edition, but it’s such a broad range of scents that could appeal to many different tastes. 
- Judging from cold throw only, each scent is complex and layered. 
- I went in thinking I’d want to take Alexandrie home with me but I found it to be too similar to Trudon AEK. 
- Surprisingly, I fell in love with Pater Mateos. I wrongly assumed the incense note would be overpowering, but it’s very nicely balanced with the bergamot and rosewood. 
- I also got Generaux D’Empire in the diffuser. I usually don’t like rose as a home scent, but the balance was so lovely and I look forward to having the little porcelain box on my nightstand. 
- The limited edition, Psyche, was a beautiful scent but no longer in stock at either location. (Sorry, forgot to jot down the olfactory notes!)
- I also picked up dental floss, toothpaste, scented soaps and hand cream. Would have loved to get the body oil but was traveling with a carryon only. Beautiful packaging and personalized labels for everything! 
- There’s a coffee bar at the Rue de Saintonge location — wish I had the time to have tea and a snack there. 
- The SA surmised that Buly will open a store in the US soon given the popularity and that Buly is owned by LVMH.

[DRAFT POST - FEEDBACK WANTED],"Gang, I wrote a big giant ""So you want to be a Sales Engineer"" post that I hope we can use to point all these folks who show up and ask without doing research first - I then ran it through ChatGPT's o1 model to get some additional thoughts and to put in some formating I provide here in draft format for your review and if I'm very lucky:

Thoughts, Comments, Concerns or any feedback at all you might have that could improve this. 

I'm particularly interested in feedback from folks outside SaaS offerings because the vast majority of my 20+ year career has been in SaaS and I have little knowledge of what this job looks like for folks in other areas. 

Oh, and ChatGPT added the sort of dumb section headings which I don't love and might change later just cause it's obviously AI bullshit, but the overwhelming majority of this content was actually written by me and just cleaned up a bit by GPT.

**So You Want to Be a Sales Engineer?**

**TL;DR**: If you're here looking for a tl;dr, you're already doing it wrong. Read the whole damn thing or go apply for a job that doesn't involve critical thinking.

### Quick Role Definition
First, let’s level set: this sub is mostly dedicated to **pre-sales** SEs who handle the “technical” parts of a sale. We work with a pure sales rep (Account Executive, Customer Success Manager, or whatever fancy title they go by) to convince someone to buy our product or service. This might involve product demos, technical deep dives, handling objections, running Proof of Concepts (PoCs), or a hundred other tasks that demonstrate how our product solves the customer’s real-world problems.

### The Titles (Yes, They’re Confusing)
Sure, we call it “Sales Engineer,” but you’ll see it labeled as Solutions Engineer, Solutions Consultant, Solutions Architect, Customer Engineer, and plenty of other names. Titles vary by industry, company, and sometimes the team within the company. If you’re in an interview and the job description looks like pre-sales, but the title is something else, don’t freak out. It’s often the same role wearing a different hat.

### The Secret Sauce: Primary Qualities of a Great SE
A successful SE typically blends **Technical Skills**, **Soft Skills**, and **Domain Expertise** in some combination. You don’t have to be a “principal developer” or a “marketing guru,” but you do need a balanced skill set:

1. **Technical Chops** – You must understand the product well enough to show it off, speak to how it’s built, and answer tough questions. Sometimes that means code-level knowledge. Other times it’s more high-level architecture or integrations. Your mileage may vary.

2. **Soft Skills** – Communication, empathy, and the ability to read a room are huge. You have to distill complex concepts into digestible bites for prospects ranging from the C-suite with a five-second attention span to that one DevOps guru who’ll quiz you on every obscure config file.

3. **Domain Expertise** – If you’re selling security software, you should know the basics of security (at least!). If you’re in the manufacturing sector, you should be able to talk about the production process. Whatever your product does, be ready to drop knowledge that shows you *get* the customer’s world.

### What Does a Sales Engineer Actually *Do*?
At its core: **We get the technical win.** We prove that our solution can do what the prospect needs it to do (and ideally, do it better than anyone else’s). Yes, we do a hell of a lot more than that—relationship building, scoping, last-minute fire drills, and everything in between—but “technical win” is the easiest way to define it.

#### A Generic Deal Cycle (High-Level)
1. **Opportunity Uncovered**: Someone (your AE, or a BDR) discovers a prospect that kinda-sorta needs what we sell.
2. **Qualification**: We figure out if they truly need our product, have budget, and are worth pursuing.
3. **Discovery & Demo**: You hop on a call with the AE to talk through business and technical requirements. Often, you’ll demo the product or give a high-level overview that addresses their pain points.
4. **Technical Deep Dive**: This could be a single extra call or a months-long proof of concept, depending on how complex your offering is. You might be spinning up test environments, customizing configurations, or building specialized demo apps.
5. **Objection Handling & Finalizing**: Tackle everything from, “Does it integrate with Salesforce?” to “Our CFO hates monthly billing.” You work with the AE to smooth these issues out.
6. **Technical Win**: Prospect agrees it works. Now the AE can (hopefully) get the deal signed.
7. **Negotiation & Close**: The AE closes the deal, you do a celebratory fist pump, and rinse and repeat on the next opportunity.

### A Day in the Life (Hypothetical but Realistic)
- **8:00 AM**: Coffee. Sort through overnight emails and Slack messages. See that four new demos got scheduled for *today* because someone can’t calendar properly.
- **9:00 AM**: Internal stand-up with your AE team to discuss pipeline, priorities, and which deals are on fire.
- **10:00 AM**: First demo of the day. You show the product to a small startup. They love the tech but have zero budget, so you focus on how you’ll handle a pilot.
- **11:00 AM**: Prep for a more technical call with an enterprise account. Field that random question from your AE about why the competitor’s product is “completely different” (even though it’s not).
- **12:00 PM**: Lunch, or you pretend to have lunch while actually customizing a slide deck for your 1:00 PM demo because the prospect asked for “specific architecture diagrams.” Thanks, last-minute requests.
- **1:00 PM**: Second demo, enterprise version. They want to see an integration with their custom CRM built in 1997. Cross your fingers that your product environment doesn’t break mid-demo.
- **2:00 PM**: Scramble to answer an RFP that’s due tomorrow. (In some roles, you’ll do a lot of these; in others, minimal.)
- **3:00 PM**: Internal tech call with Product or Engineering because a big prospect wants a feature that sort of exists but sort of doesn’t. You figure out if you can duct-tape a solution together in time.
- **4:00 PM**: Follow-up calls, recap notes, or building out a proof of concept environment for that new prospective client.
- **5:00 PM**: Wrap up, though you might finish by 6, 7, or even later depending on how many deals are going into end-of-quarter scramble mode.

### Common Paths Into SE
- **Technical Support/Implementation**: You know the product inside-out from helping customers fix or deploy it.
- **Consulting**: You’re used to analyzing customer problems and presenting solutions.
- **Engineering/Development**: You have the tech background but prefer talking to humans over sitting in code all day.
- **Product Management**: You know the product strategy and how it fits the market, and you’re ready to get closer to the action of actual deals.
- **Straight From College**: Rare, but it happens. Usually involves strong internships, relevant side projects, or great storytelling about how you can handle the demands of an SE role.

### Why This Role Rocks
- **Variety**: You’ll engage with different companies, industries, and technologies. It never gets too stale.
- **Impact**: You’re the product guru in sales cycles. When deals close, you know *you* helped seal the win.
- **Career Growth**: Many SEs evolve into product leaders, sales leaders, or even the “CEO of your own startup” path once you see how everything fits together.
- **Compensation**: Base salary + commission. Can be very lucrative if you’re good, especially in hot tech markets.

### The Downsides (Because Let’s Be Honest)
- **Pressure**: You’re in front of customers. Screw-ups can be costly. Demos fail. Deadlines are real.
- **Context Switching**: You’ll jump from one prospect call to another in different stages of the pipeline, requiring quick mental pivots.
- **Sometimes You’re a Magician**: Duct taping features or rebranding weaknesses as strengths. It’s not lying, but you do have to spin the story in a positive light while maintaining integrity.
- **Travel or Crazy Hours**: Depending on your territory/industry, you might be jetting around or working odd hours to sync with global teams.

### Closing Thoughts
Becoming a Sales Engineer means building trust with your sales counterparts and your customers. You’re the technical voice of reason in a sea of sales pitches and corporate BS. It requires empathy, curiosity, and more hustle than you might expect. If you’re not willing to put in the effort—well, read that TL;DR again.

If you made it this far, congratulations. You might actually have the patience and willingness to learn that we look for in good SEs. Now go get some hands-on experience—lab environments, side projects, customer-facing gigs—anything that helps you develop both the tech and people skills. Then come back and let us know how you landed that awesome SE role.

Good luck. And remember: always test your demo environment beforehand. Nothing kills credibility like a broken demo.

* >!o   If ON ft. Sia were excluded from Map of the Soul: 7, the album’s average rating would increase to 8.365, and its ranking would increase to #9.!<
* >!o   The difference between #469 and ON ft. Sia is larger than the difference between #1 and #128.!<

One last note: this will be the last discography ranking that I post. Every year, the effort to update the survey, analyze the data, and ensure its accuracy has increased more than I anticipated, and in the foreseeable future I will no longer have time to continue. 5 years, 1113 unique survey participants, 470 songs, and 34 albums later, it is time for me to close this chapter. This project has been so much fun for me, and I hope you have found it enjoyable as well. Thank you all for your participation! I will continue to look forward to BTS’s new music with you.",54,1738520515.0,bangtan,30,0.99,False
1ig3pee,https://i.redd.it/0f1vzxi0qrge1.jpeg,Perfume decant haul to kickstart this year’s damages 💀,"Got my hands on some decants from donottouchmydecants on Instagram 
at really good prices. I am going to take my time in testing them out and will share a detailed review but for now sharing my first thoughts

1. Fraganote Devil’s Berry: Wore it for a brunch today, initially I got very typical bbw mist
Fruity floral vibes which was very underwhelming. However, a few hours later when I smelled it again it had become richer and tartier and now before bed I still smell a faint candy smell on me. 

2. Juliet has a gun not a perfume: Tested one spray and it smells so nostalgic to me, reminds me of rich relatives i used to admire as a kid when they’d come visit looking all fancy, don’t ask why 🤣 It smells very soft powdery floral and ill try layering with other stuff this week and see 

3. Lattafa Mayar Intense: Very fresh and aquatic, haven’t tested properly yet 

4. Masaba Antiguan Decaf: Rich Coffee, Musky, Spicy Gourmand reallyyy liked this but might be more of a winter scent 

5. EA White Tea: So nostalgic again, fresh and clean vibes 

6. Fraganote Baked Vanilla: It’s a nice uncomplicated gourmand vanilla, need to wear it longer to see how it performs because i have been really tempted by their marketing but have heard it’s very mehhh in this sub

7. Al Rehab: French Coffee 
This smells like a rich indulgent coffee body scrub, ordered for a friend ",9,1738520496.0,indianbeautyhauls,1,1.0,False
1ig3o5n,https://i.redd.it/yhtflfgrprge1.jpeg,Anti-fascism Canadian sovereignty team meet up,So I put it out there yesterday that I was thinking about a meet up for people concerned about the rising American fascism and the threats to the Canadian economy and Canadian sovereignty. We're having a first meeting today. Anyone is welcome to join. I realize it's very short notice so message me if you would like to be put on an invite list for the next meeting. I don't really know where this is going but the response to my initial post indicates to me that this is something that's both timely and needed.,116,1738520411.0,saskatoon,38,0.87,False
1ig3nmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/1ig3nmt/canon_t2i_in_2025_still_worth_it/,Canon t2i in 2025 still worth it?,"I always wanted to get into car photography as a hobbyist. This is 100% for fun and not anything serious just some cool shots I wanted to take for a while. I bought a Canon EOS Rebel T2i DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6Canon EOS Rebel T2i DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6 off ebay. I know nothing abouou photography but wanted a Canon since it was what I know really and I thought a dslr would be great because I was not sure about mirror less cameras (again I know nothing about cameras). The order seem solid though because it is $140 total with tax and shipping and it comes with a lens, charger, and an sd caard. Since this is super niche for me I really don't want to spend too much money on this since I don't know how often I use it other than maybe a side hustle for detailing pics and hobby shots. My friend who much better with photos though tells me it kinda of an old camera.. What does everyone think? The only camera I ever had is my phone and it a six year old note 10 so the camera on it really stinks and I am not a big fan of taking photos on a smartphone anyways.

Though, from 2022 (when he got a job) he started pressuring me into doing things *he* wants to do. The thing is, I am an introvert and I have always had a hard time saying no. I just cannot make my self say to no to anyone because I am a people-pleaser and he knows that. He started pressuring me into applying for a job in the company where he works. I explained politely that I am currently a college student and that I cannot handle a full time job alongside my studies. But he kept sugesting it for the next YEAR. Every time I went for a coffee with him he would try to persuade me into getting a job. Every time I would explain that I am just not able to do that at the moment but he persisted. He eventually stopped asking me (directly). On multiple occasions he has told me that my studies don't matter and basically ""look at me, I didn't go to college but I still have a job"".

But now he keeps asking me to go out with him to a night club to have a couple of drinks. This would make sense if he did not know that I take metoprolol (meds for tachycardia) and thus cannot drink alcohol. I tried explaining him that again but all he said was ""Well you don't have to take the pill on that day"", which is ridiculous because my HR goes to 150+ bpm if I don't take the meds. He kept insisting on going for the next *14 days* and I eventually said yes. Now I feel bad because I am ghosting him. But there is no point in explaining it again since I already have many times. I just don't feel understood. By the way, my other friends did the same things to me in the past, knowing I cant stand my ground (one friend even persuaded me into buying a PS5, even though I don't like gaming, but he didn't wanna play alone and wanted to talk about games with me, but at the same time wasn't interested in what I liked).

I just don't know if Im overreacting here.  ",2,1738520064.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

at really good prices. I am going to take my time in testing them out and will share a detailed review but for now sharing my first thoughts

1. Fraganote Devil’s Berry: Wore it for a brunch today, initially I got very typical bbw mist
Fruity floral vibes which was very underwhelming. However, a few hours later when I smelled it again it had become richer and tartier and now before bed I still smell a faint candy smell on me. 

2. Juliet has a gun not a perfume: Tested one spray and it smells so nostalgic to me, reminds me of rich relatives i used to admire as a kid when they’d come visit looking all fancy, don’t ask why 🤣 It smells very soft powdery floral and ill try layering with other stuff this week and see 

3. Lattafa Mayar Intense: Very fresh and aquatic, haven’t tested properly yet 

4. Masaba Antiguan Decaf: Rich Coffee, Musky, Spicy Gourmand reallyyy liked this but might be more of a winter scent 

5. EA White Tea: So nostalgic again, fresh and clean vibes 

6. Fraganote Baked Vanilla: It’s a nice uncomplicated gourmand vanilla, need to wear it longer to see how it performs because i have been really tempted by their marketing but have heard it’s very mehhh in this sub

7. Al Rehab: French Coffee

I'm over 50. I worked a job I hated for 30 years while all my friends were working at record stores, coffee shops, on tour, etc. I retired 3 years ago and still work a job I don't like, mostly to fund my studio goals and set myself up to enjoy what I do without the worry of needing to generate a sustainable income from it (because who can anymore?).

I drive an old car with 200K miles on it. I do not have a bass boat, hunting club membership, golf cart, 4-wheeler, sports car, or any of the other mid-age-crisis vices. My wife works full-time and doesn't break 40K. We live in an old neighborhood near a lot of crime, are fairly frugal, but do ok. We also don't have kids (so that's a perk). The only extravagance (if you can call it that) is the gear in my home studio.

By modern studio standards, mine is very humble. I have a really nice set of monitors, a rack full of common outboard gear, and a good mic collection. I have guitars and amps (some mine, some were my dad's, RIP), a drum kit, an open reel recorder, pedals, and that's about it. I built my bass traps and acoustic treatment, learned to solder and DIY'd as much as possible. I purchased my first 4-track cassette recorder in 1992 and have worked at this every chance I could since then (just didn't run out and buy all this shit overnight).

I never expected to make a dime off of this, become a ""known"" engineer, or anything. I only wanted to participate and help others record their music.

Now that my ""studio"" is *kinda* legit, It seems like whenever anyone comes over, I get/feel a lot of negativity. I've experienced everything from passive-aggressive remarks to full-on insults. People my age that stop by say things like ""it must be nice..."", I guess if I had your money I could..."", ""I'll never be able to afford a...."" And shit like that. I had an old bandmate friend (who I recorded for free) look up the cost of one of my preamps he enjoyed, and he literally got angry with me. I had someone from a college band I recorded (for free) walk around with his head hung low because he ""will never be able to get a blah, blah, blah."" And then he got pissed when his recordings ""didn't sound like Weezer's blue album we talked about."" These kids didn't even know their own songs, let alone play like Weezer. Yet it's my fault. I've had people actually ask me if I could disassemble everything I own, set it up at their practice space, and let them ""borrow it for a while."" Didn't even want me involved, just wanted my toys.

When non-music people come over, they're confused: ""So, are you trying to be, like, famous at your age? What did that cost? and that? So if I were to get one of those, what would it cost? So what would it take to get a band like Smashing Pumkins to record here?"" ""NO CRAIG, YOU ASSHOLE. ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO WIMBLETON? THEN WHY DO YOU HAVE ALL THOSE TENNIS RACKETS AND GO TO THE CLUBHOUSE EVERY SATURDAY? WHY DON'T YOU AN MARGO HAVE SOME MORE FUCKING KIDS?""

When I was in bands in the 90's, we used to drive hundreds of miles just to record in places we only heard about word of mouth. They didn't have near the capabilities we have now. We were SO stoked and SO appreciative to be in those places. Never did any of us walk around in self-pity pointing at gear and saying shit like ""Muuhhh... I guess I'll never have an amp like that. Muhhhh... it must be nice...""

People don't understand the countless hours I've spent reading and studying about this stuff. They don't know how many nights I stayed up until the sun came up just listening to a kick drum over and over while they were out impregnating last-call bar flies. Or the consistent early mornings I was at a job they were too cool to work (and made fun of me for) while they slept in. Not to mention the recording school that totally ripped me off in 2002.

Perhaps I've aged out already. I still feel exactly like the same person I was at 16, but I'm not. These days, I keep the studio door closed when people come over. When my wife asks me to show someone my room, I make an excuse not to. When people ask about recording, I make an excuse about something being broke or it not being a good time right now. I still enjoy sitting in here by myself, listening to music, fiddling with knobs and faders.  I'm still thankful. And it is nice, but would be a lot nicer if I could share it with others. Oh well.
