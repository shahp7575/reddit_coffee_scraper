It has its own wall mount and is usually on the patio wall (interior of the patio).  I've lived at this apartment for 4 years.

A new neighbor moved in around February (I think) who I knew immediately was going to be a problem.  Shortly after she moved in (her front door faces mine), I got a notice from my apartment that someone has complained about my pentagram wreath on my front door and found it offensive, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out whom that might have originated from.

I responded that per the lease agreement, I am allowed to put up holy symbols according to my religion, but I was willing to take it down if they could provide proof of which area of the lease agreement had been violated.  I received no reply.  

A couple weeks ago, I got another notice but with regards to my flag.  I was informed it was ""divisive, offensive, and did not comply with the exterior aesthetic of the community"".  I had 24 hours to take it down or get a fine.  

So I emailed the front office and asked if anything inside the apartment (even if it were visible from the parking lot) would ruin the aesthetic.  They said no.  So I got to work. 

I ordered the biggest flag that would fit on my living room window between the glass and the blinds, and got those window suction cups to mount it.  I also put up white twinkle lights all around it.  

Her car is parked directly under my living room window per assigned parking.  So now, instead of slightly seeing a pride flag, it's obnoxiously hanging in direct view.  I get up early every morning, and have my coffee just as she's leaving for work, smile, and wave.

Synopsis: Tyla, a homesick Venlil soldier on paid leave has the *brilliant* idea of visiting her parents while not telling them about her human totally-not-boyfriend (who's also traveling with her), much to their horror.

—-

# Valentín

I could feel Tyla’s body trembling against mine, her face buried in my jacket, her breathing uneven and shaky. She had cried so much, and yet I wasn’t sure if I could comfort her. I wasn’t sure how to help her when everything seemed so broken, so out of control. But I kept my arm around her, held her close, and tried to keep my mind focused on anything but the chaos around us.

I kept my gaze on the door.

Ignoring the mess was not easy, the screams of her mother, the way the guards were trying to handle the situation. But I couldn’t afford to look away. I had to make sure Tyla’s dad was okay.

It felt like hours had passed, but in reality, it was probably only a few minutes.

I saw the Venlil paramedic arrive, the way his uniform stood out against the dull backdrop of the shelter’s entrance. He moved quickly, his movements precise, and he seemed to have an air of authority about him. Pure business, no panic.

The medics seemed well-prepared, unlike some of the people in this place. I watched them load Tam into a strange-looking vehicle. A Venlil ambulance, I supposed, its design completely foreign to me. It wasn’t like the ambulances back on Earth, but I knew enough to recognize the urgency in their movements.

Tyla’s mother wasn’t in the mood to watch it unfold, of course. She kept her focus on Tyla, her ears pinned back in anger, but I could see the brief flicker of something else when she heard the paramedics talk. She couldn’t hide it. Not from me. Her ear twitched, meaning she heard Tam’s groan as his head moved, weak but alive.

*He’s going to be fine,* I told myself. He had to be.

The medic took charge of the scene with calm, efficient precision. There was no sign of panic from him. The paramedic made sure Tam was securely loaded into the ambulance before turning back to Tyla’s mom, who hadn’t even noticed.

I watched Jyla’s face as she saw her husband being driven away, and for the briefest moment, there was a shift in her expression. Her anger softened, but I couldn’t tell if it was relief or just disbelief.

Without a word, Jyla shot us a venomous look, one that could’ve peeled paint off the walls. It was all raw fury and disdain, a silent condemnation, before she climbed into her own vehicle. She revved the engine and followed the ambulance, the sound of her departure a bitter reminder that this wouldn’t be over anytime soon.

I pulled Tyla a little closer to me, my other hand gently cupping her cheek as I tilted her head up to face me.

“Hey,” I whispered softly. “Your dad’s okay. He’s moving. They’re taking him to the hospital now, he’ll be fine.”

Tyla’s eyes were deep orange from crying, her face so blotchy I wasn’t sure I’d ever see her look the same again. She didn’t say anything at first, just nodded against my chest, pressing her face back into my jacket. I could feel the way she trembled. She wanted to believe me, I could see that, but the fear still weighed heavy on her. She couldn’t just let go. Not yet.

But I had to be strong for her. Even if I wasn’t sure what would happen next, even if I didn’t know how to fix any of this.

“He’ll be okay,” I repeated, my voice more confident than I felt. “They’re taking care of him.”

Her only response was a soft, almost imperceptible sound, a choked little noise, something between a sigh and a sob. She couldn’t look at me, not right now, but I couldn’t leave her like this. I just held her tighter, because I didn’t know what else to do.

Tyla hadn’t let go of me the entire walk back, her hand still curled in mine, claws lightly brushing my skin with every nervous twitch. Her head stayed low, tucked in against my chest. She looked wrecked, but she wasn’t crying anymore. Just… silent. Staring at the floor like she wanted to fall through it.

The cargo bay door opened with a groan of metal, and the quiet died an instant death.

“AND THAT WAS MY LAST STASH, YOU FILTHY THIEVING PREDATOR!”

“Oh come *on,* it was ONE snack bar!”

“You don’t even *like* dried melroot!”

“Don’t mean I can’t try it!” Washburn’s booming voice nearly shook the rafters. He was holding what looked like a completely crushed food wrapper, while Kaija, white-furred, dark-eyed, and utterly furious was halfway up a crate waving her tail like a flag of war.

They didn’t notice us at first, mid-shouting match about snacks and “fridge etiquette.” I almost chuckled. Almost. But then Kaija’s ears twitched, and she spun around.

“Tylaaa!” she chirped, pausing mid-bounce. Then she saw our faces.

The whole room shifted.

Washburn blinked at me. “...The hell happened to y’all?”

Tyla didn’t answer. She just stared blankly at the floor.

I gave her hand a gentle squeeze and cleared my throat. “We, uh… We ran into her parents.”

Kaija winced. “Oof. That bad?”

I let out a bitter laugh. “Her dad fainted when he saw us. Thought I was… attacking her.”

That got a full second of stunned silence.

“Wait, *what?*” Washburn’s eyebrows practically jumped off his face. “Like passed out?”

“Like hit-the-ground, medic-had-to-come, out cold.” I muttered.

Kaija’s ears flattened, her earlier sass bleeding out of her like air from a punctured bag. “Stars above…”

“Her mom lost it too,” I added. “Started screaming at me like I was a monster. Tried to call the exterminators.”

“Holy *shit.*” Washburn’s jaw clenched. “You serious?”

“Dead serious.” I sank down onto the closest crate, dragging Tyla with me. She curled into my side, wordless. Just breathing.

Kaija stepped closer, much more gently now. “I thought you two were just gonna sneak out and make out under a tree or something…” She gave a weak, shaky whistle. “Didn’t think it’d turn into a- gods, Val, are *you* okay?”

I nodded, but it wasn’t convincing. “I’m used to being hated. I just wasn’t expecting it to be that bad.”

Kaija’s eyes flicked to the scarf Tyla still wore *my* scarf, and her face twisted, somewhere between heartbreak and rage.

“No one gets to scream at you like that for loving someone.” she muttered, voice cracking. “Not even them.”

Washburn folded his arms, tense. “I knew this business was a powder keg, damn! I shoulda gone with you guys.”

“You’d have made it worse,” Kaija muttered.

“True.” he said, not even arguing.

Tyla shifted against me, her voice a rasp. “They’ll never accept it.”

Kaija crouched in front of her, tail curled neatly to the side. “Then screw their approval. You’ve got us.”

Washburn let out a huff and added, “And hey, no offense to your old man, but you’ll always be safe here. If he or your mama try to cause more shit, I’ll go full ‘angry apex predator’ on 'em. Scowl and everything.”

That earned the tiniest huff of air from Tyla. A laugh, maybe. Or just an exhale with a memory of joy.

# Tyla

I didn’t want to think anymore.

The cargo bay had quieted down, the echo of stomping boots and booming human laughter giving way to murmured conversation and the distant hiss of coffee machines. The humans had dispersed to their various corners, and Kaija had disappeared somewhere deeper inside the shelter to flirt or snoop or do whatever chaos she considered fun.

I sat curled up on a padded bench near the wall, scarf still around my neck, a cup of *vegan chocolate* in my paw. That loud red-haired human, Washburn, I think, had handed it to me earlier with a lopsided grin and a clumsy, “You two look like you could use some comfort food.”

He wasn’t wrong. I licked it first. It didn’t smell like anything Venlil-made. But the taste… rich, strange, smooth. I took another sip, something about the flavor quieting the churn in my stomach.

For the first time since my mother started shrieking at Val like he’d torn out my organs, I felt just a little less like screaming into the void.

Part of me still felt like I was floating outside my own body, watching someone else live through this mess. My father collapsing, my mother spewing venom. Val holding my hand through all of it. Me, kissing him like the world was ending… 

But at least we’d kissed. That thought made my blood rush into my ears.

I took another sip. Still warm.

I should probably figure out where we were sleeping tonight. I didn’t want to go home. That much was certain. Home didn’t feel like home anymore.

I looked up as Kaija reappeared, fur slightly tousled, eyes bright and suspiciously smug. She flopped down on the bench beside me, completely ignoring personal space, and eyed my cocoa like she might steal it.

“You holding up, soldier girl?” she asked, nudging me lightly with her shoulder.

I gave a tired sigh. “Barely.”

She stretched out her legs with a grunt, tail flicking lazily. “If you’re wondering, yeah, I’m staying here tonight. The humans are weird, but at least they’re honest. And they’ve got showers. 

 “You’re not freaked out? After everything?”

She shrugged. “Please. I’ve seen worse at family reunions. Besides, I like it here. Kinda cozy. Feels like people actually *want* me around. That’s a new one.”

I looked down at the scarf again, fingers brushing the fabric like it was a lifeline.

“I don’t know where I belong right now,” I admitted quietly.

Kaija leaned back, eyes closed, arms behind her head. “You’ll figure it out. You always do.”

And stars help me… I wanted to believe her.

I was still nursing the cocoa when the red-haired human himself came striding back into view, boots thumping against the cargo bay floor like he wanted the whole shelter to know he was approaching. Washburn stopped just a few steps away from where Val and I sat, arms crossed over his broad chest and a dramatic scowl plastered across his face.

“Well, look who’s still here,” he drawled, thick accent making the words bend and stretch in weird places. “Ain’t y’all got a room or somethin’? This here’s a *shelter*, not a honeymoon suite.”

Val gave him a slow, unimpressed look. “We’re just sitting, Wash.”

“Uh-huh.” Washburn pointed a thick finger toward us, then toward the back hallway. “There’s open bunks down in C-Deck. Go claim one. Because I ain’t sharin’ a room with that mean son of a bitch *Escobar*.”

I stared at him, confused. “Who?”

Val just groaned and rubbed his face. “He calls me that. He thinks it’s funny.”

“It *is* funny,” Washburn insisted, smirking. “You look like you’re about to strangle someone half the time. I'm not wakin' up in the dark to find out Mr. Broody here’s decided to settle some ancient vendetta.”

“You’re the one who snores like a malfunctioning dropship,” Val shot back.

“Only when I’m sleepin’ good, buddy.”

Kaija chuckled beside me, trying and failing to muffle her laughter. “I like him,” she whispered.

I looked at Val. He gave me a tired shrug and a little tilt of his head, *you up for this?*

Washburn pointed again, this time with mock authority. “Go on now. Don’t make me assign y’all like a camp counselor. And no funny business, this is a *family friendly* shelter.”

Val stood, pulling me up with him. “Come on. Before he starts giving out toothbrushes and schedules.”

I took one last sip of cocoa, left the empty mug behind, and let him lead me away.

—

The dorm-style room was dim and quiet, lit by the same gentle glow that always hung over Venlil Prime. Rows of bunk beds lined the walls, a few occupied by other humans and the occasional brave Venlil, each wrapped in their own little islands of silence. Val and I had claimed a corner bunk near the end of the row,low to the ground, narrow, and barely wide enough for one human, let alone two people. But I didn’t care.

I didn’t even hesitate. I crawled in first, curling against the metal wall and leaving just enough room for him to slide in behind me. Val took off his boots and jacket and eased in with careful, deliberate movements. His arm brushed against mine.

“You sure about this?” he murmured, voice barely a whisper.

I answered by pressing my back into him, letting his warmth settle around me. “Yeah. Just don’t hog the blanket.”

His breath hitched with quiet laughter. “You’re the one stealing all the space.”

We shifted awkwardly for a moment, trying to get comfortable, until I found a spot where his arm was wrapped lightly around my middle and my head could rest beneath his chin. He was so much bigger, and yet I felt… safe.

I let out a breath I didn’t know I’d been holding.

My wool had always bristled at unfamiliar textures. At contact. But not now. Not with him. I felt like I could finally, truly rest.

His heart beat slow and steady against my back. My eyes drifted shut. In this shelter surrounded by predators, I felt at peace.

# Jyla

The sterile smell of the hospital made my fur prickle, a constant reminder of the horror I had just witnessed. I couldn't get rid of the image of her. *My baby*… trapped in that predator's grip.

Tam was coming around now, his eyes fluttering open as the confusion faded. His ears twitched slightly, and he groaned, trying to sit up. ""What happened? Why am I here?""

I wanted to scream at him, but instead, I ground my teeth, forcing out a calm voice. ""You fainted. Collapsed when you saw it.""

He blinked, confusion turning to focus. ""The human. Did it, did it hurt her?""

I swallowed hard, my chest tightening with the weight of what I had witnessed. ""It didn’t *hurt* her, Tam. Not in the way we feared. But that... *thing*... it had its *mouth* on her, Tam. Its face was pressed to hers, pulling at her like it was-"" I struggled for the words. ""Like it was feeding. Like it was *devouring* her.""

I couldn’t stop the bitterness from flooding my voice. ""And when I tried to get help, when I called for the exterminators, the *guards* stopped me! Told me they couldn’t do anything. They’re protecting that *filth*, Tam. They’re sheltering it. Letting it poison our daughter’s mind.”

Tam’s face twisted, confusion and pain flickering in his expression. “But... but it didn’t-?”

I hissed, my heart breaking in two. “It didn’t have to, Tam! The moment I saw it, I knew what was happening. That predator... it wasn’t just eating her, it was marking her. Claiming her as its *own*. Do you understand? It was *possessing* her, staking its claim like it’s some kind of savage beast. And she didn’t even fight back.”

Tam’s grip on my paw tightened as he sat up fully, a fire sparking in his eyes. ""But we can still fix this, Jyla. We will fix it. We’ll bring her back from this madness.”

I flicked my ears in agreement, a cold rage curling in my stomach. ""Yes. *We will*. She’s too far gone already, but we’ll make her see. We can’t let her fall any further into that creature’s trap.""

Tam squeezed my paw, his voice darkening. “We’ll make sure of it. Whatever it takes.”

# Tyla

For a moment, I didn’t even realize I was awake. I just lay there, curled up under the thin blanket, feeling the emptiness in the air where Val had been. The bed was still warm, though. But he was gone.

My heart skipped. My first instinct was to panic. Where did he go? What happened? But I shook my head, trying to clear the fog of sleep. He’s fine. Probably just stepped out for a moment. I stretched, feeling the weight of yesterday’s emotional rollercoaster settle back into my chest.

I didn’t want to think about it, about my parents, about what they said, about the terrifying look in Jyla’s eyes. I needed a distraction.

And there he was, standing in the cargo section, arguing with Washburn over something. I raised an eyebrow, rubbing my eyes, and padded softly toward them.

When I got closer, I could make out a bit of their conversation. Val was bent over the kitchenette, pointing at a pack of flour, gesturing at Washburn with the kind of intensity that usually accompanied a life-or-death argument.

“Dude, I’m telling you, that was MY pack of  corn flour, it was meant for arepas, not hushdoggies,” Val said, his voice tinged with exasperation.

I blinked. *Hushdoggies*? What in the world-

Washburn didn’t miss a beat. “Ain’t nothing wrong with hush***puppies***, man! What’s your damn problem?”

Val shot back immediately, his voice taking on that sharp edge he gets when he’s passionate about something.

 “*That lame-ass gringo food* ain’t gonna cut it. You can’t even open the hushpuppies and fill them with good stuff! What kind of cooking is that? That’s a travesty.”

Washburn threw his hands up in mock surrender, his booming laugh filling the room. “What? You don’t like southern comfort food now, Escobar? The hell are you gon’ fill ‘em with huh, **beans?**”

“Can’t believe you just stealth dropped a slur on me, Wash”  Val spat back.

“Heyyy you started it loverboy, take it easy!”

I couldn’t help but laugh, shaking my head. “Seriously, you two are arguing over “corn” flour?”

Val spun around at the sound of my voice, a grin breaking out on his face when he saw me. He stepped away from the makeshift kitchenette and crossed the room in just a few strides, his long legs making quick work of the distance.

Before I could even greet him, he leaned down and pressed a soft kiss to my forehead. Just a peck.

But gods help me.

My whole body locked up. My tail gave the tiniest twitch, and I’m pretty sure my ears did something ridiculous and undignified, like freeze at full attention. My wool fluffed up slightly despite my best efforts to play it cool, and my brain decided now was the perfect time to stop processing language.

Oh. Oh, that’s what that felt like?

My face was *burning*. I didn’t even have the instincts to step back. My legs had apparently entered sleep mode while the rest of me short-circuited.

What was I supposed to *do*? Do I nuzzle him? Kiss back? Was this a dominance display? No, no, Tyla, calm down, it’s not like he’s trying to eat you! You *just* went over this!

Then, from behind him, came a long, obnoxious whistle.

“Boooo! Get a room, you dang perverts!”

Washburn’s voice rang across the bay like someone honking a clown horn in the middle of a funeral.

Val turned to glare at him while I tried very hard to pretend I was not currently overheating and turning several shades darker under my fur. Washburn just doubled over in laughter, hands on his knees, shaking his head.

“We’re trying to *cook* over here, *lovebirds*!” he added. “I ain’t about to get food poisoning from secondhand embarrassment!”

Val just rolled his eyes. “C’mon,” he said, giving my hand a tug. “Come sit. Let’s eat Wash’s stupid hushpuppies before he tries to force-feed ‘em to the guards.”

I followed, still warm in the face, still a little shy about the kiss, but grateful beyond words for the normalcy. Or… well, as close to normal as you could get with these lunatics.

The hushpuppies were oddly shaped golden balls, still steaming from the fryer Washburn had rigged up from the kitchenette’s hotplate and a suspiciously battered pot. Val handed me one, and I licked it with suspicion before taking a cautious bite. It was crispy and soft and savory all at once, and not terrible. Maybe even good.

The clatter of the door made us all glance up. There she was, Kaija, her wool looked strange and ruffled … her steps looked just a touch off. Like she was favoring one leg, or maybe trying not to look like she was favoring one leg. I squinted… that was strange.

Washburn grinned like a devil. “Well look who finally waddled outta bed. Morning, *Cottonball!*”

Kaija’s ears flicked straight up, and her tail bristled. “Call me that again and I’ll stuff that fork where the star doesn’t shine, Predator.”

He howled with laughter. “That’s so mean!”

I tilted my head, watching her settle onto one of the crates near us with a little wince. “Kaija… are you limping?”

She froze. “What? No! I’m just sore from… uh… sleeping funny! Yeah, your stupid human beds are too soft. My back’s all outta alignment!”

I narrowed my eyes. “You didn’t sleep on a bed, though. You stayed in the breakroom chairs, remember?”

Kaija’s ears curled in. “Ohhh, well…. who’s keeping track! Anyway, what smells like overcooked oil and regret?”

Val smirked. “Washburn’s shitty hushdoggies.’”

“Hushpuppies,” Wash corrected with a dramatic sigh. “A Southern delicacy, ruined by this ungrateful savage.”

“It was my flour…” Val said, almost like a whimper.

I stifled a laugh and picked up one of the fried little balls. It was crunchy, oily, and oddly sweet… but not bad. Honestly, kind of comforting. Like the vegan chocolate from earlier, it gave me something else to focus on. Something warm.

Kaija took one and chewed thoughtfully, then blinked. “Huh. Not terrible. I was expecting worse.”

“You’re welcome,” Washburn said smugly, sipping his awful black brew. “Coffee?”

We ate in a loose circle, humans and Venlil, hunched around a crate like it was some kind of sacred table. The hushpuppies were better than expected, even if Val kept muttering about wasted potential. The horrible black coffee remained just that: horrible. But somehow, in this strange mix of laughter and oil-slicked fingers, I felt lighter.

Kaija, halfway through stuffing her third hushpuppy into her mouth, gave me a side glance and a mischievous flick of her tail. “So,” she said, voice muffled around her food, “what’s the plan for *this paw*, lovebird? You two gonna go sneak under another tree and traumatize more old people?”

I gave her a flat look and nearly choked on my coffee. Val snorted. Washburn nearly dropped the pan from how hard he was laughing.

“Too soon,” I muttered.

“Sorry,” she said, clearly not sorry. “But seriously, you just gonna mope around the shelter and snuggle all day? Or you wanna come see real Venlil at work?”

I hesitated, gaze dropping to the little fried ball in my claws. “I… don’t know. I haven’t thought about it. A lot happened last paw.” That was putting it mildly.

Kaija softened just a bit, only just. “Well, I’ve got work. Train station, you know the drill. Boring customs stuff. But hey, if you wanna tag along, I can pretend I’m mentoring a fresh recruit or something. Technically you’re not on duty, but no one’s gonna yell if you just hang around and help out.”

I looked to Val. He gave me a small nod, his expression supportive but quiet.

“Maybe,” I said slowly. “Might be good to keep my mind off things.”

Kaija leaned back, popping another hushpuppy into her mouth. “Good. Then you can hear *all* the juicy gossip we missed while you were off risking our lives or whatever.”

Washburn raised an eyebrow. “Y’all got gossip in the rail biz?”

Kaija laughed. “You’d be amazed at what people try to sneak through customs. There’s a whole underground market for colorful human socks.”

I blinked. “Wait, really?”

“Dead serious! Now Tyla, say goodbye to your boyfriend, we’ve got work to do!”

Kaija was already bouncing on her paws, halfway to the exit, her white tail flicking with amusement.

I turned to Val, reluctant to peel myself away from the quiet comfort of this chaotic shelter kitchen. He set down his coffee, stepping toward me with that gentle look that always managed to slow my heartbeat. Without a word, he reached up and adjusted the scarf around my neck, *his* scarf. His fingers lingering just a moment longer than needed. Then his hand moved, brushing along the side of my face in a barely-there caress.

My ears twitched. I could feel the tips burning.

How was it that *he,* a predator, someone so physically imposing, could be so… *tender*?

“I’ll see you later,” I mumbled, blinking up at him.

He just nodded, smiling. That quiet, crooked smile of his. The one that said *you’ll be okay* even if everything else was falling apart.

I stepped into his arms for a brief hug, his warmth and steady presence grounding me once more before finally pulling away.

Kaija made an exaggerated gagging noise from the doorway. “Okay, okay. Come on, lovebug, we’ve got rainbow socks to confiscate.”

I gave Val one last look, still flustered, before trotting after her.

The shelter’s doors slid open with a hiss, and we stepped back into the ever-dusky streets of Darkriver. My heart felt heavy, but also… not alone.

I’m  afraid that I’ve developed a crush on one of my work colleagues. I’m well aware of how sticky that can get, but luckily, my contract is expiring soon and I’ll be leaving for another job. I’m going to try not to give myself away because I know that this person lurks on Reddit... For that reason, I can’t give too many details, but I'll share what I'm comfortable with. 

My main question is how do you guys know when someone likes you? I've never been able to accurately pick up on people's vibes unless they make it *unmistakably* obvious... The clues elephant-sized before I start getting them, I swear. 🥲 Reading people has always been a problem for me. When I was much younger, I had trouble reading people's *facial expressions*! I've gotten much better at that, but when it comes to more subtle behaviours, I'm at a bit of a loss. This guy is pretty friendly with me and we share a lot of interests. He kind of went a little out of his way to help me back when I was new... but maybe he's just a friendly, helpful guy??? 🫠

I also have a bit of a plan... Close to the time that I leave, I want to exchange contact info with this person, but I would like to make it obvious that I’m interested in getting to know him outside of a work setting. I have no idea how to go about doing this nor even how to remain calm as I do it. My idea so far is to get him alone somehow (this might be my biggest problem), strike up regular conversation (which will probably just be about where I'm headed to next), then suggest that we keep in touch (if he doesn't ask first) at which point I'll give him my phone number and say something like, ""And if you'd like to grab some coffee, I would be open to that too!"" Not sure if that's too subtle! Coffee, to me, seems like a typical get-to-know-you kind of date, so I would assume that someone who asked might be interested in me, but maybe that's just me...",3,1750824729.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

1ljw402,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingIvyLeague/comments/1ljw402/chance_please_for_cornell_or_yale/,Chance please for Cornell or Yale,"Demographics: South Asian Male, NY. Highly Competitive School

Major: Animal Science GPA: 97.7% (UW 95.4) SAT: 1530

AP: My school is pretty small, so I don’t have a lot of options. I already took AP World and taking AP Lang and APUSH this year. Next year, I plan on taking AP Bio, AP Calculus AB, and AP Literature. In all of my classes I have a mid to high 90s average.

Extracurriculars:

Peer Tutoring Club(11) Peer Tutoring Club was created in the middle of my junior year. However, I was one of its founding tutors, mainly helping underclassmen. Next year will be especially important, as I will be tutoring physics, one of the hardest classes in my school, for the upcoming juniors. I will also head study sessions during AP, SAT, and Finals week and run the social media account.

Muslim Student Association (MSA) (9, 10, 11) At MSA, I’ve currently led meetings on multiple different topics as well as Friday prayers on some occasion. Next year, I plan on having more detailed discussions and community outreach. In fact, I plan on basing our meetings on the Cornell MSA. Additionally, I plan on connecting with the MSAs of neighboring schools and setting up a information center during Ramadan.

Newspaper Club (9, 10, 11) At Newspaper Club, I grew from being a photographer in 9th grade, to being a prominent writer in 10th and 11th grade. Additionally, I write for our Newspaper’s weekly Current Events column. Next year, I will be head of Arts and Entertainment, focusing on expanding the newspaper by introducing videogames/movies/series reviews and revitalizing our comic strip.

Chess Club (9, 10, 11) Despite being one of the worst chess players in the club, I’m currently the VP of the club. I’ve attended every meeting since 9th grade and helped organize a tournament in the school and neighboring high school. Next year, I plan on introducing Chess with Coffee and making the club more prominent with more frequent school tournaments.

Table Tennis (9, 10, 11) This is one of my proudest achievements as I have been president of the club since 10th grade. I run weekly game sessions and help coach newer players to the game. Additionally, my school has a bi-yearly festival, and at each festival I run the table tennis room, managing a school wide tournament of about 75 people ( my school has 400 kids). I also raised $300 in funds to get a new table single-handedly, and established a weeklong event in building it.

Field Research: At the Bronx Zoo, I performed field research for 6 months. In the summer, I was part of a group project assessing the health of 100+ native and nonnative trees and the pest activity between them. In the fall, I continued the project by assessing the diversity of 1000+ trees in urban parks in NYC and Boston. I presented my findings at two science symposiums. Additionally, I submitted the project as part of the TERRA NYC Science fair and wrote a publishable paper on my research, becoming a preliminary round finalist.

Guide: At the same zoo, I served as a guide for two years. In my sophomore year, I managed activities around the zoo, teaching about 300+ guests daily about different animals, conservation practices, and habitats. I also aided in directions and general zoo knowledge. As a junior, my responsibilities grew to aiding adult volunteers in explaining dinosaurs and their connection to birds in the zoo’s limited time event.

Tutor/Camp Counselor: I was a tutor and camp counselor at the same program since 9th grade. As a camp counselor, I managed groups of 20+ kids aged between 3rd and 7th grade and led activities such as outdoor sports, arts and crafts, robotics, academics, dance, MMA, etc. I also chaperoned groups of 10 during weekly field trips. As a tutor, I helped kids of all ages, but a majority being middle school and very early high school, teaching general math, general ELA, biology, chemistry, algebra, geometry, and standardized testing to get into high school and private school (SHSAT, ISEE, SAT)

Cornell Pre-College Programs: I took part in a course called Sustainable Animal Husbandry, taught by Dr. Melanie Soberon. The class focused on the ways humans and domesticated animals are intertwined. As such, I learned about the lifecycles of dogs, cats, horses, sheep, goats, dairy/beef cattle, pigs, and lab animals. Additionally, I learned about common diseases associated with each animal and ways to treat them. As my final project, I proposed a sustainable solution to the feral hog problem present in the US by presenting how farmers can use and grow peppers to create a natural deterrent. While doing so, I also highlighted the pros and cons for my solution, as well as alterior ways at solving the problem.

Tufts Pre-College Program: This program starts in the summer, so I have yet to actually start. However, the program is more focused on veterinary medicine and the different careers and opportunities a person has in entering the field.

Counselor 9/10

At my school, it’s really easy to make well-meaning connections with teachers and counselors due to the small class sizes. All my teachers I had for more than 2 years and are advisors to most of the clubs I am leading in the fall.

Essay
I haven’t started my essay yet, but I was planning on writing on how I overcame my fear of touching and hurting animals and connect it to my goal of being a veterinarian.

1ljw0lw,https://i.redd.it/769eqtnqzz8f1.jpeg,"From “Are you pregnant?” to “Damn, girl!” – My Lazy Girl Weight Loss Miracle","Let me tell you the truth, not the Instagram-filtered kind.

Pre-pandemic, I was that red-haired head-turner with a 26-inch waistline—fit, fierce, and confident. Then life hit me hard. Stress, long hours, zero movement, comfort eating, and next thing you know… I stopped measuring my waist at 36 because I couldn’t take the number anymore. People thought I was expecting. My clothes didn’t fit. My confidence vanished. I was showing up to client meetings praying my outfit would do something, anything, to make me feel normal again.

Worse? I started questioning if my team still respected me, if my husband still found me attractive, if my worth was fading with every extra kilo. I’d cry in front of the mirror, not because “slim = beautiful,” but because I didn’t feel like me anymore.

I tried everything. Pills. Coffees. Teas. Lipo RFs. Nothing. I work 12-14 hours, 6 days a week. I drink. I smoke. I don’t walk. I don’t gym. I needed something that would work for my lifestyle—no sugar-coating.

Then I found SF.

Desperate, I messaged Miss Glen. No questions asked, just help me. 30 minutes later, my order was being packed. I started Tirze.

💥 First dose in—and no joke—I went from inhaling a full pizza to barely managing a quarter slice. I didn’t force myself. I just felt done eating. No cravings, no obsession with food.

🌙 A month later? People stopped asking if I was pregnant. My face slimmed down. Arms, legs, back—everything was trimming down. Clothes fit. Confidence returned. Now, it’s June 2025 and I’m a curvy, stylish, smoky arse mumma rocking a size Medium again! Not skinny. Not pressured. Just happy.

And the best part?
No workouts. No 10,000 steps. No starvation.
Just Tirze, every 4–5 days. Currently on 5mg and it still works for me.

What I love about SF(not sure if I can drop the name here) & Tirze:

✅ You feel full faster
✅ Fat melts evenly—arms, thighs, even those stubborn back rolls
✅ No rebound even when you miss a dose
✅ Perfect for us busy, burnt-out girlies who just want to feel good again

⚠️ Heads-up though:
🚰 Drink water—3L a day at least
😵‍💫 Don’t skip meals, even if you’re not hungry (yes, Tirze does that)
😴 I do feel a bit tired sometimes, but I think it’s more my 14-hour shifts than the med

This is my miracle.
From hiding in Zoom calls to strutting into meetings again.
From self-doubt to quiet confidence.
I’m not done yet, but damn, I’m proud.
Thank you Miss Glen and the SF fam—you saved me from surgery, from shame, from myself.

To anyone who feels stuck in their body—lazy, exhausted, hopeless—you’re not alone. You just need the right push. I found mine. 💋

Let me back up a bit.

I moved into this basement suite in the spring. Not the best place I’ve ever lived. The ceiling’s so low I can press my palm flat against it without getting on my toes. Heating works when it feels like it. I’ve killed more spiders than I care to count, most of them crawling out of the tiny windows that are supposed to let in light but mostly just invite things in. But it was cheap, and I needed cheap. So I took it.

For a while, the upstairs was empty. Quiet. I almost started thinking I got lucky. Then the new tenant moved in.

Older guy. Maybe in his 60s. Gray beard, kind of wiry build, but hunched like he carried more weight than you could see. Never introduced himself. I only caught a glimpse of him once or twice, coming in or out. He kept to himself. Fine by me. I’m not exactly the neighborly type.

But even when I didn’t see him, I heard him. Mostly at night.

He’d walk. That’s all. Just… walk. Back and forth, over and over. Sometimes from midnight to four or five in the morning. The pacing never really stopped until the sun started coming up. You’d think it’d get on your nerves, but it was almost rhythmic. Predictable. At least at first.

Then came the scratching.

At first, I figured it was mice. This is the kind of place where you’d expect mice. It’d happen around 3 a.m.—little bursts of sound, sharp and frantic, like claws on drywall. And always after the pacing stopped. He’d walk, then the scratching would start. Like something was following him through the walls.

I tried to ignore it.

Until I started hearing the whispering.

At first it was so faint I thought it was coming from my phone. Just this quiet murmur above my head, too muffled to make out. I turned everything off. Still heard it. I put my ear right up to the ceiling, held my breath.

That’s when I heard the words.

""Let me back in.""

Over and over. The voice sounded… dry. Like wind blowing through old leaves. I don’t know how else to explain it. The more I listened, the more wrong it felt. I stopped sleeping through the night. Coffee, podcasts, whatever—I did what I could to stay awake until daylight. It helped. A little.

Then, two weeks ago, everything stopped.

No footsteps. No scratching. No whispering.

Just… silence. Not peaceful silence either. The kind that makes you realize how loud nothing can be. It rang in my ears. I figured the guy had moved out, or maybe he’d passed away quietly. I thought about going upstairs, but I didn’t want to get involved. I don’t poke my nose where it doesn’t belong.

That changed a few days later, when the smell started.

If you’ve ever smelled something dead, and I mean really dead, you know what I’m talking about. It’s sour, coppery and thick. It clings to your lungs. I couldn’t breathe in the hallway without gagging. That’s when I finally caved. I wrapped a towel around my face and went upstairs.

The door was closed, but not locked. I knocked. No answer. I opened it.

It was… it was worse than I expected.

The kitchen was wrecked. The upper cabinets were ripped from the wall—ripped, not fallen—and splintered like they’d been torn from the inside. The floor was stained with something black and sticky. Not blood. Too dark, too thick. Drag marks led from the center of the room to the far corner, and there he was.

Bent backward in a way that no human body should bend.

I don’t mean hunched. I mean folded. His heels touched the floor and so did his face. His spine arched up like a bridge, like something had pulled his head and feet toward each other and forced the rest to comply. His mouth was wide open like he’d died mid-scream, but his eyes… they were shut. Peaceful.

That somehow made it worse.

I backed out and called emergency services. They came fast. One of the responders took one look and had to step outside to puke. They asked me a bunch of questions, taped off the unit, and told me to stay out.

I haven’t slept much since.

Last night, around 3 a.m., I woke up to the pacing again.

Same rhythm. Same sound. Exactly the way it used to be. Back and forth, slow and steady, directly above me. Then came the scratching. Then the whispering.

But this time, it wasn’t muffled. It was clear. Right above my head.

""Let me back in.""

I lay there frozen, staring at the ceiling. I told myself it had to be in my head. Residual stress, maybe. Sleep deprivation. Something logical.

Then came the thud.

One single, solid impact. Directly above my bed. Not a creak. Not a drop. A thud. Like something heavy slammed into the floorboards.

This morning, I couldn’t take it. I went upstairs. The police tape was still there, right across the door. No sign of tampering.

Except for one thing.

Someone had left a note. Stuck right onto the tape with a piece of blue painter’s tape. Looked like it had been written with shaky hands.

The note said:

""The door is locked. But I remember the way through the walls.""

That was hours ago.

I’ve kept the lights on ever since. I can’t bring myself to lie down. I don’t know what I’ll do if I hear it again tonight. 

I just needed someone else to know. Just in case.

I’m dealing with a situation involving a friend, but I have no way to prove anything. am I out of luck here? What can I do?I’ve known this girl since middle school. I’m in college now, so we go way back. But lowkey… I think she pulled something shady on me😭. If you’ve seen any of my previous posts on this sub, you’d know I’m already going through it. so I genuinely don’t understand why she would do this to me at all, and now, of all times?

She’s pretty comfortable financially. She usually helps my mom and me out here and there with groceries, sometimes shares clothes, that sort of thing. Anyway, about two weeks ago on a Wednesday, June 11th to be exact, she called me saying she was having the worst day ever, full-on rant mode. Later that day, she came over to my house with some groceries. Over coffee, she started panicking and saying she was going to get fired because something was wrong with her work phone. Like, fulllll mental breakdown. For context, I’ve always known she has the work phone during the week but hands it over on the weekends to someone else.

I saw the phone, it was vibrating weirdly and the screen kept flashing purple. She said before she came to my home, assumed it was a screen issue and got the screen replaced, but that didn’t fix the issue. Apparently, the problem was with the motherboard, and the fix would be super expensive AND would take three days.She told me she had to hand over the phone the next day (Thursday) & if she wasn’t able to she would 100% get fired. Proceeded with saying that she had tried to buy a the exact phone using Tabby but it was not approved. She said she couldn’t pay in full because she just got back from vacation and was broke.

In my head, I’m thinking, this girl always helps me and my mom, so I felt kind of pressured to return the favor. I told her to relax and that she could use my Tamara account since I’ve got a solid history and never missed a payment. I honestly had no doubt.. she would pay it ofc? she’s financially stable + she has used my account before & never not paid. So we go ahead and order the exact same iPhone model and color as her work phone, from my Noon account, using my Tamara account to MY address 😃. The phone arrived in less than 20 minutes. She even added her own card to my Apple Pay and said she’d let me know as soon as her salary came in so I could pay Tamara on time. FYI the payment was split in 4, the initial payment she made was 526. The remaining 1200 was to be paid over 3 months.

She kept thanking me, and when I called her the next day to check in, she was still very grateful and said everything was fine at work. But now… the card is no longer usable, she’s been ignoring my calls for a week. Her salary should’ve come in on the 24th (yesterday), messaged her on WhatsApp about 2 hours ago.. she was online, but didn’t respond.

He forgot the anniversary we got together on.

They are separate dates.

He tried to make light of it and joked it off on both occasions.

He's able to put the Dr's appointment for his hrt for testosterone on his calendar without fail (he has low testosterone) but he is incapable of making me even a cup of coffee on our anniversary. Even after I've reminded him.

My final ditch attempt at saving us was to book us a short trip to an island resort all paid for by me.

We haven't been intimate since last year August so that's another anniversary coming up.

Yay.

And this morning he's doing the whole passive aggressive silent-treatment thing for no reason at all (last night we went to bed just fine).

We leave in 5 days time and I'm so tempted to tell him not to come with me (pun fully intended).

I'm literally at the stage of moving into the guest bedroom and buying another vibratory or sex toy cos seriously f*£& this.

I buy the groceries, I cook, I clean, I do the laundry, 90% of the upkeep of our pets is on me and on the rare occasion that I ask him for help (like trimming their nails) I get an annoyed sour face in return and he grudgingly does something but it will be half-fucked.

And all of this on top of the fact that I work 6 times a week (weekends and public holidays).

1ljvqq8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ljvqq8,"Tahoe 200 Recap – Part 7: Redemption, Laughter & The Long Climb to Dawn","Brockway, Round 2.
It was everything I hoped for and more. My crew was ready this time — miso soup piping hot, mashed potatoes loaded in pouches, coffee in hand. It was the aid station experience of dreams, and more than made up for the chaos of my last stop here.

And this was the moment I picked up my second pacer — my crew captain, Gary, a seasoned ultra runner who didn’t hesitate for a second when I asked him to pace the final 50+ miles to the finish. Just after 9 PM, we rolled out, headlamps on, spirits high, ready to tackle Powerline Trail — this time, in reverse.

The climb back out of Brockway felt almost gentle. The night air was crisp, my body was moving well, and I was back in hunter mode — chasing headlamps, closing gaps, feeding off momentum. Most runners had pacers by now, as mental fatigue was real, and going solo was near impossible.

When we hit Powerline, the laughs came fast. Going down this trail might be even worse than the climb — loose sand, ankle-twisting drops, and overgrown brush grabbing at every step. Gary, a Tahoe skier, took it all in stride. We both wiped out more times than we could count, but we laughed the whole way down. We hit the base in what felt like record time.

After shuffling through a couple of runnable miles, we arrived at Village Green Aid Station around 1 AM — my wife Morgan had it dialed. She was solo crewing and absolutely crushing it. Total legend.

I checked my position in the race and realized I was flirting with the top 50. I told myself that if I could land 27th or better, I’d break into the top 10% of finishers. That thought kept me sharp. But I also knew I needed just a bit more rest before facing the Flume Trail climb.

I went down for 45 minutes — my shortest nap yet. It flew by. I woke up groggy, but determined. Just before the nap, I’d inhaled some pizza. It tasted amazing… but my stomach disagreed. I’d burp up that slice for hours. Meanwhile, poor Gary was dealing with his own stomach “issues” from the other end. We were a mess — just two guys trying to get it together on a mountain at 3 AM.

The climb to Snow Valley Saddle was long and punishing. Mentally, I bounced between highs and lows — powering up sections, then crashing hard and needing rock breaks to reset. As the sun rose on Day 4, we hit the top. The final mandatory snow crossings were icy and sketchy, the ridge line completely frozen. It wasn’t pretty, but we got through.

Reaching the saddle was a breakthrough. The climb was done, and though 6 miles still stood between me and Spooner Aid Station, I could taste it. Gary and I moved steady, talking just enough to let the miles pass. Winding trail. False ridges. More false ridges. Finally: Spooner North Trailhead.

And then — what the heck — I see a familiar truck.
A familiar face.
One of my coworkers had been following my race, saw I’d be crossing Spooner that morning, and decided to surprise me mid-ride. I couldn’t believe it. That kind of support hits different. We shared a short chat, a quick moment of gratitude, and I continued down the road.

190 miles in. 20-ish to go.

But I wasn’t done yet.

Time to let the volunteers work their magic — because the finish line was finally within reach.

It doesn't hurt right now. I can think about what he did and breathe without pain. My heart isn't racing. My mind isn't speeding down dark avenues, trying to imagine what we did with her and the sweet nothings he must whisper in her ear. 

I've been getting so many flashbacks of us today. Silent memories. Getting coffee from his apartment's cappuccino machine. The crumbs on his kitchen floor. Our third date when his car broke down. I can't help but feel I'm in the eye of the storm. Like I'm touching the part of my mind that gave me permission to fall in love with him and build trust. 

I believe I can get through this now. Im no fool, I know not done healing, the hard moments will come back, the panic attacks are still waiting to explode inside me. But I also know it's possible to feel calm while acknowledging that he betrayed me and that it's over.

### **EPISODE 7: “Blast Radius of Compassion”**

---

### **EXT. BACKWOOD ROADSIDE – EARLY MORNING**

A light fog clings to the Delaware pines. Birds chirp. A dog barks in the distance. The tank sits parked awkwardly on a gravel shoulder, treads still hot from tearing through a public garden on the way in.

**SKIDMARK** stands outside the tank, staring up at a crooked pine tree. His arms are crossed. His jaw is set. Beside him, **BUNKER** holds a pair of binoculars the wrong way.

**ROGERS** leans halfway out the hatch, sipping a coffee from a cracked thermos, grease-streaked and unimpressed.

---

**SKIDMARK**
*(pointing upward)*
“There. You see it?”

**ROGERS**
“Yeah. It’s a cat. In a tree. Where cats go. Because that’s what they do.”

**BUNKER**
*(peering through binoculars backward)*
“Looks like a tiny tiger from here.”

**ROGERS**
“Buddy, you’re looking through those things like a cereal box toy.”

**SKIDMARK**
*(ignoring them both)*
“Protocol 17-A says civilians in distress justify limited use of force.”

**ROGERS**
“There’s no civilian in distress.”

**SKIDMARK**
*(dead serious)*
“That cat’s not just a cat. That’s the emotional infrastructure of this episode.”

---

### **EXT. TREE BASE – CONTINUOUS**

A little girl, **MAYA**, no older than eight, stands a few feet away with a tear-streaked face and a sign around her neck that reads “LOST CAT: PRINCESS MEOWINGTON.”

She looks up at the crew. She sniffles. She says nothing.

**BUNKER**
*(melting)*
“Oh no. No no no. We can’t leave her like this. That cat is her whole emotional arc.”

**SKIDMARK**
“Exactly.”

**ROGERS**
“You two are going to use *a tank*… on *a tree*… in *a state forest*?”

---

**SKIDMARK**
*(raising hand to the tank mic)*
“Gunner, target: upper bough, twelve feet high, low yield round. We're liberating that feline.”

**ROGERS**
“Sir, I’m literally the gunner. And I’m also the mechanic. And I’m telling you: this is dumb, illegal, and liable to land us in court or TikTok. Possibly both.”

**BUNKER**
“But think of the child.”

**ROGERS**
*(groans)*
“…Fine. But if we hit a squirrel, I’m filing paperwork.”

---

### **INT. TANK – FIRING SEQUENCE**

The tank hums to life. A low hydraulic whine, a targeting system booting up with retro beeps.

**ROGERS**
*(deadpan)*
“Main gun. Tree. God help us.”

A moment of stillness.

Then—**BOOM.**

---

### **EXT. TREE – MOMENTS LATER**

The explosion sends bark, needles, and one very surprised **Princess Meowington** flying in a gentle arc… right into **Bunker’s arms**. She lands unharmed. Confused, furious, and alive.

Maya gasps, runs over, hugs the cat like it’s the last warm thing on Earth.

Behind them, the tree smolders. A perfectly perpendicular, cinematic break through its middle. Birds fly in panicked spirals. The tree shivers, then splits in half, falling apart.

---

### **EXT. TANK – LATER**

**MAYA**
*(beaming)*
“Thank you, tank people!”

**SKIDMARK**
*(salutes with full ceremony)*
“Just doing our duty, ma’am.”

**ROGERS**
*(quietly to Bunker)*
“Why does it always end like this?”

**BUNKER**
“Because love... is the real ordinance.”

**ROGERS**
“Shut up.”

**Liberia – Meztli Coffee House**

We stayed in Liberia the night we flew in (Hampton Guanacaste Airport Hotel), and found a great coffee house next door. I stopped in for an evening espresso and was blown away. Came back the next morning and was treated to a bright Anaeróbico Costa Rican pour-over. Great coffee, good vibes. Totally unexpected next to the airport hotel. Walked away with a bag of Dulce Tropical beans.

*Side Note: Snagged an iced coffee from Café Macadamia en route to La Fortuna.*

— — —

**La Fortuna – Red Frog**

What can I say that hasn’t been said about Red Frog? We spent 3 nights in La Fortuna, and Red Frog was our home base. It was my first time being introduced to the chorreador, the traditional Costa Rican pour-over. They roast their beans in-house, and the coffee was incredible. The food was great too! Bought two bags of beans — one of their lighter roasted honey processed, and one bag of the Geisha roast (the roaster’s pride and joy).

*Another cup of coffee from Café Macadamia on our pass to Monteverde.*

— — —

**Monteverde – Don Juan Coffee Roasters**

Spent a wonderful Father’s Day at the Don Juan chocolate & coffee tour. I’m not gonna lie, I was a bit dismissive going in given that it was a tour, but I was wonderfully surprised by the experience. The tour was more geared toward their chocolate production, but they went into depth on their coffee production as well. I would recommend the tour — friendly and knowledgeable guides and really good coffee (and exceptional chocolate). Came away with two bags of coffee (one honey processed, one washed) and three bars of dark chocolate.

— — —

**Tamarindo – Nórdico Coffee Roasters**

We ended our trip in Tamarindo. Yes, it is exactly as everyone says… a touristy city full of gift shops and kitschy restaurants. We still found it charming (the night market was great), and managed to find a terrific coffee roaster in town. Very cool café, and great coffee! They prepared most of the cups using a Vandola (ceramic pour-over coffee dripper). Came home with a Geisha Red Honey roast from the West Valley.

—

It was a trip of a lifetime! We obviously enjoyed so much more than just the coffee, but it was a great experience seeking out local cups and enjoying the culture through their dedication to the craft.

So She is a black or mixed (idc idk why I have to write this) works in pharma research and went to brown. Completely my type a corporate girlie, more prestigious education, tall, pretty and smart.

I matched with her on hinge last night and she was free, she is also a year younger 23, she is a vegan I can’t ask for more. 

We both were excited to meet, it is super hot today and we had plans to go to moma it’s the only museum I know something about but we somehow met at Bryant park, got some coffee at this shop on the 40th street, walked around whole foods and walked in nyc library. It was fun I was nervous. 

She is so cute. Much better than her pictures.
Has these cute curly hair, and a great sense of fashion. 

We talked about so much shit, vegan food, nyc transit, Maine on 4th July, money, anti natalism and the commitment issues I have and depression, running came up, I talked about starva which I should not have. 

We held hand and made out a little but I was sweating it’s 100* out here. She has roommates and had to go back idk if she did not want to do anything else or if I gave some ick. 

I never had a thought about sex until writing this, I also don’t have anyone to share this with so I have to write this down. 

Now I might have screwed it up as i do, she has sent me this meme which I talked about (this Chinese dude talking about setting small goals like making 100m$) so she is not scared of me ig. 

But I told her on the date itself we won’t be able to meet much cause parents and then me moving away so now I don’t know what I should be doing. 

I want to see her but I also don’t want her to miss her 20s being with me. She is the light that will dark out with me. So should I approach her, part of me wants her to live her best life which is not what can happen if she is with me.

1ljvgzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/productbible/comments/1ljvgzh/the_best_home_espresso_machines/,The Best Home Espresso Machines,"Making café-quality espresso drinks at home is easier than ever, no professional barista experience required. Modern espresso machines are more intuitive, more powerful, and more beginner-friendly than they’ve ever been. With a little practice, you can pull rich, balanced shots and craft velvety lattes or cortados, all without leaving your kitchen.

After researching dozens of machines, we found the **Breville Barista Touch** to be the best overall pick for most home users. It combines ease of use with smart automation and hands-on control, delivering consistently excellent espresso and silky steamed milk with minimal effort.

## 🏆 Best Overall Option: [Breville Barista Touch](https://productbible.com/blog/best-home-espresso-machines#breville-barista-touch)

The Breville Barista Touch is our top pick for anyone who wants a versatile, easy-to-use espresso machine that can grow with their skill level. With a sleek touchscreen interface and built-in tutorials, it’s an especially good choice for beginners looking to make café-style drinks at home. At the same time, it offers the flexibility of manual operation for those who want to fine-tune their technique. Whether you’re new to espresso or interested in refining your craft, the Barista Touch strikes a smart balance between automation and hands-on control.

One of the standout features of the Barista Touch is its intuitive digital menu. The touchscreen guides you through the entire drink-making process, from grind size to milk frothing, and offers factory presets for espresso, lattes, cappuccinos, and more. You can also save custom drink settings or take full manual control of each step. The machine includes a built-in grinder, dual and single-wall filter baskets, and an auto-frothing wand that lets you adjust foam levels based on your preferences.

In terms of espresso quality, the Barista Touch performs well. Shots are consistently balanced, with a smooth mid-tone flavor that leans toward cocoa, occasionally revealing brighter notes depending on the blend. While it doesn’t extract quite as much complexity as more advanced machines, it still delivers rich, drinkable espresso that satisfies most home users. The inclusion of a pressurized basket helps beginners achieve solid results, even if their grind or tamp isn't perfect, while the traditional basket allows for more nuanced shots with the right technique.

Milk frothing is another area where the Barista Touch excels. The steam wand is powerful and supports both automatic and manual frothing. For auto mode, the milk pitcher sits on a built-in temperature sensor, which makes it easy to hit the ideal texture and temperature for everything from cappuccinos to hot chocolates. The steam wand also self-purges after use, helping maintain cleanliness and reducing upkeep.

There are a few trade-offs to consider. The Barista Touch uses a non-standard portafilter that is narrower and deeper than typical models, which can make it slightly harder to dial in your shots. The double basket also has limited capacity, fitting just around 15 grams. Despite these limitations, the Breville Barista Touch remains one of the most approachable and feature-rich machines available, offering a streamlined path to high-quality espresso at home.

## 💸 Best Budget Option: [Gaggia Classic Pro](https://productbible.com/blog/best-home-espresso-machines#gaggia-classic-pro)

The Gaggia Classic Pro is the best budget espresso machine for those who want high-quality shots without spending a fortune. It’s a stripped-down, semi-automatic model that focuses on what matters most: making excellent espresso. With the right technique and a bit of practice, this machine can pull rich, complex shots that rival those from far more expensive options. Its commercial-style portafilter and powerful brew group offer a solid foundation for home baristas looking to improve their skills.

In its price range, the Gaggia Classic Pro stands out for the quality of espresso it produces. It consistently delivers balanced shots with depth and clarity, highlighting flavors like dark chocolate and citrus, depending on the beans used. While it lacks a PID controller, which means temperature stability may vary slightly during back-to-back shots, the overall extraction quality remains impressive for the cost. This machine proves you don’t need to pay top dollar to enjoy nuanced espresso.

The machine’s controls are refreshingly simple. With dedicated buttons for power, brewing, and steaming, and indicator lights to show when each function is ready, the Gaggia is easy to learn and operate. It heats up quickly, too—ready to brew in about a minute, and the transition to steam takes only about 30 seconds. The water tank is accessible from the top and sits below the boiler, which makes it easier to refill without having to move the machine.

There are a few small limitations. The included plastic tamper is undersized and not ideal for proper extraction, so a quality metal tamper is a worthwhile upgrade. The steam wand, while capable of producing microfoam, is less powerful than others and fixed in place, which makes positioning a bit awkward. A separate steam pitcher is also required, as one is not included. Still, once you get used to its quirks, the Gaggia can create milk texture good enough for lattes and cappuccinos.

For espresso-focused users who care more about shot quality than extra features, the Gaggia Classic Pro is an excellent starting point. Its combination of durability, simplicity, and potential for great results makes it a standout option for budget-conscious coffee lovers.

## 💎 Best High-End Option: [Breville Oracle Jet](https://productbible.com/blog/best-home-espresso-machines#breville-oracle-jet)

The Breville Oracle Jet is a premium espresso machine that delivers professional-level results with remarkable ease. Designed for both beginners and advanced users, it combines the automation of a super-automatic with the flexibility of a semi-automatic. From grinding to tamping to steaming, the Oracle Jet walks you through every step, making it an ideal option for those who want a simplified espresso-making experience without compromising on quality.

At the heart of the Oracle Jet is a guided interface that teaches users how to operate the machine and dial in a shot. Interactive diagrams and video clips appear on the large display, showing you how to set grind size, tamp pressure, and extraction time. The machine provides real-time feedback on your shot, letting you know if it was over- or under-extracted and recommending grind adjustments to improve the next one. While experienced users can disable these guides and use manual settings, the built-in assistance makes it easy to produce great espresso from the start.

One standout feature is the **automatic tamper**, which ensures consistent, level pressure every time without mess or effort. After locking the portafilter into place, the machine doses and tamps the grounds automatically. This eliminates one of the more error-prone steps in espresso prep and lets users focus on other aspects of extraction. The included 58mm portafilter is wider and shallower than Breville’s entry-level models, allowing for more even water distribution and better-tasting shots.

The **built-in grinder**, made with burrs by Baratza, offers 45 grind-size settings for fine-tuning your brew. It produces uniform, consistent grounds comparable to those from high-end standalone grinders. Additional usability features, like a lever to roll the 27-pound machine and a front-access water fill port, make the Oracle Jet practical for everyday use. It also comes with helpful accessories, including a knock box and a stainless steel milk pitcher.

With excellent **milk frothing capabilities**, the Oracle Jet can automatically steam dairy and non-dairy milk to your preferred texture and temperature. The integrated temperature sensor at the wand’s tip allows for more precise heating without awkward pitcher placement. While it includes a cold espresso mode that delivers a drinkably cool shot, its cold-brew setting is less impressive. Still, for anyone looking for a near-effortless espresso routine paired with café-quality results, the Oracle Jet justifies its high price with a powerful, polished experience from start to finish.

1ljvcks,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ljvcks,Costa Rica Coffee Tour,"We just got home from an incredible trip to Costa Rica, and I did my best to seek out some great coffee along our route. Thought I would share some of my finds with y’all!

**Liberia – Meztli Coffee House**

We stayed in Liberia the night we flew in (Hampton Guanacaste Airport Hotel), and found a great coffee house next door. I stopped in for an evening espresso and was blown away. Came back the next morning and was treated to a bright Anaeróbico Costa Rican pour-over. Great coffee, good vibes. Totally unexpected next to the airport hotel. Walked away with a bag of Dulce Tropical beans.

*Side Note: Snagged an iced coffee from Café Macadamia en route to La Fortuna.*

— — —

**La Fortuna – Red Frog**

What can I say that hasn’t been said about Red Frog? We spent 3 nights in La Fortuna, and Red Frog was our home base. It was my first time being introduced to the chorreador, the traditional Costa Rican pour-over. They roast their beans in-house, and the coffee was incredible. The food was great too! Bought two bags of beans — one of their lighter roasted honey processed, and one bag of the Geisha roast (the roaster’s pride and joy).

*Another cup of coffee from Café Macadamia on our pass to Monteverde.*

**Monteverde – Don Juan Coffee Roasters**

Spent a wonderful Father’s Day at the Don Juan chocolate & coffee tour. I’m not gonna lie, I was a bit dismissive going in given that it was a tour, but I was wonderfully surprised by the experience. The tour was more geared toward their chocolate production, but they went into depth on their coffee production as well. I would recommend the tour — friendly and knowledgeable guides and really good coffee (and exceptional chocolate). Came away with two bags of coffee (one honey processed, one washed) and three bars of dark chocolate.

— — —

**Tamarindo – Nórdico Coffee Roasters**

We ended our trip in Tamarindo. Yes, it is exactly as everyone says… a touristy city full of gift shops and kitschy restaurants. We still found it charming (the night market was great), and managed to find a terrific coffee roaster in town. Very cool café, and great coffee! They prepared most of the cups using a Vandola (ceramic pour-over coffee dripper). Came home with a Geisha Red Honey roast from the West Valley.

—

It was a trip of a lifetime! We obviously enjoyed so much more than just the coffee, but it was a great experience seeking out local cups and enjoying the culture through their dedication to the craft.

Is there some sort of solution here?

1ljvbhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ljvbhz/aio_for_confronting_an_older_man_who_repeatedly/,AIO for confronting an older man who repeatedly mocked me for the way that I study at a local coffee shop?,"I am a semi-regular (I go a few times a week) customer at a coffee shop, where I enjoy going to study for a couple hours while enjoying a pastry and coffee. The cafe is well-known to be laptop-friendly, and  many of the “regulars” stay to work on their laptops much longer than me and the owner is very welcoming to us. Whenever I go, I am polite to everyone, spend about $10, tip the baristas, clean up after myself, and take up less space than the average man. 

When I study, I use my iPad to take notes while I watch lectures on my laptop. The laptop is either on the table or on my lap while I hold my iPad, so I’m not taking up extra room. There’s this older man (let’s call him “John”) who appears to be in his late 60s, and goes to the coffee shop to sit and read the newspaper for hours or look at his smartphone. On several occasions he’s mocked me about using 2 devices while I study. 

The first time, he looked at me with my laptop and iPad laughed, saying “I think it’s ridiculous that everyone here is always on their devices. Why do you need TWO computers?!”. I smiled politely and explained to him that I am in graduate school watching lectures and this is how I study since some of my coursework is online. He said “well, I miss the good old days, when people weren’t all addicted to technology” and I was like “yea, I can understand that” then went back to studying and gave him the benefit of the doubt, thinking he was a bored lonely older man who felt nostalgic about his youth.

The second time, John saw me and interrupted my studying again to say “oh hey it’s you again, I just find it so comical that you feel the need to use TWO computers” then went back to reading his newspaper. I just smiled and responded, “Gotta do what you gotta do!” then went back to studying. By this time, I was feeling somewhat irritated and disrespected. 

The third time, I lost my patience for John mocking me. He interrupted me once again while I was watching a lecture to make fun of me with my “two computers” and I responded, “John, I’m getting the sense that the way I study upsets you for some reason, is there a reason why it bothers you?” He looked taken aback and started fumbling about how young people these days are all addicted to technology. I said “John, I understand that you may be retired, but I’m in the beginning of my career and I need to study. As I already explained, some of my school is online so I use my iPad to take notes and my laptop to watch my lectures. I am in the process of becoming a healthcare professional to save people’s lives, so I take my academics very seriously. I would really appreciate it if you could please stop mocking me for how I study.”

He looked extremely surprised at my response and made some comment about how sensitive everyone in my generation is and how I was overreacting over a joke and being rude to him. If he’d just said it once I would have let it go, but it was the repeated harassment that really started to bother me.

1ljva67,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDDpartners/comments/1ljva67/pmdd_reached_its_worst_i_have_seen_yet/,PMDD Reached its worst I have seen yet.,"My wife’s PMDD has gotten to a point where I am worried for her wellbeing and that of or family. 

We have 3 kids, a boy 14yo, girl 11yo, and our youngest girl 7yo. 

Her PMDD is next level. Unfortunately we are a total neurodivergent family. I am ADHD/ASD, my oldest and youngest are both like me, the middle child is ADHD with severe anxiety and is in early stages of puberty (not having full cycles yet) and she is showing symptoms of PMDD too. Particularly the uncontrollable rage. 

I hate that my wife models the abusive, mean, and aggressive behaviour as okay because she has PMDD and ADHD and it’s not her fault. 

I mean I agree, it’s not her fault however I feel there needs to be some form of accountability. 

Because of how she treats me when she is at her worst, it has started to make my kids think that she is right and that I am a shit human. 

She has aggressive outbursts with the kids and has even pushed my son over once and grabbed my 11yo daughter’s arm so hard it left bruises in a perfect shape of a grabbing handprint on her arm for weeks. It was bad enough that my daughter felt the need to make up a story to tell her friends so they would think her mums a psycho. 

When she is in this state I feel so bad for her because she misses out on so much of the family fun and bonding because everyone shuts down and zones out on their devices to stay out of trouble. When she goes to work they all come out and start talking and playing again. (She works nights). 

Everyone walks on eggshells when she is home. From the minute she wakes up she is beating me down and criticising everything I do. Nothing is enough. I get up and make the kids lunches and breakfast of a morning because she said I don’t do enough and that it’s not fair. I agreed with her that I could do more and the lunches and breakfasts were one thing she specified. Along with making her a coffee so it’s ready and still hot when she got out of bed. 

A lot of the time doing this makes me late to start work or I have to move around meetings etc to suit. 

Of course the way I make their lunches is not good enough or not exactly how she would do it so it makes her mad. She sits at the bench and watches me rushing around trying to do it all and do it right while she sips her coffee barking orders at the kids and I. 

Look, I’m not perfect. In fact I am far from it. I had a moment of weakness about 2 yrs ago where I genuinely thought she hated me but only stayed because of the kids. So I was planning to leave her as I thought I was making her so unhappy. It was heartbreaking because I still loved her and I was so worried the kids would then hate me. I found comfort in talking about it to a friend at work who had recently been through divorce a few years before. Unfortunately I found too much comfort with her and had an emotional affair (non physical) with this woman which lead to me losing my job and my wife finding out. 

I ended up talking through the whole affair and have been open and honest with her about everything. I appreciated that it would take time for her to heal and by talking about it whenever she needed to understand it more helped her heal. It is still brought up every month. 

Now because of this it has added fuel to the whole situation. She has had arguments with me about it in front of the kids who didn’t know about it creating more anxiety for them. They started asking if we were going to break up which was heartbreaking. 

She is seeking treatment for it. She is on antidepressants, hormone therapy (oestrogen gel) and some other medication as well as a bunch of dietary supplements. She also has o e of those birth control things implanted. 

Some months I think it is all helping and yet other months it’s so bad that I feel like I’m just a shell of a human that all I can say is sorry for this, sorry for that, and try not to trigger anything. 

I realise that I don’t want to leave her and never will. I just don’t know how to deal with it. She refuses therapy of any kind. I end up in a state of depression that my meds do nothing for. Then she comes out the other side and expects everyone to pretend the past couple weeks didn’t happen. It takes a bit for us all to recover and resurface our emotions but she takes this the wrong way and ends up wasting the 2 good weeks spiralling. 

It’s truly sad and such a debilitating disorder. There needs to be more attention on finding a real solution for women who deal with this beast. 

I am truly lost on how to live a happy life with this thing. I work from home and it makes me shut down internally and my job suffers. I am fearful I may loose my job because of it. ",2,1750821999.0,PMDDpartners,1,1.0,False

His company has a location in Leeds (near Middleton Park I believe) and I would likely be working remotely. 

We currently live in a LCOL area in the Rust Belt/Midwest in the U.S. so are trying to figure out what sort of expenses in addition to rent we need to keep in mind. We have both also lived in larger cities in the U.S. (DC, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Durham, Louisville) and want to get some general comparisons if anyone has any insight.

We normally live in city centers but are thinking we might like to live in a village or market town in something with 2-3 bedrooms and a small garden and/or the option for an allotment that has good public transit into the city. We’d like to stick with one car, transit, and bikes, whereas here we pretty much have to have two cars. Close proximity to parks, good walks, independent shops, coffee shops, book and record stores and volunteer opportunities are a big plus for us especially since I’ll be working alone at home. Can we get that for $2000-$2500 a month? 

I think I’ve figured out council taxes, but am not clear if that’s paid monthly or annually. Are other taxes taken out of your paycheck? 

Any ballpark ideas for what to expect for household utilities and taxes/expenses for a cheapish used car?  

Any other expenses that surprised (happily or unhappily) other Americans moving to Leeds?

# Movement I: Fermata in Silence

The last echo of the broken note still clung to the rafters, even after Wellers had turned and walked away. I stood there, surrounded by emptiness. The chandeliers above no longer shimmered. The hush was heavier than silence, thicker than dust.

I looked out across the audience. The red velvet seats had returned to stillness. No more clawing shadows, no mouths stretched into forever. Just rows upon rows of perfect emptiness, as if no one had ever occupied them. As if the things I had seen, felt, feared… had never been here at all.

But one chair drew my eye.

Front row, center-left. Seat 7. Claire's seat.

No one sat there now. But the cushion bore the faintest indent, the shape of someone having sat with poise, stillness, care. Pressed into the velvet was a ghost of a presence, more intimate than anything else in the hall.

I stepped down from the stage, my hand trailing along the keys one last time. They were cold now. Lifeless. No voice left in them. Just polished wood and quiet dust.

Down the aisle I walked, past where the shadows once writhed. Towards the corridor Wellers had vanished into, the door parted just enough to suggest invitation.

As I walked through, the ground beneath my feet had begun to crack. Hairline fractures like veins in skin, running beneath the surface. The sconces lining the corridor flickered as I entered, not from power loss, but like they were deciding whether to stay.

I moved slowly. The hush of the hall followed me into the corridor, but here it was different—denser. Almost syrupy. Like I was walking into soundlessness made solid.

The corridor twisted subtly with each step, just wrong enough to feel it in my bones. Paintings lined the walls—portraits of men and women in recital dress, all expressionless. The further I went, the more warped their shapes became: limbs too long, necks too thin, eyes that didn’t point the same direction.

And then, I saw her.

Claire.

Or what looked like her.

She was seated in the painting, hands resting in her lap, dark hair tucked behind one ear, a blue dress like the one from the recital. But this wasn’t the frozen poise of performance. This was different. She was looking at me. No…through me.

The brushwork shimmered like wet paint. I stepped closer. Her eyes seemed to change as I did—widening, softening. There was recognition in them. Sorrow. I raised my hand, fingers trembling. I didn’t want to touch it. I just needed to see if she would stay.

I blinked.

She was gone.

The frame was empty. Just aged canvas now, the ghost of a portrait that hadn’t ever been. I stood in front of it for a long while, unable to breathe. Then I heard footsteps—soft, steady—from up ahead.

Wellers.

I turned and followed.



# Movement II: A Door in the Score

I found him standing at the end of the corridor—motionless—his hands folded behind his back like a curator admiring a painting. Before him loomed a tall door of polished black wood, inlaid with a mirror that didn’t reflect a thing. No light, no room, no me. Just a yawning pane of stillness. Like it hated the concept of its existence.

He didn’t look at me when I approached.

“This is the quietest part of Bellmare,” he said softly. “She breathes slowest here.”

“What is this door?” I asked.

He tilted his head slightly, as if listening to some distant instrument tuning itself. “A mirror, Mr. Goodpray. But not to what’s in front of it.”

I stared at the door. It pulsed slightly. Like it was waiting.

“I have a question,” I said. “Back when I first arrived. The rooms without names. You said you preferred not to disturb them.”

“Wellers did say that,” he replied, tone mild. “A gentleman should never pry where he isn’t invited.”

“But what were they?”

He smiled faintly. “Rooms don’t like to be watched. Some contain echoes. Some… house rehearsals that never ended. Some doors open inward.”

He finally turned to look at me. “You’d be surprised what still lingers when the music stops.”

His eyes, dark and glasslike, held no warmth. But no cruelty either. Just something deep. Old.

“You talk like you’re part of this place,” I said.

“Wellers has been many things,” he answered, almost wistfully. “Concierge. Usher. Custodian. Mouthpiece.” He placed a hand gently on the doorframe. “But never the composer.”

“And who is?”

“The one who listens. Who gathers. Who waits for the final note to fall.” He glanced at me. “But not all music is meant for endings. Some… simply linger.”

My breath had fogged slightly, and I hadn’t noticed until now. The hallway behind us seemed longer than it should have been. Like we’d stepped outside of something. Or beneath it.

I touched the cold metal handle. It trembled faintly under my hand, though I couldn’t tell if it was my own pulse or the door’s.

“Wellers,” I asked, quietly. “Is there a way out?”

He regarded me. “That depends. Some find freedom in silence. Others in crescendo.” He paused. “But you, Mr. Goodpray—you’ve already given the performance. The question is what you do after the curtain falls.”

We stood before the mirror door. It didn’t show us. Just a pitch-black depth. Like staring into a river without bottom.

“Well then,” he said, and his voice barely rose above the breath of the hall. “Shall we proceed?”

I nodded, though everything inside me screamed not to.

And together, we stepped through.



# Movement III: Recitativo

We didn’t step into a room. We stepped *out* of one.

Beyond the mirror, the world shed its shape. Not dark, not bright—just absence, stretched into suggestion. The corridor was gone, replaced by something less built and more remembered. Space didn’t hold here. The ground shifted and pulsed beneath us like walking on water. Walls curled like parchment soaked in time.

We were walking, but nothing moved.

Memories blinked into view, then vanished. A field I’d never walked in. A woman who looked like Claire but wasn’t. A recital hall where the ceiling bled stars. A cracked piano in an old train car. Children’s laughter from a mouthless choir. A woman playing a violin.

“None of this makes sense,” I muttered.

“Wellers never promised it would,” he said beside me.

“You aren’t Wellers.”

A pause. “No.”

I stopped. The air stood still. “Then what are you?”

He turned his face to me, and in the not-light of this place, it blurred slightly. Like a portrait not fully dried.

“I’m the third son of a man who plucked the stars,” he said softly, as if the words were old and tired. “I was composed before the bell was first struck. I listened. I learned.”

His voice was Wellers, but not *just* Wellers.

“Music was born to echo,” he said. “So I became echo. Song. Refrain. I learned to wear men like overcoats. They walked me into churches, into concert halls, into cities built on sorrow. I listened to their notes. I remembered them.”

“And Wellers?”

“He let me in,” the voice replied. “Long ago. In grief. In yearning. He wanted to remember something so badly that I stayed to help him.”

“What did he want to remember?”

There was a hush, like a page turning. “A girl with hair like copper chords. She played violin in the hollow before the Hollow.”

Silence settled. I didn’t push further.

We passed a window—though nothing lay beyond it—and in the ripple of its not-glass, I saw a painting. Claire’s face. Not her living face, but one painted by someone who missed her more than they understood her. She was smiling—but it wasn’t for me. Or maybe it was. I blinked, and the image evaporated. The world here didn’t hold its shape unless I looked at it.

“You said you listened,” I said again. “But why *me*? Why now?”

He didn’t stop walking. “Because you played.”

“That’s it?”

“You played the grief in your bones,” he said, almost gently. “And places like Bellmare remember songs like that. You gave your mourning shape. That makes you more than an audience.”

I wanted to be angry. But there was no room for rage here.

“Why didn’t you take me earlier?”

He turned his head just slightly. “You weren’t ready to let go.”

The path beneath us flickered like piano keys pressed by invisible fingers. Each step sounded not like footsteps, but notes played in a room with no walls.

“Is Wellers… still alive?” I asked.

“For a time. Long enough. He served the hall well. Carried its quiet for decades. A good host.”

“And now?”

A small smile touched the corner of Wellers’ borrowed mouth.

“He’s fading. The song is softer now.”

I swallowed the lump in my throat. “And Claire? The real Claire?”

A longer pause this time. The silence felt like a drawn breath just before the crescendo.

“She passed through,” the voice said. “But she was not taken. Some spirits write themselves louder than I can erase.”

I didn’t know whether to thank it or mourn again.

We walked a little farther, and the non-existent path finally formed into something definite. A door. Wooden, carved with a wreath of thorns around a single keyhole. No handle. No reflection.

The thing wearing Wellers looked at me.

“This next part,” he said, “you walk alone.”



# Movement IV: Interlude for Two

I stepped through the door and into home.

The apartment smelled like rain and dust on the sill. It wasn’t just any place—it was ours. Claire’s scarf hung on the hook beside the kitchen. One of her books lay open on the coffee table, spine cracked in that same way it always had. The window was cracked an inch, the curtains breathing in and out like lungs trying to remember how. The walls were warm with afternoon gold. The kind that comes just before a storm, when the air thickens and memories slip through the cracks. I half-expected to hear the kettle whistle from the kitchen, or the soft thump of her feet padding across the floor.

Instead, there was only music.

It came from the piano, just out of view, in the far room. Gentle, slow. Each note held too long, like it didn’t want to let go.

I turned the corner.

And there she was.

Claire. Not in blue. Not in black. Not some twisted reflection from Bellmare’s throat. But her. Hair loose and dark, falling like a ribbon down her back. She wore an old grey cardigan with a hole in the sleeve. Her fingers moved across the keys with grace—not performance, not compulsion. Just music. Just being.

She didn’t look up, not at first.

I stepped closer. “Claire?”

She finished the song, let the silence land gently, then turned. Her eyes met mine. And for a moment, the ache in my ribs untwisted itself.

“Hi,” she said.

I couldn’t speak at first. My breath had caught somewhere between the years.

“I—I’ve missed you,” I managed.

“I know,” she said, and smiled, sad and warm. “I’ve been with you the whole time, you know. Even when you couldn’t see me.”

I knelt beside her, not daring to touch her.

“Was it all real? The Hollow, the hall, the music?”

Her eyes moved to the piano. “Some places are made from grief,” she said. “And some scores stay because we keep playing them.”

“I tried to save you.”

“I know,” she whispered. “But I didn’t need saving. You did.”

A silence hung between us like a last note waiting to fade. Her hand reached out—not to touch, but to hover just above mine, as if contact would break the illusion.

“You can let go now, Liam,” she said.

“I don’t know how.”

She blinked slowly, like a curtain falling.

“Then just *try*.”

I did.

And when I opened my eyes again, she was gone. The piano was empty, the keys still warm. The sunlight had dimmed, and the room had folded itself back into memory. As I stood, I felt the absence land quietly in my chest—not jagged like before, but soft. Bearable.

Behind me, a shadow crossed the doorway.

“Wellers,” I said.

He nodded once. The same suit. The same stance. But no smile.

“To leave,” he said, voice still too calm, “there must be a price.”

“I’ve paid,” I said, without hesitating. “I’ve played. I’ve wept. I’ve given her up.”

He tilted his head slightly, something ancient flickering behind his eyes.

“Yes,” he said, voice richer now, more layered—like a choir echoing inside his chest. “You have. And I do not keep what was freely given.”

He stepped aside, revealing a new door. One I hadn’t seen before, even in dreams. There was no sound behind it. No music. Just wind, and the scent of soil and ash.

“Wellers is resting now,” the voice added, quieter. “He heard enough songs for one life. Maybe too many.”

I looked back once more at the piano. The room. The absence. Wellers.

Then I walked through.



# Movement V: Final Refrain

The door didn’t creak as it opened. It breathed—like something sighing its last.

I stepped through into air that was far too still.

The sky was grey, but not with storm or smoke. It was the kind of sky where the world forgets to turn. Dorset Hollow lay before me, or rather, what remained. The town had been consumed. Not freshly. This wasn’t the aftermath of a sudden fire. No—this had happened decades ago.

Charred timbers stuck out from cracked sidewalks like bones. Vines and ivy choked storefronts whose signs had long since faded to memory. The post office was caved in. The diner was gone entirely, only the metal skeleton of the *DIN(N)ER* sign left—its last flicker long gone.

The silence was total, but not empty. It felt cleared, like the stage had been finally struck after the final act. I walked through the ruins, boots crunching cinder and glass. No one followed. No voices, no notes. Just the wind.

I passed the statue—now collapsed, overgrown, eroded to the knees. No piano. No scarf. Just a stone base lost to time. But it was the church that stilled me.

Saint Cecilia’s stood at the end of the street like a forgotten sentinel. Its steeple was cracked, but not broken. Its sign hung crooked, the lettering barely legible.

*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn.”*

The windows were blackened from the inside. Not just soot. Scorched glass, melted and warped, like they’d burned in a fire that never touched the rest of the building. And behind them, even in daylight, there was that same impossible glow. Like flames from a time far gone. I didn’t go inside. I just stood there a while. Not praying. Not asking. Just listening. And the church, mercifully, was silent.

I found my car where I’d left it. It shouldn’t have still been there, not after however many years had passed. But it was. Dusty, but intact. The keys laid on the hood.

The drive home was long, but uneventful. Roads uncoiled beneath my tires like ribbon being drawn back from something. Towns flickered past, alive and indifferent. Gas stations. Trees. Traffic lights. The world had kept going.

And now, so would I. 

When I stepped into the apartment, the scent of old life greeted me. Mail piled by the door. A coat left hanging. Silence. The same silence from Bellmare, but not possessed. Not suffocating. Just quiet.

I crossed the room, past where her photo still sat—framed in silver, smiling in spring. I didn’t touch it.

Instead, I went to the piano.

It had been under a sheet since the day I stopped playing. Not out of spite. Just… pain.

I took a breath, and peeled the cloth back.

Dust swirled, catching the amber light of the setting sun. The keys were yellowed slightly. The wood dry. But it was whole.

I sat down.

No voices whispered. No shadows reached for me. No notes forced themselves into my hands. Just silence.

I placed my fingers on the keys. And then, for the first time in years, I played.

Not for her. Not for anyone watching. Just to let something go.

The melody was soft, simple. I don’t even know where it came from. But it felt like closing a door.

When I finished, I left my hands resting on the keys.

In the hush that followed, I almost imagined I heard someone whisper “thank you.”

But no one was there.

And that was okay.

For a moment I forgot where I was. But after coming back to my senses, the air had changed. It was thicker—not because of humidity or heat, but like I was underwater. Sounds were muffled, my breath was slightly strained. I looked back out into Dorset Hollow, but it was still there. Silent, slow-moving, waiting. The streets were empty as always, but now—for some reason, I knew people were there. 



I walked past stores that sold nothing. A flowershop with dead tulips in the window, a tailor with no mannequins. Even a post office where mail slots were nailed shut. But then I saw it again.



The *DIN(N)ER* sign was flickering like it didn’t have anywhere more important to be. I walked in, if only for the sense of normalcy it would provide. That was naive of me. The same waitress stood—with the same cherry-red lips that her smile stopped at. 



I didn’t ask for any, but she poured me coffee. “Sleep well, honey?” she asked.



“Not really.”



She didn’t say anything to that, but placed a napkin near my cup. Someone had drawn some music notes on it in pen—the same three notes from my dream.



“You know this song?” I asked.



“It knows you.”



I didn’t ask her to explain.



I wandered deeper into town after I downed my coffee. The Hollow itself wasn’t big, but it was deep—like a painting where the shadows would lead you to another. Roads looped back onto themselves, houses kept repeating, but with slightly different, barely noticeable features when I passed them again. I tried to escape this town, just to see if I could, but every road led back onto itself and every sign became circular.



There were no cars, no wind, no animals. I was drawn by the smell of fresh bread to a bakery, but the door was locked. The sign outside simply wrote “Recital Tonight—7PM”



I passed a bookstore that I hadn’t noticed before, or maybe it just wasn’t there before. There was a single book displayed behind the window. Its title, in silver ink on a blue face, said “The Audience Remains”. 

I walked in. There was no bell, just a hush that sank into my soul. Sat on the counter was a woman who must have been the clerk. She didn’t react to my entry or presence.



The shelves were full of books that were bound in some strange leather. It was too dry, too smooth. Most of them had no titles. Some were filled with nothing but blank pages, some with nonsensical piano scores. I opened one and it had, written down to the very bottom of every single page:



LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY

LIAM GOODPRAY



I slammed it shut and looked up. The lady behind the counter hadn’t moved an inch, her back still turned to me. But then I noticed it. She was humming. The same three notes. I left before she could turn around.



I needed more coffee. So I went back to the diner. It was quieter now though, the indoor lights were dimmed slightly and the red glow of the *DIN(N)ER* sign was noticeably faded. The young man was sitting in his booth. Same flannel shirt and same thousand-yard stare. He nodded to me as I entered and then pointed to some kind of bulletin board near the register. 



“I didn’t know you were famous,” he said.



I looked. It was a recital poster. In an elegant, silver-penned script at the bottom was the Bellmare Hall crest. But the person on it wasn’t me. It was Claire.



She was mid-performance, at that same piano from the hall. Her black hair was tucked behind one ear on her tilted head. The dress she was wearing was the same blue as the flash I had seen yesterday in the concert hall. Her expression was the same one she had when she got lost in the music—poised, serene, beautiful.



But the date at the bottom of the poster, between the crest and the picture, read “March 3rd, 1953”.



“That’s not me,” I said, barely holding back tears.



The man simply looked at me and shrugged. “Sure looks like you buddy.”



I stared harder at the poster, and just for a second, I could see it. My hands on the keys, my face superimposed onto hers. But then it was gone. Just Claire again.



I blinked and some tears made their way through. “That’s not me. Just someone I knew. Someone who’s gone.”



He looked at me again, with no emotion behind it except maybe tiredness. “Lots of folks think they recognize someone in these old posters. Faces change, blurs overlap. But she’s always there, the lady in the blue dress. Always seated in the front row, always smiling like they’re playing a song that she composed.”



I stepped forward and had my face maybe a few inches away from the poster. More details emerged—details that shouldn’t have been there. A necklace I gave her on our third anniversary, a scar on her hand from that time she broke a plate.



“This can’t be real. She’s never been here. She wasn’t even born in the fifties.”



“Time’s funny in this town, especially around Bellmare,” the man said, looking at his coffee. “Sometimes it doesn’t flow, sometimes it sits still, waiting.”



“For what”



He took a sip of coffee. “You.”



I stepped out of the diner, my heart pounding in my chest like a wild animal in a cage, and my hands squeezed so tight it felt like I was holding glass. I didn’t know where I was going, but I just had to walk. 



A poster from 1953. With Claire on it. This had to be some twisted joke. A prank that the whole town was in on. But I couldn’t explain the necklace or the scar, or how her face almost became mine for a second. 



I kept walking. Went right past that damnable bookstore. I’m praying it gets burned to the ground. Right by those stupid houses. Shadows followed me in the windows like angels of death, but they would be gone once I looked at them. And the sun seemed to be setting, but only in the spots where I stood. Maybe I’m just going crazy.



I just kept walking. But then I noticed it—past the hollow buildings and shaded windows. A small church, rooted in ivy and fog. Its white steeple pointed heavenward. The door hung open, inviting me in. The sign out front was faded, but I still made out the lettering:



*Saint Cecilia’s—Est. 1897*



Beneath it, scratched into the wood:



*“Sing unto Him, ye who mourn”*



I stepped inside. The temperature dropped immediately. It wasn’t just cool, it was freezing, like an arctic crypt. I could even see my breath. The air smelled like damp wood and it had a sharp, metallic undertone that I couldn’t make out. The interior was dimly lit, but it was still intact—untouched by time. Pews were lined up like a tightly-knit army and a simple altar stood at the opposite end of the door. A modest piano sat to the side of it, much different than the one in Bellmare. This one didn’t seem to be calling me to play. 



On the walls were stained-glass windows, but the colors seemed too dark. I thought it was just dust, but then I noticed that there was no sunlight behind the glass, despite the fact that it was the afternoon. It was more like they reflected the glow of a dying blaze: strong, impactful, but otherwise ending.



I moved further in. The floor creaked sadly beneath my feet, as if it was mourning itself. On top of the pews, candles were lit, leaking wax down the wood—leaving fresh impressions upon the cushions. There wasn’t a soul in sight, but I saw the hymnal. It laid upon the altar, pages yellowed and stained. One stood out—fresh ink was written on it, blacker than black. It read:



*“Requiem for the Empty: For the grieving and the chosen”*



Beneath that title was a list of names. A couple dozen perhaps. They didn’t mean anything to me, after all, they were just names. But then I noticed the dates beside them. They ranged from the early 1900s all the way up to 2018. Each had a title.



*“Harold Carr (1902)—Died during performance”*

*“Benjamin Mandol (1907)—Checked in, hasn’t checked out”*

*“Jonathan Bale (1912)—Playing still”*



And right there at the very end:



*“Claire Halden (2018)—Admitted. Not recovered”*



I stared in shock. This couldn’t be the same Claire. My Claire. Halden was her last name, but this is impossible. Then I noticed something off about the page. It was strangely warm. I turned around without even thinking. Nothing behind me but the dripping wax. But then I saw the floor.



The impressions of bare footprints on the dust led from the altar to some corner in the back near the confessionals. I followed. The door of the booth was open, just a bit. I didn’t step in—I couldn’t. Not when I saw what was scratched onto the inside of the door:



*“It’s not her. Not really”*



Then from behind me, where the piano lay—three haunting notes. 



That was enough. I left quickly. Not running though, I didn’t want to feel like prey, but every step had more effort put into it than the last. I eventually had to force myself to go further, like something behind me was forcing me to stay. I didn’t look back, not even once.



Back in town, the sky had dimmed. It wasn’t sunset, not yet, but the light was dying. Shadows stretch farther than they should have been able to. A nearby clock read 4:22 p.m, but I don’t think time was behaving correctly anymore. I passed the town square and noticed a statue. It wasn’t a war memorial or a founder’s statue or anything. It was a man seated at a piano. His arms stretched and bent wrong, fingers melted into the keys. No name or plaque adorned it, but wrapped around his throat like a noose was a blue scarf. And a lavender bouquet laid at his feet. I continued onward.



I made it back to the hall just after 5:00 p.m. The doors were already open, beckoning to me. Inside, the chandeliers were lit, and the air held a hush—like an auditorium right before a conductor lifts their baton. Mr. Wellers stood waiting in the lobby, same suit, same smile. 



“You’ve seen her, haven’t you?” he asked. The way he said it was too casual, like he’s said it a thousand times before.



“I’ve seen…something,” I replied.



“Mr. Wellers finds that it often helps to look,” he said, hands folded. “But not too long. Reflection is a doorway, Mr. Goodpray. But some doors, once opened, don’t shut.”



I stared at him. “You speak like a preacher. Or maybe like…something else is speaking for you.”



His lips curled ever so slightly, into something not quite a smirk. “Wellers is but a humble mouthpiece,” he replied. He then paused, tilted his head, and stared right through my soul. And then, in a voice not his own, “But the tune is me.”



Nope. That’s it. That’s the line. I backed away, but he didn’t move, didn’t follow. He just bowed his head.



“You should rest,” he said, his voice back to his Louisiana tone. “The performance begins at seven sharp.”



I tried to go to my car, but my legs had other ideas—pretty soon, my brain followed their lead. Instead, I climbed the stairs back to my room. The passage there seemed longer than before, deeper even. My door was open even though I distinctly remember closing it. Inside, a suit was laid on the bed. Black cashmere and silk, cleanly pressed, spotless. Under the amber lights, it shimmered like the night sky. Beside it lay a single lavender and a slip of paper. I picked it up. In the same damn handwriting as the letter that started this whole mess, it read:



*“Bellmare Presents: One Night Only*

*Liam Goodpray, Pianist*

*Those who play, remain”*



Outside, I heard the wind whisk their way through the branches, like whispering voices. And beneath it, music. It wasn’t a melody I knew, but one I could understand. It had a purpose. Shape. But then, it exploded from everywhere. The bed, the desk, the walls, even the windows. I leaned closer to one, drawn in like a sailor to a siren. A reflection began to form in the glass, but it was not my own. 



Claire. In that blue dress, sitting in the front row of the concert hall, just as the young man said. Through the reflection, her eyes met mine. She was smiling—not kindly, nor cruelly. Just knowingly. And then, a nod.



The clock in the wall struck 6:55. I reached for the suit.



Time to play.

1ljv75p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MoLogic/comments/1ljv75p/the_final_recital_part_1/,The Final Recital (Part 1),"# Part 1: The Invitation



Have you ever heard a note lingering in the silence, faint but unyielding? Like a summons from some unseen conductor? It’s not a melody you know, nor a score you stumbled upon by chance. More like you were a restless instrument, untuned and wandering, until you found yourself playing the exact chord you were destined for. That’s how this symphony began.



I hadn’t played a piano since Claire passed away six years ago. She taught me everything: sheet music, posture, patience. Where to loosen up and where to hold tension. She had this heavenly touch when it came to music, soft but deliberate, like her fingers could feel the notes. She was an angel not only in her personality, but in her music.



How I wish it remained like that. Alas, she got diagnosed with cancer. Brain cancer…terminal. It was sudden, and very soon she started to fade. Her eyes lost their glint, her fingers their skill and precision. Eventually, she had to be hospitalized before it all came to an end. In her last few minutes, she told me to keep playing in her memory. I promised her I would as I felt her pulse disappear, holding her hand.



I couldn’t keep my promise, just looking at the keys had me hearing her ghost in every note. I didn’t get rid of the piano, though. It would be like throwing away the last piece of her soul. I kept it covered in a sheet like an unburied corpse. It simply sat there, mourning. Like me.



Then one morning I came into my kitchen and found a letter on the table. I was curious how it got there, but didn’t pay much mind at first. I went to inspect it. It was thick and yellowed, like aged parchment that was just unearthed from a crypt. My full name was written in precise, cursive script—*Liam Goodpray*. No stamp, no return address.



The first thing I noticed was the smell. I must’ve been imagining it, because it smelled faintly like Claire’s favorite perfume, some lavender one, but slightly more metallic. It must be her death getting to my senses. I opened the letter and read the text laid bare on it, in the same handwriting of the front.



*“To Mr. Liam Goodpray,*



*You are cordially invited to perform at the Bellmare Concert Hall, located in our old town of Dorset Hollow. One night, one recital*



*Pay: $50,000 cash*



*Mr. Wellers awaits you.”*



Just that offer was written, by a name I’ve never heard before, and some faded map at the back. No phone number or email or anything. I actually laughed out loud. Fifty grand in cash? For a single performance? It had to be some sort of trick or scam. But there was nothing there except an address. Would I go there and just get carjacked or something? 



I’ll be honest though, it piqued my curiosity. I didn’t decide to take the offer, though. Not at that point. I simply placed the letter back on my kitchen table where I found it.



I dreamed of Claire that night. She was onstage, but not dressed for it. Not in the blue dress she used to wear to her performances. Just herself. Tall, lean. She sat there barefoot in black jeans and a faded Nirvana shirt. Her black hair fell to her shoulders. Her eyes, those deep blue eyes. The kind you look into and can never see the bottom.



She was playing something I didn’t recognize. It was beautiful, yet impossible, like trying to comprehend the full scale of the universe. The music sounded like the concept of grief. Pure, unadulterated grief. Grief so deep it was sacred.



She simply looked at me and said, “Don’t go.” No fear or worry, just pleading.



I woke up shaking, and there, laid on my nightstand, was the letter.



I did my daily morning routine and jumped into my car. After that dream, I just wanted to see Dorset Hollow, despite Claire’s pleas. I wasn’t going to perform or even touch that piano, I just wanted to see. At least that’s what I told myself.



The drive took five hours. Back roads all the way. Halfway through, the GPS gave up, so I had to follow the map that was printed on the back of the letter. It was so faint that I could barely make it out. It looked like it was trying to disappear, like it didn’t want to be followed.



The trees grew thicker the closer I got. The road narrowed and the sounds of nature got ever the more hushed. Soon, I could hear nothing but the sound of my engine, but even that started to fade into obscurity. Every bend in the road I took made the sky grow more gray, more dreary, even though there were no clouds. Then I reached the sign.



*“Dorset Hollow: A Place for Quiet Reflection”*



The town looked preserved. It wasn’t old, wasn’t abandoned, just looked like time had eventually stopped flowing here. Buildings stood straight, yet hollow. The windows were clear, but dark, like they were reflecting moonlight rather than basking in the afternoon glow. The strangest thing was that I didn’t see anyone walking around, yet I knew they were there.



Then I saw the diner. It was simple, modest, but it felt comforting. It looked like it was out of a show and just said *DIN(N)ER*. Clever. I hadn’t eaten all day, so I pulled in.



The interior looked like it was from 1965. Checkered floors, red booths, even an old jukebox. It smelled like coffee and bacon, with a little bit of floor polish mixed in. Three other customers were seated, an older couple and a guy who looked to be my age. They all looked at me when I entered. They weren’t startled or surprised, just..aware.



I sat down at an empty booth and the waitress came over. Her hair was in a tight ponytail, her lips too red for this tired town. Her smile was perfect, but it didn’t reach her eyes. They looked almost hollow.



“You headed to the concert hall?” she asked as she handed me the menu.



“How’d you know?” I said, wondering what made it obvious.



She shrugged and looked in some general direction. “Not many folks come by here unless they’ve been invited.”



I told her my order but she didn’t write anything down. A few minutes later, she brought me a feast fit for kings. Black coffee and a plate with scrambled eggs and toast. It tasted exactly how breakfast used to taste as a kid. Simple, warm, a little too perfect.



The young man looked at me from his booth. “You play?”



I hesitated a bit before answering, “used to.”



He nodded, like he heard that a million times, before responding, “that’s good enough for Bellmare.”



I forced a smile at him. “You been?”



But he didn’t answer. Just went back to staring at his food.



I reached for my wallet, but the waitress rushed over to stop me.



“It’s covered,” she said.



“By who?”



She just gave a small shrug and said, “Mr. Wellers takes care of his guests.”



“Nice guy”, I thought to myself, before tipping her $5 and leaving for Bellmare Hall. It stood at the edge of the town, where the trees became forest. It didn’t fit the town—too big, hollow, imposing. It was made of what looked like marble and stone, like a cathedral for worshiping music. Vines grew up its massive walls like veins, ivy curled around lanterns that still burned, tall stone arches held doors twelve-feet high.



Yet a man stood waiting on its stairs. He was unnaturally tall and scarily thin, fitted into a charcoal-gray suit, and adorning a black top hat under a few tufts of white hair. It was like today was his funeral and he forgot to attend.



“Mr. Goodpray,” he said, Southern drawl straight from the bayou. “Mr. Wellers welcomes you.”



His smile was polite, inviting, yet practiced. It didn’t reach his eyes.



“You’re Mr. Wellers?”



He nodded. “Some call me that.”



“Is that what *you* call you?”



He titled his head to the side and let out a slight smirk, like he was amused by my question. “Mr. Wellers prefers to keep things proper.” 



That didn’t answer anything, but I let it go.



“The folks at the diner said you covered my meal,” I said.



“Wellers takes care of his guests,” he responded and grinned. That grin again, it felt off. Like he imitated it from people he watched, rather than actually feeling anything. He then motioned to the doors and opened them for me. “Shall we?”



As I stepped foot into the building, I almost had a double-take. It was beautiful. The lobby was lit by crystal chandeliers, with red velvet carpets adorning every footstep. The walls were paneled with dark, polished wood that reflected so much light that it hurt to look at for too long. But then we entered the concert hall.



You know that show *Dr. Who*? The hall was like the TARDIS. Massive. Bigger than it should be, judging by the size of the building from the outside. Rows upon rows of empty seats faced the stage. There laid upon it, like the crown jewel of the town, was the piano. A black lacquer, full grand, in perfect condition. It was like it was never played, but still waiting for centuries to perform.



It wasn’t Claire’s piano, I knew that for sure. But something about it seemed so familiar, so comforting. It simultaneously raised the hair on my arms and made my heart skip a beat.



I stepped toward it slowly. 



“She’s a piece of beauty,” Wellers said behind me. “Specially made for this hall.”



“She looks…” I paused, searching for the right word. “Hungry.”



He chuckled softly. “Music’s always been a hungry thing. Takes what you give it. Sometimes more.”



There was something in his voice. It had a weight to it, a surety. Maybe it was grief. Like he was mourning something yet to happen.



I turned to face him. “You sound like you’re giving a eulogy.”



“Do I?” he said, smooth as ever.



I blinked. That struck me wrong.



“You.. usually refer to yourself in the third person,” I said. “But just this moment, you didn't.""



He paused, then smiled and said, “Mr. Wellers finds it…easier that way. Keeps things separate.”



I was about to question him on that, but he quickly gestured towards the piano and said, “You’ll have time to prepare. The recital is tomorrow”



“You sure? It doesn’t look like anyone usually comes.” I turned towards the empty rows of seats. But out of the corner of my eye, I saw something. A flash of color. A flicker of blue in the far corner of the front row. But the instant I looked directly at it…there was nothing there.

He said “well, I miss the good old days, when people weren’t all addicted to technology” and I was like “yea, I can understand that” then went back to studying and gave him the benefit of the doubt, thinking he was a bored lonely older man who felt nostalgic about his youth.

I know every disclaimer there is of having a mal- he is my third one. Long story short: got my first one when I was 20. He was 4 and a k9 dropout. He raised me into adulthood and taught me to love the breed. I rescued my second. She was my first one that was “raw”. Both sadly passed away within two months of each other- him to old age, her to lymphoma. Trauma. 

Enter third mal. He came from the same place my first one came from. He was only 1.5 so not as heavily trained but vetted with a foundation. I’ve had him 1.5 years now. He is 3. He is great - a headache, has more drive than I’m used to, but I adapt, he gets out a lot, hiking, lots of obedience training etc. This last year, however, he has started to be reactive towards anything on wheels (not cars thank god). Skateboards, bikes, rollerblades. I live in a city with food delivery robots. It all just started one day and I guess now I’m entering the acceptance of “I have a reactive dog”. 

I guess I just need advice- is this forever? I don’t know why it started, it just started one day with skateboards (I think it’s the sound?) and escalated. I live in a city so I can’t predict what we might encounter but it’s really bringing me down. I used to bring him with me everywhere (coffee shop, happy hour, etc) but now I’m scared to. Which I hate. Idk. 

I have a trainer, an idea of how to approach this, but I think I’m just overwhelmed with the possibility that he could forever be lunging at a bike that passes by that I had no idea was coming. 

I just want him to be safe and no one to come for us. There is already a stigma to having a dog that looks like him, one bark at the wrong person and yikes. I don’t want to think about it. ",2,1750821064.0,reactivedogs,2,1.0,False

**Liberia – Meztli Coffee House**

We stayed in Liberia the night we flew in (Hampton Guanacaste Airport Hotel), and found a great coffee house next door. I stopped in for an evening espresso and was blown away. Came back the next morning and was treated to a bright Anaeróbico Costa Rican pour-over. Great coffee, good vibes. Totally unexpected next to the airport hotel. Walked away with a bag of Dulce Tropical beans.

*Side Note: Snagged an iced coffee from Café Macadamia en route to La Fortuna.*

**La Fortuna – Red Frog**

What can I say that hasn’t been said about Red Frog? We spent 3 nights in La Fortuna, and Red Frog was our home base. It was my first time being introduced to the chorreador, the traditional Costa Rican pour-over. They roast their beans in-house, and the coffee was incredible. The food was great too! Bought two bags of beans — one of their lighter roasted honey processed, and one bag of the Geisha roast (the roaster’s pride and joy).

*Another cup of coffee from Café Macadamia on our pass to Monteverde.*

— — —

**Monteverde – Don Juan Coffee Roasters**

Spent a wonderful Father’s Day at the Don Juan chocolate & coffee tour. I’m not gonna lie, I was a bit dismissive going in given that it was a tour, but I was wonderfully surprised by the experience. The tour was more geared toward their chocolate production, but they went into depth on their coffee production as well. I would recommend the tour — friendly and knowledgeable guides and really good coffee (and exceptional chocolate). Came away with two bags of coffee (one honey processed, one washed) and three bars of dark chocolate.

— — —

**Tamarindo – Nórdico Coffee Roasters**

We ended our trip in Tamarindo. Yes, it is exactly as everyone says… a touristy city full of gift shops and kitschy restaurants. We still found it charming (the night market was great), and managed to find a terrific coffee roaster in town. Very cool café, and great coffee! They prepared most of the cups using a ceramic pour-over coffee pot. Came home with a Geisha Red Honey roast from the West Valley.

It was a trip of a lifetime! We obviously enjoyed so much more than just the coffee, but it was a great experience seeking out local cups and enjoying the culture through their dedication to the craft.

I’m on try I don’t even know how many. I CAN moderate in social settings when I need to.

That wasn’t what I was planning today. I really, REALLY wanted to feel better, different. I wanted to drink in isolation and clean my house. It’s a wreck.

I was dependent on marijuana which really really helped-until it didn’t. I developed CHS and had my first hyperemetic episode (constant puking, needing IV fluids, etc) a little over a month ago. I quit everything (again) then.

I won’t go into the sob story im dealing with today. I had plenty of excuses.

But I just don’t want to hear it from my husband. While he was at work today I was at the bank. It was nice out. I thought hm I could just pop into (neighborhood bar) for a couple and that would be nice. But I’m scared of only having a couple without marijuana to get me through the tail end of drinking, so I didn’t.

Then later while I was walking my dog I decided to wait until my husband went to bed (I work nights, off today, and he’s up early so no big) then I’d go grab myself something and go into what I call gremlin mode, when I just stay up and drink and organize or clean or listen to music, whatever.

But he took FOREVER to fall asleep. And I started crying and he was really sweet to me, and then I made some coffee and was going to put some amaretto in it but I couldn’t reach the too shelf without a ladder, so I sat outside and drank some plain coffee and realized I didn’t want to drink alcohol anymore.

We just got home from an incredible trip to Costa Rica, and I did my best to seek out some great coffee along our route. Thought I would share some of my finds with y’all!



**Liberia – Meztli Coffee House**

We stayed in Liberia the night we flew in (Hampton Guanacaste Airport Hotel), and found a great coffee house next door. I stopped in for an evening espresso and was blown away. Came back the next morning and was treated to a bright Anaeróbico Costa Rican pour-over. Great coffee, good vibes. Totally unexpected next to the airport hotel. Walked away with a bag of Dulce Tropical beans.

*Side Note:* Snagged an iced coffee from Café Macadamia en route to La Fortuna.

**La Fortuna – Red Frog**

What can I say that hasn’t been said about Red Frog? We spent 3 nights in La Fortuna, and Red Frog was our home base. It was my first time being introduced to the *chorreador*, the traditional Costa Rican pour-over. They roast their beans in-house, and the coffee was incredible. The food was great too! Bought two bags of beans — one of their lighter roasted honey processed, and one bag of the Geisha roast (the roaster’s pride and joy).

Another cup of coffee from Café Macadamia on our pass to Monteverde.

**Monteverde – Don Juan Coffee Roasters**

Spent a wonderful Father’s Day at the Don Juan chocolate & coffee tour. I’m not gonna lie, I was a bit dismissive going in given that it was a tour, but I was wonderfully surprised by the experience. The tour was more geared toward their chocolate production, but they went into depth on their coffee production as well. I would recommend the tour — friendly and knowledgeable guides and really good coffee (and exceptional chocolate). Came away with two bags of coffee (one honey processed, one washed) and three bars of dark chocolate.

— — —

**Tamarindo – Nórdico Coffee Roasters**

We ended our trip in Tamarindo. Yes, it is exactly as everyone says… a touristy city full of gift shops and kitschy restaurants. We still found it charming (the night market was great), and managed to find a terrific coffee roaster in town. Very cool café, and great coffee! They prepared most of the cups using a ceramic pour-over coffee pot. Came home with a Geisha Red Honey roast from the West Valley.

—

It was a trip of a lifetime! We obviously enjoyed so much more than just the coffee, but it was a great experience seeking out local cups and enjoying the culture through their dedication to the craft.

However, main focal point of post, how did people feel about the food? 

Obviously there is nostalgia of island noodles, and some comfort foods, but high-level here are my thoughts:

Select dishes:  

-super fruit smoothies- da bomb. You can ask for all three flavors for a “fuck me up” version 
-bob’s falafel bowl- a staple with my food allergies, but the falafel was under cooked everytime
-vegan horchata ice cream was not for me, but appreciated the option 

Cost: 
- we know it’s premium at a music festival but $24 for meal hurt

Locations/access: food options all over, including pizza and easy meals on the go. 

Food Options/Variety: 
-nice variety of noodle dishes, bowls, meat plates, pizza, and healthish veggie bowls 
- some places had vegan meat options, but it was far more common for it to be impossible burger instead of beyond
-pop-up coffee shop outside of festival- inconsistent counter service (are you taking orders on both sides?! inconsistent) ice latte options were nice/not too overpriced. 

Service: 10/10 nice folks and very open to questions

Failed EF/PSMF, now trying ADF. Logging & looking for support 🙏","Quick stats
-----------
• F | 30 y | 5'1"" / 156 cm  
• 134 lb / 61 kg — ~28 % body-fat (visual)  
• Strict carnivore ~4 months  
• Lifting heavy 3×/wk  
  – Leg press 400 lb / 180 kg  
  – Squat 135 lb / 60 kg  
  – Deadlift 90 lb / 40 kg  
• Daily cardio: 30-40 min stationary bike  
  + 8–10 k steps 4-5×/wk  
• Goal: ≤ 20 % BF before prep for a natural fitness (bikini/figure) show

What I’ve tried & why it tanked
-------------------------------
1. **Extended fasting (3-5 d)**  
   • By day 2: freezing, frustrated, break fast with broth & meat.  
2. **Carnivore PSMF (egg-white shakes + very lean meat)**  
   • Energy crashed, raging carb cravings & binge urges (had none before).  
   • Back to high-fat carnivore → cravings gone, but weight still flat.  
3. **Dairy** → instant water retention, so I try to avoid but slip sometimes.

Why ADF?
--------
Need a “just survive 24 h” mindset instead of 3-5 days. Plan:  
• **Fast day** → water, salt, coffee + beef tallow (<150 kcal, zero carbs)  
• **Feed day** → Lion diet (2 meals, only ruminant meat/organs/eggs, no dairy)  
• Repeat for 2 weeks, measure after my period (~4 July).

1. Anyone doing ADF **plus** heavy lifting on carnivore—tips?

3. Best progress metrics you’ve used (pics, tape, HRV, whatever).

I’m looking forward to your feedback.

Here’s current situation:
-Blue rug is temp, only there to keep coffee table from sliding/scuffing floor. It will go away.
-I really am trying to have a colorful/organic shapes/sculptural/boho/eclectic/Anthropologie/urban outfitters home vibe and have just had a really hard time settling on a Moroccan rug  (space needs 8x10 or 8x11.) 
-I do plan on eventually swapping out papasan and butterfly chair for a green velvet couch but that is currently not in my budget.
-I am open to changing curtains, they do not have to stay yellow. 
-I do plan on adding gallery art wall and more ambient lighting.
-I want fun earthy tones but I’m concerned I’m going to have to much pinky colors in my home, I really like rug number one which is more peachy burnt then like a pepto bismol pink but I’m trying to make sure it’s actually aesthetic or do I need more color variation. 
-I also included in the last pic a swatch of all the other colors around my home..a lot of iridescent, purple, pink, green. 
-don’t judge my 32 in tv I know it’s tiny 🥺

Please give me your honest opinions I’ve been struggling trying to pick something for months now. I started with the idea of a bold patterned rug but then I was like maybe solid color long term is better and easier to change furniture with. I’m open for any suggestions. I just really like the Moroccan Beni Ourain, Azilal, Berber look. I’m open to ideas, I do prefer wool rug suggestions for durability.

1ljuk4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1ljuk4z/which_layout_is_better/,Which layout is better?,"Layout 1 with the fridge on the sink wall keeps our existing doors/windows in place and I think might have a better work triangle. The issue is that the tall window next to the pantries is only 20"" from the back wall, so the pantries will all have to be modified to 18"" depth which I'm afraid will look dumb next to our fridge. Also there's just a lot of floor space wasted due to the large window that goes nearly to the floor (this used to be the dining nook). 

Layout 2 with the fridge across from the edge of the peninsula would require us to close up the current back door (which goes to the side yard and looks straight into the neighbor's kitchen door), shorten the large window to create a coffee bar/microwave area, and install a new french door leading to the backyard. The biggest benefit to this layout is that we'd get a backyard view and lots of southern light (the small kitchen window is the only south window in the entire house). My house is very dark right now with mostly north windows so that would be fantastic. We would also have a good place for the microwave that I don't think I could fit otherwise.   
  
I am worried that the fridge being across from the peninsula will create a chokepoint though. There would be 45"" from the front of the fridge to the peninsula edge. Also obviously moving doors would require a lot more work and money, new siding etc. And the fridge would be pretty far away from the stove/sink (the room is 16ft long and 11ft wide). 

The door in the dining room is our front door so I'm also considering what the view will be for people entering... either looking directly at the front of the fridge or the side.

Plot: jk is in an abusive relationship with suga but falls in love with v (why exactly was I reading this?… lmao).
I only remember details of the beginning of the story: chapter 1 starts with jungkook sitting in a coffee shop (of course), looking out of the window and observing the falling snowflakes. He was described as being sad or angry I think and after leaving he meets Taehyung for the first time who’s outside locking his bicycle (?). Jk keeps coming back to the coffe shop and they eventually become close. Problem is he’s in a relationship with Yoongi. Their relationship is toxic and abusive and jk tries to leave. Yoongi gets extremely angry but eventually lets him go (i think?). From this part on I sadly don’t remember how the story continued.

https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/9mzk6Z8myi

It has been days of work; I have been working tirelessly for hours. The pumps seem to have a rhythm to them. Every twelve hours or so many of the pumps need to be cleaned. The only upside to this routine is for half the day I am free to rest or explore my confines. Factorium is set up in a messy but somewhat organized way. I am calling its unorthodox style to be organized chaos. The smoke gets worse as the machines near their cleaning schedule. Every day I am consistently buying inhalers, the single token cost tasting bitter in my mouth. I'm averaging about 8 tokens per day. 

The steep cost of water and food has prevented me from unlocking the bunks. I'm spending 6 tokens a day just to get enough to eat and drink. I'm able to save 1 token per day to add to my savings. I have started using the coffee pot in the breakroom to store my extra tokens. The pot sit’s bright yellow like a hanging sun, causing an uplifting mood in the dreary atmosphere of the Factorium.

Unsure if I should spend my savings on gloves or on unlocking the door to the Bunks. I decided instead to save as many of the tokens as I could skipping meals and adding to my stash in a hope to buy them both simultaneously. The couch in the break room had become my unofficial bed and I had spent the long nights scrunched up on its dirty cushions knowing at least forty-one other people had done the same in my position.

The break room was clean now earning me some tokens, which I spent on some dried meat and water. The more expensive foods and drinks were still outside of my price range. Overseer had slowly become my greatest ally, his warnings were abrupt, but he seemed to genuinely care about me in an offhand sort of way. If I was a part of Factorium, I would receive his full attention for even the smallest of questions. 

Over the days I was working I came to find what I had dubbed the sludge river on the floor below. Through the machines I found a metal staircase that descended to the lower floor. Making sense of my other task to unblock the grates. The sludge river was black and acrid, a thick slurry of the material that was being pumped through the derricks. The smell was enough to gag me as I waided knee deep into the black river to pull away the solid material that blocked the grate. 

I managed to lug the bucket up the stairs full and deposited it in the chute for the extra tokens. While a dirtier job, it was considerably easier work, I also didn’t have to add another cut to my fingers. By now my fingers were wrapped in old pieces of cloth I had found around Factorium. I had tried to wash them with water but they had kept my fingers from the worst of the cuts. 

My daily routine was enough to keep me busy and docile. Soon I had saved up ten of the yellow tokens in the coffee pot, I decided today would be the day that I would unlock the Break Room and purchase a pair of the work gloves that had taunted me on the vending machine screen for too long. It was a personal victory day, and I expressed as much to Overseer as I removed my makeshift bandages and placed the sturdy leather gloves on my sore fingers. The material was warm and would last against the sharpness of the gears. 

“Pretty snazzy right?” I asked to the screen on the wall.

A large smiley face graced the screen and Overseer even winked at me. 

“Looking good stud. Congratulations are in order for this big day.” Overseer wrote on the wall, making digital fireworks explode on the screen.

The PDA on my wrist chimed loudly signalling the start of my day, I glanced at the Bunks door and sighed my frustration.

“I’ll be back.” I said to the door and headed to the pumps.

I finished my tasks early, Overseer praising me on my newfound efficiency due to my protected hands. The machines had considerably less buildup if they were maintained properly and daily. I found it harder and harder to maintain my eight tokens a day. Today I had only managed to gross seven of the brightly coloured tokens. 

“You are doing well 42. I would like to report an 8% increase in production since you had taken over maintenance.

“Goody for that, but higher production means lower tokens in my pocket.” I replied while emptying another bucket into the chute.

A yellow token fell Into the bowl and I placed it in my pocket. That was the last bucketful for the day and I retreated to the breakroom my lungs feeling heavy and clogged. 

I entered the Break Room and went to the vending machine to purchase my daily inhaler. I quickly slid my token in and pressed the inhaler, my chest wheezing as the machine turned red, rejecting my offer. With surprise I glanced at the screen noticing lots of items in the machine had doubled in price. 

“What the hell Overseer? You’re charging me double?” I asked angrily towards my PDA.

“It is a standard raise of the rates; the prices increase or decrease depending on the availability of the items. As I am sure you haven't noticed the price of gloves has dropped to only two tokens. Ha ha. “Overseer wrote on my wrist PDA following it up with a silly looking smiley face.

“Great.” I muttered slamming another token into the machine and dispensing the green inhaler, furious that Overseer had lowered the price now that the demand was non-existent.

This was getting ridiculous, I had to find a way to get more tokens easier. I would work myself into an early grave at this rate. The sludge river grates only clogged every three days. Those two tokens plus the eight I earned daily was not going to cut it if food or water went any higher. Bread was still only one token but water had raised to two tokens in these recent changes.

 Uncertain now if I should spend the five tokens on the Bunks door, I relented and deposited my five hard earned tokens into the slot beside the door. With a loud clunk the door popped open, the hinges creaking from lack of use as I entered the Bunks.

The room was surprisingly large with a series of six military style cots. Each had a thin blanket and pillow folded at the end of each bed. The room also came with a large comfy looking armchair one would find next to a fireplace, in front of it was an old-style TV where the back was large and full of complex tubes. A small hallway intersected down at the far side of the room, and I examine the three doors that were held in it. Toilet, Showers, and VIP Lounge were the three additional rooms, costing two, three, and twenty tokens respectively. 

As I returned to the bunk room, my head started to swim. The deep green of the material sending waves of deja vu, forcing me to one knee flashbacks began to surge through as if unbidden like a flood gate opening. Memories of myself entering a long camo tent, dog tags hanging from my neck, running through the forest with men dressed in military uniforms, carrying rifles. Before my PDA chimed happily and I noticed that my tasks had been updated dragging me away from my memories.

1. Maintain all the pumps. Each bucket of sludge removed from the gears and deposited into the chute will receive one token. You need to pull the handle to pause the machine for fifteen seconds. 

2. Unblock the grate, that supplies the liquid into the pipes. You will receive two tokens once the grates have been cleared.

3.  Open the doorway down in the sub-basement, once you enter you shall receive further information. You will receive 5 tokens for completing this task.

“What is this third task Overseer? Are you being obtuse for a reason?” I asked as I shook my head trying to clear the images from my past, for some reason they scared me. I knew they were going to be something intense, something I didn’t want to remember.

“It is a delicate matter, normally the doorway in the sub-basement is not opened or even made aware of to the workers of Factorium, but I fear there is a matter that must be dealt with post haste.” Overseer explained.

“A delicate matter? What does that even mean?”

“Please retrieve the free tool from the vending machine, and make your way to the sub-basement, once you arrive alert me and I shall provide further instruction on how to enter the room and how to proceed within expectations.” Overseer responded avoiding the question.

“What do you mean alert you? Don’t you have my position on a GPS through this PDA?” I asked as I reached into the vending machine removing a red handled screwdriver. It was a flat head, and I smiled at the many uses it would provide me with. 

“Negative, unfortunately any form of tracking is impossible within Factorium. It is a safety feature we employ to prevent any form of infiltration or mapping. Either of those is a serious issue that will be faced with retribution.” Overseer responded, remarking on the word retribution once again.

I made my way down the rickety staircase towards the sub-basement, the sludge river as I had dubbed it moved dangerously through the grates, its opaque blackness sending shivers down my spine, the smell of it once had made me gag but after weeks of working in it, I feared I was going nose blind to the scent.

“Okay I am here, where is the door?” I asked my PDA.

As I asked a section of the concrete wall seemingly popped open, upon further inspection I noticed a small set of hinges set into the stone and a small rectangular keyhole. With much effort I forced the door open wide, flooding the inky blackness of the room behind with the industrial orange glow of the sub-basement behind me.

“Overseer, it’s too dark, are there no lights?” I asked.

“One moment.” Overseer responded, after a few seconds orange lights in the dark began to flicker on and off before a large spotlight lit up the room, I covered my eyes against the bright light noticing my eyes had trouble adjusting after living in such low light for so long.

The room that lay before me was mind altering, it was small but large. Sections of it seemed to fall away from my vision, every time I tried to focus on the areas of interest the others would fall away as if hiding from my sight. I took cautious steps into the gloom, feeling a heaviness descend over me. Something about this room felt wrong, but something else about it felt familiar as if I had been here before, as if this was something I had seen in a previous life.

In the center of the room was a large jet-black object, hoses came and went from it in a seemingly random fashion, it seemed to pulse as if breathing or beating. As I stepped closer and closer I could feel it syncing up with my own heartbeat, a humming in my ears as if the whole world was vibrating. I reached my hand out, wanting to touch the blackened heart, my fingers seeking the softness of its edges.

My PDA chimed on my wrist breaking whatever spell the heart had placed upon me, my heart seemed to skip a beat as I jumped in fright.

“42.” Overseer wrote.

“Yes, yes I am here.” I said not taking my eyes off the black orb. “What is this thing?”

“This is the heart of Factorium, the reason why we both do as we do. But that is not why I have called you into this room. Please avert your eyes and proceed deeper into the chamber. Upon the ground you shall find the real reason why I have sent you here.” Overseer wrote, allowing me a moment respite from the pounding of the heart.

With much difficulty I was able to pull my eyes away and make my way to the far side of the room, upon the ground was a rather large vent. Pressed against it was a rough looking green fabric. My PDA rang quietly as Overseer explained.

“This is blocking the air vent, please remove the grate with the provided screwdriver and remove it. Dump the item down the chute to receive your 5 tokens.” 

I began to remove the vent grating curious as to what this material blocking it was, the few probes with the screwdriver let me know the object was solid, but with give under my sharp prods. As the vent gave way, a wave of rotting flesh overtook me. Like something had died in the vent and was slowly decomposing in a rebellious way. With a sharp tug, I began to pull at the green fabric. The object was heavy and awkward to pull up, with some straining I managed to pull it free, its sudden release making me fall backwards as the object fell ontop of me. The green canvas material pulling free as I fell.

On top of me was a decaying corpse, still fresh but with a pungent odor, the peeling skin looked red and angry, it was an older man with a large handlebar mustache. His face was twisted in anger and fury as if he died fighting to escape. His last moments painted on his face, all to surreal as I shoved him off. I felt fear and disgust but the body more frightened me.

 I felt as though somewhere in my past I had seen lots of bodies, I felt desensitized and empty as I stood and regarded the man’s green canvas jacket. A few stripes of yellow on the arm of his jacket made me realize he had been in the army, maybe a commando. My mind was fuzzy as I pulled him from the room, determined to move him to the chute. 

As I passed by the beating heart of Factorium dragging the decaying corpse by one of his legs. My PDA chimed loudly, without a glance I continued on my way, the heart had a way of making me feel odd. Its pulsing and vibrating seemed to dig deeper into my brain with every second. My chest felt tight as I passed the heart, my PDA chimed again shrilly as if warning me against something.

 Ignoring the PDA in my haste to escape I pulled the body through the door into the sub basement, but the man’s arm got caught on the inside of the door as if he were holding on, not wanting to leave the room. I pulled and pulled my back towards the black sludge river, my hands gripping his black military boots as I yanked him one last time hearing the sickening snap of bones breaking in the door frame.

Something was wrong I fell backwards, my head feeling light and distant as something overcame me. The blackened heart in the other room pulsed sending a shockwave of black ink cascading from it in all directions as if purging itself of evil. The blast took me in the chest, knocking me free of the corpse and the ground. With a loud splash I fell into the black sludge, my mind racing as I fought to the surface. My lungs and mouth filling with the foul smelling and tasting liquid. As I surfaced, I coughed spitting out the intruder into my mouth.

But I wasn’t in Factorium anymore, as I broke the surface I was in a river of water surrounded by jungle. A blast of memories flooding to me in a real way, my rifle in my hands I fought out of the cascading torrent, pulling a smaller but similarly dressed young man out of the water and pushing him to the ground as gun shots sounded overhead. I dropped to one knee firing my rifle as grey clad soldiers surrounded us. My rifle taking many down as I stood overwatch over my unconscious comrade, he looked so familiar, but I couldn't place him, my silver dog tags swinging in my battle fury as I fought my way forward from the river's edge dragging the other soldier behind me.

I stumbled forward, my feet giving out beneath me as I returned to the dim and oppressive Factorium. My knees slammed hard into the metal of the staircase, I could hardly breathe or see. My face and clothes were covered in the black sludge of the river, my PDA chimed wildly turning red and flashing. 

“42, what happened? You should have heeded my warnings; the heart was going to purge after the vent was cleared.” Overseer wrote.

“Damn...” Was all I said before my stomach retched.

Black liquid poured out of me, pooling around my feet as I emptied my stomach. I felt nauseous and sick as I tried to crawl up the stairs, my PDA chiming loudly as I ignored it. My vision swam and I closed my eyes for a moment, my face resting on the landing to the main floor. The cool metal felt nice as I slipped into a fever fueled nightmare.


Death followed me, everywhere I went. A destroyer of worlds, a destroyer of people. Flashes of my past echoed through my dreams. People’s faces, locations, the things I had done were unsurmountable. Why was I seeing these things. What was going on.

A chiming filled my ears, piercing through the dream like memories, my eyes opening against my protests as the PDA filled my vision with flashing red lights. Unable to push it away I rose to my knees, my body aching from the place I had collapsed. 

“42, the pumps are in need of repair, no less than eight of them need to be serviced, respond immediately or face retribution.”

“I feel sick I can’t do it.” I said gaining my feet under me, shaking from head to toe as my body rebelled from the foreign substance in my body.

“You are not allowed to be sick, the pumps must be maintained. Please service the pumps within fifteen minutes or face retribution.” Overseer wrote starting a timer on my PDA.

I ignored my PDA uncaring about what retribution would be in Overseers eyes, I needed to get to the bunks and buy the shower room, the black sludge still covered my body, and I could feel it sinking into my pores clogging them with disease.

I staggered into the bunks, the coffee pot full of my tokens in hand. I dropped the pot as I tripped over one of the beds, the glass smashing against the ground scattering the yellow tokens all over the floor. I scooped up just enough tokens to pay for the shower room and slid them into the slot trying to keep myself from passing out again.

The sludge I had swallowed seems to have entered my system; it was a thousand times worse than the smoke inhalation sickness. As the door to the showers opened, I was greeted by a relatively small room, the shower took up more than half the room and a broken mirror graced the chipped tile wall painted a sickening green colour. I stepped into the dirty glass shower and began the water, ice cold it came out but soon warmed up as I let it soak into my clothes and hair. The water came away black and circled the drain for a moment before disappearing.

“Just another grate for me to unclog.” I said out loud as my PDA pinged angrily in the background.

“42, you have ignored my request to service the pumps. Punishment must follow.” Overseer wrote as the water in the shower suddenly stopped.

“I can barely stand. How can I service the pumps?” I said as I left the shower still soaking wet from head to toe, heading to one of the bunks and collapsing in a heap, my body worn out as it fought of the infection, I was sure that was growing inside of me.

“You have forced my hand due to your inaction. All the tokens you have currently saved are now useless, by my estimate you are currently holding on to no more than eleven extra tokens. That amount has been requested to be deposited into the vending machine before you may purchase anything. An additional 50 token debt has been added to you as well for medicine given despite the lack of need for it.” 

“What medicine?” I asked my head still reeling.

A few moments later the PDA pinged once more the screen potraying a medical crest as pain lanced up my arm from under the PDA, I felt a series of needles piercing my skin making me scream in shock as I convulsed on the bunk. Surprisingly after a few minutes I felt myself feeling better before my stomach convulsed angrily and I felt my body reject the black sludge. I leaned over the edge of the bunk and vomited up pure black until my body shook with the effort. 

“You had this medicine the whole time?” I asked angrily in disbelief, my trust of Overseer breaking instantly.

“This medicine is highly reactive and expensive, the PDA only has one injection. It is normally used for serious cases of the ingestion of the material. While a decent fuel it has been known to be fatal for workers who have ingested or breathed in too many fumes. It is why we supply workers with inhalers to keep them healthy and happy. Ha ha.”

I got to my feet feeling a hundred pounds lighter but as if I had been injected with energy. Despite my trepidation with Overseer and my now unsurmountable debt. I opened the door to Factorium. Smoke and noise greeted me as I picked up my steel bucket. Red lights flashed over the machines, and I made my way down into the bowels. After I finished my routine and earned a few tokens, I returned to the sludge river. 

The door leading to the heart was securely closed. The man’s corpse was half in the sludge river, and it took some maneuvering to drag him up the steel staircase. I propped him against the wall next to the chute. My hands searching his body for anything of value, it felt as though I had done this before, and my hands made quick work. I took his green canvas jacket with thoughts to wash it. I checked his wrists but was surprised when I found a smashed PDA on his wrist. On the back of his left hand was an inky black tattoo. The number 40 as prominent as the 42 on my hand. I took one last look at his face, its rough features, thick handlebar mustache, his long mangy tousle of hair, and I let him go. 

Five tokens dropping wordlessly into the slot for my black deed.

* Do most of you use separate tools for payroll and accounting?
* Is there anything you wish your current setup did better?
* Are HR features like time-off tracking worth paying extra for?

Yesterday I went to give offerings. to Mr. Zeus and Lady Athena I gave peanuts, to Mr. Apollo I gave herbal tea that I grow in my backyard.

I left the offerings on the altar, but at the time I remembered ""hmm, it's the solstice, right? Maybe I should let my cats in so they can play or participate in this"".

so I left my bedroom door open and quickly left to turn off something in the kitchen. 

IT WAS A MATTER OF SECONDS! 
My coffee cat was on top of Mr Zeus's altar! At the time I tried to get him out, but I didn't expect him to move, trying to free himself and then giving the peanut offering a little kick, knocking him down.

The room was filled with cats, making a total of 6. 
3 eating the peanuts or others were just playing. 

I just sat on the floor watching that chaos of cats and thinking ""the gods must be laughing or irritated""  

After a while I got up the courage and took the cats out of the room and apologized for the chaos.

I still try to keep it upright if it is coffee, but if it is water I can peacefully just throw it in a bag and not worry.

It keeps tempratures so well. Cold drinks stay cold for so long it is incredible. Hot drinks stay hot, for well, too long honestly 😂. I miss that about my cheaper thermos mugs. In the costco one I could pour hot coffee in and 15mins later I could drink the coffee fairly quick because it cooled down so much.

I want to make it clear straight out of the blocks that this is a video showing the magic in The Philippines - not some trashy vlog talking bad about the country that so many foreigners seem to be making for unbeknownst reasons. Anyway, I really want to show the beauty of this area in the video, HOWEVER, I'm missing one key component - a drone! So, I'm really wondering about a big favour from any local drone pilots who maybe just have any redundant footage laying around that they'd be happy to share and let me use for the purpose of, as I say, showcasing Daraga, Mayon and Bicol in general. This would be a huge help to me and greatly appreciated - flying over the town, over the church, around Mayon - whatever it is, anything would be a great addition to help me make this video. If this is you and you can and would like to help, give me a shout and I'd love to grab a beer or a coffee! For anyone else, thanks for you attention! Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!

My wife (35) and I (35) are going to be staying at Barceló Maya Riviera from July 3rd - 8th and then at a hotel in PDC proper from the 8th - 13th. We don’t really plan on leaving the resort during the first leg of our stay that much unless someone has a recommendation for something cool to do near there. We are open! 

BUT we definitely need recommendations for our stay in PDC. We are big foodies and enjoy some nightlife here and there. We want to do some excursions and we plan to rent a car for the portion of our trip in PDC. We would love to see some cenotes, ruins, do one ATV excursion, and maybe something on a boat with snorkeling. 

I have read other threads that recommend Coda vs Tulum. We speak the language and are comfortable driving and exploring without needing guides or handholding but we are open to paid tours, etc if it is a good experience for a good price. Would also LOVE some of the best places to eat and get coffee in PDC. At least one super nice restaurant night out and 1-2 nights of good clubs or bars would be great. 

Lastly, we also want to do a day in Isla Mujeres and maybe go to Cozumel. Any recommendations for that are greatly appreciated as well. 

Anyone traveling there these days? Could also meet up with other travelers maybe.
