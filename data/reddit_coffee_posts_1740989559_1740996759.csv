I have had an account with Up for 4 years now and genuinely can’t fault them at all, there’s no fees to hold or create an account, so you don’t have to fully co-opt their system or switch to it as your main bank. You can just make the account, make yourself some money (with my link ;) )and be done with it!

- Quick customer service when nearby areas were having network issues, etc.
- Only 5 minutes to set up an account via their app straight from your phone! So no need to visit a branch and take time out of your busy day
- Ability to create multiple ‘savers’ accounts to visualise your money better, and a respectable interest rate on up to five of these (calculated daily and distributed monthly)

At the moment there’s a promo if you sign up using an existing customer’s referral link - **we both get an instant $14!** For practically no work at all! That’s a boost on groceries (or cheeky bevvy) right there.

They also do ‘Random Acts of Free Coffee’ on weekdays (7am-11am) and ‘Happy Hour’ on Friday (5pm-7pm), where there’s a chance they’ll cover the cost of a food or drink purchase for you!

P.S. For those concerned, Up Bank is backed by Bendigo Bank, so there is some good ‘real bank’ security behind their systems too 😚

1j2fh97,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1j2fh97/we_broke_up_a_month_ago_feeling_empty_and_hurt/,We broke up a month ago... feeling empty and hurt,"Met this girl, we were in same college club, used to talk here and there, then talked more. Seemed a good person overall, thought she was mature. Told her that I like her and asked her out.

She said she needed some time to think. I told her I'm gonna wait a couple of months for her answer if she doesn't bring it up, I'll take it as a no. She said if she says no I'll stop talking to her or not talk as much as I do now, for which I said not to worry as I won't do that.

Fast forward a month, on new year's topic came up once again an she said she's interested and would like to be in relationship. I think from my side it was going all good. We went on dates, used to help her with coding and stuff, complemented her whenever I got chance. I knew she was insecure of her looks so I always tried to put in extra compliments for her, now that I think about it I don't think she ever complimented me. She wasn't best in the communication/confrontation part, I always encouraged her to speak her mind and be as transparent as possible with each other. 

My branch is the most hectic in the uni, morning 8 to 6 evening, gym then I've intern work after that, would still find out time for her to ask how her day's been. My mess is just below my hostel but she's been alloted different mess, so even in extreme winters went to other side of campus so I can eat with her. Went on coffee dates around campus (yk the funny part is? I don't even like coffee but she likes it very much, I was happy that I get to spend time with her. I would purposely drink the coffee as slow as possible to stretch the walk)

I went to Cigarettes after Sex concert, I had two tickets but she couldn't go so I went on my own. Brought a pretty light up feather tiara for her from the concert. Gave her my Perks of being a wallflower book, wrote messages for her inside (she didn't return that yet btw). Was already planning for valentines and her birthday... 

We had fest recently in college, we were dancing in the fest together, her in my arms, holding hands, both were somewhat drunk. At one point she had tears in her eyes while we were swaying with her in my arms, I wiped her tears with my hands and told her I'll wipe her tears anytime she feels down... We had a lot of fun, I shouted in her ears that this is best day of my life and she shouted that she liked me. I thought finally I can see this going long term. I mean who would not?

Then next day I ask her if she remembers her saying that she likes me (bc she hadn't said that before). She said that she meant that she likes me a lot as a FRIEND. I was like wtf is this girl talking about??? 😭 😭 Girl we are literally dating and in a relationship, what are you saying. I later texted her saying I was very hurt by her saying this. Then she says that she considers all what we did is what friends do (I mean seriously?) , she doesn't want a label, blah blah , you deserve someone better, yada yada, you know the classic. Then she says I'm not her priority and don't put enough effort for her because I don't talk all the time with her, she want someone who's talking to her 24x7 and is obsessed (she never bothers to initiate the convo tho anytime). I thought I was in a mature relationship where we understood we had other things to work on to secure our future while also taking out time for each other. 

I was so hurt, still am. For her it was just another friendship but I feel emotionally cheated and betrayed. She said she talked more to other people(guys) than me. Idk what's that supposed to mean? 😭 As if I'm not hurt already enough. I asked her why, she could've talked to me, I enjoyed talking with her. She said, because they talked with her that's why. Girl doesn't know how to set boundaries 😭, at that point I realised everything was just from my side, I never meant anything to her. I felt so disrespected. I literally couldn't eat for two days, everyone asks me why I look so depressed, I guess I'm bad at hiding my emotions. You know you're cooked when your eyes search for her in the crowd and you see her in dreams. She said we'd be best friends, after that she never bothered texting me. I thought I'll stop texting first to see if she ever takes initiative, she never did. Today she walked by infront of me in cafeteria, totally ignored me, not even a greeting. Best friends my ass, her words hold no value. I can't understand how can people switch up so quickly. 

I just wanted a normal relationship where I feel valued and wanted for once in my life. Guess that's too much... I don't want to feel this emotionally disrespected in my life ever again. Everyday I wake up and it hurts so much, I try to keep myself as busy as possible so I don't have time to think about it. It's better if I give up on love altogether. Throughout my life I've been told by multiple women that any girl would be lucky to have me, I'm so perfect and things along those lines but now I feel all those were lies and I'm being clowned. Whatever man... I'll focus on my grind, building my garden rather than chasing butterflies.

I don't have anyone I'm that emotionally close enough to vent to so I guess I'll vent into the void. ",1,1740996639.0,GuyCry,1,1.0,False

1j2fcgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dental_Art_Clinic/comments/1j2fcgy/the_secret_to_an_instantly_better_smile_without/,The Secret to an Instantly Better Smile (Without Veneers),"Ever wondered how to fix a small tooth chip or gap without going all-in on veneers? One popular solution in cosmetic dentistry is [composite bonding](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/composite-bonding). It’s a quick, painless, and **cost-effective alternative to** [veneers ](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/veneers)that’s become *super* popular here in London. For those unfamiliar, composite bonding (aka *dental bonding*) involves applying a tooth-colored resin to your teeth to repair minor flaws and enhance your smile’s appearance. The best part? It often only takes **one visit** to the dentist, so you can walk out with a refreshed smile in no time!

**What Makes Composite Bonding Awesome?** Here are some key benefits that have Londoners raving about this treatment:

* **Quick Results (One-Visit Smile Upgrade):** The whole process is usually done in a single appointment, often in under an hour. Perfect for busy schedules – you could literally get a tooth fixed on your lunch break. Instant gratification!
* **Painless & Non-Invasive:** No drills, no needles (in most cases). The dentist just lightly preps the tooth surface and adds the resin. It’s generally **painless**, so if dental work makes you nervous, bonding is pretty stress-free. Plus, since there’s minimal to no enamel removal, your natural tooth stays intact.
* **Affordable Alternative to Veneers:** Want the aesthetic boost of veneers but not the hefty price tag? Composite bonding is **much more budget-friendly**. You get similar cosmetic improvements (covering discoloration, smoothing chips, closing small gaps) at a fraction of the cost of porcelain veneers. **Bonus:** It’s reversible, unlike veneers which permanently alter your teeth.
* **Fixes Chips, Gaps & Other Flaws:** Bonding is super versatile. It can repair a chipped tooth, fill in a slight gap between teeth, mask small cracks or spots, and even make a slightly crooked tooth look straighter. It’s basically a cosmetic touch-up that can make your teeth look more even and bright.
* **Boosts Smile Aesthetics (and Confidence):** By improving tooth shape and color, composite bonding can dramatically enhance your smile’s appearance. Many patients say it gives them a **big confidence boost** – you’ll find yourself smiling more when you’re not worried about that one annoying chip or uneven tooth! 🎉

**Why** ***London*** **Loves Composite Bonding:** Aside from the benefits above, composite bonding fits the London vibe perfectly. It’s **quick, effective, and readily available** at many cosmetic dental clinics here (including ours at [Dental Art Implant Clinic](https://www.dentalartimplantclinic.co.uk/composite-bonding)). We’ve seen first-hand how a bit of bonding can transform someone’s smile *in one day*. In a city where everyone’s busy and quality matters, this treatment has become a go-to for a subtle but impactful smile makeover. And yes, it’s great for that tea or coffee staining habit – bonding can cover up discoloration and give you a fresh start (just remember to still go easy on the lattes to keep it looking its best! 😉).

**Let’s Chat!** Have you had any experience with composite bonding or other cosmetic dental work in London? **What do you think of it?** If you’re curious or have questions about how composite bonding works, what it costs around here, or whether it’s the right fix for your teeth – ask away in the comments! 💬 As dental professionals, we’re happy to share honest advice and info. Whether you’re contemplating a minor tweak or just love learning about dental stuff, we’d love to hear your thoughts and answer your questions.

I groan, I slam things and my coworkers offer a tight smile of understanding in return and that’s it! The approval I seek. In that moment, I feel like I belong.

But here’s the thing: I don’t actually hate my job. In fact, I love it. And not just because of the free coffee and wifi(though those help). 

My secret hobby? Motivating my team to advance in their careers. Yes, I’m that person.

While everyone’s complaining about the boss, I’m quietly slipping LinkedIn tips into conversations. 

‘Hey, have you thought about upskilling?’ I whisper, like I’m selling contraband. ‘You’d be great at project management—here’s a course I found.’

I’ve become the team’s unofficial career coach. Need a resume review? I’m your guy. Want to practice for an interview? I’ll role-play as the most intimidating hiring manager you’ve ever met. Struggling with self-doubt? I’ll hype you up like I’m your personal Tony Robbins.

But I can’t let anyone know I actually care. So, I keep up the act. ‘Ugh, this place is the worst,’ I say, while secretly drafting a step-by-step guide on how to ask for a raise for a colleague. ‘Can’t wait for the weekend,’ as I bookmark another leadership webinar for my self and coworker.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go pretend to hate the company retreat.

I’m trying to decide on the best coffee machine setup for making milk-based drinks like cappuccinos for four people on a budget of up to $1000. I’m considering several options and would appreciate your votes and model recommendations based on which one delivers the best taste.

Option 1: Single Boiler Portafilter Machine

This machine uses a single boiler, so you’d need to pull double shots and steam double portions of milk sequentially (two drinks per cycle).

It’s known for producing a richer, more nuanced flavor, but it requires more manual effort.

Key question: Will the manual, consecutive cycles affect the taste or texture, and is the extra work justified?


Option 2: Bean-to-Cup Automatic Machine (Brews Two Cups at a Time)

Examples include models from Nivona or Melitta (for example Ci touch) that brew two cups simultaneously, meaning you’d only need two cycles for four drinks.

It offers greater convenience and consistency, though it might not quite match the flavor profile of a portafilter machine.

Key question: How noticeable is the taste difference between this automatic process and a manual portafilter, particularly in milk-based drinks?


Option 3: Bean-to-Cup Automatic Machine (Brews One Cup at a Time)

In this setup, the machine (Nivona, Melitta) brews one cup per cycle, so you’d run four individual cycles for four drinks.

I’m curious whether brewing one cup at a time will have any adverse effect on the overall flavor and quality compared to brewing two cups simultaneously. 


Additional Note:
Unfortunately, I haven’t found any double-boiler machines under $1000. If you know of any new models in this price range, please mention them in the comments.

Final Consideration:
Based on all of these factors, which models or setups do you think provide the best balance of taste and convenience? If you were in my shoes, which option would you choose? Additionally, would the flavor of the drinks differ significantly between a portafilter machine and an automatic one?
Thanks in advance for your suggestions and model recommendations!

1j2f4l6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParadiseHulu/comments/1j2f4l6/finale_theory/,Finale Theory,"Feel free to poke holes in this theory, but I think there are 3 key players that’ll surface in the finale. Here’s my long winded take:

The Murderer - Mike Garcia
The Mastermind - Dr Torabi
“The Man Who Kept the Secrets” (episode title) - The Librarian

Summary: Off-duty Garcia attacks Cal while he’s on the balcony. He’s dressed as one of the gardeners. He hits him once, and Cal drops or throws the tablet. Garcia doesn’t realize this and goes searching for the tablet as Cal crawls inside and marks the X on the cigarettes. Unable to find it, Garcia strikes him again and escapes from the balcony. He looks for the tablet outside, but has to bail when he detects Presley. Garcia was sent by Dr Torabi. 

Here’s why, starting in chronological order of events (not necessarily order of the episodes):

Episode 7:
- We hear X ask Agent Rainey whether Garcia is on the Versailles list. He says he has no idea. 
- When X talks to Garcia about getting his wife to the Air Force base, Garcia is frustrated that they moved Jenkins from her post. Garcia says “I need her” and that “she’s coordinating the helicopters”
- I don’t think Garcia was meant to go to the bunker, but Jenkins was helping him hitch a ride to sneak in. First indication that Garcia might be disgruntled. It could also explain why his DNA wasn’t in the system, assuming we believe Sinatra on that

Unrelated to the theory but interesting:
- When X approaches Garcia he is watching a TikTok of someone showing off his bunker bracelet. He comments that his sister “got hers a week ago”. If this event was pretty sudden, how were some people getting their government-issued tracker bracelets a week before the tsunami?
- We also see on his computer screen someone speculating that there’s also a bunker in the Northern Alps 

Episode 1
- Brooks & Rainey had the perimeter shift during the night of the murder. Billy had the interior shift. Garcia was on duty earlier that day, and brought pozale. Garcia knew he’d eat the pozale because he’s familiar with Billy’s tendency to eat everything in the fridge like a “filthy animal”, but also knows he “has the stomach of a 14yo Amish girl”. 
- While initially reviewing the surveillance footage with X, Garcia mentions that X and the president talked for a long time. He then says “that guy (the president) has said only 4 words to me since I got down here”. Another clue as to his feelings about the president. 
- When X asked who was on the premises that night, Garcia mentioned it was “just the usuals - the gardeners, and us”. He specifically calls out that the gardeners were on site, as if it’s totally common place that they’d be there after dark. 
- When reviewing the tapes a second time with X, Garcia points out that Billy falls asleep and someone pauses the video. Garcia knows that Billy and Jane have a tendency to do this, giving him a window to attack. Garcia knew either his pozale or them playing Wii was going to keep him incapacitated or distracted enough to give him time. 
- Garcia then explains “At 12:13, cameras come back online. A minute later, Billy wakes up. An hour later, I show up for my shift with fresh coffee”. Him emphasizing the coffee stood out as odd to me. As if trying to establish an alibi at a coffee shop or something
- He then points the finger at Jane for not noticing anything because she’s “a little young, and a little inexperienced”. He easily misdirects attention away from himself to Billy and Jane 
- As the surveillance tech, Garcia knows all, sees all. He knows where camera blind spots are. He knows the other agents patrol routes, and their behavioral patterns. No one has better opportunity than Garcia. 

Episode 6
- We find out Garcia was in the Navy Seals for 5 years. He’s more athletic and skilled than you’d expect from the surveillance tech
- In this episode we also see the gardener fleeing the scene. Garcia may have been looking for the tablet in the bushes but got spooked by Presley. He would’ve known how to avoid the patrol officers, but Presley was a wild card 

Dr. Torabi
We know she is as invested in the success of the city as Sinatra is. She just wants stability. We know she’s Cal’s therapist. In episode 3 she explains to X that he was drunkenly stumbling around her office in his bathrobe. She knows he’s unraveling and maybe he mentions he’s going to reveal some destabilizing information to the public. She needs the tablet to understand what Cal knows. 

The Librarian
He’s been a little suspicious from the beginning. Cal is in the library the day of his murder, and then when Jeremy is there days later he says “I appreciate you taking advantage of this place, most people never set foot in here”. But, his dad had just been there. Why wouldn’t the librarian say something? He then encourages Jeremy to check out the exhibit on “bunker design”. 

I think the Librarian stumbled on the notebook Cal left and now knows everything. After realizing the 6 digit number that Cal left is a Dewey Decimal number, X will go to the library, read the journal, and be directed to the “bunker design” exhibit by the librarian, as Jeremy had been. It’ll be revealed that there are some kind of emergency explosive built into the dome in case they need to be evacuated or protect against an invasion. This was foreshadowed in episode 6 when Rainey said “You telling me we got RPGs stashed somewhere around here?” 

In the finale trailer, we see Xavier staring up at something in the library, and also an explosion outside of the dome. This is likely how they are going to escape to find Xavier’s wife. 

Anyway, this could be wrong in every possible way. Still thought I’d share since I hadn’t heard anyone else mention Garcia. We’ll see very soon!  ",1,1740995109.0,ParadiseHulu,0,1.0,False

The second he appears, talking about washing his hair in the sink as if it’s not insane (he’s a therapist, all that time living out of his office and he didn’t save up enough to get a new place??) then the morning after his night at Diana’s… I feel like he decided “I’ll make breakfast, she lives alone and her therapist says she struggles with insecurity, I’m sure she misses someone else making breakfast” so he makes coffee and eggs like he’s doing the absolute most. 

Then as soon as she says no to him inviting himself to live with her “for a few days,” he asks to talk about dreams so he can manipulate her by “interpreting” them. 

And he only gets worse after that! Lying about the circumstances so his son can live with them too, manipulating Diana with oral sex, and preying on her insecurities. He is disgusting and my least favorite character. I feel like Richard is even worse than Thad. At least Thad is (fairly) open about his character flaws but Richard is so slimy that as soon as his face first appears, I’m angry. He’s worse than David (maybe not more annoying though). I’d argue he’s even worse than Colin McNichol, though they should start a club of users.

1j2ey95,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonzo/comments/1j2ey95/fear_and_loathing_in_the_oval_office/,Fear and Loathing in the Oval Office.,"Jesus Christ. I’ve seen hostage videos with more dignity than this Oval Office shakedown. Trump, bloated on Big Macs and his own diseased ego, sits there like a casino pit boss, telling Zelenskyy he ‘doesn’t have the cards’—as if war crimes are just a bad poker hand. The man who ran a fake university is now explaining geopolitical power like he’s playing blackjack at Mar-a-Lago, drunk on Diet Coke and Fox News reruns.

Zelenskyy sits across the desk, jaw tight enough to crack diamonds, tasting weak American coffee that might as well be regret. Two years of dodging Russian missiles, and now he’s a prop in this late-night infomercial gone wrong, wondering how many bombs are falling back in Kyiv while he’s stuck here playing therapist to a room full of clowns who think they’re kings.

And JD Vance, a man whose spine is legally classified as jelly, is here too—lecturing Ukraine on ‘diplomacy’ like some fourth-rate historian who just skimmed a Wikipedia article on World War II. To him, diplomacy means 'give Putin everything he wants and say thank you' in whatever dialect of cowardice he speaks. Diplomacy! Zelenskyy has seen diplomacy—the kind that arrives at 3 a.m. in the form of a drone strike, the kind that turns a school into a crater before breakfast.

But he has to sit there, a million ghosts riding his shoulders, while two overfed American landlords explain his own war to him like he’s some confused Airbnb guest who forgot to tip. His cities are burning 5,000 miles away, and these bastards are haggling over who gets to wave the bigger stick for the cameras.

Trump doesn’t want peace. He wants submission. He wants Zelenskyy to crawl across the Resolute Desk, kiss the ring, and tell him he’s the greatest president in history. The man reeks of Big Mac grease and desperation, his tiny hands flailing like a scam artist trying to sell timeshares in hell.

But Zelenskyy won’t break. Not here. Not now. His soul has been scarred by shrapnel deeper than Trump’s tanning bed burns. Every bullet he can beg or borrow from this circus might keep one more kid alive back home. So he nods, he smiles, he plays the game, even as the bile rises in his throat and the ghosts whisper in his ear: Don’t fucking break, Volodymyr.

The whole thing reads like a low-budget mob film, with Trump playing a retired Atlantic City loan shark, trying to ‘make a deal’ while the Kremlin tunes in to watch the West implode.

But Putin didn’t just win this meeting—he didn’t even have to show up.

He’s probably sitting in Moscow right now, toasting with vodka over a map of Ukraine’s ruins, knowing that Trump just did more to undermine Ukraine than the entire Russian military could in two years.

America, once the arsenal of democracy, is now just another cheap reality show—and we’re all being forced to watch.

Zelenskyy most of all—a man with a nation bleeding out under his feet, stuck shaking hands with devils in ill-fitting suits while the sky back home streaks with fire.

I gave up restriction a while back and ended up gaining a significant amount. 

At the time, I was leaning on food for comfort. I got pregnant (while using contraception) with a man who I later realised was controlling and abusive. I was homeless with my son.. I went from an emergency c section into hotels week to week for months before I was placed into temporary accommodation. 

Thankfully, my son and I are now settled in our permanent home. I had the courage to leave the abusive relationship. 

I have also had a lot of childhood trauma coming back up since becoming a parent and the death of my dad November last year. I am facing the reality of csa as well as my mother's neglect and abuse. I am starting to accept that I have a serious mental illness as well as neurological differences. I am also a recovering addict. I have stayed clean over 3yrs now. 

However, restrictive patterns came in with food and leaning on caffeine. I have been obsessive and compulsive towards exercise, particularly strength training. 

A few months back, I stopped tracking calories and then stopped tracking with a food diary. I have recently given up coffee. Even though it's a financial loss, I have also cancelled sessions with my PT. I recognise there I'm seeking validation. I notice patterns in him that remind me of past abuse. I am recognising these patterns and moving away from these relationships quickly. I hope that at some point I will no longer be attracted to these types (trying to resolve old patterns). I am really starting to recognise that other people's mistreatment of me is not my fault or responsibility. I do not need to understand or fix it. I just need to avoid or maintain firm boundaries.

I will still be attending the gym as I use the creche (financially and practically necessary at the minute). My current progress will be going to stretch and practice yoga. That means no boxing and no weight lifting. I will still be walking day to day as my son is 2 and needs plenty of exercise and fresh air.

I feel fearful of not strength training in particular. ""Where there's fear, have faith. ""

My intuition is telling me that this is the right path for me. 

I had an insight this morning that I was an A student and my mum would criticise me for the only subject I struggled in.. PE. I was an overweight child because I ate to survive the abuse at home. I have only just started to realise the damage that my mum has inflicted on me because of her own sickness and self hatred. My dad's behaviour was overt and much easier to see. The revelation anyway is that it's her goal and her desire for me to be thin, socially acceptable, a good representation of her.. I excel in the gym and became strong because I was so determined to make her love me and be someone that would finally please her. It isn't enough. It is in her nature for her to be critical and jealous and cold towards me. I am finally seeing it. 

With this understanding, I know that I can move forward choosing my behaviour based on my values rather than what my mum or society or whoever expects. 

Much of my overeating to numb myself has been reduced with awareness of my trauma and allowing myself to feel and heal through creativity, relaxation etc.

Like I say, I am fearful. I am courageous today because I'm going to do it anyway..

Even as I write this I have thoughts of contacting the PT and continuing down that path. I know I don't have to act on those thoughts. I get to choose today. So I'm choosing life. It's only a preference for me to have a certain body type; I'm not actually happy dependent on what I look like anyway.. that's an illusion. 

So I'm going to take it day by day and minute by minute. 

I'm grateful that I've come to clarify before I ended up destroying my life or hurting my son. 

There is an alternative way to live and I'm trusting that there are better days to come where this won't feel so difficult.. when it doesn't feel like a sacrifice or a punishment. 

I know that life can be sweet as well as painful. I choose life. I choose love. I choose recovery. I choose trusting my intuition. I choose self love and self respect. I choose awareness. Thank you body for carrying me through this world. ",1,1740994194.0,fuckeatingdisorders,1,1.0,False

1j2es6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1j2es6u/101_the_game/,[101] The Game,"I was sitting on the couch, TV on, beer in hand, and a smile gracing my lips. I had done it. I had finally finished the game started by my father. And now that I was done, I was free. There wasn’t going to be any more doubt in my mind about my next immediate action, whether or not this would be the wrong choice, whether it would be my last. I had won.

I glanced down at myself—khaki pants, brown loafers, and a blood-stained button-up blue striped shirt. For a second, my smile faded, reminding myself what I had to do in order to be free. But it wasn’t long before that smile returned, because that was it. I was free. And that is all that matters right now. It didn’t matter that there were red and blue lights flashing from the other side of my dusty brown curtains that covered a mostly intact window, it didn’t matter that the only food in the fridge was weeks old and moldy, and it didn’t matter that the stains on the rug I had tried desperately to remove still showed through. All that matters is the simple fact that I can move on. That the echo of my father’s words no longer cursed me.

""Son, the game isn't just something you play. It's something that plays you. Something you live. And if you're going to win... it’s going to cost you.""

There was a loud banging on the door. And a voice, deep and bellowing. I wasn’t able to comprehend what they were saying, but it sounded important. Important, I thought about that for a second, when is something ever truly important? To all parties involved, to some, what may seem important to me is trivial. And it works the other way around too. Like a child asking his father if he could please get him some new toy. It may be important to the child, but to me, I don’t give a fuck about that little shit's toy. No, I suppose the banging on the door wasn’t important. And it wasn’t important when the door was smashed in and fell from its hinges to lay across my living room floor. It was hardly even important when the two huge men in blue uniforms charged into my home, pistols drawn, grabbing me and slamming me into the floor while pulling my arms behind my back.

Because I was free. That’s what is important. That’s the only thing that is and has ever been important—the prospect of being, totally and utterly, free.

There were lots of lights in the dark night as I was taken from my home—red, blue, and bright whites. Noises too, voices, too many voices too loud and from so many different places, and engines running. I was unceremoniously put into the back seat of a car. It wasn’t very comfortable, but that wasn’t important. My wrists were bent at awkward angles and the metal from the handcuffs chafed them slightly. But I didn’t mind. I had a lot of time to think that night as I sat behind the cold iron bars. And of course, my thoughts always brought me back to that game, that goddamned game.

I’m not sure if I could tell you exactly what the point of the game was, only that there were winners. And there were losers as well. And trust me when I say, you never wanted to be one of the losers. There were rules to this game, of course, as there are rules to most games, but the rules were never static. You had to watch for signs of the rules changing in the world around you, you had to listen and smell and look so carefully, so very carefully because if you missed a rule and you broke it—well, that was it. There’s no going back, you just lose. So I watched, and I listened, and I breathed in the air around me. Everywhere I went, sometimes I caught them in a flash—the quick flick of someone’s lips starting to smile, then suddenly disappearing, as they passed by me on the sidewalk, the smell of a normally pleasant flower stand being slightly off, or the barking of a dog coming from the mouth of a raven for just a single second. If I had missed any of these or the countless others, I don’t want to even think about where I’d be right now. Probably I’d be in the same place as all of them, the things that make these rules. Joining them in their games, but as a piece this time instead of a player.

My thoughts were stopped suddenly by the raking of metal against the bars. Another man, slightly shorter than the first two I encountered that night, also wearing a blue uniform, was seemingly trying to get my attention. His mouth moved, and his eyes fixed on me. His words, each seemed to make sense when put next to each other. However, his intentions were still lost on me. I sat there, straight-backed, and smiled, nodding my head slightly. It was the polite thing to do. I had done it growing up, whenever talking to someone and I didn’t quite catch what they were saying, I would simply smile and nod. However, I don’t think he took it as polite; his face furrowed, brow creasing, and his eyes became darker, to the point where the whites of his eyes were completely hidden from me.

He pulled a chain of keys attached by a cord from his belt and unclasped the heavy metal lock on the cell’s door, and slid the bars to the side. He motioned with his hand for me to walk with him. I stood, hands still locked behind my back, and followed his directions. I was led down a corridor with yellowish fluorescent lights lighting the way, the faint smell of piss hit my nose, a moment later it was replaced by the refreshing aroma of coffee. Just then the man stopped in front of an open door on the right that led into a small room with a table, two chairs on one side, one on the other. He looked at me, and again he spoke, it all seemed perfectly reasonable except I had no idea what he wanted. So I smiled, and nodded, and stood there. His frustrations seemed to return, face returning to that pinched expression, eyes black. He grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the single chair on the opposite side of the table. I understood and sat.

The man left, closing the door behind him. I sat and waited, for what, I wasn’t sure. But I enjoyed the peace of that lonely room, the feel of the brushed aluminum chair I sat in, that seemed to have been bolted to the ground. The flickering of those yellow lights above me, and the slight buzz of electricity that came with them. There was one thing in that room I didn’t like, however—a large mirror against the wall directly in front of me. It showed me more of the room, sure, but everything was wrong. Backwards. Everything was the same way they would see it.

""A world turned inside out, where everything you thought you knew is a lie, and every truth is a curse waiting to be broken.""

That’s what my father had told me about them. That’s all he told me about them, but I knew he knew more. He spent so much time talking to them, begging them, pleading with them. I knew he could have told me more about what was to come. About the pain I had to bring to the other players in order to win. But he kept it secret; sometimes I wonder whether that was because he didn’t want to burden me with knowing what had to come if I was going to win, or if it was because he didn’t want to lose.

It didn’t matter in the end. He did lose, and I had won. I tried to make it quick, out of the love I still had buried in my heart for my father. As quick as I could, at least, while still following the rules. It was strange, he didn’t react in the same way the others had, there was no screaming, no fighting. It just seemed like he was content with this turn of events. Like he had already accepted that he was just going to be another loser, and I was going to be the winner. He hardly even whimpered as I was tearing the skin away from his body, carefully, making sure not to damage any of the muscle underneath. I had tried to prop him against the wall so that his blood would drain quicker, leaving him less time to suffer. But he did still suffer. I had wished the rules were different for him, but there’s no sense in trying to escape what had to be done to win.

The door opened, two men walked in, both wearing long brown coats that were damp from the rain outside. One of the men had red hair, and he was carrying a styrofoam cup that steamed and brought with it that relaxing smell of coffee. The other, black-haired, carried no cup that had no pleasant smell to accompany it. However, he did have a brown folder tucked under one arm. They made their way to the seats across from me, the red-haired man sitting first while the black-haired one stared at me for a moment. I stared back and smiled. The smile was not reciprocated, just the quick pinching of his face before he returned to his expressionless facade. He sat next to the red-haired man and began moving his lips, uttering words and making gestures with his hands. I kept my smile and nodded slowly. His mouth stopped moving, the words stopped, and he quickly glanced at the red-haired man and then back to me. The red-haired man raised his styrofoam cup to his lips and breathed in the steam, I caught a whiff of the sour scent of mold; however, he did not seem to mind. He took a sip and set the cup on the table. There I could see it was filled with dark liquid with a brown film swirling around the surface. I stared at it for a moment, watching the film slowly spiral in the cup, watching as it slowed down until it finally stopped rotating. I continued to watch as it started circling again, however, in the other direction this time.

The red-haired man interrupted my thoughts with his words. His words were soft-spoken, yet they seemed to carry tremendous meaning to him. I could see it in his face, his eyes shone bright, and his jaw was clenched slightly. I tried to convey understanding to the plight I assumed he was having by softening my features, and tilting my head slightly as I nodded. I let the smile fall from my lips and rest flat against my face. The red-haired man stopped talking and just looked at me. His eyes burned into my own. I stared back, intently enough that I could make out my own reflection in the blacks of his eyes. I caught it for a second before it just disappeared. I blinked and refocused on the red-haired man, but that look was gone. He sat straight and cleared his expression.

The black-haired man pushed his brown folder forward on the table and opened it so I could see the contents. It was filled with pictures, mostly of people, some of objects. Of the pictures of the people, they were all ones I had once known, and of the objects, I recognized them all. So in understanding, I looked at the black-haired man, smiled, and nodded. The black-haired man’s mouth started moving again, I could see the muscles around his eyes straining, he looked tired. I gestured with my head, nodding it towards the red-haired man’s coffee while keeping my eyes locked with the black-haired man. He did not seem to want the coffee.

Instead of taking the cup and sipping from it, he pointed to one of the pictures. It was of a woman, brown hair, blue eyes, 27 years old. Her name was Lisa, and her birthday was July 17th, 1997. Her arms were not attached to her body in this picture, they were laying above her head, overlapping each other, forming the general shape of a cross. There was rope around her neck, waist, and legs that was tied to keep her down, and the large kitchen knife that I had used to saw her arms off was laying unceremoniously next to her. There was no rule about what to do with the knife when I was finished, so I had just left it with her in her apartment after the party. This very well might be one of the last pictures taken of my sister; it was important to me.

I looked back to the black-haired man and nodded. He stared for a moment, then moved his finger to another picture, this one of a man. 28 years old, brown hair, once brown eyes, born on October 21st, 1996, died on March 15th, 2025. His favorite thing to do in his free time was go fishing with his friends. In the picture, his abdomen was cut open, and his entrails were set to the side. His eyes were missing, from the photo, however, I still had them. For this part of the game, I was required to gut my best friend properly while blindfolded, and so I was rewarded with his eyes as I completed the challenge. I smiled remembering all the fun me and Chris used to have.

The black-haired man continued pointing at pictures of my friends and family, and I continued to reminisce, smiling and even laughing at some of the funnier memories I had shared with these people. If only they could see me now. A winner. I'm sure they'd be proud and we'd all go out and celebrate. The black-haired man pointed at the last photo, an older man with grey hair. He had crow’s feet at the sides of his eyes and a big bushy mustache that normally covered half of his smiling mouth. There was no smile in the photo. The man was stripped naked, of both clothes, as well as skin from the neck down. Slouched against the wall. His skin draped over the couch on the right of him like a throw blanket. My father, the man who had started this game, the man who had selfishly dragged me into it. And the man who had selflessly worked two jobs for years to be able to provide for me and my sister after our mother passed away. He was a man with flaws, sure, but he was a good man until the very end.

I smiled and leaned back as far as I could in my chair with my hands still cuffed behind my back. I had won, the game was over, and I could finally live my life in peace. I was thrilled by the thought, and I couldn’t help but laugh. The black-haired man started speaking, and I smiled and nodded vigorously, fully accepting the high that came with being done with the game. I looked back at the red-haired man. He looked to me and a smile played across his lips, then suddenly it disappeared.

*Date \[standardized human time\]: June 30th, 2137*

Awareness came back to me slowly and unevenly. Through the haze of sleep, I could hear voices, talking about something. I tried opening my eyes, but the eyelids were too heavy. I also couldn’t feel anything at all… My body was wholly numb, and I couldn’t even tell whether I was laying sprawled or sleeping normally.

I tried shuffling my wings with a groan, and the distant sound of talking ceased. It took way more effort than it should have, but I finally managed to pry my eyes open… Only to shut them again immediately, the brightness of my surroundings being too painful to bear.

I attempted recalling what happened. I remembered waking up at Ristal’s apartment… Confronting Mr. Branch… Staking out outside the kidnappers’ house… And then… the fight…

I forced my eyes open again, ignoring the pain caused by brightness. Everything was blurry and I felt groggy, but I needed to make sure others were okay… Ristal and Kenneth and Tansi, they were all injured… They needed help, I had to help them…

“Hey, hey, lay back down, you shouldn’t be moving so much!” I heard a voice… Kenneth!

“Kenneth… Where… what…?” I asked, trying to focus my eyes and make the blur go away. Some things started faintly clearing up, and I could make out that we were in a room… Bright room! Hospital! That’s right, good old medical bay… I was in a bed and there were two more in the room. I couldn’t exactly make it out, but the direction of the voice indicated that the person laying in the bed across from me was Kenneth… Which meant that the grey blob in the bed to the side of me must have been Ristal.

I tilted my head slightly, trying to direct attention towards her. With everything so blurry, I couldn’t even make out if she was looking back at me.

“Hey…” I spoke, my beak and tongue not obeying me quite well. “You good…?” I asked, hoping that it was her who was the second voice and she wasn’t actually asleep.

“Better than you.” She replied, her voice sounding as beautifully low as ever, not nearly as coarse and dry as mine. “Glad you’re finally awake. I was worried… You were completely out for more than a day and I…” She stopped herself.

“I’m fine…” I spoke with a hoarse voice. I still couldn’t feel any of my body, but knowing the others were safe, I could calm down. “Where’s Tansi…?”

“Apparently a venlil can walk off being shot in the head.” Kenneth answered. “No clue how, but doctors said she just had a mild concussion and was walking around today already. Not that we saw, the three of us are being kept isolated in this separate room for political reasons.”

“Are you two… okay…?” I asked, not really caring about why we were here. Everyone got hurt because of me, so I needed to know how much I screwed up.

“I am fine, just got my hand stabbed a bunch of times. I’m lucky you guys came when you did, they were just about to grab the drill.” Kenneth raised a heavily bandaged hand to demonstrate. “As is, it’s nothing major, though the scar will be huge.”

“The bullets didn’t hit anything vital.” Ristal said, patting at her waist. My vision was clearing up enough that I could actually make out her wincing in pain at that. “It hurts, but it’s nothing serious, and with the bullets taken out it should heal quickly.”

“Okay… That’s good… Nothing too bad…” I sighed with relief, letting my head drop. Or at least I thought it dropped. I wasn’t sure if I managed to raise it up in the first place. The world was wobbly even when I wasn’t trying to move.

“Krekos, what do you mean ‘that’s good’?!” Ristal suddenly raised her voice. “Have you looked at the state you’re in?!”

“It’s… hard to move.” I admitted, suddenly feeling an intense desire to climb under the blanket.

“You shouldn’t even be awake with how much painkillers you’re on right now, mate.” Kenneth called out.

“Oh… That explains the numbness…” I hummed. “I… was I hurt bad?”

“We got the epipen to you just in time, but between a bullet to your lung and broken wing, you got seriously hurt.” Ristal turned away, now looking at her own hands as she started twiddling all four of her thumbs. “I… I failed to protect you… But you also jumped in like that… You were supposed to stay safe…”

“I’m… I’m sorry…” I tried apologizing, though I knew full well that I’d do that again, given the chance. “But… She was shooting at you and she was about to shoot Kenneth and… I couldn’t just stand there and watch it happen! I had to do something!” I shut my eyes. I didn’t even feel my eyelids, but there was something resembling wetness there. “I… I’m sorry for being useless.”

“Hey, buddy, you weren’t useless.” Kenneth spoke with a reassuring tone. “You did end up taking that crazy bitch down, and you saved both me and your girlfriend. You, uh… Just did it in a very crazy way yourself.”

“I didn’t mean to accuse you, I just–” Ristal sighed, shaking her head. “I was so determined to protect you, and somehow I came out of it less injured than you… I’m sorry…”

“It’s not your fault, Ristal. I… It’s my fault you were even there, that everything even happened. If I had reported it sooner–” I was about to admonish myself for not acting sooner, but the door suddenly slammed open as someone walked in with a confident stride.

“If you had reported it sooner, we could have had it dealt with and this mess could have been avoided, yes.” The woman that walked in spoke. I’ve only met her once before in my life, but seeing her again, I recognized her instantly. Even in my painkiller high numbness, I felt the chills run down my spine and my feathers standing up. “The doctors said you just woke up, and with all three of you awake, it’s time we had a talk.” She adjusted her sunglasses with one hand, closing the door with the other.

“G-General Jones!” Kenneth gasped, immediately straightening his back.

“It’s you…” Ristal gasped, visibly tensing up.

“Wait, you two met her too?!” I looked at the others incredulously.

“Well… Remember that story I told from Fahl? When Marina wanted to do a false flag attack and how someone blew the whistle, causing our squad to be sent to other assignments?” Kenneth paused, giving me a chance to recall the story. “Well… I was the whistleblower.”

“I…” Ristal began, eyeing Kenneth warily. Right, it was probably related to her secret…

“You’re a Dominion arxur, aren’t you?” Kenneth simply asked her, making both Ristal and me twitch in surprise. “Definitely not an Archives rescue.”

“How did you know?!” I asked.

“How long…?” Ristal added

“I suspected it from the way she’s built, to be honest…” Kenneth gave Ristal a look-over. “And her speech. I’ve seen videos of Archives arxur. She’s just got a different air entirely. And then the suspicion got confirmed when she took several bullets like they were Nerf darts while chewing a man’s arm off.”

“Well… Yeah…” Ristal winced painfully. “It’s a secret… But yes. And I know the General because she was the one my parents negotiated me being sent here with. What about you, Krekos?”

“She… Visited me once, personally. After I handed over all the information I had, including access code to the ship's systems that I had from Dr. Harla.” I shivered, recalling the conversation I had with her and all the thanks she’s given me.

General Jones clapped her hands, making us all flinch.

“Good! Glad everyone is on the same page. Now, learning that three Persons of Interest got in a vigilante rescue firefight was surprising, but having it leaked all over the internet was a particularly nasty addition.” She quirked her eyebrow at Ristal. “Did you really not think to knock that camera over before mauling a guy half to death?”

“The camera…?” I asked, unsure of what she was talking about.

“Ah. Yes. The camera. The camera that streamed everything that happened. My people did their best to suppress the spread, which almost worked with them using illicit streaming services, but, well… The Internet is more tenacious than any intelligence officer once it puts its collective mind to something.” She adjusted her glasses. “The censored versions are now all over the place and we cannot take them down as fast as they’re popping up. The whole world knows what happened.”

“Did they… kill one of them…?” Kenneth asked a question hesitantly.

“Luckily, no.” Jones responded, pulling out a small clipboard. “Marina Ogneva, lost both eyes, a gunshot wound to the calf, a glancing gunshot wound on the side of the torso. Never going to see again, and the damage to the optic nerves makes even prosthetics complicated.” I couldn’t see where she looked behind her glasses, but something told me she glanced over at me as she said that. “Victor Madaras, severe blood loss, missing arm, multiple lacerations all over the torso. Survived only by an inch. Nigel Surworth, a concussion from getting hit in the back of the head by a blunt object…” She raised an eyebrow at Ristal. “I didn’t know aliens could be that good at throwing aim.”

“I… wasn’t aiming at him… It was at the guy who was already with a gun. I missed.” Ristal admitted.

“Ah. Luck.” Jones nodded before continuing on. “Harry Lance, half a dozen gunshots to both legs. And, lastly, Angela Solasi, only got away with a few scratches, self-inflicted from clutching herself too much.” She lowered the clipboard and scanned the room. “All in all, you did way more damage to them than they to you.”

“But there’s a catch.” Kenneth guessed.

“Not particularly.” The woman smirked. “You see, there are special circumstances to be called in for most people involved. You, Officer Vince, were a victim and nothing can be held against you, not that you did anything. That venlil veteran, Tansi… Well, it’ll be a legal loophole, but there is no proper procedure for undeployment of military contractors from allied alien states. We’ll just claim she was never undeployed and acted in her capacity as a soldier to defend the people of Earth. And for our krakotl friend here, well… That one is simple. Isn’t that right, Agent Songbird?”

“Wha…?” I tilted my head in shock. Ristal and Kenneth were looking at me just as surprised. What was she talking about?

“Were you not notified?” Jones tilted her head to match. “When we were fast-tracking your citizenship, we put you in as an informant for the Intelligence.”

“Citizenship…?” I tilted my head even further. “But… I’m not a citizen, I’m just a refugee, no…?”

Jones rubbed the bridge of her nose with a sigh.

“I suppose you weren’t notified then.” She mumbled. “Yes, Krekos, you are a citizen of Earth, and your citizenship was fast-tracked thanks to being assigned as an informant. Which does allow me to simply give you back-dated permission for open combat against a local HF cell, giving you a clear too. And with that permission, frankly, it could be even argued that the others were recruited by you as militia for the rescue, leaving everyone free of charges, but…” She turned to look over at Ristal. “There is, in fact, one outstanding issue.”

Ristal’s head lowered and she covered her snout with a blanket defensively.

“As I said earlier, the Internet has made sure the story of your daring rescue is known to the world. And it appears that seeing the way our ‘Archives’ arxur fought didn’t only raise questions for Officer Vince.” She dipped her head slightly. “Our allies are getting concerned that we are harboring dangerous fugitives from the Dominion.”

“I… I’m sorry…” Ristal quietly spoke.

“Ms. Ristal, do you remember why you were allowed to join the Education Program and why you were made to claim to be an Archives arxur for it?” Jones asked firmly.

“Because the whole point of the program is to demonstrate how the UN is creating unity between the species here on Earth, and helping people integrate…” She mumbled. “And I had to hide because they did not want to put any Dominion defectors into the spotlight to avoid controversy with allies…”

“And you proceeded to enter a very viral spotlight.” Jones concluded. “Lucky for you, no concrete statements about you have been made yet. We can still say your claim of being from the Archives was entirely your own fabrication. However…”

“I’m… going back…” She choked out those words. Even with my blurry vision, I could see the tears forming on her expression.

“I’ll come with you!” I called out, realizing what was happening. I tried getting out of the bed, standing up and rushing to her, but only managed to roll over to the side, extending one of my wings towards her. “Ristal… I won’t let you go back alone…” I groaned, hating the numbing painkillers for ruining the moment. “I will be with you…”

“No!” She shouted, shooting up and throwing her hands up in front of her. “Krekos, the Dominion may be gone, but all the arxur in it are still the same! They’d… they’d never be able to accept you existing, much less our relationship, it wouldn’t be safe for you there!”

“It wouldn’t be safe for you either…” I mumbled, before speaking up louder. “And you’d be miserable! I… I don’t want to make you go back to the life you never enjoyed alone! At least… that way we’d have each other there…”

Ristal was now sobbing, wiping her tears off with a fist.

“Krekos… you are… such a stupid bird…” She managed inbetween her sobs. “I… I can’t… Not at the cost…”

“Ahem?” The voice interrupted the tearful moment. “I wasn’t finished.”

General Jones easily regained all our attention, even Ristal stopped sobbing, only occasionally sniffing wetly.

“Now, as I was saying… We will be claiming that the Archives story was a fabrication entirely on your end. And you avoided local charges thanks to your boyfriend’s agent status. But as for the deportation of a dangerous defector…” She smirked. “There’s a way to avoid that. Simple, really.”

She pulled out her clipboard again, switching out some papers.

“I’ve prepared this. Back-dated, of course. Just a few signatures and I can send it out to be injected into the records retroactively. First of all, you.” She approached Ristal and handed her a pen and pointed to a specific spot in the document. “Sign right there.”

Ristal blinked in surprise and put in a signature of her name. Then Jones walked over to me for some reason. Was it because of the Agent thing? Likely, considering she was the one handling it and she was using the same loophole to get Ristal off from local charges…

“And you sign here. Don’t worry about coherency.” She pointed to a spot and handed me a pen. Taking it into my wingclaws with the painkillers in my system was difficult, but writing a coherent word was even more so. What I ended up putting down next to Ristal’s signature was more a sharp squiggle than a word, much less a name.

“Good. Works, I suppose.” She pulled the paper away and gave it a look over. “Yes, that’s fine. Well, congratulations, I pronounce you husband and wife, or however the saying goes in your cultures.”

“Huh?!” Both me and Ristal leaned towards her in shock at what she just said.

“What? Never heard of fictive marriage?” She smirked at us. “Easy way to get a citizenship and with a local citizenship, any deportation is out of the question. Plus, after that video went viral, so did the pictures taken of you two on your dates and, well… Everyone basically thinks you’ll be getting married already. This won’t surprise anyone.” Her smirk dropped as she realized both of us were still staring at her with open mouths. “Except you two apparently.”

“Is that even legal?” I asked, too shocked to really focus on other implications of what just happened.

“Dubiously. Enough to solve your issues though.” She nodded.

“Wait, aren’t they minors, technically?” Kenneth suddenly spoke up. “Not sure how alien ages work.”

“They are, but alien ages are just as legally nebulous as everything else involving aliens.” Jones hummed. “Frankly, both would be considered emancipated and therefore free to make their choices if it came down to courts, but it’s not like anyone has a reason to question it. But that’d ruin the adoption plans, wouldn’t it?”

“The adoption plans…?” Ristal asked the question for me as my beak hung even wider open.

“He… didn’t know about those yet…” Kenneth’s shoulders raised awkwardly. “Uhm… surprise…?”

My brain had too much going on. The fight, the consequences of it, the painkillers making my whole body feel floaty, the presence of this extremely dangerous woman, the momentary fear of Ristal getting deported, and now, apparently, marriage and adoption at the same time?!

“I think he broke.” Jones said with a chuckle. “Anyway, I got the marriage certificate to process and you lot have got a lot of news. Ms. Ristal, you’re free to disclose your secret now, though the UN support in keeping it up till now remains classified. You understand why, I hope.”

“Of course, of course.” Ristal nodded. “Thank you for… everything. All the help. Even if it’s like… that.”

“Listen, if your relationship doesn’t work out, you can have a quiet divorce in six months or so, and if it does and you want a ceremony, you can run one and just skip the paper signing part. It’s easy.” She looked around the room. “Anything else?”

“Ristal said the old Mr. Branch was involved. What’s going to happen to him and his granddaughter?” Kenneth asked.

“Ah, the old man.” Jones nodded. “Jail, obviously. Not nearly as long as most of the others, but he was more involved in the kidnapping plot than even that Angela girl, so his remorse and testimony against the others can only do so much. His granddaughter will go to the foster system, and his assets will be frozen and transferred to her when she’s of age, or to her new guardians should she get adopted. Simple, really. Though she will be able to visit him in jail, so there’s that, at least.”

“Oh… It makes sense, just… Poor girl.” Kenneth lowered his head.

Silence hung in the room and Jones shrugged, beginning to walk out. But just as she reached towards the door handle, I called out.

“Wait! I have one last question!”

She stopped and spun in place, looking directly at me. Despite my numbness, I still felt cold under her gaze. I gulped down a lump that formed in my throat and spoke.

“Why… so much effort to help me specifically? Kenneth was a soldier and Ristal has a connection through her parents, but… me? What value do I serve?”

She seemed silent for a moment, but after a few seconds I realized she was holding back snickers. She did regain her composure quickly though before answering me with a serious tone.

“Propaganda. I know I told you all about the ships we intercepted in time that we might not have without you opening the doorway to the systems for us. What came after, though…” She sighed. “The krakotl we captured were very uncooperative. You really were the exception, not the rule. But by letting you live a normal life, allowing you to go free, get a citizenship and make yourself a life here on Earth, we have a living example of what could happen to others who are willing to cooperate with us, even if they were on the other side of the conflict. Throughout the whole conflict, getting through to the Feds and getting them to cooperate was nigh impossible. No leverage that works, no reason, no logic… But having an example they could follow, an example of someone who did work with us and have a pleasant life afterwards…” General Jones smirked. “It does a lot for those ‘herd instincts’ of yours to have someone to follow, I guess.”

She turned around and grabbed the door handle only to pause momentarily, turning towards me with a smirk.

“And now, with your romance with an arxur, you are being a perfect example of the Coalition’s new ideals. So that going viral too is a benefit we’ve been enjoying in the fight against predator-prey worldview.” She added.

With that, she left the room, leaving no room for any more questions. Not that I had any. Instead, with her gone, my body remembered how much numbing medication it was on and slumped back into a sprawled out position. I lazily drew the blanket back over myself and settled back in.

But we were not allowed a moment of respite. About a minute after Jones left, the door opened and in burst a whole crowd of people.

“Twenty minutes, you lot! And then out!” Some voice called out from behind the crowd, likely a doctor. It seems like we had a lot of visitors that were waiting for the General to talk to us before they were allowed inside.

First were the Vinces, Lena and Reginald, who immediately rushed to Kenneth’s bedside in tears, hugging him. Kenneth returned the hugs, all three humans tearing up. I won’t deny feeling a slight tinge of jealousy, but I couldn’t blame any of them for prioritising each other, especially with how much worse things could have gone for Kenneth.

The second group rushing in were the other students. Kirly, Bakir, Tikni, and even Tansi with a bandaged up head went in and crowded between mine and Ristal’s beds. Kirlt frantically turned back and forth, struggling to decide which one of us to fuss over first. Tansi seemed surprisingly fine despite getting hit, standing by my side and examining me, while Tikni and Bakir were standing aside, not rushing to either of us.

“I was told you were banged up bad, but damn…” Tansi hummed. “You look like shit.”

“Sorry for…” I looked up at her bandage.

“Oh, it’s nothing.” She huffed, waving her paw. “I mean, it’s not nothing, I got super lucky that the shot only glanced me, but I’m fine now. It only left a small crack in my skull. Guess the farsul couldn’t get rid of all of our thick-headed heritage.” She swished her tail smugly and tried to knock on her own head only to wince in pain. “Oww…”

“Are you sure you’re okay to walk?” I asked.

“I’m fine, relax. The only reason I’m even wearing the bandage is because the doctors will yell at me. I’m getting discharged tomorrow, just gotta take it easy on the head.” Her ears lowered. “What about your wing? I don’t know much about krakotl and how your bones heal, but…”

I looked over at my wing. It was secured in a surprisingly well-made cast. And the only reason that was surprising was because I was judging it on Dr. Harla’s standards, which were unreasonably high. Anyone else would call it an extremely well-made cast.

“Well…” I tried moving my injured wing, but obviously failed. “I am not sure how bad it actually is, but judging from what I remember of how I got it hurt and the way it is now…” I recalled the lessons in triage and treating injuries back aboard the ship. Things were fuzzy. “I think… It’ll be a while of recovery, but shouldn’t be anything long-term…?”

“Look at the optimist.” Bakir huffed. “Tikni nearly had a heart attack from watching you choke on your own tongue.”

“I did not! I just…” Tikni looked offended. “It was more all the blood around and the injured humans… We’re lucky we didn’t get an allergic reaction from just being there.”

That actually got Bakir to bristle his spines and shiver himself.

“Yeah… You lot really went crazy in there… Sorry for, uh, doubting any of your abilities.” He spoke.

“What, scared that the three crazies will go after you next?” Tansi’s ears swiveled in a teasing manner.

“Scared? Me? No. Never.” Bakir crossed his arms.

“Stop bickering you guys!” Kirlt finally stopped fussing over Ristal and moved over to me. “Really, how careless can you get… Krekos, I know I saw it happen on stream, but is it true?! You devoured human flesh?!”

“I didn’t devour anything, I just…” I felt sick just remembering that moment of rage. Both because of the emotions I recalled feeling then and because of the things I’ve done being utterly repulsive and disgusting. “Pecked. And some got in my mouth. Unintentionally.” I managed to push the words out without pushing any of my stomach’s contents alongside them, assuming there were any.

“So when I tear a man’s arm off, it’s ‘did you hurt your teeth’, but when Krekos pecks someone it’s ‘is it true?’, huh?” Ristal spoke, addressing Kirlt with surprising sass to her voice.

“I… listen, it…” Kirlt froze up, suddenly clutching his chest. “It brings up bad memories. So I blocked that part out, instead focusing on… what happened to you. Not what… you did.”

Kirlt’s words made the mood much tenser. Ristal’s expression shifted to guilt.

“I’m sorry, I… forgot.” She sighed. “Also, I… well, the secret’s out now… I’m not from the Archives.”

The reaction was mixed. Tansi’s ears drooped sadly, Tikni and Bakir visibly bristled their spines, though managed to hold calm expressions. Kirlt, however, didn’t even flinch.

“I suspected.” He said with a sigh. “From the moment you rescued me from those gojid that beat me up, the way you jumped in and grabbed one of them… It was way too much like… Like…” His antennae swiveled and he stopped speaking. After a few moments he continued. “That’s why I struggled so much with accepting you even after that. I didn’t want to accuse you, I didn’t want to believe it, but my feelings just… Told me you were like them…”

“What changed then…?” Ristal asked carefully.

“I saw more and more pictures of you and Krekos together on the internet. And… I realized that the monsters that killed everyone back home could never do that. After that it was just… building up the courage. So… Even if you are not from the Archives, I don’t think…” Kirlt’s voice hitched for a moment. “I don’t think I see you as one of them anymore either.”

“Thank you…” Ristal’s eyes watered as she clutched at her blanket. “I… I hated keeping that a secret. I didn’t care if I was accepted for my true self, but it felt terrible to be accepted for a lie…”

“I accept you for your true self.” Tansi offered with a positive earflick. “I don’t really care where you’re from. You showed yourself to be a good person.”

“It’ll take some getting used to…” Tikni offered diplomatically.

“But we got used to the humans, so we can handle this too.” Bakir finished.

“I wonder how many people suspected but never said anything…” Ristal sighed, wiping her tears away.

“Everyone we knew, apparently.” I offered her an answer with a laugh. She laughed in return and the rest of the students also laughed, stopping when I wheezed. I didn’t feel pain, but I must have breathed in too deep, because there was a weird feeling in my lung for a moment.

“Are the reunions done?” Someone else spoke up, breaking up the crowd to approach the bed. It was Apollo, with Mevik right behind him.

“Supervisor Stevens!” Tikni gasped. “I’m surprised you made time to visit. Weren’t you super busy?”

“I was. And then I got a ton more busy when I learned that the entire Education Program class I was in charge of went off to have a vigilante justice chase after the local Humanity First cell.” Apollo deadpanned. “So I put in my resignation. In two weeks, I’m going back to Mars.”

“I’m sorry…”  I began apologizing, only to get cut off.

“Don’t bullshit me, Krekos, I know you aren’t sorry in the slightest.” Apollo said. “You are not sorry for what you’ve done, you’re sorry for me getting caught up in it or whatever. Well, good news, I don’t feel bad about it in the slightest.”

“You… don’t…?” Bakir tilted his head.

“I don’t.” He confirmed. “Frankly, I accepted this job because I wanted to help only to realize how bad I am at handling people. Since then I kept doing it only because I felt obligated, because who else if not me? But after what happened that night…”

“He managed to somehow drink himself unconscious using exclusively coffee.” Mevik suddenly piped in with a mischievous expression. “Didn’t know humans could do that.”

“Mevik, shush!” Apollo hissed at the venlil. “Anyway, I decided that I should quit and go back home. Find some proper paperwork-oriented job and stick where I am good.”

“I’m coming with him to keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn’t get too comfortable.” Mevik piped in again.

“Okay… Uhm…” I struggled to find words. “Good luck with that…?”

“Thanks.” Apollo spoke and gave me a smirk. “If not for you, I would never have realized how much I hate this job. Oh, and here.”

He put a covered basket on a bedside table next to me.

“Some weird guy showed up to the camp when he heard of you getting hurt and asked me to pass it on. I checked, it’s safe.” Apollo explained. He then pulled his pad out and checked the time. “Alright, that’s all from me. I do still have responsibilities for the next two weeks, so we’ll be going. Try not to recover too fast, ideally not for two weeks.” He said, chuckling. I couldn’t help but let out a chuckle too. With that he waved to us, as did Mevik, and all of us waved back, watching him leave the room.

And as he left, Lena and Reginald turned their attention to me. With them approaching, the other students went ahead and crowded around Ristal’s bed, speaking more quietly to give us space. And as the humans approached…

“Thank you…” Lena carefully put a hand on my chest. “I’d hug you but that would be very bad for your injuries right now. But still, thank you… Thank you so much, Krekos…”

“You saved our son.” Reginald spoke, dipping his head and rubbing at his eyes with his knuckles. “Even though you put yourself at way more of a risk than he was under…”

“I… It was my fault he was threatened in the first place.” I sighed. “I knew I couldn’t just do nothing, so…”

“It’s not your fault.” Lena reached her hand, cupping around my face. “It’s the fault of those vile people. And you… I…” She let out a sob. “When Kenneth went to war, every day we were worried about having to bury our son. Then you showed up and… Even though he was still gone, trying to help you adjust and making you comfortable, it helped us too. Helped me not feel powerless, at least.”

“Even if you were very unreceptive for some time, just having a chance to take care of someone is… good for the mind.” Reginald added.

“Right.” Lena nodded. “And then he was back, and you two hit it off and it really felt like you were a final piece to the family… And when he was  taken, I was so scared, I went back to thinking that I’d have to bury him… Only to get the news that he’s fine and you’re near death instead.” Lena brought her other hand to my head too, holding it with both now. “And the thought of having to bury you scared me just as much. I… I know we’re not quite that close, but me and Reggie were thinking, and… Well, that Intelligence woman already spilled the beans, apparently, but we were thinking of welcoming you into the family properly.”

“Krekos, if we offered to officially adopt you, would you accept…?” Reginald spoke, asking the actual question directly and bluntly.

I wasn’t sure what to say. I wasn’t sure if there was anything to say at all. Maybe it was the painkillers speaking but I had a hard time processing the idea. Getting officially adopted by the Vinces? Jones did mention that I could feasibly act as an independent adult already thanks to Earth’s legal void for alien ages, but if we were to go by krakotl legal standards, I wouldn’t be one for two more years. Not that legal adulthood was nearly as impactful in Federation compared to the way I heard it was on Earth, but still…

I… I wanted to be a part of this family. I basically considered Kenneth a step-sibling and the older Vinces as caretaker figures. But there was always a distance, I thought, me being different from them, disconnected, an outsider…

Unless I just imagined it. Unless it was something I wanted to think to justify keeping the distance myself…

I’d have a lot to talk about with Dr. Cathaway whenever we’ll be having our next session, but for now the answer was clear.

“I… I would.” I answered. “But, uhm… Would I have to take the last name?”

The Vinces exchanged glances and chuckled in delight.

“I don’t think you’d have to if you’d rather not. Aliens don’t really do those, do they?” Lena answered.

“No. And I… am not yet sure if I want it or not, I just… wasn’t sure what else to say.” I mumbled, feeling a bloom forming from embarrassment.

“It’s okay. We were already preparing the documents just in case, and you have time to change your mind.” Reginald said.

“We’d still love you and welcome you back to our home regardless. So don’t feel like you’ll lose anything if you don’t want to commit to it.” Lena reassured me.

“No, I…” I struggled finding any words at all that described whatever it was I was feeling at the moment. “I… do… I just… It’s so much…!”

“Ah. That’s why I said it was a bad time. He’s overwhelmed now.” Reginald nodded.

“Well, you saw what happened when we put it off, this bird just doesn’t know how to stop nearly-dying!” Lena put her hands on her hips in a stern fashion. “So the sooner the offer is on the table, the better.”

“Thank you…” I mumbled, tears forming in my eyes yet again. “Thank you so much…”

Lena carefully wiped my eyes with a thumb and then gave me a kiss on the forehead. It wasn’t the same, but it did make me feel reminiscent of the way my father would occasionally adjust my plumage with his beak…

“Alright, time!” The doctor called out from the hallway. “First the UN Intelligence shows up and locks the patients away in a separate room, then a bunch of visitors in the non-visitation hours, not to mention all the reporters, that’s it! You lot had your time, you can come back during the proper hours. Everyone but the patients, out!

Vinces and my classmates scrambled to leave, all waving to us and saying goodbye. I couldn’t wave back so I just gave a weak nod. Once all of them were gone, the doctor peeked into the room.

“I’ll be over in a few minutes to give you three a proper exam, so no going to sleep there, birdie.” They said before disappearing.

With that the room became silent again. I glanced over to Ristal’s and Kenneth’s beds, as the two settled back in. The feeling of numbness in my body felt like it was slowly starting to fade, as I felt some aching in my wing and chest… Good thing the doctor would be back soon. Presumably with another dose of painkillers.

“Hey, Krekos, by the way… What’s in the basket?” Kenneth asked, pointing to the basket that Apollo left on my bedside.

With some effort, I reached my healthy wing towards it and pulled the cover off, revealing… A small pile of misshapen loaves of bread and a small paper note stuck inbetween. I couldn’t read it without my translator, but I could recognize one word at the bottom of it. A name. ‘Bob’.

I laughed. The other two looked at me in confusion, but I just kept laughing until my chest started to feel sore and aching even past the painkillers.

As much as I berate myself for not changing enough, just thinking back on the way I was when I first met Bob… Maybe I did change. And if I did, it was definitely for the better. And as long as that was true… I could keep going. No matter how painful the way forward would be. As long as I know that I am doing the right thing and I have friends and family by my side, I won’t be stopped. Not by stupid ex-exterminators, not by vengeful human supremacists, not by the allergy that was implanted onto my species. I’d keep trying to find a good life for myself, no matter what.

And maybe, I already have… And all that was left was enjoying it.

Once I was out of the hospital, that is.

except later today i lamented over this to my friend who works at a different JB location and she mentioned the surcharge being only 10% at their location and that they drop the surcharge entirely for regulars/employees/friends of employees... and i almost lost the plot because of this unfairness (hopefully you can understand why a $100 brunch almost wiped me out in this current economy - and before anyone asks, i didn't have the heart to ask my relatives (elderly) to split the cost when it was my treat to take one of their minds off a recent cancer diagnosis)...

my point is, as cheap as i sound, is this inconsistency across surcharge application legal? and if not, is there any way i can be petty and get at least a partial refund? who would i report it to to achieve this?

anyway, i hope everyone fared well this labour day, those working and those not 🙏 sometimes i question if working full time is worth it when the only weekdays off to make plans always have this catch...

Wage growth (WPI) hasn't quite kept up, but it's been between 2% and 4% for the past couple of years. Seems in line with GDP growth.

The rate of unemployment hasn't shifted. I'm not sure about the rate of poverty (for which there are lots of definitions and measurements).

Irving has been with Lumon for awhile. I think he was one of the first test subjects and was in a situation like Gemma, either that or it could even be related to his father. According to the theory above, if Lumon were to sell microchips to sever yourself from ever experiencing a traumatic experience where would they have started? I think starting with military PTSD is a good starting point. Lumon wanted to create something that could 'cure' PTSD and in doing so was able to create 'alters' I feel like this actually could go into a corporate espionage situation, as is hinted at with the [Lexington Letter](https://severance.wiki/severance-_the_lexington_letter_transcript). Maybe Lumon helps create severed soldiers, but that isn't really what I want to get into with Irving. 

I think it is important that we are shown how prepared Irving was and I feel like his outie has a closer connection to his innie than vise versa. (kind of the opposite of Mark) of course when he experiences a 'traumatic' moment ie, Burt 'dying' then he becomes more connected. When he is at home he paints all that he can remember and drinks black coffee to stay awake but also to connect to innie-self. 

I'm thinking that maybe Irving or his father went through a traumatic past, maybe his father had PTSD from serving and decided to do a new procedure called severance to help him with this. I think something went wrong and because Irving's dad meant so much to him he's been trying to uncover what really happened. I don't think its a coincidence that in Irving's chest there was a newspaper clipping about someone getting hurt during work and Lumon lying about it. The first severance chip was made around 20-30 years before the events of the show, as described by Helena's Dad (if helena's age is similar to her actress). This would be plenty of time for Irving's dad to be one of the first test subjects, but of course in the early days it was probably very risky. I think even if Irving wasn't in the army he was still raised by someone who was and is probably empowered to figure out shady stuff thats happening. 

Irving has been preparing himself to be triggered either in the severance wing or in his home and to switch to his other self, thats why he had so much information about severance employees. He also could have either seen the testing floor or had been told about it by someone else cause it is pretty obvious that he's contacted a lot of these employees on the outside. 

I hope this makes sense, i just watched the new episode and read a bunch of theories and now I wanna throw my hat in the ring. lol",3,1740992516.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,1,1.0,False

At the beginning him and I were planning to keep our relationship a secret for a few years but his parents went through his phone and found out about us and wanted to meet me, when I met his parents they made us get “engaged” to be married right away and planned a formal engagement ceremony for when I turn 18. After that they welcomed me into their home and asked for me to come and stay for the weekends at his place and were completely fine with it up until his oldest sister (28 f) started feeding his mother and father false information about how he’s going to jail for being with me since I’m under 18, but in my country legal age of consent with any age is 16. When we cleared that up with his parents his sister ended up running away because she couldn’t feed her parents lies anymore and she wanted to live the life of a woman that use’s and sleeps with men for money. 

After that incident I was at his house on one really hot day and he asked if I could walk to the store and grab some things, so I put on a modest pair of shorts that barely went above my knees as well as a baggy T-shirt and walked outside. While I was outside I saw his older but younger sister (26 f) getting out of her car to come visit their parents after dropping her husband off at his family’s house. As soon as I saw her I politely smiled, said hello and asked if she would like anything from the store, she gave me a shocked dirty look and said no. I accidentally forgot my wallet in the house and as I went to grab it his sister started screaming at me telling me that I’m a dirty whore for wearing such provocative things out in public and how her brother should be disgusted with me for obviously seeking attention from other men, before this I asked my boyfriend if what I was wearing was okay and he said yes. As she was yelling at me I kept apologizing over and over again saying that I would change and that I didn’t mean to offend her in any way but she kept throwing insults at me. Their parents got involved after a few minutes telling her that what I was wearing was appropriate and for her to stop, as she was busy with her parents and my boyfriend I went to go change but she chased after me saying that her brother didn’t need to be with a dirty whore like me and then left the house. 
A week later I sent her a message that read this. “Hello (insert name) its (insert name) I just wanted to send you a message because I really thought we got off on the wrong foot and I don’t want to leave everything like that. I am sorry if I offended you and your family by what I was wearing and I’m not going to make any excuses for myself because now I understand that I shouldn’t wear things like that in front of your family and especially in front of your brother, it was very inappropriate of me to do that and for it I apologize. But I don’t want us to be on edgy terms with each other and I’d really like to get to know you and for you to get to know me, so if you ever just wanted to sit down and talk with me I’d be super happy to do that with you and you and I can go grab a coffee and have a one on one chat and just have a girls day with each other. I know you are super busy with work but I’d really like for you to get to know what kind of person I am, but until then I hope you have a wonderful week!” She replied to me saying “Hey (insert name) Thanks for your message, I also apologize, perhaps I may have overreacted. Let’s do that someday! Until then, take it easy and work hard in school!”

After this I’ve seen her multiple times at their parents house and I have always been nothing but kind and respectful to her and her family and thought that we were getting on good terms. But today my boyfriend received this message “ Can you please save our family’s reputation and leave (my name)? You’re going to destroy our family’s name. If you continue to be with her I will never speak to you again.” “(My boyfriend) why can’t you just be happy for me? She has done nothing to you all but be generous and kind.” “(Sister) she is useless, she doesn’t help mom at home, doesn’t clean or cook, and sits around all day like a bum. Not even studying in school, will not even be able to afford a life. She’s just a problem, and especially your going to make mom and dad so ashamed they’re not even going to be able to show their faces out in public because you are with that dirty white girl.” “(My boyfriend) You don’t even know what she does during the week. She’s top of her class, she takes care of her sick grandmother, and on top of that she cooks, cleans, and does almost everything. She’s even taking a course to learn our language and culture to convert” “(sister) If you are that selfish I am disgusted with you. Tell her to stop coming over until she gets her life together, gets a job and is your wife. You should be ashamed of yourself.” “(My boyfriend) She’s comfortable enough to come here and relax with us from all the hard work she does at home. You are the selfish one for looking down on her when you have made no effort in getting to know who she is or what she does.” “(Sister) you cannot even call yourself a Muslim. You are sleeping in the same room and hugging each other I am disgusted to even call yourself my brother. Shame on you, you should be ashamed of yourself for even having the blessed name of Mohammad you don’t even deserve it.” “(My boyfriend) She loves me and I love her and I have never found that with any of the girls mom and dad forced me to talk to, all they care about is money. (My name) is kind and has always been there for me when none of you were so no I am not ashamed to love the most amazing and resilient woman I have ever had the pleasure to come across.” “(Sister) she is disgusting. Look at her dirty white devil skin, I am disgusted every time I see that slut little white girl. She isn’t worthy enough to even breathe our air” “(my boyfriend) how dare you speak of my future wife that way. She has been nothing but kind to you when she had every reason not to. She has done everything we have asked of her and is an angel from our god.” “(Sister) she was not born Muslim so therefore she is a dirty white devil. She is scum on the earth for even existing.” “(My boyfriend) how is she scum in her own country. How dare you have the audacity to even speak of her this way, after this you are no longer part of my life. Goodbye.” 

Here is where I might be the AH. After my boyfriend showed me this conversation I took it upon myself to send her a message personally and this is what I said. “I get that you don’t like me and think I’m a disgrace to your family but I love your brother whether you can see that or you can’t , just because I am white does not define who I am as a person. I could be black, asian, Mexican, Indian, or Afghani, and I would still be the same person I built myself up to be today. All I wanted was a sister in law that I could go out for coffee with or go shopping with and now we cannot have that because all you see is my white skin. I respected you as his sister but now I cannot respect you as a person at all because it is completely racist to hate someone based off of their skin colour. I have been nothing but kind to you and your family and I have respected your rules. You are the most disgraceful and racist human being I have ever come across and as of now you are below nothing to me and (boyfriend’s name). You want to talk about human scum take a look in the mirror and then go shove it.” And after that I blocked her and haven’t spoken to her since.

1j2egli,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1j2egli/the_game/,The Game,"I was sitting on the couch, TV on, beer in hand, and a smile gracing my lips. I had done it. I had finally finished the game started by my father. And now that I was done, I was free. There wasn’t going to be any more doubt in my mind about my next immediate action, whether or not this would be the wrong choice, whether it would be my last. I had won.

I glanced down at myself—khaki pants, brown loafers, and a blood-stained button-up blue striped shirt. For a second, my smile faded, reminding myself what I had to do in order to be free. But it wasn’t long before that smile returned, because that was it. I was free. And that is all that matters right now. It didn’t matter that there were red and blue lights flashing from the other side of my dusty brown curtains that covered a mostly intact window, it didn’t matter that the only food in the fridge was weeks old and moldy, and it didn’t matter that the stains on the rug I had tried desperately to remove still showed through. All that matters is the simple fact that I can move on. That the echo of my father’s words no longer cursed me.

""Son, the game isn't just something you play. It's something that plays you. Something you live. And if you're going to win... it’s going to cost you.""

There was a loud banging on the door. And a voice, deep and bellowing. I wasn’t able to comprehend what they were saying, but it sounded important. Important, I thought about that for a second, when is something ever truly important? To all parties involved, to some, what may seem important to me is trivial. And it works the other way around too. Like a child asking his father if he could please get him some new toy. It may be important to the child, but to me, I don’t give a fuck about that little shit's toy. No, I suppose the banging on the door wasn’t important. And it wasn’t important when the door was smashed in and fell from its hinges to lay across my living room floor. It was hardly even important when the two huge men in blue uniforms charged into my home, pistols drawn, grabbing me and slamming me into the floor while pulling my arms behind my back.

Because I was free. That’s what is important. That’s the only thing that is and has ever been important—the prospect of being, totally and utterly, free.

There were lots of lights in the dark night as I was taken from my home—red, blue, and bright whites. Noises too, voices, too many voices too loud and from so many different places, and engines running. I was unceremoniously put into the back seat of a car. It wasn’t very comfortable, but that wasn’t important. My wrists were bent at awkward angles and the metal from the handcuffs chafed them slightly. But I didn’t mind. I had a lot of time to think that night as I sat behind the cold iron bars. And of course, my thoughts always brought me back to that game, that goddamned game.

I’m not sure if I could tell you exactly what the point of the game was, only that there were winners. And there were losers as well. And trust me when I say, you never wanted to be one of the losers. There were rules to this game, of course, as there are rules to most games, but the rules were never static. You had to watch for signs of the rules changing in the world around you, you had to listen and smell and look so carefully, so very carefully because if you missed a rule and you broke it—well, that was it. There’s no going back, you just lose. So I watched, and I listened, and I breathed in the air around me. Everywhere I went, sometimes I caught them in a flash—the quick flick of someone’s lips starting to smile, then suddenly disappearing, as they passed by me on the sidewalk, the smell of a normally pleasant flower stand being slightly off, or the barking of a dog coming from the mouth of a raven for just a single second. If I had missed any of these or the countless others, I don’t want to even think about where I’d be right now. Probably I’d be in the same place as all of them, the things that make these rules. Joining them in their games, but as a piece this time instead of a player.

My thoughts were stopped suddenly by the raking of metal against the bars. Another man, slightly shorter than the first two I encountered that night, also wearing a blue uniform, was seemingly trying to get my attention. His mouth moved, and his eyes fixed on me. His words, each seemed to make sense when put next to each other. However, his intentions were still lost on me. I sat there, straight-backed, and smiled, nodding my head slightly. It was the polite thing to do. I had done it growing up, whenever talking to someone and I didn’t quite catch what they were saying, I would simply smile and nod. However, I don’t think he took it as polite; his face furrowed, brow creasing, and his eyes became darker, to the point where the whites of his eyes were completely hidden from me.

He pulled a chain of keys attached by a cord from his belt and unclasped the heavy metal lock on the cell’s door, and slid the bars to the side. He motioned with his hand for me to walk with him. I stood, hands still locked behind my back, and followed his directions. I was led down a corridor with yellowish fluorescent lights lighting the way, the faint smell of piss hit my nose, a moment later it was replaced by the refreshing aroma of coffee. Just then the man stopped in front of an open door on the right that led into a small room with a table, two chairs on one side, one on the other. He looked at me, and again he spoke, it all seemed perfectly reasonable except I had no idea what he wanted. So I smiled, and nodded, and stood there. His frustrations seemed to return, face returning to that pinched expression, eyes black. He grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the single chair on the opposite side of the table. I understood and sat.

The man left, closing the door behind him. I sat and waited, for what, I wasn’t sure. But I enjoyed the peace of that lonely room, the feel of the brushed aluminum chair I sat in, that seemed to have been bolted to the ground. The flickering of those yellow lights above me, and the slight buzz of electricity that came with them. There was one thing in that room I didn’t like, however—a large mirror against the wall directly in front of me. It showed me more of the room, sure, but everything was wrong. Backwards. Everything was the same way they would see it.

""A world turned inside out, where everything you thought you knew is a lie, and every truth is a curse waiting to be broken.""

That’s what my father had told me about them. That’s all he told me about them, but I knew he knew more. He spent so much time talking to them, begging them, pleading with them. I knew he could have told me more about what was to come. About the pain I had to bring to the other players in order to win. But he kept it secret; sometimes I wonder whether that was because he didn’t want to burden me with knowing what had to come if I was going to win, or if it was because he didn’t want to lose.

It didn’t matter in the end. He did lose, and I had won. I tried to make it quick, out of the love I still had buried in my heart for my father. As quick as I could, at least, while still following the rules. It was strange, he didn’t react in the same way the others had, there was no screaming, no fighting. It just seemed like he was content with this turn of events. Like he had already accepted that he was just going to be another loser, and I was going to be the winner. He hardly even whimpered as I was tearing the skin away from his body, carefully, making sure not to damage any of the muscle underneath. I had tried to prop him against the wall so that his blood would drain quicker, leaving him less time to suffer. But he did still suffer. I had wished the rules were different for him, but there’s no sense in trying to escape what had to be done to win.

The door opened, two men walked in, both wearing long brown coats that were damp from the rain outside. One of the men had red hair, and he was carrying a styrofoam cup that steamed and brought with it that relaxing smell of coffee. The other, black-haired, carried no cup that had no pleasant smell to accompany it. However, he did have a brown folder tucked under one arm. They made their way to the seats across from me, the red-haired man sitting first while the black-haired one stared at me for a moment. I stared back and smiled. The smile was not reciprocated, just the quick pinching of his face before he returned to his expressionless facade. He sat next to the red-haired man and began moving his lips, uttering words and making gestures with his hands. I kept my smile and nodded slowly. His mouth stopped moving, the words stopped, and he quickly glanced at the red-haired man and then back to me. The red-haired man raised his styrofoam cup to his lips and breathed in the steam, I caught a whiff of the sour scent of mold; however, he did not seem to mind. He took a sip and set the cup on the table. There I could see it was filled with dark liquid with a brown film swirling around the surface. I stared at it for a moment, watching the film slowly spiral in the cup, watching as it slowed down until it finally stopped rotating. I continued to watch as it started circling again, however, in the other direction this time.

The red-haired man interrupted my thoughts with his words. His words were soft-spoken, yet they seemed to carry tremendous meaning to him. I could see it in his face, his eyes shone bright, and his jaw was clenched slightly. I tried to convey understanding to the plight I assumed he was having by softening my features, and tilting my head slightly as I nodded. I let the smile fall from my lips and rest flat against my face. The red-haired man stopped talking and just looked at me. His eyes burned into my own. I stared back, intently enough that I could make out my own reflection in the blacks of his eyes. I caught it for a second before it just disappeared. I blinked and refocused on the red-haired man, but that look was gone. He sat straight and cleared his expression.

The black-haired man pushed his brown folder forward on the table and opened it so I could see the contents. It was filled with pictures, mostly of people, some of objects. Of the pictures of the people, they were all ones I had once known, and of the objects, I recognized them all. So in understanding, I looked at the black-haired man, smiled, and nodded. The black-haired man’s mouth started moving again, I could see the muscles around his eyes straining, he looked tired. I gestured with my head, nodding it towards the red-haired man’s coffee while keeping my eyes locked with the black-haired man. He did not seem to want the coffee.

Instead of taking the cup and sipping from it, he pointed to one of the pictures. It was of a woman, brown hair, blue eyes, 27 years old. Her name was Lisa, and her birthday was July 17th, 1997. Her arms were not attached to her body in this picture, they were laying above her head, overlapping each other, forming the general shape of a cross. There was rope around her neck, waist, and legs that was tied to keep her down, and the large kitchen knife that I had used to saw her arms off was laying unceremoniously next to her. There was no rule about what to do with the knife when I was finished, so I had just left it with her in her apartment after the party. This very well might be one of the last pictures taken of my sister; it was important to me.

I looked back to the black-haired man and nodded. He stared for a moment, then moved his finger to another picture, this one of a man. 28 years old, brown hair, once brown eyes, born on October 21st, 1996, died on March 15th, 2025. His favorite thing to do in his free time was go fishing with his friends. In the picture, his abdomen was cut open, and his entrails were set to the side. His eyes were missing, from the photo, however, I still had them. For this part of the game, I was required to gut my best friend properly while blindfolded, and so I was rewarded with his eyes as I completed the challenge. I smiled remembering all the fun me and Chris used to have.

The black-haired man continued pointing at pictures of my friends and family, and I continued to reminisce, smiling and even laughing at some of the funnier memories I had shared with these people. If only they could see me now. A winner. I'm sure they'd be proud and we'd all go out and celebrate. The black-haired man pointed at the last photo, an older man with grey hair. He had crow’s feet at the sides of his eyes and a big bushy mustache that normally covered half of his smiling mouth. There was no smile in the photo. The man was stripped naked, of both clothes, as well as skin from the neck down. Slouched against the wall. His skin draped over the couch on the right of him like a throw blanket. My father, the man who had started this game, the man who had selfishly dragged me into it. And the man who had selflessly worked two jobs for years to be able to provide for me and my sister after our mother passed away. He was a man with flaws, sure, but he was a good man until the very end.

I smiled and leaned back as far as I could in my chair with my hands still cuffed behind my back. I had won, the game was over, and I could finally live my life in peace. I was thrilled by the thought, and I couldn’t help but laugh. The black-haired man started speaking, and I smiled and nodded vigorously, fully accepting the high that came with being done with the game. I looked back at the red-haired man. He looked to me and a smile played across his lips, then suddenly it disappeared.

1j2egl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1j2egl7/100_remote_work/,100% Remote Work?,"For me, yes. After five years of working fully remotely, here’s my personal assessment: the good and the bad—super summarized.



# Pros:

✅ **Time optimization:** No commuting means more hours for myself. Plus, I use my breaks to do household chores, so they don’t pile up at the end of the day.  
✅ **Geographical freedom:** I can live wherever I want.  
✅ **Higher productivity:** This is very subjective, but at home, I have a controlled environment with no distractions. My productivity skyrockets.  
✅ **More flexibility:** I organize my workday my way. I can adjust my schedule to better fit my lifestyle. For example, if I don’t have meetings, I go to the gym in the morning and then reschedule my work for the afternoon.  
✅ **Financial savings:** No need for transportation, lower expenses on gas and eating out.



# Cons:

❌ **Less social interaction:** No spontaneous chats or coffee breaks with colleagues.  
❌ **Lower energy levels:** In winter, with a 9-to-6 work schedule, you barely see the sunlight. This affects your mood, and if you also work in your bedroom, it's easy to fall into a bad morning routine—straight from bed to the computer.  
❌ **Physical health issues:** Poor ergonomic posture and increased sedentary behavior can impact your health in the long run.  
❌ **Difficulty disconnecting:** If you don’t set boundaries, work can invade your personal time.



# 🔹 Conclusion:

Remote work isn’t for everyone, but in my case, the balance clearly tips in its favor.

  
❗ **And finally, a funny anecdote:** Once delivery drivers and your neighbors realize you're always home, they'll start sending all their packages to you. If that happens, maybe it’s time to go back to the office… 😂

  
👉 **And you, what do you prefer?**",3,1740992125.0,remotework,5,0.8,False
1j2eg4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1j2eg4x/the_game/,The Game,"I was sitting on the couch, TV on, beer in hand, and a smile gracing my lips. I had done it. I had finally finished the game started by my father. And now that I was done, I was free. There wasn’t going to be any more doubt in my mind about my next immediate action, whether or not this would be the wrong choice, whether it would be my last. I had won.

I glanced down at myself—khaki pants, brown loafers, and a blood-stained button-up blue striped shirt. For a second, my smile faded, reminding myself what I had to do in order to be free. But it wasn’t long before that smile returned, because that was it. I was free. And that is all that matters right now. It didn’t matter that there were red and blue lights flashing from the other side of my dusty brown curtains that covered a mostly intact window, it didn’t matter that the only food in the fridge was weeks old and moldy, and it didn’t matter that the stains on the rug I had tried desperately to remove still showed through. All that matters is the simple fact that I can move on. That the echo of my father’s words no longer cursed me.

""Son, the game isn't just something you play. It's something that plays you. Something you live. And if you're going to win... it’s going to cost you.""

There was a loud banging on the door. And a voice, deep and bellowing. I wasn’t able to comprehend what they were saying, but it sounded important. Important, I thought about that for a second, when is something ever truly important? To all parties involved, to some, what may seem important to me is trivial. And it works the other way around too. Like a child asking his father if he could please get him some new toy. It may be important to the child, but to me, I don’t give a fuck about that little shit's toy. No, I suppose the banging on the door wasn’t important. And it wasn’t important when the door was smashed in and fell from its hinges to lay across my living room floor. It was hardly even important when the two huge men in blue uniforms charged into my home, pistols drawn, grabbing me and slamming me into the floor while pulling my arms behind my back.

Because I was free. That’s what is important. That’s the only thing that is and has ever been important—the prospect of being, totally and utterly, free.

There were lots of lights in the dark night as I was taken from my home—red, blue, and bright whites. Noises too, voices, too many voices too loud and from so many different places, and engines running. I was unceremoniously put into the back seat of a car. It wasn’t very comfortable, but that wasn’t important. My wrists were bent at awkward angles and the metal from the handcuffs chafed them slightly. But I didn’t mind. I had a lot of time to think that night as I sat behind the cold iron bars. And of course, my thoughts always brought me back to that game, that goddamned game.

I’m not sure if I could tell you exactly what the point of the game was, only that there were winners. And there were losers as well. And trust me when I say, you never wanted to be one of the losers. There were rules to this game, of course, as there are rules to most games, but the rules were never static. You had to watch for signs of the rules changing in the world around you, you had to listen and smell and look so carefully, so very carefully because if you missed a rule and you broke it—well, that was it. There’s no going back, you just lose. So I watched, and I listened, and I breathed in the air around me. Everywhere I went, sometimes I caught them in a flash—the quick flick of someone’s lips starting to smile, then suddenly disappearing, as they passed by me on the sidewalk, the smell of a normally pleasant flower stand being slightly off, or the barking of a dog coming from the mouth of a raven for just a single second. If I had missed any of these or the countless others, I don’t want to even think about where I’d be right now. Probably I’d be in the same place as all of them, the things that make these rules. Joining them in their games, but as a piece this time instead of a player.

My thoughts were stopped suddenly by the raking of metal against the bars. Another man, slightly shorter than the first two I encountered that night, also wearing a blue uniform, was seemingly trying to get my attention. His mouth moved, and his eyes fixed on me. His words, each seemed to make sense when put next to each other. However, his intentions were still lost on me. I sat there, straight-backed, and smiled, nodding my head slightly. It was the polite thing to do. I had done it growing up, whenever talking to someone and I didn’t quite catch what they were saying, I would simply smile and nod. However, I don’t think he took it as polite; his face furrowed, brow creasing, and his eyes became darker, to the point where the whites of his eyes were completely hidden from me.

He pulled a chain of keys attached by a cord from his belt and unclasped the heavy metal lock on the cell’s door, and slid the bars to the side. He motioned with his hand for me to walk with him. I stood, hands still locked behind my back, and followed his directions.

The past few years since COVID have been a downward spiral for me. I got heavily addicted to weed at first, which eventually led to benzos and heavy psychedelics. Over time, I lost all sense of purpose and direction, putting drugs before everything else. I’m now in my mid-to-late 20s, just moved back to the area, and trying to figure out what I actually want from life.

Before all this, I had so many passions—I was a high-level athlete, graduated college with a bachelor’s degree, and had ambitions. But none of that ever materialized into anything because of my drug dependency. I tried treatment twice, but it just didn’t work for me. I don’t do well in locked, overly structured environments. I feel like the only way forward is to be out in the real world, facing these challenges head-on.

I’m posting here because I want to start meeting people who are also into self-improvement, getting after it physically, and just living life. If anyone wants to grab coffee, go on hikes, hit the gym, or do something active like kickboxing, mountain biking, or jiu-jitsu/MMA, I’d love to connect. I need to rebuild a life outside of the cycle I’ve been stuck in, and I figure surrounding myself with the right people is the best way to do that.

Are you right now eating a donut that “you had to eat” (as in “all colleagues went for a coffee after lunch and all bought donuts, so you had to buy one, too”)? Or you had no time for lunch  so “it is better to eat something, or I will be extremely hungry at night”, so you are now eating burger and drinking cola, and to compensate the feeling of guilt you  promise you will start diet on Monday? Who or what exactly decides what comes into your body?



Food decisions is a serious research area in the field of psychology. Path to your stomach crosses all your experiences (all the way from childhood!), habits, the company during your meals, the ad you saw yesterday and emotions you experience, decisions on where you will buy food, how you will prepare it, how much you will cook, how will you preserve the leftovers, do you like washing dishes and multiple others (1;6). Your attitudes about importance of taking care of your health, natural content of the food, body weight control and ethics of food production can significantly change what is on your plate (2). 



It is not less important whether food smells nice, is usual to you, has an acceptable price, does not require too much time from you and finally – whether it is means to get additional benefits, like socialize (3; 6). Yes, coffee with colleagues in the paragraph above may win over lonely salad, especially if thee will be other factors supporting colleagues and donuts – bad day at work, poor mood, need to discuss work issues that you did not have enough time and similar. Close relationships are especially important to teenagers (4).



WHAT we eat and how MUCH we eat are not parts of the same decision. Most eating advisors agree that you can eat anything sometimes and in limited quantities. And when you start discussing the quantities, it becomes much more complicated. Let’s say you buy pizza, and it is available only in large size – you will likely eat more than if you bought a small one, even if it the big one did not taste good. You will also likely eat everything you have on your plate. A view of an empty plate contributes to the sense of satiety (it also may be culture specific). You will likely eat more if your meal is called “healthy” or “fat free” – regardless of what it really is – just because you “have a licence” to not care about it (5).



But most of all I would like to stress this: everything that you put in your mouth is your decision. A considerate, mindful eating is a straight road to your chosen way of eating, food quality and quantity. You make every decision (except for cases of some very rare diseases). You only make poor decisions when you push yourself into the corner and not give yourself enough time (even though few decisions are more important than that) or give yourself quite poor excuses or habits.

I had done it. I had finally finished the game started by my father. And now that I was done, I was free. There wasn’t going to be any more doubt in my mind about my next immediate action, whether or not this would be the wrong choice, whether it would be my last. I had won.

I glanced down at myself—khaki pants, brown loafers, and a blood-stained button-up blue striped shirt. For a second, my smile faded, reminding myself what I had to do in order to be free. But it wasn’t long before that smile returned, because that was it. I was free. And that is all that matters right now. It didn’t matter that there were red and blue lights flashing from the other side of my dusty brown curtains that covered a mostly intact window, it didn’t matter that the only food in the fridge was weeks old and moldy, and it didn’t matter that the stains on the rug I had tried desperately to remove still showed through. All that matters is the simple fact that I can move on. That the echo of my father’s words no longer cursed me.

""Son, the game isn't just something you play. It's something that plays you. Something you live. And if you're going to win... it’s going to cost you.""

There was a loud banging on the door. And a voice, deep and bellowing. I wasn’t able to comprehend what they were saying, but it sounded important. Important, I thought about that for a second, when is something ever truly important? To all parties involved, to some, what may seem important to me is trivial. And it works the other way around too. Like a child asking his father if he could please get him some new toy. It may be important to the child, but to me, I don’t give a fuck about that little shit's toy. No, I suppose the banging on the door wasn’t important. And it wasn’t important when the door was smashed in and fell from its hinges to lay across my living room floor. It was hardly even important when the two huge men in blue uniforms charged into my home, pistols drawn, grabbing me and slamming me into the floor while pulling my arms behind my back.

Because I was free. That’s what is important. That’s the only thing that is and has ever been important—the prospect of being, totally and utterly, free.

There were lots of lights in the dark night as I was taken from my home—red, blue, and bright whites. Noises too, voices, too many voices too loud and from so many different places, and engines running. I was unceremoniously put into the back seat of a car. It wasn’t very comfortable, but that wasn’t important. My wrists were bent at awkward angles and the metal from the handcuffs chafed them slightly. But I didn’t mind. I had a lot of time to think that night as I sat behind the cold iron bars. And of course, my thoughts always brought me back to that game, that goddamned game.

I’m not sure if I could tell you exactly what the point of the game was, only that there were winners. And there were losers as well. And trust me when I say, you never wanted to be one of the losers. There were rules to this game, of course, as there are rules to most games, but the rules were never static. You had to watch for signs of the rules changing in the world around you, you had to listen and smell and look so carefully, so very carefully because if you missed a rule and you broke it—well, that was it. There’s no going back, you just lose. So I watched, and I listened, and I breathed in the air around me. Everywhere I went, sometimes I caught them in a flash—the quick flick of someone’s lips starting to smile, then suddenly disappearing, as they passed by me on the sidewalk, the smell of a normally pleasant flower stand being slightly off, or the barking of a dog coming from the mouth of a raven for just a single second. If I had missed any of these or the countless others, I don’t want to even think about where I’d be right now. Probably I’d be in the same place as all of them, the things that make these rules. Joining them in their games, but as a piece this time instead of a player.

My thoughts were stopped suddenly by the raking of metal against the bars. Another man, slightly shorter than the first two I encountered that night, also wearing a blue uniform, was seemingly trying to get my attention. His mouth moved, and his eyes fixed on me. His words, each seemed to make sense when put next to each other. However, his intentions were still lost on me. I sat there, straight-backed, and smiled, nodding my head slightly. It was the polite thing to do. I had done it growing up, whenever talking to someone and I didn’t quite catch what they were saying, I would simply smile and nod. However, I don’t think he took it as polite; his face furrowed, brow creasing, and his eyes became darker, to the point where the whites of his eyes were completely hidden from me.

He pulled a chain of keys attached by a cord from his belt and unclasped the heavy metal lock on the cell’s door, and slid the bars to the side. He motioned with his hand for me to walk with him. I stood, hands still locked behind my back, and followed his directions. I was led down a corridor with yellowish fluorescent lights lighting the way, the faint smell of piss hit my nose, a moment later it was replaced by the refreshing aroma of coffee. Just then the man stopped in front of an open door on the right that led into a small room with a table, two chairs on one side, one on the other. He looked at me, and again he spoke, it all seemed perfectly reasonable except I had no idea what he wanted. So I smiled, and nodded, and stood there. His frustrations seemed to return, face returning to that pinched expression, eyes black. He grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the single chair on the opposite side of the table. I understood and sat.

The man left, closing the door behind him. I sat and waited, for what, I wasn’t sure. But I enjoyed the peace of that lonely room, the feel of the brushed aluminum chair I sat in, that seemed to have been bolted to the ground. The flickering of those yellow lights above me, and the slight buzz of electricity that came with them. There was one thing in that room I didn’t like, however—a large mirror against the wall directly in front of me. It showed me more of the room, sure, but everything was wrong. Backwards. Everything was the same way they would see it.

""A world turned inside out, where everything you thought you knew is a lie, and every truth is a curse waiting to be broken.""

That’s what my father had told me about them. That’s all he told me about them, but I knew he knew more. He spent so much time talking to them, begging them, pleading with them. I knew he could have told me more about what was to come. About the pain I had to bring to the other players in order to win. But he kept it secret; sometimes I wonder whether that was because he didn’t want to burden me with knowing what had to come if I was going to win, or if it was because he didn’t want to lose.

It didn’t matter in the end. He did lose, and I had won. I tried to make it quick, out of the love I still had buried in my heart for my father. As quick as I could, at least, while still following the rules. It was strange, he didn’t react in the same way the others had, there was no screaming, no fighting. It just seemed like he was content with this turn of events. Like he had already accepted that he was just going to be another loser, and I was going to be the winner. He hardly even whimpered as I was tearing the skin away from his body, carefully, making sure not to damage any of the muscle underneath. I had tried to prop him against the wall so that his blood would drain quicker, leaving him less time to suffer. But he did still suffer. I had wished the rules were different for him, but there’s no sense in trying to escape what had to be done to win.

The door opened, two men walked in, both wearing long brown coats that were damp from the rain outside. One of the men had red hair, and he was carrying a styrofoam cup that steamed and brought with it that relaxing smell of coffee. The other, black-haired, carried no cup that had no pleasant smell to accompany it. However, he did have a brown folder tucked under one arm. They made their way to the seats across from me, the red-haired man sitting first while the black-haired one stared at me for a moment. I stared back and smiled. The smile was not reciprocated, just the quick pinching of his face before he returned to his expressionless facade. He sat next to the red-haired man and began moving his lips, uttering words and making gestures with his hands. I kept my smile and nodded slowly. His mouth stopped moving, the words stopped, and he quickly glanced at the red-haired man and then back to me. The red-haired man raised his styrofoam cup to his lips and breathed in the steam, I caught a whiff of the sour scent of mold; however, he did not seem to mind. He took a sip and set the cup on the table. There I could see it was filled with dark liquid with a brown film swirling around the surface. I stared at it for a moment, watching the film slowly spiral in the cup, watching as it slowed down until it finally stopped rotating. I continued to watch as it started circling again, however, in the other direction this time.

The red-haired man interrupted my thoughts with his words. His words were soft-spoken, yet they seemed to carry tremendous meaning to him. I could see it in his face, his eyes shone bright, and his jaw was clenched slightly. I tried to convey understanding to the plight I assumed he was having by softening my features, and tilting my head slightly as I nodded. I let the smile fall from my lips and rest flat against my face. The red-haired man stopped talking and just looked at me. His eyes burned into my own. I stared back, intently enough that I could make out my own reflection in the blacks of his eyes. I caught it for a second before it just disappeared. I blinked and refocused on the red-haired man, but that look was gone. He sat straight and cleared his expression.

The black-haired man pushed his brown folder forward on the table and opened it so I could see the contents. It was filled with pictures, mostly of people, some of objects. Of the pictures of the people, they were all ones I had once known, and of the objects, I recognized them all. So in understanding, I looked at the black-haired man, smiled, and nodded. The black-haired man’s mouth started moving again, I could see the muscles around his eyes straining, he looked tired. I gestured with my head, nodding it towards the red-haired man’s coffee while keeping my eyes locked with the black-haired man. He did not seem to want the coffee.

Instead of taking the cup and sipping from it, he pointed to one of the pictures. It was of a woman, brown hair, blue eyes, 27 years old. Her name was Lisa, and her birthday was July 17th, 1997. Her arms were not attached to her body in this picture, they were laying above her head, overlapping each other, forming the general shape of a cross. There was rope around her neck, waist, and legs that was tied to keep her down, and the large kitchen knife that I had used to saw her arms off was laying unceremoniously next to her. There was no rule about what to do with the knife when I was finished, so I had just left it with her in her apartment after the party. This very well might be one of the last pictures taken of my sister; it was important to me.

I looked back to the black-haired man and nodded. He stared for a moment, then moved his finger to another picture, this one of a man. 28 years old, brown hair, once brown eyes, born on October 21st, 1996, died on March 15th, 2025. His favorite thing to do in his free time was go fishing with his friends. In the picture, his abdomen was cut open, and his entrails were set to the side. His eyes were missing, from the photo, however, I still had them. For this part of the game, I was required to gut my best friend properly while blindfolded, and so I was rewarded with his eyes as I completed the challenge. I smiled remembering all the fun me and Chris used to have.

The black-haired man continued pointing at pictures of my friends and family, and I continued to reminisce, smiling and even laughing at some of the funnier memories I had shared with these people. If only they could see me now. A winner. I'm sure they'd be proud and we'd all go out and celebrate. The black-haired man pointed at the last photo, an older man with grey hair. He had crow’s feet at the sides of his eyes and a big bushy mustache that normally covered half of his smiling mouth. There was no smile in the photo. The man was stripped naked, of both clothes, as well as skin from the neck down. Slouched against the wall. His skin draped over the couch on the right of him like a throw blanket. My father, the man who had started this game, the man who had selfishly dragged me into it. And the man who had selflessly worked two jobs for years to be able to provide for me and my sister after our mother passed away. He was a man with flaws, sure, but he was a good man until the very end.

I smiled and leaned back as far as I could in my chair with my hands still cuffed behind my back. I had won, the game was over, and I could finally live my life in peace. I was thrilled by the thought, and I couldn’t help but laugh. The black-haired man started speaking, and I smiled and nodded vigorously, fully accepting the high that came with being done with the game. I looked back at the red-haired man. He looked to me and a smile played across his lips, then suddenly it disappeared.

The past few years since COVID have been a downward spiral for me. I got heavily addicted to weed at first, which eventually led to benzos and heavy psychedelics. Over time, I lost all sense of purpose and direction, putting drugs before everything else. I’m now in my mid-to-late 20s, just moved back to the area, and trying to figure out what I actually want from life.

Before all this, I had so many passions—I was a high-level athlete, graduated college with a bachelor’s degree, and had ambitions. But none of that ever materialized into anything because of my drug dependency. I tried treatment twice, but it just didn’t work for me. I don’t do well in locked, overly structured environments. I feel like the only way forward is to be out in the real world, facing these challenges head-on.

I’m posting here because I want to start meeting people who are also into self-improvement, getting after it physically, and just living life. If anyone wants to grab coffee, go on hikes, hit the gym, or do something active like kickboxing, mountain biking, or jiu-jitsu/MMA, I’d love to connect. I need to rebuild a life outside of the cycle I’ve been stuck in, and I figure surrounding myself with the right people is the best way to do that.

If this resonates with you, shoot me a message. Let’s get after it.",5,1740991378.0,irvine,1,1.0,False
1j2eaq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoryIdeas/comments/1j2eaq6/the_game_this_is_my_first_story_and_id_like_to/,The Game {this is my first story and id like to hear criticism},"I was sitting on the couch, TV on, beer in hand, and a smile gracing my lips. I had done it. I had finally finished the game started by my father. And now that I was done, I was free. There wasn’t going to be any more doubt in my mind about my next immediate action, whether or not this would be the wrong choice, whether it would be my last. I had won.

I glanced down at myself—khaki pants, brown loafers, and a blood-stained button-up blue striped shirt. For a second, my smile faded, reminding myself what I had to do in order to be free. But it wasn’t long before that smile returned, because that was it. I was free. And that is all that matters right now. It didn’t matter that there were red and blue lights flashing from the other side of my dusty brown curtains that covered a mostly intact window, it didn’t matter that the only food in the fridge was weeks old and moldy, and it didn’t matter that the stains on the rug I had tried desperately to remove still showed through. All that matters is the simple fact that I can move on. That the echo of my father’s words no longer cursed me.

""Son, the game isn't just something you play. It's something that plays you. Something you live. And if you're going to win... it’s going to cost you.""

There was a loud banging on the door. And a voice, deep and bellowing. I wasn’t able to comprehend what they were saying, but it sounded important. Important, I thought about that for a second, when is something ever truly important? To all parties involved, to some, what may seem important to me is trivial. And it works the other way around too. Like a child asking his father if he could please get him some new toy. It may be important to the child, but to me, I don’t give a fuck about that little shit's toy. No, I suppose the banging on the door wasn’t important. And it wasn’t important when the door was smashed in and fell from its hinges to lay across my living room floor. It was hardly even important when the two huge men in blue uniforms charged into my home, pistols drawn, grabbing me and slamming me into the floor while pulling my arms behind my back.

Because I was free. That’s what is important. That’s the only thing that is and has ever been important—the prospect of being, totally and utterly, free.

There were lots of lights in the dark night as I was taken from my home—red, blue, and bright whites. Noises too, voices, too many voices too loud and from so many different places, and engines running. I was unceremoniously put into the back seat of a car. It wasn’t very comfortable, but that wasn’t important. My wrists were bent at awkward angles and the metal from the handcuffs chafed them slightly. But I didn’t mind. I had a lot of time to think that night as I sat behind the cold iron bars. And of course, my thoughts always brought me back to that game, that goddamned game.

I’m not sure if I could tell you exactly what the point of the game was, only that there were winners. And there were losers as well. And trust me when I say, you never wanted to be one of the losers. There were rules to this game, of course, as there are rules to most games, but the rules were never static. You had to watch for signs of the rules changing in the world around you, you had to listen and smell and look so carefully, so very carefully because if you missed a rule and you broke it—well, that was it. There’s no going back, you just lose. So I watched, and I listened, and I breathed in the air around me. Everywhere I went, sometimes I caught them in a flash—the quick flick of someone’s lips starting to smile, then suddenly disappearing, as they passed by me on the sidewalk, the smell of a normally pleasant flower stand being slightly off, or the barking of a dog coming from the mouth of a raven for just a single second. If I had missed any of these or the countless others, I don’t want to even think about where I’d be right now. Probably I’d be in the same place as all of them, the things that make these rules. Joining them in their games, but as a piece this time instead of a player.

My thoughts were stopped suddenly by the raking of metal against the bars. Another man, slightly shorter than the first two I encountered that night, also wearing a blue uniform, was seemingly trying to get my attention. His mouth moved, and his eyes fixed on me. His words, each seemed to make sense when put next to each other. However, his intentions were still lost on me. I sat there, straight-backed, and smiled, nodding my head slightly. It was the polite thing to do. I had done it growing up, whenever talking to someone and I didn’t quite catch what they were saying, I would simply smile and nod. However, I don’t think he took it as polite; his face furrowed, brow creasing, and his eyes became darker, to the point where the whites of his eyes were completely hidden from me.

He pulled a chain of keys attached by a cord from his belt and unclasped the heavy metal lock on the cell’s door, and slid the bars to the side. He motioned with his hand for me to walk with him. I stood, hands still locked behind my back, and followed his directions. I was led down a corridor with yellowish fluorescent lights lighting the way, the faint smell of piss hit my nose, a moment later it was replaced by the refreshing aroma of coffee. Just then the man stopped in front of an open door on the right that led into a small room with a table, two chairs on one side, one on the other. He looked at me, and again he spoke, it all seemed perfectly reasonable except I had no idea what he wanted. So I smiled, and nodded, and stood there. His frustrations seemed to return, face returning to that pinched expression, eyes black. He grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the single chair on the opposite side of the table. I understood and sat.

The man left, closing the door behind him. I sat and waited, for what, I wasn’t sure. But I enjoyed the peace of that lonely room, the feel of the brushed aluminum chair I sat in, that seemed to have been bolted to the ground. The flickering of those yellow lights above me, and the slight buzz of electricity that came with them. There was one thing in that room I didn’t like, however—a large mirror against the wall directly in front of me. It showed me more of the room, sure, but everything was wrong. Backwards. Everything was the same way they would see it.

""A world turned inside out, where everything you thought you knew is a lie, and every truth is a curse waiting to be broken.""

That’s what my father had told me about them. That’s all he told me about them, but I knew he knew more. He spent so much time talking to them, begging them, pleading with them. I knew he could have told me more about what was to come. About the pain I had to bring to the other players in order to win. But he kept it secret; sometimes I wonder whether that was because he didn’t want to burden me with knowing what had to come if I was going to win, or if it was because he didn’t want to lose.

It didn’t matter in the end. He did lose, and I had won. I tried to make it quick, out of the love I still had buried in my heart for my father. As quick as I could, at least, while still following the rules. It was strange, he didn’t react in the same way the others had, there was no screaming, no fighting. It just seemed like he was content with this turn of events. Like he had already accepted that he was just going to be another loser, and I was going to be the winner. He hardly even whimpered as I was tearing the skin away from his body, carefully, making sure not to damage any of the muscle underneath. I had tried to prop him against the wall so that his blood would drain quicker, leaving him less time to suffer. But he did still suffer. I had wished the rules were different for him, but there’s no sense in trying to escape what had to be done to win.

The door opened, two men walked in, both wearing long brown coats that were damp from the rain outside. One of the men had red hair, and he was carrying a styrofoam cup that steamed and brought with it that relaxing smell of coffee. The other, black-haired, carried no cup that had no pleasant smell to accompany it. However, he did have a brown folder tucked under one arm. They made their way to the seats across from me, the red-haired man sitting first while the black-haired one stared at me for a moment. I stared back and smiled. The smile was not reciprocated, just the quick pinching of his face before he returned to his expressionless facade. He sat next to the red-haired man and began moving his lips, uttering words and making gestures with his hands. I kept my smile and nodded slowly. His mouth stopped moving, the words stopped, and he quickly glanced at the red-haired man and then back to me. The red-haired man raised his styrofoam cup to his lips and breathed in the steam, I caught a whiff of the sour scent of mold; however, he did not seem to mind. He took a sip and set the cup on the table. There I could see it was filled with dark liquid with a brown film swirling around the surface. I stared at it for a moment, watching the film slowly spiral in the cup, watching as it slowed down until it finally stopped rotating. I continued to watch as it started circling again, however, in the other direction this time.

The red-haired man interrupted my thoughts with his words. His words were soft-spoken, yet they seemed to carry tremendous meaning to him. I could see it in his face, his eyes shone bright, and his jaw was clenched slightly. I tried to convey understanding to the plight I assumed he was having by softening my features, and tilting my head slightly as I nodded. I let the smile fall from my lips and rest flat against my face. The red-haired man stopped talking and just looked at me. His eyes burned into my own. I stared back, intently enough that I could make out my own reflection in the blacks of his eyes. I caught it for a second before it just disappeared. I blinked and refocused on the red-haired man, but that look was gone. He sat straight and cleared his expression.

The black-haired man pushed his brown folder forward on the table and opened it so I could see the contents. It was filled with pictures, mostly of people, some of objects. Of the pictures of the people, they were all ones I had once known, and of the objects, I recognized them all. So in understanding, I looked at the black-haired man, smiled, and nodded. The black-haired man’s mouth started moving again, I could see the muscles around his eyes straining, he looked tired. I gestured with my head, nodding it towards the red-haired man’s coffee while keeping my eyes locked with the black-haired man. He did not seem to want the coffee.

Instead of taking the cup and sipping from it, he pointed to one of the pictures. It was of a woman, brown hair, blue eyes, 27 years old. Her name was Lisa, and her birthday was July 17th, 1997. Her arms were not attached to her body in this picture, they were laying above her head, overlapping each other, forming the general shape of a cross. There was rope around her neck, waist, and legs that was tied to keep her down, and the large kitchen knife that I had used to saw her arms off was laying unceremoniously next to her. There was no rule about what to do with the knife when I was finished, so I had just left it with her in her apartment after the party. This very well might be one of the last pictures taken of my sister; it was important to me.

I looked back to the black-haired man and nodded. He stared for a moment, then moved his finger to another picture, this one of a man. 28 years old, brown hair, once brown eyes, born on October 21st, 1996, died on March 15th, 2025. His favorite thing to do in his free time was go fishing with his friends. In the picture, his abdomen was cut open, and his entrails were set to the side. His eyes were missing, from the photo, however, I still had them. For this part of the game, I was required to gut my best friend properly while blindfolded, and so I was rewarded with his eyes as I completed the challenge. I smiled remembering all the fun me and Chris used to have.

The black-haired man continued pointing at pictures of my friends and family, and I continued to reminisce, smiling and even laughing at some of the funnier memories I had shared with these people. If only they could see me now. A winner. I'm sure they'd be proud and we'd all go out and celebrate. The black-haired man pointed at the last photo, an older man with grey hair. He had crow’s feet at the sides of his eyes and a big bushy mustache that normally covered half of his smiling mouth. There was no smile in the photo. The man was stripped naked, of both clothes, as well as skin from the neck down. Slouched against the wall. His skin draped over the couch on the right of him like a throw blanket. My father, the man who had started this game, the man who had selfishly dragged me into it. And the man who had selflessly worked two jobs for years to be able to provide for me and my sister after our mother passed away. He was a man with flaws, sure, but he was a good man until the very end.

I smiled and leaned back as far as I could in my chair with my hands still cuffed behind my back. I had won, the game was over, and I could finally live my life in peace. I was thrilled by the thought, and I couldn’t help but laugh. The black-haired man started speaking, and I smiled and nodded vigorously, fully accepting the high that came with being done with the game. I looked back at the red-haired man. He looked to me and a smile played across his lips, then suddenly it disappeared.

After reading resources, I feel even more clueless so please speak to me in basic terms.

Overall Config:

Talk-show like format where I am the host at my desk, with a co-host next to me in a chair, and we are facing the guests (anywhere from 1-5) on two couches facing each other with a coffee table in the middle.

Equipment:

1) Mics - With my setup, I'm thinking of using wireless mics since guests are sitting on couches. The other option would be a mic for guests to pass around. Or is there a mic to put in the middle of the coffee table that would capture all audio. Also, would USB or XLR apply if my mics are wireless?

2) Audio Mixer - This is where I'm a bit clueless. Is this needed to bring all the audios from each mic in? Do mixers work with wireless mics?

3) Cameras - At a minimum 3-4 (wide angle, host, guests). Are these special cameras different than DSLR cameras? Do these record for 1 hour long?

4) Video Mixer - Also clueless here. Do I need something like this to feed all the videos from the 3-4 cameras into my computer? Is that what a capture card does?

5) Software - Is the software what brings all the audios and videos together to edit? For example, say Host A asks a question and Guest A answers followed by Guest B. How difficult is it to edit so the video (camera pointing at speaker) and audio (mic that speaker is wearing) sync up so final result is seamless video/audio that follows whichever speaker is speaking?

He was a man with flaws, sure, but he was a good man until the very end.

I smiled and leaned back as far as I could in my chair with my hands still cuffed behind my back. I had won, the game was over, and I could finally live my life in peace. I was thrilled by the thought, and I couldn’t help but laugh. The black-haired man started speaking, and I smiled and nodded vigorously, fully accepting the high that came with being done with the game. I looked back at the red-haired man. He looked to me and a smile played across his lips, then suddenly it disappeared.

My (22M) dad (40M) was so drunk when I got home from work (we unfortunately live together) that he couldn’t even stand up straight. It was 2:15am and he had work in the morning. At first everything was fine, we joked around a little bit, but then I saw a vape on the coffee table. (I’m trying to quit nicotine, and I don’t want to buy one because then I won’t stop hitting it) and I asked if I could hit it. He then proceeds to blow up on me, call me a “fucking thief” and asks me why I’m always taking his shit. I said “woah dude. I didn’t steal anything” he said I was bullshitting, and that I had a few in my room that I stole. So I told him to check my room. He walks in, points at my old phone and goes “right there” and I’m like “what? My phone?” He then gets even more angry, takes the vape I had in my hand, (it had 0% nicotine, I’m trying to kill the need to hit it) and throws it across my room. Calls me a lying mother fucker, and that I know what I’ve done.  Now yes, I have occasionally HIT his vape a few times, and then felt bad so I bought him two brand new ones. But I’ve never stolen one. ",6,1740991131.0,AlAnon,4,1.0,False

I’ve done some crazy things in life - both good & bad. But off late, I’m feeling the need to be myself and not think too much. Looking for a friend who wouldn’t judge me for my past. I’ve no intentions of whatsoever, just looking to go with the flow. I’m not ready to sign up for anything serious or confront about my past mistakes/actions. Just looking for light conversations and see where it takes us.

Looking for someone who wants to be their original self and not change anything. I’ll reciprocate being a good friend and not add more to your list of problems. We could grab a coffee or a drink and see if we have something in common. I’m well travelled, decently educated and sustainably successful. Physically I’m 6ft2,  100kgs.

So, I recently had a moment of paranoia (maybe too much coffee ☕ + cybersecurity horror stories = bad mix). As an agency handling sensitive client data, I started wondering… **how do other agencies actually secure their operations when working with remote contractors who use their own personal laptops?**

Like, let’s be real—most of us don’t have the budget of a Fortune 500 company to enforce top-tier security, but at the same time, we need our clients to fully trust that their data is safe. And let’s be honest, telling them, **""Yeah, I hope my freelancer in Africa doesn’t accidentally leak your info""** isn’t exactly confidence-boosting. 😂

So, my questions are:

1. **What security measures do you put in place for remote contractors , based on your service you provide ?** Do you use VPNs, endpoint security software, or some fancy compliance system?
2. **How do you get clients to trust your security setup?** Do you have any certifications/badges that prove you're compliant (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.)? If so, how did you get them?
3. **What’s the biggest security mistake you've made (or seen happen) that made you go, ""Welp, never doing that again""?** 😬
4. **Any horror stories with contractors?** Maybe they ghosted, went rogue, or just did something that made you question your life choices?

1j2e7v7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1j2e7v7/hr_the_game/,[HR] the game,"this is the first story ive written and id like to hear criticisms ------ I was sitting on the couch, TV on, beer in hand, and a smile gracing my lips. I had done it. I had finally finished the game started by my father. And now that I was done, I was free. There wasn’t going to be any more doubt in my mind about my next immediate action, whether or not this would be the wrong choice, whether it would be my last. I had won.

I glanced down at myself—khaki pants, brown loafers, and a blood-stained button-up blue striped shirt. For a second, my smile faded, reminding myself what I had to do in order to be free. But it wasn’t long before that smile returned, because that was it. I was free. And that is all that matters right now. It didn’t matter that there were red and blue lights flashing from the other side of my dusty brown curtains that covered a mostly intact window, it didn’t matter that the only food in the fridge was weeks old and moldy, and it didn’t matter that the stains on the rug I had tried desperately to remove still showed through. All that matters is the simple fact that I can move on. That the echo of my father’s words no longer cursed me.

""Son, the game isn't just something you play. It's something that plays you. Something you live. And if you're going to win... it’s going to cost you.""

There was a loud banging on the door. And a voice, deep and bellowing. I wasn’t able to comprehend what they were saying, but it sounded important. Important, I thought about that for a second, when is something ever truly important? To all parties involved, to some, what may seem important to me is trivial. And it works the other way around too. Like a child asking his father if he could please get him some new toy. It may be important to the child, but to me, I don’t give a fuck about that little shit's toy. No, I suppose the banging on the door wasn’t important. And it wasn’t important when the door was smashed in and fell from its hinges to lay across my living room floor. It was hardly even important when the two huge men in blue uniforms charged into my home, pistols drawn, grabbing me and slamming me into the floor while pulling my arms behind my back.

Because I was free. That’s what is important. That’s the only thing that is and has ever been important—the prospect of being, totally and utterly, free.

There were lots of lights in the dark night as I was taken from my home—red, blue, and bright whites. Noises too, voices, too many voices too loud and from so many different places, and engines running. I was unceremoniously put into the back seat of a car. It wasn’t very comfortable, but that wasn’t important. My wrists were bent at awkward angles and the metal from the handcuffs chafed them slightly. But I didn’t mind. I had a lot of time to think that night as I sat behind the cold iron bars. And of course, my thoughts always brought me back to that game, that goddamned game.

I’m not sure if I could tell you exactly what the point of the game was, only that there were winners. And there were losers as well. And trust me when I say, you never wanted to be one of the losers. There were rules to this game, of course, as there are rules to most games, but the rules were never static. You had to watch for signs of the rules changing in the world around you, you had to listen and smell and look so carefully, so very carefully because if you missed a rule and you broke it—well, that was it. There’s no going back, you just lose. So I watched, and I listened, and I breathed in the air around me. Everywhere I went, sometimes I caught them in a flash—the quick flick of someone’s lips starting to smile, then suddenly disappearing, as they passed by me on the sidewalk, the smell of a normally pleasant flower stand being slightly off, or the barking of a dog coming from the mouth of a raven for just a single second. If I had missed any of these or the countless others, I don’t want to even think about where I’d be right now. Probably I’d be in the same place as all of them, the things that make these rules. Joining them in their games, but as a piece this time instead of a player.

My thoughts were stopped suddenly by the raking of metal against the bars. Another man, slightly shorter than the first two I encountered that night, also wearing a blue uniform, was seemingly trying to get my attention. His mouth moved, and his eyes fixed on me. His words, each seemed to make sense when put next to each other. However, his intentions were still lost on me. I sat there, straight-backed, and smiled, nodding my head slightly. It was the polite thing to do. I had done it growing up, whenever talking to someone and I didn’t quite catch what they were saying, I would simply smile and nod. However, I don’t think he took it as polite; his face furrowed, brow creasing, and his eyes became darker, to the point where the whites of his eyes were completely hidden from me.

He pulled a chain of keys attached by a cord from his belt and unclasped the heavy metal lock on the cell’s door, and slid the bars to the side. He motioned with his hand for me to walk with him. I stood, hands still locked behind my back, and followed his directions. I was led down a corridor with yellowish fluorescent lights lighting the way, the faint smell of piss hit my nose, a moment later it was replaced by the refreshing aroma of coffee. Just then the man stopped in front of an open door on the right that led into a small room with a table, two chairs on one side, one on the other. He looked at me, and again he spoke, it all seemed perfectly reasonable except I had no idea what he wanted. So I smiled, and nodded, and stood there. His frustrations seemed to return, face returning to that pinched expression, eyes black. He grabbed me by the arm and dragged me to the single chair on the opposite side of the table. I understood and sat.

The man left, closing the door behind him. I sat and waited, for what, I wasn’t sure. But I enjoyed the peace of that lonely room, the feel of the brushed aluminum chair I sat in, that seemed to have been bolted to the ground. The flickering of those yellow lights above me, and the slight buzz of electricity that came with them. There was one thing in that room I didn’t like, however—a large mirror against the wall directly in front of me. It showed me more of the room, sure, but everything was wrong. Backwards. Everything was the same way they would see it.

""A world turned inside out, where everything you thought you knew is a lie, and every truth is a curse waiting to be broken.""

That’s what my father had told me about them. That’s all he told me about them, but I knew he knew more. He spent so much time talking to them, begging them, pleading with them. I knew he could have told me more about what was to come. About the pain I had to bring to the other players in order to win. But he kept it secret; sometimes I wonder whether that was because he didn’t want to burden me with knowing what had to come if I was going to win, or if it was because he didn’t want to lose.

It didn’t matter in the end. He did lose, and I had won. I tried to make it quick, out of the love I still had buried in my heart for my father. As quick as I could, at least, while still following the rules. It was strange, he didn’t react in the same way the others had, there was no screaming, no fighting. It just seemed like he was content with this turn of events. Like he had already accepted that he was just going to be another loser, and I was going to be the winner. He hardly even whimpered as I was tearing the skin away from his body, carefully, making sure not to damage any of the muscle underneath. I had tried to prop him against the wall so that his blood would drain quicker, leaving him less time to suffer. But he did still suffer. I had wished the rules were different for him, but there’s no sense in trying to escape what had to be done to win.

The door opened, two men walked in, both wearing long brown coats that were damp from the rain outside. One of the men had red hair, and he was carrying a styrofoam cup that steamed and brought with it that relaxing smell of coffee. The other, black-haired, carried no cup that had no pleasant smell to accompany it. However, he did have a brown folder tucked under one arm. They made their way to the seats across from me, the red-haired man sitting first while the black-haired one stared at me for a moment. I stared back and smiled. The smile was not reciprocated, just the quick pinching of his face before he returned to his expressionless facade. He sat next to the red-haired man and began moving his lips, uttering words and making gestures with his hands. I kept my smile and nodded slowly. His mouth stopped moving, the words stopped, and he quickly glanced at the red-haired man and then back to me. The red-haired man raised his styrofoam cup to his lips and breathed in the steam, I caught a whiff of the sour scent of mold; however, he did not seem to mind. He took a sip and set the cup on the table. There I could see it was filled with dark liquid with a brown film swirling around the surface. I stared at it for a moment, watching the film slowly spiral in the cup, watching as it slowed down until it finally stopped rotating. I continued to watch as it started circling again, however, in the other direction this time.

The red-haired man interrupted my thoughts with his words. His words were soft-spoken, yet they seemed to carry tremendous meaning to him. I could see it in his face, his eyes shone bright, and his jaw was clenched slightly. I tried to convey understanding to the plight I assumed he was having by softening my features, and tilting my head slightly as I nodded. I let the smile fall from my lips and rest flat against my face. The red-haired man stopped talking and just looked at me. His eyes burned into my own. I stared back, intently enough that I could make out my own reflection in the blacks of his eyes. I caught it for a second before it just disappeared. I blinked and refocused on the red-haired man, but that look was gone. He sat straight and cleared his expression.

The black-haired man pushed his brown folder forward on the table and opened it so I could see the contents. It was filled with pictures, mostly of people, some of objects. Of the pictures of the people, they were all ones I had once known, and of the objects, I recognized them all. So in understanding, I looked at the black-haired man, smiled, and nodded. The black-haired man’s mouth started moving again, I could see the muscles around his eyes straining, he looked tired. I gestured with my head, nodding it towards the red-haired man’s coffee while keeping my eyes locked with the black-haired man. He did not seem to want the coffee.

Instead of taking the cup and sipping from it, he pointed to one of the pictures. It was of a woman, brown hair, blue eyes, 27 years old. Her name was Lisa, and her birthday was July 17th, 1997. Her arms were not attached to her body in this picture, they were laying above her head, overlapping each other, forming the general shape of a cross. There was rope around her neck, waist, and legs that was tied to keep her down, and the large kitchen knife that I had used to saw her arms off was laying unceremoniously next to her. There was no rule about what to do with the knife when I was finished, so I had just left it with her in her apartment after the party. This very well might be one of the last pictures taken of my sister; it was important to me.

I looked back to the black-haired man and nodded. He stared for a moment, then moved his finger to another picture, this one of a man. 28 years old, brown hair, once brown eyes, born on October 21st, 1996, died on March 15th, 2025. His favorite thing to do in his free time was go fishing with his friends. In the picture, his abdomen was cut open, and his entrails were set to the side. His eyes were missing, from the photo, however, I still had them. For this part of the game, I was required to gut my best friend properly while blindfolded, and so I was rewarded with his eyes as I completed the challenge. I smiled remembering all the fun me and Chris used to have.

The black-haired man continued pointing at pictures of my friends and family, and I continued to reminisce, smiling and even laughing at some of the funnier memories I had shared with these people. If only they could see me now. A winner. I'm sure they'd be proud and we'd all go out and celebrate. The black-haired man pointed at the last photo, an older man with grey hair. He had crow’s feet at the sides of his eyes and a big bushy mustache that normally covered half of his smiling mouth. There was no smile in the photo. The man was stripped naked, of both clothes, as well as skin from the neck down. Slouched against the wall. His skin draped over the couch on the right of him like a throw blanket. My father, the man who had started this game, the man who had selfishly dragged me into it. And the man who had selflessly worked two jobs for years to be able to provide for me and my sister after our mother passed away. He was a man with flaws, sure, but he was a good man until the very end.

I smiled and leaned back as far as I could in my chair with my hands still cuffed behind my back. I had won, the game was over, and I could finally live my life in peace. I was thrilled by the thought, and I couldn’t help but laugh. The black-haired man started speaking, and I smiled and nodded vigorously, fully accepting the high that came with being done with the game. I looked back at the red-haired man. He looked to me and a smile played across his lips, then suddenly it disappeared.

Yesterday we were gathered at my brother's place to meet with some friends.

We were all sitting at the table drinking coffee and eating some cake. People went to the bathroom etc. as usually happens during a few hours of chit-chat over coffee.

All of a sudden I had the feeling that someone was missing from the table that had been there from the beginning when we all got there, but everyone was present at the table. I looked around the table a few times. Everyone was there, yet it kept feeling like someone wasn't present. I couldn't tell who exaclty was missing either.

Weird feeling.

Then I had the thought: maybe it was my aunt. She had just passed away last week. We had talked about her at the table. Maybe she was present (in spirit), but then left, and that's why I got that feeling?

Her arms were not attached to her body in this picture, they were laying above her head, overlapping each other, forming the general shape of a cross. There was rope around her neck, waist, and legs that was tied to keep her down, and the large kitchen knife that I had used to saw her arms off was laying unceremoniously next to her. There was no rule about what to do with the knife when I was finished, so I had just left it with her in her apartment after the party. This very well might be one of the last pictures taken of my sister; it was important to me.

I looked back to the black-haired man and nodded. He stared for a moment, then moved his finger to another picture, this one of a man. 28 years old, brown hair, once brown eyes, born on October 21st, 1996, died on March 15th, 2025. His favorite thing to do in his free time was go fishing with his friends. In the picture, his abdomen was cut open, and his entrails were set to the side. His eyes were missing, from the photo, however, I still had them. For this part of the game, I was required to gut my best friend properly while blindfolded, and so I was rewarded with his eyes as I completed the challenge. I smiled remembering all the fun me and Chris used to have.

The black-haired man continued pointing at pictures of my friends and family, and I continued to reminisce, smiling and even laughing at some of the funnier memories I had shared with these people. If only they could see me now. A winner. I'm sure they'd be proud and we'd all go out and celebrate. The black-haired man pointed at the last photo, an older man with grey hair. He had crow’s feet at the sides of his eyes and a big bushy mustache that normally covered half of his smiling mouth. There was no smile in the photo. The man was stripped naked, of both clothes, as well as skin from the neck down. Slouched against the wall. His skin draped over the couch on the right of him like a throw blanket. My father, the man who had started this game, the man who had selfishly dragged me into it. And the man who had selflessly worked two jobs for years to be able to provide for me and my sister after our mother passed away. He was a man with flaws, sure, but he was a good man until the very end.

I smiled and leaned back as far as I could in my chair with my hands still cuffed behind my back. I had won, the game was over, and I could finally live my life in peace. I was thrilled by the thought, and I couldn’t help but laugh. The black-haired man started speaking, and I smiled and nodded vigorously, fully accepting the high that came with being done with the game. I looked back at the red-haired man. He looked to me and a smile played across his lips, then suddenly it disappeared.

1j2e3im,https://www.reddit.com/r/demisexuality/comments/1j2e3im/how_do_i_build_a_connection_with_a_demisexual/,How do I Build a Connection with a Demisexual Woman?,"Hello!

I've recently had a couple of brief meet-ups with a demisexual woman, and I'm hoping for some guidance because I really don’t want to fumble this. She’s tall, beautiful, highly intelligent, and I find her captivating. I’m trying not to get ahead of myself, but I can feel that I want to have feelings for her.

We initially matched on Hinge and met for coffee to get to know each other. I was nervous but did my best to keep my composure, and before I knew it, two hours had passed with barely a pause in the conversation. A week later, we unexpectedly bumped into each other at a singles speed dating night. We picked each other and ended up as one of four couples matched at the end of the event.

The trouble is, I find her quite aloof. She ignores my messages for days at a time, but when she does reply, she sends long, thoughtful responses. I can’t get a read on her.

At first, I didn’t know much about demisexuality, so I rushed things—going straight from a coffee meet-up to suggesting a dinner date as a couple. She gently steered it in a different direction, suggesting a group dinner with another couple or two instead. Looking back, I realize I misread the situation.

I also noticed that her social media has no photos or posts with prior partners, which makes me wonder if she’s ever had a long-term relationship before. For reference, we are both in our thirties.

Since then, I’ve done some reading on demisexuality, and I really want to do right by her. She’s a wonderful woman, and I’m willing to be patient if I can build a meaningful bond with her. I just don’t know the best way to go about it.

I was thinking about suggesting we go on regular day hikes together—something that would let us enjoy nature, stay active, and create an environment for deeper, more meaningful conversation.

Feels like 2 years,"It’s 2 weeks since DD and WH telling me he had an AP for the last 6 mths.   It took 3 days to get all the information from him.   First it was just coffees. Then it was a dinner too. Finally he told me they’d been intimate a number of times 
We’ve been married for over 30 years.   I had a drunken ONS very early on in our relationship and we were not in a good place as a couple, but we worked through that.  We’ve been through a lot of trauma in other parts of our lives over 30 years and we’ve always been there for each other. 

But this is different. He thought about this, did it willingly and knowingly, no alcohol or drugs to blur the lines.    

He’s just left for a hotel as we need some time apart to think this through.  At first I thought I wanted to reconcile, now I don’t know how I feel.    I’m mad he left and isn’t fighting for us, but I also understand he’s very conflicted on why he’s done this, and if he can’t work that out, there’s no chance for us going forward. 

I just feel so lost, and needed to say it to someone…. My head is everywhere.  ",7,1740990422.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,5,1.0,False

1j2dxb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1j2dxb8/aitah_for_standing_up_to_my_boyfriends_racist/,AITAH for standing up to my boyfriend’s racist sister after she called me a dirty white devil?,"I (17 f) and my boyfriend (20 m) have been together for almost a year now and ever since him and I have gotten together his whole family has had a problem with me being white, my boyfriends family is Afghani and usually go by strict rules about their Muslim religion more specifically Shia Muslim. At the beginning him and I were planning to keep our relationship a secret for a few years but his parents went through his phone and found out about us and wanted to meet me, when I met his parents they made us get “engaged” to be married right away and planned a formal engagement ceremony for when I turn 18. After that they welcomed me into their home and asked for me to come and stay for the weekends at his place and were completely fine with it up until his oldest sister (28 f) started feeding his mother and father false information about how he’s going to jail for being with me since I’m under 18, but in my country legal age of consent with any age is 16. When we cleared that up with his parents his sister ended up running away because she couldn’t feed her parents lies anymore and she wanted to live the life of a woman that use’s and sleeps with men for money. 

After that incident I was at his house on one really hot day and he asked if I could walk to the store and grab some things, so I put on a modest pair of shorts that barely went above my knees as well as a baggy T-shirt and walked outside. While I was outside I saw his older but younger sister (26 f) getting out of her car to come visit their parents after dropping her husband off at his family’s house. As soon as I saw her I politely smiled, said hello and asked if she would like anything from the store, she gave me a shocked dirty look and said no. I accidentally forgot my wallet in the house and as I went to grab it his sister started screaming at me telling me that I’m a dirty whore for wearing such provocative things out in public and how her brother should be disgusted with me for obviously seeking attention from other men, before this I asked my boyfriend if what I was wearing was okay and he said yes. As she was yelling at me I kept apologizing over and over again saying that I would change and that I didn’t mean to offend her in any way but she kept throwing insults at me. Their parents got involved after a few minutes telling her that what I was wearing was appropriate and for her to stop, as she was busy with her parents and my boyfriend I went to go change but she chased after me saying that her brother didn’t need to be with a dirty whore like me and then left the house. 
A week later I sent her a message that read this. “Hello (insert name) its (insert name) I just wanted to send you a message because I really thought we got off on the wrong foot and I don’t want to leave everything like that. I am sorry if I offended you and your family by what I was wearing and I’m not going to make any excuses for myself because now I understand that I shouldn’t wear things like that in front of your family and especially in front of your brother, it was very inappropriate of me to do that and for it I apologize. But I don’t want us to be on edgy terms with each other and I’d really like to get to know you and for you to get to know me, so if you ever just wanted to sit down and talk with me I’d be super happy to do that with you and you and I can go grab a coffee and have a one on one chat and just have a girls day with each other. I know you are super busy with work but I’d really like for you to get to know what kind of person I am, but until then I hope you have a wonderful week!” She replied to me saying “Hey (insert name) Thanks for your message, I also apologize, perhaps I may have overreacted. Let’s do that someday! Until then, take it easy and work hard in school!”

After this I’ve seen her multiple times at their parents house and I have always been nothing but kind and respectful to her and her family and thought that we were getting on good terms. But today my boyfriend received this message “ Can you please save our family’s reputation and leave (my name)? You’re going to destroy our family’s name. If you continue to be with her I will never speak to you again.” “(My boyfriend) why can’t you just be happy for me? She has done nothing to you all but be generous and kind.” “(Sister) she is useless, she doesn’t help mom at home, doesn’t clean or cook, and sits around all day like a bum. Not even studying in school, will not even be able to afford a life. She’s just a problem, and especially your going to make mom and dad so ashamed they’re not even going to be able to show their faces out in public because you are with that dirty white girl.” “(My boyfriend) You don’t even know what she does during the week. She’s top of her class, she takes care of her sick grandmother, and on top of that she cooks, cleans, and does almost everything. She’s even taking a course to learn our language and culture to convert” “(sister) If you are that selfish I am disgusted with you. Tell her to stop coming over until she gets her life together, gets a job and is your wife. You should be ashamed of yourself.” “(My boyfriend) She’s comfortable enough to come here and relax with us from all the hard work she does at home. You are the selfish one for looking down on her when you have made no effort in getting to know who she is or what she does.” “(Sister) you cannot even call yourself a Muslim. You are sleeping in the same room and hugging each other I am disgusted to even call yourself my brother. Shame on you, you should be ashamed of yourself for even having the blessed name of Mohammad you don’t even deserve it.” “(My boyfriend) She loves me and I love her and I have never found that with any of the girls mom and dad forced me to talk to, all they care about is money. (My name) is kind and has always been there for me when none of you were so no I am not ashamed to love the most amazing and resilient woman I have ever had the pleasure to come across.” “(Sister) she is disgusting. Look at her dirty white devil skin, I am disgusted every time I see that slut little white girl. She isn’t worthy enough to even breathe our air” “(my boyfriend) how dare you speak of my future wife that way. She has been nothing but kind to you when she had every reason not to. She has done everything we have asked of her and is an angel from our god.” “(Sister) she was not born Muslim so therefore she is a dirty white devil. She is scum on the earth for even existing.” “(My boyfriend) how is she scum in her own country. How dare you have the audacity to even speak of her this way, after this you are no longer part of my life. Goodbye.” 

Here is where I might be the AH. After my boyfriend showed me this conversation I took it upon myself to send her a message personally and this is what I said. “I get that you don’t like me and think I’m a disgrace to your family but I love your brother whether you can see that or you can’t , just because I am white does not define who I am as a person. I could be black, asian, Mexican, Indian, or Afghani, and I would still be the same person I built myself up to be today. All I wanted was a sister in law that I could go out for coffee with or go shopping with and now we cannot have that because all you see is my white skin. I respected you as his sister but now I cannot respect you as a person at all because it is completely racist to hate someone based off of their skin colour. I have been nothing but kind to you and your family and I have respected your rules. You are the most disgraceful and racist human being I have ever come across and as of now you are below nothing to me and (boyfriend’s name). You want to talk about human scum take a look in the mirror and then go shove it.”
