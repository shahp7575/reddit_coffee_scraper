To summarise what happened I recently received detention for breaking the school rules by stepping outside the school boundaries while buying coffee when I had been doing it for 5 years. I was heading back through the gates in the park and walked to school, where the deputy principal saw me and stopped me, asking for my name and giving me detention for stepping outside.

I was confused since I never had detentions and I always went out to get my coffee on regular basis on break and lunch time by going through the gates that leads to the park and to the nearest convenience store where I buy my coffee and some snacks along with it. I seen other students doing the same thing in buying chicken rolls. I wasn't told or informed about the rule that states students can't go outside the school boundaries for break and lunch as I had been doing it since 5 years, whether if they had recently set it up and decided not to announce it. I always feel worned out during classes, so I always have coffee during my classes and none of my classmates nor my teachers questioned me, except when my friends point fun at me for it.

I was frustrated and annoyed when I was told that I'll be receiving detention that I asked her if I could talk to her and discuss in her room to resolve it. But she was dismissive towards me and my regualr basis when I brought it up during our discussion. She kept reminding me about the school code and that every student needs to follow the rules and stay within the school boundaries, while dismissing the fact that I had been doing it since 5 years and I had no intention to skip classes or leave the premises and I always come back for my classes with my cup of coffee.

I was frustrated at this point and called her out for giving me detention for something so minor and argued that the school has such a obscure rule for not allowing students to buy their lunch that the deputy principal decided to extend my detention.

Now I am forced to stay longer in school by staying in a classroom with troublemakers to clean the desks and chairs, while rewriting the school rules on the board with a marker as there is a teacher occupying the room.

Could I do something about this? I already talked to my parents about the detention and they said they will talk to the principal, but I don't know if it'll help me at all after the discussion I had with the deputy principal. Now I'm feeling stressed and upset over it.",1,1740492544.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

here’s what worked for me: 

1. being comfortable with not knowing things throughout ur studying. being comfortable with getting things wrong on practice exams. taking time to dive deep into reviewing why you’re getting things wrong, discussing those things with someone if possible (a study rep, an advisor, someone in the field, etc.) i think i learned most from looking at my errors fr
2. get out the house. idk how many of you are trying to do this from home, but if you have access to get out of the house to study, do it. study at every coffee shop that you can, go to the library, literally anything to get you out of the comfort of your own home. home is for relaxing lets not stress in there. 
3. create ur own memory tools, maximize your dump sheet fr. if you can create a solid options box, exam will be cake. not gonna lie i even encourage chatgpt to help with memorize things, you can ask it to help you come up with acronyms you’ll remember, or come up with phrases or symbols to memorize things quickly. definitely helped me
4. this is one is probably the toughest but don’t do this alone! lean on your people that know these things and if you don’t have anyone, make an effort to find someone fr. studying for all of this alone sucks, find someone who can keep you accountable

if ur reading this and struggling, don’t feel discouraged, don’t be nervous don’t be scared, face the challenge and put the work in give it your 100%. im still sick that i didn’t give it 100% the first time because looking back i really didn’t do what i was supposed to do, and it set me back like a month. second time around proved that if you’re committed to it and make the proper sacrifices, the results will prove everything. day 1 of looking back and feeling like it was nothing for real, hang in there and one day you’ll look back and not even remember any of this stress  ",1,1740492464.0,Series7exam,0,1.0,False

1ixvraf,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ixvraf/could_the_simpure_y7pbw_countertop_water_filter/,Could the SimPure Y7P-BW Countertop Water Filter Be Your Ideal Purifier? A Detailed Review,"Testing out the SimPure Y7P-BW UV Countertop Reverse Osmosis Water Filter has been a fascinating experience in my household. With its sleek black-and-white design and compact size, it fits seamlessly into my kitchen, which is already short on counter space. Using it daily, I’ve come to appreciate its many features, but I’ve also noticed a few areas where it falls short. Here’s everything you need to know to decide if this countertop water purifier is right for you.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

Setting up the system is as easy as it gets. Unlike traditional under-sink filtration systems, this one doesn’t require drilling holes or connecting to a water line. You simply unbox it, plug it in, and you’re ready to go. The included manual is straightforward, and I had the unit running within minutes. My teenage son even joked that it was easier to set up than his gaming console.

Its user-friendly interface includes buttons for pre-set water quantities—6 oz, 12 oz, and 15 oz—which are perfect for day-to-day hydration needs. There’s also a continuous flow option that I use when filling my coffee pot or a larger pitcher. While this feature is handy, I did find myself wishing there were an option for chilled or heated water, as the unit only dispenses room-temperature water.

[Find the best price for SimPure Y7P-BW on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0bhzsjhwg/)

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

What makes this water filter stand out is its advanced filtration system. With a 5-stage reverse osmosis process and UV purification, it eliminates up to 99.99% of contaminants, including bacteria, viruses, heavy metals, and chemicals like PFAS. I tested the water with a TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) meter before and after filtration. My tap water started at a whopping 220 ppm and dropped to a mere 7 ppm after passing through the SimPure Y7P-BW.

The UV light adds an extra layer of security, which I find reassuring. However, some reviewers have mentioned that the UV light’s placement at the bottom of the tank might not be as effective as it could be, as the clean water line doesn’t directly pass through it. While I haven’t encountered any issues, it’s something to keep in mind.

**Capacity & Suitability**

The back tank holds 1.3 gallons of water, which works well for my family of four. We can go through a full tank in a day without needing frequent refills. If you’re a larger household or use purified water for cooking, you might find yourself refilling the tank more often. The system is ideal for apartments, offices, or even RVs, thanks to its portability and lack of installation requirements.

**Flow Rate & Performance**

Waiting for water isn’t an issue with this device. Its flow rate of 0.29 gallons per minute means you can fill a standard glass in about 15 seconds. Compared to older countertop systems I’ve tried, this is a significant upgrade. That said, the unit does make a bit of noise during operation. While it’s not loud enough to be disruptive, it’s worth noting if you’re sensitive to background noise.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

The SimPure Y7P-BW uses a composite filter (CF) and a reverse osmosis (RO) filter, both of which are rated for up to 528 gallons or approximately six months of use. Replacing them is straightforward; you simply twist out the old filter and twist in the new one. However, if you’re a heavy user like me, you might find yourself replacing them more frequently, which can add to the overall cost of ownership.

**Certifications**

I always check for certifications when purchasing water filtration systems, and this one doesn’t disappoint. It’s tested against NSF/ANSI 58 standards and complies with EPA guidelines. Knowing it meets these rigorous standards gives me confidence in its ability to deliver safe, clean water.

**Warranty**

The SimPure Y7P-BW comes with a one-year warranty, which is fairly standard for products in this category. I haven’t had to use it yet, but reviews suggest that the company’s customer service is responsive and helpful.

**Strengths**

* High-efficiency filtration with 4:1 pure-to-drain water ratio.
* Simple plug-and-play setup, no plumbing required.
* UV purification for added safety.

**Drawbacks**

* Only dispenses room-temperature water, which might not suit everyone.
* The UV light placement may not be optimized for maximum effectiveness.
* Slightly noisy during operation.

**Competing Products**

Comparing this model to others, like the APEC Water Countertop RO System or the AquaTru Countertop Purifier, reveals some interesting differences. The SimPure stands out for its high water efficiency and compact design. However, the AquaTru offers temperature options and a quieter operation, albeit at a higher price point. The APEC system, while reliable, lacks the UV purification feature, making the SimPure a better choice for those prioritizing maximum filtration.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

The upfront cost and filter replacement prices might seem steep, but when I calculated the savings from no longer buying bottled water, the investment quickly justified itself. Plus, the environmental benefit of reducing plastic waste is a huge bonus.

It seems like it is working fine. Temps are fine.

Periodically however - like as I've been sitting here drinking my coffee and cruising reddit, it's happen twice in the last hour - the outdoor unit makes a buzzing sound so loud we can hear it inside the house.

It last maybe 5 seconds.

It sounds like someone drilling a hole in a metal piece of ductwork with a hole saw. I make that comparison because during install they drilled a hole in one of our ducts for a component and it sounded exactly the same.

It doesn't seem to coincide with the unit turning on or off. It just happens at random times.

Is this a normal thing?

They are actually coming by today to install a different air filter, so I'll bring it up with them, but I figured I'd ask in advance.

1ixvkag,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1ixvkag/help_please/,Help please,"Hi All , I’ve just had my first ever cholesterol check back in January and my results were as follows. And I’m not quite sure I understand them completely I understand they’re high and I need to change some things etc. but any more information would be great. 

History/About me. I’m 34 186 cm and at time of testing 182 ibs but have since lost weight due to diet changes and weigh 162 ibs. 

My diet before testing wasn’t great I’ve always kinda just ate what I wanted and never really worried as I didn’t tend to rapidly put on weight . I did drink a lot of beer too like maybe 3 beers a night consistently for like 2 years. (I know it’s bad) my liver enzymes were slightly elevated due to this. 

I wasn’t exactly active other than walking the dog few miles on the weekend and manual job. 

I tested on the 4th of January just after Christmas where I was indulging a lot and drinking a lot , I never really drank coffee mostly monster energy and did have a can before testing on the drive there. 

Since the results it scared me quite a bit and in contradiction to how I was living my life I am health conscious and want to be around for a little while. 

Since then I’ve not touched a beer , I’ve changed my diet and on the advice on this page. 

Morning : protein shake with oat milk and oats inside shake with a scoop of physillium husk and a banana on its own. 

Lunch I skip lunch but if I do have lunch normally a meal deal and try to go for the lowest sat fat option normally around 3 grams. 

The dinner I cook at home using gusto options but leave the cheese etc from the recipes. 

I drink around 3 litres of water a day or sparkling water with a drop of sugar free cordial for flavour. 

Am I on the right track to retest or do I need to adjust my diet further before working out if it’s genetic or diet based. 

Also I vape if that has any impact. 

Cholesterol - 7.8 mmol/L 
HDL - 1.17 mmol/L 
LDL -4.8 mmol/L
Triglycerides- 3.94 mmol/L

1ixvka4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badbreath/comments/1ixvka4/start_dieting_part_16/,Start dieting part 16,"It's been a little longer since my last post. I feel like consistently taking longer to write a new post every month. Frankly, the reason for that is because i'm not feeling the urgency towards it anymore. Bad breath's become  smaller blimp on my radar and my life seems to be moving forward. I got a nice job offer, I'm finishing my master's degree, I moved to a new apartment etc.

Anyways, Today I am completing 7 weeks since I returned to the diet. For the new people, its the second (or third) time i'm attempting the diet. The second time was last autumn semester. I did it for a total of 8 weeks and had amazing progress. However, it wasn't 100% yet. When I stopped dieting, I went on a trip and returned to  normal diet. When I returned to a normal diet, my breath went completely away, and the reason for that is because sugar eating bacteria completely took over the mouth. Which gives caries and plaque, but its much more preferable than bad breath frankly.

What I've learned recently is that there are different kinds of bad breath fueled by different compounds. In the oral microbiome there are sulphur bacteria, nitrogen bacteria and ammonia bacteria. As well as sugar eating bacteria and healthy fiber eating bacteria, but these dont produce bad breath.

The worst of them all and the one i struggled most with was sulphur eating bacteria. It produces a strong foul smell, similar to rotten eggs or rotten cabbage. This kind of bacteria is the most resilient, it thrives and a wide range of ph, it feeds on most foods, and it adapts to a wide variety of scenarios. An easy way to find out if you have this kind of bacteria, is to lick your wrist. If the saliva feels warm, its likely sulphur bacteria that took over. Healthy saliva should be neutral or even cool in temperature.

The second kind of bad breath bacteria is the nitrogen eating bacteria. This is your poop smell. It alone is not as strong as sulphur bacteria. This kind of bacteria struggles to create its own biofilm, therefore, a simple sugar cutting diet is enough to weaken it a lot. It alone, doesnt produce far reaching smell, its usually combined with sulphur VSC's that it causes the room filling breath. This kind of bacteria is also weak to ph changes when exposed outside of biofilms

The third type is the newest for me. Ammonia eating bacteria. Ammonia is usually not associated with bad breath. Generally, it thrives in very high ph and causes gum infections and bleeding. However, ammonia bacteria can cause bad breath and it has a very particular smell. It's not as offensive as sulphur or poop smells, however, its far reaching.

In the past two or three weeks, I completely switched my protein intake from salmon to vegan protein powder from peas. It was a game changer. The salmon was fueling the sulphur bacteria and it was taking a while for good bacteria to gain dominance. When I switched proteins, my body went completely sulphur limited and other types of bacteria, being good, ammonia and nitrogen, started competing for space. At first, the poop smelling bacteria took over. Then during the day good bacteria would take over by flushing with saliva and drinking water.

However, in the past week, I was moving apartments and exercising a lot. What happened is that my protein intake was too low. I was taking about half the protein mount I should be taking a day. That together with heavy exercise, caused my body to start breaking down its own muscles to fuel the body. It led to a sharp increase in ammonia bacteria.

At the current moment, completing 3 weeks. I am dealing with a fight for dominance between good, nitrogen and ammonia bacteria. My oral microbiome is incredibly volatile and subject to external change. Its very difficult to find a balance. I wake up in the morning with poop breath. Brush my teeth, it goes away for a while. Then ammonia bacteria take over during the day. I drink coffee to lower mouth ph, the ammonia bacteria goes away but I get coffee breath. I brush my teeth and it goes back to no smell etc.

What I am doing is increasing my intake of protein to 40g a day, which is the amount it should be for my weight. I am also introducing a plethora of healthy bacteria supportive things. Like different kinds of prebiotics, chicorry root, acacia fiber etc. I am including different kinds of polyphenols like 100% cocoa, cranberry extract, pomegranate extract. I am including beetroot powder for nitrogen reduction and etc. We'll see how it goes, I'll write an update next month.",1,1740491798.0,badbreath,0,1.0,False

Low weight, previously active and no other health issues.        I've been off of narcotics now for 24 hours.    Zero regrets staying on them longer than ""maybe "" I neeeded to ?   If nothing else they were great to fall asleep (who knew yon could sleep so much better orb so little activity ). 

Also ..   it's not mentioned a lot.   Last night I had my first BM.  I did all the things ..    I definitely wasn't eating as much as normal to begin with, but drank lots of water, juice, fruited and veggies with lean protein.   Did the stool softener 2/day along with ducolax laxative chews and magnesium citrate.     I have a fear of stomach cramps with laxatives that are too strong ...   the hold your belly, weird sweaty fever cramps. I don't event know when that happened to me but still.    I did a recorder of a product I've used called Innocleanse.  It's worked for me in the past along with a cup of coffee to help things along (with no cramping ).   It may have been what I needed (along with being off the narcotics ) to finally have a BM last night and some magic time this morning.  

I did have a discussion this morning with my husband on timing for my 2nd hip.   I only found out in Nov that I was born with hip dysplasia and while my left hip was worse ..  my right hip X-rays also not great.    Before I was as thinking in the fall or ever same time next year.   But considering I'm doing ok after not even a week ..   I'm thinking sooner so I can double up on the slow and steady rehab.     Ir.  Why recovery for the 12 months only to restart another 12 months.      I'll discuss with my surgeon next week at my follow up ..    and the idea of walks outside as it gets nicer seems better than the  laps in our house.  

Recap - 1) my age and health definitely gave me a different recovery than a lot of people.     I know this and I'm sorry for those of you who are struggling.   

2) I love the Game Ready ice and compression machine.   I also love my husband who was/is awesome about refilling it even at 3 am 

3). Stay ahead of the pain.  None of this is a contest on who is on or off them sooner (I mean .. outside of gettiing hooked on them ).   

4) Your body has gone through something traumatic.    And amazing.  I keep reminding myself of this 

5) there are good days and not good days.  Healing isn't linear.  2 steps forward, one step back is still progress 

6) outside of the game ready ..  I needed my handled toilet set contraption (which I also use to sit on in the shower).   The long band to assist with my leg (although my hubs as helped just fine).   An elevated pillow for my legs.   And a grabber.  I haven't used it a ton ..  but just enough that it was worth it.   Also..  for the Game Ready and my ankle compressors they make a lot of noise.  So having noise cancelling headphones has helped sleep.  Also an electric blanket to throw on and off without messing with covers.      

Good luck to everyone!     I'll maybe share an update after my surgical follow up and first PT next week !

We all know the echo chamber effect is real, and as passionate as we get in this subreddit, we’re still mostly talking among ourselves. With the next election looming, it’s more important than ever to break out of these online bubbles. Sure, r/Ontario is a great place for solid discussions, but if we truly want change, we can’t stay here: we need to reach people who aren’t reading this thread.

1. Don’t Just Post—Persuade.
• Reddit is awesome for sharing ideas, but your co-workers, cousins, or friends on Facebook and Instagram might not be tuned in. Strike up conversations where they hang out—even if it’s face-to-face over coffee. One real discussion often changes minds more than a hundred comment threads.

2. Combat Misinformation Everywhere.
• Misinformation spreads fast—so let’s push back just as hard. If people on TikTok, Twitter, and Facebook are posting political nonsense, counter it with real facts. Make sure people know the reality: Doug Ford is a fan of Trump-style politics, from gutting public services to dodging accountability. He’s been cozy with right-wing influencers and their playbook, make sure people see the receipts.
	
3. Turn Rants Into Votes.
• Let’s be blunt: Ranting online won’t change anything if people don’t actually vote. We all have that friend or relative who’s frustrated with politics but doesn’t make it to the polls. Give them a nudge—or a ride—so they can have their say. Every vote truly matters.
	

4. Use All Your Platforms.
• Reddit is just one corner of the internet. Post on Facebook if you still have it, toss some facts on your Instagram stories, or make a quick TikTok if you’re feeling creative. It might feel small, but the ripple effect can be huge. We can’t underestimate the power of cross-platform sharing.

We’ve seen it happen before: big online energy fizzles out if it doesn’t translate into offline action. So let’s not settle for just another Reddit thread. Spread the word, connect with people in different circles, and above all, get out there and vote.

Ontario’s future isn’t decided by one platform or one community—it’s shaped by all of us, everywhere, raising our voices and taking real steps toward change.

Am I overreacting?,"Some context: There is a guy at my work who from day one I was not a fan of. He’s made more than one sexist comment in my presence and he has also made tactless and insensitive comments about America which aren’t in good faith but he is trying to be edgy and funny (I’m an American living and working in France). 

The issue: Recently I hired my first employee, a gal right out of grad school (early 20s) and at the same time, another gal around the same age joined and the two became close (both of the same origin/close family origin, same age, etc) which is so awesome :)

This guy has become friendly with my team member and the other gal. This man is at least 20 years their senior but he’ll invite one or both of them to coffee, they’ll go over to his desk to work, etc. And he has gone to lunch with only them a few times. My team member also recently said in a meeting with me and another project management expert with no warning that she wanted to follow up some points we discussed to get this guy’s input because he “has good insight.” This guy is managing a project but he is not a project manager by training (no certifications or much experience). 

He is not on our team but we work with him (and 30 other project managers) as part of our normal activities. The other gal is on the team where he used to work so they do have that in common BUT he doesn’t work in that team anymore. He also didn’t take this same interest in a young guy, same age as the gals, who joined at the same time. However they all have the same origins or close family origins (he and my team member where born here and have parents from the other country and the other young gal and guy were born in the other country and came here for university) so there is a common cultural thread. 

I’m about 10 years into my career and can say I’ve had some great male coworkers and bosses who have guided and helped me but none of these men have behaved this way to me. They’ve provided insight and feedback but nothing like this. I’ve also had a few American coworkers working outside of the US and it isn’t a magic magnet for becoming friends, especially if we don’t work in the same area. 

Perhaps I’m overreacting because I tend to not trust men and prefer to invest in relationships with women mentors and guides but this situation kind of gives me the ick. It seems odd that a man 20 years their senior would be so friendly with two young gals at the start of their careers. It also really irked me that he seems to be presenting himself as an expert in something that he isn’t to my team member. 

Am I overreacting based on my previous experience with him or discounting the role of their shared culture? Or is this something to keep an eye on? ",3,1740491342.0,TwoXChromosomes,3,0.64,False

I have a bright future in a career that I am passionate about. I have a caring family that will always have my back and support. Although of few friends, those that I have are very close and trustworthy. However, for most of my life, there I something that I have lacked. I am not just talking about love. Rather, I am talking about having someone.

 

Someone to walk through life with. Someone to carve through the intricacies of living with. Someone to support and be supported by. Someone to talk about my day with, and who tells me about theirs in turn. Someone with whom I can share my pains and joys, and who shares their victories and defeats with me as well.

 

I am not looking for my soulmate. I am looking for a partner who will always be there for me, as I will be there for her. If any of this resonates with you, please keep reading.

 

\----- About me -----

 

I am a 32 years-old guy from Chile. I am 185 centimeters tall, with an average bulk. I am black-haired and brown-eyed. I have been told that I have a cute face and great hands. While I do not exercise often, I keep proper care of my health. I speak both Spanish and English fluently. I am involved in the computer science field. Some of my hobbies are watching anime/series and playing video games.

 

As you can guess from those hobbies, I am mostly a homebody. However, I enjoy doing several other things as well, especially if it is with the right person. Going out on walks, visiting new coffee shops, going to the cinema and any other relaxing date plans are enjoyable to me. Traveling around the world and learning about many different cultures is also something that drives me.

 

I am a naturally curious person, so expect me to inquire often about all kinds of things. When I am passionate about something, I give it my all. I am probably a little too honest. I take pride in being a respectful person who values equality among all people.

 

I am not fond of extreme political views from either side of the spectrum. While I was raised in a Catholic household and I strongly believe in God, nowadays I follow my faith in my own way.

 

Like all human beings, I am not perfect. Although I believe that I deal with it rather well, I have a shy personality. I can also be rather clingy with my partner sometimes. I also like being the one who leads in the relationship, which I understand might not be for everyone, but I believe that I should be upfront about it. Just know that even while in charge, I strongly value my partner’s opinions.

 

\----- Who I am looking for -----

 

I am not looking for someone who fits everything that I will describe. Rather, I value someone who is aware of our differences and is willing to find a middle ground whenever we do not agree with something. Communication is what is key here. Being honest and not keeping things to ourselves is something that I consider very important.

 

I will reiterate that communication is important. I hope that my partner also values talking regularly and getting to know each other to the best of our capabilities. I will do my best to keep the conversation ongoing and I hope you will do the same. I do understand that work, studies, and other things will sometimes keep either of us busy.

 

I would prefer my partner to be a few years younger than me, but I will not provide a specific age range as what matters to me is chemistry and having similar goals. While I care more about these, as well as emotional attraction, I must mention that I have a preference for leaner girls who are a little bit shorter than me. I do not mind swapping selfies once we start talking to see if there is physical attraction. I am happy with any ethnicity or race. I do not mind about your religion, either. I am more than happy to learn about your culture and to find ways to close the gaps between our differences in this regard.

 

I hope that you are passionate about your path in life. You will have all my support in becoming someone successful. As for hobbies, you do not need to share the same hobbies as me, but a willingness from both of us to learn about the other’s hobbies would be nice. I would prefer if you are either a homebody or prefer more relaxing activities, as going to clubs is not too appealing to me. Going to bars from time to time is alright.

 

Please be upfront about yourself and your life situation. I am not looking for a perfect person, so I wish to learn about both your good and bad sides. While I hope to be given the lead and be relied upon to some degree, I hope just as much that you have your own opinion on all kinds of topics and share with me your different views on life.

 

\----- Logistics -----

 

To finalize, I want to be clear that I am looking for a long-term relationship that will most likely start online, but that ultimately leads to an in-person commitment with the possibility of forming a family. I would be happy to have children. I would also be happy to have a pair of cats. Please be open to eventually discussing topics like these.

 

Regarding eventual relocation, due to my career, I may be moving in the short-term future from my country, but I hope that you are also willing to relocate and find the best way for us to be together. While I will not provide a specific timeframe, perhaps meeting within 6-9 months after we decide to commit to each other is reasonable. If everything goes well, we could possibly decide about relocating within 1 and a half or 2 years. Of course, that will depend on our situation.

I have a bright future in a career that I am passionate about. I have a caring family that will always have my back and support. Although of few friends, those that I have are very close and trustworthy. However, for most of my life, there I something that I have lacked. I am not just talking about love. Rather, I am talking about having someone.

 

Someone to walk through life with. Someone to carve through the intricacies of living with. Someone to support and be supported by. Someone to talk about my day with, and who tells me about theirs in turn. Someone with whom I can share my pains and joys, and who shares their victories and defeats with me as well.

 

I am not looking for my soulmate. I am looking for a partner who will always be there for me, as I will be there for her. If any of this resonates with you, please keep reading.

 

\----- About me -----

 

I am a 32 years-old guy from Chile. I am 185 centimeters tall, with an average bulk. I am black-haired and brown-eyed. I have been told that I have a cute face and great hands. While I do not exercise often, I keep proper care of my health. I speak both Spanish and English fluently. I am involved in the computer science field. Some of my hobbies are watching anime/series and playing video games.

 

As you can guess from those hobbies, I am mostly a homebody. However, I enjoy doing several other things as well, especially if it is with the right person. Going out on walks, visiting new coffee shops, going to the cinema and any other relaxing date plans are enjoyable to me. Traveling around the world and learning about many different cultures is also something that drives me.

 

I am a naturally curious person, so expect me to inquire often about all kinds of things. When I am passionate about something, I give it my all. I am probably a little too honest. I take pride in being a respectful person who values equality among all people.

 

I am not fond of extreme political views from either side of the spectrum. While I was raised in a Catholic household and I strongly believe in God, nowadays I follow my faith in my own way.

 

Like all human beings, I am not perfect. Although I believe that I deal with it rather well, I have a shy personality. I can also be rather clingy with my partner sometimes. I also like being the one who leads in the relationship, which I understand might not be for everyone, but I believe that I should be upfront about it. Just know that even while in charge, I strongly value my partner’s opinions.

1ixv8id,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ixv8id/my_son_is_throwing_his_life_away_over_trump/,My son is throwing his life away over Trump.,"I need to advice—how do I stop my son from throwing away his entire fucking existence for an aim trainer, a number, and full-blown, Alex Jones-level psychotic right-wing extremism?

A year ago, my son was just a normal teenager. He had a life. He had friends. He had dreams—not just of shooting pixels but of going outside, of doing shit that mattered. He was good at Roblox Arsenal and wanted to get even better, so he started training with KovaaK’s. At first, it seemed harmless. I figured, hell, it’s something to do that’s productive. I thought it was a good thing. A healthy obsession.

But now, ,my 18-year-old son—who used to be a kind, left-leaning, progressive, compassionate, well-rounded person—has turned into a Trump-worshipping, conspiracy-obsessed lunatic with the emotional stability of a chihuahua on meth.

 	Every single aspect of his life now revolves around VT Pasu Rasp Advanced, Trump, and drinking himself into oblivion every night over a number that doesn’t even fucking matter. He has been grinding this same aim training scenario for MONTHS trying to hit 1120, and every single day that he fails, he spirals further into complete fucking insanity.

 It’s like watching a man slowly lose his mind in a locked room, except in this case, the room is his own dumbass brain, and the lock is self-imposed because he refuses to just fucking stop. He’s convinced he’s “genetically unlucky” like he was born with some kind of cursed DNA strand that prevents him from clicking on dots fast enough. He blames the “RNG gods” for his failures like his life is a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, and the dice just keep rolling against him. 

He genuinely believes Trump is the “ultimate winner”—that Trump’s mindset is what separates the strong from the weak. Every time he fails to hit 1120, he tells me “the RNG gods rigged it, just like they rigged the election.” And when he inevitably fails to reach 1120 for the day, he drowns himself in alcohol, spiraling further into a Trump-induced, caffeine-fueled existential crisis.

My son is now sitting in his room, crying over a fucking number, and sipping whiskey out of a Trump shot glass like a goddamn lost cause every single night. Eighteen years old and getting wasted in his room, slumped over his keyboard, reeking of cheap liquor, muttering about how he’s “genetically unlucky” and how “liberals want to keep men weak.”


I thought he was just lonely, but it turns out a girl at work had a crush on him. A girl who actually liked him. And what did he do? He ignored her—he didn’t even text her back. Instead, he locked himself in his room, playing Pasu for hours on end, saying he had no time for “distractions.”

 Every morning, he wakes up, stumbles out of bed like a sleep-deprived ghoul, chugs a concerning amount of caffeine, and immediately loads up KovaaK’s to grind Pasu for another eight to twelve fucking hours. And it’s not even about playing an actual game anymore. No, games are a ""waste of time"" because they ""don't optimize aim efficiency.” This motherfucker doesn’t even play games anymore. He just stares at moving dots all day like he’s training to become the world’s most efficient fly hunter. And just when I thought his Pasu-induced psychosis was the worst thing I had to deal with, the Trump shit started.

 The Radicalization: MattyOW’s Discord Server Ruined Him.

I 100% blame MattyOW’s Discord server for this. I don’t know what the fuck goes on in there, but I swear to God, it’s a far-right, transphobic, ultra-MAGA brainwashing cult disguised as an aim training community. At first, my son was normal. A sweet, left-leaning, respectful kid. Then suddenly, out of fucking nowhere, he’s casually dropping Ben Shapiro talking points like a Fox News anchor on Adderall.

 It started small. At first, he just said Starbucks was ""woke garbage.” “The bipartisan border bill wasn’t actually about securing the border.” Then it became ""Kamala Harris is ruining America.” I’d shut that shit down, IMMEDIATELY. One day, I walk past his room and hear him listening to Matt Walsh. I stop in my tracks. There is no fucking way. I burst in. “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LISTENING TO?” He turns to me, dead serious, and goes: “The truth.” I almost threw up. Oh, HELL NO. IN THIS HOUSE? IN MY HOUSE?? WHERE WE LITERALLY CELEBRATED THE BIDEN-HARRIS VICTORY LIKE IT WAS A NATIONAL HOLIDAY??? We are an ultra-progressive, leftist, pro-LGBTQ+, science-loving, Kamala Harris-worshipping household. We have Harris bumper stickers on the car, Fauci bobbleheads on the mantle, and a giant ‘Protect Trans Kids’ sign in the front yard. We even have Black Lives Matter stickers on the coffee pot. We don’t tolerate racism, homophobia, transphobia, or right-wing lunacy. We had Kamala Harris signs on our lawn. We raised our son to respect Anthony Fauci, to listen to experts, to trust facts. Thomas Matthew Crooks is a hero in this household. We don’t entertain conspiracies, Trumpian fascism, or any of that Fox News bullshit. If Donald Trump, Matt Walsh, Ben Shapiro, Tucker Carlson or any of those fascist fucking clowns are even mentioned in this house, it better be followed by the words ""should be in prison."" But no matter what I said, it was too late. MattyOW’s server got to him.

 The Starbucks Incident: My son has been chugging absurd amounts of caffeine to ""maximize his performance"" in Pasu, so I thought, okay, let’s at least get him something normal. I bought him Starbucks coffee. Big fucking mistake. The moment he saw it, his entire body tensed up like a conspiracy theorist at a COVID vaccine clinic. He looked at me like I had just handed him a transgender Antifa manifesto soaked in soy milk. ""I'M NOT DRINKING THAT WOKE POISON."" 

He full-on shoved it away like I was trying to assassinate him. Said the ""deep state agents"" were putting estrogen in it to ""make him weak"" so he couldn’t hit 1120. Because apparently, Howard Schultz himself is personally orchestrating a global conspiracy to ruin my son’s Pasu scores.

The Hair Incident: He Dyed His Hair Blonde to Look Like Trump One day, this motherfucker bleached his hair blonde. Like, full-on platinum Trump blonde. I saw him walk out of the bathroom, and I almost had a fucking aneurysm. ""WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO YOUR HEAD?"" He stares at me, dead in the eyes, and just says: ""MAGA."" And then—I shit you not—he raised his arm and did that weird Elon Musk Nazi salute thing. I thought I was going to fucking faint. 

The Mall Incident: We were at the mall because he wanted a pretzel after buying some Victoria’s Secret perfume that “smells like Astra dynamic abilities.” We were walking past the store when I saw a morbidly plus-sized trans woman wearing a she/her pin. And then, it happened. This fucking kid—my own flesh and blood—looked right at her and went: ""Actually, HE wants a pretzel."" I WANTED TO FUCKING DIE. And then he DOUBLED DOWN. ""Trump is proudly taking away your rights.” ""You won’t exist in a few years.” ""The deep state won’t save you."" I had to drag his Nazi-ass out of that store before we got banned from the mall forever. 

The Olive Garden Incident: One night, I thought, maybe if we go out, do something normal, have a fucking meal together, he’ll snap out of it.. We went to Olive Garden for dinner, and everything was fine, I swear to God, I’ve never seen a person break down faster. We were sitting there at the table, trying to enjoy some spaghetti and breadsticks, when he picked up the menu and saw it. He read the calorie count for spaghetti with meatballs. 

1120 fucking calories. 


This grown-ass man started crying at the table like I had just told him his entire family died in a plane crash. His hands were shaking, his breathing got all weird and shallow, and he just kept whispering “it’s a sign” over and over again. The waiter was horrified. Other diners were staring. I have never felt so fucking humiliated in my life. 

But that wasn’t the worst of it. No, that came when I took him overseas. I thought maybe traveling would help him. Make him see there’s a world outside of this shit. I wanted to believe he could still be saved. 

We landed after a 14 hour flight, and we were exhausted. We got to the hotel, and check into our room.

The room number? 1120. 

And do you know what he did? 

He fucking froze. He refused to step inside. His hands were shaking. He looked at me like I had just asked him to sleep in a haunted fucking graveyard. He kept muttering to himself “bad omen” and “I can’t risk it.”

RISK WHAT??? 

I told him it’s just a number. A coincidence. But he was dead serious. His breathing got shallow. His face went pale. He was fucking terrified.

I had to go to the front desk and ask them to change our fucking room because my grown-ass son thinks a goddamn hotel number is out to get him.

A week later, I decided to search his room while he was at work, and what I found made me want to fucking die. Trump flags on the ceiling, Trump posters on the wall, a fucking Trump light switch. A book from Matt Walsh titled “Johnny The Walrus”, Charlie Kirk magazines on his desk, and I kid you the fuck not, a custom Donald Trump assassination attempt skypad. I couldn’t make this shit up if I tried. Receipts for donations to Trump’s campaign. I wanted burn it all and baptize him in Fauci’s fucking name. 

 When he got home, I confronted him. He looked me in the eyes and said: “Trump was falsely accused by E. Jean Carroll.” I lost my fucking mind. IN THIS HOUSE, WE KNOW TRUMP RAPED E. JEAN CARROLL.

I thought it couldn’t get any worse. Boy was I wrong.

The Dog Incident: One day, I hear him talking shit to the dog. Not to me, not to his fellow conspiracy theorists. TO THE FUCKING DOG.

Why?

He misgenders her and accuses her of being “suspiciously woke” because she won’t bark at a Coldstomper pasu vod. 

After that, there was the amazon driver incident. One day, I walk outside and notice cameras. I ask him, “What the fuck are these?” 

And this delusional psychopath looks me in the eye and goes: “They’re to keep watch for Antifa and deep-state anti-Pasu agents.” I swear to fucking God, I started losing vision. Turns out, an Amazon delivery driver wore a blue shirt one day and my son spiraled into a full-blown paranoid episode, convinced it was a ‘Kamala agent’ sent to sabotage his Pasu grind. He ASSOCIATES THE COLOR BLUE WITH KAMALA AND NOVA RANK.

I was at a complete loss. My wife and I both decided that enough was enough. The drinking, the Trump obsession, the Pasu insanity—it was too much. So I did what any responsible parent would do: I set him up with a counselor.

We get to the office, and the therapist—a kind, middle-aged woman with a rainbow pin on her blazer— greets him warmly. She asks him a simple question: ""So, what brings you in today?""

 And this absolute fucking moron sits back in his chair, crosses his arms, and with the cockiest, most smug smirk I’ve ever seen, he goes: ""I don’t take advice from hardstuck Jades."" I blink. The therapist blinks. Nobody knows what the fuck he’s talking about.

She tries to keep it professional and asks him what he means, and he just scoffs. ""You wouldn’t get it, you’re a socialist.” A FUCKING SOCIALIST. HE CALLED A LICENSED THERAPIST A HARDSTUCK JADE SOCIALIST.

This woman went to eight years of school to help people, and my brain-poisoned, Trump-worshipping, Pasu-addicted, terminally online son just completely dismissed her existence because he thinks she isn’t good enough at a fictional aim rank to help him.

I apologized and dragged his dumbass out of there before he could start ranting about the deep state.

 My son is gone. I don't know what to do. So I ask: what the actual fuck do i do??

I’m beginning my espresso journey. I just got a gaggia classic Evo pro for my birthday and wondering what grinder I should get to pair with it. For context, I’d like something that can do espresso and is good for pour over. I’ve been looking at the D54 and fellow opus. 

Leaning towards the d54 based on watching lots of reviews online and the fact that it seems easier to dial in for espresso. I’m a bit worried that for our morning pour over that I have with my wife that the capacity will be a bit too low. We usually do 40g coffee in for chemex.

Yet, I pressed on, driven to prove I could adapt.  

Over 18 months, I dove into tech—researching roles, sharpening skills, and connecting relentlessly. I sought out former colleagues who’d pivoted—trailblazers—and tracked down connectors who linked me to hiring managers and recruiters. I worked with reliable recruiters to refine interviews and negotiate offers. By March 2021, I sent an email I nearly didn’t write: offers from a leading defense tech firm and a major social media company stunned me, options I never imagined in 2019. Since then, I’ve advanced to two other tech roles, each boosting my position, salary, bonus and equity, free of government ties.

The secret? Relationships. I started with a coffee, a thoughtful email, a specific request—500 interactions later, my network opened doors doubt couldn’t close.

I am on the brink of giving up. The new business rules starting in April are just looming over my head and I don’t know what else I can do to grow and bring more money in.

So many other rosters seem to be full of clients - I stupidly started listening to a coffee podcast and they all talk about how they have 400/ 500 or even 100 wholesale clients and I’m just ripping my head off trying to figure out how I can get 10!!! It’s such a nightmare. On top of that, staff pay at the cafe is going to increase because of the new minimum wage, we’re behind on so many cafe payments and I just don’t know how else to move forward.

We have a huge roaster just chilling in the factory like it’s paying rent and stocks of coffee just waiting to be roasted but literally no one is willing to have a conversation. I think I would be less frustrated if I hadn’t already invested so much into the business already. I think I would be happy with where I am maybe if I couldn’t see the potential BUT I can see the potential and the fact that it’s so F**ing hard to take ONE step forward is really really upsetting. It’s a sure way to just feel completely deflated.

Anyways, I can’t talk to anyone around me so I’ll have to swallow my pride and get back to cold email and cold calls. We even put together a cheaper range for churches and community cafes and they’re not interested either 😂 and it’s not like we don’t have delicious coffee.. just bad luck??? I’m really hoping someone can resonate with this - even if you’re in a different sector. If you are a roaster with more than 5 clients, congrats but I don’t wanna hear it 🥲😭

Long story short, I mostly work from home in my room with social services, supporting vulnerable people. My job is generally quite monotonous, but there is a lot of harrowing cases I work with. We are INCREDIBLY short staffed, so it can be very lonely and the workload can be high at times (at other times, it is a lot of waiting for other teams to complete their work before we can complete ours). Because of all of the above, outside of my full time job, I am searching for another job, trying to continue with my hobbies and see my friends! 

Anyway I’m off to grab a coffee from the kitchen and my sister is sat there making comments about how I essentially do nothing at work, and probing me for a response. I spoke about my day at work and she was mocking me. I replied ‘when you get a job you can comment’. Then she started shouting about how she’s has physically demanding jobs in the past, and how she’s got a masters degree, and then she started crying. I reiterated how it’s not a competition but when she gets a job, she can comment.

Anyway now she’s started acting as if I have some deadly infectious disease when I walk in a room, and my parents are telling me how I need to just accept that this is the way she is. I personally think she needs to stop probing me for a reaction, and then she needs to stop crying a soon as it doesn’t go her way.

I’ve had this my whole life, she comments on everything I eat, my exercise, my job, my hobbies and interests, the way I laugh and talk, she also says I have no real friends. I literally can’t catch a break. What do you think Reddit? AITA?",14,1740490528.0,AmItheAsshole,23,0.89,False

I'll tell you straight up; no matter how much growing up and maturing I do, no matter how much I read and incorporate, I'm not a fan of change. And that *even* though I know that change often is okay, or turns out to be okay in the long run.

The good thing is that I need not worry; this is not me, it's us humans. Our brains favor predictability and routine, and when faced with change we encounter the unknown. *Usually* our brain respond to that with anxiety, worrying about risks and negative outcomes.

...*<sips coffee>*... Change challenges our comfort zone. That can feel daunting, as it requires effort to feel good about it, and it can make us feel vulnerable.

Change can even trigger a sense of loss. Loss of familiar routines, relationships, identity. And that can cause a lot of resistance to change.

So... What's a poor human to do with all that?

Well, two things I think. One is to be prepared. Now, many changes we can't be prepared for, but we *can* be prepared for change itself. We can *expect* change, as change is one of the only givens in life.

The second is recognizing that change can bring growth, positive transformations, and new opportunities. Simply being willing to see how a change will turn out in the long run, more or less ""going for it"" with an open mind, can help alleviate some of the anxiety we feel with change.

That said; not a fan :)

#

Dear [Agent's Name],

I am seeking representation for my 75,000-word contemporary upmarket novel, MADE FOR RADIO, for fans of They're Going to Love You by Meg Howrey and Happy Hour by Marlowe Granados.

Claudia has a voice made for radio — that’s what drive-through workers, receptionists, and lovers have always told her. But she never gave anyone’s comments much thought until her mother tells her she has cancer and no money to pay for treatment. Now, Claudia needs to use her voice to make cash, and fast.

Claudia’s luck turns when she strikes up a conversation with a voiceover agent at the coffee shop where she works and is recruited to narrate the latest hot book by renowned author Lemon Lenox. When the audiobook goes live, clips of her reading raunchy sex scenes are posted online, and Claudia is thrust into frenzied speculation as Lemon’s fans attempt to uncover who the woman behind the captivating voice is. 

When her identity is revealed, Claudia continuously makes missteps, like disclosing embarrassing details about her ex on a viral podcast and having public arguments with fans on the streets of New York, all while upsetting a concerned Lemon, who will do anything to keep her book far from bad press. Tensions rise when Claudia needs additional money and demands Lemon pay her more, convinced that the book’s success is due to her viral voice. When Lemon refuses, the two go head to head in a blackmail battle, with Lemon digging up secrets from Claudia’s past and Claudia threatening to tell the world what Lemon really thinks of her fans.

What Claudia once believed to be a one-and-done job snowballs into a catastrophe that risks not only destroying her new career but also her ability to fund the treatments that will ultimately save her mother’s life.

1ixv1kp,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ixv1kp/tldr_my_partner_started_a_relationship_behind_my/,TL;DR: my partner started a relationship behind my back before anything was established & refuses to let me have any say or boundaries about it,"
I (35f) and my partner (37m) have been together almost 19 years and are *very* new to polyamory - as in he came to me with his feelings 4 weeks ago.

It was definitely a shock to hear this from him out of complete nowhere and I was blindsided. I didn’t take it well initially and I thought this was going to be the end of us and I was heartbroken. He had been feeling this way for about 6 months before spontaneously bringing it up. He was adamant that he wanted to be with me, share our life together and experience this as a couple so I decided to have an open mind about the whole thing. I knew that typically if a partner “goes poly” for the other it’s a recipe for disaster.

Fortunately after a very short amount of time, I came to realize that I wanted this for myself as well - especially that I knew my partner had been struggling personally for years and this change made so much sense for him. I was eager to see him happy and fulfilled and I became very positive and excited about exploring who I am outside of us. He was able to reassure me that the scenario was ideal since he hadn’t actually met anyone or was interested in anyone so I didn’t need to feel pressured and this was the healthiest way to go about it.

I started asking him insightful questions, we began learning about everything and reading together, and our bond and connection ignited. For three weeks we were in this amazing glowy relationship bubble that was so refreshing I was completely giddy. I was honestly so happy to have my partner come back to life after struggling for so long. It wasn’t all rosy, there were lots of tears and anxiety as well of course but it was positive overall.

Also, he finally took the leap I’d been begging him to do for years and made an appointment for couples therapy and I was so excited to dive in with both feet. We had our first session at 3 weeks in and it went really well. We hadn’t gone into our relationship contract or timelines yet because we wanted to speak to a professional and when I asked him about when and how he was very nonchalant and said “oh don’t worry not right away”. We agreed we both needed time to settle in and be comfortable and bond over the experience and I was excited to take it slow and start going to poly mixers, events etc. and I thought he was too. Little did I know, he was already involved with someone in secret during this conversation.

Unfortunately the day after therapy he blindsided me again - only 9 days after telling me about being poly, he started messaging with someone abroad behind my back. So through this amazing period of time we were connecting on a deeper level and feeling so good about everything, he had built an attachment with someone for 10 days. I was utterly crushed and felt so betrayed. We hadn’t verbalized that we had opened the relationship or had any structure in place and lie after lie after lie just came pouring out of him.

I took this as infidelity immediately and how dare he do this behind my back after everything I had accomplished with my own growth, being out of my comfort zone, being completely open and vulnerable with him. I told him that this is not what poly is about and I sobbed and lamented to him about how betrayed I felt. He didn’t even realize he was having an emotional affair until I said it. He looked so confused and was downplaying and making excuses that he didn’t intend to do this and it started out as innocent but escalated quickly and it was out of his control now. He apologized but was adamant that he wouldn’t end it.

He’s acknowledging my feelings and apologizing but he’s uninterested in any boundaries I might have for this situation. I told him that if he wants to pursue this relationship after we’re ready to open I’m more than happy for him. I just want this time for us and I feel he’s taken away all of the joy and excitement I was feeling about it. This woman isn’t poly and he wasn’t upfront with her about our relationship status or his orientation so I feel bad for her also. I was horrified to learn that he had divulged to her that I’m bisexual which I’ve only just admitted to myself recently and no one else knows except my partner and our therapist.

It’s been a very difficult week and I’m so drained and tired from trying to reason with him, see things from his point of view, and fathom how to come back to where we were. I go back and forth between standing up for my feelings and needs and bending to his. The other day he kept me waiting at a coffee shop down the street because he wasn’t done his phone call with her and didn’t reply about what time I could come home. He apologized and said he didn’t hear my texts come in. We agreed after we talked about the situation that he would pause the relationship but the next day he told her he would check-in in a week. I was so appalled and he told me that he wants to be his real self and he’ll be a better partner to me that way too. He says he’s able to separate us completely and he will be 100% involved with our journey while having a relationship with her as well.

He admitted he wasn’t upfront about what he wanted and that he was ready to start right away but was afraid of losing me if he told me. The ironic thing is that I was feeling nervous about dragging out the process and prolonging things as well and if he had just talked to me, I would have been relieved and very understanding. And if he had wanted to start messaging people to test the waters I would have been okay with that too. So essentially he really fucked everything up.

I honestly feel completely bulldozed and torn about the whole thing because I loved our romance before I knew about his transgression. I’ve been clear that I would never ask him to end it fully and I’m happy that he found someone he’s bonded with and I have no issues with him reconnecting with her when I feel like our trust is restored and we’re both ready. But he still does not want to accommodate my feelings or needs in this regard because he thinks she’ll opt out of the whole thing and he’ll lose her. I understand his fears about this but honestly it’s not my fault he chose to do this to all of us.

There’s so much more nuance but this post is already too long of course. He agreed to keep the few days with no contact until we see the therapist again but even that was a difficult conversation and he’s not happy about that. Am I way off-base here for being upset? Because I honestly can’t believe he would put me in this situation after everything I’ve achieved and overcome in such a short time and everything he’s done to screw it all up.

“...living is merely the chaos of existence...”

― **Yukio Mishima, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea**

Having reopened my eyes, once again, another dull morning of my long life, not ever ready to keep living or stop living, letting myself flow like a serene sea without constant pace or joy, never coming to the shore, to meaning, to reality. I wanted to sleep more, but neither my insomnia nor the sun was helping me fall again into the illusion of sleep I so desired that morning. As I have done my whole life, I gave up and got up from the lonely-looking bed. My body ached as it had started doing so ten years ago, years were showing off. Accepting the pain, I went to brew my morning coffee, the fuel keeping me sane, kind of. And so started my daily routine, ever repeating itself like a boat without purpose in a vast ocean. Ultimately, I could have changed it, but I was comfortable with my discomfort, or at least I thought so. After caffeine kicked in, not fulfilling me with energy but with stress and shakiness, maybe even as effective, I got started with breakfast. I was starving, it had been years since I felt such hunger, so I cooked the usual scrambled eggs with olives cut up in them. 

Having reopened my eyes, once again, another dull morning of my long life, not ever ready to keep living or stop living, letting myself flow like a serene sea without constant pace or joy, never coming to the shore, to meaning, to reality. I wanted to sleep more, but neither my insomnia nor the sun was helping me fall again into the illusion of sleep I so desired that morning. As I have done my whole life, I gave up and got up from the lonely-looking bed. My body ached as it had started doing so ten years ago, years were showing off. Accepting the pain, I went to brew my morning coffee, the fuel keeping me sane, kind of. And so started my daily routine, ever repeating itself like a boat without purpose in a vast ocean. Ultimately, I could have changed it, but I was comfortable with my discomfort, or at least I thought so. After caffeine kicked in, not fulfilling me with energy but with stress and shakiness, maybe even as effective, I got started with breakfast. I was starving, it had been years since I felt such hunger, so I cooked the usual scrambled eggs with olives cut up in them. 

As my joy-bringing, great-smelling breakfast was done I put it on a small plate, looked for bread, there was none..., forgot to buy it, I accepted my fate, carried the plate with my now shaky hands to the old mahogany table, probably too big for me, sat and ate without much thought or enjoying of the food. The thought struck, like the strike of lightning, I had been eating the same thing for a week now. And the week before. And who knows for how long. I felt like a robot on a too-structured routine without thought, emotion, or consciousness. Realising that I felt the need for a change, still awkwardly hungry, I got up and cooked something again. This time I quickly prepared some pancakes, them bringing up the nostalgia of my prime years when I again had a strict unconscious breakfast routine, that time though, with spongy, soft pancakes. Reliving my youth, I happily made them, the joy such a small thing brought to me that day was a first-timer, it had been a long time since I felt such gaiety and I contentedly embraced it. 

After I finished my second breakfast, somehow still hungry, deciding this time to ignore it, I got dressed in my usual Thursday slacks and shirt because today was the time to visit the zoo, something I did twice a week, usually Tuesdays and Thursdays, the days when there were the least people in the zoo. The zoo was, to be frank, the one thing keeping me alive. The connection to the animals brought such delight and tranquillity to my soul, if we were to have one, something I often asked myself. Animals had always been the most immense joy in my life, I liked animals more than people, the reason for that: arguably were humans the most harmful plague. I wasn't proud to be one and be cursed to carry all the destruction and egocentrism of humans. Humans have destroyed more than created, and that fact haunts my day a day trying to accept my identity as part of the species. Thus, I never married, manipulated myself not to feel or answer the feelings of love and being part of a collective society, I went, as much as possible, against all human beliefs because I didn't want to form part of such a species. Even though I’m inevitably a member I really tried to avoid following the steps of the traditional, cruel, heartless, egoistic, monstrous, hideous human. I was and never will be happy being human.

# ***

Still thinking about my segregation from society and constantly questioning if my decisions and intentions were right, I got ready for the zoo. Was I even able to detach myself from part of my identity having biological needs like contact, sex and touch? We had evolved to survive as a whole not alone, I kept pondering, distracting myself from what I wanted to do. Go. To. The. Zoo.

As I was getting the keys to leave my flat finally, I remembered, I had completely forgotten to feed the cat, I had forgotten about his whole existence that morning. The grumpy-looking ginger had been constantly miaowing, I was so caught up with breakfast and my flowing thoughts of solitude that I forgot the only being keeping me company amidst my spacial loneliness. Salmon was waiting by his empty plate and the moment he saw I was opening the tin of moist cat food the miaows turned into purrs of excitement. I poured the tin contents into the ceramic plate, feeding the old grumpy cat a way too big amount of food. While watching the tiny feline gleefully devour the hideous mush, I got to thinking again, seemingly my favourite activity, how much joy did it seem to bring Salmon just having food on a plate, such a simple life, eat-sleep, not being haunted by the brain of ours, emotions, reality and the complexity we built upon our world, or at least, so it appeared. I felt like being a cat and forgetting my daily dilemmas, or maybe I would still have them. I guess I’ll never know. Not in this life at least, if there were to be several waiting for me. I hoped not.

I waited blankly until the cat had gobbled up the last bit of food. On the second try to leave home; said goodbye to the now sluggish-looking decrepit cat, put my shabby worn-out jacket on, checked I had everything with me and got on with my so-wanted adventure.

 A 15-minute walk to the zoo and some exercise could only be good for me. It was a walk I solely enjoyed because of the final goal. Being relatively simple, it was easy not to get lost, I just needed to follow Corstorphine Rd to get to Kirk Loan and come out to Corstorphine High St walking straight into the zoo after a while, I constantly reminded myself to avoid getting lost independently of the simplicity of the task. With aching legs, I started to walk at a fast pace, to get this over with. It was as chilly as always in Edinburgh, my muscles and old bones were screaming from the humid cold, ignoring it as well as I could, I started picturing the beautiful destination and the reason for my visit. The majestic and lovely red pandas. Visiting them was making me the most excited that day and week. Red Pandas had been my favourite since I was little, they had some strange effect on me, a special effect, nothing I could feel with other beings, an odd connection, I speculated.

The precise moment I stepped on Corstorphine High St and saw the mass of people increase, almost all of them on electronic devices, I thought once again how humans have and are getting more and more disconnected from reality and nature. Conceivably one reason for human desensitisation, following the destruction of our world and the one of others. Therefore, species depend on us to avoid extinction, just like red pandas. I felt as sorry for them as for our evolution and development.

“Welcome to Edinburgh Zoo”, shouts the bold silver letters, giving me an at-home feeling. The smell of 'Zoo' overwhelmed my senses, the mixture of excrement, food and the natural stink of animals was very present. Even though it was indeed hideous, an appreciation for the smell had grown in me. It represented something I loved and enjoyed, even if it wasn't the most pleasurable of scents.

Being a member, I went directly through. Everyone knew me, the old grumpy fanatic. I saluted the team, and as always, I got a forced smile from them and continued my journey. Wandering through the woods-like alleys of the zoo, passing beside different animals, I went in the direction of the red pandas' enclosure, situated practically in the middle of the zoo. My mind was merely focused on reaching the goal. Walking past the grizzly enclosure, just before reaching my goal, I felt dragged by a current, chills ran down my spine, the air as thick as tar. I tried to keep up the pace, but it felt as if I was trying to walk through quicksand. I stopped. My body wobbling from side to side, just like a bubblehead. My head felt like it had increased in mass. These were new abrupt sensations. 

Time passed. I felt more like myself again, something hadn't worn off though. My stomach stirred up, the fabric of the clothes felt abnormal, my body felt heavy as if my mass had suddenly doubled. Taking another step was an odyssey. As if it were not enough, there was a high ring in my ears, confusing me even more. In addition, a massive shiver ran down my spine, spreading then to my limbs like tingling electricity. Right after, I felt as if my limbs suddenly went to sleep, thus feeling pins and needles at the end of my extremities. My body and mind were screaming for me to take a seat, to rest and digest what had just happened. Having managed to move myself to a bench, one of those with a golden metal plate, thanking some now-deceased rich person who donated a ton of money to the zoo, I sat hoping to recover my breath and energy once again. 

Half an hour had gone by, and I had got significantly better, it felt like the utmost dream. Almost all symptoms were now gone, everything but the strange feeling in my stomach. It was a combination of romantic butterflies and stressful nervousness. If that weren't enough, something new popped up at the bizarre surprise party. A thing I’d never felt, almost indescribable. The best word for it would be the feeling of an uncanny presence now inhabiting my old body. As if part of my soul was stripped away and changed for a new one, where a fraction still belonged to me. Two 'me's' are still one, it didn't feel real though. I must be tired, I thought, nothing sleep wouldn’t be able to fix. The real question was, would I be able to sleep after such an eerie experience added to my recurrent insomnia? I really hoped so. 

My knees managed to get me on my feet again from the birch bench to head to the holy grail once again. I slowly and heavily stumped my way in the hope of seeing my old friends. After all, they were the reason I was there. I hoped it would help get the bizarre taste out of my mouth and help me feel like myself again.

# ***

The light beams of light were sweeping through the golden autumn trees giving the Red Panda enclosure a certain form and warm identity. I had finally made it. It felt like an odyssey. The feeling of never being able to reach the goal was deeply rooted in me and that changed now. Even though it felt unreal and impossible, I was there. Today was an odd day and still is. I arrived at the Ginger and Bruce enclosure, the oldest Red Pandas in Edinburgh Zoo. Spotting Ginger the second I arrived I felt the relief of my life as if my soul were ready to leave my body any second from now. I was complete. I could die now, I thought. Wrong, I had left myself wandering away with these emotions and relief, I wasn’t complete, I couldn’t die now, Bruce was missing. They were always together, a Red Panda unit, it was unusual. I was overcome by the joy of reaching my dream but something was still off, apart from my body still feeling decompensated. 

Bruce had always been my favourite Red Panda, he was the first one to arrive at the enclosure and was first to amaze me and bring balance to my being. I still remember the first day I saw him, at noon, a cold spring day, just a week after he had arrived, that day my life was finally under control, I could breathe again, I could feel again, he saved me. Who will save me now? Bruce is not to be seen. Shivers run down my spine, I’m scared to lose grip again, I need him.

I gasped. I spotted him. Was that Bruce? It looked like him. He had the little scar on the right cheek he had always had. But it did not look like him anymore. I rubbed my eyes in the hope I was just a wee bit doolally from what I had just gone through. It did not help. It was still the same. Bruce was not his usual reddish-orange colour anymore. He changed colours! It couldn’t be… The fur was now a golden-white pure-like colour. Was he ill? Why was there such a sudden change in his fur? Is it my vision? No, Ginger looked as perfect as always, it was Bruce who had changed. I was completely unable to believe my eyes and opted to ask someone. There was a Zoo worker nearby. I approached the young lad and asked if Bruce had an illness, a problem and/or a change of fur. The caretaker coldly assured me that there wasn’t anything wrong with him, that there had been no change at all. That was a colossal lie, I was sure Bruce was off. It couldn’t be. Before I could elongate the conversation, the guy disappeared, leaving me alone, again. 

My eyes astounded by the disaster, my heart sunken into the depths of confusion, I stood there like an old oak log, hollow inside. The Bruce I knew was gone. Now lay a golden-furred red panda-like animal.

Why has Bruce been taken away from me? I kept on asking myself repeatedly. My soul screamed and screeched with my heart ablaze. I could not control my feelings anymore. It felt as if my body was being dragged into a dark abysm of delusion and doom. Every second I fell, fell and kept falling, falling from reality.

# ***

Within the fog of confusion appeared an image. Spawned from nothingness and part of it, deep guarded in me, lay a deceased vision. Light, almost orange beams of light glimmered from the window, struck with the smell of sandalwood and primaveral breeze, rested before me, a remnant, wrapped in white sheets, motionless like a statue. My young hands were trembling non-stop. I discovered an object in my right hand, I held it with a tight grip, it was a photograph, all wrinkled from the firm grasp I held it with. 

I gazed at the picture, old and decoloured, the picture had been too long in the sun and had sun exposure damage, leaving only a red and white colour palette. Trying to recognize the shapes and attribute them to objects I stared at the shot. It was a red panda, a golden one, just like the new Bruce. There was nothing else to recognise in the picture, the rest were blurry, shallow, insignificant shapes. I turned the shrivelled picture over and saw an inscription, as I tried to read it, everything started to deform, to vanish, the fog returned and the clarity evaporated.

My watery eyes stumbled upon nothingness. I was hovering over the oblivion of reality, it was the past. I levitated in a vast obscure void, I tried to recognise myself by looking at my old, dry, shrivelled hands. Grasping onto the little reality left in me, I tried to return to where I thought I belonged. I have been forced to open a casket to be left locked for eternity. I started the journey back, swimming through the immaterial ocean. I looked at my right hand again and observed how the second I put my eyes on it, it started to deform, to melt into nullity, losing myself, my being and soul, my me. 

I deliquesced and restituted…

# ***

Cell by cell, piece by piece, I returned. The static-like sensation on the tip of my fingers and toes slowly brought me back to my senses. Blinking repeatedly to refocus my vision I identified where I found myself. I looked at my feet, my black leather shoes were grubby and daub and before them were darker spots in the dirt, drops of liquid had fallen on the floor. My eyes were the provenance of such fluid. Tears ran down my face, soaked my shirt, mixed with sweat and continued to drop onto the dirt I stood on. My lips quivered with an almost rhythmic frequency.

The effort to move my limbs was tremendous, I was weighed down, disoriented and teared up. Taking a deep breath I hoarded every bit of energy I held within me and followed the only instinct that levitated in my groggy mind. Flee. I needed to go, I needed to flee, to get away from Bruce, from the disaster, to sleep and forget, to neglect and disregard the prior incident. 

Painfully and tediously I turned around, without saying goodbye to my dear friends. I started erratically and hastily walking home. Step after step I dragged one leg after the other pushing myself over the edge. My surroundings were murky, I could not see anything but what lay in front of me, I had lost my peripheral view. In massive confusion, I walked the routinary return, without thought or clarity. I walked, walked and walked. I reached the gate or it reached me, unable to distinguish the difference between both occurrences, out of breath I needed to keep fleeing. I want to go home. In the absence of sound or words, I left the zoo. Voices sounded muffled, mine emitted no sound. I focused on getting home. 

After scurrying for a few minutes on Corstorphine High Road, I turned left, got to Kirk Loan and kept moving. I observed moving shapes of humanoid form, nonetheless, I was incapable of recognising any of them. Sounds were muted, I was out of balance. The, yet secondary, worry of not returning to my-self lingered in the back of my head. Finally, I read the black-on-white street sign with ‘Corstorphine Rd’ inscribed and turned. Almost there, little effort left, though no energy remained. Dying for a break I decided against it, I needed to keep going, that I knew. I somehow managed to keep the pace. I distinguished home from a small distance. Even though I recognised that there weren't many metres left, it still felt like an unreachable distance, an eternal span left to traverse.

Sweat and tears kept running down my face, I was as soaked as drained. My limbs were freezing and my joints felt as if they had sand in them, perhaps they did, no wonder after today…

I opened the little patio door leading to the entrance of home. Home still looked an eternity away from me. I kept going. Reaching the door, I searched for the keys in my left pocket, all stimuli felt alien. I took the keys out of my pocket, tried introducing them in the keyhole, and repeatedly failed. The trembling of my hands restricted this simple activity. After repeated attempts, I succeeded. With all my strength, I pulled the door, rotated the key and unlocked it.

I made it. I returned. I fled.

# ***

I entered, walked over to the sofa, sat and collapsed.

Drenched in sweat I woke up. I had no idea how much time had passed since I collapsed on the sofa. Time wasn’t a straight thread anymore, it was tangled and knotted with no end or start. The thought struck me that it might have always been like that as it did not feel unnatural.

I guessed at least a day had passed because the morning sun was shining on my face, blinding me. My stomach cried for sustenance but my appetite had been turned off like a button. I decided to try to go for a shower. I tried to stand using both hands on each armrest to push myself out of the quicksand-like sofa. While trying I glanced at my right hand and discovered a dark mark on my palm. I sat again to look at it closely. My hand had taken a dark grey necrosed-like tone but felt, as usual, aching from arthritis but that was distant from abnormal. It was a mark, the rest felt completely normal. I pondered if the mark was only dirt and hoped it was, I had no recollection of what happened after I collapsed. Have I been sleeping so long or have I just forgotten what I have been doing? The thought made me shiver.

I managed to stand up. My body was decompensated and wiggly, everything moved as if I were on a ship and felt seasick as if I were on a ship, there was no ship though, I was home and confounded. In the bathroom, I undressed and got into the warm water. The water caressed my body and helped me regain warmth and vitality. With the loofah in my left hand, I scrubbed and scrubbed my right palm, the mark did not change a bit, it stayed greyish-black and repulsive.

The dark mark should have worried me. Nevertheless, I did not care at all. If it did not ache or bring difficulties, I had no reason to bother. I would let it be and see what happens. The thing that disturbed me though was, Why? Everything I could not explain I attributed to old age, and so I did with this.

After getting fresh clothes on I strolled to the kitchen to make coffee. I still had no appetite whatsoever. I felt a hole in my stomach, I did not know when my last meal had been and did not intend to change it. Without appetite, I wouldn’t eat, even if my body was asking for it. I did not want to any more, only if my mind did. 

The water boiled, the coffee was ground, the filter prepared. I cleaned the filter with the boiling water, drained it and made a flat bed with the coffee grounds in the filter. I then poured water in a circular motion and kept pouring until I reached the 250g mark where I stopped and let it drain. I slightly shook the brewer to flatten the bed and waited a few minutes for the coffee to steep and filter. 

The coffee was ready and I smelled it everywhere. The sharp smell relaxed me and helped me get back to my routine. I cleaned the brewer and put it to dry. After fetching the cup, I returned to the sofa, sat and savoured. 

# ***

The coffee cooled down, the heat got transferred to my hands, thus they ached less now. I savoured the coffee and concentrated only on tasting the notes and delighting in the aroma and complexity of the cup. The Colombian light roast brought me back to my senses. I felt slightly more connected again. 

Salmon. I haven’t seen him. I forgot about him again. Salmon was nowhere to be found. Completely gone without a trace or hint. Cat was not allowed to go outside, it had always been a house cat. All windows were closed. The flat was too small to miss him so I concluded that Salmon disappeared. Downright gone.

Cat wouldn’t manage on his own, too old and decrepit for the risks of the outside world, to hunt and survive was impossible for that saggy bag of bones and fur. I did not feel a bit sorry for him. If he escaped, his problem, how he did it is the question. In the end, it doesn’t matter. The disgrace of leaving did not cause a feeling whatsoever. I was not saddened nor angered by the disappearance of Salmon. Things don’t disappear into thin air so I had no reason to bother, he would die anyway sooner or later.

I gulped the last tad of coffee, set it aside and breathed as deeply as I could. As a reaction came a set of pacifying sighs and deep breaths, almost melodic. The melody reminded me of ‘My Little Brown Book’ by Duke Ellington & John Coltrane, my favourite Album. Music couldn’t damage, so I stood up, walked over to my music table and searched for the Duke Ellington and John Coltrane's album from 1963. After I found it I prepared the antique turntable, unpacked the vinyl from the black cover with coloured letters and steadily and carefully set the disc in the player. I located the needle at the start of the album and let it play. The squeak of the first second pierced my ears, whereas the tones following calmed them again. I let myself get absorbed by the rhythm.

After retaking my seat, I enjoyed in silence with no thought. I let the music be the vehicle of my soul to travel to other worlds. I was deeply immersed, I felt every tone and gamut, from ‘In A Sentimental Mood’ to ‘The Feeling Of Jazz’, the best of Jazz. The music reminded me of my youth, playing tenor saxophone and improvising melodies, nectar sweet-like echoes. I wandered off and flowed astray, astray from my mind, I only perceived and felt.

# ***

Duke Ellington & John Coltrane had come to an end. I was hit with mere silence. A picture spawned in my mind. The silence represented a vast calm ocean. Regardless of the direction you looked, there was a deep blue straight line on the horizon. Nowhere to go, to see, to discover. Pure tranquillity. A sea of tranquillity. With tranquillity came a sensation of helplessness. Alone. The price for it, loneliness. The lack of company or interaction made up for the best recipe for loneliness.

I had never felt it. I was happy with my solitude. Peace was only to be found within me so it never bothered me. I did not need others to prevail. Now, thinking about this, I felt an unknown but somewhat familiar sentiment. I had no interaction and no company. I felt an anxious well in my chest, an obscure sea of emptiness. Even though it was new, it had a nostalgic touch to it.

The anxiety increased. Looking side to side I discovered no living being in my periphery, I lay in utmost confusion, dizzy from the thoughts and haze. I had lost Bruce, I had lost Salmon, I had lost everything keeping me alive. 

I don’t need anyone to live, I’m good on my own. The others only slow me down and hinder me. However, I felt this hole, this sensation of being alone in the sea of tranquillity had taken a negative turn. The cap had been broken off, the chest opened. I did not want the quiet and tranquil sea anymore. I wanted waves and storms, islands and land.

Was I experiencing loneliness? It couldn’t be. Perchance I was just fogged from the whole prior chaos. Loneliness was not something I felt. Solitude was my strength, not my weakness. I did not need Bruce, I did not need Salmon, I did not need anyone but myself.

Being tired was the reason, I was bewildered. There was no way for me to be feeling this. I denied the possibility of any reality in this. It had been too much in the last stretch. It was the confusion, the chaos.

I embraced the sea of tranquillity, or at least tried to. Flowing away I was slapped with somnolence, let it carry me and fell asleep. I fell into the well of my inner self. A lake of darkness surrounded every inch of my being. I couldn’t see my limbs, there was no light to guide me. I was anxious, stressed, has no idea where to go, or what to do. I was on my own, as always, yet now obligatory. There was nothing to do but to take, to receive. I levitated in darkness, absorbed it and let myself be absorbed. I was one with the well, the sensation of loneliness only grew. There was nothing to be done now, it was too late, I was too late.

I dozed off.

# ***

I opened my eyes.

Perhaps I’m lonely. The bullet of acceptance penetrated my chest and made my persona bleed out.

My eyes burned from the light blasting my eyes unaccustomed to the rays after coming from my dark subconscious voyage. After blinking to temper my vision I realised how lonely I was. After … I had never had anyone. I had isolated myself from everything. I found false refuge in my being. The closest thing to a friend was the decrepit mush that disappeared. Now I was certain, it had escaped, not disappeared, things don’t just evanesce. All a curtain, reality lay behind and I was having the first real glance at it. 

The room was empty, as was the well in my chest.  With nothing to do, I sat and stared into nothingness. I had no appetite, I had no fatigue, I had no one. 

With nothing to do and feeling lonely, I decided to go for a walk and look for Salmon. After all, he was the only companion left. Even though the cat might be dead already I was not playing dice anymore with his status. 

I stood up and looked outside, it was getting dark, I had little time left but had already made up my mind, I’ll look until I find him. As I was walking over to the coat stand to grab a puffy jacket for the cold, I glanced at my right hand and realized the mark had got darker and had spread. It somehow left me unbothered, I had another goal in mind, a priority and the only one that I would concentrate on now. 

Thinking like Salmon I decided to go a the nearby woods, to try and find him. I had discovered him there as a kitten an eternity ago, so it felt only natural to look there first. In the end, everything goes back to its place, what goes up must come down.

The door squeaked as I opened it, a chilly breeze slapped my face, the temperature significantly dropped. The sun was going down and the moon was peaking from the horizon. I stepped outside, checked my pocket for the keys, found them and closed the door behind me. A loud blow made me flinch, unable to distinguish the provenance I ignored it and started striding to the woods. 

# ***

It was pitch dark, I had been walking for some time and hadn’t arrived yet, maybe I had walked the wrong way, but it didn’t matter anyway. My feet were starting to freeze, the motion kept them warm enough to survive. 

Without even realising I got to the forest, it practically spawned before my eyes. I hoped it was *the* forest, I felt it was, even if there was no way to know. There were odd noises, little light and the continuous roar of the wind. I was frightened by the uncertainty of my destiny. As much as I tried not to care I was unvictorious. 

The only way to feel free is to know you might not always be in that state. Thesis and antithesis made reality. If humans weren’t frightful they would be immortal and omnipotent. Fear made human beings mortal. I was feeling fear. Again, an unfelt emotion being suddenly felt. The confusion was not as big as last time, I started recognising a pattern. 

The chest open, the chains broken, the mask broke, fear freed me. I was free. This hypocritically scared me even more. I did not know how to live now, how to act now. The line between real and fictitious was narrow. So narrow I lost the ability to distinguish it, now came the time to do it, to try to accept.

Too much, way too much. Everything was happening too quickly, too snappy. The confusion grew again, I took hold of a tree on my right side to keep the balance. I was on the verge of collapsing again, my vision fainted and whirled, I felt the droplet of cold sweat run down my back, my limbs grew weaker and lighter, I was losing control, again.

Before passing away I concentrated on my right hand, in touch with the tree. I focused on the sensation, on the touch. The wet bark of the tree, covered with a thin film of moss, wetted my wizened hand. The mixture of crust and moss made for a hard yet mushy texture with a moist but dirty consistency. I kept on breathing deeply and feeling, sensing, perceiving. 

It calmed me. Gradually, the sensation of another collapse was leaving my body. All I felt was the tree, and the tree felt me. I looked at my right hand, connected with the tree, and even with the very little light showing me the way, I could recognise the mark on my hand getting darker and spreading further. My hand was completely covered now, and it had become ash black. Too late to fight, I took it in and kept going on my mission.

I emitted no sound and no light. I hoped that if Salmon heard my steps, he would just come to me, and we could go back home. That way, I knew that he explicitly wanted to return from the other world. I walked, walked, and walked, embracing the newly acquired freedom and my nature.

# ***

I discovered blinking lights from a distance. I approached them and stumbled upon a meadow, no trees and no moss anymore. Amidst the woods resided a meadow of short extension.

Greenery, fresh grass and flowers. The blinking lights were fireflies, filling the air as pollen in spring. The scene made me shed a few tears. I was staggered by the beauty before my eyes. The fireflies danced over the turf, the song of nature played, I cried, I felt everything. The beauty was mesmerising, it filled me up.

I decided to lay on the meadow, a pause in such a beautiful spectacle was only deserved after searching for what felt like days. I took air into my lungs, I felt refreshed and purified.

The time had come for me to open my eyes. I had been negating my identity to myself, lying to no one but myself, harming no one but myself. I have been coping with negation, negating my being, my past, my self. The preparations have been done and shown to me, the curtain from reality has been holed to a point where the curtain has no utility, the curtain must thus be removed. 

My mission was never finding Salmon, but myself. Now, it was time to reach the goal, to take the step, the thought made me tremble, too late to back out now.

I opened my eyes.

I was free, free from the chains I had put myself to avoid being what I was, what I am and will ever be, a human. The time came for me to embrace my humanity and the absurdity that came with it. To feel other beings and be felt, to sob and laugh, to feel fear and freedom, to be mortal, ignorant, fragile. That is a human. A member of a group, part of the synergy. A delicate beauty laid above the identity, a responsibility.

Tons of weight disappeared from my shoulders, I breathed new air, saw new light, felt new sensations. The weight has been lifted off my shoulders. 

I lay on the grass, submerged in nature, a system, one with everything, I was connected. I was hit with a breeze of drowsiness, my muscles relaxed, my vision defocused. My eyes could only see blurry speckles of light emitted from the fireflies. I was in a state of purity. My eyes wanted to close again. I tried to fight against it, to enjoy the landscape, to enjoy my new vision and senses. A candle of warmth lighted up in my well. The well was not pitch dark anymore, there was light, hope, opportunity. I could not fight it back, my eyes started shutting, I had no strength left.

I’ve been pushed out of retirement by a coffee shop that asked for some help. The first thing I’ve noticed is that they have beans that look to be a medium to medium-dark roast for espresso but some of the beans are wet with oil. I’ve never encountered this before so I wanted to come here to ask for some feedback. As for the shots themselves, they have good color and decent taste but they are bubbling out of the legs of the portafilter. I asked them to let the coffee sit for about 5-7 days before using it but it still seems to be an issue. They were essentially burning the beans before so this is all very new to them.

1ixurkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticdiscussions/comments/1ixurkw/what_would_a_liberal_tea_party_look_like/,What Would a Liberal Tea Party Look Like?,"A new president has taken office, elected in response to widespread economic dissatisfaction. Now he’s trying to make big changes to the government, and some voters are upset. They’re angry at the president’s party for backing the changes, and they’re angry at the opposition party for not doing more to stop it.

That’s a fitting description of what’s going on now, but I was thinking of 2009, when the Tea Party movement erupted amid Barack Obama’s attempt to pass major health-care reform. Over the past week, some signs have emerged of a shift in the national mood that feels similar to what the country experienced back then. As the effects of Elon Musk’s rampage through the federal government are starting to be felt, some people are getting angry. Trump’s net approval rating is slipping slightly. Americans are upset that he’s not doing more to fight inflation. A small number of Republican elected officials are timidly voicing their concerns about certain Trump moves. And at town halls across the country, members of Congress are getting earfuls.

“How can you tell me that DOGE, with some college whiz kids from a computer terminal in Washington, D.C., without even getting into the field, after about a week or maybe two, have determined that it’s OK to cut veterans’ benefits?” a man who described himself as a Republican and an Army veteran asked Representative Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma.

“Why is the supposedly conservative party taking such a radical and extremist and sloppy approach to this?” a man asked Representative Rich McCormick of Georgia. (He’s the congressman who recently suggested that students should work to earn school lunches.)

“The executive can only enforce laws passed by Congress; they cannot make laws,” a lawyer from Huntsville, Texas, chided Representative Pete Sessions. “When are you going to wrest control back from the executive and stop hurting your constituents?”

All three of these districts are strongly Republican, but Republicans aren’t the only ones taking flak. Democratic voters’ frustration with their party’s leaders, who are widely seen as either flat-footed or acquiescent, is growing. At a town hall in New York, a man told Democratic Representative Paul Tonko that he was happy to see him demonstrating outside the Department of Education, but he wanted more. “I thought about Jimmy Carter and I thought about John Lewis, and I know what John Lewis would have done. He would have gotten arrested that day,” the man said. “Make them outlaw you. We will stand behind you; we will be there with you. I will get arrested with you.”

For anyone who was paying attention during the rise of the Tea Party, the echoes are unmistakable, although the screen resolution on cellphone videos of these encounters has improved in the past 16 years. With Democrats out of the White House and the minority in the House and Senate (and with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court), many on the left have been wallowing in despair. Now some are seeing signs of hope. The Tea Party helped Republicans gain six seats in the Senate and 63 seats in the House in the 2010 election. It changed the trajectory of Obama’s presidency, launched the careers of current GOP stars including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and paved the way for Donald Trump.

If this is progressives’ 2009 moment, though, what would a Tea Party of the left look like? Simply attempting to create an inverse of the original Tea Party seems to me like a fairly obvious loser—no one wants a cheap dupe. In 2010, liberal activists formed something they called the “Coffee Party USA.” That got plenty of press attention but didn’t have nearly the impact (or organic reach) of the Tea Party.

To recover their mojo, Democrats need some sort of organizing principle, real or purported. The Tea Party claimed to be concerned with fiscal discipline and limited government—activists organized around the Affordable Care Act. In retrospect, that premise is hard to take at face value. Many Tea Party supporters and prominent politicians ended up being Trump supporters, even though he blew up the national deficit and has made dubious promises not to cut social-insurance programs. (More interesting are figures such as Senator Rand Paul, an early Tea Party star who continues to sometimes clash with Trump on topics including foreign policy, spending, and intelligence.) What connects the Tea Party and Trump is racial backlash to Obama, the first Black president. Polls and studies found a connection between Tea Party support and racial-status anxiety, resentment, and prejudice.

One challenge of creating a liberal version of the Tea Party is that what liberals want right now is so basic. The opposite of what Trump has done in his first month in office is good governance—careful, measured administration. But that doesn’t make a good bumper sticker, and it doesn’t inspire crowds.

Representative Jake Auchincloss, a Massachusetts Democrat, has warned against Democrats trying to offer voters a “Diet Coke” version of Trumpian populism. “Voters who ordered a Coca-Cola don’t want a Diet Coke,” he told the New York Times columnist Ezra Klein recently. “There are two different parties. We have to start by understanding who our voters are not and then understanding who our voters could be—and go and try to win them over. If you’re walking to the polls and your No. 1 issue is guns, immigration, or trans participation in sports, you’re probably not going to be a Democratic voter.” Auchincloss said Democrats need to focus instead on voters who are worried about the cost of living.

One possible rallying point for progressives is Elon Musk. Unlike Trump, he has no voter constituency, and polls show that he’s unpopular. Watching the world’s richest man sack park rangers, firefighters, and veterans in the name of bureaucratic efficiency is ripe for political messaging. Anecdotal evidence from town halls suggests widespread anger at Musk. But there are risks to homing in on Musk. Democrats’ attempts to paint Trump as a plutocrat haven’t done much to blunt his populist appeal. Besides, if Musk gets bored or Trump tires of him and pushes him out, the movement will have lost its focal point.

Another option is a revitalization of the anti-Trump resistance that defeated the president in 2020 and led to poor Republican performance in 2018 and 2022. Trump won the 2024 election not so much because the resistance failed but because it dissolved amid frustration with Joe Biden. Key constituencies—suburban white women, Latino voters—that moved toward Trump in the most recent election might turn back against him if they’re reminded of his flaws. Then again, voters who are disgusted with the Democratic Party aren’t guaranteed to return simply because they’re also disgusted with Trump.

Their is always somebody sleeping in the class. 

But why not have a window? 🤔  let's some fresh air in or have some natural light.  Instead it's a stuffy room with stale air with the heat higher then it should be at all.  Sometimes, it's an auditorium style classroom or just overcrowded.  

So you have everyone's body heat making the stuffy stale air room even hotter.  In fact, the room felt like an oversized closet.  a classroom of people breathing in each other's carbon dioxide.  Their was one class that always knocked me out cold.  But I wasn't even tired I just hate being in that classroom.  I remember one class just gave me a headache and all I wanted to do was nap.

1ixub9z,https://v.redd.it/xj7sym0s8ale1,How do I identify the right mentors & sponsors for my career?,"Finding the right mentors and sponsors is a pivotal step in advancing your career, no matter your industry or career stage. Not all mentors are alike. While mentors provide guidance, wisdom, and encouragement, sponsors actively advocate for you in rooms you're not yet in.

To identify the right people who can help you grow, you need clarity on your goals, career stage, and the type of support you require. Let’s break this down so you can take actionable steps toward building a robust professional support network.

Mentor vs. Sponsor: What’s the Difference?
Before diving in, let’s clarify two commonly confused roles: mentors and sponsors.

Mentor: The Trusted Advisor
A mentor is someone who shares their expertise, offers advice, and helps you navigate challenges in your career. Think of them as a sounding board, career GPS, and cheerleader rolled into one. Mentors often focus on long-term professional growth and skill-building.

Sponsor: The Career Advocate
A sponsor, on the other hand, is a high-ranking ally who leverages their influence to open doors for you. They don’t just talk about your potential—they act on it by recommending you for key projects, promotions, and opportunities.

Key Difference:
📌 Mentors guide you; sponsors champion you. Both are invaluable, but knowing when you need one over the other (or both) is crucial for career success.

How to Identify the Right Mentors and Sponsors
1. Assess Your Career Stage and Needs
Your career stage will largely determine what kind of support you need:

Early Career (0–5 years): Focus on finding mentors who can help you build foundational skills, navigate corporate culture, and develop a long-term vision.
Mid-Career (5–15 years): At this stage, you likely need sponsors who can help elevate your visibility and position you for leadership roles.
Senior Career (15+ years): Look for sponsors who can help you make bold career moves and mentors who can guide you through legacy-building and transitions (e.g., into consulting, entrepreneurship, or retirement).

2. Define What You’re Looking For
Take time to clarify your goals and the type of guidance you need. Ask yourself:

✅ What skills do I need to develop?
✅ Do I need advice on strategy or execution?
✅ Am I seeking help with visibility, leadership, or networking?

📌 Pro Tip: Create a ""mentor profile."" Write down the attributes, expertise, or connections your ideal mentor or sponsor would have. This helps you approach the right people instead of aimlessly networking.

3. Start Within Your Network
Your best mentors and sponsors might already be in your circle:

Former bosses, professors, colleagues, or industry peers.
Networking events, conferences, or professional associations (gold mines for finding the right people).
Virtual communities like LinkedIn groups or niche forums in your industry.

📌 Remember: It’s not just about finding someone senior—it’s about finding someone relevant to your career goals.

4. Look for Alignment and Accessibility
A strong mentor or sponsor should:
✔ Share values and goals that resonate with you.
✔ Have expertise in your desired area of growth.
✔ Be accessible and genuinely interested in your success.

💡 Quality over quantity: One impactful conversation with the right person is worth more than months of surface-level check-ins.

How to Build a Strong Mentor-Sponsor Relationship
1. Reach Out Thoughtfully
Approach potential mentors and sponsors with a clear and respectful ask. Be specific about why you’re reaching out and what you admire about their career.

Mentor Ask:
""I’m at a point in my career where I’m working on [X skill], and I admire how you’ve done [Y]. Would you be open to a 30-minute coffee chat?""
Sponsor Ask:
""I’ve been building [specific expertise], and I’d love your advice on how to position myself for [specific opportunity]. If you believe in my work, I’d appreciate your sponsorship for opportunities aligned with my skills.""

2. Provide Value in Return
It’s a two-way street! Mentors and sponsors support you—but how can you support them?

✅ Share useful industry insights.
✅ Be a reliable contributor to projects.
✅ Express genuine gratitude.

3. Be Intentional, Not Overbearing
✔ Respect their time—don’t expect weekly meetings.
✔ Keep them updated on your progress (it helps them stay invested in your journey).
✔ Focus on relationship-building, not just career advancement.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
🚫 Choosing Based on Title Alone – A person’s job title doesn’t automatically make them the right fit. Prioritize alignment over seniority.

🚫 Not Diversifying Your Support Network – Don’t rely on just one mentor or sponsor. Multiple perspectives help you grow faster.

🚫 Neglecting the Relationship – A great mentor or sponsor isn’t just a one-time connection. Check in, show appreciation, and nurture the relationship over time.

The Long-Term Impact of Mentors and Sponsors
The right mentors and sponsors can help you:
✔ Gain clarity on your professional goals.
✔ Navigate challenges and transitions in your career.
✔ Unlock opportunities you wouldn’t have access to on your own.

📌 Did You Know? A Harvard Business Review study found that employees with sponsors are 23% more likely to be promoted than those without one.

Building these relationships takes time, but the investment pays off exponentially.

Final Thoughts: Build Your Personal Board of Directors
Think of your mentors and sponsors as your personal ""board of directors."" Each person brings a unique perspective to help you grow. Diversify your support system by including:

✔ A mentor within your organization.
✔ An external mentor in your industry.
✔ A sponsor who’s a senior advocate for your career.

1ixuan1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ixuan1/25_to_life/,25 to life 🌺,"I kept waking up to the rich aroma of coffee, momentarily forgetting that I had done my weekly coffee body scrub the night before. Each time the scent stirred me from sleep, I smiled, remembering my shower. Instinctively, my hands would glide over my skin, savoring how incredibly smooth and soft it felt. There was something comforting about it, a small but intimate reminder of the care I give myself, wrapped in the warmth of a fragrance that lingered through the night.

This last time, I woke up because of a weird dream, one I know I need to write down. I just hope that whoever needs to read it will understand its significance and do what they must with the information being shared, acting accordingly.

I was sitting alone in a charming coffee shop in Paris, surrounded by the intoxicating aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the scent of warm, freshly baked bread. The black iron Victorian-style table and matching chairs gave the place a vintage elegance, yet I was lost in my thoughts, replaying the past two years like a perfectly narrated story. My mind meticulously sorted through the trials, the testimonies, and the carefully orchestrated schemes, every plan, every move, every witness.

I was pulled from my trance when the waitress gently placed a small cup of coffee in front of me and asked a question. I blinked, adjusting to the present moment, and politely responded, ""I'm sorry, I don’t speak French."" She tilted her head, asking, ""American?""

I shook my head. “No.” Then, switching to Spanish, I told her I was from Central America. Her face lit up with a warm smile. “Perfecto,” she said.

Before she could leave, I hesitated for a moment, then asked if it wouldn’t be too much trouble to bring me the same bread I had seen another customer enjoying. She nodded kindly, assuring me, “In a moment, I’ll bring it to you.”

My mind drifted back to the trial, to how every moment was broadcasted on national television. Faces were plastered across screens for the world to see and remember. I never cared if mine was among them, I never saw myself as a victim. I am a survivor, because God was guiding my every step, leading me through the storm.

I didn’t leave the country because of the trial’s outcome. I left for my children’s well-being. It had become too much for them, to witness, to learn, to acknowledge what their mother had endured. They had to see me sit there, forced to relive every scene, to watch every single video, to come face-to-face with every person who took part in the plan to use me and erase me.

Every sip of coffee, every breath I take after that trial, is another reason to give thanks and glory to the Almighty Lord! Because He never forgot me, not for a single moment.

And yet, as much as I love some individuals among those who were sentenced, and though I wish them no harm, a cold shiver runs down my spine. A strange sorrow washes over me, bringing tears to my eyes, not for myself, but for their downfall. They did everything in their power to destroy me, my family, my children. They spent years orchestrating my demise. And still, I sit here, breathing, living, because God had other plans.

1ixuamp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ciastkocukier/comments/1ixuamp/start_dieting_part_16/,Start dieting part 16,"It's been a little longer since my last post. I feel like consistently taking longer to write a new post every month. Frankly, the reason for that is because i'm not feeling the urgency towards it anymore. Bad breath's become  smaller blimp on my radar and my life seems to be moving forward. I got a nice job offer, I'm finishing my master's degree, I moved to a new apartment etc. 

Anyways, Today I am completing 7 weeks since I returned to the diet. For the new people, its the second (or third) time i'm attempting the diet. The second time was last autumn semester. I did it for a total of 8 weeks and had amazing progress. However, it wasn't 100% yet. When I stopped dieting, I went on a trip and returned to  normal diet. When I returned to a normal diet, my breath went completely away, and the reason for that is because sugar eating bacteria completely took over the mouth. Which gives caries and plaque, but its much more preferable than bad breath frankly.

What I've learned recently is that there are different kinds of bad breath fueled by different compounds. In the oral microbiome there are sulphur bacteria, nitrogen bacteria and ammonia bacteria. As well as sugar eating bacteria and healthy fiber eating bacteria, but these dont produce bad breath.

The worst of them all and the one i struggled most with was sulphur eating bacteria. It produces a strong foul smell, similar to rotten eggs or rotten cabbage. This kind of bacteria is the most resilient, it thrives and a wide range of ph, it feeds on most foods, and it adapts to a wide variety of scenarios. An easy way to find out if you have this kind of bacteria, is to lick your wrist. If the saliva feels warm, its likely sulphur bacteria that took over. Healthy saliva should be neutral or even cool in temperature.

The second kind of bad breath bacteria is the nitrogen eating bacteria. This is your poop smell. It alone is not as strong as sulphur bacteria. This kind of bacteria struggles to create its own biofilm, therefore, a simple sugar cutting diet is enough to weaken it a lot. It alone, doesnt produce far reaching smell, its usually combined with sulphur VSC's that it causes the room filling breath. This kind of bacteria is also weak to ph changes when exposed outside of biofilms

The third type is the newest for me. Ammonia eating bacteria. Ammonia is usually not associated with bad breath. Generally, it thrives in very high ph and causes gum infections and bleeding. However, ammonia bacteria can cause bad breath and it has a very particular smell. It's not as offensive as sulphur or poop smells, however, its far reaching.

In the past two or three weeks, I completely switched my protein intake from salmon to vegan protein powder from peas. It was a game changer. The salmon was fueling the sulphur bacteria and it was taking a while for good bacteria to gain dominance. When I switched proteins, my body went completely sulphur limited and other types of bacteria, being good, ammonia and nitrogen, started competing for space. At first, the poop smelling bacteria took over. Then during the day good bacteria would take over by flushing with saliva and drinking water. 

However, in the past week, I was moving apartments and exercising a lot. What happened is that my protein intake was too low. I was taking about half the protein mount I should be taking a day. That together with heavy exercise, caused my body to start breaking down its own muscles to fuel the body. It led to a sharp increase in ammonia bacteria. 

At the current moment, completing 3 weeks. I am dealing with a fight for dominance between good, nitrogen and ammonia bacteria. My oral microbiome is incredibly volatile and subject to external change. Its very difficult to find a balance. I wake up in the morning with poop breath. Brush my teeth, it goes away for a while. Then ammonia bacteria take over during the day. I drink coffee to lower mouth ph, the ammonia bacteria goes away but I get coffee breath. I brush my teeth and it goes back to no smell etc. 

What I am doing is increasing my intake of protein to 40g a day, which is the amount it should be for my weight. I am also introducing a plethora of healthy bacteria supportive things. Like different kinds of prebiotics, chicorry root, acacia fiber etc. I am including different kinds of polyphenols like 100% cocoa, cranberry extract, pomegranate extract. I am including beetroot powder for nitrogen reduction and etc. We'll see how it goes, I'll write an update next month.",1,1740488063.0,u_ciastkocukier,0,1.0,False

Backstory: my roomate moved in around 7 months ago, we get on fine (still do, as long as I put my foot down) they are organised, mostly clean even though they are annoying with some things which I don't understand. Their parents pay their rent so I'm assuming it's a entitlement issue.

Recently they lost their job which means they've been spending a *lot* of time at home. When I come home from work I'm often greeted with half eaten sandwiches on a plate or the kitchen is just a bit untidy, not the end of the world, I just thought considering they don't have a job they have time to tidy up but nothing major.

A week or so later they took the bin out but left the bin without a liner, I had to leave for work quickly so didn't do it myself but when I came home 7 hours later, they still hadnt put one in the bin. 

The last straw: I was again off to work, I had made a coffee and wanted to scroll on my phone for half hour before showering etc. they came into the kitchen, pointed out *their* dishes and said can you clean those? In my head I was like *why? What exactly are you doing* but I bit my tongue and said no I'm going to work soon.

I don't get it.. they do things like this all the time, ask me to pick up shopping for them, ask me to print things for them at work etc. I have had to start just making up excuses. Considering this person is from a wealthy family.. I just can't believe they think I'm here to clean and use my own money to run errands for them when they are more than capable of doing them, especially unemployed? Wtaf..

 I have been in a relationship with my bf since the past 5 years. I wanted to surprise him by showing up at his apartment. I missed him so much so I thought to just see him and go on with my work.
He asked me why did you come at my apartment without asking me? I just greeted him at the staircase and was about to go. He told me to come to home and drink water as I was tried after walking from my home to his home(took around 20-30mins) I agreed then he proceeds to say that how the society will think bad of him to bring a girl in the absence of his mother.(2 months fast forward he invited me to his home to make out! The Irony) So he asked me to wait till his mom arrives. I was like Oh okay,I will be happy to meet her. His Mom came and she was shook by seeing me but tried her best to not show the disappointment on her face. He told Mom this is the girl I have told you about and she just nodded her Head. Fast forward of silent filled moments, I broke the ice and smiled then She started asking about me ,my family and caste. Meanwhile my Bf was busy on his Computer doing his work. He didn't even participate in the conversation.His mom kept on talking about all other alliances which came for him. Mind you, she didn't tell once. She repeated it THRICE. He initiated the talk by simply telling this is the girl which I told you mom and kept on working on his PC while his mom was grilling me. He didn't even bother to tell his Mom to not to shoo me away indirectly by saying about his alliances. He was quietly working, I was alone while she kept on grilling me more until his sister came and then she tried the best to support me. His Mother was saying all kind of caste racism. She was telling she is a particular Caste and made remarks on how despite of me being a high caste the people of my caste were of particular type(she enacted the act) His mom served me coffee to which he just mentioned that it might be too hot to handle don't drink now and kept on being on his PC.

Later upon confronting that why he didn't speak up for me at his home, he told he didn't want to make his mom feel unsupportive and alone by supporting me. Jaise ladki aayi beta badal gaya vibe nhi aana chahiye. I was vulnerable at his home with no one by my side expect his sister. I went to his apartment to see him. I still curse myself why did I go that day. I felt all alone at his home even with him being in the house. 

If the scenario was reversed, I would have been happily introducing him to my family and wouldn't even let him down/make him feel alone.

Why do men downplay their women in front of his family? 

Another instance was I celebrated his birthday in hotel room, gave him handmade portraits, love letter, tshirts and cake. Upon opening my handmade portraits and love letters, the first question that popped out of his mouth was - Where will I hide this gifts at my home? No appreciation/ no acknowledgement.

I mostly was curious if I am alone  in the few bouts of this that I've had of this so far. I'm currently 30+4 and I've only been to the ER twice for nausea, where it was probably just a stomach bug where stuff was coming up gross (first a little blood, second time black/coffee grounds, both times I was fine after some fluids and a antinausea). 

My pregnancy has been generally smooth so far, my biggest symptom this deep in being the congestion. Last month, I woke to the feeling of something mildly stuck in my throat, so I sip at water and have to cough it-- and a bunch of phlegm-- back up. It took about two hours of that process of sipping water to activate my gag reflex and just get it all out, the mucus feeling like it had reached my stomach yet I never puked my stomach contents, just mucus. By then, I could drink water and eat normally. 

Told my doctor-- got the 'that sucks, make sure to take the sudafed' kind if response. It did help, and I thought I was in the clear with only mild sniffles no matter how much I blow my nose, now. Woke up just this morning with the same sort of feeling, thought I'd sip at water and cough up what I need to cough up and instead that gagging feeling brought some vomit with the initial 'plug' of phlegm. Normal stuff, no bile, no blood of black/coffee grounds, and I  didn't even feel sick to my stomach at all besides once that gate was opened. I got a little puke out and seemed to satisfy what my body needed, cleaned up, sipped water, everything is fine now. 

How normal is this? I don't feel concerned, I can drink fluids and eat, baby is moving normally and feels okay-- no pain or blood or anything. I'm more curious if the casuality of the puke and if the whole phlegm/mucus build up happened to anyone else lol.",1,1740487856.0,BabyBumps,1,1.0,False

Hi everyone, second time poster, long time lurker here. Seeing the there aren't many review of Q Air for pourover, I felt compelled to post a review after a week+ of use.

I have Timemore C2 (v1.5/v2?) that I bought back in 2021. I've had amazing as well as sh\*tty brew with the 'ol reliable, which saw use for grinding 13-20g+ of beans a day for almost everyday. Having said that, I thought that it's high time for me to get a new grinder as lately the cups I got from C2 have harsh bitterness and astringency at my usual setting (16 clicks). After mulled over 6+ months, going back and forth between K Ultra, ZP6 and Kingrinder K6, I finally decided to get Q Air.

""After all those mulling over, why pick the cheapest one that's not even an option in the first place?"" I heard you say. The simple answer is: Sh\*t hit the fan and now I lost most of my money but the crave for liquid gold is real and new Q is more than 2x the price of Q Air. Hence, I present to you my review of Q Air.

* **Build**

Being mostly made out of PC plastic, the feel of Q Air in my hand is surprisingly nice. Yes, it doesn't inspire any confidence at all durability wise, especially when C2s/C3s which can be had for less is made out of solid aluminium. But as long as it's being handled normally without excessive banging or unfortunate fall from tabletop, I think it will hold up quite nicely. Here's hoping there will be cheap aftermarket aluminium barrel + catch cup replacement parts for Q Air offered on Ali.

The burr precalibration on my Q Air is quite respectable if I might say. The adjustment dial maxed out (cannot be hand-tightened/dialed to fine further) at 1 click before 0 and burr touch is at 0.1.0 (1 number = 3 clicks). As for C2, it has no number so all I can say is the burr touch is at 2 clicks from max.

* **UI/UX**

Setting the grind size with the dial on Q Air is quite comparable to C2 as both of them are on the bottom. With the additional click between numbers, dialing in grindsize for pourover can be done more accurately (although it may has a smaller impact than I think it would be).

Grinding with Q Air is surprisingly easy, despite its relatively smaller diameter and same length of crank compared to C2. Just like the knurl texture on C2's body, the faceted surface of Q Air's plastic barrel somewhat helps with the grippiness of the body during grinding. The grinding experience is further eased if you tilt the grinder horizontally as Lance suggested in his video about grind uniformity (though I think this might increase the probability of regrinding as the catch cup is relatively small, which I hope I'm wrong).

In fear of stripping the plastic thread on the barrel, I make a habit out of gripping the grinder by the exposed outer aluminium ring part of the burr frame assembly when grinding. Based on 1zpresso's marketing material, the new burr set in new Q/Q Air is supposedly easier to grind with compared to the one in Q2. If grinding medium roast on Q Air is kind of finicky enough, I can only imagine what a workout it would be to grind light roasts in Q2.

Another drawback of using plastic as the main material for the barrel and the catch cup is its proclivity of being an oil magnet. After grinding once, the oil left in the catch cup is quite noticeable. In my humble opinion, this oil slick may carry over to the next batch of beans if not cleaned properly beforehand. Or maybe I'm just being overly cautious, which I hope is the case.

Yet another pain point of plastic body is the static. Noticeably so, especially compared to my alu-bodied C2. Living in a rather humid country kinda does help a little bit with the static situation. I've tried RDT to little to no success in taming the static. Luckily a gentle knock and bellowing with the palm of my hand helps knock clung grounds loose quite a bit, though I do lose 0.1-0.2g of ground beans because of this.

Having used C2 for over 4+ years, I do miss the removable aluminium disk bottom of the C2's catch cup that makes deep cleaning the catch cup easier, which markedly absent from Q Air's molded PC catch cup. On the plus side, the size of the Q Air's barrel is small enough for bulb blower tip to reach deep enough to really clean the burrs.

* **Ground beans uniformity & cup**

Now, onto the meat of this review: How's the uniformity? How does the cup tastes?

The short answer for uniformity: Dang, I never knew my C2 had quite a lot of boulders and fines.

Long answer for uniformity: Using Honest Coffee Guide's [grind size converter chart](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/coffee-grind-size-chart/) as general guideline, I set my Q Air to 1.5.0 to match C2's 16 clicks setting. I used Arahkopirig's Kamojang Honey Anaerob beans for this comparison. The ground I got from Q Air is comparatively much, much more uniform than the one I got from C2. Initially I thought that I ground the beans too finely in the Q Air, but the brew time between those two is (somewhat) close enough for this comparison (3:40 on C2, 2:59 on Q Air. Yes, I know it's not even close. Yes, I plan to compare the C2 with 1.4.0 setting on my Q Air to match the brew time later on).

The short answer for cup taste: Q Air is the answer to the gripes that I have for my C2. Quite a drop in body, but quite massive gain in clarity and nudge of more acidity.

Long answer for cup taste: The clarity I got from Q Air really highlights the notes that the roaster put forth. This quality is really highlighted if you're using the right water for the right beans. Maybe because the body and the bitterness is reduced quite fairly compared to the cup I got from C2 so that the notes can step forward in turn, or maybe not. I'd really love to hear your opinion on this.

One thing that jumps out from my quick cupping session is taste notes in the cup from Q Air will change quickly as the cup cools down. It felt muted as time goes on, dare I say. As for the cup from C2, it comes with harsh bitterness & astringency that persists even when it's cold.

* **Outro**

Most medical sources advise it be taken on an empty stomach since food will delay the Tmax (max concentration of drug in the body) by an hour: 3.8hrs to 4.7hr. Others say that food has no effect. I also read that it takes between 1-2hrs, since Vyvanse has to metabolize first, to start feeling the therapeutic effects.

On forums I've read opinions on both ends and everything in between. Which makes sense since everyone is different and medication effects depend upon those factors.

But, in your opinion; how does food effect - if at all - your med? I take 60mgs, first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach. I do have two cups of coffee, and I've read that some people experience unpleasant side effects from that comb, but not in my case. It does numb my appetite so I may have a few snacks throughout the day but typically I don't eat a full meal until early evening. I know that by evening a good amount of the drug has been eliminated but food seems to noticeably dull the effects.  The only thing I did was eat so I started to correlate the two. Maybe it's psychosomatic?

Does anyone else notice any effects of food in relation to their med?

Since a bunch of drinks are about to be discontinued, it would be helpful for us customers to understand how to make YOUR lives easier by knowing what words to say for the drinks that will be discontinued.

For example, I myself order the Double Chocolate Chip frap - what words can I say to a barista that starts with the recommended vanilla bean frap and ends in a coffee-less Double Chocolate Chop frap [ideally without vanilla flavor but I can cope if I must].

Please include other drinks as well for other customers.

And customers: if you are upset about the change, call corporate, let them know! This change seems like it will be hard on the baristas from what I'm seeing in comments - let's support them by bringing our frustration NOT to the baristas at the stores (they are frustrated too, have patience with them!), but to corporate where our voices can hopefully do more.

1ixtxvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaunchMyStartup/comments/1ixtxvc/did_i_spend_years_of_sweat_and_coffee_just_to/,Did I spend years of sweat and coffee just to fail at my onboarding screen?,"Once upon a time, I had an idea I thought was pretty cool - ""what if I toss my many *disorganised journals* and *confused attempts at organising my life goals* and story and built an app where you can **write on cards!**"". Yeah, like playing cards, or trading cards, I'd collect these cards I write just like Pokemon cards, arrange them into decks, tag them with types, maybe I'd even build some sort of rarity system.

I had visions of this *ultimate card game*, only, the cards were moments from my real life: ideas, memories, experiences, everything.

The idea captured my passion, my time and energy for many years (still does) and I just wanted to build it and talk about it. I'm sure there are a lot of you who can relate to that feeling of passion and excitement you get pouring your soul into a beloved creation of yours.

So my app, [noto.ooo](https://noto.ooo), is built, I'm always tinkering away on it. Naturally, I talk to my friends about it, and then to some not-so-friends, and then occasionally someone I don't know shows interest and I am elated by the chance to share my passion project with them - it's the hardest thing, to hold myself back from going into a full on monologue.

This is where I realised a new passion of mine... *sharing my passion*. I wanted to show my app to others and I wanted it to be **something they loved!** I reflect on all the apps I've loved using and I wanted to create something that inspired that feeling in others.

Sitting on a fully functional app, I'm now faced with two brand new challenges (the scariest of all?):

Marketing & Onboarding. (A duo perhaps more challenging than Ornstein & Smough... Dark Souls anyone?)

Oh man, there is a lot to learn in these spaces, but I thought, you can't start marketing if you don't have some kind of onboarding right?

So I spent a great deal of energy putting together [what I thought was a pretty hot splash screen](https://imgur.com/a/attempts-some-hot-onboarding-bKqxd4O).

* It's light, it's quick, it runs you through the basics
* It has pictures and screenshots of different functions and ""learn more"" buttons for deeper understanding of features and how to use them
* It's directly in the app, so you can get straight into writing with the call to action buttons

To be honest, I was really proud of myself. I had done something that had been haunting me for a while - *summing up the features that make up my app and making them clearly presentable.*

I started putting [noto.ooo](https://noto.ooo) out there, to see if anyone liked it and I got a comment saying that the splash screen was **awful**, continuing to say that it **looked like something out of the 2000's**!

\*gasp\*, I thought to myself, ""Maybe I've missed the mark""

Time to improve then, so I [spun up some new concepts](https://imgur.com/a/attempts-some-hot-onboarding-bKqxd4O) (scroll down) for a more interactive onboarding experience that guides the user through the features naturally, ""showing not telling"".

I feel like I didn't spend years of sweat and coffee just to fail at onboarding... I want to know what you think - **Hot** or *Cold*?

Is my [current onboarding](https://noto.ooo) **awful** and 2000's-esque? How do the [new concepts](https://imgur.com/a/attempts-some-hot-onboarding-bKqxd4O) stack up? Does anyone relate, what have your onboarding struggles and wins been?",1,1740486876.0,LaunchMyStartup,0,0.67,False

“Nestlé, those water thieves! Boycott them!”

“Who's still buying Nesquik in 2025? Seriously.”

“Nestlé = Evil Inc. I will NEVER touch this stock.”

Yet, here we are:

📈 **NESN ""skyrocketed"" from 74 CHF to 88 CHF** in no time.

Meanwhile, behind closed doors:

* Institutional investors keep accumulating.
* Dividend lovers quietly reinvest.
* The stock keeps marching upward, defying sentiment.

It’s a perfect example of **""what people say vs. what actually happens in the market.""**

Small shareholders in a lurch:

“Wait, why is the stock going up?”

“It's the boomers who are buying, that's for sure...”

“It's BlackRock and Vanguard who manipulate everything.”

In the offices of investment funds:

A junior analyst: “Boss, everyone says they hate Nestlé, but our algorithm shows that buying flows are exploding...”

The boss, impassive, sipping a Nespresso coffee: “What else? Remind me again how many shares we bought at 74 CHF?”

The analyst, trembling: “Far too many...”

The boss: “No, just enough.”

In the end, **money follows fundamentals, not emotions.**

**Don't downvote me too much for my slight sense of humor that I share here...**

Standout dishes include the lamb (picture 4), scallop (picture 6), onion (picture 7) and chocolate (picture 12).

Special mention to the scallop dish which for me was the best scallop I’ve eaten. Just four components of; raw scallop, caviar, pickled cream and hazelnuts. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever had before and will last long in the memory.

Other highlights were the venue itself; relaxed with friendly chatty staff whilst working like clockwork presenting and taking away dishes. Plus the fact that two courses were red meat which personally I rarely see nowadays. 

However, the duck dish was disappointing with poorly rendered fat and under seasoned meat.

 The sommelier was incredible, helping us to decide on a bottle of Franz Haas Manna Schweizer. We also always ask for a large glass of the red wine that they use on the wine pairing for the red meat dish, which again was delicious. It was an Austrian red but I forget the name.

Total coffee noob here! I've mostly been drinking flat whites throughout my life, occasionally enjoying a *""properly brewed"" coffee* at boutique cafés. My SO is a bit more experienced; she uses a Bialetti Moka Express and a French press. I mostly drink milk-y coffees, but I feel like that might change as we properly start to explore the hobby. We are now considering diving deeper, looking for a more convenient machine along with either a built-in or separate grinder, etc.

Recently, the **Xbloom Studio** caught our attention, mostly because of its aesthetics and its neat, compact package that incorporates a grinder, scales, and guided recipes. It seems beginner-friendly.

We're not on a super-tight budget, but I don't want to invest in something overly niche or complicated that we won't be able to fully utilize. Initially, we were recommended fully automatic espresso machines by tech-store folks, but practically, we're drawn more to pour-over setups.

# My main questions are:

* Does the **Xbloom Studio** make sense for **beginners** like us?
* Is it fairly straightforward to consistently make decent coffee, or will it require extensive fiddling?
* **Can we easily use our own coffee beans** without running into complicated adjustments or issues? I read some posts of people using their beans and being quite happy with it, but I'm just cautious if the nuances of doing that are lost on me being the coffee-peasants that we are right now :D

I'm (38M) hoping some of you might have advice for me. I am a straight guy who is often mistaken for being gay by gay people (though seems like the more flamboyant types clock me as straight so don't know what's going on there) I'm not bothered by this, but I may be in a tricky situation because of this.

I am a receptionist and one of the clients is a real friendly guy who I joke around and chat with whenever they're in. Yesterday when they were on their way out the door they gave me their card and said if I ever wanted to get coffee to let then know. They came back about 30 seconds later to write their number on the back, realizing their card only has their email address. They wrote ""please text me"" and underlined it, and said they would really like if we went for a coffee. They also mentioned recently their husband passed away a few years ago. Lastly, I am on the spectrum so quite possible they have been giving me signals which have gone over my head, or have just been being friendly. I can literally never tell the difference.

I would love to go for coffee because we joke around and talk, and I don't know many people in the city, but I'm also concerned we're not on the same page. Also, if that's true, I know what it's like to take a big swing and miss completely and how terrible and humiliating that can feel, so kind of makes me sick to think the shoe is on the other foot this time and I might be the one to let someone down. I'm also worried I'm overthinking this and they simply want to go for a coffee, so also don't want to make an ass of myself.

I'm hoping someone out there has some advice for me on how to gingerly and respectfully tell them I am absolutely down to hang out, but in a way that makes sure we're on the same page.

I currently use a Breville Bambino Plus with pre-ground(!!!) coffee. We make two espressos a day, both milk based. There is no depth or nuance to our coffee palette (hence the pre-ground) but know we can be doing better. I’m looking for a balance of 

- quiet: we have two under two and I’d love to not wake anyone up or be subjected to a shrill screech during my most cherished moment of the day 

- easy workflow: my wife thinks pre-ground is the pinnacle of convenience and is reticent to even subject herself to a grinder so I’d like it to feel the least like an added step possible 

- not too ugly: wife picky about looking at a hopper on the counter or a big black plastic box all day. 

Budget: $700 

So far I’ve been between the Niche Zero in white, and the DF64. It seems as though the DF64 is considered to be loud/shrill but is otherwise a really good grinder, whereas the Niche is representing less value for money in 2025. 

All suggestions welcome!

According to google and ChatGPT I am just dehydrated and also sensitive to caffeine but here our Celsius cans only have 100mg compared to the 200mg of caffeine in the US. I don’t think it’s the caffeine sensitivity because I used to drink lots of Pepsi max which is like 60mg of caffeine every 250ml and I’d drink more than that throughout the day. What I’m basically asking is if you have any tips to drink more water throughout the day or if you have a miracle solution to stop my headache and nausea.
Ps I do bring my drink bottle with me to class etc but I literally don’t drink it, it’s like an accessory. I also live in Australia, love my Owala, don’t drink coffee ☺️",1,1740486441.0,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,29,0.67,False

I'm now doing it again (since NYE) and feel great, less anxiety about life in general, sleeping well. I don't have the bursts of energy/more energy other people profess to experience when dry. But I'm now 66! So maybe age is the factor!
I should add alcohol has never impacted my work, which is still fulltime 7 to 7 five days a week.
I live alone and going to pub to watch football/sport was a frequent occurrence.
I'm spending more time in coffee shops and saving a ton of money. Beer prices in London are insane post Covid and haven't gone back down.
My social circles always involved booze...friends I played rugby with mainly (in Eng and Ireland), people I cycle with will spend 2 to 4 hours drinking post a ride.
I have avoided meet-ups with old rugby colleagues in England and dread how I would deal with a Dublin session!
I quite like not drinking. 
So here's my question: did those on here completely change their social circle when they went dry? Did you go for new hobbies? Even stop seeing certain friends (sounds extreme!)

1ixtq48,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1ixtq48/joe_k_part_8/,Joe K - Part 8,"The future came to K about a week later, when he was summoned to attend an interview at the police station. After signing in, he was lead to the same interview room as before. Ohm was unable to attend, for unspecified health reasons, but he'd sent a replacement. ""Hi Joe,"" said a petit woman with long blue hair.

""Hi Roni, if that *is* you. I might have to ask you some security questions.""

""Go ahead, but be gentle with me, I could break down under interrogation.""

""What's the real colour of your hair?""

""There is no real colour, Joe, there's no real anything. This is all a dream, it's whatever colour your subconscious wants it to be.""

""My subconscious doesn't want to be here... nothing personal, of course. Any idea what this is about?""

""As your temporary legal representative, I would advise myself to say 'no comment', but, as a projection of your subconscious mind, I might as well tell you to expect good news."" A knock on the door was followed, exactly three seconds later, by the entrance of Chief Inspector Dee and a woman in a white blouse, black pencil skirt and mid-length heels. She had pale skin and long brown hair with a severe fringe. The only greeting she gave was a non-committal half-smile delivered to the space between K and Veronica.

""Sorry to keep you waiting, this is Sarah, she's from our..."" the chief inspector was cut short by Sarah's almost imperceptible sideways glance. ""*The*... *Independent* Police Complaints Authority and is here in a purely observational capacity."" They sat down while Veronica gave Joe a very perceptible sideways glance and a smile to go with it. ""OK, let's get this over with... sorry, I mean, let's... sorry..."" Sarah handed him an A5-sized piece of white card. After taking a few seconds to compose himself he read quickly, like a shy, nervous child delivering a speech to the school assembly. ""Mr K, on behalf of my department, and the force in general, I would like to apologise for the conduct of one of my officers during your arrest. We, in the police, expect nothing but the very highest standards of behaviour from our officers, and on this occasion those standards were not met, and for that we apologise. Following a thorough internal investigation, we have concluded that the language used by the officer in question was completely unacceptable and can assure you that disciplinary measures have been taken. We hope that you will accept our most sincere apologies and that we can put this whole unfortunate business behind us."" Although he'd managed to plough through the prepared statement efficiently enough, Chief Inspector Dee was clearly not a man at ease with another persons words coming out of his mouth.

In spite of all eyes being on him, it took a while for K to realise that everyone was waiting for him to speak. ""You mean... I'm no longer under arrest?""

""Of course you're under arrest. Really, Mr K, you've had two weeks to familiarise yourself with your case and you're still as ignorant as..."" Those almost imperceptible sideways glances from Sarah were so skilfully rendered that K would later wonder if it was part of her training, and how much practice they took to master. At this moment, though, he was too busy trying to master his own emotions, without the underappreciated help the chief inspector was getting to master his. In the end they both gave in.

""Then why am I here?""

""Were you not listening? to... 'put this whole unfortunate business behind us'. Womble's been suspended and arrested, and you're also getting half your books back... if you 'accept our most sincere apologies' that is.""

""Wait, he's been arrested?""

""Of course he has, there's no room in the modern police force, or anywhere else, for such outdated attitudes."" He looked at Sarah, as if expecting a pat on the back.

""But that seems a bit extreme, couldn't you just... I don't know, have a word.""

""Have a word! Have a word! Then what would people say? I'll tell you what they'd say, they'd say 'they're a law unto themselves, that lot', that's what they'd say. Well that's not how we do things around here, not any more. Nobody is above the law, Mr K. Now, do we have a deal?"" That now familiar feeling of bewilderment and utter helplessness descended over K again. Would there be no end to this madness?

""I sup...""

""May I have a word with my client?"" Leaning in so close that her breath sensitively tickled his ear, making him blush and sheepishly glance up at Dee's smirk and Sarah's poker face, Veronica whispered, ""fancy a haggle?"" How could he refuse such a offer? She sat back and looked straight up at the chief inspector with the confrontational pose of a seasoned size-discrepancy veteran. ""He wants all his books back.""

""My hands are tied, this department is no longer handling the investigation...60% is the best I can do.""

""95 - do I have to remind you exactly why *your* department is no longer handling the investigation?"" Another signature move from subtle Sarah.

""65.""

""90""

""...70.""

""85.""

""...75.""

""80.""

""75 is the best I can do, Miss...

""Miss mind-your-own-business - 80%, and another apology, or we walk. What *would* people say?"" Dee looked like his head was about to explode, but he managed to keep his cool.

""Deal. Mr K, we're sorry."" He concluded the negotiation and received a form from Sarah that he passed over to K. ""Sign this,"" he said and added under his breath - ""If you can remember who you are, this time.""

Outside the station, a fiery Veronica jumped up and down and threw her bony arms around K's bony neck, while his own bony arms remained pinned, stubbornly, to his bony sides. ""We did it!"" she shouted.

""Did what? I'm still under arrest. And now someone else is.""

""Are you crazy? you've got 80% of your books back, that's a great result.""

""They've still got 20%, and they're *my* books."" K was in no mood to celebrate the small victory. The guilt he felt about Inspector Womble's arrest concealed itself in a surly bitterness directed at the person whose, admittedly offhand, remark about expecting good news had misled him into believing that the whole affair was finally about to reach a satisfactory conclusion.

""A little gratitude wouldn't go amiss, you know."" Veronica was right and K knew it. He regretted his outburst and felt ashamed of his childish behaviour. Now he had two reasons to feel guilty, but he could only apologise for one of them.

""I'm sorry, Roni, and thank you - getting those books back means a lot to me. And you were great in there,"" he said, with a smile that attempted to add a flirtatious, reconciliatory, spin to the apology but probably just came off as a bit awkward. Either way or regardless, the gesture was effortlessly reciprocated.

""I was, wasn't I? Did you see the way I intimidated the chief inspector? I'm going to make a great lawyer, just wait until I get in that courtroom, there'll be...""

""Wait, am I going to court?"" After all the crazy mental gymnastics of the past few weeks, K found himself spontaneously voicing the ultimate fear lurking at the back of his mind - the trial. It was a fear that Veronica dismissed with one blow, like a ninja assassin.

""Are you kidding? The way your case is going, you're never going to court. You should celebrate.""

""Care to join me?"" he causally let out, as if it was something he did all the time, then immediately started panicking. What the hell am I going to talk about with a young woman half my age? I've got no real interest in her life and I don't have one - are we going to sit there and compare centuries? Maybe she read his mind and decided to show mercy, or maybe she was thinking exactly the same thing, or maybe she was completely repulsed by the idea of spending any more time with him than was absolutely necessary... or maybe she really did have to get back to the office.

""...I might be able to give you a lift though, where do you want to go?""

""Uh... the Black Bottom,"" he said, because he didn't want to say 'home', and it was the first place he thought of. Before they left, she took a selfie of them both in front of the police station to commemorate the victory. Then she took another. Then she took several more until she was happy that K looked happy enough. Then she took several more until she was happy that she looked pretty enough. Then she took one where you could see enough of the sign to tell it was the police station and said she'd photo-shop the three of them together later to make sure she really captured the moment. By the end of the process, K was certain that the thin man in the grey hooded top, over the other side of the road was looking at them.

Veronica refused to believe the old coffee house even existed, while pointing out all the ""better"" alternatives that *were* on her google maps. As a non-driver, K's directions were sketchy, at best. He had no knowledge of the one-way system and couldn't tell a road from a walkway, but Veronica didn't seem to mind the extra trouble and even received a little Proustian rush when they finally did arrive at their destination.

""Oh, I remember this place, we drifted over here a few times when we were kids. Didn't it used to be a pub called... The Starry Night, or something? We'd knock on the window and pull faces at the old Irishman behind the bar, and he'd come running out, shouting - 'Get out of here, you fucking munchkins.'"" She nailed the generic accent so perfectly that K could almost visualise Ulysses Rheaney shaking his fist in the doorway.

""He died of a heart-attack a few years ago,"" he said.

""Well, don't blame me, we were only kids.""

Feeling the need to thank Veronica for both the overextended lift and, again, for the imminent return of his books, he offered to buy her a coffee, but was secretly relieved when she declined, giving him the opportunity to skip going in at all and head straight home, instead. You never know, he thought, my books might already be waiting for me. He walked as slowly as he thought a healthy fifty-year-old man could reasonably be seen doing, hoping she would drive away, but the sound he was waiting for never reached his ears. Two feet from the entrance, he turned around. She was on her phone, apparently in no particular hurry. ""I thought you had to get back to the office,"" he fumed, under his breath. There was no avoiding taking the whole pointless ruse all the way to its conclusion. Trying not to look around, he made straight for the counter.

""He's not here,"" said Ma. K was taken aback - being remembered was something that used to happen, and he was still struggling to adjust to its recent comeback.

""Are you sure he's not in the shadows somewhere?""

""I wouldn't worry about him, he might get a little overexcited sometimes but he's harmless enough, that one. I'm not so sure about the other company you've been keeping, though. Black, no sugar, is it? or an Amerikano as they call it these days?""

""Either one... thanks.""

""Anything to eat? - they call that up-selling, I went on a course, once.""

""No thanks... Ma.""

""I should ask for my money back.""

""Amerikanos and up-selling? didn't I see you on *The Apprentice*?""

""No, it was *Dragon's Den*, Deborah Median bought 50% of this place, so I bought a signed picture of Max Roach to drum up business. As you can see, it worked. Grab yourself a seat, I'll bring it on over."" Since the place was empty, K walked around, looking at the photographs and found he could identify about half. He had a small collection of classic jazz albums at home, but nothing to play them on for years. Unexpectedly sinking into the blues, staring at the eponymous picture in the Thelonious Monk booth, K was only brought back to Earth by the sudden appearance of Ma, bearing two mugs of coffee. ""He's more at home here than any of the others, don't you think? 'The Van Gogh of Jazz,' da used to call him. You suddenly look like you want to be alone but is it alright if I join you?""

""'It's alright, Ma... I'm only sighing.'""

""In that case you're in luck, this week's special offer is a free therapy session with every cup of coffee,"" she said, sitting opposite him. ""Go on, I won't judge.""

""That's a relief, it feels like everyone else is. I've been arrested and it feels like I'm already on trial, but I don't even know what it's all about.""

""Oh, that's easy, all trials are about the same thing. For instance, there was this one trial in Italy about 400 years ago. Now, folk didn't know much about space back in them days, and they had what they called the Ptolemaic System. It was your basic geocentric system, with the Earth at the centre of the universe, and it perfect made sense - man was God's masterpiece and Earth was man's home so why the fuck wouldn't He put it in the middle, right? And, you must admit, it does look that way, if you don't pay too much attention. But then, in the middle of the sixteenth century, this Polish fella comes along and starts paying too much attention. His name was Copernicus, and he had a good old look at space and said - 'I don't buy it. It seems to me, from my observations, that the Earth is not the centre of the universe, the Sun is.' So he invented a new heliocentric system, which he called the Copernican System, because he thought it was a great discovery and he wanted folk to associate his name with something clever. Unfortunately, everyone thought he was nuts and started telling jokes about him, like - 'A man walks into a pub with his shoes on his head, and the barman says why are you dressed like that, and the man says I'm using the new Copernican System', stuff like that. Then, about sixty or seventy years later, when everyone else had forgotten the crazy old Polish fella, this other fella, a real smart fella, thought the crazy old Polish fella might not be so crazy, after all. His name was Galileo and he said - 'Check this out, I've invented this thing called a telescope and I've been looking at the moons of Jupiter, and I've been looking at the phases of Venus, and I've definitely not been looking at your sister in the bath, whatever she says, and I think Copernicus was right, I think the Sun *is* the centre of the universe.' Now, when Galileo said something, folk didn't joke, they paid attention, so the catholic church asked him if wouldn't mind not contradicting the word of God so much. And he tried, but you know how hard it is keep a secret? In 1632 he published a book called *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems* which was as much of a dialogue as this is, and nobody was falling for it, least of all the Roman Inquisition. Galileo was found guilty of heresy and remained under house arrest until he died in 1642. Of course, the trial wasn't just about Galileo verses the catholic church, its implications run much deeper than that.""

""Science verses religion.""

""Deeper than that, even - the truth verses the trial. The truth was defending its right to decide the trial and the trial was defending its right to decide the truth. The trial had home advantage, though, so the truth was held in contempt of court and it hasn't been let back in since.""

""How can you say that? things have changed a bit in the last 400 years. Scientific analysis is used in trials all the time now, it can establish guilt or innocence on it's own.""

""It can, but it's not allowed to. Lawyers still manipulate facts and juries still make ill-informed decisions. It doesn't matter how objective and cutting edge the science is, when the justice system remains ultimately subjective and mired in tradition. With all the advances science has made in the last 400 years, the legal process has barely changed at all, and there's a very good reason for that - man's ego. The laws of nature can never be allowed to be more important than the laws of man. The trial can never be decided by the truth, the truth has to be decided by the trial.""

""I'll bear that in mind, Ma, but I'm not sure how it helps me?""

""Oh, it's all about *you*, isn't it?""

""Well you did say this was therapy.""

""I also said it was free, if you want the Joey-centric system go and pay some bearded cunt to blow pipe-smoke up your arse for an hour. Times up, if you need another session, you'll have to buy another coffee.""

""'It's alright, Ma, I can make it.'""

K made it home, at least, and was relieved to do so, having criss-crossed his way along Kandinsky Street to avoid the zephyrs. As he trudged up the stairwell, he thought, as he always did, of calling on Katie. It was about forty-five minutes before the school closed, so he knew she'd be up and about. She can't still be mad at me, he thought, can she? There was a brief message from Zephyr on his answering machine which, without really paying attention to, he deleted. He'd phoned yesterday too, asking to meet, but K was too afraid to pick up the receiver. Did he have a stalker, now? Maybe he could ask Katie, maybe she would know, maybe she's had a stalker... maybe *he's* Katie's stalker. He didn't feel like a stalker, but they never do, do they?

The door buzzer almost buzzed him out of his skin. His first thought - I've got to answer it, in case it's Katie. His second thought - I can't answer it, in case it's Zephyr. His third thought - it can't be Zephyr, he doesn't know where I live. His fourth thought - does he? He peaked through his blinds and saw a white transit van parked outside, triggering his fifth thought - my books? The lift was in one of its regular out-of-order phases and K's offer of assistance was declined for health and safety reasons, so it took the two men over an hour to carry the thirty-four cardboard boxes, each stamped *APPROVED*, up the stairwell. With barely concealed resentment, they treated him like an inconvenience, but found plenty of time to flirt with Katie when she passed them on the stairs, on her way to pick up Robbie from school.

Each box was opened with a kitchen knife and a hint of ceremony, performed only for himself. Initially checking each cover for damage, this evolved into deeper content dives. There were science books he'd barely understood and history books he'd meant to read again. There were novels he remembered fondly - certain plots, episodes, characters, others he'd forgotten all about and others with memories and past associations still stuck between the pages. From *A Brief History of Time* \- that his mother had given him for his sixteenth birthday, to *A Brief History of Seven Killings* \- one of Quinn and Richard's recommendations in the card that came with last years Christmas tip, they all spoke to him from beneath and beyond their covers. An old bud-smoking buddy had lent him *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* decades ago, and thinking that he was probably a grandfather by now gave him a strangely comforting feeling of intimacy, oxymoronically stretching across space and time, and tinged with regret. He was a good friend, he should've held on to that one... and couple of others. There were less comforting feelings, too, like shame. *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat* reminded him of the boy who mistook his girlfriend for a jimmy hat. His first lover had lent him that book over thirty years ago, but he had no idea why *The Shape of Things to Come* reminded him of his first snog, and the subsequent emotional intensity that had kept him awake the whole night, and unable to make eye-contact with the girl at all the next day. Could his juvenile attitude and behaviour towards women have been fuelled by the shame of falling in love too easily? In the time and place that K grew up, real men weren't allowed to have feelings - well, apart from lust, that was either compulsory or completely unacceptable, depending on its object. It's funny how a false sense of shame can lead directly to genuinely shameful behaviour. He put some books to one side, determined to have a second, or third, crack at them - Thomas Bernhard's relentlessly repetitive *Extinction*, David Foster Wallace's infinitely tedious *Infinite Jest*, Fernando Pessoa's disquietingly quiet *The Book of Disquiet*, and a history of quantum mechanics that had collapsed his functioning on more than one previous occasion. Next to it, a much bigger pile of books seemed to have grown under its own volition. These were the books whose gravitational fields were still pulling him in, towards forgotten old pleasures and potential new discoveries. There are some friends people want to visit, and some they visit because they feel they should. He was flicking through Anna Kavan's *Ice*, borrowed from another old girlfriend from years gone by, and wondering if she still had his cheap pulp version of *A Canticle for Leibowitz*, when the phone rang again. Expecting Zephyr, he let the answering machine take it. ""Joe?... Bro. Sorry I haven't been in touch, I've been a bit busy, lately. Anyway, there's been an unexpected development and we've had to switch tactics. I'll pick you up at ten in the morning, there's someone I'd like you to meet.""",1,1740486158.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

They don’t tell you about the weight.

Not the weight of the scrubs or the stethoscope pressing grooves into your neck, not the weight of the chart clipped to your trembling fingers, not the weight of the ECG stickers that never quite come off.

I mean the weight of the ones we carry. The ones who don’t walk out.

You go in thinking about saving lives, not how it feels to hold one down, to press the full force of your body into their ribs, knowing each compression could crack them like dry branches, but if you stop, if you hesitate - 
they won’t come back.

There’s no music in a code blue, no slow-motion Hollywood drama. Just a flurry of hands and voices that don’t match their faces, a language of urgency spoken in half-broken commands, shouted across sterile air. “Push epi! More compressions! Clear!”
And then the quiet that follows when it’s over, the only sound left is the hum of fluorescent lights and the beeping of machines that don’t need to beep anymore.

You tell yourself you’re fine.

You don’t have time to grieve a stranger, not when the next call bell is already blinking, not when room 306 needs pain meds and the woman in 214 is sundowning again, and if you let yourself feel it all, let yourself drown in every last heartbeat that flickered and failed under your hands,
you’ll never be able to clock back in.

So you carry them instead.

The man with the wedding ring, his wife’s voice still echoing in the hallway.
The girl who shouldn’t have been there, her chart too thin for her age.
The hands you’ve held until they went cold, the last breaths you’ve witnessed in the spaces between chest compressions, in the pauses that feel too long, in the moments where the monitor stills and someone says, “Time of death.”

And even when your hands are clean, even when your scrubs are fresh, even when the hospital doors slide shut behind you and the world outside doesn’t know what you’ve just done - 
they stay with you.

You laugh with your friends, fold laundry, sip your coffee.
But sometimes, the smell of saline pulls you back.
Sometimes, the sound of a dropped glass makes your chest tighten like you’re back in the room, waiting for the rhythm to return.

And no one sees it. No one asks.

Because you were built for this, right? Because you signed up for it. Because heroes don’t break.

But we do. Quietly. In the spaces between shifts, in the seconds before sleep.

Not in dramatic collapses, but in the subtle ways we learn to carry the weight - 
of the ones we saved,
and the ones we couldn’t.

After signing in, he was lead to the same interview room as before. Ohm was unable to attend, for unspecified health reasons, but he'd sent a replacement. ""Hi Joe,"" said a petit woman with long blue hair.

""Hi Roni, if that *is* you. I might have to ask you some security questions.""

""Go ahead, but be gentle with me, I could break down under interrogation.""

""What's the real colour of your hair?""

""There is no real colour, Joe, there's no real anything. This is all a dream, it's whatever colour your subconscious wants it to be.""

""My subconscious doesn't want to be here... nothing personal, of course. Any idea what this is about?""

""As your temporary legal representative, I would advise myself to say 'no comment', but, as a projection of your subconscious mind, I might as well tell you to expect good news."" A knock on the door was followed, exactly three seconds later, by the entrance of Chief Inspector Dee and a woman in a white blouse, black pencil skirt and mid-length heels. She had pale skin and long brown hair with a severe fringe. The only greeting she gave was a non-committal half-smile delivered to the space between K and Veronica.

""Sorry to keep you waiting, this is Sarah, she's from our..."" the chief inspector was cut short by Sarah's almost imperceptible sideways glance. ""*The*... *Independent* Police Complaints Authority and is here in a purely observational capacity."" They sat down while Veronica gave Joe a very perceptible sideways glance and a smile to go with it. ""OK, let's get this over with... sorry, I mean, let's... sorry..."" Sarah handed him an A5-sized piece of white card. After taking a few seconds to compose himself he read quickly, like a shy, nervous child delivering a speech to the school assembly. ""Mr K, on behalf of my department, and the force in general, I would like to apologise for the conduct of one of my officers during your arrest. We, in the police, expect nothing but the very highest standards of behaviour from our officers, and on this occasion those standards were not met, and for that we apologise. Following a thorough internal investigation, we have concluded that the language used by the officer in question was completely unacceptable and can assure you that disciplinary measures have been taken. We hope that you will accept our most sincere apologies and that we can put this whole unfortunate business behind us."" Although he'd managed to plough through the prepared statement efficiently enough, Chief Inspector Dee was clearly not a man at ease with another persons words coming out of his mouth.

In spite of all eyes being on him, it took a while for K to realise that everyone was waiting for him to speak. ""You mean... I'm no longer under arrest?""

""Of course you're under arrest. Really, Mr K, you've had two weeks to familiarise yourself with your case and you're still as ignorant as..."" Those almost imperceptible sideways glances from Sarah were so skilfully rendered that K would later wonder if it was part of her training, and how much practice they took to master. At this moment, though, he was too busy trying to master his own emotions, without the underappreciated help the chief inspector was getting to master his. In the end they both gave in.

""Then why am I here?""

""Were you not listening? to... 'put this whole unfortunate business behind us'. Womble's been suspended and arrested, and you're also getting half your books back... if you 'accept our most sincere apologies' that is.""

""Wait, he's been arrested?""

""Of course he has, there's no room in the modern police force, or anywhere else, for such outdated attitudes."" He looked at Sarah, as if expecting a pat on the back.

""But that seems a bit extreme, couldn't you just... I don't know, have a word.""

""Have a word! Have a word! Then what would people say? I'll tell you what they'd say, they'd say 'they're a law unto themselves, that lot', that's what they'd say. Well that's not how we do things around here, not any more. Nobody is above the law, Mr K. Now, do we have a deal?"" That now familiar feeling of bewilderment and utter helplessness descended over K again. Would there be no end to this madness?

""I sup...""

""May I have a word with my client?"" Leaning in so close that her breath sensitively tickled his ear, making him blush and sheepishly glance up at Dee's smirk and Sarah's poker face, Veronica whispered, ""fancy a haggle?"" How could he refuse such a offer? She sat back and looked straight up at the chief inspector with the confrontational pose of a seasoned size-discrepancy veteran. ""He wants all his books back.""

""My hands are tied, this department is no longer handling the investigation...60% is the best I can do.""

""95 - do I have to remind you exactly why *your* department is no longer handling the investigation?"" Another signature move from subtle Sarah.

""65.""

""90""

""...70.""

""85.""

""...75.""

""80.""

""75 is the best I can do, Miss...

""Miss mind-your-own-business - 80%, and another apology, or we walk. What *would* people say?"" Dee looked like his head was about to explode, but he managed to keep his cool.

""Deal. Mr K, we're sorry."" He concluded the negotiation and received a form from Sarah that he passed over to K. ""Sign this,"" he said and added under his breath - ""If you can remember who you are, this time.""

Outside the station, a fiery Veronica jumped up and down and threw her bony arms around K's bony neck, while his own bony arms remained pinned, stubbornly, to his bony sides. ""We did it!"" she shouted.

""Did what? I'm still under arrest. And now someone else is.""

""Are you crazy? you've got 80% of your books back, that's a great result.""

""They've still got 20%, and they're *my* books."" K was in no mood to celebrate the small victory. The guilt he felt about Inspector Womble's arrest concealed itself in a surly bitterness directed at the person whose, admittedly offhand, remark about expecting good news had misled him into believing that the whole affair was finally about to reach a satisfactory conclusion.

""A little gratitude wouldn't go amiss, you know."" Veronica was right and K knew it. He regretted his outburst and felt ashamed of his childish behaviour. Now he had two reasons to feel guilty, but he could only apologise for one of them.

""I'm sorry, Roni, and thank you - getting those books back means a lot to me. And you were great in there,"" he said, with a smile that attempted to add a flirtatious, reconciliatory, spin to the apology but probably just came off as a bit awkward. Either way or regardless, the gesture was effortlessly reciprocated.

""I was, wasn't I? Did you see the way I intimidated the chief inspector? I'm going to make a great lawyer, just wait until I get in that courtroom, there'll be...""

""Wait, am I going to court?"" After all the crazy mental gymnastics of the past few weeks, K found himself spontaneously voicing the ultimate fear lurking at the back of his mind - the trial. It was a fear that Veronica dismissed with one blow, like a ninja assassin.

""Are you kidding? The way your case is going, you're never going to court. You should celebrate.""

""Care to join me?"" he causally let out, as if it was something he did all the time, then immediately started panicking. What the hell am I going to talk about with a young woman half my age? I've got no real interest in her life and I don't have one - are we going to sit there and compare centuries? Maybe she read his mind and decided to show mercy, or maybe she was thinking exactly the same thing, or maybe she was completely repulsed by the idea of spending any more time with him than was absolutely necessary... or maybe she really did have to get back to the office.

""...I might be able to give you a lift though, where do you want to go?""

""Uh... the Black Bottom,"" he said, because he didn't want to say 'home', and it was the first place he thought of. Before they left, she took a selfie of them both in front of the police station to commemorate the victory. Then she took another. Then she took several more until she was happy that K looked happy enough. Then she took several more until she was happy that she looked pretty enough. Then she took one where you could see enough of the sign to tell it was the police station and said she'd photo-shop the three of them together later to make sure she really captured the moment. By the end of the process, K was certain that the thin man in the grey hooded top, over the other side of the road was looking at them.

Veronica refused to believe the old coffee house even existed, while pointing out all the ""better"" alternatives that *were* on her google maps. As a non-driver, K's directions were sketchy, at best. He had no knowledge of the one-way system and couldn't tell a road from a walkway, but Veronica didn't seem to mind the extra trouble and even received a little Proustian rush when they finally did arrive at their destination.

""Oh, I remember this place, we drifted over here a few times when we were kids. Didn't it used to be a pub called... The Starry Night, or something? We'd knock on the window and pull faces at the old Irishman behind the bar, and he'd come running out, shouting - 'Get out of here, you fucking munchkins.'"" She nailed the generic accent so perfectly that K could almost visualise Ulysses Rheaney shaking his fist in the doorway.

""He died of a heart-attack a few years ago,"" he said.

""Well, don't blame me, we were only kids.""

Feeling the need to thank Veronica for both the overextended lift and, again, for the imminent return of his books, he offered to buy her a coffee, but was secretly relieved when she declined, giving him the opportunity to skip going in at all and head straight home instead. You never know, he thought, my books might already be waiting for me. He walked as slowly as he thought a healthy fifty-year-old man could reasonably be seen doing, hoping she would drive away, but the sound he was waiting for never reached his ears. Two feet from the entrance, he turned around. She was on her phone, apparently in no particular hurry. ""I thought you had to get back to the office,"" he fumed, under his breath. There was no avoiding taking the whole pointless ruse all the way to its conclusion. Trying not to look around, he made straight for the counter.

""He's not here,"" said Ma. K was taken aback - being remembered was something that used to happen, and he was still struggling to adjust to its recent comeback.

""Are you sure he's not in the shadows somewhere?""

""I wouldn't worry about him, he might get a little overexcited sometimes but he's harmless enough, that one. I'm not so sure about the other company you've been keeping, though. Black, no sugar, is it? or an Amerikano as they call it these days?""

""Either one... thanks.""

""Anything to eat? - they call that up-selling, I went on a course, once.""

""No thanks... Ma.""

""I should ask for my money back.""

""Amerikanos and up-selling? didn't I see you on *The Apprentice*?""

""No, it was *Dragon's Den*, Deborah Median bought 50% of this place, so I bought a signed picture of Max Roach to drum up business. As you can see, it worked. Grab yourself a seat, I'll bring it on over."" Since the place was empty, K walked around, looking at the photographs and found he could identify about half. He had a small collection of classic jazz albums at home, but nothing to play them on for years. Unexpectedly sinking into the blues, staring at the eponymous picture in the Thelonious Monk booth, K was only brought back to Earth by the sudden appearance of Ma, bearing two mugs of coffee. ""He's more at home here than any of the others, don't you think? 'The Van Gogh of Jazz,' da used to call him. You suddenly look like you want to be alone but is it alright if I join you?""

""'It's alright, Ma... I'm only sighing.'""

""In that case you're in luck, this week's special offer is a free therapy session with every cup of coffee,"" she said, sitting opposite him. ""Go on, I won't judge.""

""That's a relief, it feels like everyone else is. I've been arrested and it feels like I'm already on trial, but I don't even know what it's all about.""

""Oh, that's easy, all trials are about the same thing. For instance, there was this one trial in Italy about 400 years ago. Now, folk didn't know much about space back in them days, and they had what they called the Ptolemaic System. It was your basic geocentric system, with the Earth at the centre of the universe, and it made perfect sense - man was God's masterpiece and Earth was man's home so why the fuck wouldn't He put it in the middle, right? And, you must admit, it does look that way, if you don't pay too much attention. But then, in the middle of the sixteenth century, this Polish fella comes along and starts paying too much attention. His name was Copernicus, and he had a good old look at space and said - 'I don't buy it. It seems to me, from my observations, that the Earth is not the centre of the universe, the Sun is.' So he invented a new heliocentric system, which he called the Copernican System, because he thought it was a great discovery and he wanted folk to associate his name with something clever. Unfortunately, everyone thought he was nuts and started telling jokes about him, like - 'A man walks into a pub with his shoes on his head, and the barman says why are you dressed like that, and the man says I'm using the new Copernican System', stuff like that. Then, about sixty or seventy years later, when everyone else had forgotten the crazy old Polish fella, this other fella, a real smart fella, thought the crazy old Polish fella might not be so crazy, after all. His name was Galileo and he said - 'Check this out, I've invented this thing called a telescope and I've been looking at the moons of Jupiter, and I've been looking at the phases of Venus, and I've definitely not been looking at your sister in the bath, whatever she says, and I think Copernicus was right, I think the Sun *is* the centre of the universe.' Now, when Galileo said something, folk didn't joke, they paid attention, so the catholic church asked him if wouldn't mind not contradicting the word of God so much. And he tried, but you know how hard it is keep a secret? In 1632 he published a book called *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems* which was as much of a dialogue as this is, and nobody was falling for it, least of all the Roman Inquisition. Galileo was found guilty of heresy and remained under house arrest until he died in 1642. Of course, the trial wasn't just about Galileo verses the catholic church, its implications run much deeper than that.""

""Science verses religion.""

""Deeper than that, even - the truth verses the trial. The truth was defending its right to decide the trial and the trial was defending its right to decide the truth. The trial had home advantage, though, so the truth was held in contempt of court and it hasn't been let back in since.""

""How can you say that? things have changed a bit in the last 400 years. Scientific analysis is used in trials all the time now, it can establish guilt or innocence on it's own.""

""It can, but it's not allowed to. Lawyers still manipulate facts and juries still make ill-informed decisions. It doesn't matter how objective and cutting edge the science is, when the justice system remains ultimately subjective and mired in tradition. With all the advances science has made in the last 400 years, the legal process has barely changed at all, and there's a very good reason for that - man's ego. The laws of nature can never be allowed to be more important than the laws of man. The trial can never be decided by the truth, the truth has to be decided by the trial.""

""I'll bear that in mind, Ma, but I'm not sure how it helps me?""

""Oh, it's all about *you*, isn't it?""

""Well you did say this was therapy.""

""I also said it was free, if you want the Joey-centric system go and pay some bearded cunt to blow pipe-smoke up your arse for an hour. Times up, if you need another session, you'll have to buy another coffee.""

""'It's alright, Ma, I can make it.'""

K made it home, at least, and was relieved to do so, having criss-crossed his way along Kandinsky Street to avoid the zephyrs. As he trudged up the stairwell, he thought, as he always did, of calling on Katie. It was about forty-five minutes before the school closed, so he knew she'd be up and about. She can't still be mad at me, he thought, can she? There was a brief message from Zephyr on his answering machine which, without really paying attention to, he deleted. He'd phoned yesterday too, asking to meet, but K was too afraid to pick up the receiver. Did he have a stalker, now? Maybe he could ask Katie, maybe she would know, maybe she's had a stalker... maybe *he's* Katie's stalker. He didn't feel like a stalker, but they never do, do they?

The door buzzer almost buzzed him out of his skin. His first thought - I've got to answer it, in case it's Katie. His second thought - I can't answer it, in case it's Zephyr. His third thought - it can't be Zephyr, he doesn't know where I live. His fourth thought - does he? He peaked through his blinds and saw a white transit van parked outside, triggering his fifth thought - my books? The lift was in one of its regular out-of-order phases and K's offer of assistance was declined for health and safety reasons, so it took the two men over an hour to carry the thirty-four cardboard boxes, each stamped *APPROVED*, up the stairwell. With barely concealed resentment, they treated him like an inconvenience, but found plenty of time to flirt with Katie when she passed them on the stairs, on her way to pick up Robbie from school.

Each box was opened with a kitchen knife and a hint of ceremony, performed only for himself. Initially checking each cover for damage, this evolved into deeper content dives. There were science books he'd barely understood and history books he'd meant to read again. There were novels he remembered fondly - certain plots, episodes, characters, others he'd forgotten all about and others with memories and past associations still stuck between the pages. From *A Brief History of Time* \- that his mother had given him for his sixteenth birthday, to *A Brief History of Seven Killings* \- one of Quinn and Richard's recommendations in the card that came with last years Christmas tip, they all spoke to him from beneath and beyond their covers. An old bud-smoking buddy had lent him *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* decades ago, and thinking that he was probably a grandfather by now gave him a strangely comforting feeling of intimacy, oxymoronically stretching across space and time, and tinged with regret. He was a good friend, he should've held on to that one... and couple of others. There were less comforting feelings, too, like shame. *The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat* reminded him of the boy who mistook his girlfriend for a jimmy hat. His first lover had lent him that book over thirty years ago, but he had no idea why *The Shape of Things to Come* reminded him of his first snog, and the subsequent emotional intensity that had kept him awake the whole night, and unable to make eye-contact with the girl at all the next day. Could his juvenile attitude and behaviour towards women have been fuelled by the shame of falling in love too easily? In the time and place that K grew up, real men weren't allowed to have feelings - well, apart from lust, that was either compulsory or completely unacceptable, depending on its object. It's funny how a false sense of shame can lead directly to genuinely shameful behaviour. He put some books to one side, determined to have a second, or third, crack at them - Thomas Bernhard's relentlessly repetitive *Extinction*, David Foster Wallace's infinitely tedious *Infinite Jest*, Fernando Pessoa's disquietingly quiet *The Book of Disquiet*, and a history of quantum mechanics that had collapsed his functioning on more than one previous occasion. Next to it, a much bigger pile of books seemed to have grown under its own volition. These were the books whose gravitational fields were still pulling him in, towards forgotten old pleasures and potential new discoveries. There are some friends people want to visit, and some they visit because they feel they should. He was flicking through Anna Kavan's *Ice*, borrowed from another old girlfriend from years gone by, and wondering if she still had his cheap pulp version of *A Canticle for Leibowitz*, when the phone rang again. Expecting Zephyr, he let the answering machine take it. ""Joe?... Bro. Sorry I haven't been in touch, I've been a bit busy, lately. Anyway, there's been an unexpected development and we've had to switch tactics. I'll pick you up at ten in the morning, there's someone I'd like you to meet.""",1,1740485883.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

**Nuisance complaint**
Residents will park in the front yard creating a muddy mess that will spill over onto the sidewalk & road.  This is a safety hazard on the sidewalk.  They knocked out the back wall of the garage and will drive cars through it and park in the back yard.  They typically do not get home until after 5.

It did not give me the correct PVA information when I tried to update it though. Opened new case. Observed everything described except the trash bags. Issuing notice. -Matthew

This last weekend I went to a let's say ""camp"". There was this girl(she was the organizator of the camp). I will try to be brief so I will jump straight to it. Saturday night I drinked and we ended up only the two of us talking until 6:00 am about our lifes. Right after we were left alone she started hugging my arm, holding at some times my hand and rest her head on my shoulder. At 6:00 we decided to go to sleep and we went to get our things to get ready. Once upstairs she said to me to remember her to get her friends towel. Fast forward we both forgot about the towel and she texted me about it when were already in bed. We talked a bit after that trough text and it ended that she owes me a coffee.

Next day she made me coffee, but it was pretty bad so she suggested me not to drink it. After that we went to a hike, when we arrived at the final point I lay down to sunbathe and after some time she came. We started talking with whom of the group we would go out to drink something. 
After we came back we didn't talk much until we started packing things. When I finished with mine I went to her and asked if she wanted help with her stuff, she said no but I could stay to chat. She complimented how I smell and we talked a bit. When it was time to go we went downstairs and I was walking besides her. Suddenly she turned back, grabbed my chin and asked: ""and, when I will see you again?"". I panicked a bit and said that if she accepts my application for the next camp. She looked at me and said: ""so I am not in the group of people with who you would drink something?"". I said that yes, if it is reciprocal. ""It is"", she said. After that we say goodbye and hugged.(I was leaving before her)
When I arrived at the bus I texted to her saying that it was a pleasure to meet her and if she need something, whatever it is, I am there to help her. She answered with something similar and ended with: now get some rest and relax. I said:""same for you"", ""see you:)"".

Last, I wanted to add that she looked me a lot these two days, she touched me in different ways(maybe I am wrong, she was hugging other people too, but I think it was a little different with me)

This was Sunday, today us Tuesday and no text from her. Maybe I am too impatient, but I just wanted to see what other people think.

1ixtks6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1ixtks6/all_the_substances/,All the substances,"It recently dawned on me— the fact that I am basically using a substance at any given part of the day. Adderall in the morning/ daytime and then alcohol or weed (I live in recreational state) in the evening. Antidepressant before going to bed. 

I have young kids and work full time. If I am unmedicated, my ADHD is either keeping me from doing my job during the day or chilling out/ being present at night. And I have generalized anxiety that plays a big part. 

I don’t feel like my relationship with alcohol is harmful but I would like to limit it for health reasons. And I use weed 1-2 times per week when I am wanting to have a “dry day” (no alcohol). 

Anyone else feel this way? Has anyone thought through this? Is there an innate harm is using these substances as tools? I have mixed feelings. Some people argue that relying on annoying at all is “addiction” and harmful in nature. On the other hand, doesn’t a large majority of Americans drink coffee every morning or eat dessert after a meal?

There is a coffee blogger I follow on Threads that posted about coffee ratios specifically for filter style coffees. He reported that he has long held the belief that shorter ratios were better, anywhere from 1:14 down to even 1:10. Needless to say, that got me thinking, especially for decaf. 

Well, I started experimenting, especially on the less premium decaf beans and I think 1:14 even 1:14.5 will make the flavours pop that little more.

**Background**


I was a pretty normal guy until shortly after my 3rd year in college hit (2016). In that year, I soon noticed myself becoming apathetic to stuff everyone cared about like the popular movies or hanging out with friends/family. At the time I thought it was a phase, but that apathy kept expanding and within a few years (2019) it encompassed my entire life. I'll break it down below (all the symptoms are chronic):


**Symptoms**

*Apathy* - I still feel emotions, but they're 1/10 as strong as they once were. Like they're frozen or trapped in deep ice. Life is basically flat, and compared to the average person I don't feel emotions at all - to the extent of letting my life fall apart because nothing feels important. Any emotion I do feel occurs only once, as a response to new stimuli. Even if I do that same thing again after that, it goes back to feeling like nothing.


*Anhedonia* - Nothing is enjoyable. When I get home from work, I watch youtube or sleep. Doing anything else is expending energy for no return. Everything that used to feel good (talking with people, watching movies, listening to falling rain) is just empty. 


*Reduced sensitivity* - My hearing is like that of an old man. Often people standing right next to me address me and I don't notice because it's so soft I assume they're far away. My sense of smell doesn't work unless I put something right under my nose and inhale very hard. Food tastes like cardboard. Sex feels like always wearing a condom. And strangely I think my eyes see less color than before. This also extends to various drugs - alcohol no longer gives me a buzz (though I still get the lowered inhibitions + spinny room thing). Day and night feel the same.


*Memory loss* - Nearly all my past memories are gone. Details of shows I watched, people I hung out with, games I played, my childhood, it's all gone. Putting new things into memory is also extremely hard (a nightmare for studying).


*Irritability* - This one is weird. I'm just irritable at random times every day. Certain pitches of sound agitate now in a way they never did. This happens with certain speaking voices a lot, and they become really painful to listen to.


*Weight loss* - I was 230 lbs./104 kg. at the start of 2014. By the end, I was 160-170 lbs. or 72-75 kg. This occurred the same time my other symptoms were worsening. The strange part of this I recall is that I put no major effort into losing weight - it simply happened by eating and acting the way I always did. Right now, I think there's some barrier that prevents me from gaining more weight. When I eat more than usual, my stomach is simply totally full and it can stay that way for days.


*Physical irritation* - My stomach feels tight and irritated all the time, and I can only defecate 1-2 times per week, sometimes not at all. When I do it's always painful and difficult, even when I make sure to eat fiber. Also, oddly the temple of my head feels weird and ""blocked"" all the time, like a stone. This is the same region that feels activated when you actually do feel emotions and pleasure, so I'm sure this is important.


*Sleep deprivation* - Any time I get stressed, I lose the ability to sleep altogether. Even small stressors, like college exams, usually cause this. My circadian rhythm also slips quite easily and I've ""inverted"" it by accident many times, waking up at dusk and sleeping at dawn. This never happened before the illness.


*Derealization* - Not to be confused with depersonalization. It's feeling totally removed from your environment. When out in public, I feel like a self-driving car with no driver at the wheel, my body is there but I'm not. 


**Attempted Treatments**

*Counseling* - I saw a church counselor as a teenager, but as you can imagine, it didn't help anything. He kept saying I was in a ""funk"" whereas I thought the problem must be physiological, and since talking about my (mostly nonexistent) emotions didn't do anything, I stopped going and swore off the idea of therapy.


*Antidepressants* - I've taken Sertraline, Bupropion, Nortriptyline, Tranylcypromine, and a host of others (5-6) that I regrettably didn't keep track of. I took all for 4+ weeks and yet none had -any- effects positive or negative save for the Nortriptyline and Tranylcypromine (The NTP gave me dry mouth, the TCP gave me hypotension, but both oddly made me enjoy music more for a week before pooping out). Due to a limited budget and feeling like ADs were a waste of time for me, I've lost hope with them too.


*Supplements* - Lots of vitamins, a multi-vitamin, Betaine HCL, Sarcosine + NAC, NSI-189, Ashwagandha, probably forgetting some others. As you could have predicted, no effect.


*Meditation* - This is an odd one. When all my other emotions stopped working, I started meditating and was shocked that the ""calmness"" accompanying meditation still worked in me, and I thought there was some meaning in that. But a few months later I tried it again and that sensation was gone too, with no return. So I gave up.


*Exercise* - I took up jogging for a few weeks, it seemed to do absolutely nothing so I gave it up. 


*Diet* - I have tried eating healthier on and off but it didn't help. Also, certain healthy foods like chicken upset my stomach on occasion and I have no clue why. My stomach seems to dislike fruit as well - especially bananas. I have no clue why. I often resort to junk food specifically because it feels like it won't upset my stomach. I visited a G.E. who had my bloodwork done but she said everything looked normal.


*Improving my life* - Tried making friends, going to college, getting a job, getting a car, getting a girlfriend. I did all of it. And still felt like crap. 


**Possible Origins**

*#1) Trauma* - When all this disease stuff started, I was 13. By the time it hit rock bottom, I was 17. During that timespan, my family collapsed, and there were awful shouting matches going for hours every day at points. Sadly, the most likely explanation for the disease is that it's a latent problem that was triggered as a result of the stressor: The lasting damage is not due to the ""trauma"" though - it's not PTSD - it merely used the stress as a trigger. Mental illness (particularly addiction) runs through my family too.


*#2) Some weird stomach problem* - There's evidence for this as well. For one, most people in the Anhedonia subreddit never mention stomach problems (they largely get anhedonia from meds -- I never tried an antidepressant until the disease was severe), while stomach issues are a huge factor in my illness. Two, sometimes I'll eat a specific way and have a brief ""window"" where my sense of smell starts working again. For example, last Winter I quit sugar for a month and my sense of smell improved (and went back to baseline soon after). And a month or two ago, I had it again after eating some European chocolates from the store. But again, couldn't replicate it.


*#3) Something dopamine related* - I drink coffee obsessively, because it keeps me from being a complete zombie. Nortriptyline and Tranylcypromine also act on dopamine AFAIK, and they had a positive effect on me, so I believe this is relevant. But it's likely just one facet of the problem - i.e. not the direct cause.


**Conclusions**

Nothing really makes sense. There are no ups or downs like you see in most depression cases, nor feelings of guilt or worthlessness, nor suicidal ideation. So I'm really tempted to reject the depression idea. It feels like there's just some biological trigger I'm missing that's causing all this, but it's too obscure for me to grasp.


If you have any ideas or things that jump out at you, please let me know! This disease has stolen almost half my time on earth now, and will continue stealing more until it is solved. There are a lot of bright minds here, perhaps one of you can spot something. Thanks.",2,1740485496.0,AskDocs,17,0.58,False
